<h2><a name="ch01"></a>The Damned</h2>

<h3>Chapter I</h3>

<p>'I'm over forty, Frances, and rather set in my ways,' I said
good-naturedly, ready to yield if she insisted that our going together
on the visit involved her happiness. 'My work is rather heavy just now
too, as you know. The question is, could I work there--with a lot of
unassorted people in the house?'</p>

<p>'Mabel doesn't mention any other people, Bill,' was my sister's
rejoinder. 'I gather she's alone--as well as lonely.'</p>

<p>By the way she looked sideways out of the window at nothing, it was
obvious she was disappointed, but to my surprise she did not urge the
point; and as I glanced at Mrs. Franklyn's invitation lying upon her
sloping lap, the neat, childish handwriting conjured up a mental
picture of the banker's widow, with her timid, insignificant
personality, her pale grey eyes and her expression as of a backward
child. I thought, too, of the roomy country mansion her late husband
had altered to suit his particular needs, and of my visit to it a few
years ago when its barren spaciousness suggested a wing of Kensington
Museum fitted up temporarily as a place to eat and sleep in. Comparing
it mentally with the poky Chelsea flat where I and my sister kept
impecunious house, I realised other points as well. Unworthy details
flashed across me to entice: the fine library, the organ, the quiet
work-room I should have, perfect service, the delicious cup of early
tea, and hot baths at any moment of the day--without a geyser!</p>

<p>'It's a longish visit, a month--isn't it?' I hedged, smiling at the
details that seduced me, and ashamed of my man's selfishness, yet
knowing that Frances expected it of me. 'There are points about it, I
admit. If you're set on my going with you, I could manage it all
right.'</p>

<p>I spoke at length in this way because my sister made no answer. I
saw her tired eyes gazing into the dreariness of Oakley Street and felt
a pang strike through me. After a pause, in which again she said no
word, I added: 'So, when you write the letter, you might hint, perhaps,
that I usually work all the morning, and--er--am not a very lively
visitor! Then she'll understand, you see.' And I half-rose to return to
my diminutive study, where I was slaving, just then, at an absorbing
article on Comparative Aesthetic Values in the Blind and Deaf.</p>

<p>But Frances did not move. She kept her grey eyes upon Oakley Street
where the evening mist from the river drew mournful perspectives into
view. It was late October. We heard the omnibuses thundering across the
bridge. The monotony of that broad, characterless street seemed more
than usually depressing. Even in June sunshine it was dead, but with
autumn its melancholy soaked into every house between King's Road and
the Embankment. It washed thought into the past, instead of inviting it
hopefully towards the future. For me, its easy width was an avenue
through which nameless slums across the river sent creeping messages of
depression, and I always regarded it as Winter's main entrance into
London--fog, slush, gloom trooped down it every November, waving their
forbidding banners till March came to rout them.</p>

<p>Its one claim upon my love was that the south wind swept sometimes
unobstructed up it, soft with suggestions of the sea. These lugubrious
thoughts I naturally kept to myself, though I never ceased to regret
the little flat whose cheapness had seduced us. Now, as I watched my
sister's impassive face, I realised that perhaps she, too, felt as I
felt, yet, brave woman, without betraying it.</p>

<p>'And, look here, Fanny,' I said, putting a hand upon her shoulder as
I crossed the room, 'it would be the very thing for you. You're worn
out with catering and housekeeping. Mabel is your oldest friend,
besides, and you've hardly seen her since he died--'</p>

<p>'She's been abroad for a year, Bill, and only just came back,' my
sister interposed. 'She came back rather unexpectedly, though I never
thought she would go there to live--' She stopped abruptly. Clearly,
she was only speaking half her mind. 'Probably,' she went on, 'Mabel
wants to pick up old links again.'</p>

<p>'Naturally,' I put in, 'yourself chief among them.' The veiled
reference to the house I let pass.</p>

<p>It involved discussing the dead man for one thing.</p>

<p>'I feel I ought to go anyhow,' she resumed, 'and of course it would
be jollier if you came too.</p>

<p>'You'd get in such a muddle here by yourself, and eat wrong things,
and forget to air the rooms, and--oh, everything!' She looked up
laughing. 'Only,' she added, 'there's the British Museum--?'</p>

<p>'But there's a big library there,' I answered, 'and all the books of
reference I could possibly want. It was of you I was thinking. You
could take up your painting again; you always sell half of what you
paint. It would be a splendid rest too, and Sussex is a jolly country
to walk in. By all means, Fanny, I advise--'</p>

<p>Our eyes met, as I stammered in my attempts to avoid expressing the
thought that hid in both our minds. My sister had a weakness for
dabbling in the various 'new' theories of the day, and Mabel, who
before her marriage had belonged to foolish societies for investigating
the future life to the neglect of the present one, had fostered this
undesirable tendency. Her amiable, impressionable temperament was open
to every psychic wind that blew. I deplored, detested the whole
business. But even more than this I abhorred the later influence that
Mr. Franklyn had steeped his wife in, capturing her body and soul in
his sombre doctrines. I had dreaded lest my sister also might be
caught.</p>

<p>'Now that she is alone again--'</p>

<p>I stopped short. Our eyes now made pretence impossible, for the
truth had slipped out inevitably, stupidly, although unexpressed in
definite language. We laughed, turning our faces a moment to look at
other things in the room. Frances picked up a book and examined its
cover as though she had made an important discovery, while I took my
case out and lit a cigarette I did not want to smoke. We left the
matter there. I went out of the room before further explanation could
cause tension. Disagreements grow into discord from such tiny
things--wrong adjectives, or a chance inflection of the voice. Frances
had a right to her views of life as much as I had. At least, I
reflected comfortably, we had separated upon an agreement this time,
recognised mutually, though not actually stated.</p>

<p>And this point of meeting was, oddly enough, our way of regarding
some one who was dead.</p>

<p>For we had both disliked the husband with a great dislike, and
during his three years' married life had only been to the house
once--for a weekend visit; arriving late on Saturday, we had left after
an early breakfast on Monday morning. Ascribing my sister's dislike to
a natural jealousy at losing her old friend, I said merely that he
displeased me. Yet we both knew that the real emotion lay much deeper.
Frances, loyal, honourable creature, had kept silence; and beyond
saying that house and grounds--he altered one and laid out the
other--distressed her as an expression of his personality somehow
("distressed" was the word she used), no further explanation had passed
her lips.</p>

<p>Our dislike of his personality was easily accounted for--up to a
point, since both of us shared the artist's point of view that a creed,
cut to measure and carefully dried, was an ugly thing, and that a dogma
to which believers must subscribe or perish everlastingly was a
barbarism resting upon cruelty. But while my own dislike was purely due
to an abstract worship of Beauty, my sister's had another twist in it,
for with her 'new' tendencies, she believed that all religions were an
aspect of truth and that no one, even the lowest wretch, could escape
'heaven' in the long run.</p>

<p>Samuel Franklyn, the rich banker, was a man universally respected
and admired, and the marriage, though Mabel was fifteen years his
junior, won general applause; his bride was an heiress in her own
right--breweries--and the story of her conversion at a revivalist
meeting where Samuel Franklyn had spoken fervidly of heaven, and
terrifyingly of sin, hell and damnation, even contained a touch of
genuine romance. She was a brand snatched from the burning; his
detailed eloquence had frightened her into heaven; salvation came in
the nick of time; his words had plucked her from the edge of that lake
of fire and brimstone where their worm dieth not and the fire is not
quenched. She regarded him as a hero, sighed her relief upon his
saintly shoulder, and accepted the peace he offered her with a grateful
resignation.</p>

<p>For her husband was a 'religious man' who successfully combined
great riches with the glamour of winning souls. He was a portly figure,
though tall, with masterful, big hands, his fingers rather thick and
red; and his dignity, that just escaped being pompous, held in it
something that was implacable. A convinced assurance, almost
remorseless, gleamed in his eyes when he preached especially, and his
threats of hell fire must have scared souls stronger than the timid,
receptive Mabel whom he married. He clad himself in long frock-coats
hat buttoned unevenly, big square boots, and trousers that invariably
bagged at the knee and were a little short; he wore low collars, spats
occasionally, and a tall black hat that was not of silk. His voice was
alternately hard and unctuous; and he regarded theatres, ball-rooms and
race-courses as the vestibule of that brimstone lake of whose geography
he was as positive as of his great banking offices in the City. A
philanthropist up to the hilt, however, no one ever doubted his
complete sincerity; his convictions were ingrained, his faith borne out
by his life--as witness his name upon so many admirable Societes, as
treasurer, patron, or heading the donation list. He bulked large in the
world of doing good, a broad and stately stone in the rampart against
evil. And his heart was genuinely kind and soft for others--who
believed as he did.</p>

<p>Yet, in spite of this true sympathy with suffering and his desire to
help, he was narrow as a telegraph wire and unbending as a church
pillar; he was intensely selfish; intolerant as an officer of the
Inquisition, his bourgeois soul constructed a revolting scheme of
heaven that was reproduced in miniature in all he did and planned.
Faith was the sine qua non of salvation, and by 'faith' he meant belief
in his own particular view of things--'which faith, except every one do
keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he shall perish everlastingly.'
All the world but his own small, exclusive sect must be damned
eternally--a pity, but alas, inevitable. He was right.</p>

<p>Yet he prayed without ceasing, and gave heavily to the poor--the
only thing he could not give being big ideas to his provincial and
suburban deity. Pettier than an insect, and more obstinate than a mule,
he had also the superior, sleek humility of a 'chosen one.' He was
churchwarden too. He read the Lesson in a 'place of worship,' either
chilly or overheated, where neither organ, vestments, nor lighted
candles were permitted, but where the odour of hair-wash on the boys'
heads in the back rows pervaded the entire building.</p>

<p>This portrait of the banker, who accumulated riches both on earth
and in heaven, may possibly be overdrawn, however, because Frances and
I were 'artistic temperaments' that viewed the type with a dislike and
distrust amounting to contempt. The majority considered Samuel Franklyn
a worthy man and a good citizen. The majority, doubtless, held the
saner view. A few years more, and he certainly would have been made a
baronet. He relieved much suffering in the world, as assuredly as he
caused many souls the agonies of torturing fear by his emphasis upon
damnation.</p>

<p>Had there been one point of beauty in him, we might have been more
lenient; only we found it not, and, I admit, took little pains to
search. I shall never forget the look of dour forgiveness with which he
heard our excuses for missing Morning Prayers that Sunday morning of
our single visit to The Towers. My sister learned that a change was
made soon afterwards, prayers being 'conducted' after breakfast instead
of before.</p>

<p>The Towers stood solemnly upon a Sussex hill amid park-like modern
grounds, but the house cannot better be described--it would be so
wearisome for one thing--than by saying that it was a cross between an
overgrown, pretentious Norwood villa and one of those saturnine
Institutes for cripples the train passes as it slinks ashamed through
South London into Surrey. It was 'wealthily' furnished and at first
sight imposing, but on closer acquaintance revealed a meagre
personality, barren and austere. One looked for Rules and Regulations
on the walls, all signed By Order. The place was a prison that shut out
'the world.' There was, of course, no billiard-room, no smoking-room,
no room for play of any kind, and the great hall at the back, once a
chapel, which might have been used for dancing, theatricals, or other
innocent amusements, was consecrated in his day to meetings of various
kinds, chiefly brigades, temperance or missionary societies. There was
a harmonium at one end--on the level floor--a raised dais or platform
at the other, and a gallery above for the servants, gardeners and
coachmen. It was heated with hot-water pipes, and hung with
Dor&eacute;'s pictures, though these latter were soon removed and
stored out of sight in the attics as being too unspiritual. In
polished, shiny wood, it was a representation in miniature of that poky
exclusive Heaven he took about with him, externalising it in all he did
and planned, even in the grounds about the house.</p>

<p>Changes in The Towers, Frances told me, had been made during Mabel's
year of widowhood abroad--an organ put into the big hall, the library
made liveable and recatalogued--when it was permissible to suppose she
had found her soul again and returned to her normal, healthy views of
life, which included enjoyment and play, literature, music and the
arts, without, however, a touch of that trivial thoughtlessness usually
termed worldliness. Mrs. Franklyn, as I remembered her, was a quiet
little woman, shallow, perhaps, and easily influenced, but sincere as a
dog and thorough in her faithful Friendship. Her tastes at heart were
catholic, and that heart was simple and unimaginative. That she took up
with the various movements of the day was a sign merely that she was
searching in her limited way for a belief that should bring her peace.
She was, in fact, a very ordinary woman, her calibre a little less than
that of Frances. I knew they used to discuss all kinds of theories
together, but as these discussions never resulted in action, I had come
to regard her as harmless. Still, I was not sorry when she married, and
I did not welcome now a renewal of the former intimacy. The
philanthropist she had given no children, or she would have made a good
and sensible mother. No doubt she would marry again.</p>

<p>'Mabel mentions that she's been alone at The Towers since the end of
August,' Frances told me at tea-time; 'and I'm sure she feels out of it
and lonely. It would be a kindness to go. Besides, I always liked
her.'</p>

<p>I agreed. I had recovered from my attack of selfishness. I expressed
my pleasure.</p>

<p>'You've written to accept,' I said, half statement and half
question.</p>

<p>Frances nodded. 'I thanked for you,' she added quietly, 'explaining
that you were not free at the moment, but that later, if not
inconvenient, you might come down for a bit and join me.'</p>

<p>I stared. Frances sometimes had this independent way of deciding
things. I was convicted, and punished into the bargain.</p>

<p>Of course there followed argument and explanation, as between
brother and sister who were affectionate, but the recording of our talk
could be of little interest. It was arranged thus, Frances and I both
satisfied. Two days later she departed for The Towers, leaving me alone
in the flat with everything planned for my comfort and good
behaviour--she was rather a tyrant in her quiet way--and her last words
as I saw her off from Charing Cross rang in my head for a long time
after she was gone:</p>

<p>'I'll write and let you know, Bill. Eat properly, mind, and let me
know if anything goes wrong.'</p>

<p>She waved her small gloved hand, nodded her head till the feather
brushed the window, and was gone.</p>

<h3>Chapter II</h3>

<p>After the note announcing her safe arrival a week of silence passed,
and then a letter came; there were various suggestions for my welfare,
and the rest was the usual rambling information and description Frances
loved, generously italicised.</p>

<p>'...and we are quite alone,' she went on in her enormous handwriting
that seemed such a waste of space and labour, 'though some others are
coming presently, I believe. You could work here to your heart's
content. Mabel quite understands, and says she would love to have you
when you feel free to come. She has changed a bit--back to her old
natural self: she never mentions him. The place has changed too in
certain ways: it has more cheerfulness, I think. She has put it in,
this cheerfulness, spaded it in, if you know what I mean; but it lies
about uneasily and is not natural--quite. The organ is a beauty. She
must be very rich now, but she's as gentle and sweet as ever. Do you
know, Bill, I think he must have frightened her into marrying him. I
get the impression she was afraid of him.' This last sentence was inked
out, I but I read it through the scratching; the letters being too big
to hide. 'He had an inflexible will beneath all that oily kindness
which passed for spiritual. He was a real personality, I mean. I'm sure
he'd have sent you and me cheerfully to the stake in another
century--for our own good. Isn't it odd she never speaks of him, even
to me?' This, again, was stroked through, though without the intention
to obliterate--merely because it was repetition, probably. 'The only
reminder of him in the house now is a big copy of the presentation
portrait that stands on the stairs of the Multitechnic Institute at
Peckham--you know--that life-size one with his fat hand sprinkled with
rings resting on a thick Bible and the other slipped between the
buttons of a tight frock-coat. It hangs in the dining-room and rather
dominates our meals. I wish Mabel would take it down. I think she'd
like to, if she dared. There's not a single photograph of him anywhere,
even in her own room. Mrs. Marsh is here--you remember her, his
housekeeper, the wife of the man who got penal servitude for killing a
baby or something--you said she robbed him and justified her stealing
because the story of the unjust steward was in the Bible! How we
laughed over that! She's just the same too, gliding about all over the
house and turning up when least expected.'</p>

<p>Other reminiscences filled the next two sides of the letter, and
ran, without a trace of punctuation, into instructions about a
Salamander stove for heating my work-room in the flat; these were
followed by things I was to tell the cook, and by requests for several
articles she had forgotten and would like sent after her, two of them
blouses, with descriptions so lengthy and contradictory that I sighed
as I read them--'unless you come down soon, in which case perhaps you
wouldn't mind bringing them; not the mauve one I wear in the evening
sometimes, but the pale blue one with lace round the collar and the
crinkly front. They're in the cupboard--or the drawer, I'm not sure
which--of my bedroom. Ask Annie if you're in doubt. Thanks most
awfully.</p>

<p>Send a telegram, remember, and we'll meet you in the motor any time.
I don't quite know if I shall stay the whole month--alone. It all
depends...' And she closed the letter, the italicised words increasing
recklessly towards the end, with a repetition that Mabel would love to
have me 'for myself,' as also to have a 'man in the house,' and that I
only had to telegraph the day and the train...' This letter, coming by
the second post, interrupted me in a moment of absorbing work, and,
having read it through to make sure there was nothing requiring instant
attention, I threw it aside and went on with my notes and reading.
Within five minutes, however, it was back at me again. That restless
thing called 'between the lines' fluttered about my mind. My interest
in the Balkan States--political article that had been 'ordered'--faded.
Somewhere, somehow I felt disquieted, disturbed. At first I persisted
in my work, forcing myself to concentrate, but soon found that a layer
of new impressions floated between the article and my attention. It was
like a shadow, though a shadow that dissolved upon inspection. Once or
twice I glanced up, expecting to find some one in the room, that the
door had opened unobserved and Annie was waiting for instructions. I
heard the 'buses thundering across the bridge. I was aware of Oakley
Street.</p>

<p>Montenegro and the blue Adriatic melted into the October haze along
that depressing Embankment that aped a river bank, and sentences from
the letter flashed before my eyes and stung me. Picking it up and
reading it through more carefully, I rang the bell and told Annie to
find the blouses and pack them for the post, showing her finally the
written description, and resenting the superior smile with which she at
once interrupted. 'I know them, sir,' and disappeared.</p>

<p>But it was not the blouses: it was that exasperating thing 'between
the lines' that put an end to my work with its elusive teasing
nuisance. The first sharp impression is alone of value in such a case,
for once analysis begins the imagination constructs all kinds of false
interpretation. The more I thought, the more I grew fuddled. The
letter, it seemed to me, wanted to say another thing; instead the eight
sheets conveyed it merely. It came to the edge of disclosure, then
halted.</p>

<p>There was something on the writer's mind, and I felt uneasy.
Studying the sentences brought, however, no revelation, but increased
confusion only; for while the uneasiness remained, the first clear hint
had vanished. In the end I closed my books and went out to look up
another matter at the British Museum library. Perhaps I should discover
it that way--by turning the mind in a totally new direction. I lunched
at the Express Dairy in Oxford Street close by, and telephoned to Annie
that I would be home to tea at five.</p>

<p>And at tea, tired physically and mentally after breathing the
exhausted air of the Rotunda for five hours, my mind suddenly delivered
up its original impression, vivid and clear-cut; no proof accompanied
the revelation; it was mere presentiment, but convincing. Frances was
disturbed in her mind, her orderly, sensible, housekeeping mind; she
was uneasy, even perhaps afraid; something in the house distressed her,
and she had need of me. Unless I went down, her time of rest and
change, her quite necessary holiday, in fact, would be spoilt. She was
too unselfish to say this, but it ran everywhere between the lines. I
saw it clearly now. Mrs. Franklyn, moreover--and that meant Frances
too--would like a 'man in the house.' It was a disagreeable phrase, a
suggestive way of hinting something she dared not state definitely. The
two women in that great, lonely barrack of a house were afraid.</p>

<p>My sense of duty, affection, unselfishness, whatever the composite
emotion may be termed, was stirred; also my vanity. I acted quickly,
lest reflection should warp clear, decent judgment.</p>

<p>'Annie,' I said, when she answered the bell, 'you need not send
those blouses by the post. I'll take them down tomorrow when I go. I
shall be away a week or two, possibly longer.' And, having looked up a
train, I hastened out to telegraph before I could change my fickle
mind.</p>

<p>But no desire came that night to change my mind. I was doing the
right, the necessary thing. I was even in something of a hurry to get
down to The Towers as soon as possible. I chose an early afternoon
train.</p>

<h3>Chapter III</h3>

<p>A telegram had told me to come to a town ten miles from the house,
so I was saved the crawling train to the local station, and travelled
down by an express. As soon as we left London the fog cleared off, and
an autumn sun, though without heat in it, painted the landscape with
golden browns and yellows. My spirits rose as I lay back in the
luxurious motor and sped between the woods and hedges. Oddly enough, my
anxiety of overnight had disappeared. It was due, no doubt, to that
exaggeration of detail which reflection in loneliness brings. Frances
and I had not been separated for over a year, and her letters from The
Towers told so little. It had seemed unnatural to be deprived of those
intimate particulars of mood and feeling I was accustomed to. We had
such confidence in one another, and our affection was so deep. Though
she was but five years younger than myself, I regarded her as a child.
My attitude was fatherly.</p>

<p>In return, she certainly mothered me with a solicitude that never
cloyed. I felt no desire to marry while she was still alive. She
painted in water-colours with a reasonable success, and kept house for
me; I wrote, reviewed books and lectured on aesthetics; we were a
humdrum couple of quasi-artists, well satisfied with life, and all I
feared for her was that she might become a suffragette or be taken
captive by one of these wild theories that caught her imagination
sometimes, and that Mabel, for one, had fostered. As for myself, no
doubt she deemed me a trifle solid or stolid--I forget which word she
preferred--but on the whole there was just sufficient difference of
opinion to make intercourse suggestive without monotony, and certainly
without quarrelling.</p>

<p>Drawing in deep draughts of the stinging autumn air, I felt happy
and exhilarated. It was like going for a holiday, with comfort at the
end of the journey instead of bargaining for centimes.</p>

<p>But my heart sank noticeably the moment the house came into view.
The long drive, lined with hostile monkey trees and formal
wellingtonias that were solemn and sedate, was mere extension of the
miniature approach to a thousand semidetached suburban 'residences';
and the appearance of The Towers, as we turned the corner with a rush,
suggested a commonplace climax to a story that had begun interestingly,
almost thrillingly. A villa had escaped from the shadow of the Crystal
Palace, thumped its way down by night, grown suddenly monstrous in a
shower of rich rain, and settled itself insolently to stay. Ivy climbed
about the opulent red-brick walls, but climbed neatly and with
disfiguring effect, sham as on a prison or--the simile made me
smile--an orphan asylum. There was no hint of the comely roughness of
untidy ivy on a ruin. Clipped, trained and precise it was, as on a
brand-new protestant church. I swear there was not a bird's nest nor a
single earwig in it anywhere. About the porch it was particularly
thick, smothering a seventeenth-century lamp with a contrast that was
quite horrible. Extensive glass-houses spread away on the farther side
of the house; the numerous towers to which the building owed its name
seemed made to hold school bells; and the window-sills, thick with
potted flowers, made me think of the desolate suburbs of Brighton or
Bexhill. In a commanding position upon the crest of a hill, it
overlooked miles of undulating, wooded country southwards to the Downs,
but behind it, to the north, thick banks of ilex, holly and privet
protected it from the cleaner and more stimulating winds. Hence, though
highly placed, it was shut in. Three years had passed since I last set
eyes upon, it, but the unsightly memory I had retained was justified by
the reality. The place was deplorable.</p>

<p>It is my habit to express my opinions audibly sometimes, when
impressions are strong enough to warrant it; but now I only sighed 'Oh,
dear,' as I extricated my legs from many rugs and went into the house.
A tall parlour-maid, with the bearing of a grenadier, received me, and
standing behind her was Mrs. Marsh, the housekeeper, whom I remembered
because her untidy back hair had suggested to me that it had been
burnt. I went at once to my room, my hostess already dressing for
dinner, but Frances came in to see me just as I was struggling with my
black tie that had got tangled like a bootlace. She fastened it for me
in a neat, effective bow, and while I held my chin up for the
operation, staring blankly at the ceiling, the impression came--I
wondered, was it her touch that caused it?--that something in her
trembled. Shrinking perhaps is the truer word. Nothing in her face or
manner betrayed it, nor in her pleasant, easy talk while she tidied my
things and scolded my slovenly packing, as her habit was, questioning
me about the servants at the flat. The blouses, though right, were
crumpled, and my scolding was deserved. There was no impatience even.
Yet somehow or other the suggestion of a shrinking reserve and holding
back reached my mind. She had been lonely, of course, but it was more
than that; she was glad that I had come, yet for some reason unstated
she could have wished that I had stayed away. We discussed the news
that had accumulated during our brief separation, and in doing so the
impression, at best exceedingly slight, was forgotten. My chamber was
large and beautifully furnished; the hall and dining-room of our flat
would have gone into it with a good remainder; yet it was not a place I
could settle down in for work. It conveyed the idea of impermanence,
making me feel transient as in a hotel bedroom. This, of course, was
the fact. But some rooms convey a settled, lasting hospitality even in
a hotel; this one did not; and as I was accustomed to work in the room
I slept in, at least when visiting, a slight frown must have crept
between my eyes.</p>

<p>'Mabel has fitted a work-room for you just out of the library,' said
the clairvoyant Frances.</p>

<p>'No one will disturb you there, and you'll have fifteen thousand
books all catalogued within easy reach. There's a private staircase
too. You can breakfast in your room and slip down in your dressing-gown
if you want to.' She laughed. My spirits took a turn upwards as
absurdly as they had gone down.</p>

<p>'And how are you?' I asked, giving her a belated kiss. 'It's jolly
to be together again. I did feel rather lost without you, I'll
admit.'</p>

<p>'That's natural,' she laughed. 'I'm so glad.'</p>

<p>She looked well and had country colour in her cheeks. She informed
me that she was eating and sleeping well, going out for little walks
with Mabel, painting bits of scenery again, and enjoying a complete
change and rest; and yet, for all her brave description, the word
somehow did not quite ring true. Those last words in particular did not
ring true. There lay in her manner, just out of sight, I felt, this
suggestion of the exact reverse--of unrest, shrinking, almost of
anxiety. Certain small strings in her seemed over-tight. 'Keyed-up' was
the slang expression that crossed my mind. I looked rather searchingly
into her face as she was telling me this.</p>

<p>'Only--the evenings,' she added, noticing my query, yet rather
avoiding my eyes, 'the evenings are--well, rather heavy sometimes, and
I find it difficult to keep awake.'</p>

<p>'The strong air after London makes you drowsy,' I suggested, 'and
you like to get early to bed.'</p>

<p>Frances turned and looked at me for a moment steadily. 'On the
contrary, Bill, I dislike going to bed--here. And Mabel goes so early.'
She said it lightly enough, fingering the disorder upon my
dressing-table in such a stupid way that I saw her mind was working in
another direction altogether. She looked up suddenly with a kind of
nervousness from the brush and scissors.</p>

<p>'Billy,' she said abruptly, lowering her voice, 'isn't it odd, but I
hate sleeping alone here? I can't make it out quite; I've never felt
such a thing before in my life. Do you--think it's all nonsense?'</p>

<p>And she laughed, with her lips but not with her eyes; there was a
note of defiance in her I failed to understand.</p>

<p>'Nothing a nature like yours feels strongly is nonsense, Frances,' I
replied soothingly.</p>

<p>But I, too, answered with my lips only, for another part of my mind
was working elsewhere, and among uncomfortable things. A touch of
bewilderment passed over me. I was not certain how best to continue. If
I laughed she would tell me no more, yet if I took her too seriously
the strings would tighten further. Instinctively, then, this flashed
rapidly across me: that something of what she felt, I had also felt,
though interpreting it differently. Vague it was, as the coming of rain
or storm that announce themselves hours in advance with their hint of
faint, unsettling excitement in the air. I had been but a short hour in
the house--big, comfortable, luxurious house--but had experienced this
sense of being unsettled, unfixed, fluctuating--a kind of impermanence
that transient lodgers in hotels must feel, but that a guest in a
friend's home ought not to feel, be the visit short or long. To
Frances, an impressionable woman, the feeling had come in the terms of
alarm. She disliked sleeping alone, while yet she longed to sleep. The
precise idea in my mind evaded capture, merely brushing through me,
three-quarters out of sight; I realised only that we both felt the same
thing, and that neither of us could get at it clearly.</p>

<p>Degrees of unrest we felt, but the actual thing did not disclose
itself. It did not happen.</p>

<p>I felt strangely at sea for a moment. Frances would interpret
hesitation as endorsement, and encouragement might be the last thing
that could help her.</p>

<p>'Sleeping in a strange house,' I answered at length, 'is often
difficult at first, and one feels lonely. After fifteen months in our
tiny flat one feels lost and uncared-for in a big house. It's an
uncomfortable feeling--I know it well. And this is a barrack, isn't it?
The masses of furniture only make it worse. One feels in storage
somewhere underground--the furniture doesn't furnish. One must never
yield to fancies, though--'</p>

<p>Frances looked away towards the windows; she seemed disappointed a
little.</p>

<p>'After our thickly-populated Chelsea,' I went on quickly, 'it seems
isolated here.'</p>

<p>But she did not turn back, and clearly I was saying the wrong thing.
A wave of pity rushed suddenly over me. Was she really frightened,
perhaps? She was imaginative, I knew, but never moody; common sense was
strong in her, though she had her times of hypersensitiveness. I caught
the echo of some unreasoning, big alarm in her. She stood there, gazing
across my balcony towards the sea of wooded country that spread dim and
vague in the obscurity of the dusk. The deepening shadows entered the
room, I fancied, from the grounds below. Following her abstracted gaze
a moment, I experienced a curious sharp desire to leave, to escape. Out
yonder was wind and space and freedom. This enormous building was
oppressive, silent, still.</p>

<p>Great catacombs occured to me, things beneath the ground,
imprisonment and capture. I believe I even shuddered a little.</p>

<p>I touched her shoulder. She turned round slowly, and we looked with
a certain deliberation into each other's eyes.</p>

<p>'Fanny,' I asked, more gravely than I intended, 'you are not
frightened, are you? Nothing has happened, has it?'</p>

<p>She replied with emphasis, 'Of course not! How could it--I mean, why
should I?' She stammered, as though the wrong sentence flustered her a
second. 'It's simply--that I have this ter--this dislike of sleeping
alone.'</p>

<p>Naturally, my first thought was how easy it would be to cut our
visit short. But I did not say this. Had it been a true solution,
Frances would have said it for me long ago.</p>

<p>'Wouldn't Mabel double-up with you,' I said instead, 'or give you an
adjoining room, so that you could leave the door between you open?
There's space enough, heaven knows.'</p>

<p>And then, as the gong sounded in the hall below for dinner, she
said, as with an effort, this thing:</p>

<p>'Mabel did ask me--on the third night--after I had told her. But I
declined.'</p>

<p>'You'd rather be alone than with her?' I asked, with a certain
relief.</p>

<p>Her reply was so gravely given, a child would have known there was
more behind it: 'Not that; but that she did not really want it.'</p>

<p>I had a moment's intuition and acted on it impulsively. 'She feels
it too, perhaps, but wishes to face it by herself--and get over
it?'</p>

<p>My sister bowed her head, and the gesture made me realise of a
sudden how grave and solemn our talk had grown, as though some
portentous thing were under discussion. It had come of
itself--indefinite as a gradual change of temperature. Yet neither of
us knew its nature, for apparently neither of us could state it
plainly. Nothing happened, even in our words.</p>

<p>'That was my impression,' she said, '--that if she yields to it she
encourages it. And a habit forms so easily. Just think,' she added with
a faint smile that was the first sign of lightness she had yet
betrayed, 'what a nuisance it would be--everywhere--if everybody was
afraid of being alone--like that.'</p>

<p>I snatched readily at the chance. We laughed a little, though it was
a quiet kind of laughter that seemed wrong. I took her arm and led her
towards the door.</p>

<p>'Disastrous, in fact,' I agreed.</p>

<p>She raised her voice to its normal pitch again, as I had done. 'No
doubt it will pass,' she said, 'now that you have come. Of course, it's
chiefly my imagination.' Her tone was lighter, though nothing could
convince me that the matter itself was light--just then. 'And in any
case,' tightening her grip on my arm as we passed into the bright
enormous corridor and caught sight of Mrs. Franklyn waiting in the
cheerless hall below, 'I'm very glad you're here, Bill, and Mabel, I
know, is too.'</p>

<p>'If it doesn't pass,' I just had time to whisper with a feeble
attempt at jollity, 'I'll come at night and snore outside your door.
After that you'll be so glad to get rid of me that you won't mind being
alone.'</p>

<p>'That's a bargain,' said Frances.</p>

<p>I shook my hostess by the hand, made a banal remark about the long
interval since last we met, and walked behind them into the great
dining-room, dimly lit by candles, wondering in my heart how long my
sister and I should stay, and why in the world we had ever left our
cosy little flat to enter this desolation of riches and false luxury at
all. The unsightly picture of the late Samuel Franklyn, Esq., stared
down upon me from the farther end of the room above the mighty
mantel-piece.</p>

<p>He looked, I thought, like some pompous Heavenly Butler who denied
to all the world, and to us in particular, the right of entry without
presentation cards signed by his hand as proof that we belonged to his
own exclusive set. The majority, to his deep grief, and in spite of all
his prayers on their behalf, must burn and 'perish everlastingly.'</p>

<h3>Chapter IV</h3>

<p>With the instinct of the healthy bachelor I always try to make
myself a nest in the place I live in, be it for long or short. Whether
visiting, in lodging-house, or in hotel, the first essential is this
nest--one's own things built into the walls as a bird builds in its
feathers. It may look desolate and uncomfortable enough to others,
because the central detail is neither bed nor wardrobe, sofa nor
arm-chair, but a good solid writing-table that does not wriggle, and
that has wide elbow-room.</p>

<p>And The Towers is vividly described for me by the single fact that I
could not 'nest' there.</p>

<p>I took several days to discover this, but the first impression of
impermanence was truer than I knew. The feathers of the mind refused
here to lie one way. They ruffled, pointed and grew wild.</p>

<p>Luxurious furniture does not mean comfort; I might as well have
tried to settle down in the sofa and arm-chair department of a big
shop. My bedroom was easily managed; it was the private workroom,
prepared especially for my reception, that made me feel alien and
outcast.</p>

<p>Externally, it was all one could desire: an ante-chamber to the
great library, with not one, but two generous oak tables, to say
nothing of smaller ones against the walls with capacious drawers.</p>

<p>There were reading-desks, mechanical devices for holding books,
perfect light, quiet as in a church, and no approach but across the
huge adjoining room. Yet it did not invite.</p>

<p>'I hope you'll be able to work here,' said my little hostess the
next morning, as she took me in--her only visit to it while I stayed in
the house--and showed me the ten-volume Catalogue.</p>

<p>'It's absolutely quiet and no one will disturb you.'</p>

<p>'If you can't, Bill, you're not much good,' laughed Frances, who was
on her arm. 'Even I could write in a study like this!'</p>

<p>I glanced with pleasure at the ample tables, the sheets of thick
blotting-paper, the rulers, sealing-wax, paper-knives, and all the
other immaculate paraphernalia. 'It's perfect,' I answered with a
secret thrill, yet feeling a little foolish. This was for Gibbon or
Carlyle, rather than for my pot-boiling insignificancies. 'If I can't
write masterpieces here, it's certainly not your fault,' and I turned
with gratitude to Mrs. Franklyn. She was looking straight at me, and
there was a question in her small pale eyes I did not understand. Was
she noting the effect upon me, I wondered?</p>

<p>'You'll write here--perhaps a story about the house,' she said,
'Thompson will bring you anything you want; you only have to ring.' She
pointed to the electric bell on the central table, the wire running
neatly down the leg. 'No one has ever worked here before, and the
library has been hardly used since it was put in. So there's no
previous atmosphere to affect your imagination--er--adversely.'</p>

<p>We laughed. 'Bill isn't that sort,' said my sister; while I wished
they would go out and leave me to arrange my little nest and set to
work.</p>

<p>I thought, of course, it was the huge listening library that made me
feel so inconsiderable--the fifteen thousand silent, staring books, the
solemn aisles, the deep, eloquent shelves. But when the women had gone
and I was alone, the beginning of the truth crept over me, and I felt
that first hint of disconsolateness which later became an imperative
No. The mind shut down, images ceased to rise and flow. I read, made
copious notes, but I wrote no single line at The Towers.</p>

<p>Nothing completed itself there. Nothing happened.</p>

<p>The morning sunshine poured into the library through ten long narrow
windows; birds were singing; the autumn air, rich with a faint aroma of
November melancholy that stung the imagination pleasantly, filled my
ante-chamber. I looked out upon the undulating wooded landscape, hemmed
in by the sweep of distant Downs, and I tasted a whiff of the sea.
Rooks cawed as they floated above the elms, and there were lazy cows in
the nearer meadows. A dozen times I tried to make my nest and settle
down to work, and a dozen times, like a turning fastidious dog upon a
hearth-rug, I rearranged my chair and books and papers. The temptation
of the Catalogue and shelves, of course, was accountable for much, yet
not, I felt, for all. That was a manageable seduction. My work,
moreover, was not of the creative kind that requires absolute
absorption; it was the mere readable presentation of data I had
accumulated. My note-books were charged with facts ready to
tabulate--facts, too, that interested me keenly. A mere effort of the
will was necessary, and concentration of no difficult kind. Yet,
somehow, it seemed beyond me: something for ever pushed the facts into
disorder...and in the end I sat in the sunshine, dipping into a dozen
books selected from the shelves outside, vexed with myself and only
half-enjoying it. I felt restless. I wanted to be elsewhere.</p>

<p>And even while I read, attention wandered. Frances, Mabel, her late
husband, the house and grounds, each in turn and sometimes all
together, rose uninvited into the stream of thought, hindering any
consecutive flow of work. In disconnected fashion came these pictures
that interrupted concentration, yet presenting themselves as broken
fragments of a bigger thing my mind already groped for unconsciously.
They fluttered round this hidden thing of which they were aspects,
fugitive interpretations, no one of them bringing complete revelation.
There was no adjective, such as pleasant or unpleasant, that I could
attach to what I felt, beyond that the result was unsettling. Vague as
the atmosphere of a dream, it yet persisted, and I could not dissipate
it.</p>

<p>Isolated words or phrases in the lines I read sent questions
scouring across my mind, sure sign that the deeper part of me was
restless and ill at ease.</p>

<p>Rather trivial questions too--half-foolish interrogations, as of a
puzzled or curious child: Why was my sister afraid to sleep alone, and
why did her friend feel a similar repugnance, yet seek to conquer it?
Why was the solid luxury of the house without comfort, its shelter
without the sense of permanence? Why had Mrs. Franklyn asked us to
come, artists, unbelieving vagabonds, types at the farthest possible
remove from the saved sheep of her husband's household? Had a reaction
set in against the hysteria of her conversion? I had seen no signs of
religious fervour in her; her atmosphere was that of an ordinary,
high-minded woman, yet a woman of the world. Lifeless, though, a
little, perhaps, now that I came to think about it: she had made no
definite impression upon me of any kind. And my thoughts ran vaguely
after this fragile clue.</p>

<p>Closing my book, I let them run. For, with this chance reflection
came the discovery that I could not see her clearly--could not feel her
soul, her personality. Her face, her small pale eyes, her dress and
body and walk, all these stood before me like a photograph; but her
Self evaded me. She seemed not there, lifeless, empty, a
shadow--nothing. The picture was disagreeable, and I put it by.
Instantly she melted out, as though light thought had conjured up a
phantom that had no real existence. And at that very moment, singularly
enough, my eye caught sight of her moving past the window, going
silently along the gravel path. I watched her, a sudden new sensation
gripping me. 'There goes a prisoner,' my thought instantly ran, 'one
who wishes to escape, but cannot.'</p>

<p>What brought the outlandish notion, heaven only knows. The house was
of her own choice, she was twice an heiress, and the world lay open at
her feet. Yet she stayed--unhappy, frightened, caught. All this flashed
over me, and made a sharp impression even before I had time to dismiss
it as absurd. But a moment later explanation offered itself, though it
seemed as far-fetched as the original impression. My mind, being
logical, was obliged to provide something, apparently. For Mrs.
Franklyn, while dressed to go out, with thick walking-boots, a pointed
stick, and a motor-cap tied on with a veil as for the windy lanes, was
obviously content to go no farther than the little garden paths. The
costume was a sham and a pretence. It was this, and her lithe, quick
movements that suggested a caged creature--a creature tamed by fear and
cruelty that cloaked themselves in kindness--pacing up and down, unable
to realise why it got no farther, but always met the same bars in
exactly the same place. The mind in her was barred.</p>

<p>I watched her go along the paths and down the steps from one terrace
to another, until the laurels hid her altogether; and into this mere
imagining of a moment came a hint of something slightly disagreeable,
for which my mind, search as it would, found no explanation at all. I
remembered then certain other little things. They dropped into the
picture of their own accord. In a mind not deliberately hunting for
clues, pieces of a puzzle sometimes come together in this way, bringing
revelation, so that for a second there flashed across me, vanishing
instantly again before I could consider it, a large, distressing
thought. I can only describe vaguely as a Shadow.</p>

<p>Dark and ugly, oppressive certainly it might be described, with
something torn and dreadful about the edges that suggested pain and
strife and terror. The interior of a prison with two rows of occupied
condemned cells, seen years ago in New York, sprang to memory after
it--the connection between the two impossible to surmise even. But the
'certain other little things' mentioned above were these: that Mrs.
Franklyn, in last night's dinner talk, had always referred to 'this
house' but never called it 'home' and had emphasised unnecessarily, for
a well-bred woman, our 'great kindness' in coming down to stay so long
with her. Another time, in answer to my futile compliment about the
'stately rooms,' she said quietly, 'It is an enormous house for so
small a party; but I stay here very little, and only till I get it
straight again.' The three of us were going up the great staircase to
bed as this was said, and, not knowing quite her meaning, I dropped the
subject. It edged delicate ground, I felt. Frances added no word of her
own. It now occurred to me abruptly that 'stay' was the word made use
of, when 'live' would have been more natural. How insignificant to
recall! Yet why did they suggest themselves just at this moment?.</p>

<p>And, on going to Frances's room to make sure she was not nervous or
lonely, I realised abruptly, that Mrs. Franklyn, of course, had talked
with her in a confidential sense that I, as a mere visiting brother,
could not share. Frances had told me nothing. I might easily have
wormed it out of her, had I not felt that for us to discuss further our
hostess and her house merely because we were under the roof together,
was not quite nice or loyal.</p>

<p>'I'll call you, Bill, if I'm scared,' she had laughed as we parted,
my room being just across the big corridor from her own. I had fallen
asleep, thinking what in the world was meant by 'getting it straight
again.'</p>

<p>And now in my ante-chamber to the library, on the second morning,
sitting among piles of foolscap and sheets of spotless blotting-paper,
all useless to me, these slight hints came back and helped to frame the
big, vague Shadow I have mentioned. Up to the neck in this Shadow,
almost drowned, yet just treading water, stood the figure of my hostess
in her walking costume. Frances and I seemed swimming to her aid. The
Shadow was large enough to include both house and grounds, but farther
than that I could not see. Dismissing it, I fell to reading my
purloined book again. Before I turned another page, however, another
startling detail leaped out at me: the figure of Mrs. Franklyn in the
Shadow was not living. It floated helplessly, like a doll or puppet
that has no life in it. It was both pathetic and dreadful.</p>

<p>Any one who sits in reverie thus, of course, may see similar
ridiculous pictures when the will no longer guides construction. The
incongruities of dreams are thus explained. I merely record the picture
as it came. That it remained by me for several days, just as vivid
dreams do, is neither here nor there. I did not allow myself to dwell
upon it. The curious thing, perhaps, is that from this moment I date my
inclination, though not yet my desire, to leave. I purposely say 'to
leave.'</p>

<p>I cannot quite remember when the word changed to that aggressive,
frantic thing which is escape.</p>

<h3>Chapter V</h3>

<p>We were left delightfully to ourselves in this pretentious country
mansion with the soul of a villa. Frances took up her painting again,
and, the weather being propitious, spent hours out of doors, sketching
flowers, trees and nooks of woodland, garden, even the house itself
where bits of it peered suggestively across the orchards. Mrs. Franklyn
seemed always busy about something or other, and never interfered with
us except to propose motoring, tea in another part of the lawn, and so
forth. She flitted everywhere, preoccupied, yet apparently doing
nothing. The house engulfed her rather. No visitor called. For one
thing, she was not supposed to be back from abroad yet; and for
another, I think, the neighbourhood--her husband's neighbourhood--was
puzzled by her sudden cessation from good works. Brigades and
temperance societies did not ask to hold their meetings in the big
hall, and the vicar arranged the school-treats in another's field
without explanation. The full-length portrait in the dining-room, and
the presence of the housekeeper with the 'burnt' backhair, indeed, were
the only reminders of the man who once had lived here. Mrs. Marsh
retained her place in silence, well-paid sinecure as it doubtless was,
yet with no hint of that suppressed disapproval one might have expected
from her. Indeed there was nothing positive to disapprove, since
nothing 'worldly' entered grounds or building. In her master's lifetime
she had been another 'brand snatched from the burning,' and it had then
been her custom to give vociferous 'testimony' at the revival meetings
where he adorned the platform and led in streams of prayer. I saw her
sometimes on the stairs, hovering, wandering, half-watching and
half-listening, and the idea came to me once that this woman somehow
formed a link with the departed influence of her bigoted employer. She,
alone among us, belonged to the house, and looked at home there. When I
saw her talking--oh, with such correct and respectful mien--to Mrs.
Franklyn, I had the feeling that for all her unaggressive attitude, she
yet exerted some influence that sought to make her mistress stay in the
building for ever--live there. She would prevent her escape, prevent
'getting it straight again,' thwart somehow her will to freedom, if she
could. The idea in me was of the most fleeting kind. But another time,
when I came down late at night to get a book from the library
ante-chamber, and found her sitting in the hall--alone--the impression
left upon me was the reverse of fleeting. I can never forget the vivid,
disagreeable effect it produced upon me. What was she doing there at
half-past eleven at night, all alone in the darkness? She was sitting
upright, stiff, in a big chair below the clock. It gave me a turn. It
was so incongruous and odd. She rose quietly as I turned the corner of
the stairs, and asked me respectfully, her eyes cast down as usual,
whether I had finished with the library, so that she might lock up.
There was no more to it than that; but the picture stayed with
me--unpleasantly.</p>

<p>These various impressions came to me at odd moments, of course, and
not in a single sequence as I now relate them. I was hard at work
before three days were past, not writing, as explained, but reading,
making notes, and gathering material from the library for future use.
It was in chance moments that these curious flashes came, catching me
unawares with a touch of surprise that sometimes made me start. For
they proved that my under-mind was still conscious of the Shadow, and
that far away out of sight lay the cause of it that left me with a
vague unrest, unsettled, seeking to 'nest' in a place that did not want
me. Only when this deeper part knows harmony, perhaps, can good brain
work result, and my inability to write was thus explained.</p>

<p>Certainly, I was always seeking for something here I could not
find--an explanation that continually evaded me. Nothing but these
trivial hints offered themselves. Lumped together, however, they had
the effect of defining the Shadow a little. I became more and more
aware of its very real existence. And, if I have made little mention of
Frances and my hostess in this connection, it is because they
contributed at first little or nothing towards the discovery of what
this story tries to tell. Our life was wholly external, normal, quiet,
and uneventful; conversation banal--Mrs. Franklyn's conversation in
particular. They said nothing that suggested revelation.</p>

<p>Both were in this Shadow, and both knew that they were in it, but
neither betrayed by word or act a hint of interpretation. They talked
privately, no doubt, but of that I can report no details.</p>

<p>And so it was that, after ten days of a very commonplace visit, I
found myself looking straight into the face of a Strangeness that
defied capture at close quarters. 'There's something here that never
happens,' were the words that rose in my mind, 'and that's why none of
us can speak of it.'</p>

<p>And as I looked out of the window and watched the vulgar blackbirds,
with toes turned in, boring out their worms, I realised sharply that
even they, as indeed everything large and small in the house and
grounds, shared this strangeness, and were twisted out of normal
appearance because of it. Life, as expressed in the entire place, was
crumpled, dwarfed, emasculated. God's meanings here were crippled, His
love of joy was stunted. Nothing in the garden danced or sang.</p>

<p>There was hate in it. 'The Shadow,' my thought hurried on to
completion, 'is a manifestation of hate; and hate is the Devil.' And
then I sat back frightened in my chair, for I knew that I had partly
found the truth.</p>

<p>Leaving my books I went out into the open. The sky was overcast, yet
the day by no means gloomy, for a soft, diffused light oozed through
the clouds and turned all things warm and almost summery. But I saw the
grounds now in their nakedness because I understood. Hate means strife,
and the two together weave the robe that terror wears. Having no
so-called religious beliefs myself, nor belonging to any set of dogmas
called a creed, I could stand outside these feelings and observe. Yet
they soaked into me sufficiently for me to grasp sympathetically what
others, with more cabined souls (I flattered myself), might feel. That
picture in the dining-room stalked everywhere, hid behind every tree,
peered down upon me from the peaked ugliness of the bourgeois towers,
and left the impress of its powerful hand upon every bed of flowers.
'You must not do this, you must not do that,' went past me through the
air. 'You must not leave these narrow paths,' said the rigid iron
railings of black. 'You shall not walk here,' was written on the lawns.
'Keep to the steps,' 'Don't pick the flowers; make no noise of
laughter, singing, dancing,' was placarded all over the rose-garden,
and 'Trespassers will be--not prosecuted but--destroyed' hung from the
crest of monkey-tree and holly. Guarding the ends of each artificial
terrace stood gaunt, implacable policemen, warders, gaolers. 'Come with
us,' they chanted, 'or be damned eternally.'</p>

<p>I remember feeling quite pleased with myself that I had discovered
this obvious explanation of the prison-feeling the place breathed out.
That the posthumous influence of heavy old Samuel Franklyn might be an
inadequate solution did not occur to me. By 'getting the place straight
again,' his widow, of course, meant forgetting the glamour of fear and
foreboding his depressing creed had temporarily forced upon her; and
Frances, delicately-minded being, did not speak of it because it was
the influence of the man her friend had loved. I felt lighter; a load
was lifted from me. 'To trace the unfamiliar to the familiar,' came
back a sentence I had read somewhere, 'is to understand.' It was a real
relief. I could talk with Frances now, even with my hostess, no danger
of treading clumsily. For the key was in my hands. I might even help to
dissipate the Shadow, 'to get it straight again.' It seemed, perhaps,
our long invitation was explained!</p>

<p>I went into the house laughing--at myself a little. 'Perhaps after
all the artist's outlook, with no hard and fast dogmas, is as narrow as
the others! How small humanity is! And why is there no possible and
true combination of all outlooks?'</p>

<p>The feeling of 'unsettling' was very strong in me just then, in
spite of my big discovery which was to clear everything up. And at the
moment I ran into Frances on the stairs, with a portfolio of sketches
under her arm.</p>

<p>It came across me then abruptly that, although she had worked a
great deal since we came, she had shown me nothing. It struck me
suddenly as odd, unnatural. The way she tried to pass me now confirmed
my new-born suspicion that--well, that her results were hardly what
they ought to be.</p>

<p>'Stand and deliver!' I laughed, stepping in front of her. 'I've seen
nothing you've done since you've been here, and as a rule you show me
all your things. I believe they are atrocious and degrading!' Then my
laughter froze.</p>

<p>She made a sly gesture to slip past me, and I almost decided to let
her go, for the expression that flashed across her face shocked me. She
looked uncomfortable and ashamed; the colour came and went a moment in
he cheeks, making me think of a child detected in some secret
naughtiness. It was almost fear.</p>

<p>'It's because they're not finished then?' I said, dropping the tone
of banter, 'or because they're too good for me to understand?' For my
criticism of painting, she told me, was crude and ignorant sometimes.
'But you'll let me see them later, won't you?'</p>

<p>Frances, however, did not take the way of escape I offered. She
changed her mind. She drew the portfolio from beneath her arm instead.
'You can see them if you really want to, Bill,' she said quietly, and
her tone reminded me of a nurse who says to a boy just grown out of
childhood, 'you are old enough now to look upon horror and
ugliness--only I don't advise it.'</p>

<p>'I do want to,' I said, and made to go downstairs with her. But,
instead, she said in the same low voice as before, 'Come up to my room,
we shall be undisturbed there.' So I guessed that she had been on her
way to show the paintings to our hostess, but did not care for us all
three to see them together. My mind worked furiously.</p>

<p>'Mabel asked me to do them,' she explained in a tone of submissive
horror, once the door was shut, 'in fact, she begged it of me. You know
how persistent she is in her quiet way. I--er--had to.'</p>

<p>She flushed and opened the portfolio on the little table by the
window, standing behind me as I turned the sketches over-sketches of
the grounds and trees and garden. In the first moment of 'inspection,
however, I did not take in clearly why my sister's sense of modesty had
been offended. For my attention flashed a second elsewhere. Another bit
of the puzzle had dropped into place, defining still further the nature
of what I called 'the Shadow.' Mrs. Franklyn, I now remembered, has
suggested to me in the library that I might perhaps write something
about the place, and I had taken it for one of her banal sentences and
paid no further attention. I realised now that it was said in earnest.
She wanted our interpretations, as expressed in our respective
'talents,' painting and writing. Her invitation was explained. She left
us to ourselves on purpose.</p>

<p>'I should like to tear them up,' Frances was whispering behind me
with a shudder, 'only I promised--' She hesitated a moment.</p>

<p>'Promised not to?' I asked with a queer feeling of distress, my eyes
glued to the papers.</p>

<p>'Promised always to show them to her first,' she finished so low I
barely caught it.</p>

<p>I have no intuitive, immediate grasp of the value of paintings;
results come to me slowly, and though every one believes his own
judgment to be good, I dare not claim that mine is worth more than that
of any other layman, Frances had too often convicted me of gross
ignorance and error. I can only say that I examined these sketches with
a feeling of amazement that contained revulsion, if not actually horror
and disgust. They were outrageous. I felt hot for my sister, and it was
a relief to know she had moved across the room on some pretence or
other, and did not examine them with me. Her talent, of course, is
mediocre, yet she has her moments of inspiration--moments, that is to
say, when a view of Beauty not normally her own flames divinely through
her. And these interpretations struck me forcibly as being thus
'inspired'--not her own. They were uncommonly well done; they were also
atrocious. The meaning in them, however, was never more than hinted.
There the unholy skill and power came in: they suggested so abominably,
leaving most to the imagination. To find such significance in a
bourgeois villa garden, and to interpret it with such delicate yet
legible certainty, was a kind of symbolism that was sinister, even
diabolical. The delicacy was her own, but the point of view was
another's.</p>

<p>And the word that rose in my mind was not the gross description of
'impure,' but the more fundamental qualification--'un-pure.'</p>

<p>In silence I turned the sketches over one by one, as a boy hurries
through the pages of an evil book lest he be caught.</p>

<p>'What does Mabel do with them?' I asked presently in a low tone, as
I neared the end. 'Does she keep them?'</p>

<p>'She makes notes about them in a book and then destroys them,' was
the reply from the end of the room. I heard a sigh of relief. 'I'm glad
you've seen them, Bill. I wanted you to--but was afraid to show them.
You understand?'</p>

<p>'I understand,' was my reply, though it was not a question intended
to be answered. All I understood really was that Mabel's mind was as
sweet and pure as my sister's, and that she had some good reason for
what she did. She destroyed the sketches, but first made notes! It was
an interpretation of the place she sought. Brother-like, I felt
resentment, though, that Frances should waste her time and talent, when
she might be doing work that she could sell. Naturally, I felt other
things as well...</p>

<p>'Mabel pays me five guineas for each one,' I heard. 'Absolutely
insists.'</p>

<p>I stared at her stupidly a moment, bereft of speech or wit. 'I must
either accept, or go away,' she went on calmly, but a little white.
'I've tried everything. There was a scene the third day I was
here--when I showed her my first result. I wanted to write to you, but
hesitated--'</p>

<p>'It's unintentional, then, on your part--forgive my asking it,
Frances, dear?' I blundered, hardly knowing what to think or say.
'Between the lines' of her letter came back to me. 'I mean, you make
the sketches in your ordinary way and--the result comes out of itself,
so to speak?'</p>

<p>She nodded, throwing her hands out like a Frenchman. 'We needn't
keep the money for ourselves, Bill. We can give it away, but--I must
either accept or leave,' and she repeated the shrugging gesture. She
sat down on the chair facing me, staring helplessly at the carpet.</p>

<p>'You say there was a scene?' I went on presently, 'She
insisted?'</p>

<p>'She begged me to continue,' my sister replied very quietly. 'She
thinks--that is, she has an idea or theory that there's something about
the place--something she can't get at quite.' Frances stammered badly.
She knew I did not encourage her wild theories.</p>

<p>'Something she feels--yes,' I helped her, more than curious.</p>

<p>'Oh, you know what I mean, Bill,' she said desperately. 'That the
place is saturated with some influence that she is herself too positive
or too stupid to interpret. She's trying to make herself negative and
receptive, as she calls it, but can't, of course, succeed. Haven't you
noticed how dull and impersonal and insipid she seems, as though she
had no personality? She thinks impressions will come to her that way.
But they don't--'</p>

<p>'Naturally.'</p>

<p>'So she's trying me--us--what she calls the sensitive and
impressionable artistic temperament. She says that until she is sure
exactly what this influence is, she can't fight it, turn it out, "get
the house straight", as she phrases it.</p>

<p>Remembering my own singular impressions, I felt more lenient than I
might otherwise have done. I tried to keep impatience out of my
voice.</p>

<p>'And this influence, what--whose is it?'</p>

<p>We used the pronoun that followed in the same breath, for I answered
my own question at the same moment as she did:</p>

<p>'His.' Our heads nodded involuntarily towards the floor, the
dining-room being directly underneath.</p>

<p>And my heart sank, my curiosity died away on the instant; I felt
bored. A commonplace haunted house was the last thing in the world to
amuse or interest me. The mere thought exasperated, with its
suggestions of imagination, overwrought nerves, hysteria, and the
rest.</p>

<p>Mingled with my other feelings was certainly disappointment. To see
a figure or feel a 'presence,' and report from day to day strange
incidents to each other would be a form of weariness I could never
tolerate.</p>

<p>'But really, Frances,' I said firmly, after a moment's pause, 'it's
too far-fetched, this explanation. A curse, you know, belongs to the
ghost stories of early Victorian days.' And only my positive conviction
that there was something after all worth discovering, and that it most
certainly was not this, prevented my suggesting that we terminate our
visit forthwith, or as soon as we decently could. 'This is not a
haunted house, whatever it is,' I concluded somewhat vehemently,
bringing my hand down upon her odious portfolio.</p>

<p>My sister's reply revived my curiosity sharply.</p>

<p>'I was waiting for you to say that. Mabel says exactly the same. He
is in it--but it's something more than that alone, something far bigger
and more complicated.' Her sentence seemed to indicate the sketches,
and though I caught the inference I did not take it up, having no
desire to discuss them with her just them indeed, if ever.</p>

<p>I merely stared at her and listened. Questions, I felt sure, would
be of little use. It was better she should say her thought in her own
way.</p>

<p>'He is one influence, the most recent,' she went on slowly, and
always very calmly, 'but there are others--deeper layers, as it
were--underneath. If his were the only one, something would happen. But
nothing ever does happen. The others hinder and prevent--as though each
were struggling to predominate.'</p>

<p>I had felt it already myself. The idea was rather horrible. I
shivered.</p>

<p>'That's what is so ugly about it--that nothing ever happens,' she
said. 'There is this endless anticipation--always on the dry edge of a
result that never materialises. It is torture. Mabel is at her wits'
end, you see. And when she begged me--what I felt about my sketches--I
mean--'</p>

<p>She stammered badly as before.</p>

<p>I stopped her. I had judged too hastily. That queer symbolism in her
paintings, pagan and yet not innocent, was, I understood, the result of
mixture. I did not pretend to understand, but at least I could be
patient. I consequently held my peace. We did talk on a little longer,
but it was more general talk that avoided successfully our hostess, the
paintings, wild theories, and him--until at length the emotion Frances
had hitherto so successfully kept under burst vehemently forth
again.</p>

<p>It had hidden between her calm sentences, as it had hidden between
the lines of her letter. It swept her now from head to foot, packed
tight in the thing she then said.</p>

<p>'Then, Bill, if it is not an ordinary haunted house,' she asked,
'what is it?'</p>

<p>The words were commonplace enough. The emotion was in the tone of
her voice that trembled; in the gesture she made, leaning forward and
clasping both hands upon her knees, and in the slight blanching of her
cheeks as her brave eyes asked the question and searched my own with
anxiety that bordered upon panic. In that moment she put herself under
my protection. I winced.</p>

<p>'And why,' she added, lowering her voice to a still and furtive
whisper, 'does nothing ever happen? If only,'--this with great
emphasis--'something would happen--break this awful tension--bring
relief. It's the waiting I cannot stand.' And she shivered all over as
she said it, a touch of wildness in her eyes.</p>

<p>I would have given much to have made a true and satisfactory answer.
My mind searched frantically for a moment, but in vain. There lay no
sufficient answer in me. I felt what she felt, though with differences.
No conclusive explanation lay within reach. Nothing happened. Eager as
I was to shoot the entire business into the rubbish heap where
ignorance and superstition discharge their poisonous weeds, I could not
honestly accomplish this. To treat Frances as a child, and merely
'explain away' would be to strain her confidence in my protection, so
affectionately claimed. It would further be dishonest to myself--weak,
besides--to deny that I had also felt the strain and tension even as
she did. While my mind continued searching, I returned her stare in
silence; and Frances then, with more honesty and insight than my own,
gave suddenly the answer herself--an answer whose truth and adequacy,
so far as they went, I could not readily gainsay:</p>

<p>'I think, Bill, because it is too big to happen here--to happen
anywhere, indeed, all at once--and too awful!'</p>

<p>To have tossed the sentence aside as nonsense, argued it away,
proved that it was really meaningless, would have been easy--at any
other time or in any other place; and, had the past week brought me
none of the vivid impressions it had brought me, this is doubtless what
I should have done. My narrowness again was proved. We understand in
others only what we have in ourselves. But her explanation, in a
measure, I knew was true. It hinted at the strife and struggle that my
notion of a Shadow had seemed to cover thinly.</p>

<p>'Perhaps,' I murmured lamely, waiting in vain for her to say more.
'But you said just now that you felt the thing was "in layers", as it
were. Do you mean each one--each influence--fighting for the upper
hand?'</p>

<p>I used her phraseology to conceal my own poverty. Terminology, after
all, was nothing, provided we could reach the idea itself.</p>

<p>Her eyes said yes. She had her clear conception, arrived at
independently, as was her way.</p>

<p>And, unlike her sex, she kept it clear, unsmothered by too many
words.</p>

<p>'One set of influences gets at me, another gets at you. It's
according to our temperaments, I think.' She glanced significantly at
the vile portfolio. 'Sometimes they are mixed--and therefore false.
There has always been in me, more than in you, the pagan thing,
perhaps, though never, thank God, like that.'</p>

<p>The frank confession of course invited my own, as it was meant to
do. Yet it was difficult to find the words.</p>

<p>'What I have felt in this place, Frances, I honestly can hardly tell
you, because--er--my impressions have not arranged themselves in any
definite form I can describe. The strife, the agony of vainly-sought
escape, and the unrest--a sort of prison atmosphere--this I have felt
at different times and with varying degrees of strength. But I find, as
yet, no final label to attach. I couldn't say pagan, Christian, or
anything like that, I mean, as you do. As with the blind and deaf, you
may have an intensification of certain senses denied to me, or even
another sense altogether in embryo--'</p>

<p>'Perhaps,' she stopped me, anxious to keep to the point, 'you feel
it as Mabel does. She feels the whole thing complete.'</p>

<p>'That also is possible,' I said very slowly. I was thinking behind
my words. Her odd remark that it was 'big and awful' came back upon me
as true. A vast sensation of distress and discomfort swept me suddenly.
Pity was in it, and a fierce contempt, a savage, bitter anger as well.
Fury against some sham authority was part of it.</p>

<p>'Frances,' I said, caught unawares, and dropping all pretence, 'what
in the world can it be?' I looked hard at her. For some minutes neither
of us spoke.</p>

<p>'Have you felt no desire to interpret it?' she asked presently,
'Mabel did suggest my writing something about the house,' was my reply,
'but I've felt nothing imperative. That sort of writing is not my line,
you know. My only feeling,' I added, noticing that she waited for more,
'is the impulse to explain, discover, get it out of me somehow, and so
get rid of it. Not by writing, though--as yet.' And again I repeated my
former question:</p>

<p>'What in the world do you think it is?' My voice had become
involuntarily hushed. There was awe in it.</p>

<p>Her answer, given with slow emphasis, brought back all my reserve:
the phraseology provoked me rather:--'Whatever it is, Bill, it is not
of God.'</p>

<p>I got up to go downstairs. I believe I shrugged my shoulders. 'Would
you like to leave, Frances? Shall we go back to town?' I suggested this
at the door, and hearing no immediate reply, I turned back to look.
Frances was sitting with her head bowed over and buried in her hands.
The attitude horribly suggested tears. No woman, I realised, can keep
back the pressure of strong emotion as long as Frances had done,
without ending in a fluid collapse. I waited a moment uneasily, longing
to comfort, yet afraid to act--and in this way discovered the existence
of the appalling emotion in myself, hitherto but half guessed. At all
costs a scene must be prevented: it would involve such exaggeration and
over-statement. Brutally, such is the weakness of the ordinary man, I
turned the handle to go out, but my sister then raised her head. The
sunlight caught her face, framed untidily in its auburn hair, and I saw
her wonderful expression with a start. Pity, tenderness and sympathy
shone in it like a flame. It was undeniable. There shone through all
her features the imperishable love and yearning to sacrifice self for
others which I have seen in only one type of human being. It was the
great mother look.</p>

<p>'We must stay by Mabel and help her get it straight,' she whispered,
making the decision for us both.</p>

<p>I murmured agreement. Abashed and half ashamed, I stole softly from
the room and went out into the grounds. And the first thing clearly
realised when alone was this: that the long scene between us was
without definite result. The exchange of confidence was really nothing
but hints and vague suggestion. We had decided to stay, but it was a
negative decision not to leave rather than a positive action. All our
words and questions, our guesses, inferences, explanations, our most
subtle allusions and insinuations, even the odious paintings
themselves, were without definite result. Nothing had happened.</p>

<h3>Chapter VI</h3>

<p>And instinctively, once alone, I made for the places where she had
painted her extraordinary pictures; I tried to see what she had seen.
Perhaps, now that she had opened my mind to another view, I should be
sensitive to some similar interpretation--and possibly by way of
literary expression. If I were to write about the place, I asked
myself, how should I treat it? I deliberately invited an interpretation
in the way that came easiest to me--writing.</p>

<p>But in this case there came no such revelation. Looking closely at
the trees and flowers, the bits of lawn and terrace, the rose-garden
and corner of the house where the flaming creeper hung so thickly, I
discovered nothing of the odious, unpure thing her colour and grouping
had unconsciously revealed. At first, that is, I discovered nothing.
The reality stood there, commonplace and ugly, side by side with her
distorted version of it that lay in my mind. It seemed incredible. I
tried to force it, but in vain. My imagination, ploughed less deeply
than hers, or to another pattern, grew different seed. Where I saw the
gross soul of an overgrown suburban garden, inspired by the spirit of a
vulgar, rich revivalist who loved to preach damnation, she saw this
rush of pagan liberty and joy, this strange licence of primitive flesh
which, tainted by the other, produced the adulterated, vile result.</p>

<p>Certain things, however, gradually then became apparent, forcing
themselves upon me, willy nilly. They came slowly, but overwhelmingly.
Not that facts had changed, or natural details altered in the
grounds--this was impossible--but that I noticed for the first time
various aspects I had not noticed before--trivial enough, yet for me,
just then, significant. Some I remembered from previous days; others I
saw now as I wandered to and fro, uneasy, uncomfortable,--almost, it
seemed, watched by some one who took note of my impressions. The
details were so foolish, the total result so formidable. I was half
aware that others tried hard to make me see. It was deliberate.</p>

<p>My sister's phrase, 'one layer got at me, another gets at you,'
flashed, undesired, upon me.</p>

<p>For I saw, as with the eyes of a child, what I can only call a
goblin garden--house, grounds, trees, and flowers belonged to a goblin
world that children enter through the pages of their fairy tales. And
what made me first aware of it was the whisper of the wind behind me,
so that I turned with a sudden start, feeling that something had moved
closer. An old ash tree, ugly and ungainly, had been artificially
trained to form an arbour at one end of the terrace that was a tennis
lawn, and the leaves of it now went rustling together, swishing as they
rose and fell. I looked at the ash tree, and felt as though I had
passed that moment between doors into this goblin garden that crouched
behind the real one. Below, at a deeper layer perhaps, lay hidden the
one my sister had entered.</p>

<p>To deal with my own, however, I call it goblin, because an odd
aspect of the quaint in it yet never quite achieved the picturesque.
Grotesque, probably, is the truer word, for everywhere I noticed, and
for the first time, this slight alteration of the natural due either to
the exaggeration of some detail, or to its suppression, generally, I
think, to the latter. Life everywhere appeared to me as blocked from
the full delivery of its sweet and lovely message. Some counter
influence stopped it--suppression; or sent it awry--exaggeration. The
house itself, mere expression, of course, of a narrow, limited mind,
was sheer ugliness; it required no further explanation. With the
grounds and garden, so far as shape and general plan were concerned,
this was also true; but that trees and flowers and other natural
details should share the same deficiency perplexed my logical soul, and
even dismayed it. I stood and stared, then moved about, and stood and
stared again. Everywhere was this mockery of a sinister, unfinished
aspect. I sought in vain to recover my normal point of view. My mind
had found this goblin garden and wandered to and fro in it, unable to
escape.</p>

<p>The change was in myself, of course, and so trivial were the details
which illustrated it, that they sound absurd, thus mentioned one by
one. For me, they proved it, is all I can affirm. The goblin touch lay
plainly everywhere: in the forms of the trees, planted at neat
intervals along the lawns; in this twisted ash that rustled just behind
me; in the shadow of the gloomy wellingtonias, whose sweeping skirts
obscured the grass; but especially, I noticed, in the tops and crests
of them. For here, the delicate, graceful curves of last year's growth
seemed to shrink back into themselves. None of them pointed upwards.
Their life had failed and turned aside just when it should have become
triumphant. The character of a tree reveals itself chiefly at the
extremities, and it was precisely here that they all drooped and
achieved this hint of goblin distortion--in the growth, that is, of the
last few years. What ought to have been fairy, joyful, natural, was
instead uncomely to the verge of the grotesque. Spontaneous expression
was arrested. My mind perceived a goblin garden, and was caught in it.
The place grimaced at me.</p>

<p>With the flowers it was similar, though far more difficult to detect
in detail for description. I saw the smaller vegetable growth as
impish, half-malicious. Even the terraces sloped ill, as though their
ends had sagged since they had been so lavishily constructed; their
varying angles gave a queerly bewildering aspect to their sequence that
was unpleasant to the eye. One might wander among their deceptive
lengths and get lost--lost among open terraces!--with the house quite
close at hand. Unhomely seemed the entire garden, unable to give
repose, restlessness in it everywhere, almost strife, and discord
certainly.</p>

<p>Moreover, the garden grew into the house, the house into the garden,
and in both was this idea of resistance to the natural--the spirit that
says No to joy. All over it I was aware of the effort to achieve
another end, the struggle to burst forth and escape into free,
spontaneous expression that should be happy and natural, yet the effort
for ever frustrated by the weight of this dark shadow that rendered it
abortive. Life crawled aside into a channel that was a cul-de-sac, then
turned horribly upon itself. Instead of blossom and fruit, there were
weeds. This approach of life I was conscious of--then dismal failure.
There was no fulfilment. Nothing happened.</p>

<p>And so, through this singular mood, I came a little nearer to
understand the unpure thing that had stammered out into expression
through my sister's talent. For the unpure is merely negative; it has
no existence; it is but the cramped expression of what is true,
stammering its way brokenly over false boundaries that seek to limit
and confine. Great, full expression of anything is pure, whereas here
was only the incomplete, unfinished, and therefore ugly. There was a
strife and pain and desire to escape. I found myself shrinking from
house and grounds as one shrinks from the touch of the mentally
arrested, those in whom life has turned awry. There was almost
mutilation in it.</p>

<p>Past items, too, now flocked to confirm this feeling that I walked,
liberty captured and half-maimed, in a monstrous garden. I remembered
days of rain that refreshed the countryside, but left these grounds,
cracked with the summer heat, unsatisfied and thirsty; and how the big
winds, that cleaned the woods and fields elsewhere, crawled here with
difficulty through the dense foliage that protected The Towers from the
North and West and East. They were ineffective, sluggish currents.
There was no real wind. Nothing happened. I began to realise--far more
clearly than in my sister's fanciful explanation about 'layers'--that
here were many contrary influences at work, mutually destructive of one
another. House and grounds were not haunted merely; they were the arena
of past thinking and feeling, perhaps of terrible, impure beliefs, each
striving to suppress the others, yet no one of them achieving supremacy
because no one of them was strong enough, no one of them was true.
Each, moreover, tried to win me over, though only one was able to reach
my mind at all. For some obscure reason--possibly because my
temperament had a natural bias towards the grotesque--it was the goblin
layer. With me, it was the line of least resistance...</p>

<p>In my own thoughts this 'goblin garden' revealed, of course, merely
my personal interpretation. I felt now objectively what long ago my
mind had felt subjectively. My work, essential sign of spontaneous life
with me, had stopped dead; production had become impossible.</p>

<p>I stood now considerably closer to the cause of this sterility. The
Cause, rather, turned bolder, had stepped insolently nearer. Nothing
happened anywhere; house, garden, mind alike were barren, abortive,
torn by the strife of frustrated impulse, ugly, hateful, sinful. Yet
behind it all was still the desire of life--desire to
escape--accomplish. Hope--an intolerable hope--I became startlingly
aware--crowned torture.</p>

<p>And, realising this, though in some part of me where Reason lost her
hold, there rose upon me then another and a darker thing that caught me
by the throat and made me shrink with a sense of revulsion that touched
actual loathing. I knew instantly whence it came, this wave of
abhorrence and disgust, for even while I saw red and felt revolt rise
in me, it seemed that I grew partially aware of the layer next below
the goblin. I perceived the existence of this deeper stratum. One
opened the way for the other, as it were. There were so many, yet all
inter-related; to admit one was to clear the way for all. If I lingered
I should be caught--horribly. They struggled with such violence for
supremacy among themselves, however, that this latest uprising was
instantly smothered and crushed back, though not before a glimpse had
been revealed to me, and the redness in my thoughts transferred itself
to colour my surroundings thickly and appallingly--with blood. This
lurid aspect drenched the garden, smeared the terraces, lent to the
very soil a tinge as of sacrificial rites, that choked the breath in
me, while it seemed to fix me to the earth my feet so longed to leave.
It was so revolting that at the same time I felt a dreadful curiosity
as of fascination--I wished to stay. Between these contrary impulses I
think I actually reeled a moment, transfixed by a fascination of the
Awful. Through the lighter goblin veil I felt myself sinking down,
down, down into this turgid layer that was so much more violent and so
much more ancient. The upper layer, indeed, seemed fairy by comparison
with this terror born of the lust for blood, thick with the anguish of
human sacrificial victims.</p>

<p>Upper! Then I was already sinking; my feet were caught; I was
actually in it! What atavistic strain, hidden deep within me, had been
touched into vile response, giving this flash of intuitive
comprehension, I cannot say. The coatings laid on by civilisation are
probably thin enough in all of us. I made a supreme effort. The sun and
wind came back. I could almost swear I opened my eyes. Something very
atrocious surged back into the depths, carrying with it a thought of
tangled woods, of big stones standing in a circle, motionless, white
figures, the one form bound with ropes, and the ghastly gleam of the
knife. Like smoke upon a battlefield, it rolled away...</p>

<p>I was standing on the gravel path below the second terrace when the
familiar goblin garden danced back again, doubly grotesque now, doubly
mocking, yet, by way of contrast, almost welcome. My glimpse into the
depths was momentary, it seems, and had passed utterly away.</p>

<p>The common world rushed back with a sense of glad relief, yet
ominous now for ever, I felt, for the knowledge of what its past had
built upon. In street, in theatre, in the festivities of friends, in
music-room or playing-field, even indeed in church--how could the
memory of what I had seen and felt leave its hideous trace? The very
structure of my Thought, it seemed to me, was stained.</p>

<p>What has been thought by others can never be obliterated
until...</p>

<p>With a start my reverie broke and fled, scattered by a violent sound
that I recognised for the first time in my life as wholly desirable.
The returning motor meant that my hostess was back.</p>

<p>Yet, so urgent had been my temporary obsession, that my first
presentation of her was--well, not as I knew her now. Floating along
with a face of anguished torture I saw Mabel, a mere effigy captured by
others' thinking, pass down into those depths of fire and blood that
only just had closed beneath my feet. She dipped away. She vanished,
her fading eyes turned to the last towards some saviour who had failed
her. And that strange intolerable hope was in her face.</p>

<p>The mystery of the place was pretty thick about me just then. It was
the fall of dusk, and the ghost of slanting sunshine was as unreal as
though badly painted. The garden stood at attention all about me. I
cannot explain it, but I can tell it, I think, exactly as it happened,
for it remains vivid in me for ever--that, for the first time,
something almost happened, myself apparently the combining link through
which it pressed towards delivery:</p>

<p>I had already turned towards the house. In my mind were
pictures--not actual thoughts--of the motor, tea on the verandah, my
sister, Mabel--when there came behind me this tumultuous, awful
rush--as I left the garden. The ugliness, the pain, the striving to
escape, the whole negative and suppressed agony that was the Place,
focused that second into a concentrated effort to produce a result. It
was a blinding tempest of long-frustrated desire that heaved at me,
surging appallingly behind me like an anguished mob. I was in the act
of crossing the frontier into my normal self again, when it came,
catching fearfully at my skirts. I might use an entire dictionary of
descriptive adjectives yet come no nearer to it than this--the
conception of a huge assemblage determined to escape with me, or to
snatch me back among themselves. My legs trembled for an instant, and I
caught my breath--then turned and ran as fast as possible up the ugly
terraces.</p>

<p>At the same instant, as though the clanging of an iron gate cut
short the unfinished phrase, I thought the beginning of an awful
thing:</p>

<p>'The Damned...'</p>

<p>Like this it rushed after me from that goblin garden that had sought
to keep me:</p>

<p>'The Damned!'</p>

<p>For there was sound in it. I know full well it was subjective, not
actually heard at all; yet somehow sound was in it--a great volume,
roaring and booming thunderously, far away, and below me. The sentence
dipped back into the depths that gave it birth, unfinished. Its
completion was prevented. As usual, nothing happened. But it drove
behind me like a hurricane as I ran towards the house, and the sound of
it I can only liken to those terrible undertones you may hear standing
beside Niagara. They lie behind the mere crash of the falling flood,
within it somehow, not audible to all--felt rather than definitely
heard.</p>

<p>It seemed to echo back from the surface of those sagging terraces as
I flew across their sloping ends, for it was somehow underneath them.
It was in the rustle of the wind that stirred the skirts of the
drooping wellingtonias. The beds of formal flowers passed it on to the
creepers, red as blood, that crept over the unsightly building. Into
the structure of the vulgar and forbidding house it sank away; The
Towers took it home. The uncomely doors and windows seemed almost like
mouths that had uttered the words themselves, and on the upper floors
at that very moment I saw two maids in the act of closing them
again.</p>

<p>And on the verandah, as I arrived breathless, and shaken in my soul,
Frances and Mabel, standing by the tea-table, looked up to greet me. In
the faces of both were clearly legible the signs of shock. They watched
me coming, yet so full of their own distress that they hardly noticed
the state in which I came. In the face of my hostess, however, I read
another and a bigger thing than in the face of Frances. Mabel knew. She
had experienced what I had experienced. She had heard that awful
sentence I had heard but heard it not for the first time; heard it,
moreover, I verily believe, complete and to its dreadful end.</p>

<p>'Bill, did you hear that curious noise just now?' Frances asked it
sharply before I could say a word. Her manner was confused; she looked
straight at me; and there was a tremor in her voice she could not
hide.</p>

<p>'There's wind about,' I said, 'wind in the trees and sweeping round
the walls. It's risen rather suddenly.' My voice faltered rather.</p>

<p>'No. It wasn't wind,' she insisted, with a significance meant for me
alone, but badly hidden. 'It was more like distant thunder, we thought.
How you ran too!' she added. 'What a pace you came across the
terraces!'</p>

<p>I knew instantly from the way she said it that they both had already
heard the sound before and were anxious to know if I had heard it, and
how. My interpretation was what they sought.</p>

<p>'It was a curiously deep sound, I admit. It may have been big guns
at sea,' I suggested, 'forts or cruisers practising. The coast isn't so
very far, and with the wind in the right direction--'</p>

<p>The expression on Mabel's face stopped me dead.</p>

<p>'Like huge doors closing,' she said softly in her colourless voice,
'enormous metal doors shutting against a mass of people clamouring to
get out.' The gravity, the note of hopelessness in her tones, was
shocking.</p>

<p>Frances had gone into the house the instant Mabel began to speak.
'I'm cold,' she had said; 'I think I'll get a shawl.' Mabel and I were
alone. I believe it was the first time we had been really alone since I
arrived. She looked up from the teacups, fixing her pallid eyes on
mine. She had made a question of the sentence.</p>

<p>'You hear it like that?' I asked innocently. I purposely used the
present tense.</p>

<p>She changed her stare from one eye to the other; it was absolutely
expressionless. My sister's step sounded on the floor of the room
behind us.</p>

<p>'If only--' Mabel began, then stopped, and my own feelings leaping
out instinctively completed the sentence I felt was in her mind:</p>

<p>'--something would happen.'</p>

<p>She instantly corrected me. I had caught her thought, yet somehow
phrased it wrongly.</p>

<p>'We could escape!' She lowered her tone a little, saying it
hurriedly. The 'we' amazed and horrified me; but something in her voice
and manner struck me utterly dumb. There was ice and terror in it. It
was a dying woman speaking--a lost and hopeless soul.</p>

<p>In that atrocious moment I hardly noticed what was said exactly, but
I remember that my sister returned with a grey shawl about her
shoulders, and that Mabel said, in her ordinary voice again, 'It is
chilly, yes; let's have tea inside,' and that two maids, one of them
the grenadier, speedily carried the loaded trays into the morning-room
and put a match to the logs in the great open fireplace. It was, after
all, foolish to risk the sharp evening air, for dusk was falling
steadily, and even the sunshine of the day just fading could not turn
autumn into summer. I was the last to come in. Just as I left the
verandah a large black bird swooped down in front of me past the
pillars; it dropped from overhead, swerved abruptly to one side as it
caught sight of me, and flapped heavily towards the shrubberies on the
left of the terraces, where it disappeared into the gloom. It flew very
low, very close. And it startled me, I think because in some way it
seemed like my Shadow materialised--as though the dark horror that was
rising everywhere from house and garden, then settling back so thickly
yet so imperceptibly upon us all, were incarnated in that whirring
creature that passed between the daylight and the coming night.</p>

<p>I stood a moment, wondering if it would appear again, before I
followed the others indoors, and as I was in the act of closing the
windows after me, I caught a glimpse of a figure on the lawn. It was
some distance away, on the other side of the shrubberies, in fact where
the bird had vanished. But in spite of the twilight that half
magnified, half obscured it, the identity was unmistakable. I knew the
housekeeper's stiff walk too well to be deceived. 'Mrs. Marsh taking
the air,' I said to myself. I felt the necessity of saying it, and I
wondered why she was doing so at this particular hour. If I had other
thoughts they were so vague, and so quickly and utterly suppressed,
that I cannot recall them sufficiently to relate them here.</p>

<p>And, once indoors, it was to be expected that there would come
explanation, discussion, conversation, at any rate, regarding the
singular noise and its cause, some uttered evidence of the mood that
had been strong enough to drive us all inside. Yet there was none. Each
of us purposely, and with various skill, ignored it. We talked little,
and when we did it was of anything in the world but that. Personally, I
experienced a touch of that same bewilderment which had come over me
during my first talk with Frances on the evening of my arrival, for I
recall now the acute tension, and the hope, yet dread, that one or
other of us must sooner or later introduce the subject. It did not
happen, however; no reference was made to it even remotely. It was the
presence of Mabel, I felt positive, that prohibited. As soon might we
have discussed Death in the bedroom of a dying woman.</p>

<p>The only scrap of conversation I remember, where all was ordinary
and commonplace, was when Mabel spoke casually to the grenadier asking
why Mrs. Marsh had omitted to do something or other--what it was I
forget--and that the maid replied respectfully that 'Mrs. Marsh was
very sorry, but her 'and still pained her.' I enquired, though so
casually that I scarcely know what prompted the words, whether she had
injured herself severely, and the reply, 'She upset a lamp and burnt
herself,' was said in a tone that made me feel my curiosity was
indiscreet, 'but she always has an excuse for not doing things she
ought to do.' The little bit of conversation remained with me, and I
remember particularly the quick way Frances interrupted and turned the
talk upon the delinquencies of servants in general, telling incidents
of her own at our flat with a volubility that perhaps seemed forced,
and that certainly did not encourage general talk as it may have been
intended to do. We lapsed into silence immediately she finished.</p>

<p>But for all our care and all our calculated silence, each knew that
something had, in these last moments, come very close; it had brushed
us in passing; it had retired; and I am inclined to think now that the
large dark thing I saw, riding the dusk, probably bird of prey, was in
some sense a symbol of it in my mind--that actually there had been no
bird at all, I mean, but that my mood of apprehension and dismay had
formed the vivid picture in my thoughts. It had swept past us, it had
retreated, but it was now, at this moment, in hiding very close. And it
was watching us.</p>

<p>Perhaps, too, it was mere coincidence that I encountered Mrs. Marsh,
his housekeeper, several times that evening in the short interval
between tea and dinner, and that on each occasion the sight of this
gaunt, half-saturnine woman fed my prejudice against her. Once, on my
way to the telephone, I ran into her just where the passage is somewhat
jammed by a square table carrying the Chinese gong, a grandfather's
clock and a box of croquet mallets. We both gave way, then both
advanced, then again gave way--simultaneously. It seemed, impossible to
pass. We stepped with decision to the same side, finally colliding in
the middle, while saying those futile little things, half apology, half
excuse, that are inevitable at such times. In the end she stood upright
against the wall for me to pass, taking her place against the very door
I wished to open. It was ludicrous.</p>

<p>'Excuse me--I was just going in--to telephone,' I explained. And she
sidled off, murmuring apologies, but opening the door for me while she
did so. Our hands met a moment on the handle.</p>

<p>There was a second's awkwardness--it was too stupid. I remembered
her injury, and by way of something to say, I enquired after it. She
thanked me; it was entirely healed now, but it might have been much
worse; and there was something about the 'mercy of the Lord' that I
didn't quite catch. While telephoning, however--a London call, and my
attention focused on it--I realised sharply that this was the first
time I had spoken with her; also, that I had--touched her.</p>

<p>It happened to be a Sunday, and the lines were clear. I got my
connection quickly, and the incident was forgotten while my thoughts
went up to London. On my way upstairs, then, the woman came back into
my mind, so that I recalled other things about her--how she seemed all
over the house, in unlikely places often; how I had caught her sitting
in the hall alone that night; how she was for ever coming and going
with her lugubrious visage and that untidy hair at the back that had
made me laugh three years ago with the idea that it looked singed or
burnt; and how the impression on my first arrival at The Towers was
that this woman somehow kept alive, though its evidence was outwardly
suppressed, the influence of her late employer and of his sombre
teachings. Somewhere with her was associated the idea of punishment,
vindictiveness, revenge. I remembered again suddenly my odd notion that
she sought to keep her present mistress here, a prisoner in this bleak
and comfortless house, and that really, in spite of her obsequious
silence, she was intensely opposed to the change of thought that had
reclaimed Mabel to a happier view of life.</p>

<p>All this in a passing second flashed in review before me, and I
discovered, or at any rate reconstructed, the real Mrs. Marsh. She was
decidedly in the Shadow. More, she stood in the forefront of it,
stealthily leading an assault, as it were, against The Towers and its
occupants, as though, consciously or unconsciously, she laboured
incessantly to this hateful end.</p>

<p>I can only judge that some state of nervousness in me permitted the
series of insignificant thoughts to assume this dramatic shape, and
that what had gone before prepared the way and led her up at the head
of so formidable a procession. I relate it exactly as it came to me. My
nerves were doubtless somewhat on edge by now. Otherwise I should
hardly have been a prey to the exaggeration at all. I seemed open to so
many strange, impressions.</p>

<p>Nothing else, perhaps, can explain my ridiculous conversation with
her, when, for the third time that evening, I came suddenly upon the
woman half-way down the stairs, standing by an open window as if in the
act of listening. She was dressed in black, a black shawl over her
square shoulders and black gloves on her big, broad hands. Two black
objects, prayerbooks apparently, she clasped, and on her head she wore
a bonnet with shaking beads of jet. At first I did not know her, as I
came running down upon her from the landing; it was only when she stood
aside to let me pass that I saw her profile against the tapestry and
recognised Mrs. Marsh. And to catch her on the front stairs, dressed
like this, struck me as incongruous--impertinent. I paused in my
dangerous descent. Through the opened window came the sound of
bells--church bells--a sound more depressing to me than superstition,
and as nauseating. Though the action was ill-judged, I obeyed the
sudden prompting--was it a secret desire to attack, perhaps?--and spoke
to her.</p>

<p>'Been to church, I suppose, Mrs. Marsh?' I said. 'Or just going,
perhaps?'</p>

<p>Her face, as she looked up a second to reply, was like an iron doll
that moved its lips and turned its eyes, but made no other imitation of
life at all.</p>

<p>'Some of us still goes, sir,' she said unctuously.</p>

<p>It was respectful enough, yet the implied judgment of the rest of
the world made me almost angry. A deferential insolence lay behind the
affected meekness.</p>

<p>'For those who believe no doubt it is helpful,' I smiled. 'True
religion brings peace and happiness, I'm sure--joy, Mrs. Marsh, joy!' I
found keen satisfaction in the emphasis.</p>

<p>She looked at me like a knife. I cannot describe the implacable
thing that shone in her fixed, stern eyes, nor the shadow of felt
darkness that stole across her face. She glittered. I felt hate in her.
I knew--she knew too--who was in the thoughts of us both at that
moment.</p>

<p>She replied softly, never forgetting her place for an instant:</p>

<p>'There is joy, sir--in 'eaven--over one sinner that repenteth, and
in church there goes up prayer to Gawd for those 'oo--well, for the
others, sir, 'oo--'</p>

<p>She cut short her sentence thus. The gloom about her as she said it
was like the gloom about a hearse, a tomb, a darkness of great hopeless
dungeons. My tongue ran on of itself with a kind of bitter
satisfaction:</p>

<p>'We must believe there are no others, Mrs. Marsh. Salvation, you
know, would be such a failure if there were. No merciful,
all-foreseeing God could ever have devised such a fearful plan--'</p>

<p>Her voice, interrupting me, seemed to rise out of the bowels of the
earth:</p>

<p>'They rejected the salvation when it was offered to them, sir, on
earth.'</p>

<p>'But you wouldn't have them tortured for ever because of one mistake
in ignorance,' I said, fixing her with my eye. 'Come now, would you,
Mrs. Marsh? No God worth worshipping could permit such cruelty. Think a
moment what it means.'</p>

<p>She stared at me, a curious expression in her stupid eyes. It seemed
to me as though the 'woman' in her revolted, while yet she dared not
suffer her grim belief to trip. That is, she would willingly have had
it otherwise but for a terror that prevented.</p>

<p>'We may pray for them, sir, and we do--we may 'ope.' She dropped her
eyes to the carpet.</p>

<p>'Good, good!' I put in cheerfully, sorry now that I had spoken at
all. 'That's more hopeful, at any rate isn't it?'</p>

<p>She murmured something about Abraham's bosom, and the 'time of
salvation not being for ever,' as I tried to pass her. Then a half
gesture that she made stopped me. There was something more she wished
to say--to ask. She looked up furtively. In her eyes I saw the 'woman'
peering out through fear.</p>

<p>'Per'aps, sir,' she faltered, as though lightning must strike her
dead, 'per'aps, would you think, a drop of cold water, given in His
name, might moisten--?'</p>

<p>But I stopped her, for the foolish talk had lasted long enough. 'Of
course,' I exclaimed, 'of course. For God is love, remember, and love
means charity, tolerance, sympathy, and sparing others pain,' and I
hurried past her, determined to end the outrageous conversation for
which yet I knew myself entirely to blame. Behind me, she stood
stock-still for several minutes, half bewildered, half alarmed, as I
suspected. I caught the fragment of another sentence, one word of it,
rather--'punishment'--but the rest escaped me. Her arrogance and
condescending tolerance exasperated me, while I was at the same time
secretly pleased that I might have touched some string of remorse or
sympathy in her after all. Her belief was iron; she dared not let it
go; yet somewhere underneath there lurked the germ of a wholesome
revulsion. She would help 'them'--if she dared. Her question proved
it.</p>

<p>Half ashamed of myself, I turned and crossed the hall quickly lest I
should be tempted to say more, and in me was a disagreeable sensation
as though I had just left the Incurable Ward of some great hospital. A
reaction caught me as of nausea. Ugh! I wanted such people cleansed by
fire. They seemed to me as centres of contamination whose vicious
thoughts flowed out to stain God's glorious world. I saw myself,
Frances, Mabel too especially, on the rack, while that odious figure of
cruelty and darkness stood over us and ordered the awful handles turned
in order that we might be 'saved'--forced, that is, to think and
believe exactly as she thought and believed.</p>

<p>I found relief for my somewhat childish indignation by letting
myself loose upon the organ then. The flood of Bach and Beethoven
brought back the sense of proportion. It proved, however, at the same
time that there had been this growth of distortion in me, and that it
had been provided apparently by my closer contact--for the first
time--with that funereal personality, the woman who, like her master,
believed that all holding views of God that differed from her own, must
be damned eternally. It gave me, moreover, some faint clue perhaps,
though a clue I was unequal of following up, to the nature of the
strife and terror and frustrate influence in the house. That
housekeeper had to do with it. She kept it alive. Her thought was like
a spell she waved above her mistress's head.</p>

<h3>Chapter VII</h3>

<p>That night I was wakened by a hurried tapping at my door, and before
I could answer, Frances stood beside my bed. She had switched on the
light as she came in. Her hair fell straggling over her dressing-gown.
Her face was deathly pale, its expression so distraught it was almost
haggard.</p>

<p>The eyes were very wide. She looked almost like another woman.</p>

<p>She was whispering at a great pace: 'Bill, Bill, wake up,
quick!'</p>

<p>'I am awake. What is it?' I whispered too. I was startled.</p>

<p>'Listen!' was all she said. Her eyes stared into vacancy.</p>

<p>There was not a sound in the great house. The wind had dropped, and
all was still. Only the tapping seemed to continue endlessly in my
brain. The clock on the mantelpiece pointed to half-past two.</p>

<p>'I heard nothing, Frances. What is it?' I rubbed my eyes; I had been
very deeply asleep.</p>

<p>'Listen!' she repeated very softly, holding up one finger and
turning her eyes towards the door she had left ajar. Her usual calmness
had deserted her. She was in the grip of some distressing terror.</p>

<p>For a full minute we held our breath and listened. Then her eyes
rolled round again and met my own, and her skin went even whiter than
before.</p>

<p>'It woke me,' she said beneath her breath, and moving a step nearer
to my bed. 'It was the Noise.' Even her whisper trembled.</p>

<p>'The Noise!' The word repeated itself dully of its own accord. I
would rather it had been anything in the world but that--earthquake,
foreign cannon, collapse of the house above our heads! 'The Noise,
Frances I Are you sure?' I was playing really for a little time.</p>

<p>'It was like thunder. At first I thought it was thunder. But a
minute later it came again--from underground. It's appalling.' She
muttered the words, her voice not properly under control.</p>

<p>There was a pause of perhaps a minute, and then we both spoke at
once. We said foolish, obvious things that neither of us believed in
for a second. The roof had fallen in, there were burglars downstairs,
the safes had been blown open. It was to comfort each other as children
do that we said these things; also it was to gain further time.</p>

<p>'There's some one in the house, of course,' I heard my voice say
finally, as I sprang out of bed and hurried into dressing-gown and
slippers. 'Don't be alarmed. I'll go down and see,' and from the drawer
I took a pistol it was my habit to carry everywhere with me. I loaded
it carefully while Frances stood stock-still beside the bed and
watched. I moved towards the open door.</p>

<p>'You stay here, Frances,' I whispered, the beating of my heart
making the words uneven, 'while I go down and make a search. Lock
yourself in, girl. Nothing can happen to you. It was downstairs, you
said?'</p>

<p>'Underneath,' she answered faintly, pointing through the floor.</p>

<p>She moved suddenly between me and the door.</p>

<p>'Listen! Hark!' she said, the eyes in her face quite fixed; 'it's
coming again,' and she turned her head to catch the slightest sound. I
stood there watching her, and while I watched her, shook.</p>

<p>But nothing stirred. From the halls below rose only the whirr and
quiet ticking of the numerous clocks. The blind by the open window
behind us flapped out a little into the room as the draught caught
it.</p>

<p>'I'll come with you, Bill--to the next floor,' she broke the
silence. 'Then I'll stay with Mabel--till you come up again.' The blind
sank down with a long sigh as she said it.</p>

<p>The question jumped to my lips before I could repress it:</p>

<p>'Mabel is awake. She heard it too?'</p>

<p>I hardly know why horror caught me at her answer. All was so vague
and terrible as we stood there playing the great game of this sinister
house where nothing ever happened.</p>

<p>'We met in the passage. She was on her way to me.'</p>

<p>What shook in me, shook inwardly. Frances, I mean, did not see it. I
had the feeling just that the Noise was upon us, that any second it
would boom and roar about our ears. But the deep silence held. I only
heard my sister's little whisper coming across the room in answer to my
question:</p>

<p>'Then what is Mabel doing now?'</p>

<p>And her reply proved that she was yielding at last beneath the
dreadful tension, for she spoke at once, unable longer to keep up the
pretence. With a kind of relief, as it were, she said it out, looking
helplessly at me like a child:</p>

<p>'She is weeping and gna--'</p>

<p>My expression must have stopped her. I believe I clapped both hands
upon her mouth, though when I realised things clearly again, I found
they were covering my own ears instead. It was a moment of unutterable
horror. The revulsion I felt was actually physical. It would have given
me pleasure to fire off all the five chambers of my pistol into the air
above my head; the sound--a definite, wholesome sound that explained
itself--would have been a positive relief. Other feelings, though, were
in me too, all over me, rushing to and fro. It was vain to seek their
disentanglement; it was impossible. I confess that I experienced, among
them, a touch of paralysing fear--though for a moment only; it passed
as sharply as it came, leaving me with a violent flush of blood to the
face such as bursts of anger bring, followed abruptly by an icy
perspiration over the entire body. Yet I may honestly avow that it was
not ordinary personal fear I felt, nor any common dread of physical
injury. It was, rather, a vast, impersonal shrinking--a sympathetic
shrinking--from the agony and terror that countless others, somewhere,
somehow, felt for themselves. The first sensation of a prison
overwhelmed me in that instant, of bitter strife and frenzied
suffering, and the fiery torture of the yearning to escape that was yet
hopelessly uttered...It was of incredible power. It was real. The vain,
intolerable hope swept over me.</p>

<p>I mastered myself, though hardly knowing how, and took my sister's
hand. It was as cold as ice, as I led her firmly to the door and out
into the passage. Apparently she noticed nothing of my so near
collapse, for I caught her whisper as we went. 'You are brave, Bill;
splendidly brave.'</p>

<p>The upper corridors of the great sleeping house were brightly lit;
on her way to me she had turned on every electric switch her hand could
reach; and as we passed the final flight of stairs to the floor below,
I heard a door shut softly and knew that Mabel had been
listening--waiting for us. I led my sister up to it. She knocked, and
the door was opened cautiously an inch or so. The room was pitch black.
I caught no glimpse of Mabel standing there. Frances turned to me with
a hurried whisper, 'Billy, you will be careful, won't you?' and went
in. I just had time to answer that I would not be long, and Frances to
reply, 'You'll find us here' when the door closed and cut her sentence
short before its end.</p>

<p>But it was not alone the closing door that took the final words.
Frances--by the way she disappeared I knew it--had made a swift and
violent movement into the darkness that was as though she sprang. She
leaped upon that other woman who stood back among the shadows, for,
simultaneously with the clipping of the sentence, another sound was
also stopped--stifled, smothered, choked back lest I should also hear
it. Yet not in time. I heard it--a hard and horrible sound that
explained both the leap and the abrupt cessation of the whispered
words.</p>

<p>I stood irresolute a moment. It was as though all the bones had been
withdrawn from my body, so that I must sink and fall. That sound
plucked them out, and plucked out my self-possession with them. I am
not sure that it was a sound I had ever heard before, though children,
I half remembered, made it sometimes in blind rages when they knew not
what they did. In a grown-up person certainly I had never known it. I
associated it with animals rather--horribly. In the history of the
world, no doubt, it has been common enough, alas, but fortunately
to-day there can be but few who know it, or would recognise it even
when heard. The bones shot back into my body the same instant, but
red-hot and burning; the brief instant of irresolution passed; I was
torn between the desire to break down the door and enter, and to
run--run for my life from a thing I dared not face.</p>

<p>Out of the horrid tumult, then, I adopted neither course. Without
reflection, certainly without analysis of what was best to do for my
sister, myself or Mabel, I took up my action where it had been
interrupted. I turned from the awful door and moved slowly towards the
head of the stairs.</p>

<p>But that dreadful little sound came with me. I believe my own teeth
chattered. It seemed all over the house--in the empty halls that opened
into the long passages towards the music-room, and even in the grounds
outside the building. From the lawns and barren garden, from the ugly
terraces themselves, it rose into the night, and behind it came a
curious driving sound, incomplete, unfinished, as of wailing for
deliverance, the wailing of desperate souls in anguish, the dull and
dry beseeching of hopeless spirits in prison.</p>

<p>That I could have taken the little sound from the bedroom where I
actually heard it, and spread it thus over the entire house and
grounds, is evidence, perhaps, of the state my nerves were in.</p>

<p>The wailing assuredly was in my mind alone. But the longer I
hesitated, the more difficult became my task, and, gathering up my
dressing-gown, lest I should trip in the darkness, I passed slowly down
the staircase into the hall below. I carried neither candle nor
matches; every switch in room and corridor was known to me. The
covering of darkness was indeed rather comforting than otherwise, for
if it prevented seeing, it also prevented being seen. The heavy pistol,
knocking against my thigh as I moved, made me feel I was carrying a
child's toy, foolishly. I experienced in every nerve that primitive
vast dread which is the Thrill of darkness. Merely the child in me was
comforted by that pistol.</p>

<p>The night was not entirely black; the iron bars across the glass
front door were visible, and, equally, I discerned the big, stiff
wooden chairs in the hall, the gaping fireplace, the upright pillars
supporting the staircase, the round table in the centre with its books
and flower-vases, and the basket that held visitors' cards. There, too,
was the stick and umbrella stand and the shelf with railway guides,
directory, and telegraph forms. Clocks ticked everywhere with sounds
like quiet footfalls. Light fell here and there in patches from the
floor above. I stood a moment in the hall, letting my eyes grow more
accustomed to the gloom, while deciding on a plan of search. I made out
the ivy trailing outside over one of the big windows...and then the
tall clock by the front door made a grating noise deep down inside its
body--it was the Presentation clock, large and hideous, given by the
congregation of his church--and, dreading the booming strike it seemed
to threaten, I made a quick decision. If others beside myself were
about in the night, the sound of that striking might cover their
approach.</p>

<p>So I tiptoed to the right, where the passage led towards the
dining-room. In the other direction were the morning-and drawing-rooms,
both little used, and various other rooms beyond that had been his,
generally now kept locked. I thought of my sister, waiting upstairs
with that frightened woman for my return. I went quickly, yet
stealthily.</p>

<p>And, to my surprise, the door of the dining-room was open. It had
been opened. I paused on the threshold, staring about me. I think I
fully expected to see a figure blocked in the shadows against the heavy
sideboard, or looming on the other side beneath his portrait. But the
room was empty; I felt it empty. Through the wide bow-windows that gave
on to the verandah came an uncertain glimmer that even shone reflected
in the polished surface of the dinner-table, and again I perceived the
stiff outline of chairs, waiting tenantless all round it, two larger
ones with high carved backs at either end. The monkey-trees on the
upper terrace, too, were visible outside against the sky, and the
solemn crests of the wellingtonias on the terraces below. The enormous
dock on the mantelpiece ticked very slowly, as though its machinery
were running down, and I made out the pale round patch that was its
face. Resisting my first inclination to turn the lights up--my hand had
gone so far as to finger the friendly knob--I crossed the room so
carefully that no single board creaked, nor a single chair, as I rested
a hand upon its back, moved on the parquet flooring. I turned neither
to the right nor left, nor did I once look back.</p>

<p>I went towards the long corridor filled with priceless objets d'art,
that led through various antechambers into the spacious music-room, and
only at the mouth of this corridor did I next halt a moment in
uncertainty. For this long corridor, lit faintly by high windows on the
left from the verandah, was very narrow, owing to the mass of shelves
and fancy tables it contained. It was not that I feared to knock over
precious things as I went, but, that, because of its ungenerous width,
there would be no room to pass another person--if I met one. And the
certainty had suddenly come upon me that somewhere in this corridor
another person at this actual moment stood. Here, somehow, amid all
this dead atmosphere of furniture and impersonal emptiness, lay the
hint of a living human presence; and with such conviction did it come
upon me, that my hand instinctively gripped the pistol in my pocket
before I could even think. Either some one had passed along this
corridor just before me, or some one lay waiting at its farther
end--withdrawn or flattened into one of the little recesses, to let me
pass. It was the person who had opened the door. And the blood ran from
my heart as I realised it.</p>

<p>It was not courage that sent me on, but rather a strong impulsion
from behind that made it impossible to retreat: the feeling that a
throng pressed at my back, drawing nearer and nearer; that I was
already half surrounded, swept, dragged, coaxed into a vast
prison-house where there was wailing and gnashing of teeth, where their
worm dieth not and their fire is not quenched. I can neither explain
nor justify the storm of irrational emotion that swept me as I stood in
that moment, staring down the length of the silent corridor towards the
music-room at the far end, I can only repeat that no personal bravery
sent me down it, but that the negative emotion of fear was swamped in
this vast sea of pity and commiseration for others that surged upon
me.</p>

<p>My senses, at least, were no whit confused; if anything, my brain
registered impressions with keener accuracy than usual. I noticed, for
instance, that the two swinging doors of baize that cut the corridor
into definite lengths, making little rooms of the spaces between them,
were both wide-open--in the dim light no mean achievement. Also that
the fronds of a palm plant, some ten feet in front of me, still stirred
gently from the air of some one who had recently gone past them. The
long green leaves waved to and fro like hands. Then I went stealthily
forward down the narrow space, proud even that I had this command of
myself, and so carefully that my feet made no sound upon the Japanese
matting on the floor.</p>

<p>It was a journey that seemed timeless. I have no idea how fast or
slow I went, but I remember that I deliberately examined articles on
each side of me, peering with particular closeness into the recesses of
wall and window. I passed the first baize doors, and the passage beyond
them widened out to hold shelves of books; there were sofas and small
reading-tables against the wall.</p>

<p>It narrowed again presently, as I entered the second stretch. The
windows here were higher and smaller, and marble statuettes of
classical subject lined the walls, watching me like figures of the
dead. Their white and shining faces saw me, yet made no sign. I passed
next between the second baize doors. They, too, had been fastened back
with --gainst the wall. Thus all doors were open--had been recently
opened.</p>

<p>And so, at length, I found myself in the final widening of the
corridor which formed an antechamber to the music-room itself. It had
been used formerly to hold the overflow of meetings. No door separated
it from the great hall beyond, but heavy curtains hung usually to close
it off, and these curtains were invariably drawn. They now stood wide.
And here--I can merely state the impression that came upon me--I knew
myself at last surrounded. The throng that pressed behind me, also
surged in front: facing me in the big room, and waiting for my entry,
stood a multitude; on either side of me, in the very air above my head,
the vast assemblage paused upon my coming. The pause, however, was
momentary, for instantly the deep, tumultuous movement was resumed that
yet was silent as a cavern underground. I felt the agony that was in
it, the passionate striving, the awful struggle to escape. The
semi-darkness held beseeching faces that fought to press themselves
upon my vision, yearning yet hopeless eyes, lips scorched and dry,
mouths that opened to implore but found no craved delivery in actual
words, and a fury of misery and hate that made the life in me stop
dead, frozen by the horror of vain pity. That intolerable, vain Hope
was everywhere.</p>

<p>And the multitude, it came to me, was not a single multitude, but
many; for, as soon as one huge division pressed too close upon the edge
of escape, it was dragged back by another and prevented. The wild host
was divided against itself. Here dwelt the Shadow I had 'imagined'
weeks ago, and in it struggled armies of lost souls as in the depths of
some bottomless pit whence there is no escape. The layers mingled,
fighting against themselves in endless torture. It was in this great
Shadow I had clairvoyantly seen Mabel, but about its fearful mouth, I
now was certain, hovered another figure of darkness, a figure who
sought to keep it in existence, since to her thought were due those
lampless depths of woe without escape...Towards me the multitudes now
surged.</p>

<p>It was a sound and a movement that brought me back into myself. The
great clock at the farther end of the room just then struck the hour of
three. That was the sound. And the movement--? I was aware that a
figure was passing across the distant centre of the floor. Instantly I
dropped back into the arena of my little human terror. My hand again
clutched stupidly at the pistol butt. I drew back into the folds of the
heavy curtain. And the figure advanced.</p>

<p>I remember every detail. At first it seemed to me enormous--this
advancing shadow--far beyond human scale; but as it came nearer, I
measured it, though not consciously, by the organ pipes that gleamed in
faint colours, just above its gradual soft approach. It passed them,
already half-way across the great room. I saw then that its stature was
that of ordinary men. The prolonged booming of the clock died away. I
heard the footfall, shuffling upon the polished boards. I heard another
sound--a voice, low and monotonous, droning as in prayer. The figure
was speaking. It was a woman. And she carried in both hands before her
a small object that faintly shimmered--a glass of water. And then I
recognised her.</p>

<p>There was still an instant's time before she reached me, and I made
use of it. I shrank back, flattening myself against the wall. Her voice
ceased a moment, as she turned and carefully drew the curtains together
behind her, closing them with one hand. Oblivious of my presence,
though she actually touched my dressing-gown with the hand that pulled
the cords, she resumed her dreadful, solemn march, disappearing at
length down the long vista of the corridor like a shadow.</p>

<p>But as she passed me, her voice began again, so that I heard each
word distinctly as she uttered it, her head aloft, her figure upright,
as though she moved at the head of a procession:</p>

<p>'A drop of cold water, given in His name, shall moisten their
burning tongues.'</p>

<p>It was repeated monotonously over and over again, droning down into
the distance as she went, until at length both voice and figure faded
into the shadows at the farther end.</p>

<p>For a time, I have no means of measuring precisely, I stood in that
dark corner, pressing my back against the wall, and would have drawn
the curtains down to hide me had I dared to stretch an arm out. The
dread that presently the woman would return passed gradually away. I
realised that the air had emptied, the crowd her presence had stirred
into activity had retreated; I was alone in the gloomy under-space of
the odious building...Then I remembered suddenly again the terrified
women waiting for me on that upper landing; and realised that my skin
was wet and freezing cold after a profuse perspiration. I prepared to
retrace my steps. I remember the effort it cost me to leave the support
of the wall and covering darkness of my corner, and step out into the
grey light of the corridor. At first I sidled, then, finding this mode
of walking impossible, turned my face boldly and walked quickly,
regardless that my dressing-gown set the precious objects shaking as I
passed. A wind that sighed mournfully against the high, small windows
seemed to have got inside the corridor as well; it felt so cold; and
every moment I dreaded to see the outline of the woman's figure as she
waited in recess or angle against the wall for me to pass.</p>

<p>Was there another thing I dreaded even more? I cannot say. I only
know that the first baize doors had swung to behind me, and the second
ones were close at hand, when the great dim thunder caught me, pouring
up with prodigious volume so that it, seemed to roll out from another
world. It shook the very bowels of the building. I was closer to it
than that other time, when it had followed me from the goblin garden.
There was strength and hardness in it, as of metal reverberation. Some
touch of numbness, almost of paralysis, must surely have been upon me
that I felt no actual terror, for I remember even turning and standing
still to hear it better. 'That is the Noise,' my thought ran stupidly,
and I think I whispered it aloud; 'the Doors are closing. 'The wind
outside against the windows was audible, so it cannot have been really
loud, yet to me it was the biggest, deepest sound I have ever heard,
but so far away, with such awful remoteness in it, that I had to doubt
my own ears at the same time. It seemed underground--the rumbling of
earthquake gates that shut remorselessly within the rocky
Earth--stupendous ultimate thunder. They were shut off from help again.
The doors had closed.</p>

<p>I felt a storm of pity, an agony of bitter, futile hate sweep
through me. My memory of the figure changed then. The Woman with the
glass of cooling water had stepped down from Heaven; but the Man--or
was it Men?--who smeared this terrible layer of belief and Thought upon
the world!...</p>

<p>I crossed the dining-room--it was fancy, of course, that held my
eyes from glancing at the portrait for fear I should see it smiling
approval--and so finally reached the hall, where the light from the
floor above seemed now quite bright in comparison. All the doors I
closed carefully behind me; but first I had to open them. The woman had
closed every one. Up the stairs, then, I actually ran, two steps at a
time. My sister was standing outside Mabel's door. By her face I knew
that she had also heard. There was no need to ask. I quickly made my
mind up.</p>

<p>'There's nothing,' I said, and detailed briefly my tour of search.
'All is quiet and undisturbed downstairs.' May God forgive me!</p>

<p>She beckoned to me, closing the door softly behind her. My heart
beat violently a moment, then stood still.</p>

<p>'Mabel,' she said aloud.</p>

<p>It was like the sentence of a judge, that one short word.</p>

<p>I tried to push past her and go in, but she stopped me with her arm.
She was wholly mistress of herself, I saw.</p>

<p>'Hush!' she said in a lower voice. 'I've got her round again with
brandy. She's sleeping quietly now. We won't disturb her.'</p>

<p>She drew me farther out into the landing, and as she did so, the
clock in the hall below struck half-past three. I had stood, then,
thirty minutes in the corridor below. 'You've been such a long time.'
she said simply. 'I feared for you,' and she took my hand in her own
that was cold and clammy.</p>

<h3>Chapter VIII</h3>

<p>And then, while that dreadful house stood listening about us in the
early hours of this chill morning upon the edge of winter, she told me,
with laconic brevity, things about Mabel that I heard as from a
distance. There was nothing so unusual or tremendous in the short
recital, nothing indeed I might not have already guessed for myself. It
was the time and scene, the inference, too, that made it so afflicting:
the idea that Mabel believed herself so utterly and hopelessly
lost--beyond recovery--damned.</p>

<p>That she had loved him with so passionate a devotion that she had
given her soul into his keeping, this certainly I had not
divined--probably because I had never thought about it one way or the
other. He had 'converted' her, I knew, but that she had subscribed
whole-heartedly to that most cruel and ugly of his dogmas--this was new
to me, and came with a certain shock as I heard it. In love, of course,
the weaker nature is receptive to all manner of suggestion. This man
had 'suggested' his pet brimstone lake so vividly that she had listened
and believed. He had frightened her into heaven; and his heaven, a
definite locality in the skies, had its foretaste here on earth in
miniature--The Towers, house and garden. Into his dolorous scheme of a
handful saved and millions damned, his enclosure, as it were, of sheep
and goats, he had swept her before she was aware of it. Her mind no
longer was her own. And it was Mrs. Marsh who kept the thought-stream
open, though tempered, as she deemed, with that touch of craven,
superstitious mercy.</p>

<p>But what I found it difficult to understand, and still more
difficult to accept, was that, during her year abroad, she had been so
haunted with a secret dread of that hideous after-death that she had
finally revolted and tried to recover that clearer state of mind she
had enjoyed before the religious bully had stunned her--yet had tried
in vain. She had returned to The Towers to find her soul again, only to
realise that it was lost eternally. The cleaner state of mind lay then
beyond recovery. In the reaction that followed the removal of his
terrible 'suggestion,' she felt the crumbling of all that he had taught
her, but searched in vain for the peace and beauty his teachings had
destroyed. Nothing came to replace these. She was empty, desolate,
hopeless; craving her former joy and carelessness, she found only hate
and diabolical calculation. This man, whom she had loved to the point
of losing her soul for him, had bequeathed to her one black and fiery
thing--the terror of the damned. His thinking wrapped her in this iron
garment that held her fast.</p>

<p>All this Frances told me, far more briefly than I have here repeated
it. In her eyes and gestures and laconic sentences lay the conviction
of great beating issues and of menacing drama my own description fails
to recapture. It was all so incongruous and remote from the world I
lived in that more than once a smile, though a smile of pity, fluttered
to my lips; but a glimpse of my face in the mirror showed rather the
leer of a grimace. There was no real laughter anywhere that night.</p>

<p>The entire adventure seemed so incredible, here, in this twentieth
century--but yet delusion, that feeble word, did not occur once in the
comments my mind suggested though did not utter. I remembered that
forbidding shadow too; my sister's watercolours; the vanished
personality of our hostess; the inexplicable, thundering Noise, and the
figure of Mrs. Marsh in her midnight ritual that was so childish yet so
horrible. I shivered in spite of my own 'emancipated' cast of mind.</p>

<p>'There is no Mabel,' were the words with which my sister sent
another shower of ice down my spine. 'He has killed her in his lake of
fire and brimstone.'</p>

<p>I stared at her blankly, as in a nightmare where nothing true or
possible ever happened.</p>

<p>'He killed her in his lake of fire and brimstone,' she repeated more
faintly.</p>

<p>A desperate effort was in me to say the strong, sensible thing which
should destroy the oppressive horror that grew so stiflingly about us
both, but again the mirror drew the attempted smile into the merest
grin, betraying the distortion that was everywhere in the place.</p>

<p>'You mean,' I stammered beneath my breath, 'that her faith has gone,
but that the terror has remained?' I asked it, dully groping. I moved
out of the line of the reflection in the glass.</p>

<p>She bowed her head as though beneath a weight; her skin was the
pallor of grey ashes.</p>

<p>'You mean,' I said louder, 'that she has lost her--mind?'</p>

<p>'She is terror incarnate,' was the whispered answer. 'Mabel has lost
her soul. Her soul is--there!' She pointed horribly below. 'She is
seeking it...?'</p>

<p>The word 'soul' stung me into something of my normal self again.</p>

<p>'But her terror, poor thing, is not--cannot be--transferable to us!'
I exclaimed more vehemently. 'It certainly is not convertible into
feelings, sights and--even sounds!'</p>

<p>She interrupted me quickly, almost impatiently, speaking with that
conviction by which she conquered me so easily that night.</p>

<p>'It is her terror that revived "the Others." It has brought her into
touch with them. They are loose and driving after her. Her efforts at
resistance have given them also hope--that escape, after all, is
possible. Day and night they strive.</p>

<p>'Escape! Others!' The anger fast rising in me dropped of its own
accord at the moment of birth. It shrank into a shuddering beyond my
control. In that moment, I think, I would have believed in the
possibility of anything and everything she might tell me. To argue or
contradict seemed equally futile.</p>

<p>'His strong belief, as also the beliefs of others who have preceded
him,' she replied, so sure of herself that I actually turned to look
over my shoulder, 'have left their shadow like a thick deposit over the
house and grounds. To them, poor souls imprisoned by thought, it was
hopeless as granite walls--until her resistance, her effort to
dissipate it--let in light. Now, in their thousands, they are flocking
to this little light, seeking escape. Her own escape, don't you see,
may release them all!'</p>

<p>It took my breath away. Had his predecessors, former occupants of
this house, also preached damnation of all the world but their own
exclusive sect? Was this the explanation of her obscure talk of
'layers,' each striving against the other for domination? And if men
are spirits, and these spirits survive, could strong Thought thus
determine their condition even afterwards?</p>

<p>So many questions flooded into me that I selected no one of them,
but stared in uncomfortable silence, bewildered, out of my depth, and
acutely, painfully distressed. There was so odd a mixture of possible
truth and incredible, unacceptable explanation in it all; so much
confirmed, yet so much left darker than before. What she said did,
indeed, offer a quasi-interpretation of my own series of abominable
sensations--strife, agony, pity, hate, escape--but so far-fetched that
only the deep conviction in her voice and attitude made it tolerable
for a second even. I found myself in a curious state of mind. I could
neither think clearly nor say a word to refute her amazing statements,
whispered there beside me in the shivering hours of the early morning
with only a wall between ourselves and--Mabel. Close behind her words I
remember this singular thing, however--that an atmosphere as of the
Inquisition seemed to rise and stir about the room, beating awful wings
of black above my head.</p>

<p>Abruptly, then, a moment's common-sense returned to me. I faced
her.</p>

<p>'And the Noise?' I said aloud, more firmly, 'the roar of the closing
doors? We have all heard that! Is that subjective too?'</p>

<p>Frances looked sideways about her in a queer fashion that made my
flesh creep again. I spoke brusquely, almost angrily. I repeated the
question, and waited with anxiety for her reply.</p>

<p>'What noise?' she asked, with the frank expression of an innocent
child. 'What closing doors?'</p>

<p>But her face turned from grey to white, and I saw that drops of
perspiration glistened on her forehead. She caught at the back of a
chair to steady herself, then glanced about her again with that
sidelong look that made my blood run cold. I understood suddenly then.
She did not take in what I said. I knew now. She was listening--for
something else.</p>

<p>And the discovery revived in me a far stronger emotion than any mere
desire for immediate explanation. Not only did I not insist upon an
answer, but I was actually terrified lest she would answer. More, I
felt in me a terror lest I should be moved to describe my own
experiences below-stairs, thus increasing their reality and so the
reality of all. She might even explain them too!</p>

<p>Still listening intently, she raised her head and looked me in the
eyes. Her lips opened to speak. The words came to me from a great
distance, it seemed, and her voice had a sound like a stone that drops
into a deep well, its fate though hidden, known.</p>

<p>We are in it with her, too, Bill. We are in it with her. Our
interpretations vary--because we are--in parts of it only. Mabel is in
it--all.'</p>

<p>The desire for violence came over me. If only she would say a
definite thing in plain King's English! If only I could find it in me
to give utterance to what shouted so loud within me! If only--the same
old cry--something would happen! For all this elliptic talk that dazed
my mind left obscurity everywhere. Her atrocious meaning, none the
less, flashed through me, though vanishing before it wholly divulged
itself.</p>

<p>It brought a certain reaction with it. I found my tongue. Whether I
actually believed what I said is more than I can swear to; that it
seemed to me wise at the moment is all I remember. My mind was in a
state of obscure perception less than that of normal consciousness.</p>

<p>'Yes, Frances, I believe that what you say is the truth, and that we
are in it with her'--I meant to say I with loud, hostile emphasis, but
instead I whispered it lest she should hear the trembling of my
voice--'and for that reason, my dear sister, we leave to-morrow, you
and I--to-day, rather, since it is long past midnight--we leave this
house of the damned. We go back to London.'</p>

<p>Frances looked up, her face distraught almost beyond recognition.
But it was not my words that caused the tumult in her heart. It was a
sound--the sound she had been listening for--so faint I barely caught
it myself, and had she not pointed I could never have known the
direction whence it came. Small and terrible it rose again in the
stillness of the night, the sound of gnashing teeth. And behind it came
another--the tread of stealthy footsteps. Both were just outside the
door.</p>

<p>The room swung round me for a second. My first instinct to prevent
my sister going out--she had dashed past me frantically to the
door--gave place to another when I saw the expression in her eyes. I
followed her lead instead; it was surer than my own. The pistol in my
pocket swung uselessly against my thigh. I was flustered beyond belief
and ashamed that I was so.</p>

<p>'Keep close to me, Frances,' I said huskily, as the door swung wide
and a shaft of light fell upon a figure moving rapidly. Mabel was going
down the corridor. Beyond her, in the shadows on the staircase, a
second figure stood beckoning, scarcely visible.</p>

<p>'Before they get her! Quick!' was screamed into my ears, and our
arms were about her in the same moment. It was a horrible scene. Not
that Mabel struggled in the least, but that she collapsed as we caught
her and fell with her dead weight, as of a corpse, limp, against us.
And her teeth began again. They continued, even beneath the hand that
Frances clapped upon her lips...</p>

<p>We carried her back into her own bedroom, where she lay down
peacefully enough. It was so soon over...The rapidity of the whole
thing robbed it of reality almost. It had the swiftness of something
remembered rather than of something witnessed. She slept again so
quickly that it was almost as if we had caught her sleep-walking. I
cannot say. I asked no questions at the time; I have asked none since;
and my help was needed as little as the protection of my pistol.
Frances was strangely competent and collected...I lingered for some
time uselessly by the door, till at length, looking up with a sigh, she
made a sign for me to go.</p>

<p>'I shall wait in your room next door,' I whispered, 'till you come.'
But, though going out, I waited in the corridor instead, so as to hear
the faintest call for help. In that dark corridor upstairs I waited,
but not long. It may have been fifteen minutes when Frances reappeared,
locking the door softly behind her. Leaning over the banisters, I saw
her.</p>

<p>'I'll go in again about six o'clock,' she whispered, 'as soon as it
gets light. She is sound asleep now. Please don't wait. If anything
happens I'll call--you might leave your door ajar, perhaps.'</p>

<p>And she came up, looking like a ghost.</p>

<p>But I saw her first safely into bed, and the rest of the night I
spent in an armchair close to my opened door, listening for the
slightest sound. Soon after five o'clock I heard Frances fumbling with
the key, and, peering over the railing again, I waited till she
reappeared and went back into her own room. She closed her door.
Evidently she was satisfied that all was well.</p>

<p>Then, and then only, did I go to bed myself, but not to sleep. I
could not get the scene out of my mind, especially that odious detail
of it which I hoped and believed my sister had not seen--the still,
dark figure of the housekeeper waiting on the stairs below--waiting, of
course, for Mabel.</p>

<h3>Chapter IX</h3>

<p>It seems I became a mere spectator after that; my sister's lead was
so assured for one thing, and, for another, the responsibility of
leaving Mabel alone--Frances laid it bodily upon my shoulders--was a
little more than I cared about. Moreover, when we all three met later
in the day, things went on so exactly as before, so absolutely without
friction or distress, that to present a sudden, obvious excuse for
cutting our visit short seemed ill-judged. And on the lowest grounds it
would have been desertion. At any rate, it was beyond my powers, and
Frances was quite firm that she must stay. We therefore did stay.
Things that happen in the night always seem exaggerated and distorted
when the sun shines brightly next morning; no one can reconstruct the
terror of a nightmare afterwards, nor comprehend why it seemed so
overwhelming at the time.</p>

<p>I slept till ten o'clock, and when I rang for breakfast, a note from
my sister lay upon the tray, its message of counsel couched in a calm
and comforting strain. Mabel, she assured me, was herself again and
remembered nothing of what had happened; there was no need of any
violent measures; I was to treat her exactly as if I knew nothing.
'And, if you don't mind, Bill, let us leave the matter unmentioned
between ourselves as well. Discussion exaggerates; such things are best
not talked about. I'm sorry I disturbed you so unnecessarily; I was
stupidly excited. Please forget all the things I said at the moment.'
She had written 'nonsense' first instead of 'things,' then scratched it
out. She wished to convey that hysteria had been abroad in the night,
and I readily gulped the explanation down, though it could not satisfy
me in the smallest degree.</p>

<p>There was another week of our visit still, and we stayed it out to
the end without disaster. My desire to leave at times became that
frantic thing, desire to escape; but I controlled it, kept silent,
watched and wondered. Nothing happened. As before, and everywhere,
there was no sequence of development, no connection between cause and
effect; and climax, none whatever. The thing swayed up and down,
backwards and forwards like a great loose curtain in the wind, and I
could only vaguely surmise what caused the draught or why there was a
curtain at all. A novelist might mould the queer material into coherent
sequence that would be interesting but could not be true.</p>

<p>It remains, therefore, not a story but a history. Nothing
happened.</p>

<p>Perhaps my intense dislike of the fall of darkness was due wholly to
my stirred imagination, and perhaps my anger when I learned that
Frances now occupied a bed in our hostess's room was unreasonable.
Nerves were unquestionably on edge. I was for ever on the look-out for
some event that should make escape imperative, but yet that never
presented itself. I slept lightly, left my door ajar to catch the
slightest sound, even made stealthy tours of the house below-stairs
while everybody dreamed in their beds. But I discovered nothing; the
doors were always locked; I neither saw the housekeeper again in
unreasonable times and places, nor heard a footstep in the passages and
halls. The Noise was never once repeated. That horrible, ultimate
thunder, my intensest dread of all, lay withdrawn into the abyss whence
it had twice arisen. And though in my thoughts it was sternly denied
existence, the great black reason for the fact afflicted me
unbelievably. Since Mabel's fruitless effort to escape, the Doors kept
closed remorselessly. She had failed; they gave up hope. For this was
the explanation that haunted the region of my mind where feelings stir
and hint before they clothe themselves in actual language. Only I
firmly kept it there; it never knew expression.</p>

<p>But, if my ears were open, my eyes were opened too, and it were idle
to pretend that I did not notice a hundred details that were capable of
sinister interpretation had I been weak enough to yield. Some
protective barrier had fallen into ruins round me, so that Terror
stalked behind the general collapse, feeling for me through all the
gaping fissures. Much of this, I admit, must have been merely the
elaboration of those sensations I had first vaguely felt, before
subsequent events and my talks with Frances had dramatised them into
living thoughts. I therefore leave them unmentioned in this history,
just as my mind left them unmentioned in that interminable final week.
Our life went on precisely as before--Mabel unreal and outwardly so
still; Frances, secretive, anxious, tactful to the point of slyness,
and keen to save to the point of self-forgetfulness.</p>

<p>There were the same stupid meals, the same wearisome long evenings,
the stifling ugliness of house and grounds, the Shadow settling in so
thickly that it seemed almost a visible, tangible thing. I came to feel
the only friendly things in all this hostile, cruel place were the
robins that hopped boldly over the monstrous terraces and even up to
the windows of the unsightly house itself. The robins alone knew joy;
they danced, believing no evil thing was possible in all God's radiant
world. They believed in everybody; their god's plan of life had no room
in it for hell, damnation and lakes of brimstone. I came to love the
little birds. Had Samuel Franklyn known them, he might have preached a
different sermon, bequeathing love in place of terror!</p>

<p>Most of my time I spent writing; but it was a pretence at best, and
rather a dangerous one besides. For it stirred the mind to production,
with the result that other things came pouring in as well. With reading
it was the same. In the end I found an aggressive, deliberate
resistance to be the only way of feasible defence. To walk far afield
was out of the question, for it meant leaving my sister too long alone,
so that my exercise was confined to nearer home. My saunters in the
grounds, however, never surprised the goblin garden again. It was close
at hand, but I seemed unable to get wholly into it. Too many things
assailed my mind for any one to hold exclusive possession, perhaps.</p>

<p>Indeed, all the interpretations, all the 'layers,' to use my
sister's phrase, slipped in by turns and lodged there for a time. They
came day and night, and though my reason denied them entrance they held
their own as by a kind of squatter's right. They stirred moods already
in me, that is, and did not introduce entirely new ones; for every mind
conceals ancestral deposits that have been cultivated in turn along the
whole line of its descent. Any day a chance shower may cause this one
or that to blossom. Thus it came to me, at any rate. After darkness the
Inquisition paced the empty corridors and set up ghastly apparatus in
the dismal halls; and once, in the library, there swept over me that
easy and delicious conviction that by confessing my wickedness I could
resume it later, since Confession is expression, and expression brings
relief and leaves one ready to accumulate again. And in such mood I
felt bitter and unforgiving towards all others who thought differently.
Another time it was a Pagan thing that assaulted me--so trivial yet oh,
so significant at the time--when I dreamed that a herd of centaurs
rolled up with a great stamping of hoofs round the house to destroy it,
and then woke to hear the horses tramping across the field below the
lawns; they neighed ominously and their noisy panting was audible as if
it were just outside my windows.</p>

<p>But the tree episode, I think, was the most curious of all--except,
perhaps, the incident with the children which I shall mention in a
moment--for its closeness to reality was so unforgettable.</p>

<p>Outside the east window of my room stood a giant wellingtonia on the
lawn, its head rising level with the upper sash. It grew some twenty
feet away, planted on the highest terrace, and I often saw it when
closing my curtains for the night, noticing how it drew its heavy
skirts about it, and how the light from other windows threw glimmering
streaks and patches that turned it into the semblance of a towering,
solemn image. It stood there then so strikingly, somehow like a great
old-world idol, that it claimed attention. Its appearance was curiously
formidable. Its branches rustled without visibly moving and it had a
certain portentous, forbidding air, so grand and dark and monstrous in
the night that I was always glad when my curtains shut it out. Yet,
once in bed, I had never thought about it one way or the other, and by
day had certainly never sought it out.</p>

<p>One night, then, as I went to bed and closed this window against a
cutting easterly wind, I saw--that there were two of these trees. A
brother wellingtonia rose mysteriously beside it, equally huge, equally
towering, equally monstrous. The menacing pair of them faced me there
upon the lawn. But in this new arrival lay a strange suggestion that
frightened me before I could argue it away. Exact counterpart of its
giant companion, it revealed also that gross, odious quality that all
my sister's paintings held. I got the odd impression that the rest of
these trees, stretching away dimly in a troop over the farther lawns,
were similar, and that, led by this enormous pair, they had all moved
boldly closer to my windows. At the same moment a blind was drawn down
over an upper room; the second tree disappeared into the surrounding
darkness.</p>

<p>It was, of course, this chance light that had brought it into the
field of vision, but when the black shutter dropped over it, hiding it
from view, the manner of its vanishing produced the queer effect that
it had slipped into its companion--almost that it had been an emanation
of the one I so disliked, and not really a tree at all! In this way the
garden turned vehicle for expressing what lay behind it all!...</p>

<p>The behaviour of the doors, the little, ordinary doors, seems
scarcely worth mention at all, their queer way of opening and shutting
of their own accord; for this was accountable in a hundred natural
ways, and to tell the truth, I never caught one in the act of moving.
Indeed, only after frequent repetitions did the detail force itself
upon me, when, having noticed one, I noticed all. It produced, however,
the unpleasant impression of a continual coming and going in the house,
as though, screened cleverly and purposely from actual sight, some one
in the building held constant invisible intercourse with--others.</p>

<p>Upon detailed descriptions of these uncertain incidents I do not
venture, individually so trivial, but taken all together so impressive
and so insolent. But the episode of the children, mentioned above, was
different. And I give it because it showed how vividly the intuitive
child-mind received the impression--one impression, at any rate--of
what was in the air. It may be told in a very few words. I believe they
were the coachman's children, and that the man had been in Mr.
Franklyn's service; but of neither point am I quite positive.</p>

<p>I heard screaming in the rose-garden that runs along the stable
walls--it was one afternoon not far from the tea-hour--and on hurrying
up I found a little girl of nine or ten fastened with ropes to a rustic
seat, and two other children--boys, one about twelve and one much
younger--gathering sticks beneath the climbing rose-trees. The girl was
white and frightened, but the others were laughing and talking among
themselves so busily while they picked that they did not notice my
abrupt arrival. Some game, I understood, was in progress, but a game
that had become too serious for the happiness of the prisoner, for
there was a fear in the girl's eyes that was a very genuine fear
indeed. I unfastened her at once; the ropes were so loosely and
clumsily knotted that they had not hurt her skin; it was not that which
made her pale. She collapsed a moment upon the bench, then picked up
her tiny skirts and dived away at full speed into the safety of the
stable-yard.</p>

<p>There was no response to my brief comforting, but she ran as though
for her life, and I divined that some horrid boys' cruelty had been
afoot. It was probably mere thoughtlessness, as cruelty with children
usually is, but something in me decided to discover exactly what it
was.</p>

<p>And the boys, not one whit alarmed at my intervention, merely
laughed shyly when I explained that their prisoner had escaped, and
told me frankly what their 'gime' had been. There was no vestige of
shame in them, nor any idea, of course, that they aped a monstrous
reality.</p>

<p>That it was mere pretence was neither here nor there. To them,
though make-believe, it was a make-believe of something that was right
and natural and in no sense cruel. Grown-ups did it too. It was
necessary for her good.</p>

<p>'We was going to burn her up, sir,' the older one informed me,
answering my 'Why?' with the explanation, 'Because she wouldn't believe
what we wanted 'er to believe.'</p>

<p>And, game though it was, the feeling of reality about the little
episode was so arresting, so terrific in some way, that only with
difficulty did I confine my admonitions on this occasion to mere words.
The boys slunk off, frightened in their turn, yet not, I felt,
convinced that they had erred in principle. It was their inheritance.
They had breathed it in with the atmosphere of their bringing-up. They
would renew the salutary torture when they could--till she 'believed'
as they did.</p>

<p>I went back into the house, afflicted with a passion of mingled pity
and distress impossible to describe, yet on my short way across the
garden was attacked by other moods in turn, each more real and bitter
than its predecessor. I received the whole series, as it were, at once.
I felt like a diver rising to the surface through layers of water at
different temperatures, though here the natural order was reversed, and
the cooler strata were uppermost, the heated ones below. Thus, I was
caught by the goblin touch of the willows that fringed the field; by
the sensuous curving of the twisted ash that formed a gateway to the
little grove of sapling oaks where fauns and satyrs lurked to play in
the moonlight before Pagan altars; and by the cloaking darkness, next,
of the copse of stunted pines, close gathered each to each, where
hooded figures stalked behind an awful cross. The episode with the
children seemed to have opened me like a knife. The whole Place rushed
at me.</p>

<p>I suspect this synthesis of many moods produced in me that climax of
loathing and disgust which made me feel the limit of bearable emotion
had been reached, so that I made straight to find Frances in order to
convince her that at any rate I must leave. For, although this was our
last day in the house, and we had arranged to go next day, the dread
was in me that she would still find some persuasive reason for staying
on. And an unexpected incident then made my dread unnecessary. The
front door was open and a cab stood in the drive; a tall, elderly man
was gravely talking in the hall with the parlourmaid we called the
Grenadier. He held a piece of paper in his hand. 'I have called to see
the house,' I heard him say, as I ran up the stairs to Frances, who was
peering like an inquisitive child over the banisters...</p>

<p>'Yes,' she told me with a sigh, I know not whether of resignation or
relief, 'the house is to be let or sold. Mabel has decided. Some
Society or other, I believe--'</p>

<p>I was overjoyed: this made our leaving right and possible. 'You
never told me, Frances!'</p>

<p>'Mabel only heard of it a few days ago. She told me herself this
morning. It is a chance, she says. Alone she cannot get it
"straight".</p>

<p>'Defeat?' I asked, watching her closely.</p>

<p>'She thinks she has found a way out. It's not a family, you see,
it's a Society, a sort of Community--they go in for thought--'</p>

<p>'A Community!' I gasped. 'You mean religious?'</p>

<p>She shook her head. 'Not exactly,' she said smiling, 'but some kind
of association of men and women who want a headquarters in the
country--a place where they can write and meditate--think--mature their
plans and all the rest--I don't know exactly what.'</p>

<p>'Utopian dreamers?' I asked, yet feeling an immense relief come over
me as I heard. But I asked in ignorance, not cynically. Frances would
know. She knew all this kind of thing.</p>

<p>'No, not that exactly,' she smiled. 'Their teachings are grand and
simple-old as the world too, really--the basis of every religion before
men's minds perverted them with their manufactured creeds--'</p>

<p>Footsteps on the stairs, and the sound of voices, interrupted our
odd impromptu conversation, as the Grenadier came up, followed by the
tall, grave gentleman who was being shown over the house. My sister
drew me along the corridor towards her room, where she went in and
closed the door behind me, yet not before I had stolen a good look at
the caller--long enough, at least, for his face and general appearance
to have made a definite impression on me. For something strong and
peaceful emanated from his presence; he moved with such quiet dignity;
the glance of his eyes was so steady and reassuring, that my mind
labelled him instantly as a type of man one would turn to in an
emergency and not be disappointed. I had seen him but for a passing
moment, but I had seen him twice, and the way he walked down the
passage, looking competently about him, conveyed the same impression as
when I saw him standing at the door--fearless, tolerant, wise. 'A
sincere and kindly character,' I judged instantly, 'a man whom some big
kind of love has trained in sweetness towards the world; no hate in him
anywhere.' A great deal, no doubt, to read in so brief a glance! Yet
his voice confirmed my intuition, a deep and very gentle voice, great
firmness in it too.</p>

<p>'Have I become suddenly sensitive to people's atmospheres in this
extraordinary fashion?' I asked myself, smiling, as I stood in the room
and heard the door close behind me. 'Have I developed some clairvoyant
faculty here?' At any other time I should have mocked.</p>

<p>And I sat down and faced my sister, feeling strangely comforted and
at peace for the first time since I had stepped beneath The Towers'
roof a month ago. Frances, I then saw, was smiling a little as she
watched me.</p>

<p>'You know him?' I asked.</p>

<p>'You felt it too?' was her question in reply. 'No,' she added, 'I
don't know him--beyond the fact that he is a leader in the Movement and
has devoted years and money to its objects. Mabel felt the same thing
in him that you have felt--and jumped at it.'</p>

<p>'But you've seen him before?' I urged, for the certainty was in me
that he was no stranger to her.</p>

<p>She shook her head. 'He called one day early this week, when you
were out. Mabel saw him. I believe--' she hesitated a moment, as though
expecting me to stop her with my usual impatience of such subjects--'I
believe he has explained everything to her--the beliefs he embodies,
she declares, are her salvation--might be, rather, if she could adopt
them.'</p>

<p>'Conversion again!' For I remembered her riches, and how gladly a
Society would gobble them.</p>

<p>'The layers I told you about,' she continued calmly, shrugging her
shoulders slightly--'the deposits that are left behind by strong
thinking and real belief--but especially by ugly, hateful belief,
because, you see--unfortunately there's more vital passion in that
sort--'</p>

<p>'Frances, I don't understand a bit,' I said out loud, but said it a
little humbly, for the impression the man had left was still strong
upon me and I was grateful for the steady sense of peace and comfort he
had somehow introduced. The horrors had been so dreadful. My nerves,
doubtless, were more than a little overstrained. Absurd as it must
sound, I classed him in my mind with the robins, the happy, confiding
robins who believed in everybody and thought no evil! I laughed a
moment at my ridiculous idea, and my sister, encouraged by this sign of
patience in me, continued more fluently.</p>

<p>'Of course you don't understand, Bill? Why should you? You've never
thought about such things. Needing no creed yourself, you think all
creeds are rubbish.'</p>

<p>'I'm open to conviction--I'm tolerant,' I interrupted.</p>

<p>'You're as narrow as Sam Franklyn, and as crammed with prejudice,'
she answered, knowing that she had me at her mercy.</p>

<p>'Then, pray, what may be his, or his Society's beliefs?' I asked,
feeling no desire to argue. 'And how are they going to prove your
Mabel's salvation? Can they bring beauty into all this aggressive hate
and ugliness?'</p>

<p>'Certain hope and peace,' she said, 'that peace which is
understanding, and that understanding which explains all creeds and
therefore tolerates them.'</p>

<p>'Toleration! The one word a religous man loathes above all others!
His pet word is damnation--'</p>

<p>'Tolerates them,' she repeated patiently, unperturbed by my
explosion, 'because it includes them all.'</p>

<p>'Fine, if true' I admitted, 'very fine. But how, pray, does it
include them all?'</p>

<p>'Because the key-word, the motto, of their Society is, "There is no
religion higher than Truth," and it has no single dogma of any kind.
Above all,' she went on, 'because it claims that no individual can be
"lost." It teaches universal salvation. To damn outsiders is
uncivilised, childish, impure. Some take longer than others--it's
according to the way they think and live--but all find peace, through
development, in the end. What the creeds call a hopeless soul, it
regards as a soul having further to go. There is no damnation--'</p>

<p>'Well, well,' I exclaimed, feeling that she rode her hobby horse too
wildly, too roughly over me, 'but what is the bearing of all this upon
this dreadful place, and upon Mabel? I'll admit that there is this
atmosphere--this--er--inexplicable horror in the house and grounds, and
that if not of damnation exactly, it is certainly damnable. I'm not too
prejudiced to deny that, for I've felt it myself.'</p>

<p>To my relief she was brief. She made her statement, leaving me to
take it or reject it as I would.</p>

<p>'The thought and belief its former occupants--have left behind. For
there has been coincidence here, a coincidence that must be rare. The
site on which this modern house now stands was Roman, before that Early
Britain, with burial mounds, before that again, Druid--the Druid stones
still lie in that copse below the field, the Tumuli among the ilexes
behind the drive.</p>

<p>The older building Sam Franklyn altered and practically pulled down
was a monastery; he changed the chapel into a meeting hall, which is
now the music-room; but, before he came here, the house was occupied by
Manetti, a violent Catholic without tolerance or vision; and in the
interval between these two, Julius Weinbaum had it, Hebrew of most
rigid orthodox type imaginable--so they all have left their--'</p>

<p>'Even so,' I repeated, yet interested to hear the rest, 'what of
it?'</p>

<p>'Simply this,' said Frances with conviction, 'that each in turn has
left his layer of concentrated thinking and belief behind him; because
each believed intensely, absolutely, beyond the least weakening of any
doubt--the kind of strong belief and thinking that is rare anywhere
to-day, the kind that wills, impregnates objects, saturates the
atmosphere, haunts, in a word. And each, believing he was utterly and
finally right, damned with equally positive conviction the rest of the
world. One and all preached that implicitly if not explicitly. It's the
root of every creed. Last of the bigoted, grim series came Samuel
Franklyn.'</p>

<p>I listened in amazement that increased as she went on. Up to this
point her explanation was so admirable. It was, indeed, a pretty study
in psychology if it were true.</p>

<p>'Then why does nothing ever happen?' I enquired mildly. 'A place so
thickly haunted ought to produce a crop of no ordinary results!'</p>

<p>'There lies the proof,' she went on in a lowered voice, 'the proof
of the horror and the ugly reality. The thought and belief of each
occupant in turn kept all the others under. They gave no sign of life
at the time. But the results of thinking never die. They crop out again
the moment there's an opening. And, with the return of Mabel in her
negative state, believing nothing positive herself the place for the
first time found itself free to reproduce its buried stores.</p>

<p>Damnation, hell-fire, and the rest--the most permanent and vital
thought of all those creeds, since it was applied to the majority of
the world--broke loose again, for there was no restraint to hold it
back. Each sought to obtain its former supremacy. None conquered. There
results a pandemonium of hate and fear, of striving to escape, of
agonised, bitter warring to find safety, peace--salvation. The place is
saturated by that appalling stream of thinking--the terror of the
damned. It concentrated upon Mabel, whose negative attitude furnished
the channel of deliverance.</p>

<p>You and I, according to our sympathy with her, were similarly
involved. Nothing happened, because no one layer could ever gain the
supremacy.'</p>

<p>I was so interested--I dare not say amused--that I stared in silence
while she paused a moment, afraid that she would draw rein and end the
fairy tale too soon.</p>

<p>'The beliefs of this man, of his Society rather, vigorously thought
and therefore vigorously given out here, will put the whole place
straight. It will act as a solvent. These vitriolic layers actively
denied, will fuse and disappear in the stream of gentle, tolerant
sympathy which is love.</p>

<p>For each member, worthy of the name, loves the world, and all creeds
go into the melting-pot; Mabel, too, if she joins them out of real
conviction, will find salvation--'</p>

<p>'Thinking, I know, is of the first importance,' I objected, 'but
don't you, perhaps, exaggerate the power of feeling and emotion which
in religion are au fond always hysterical?'</p>

<p>'What is the world,' she told me, 'but thinking and feeling? An
individual's world is entirely what that individual thinks and
believes--interpretation. There is no other. And unless he really
thinks and really believes, he has no permanent world at all. I grant
that few people think, and still fewer believe, and that most take
ready-made suits and make them do. Only the strong make their own
things; the lesser fry, Mabel among them, are merely swept up into what
has been manufactured for them. They get along somehow. You and I have
made for ourselves, Mabel has not. She is a nonentity, and when her
belief is taken from her, she goes with it.'</p>

<p>It was not in me just then to criticise the evasion, or pick out the
sophistry from the truth. I merely waited for her to continue.</p>

<p>'None of us have Truth, my dear Frances,' I ventured presently,
seeing that she kept silent.</p>

<p>'Precisely,' she answered, 'but most of us have beliefs. And what
one believes and thinks affects the world at large. Consider the legacy
of hatred and cruelty involved in the doctrines men have built into
their creeds where the sine qua non of salvation is absolute acceptance
of one particular set of views or else perishing everlastingly--for
only by repudiating history can they disavow it--'</p>

<p>'You're not quite accurate,' I put in. 'Not all the creeds teach
damnation, do they? Franklyn did, of course, but the others are a bit
modernised now surely?'</p>

<p>'Trying to get out of it,' she admitted, 'perhaps they are, but
damnation of unbelievers--of most of the world, that is--is their
rather favourite idea if you talk with them.'</p>

<p>'I never have.'</p>

<p>She smiled. 'But I have,' she said significantly, 'so, if you
consider what the various occupants of this house have so strongly held
and thought and believed, you need not be surprised that the influence
they have left behind them should be a dark and dreadful legacy. For
thought, you know, does leave--'</p>

<p>The opening of the door, to my great relief, interrupted her, as the
Grenadier led in the visitor to see the room. He bowed to both of us
with a brief word of apology, looked round him, and withdrew, and with
his departure the conversation between us came naturally to an end. I
followed him out. Neither of us in any case, I think, cared to argue
further.</p>

<p>And, so far as I am aware, the curious history of The Towers ends
here too. There was no climax in the story sense. Nothing ever really
happened. We left next morning for London. I only know that the Society
in question took the house and have since occupied it to their entire
satisfaction, and that Mabel, who became a member shortly afterwards,
now stays there frequently when in need of repose from the arduous and
unselfish labours she took upon herself under its aegis. She dined with
us only the other night, here in our tiny Chelsea flat, and a jollier,
saner, more interesting and happy guest I could hardly wish for. She
was vital--in the best sense; the lay-figure had come to life. I found
it difficult to believe she was the same woman whose fearful effigy had
floated down those dreary corridors and almost disappeared in the
depths of that atrocious Shadow.</p>

<p>What her beliefs were now I was wise enough to leave unquestioned,
and Frances, to my great relief, kept the conversation well away from
such inappropriate topics. It was clear, however, that the woman had in
herself some secret source of joy, that she was now an aggressive,
positive force, sure of herself, and apparently afraid of nothing in
heaven or hell. She radiated something very like hope and courage about
her, and talked as though the world were a glorious place and everybody
in it kind and beautiful. Her optimism was certainly infectious.</p>

<p>The Towers were mentioned only in passing. The name of Marsh came
up--not the Marsh, it so happened, but a name in some book that was
being discussed--and I was unable to restrain myself. Curiosity was too
strong. I threw out a casual enquiry Mabel could leave unanswered if
she wished. But there was no desire to avoid it. Her reply was frank
and smiling.</p>

<p>'Would you believe it? She married,' Mabel told me, though obviously
surprised that I remembered the housekeeper at all; 'and is happy as
the day is long. She's found her right niche in life. A sergeant--'</p>

<p>'The army!' I ejaculated.</p>

<p>'Salvation Army,' she explained merrily.</p>

<p>Frances exchanged a glance with me. I laughed too, for the
information took me by surprise. I cannot say why exactly, but I
expected at least to hear that the woman had met some dreadful end, not
impossibly by burning.</p>

<p>'And The Towers, now called the Rest House,' Mabel chattered on,
'seems to me the most peaceful and delightful spot in England--'</p>

<p>'Really,' I said politely.</p>

<p>'When I lived there in the old days--while you were there, perhaps,
though I won't be sure,' Mabel went on, 'the story got abroad that it
was haunted. Wasn't it odd? A less likely place for a ghost I've never
seen. Why, it had no atmosphere at all.' She said this to Frances,
glancing up at me with a smile that apparently had no hidden meaning.
'Did you notice anything queer about it when you were there?'</p>

<p>This was plainly addressed to me.</p>

<p>'I found it--er--difficult to settle down to anything,' I said,
after an instant's hesitation. 'I couldn't work there--'</p>

<p>'But I thought you wrote that wonderful book on the Deaf and Blind
while you stayed with me,' she asked innocently.</p>

<p>I stammered a little. 'Oh no, not then. I only made a few
notes--er--at The Towers. My mind, oddly enough, refused to produce at
all down there. But--why do you ask? Did anything--was anything
supposed to happen there?'</p>

<p>She looked searchingly into my eyes a moment before she
answered:</p>

<p>'Not that I know of,' she said simply.</p>

<h2><a name="ch02"></a>Accessory Before The Fact</h2>

<p>At the moorland cross-roads Martin stood examining the sign-post for
several minutes in some bewilderment. The names on the four arms were
not what he expected, distances were not given, and his map, he
concluded with impatience, must be hopelessly out of date. Spreading it
against the post, he stooped to study it more closely. The wind blew
the corners flapping against his face.</p>

<p>The small print was almost indecipherable in the fading light. It
appeared, however--as well as he could make out--that two miles back he
must have taken the wrong turning.</p>

<p>He remembered that turning. The path had looked inviting; he had
hesitated a moment, then followed it, caught by the usual lure of
walkers that it "might prove a short cut." The short-cut snare is old
as human nature. For some minutes he studied the sign-post and the map
alternately.</p>

<p>Dusk was falling, and his knapsack had grown heavy. He could not
make the two guides tally, however, and a feeling of uncertainty crept
over his mind. He felt oddly baffled, frustrated. His thought grew
thick. Decision was most difficult. "I'm muddled," he thought; "I must
be tired," as at length he chose the most likely arm. "Sooner or later
it will bring me to an inn, though not the one I intended." He accepted
his walker's luck, and started briskly. The arm read, "Over Litacy
Hill" in small, fine letters that danced and shifted every time he
looked at them; but the name was not discoverable on the map. It was,
however, inviting like the short cut. A similar impulse again directed
his choice. Only this time it seemed more insistent, almost urgent.</p>

<p>And he became aware, then, of the exceeding loneliness of the
country about him. The road for a hundred yards went straight, then
curved like a white river running into space; the deep blue-green of
heather lined the banks, spreading upwards through the twilight; and
occasional small pines stood solitary here and there, all unexplained.
The curious adjective, having made its appearance, haunted him. So many
things that afternoon were similarly--unexplained: the short cut, the
darkened map, the names on the sign-post, his own erratic impulses, and
the growing strange confusion that crept upon his spirit. The entire
country-side needed explanation, though perhaps "interpretation" was
the truer word. Those little lonely trees had made him see it. Why had
he lost his way so easily? Why did he suffer vague impressions to
influence his direction? Why was he here--exactly here? And why did he
go now "over Litacy Hill"? Then, by a green field that shone like a
thought of daylight amid the darkness of the moor, he saw a figure
lying in the grass. It was a blot upon the landscape, a mere huddled
patch of dirty rags, yet with a certain horrid picturesqueness too; and
his mind--though his German was of the schoolroom order--at once picked
out the German equivalents as against the English. Lump and Lumpen
flashed across his brain most oddly. They seemed in that moment right,
and so expressive, almost like onomatopoeic words, if that were
possible of sight. Neither "rags" nor "rascal" would have fitted what
he saw. The adequate description was in German.</p>

<p>Here was a clue tossed up by the part of him that did not reason.
But it seems he missed it.</p>

<p>And the next minute the tramp rose to a sitting posture and asked
the time of evening. In German he asked it. And Martin, answering
without a second's hesitation, gave it, also in German, "halb
sieben"--half-past six. The instinctive guess was accurate. A glance at
his watch when he looked a moment later proved it. He heard the man
say, with the covert insolence of tramps, "T'ank you; much opliged."
For Martin had not shown his watch--another intuition subconsciously
obeyed.</p>

<p>He quickened his pace along that lonely road, a curious jumble of
thoughts and feelings surging through him. He had somehow known the
question would come, and come in German.</p>

<p>Yet it flustered and dismayed him. Another thing had also flustered
and dismayed him. He had expected it in the same queer fashion: it was
right. For when the ragged brown thing rose to ask the question, a part
of it remained lying on the grass--another brown, dirty thing. There
were two tramps. And he saw both faces clearly. Behind the untidy
beards, and below the old slouch hats, he caught the look of
unpleasant, clever faces that watched him closely while he passed.</p>

<p>The eyes followed him. For a second he looked straight into those
eyes, so that he could not fail to know them. And he understood, quite
horridly, that both faces were too sleek, refined, and cunning for
those of ordinary tramps. The men were not really tramps at all. They
were disguised.</p>

<p>"How covertly they watched me!" was his thought, as he hurried along
the darkening road, aware in dead earnestness now of the loneliness and
desolation of the moorland all about him.</p>

<p>Uneasy and distressed, he increased his pace. Midway in thinking
what an unnecessarily clanking noise his nailed boots made upon the
hard white road, there came upon him with a rush together the company
of these things that haunted him as "unexplained." They brought a
single definite message: That all this business was not really meant
for him at all, and hence his confusion and bewilderment; that he had
intruded into someone else's scenery, and was trespassing upon
another's map of life. By some wrong inner turning he had interpolated
his person into a group of foreign forces which operated in the little
world of someone else.</p>

<p>Unwittingly, somewhere, he had crossed the threshold, and now was
fairly in--a trespasser, an eavesdropper, a Peeping Torn. He was
listening, peeping; overhearing things he had no right to know, because
they were intended for another. Like a ship at sea he was intercepting
wireless messages he could not properly interpret, because his Receiver
was not accurately tuned to their reception. And more--these messages
were warnings!</p>

<p>Then fear dropped upon him like the night. He was caught in a net of
delicate, deep forces he could not manage, knowing neither their origin
nor purpose. He had walked into some huge psychic trap elaborately
planned and baited, yet calculated for another than himself. Something
had lured him in, something in the landscape, the time of day, his
mood. Owing to some undiscovered weakness in himself he had been easily
caught. His fear slipped easily into terror.</p>

<p>What happened next happened with such speed and concentration that
it all seemed crammed into a moment. At once and in a heap it happened.
It was quite inevitable. Down the white road to meet him a man came
swaying from side to side in drunkenness quite obviously feigned--a
tramp; and while Martin made room for him to pass, the lurch changed in
a second to attack, and the fellow was upon him. The blow was sudden
and terrific, yet even while it fell Martin was aware that behind him
rushed a second man, who caught his legs from under him and bore him
with a thud and crash to the ground. Blows rained then; he saw a gleam
of something shining; a sudden deadly nausea plunged him into utter
weakness where resistance was impossible.</p>

<p>Something of fire entered his throat, and from his mouth poured a
thick sweet thing that choked him. The world sank far away into
darkness...Yet through all the horror and confusion ran the trail of
two clear thoughts: he realised that the first tramp had sneaked at a
fast double through the heather and so come down to meet him; and that
something heavy was torn from fastenings that clipped it tight and
close beneath his clothes against his body...</p>

<p>Abruptly then the darkness lifted, passed utterly away. He found
himself peering into the map against the signpost. The wind was
flapping the corners against his cheek, and he was poring over names
that now he saw quite clear. Upon the arms of the sign-post above were
those he had expected to find, and the map recorded them quite
faithfully. All was accurate again and as it should be. He read the
name of the village he had meant to make--it was plainly visible in the
dusk, two miles the distance given. Bewildered, shaken, unable to think
of anything, he stuffed the map into his pocket unfolded, and hurried
forward like a man who has just wakened from an awful dream that had
compressed into a single second all the detailed misery of some
prolonged, oppressive nightmare.</p>

<p>He broke into a steady trot that soon became a run; the perspiration
poured from him; his legs felt weak, and his breath was difficult to
manage. He was only conscious of the overpowering desire to get away as
fast as possible from the sign-post at the cross-roads where the
dreadful vision had flashed upon him. For Martin, accountant on a
holiday, had never dreamed of any world of psychic possibilities. The
entire thing was torture. It was worse than a "cooked" balance of the
books that some conspiracy of clerks and directors proved at his
innocent door. He raced as though the country-side ran crying at his
heels. And always still ran with him the incredible conviction that
none of this was really meant for himself at all. He had overheard the
secrets of another. He had taken the warning for another into himself,
and so altered its direction. He had thereby prevented its right
delivery. It all shocked him beyond words. It dislocated the machinery
of his just and accurate soul. The warning was intended for another,
who could not--would not--now receive it.</p>

<p>The physical exertion, however, brought at length a more comfortable
reaction and some measure of composure. With the lights in sight, he
slowed down and entered the village at a reasonable pace. The inn was
reached, a bedroom inspected and engaged, and supper ordered with the
solid comfort of a large Bass to satisfy an unholy thirst and complete
the restoration of balance. The unusual sensations largely passed away,
and the odd feeling that anything in his simple, wholesome world
required explanation was no longer present. Still with a vague
uneasiness about him, though actual fear quite gone, he went into the
bar to smoke an after-supper pipe and chat with the natives, as his
pleasure was upon a holiday, and so saw two men leaning upon the
counter at the far end with their backs towards him. He saw their faces
instantly in the glass, and the pipe nearly slipped from between his
teeth. Clean-shaven, sleek, clever faces--and he caught a word or two
as they talked over their drinks--German words. Well dressed they were,
both men, with nothing about them calling for particular attention;
they might have been two tourists holiday-making like himself in tweeds
and walking-boots. And they presently paid for their drinks and went
out. He never saw them face to face at all; but the sweat broke out
afresh all over him, a feverish rush of heat and ice together ran about
his body; beyond question he recognised the two tramps, this time not
disguised--not yet disguised.</p>

<p>He remained in his corner without moving, puffing violently at an
extinguished pipe, gripped helplessly by the return of that first vile
terror. It came again to him with an absolute clarity of certainty that
it was not with himself they had to do, these men, and, further, that
he had no right in the world to interfere. He had no locus standi at
all; it would be immoral...even if the opportunity came. And the
opportunity, he felt, would come. He had been an eavesdropper, and had
come upon private information of a secret kind that he had no right to
make use of, even that good might come--even to save life. He sat on in
his corner, terrified and silent, waiting for the thing that should
happen next.</p>

<p>But night came without explanation. Nothing happened. He slept
soundly. There was no other guest at the inn but an elderly man,
apparently a tourist like himself. He wore gold-rimmed glasses, and in
the morning Martin overheard him asking the landlord what direction he
should take for Litacy Hill. His teeth began then to chatter and a
weakness came into his knees. "You turn to the left at the
cross-roads," Martin broke in before the landlord could reply; "you'll
see the sign-post about two miles from here, and after that it's a
matter of four miles more." How in the world did he know, flashed
horribly through him. "I'm going that way myself," he was saying next;
"I'll go with you for a bit--if you don't mind!" The words came out
impulsively and ill-considered; of their own accord they came. For his
own direction was exactly opposite.</p>

<p>He did not want the man to go alone. The stranger, however, easily
evaded his offer of companionship. He thanked him with the remark that
he was starting later in the day...They were standing, all three,
beside the horse-trough in front of the inn, when at that very moment a
tramp, slouching along the road, looked up and asked the time of day.
And it was the man with the gold-rimmed glasses who told him.</p>

<p>"T'ank you; much opliged," the tramp replied, passing on with his
slow, slouching gait, while the landlord, a talkative fellow, proceeded
to remark upon the number of Germans that lived in England and were
ready to swell the Teutonic invasion which he, for his part, deemed
imminent.</p>

<p>But Martin heard it not. Before he had gone a mile upon his way he
went into the woods to fight his conscience all alone. His feebleness,
his cowardice, were surely criminal. Real anguish tortured him. A dozen
times he decided to go back upon his steps, and a dozen times the
singular authority that whispered he had no right to interfere
prevented him. How could he act upon knowledge gained by eavesdropping?
How interfere in the private business of another's hidden life merely
because he had overheard, as at the telephone, its secret dangers? Some
inner confusion prevented straight thinking altogether. The stranger
would merely think him mad. He had no "fact" togoupon...He smothered a
hundred impulses...and finally went on his way with a shaking, troubled
heart.</p>

<p>The last two days of his holiday were ruined by doubts and questions
and alarms--all justified later when he read of the murder of a tourist
upon Litacy Hill. The man wore gold-rimmed glasses, and carried in a
belt about his person a large sum of money. His throat was cut.</p>

<p>And the police were hard upon the trail of a mysterious pair of
tramps, said to be--Germans.</p>

<h2><a name="ch03"></a>The Attic</h2>

<p>The forest-girdled village upon the Jura slopes slept soundly,
although it was not yet many minutes after ten o'clock. The clang of
the couvre-feu had indeed just ceased, its notes swept far into the
woods by a wind that shook the mountains. This wind now rushed down the
deserted street. It howled about the old rambling building called La
Citadelle, whose roof towered gaunt and humped above the smaller
houses--Ch&acirc;teau left unfinished long ago by Lord Wemyss, the
exiled Jacobite. The families who occupied the various apartments
listened to the storm and felt the building tremble. 'It's the mountain
wind. It will bring the snow,' the mother said, without looking up from
her knitting. 'And how sad it sounds.'</p>

<p>But it was not the wind that brought sadness as we sat round the
open fire of peat. It was the wind of memories. The lamplight slanted
along the narrow room towards the table where breakfast things lay
ready for the morning. The double windows were fastened. At the far end
stood a door ajar, and on the other side of it the two elder children
lay asleep in the big bed. But beside the window was a smaller unused
bed, that had been empty now a year. And to-night was the
anniversary...</p>

<p>And so the wind brought sadness and long thoughts. The little chap
that used to lie there was already twelve months gone, far, far beyond
the Hole where the Winds came from, as he called it; yet it seemed only
yesterday that I went to tell him a tuck-up story, to stroke Riquette,
the old motherly cat that cuddled against his back and laid a paw
beside his pillow like a human being, and to hear his funny little
earnest whisper say, 'Oncle, tu sais, j'ai pri&eacute; pour Petavel.'
For La Citadelle had its unhappy ghost--of Petavel, the usurer, who had
hanged himself in the attic a century gone by, and was known to walk
its dreary corridors in search of peace--and this wise Irish mother,
calming the boys' fears with wisdom, had told him, 'If you pray for
Petavel, you'll save his soul and make him happy, and he'll only love
you.' And, thereafter, this little imaginative boy had done so every
night. With a passionate seriousness he did it. He had wonderful,
delicate ways like that. In all our hearts he made his fairy nests of
wonder. In my own, I know, he lay closer than any joy imaginable, with
his big blue eyes, his queer soft questionings, and his splendid
child's unselfishness--a sun-kissed flower of innocence that, had he
lived, might have sweetened half a world.</p>

<p>'Let's put more peat on,' the mother said, as a handful of rain like
stones came flinging against the windows; 'that must be hail.' And she
went on tiptoe to the inner room. 'They're sleeping like two puddings,'
she whispered, coming presently back. But it struck me she had taken
longer than to notice merely that; and her face wore an odd expression
that made me uncomfortable. I thought she was somehow just about to
laugh or cry. By the table a second she hesitated. I caught the flash
of indecision as it passed. 'Pan,' she said suddenly--it was a
nickname, stolen from my tuck-up stories, he had given me--'I wonder
how Riquette got in.' She looked hard at me. 'It wasn't you, was it?'
For we never let her come at night since he had gone. It was too
poignant.</p>

<p>The beastie always went cuddling and nestling into that empty bed.
But this time it was not my doing, and I offered plausible
explanations. 'But--she's on the bed. Pan, would you be so kind--' She
left the sentence unfinished, but I easily understood, for a lump had
somehow risen in my own throat too, and I remembered now that she had
come out from the inner room so quickly--with a kind of hurried rush
almost. I put 'm&egrave;re Riquette' out into the corridor. A lamp
stood on the chair outside the door of another occupant further down,
and I urged her gently towards it.</p>

<p>She turned and looked at me--straight up into my face; but, instead
of going down as I suggested, she went slowly in the opposite
direction. She stepped softly towards a door in the wall that led up
broken stairs into the attics. There she sat down and waited. And so I
left her, and came back hastily to the peat fire and companionship. The
wind rushed in behind me and slammed the door.</p>

<p>And we talked then somewhat busily of cheerful things; of the
children's future, the excellence of the cheap Swiss schools, of
Christmas presents, ski-ing, snow, tobogganing. I led the talk away
from mournfulness; and when these subjects were exhausted I told
stories of my own adventures in distant parts of the world. But
'mother' listened the whole time--not to me. Her thoughts were all
elsewhere. And her air of intently, secretly listening, bordered, I
felt, upon the uncanny. For she often stopped her knitting and sat with
her eyes fixed upon the air before her; she stared blankly at the wall,
her head slightly on one side, her figure tense, attention
strained--elsewhere. Or, when my talk positively demanded it, her nod
was oddly mechanical and her eyes looked through and past me. The wind
continued very loud and roaring; but the fire glowed, the room was warm
and cosy. Yet she shivered, and when I drew attention to it, her reply,
'I do feel cold, but I didn't know I shivered,' was given as though she
spoke across the air to some one else. But what impressed me even more
uncomfortably were her repeated questions about Riquette. When a pause
in my tales permitted, she would look up with 'I wonder where Riquette
went?' or, thinking of the inclement night, 'I hope m&egrave;re
Riquette's not out of doors. Perhaps Madame Favre has taken her in?' I
offered to go and see. Indeed I was already half-way across the room
when there came the heavy bang at the door that rooted me to the ground
where I stood.</p>

<p>It was not wind. It was something alive that made it rattle. There
was a second blow. A thud on the corridor boards followed, and then a
high, odd voice that at first was as human as the cry of a child.</p>

<p>It is undeniable that we both started, and for myself I can answer
truthfully that a chill ran down my spine; but what frightened me more
than the sudden noise and the eerie cry was the way 'mother' supplied
the immediate explanation. For behind the words 'It's only Riquette;
she sometimes springs at the door like that; perhaps we'd better let
her in,' was a certain touch of uncanny quiet that made me feel she had
known the cat would come, and knew also why she came. One cannot
explain such impressions further. They leave their vital touch, then go
their way. Into the little room, however, in that moment there came
between us this uncomfortable sense that the night held other purposes
than our own--and that my companion was aware of them. There was
something going on far, far removed from the routine of life as we were
accustomed to it. Moreover, our usual routine was the eddy, while this
was the main stream. It felt big, I mean.</p>

<p>And so it was that the entrance of the familiar, friendly creature
brought this thing both itself and 'mother' knew, but whereof I as yet
was ignorant. I held the door wide. The draught rushed through behind
her, and sent a shower of sparks about the fireplace. The lamp
flickered and gave a little gulp. And Riquette marched slowly past,
with all the impressive dignity of her kind, towards the other door
that stood ajar. Turning the corner like a shadow, she disappeared into
the room where the two children slept. We heard the soft thud with
which she leaped upon the bed.</p>

<p>Then, in a lull of the wind, she came back again and sat on the
oilcloth, staring into mother's' face. She mewed and put a paw out,
drawing the black dress softly with half-opened claws. And it was all
so horribly suggestive and pathetic, it revived such poignant memories,
that I got up impulsively--I think I had actually said the words, 'We'd
better put her out, mother, after all'--.when my companion rose to her
feet and orestalled me. She said another thing instead. It took my
breath away to hear it. 'She wants us to go with her. Pan, will you
come too?' The surprise on my face must have asked the question, for I
do not remember saying anything. 'To the attic,' she said quietly.</p>

<p>She stood there by the table, a tall, grave figure dressed in black,
and her face above the lamp-shade caught the full glare of light. Its
expression positively stiffened me. She seemed so secure in her
singular purpose. And her familiar appearance had so oddly given place
to something wholly strange to me. She looked like another
person--almost with the unwelcome transformation of the sleep-walker
about her. Cold came over me as I watched her, for I remembered
suddenly her Irish second-sight, her story years ago of meeting a
figure on the attic stairs, the figure of Petavel. And the idea of this
motherly, sedate, and wholesome woman, absorbed day and night in
prosaic domestic duties, and yet 'seeing' things, touched the
incongruous almost to the point of alarm. It was so distressingly
convincing.</p>

<p>Yet she knew quite well that I would come. Indeed, following the
excited animal, she was already by the door, and a moment later, still
without answering or protesting, I was with them in the draughty
corridor. There was something inevitable in her manner that made it
impossible to refuse. She took the lamp from its nail on the wall, and
following our four-footed guide, who ran with obvious pleasure just in
front, she opened the door into the courtyard. The wind nearly put the
lamp out, but a minute later we were safe inside the passage that led
up flights of creaky wooden stairs towards the world of tenantless
attics overhead.</p>

<p>And I shall never forget the way the excited Riquette first stood up
and put her paws upon the various doors, trotted ahead, turned back to
watch us coming, and then finally sat down and waited on the threshold
of the empty, raftered space that occupied the entire length of the
building underneath the roof. For her manner was more that of an
intelligent dog than of a cat, and sometimes more like that of a human
mind than either.</p>

<p>We had come up without a single word. The howling of the wind as we
rose higher was like the roar of artillery. There were many broken
stairs, and the narrow way was full of twists and turnings. It was a
dreadful journey. I felt eyes watching us from all the yawning spaces
of the darkness, and the noise of the storm smothered footsteps
everywhere. Troops of shadows kept us company. But it was on the
threshold of this big, chief attic, when 'mother' stopped abruptly to
put down the lamp, that real fear took hold of me. For Riquette marched
steadily forward into the middle of the dusty flooring, picking her way
among the fallen tiles and mortar, as though she went towards--some
one. She purred loudly and uttered little cries of excited pleasure.
Her tail went up into the air, and she lowered her head with the
unmistakable intention of being stroked.</p>

<p>Her lips opened and shut. Her green eyes smiled. She was being
stroked.</p>

<p>It was an unforgettable performance. I would rather have witnessed
an execution or a murder than watch that mysterious creature twist and
turn about in the way she did. Her magnified shadow was as large as a
pony on the floor and rafters. I wanted to hide the whole thing by
extinguishing the lamp. For, even before the mysterious action began, I
experienced the sudden rush of conviction that others besides ourselves
were in this attic--and standing very close to us indeed. And, although
there was ice in my blood, there was also a strange swelling of the
heart that only love and tenderness could bring.</p>

<p>But, whatever it was, my human companion, still silent, knew and
understood. She saw. And her soft whisper that ran with the wind among
the rafters, 'Il a pri&eacute; pour Petavel et le bon Dieu l'a
entendu,' did not amaze me one quarter as much as the expression I then
caught upon her radiant face. Tears ran down the cheeks, but they were
tears of happiness. Her whole figure seemed lit up. She opened her
arms--picture of great Motherhood, proud, blessed, and tender beyond
words. I thought she was going to fall, for she took quick steps
forward; but when I moved to catch her, she drew me aside instead with
a sudden gesture that brought fear back in the place of wonder.</p>

<p>'Let them pass,' she whispered grandly. 'Pan, don't you see...He's
leading him into peace and safety...by the hand I' And her joy seemed
to kill the shadows and fill the entire attic with white light. Then,
almost simultaneously with her words, she swayed. I was in time to
catch her, but as I did so, across the very spot where we had just been
standing--two figures, I swear, went past us like a flood of light.</p>

<p>There was a moment next of such confusion that I did not see what
happened to Riquette, for the sight of my companion kneeling on the
dusty boards and praying with a curious sort of passionate happiness,
while tears pressed between her covering fingers--the strange wonder of
this made me utterly oblivious to minor details...</p>

<p>We were sitting round the peat fire again, and 'mother' was saying
to me in the gentlest, tenderest whisper I ever heard from human
lips--'Pan, I think perhaps that's why God took him...'</p>

<p>And when a little later we went in to make Riquette cosy in the
empty bed, ever since kept sacred to her use, the mournfulness had
lifted; and in the place of resignation was proud peace and joy that
knew no longer sad or selfish questionings.</p>

<h2><a name="ch04"></a>Clairvoyance</h2>

<p>In the darkest corner, where the firelight could not reach him, he
sat listening to the stories. His young hostess occupied the corner on
the other side; she was also screened by shadows; and between them
stretched the horse-shoe of eager, frightened faces that seemed all
eyes. Behind yawned the blackness of the big room, running as it were
without a break into the night.</p>

<p>Some one crossed on tiptoe and drew a blind up with a rattle, and at
the sound all started: through the window, opened at the top, came a
rustle of the poplar leaves that stirred like footsteps in the wind.
'There's a strange man walking past the shrubberies,' whispered a
nervous girl; 'I saw him crouch and hide. I saw his eyes!' 'Nonsense!
came sharply from a male member of the group; 'it's far too dark to
see. You heard the wind.' For mist had risen from the river just below
the lawn, pressing close against the windows of the old house like a
soft grey hand, and through it the stir of leaves was faintly
audible...Then, while several called for lights, others remembered that
hop-pickers were still about in the lanes, and the tramps this autumn
overbold and insolent. All, perhaps, wished secretly for the sun. Only
the elderly man in the corner sat quiet and unmoved, contributing
nothing. He had told no fearsome story. He had evaded, indeed, many
openings expressly made for him, though fully aware that to his
well-known interest in psychical things was partly due his presence in
the week-end party. 'I never have experiences--that way,' he said
shortly when some one asked him point blank for a tale; 'I have no
unusual powers.' There was perhaps the merest hint of contempt in his
tone, but the hostess from her darkened corner quickly and tactfully
covered his retreat. And he wondered. For he knew why she invited him.
The haunted room, he was well aware, had been specially allotted to
him.</p>

<p>And then, most opportunely, the door opened noisily and the host
came in. He sniffed at the darkness, rang at once for lamps, puffed at
his big curved pipe, and generally, by his mere presence, made the
group feel rather foolish. Light streamed past him from the corridor.
His white hair shone like silver. And with him came the atmosphere of
common sense, of shooting, agriculture, motors, and the rest. Age
entered at that door. And his young wife sprang up instantly to greet
him, as though his disapproval of this kind of entertainment might need
humouring.</p>

<p>It may have been the light--that witchery of half-lights from the
fire and the corridor, or it may have been the abrupt entrance of the
Practical upon the soft Imaginative that traced the outline with such
pitiless, sharp conviction. At any rate, the contrast--for those who
had this inner clairvoyant sight all had been prating of so
glibly!--was unmistakably revealed. It was poignantly dramatic, pain
somewhere in it--naked pain. For, as she paused a moment there beside
him in the light, this childless wife of three years' standing, picture
of youth and beauty, there stood upon the threshold of that room the
presence of a true ghost story.</p>

<p>And most marevellously she changed--her lineaments, her very figure,
her whole presentment. Etched against the gloom, the delicate, unmarked
face shone suddenly keen and anguished, and a rich maturity, deeper
than any mere age, flushed all her little person with its secret
grandeur. Lines started into being upon the pale skin of the girlish
face, lines of pleading, pity, and love the daylight did not show, and
with them an air of magic tenderness that betrayed, though for a second
only, the full soft glory of a motherhood denied, yet somehow
mysteriously enjoyed. About her slenderness rose all the deep-bosomed
sweetness of maternity, a potential mother of the world, and a mother,
though she might know no dear fulfilment, who yet yearned to sweep into
her immense embrace all the little helpless things that ever lived.</p>

<p>Light, like emotion, can play strangest tricks. The change pressed
almost upon the edge of revelation...Yet, when a moment later lamps
were brought, it is doubtful if any but the silent guest who had told
no marvellous tale, knew no psychical experience, and disclaimed the
smallest clairvoyant faculty, had received and registered the vivid,
poignant picture. For an instant it had flashed there, mercilessly
clear for all to see who were not blind to subtle spiritual wonder
thick with pain. And it was not so much mere picture of youth and age
ill-matched, as of youth that yearned with the oldest craving in the
world, and of age that had slipped beyond the power of sympathetically
divining it...It passed, and all was as before.</p>

<p>The husband laughed with genial good-nature, not one whit annoyed.
'They've been frightening you with stories, child,' he said in his
jolly way, and put a protective arm about her.</p>

<p>'Haven't they now? Tell me the truth. Much better,' he added, 'have
joined me instead at billiards, or for a game of Patience, eh?' She
looked up shyly into his face, and he kissed her on the forehead.
'Perhaps they have--a little, dear,' she said, 'but now that you've
come, I feel all right again.' 'Another night of this,' he added in a
graver tone, 'and you'd be at your old trick of putting guests to sleep
in the haunted room. I was right after all, you see, to make it out of
bounds.' He glanced fondly, paternally down upon her. Then he went over
and poked the fire into a blaze. Some one struck up a waltz on the
piano, and couples danced. All trace of nervousness vanished, and the
butler presently brought in the tray with drinks and biscuits. And
slowly the group dispersed. Candles were lit. They passed down the
passage into the big hall, talking in lowered voices of to-morrow's
plans. The laughter died away as they went up the stairs to bed, the
silent guest and the young wife lingering a moment over the embers.</p>

<p>'You have not, after all then, put me in your haunted room?' he
asked quietly. 'You mentioned, you remember, in your letter--'</p>

<p>'I admit,' she replied at once, her manner gracious beyond her
years, her voice quite different, 'that I wanted you to sleep
there--some one, I mean, who really knows, and is not merely curious.
But--forgive my saying so--when I saw you'--she laughed very
slowly--'and when you told no marvellous story like the others, I
somehow felt--'</p>

<p>'But I never see anything--' he put in hurriedly.</p>

<p>'You feel, though,' she interrupted swiftly, the passionate
tenderness in her voice but half suppressed. 'I can tell it from
your--'</p>

<p>'Others, then,' he interrupted abruptly, almost bluntly, 'have slept
there--sat up, rather?'</p>

<p>'Not recently. My husband stopped it.' She paused a second, then
added, 'I had that room--for a year--when first we married.'</p>

<p>The other's anguished look flew back upon her little face like a
shadow and was gone, while at the sight of it there rose in himself a
sudden deep rush of wonderful amazement beckoning almost towards
worship. He did not speak, for his voice would tremble.</p>

<p>'I had to give it up,' she finished, very low.</p>

<p>'Was it so terrible?' after a pause he ventured.</p>

<p>She bowed her head. 'I had to change,' she repeated softly.</p>

<p>'And since then--now--you see nothing?' he asked.</p>

<p>Her reply was singular. 'Because I will not, not because it's gone.'
...He followed her in silence to the door, and as they passed along the
passage, again that curious great pain of emptiness, of loneliness, of
yearning rose upon him, as of a sea that never, never can swim beyond
the shore to reach the flowers that it loves...'Hurry up, child, or a
ghost will catch you,' cried her husband, leaning over the banisters,
as the pair moved slowly up the stairs towards him. There was a
moment's silence when they met.</p>

<p>The guest took his lighted candle and went down the corridor.
Good-nights were said again.</p>

<p>They moved away, she to her loneliness, he to his unhaunted room.
And at his door he turned. At the far end of the passage, silhouetted
against the candle-light, he watched them--the fine old man with his
silvered hair and heavy shoulders, and the slim young wife with that
amazing air as of some great bountiful mother of the world for whom the
years yet passed hungry and un-harvested.</p>

<p>They turned the corner, and he went in and closed his door.</p>

<p>Sleep took him very quickly, and while the mist rose up and veiled
the countryside, something else, veiled equally for all other sleepers
in that house but two, drew on towards its climax...</p>

<p>Some hours later he awoke; the world was still and it seemed the
whole house listened; for with that clear vision which some bring out
of sleep, he remembered that there had been no direct denial, and of a
sudden realised that this big, gaunt chamber where he lay was after all
the haunted room. For him, however, the entire world, not merely
separate rooms in it, was ever haunted; and he knew no terror to find
the space about him charged with thronging life quite other than his
own...He rose and lit the candle, crossed over to the window where the
mist shone grey, knowing that no barriers of walls or door or ceiling
could keep out this host of Presences that poured so thickly everywhere
about him. It was like a wall of being, with peering eyes, small hands
stretched out, a thousand pattering wee feet, and tiny voices crying in
a chorus very faintly and beseeching...The haunted room! Was it not,
rather, a temple vestibule, prepared and sanctified by yearning rites
few men might ever guess, for all the childless women of the world? How
could she know that he would understand--this woman he had seen but
twice in all his life? And how entrust to him so great a mystery that
was her secret? Had she so easily divined in him a similar yearning to
which, long years ago, death had denied fulfilment? Was she clairvoyant
in the true sense, and did all faces bear on them so legibly this great
map that sorrow traced?...</p>

<p>And then, with awful suddenness, mere feelings dipped away, and
something concrete happened. The handle of the door had faintly
rattled. He turned. The round brass knob was slowly moving. And first,
at the sight, something of common fear did grip him, as though his
heart had missed a beat, but on the instant he heard the voice of his
own mother, now long beyond the stars, calling to him to go softly yet
with speed. He watched a moment the feeble efforts to undo the door,
yet never afterwards could swear that he saw actual movement, for
something in him, tragic as blindness, rose through a mist of tears and
darkened vision utterly...</p>

<p>He went towards the door. He took the handle very gently, and very
softly then he opened it.</p>

<p>Beyond was darkness. He saw the empty passage, the edge of the
banisters where the great hall yawned below, and, dimly, the outline of
the Alpine photograph and the stuffed deer's head upon the wall. And
then he dropped upon his knees and opened wide his arms to something
that came in upon uncertain, viewless feet. All the young winds and
flowers and dews of dawn passed with it...filling him to the brim
...covering closely his breast and eyes and lips. There clung to him
all the small beginnings of life that cannot stand alone...the little
helpless hands and arms that have no confidence...and when the wealth
of tears and love that flooded his heart seemed to break upon the
frontiers of some mysterious yet impossible fulfilment, he rose and
went with curious small steps towards the window to taste the cooling,
misty air of that other dark Emptiness that waited so patiently there
above the entire world. He drew the sash up. The air felt soft and
tender as though there were somewhere children in it too--children of
stars and flowers, of mists and wings and music, all that the Universe
contains unborn and tiny...And when at length he turned again the door
was closed. The room was empty of any life but that which lay so
wonderfully blessed within himself. And this, he felt, had marvelously
increased and multiplied...</p>

<p>Sleep then came back to him, and in the morning he left the house
before the others were astir, pleading some overlooked engagement. For
he had seen Ghosts indeed, but yet no ghost that he could talk about
with others round an open fire.</p>

<h2><a name="ch05"></a>An Egyptian Hornet</h2>

<p>The word has an angry, malignant sound that brings the idea of
attack vividly into the mind. There is a vicious sting about it
somewhere--even a foreigner, ignorant of the meaning, must feel it. A
hornet is wicked; it darts and stabs; it pierces, aiming without
provocation for the face and eyes. The name suggests a metallic droning
of evil wings, fierce flight, and poisonous assault. Though black and
yellow, it sounds scarlet. There is blood in it. A striped tiger of the
air in concentrated form! There is no escape--if it attacks.</p>

<p>In Egypt an ordinary bee is the size of an English hornet, but the
Egyptian hornet is enormous. It is truly monstrous--an ominous, dying
terror. It shares that universal quality of the land of the Sphinx and
Pyramids--great size. It is a formidable insect, worse than scorpion or
tarantula. The Rev. James Milligan, meeting one for the first time,
realized the meaning of another word as well, a word he used
prolifically in his eloquent sermons--devil.</p>

<p>One morning in April, when the heat began to bring the insects out,
he rose as usual betimes and went across the wide stone corridor to his
bath. The desert already glared in through the open windows. The heat
would be afflicting later in the day, but at this early hour the cool
north wind blew pleasantly down the hotel passages. It was Sunday, and
at half-past eight o'clock he would appear to conduct the morning
service for the English visitors. The floor of the passage-way was cold
beneath his feet in their thin native slippers of bright yellow. He was
neither young nor old; his salary was comfortable; he had a competency
of his own, without wife or children to absorb it; the dry climate had
been recommended to him; and--the big hotel took him in for next to
nothing. And he was thoroughly pleased with himself, for he was a
sleek, vain, pompous, well-advertised personality, but mean as a rat.
No worries of any kind were on his mind as, carrying sponge and towel,
scented soap and a bottle of Scrubb's ammonia, he travelled amiably
across the deserted, shining corridor to the bathroom. And nothing went
wrong with the Rev. James Milligan until he opened the door, and his
eye fell upon a dark, suspicious-looking object clinging to the
window-pane in front of him.</p>

<p>And even then, at first, he felt no anxiety or alarm, but merely a
natural curiosity to know exactly what it was--this little clot of an
odd-shaped, elongated thing that stuck there on the wooden framework
six feet before his aquiline nose. He went straight up to it to
see--then stopped dead. His heart gave a distinct, unclerical leap. His
lips formed themselves into unregenerate shape. He gasped: "Good God!
What is it?" For something unholy, something wicked as a secret sin,
stuck there before his eyes in the patch of blazing sunshine. He caught
his breath.</p>

<p>For a moment he was unable to move, as though the sight half
fascinated him. Then, cautiously and very slowly--stealthily, in
fact--he withdrew towards the door he had just entered. Fearful of
making the smallest sound, he retraced his steps on tiptoe. His yellow
slippers shuffled. His dry sponge fell, and bounded till it settled,
rolling close beneath the horribly attractive object facing him. From
the safety of the open door, with ample space for retreat behind him,
he paused and stared. His entire being focussed itself in his eyes. It
was a hornet that he saw. It hung there, motionless and threatening,
between him and the bathroom door.</p>

<p>And at first he merely exclaimed--below his breath--"Good God! It's
an Egyptian hornet!"</p>

<p>Being a man with a reputation for decided action, however, he soon
recovered himself. He was well schooled in self-control. When people
left his church at the beginning of the sermon, no muscle of his face
betrayed the wounded vanity and annoyance that burned deep in his
heart. But a hornet sitting directly in his path was a very different
matter. He realized in a flash that he was poorly clothed--in a word,
that he was practically half naked.</p>

<p>From a distance he examined this intrusion of the devil. It was calm
and very still. It was wonderfully made, both before and behind. Its
wings were folded upon its terrible body. Long, sinuous things, pointed
like temptation, barbed as well, stuck out of it. There was poison, and
yet grace, in its exquisite presentment. Its shiny black was beautiful,
and the yellow stripes upon its sleek, curved abdomen were like the
gleaming ornaments upon some feminine body of the seductive world he
preached against. Almost, he saw an abandoned dancer on the stage. And
then, swiftly in his impressionable soul, the simile changed, and he
saw instead more blunt and aggressive forms of destruction. The
well-filled body, tapering to a horrid point, reminded him of those
perfect engines of death that reduce hundreds to annihilation
unawares--torpedoes, shells, projectiles, crammed with secret,
desolating powers. Its wings, its awful, quiet head, its delicate, slim
waist, its stripes of brilliant saffron--all these seemed the
concentrated prototype of abominations made cleverly by the brain of
man, and beautifully painted to disguise their invisible freight of
cruel death.</p>

<p>"Bah!" he exclaimed, ashamed of his prolific imagination. "It's only
a hornet after all--an insect!" And he contrived a hurried, careful
plan. He aimed a towel at it, rolled up into a ball--but did not throw
it. He might miss. He remembered that his ankles were unprotected.
Instead, he paused again, examining the black and yellow object in safe
retirement near the door, as one day he hoped to watch the world in
leisurely retirement in the country. It did not move. It was fixed and
terrible. It made no sound. Its wings were folded. Not even the black
antennae, blunt at the tips like clubs, showed the least stir or
tremble. It breathed, however. He watched the rise and fall of the evil
body; it breathed air in and out as he himself did. The creature, he
realized, had lungs and heart and organs. It had a brain! Its mind was
active all this time. It knew it was being watched. It merely waited.
Any second, with a whiz of fury, and with perfect accuracy of aim, it
might dart at him and strike. If he threw the towel and missed--it
certainly would.</p>

<p>There were other occupants of the corridor, however, and a sound of
steps approaching gave him the decision to act. He would lose his bath
if he hesitated much longer. He felt ashamed of his timidity, though
"pusillanimity" was the word thought selected owing to the pulpit
vocabulary it was his habit to prefer. He went with extreme caution
towards the bathroom door, passing the point of danger so close that
his skin turned hot and cold. With one foot gingerly extended, he
recovered his sponge. The hornet did not move a muscle. But--it had
seen him pass. It merely waited. All dangerous insects had that trick.
It knew quite well he was inside; it knew quite well he must come out a
few minutes later; it also knew quite well that he was--naked.</p>

<p>Once inside the little room, he closed the door with exceeding
gentleness, lest the vibration might stir the fearful insect to attack.
The bath was already filled, and he plunged to his neck with a feeling
of comparative security. A window into the outside passage he also
closed, so that nothing could possibly come in. And steam soon charged
the air and left its blurred deposit on the glass. For ten minutes he
could enjoy himself and pretend that he was safe. For ten minutes he
did so. He behaved carelessly, as though nothing mattered, and as
though all the courage in the world were his. He splashed and soaped
and sponged, making a lot of reckless noise. He got out and dried
himself. Slowly the steam subsided, the air grew clearer, he put on
dressing-gown and slippers. It was time to go out.</p>

<p>Unable to devise any further reason for delay, he opened the door
softly half an inch--peeped out--and instantly closed it again with a
resounding bang. He had heard a drone of wings. The insect had left its
perch and now buzzed upon the floor directly in his path. The air
seemed full of stings; he felt stabs all over him; his unprotected
portions winced with the expectancy of pain. The beast knew he was
coming out, and was waiting for him. In that brief instant he had felt
its sting all over him, on his unprotected ankles, on his back, his
neck, his cheeks, in his eyes, and on the bald clearing that adorned
his Anglican head. Through the closed door he heard the ominous, dull
murmur of his striped adversary as it beat its angry wings. Its oiled
and wicked sting shot in and out with fury. Its deft legs worked. He
saw its tiny waist already writhing with the lust of battle. Ugh! That
tiny waist! A moment's steady nerve and he could have severed that
cunning body from the directing brain with one swift, well-directed
thrust. But his nerve had utterly deserted him.</p>

<p>Human motives, even in the professedly holy, are an involved affair
at any time. Just now, in the Rev. James Milligan, they were
inextricably mixed. He claims this explanation, at any rate, in excuse
of his abominable subsequent behaviour. For, exactly at this moment,
when he had decided to admit cowardice by ringing for the Arab servant,
a step was audible in the corridor outside, and courage came with it
into his disreputable heart. It was the step of the man he cordially
"disapproved of," using the pulpit version of "hated and despised." He
had overstayed his time, and the bath was in demand by Mr. Mullins. Mr.
Mullins invariably followed him at seven-thirty; it was now a quarter
to eight. And Mr. Mullins was a wretched drinking man--"a sot."</p>

<p>In a flash the plan was conceived and put into execution. The
temptation, of course, was of the devil. Mr. Milligan hid the motive
from himself, pretending he hardly recognized it. The plan was what men
call a dirty trick; it was also irresistibly seductive. He opened the
door, stepped boldly, nose in the air, right over the hideous insect on
the floor, and fairly pranced into the outer passage. The brief transit
brought a hundred horrible sensations--that the hornet would rise and
sting his leg, that it would cling to his dressing-gown and stab his
spine, that he would step upon it and die, like Achilles, of a heel
exposed. But with these, and conquering them, was one other stronger
emotion that robbed the lesser terrors of their potency--that Mr.
Mullins would run precisely the same risks five seconds later,
unprepared. He heard the gloating insect buzz and scratch the oilcloth.
But it was behind him. He was safe!</p>

<p>"Good morning to you, Mr. Mullins," he observed with a gracious
smile. "I trust I have not kept you waiting."</p>

<p>"Mornin'!" grunted Mullins sourly in reply, as he passed him with a
distinctly hostile and contemptuous air. For Mullins, though depraved,
perhaps, was an honest man, abhorring parsons and making no secret of
his opinions--whence the bitter feeling.</p>

<p>All men, except those very big ones who are supermen, have something
astonishingly despicable in them. The despicable thing in Milligan came
uppermost now. He fairly chuckled. He met the snub with a calm,
forgiving smile, and continued his shambling gait with what dignity he
could towards his bedroom opposite. Then he turned his head to see. His
enemy would meet an infuriated hornet--an Egyptian hornet!--and might
not notice it. He might step on it. He might not. But he was bound to
disturb it, and rouse it to attack. The chances were enormously on the
clerical side. And its sting meant death.</p>

<p>"May God forgive me!" ran subconsciously through his mind. And side
by side with the repentant prayer ran also a recognition of the
tempter's eternal skill: "I hope the devil it will sting him!"</p>

<p>It happened very quickly. The Rev. James Milligan lingered a moment
by his door to watch. He saw Mullins, the disgusting Mullins, step
blithely into the bathroom passage; he saw him pause, shrink back, and
raise his arm to protect his face. He heard him swear aloud: "What's
the d_____d thing doing here? Have I really got 'em again?" And then he
heard him laugh--a hearty, guffawing laugh of genuine relief--"It's
real!"</p>

<p>The moment of revulsion was overwhelming. It filled the churchly
heart with anguish and bitter disappointment. For a space he hated the
whole race of men.</p>

<p>For the instant Mr. Mullins realized that the insect was not a fiery
illusion of his disordered nerves, he went forward without the smallest
hesitation. With his towel he knocked down the flying terror. Then he
stooped. He gathered up the venomous thing his well-aimed blow had
stricken so easily to the floor. He advanced with it, held at arm's
length, to the window. He tossed it out carelessly. The Egyptian hornet
flew away uninjured, and Mr. Mullins--the Mr. Mullins who drank, gave
nothing to the church, attended no services, hated parsons, and
proclaimed the fact with enthusiasm--this same Mr. Mullins went to his
unearned bath without a scratch. But first he saw his enemy standing in
the doorway across the passage, watching him--and understood. That was
the awful part of it. Mullins would make a story of it, and the story
would go the round of the hotel.</p>

<p>The Rev. James Milligan, however, proved that his reputation for
self-control was not undeserved. He conducted morning service half an
hour later with an expression of peace upon his handsome face. He
conquered all outward sign of inward spiritual vexation; the wicked, he
consoled himself, ever flourished like green bay trees. It was
notorious that the righteous never have any luck at all! That was bad
enough. But what was worse--and the Rev. James Milligan remembered for
very long--was the superior ease with which Mullins had relegated both
himself and hornet to the same level of comparative insignificance.
Mullins ignored them both--which proved that he thought himself
superior. Infinitely worse than the sting of any hornet in the world:
he really was superior.</p>

<h2><a name="ch06"></a>First Hate</h2>

<p>They had been shooting all day; the weather had been perfect and the
powder straight, so that when they assembled in the smoking-room after
dinner they were well-pleased with themselves.</p>

<p>From discussing the day's sport and the weather outlook, the
conversation drifted to other, though still cognate, fields. Lawson,
the crack shot of the party, mentioned the instinctive recognition all
animals feel for their natural enemies, and gave several instances in
which he had tested it--tame rats with a ferret, birds with a snake,
and so forth.</p>

<p>'Even after being domesticated for generations,' he said, they
recognise their natural enemy at once by instinct, an enemy they can
never even have seen before. It's infallible. They know instantly.'</p>

<p>'Undoubtedly,' said a voice from the corner chair; 'and so do
we.'</p>

<p>The speaker was Ericssen, their host, a great hunter before the
Lord, generally uncommunicative but a good listener, leaving the talk
to others. For this latter reason, as well as for a certain note of
challenge in his voice, his abrupt statement gained attention.</p>

<p>'What do you mean exactly by "so do we"?' asked three men together,
after waiting some seconds to see whether he meant to elaborate, which
he evidently did not.</p>

<p>'We belong to the animal kingdom, of course,' put in a fourth, for
behind the challenge there obviously lay a story, though a story that
might be difficult to drag out of him. It was.</p>

<p>Ericssen, who had leaned forward a moment so that his strong,
humorous face was in clear light, now sank back again into his chair,
his expression concealed by the red lampshade at his side. The light
played tricks, obliterating the humorous, almost tender, lines, while
emphasising the strength of the jaw and nose. The red glare lent to the
whole a rather grim expression.</p>

<p>Lawson, man of authority among them, broke the little pause.</p>

<p>'You're dead right,' he observed; 'but how do you know it?'--for
John Ericssen never made a positive statement without a good reason for
it. That good reason, he felt sure, involved a personal proof, but a
story Ericssen would never tell before a general audience. He would
tell it later, however when the others had left. 'There's such a thing
as instinctive antipathy, of course,' he added, with a laugh, looking
round him. 'That's what you mean, probably.'</p>

<p>'I meant exactly what I said,' replied the host bluntly. 'There's
first love. There's first hate, too.'</p>

<p>'Hate's a strong word,' remarked Lawson.</p>

<p>'So is love,' put in another.</p>

<p>'Hate's strongest,' said Ericssen grimly. 'In the animal kingdom, at
least,' he added suggestively, and then kept his lips closed, except to
sip his liquor, for the rest of the evening--until the party at length
broke up, leaving Lawson and one other man, both old trusted friends of
many years' standing.</p>

<p>'It's not a tale I'd tell to everybody,' he began, when they were
alone. 'It's true, for one thing; for another, you see, some of those
good fellows'--he indicated the empty chairs with an expressive nod of
his great head--'some of 'em knew him. You both knew him too,
probably.'</p>

<p>'The man you hated,' said the understanding Lawson.</p>

<p>'And who hated me,' came the quiet confirmation. 'My other reason,'
he went on, 'for keeping quiet was that the tale involves my wife.' The
two listeners said nothing, but each remembered the curiously long
courtship that had been the prelude to his marriage. No engagement had
been announced, the pair were devoted to one another, there was no
known rival on either side, yet the courtship continued without coming
to its expected conclusion. Many stories were afloat in consequence. It
was a social mystery that intrigued the gossips.</p>

<p>'I may tell you two,' Ericssen continued, 'the reason my wife
refused for so long to marry me. It is hard to believe, perhaps, but it
is true. Another man wished to make her his wife, and she would not
consent to marry me until that other man was dead. Quixotic, absurd,
unreasonable? If you like. I'll tell you what she said.' He looked up
with a significant expression in his face which proved that he, at
least, did not now judge her reason foolish. "'Because it would be
murder," she told me. "Another man who wants to marry me would kill
you."</p>

<p>'She had some proof for the assertion, no doubt?' suggested
Lawson.</p>

<p>'None whatever,' was the reply. 'Merely her woman's instinct.
Moreover, I did not know who the other man was, nor would she ever tell
me.'</p>

<p>'Otherwise you might have murdered him instead?' said Baynes, the
second listener.</p>

<p>'I did,' said Ericssen grimly. 'But without knowing he was the man.'
He sipped his whisky and relit his pipe. The others waited.</p>

<p>'Our marriage took place two months later--just after Hazel's
disappearance.'</p>

<p>'Hazel?' exclaimed Lawson and Baynes in a single breath. 'Hazel!
Member of the Hunters!'</p>

<p>His mysterious disappearance had been a nine days' wonder some ten
years ago. It had never been explained. They had all been members of
the Hunters' Club together.</p>

<p>'That's the chap,' Ericssen said. 'Now I'll tell you the tale, if
you care to hear it.' They settled back in their chairs to listen, and
Ericssen, who had evidently never told the affair to another living
soul except his own wife, doubtless, seemed glad this time to tell it
to two men.</p>

<p>'It began some dozen years ago when my brother Jack and I came home
from a shooting trip in China. I've often told you about our adventures
there, and you see the heads hanging up here in the smoking-room--some
of 'em.' He glanced round proudly at the walls. 'We were glad to be in
town again after two years' roughing it, and we looked forward to our
first good dinner at the Club, to make up for the rotten cooking we had
endured so long. We had ordered that dinner in anticipatory detail many
a time together. Well, we had it and enjoyed it up to a point-the point
of the entr&eacute;e, to be exact. Up to that point it was delicious,
and we let ourselves go, I can tell you. We had ordered the very wine
we had planned months before when we were snow-bound and half starving
in the mountains.' He smacked his lips as he mentioned it. 'I was just
starting on a beautifully cooked grouse,' he went on, 'when a figure
went by our table, and Jack looked up and nodded. The two exchanged a
brief word of greeting and explanation and the other man passed on.
Evidently they knew each other just enough to make a word or two
necessary, but enough.</p>

<p>'"Who's that?" I asked.</p>

<p>'"A new member, named Hazel," Jack told me. "A great shot." He knew
him slightly, he explained; he had once been a client of his--Jack was
a barrister, you remember--and had defended him in some financial case
or other. Rather an unpleasant case, he added. Jack did not care about
the fellow, he told me, as he went on with his tender wing of
grouse.'</p>

<p>Ericssen paused to relight his pipe a moment.</p>

<p>'Not care about him!' he continued. 'It didn't surprise me, for my
own feeling, the instant I set eyes on the fellow, was one of violent,
instinctive dislike that amounted to loathing.</p>

<p>Loathing! No. I'll give it the right word--hatred. I simply couldn't
help myself; I hated the man from the very first go off. A wave of
repulsion swept over me as I followed him down the room a moment with
my eyes, till he took his seat at a distant table and was out of sight.
Ugh! He was a big, fat-faced man, with an eyeglass glued into one of
his pale-blue cod-like eyes--out of condition, ugly as a toad, with a
smug expression of intense self-satisfaction on his jowl that made me
long to--'I leave it to you to guess what I would have liked to do to
him. But the instinctive loathing he inspired in me had another aspect,
too. Jack had not introduced us during the momentary pause beside our
table, but as I looked up I caught the fellow's eye on mine--he was
glaring at me instead of at Jack, to whom he was talking--with an
expression of malignant dislike, as keen evidently as my own. That's
the other aspect I meant. He hated me as violently as I hated him.</p>

<p>We were instinctive enemies, just as the rat and ferret are
instinctive enemies. Each recognised a mortal foe. It was a case--I
swear it--of whoever got first chance.'</p>

<p>'Bad as that!' exclaimed Baynes. 'I knew him by sight. He wasn't
pretty, I'll admit.'</p>

<p>'I knew him to nod to,' Lawson mentioned. 'I never heard anything
particular against him.'</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>Ericssen went on. 'It was not his character or qualities I hated,'
he said. 'I didn't even know them. That's the whole point. There's no
reason you fellows should have disliked him. My hatred--our mutual
hatred--was instinctive, as instinctive as first love. A man knows his
natural mate; also he knows his natural enemy. I did, at any rate, both
with him and with my wife. Given the chance, Hazel would have done me
in; just as surely, given the chance, I would have done him in. No
blame to either of us, what's more, in my opinion.'</p>

<p>'I've felt dislike, but never hatred like that,' Baynes mentioned.
'I came across it in a book once, though. The writer did not mention
the instinctive fear of the human animal for its natural enemy, or
anything of that sort. He thought it was a continuance of a bitter feud
begun in an earlier existence. He called it memory.'</p>

<p>'Possibly,' said Ericssen briefly. 'My mind is not speculative. But
I'm glad you spoke of fear. I left that out. The truth is, I feared the
fellow, too, in a way; and had we ever met face to face in some wild
country without witnesses I should have felt justified in drawing on
him at sight, and he would have felt the same. Murder? If you like. I
should call it self-defence.</p>

<p>Anyhow, the fellow polluted the room for me. He spoilt the enjoyment
of that dinner we had ordered months before in China.'</p>

<p>'But you saw him again, of course, later?'</p>

<p>'Lots of times. Not that night, because we went on to a theatre. But
in the Club we were always running across one another--in the houses of
friends at lunch or dinner; at race-meetings; all over the place; in
fact, I even had some trouble to avoid being introduced to him. And
every time we met, our eyes betrayed us. He felt in his heart what I
felt in mine. Ugh! He was as loathsome to me as leprosy, and as
dangerous. Odd, isn't it? The most intense feeling, except love, I've
ever known. I remember'--he laughed gruffly--'I used to feel quite
sorry for him. If he felt what I felt, and I'm convinced he did, he
must have suffered. His one object--to get me out of the way for
good--was so impossible. Then Fate played a hand in the game. I'll tell
you how.</p>

<p>'My brother died a year or two later, and I went abroad to try and
forget it. I went salmon fishing in Canada. But, though the sport was
good, it was not like the old times with Jack. The camp never felt the
same without him. I missed him badly. But I forgot Hazel for the time;
hating did not seem worth while, somehow.</p>

<p>'When the best of the fishing was over on the Atlantic side I took a
run back to Vancouver and fished there for a bit. I went up the
Campbell River, which was not so crowded then as it is now, and had
some rattling sport. Then I grew tired of the rod and decided to go
after wapiti for a change. I came back to Victoria and learned what I
could about the best places, and decided finally to go up the west
coast of the island. By luck I happened to pick up a good guide, who
was in the town at the moment on business, and we started off together
in one of the little Canadian Pacific Railway boats that ply along that
coast.</p>

<p>'Outfitting two days later at a small place the steamer stopped at,
the guide said we needed another man to help pack our kit over
portages, and so forth, but the only fellow available was a Siwash of
whom he disapproved. My guide would not have him at any price; he was
lazy, a drunkard, a liar, and even worse, for on one occasion he came
back without the sportsman he had taken up country on a shooting trio,
and his story was not convincing, to say the least. These
disappearances are always awkward, of course, as you both know. We
preferred, anyhow, to go without the Siwash, and off we started.</p>

<p>'At first our luck was bad. I saw many wapiti, but no good heads;
only after a fortnight's hunting did I manage to get a decent head,
though even that was not so good as I should have liked.</p>

<p>'We were then near the head waters of a little river that ran down
into the Inlet; heavy rains had made the river rise; running downstream
was a risky job, what with old log-jams shifting and new ones forming;
and, after many narrow escapes, we upset one afternoon and had the
misfortune to lose a lot of our kit, amongst it most of our cartridges.
We could only muster a few between us. The guide had a dozen; I had
two--just enough, we considered, to take us out all right. Still, it
was an infernal nuisance. We camped at once to dry out our soaked
things in front of a big fire, and while this laundry work was going on
the guide suggested my filling in the time by taking a look at the next
little valley, which ran parallel to ours. He had seen some good heads
over there a few weeks ago. Possibly I might come upon the herd. I
started at once, taking my two cartridges with me.</p>

<p>'It was the devil of a job getting over the divide, for it was a
badly bushed-up place, and where there were no bushes there were
boulders and fallen trees, and the going was slow and tiring. But I got
across at last and came out upon another stream at the bottom of the
new valley. Signs of wapiti were plentiful, though I never came up with
a single beast all the afternoon.</p>

<p>'Blacktail deer were everywhere, but the wapiti remained invisible.
Providence, or whatever you like to call that fate which there is no
escaping in our lives, made me save my two cartridges.'</p>

<p>Ericssen stopped a minute then, It was not to light his pipe or sip
his whisky. Nor was it because the remainder of his story failed in the
recollection of any vivid detail. He paused a moment to think.</p>

<p>'Tell us the lot,' pleaded Lawson. 'Don't leave out anything.'</p>

<p>Ericssen looked up. His friend's remark had helped him to make up
his mind apparently. He had hesitated about something or other, but the
hesitation passed. He glanced at both his listeners.</p>

<p>'Right,' he said. 'I'll tell you everything. I'm not imaginative, as
you know, and my amount of superstition, I should judge, is
microscopic.' He took a longer breath, then lowered his voice a trifle.
'Anyhow,' he went on, 'it's true, so I don't see why I should feel shy
about admitting it--but as I stood there, in that lonely valley, where
only the noises of wind and water were audible, and no human being,
except my guide, some miles away, was within reach, a curious feeling
came over me I find difficult to describe. I felt'--obviously he made
an effort to get the word out--'I felt creepy.'</p>

<p>'You,' murmured Lawson, with an incredulous smile--'you creepy?' he
repeated under his breath.</p>

<p>'I felt creepy and afraid,' continued the other, with conviction. 'I
had the sensation of being seen by someone--as if someone, I mean, was
watching me. It was so unlikely that anyone was near me in that
God-forsaken bit of wilderness that I simply couldn't believe it at
first. But the feeling persisted. I felt absolutely positive somebody
was not far away among the red maples, behind a boulder, across the
little stream, perhaps--somewhere, at any rate, so near that I was
plainly visible to him. It was not an animal. It was human. Also, it
was hostile.</p>

<p>'I was in danger.</p>

<p>'You may laugh, both of you, but I assure you the feeling was so
positive that I crouched down instinctively to hide myself behind a
rock. My first thought, that the guide had followed me for some reason
or other, I at once discarded. It was not the guide. It was an
enemy.</p>

<p>'No, no, I thought of no one in particular. No name, no face
occurred to me. Merely that an enemy was on my trail, that he saw me,
and I did not see him, and that he was near enough to me to--well, to
take instant action. This deep instinctive feeling of danger, of fear,
of anything you like to call it, was simply overwhelming.</p>

<p>'Another curious detail I must also mention. About half an hour
before, having given up all hope of seeing wapiti, I had decided to
kill a blacktail deer for meat. A good shot offered itself, not thirty
yards away. I aimed. But just as I was going to pull the trigger a
queer emotion touched me, and I lowered the rifle. It was exactly as
though a voice said, "Don't!" I heard no voice, mind you; it was an
emotion only, a feeling, a sudden inexplicable change of mind--a
warning, if you like. I didn't fire, anyhow.</p>

<p>'But now, as I crouched behind that rock, I remembered this curious
little incident, and was glad I had not used up my last two cartridges.
More than that I cannot tell you. Things of that kind are new to me.
They're difficult enough to tell let alone to explain. But they were
real.</p>

<p>'I crouched there, wondering what on earth was happening to me, and
feeling a bit of a fool, if you want to know, when suddenly, over the
top of the boulder, I saw something moving. It was a man's hat. I
peered cautiously. Some sixty yards away the bushes parted, and two men
came out on to the river's bank, and I knew them both. One was the
Siwash I had seen at the store. The other was Hazel. Before I had time
to think I cocked my rifle.'</p>

<p>'Hazel. Good Lord!' exclaimed the listeners.</p>

<p>'For a moment I was too surprised to do anything but cock that
rifle. I waited, for what puzzled me was that, after all, Hazel had not
seen me. It was only the feeling of his beastly proximity that had made
me feel I was seen and watched by him. There was something else, too,
that made me pause before--er--doing anything. Two other things, in
fact. One was that I was so intensely interested in watching the
fellow's actions. Obviously he had the same uneasy sensation that I
had. He shared with me the nasty feeling that danger was about. His
rifle, I saw, was cocked and ready; he kept looking behind him, over
his shoulder, peering this way and that, and sometimes addressing a
remark to the Siwash at his side. I caught the laughter of the latter.
The Siwash evidently did not think there was danger anywhere. It was,
of course, unlikely enough--'</p>

<p>'And the other thing that stopped you?' urged Lawson, impatiently
interrupting.</p>

<p>Ericssen turned with a look of grim humour on his face. 'Some
confounded or perverted sense of chivalry in me, I suppose,' he said,
'that made it impossible to shoot him down in cold blood, or, rather,
without letting him have a chance. For my blood, as a matter of fact,
was far from cold at the moment. Perhaps, too, I wanted the added
satisfaction of letting him know who fired the shot that was to end his
vile existence.</p>

<p>He laughed again. 'It was rat and ferret in the human kingdom, he
went on, 'but I wanted my rat to have a chance, I suppose. Anyhow,
though I had a perfect shot in front of me at easy distance, I did not
fire. Instead I got up, holding my cocked rifle ready, finger on
trigger, and came out of my biding-place. I called to him. "Hazel, you
beast! So there you are--at last!"</p>

<p>'He turned, but turned away from me, offering his horrid back. The
direction of the voice he misjudged. He pointed down-stream, and the
Siwash turned to look. Neither of them had seen me yet. There was a big
log-jam below them. The roar of the water in their ears concealed my
footsteps. I was, perhaps, twenty paces from them when Hazel, with a
jerk of his whole body, abruptly turned dean round and faced me. We
stared into each other's eyes.</p>

<p>'The amazement on his face changed instantly to hatred and resolve.
He acted with incredible rapidity. I think the unexpected suddenness of
his turn made me lose a precious second or two.</p>

<p>Anyhow he was ahead of me. He flung his rifle to his shoulder. 'You
devil!' I heard his voice.</p>

<p>'I've got you at last!' His rifle cracked, for he let drive the same
instant. The hair stirred just above my ear.</p>

<p>'He had missed!</p>

<p>'Before he could draw back his bolt for another shot I had
acted.</p>

<p>"You're not fit to live!" I shouted, as my bullet crashed into his
temple. I had the satisfaction, too, of knowing that he heard my words.
I saw the swift expression of frustrated loathing in his eyes.</p>

<p>'He fell like an ox, his face splashing in the stream. I shoved the
body out. I saw it sucked beneath the log-jam instantly. It
disappeared. There could be no inquest on him, I reflected comfortably.
Hazel was gone--gone from this earth, from my hatred over at last.</p>

<p>The speaker paused a moment. 'Odd,' he continued presently--'very
odd indeed.' He turned to the others. 'I felt quite sorry for him
suddenly. I suppose,' he added, 'the philosophers are right when they
gas about hate being very close to love.'</p>

<p>His friends contributed no remark.</p>

<p>'Then I came away,' he resumed shortly. 'My wife--well, you know the
rest, don't you? I told her the whole thing. She--she said nothing. But
she married me, you see.'</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence. Baynes was the first to break it.
'But--the Siwash?' he asked.</p>

<p>'The witness?' Lawson turned upon him with something of contemptuous
impatience.</p>

<p>'He told you he had two cartridges.'</p>

<p>Ericssen, smiling grimly, said nothing at all.</p>

<h2><a name="ch07"></a>The Goblin's Collection</h2>

<p>Dutton accepted the invitation for the feeble reason that he was not
quick enough at the moment to find a graceful excuse. He had none of
that facile brilliance which is so useful at week-end parties; he was a
big, shy, awkward man. Moreover, he disliked these great houses. They
swallowed him. The solemn, formidable butlers oppressed him. He left on
Sunday night when possible. This time, arriving with an hour to dress,
he went upstairs to an enormous room, so full of precious things that
he felt like an insignificant item in a museum corridor. He smiled
disconsolately as the underling who brought up his bag began to fumble
with the lock. But, instead of the sepulchral utterance he dreaded, a
delicious human voice with an unmistakable brogue proceeded from the
stooping figure. It was positively comforting. "It 'all be locked,
sorr, but maybe ye have the key?" And they bent together over the
disreputable kit-bag, looking like a pair of ants knitting antennae on
the floor of some great cave. The giant four-poster watched them
contemptuously; mahogany cupboards wore an air of grave surprise; the
gaping, open fireplace alone could have swallowed all his
easels--almost, indeed, his little studio. This human, Irish presence
was distinctly consoling--some extra hand or other, thought Dutton,
probably.</p>

<p>He talked a little with the lad; then, lighting a cigarette, he
watched him put the clothes away in the capacious cupboards, noticing
in particular how neat and careful he was with the little things.
Nail-scissors, silver stud-box, metal shoe-horn, and safety razor, even
the bright cigar-cutter and pencil-sharpener collected loose from the
bottom of the bag--all these he placed in a row upon the dressing-table
with the glass top, and seemed never to have done with it. He kept
coming back to rearrange and put a final touch, lingering over them
absurdly. Dutton watched him with amusement, then surprise, finally
with exasperation. Would he never go? "Thank you," he said at last;
"that will do. I'll dress now. What time is dinner?" The lad told him,
but still lingered, evidently anxious to say more. "Everything's out, I
think," repeated Dutton impatiently; "all the loose things, I mean?"
The face at once turned eagerly. What mischievous Irish eyes he had, to
be sure! "I've put him all together in a row, sorr, so that ye'll not
be missing anny-thing at all," was the quick reply, as he pointed to
the ridiculous collection of little articles, and even darted back to
finger them again. He counted them one by one. And then suddenly he
added, with a touch of personal interest that was not familiarity,
"It's so easy, ye see, sorr, to lose thim small bright things in this
great room." And he was gone.</p>

<p>Smiling a little to himself, Dutton began to dress, wondering how
the lad had left the impression that his words meant more than they
said. He almost wished he had encouraged him to talk. "The small bright
things in this great room"--what an admirable description, almost a
criticism! He felt like a prisoner of state in the Tower. He stared
about him into the alcoves, recesses, deep embrasured windows; the
tapestries and huge curtains oppressed him; next he fell to wondering
who the other guests would be, whom he would take in to dinner, how
early he could make an excuse and slip off to bed; then, midway in
these desultory thoughts, became suddenly aware of a curiously sharp
impression--that he was being watched. Somebody, quite close, was
looking at him. He dismissed the fancy as soon as it was born, putting
it down to the size and mystery of the old-world chamber; but in spite
of himself the idea persisted teasingly, and several times he caught
himself turning nervously to look over his shoulder. It was not a
ghostly feeling; his nature was not accessible to ghostly things. The
strange idea, lodged securely in his brain, was traceable, he thought,
to something the Irish lad had said--grew out, rather, of what he left
unsaid. He idly allowed his imagination to encourage it. Someone,
friendly but curious, with inquisitive, peeping eyes, was watching him.
Someone very tiny was hiding in the enormous room. He laughed about it;
but he felt different. A certain big, protective feeling came over him
that he must go gently lest he tread on some diminutive living thing
that was soft as a kitten and elusive as a baby mouse. Once, indeed,
out of the corner of his eye, he fancied he saw a little thing with
wings go fluttering past the great purple curtains at the other end. It
was by a window. "A bird, or something, outside," he told himself with
a laugh, yet moved thenceforth more often than not on tiptoe. This cost
him a certain effort: his proportions were elephantine. He felt a more
friendly interest now in the stately, imposing chamber.</p>

<p>The dressing-gong brought him back to reality and stopped the flow
of his imagining. He shaved, and laboriously went on dressing then; he
was slow and leisurely in his movements, like many big men; very
orderly, too. But when he was ready to put in his collar stud it was
nowhere to be found. It was a worthless bit of brass, but most
important; he had only one. Five minutes ago it had been standing
inside the ring of his collar on the marble slab; he had carefully
placed it there. Now it had disappeared and left no trail. He grew warm
and untidy in the search. It was something of a business for Dutton to
go on all fours. "Malicious little beast!" he grunted, rising from his
knees, his hand sore where he had scraped it beneath the cupboard. His
trouser-crease was ruined, his hair was tumbled. He knew too well the
elusive activity of similar small objects. "It will turn up again," he
tried to laugh, "if I pay it no attention. Mall--" he abruptly changed
the adjective, as though he had nearly said a dangerous thing--"naughty
little imp!" He went on dressing, leaving the collar to the last. He
fastened the cigar-cutter to this chain, but the nail-scissors, he
noticed now, had also gone. "Odd," he reflected, "very odd!" He looked
at the place where they had been a few minutes ago. "Odd!" he repeated.
And finally, in desperation, he rang the bell. The heavy curtains swung
inwards as he said, "Come in," in answer to the knock, and the Irish
boy, with the merry, dancing eyes, stood in the room. He glanced half
nervously, half expectantly, about him. "It'll be something ye have
lost, sorr?" he said at once, as though he knew.</p>

<p>"I rang," said Dutton, resenting it a little, "to ask you if you
could get me a collar stud--for this evening. Anything will do." He did
not say he had lost his own. Someone, he felt, who was listening, would
chuckle and be pleased. It was an absurd position.</p>

<p>"And will it be a shtud like this, sorr, that yez wanting?" asked
the boy, picking up the lost object from inside the collar on the
marble slab.</p>

<p>"Like that, yes," stammered the other, utterly amazed. He had
overlooked it, of course, yet it was in the identical place where he
had left it. He felt mortified and foolish. It was so obvious that the
boy grasped the situation--more, had expected it. It was as if the stud
had been taken and replaced deliberately. "Thank you," he added,
turning away to hide his face as the lad backed out--with a grin, he
imagined, though he did not see it. Almost immediately, it seemed, then
he was back again, holding out a little cardboard box containing an
assortment of ugly bone studs. Dutton felt as if the whole thing had
been prepared beforehand. How foolish it was! Yet behind it lay
something real and true and--utterly incredible!</p>

<p>"They won't get taken, sorr," he heard the lad say from the doorway.
"They're not nearly bright enough."</p>

<p>The other decided not to hear. "Thanks," he said curtly; "they'll do
nicely."</p>

<p>There was a pause, but the boy did not go. Taking a deep breath, he
said very quickly, as though greatly daring, "It's only the bright and
little lovely things he takes, sorr, if ye plaze. He takes thim for his
collection, and there's no stoppin' him at all." It came out with a
rush, and Dutton, hearing it, let the human thing rise up in him. He
turned and smiled.</p>

<p>"Oh, he takes these things for his collection, does he?" he asked
more gently.</p>

<p>The boy looked dreadfully shame-faced, confession hanging on his
lips. "The little bright and lovely things, sorr, yes. I've done me
best, but there's things he can't resist at all. The bone ones is safe,
though. He won't look at thim."</p>

<p>"I suppose he followed you across from Ireland, eh?" the other
enquired.</p>

<p>The lad hung his head. "I told Father Madden," he said in a lower
voice, "but it's not the least bit of good in the wurrld." He looked as
though he had been convicted of stealing and feared to lose his place.
Suddenly, lifting his blue eyes, he added, "But if ye take no notice at
all he ginrelly puts everything back in its place agin. He only borrows
thim, just for a little bit of toime. Pretend ye're not wantin' thim at
all, sorr, and back they'll come prisintly agani, brighter than before
maybe."</p>

<p>"I see," answered Dutton slowly. "All right, then," he dismissed
him, "and I won't say a word downstairs. You needn't be afraid," as the
lad looked his gratitude and vanished like a flash, leaving the other
with a queer and eerie feeling, staring at the ugly bone studs. He
finished dressing hurriedly and went downstairs. He went on tiptoe out
of the great room, moving delicately and with care, lest he might tread
on something very soft and tiny, almost wounded, like a butterfly with
a broken wing. And from the corners, he felt positive, something
watched him go.</p>

<p>The ordeal of dinner passed off well enough; the rather heavy
evening too. He found the opportunity to slip off early to bed. The
nail-scissors were in their place again. He read till midnight; nothing
happened. His hostess had told him the history of his room, inquiring
kindly after his comfort. "Some people feel rather lost in it," she
said; "I hope you found all you want," and, tempted by her choice of
words--the "lost" and "found"--he nearly told the story of the Irish
lad whose goblin had followed him across the sea and "borrowed little
bright and lovely things for his collection." But he kept his word; he
told nothing; she would only have stared, for one thing. For another,
he was bored, and therefore uncommunicative. He smiled inwardly. All
that this giant mansion could produce for his comfort and amusement
were ugly bone studs, a thieving goblin, and a vast bedroom where dead
royalty had slept. Next day, at intervals, when changing for tennis or
back again for lunch, the "borrowing" continued; the little things he
needed at the moment had disappeared. They turned up later. To ignore
their disappearance was the recipe for their recovery--invariable, too,
just where he had seen them last. There was the lost object shining in
his face, propped impishly on its end, just ready to fall upon the
carpet, and ever with a quizzical, malicious air of innocence that was
truly goblin. His collar stud was the favourite; next came the scissors
and the silver pencil-sharpener.</p>

<p>Trains and motors combined to keep him Sunday night, but he arranged
to leave on Monday before the other guests were up, and so got early to
bed. He meant to watch. There was a merry, jolly feeling in him that he
had established quasi-friendly relations with the little Borrower. He
might even see an object go--catch it in the act of disappearing! He
arranged the bright objects in a row upon the glass-topped
dressing-table opposite the bed, and while reading kept an eye slyly on
the array of tempting bait. But nothing happened. "It's the wrong way,"
he realised suddenly. "What a blunderer I am!" He turned the light out,
then. Drowsiness crept over him.</p>

<p>...Next day, of course, he told himself it was a dream.</p>

<p>The night was very still, and through the latticed windows stole
faintly the summer moonlight. Outside the foliage rustled a little in
the wind. A night-jar called from the fields, and a secret, furry owl
made answer from the copse beyond. The body of the chamber lay in thick
darkness, but a slanting ray of moonlight caught the dressing-table and
shone temptingly upon the silver objects. "It's like setting a
night-line," was the last definite thought he remembered--when the
laughter that followed stopped suddenly, and his nerves gave a jerk
that turned him keenly alert.</p>

<p>From the enormous open fireplace, gaping in darkness at the end of
the room, issued a thread of delicate sound that was softer than a
feather. A tiny flurry of excitement, furtive, tentative, passed
shivering across the air. An exquisite, dainty flutter stirred the
night, and through the heavy human brain upon the great four-poster
fled this picture, as from very far away, picked out in black and
silver--of a wee knight-errant crossing the frontiers of fairyland,
high mischief in his tiny, beating heart. Pricking along over the big,
thick carpet, he came towards the bed, towards the dressing-table,
intent upon bold plunder. Dutton lay motionless as a stone, and watched
and listened. The blood in his ears smothered the sound a little, but
he never lost it altogether. The flicking of a mouse's tail or whiskers
could hardly have been more gentle than this sound, more wary,
circumspect, discreet, certainly not half so artful. Yet the human
being in the bed, so heavily breathing, heard it well. Closer it came,
and closer, oh, so elegant and tender, this bold attack of a wee
Adventurer from another world. It shot swiftly past the bed. With a
little flutter, delicious, almost musical, it rose in the air before
his very face and entered the pool of moonlight on the dressing-table.
Something blurred it then; the human sight grew troubled and confused a
moment; a mingling of moonlight with the reflections from the mirror,
slab of glass, and shining objects obscured clear vision somehow. For a
second Dutton lost the proper focus. There was a tiny rattle and a tiny
click. He saw that the pencil-sharpener stood balanced on the table's
very edge. It was in the act of vanishing.</p>

<p>But for his stupid blunder, then he might have witnessed more. He
simply could not restrain himself, it seems. He sprang, and at the same
instant the silver object fell upon the carpet. Of course his
elephantine leap made the entire table shake. But, anyhow, he was not
quick enough. He saw the reflection of a slim and tiny hand slide down
into the mirrored depths of the reflecting sheet of glass--deep, deep
down, and swift as a flash of light. This he thinks he saw, though the
light, he admits, was oddly confusing in that moment of violent and
clumsy movement.</p>

<p>One thing, at any rate, was beyond all question; the
pencil-sharpener had disappeared. He turned the light up; he searched
for a dozen minutes, then gave it up in despair and went back to bed.
Next morning he searched again. But, having overslept himself, he did
not search as thoroughly as he might have done, for half-way through
the tiresome operation the Irish lad came in to take his bag for the
train.</p>

<p>"Will ut be something ye've lost, sorr?" he asked gravely.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all right," Dutton answered from the floor. "You can take
the bag--and my overcoat." And in town that day he bought another
pencil-sharpener and hung it on his chain.</p>

<h2><a name="ch08"></a>The House of the Past</h2>

<p>One night a Dream came to me and brought with her an old and rusty
key. She led me across fields and sweet smelling lanes, where the
hedges were already whispering to one another in the dark of the
spring, till we came to a huge, gaunt house with staring windows and
lofty roof half hidden in the shadows of very early morning. I noticed
that the blinds were of heavy black, and that the house seemed wrapped
in absolute stillness.</p>

<p>"This," she whispered in my ear, "is the House of the Past. Come
with me and we will go through some of its rooms and passages; but
quickly, for I have not the key for long, and the night is very nearly
over. Yet, perchance, you shall remember!"</p>

<p>The key made a dreadful noise as she turned it in the lock, and when
the great door swung open into an empty hall and we went in, I heard
sounds of whispering and weeping, and the rustling of clothes, as of
people moving in their sleep and about to wake. Then, instantly, a
spirit of intense sadness came over me, drenching me to the soul; my
eyes began to burn and smart, and in my heart I became aware of a
strange sensation as of the uncoiling of something that had been asleep
for ages. My whole being, unable to resist, at once surrended itself to
the spirit of deepest melancholy, and the pain of my heart, as the
Things moved and woke, became in a moment of time too strong for
words...</p>

<p>As we advanced, the faint voices and sobbings fled away before us
into the interior of the House, and I became conscious that the air was
full of hands held aloft, of swaying garments, of drooping tresses, and
of eyes so sad and wistful that the tears, which were already brimming
in my own, held back for wonder at the sight of such intolerable
yearning.</p>

<p>"Do not allow this sadness to overwhelm you," whispered the Dream at
my side. "It is not often They wake. They sleep for years and years and
years. The chambers are all full, and unless visitors such as we come
to disturb them, they will never wake of their own accord. But, when
one stirs, the sleep of the others is troubled, and they too awake,
till the motion is communicated from one room to another and thus
finally throughout the whole House...Then, sometimes, the sadness is
too great to be borne, and the mind weakens. For this reason Memory
gives to them the sweetest and deepest sleep she has and she keeps this
old key rusty from little use. But, listen now," she added, holding up
her hand: "do you not hear all through the House that trembling of the
air like the distant murmur of falling water? And do you not
now...perhaps...remember?"</p>

<p>Even before she spoke, I had already caught faintly the beginning of
a new sound; and, now, deep in the cellars beneath our feet, and from
the upper regions of the great House as well, I heard the whispering,
and the rustling and the inward stirring of the sleeping Shadows. It
rose like a chord swept softly from the huge unseen strings stretched
somewhere among the foundations of the House, and its tremblings ran
gently through its walls and ceilings. And I knew that I heard the slow
awakening of the Ghosts of the Past.</p>

<p>Ah, me, with what terrible inrushing of sadness I stood with
brimming eyes and listened to the faint dead voices of the long
ago...For, indeed, the whole House was awakening; and there presently
rose to my nostrils the subtle, penetrating perfume of age: of letters,
long preserved, with ink faded and ribbons pale; of scented tresses,
golden and brown, laid away, ah, how tenderly! among pressed flowers
that still held the inmost delicacy of their forgotten fragrance; the
scented presence of lost memories--the intoxicating incense of the
past. My eyes o'erflowed, my heart tightened and expanded, as I yielded
myself up without reserve to these old, old influences of sound and
smell. These Ghosts of the Past--forgotten in the tumult of more recent
memories--thronged round me, took my hands in theirs, and, ever
whispering of what I had so long forgot, ever sighing, shaking from
their hair and garments the ineffable odours of the dead ages, led me
through the vast House, from room to room, from floor to floor.</p>

<p>And the Ghosts--were not all equally clear to me. Some had indeed
but the faintest life, and stirred me so little that they left only an
indistinct, blurred impression in the air; while others gazed half
reproachfully at me out of faded, colourless eyes, as if longing to
recall themselves to my recollection; and then, seeing they were not
recognised, floated back gently into the shadows of their room, to
sleep again undisturbed till the Final Day, when I should not fail to
know them.</p>

<p>"Many of these have slept so long," said the Dream beside me, "that
they wake only with the greatest difficulty. Once awake, however, they
know and remember you even though you fail to remember them. For it is
the rule in this House of the Past that, unless you recall them
distinctly, remember precisely when you knew them and with what
particular causes in your past evolution they were associated, they
cannot stay awake. Unless you remember them when your eyes meet, unless
their look of recognition is returned by you, they are obliged to go
back to their sleep, silent and sorrowful, their hands unpressed, their
voices unheard, to sleep and dream, deathless and patient, till..."</p>

<p>At this moment, her words died away suddenly into the distance and I
became conscious of an overpowering sensation of delight and happiness.
Something had touched me on the lips, and a strong, sweet fire flashed
down into my heart and sent the blood rushing tumultuously through my
veins. My pulses beat wildly, my skin glowed, my eyes grew tender, and
the terrible sadness of the place was instantly dispelled as if by
magic. Turning with a cry of joy, that was at once swallowed up in the
chorus of weeping and sighing round me, I looked...and instinctively
stretched forth my arms in a rapture of happiness towards...towards a
vision of a Face...hair, lips, eyes; a cloth of gold lay about the fair
neck, and the old, old perfume of the East--ye stars, how long ago--was
in her breath. Her lips were again on mine; her hair over my eyes; her
arms about my neck, and the love of her ancient soul pouring into mine
out of eyes still starry and undimmed. Oh, the fierce tumult, the
untold wonder, if I could only remember!...That subtle, mist-dispelling
odour of many ages ago, once so familiar...before the Hills of Atlantis
were above the blue sea, or the sands had begun to form the bed of the
Sphinx. Yet wait; it comes back; I begin to remember. Curtain upon
curtain rises in my soul, and I can almost see beyond. But that hideous
stretch of the years, awful and sinister, thousands upon thousands...My
heart shakes, and I am afraid. Another curtain rises and a new vista,
farther than the others, comes into view, interminable, running to a
point among thick mists. Lo, they too are moving, rising, lightening.
At last, I shall see...already I begin to recall...the dusky skin...the
Eastern grace, the wondrous eyes that held the knowledge of Buddha and
the wisdom of Christ before these had even dreamed of attainment. As a
dream within a dream, it steals over me again, taking compelling
possession of my whole being...the slender form...the stars in that
magical Eastern sky...the whispering winds among the palm trees...the
murmur of the river's waves and the music of the reeds where they bend
and sigh in the shallows on the golden sand. Thousands of years ago in
some aeonian distance. It fades a little and begins to pass; then seems
again to rise. Ah me, that smile of the shining teeth...those
lace-veined lids. Oh, who will help me to recall, for it is to far
away, too dim, and I cannot wholly remember; though my lips are still
tingling, and my arms still outstretched, it again begins to fade.
Already there is a look of sadness too deep for words, as she realises
that she is unrecognised...she, whose mere presence could once
extinguish for me the entire universe...and she goes back slowly,
mournfully, silently to her dim, tremendous sleep, to dream and dream
of the day when I must remember her and she must come where she
belongs...</p>

<p>She peers at me from the end of the room where the Shadows already
cover her and win her back with outstretched arms to her age-long sleep
in the House of the Past.</p>

<p>Trembling all over, with the strange odour still in my nostrils and
the fire in my heart, I turned away and followed my Dream up a broad
staircase into another part of the House.</p>

<p>As we entered the upper corridors I heard the wind pass singing over
the roof. Its music took possession of me until I felt as though my
whole body were a single heart, aching, straining, trobbing as if it
would break; and all because I heard the wind singing round the House
of the Past.</p>

<p>"But, remember," whispered the Dream, answering my unspoken wonder,
"that you are listening to the song it has sung for untold ages into
untold myriad ears. It carries back so appallingly far; and in that
simple dirge, profound in its terrible monotony, are the associations
and recollections of the joys, grieves, and struggles of all your
previous existence. The wind, like the sea, speaks to the inmost
memory," she added, "and that is why its voice is one of such deep
spiritual sadness. It is the song of things for ever incomplete,
unfinished, unsatisfying."</p>

<p>As we passed through the vaulted rooms, I noticed that no one
stirred. There was no actual sound, only a general impression of deep,
collective breathing, like the heave of a muffled ocean. But the rooms,
I knew at once, were full to the walls, crowded, rows upon rows ...And,
from the floors below, rose ever the murmur of the weeping Shadows as
they returned to their sleep, and settled down again in the silence,
the darkness, and the dust. The dust...Ah, the dust that floated in
this House of the Past, so thick, so penetrating; so fine, it filled
the throat and eyes without pain; so fragrant, it soothed the senses
and stilled the heart; so soft, it parched the tongue, without offence;
yet so silently falling, gathering, settling over everything, that the
air held it like a fine mist and the sleeping Shadows wore it for their
shrouds.</p>

<p>"And these are the oldest," said my Dream, "the longest asleep,"
pointing to the crowded rows of silent sleepers. "None here have
wakened for ages too many to count; and even if they woke you would not
know them. They are, like the others, all your own, but they are the
memories of your earliest stages along the great Path of Evolution.
Some day, though, they will awake, and you must know them, and answer
their questions, for they cannot die till they have exhausted
themselves again through you who gave them birth."</p>

<p>"Ah me," I thought, only half listening to or understanding these
last words, "what mothers, fathers, brothers may then be asleep in this
room; what faithful lovers, what true friends, what ancient enemies!
And to think that some day they will step forth and confront me, and I
shall meet their eyes again, claim them, know them, forgive, and be
forgiven...the memories of all my Past..."</p>

<p>I turned to speak to the Dream at my side, but she was already
fading into dimness, and, as I looked again, the whole House melted
away into the flush of the eastern sky, and I heard the birds singing
and saw the clouds overhead veiling the stars in the light of coming
day.</p>

<h2><a name="ch09"></a>Keeping His Promise</h2>

<p>It was eleven o'clock at night, and young Marriott was locked into
his room, cramming as hard as he could cram. He was a "Fourth Year Man"
at Edinburgh University and he had been ploughed for this particular
examination so often that his parents had positively declared they
could no longer supply the funds to keep him there.</p>

<p>His rooms were cheap and dingy, but it was the lecture fees that
took the money. So Marriott pulled himself together at last and
definitely made up his mind that he would pass or die in the attempt,
and for some weeks now he had been reading as hard as mortal man can
read. He was trying to make up for lost time and money in a way that
showed conclusively he did not understand the value of either. For no
ordinary man--and Marriott was in every sense an ordinary man--can
afford to drive the mind as he had lately been driving his, without
sooner or later paying the cost.</p>

<p>Among the students he had few friends or acquaintances, and these
few had promised not to disturb him at night, knowing he was at last
reading in earnest. It was, therefore, with feelings a good deal
stronger than mere surprise that he heard his door-bell ring on this
particular night and realised that he was to have a visitor. Some men
would simply have muffled the bell and gone on quietly with their work.
But Marriott was not this sort. He was nervous. It would have bothered
and pecked at his mind all night long not to know who the visitor was
and what he wanted. The only thing to do, therefore, was to let him
in--and out again--as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>The landlady went to bed at ten o'clock punctually, after which hour
nothing would induce her to pretend she heard the bell, so Marriott
jumped up from his books with an exclamation that augured ill for the
reception of his caller, and prepared to let him in with his own
hand.</p>

<p>The streets of Edinburgh town were very still at this late hour--it
was late for Edinburgh--and in the quiet neighbourhood of F--Street,
where Marriott lived on the third floor, scarcely a sound broke the
silence. As he crossed the floor, the bell rang a second time, with
unnecessary clamour, and he unlocked the door and passed into the
little hallway with considerable wrath and annoyance in his heart at
the insolence of the double interruption.</p>

<p>"The fellows all know I'm reading for this exam. Why in the world do
they come to bother me at such an unearthly hour?"</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the building, with himself, were medical
students, general students, poor Writers to the Signet, and some others
whose vocations were perhaps not so obvious. The stone staircase, dimly
lighted at each floor by a gas-jet that would not turn above a certain
height, wound down to the level of the street with no pretence at
carpet or railing. At some levels it was cleaner than at others. It
depended on the landlady of the particular level.</p>

<p>The acoustic properties of a spiral staircase seem to be peculiar.
Marriott, standing by the open door, book in hand, thought every moment
the owner of the footsteps would come into view. The sound of the boots
was so close and so loud that they seemed to travel disproportionately
in advance of their cause. Wondering who it could be, he stood ready
with all manner of sharp greetings for the man who dared thus to
disturb his work. But the man did not appear. The steps sounded almost
under his nose, yet no one was visible.</p>

<p>A sudden queer sensation of fear passed over him--a faintness and a
shiver down the back. It went, however, almost as soon as it came, and
he was just debating whether he would call aloud to his invisible
visitor, or slam the door and return to his books, when the cause of
the disturbance turned the corner very slowly and came into view.</p>

<p>It was a stranger. He saw a youngish man short of figure and very
broad. His face was the colour of a piece of chalk and the eyes, which
were very bright, had heavy lines underneath them. Though the cheeks
and chin were unshaven and the general appearance unkempt, the man was
evidently a gentleman, for he was well dressed and bore himself with a
certain air. But, strangest of all, he wore no hat, and carried none in
his hand; and although rain had been falling steadily all the evening,
he appeared to have neither overcoat nor umbrella.</p>

<p>A hundred questions sprang up in Marriott's mind and rushed to his
lips, chief among which was something like "Who in the world are you?"
and "What in the name of heaven do you come to me for?" But none of
these questions found time to express themselves in words, for almost
at once the caller turned his head a little so that the gas light in
the hall fell upon his features from a new angle. Then in a flash
Marriott recognised him.</p>

<p>"Field! Man alive! Is it you?" he gasped.</p>

<p>The Fourth Year Man was not lacking in intuition, and he perceived
at once that here was a case for delicate treatment. He divined,
without any actual process of thought, that the catastrophe often
predicted had come at last, and that this man's father had turned him
out of the house. They had been at a private school together years
before, and though they had hardly met once since, the news had not
failed to reach him from time to time with considerable detail, for the
family lived near his own and between certain of the sisters there was
great intimacy. Young Field had gone wild later, he remembered hearing
about it all--drink, a woman, opium, or something of the sort--he could
not exactly call to mind.</p>

<p>"Come in," he said at once, his anger vanishing. "There's been
something wrong, I can see. Come in, and tell me all about it and
perhaps I can help--" He hardly knew what to say, and stammered a lot
more besides. The dark side of life, and the horror of it, belonged to
a world that lay remote from his own select little atmosphere of books
and dreamings. But he had a man's heart for all that.</p>

<p>He led the way across the hall, shutting the front door carefully
behind him, and noticed as he did so that the other, though certainly
sober, was unsteady on his legs, and evidently much exhausted. Marriott
might not be able to pass his examinations, but he at least knew the
symptoms of starvation--acute starvation, unless he was much
mistaken--when they stared him in the face.</p>

<p>"Come along," he said cheerfully, and with genuine sympathy in his
voice. "I'm glad to see you. I was going to have a bite of something to
eat, and you're just in time to join me."</p>

<p>The other made no audible reply, and shuffled so feebly with his
feet that Marriott took his arm by way of support. He noticed for the
first time that the clothes hung on him with pitiful looseness. The
broad frame was literally hardly more than a frame. He was as thin as a
skeleton.</p>

<p>But, as he touched him, the sensation of faintness and dread
returned. It only lasted a moment, and then passed off and he ascribed
it not unnaturally to the distress and shock of seeing a former friend
in such a pitiful plight.</p>

<p>"Better let me guide you. It's shamefully dark--this hall. I'm
always complaining," he said lightly, recognising by the weight upon
his arm that the guidance was sorely needed, "but the old cat never
does anything except promise." He led him to the sofa, wondering all
the time where he had come from and how he had found out the address.
It must be at least seven years since those days at the private school
when they used to be such close friends.</p>

<p>"Now, if you'll forgive me for a minute," he said, "I'll get supper
ready--such as it is. And don't bother to talk. Just take it easy on
the sofa. I see you're dead tired. You can tell me about it afterwards,
and we'll make plans."</p>

<p>The other sat down on the edge of the sofa and stared in silence,
while Marriott got out the brown bag scones, and huge pot of marmalade
that Edinburgh students always keep in their cupboards. His eyes shone
with a brightness that suggested drugs, Marriott thought, stealing a
glance at him from behind the cupboard door. He did not like yet to
take a full square look. The fellow was in a bad way, and it would have
been so like an examination to stare and wait for explanations.
Besides, he was evidently almost too exhausted to speak. So, for
reasons of delicacy--and for another reason as well which he could not
exactly formulate to himself--he let his visitor rest apparently
unnoticed, while he busied himself with the supper. He lit the spirit
lamp to make cocoa, and when the water was boiling he drew up the table
with the good things to the sofa, so that Field need not have even the
trouble of moving to a chair.</p>

<p>"Now, let's tuck in," he said, "and afterwards we'll have a pipe and
a chat. I'm reading for an exam, you know, and I always have something
about this time. It's jolly to have a companion."</p>

<p>He looked up and caught his guest's eyes directed straight upon his
own. An involuntary shudder ran through him from head to foot. The face
opposite him was deadly white and wore a dreadful expression of pain
and mental suffering.</p>

<p>"By Gad!" he said, jumping up, "I quite forgot. I've got some whisky
somewhere. What an ass I am. I never touch it myself when I'm working
like this."</p>

<p>He went to the cupboard and poured out a stiff glass which the other
swallowed at a single gulp and without any water. Marriott watched him
while he drank it, and at the same time noticed something else as
well--Field's coat was all over dust, and on one shoulder was a bit of
cobweb. It was perfectly dry; Field arrived on a soaking wet night
without hat, umbrella, or overcoat, and yet perfectly dry, even dusty.
Therefore he had been under cover. What did it all mean? Had he been
hiding in the building...?</p>

<p>It was very strange. Yet he volunteered nothing; and Marriott had
pretty well made up his mind by this time that he would not ask any
questions until he had eaten and slept. Food and sleep were obviously
what the poor devil needed most and first he was pleased with his
powers of ready diagnosis and it would not be fair to press him till he
had recovered a bit.</p>

<p>They ate their supper together while the host carried on a running
one-sided conversation, chiefly about himself and his exams and his
"old cat" of a landlady, so that the guest need not utter a single word
unless he really wished to--which he evidently did not! But, while he
toyed with his food, feeling no desire to eat, the other ate
voraciously. To see a hungry man devour cold scones, stale oatcake, and
brown bread laden with marmalade was a revelation to this inexperienced
student who had never known what it was to be without at least three
meals a day.</p>

<p>He watched in spite of himself, wondering why the fellow did not
choke in the process.</p>

<p>But Field seemed to be as sleepy as he was hungry. More than once
his head dropped and he ceased to masticate the food in his mouth.
Marriott had positively to shake him before he would go on with his
meal. A stronger emotion will overcome a weaker, but this struggle
between the sting of real hunger and the magical opiate of overpowering
sleep was a curious sight to the student, who watched it with mingled
astonishment and alarm. He had heard of the pleasure it was to feed
hungry men, and watch them eat, but he had never actually witnessed it
and he had no idea it was like this. Field ate like an animal--gobbled,
stuffed, gorged. Marriott forgot his reading, and began to feel
something very much like a lump in his throat.</p>

<p>"Afraid there's been awfully little to offer you, old man," he
managed to blurt out when at length the last scone had disappeared, and
the rapid, one-sided meal was at an end. Field still made no reply, for
he was almost asleep in his seat. He merely looked up wearily and
gratefully.</p>

<p>"Now you must have some sleep, you know," he continued, "or you'll
go to pieces. I shall be up all night reading for this blessed exam.
You're more than welcome to my bed. To-morrow we'll have a late
breakfast and--and see what can be done--and make plans--I'm awfully
good at making plans, you know," he added with an attempt at
lightness.</p>

<p>Field maintained his "dead sleepy" silence, but appeared to
acquiesce, and the other led the way into the bedroom, apologising as
he did so to this half-starved son of a baronet--whose own home was
almost a palace--for the size of the room. The weary guest, however,
made no pretence of thanks or politeness. He merely steadied himself on
his friend's arm as he staggered across the room, and then, with all
his clothes on, dropped his exhausted body on the bed. In less than a
minute he was to all appearances sound asleep.</p>

<p>For several minutes Marriott stood in the open door and watched him;
praying devoutly that he might never find himself in a like
predicament, and then fell to wondering what he would do with his
unbidden guest on the morrow. But he did not stop long to think, for
the call of his books was imperative, and happen what might, he must
see to it that he passed that examination.</p>

<p>Having again locked the door into the hall, he sat down to his books
and resumed his notes on materia medica where he had left off when the
bell rang. But it was difficult for some time to concentrate his mind
on the subject. His thoughts kept wandering to the picture of that
white-faced, strange-eyed fellow, starved and dirty, lying in his
clothes and boots on the bed. He recalled their schooldays together
before they had drifted apart, and how they had vowed eternal
friendship--and all the rest of it. And now! What horrible straits to
be in. How could any man let the love of dissipation take such hold
upon him?</p>

<p>But one of their vows together Marriott, it seemed, had completely
forgotten. Just now, at any rate, it lay too far in the background of
his memory to be recalled.</p>

<p>Through the half-open door--the bedroom led out of the sitting-room
and had no other door--came the sound of deep, long-drawn breathing,
the regular, steady breathing of a tired man, so tired that, even to
listen to it made Marriott almost want to go to sleep himself.</p>

<p>"He needed it," reflected the student, "and perhaps it came only
just in time!"</p>

<p>Perhaps so; for outside the bitter wind from across the Forth howled
cruelly and drove the rain in cold streams against the window-panes,
and down the deserted streets. Long before Marriott settled down again
properly to his reading, he heard distantly, as it were, through the
sentences of the book, the heavy, deep breathing of the sleeper in the
next room.</p>

<p>A couple of hours later, when he yawned and changed his books, he
still heard the breathing, and went cautiously up to the door to look
round.</p>

<p>At first the darkness of the room must have deceived him, or else
his eyes were confused and dazzled by the recent glare of the reading
lamp. For a minute or two he could make out nothing at all but dark
lumps of furniture, the mass of the chest of drawers by the wall, and
the white patch where his bath stood in the centre of the floor.</p>

<p>Then the bed came slowly into view. And on it he saw the outline of
the sleeping body gradually take shape before his eyes, growing up
strangely into the darkness, till it stood out in marked relief--the
long black form against the white counterpane.</p>

<p>He could hardly help smiling. Field had not moved an inch. He
watched him a moment or two and then returned to his books. The night
was full of the singing voices of the wind and rain.</p>

<p>There was no sound of traffic; no hansoms clattered over the
cobbles, and it was still too early for the milk carts. He worked on
steadily and conscientiously, only stopping now and again to change a
book, or to sip some of the poisonous stuff that kept him awake and
made his brain so active, and on these occasions Field's breathing was
always distinctly audible in the room.</p>

<p>Outside, the storm continued to howl, but inside the house all was
stillness. The shade of the reading lamp threw all the light upon the
littered table, leaving the other end of the room in comparative
darkness. The bedroom door was exactly opposite him where he sat. There
was nothing to disturb the worker, nothing but an occasional rush of
wind against the windows, and a slight pain in his arm.</p>

<p>This pain, however, which he was unable to account for, grew once or
twice very acute. It bothered him; and he tried to remember how, and
when, he could have bruised himself so severely, but without
success.</p>

<p>At length the page before him turned from yellow to grey, and there
were sounds of wheels in the street below. It was four o'clock.
Marriott leaned back and yawned prodigiously. Then he drew back the
curtains. The storm had subsided and the Castle Rock was shrouded in
mist. With another yawn he turned away from the dreary outlook and
prepared to sleep the remaining four hours till breakfast on the sofa.
Field was still breathing heavily in the next room, and he first
tip-toed across the floor to take another look at him.</p>

<p>Peering cautiously round the half-opened door his first glance fell
upon the bed now plainly discernible in the grey light of morning. He
stared hard. Then he rubbed his eyes. Then he rubbed his eyes again and
thrust his head farther round the edge of the door. With fixed eyes he
stared harder still, and harder.</p>

<p>But it made no difference at all. He was staring into an empty
room.</p>

<p>The sensation of fear he had felt when Field first appeared upon the
scene returned suddenly, but with much greater force. He became
conscious, too, that his left arm was throbbing violently and causing
him great pain. He stood wondering, and staring, and trying to collect
his thoughts.</p>

<p>He was trembling from head to foot.</p>

<p>By a great effort of the will he left the support of the door and
walked forward boldly into the room.</p>

<p>There, upon the bed, was the impress of a body, where Field had lain
and slept. There was the mark of the head on the pillow, and the slight
indentation at the foot of the bed where the boots had rested on the
counterpane. And there, plainer than ever--for he was closer to it--was
the breathing!</p>

<p>Marriott tried to pull himself together. With a great effort he
found his voice and called his friend aloud by name!</p>

<p>"Field! Is that you? Where are you?"</p>

<p>There was no reply; but the breathing continued without
interruption, coming directly from the bed. His voice had such an
unfamiliar sound that Marriott did not care to repeat his questions,
but he went down on his knees and examined the bed above and below,
pulling the mattress off finally, and taking the coverings away
separately one by one. But though the sounds continued there was no
visible sign of Field, nor was there any space in which a human being,
however small, could have concealed itself. He pulled the bed out from
the wall, but the sound stayed where it was. It did not move with the
bed.</p>

<p>Marriott, finding self-control a little difficult in his weary
condition, at once set about a thorough search of the room. He went
through the cupboard, the chest of drawers, the little alcove where the
clothes hung--everything. But there was no sign of anyone. The small
window near the ceiling was closed; and, anyhow, was not large enough
to let a cat pass. The sitting-room door was locked on the inside; he
could not have got out that way. Curious thoughts began to trouble
Marriott's mind, bringing in their train unwelcome sensations. He grew
more and more excited; he searched the bed again till it resembled the
scene of a pillow fight; he searched both rooms, knowing all the time
it was useless,--and then he searched again. A cold perspiration broke
out all over his body; and the sound of heavy breathing, all this time,
never ceased to come from the corner where Field had lain down to
sleep.</p>

<p>Then he tried something else. He pushed the bed back exactly into
its original position--and himself lay down upon it just where his
guest had lain. But the same instant he sprang up again in a single
bound. The breathing was close beside him, almost on his cheek, and
between him and the wall! Not even a child could have squeezed into the
space.</p>

<p>He went back into his sitting-room, opened the windows, welcoming
all the light and air possible, and tried to think the whole matter
over quietly and clearly. Men who read too hard, and slept too little,
he knew were sometimes troubled with very vivid hallucinations. Again
he calmly reviewed every incident of the night; his accurate
sensations; the vivid details; the emotions stirred in him; the
dreadful feast--no single hallucination could ever combine all these
and cover so long a period of time. But with less satisfaction he
thought of the recurring faintness, and curious sense of horror that
had once or twice come over him, and then of the violent pains in his
arm. These were quite unaccountable.</p>

<p>Moreover, now that he began to analyse and examine, there was one
other thing that fell upon him like a sudden revelation: During the
whole time Field had not actually uttered a single word! Yet, as though
in mockery upon his reflections, there came ever from that inner room
the sound of the breathing, long-drawn, deep, and regular. The thing
was incredible. It was absurd.</p>

<p>Haunted by visions of brain fever and insanity, Marriott put on his
cap and macintosh and left the house. The morning air on Arthur's Seat
would blow the cobwebs from his brain; the scent of the heather, and
above all, the sight of the sea. He roamed over the wet slopes above
Holyrood for a couple of hours, and did not return until the exercise
had shaken some of the horror out of his bones, and given him a
ravening appetite into the bargain.</p>

<p>As he entered he saw that there was another man in the room,
standing against the window with his back to the light. He recognised
his fellow-student Greene, who was reading for the same
examination.</p>

<p>"Read hard all night, Marriott," he said, "and thought I'd drop in
here to compare notes and have some breakfast. You're out early?" he
added, by way of a question. Marriott said he had a headache and a walk
had helped it, and Greene nodded and said "Ah!" But when the girl had
set the steaming porridge on the table and gone out again, he went on
with rather a forced tone, "Didn't know you had any friends who drank,
Marriott?"</p>

<p>This was obviously tentative, and Marriott replied drily that he did
not know it either.</p>

<p>"Sounds just as if some chap were 'sleeping it off' in there,
doesn't it, though?" persisted the other, with a nod in the direction
of the bedroom, and looking curiously at his friend. The two men stared
steadily at each other for several seconds, and then Marriott said
earnestly--"Then you hear it too, thank God!"</p>

<p>"Of course I hear it. The door's open. Sorry if I wasn't meant
to."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mean that," said Marriott, lowering his voice. "But I'm
awfully relieved. Let me explain. Of course, if you hear it too, then
it's all right; but really it frightened me more than I can tell you. I
thought I was going to have brain fever, or something, and you know
what a lot depends on this exam. It always begins with sounds, or
visions, or some sort of beastly hallucination, and I--"</p>

<p>"Rot!" ejaculated the other impatiently. "What are you talking
about?"</p>

<p>"Now, listen to me, Greene," said Marriott, as calmly as he could,
for the breathing was still plainly audible, "and I'll tell you what I
mean, only don't interrupt." And thereupon he related exactly what had
happened during the night, telling everything, even down to the pain in
his arm.</p>

<p>When it was over he got up from the table and crossed the room.</p>

<p>"You hear the breathing now plainly, don't you?" he said. Greene
said he did. "Well, come with me, and we'll search the room together."
The other, however, did not move from his chair.</p>

<p>"I've been in already," he said sheepishly; "I heard the sounds and
thought it was you. The door was ajar--so I went in."</p>

<p>Marriott made no comment, but pushed the door open as wide as it
would go. As it opened, the sound of breathing grew more and more
distinct.</p>

<p>"Someone must be in there," said Greene under his breath.</p>

<p>"Someone is in there, but where?" said Marriott. Again he urged his
friend to go in with him.</p>

<p>But Greene refused point-blank: said he had been in once and had
searched the room and there was nothing there. He would not go in again
for a good deal.</p>

<p>They shut the door and retired into the other room to talk it all
over with many pipes. Greene questioned his friend very closely, but
without illuminating result, since questions cannot alter facts.</p>

<p>"The only thing that ought to have a proper, a logical, explanation
is the pain in my arm. " said Marriott, rubbing that member with an
attempt at a smile. "It hurts so infernally and aches all the way up. I
can't remember bruising it, though."</p>

<p>"Let me examine it for you," said Greene. "I'm awfully good at bones
in spite of the examiners' opinion to the contrary." It was a relief to
play the fool a bit, and Marriott took his coat off and rolled up his
sleeve.</p>

<p>"By George, though, I'm bleeding!" he exclaimed. "Look here! What on
earth's this?"</p>

<p>On the forearm, quite close to the wrist, was a thin red line. There
was a tiny drop of apparently fresh blood on it. Greene came over and
looked closely at it for some minutes. Then he sat back in his chair,
looking curiously at his friend's face.</p>

<p>"You've scratched yourself without knowing it," he said
presently.</p>

<p>"There's no sign of a bruise. It must be something else that made
the arm ache."</p>

<p>Marriott sat very still, staring silently at his arm as though the
solution of the whole mystery lay there actually written upon the
skin.</p>

<p>"What's the matter? I see nothing very strange about a scratch,"
said Greene, in an unconvincing sort of voice. "It was your cuff links
probably. Last night in your excitement--"</p>

<p>But Marriott, white to the very lips, was trying to speak. The sweat
stood in great beads on his forehead. At last he leaned forward close
to his friend's face.</p>

<p>"Look," he said, in a low voice that shook a little. "Do you see
that red mark? I mean underneath what you call the scratch?"</p>

<p>Greene admitted he saw something or other, and Marriott wiped the
place clean with his handkerchief and told him to look again more
closely.</p>

<p>"Yes, I see," returned the other, lifting his head after a moment's
careful inspection. "It looks like an old scar."</p>

<p>"It is an old scar," whispered Marriott, his lips trembling. "Now it
all comes back to me."</p>

<p>"All what?" Greene fidgeted on his chair. He tried to laugh, but
without success. His friend seemed bordering on collapse.</p>

<p>"Hush! Be quiet, and--I'll tell you," he said. "Field made that
scar."</p>

<p>For a whole minute the two men looked each other full in the face
without speaking.</p>

<p>"Field made that scar!" repeated Marriott at length in a louder
voice.</p>

<p>"Field! You mean--last night?"</p>

<p>"No, not last night. Years ago--at school, with his knife. And I
made a scar in his arm with mine." Marriott was talking rapidly
now.</p>

<p>"We exchanged drops of blood in each other's cuts. He put a drop
into my arm and I put one into his--"</p>

<p>"In the name of heaven, what for?"</p>

<p>"It was a boys' compact. We made a sacred pledge, a bargain. I
remember it all perfectly now. We had been reading some dreadful book
and we swore to appear to one another--I mean, whoever died first swore
to show himself to the other. And we sealed the compact with each
other's blood. I remember it all so well--the hot summer afternoon in
the playground, seven years ago--and one of the masters caught us and
confiscated the knives--and I have never thought of it again to this
day--"</p>

<p>"And you mean--" stammered Greene.</p>

<p>But Marriott made no answer. He got up and crossed the room and lay
down wearily upon the sofa, hiding his face in his hands.</p>

<p>Greene himself was a bit non-plussed. He left his friend alone for a
little while, thinking it all over again. Suddenly an idea seemed to
strike him. He went over to where Marriott still lay motionless on the
sofa and roused him. In any case it was better to face the matter,
whether there was an explanation or not. Giving in was always the silly
exit.</p>

<p>"I say, Marriott," he began, as the other turned his white face up
to him. "There's no good being so upset about it. I mean--if it's all
an hallucination we know what to do. And if it isn't--well, we know
what to think, don't we?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so. But it frightens me horribly for some reason,"
returned his friend in a hushed voice. "And that poor devil--"</p>

<p>"But, after all, if the worst is true and--and that chap has kept
his promise--well, he has, that's all, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Marriott nodded.</p>

<p>"There's only one thing that occurs to me," Greene went on, "and
that is, are you quite sure that--that he really ate like that--I mean
that he actually ate anything at all?" he finished, blurting out all
his thought.</p>

<p>Marriott stared at him for a moment and then said he could easily
make certain. He spoke quietly. After the main shock no lesser surprise
could affect him.</p>

<p>"I put the things away myself" he said, "after we had finished. They
are on the third shelf in that cupboard. No one's touched 'em
since."</p>

<p>He pointed without getting up, and Greene took the hint and went
over to look.</p>

<p>"Exactly," he said, after a brief examination; "just as I thought.
It was partly hallucination, at any rate. The things haven't been
touched. Come and see for yourself."</p>

<p>Together they examined the shelf. There was the brown loaf, the
plate of stale scones, the oatcake, all untouched. Even the glass of
whisky Marriott had poured out stood there with the whisky still in
it.</p>

<p>"You were feeding--no one," said Greene. "Field ate and drank
nothing. He was not there at all!"</p>

<p>"But the breathing?" urged the other in a low voice, staring with a
dazed expression on his face.</p>

<p>Greene did not answer. He walked over to the bedroom, while Marriott
followed him with his eyes. He opened the door, and listened. There was
no need for words. The sound of deep, regular breathing came floating
through the air. There was no hallucination about that, at any rate.
Marriott could hear it where he stood on the other side of the
room.</p>

<p>Greene closed the door and came back. "There's only one thing to
do," he declared with decision. "Write home and find out about him, and
meanwhile come and finish your reading in my rooms. I've got an extra
bed."</p>

<p>"Agreed," returned the Fourth Year Man; "there's no hallucination
about that exam; I must pass that whatever happens."</p>

<p>And this was what they did.</p>

<p>It was about a week later when Marriott got the answer from his
sister. Part of it he read out to Greene--"It is curious," she wrote,
"that in your letter you should have enquired after Field. It seems a
terrible thing, but you know only a short while ago Sir John's patience
became exhausted, and he turned him out of the house, they say without
a penny. Well, what do you think? He has killed himself. At least, it
looks like suicide. Instead of leaving the house, he went down into the
cellar and simply starved himself to death...They're trying to suppress
it, of course, but I heard it all from my maid, who got it from their
footman...They found the body on the 14th and the doctor said he had
died about twelve hours before...He was dreadfully thin..."</p>

<p>"Then he died on the 13th," said Greene.</p>

<p>Marriott nodded.</p>

<p>"That's the very night he came to see you."</p>

<p>Marriott nodded again.</p>

<h2><a name="ch10"></a>The Listener</h2>

<p>Sept. 4.--I have hunted all over London for rooms suited to my
income--&pound;120 a year--and have at last found them. Two rooms,
without modern conveniences, it is true, and in an old, ramshackle
building, but within a stone's throw of P--Place and in an eminently
respectable street. The rent is only &pound;25 a year. I had begun to
despair when at last I found them by chance.</p>

<p>The chance was a mere chance, and unworthy of record. I had to sign
a lease for a year, and I did so willingly. The furniture from our old
place in Hampshire, which has been stored so long, will just suit
them.</p>

<p>Oct. 1.--Here I am in my two rooms, in the centre of London, and not
far from the offices of the periodicals, where occasionally I dispose
of an article or two. The building is at the end of a cul-de-sac. The
alley is well paved and clean, and lined chiefly with the backs of
sedate and institutional-looking buildings. There is a stable in it. My
own house is dignified with the title of "Chambers ". I feel as if one
day the honour must prove too much for it, and it will swell with
pride--and fall asunder. It is very old. The floor of my sitting-room
has valleys and low hills on it, and the top of the door slants away
from the ceiling with a glorious disregard of what is usual.</p>

<p>They must have quarrelled--fifty years ago--and have been going
apart ever since.</p>

<p>Oct. 2.--My landlady is old and thin, with a faded, dusty face. She
is uncommunicative. The few words she utters seem to cost her pain.
Probably her lungs are half choked with dust. She keeps my rooms as
free from this commodity as possible, and has the assistance of a
strong girl who brings up the breakfast and lights the fire. As I have
said already, she is not communicative.</p>

<p>In reply to pleasant efforts on my part she informed me briefly that
I was the only occupant of the house at present. My rooms had not been
occupied for some years. There had been other gentlemen upstairs, but
they had left.</p>

<p>She never looks straight at me when she speaks, but fixes her dim
eyes on my middle waistcoat button, till I get nervous and begin to
think it isn't on straight, or is the wrong sort of button
altogether.</p>

<p>Oct. 8.--My week's book is nicely kept, and so far is reasonable.
Milk and sugar 7d., bread 6d., butter 8d., marmalade 6d., eggs 1s. 8d.,
laundress 2s. 9d., oil 6d., attendance 5s.; total 12s. 2d.</p>

<p>The landlady has a son who, she told me, is "somethink on a
homnibus". He comes occasionally to see her. I think he drinks, for he
talks very loud, regardless of the hour of the day or night, and
tumbles about over the furniture downstairs.</p>

<p>All the morning I sit indoors writing--articles; verses for the
comic papers; a novel I've been "at" for three years, and concerning
which I have dreams; a children's book, in which the imagination has
free rein; and another book which is to last as long as myself, since
it is an honest record of my soul's advance or retreat in the struggle
of life. Besides these, I keep a book of poems which I use as a safety
valve, and concerning which I have no dreams whatsoever.</p>

<p>Between the lot I am always occupied. In the afternoons I generally
try to take a walk for my health's sake, through Regent's Park, into
Kensington Gardens, or farther afield to Hampstead Heath.</p>

<p>Oct. 10.--Everything went wrong to-day. I have two eggs for
breakfast. This morning one of them was bad. I rang the bell for Emily.
When she came in I was reading the paper, and, without looking up, I
said, "Egg's bad." "Oh, is it, sir?" she said; "I'll get another one,"
and went out, taking the egg with her. I waited my breakfast for her
return, which was in five minutes. She put the new egg on the table and
went away. But, when I looked down, I saw that she had taken away the
good egg and left the bad one--all green and yellow--in the slop basin.
I rang again.</p>

<p>"You've taken the wrong egg," I said.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she exclaimed; "I thought the one I took down didn't smell so
very bad." In due time she returned with the good egg, and I resumed my
breakfast with two eggs, but less appetite. It was all very trivial, to
be sure, but so stupid that I felt annoyed. The character of that egg
influenced everything I did. I wrote a bad article, and tore it up. I
got a bad headache. I used bad words--to myself. Everything was bad, so
I "chucked" work and went for a long walk.</p>

<p>I dined at a cheap chop-house on my way back, and reached home about
nine o'clock.</p>

<p>Rain was just beginning to fall as I came in, and the wind was
rising. It promised an ugly night. The alley looked dismal and dreary,
and the hall of the house, as I passed through it, felt chilly as a
tomb. It was the first stormy night I had experienced in my new
quarters. The draughts were awful. They came criss-cross, met in the
middle of the room, and formed eddies and whirlpools and cold silent
currents that almost lifted the hair of my head. I stuffed up the
sashes of the windows with neckties and odd socks, and sat over the
smoky fire to keep warm. First I tried to write, but found it too cold.
My hand turned to ice on the paper.</p>

<p>What tricks the wind did play with the old place! It came rushing up
the forsaken alley with a sound like the feet of a hurrying crowd of
people who stopped suddenly at the door. I felt as if a lot of curious
folk had arranged themselves just outside and were staring up at my
windows.</p>

<p>Then they took to their heels again and fled whispering and laughing
down the lane, only, however, to return with the next gust of wind and
repeat their impertinence. On the other side of my room a single square
window opens into a sort of shaft, or well, that measures about six
feet across to the back wall of another house. Down this funnel the
wind dropped, and puffed and shouted. Such noises I never heard before.
Between these two entertainments I sat over the fire in a great-coat,
listening to the deep booming in the chimney. It was like being in a
ship at sea, and I almost looked for the floor to rise in undulations
and rock to and fro.</p>

<p>Oct. 12.--I wish I were not quite so lonely--and so poor. And yet I
love both my loneliness and my poverty. The former makes me appreciate
the companionship of the wind and rain, while the latter preserves my
liver and prevents me wasting time in dancing attendance upon
women.</p>

<p>Poor, ill-dressed men are not acceptable "attendants".</p>

<p>My parents are dead, and my only sister is--no, not dead exactly,
but married to a very rich man. They travel most of the time, he to
find his health, she to lose herself. Through sheer neglect on her part
she has long passed out of my life. The door closed when, after an
absolute silence of five years, she sent me a cheque for &pound;50 at
Christmas. It was signed by her husband! I returned it to her in a
thousand pieces and in an unstamped envelope. So at least I had the
satisfaction of knowing that it cost her something! She wrote back with
a broad quill pen that covered a whole page with three lines, "You are
evidently as cracked as ever, and rude and ungrateful into the
bargain." It had always been my special terror lest the insanity of my
father's family should leap across the generations and appear in me.
This thought haunted me, and she knew it. So after this little exchange
of civilities the door slammed, never to open again. I heard the crash
it made, and, with it, the falling from the walls of my heart of many
little bits of china with their own peculiar value--rare china, some of
it, that only needed dusting. The same walls, too, carried mirrors in
which I used sometimes to see reflected the misty lawns of childhood,
the daisy chains, the wind-torn blossoms scattered through the orchard
by warm rains, the robbers' cave in the long walk, and the hidden store
of apples in the hayloft. She was my inseparable companion then--but,
when the door slammed, the mirrors cracked across their entire length,
and the visions they held vanished for ever. Now I am quite alone. At
forty one cannot begin all over again to build up careful friendships,
and all others are comparatively worthless.</p>

<p>Oct. 14.--My bedroom is 10 by 10. It is below the level of the front
room, and a step leads down into it. Both rooms are very quiet on calm
nights, for there is no traffic down this forsaken alley-way. In spite
of the occasional larks of the wind, it is a most sheltered strip. At
its upper end, below my windows, all the cats of the neighbourhood
congregate as soon as darkness gathers. They lie undisturbed on the
long ledge of a blind window of the opposite building, for after the
postman has come and gone at 9.30, no footsteps ever dare to interrupt
their sinister conclave, no step but my own, or sometimes the unsteady
footfall of the son who "is somethink on a homnibus".</p>

<p>Oct. 15.--I dined at an "A.B.C." shop on poached eggs and coffee,
and then went for a stroll round the outer edge of Regent's Park. It
was ten o'clock when I got home, I counted no less than thirteen cats,
all of a dark colour, crouching under the lee side of the alley walls.
It was a cold night, and the stars shone like points of ice in a
blue-black sky. The cats turned their heads and stared at me in silence
as I passed. An odd sensation of shyness took possession of me under
the glare of so many pairs of unblinking eyes. As I fumbled with the
latch-key they jumped noiselessly down and pressed against my legs, as
if anxious to be let in. But I slammed the door in their faces and ran
quickly upstairs. The front room, as I entered to grope for the
matches, felt as cold as a stone vault, and the air held an unusual
dampness.</p>

<p>Oct. 17.--For several days I have been working on a ponderous
article that allows no play for the fancy. My imagination requires a
judicious rein; I am afraid to let it loose, for it carries me
sometimes into appalling places beyond the stars and beneath the world.
No one realises the danger more than I do. But what a foolish thins to
write here--for there is no one to know, no one to realize! My mind of
late has held unusual thoughts, thoughts I have never had before, about
medicines and drugs and the treatment of strange illnesses. I cannot
imagine their source.</p>

<p>At no time in my life have I dwelt upon such ideas now constantly
throng my brain. I have had no exercise lately, for the weather has
been shocking; and all my afternoons have been spent in the
reading-room of the British Museum, where I have a reader's ticket.</p>

<p>I have made an unpleasant discovery: there are rats in the house. At
night from my bed I have heard them scampering across the hills and
valleys of the front room, and my sleep has been a good deal disturbed
in consequence.</p>

<p>Oct. 19.--The landlady, I find, has a little boy with her, probably
her son's child. In fine weather he plays in the alley, and draws a
wooden cart over the cobbles. One of the wheels is off, and it makes a
most distracting noise. After putting up with it as long as possible, I
found it was getting on my nerves, and I could not write. So I rang the
bell. Emily answered it.</p>

<p>"Emily, will you ask the little fellow to make less noise? It's
impossible to work."</p>

<p>The girl went downstairs, and soon afterwards the child was called
in by the kitchen door. I felt rather a brute for spoiling his play. In
a few minutes, however, the noise began again, and I felt that he was
the brute. He dragged the broken toy with a string over the stones till
the rattling noise jarred every nerve in my body. It became unbearable,
and I rang the bell a second time.</p>

<p>"That noise must be put a stop to!" I said to the girl, with
decision.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," she grinned, "I know; but one of the wheels is hoff. The
men in the stable offered to mend it for 'im, but he wouldn't let them.
He says he likes it that way."</p>

<p>"I can't help what he likes. The noise must stop. I can't
write."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I'll tell Mrs. Monson."</p>

<p>The noise stopped for the day then.</p>

<p>Oct. 23.--Every day for the past week that cart has rattled over the
stones, till I have come to think of it as a huge carrier's van with
four wheels and two horses; and every morning I have been obliged to
ring the bell and have it stopped. The last time Mrs. Monson herself
came up, and said she was sorry I had been annoyed; the sounds should
not occur again. With rare discursiveness she went on to ask if I was
comfortable, and how I liked the rooms. I replied cautiously. I
mentioned the rats. She said they were mice. I spoke of the draughts.
She said, "Yes, it were a draughty 'ouse." I referred to the cats, and
she said they had been as long as she could remember. By way of
conclusion, she informed me that the house was over two hundred years
old, and that the last gentleman who had occupied my rooms was a
painter who "'ad real Jimmy Bueys and Raffles 'anging all hover the
walls". It took me some moments to discern that Cimabue and Raphael
were in the woman's mind.</p>

<p>Oct. 24.--Last night the son who is "somethink on a homnibus" came
in. He had evidently been drinking, for I heard loud and angry voices
below in the kitchen long after I had gone to bed. Once, too, I caught
the singular words rising up to me through the floor, "Burning from top
to bottom is the only thing that'll ever make this 'ouse right." I
knocked on the floor, and the voices ceased suddenly, though later I
again heard their clamour in my dreams.</p>

<p>These rooms are very quiet, almost too quiet sometimes. On windless
nights they are silent as the grave, and the house might be miles in
the country. The roar of London's traffic reaches me only in heavy,
distant vibrations. It holds an ominous note sometimes, like that of an
approaching army, or an immense tidal-wave very far away thundering in
the night.</p>

<p>Oct. 27.--Mrs. Monson, though admirably silent, is a foolish, fussy
woman. She does such stupid things. In dusting the room she puts all my
things in the wrong places. The ash-trays, which should be on the
writing-table, she sets in a silly row on the mantelpiece. The
pen-tray, which should be beside the inkstand, she hides away cleverly
among the books on my reading-desk.</p>

<p>My gloves she arranges daily in idiotic array upon a half-filled
bookshelf, and I always have to rearrange them on the low table by the
door. She places my ar--hair at impossible angles between the fire and
the light, and the tablecloth--the one with Trinity Hall stains--she
puts on the table in such a fashion that when I look at it I feel as if
my tie and all my clothes were on crooked and awry. She exasperates me.
Her very silence and meekness are irritating.</p>

<p>Sometimes I feel inclined to throw the inkstand at her, just to
bring an expression into her watery eyes and a squeak from those
colourless lips. Dear me! What violent expressions I am making use of!
How very foolish of me! And yet it almost seems as if the words were
not my own, but had been spoken into my ear--I mean, I never make use
of such terms naturally.</p>

<p>Oct. 30.--I have been here a month. The place does not agree with
me, I think. My headaches are more frequent and violent, and my nerves
are a perpetual source of discomfort and annoyance.</p>

<p>I have conceived a great dislike for Mrs. Monson, a feeling I am
certain she reciprocates.</p>

<p>Somehow, the impression comes frequently to me that there are goings
on in this house of which I know nothing, and which she is careful to
hide from me.</p>

<p>Last night her son slept in the house, and this morning as I was
standing at the window I saw him go out. He glanced up and caught my
eye. It was a loutish figure and a singularly repulsive face that I
saw, and he gave me the benefit of a very unpleasant leer. At least, so
I imagined.</p>

<p>Evidently I am getting absurdly sensitive to trifles, and I suppose
it is my disordered nerves making themselves felt. In the British
Museum this afternoon I noticed several people at the readers' table
staring at me and watching every movement I made. Whenever I looked up
from my books I found their eyes upon me. It seemed to me unnecessary
and unpleasant, and I left earlier than was my custom. When I reached
the door I threw back a last look into the room, and saw every head at
the table turned in my direction. It annoyed me very much, and yet I
know it is foolish to take note of such things. When I am well they
pass me by. I must get more regular exercise. Of late I have had next
to none.</p>

<p>Nov. 2.--The utter stillness of this house is beginning to oppress
me. I wish there were other fellows living upstairs. No footsteps ever
sound overhead, and no tread ever passes my door to go up the next
flight of stairs. I am beginning to feel some curiosity to go up myself
and see what the upper rooms are like. I feel lonely here and isolated,
swept into a deserted corner of the world and forgotten...Once I
actually caught myself gazing into the long, cracked mirrors, trying to
sec the sunlight dancing beneath the trees in the orchard. But only
deep shadows seemed to congregate there now, and I soon desisted.</p>

<p>It has been very dark all day, and no wind stirring. The fogs have
begun. I had to use a reading-lamp all this morning. There was no cart
to be heard to-day. I actually missed it. This morning, in the gloom
and silence, I think I could almost have welcomed it. After all, the
sound is a very human one, and this empty house at the end of the alley
holds other noises that are not quite so satisfactory.</p>

<p>I have never once seen a policeman in the lane, and the postmen
always hurry out with no evidence of a desire to loiter.</p>

<p>10 p.m.--As I write this I hear no sound but the deep murmur of the
distant traffic and the low sighing of the wind. The two sounds melt
into one another. Now and again a cat raises its shrill, uncanny cry
upon the darkness. The cats are always there under my windows when the
darkness falls. The wind is dropping into the funnel with a noise like
the sudden sweeping of immense distant wings. It is a dreary night. I
feel lost and forgotten.</p>

<p>Nov. 3--From my windows I can see arrivals. When anyone comes to the
door I can just see the hat and shoulders and the hand on the bell.
Only two fellows have been to see me since I came here two months ago.
Both of them I saw from the window before they came tip, and heard
their voices asking if I was in. Neither of them ever came back.</p>

<p>I have finished the ponderous article. On reading it through,
however, I was dissatisfied with it, and drew my pencil through almost
every page. There were strange expressions and ideas in it, that I
could not explain, and viewed with amazement, not to say alarm. They
did not sound like my very own, and I could not remember having written
them. Can it be that my memory is beginning to be affected?</p>

<p>My pens are never to be found. That stupid old woman puts them in a
different place each day. I must give her due credit for finding so
many new hiding places; such ingenuity is wonderful. I have told her
repeatedly, but she always says, "I'll speak to Emily, sir." Emily
always says, "I'll tell Mrs. Monson, sir." Their foolishness makes me
irritable and scatters all my thoughts. I should like to stick the lost
pens into them and turn them out, blind-eyed, to be scratched and
mauled by those thousand hungry cats. Whew! What a ghastly thought!
Where in the world did it come from? Such an idea is no more my own
than it is the policeman's. Yet I felt I had to write it. It was like a
voice singing in my head, and my pen wouldn't stop till the last word
was finished. What ridiculous nonsense! I must and will restrain
myself. I must take more regular exercise; my nerves and liver plague
me horribly.</p>

<p>Nov. 4.--I attended a curious lecture in the French quarter on
"Death", but the room was so hot and I was so weary that I fell asleep.
The only part I heard, however, touched my imagination vividly.
Speaking of suicides, the lecturer said that self-murder was no escape
from the miseries of the present, but only a preparation of greater
sorrow for the future. Suicides, he declared, cannot shirk their
responsibilities so easily. They must return to take up life exactly
where they laid it so violently down, but with the added pain and
punishment of their weakness. Many of them wander the earth in
unspeakable misery till they can reclothe themselves in the body of
someone else--generally a lunatic, or weak-minded person, who cannot
resist the hideous obsession. This is their only means of escape.
Surely a weird and horrible idea! I wish I had slept all the time and
not heard it at all. My mind is morbid enough without such ghastly
fancies. Such mischievous propaganda should be stopped by the police.
I'll write to the Times and suggest it.</p>

<p>Good idea!</p>

<p>I walked home through Greek Street, Soho, and imagined that a
hundred years had slipped back into place and De Quincey was still
there, haunting the night with invocations to his "just, subtle, and
mighty" drug. His vast dreams seemed to hover not very far away. Once
started in my brain, the pictures refused to go away; and I saw him
sleeping in that cold, tenantless mansion with the strange little waif
who was afraid of its ghosts, both together in the shadows under a
single horseman's cloak; or wandering in the companionship of the
spectral Anne; or, later still, on his way to the eternal rendezvous at
the foot of Great Titchfield Street, the rendezvous she never was able
to keep. What an unutterable gloom, what an untold horror of sorrow and
suffering comes over me as I try to realise something of what that
man--boy he then was--must have taken into his lonely heart.</p>

<p>As I came up the alley I saw a light in the top window, and a head
and shoulders thrown in an exaggerated shadow upon the blind. I
wondered what the son could be doing up there at such an hour.</p>

<p>Nov. 5.--This morning, while writing, someone came up the creaking
stairs and knocked cautiously at my door. Thinking it was the landlady,
I said, "Come in!" The knock was repeated, and I cried louder, "Come
in, come in!" But no one turned the handle, and I continued my writing
with a vexed "Well, stay out, then!" under my breath. Went on writing?
I tried to, but my thoughts had suddenly dried up at their source. I
could not set down a single word. It was a dark, yellow-fog morning,
and there was little enough inspiration in the air as it was, but that
stupid woman standing just outside my door waiting to be told again to
come in roused a spirit of vexation that filled my head to the
exclusion of all else. At last I jumped up and opened the door
myself.</p>

<p>"What do you want, and why in the world don't you come in?" I cried
out. But the words dropped into empty air. There was no one there. The
fog poured up the dingy staircase in deep yellow coils, but there was
no sign of a human being anywhere.</p>

<p>I slammed the door, with imprecations upon the house and its noises,
and went back to my work. A few minutes later Emily came in with a
letter.</p>

<p>"Were you or Mrs. Monson outside a few minutes ago knocking at my
door?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Monson's gone to market, and there's no one but me and the
child in the 'ole 'ouse, and I've been washing the dishes for the last
hour, sir."</p>

<p>I fancied the girl's face turned a shade paler. She fidgeted towards
the door with a glance over her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Wait, Emily," I said, and then told her what I had heard. She
stared stupidly at me, though her eyes shifted now and then over the
articles in the room.</p>

<p>"Who was it?" I asked when I had come to the end. "Mrs. Monson says
it's only mice," she said, as if repeating a learned lesson.</p>

<p>"Mice!" I exclaimed; "it's nothing of the sort. Someone was feeling
about outside my door. Who was it? Is the son in the house?"</p>

<p>Her whole manner changed suddenly, and she became earnest instead of
evasive. She seemed anxious to tell the truth.</p>

<p>"Oh no, sir; there's no one in the house at all but you and me and
the child, and there couldn't 'ave been nobody at your door. As for
them knocks--" She stopped abruptly, as though she had said too
much.</p>

<p>"Well, what about the knocks?" I said more gently.</p>

<p>"Of course," she stammered, "the knocks isn't mice, nor the
footsteps neither, but then--"</p>

<p>Again she came to a full halt.</p>

<p>"Anything wrong with the house?"</p>

<p>"Lor,' no, sir; the drains is splendid!"</p>

<p>"I don't mean drains, girl. I mean, did anything--anything bad ever
happen here?"</p>

<p>She flushed up to the roots of her hair, and then turned suddenly
pale again. She was obviously in considerable distress, and there was
something she was anxious, yet afraid to tell--some forbidden thing she
was not allowed to mention.</p>

<p>"I don't mind what it was, only I should like to know," I said
encouragingly.</p>

<p>Raising her frightened eyes to my face, she began to blurt out
something about "that which 'appened once to a gentleman that lived
hupstairs", when a shrill voice calling her name sounded below.</p>

<p>"Emily, Emily!" It was the returning landlady, and the girl tumbled
downstairs as if pulled backwards by a rope, leaving me full of
conjectures as to what in the world could have happened to a gentleman
upstairs that could in so curious a manner affect my ears
downstairs.</p>

<p>Nov. 10.--I have done capital work; have finished the ponderous
article and had it accepted for the Review, and another one ordered. I
feel well and cheerful, and have had regular exercise and good sleep;
no headaches, no nerves, no liver! Those pills the chemist recommended
are wonderful. I can watch the child playing with his cart and feel no
annoyance; sometimes I almost feel inclined to join him. Even the
grey-faced landlady rouses pity in me; I am sorry for her: so worn, so
weary, so oddly put together, just like the building. She looks as if
she had once suffered some shock of terror, and was momentarily
dreading another. When I spoke to her to-day very gently about not
putting the pens in the ash-tray and the gloves on the hook-shelf she
raised her faint eyes to mine for the first time, and said with the
ghost of a smile, "I'll try and re-member, sir." I felt inclined to pat
her on the back and say, "Come, cheer up and be jolly. Life's not so
bad after all." Oh! I am much better. There's nothing like open air and
success and good sleep. They build up as if by magic the portions of
the heart eaten down by despair and unsatisfied yearnings. Even to the
cats I feel friendly. When I came in at eleven o'clock to-night they
followed me to the door in a stream, and I stooped down to stroke the
one nearest to me.</p>

<p>Bah! The brute hissed and spat, and struck at me with her paws. The
claw caught my hand and drew blood in a thin line. The others danced
sideways into the darkness, screeching, as though I had done them an
injury. I believe these cats really hate me. Perhaps they are only
waiting to be reinforced. Then they will attack me. Ha, ha! In spite of
the momentary annoyance, this fancy sent me laughing upstairs to my
room.</p>

<p>The fire was out, and the room seemed unusually cold. As I groped my
way over to the mantelpiece to find the matches I realised all at once
that there was another person standing beside me in the darkness. I
could, of course, see nothing, but my fingers, feeling along the ledge,
came into forcible contact with something that was at once withdrawn.
It was cold and moist. I could have sworn it was somebody's hand. My
flesh began to creep instantly.</p>

<p>"Who's that?" I exclaimed in a loud voice.</p>

<p>My voice dropped into the silence like a pebble into a deep well.
There was no answer, but at the same moment I heard someone moving away
from me across the room in the direction of the door. It was a confused
sort of footstep, and the sound of garments brushing the furniture on
the way. The same second my hand stumbled upon the match-box, and I
struck a light. I expected to see Mrs. Monson, or Emily, or perhaps the
son who is something on an omnibus. But the flare of the gas-jet
illumined an empty room; there was not a sign of a person anywhere. I
felt the hair stir upon my head, and instinctively I backed tip against
the wall, lest something should approach me from behind. I was
distinctly alarmed. But the next minute I recovered myself. The door
was open on to the landing, and I crossed the room, not without some
inward trepidation, and went out. The light from the room fell upon the
stairs, but there was no one to be seen anywhere, nor was there any
sound on the creaking wooden staircase to indicate a departing
creature.</p>

<p>I was in the act of turning to go in again when a sound overhead
caught my ear. It was a very faint sound, not unlike the sigh of wind;
yet it could not have been the wind, for the night was still as the
grave. Though it was not repeated, I resolved to go upstairs and see
for myself what it all meant. Two senses had been affected--touch and
hearing--and I could not believe that I had been deceived. So, with a
lighted candle, I went stealthily forth on my unpleasant journey into
the upper regions of this queer little old house.</p>

<p>On the first landing there was only one door, and it was locked. On
the second there was also only one door, but when I turned the handle
it opened. There came forth to meet me the chill musty air that is
characteristic of a long unoccupied room. With it there came an
indescribable odour. I use the adjective advisedly. Though very faint,
diluted as it were, it was nevertheless an odour that made my gorge
rise. I had never smelt anything like it before, and I cannot describe
it.</p>

<p>The room was small and square, close under the roof, with a sloping
ceiling and two tiny windows. It was cold as the grave, without a shred
of carpet or a stick of furniture. The icy atmosphere and the nameless
odour combined to make the room abominable to me, and, after lingering
a moment to see that it contained no cupboards or corners into which a
person might have crept for concealment, I made haste to shut the door,
and went downstairs again to bed.</p>

<p>Evidently I had been deceived after all as to the noise.</p>

<p>In the night I had a foolish but very vivid dream. I dreamed that
the landlady and another person, dark and not properly visible, entered
my room on all fours, followed by a horde of immense cats. They
attacked me as I lay in bed, and murdered me, and then dragged my body
upstairs and deposited it on the floor of that cold little square room
under the roof.</p>

<p>Nov. 11.--Since my talk with Emily--the unfinished talk--I have
hardly once set eyes on her. Mrs. Monson now attends wholly to my
wants. As usual, she does everything exactly as I don't like it done.
It is all too utterly trivial to mention, but it is exceedingly
irritating. Like small doses of morphine often repeated, she has
finally a cumulative effect.</p>

<p>Nov. 12.--This morning I woke early, and came into the front room to
get a book, meaning to read in bed till it was time to get tip. Emily
was laying the fire.</p>

<p>"Good morning!" I said cheerfully. "Mind you make a good fire. It's
very cold."</p>

<p>The girl turned and showed me a startled face. It was not Emily at
all!</p>

<p>"Where's Emily?" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"You mean the girl as was 'ere before me?"</p>

<p>"Has Emily left?"</p>

<p>"I came on the 6th," she replied sullenly, "and she'd gone then." I
got my book and went back to bed. Emily must have been sent away almost
immediately after our conversation. This reflection kept coming between
me and the printed page. I was glad when it was time to get up.</p>

<p>Such prompt energy, such merciless decision, seemed to argue
something of importance--to somebody.</p>

<p>Nov. 13.--The wound inflicted by the cat's claw has swollen, and
causes me annoyance and some pain. It throbs and itches. I'm afraid my
blood must be in poor condition, or it would have healed by now. I
opened it with a penknife soaked in an antiseptic solution, and
cleansed it thoroughly. I have heard unpleasant stories of the results
of wounds inflicted by cats.</p>

<p>Nov. 14.--In spite of the curious effect this house certainly
exercises upon my nerves, I like it. It is lonely and deserted in the
very heart of London, but it is also for that reason quiet to work in.
I wonder why it is so cheap. Some people might he suspicious, but I did
not even ask the reason. No answer is better than a lie. If only I
could remove the cats from the outside and the rats from the inside. I
feel that I shall grow accustomed more and more to its peculiarities,
and shall die here. Ah, that expression reads queerly and gives a wrong
impression: I meant live and die here. I shall renew the lease from
year to year till one of us crumbles to pieces. From present
indications the building will be the first to go.</p>

<p>Nov. 16.--It is abominable the way my nerves go up and down with
me--and rather discouraging. This morning I woke to find my clothes
scattered about the room, and a cane chair overturned beside the bed.
My coat and waistcoat looked just as if they had been tried on by
someone in the night. I had horribly vivid dreams, too, in which
someone covering his face with his hands kept coming close up to me,
crying out as if in pain. "Where can I find covering? Oh, who will
clothe me?" How silly, and yet it frightened me a little. It was so
dreadfully real. It is now over a year since I last walked in my sleep
and woke up with such a shock on the cold pavement of Earl's Court
Road, where I then lived. I thought I was cured, but evidently not.
This discovery has rather a disquieting effect upon me. To-night I
shall resort to the old trick of tying my toe to the bed-post.</p>

<p>Nov. 17.--Last night I was again troubled by most oppressive dreams.
Someone seemed to be moving in the night up and down my room, sometimes
passing into the front room, and then returning to stand beside the bed
and stare intently down upon me. I was being watched by this person all
night long. I never actually awoke, though I was often very near it. I
suppose it was a nightmare from indigestion, for this morning I have
one of my old vile headaches. Yet all my clothes lay about the floor
when I awoke, where they had evidently been flung (had I so tossed
them?) during the dark hours, and my trousers trailed over the step
into the front room.</p>

<p>Worse than this, though--I fancied I noticed about the room in the
morning that strange, fetid odour. Though very faint, its mere
suggestion is foul and nauseating. 'What in the world can it be, I
wonder?...In future I shall lock my door.</p>

<p>Nov. 26.--I have accomplished a lot of good work during this past
week, and have also managed to get regular exercise. I have felt well
and in an equable state of mind. Only two things have occurred to
disturb my equanimity. The first is trivial in itself, and no doubt to
be easily explained. The upper window where I saw the light on the
night of November 4, with the shadow of a large head and shoulders upon
the blind, is one of the windows in the square room under the roof. In
reality it has no blind at all!</p>

<p>Here is the other thing. I was coming home last night in a fresh
fall of snow about eleven o'clock, my umbrella low down over my head.
Half-way up the alley, where the snow was wholly untrodden, I saw a
man's legs in front of me. The umbrella hid the rest of his figure, but
on raising it I saw that he was tall and broad and was walking, as I
was, towards the door of my house. He could not have been four feet
ahead of me. I had thought the alley was empty when I entered it, but
might of course have been mistaken very easily.</p>

<p>A sudden gust of wind compelled me to lower the umbrella, and when I
raised it again, not half a minute later, there was no longer any man
to be seen. With a few more steps I reached the door. It was closed as
usual. I then noticed with a sudden sensation of dismay that the
surface of the freshly fallen snow was unbroken. My own foot-marks were
the only ones to be seen anywhere, and though I retraced my way to tile
point where I had first seen the man, I could find no slightest
impression of any other boots. Feeling creepy and uncomfortable, I went
upstairs, and was glad to get into bed.</p>

<p>Nov. 28.--With the fastening of my bedroom door the disturbances
ceased. I am convinced that I walked in my sleep. Probably I untied my
toe and then tied it up again. The fancied security of the locked door
would alone have been enough to restore sleep to my troubled spirit and
enable me to rest quietly.</p>

<p>Last night, however, the annoyance was suddenly renewed another and
more aggressive form. I woke in the darkness with the impression that
someone was standing outside my bedroom door listening. As I became
more awake the impression grew into positive knowledge.</p>

<p>Though there was no appreciable sound of moving or breathing, I was
so convinced of the propinquity of a listener that I crept out of bed
and approached the door. As I did so there came faintly from the next
room the unmistakable sound of someone retreating stealthily across the
floor. Yet, as I heard it, it was neither the tread of a man nor a
regular footstep, but rather, it seemed to me, a confused sort of
crawling, almost as of someone on his hands and knees.</p>

<p>I unlocked the door in less than a second, and passed quickly into
the front room, and I could feel, as by the subtlest imaginable
vibrations upon my nerves, that the spot I was standing in had just
that instant been vacated! The Listener had moved; he was now behind
the other door, standing in the passage. Yet this door was also closed.
I moved swiftly, and as silently as possible, across the floor, and
turned the handle. A cold rush of air met me from the passage and sent
shiver after shiver down my back. There was no one in the doorway;
there was no one on the little landing; there was no one moving down
the staircase. Yet I had been so quick that this midnight Listener
could not be very far away, and I felt that if I persevered I should
eventually come face to face with him. And the courage that came so
opportunely to overcome my nervousness and horror seemed born of the
unwelcome conviction that it was somehow necessary for my safety as
well as my sanity that I should find this intruder and force his secret
from him. For was it not the intent action of his mind upon my own, in
concentrated listening, that had awakened me with such a vivid
realisation of his presence?</p>

<p>Advancing across the narrow landing, I peered down into the well of
the little house. There was nothing to be seen; no one was moving in
the darkness. How cold the oilcloth was to my bare feet.</p>

<p>I cannot say what it was that suddenly drew my eyes upwards. I only
know that, without apparent reason, I looked up and saw a person about
half-way up the next turn of the stairs, leaning forward over the
balustrade and staring straight into my face. It was a man. He appeared
to be clinging to the rail rather than standing on the stairs. The
gloom made it impossible to see much beyond the general outline, but
the head and shoulders were seemingly enormous, and stood sharply
silhouetted against the skylight in the roof immediately above. The
idea flashed into my brain in a moment that I was looking into the
visage of something monstrous. The huge skull, the mane-like hair, the
wide-humped shoulders, suggested, in a way I did not pause to analyse,
that which was scarcely human; and for some seconds, fascinated by
horror, I returned the gaze and stared into the dark, inscrutable
countenance above me, without knowing exactly where I was or what I was
doing.</p>

<p>Then I realised in quite a new way that I was face to face with the
secret midnight Listener, and I steeled myself as best I could for what
was about to come.</p>

<p>The source of the rash courage that came to me at this awful moment
will ever be to me an inexplicable mystery. Though shivering with fear,
and my forehead wet with an unholy dew, I resolved to advance. Twenty
questions leaped to my lips: What are you? What do you want?</p>

<p>Why do you listen and watch? Why do you come into my room? But none
of them found articulate utterance.</p>

<p>I began forthwith to climb the stairs, and with the first signs of
my advance he drew himself back into the shadows and began to move. He
retreated as swiftly as I advanced. I heard the sound of his crawling
motion a few steps ahead of me, ever maintaining the same distance.
When I reached the landing he was half-way up the next flight, and when
I was half-way up the next flight he had already arrived at the top
landing. I then heard him open the door of the little square room under
the roof and go in. Immediately, though the door did not close after
him, the sound of his moving entirely ceased.</p>

<p>At this moment I longed for a light, or a stick, or any weapon
whatsoever; but I had none of these things, and it was impossible to go
back. So I marched steadily up the rest of the stairs, and in less than
a minute found myself standing in the gloom face to face with the door
through which this creature had just entered.</p>

<p>For a moment I hesitated. The door was about half-way open, and the
Listener was standing evidently in his favourite attitude just behind
it--listening. To search through that dark room for him seemed
hopeless; to enter the same small space where he was seemed horrible.
The very idea filled me with loathing, and I almost decided to turn
back.</p>

<p>It is strange at such times how trivial things impinge on the
consciousness with a shock as of something important and immense.
Something--it may have been a beetle or a mouse--scuttled over the bare
boards behind me. The door moved a quarter of an inch, closing. My
decision came back with a sudden rush, as it were, and thrusting out a
foot, I kicked the door so that it swung sharply back to its full
extent, and permitted me to walk forward slowly into the aperture of
profound blackness beyond. What a queer soft sound my bare feet made on
the boards! how the blood sang and buzzed in my head!</p>

<p>I was inside. The darkness closed over me, hiding even the windows.
I began to grope my way round the walls in a thorough search; but in
order to prevent all possibility of the other's escape, I first of all
closed the door.</p>

<p>There we were, we two, shut in together between four walls, within a
few feet of one another.</p>

<p>But with what, with whom, was I thus momentarily imprisoned? A new
light flashed suddenly over the affair with a swift, illuminating
brilliance--and I knew I was a fool, an utter fool! I was wide awake at
last, and the horror was evaporating. My cursed nerves again; a dream,
a nightmare, and the old result--walking in my sleep. The figure was a
dream-figure. Many a time before had the actors in my dreams stood
before me for some moments after I was awake...</p>

<p>There was a chance match in my pyjamas' pocket, and I struck it on
the wall. The room was utterly empty. It held not even a shadow. I went
quickly down to bed, cursing my wretched nerves and my foolish, vivid
dreams. But as soon as ever I was asleep again, the same uncouth figure
of a man crept back to my bedside, and bending over me with his immense
head close to my ear, whispered repeatedly in my dreams, "I want your
body; I want its covering. I'm waiting for it, and listening always."
Words scarcely less foolish than the dream.</p>

<p>But I wonder what that queer odour was up in the square room. I
noticed it again, and stronger than ever before, and it seemed to be
also in my bedroom when I woke this morning.</p>

<p>Nov. 29.--Slowly, as moonbeams rise over a misty sea in June, the
thought is entering my mind that my nerves and somnambulistic dreams do
not adequately account for the influence this house exercises upon me.
It holds me as with a fine, invisible net. I cannot escape if I would.
It draws me, and it means to keep me.</p>

<p>Nov. 30.--The post this morning brought me a letter from Aden,
forwarded from my old rooms in Earl's Court. It was from Chapter, my
former Trinity chum, who is on his way home from the East, and asks for
my address. I sent it to him at the hotel he mentioned, "to await
arrival".</p>

<p>As I have already said, my windows command a view of the alley, and
I can see an arrival without difficulty. This morning, while I was busy
writing, the sound of footsteps coming up the alley filled me with a
sense of vague alarm that I could in no way account for. I went over to
the window, and saw a man standing below waiting for the door to be
opened. His shoulders were broad, his top-hat glossy, and his overcoat
fitted beautifully round the collar. All this I could see, but no more.
Presently the door was opened, and the shock to my nerves was
unmistakable when I heard a man's voice ask, "Is Mr.--still here?"
mentioning my name. I could not catch the answer, but it could only
have been in the affirmative, for the man entered the hall and the door
shut to behind him. But I waited in vain for the sound of his steps on
the stairs. There was no sound of any kind. It seemed to me so strange
that I opened my door and looked out. No one was anywhere to be seen. I
walked across the narrow landing, and looked through the window that
commands the whole length of the alley. There was no sign of a human
being, coming or going.</p>

<p>The lane was deserted. Then I deliberately walked downstairs into
the kitchen, and asked the grey-faced landlady if a gentleman had just
that minute called for me.</p>

<p>The answer, given with an odd, weary sort of smile, was "No!"</p>

<p>Dec. 1.--I feel genuinely alarmed and uneasy over the state of my
nerves. Dreams are dreams, but never before have I had dreams in broad
daylight.</p>

<p>I am looking forward very much to Chapter's arrival. He is a capital
fellow, vigorous, healthy, with no nerves, and even less imagination;
and he has &pound;2,000 a year into the bargain.</p>

<p>Periodically he makes me offers--the last was to travel round the
world with him as secretary, which was a delicate way of paying my
expenses and giving me some pocket-money--offers, however, which I
invariably decline. I prefer to keep his friendship. Women could not
come between us; money might--therefore I give it no opportunity.
Chapter always laughed at what he called my "fancies", being himself
possessed only of that thin-blooded quality of imagination which is
ever associated with the prosaic-minded man. Yet, if taunted with this
obvious lack, his wrath is deeply stirred. His psychology is that of
the crass materialist--always a rather funny article. It will afford me
genuine relief, none the less, to hear the cold judgment his mind will
have to pass upon the story of this house as I shall have it to
tell.</p>

<p>Dec. 2.--The strangest part of it all I have not referred to in this
brief diary. Truth to tell, I have been afraid to set it down in black
and white. I have kept it in the background of my thoughts, preventing
it as far as possible from taking shape. In spite of my efforts,
however, it has continued to grow stronger.</p>

<p>Now that I come to face the issue squarely it is harder to express
than I imagined. Like a half-remembered melody that trips in the head
but vanishes the moment you try to sing it, these thoughts form a group
in the background of my mind, behind my mind, as it were, and refuse to
come forward. They are crouching ready to spring, but the actual leap
never takes place.</p>

<p>In these rooms, except when my mind is strongly concentrated on my
own work, I find myself suddenly dealing in thoughts and ideas that are
not my own! New, strange conceptions, wholly foreign to my temperament,
are for ever cropping up in my head. What precisely they are is of no
particular importance. The point is that they are entirely apart from
the channel in which my thoughts have hitherto been accustomed to flow.
Especially they come when my mind is at rest, unoccupied; when I'm
dreaming over the fire, or sitting with a book which fails to hold my
attention. Then these thoughts which are not mine spring into life and
make me feel exceedingly uncomfortable. Sometimes they are so strong
that I almost feel as if someone were in the room beside me, thinking
aloud.</p>

<p>Evidently my nerves and liver are shockingly out of order. I must
work harder and take more vigorous exercise. The horrid thoughts never
come when my mind is much occupied. But they are always there--waiting
and as it were alive.</p>

<p>What I have attempted to describe above came first upon me gradually
after I had been some days in the house, and then grew steadily in
strength. The other strange thing has come to me only twice in all
these weeks. It appals me. It is the consciousness of the propinquity
of some deadly and loathsome disease. It comes over me like a wave of
fever heat, and then passes off, leaving me cold and trembling. The air
seems for a few seconds to become tainted. So penetrating and
convincing is the thought of this sickness, that on both occasions my
brain has turned momentarily dizzy, and through my mind, like flames of
white heat, have flashed the ominous names of all the dangerous
illnesses I know. I can no more explain these visitations than I can
fly, yet I know there is no dreaming about the clammy skin and
palpitating heart which they always leave as witnesses of their brief
visit.</p>

<p>Most strongly of all was I aware of this nearness of a mortal
sickness when, on the night of the 28th, I went upstairs in pursuit of
the listening figure. When we were shut in together in that little
square room under the roof, I felt that I was face to face with the
actual essence of this invisible and malignant disease. Such a feeling
never entered my heart before, and I pray to God it never may
again.</p>

<p>There! Now I have confessed. I have given some expression at least
to the feelings that so far I have been afraid to see in my own
writing. For--since I can no longer deceive myself--the experiences of
that night (28th) were no more a dream than my daily breakfast is a
dream; and the trivial entry in this diary by which I sought to explain
away an occurrence that caused me unutterable horror was due solely to
my desire not to acknowledge in words what I really felt and believed
to be true. The increase that would have accrued to my horror by so
doing might have been more than I could stand.</p>

<p>Dec. 3.--I wish Chapter would come. My facts are all ready
marshalled, and I can see his cool, grey eyes fixed incredulously on my
face as I relate them: the knocking at my door, the well-dressed
caller, the light in the upper window and the shadow upon the blind,
the man who preceded me in the snow, the scattering of my clothes at
night, Emily's arrested confession, the landlady's suspicious
reticence, the midnight listener on the stairs, and those awful
subsequent words in my sleep; and above all, and hardest to tell, the
presence of the abominable sickness, and the stream of thoughts and
ideas that are not my own.</p>

<p>I can see Chapter's face, and I can almost hear his deliberate
words, "You've been at the tea again, and underfeeding, I expect, as
usual. Better see my nerve doctor, and then come with me to the south
of France." For this fellow, who knows nothing of disordered liver or
high-strung nerves, goes regularly to a great nerve specialist with the
periodical belief that his nervous system is beginning to decay.</p>

<p>Dec. 5.--Ever since the incident of the Listener, I have kept a
night-light burning in my bedroom, and my sleep has been undisturbed.
Last night, however, I was subjected to a far worse annoyance. I woke
suddenly, and saw a man in front of the dressing-table regarding
himself in the mirror. The door was locked, as usual. I knew at once it
was the Listener, and the blood turned to ice in my veins. Such a wave
of horror and dread swept over me that it seemed to turn me rigid in
the bed, and I could neither move nor speak. I noted, however, that the
odour I so abhorred was strong in the room.</p>

<p>The man seemed to be tall and broad. He was stooping forward over
the mirror. His back was turned to me, but in the glass I saw the
reflection of a huge head and face illumined fitfully by the flicker of
the night-light. The spectral grey of very early morning stealing in
round the edges of the curtains lent an additional horror to the
picture, for it fell upon hair that was tawny and mane-like, hanging
loosely about a face whose swollen, rugose features bore the once seen
never forgotten leonine expression of--I dare not write down that awful
word. But, byway of corroborative proof, I saw in the faint mingling of
the two lights that there were several bronze-coloured blotches on the
cheeks which the man was evidently examining with great care in the
glass. The lips were pale and very thick and large. One hand I could
not see, but the other rested on the ivory back of my hair-brush. Its
muscles were strangely contracted, the fingers thin to emaciation, the
back of the hand closely puckered up. It was like a big grey spider
crouching to spring, or the claw of a great bird.</p>

<p>The full realisation that I was alone in the room with this nameless
creature, almost within arm's reach of him, overcame me to such a
degree that, when he suddenly turned and regarded me with small beady
eyes, wholly out of proportion to the grandeur of their massive
setting, I sat bolt upright in bed, uttered a loud cry, and then fell
back in a dead swoon of terror upon the bed.</p>

<p>Dec. 5.--...When I came to this morning, the first thing I noticed
was that my clothes were strewn all over the floor...I find it
difficult to put my thoughts together, and have sudden accesses of
violent trembling. I determined that I would go at once to Chapter's
hotel and find out when he is expected. I cannot refer to what happened
in the night; it is too awful, and I have to keep my thoughts
rigorously away from it. I feel light-headed and queer, couldn't eat
any breakfast, and have twice vomited with blood. While dressing to go
out, a hansom rattled up noisily over the cobbles, and a minute later
the door opened, and to my great joy in walked the very subject of my
thoughts.</p>

<p>The sight of his strong face and quiet eyes had an immediate effect
upon me, and I grew calmer again. His very handshake was a sort of
tonic. But, as I listened eagerly to the deep tones of his reassuring
voice, and the visions of the night-time paled a little, I began to
realise how very hard it was going to be to tell him my wild intangible
tale. Some men radiate an animal vigour that destroys the delicate woof
of a vision and effectually prevents its reconstruction.</p>

<p>Chapter was one of these men.</p>

<p>We talked of incidents that had filled the interval since we last
met, and he told me something of his travels. He talked and I listened.
But, so full was I of the horrid thing I had to tell, that I made a
poor listener. I was for ever watching my opportunity to leap in and
explode it all under his nose.</p>

<p>Before very long, however, it was borne in upon me that he too was
merely talking for time.</p>

<p>He too held something of importance in the background of his mind,
something too weighty to let fall till the right moment presented
itself. So that during the whole of the first half-hour we were both
waiting for the psychological moment in which properly to release our
respective bombs; and the intensity of our minds' action set up
opposing forces that merely sufficed to hold one another in check--and
nothing more. As soon as I realised this, therefore, I resolved to
yield.</p>

<p>I renounced for the time my purpose of telling my story, and had the
satisfaction of seeing that his mind, released from the restraint of my
own, at once began to make preparations for the discharge of its
momentous burden. The talk grew less and less magnetic; the interest
waned; the descriptions of his travels became less alive. There were
pauses between his sentences. Presently he repeated himself. His words
clothed no living thoughts. The pauses grew longer. Then the interest
dwindled altogether and went out like a candle in the wind. His voice
ceased, and he looked up squarely into my face with serious and anxious
eyes.</p>

<p>The psychological moment had come at last!</p>

<p>"I say--" he began, and then stopped short.</p>

<p>I made an unconscious gesture of encouragement, but said no word. I
dreaded the impending disclosure exceedingly. A dark shadow seemed to
precede it.</p>

<p>"I say," he blurted out at last, "what in the world made you ever
come to this place--to these rooms, I mean?"</p>

<p>"They're cheap, for one thing," I began, "and central and--"</p>

<p>"They're too cheap," he interrupted. "Didn't you ask what made 'em
so cheap?"</p>

<p>"It never occurred to me at the time."</p>

<p>There was a pause in which he avoided my eyes.</p>

<p>"For God's sake, go on, man, and tell it!" I cried, for the suspense
was getting more than I could stand in my nervous condition.</p>

<p>"This was where Blount lived so long," he said quietly, "and where
he--died. You know, in the old days I often used to come here and see
him, and do what I could to alleviate his--" He stuck fast again.</p>

<p>"Well!" I said with a great effort. "Please go on--faster."</p>

<p>"But," Chapter went on, turning his face to the window with a
perceptible shiver, "he finally got so terrible I simply couldn't stand
it, though I always thought I could stand anything. It got on my nerves
and made me dream, and haunted me day and night."</p>

<p>I stared at him, and said nothing. I had never heard of Blount in my
life, and didn't know what he was talking about. But, all the same, I
was trembling, and my mouth had become strangely dry.</p>

<p>"This is the first time I've been back here since," he said almost
in a whisper, "and, 'pon my word, it gives me the creeps. I swear it
isn't fit for a man to live in. I never saw you look so bad, old
man."</p>

<p>"I've got it for a year," I jerked out, with a forced laugh; "signed
the lease and all. I thought it was rather a bargain."</p>

<p>Chapter shuddered, and buttoned his overcoat up to his neck. Then he
spoke in a low voice, looking occasionally behind him as though he
thought someone was listening. I too could have sworn someone else was
in the room with us.</p>

<p>"He did it himself, you know, and no one blamed him a bit; his
sufferings were awful. For the last two years he used to wear a veil
when he went out, and even then it was always in a closed carriage.
Even the attendant who had nursed him for so long was at length obliged
to leave. The extremities of both the lower limbs were gone, dropped
off, and he moved about the ground on all fours with a sort of crawling
motion. The odour, too, was--"</p>

<p>I was obliged to interrupt him here. I could hear no more details of
that sort. My skin was moist, I felt hot and cold by turns, for at last
I was beginning to understand.</p>

<p>"Poor devil," Chapter went on; "I used to keep my eyes closed as
much as possible. He always begged to be allowed to take his veil off,
and asked if I minded very much. I used to stand by the open window. He
never touched me, though. He rented the whole house. Nothing would
induce him to leave it."</p>

<p>"Did he occupy--these very rooms?"</p>

<p>"No. He had the little room on the top floor, the square one just
under the roof. He preferred it because it was dark. These rooms were
too near the ground, and he was afraid people might see him through the
windows. A crowd had been known to follow him up to the very door, and
then stand below the windows in the hope of catching a glimpse of his
face."</p>

<p>"But there were hospitals."</p>

<p>"He wouldn't go near one, and they didn't like to force him. You
know, they say it's not contagious, so there was nothing to prevent his
staying here if he wanted to. He spent all his time reading medical
books, about drugs and so on. His head and face were something
appalling, just like a lion's."</p>

<p>I held up my hand to arrest further description.</p>

<p>"He was a burden to the world, and he knew it. One night I suppose
he realised it too keenly to wish to live. He had the free use of
drugs--and in the morning he was found dead on the floor. Two years
ago, that was, and they said then he had still several years to
live."</p>

<p>"Then, in Heaven's name!" I cried, unable to bear the suspense any
longer, "tell me what it was he had, and be quick about it."</p>

<p>"I thought you knew!" he exclaimed, with genuine surprise. "I
thought you knew!"</p>

<p>He leaned forward and our eyes met. In a scarcely audible whisper I
caught the words his lips seemed almost afraid to utter:</p>

<p>"He was a leper!"</p>

<h2><a name="ch11"></a>Max Hensig</h2>

<p>Besides the departmental men on the New York Vulture, there were
about twenty reporters for general duty, and Williams had worked his
way up till he stood easily among the first half-dozen; for, in
addition to being accurate and painstaking, he was able to bring to his
reports of common things that touch of imagination and humour which
just lifted them out of the rut of mere faithful recording. Moreover,
the city editor (anglice news editor) appreciated his powers, and
always tried to give him assignments that did himself and the paper
credit, and he was justified now in expecting to be relieved of the
hack jobs that were usually allotted to new men.</p>

<p>He was therefore puzzled and a little disappointed one morning as he
saw his inferiors summoned one after another to the news desk to
receive the best assignments of the day, and when at length his turn
came, and the city editor asked him to cover "the Hensig story" he gave
a little start of vexation that almost betrayed him into asking what
the devil "the Hensig story" was. For it is the duty of every morning
newspaper man--in New York at least--to have made himself familiar with
all the news of the day before he shows himself at the office, and
though Williams had already done this, he could not recall either the
name or the story.</p>

<p>"You can run to a hundred or a hundred and fifty, Mr. Williams.
Cover the trial thoroughly, and get good interviews with Hensig and the
lawyers. There'll be no night assignment for you till the case is
over."</p>

<p>Williams was going to ask if there were any private "tips" from the
District Attorney's office, but the editor was already speaking with
Weekes, who wrote the daily "weather story", and he went back slowly to
his desk, angry and disappointed, to read up the Hensig case and lay
his plans for the day accordingly. At any rate, he reflected, it looked
like "a soft job", and as there was to be no second assignment for him
that night, he would get off by eight o'clock, and be able to dine and
sleep for once like a civilised man. And that was something.</p>

<p>It took him some time, however, to discover that the Hensig case was
only a murder story.</p>

<p>And this increased his disgust. It was tucked away in the corners of
most of the papers, and little importance was attached to it. A murder
trial is not first-class news unless there are very special features
connected with it, and Williams had already covered scores of them.
There was a heavy sameness about them that made it difficult to report
them interestingly, and as a rule they were left to the tender mercies
of the "flimsy" men--the Press Associations--and no paper sent a
special man unless the case was distinctly out of the usual. Moreover,
a hundred and fifty meant a column and a half, and Williams, not being
a space man, earned the same money whether he wrote a stickful or a
page; so that he felt doubly aggrieved, and walked out into the sunny
open spaces opposite Newspaper Row heaving a deep sigh and cursing the
boredom of his trade.</p>

<p>Max Hensig, he found, was a German doctor accused of murdering his
second wife by injecting arsenic. The woman had been buried several
weeks when the suspicious relatives got the body exhumed, and a
quantity of the poison had been found in her. Williams recalled
something about the arrest, now he came to think of it; but he felt no
special interest in it, for ordinary murder trials were no longer his
legitimate work, and he scorned them. At first, of course, they had
thrilled him horribly, and some of his interviews with the prisoners,
especially just before execution, had deeply impressed his imagination
and kept him awake o' nights. Even now he could not enter the gloomy
Tombs Prison, or cross the Bridge of Sighs leading from it to the
courts, without experiencing a real sensation, for its huge Egyptian
columns and massive walls closed round him like death; and the first
time he walked down Murderers' Row, and came in view of the cell doors,
his throat was dry, and he had almost turned and run out of the
building.</p>

<p>The first time, too, that he covered the trial of a Negro and
listened to the man's hysterical speech before sentence was pronounced,
he was absorbed with interest, and his heart leaped. The wild appeals
to the Deity, the long invented words, the ghastly pallor under the
black skin, the rolling eyes, and the torrential sentences all seemed
to him to be something tremendous to describe for his sensational
sheet; and the stickful that was eventually printed--written by the
flimsy man too--had given him quite a new standard of the relative
value of news and of the quality of the satiated public palate. He had
reported the trials of a Chinaman, stolid as wood; of an Italian who
had been too quick with his knife; and of a farm girl who had done both
her parents to death in their beds, entering their room stark naked, so
that no stains should betray her; and at the beginning these things
haunted him for days.</p>

<p>But that was all months ago, when he first came to New York. Since
then his work had been steadily in the criminal courts, and he had
grown a second skin. An execution in the electric chair at Sing Sing
could still unnerve him somewhat, but mere murder no longer thrilled or
excited him, and he could be thoroughly depended on to write a good
"murder story"--an account that his paper could print without blue
pencil.</p>

<p>Accordingly he entered the Tombs Prison with nothing stronger than
the feeling of vague oppression that gloomy structure always stirred in
him, and certainly with no particular emotion connected with the
prisoner he was about to interview; and when he reached the second iron
door, where a warder peered at him through a small grating, he heard a
voice behind him, and turned to find the Chronicle man at his
heels.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Senator! What good trail are you following down here?" he
cried, for the other got no small assignments, and never had less than
a column on the Chronicle front page at space rates.</p>

<p>"Same as you, I guess--Hensig," was the reply.</p>

<p>"But there's no space in Hensig," said Williams with surprise. "Are
you back on salary again?"</p>

<p>"Not much," laughed the Senator--no one knew his real name, but he
was always called Senator. "But Hensig's good for two hundred easy.
There's a whole list of murders behind him, we hear, and this is the
first time he's been caught."</p>

<p>"Poison?"</p>

<p>The Senator nodded in reply, turning to ask the warder some question
about another case, and Williams waited for him in the corridor,
impatiently rather, for he loathed the musty prison odour. He watched
the Senator as he talked, and was distinctly glad he had come. They
were good friends: he had helped Williams when he first joined the
small army of newspaper men and was not much welcomed, being an
Englishman. Common origin and goodheartedness mixed themselves
delightfully in his face, and he always made Williams think of a
friendly, honest cart-horse--stolid, strong, with big and simple
emotions.</p>

<p>"Get a hustle on, Senator," he said at length impatiently. The two
reporters followed the warder down the flagged corridor, past a row of
dark cells, each with its occupant, until the man, swinging his keys in
the direction indicated, stopped and pointed:</p>

<p>"Here's your gentleman," he said, and then moved on down the
corridor, leaving them staring through the bars at a tail, slim young
man, pacing to and fro. He had flaxen hair and very bright blue eyes;
his skin was white, and his face wore so open and innocent an
expression that one would have said he could not twist a kitten's tail
without wincing.</p>

<p>"From the Chronicle and Vulture," explained Williams, by way of
introduction, and the talk at once began in the usual way.</p>

<p>The man in the cell ceased his restless pacing up and down, and
stopped opposite the bars to examine them. He stared straight into
Williams's eyes for a moment, and the reporter noted a very different
expression from the one he had first seen. It actually made him shift
his position and stand a little to one side. But the movement was
wholly instinctive. He could not have explained why he did it.</p>

<p>"Guess you vish me to say I did it, and then egsplain to you how I
did it," the young doctor said coolly, with a marked German accent.
"But I haf no copy to gif you shust now. You see at the trial it is
nothing but spite--and shealosy of another woman. I lofed my vife. I
vould not haf gilled her for anything in the vorld--"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, of course, Dr. Hensig," broke in the Senator, who
was more experienced in the ways of difficult interviewing. "We quite
understand that. But, you know, in New York the newspapers try a man as
much as the courts, and we thought you might like to make a statement
to the public which we should be very glad to print for you. It may
help your case--"</p>

<p>"Nothing can help my case in this tamned country where shustice is
to be pought mit tollars!" cried the prisoner, with a sudden anger and
an expression of face still further belying the first one; "nothing
except a lot of money. But I tell you now two things you may write for
your public: One is, no motive can be shown for the murder, because I
lofed Zinka and vished her to live alvays. And the other is--" He
stopped a moment and stared steadily at Williams making shorthand
notes--"that with my knowledge--my egceptional knowledge--of poisons
and pacteriology I could have done it in a dozen ways without pumping
arsenic into her body. That is a fool's way of killing. It is clumsy
and childish and sure of discofery! See?"</p>

<p>He turned away, as though to signify that the interview was over,
and sat down on his wooden bench.</p>

<p>"Seems to have taken a fancy to you," laughed the Senator, as they
went off to get further interviews with the lawyers. "He never looked
at me once."</p>

<p>"He's got a bad face--the face of a devil. I don't feel
complimented," said Williams shortly.</p>

<p>"I'd hate to be in his power."</p>

<p>"Same here," returned the other. "Let's go into Silver Dollars and
wash the dirty taste out."</p>

<p>So, after the custom of reporters, they made their way up the Bowery
and went into a saloon that had gained a certain degree of fame because
the Tammany owner had let a silver dollar into each stone of the floor.
Here they washed away most of the "dirty taste" left by the Tombs
atmosphere and Hensig, and then went on to Steve Brodie's, another
saloon a little higher up the same street.</p>

<p>"There'll be others there," said the Senator, meaning drinks as well
as reporters, and Williams, still thinking over their interview,
silently agreed.</p>

<p>Brodie was a character; there was always something lively going on
in his place. He had the reputation of having once jumped from the
Brooklyn Bridge and reached the water alive. No one could actually deny
it, and no one could prove that it really happened: and anyhow, he had
enough imagination and personality to make the myth live and to sell
much bad liquor on the strength of it. The walls of his saloon were
plastered with lurid oil-paintings of the bridge, the height enormously
magnified, and Steve's body in midair, an expression of a happy puppy
on his face.</p>

<p>Here, as expected, they found "Whitey" Fife, of the Recorder, and
Galusha Owen, of the World. "Whitey", as his nickname implied, was an
albino, and clever. He wrote the daily "weather story" for his paper,
and the way he spun a column out of rain, wind, and temperature was the
envy of everyone except the Weather Clerk, who objected to being
described as "Farmer Dunne, cleaning his rat-tail file", and to having
his dignified office referred to in the public press as "a down-country
farm". But the public liked it, and laughed, and "Whitey" was never
really spiteful.</p>

<p>Owen, too, when sober, was a good man who had long passed the
rubicon of hack assignments. Yet both these men were also on the Hensig
story. And Williams, who had already taken an instinctive dislike to
the case, was sorry to see this, for it meant frequent interviewing and
the possession, more or less, of his mind and imagination. Clearly, he
would have much to do with this German doctor. Already, even at this
stage, he began to hate him.</p>

<p>The four reporters spent an hour drinking and talking. They fell at
length to discussing the last time they had chanced to meet on the same
assignment--a private lunatic asylum owned by an incompetent quack
without a licence, and where most of the inmates, not mad in the first
instance, and all heavily paid for by relatives who wished them out of
the way, had gone mad from ill-treatment. The place had been surrounded
before dawn by the Board of Health officers, and the quasi-doctor
arrested as he opened his front door. It was a splendid newspaper
"story", of course.</p>

<p>"My space bill ran to sixty dollars a day for nearly a week," said
Whitey Fife thickly, and the others laughed, because Whitey wrote most
of his stuff by cribbing it from the evening papers.</p>

<p>"A dead cinch," said Galusha Owen, his dirty flannel collar poking
up through his long hair almost to his ears. "I 'faked' the whole of
the second day without going down there at all."</p>

<p>He pledged Whitey for the tenth time that morning, and the albino
leered happily across the table at him, and passed him a thick
compliment before emptying his glass.</p>

<p>"Hensig's going to be good, too," broke in the Senator, ordering a
round of gin-fizzes, and Williams gave a little start of annoyance to
hear the name brought up again. "He'll make good stuff at the trial. I
never saw a cooler hand. You should've heard him talk about poisons and
bacteriology, and boasting he could kill in a dozen ways without fear
of being caught. I guess he was telling the truth right enough!"</p>

<p>"That so?" cried Galusha and Whitey in the same breath, not having
done a stroke of work so far on the case.</p>

<p>"Run down to the Tombsh and get an interview," added Whitey, turning
with a sudden burst of enthusiasm to his companion. His white eyebrows
and pink eyes fairly shone against the purple of his tipsy face.</p>

<p>"No, no," cried the Senator; "don't spoil a good story. You're both
as full as ticks. I'll match with Williams which of us goes. Hensig
knows us already, and we'll all 'give up' in this story right along. No
'beats.'"</p>

<p>So they decided to divide news till the case was finished, and to
keep no exclusive items to themselves; and Williams, having lost the
toss, swallowed his gin-fizz and went back to the Tombs to get a
further talk with the prisoner on his knowledge of expert poisoning and
bacteriology.</p>

<p>Meanwhile his thoughts were very busy elsewhere. He had taken no
part in the noisy conversation in the barroom, because something lay at
the back of his mind, bothering him, and claiming attention with great
persistence. Something was at work in his deeper consciousness,
something that had impressed him with a vague sense of unpleasantness
and nascent fear, reaching below that second skin he had grown...And,
as he walked slowly through the malodorous slum streets that lay
between the Bowery and the Tombs, dodging the pullers-in outside the
Jew clothing stores, and nibbling at a bag of peanuts he caught up off
an Italian push-cart en route, this "something" rose a little higher
out of its obscurity, and began to play with the roots of the ideas
floating higgledy-piggledy on the surface of his mind. He thought he
knew what it was, but could not make quite sure. From the roots of his
thoughts it rose a little higher, so that he clearly felt it as
something disagreeable.</p>

<p>Then, with a sudden rush, it came to the surface, and poked its face
before him so that he fully recognised it.</p>

<p>The blond visage of Dr. Max Hensig rose before him, cool, smiling,
and implacable.</p>

<p>Somehow, he had expected it would prove to be Hensig--this
unpleasant thought that was troubling him. He was not really surprised
to have labelled it, because the man's personality had made an
unwelcome impression upon him at the very start. He stopped nervously
in the Street, and looked round. He did not expect to see anything out
of the way, or to find that he was being followed. It was not that
exactly. The act of turning was merely the outward expression of a
sudden inner discomfort, and a man with better nerves, or nerves more
under control, would not have turned at all.</p>

<p>But what caused this tremor of the nerves? Williams probed and
searched within himself. It came, he felt, from some part of his inner
being he did not understand; there had been an intrusion, an
incongruous intrusion, into the stream of his normal consciousness.
Messages from this region always gave him pause; and in this particular
case he saw no reason why he should think specially of Dr. Hensig with
alarm--this light-haired stripling with blue eyes and drooping
moustache. The faces of other murderers had haunted him once or twice
because they were more than ordinarily bad, or because their case
possessed unusual features of horror. But there was nothing so very
much out of the way about Hensig--at least, if there was, the reporter
could not seize and analyse it. There seemed no adequate reason to
explain his emotion. Certainly, it had nothing to do with the fact that
he was merely a murderer, for that stirred no thrill in him at all,
except a kind of pity, and a wonder how the man would meet his
execution. It must, he argued, be something to do with the personality
of the man, apart from any particular deed or characteristic.</p>

<p>Puzzled, and still a little nervous, he stood in the road,
hesitating. In front of him the dark walls of the Tombs rose in massive
steps of granite. Overhead white summer clouds sailed across a deep
blue sky; the wind sang cheerfully among the wires and chimney-pots,
making him think of fields and trees; and down the Street surged the
usual cosmopolitan New York crowd of laughing Italians, surly Negroes,
hebrews chattering Yiddish, tough-looking hooligans with that fighting
lurch of the shoulders peculiar to New York roughs, Chinamen, taking
little steps like boys--and every other sort of nondescript imaginable.
It was early June, and there were faint odours of the sea and of
sea-beaches in the air. Williams caught himself shivering a little with
delight at the sight of the sky and scent of the wind.</p>

<p>Then he looked back at the great prison, rightly named the Tombs,
and the sudden change of thought from the fields to the cells, from
life to death, somehow landed him straight into the discovery of what
caused this attack of nervousness:</p>

<p>Hensig was no ordinary murderer! That was it. There was something
quite out of the ordinary about him. The man was a horror, pure and
simple, standing apart from normal humanity. The knowledge of this
rushed over him like a revelation, bringing unalterable conviction in
its train.</p>

<p>Something of it had reached him in that first brief interview, but
without explaining itself sufficiently to be recognised, and since then
it had been working in his system, like a poison, and was now causing a
disturbance, not having been assimilated. A quicker temperament would
have labelled it long before.</p>

<p>Now, Williams knew well that he drank too much, and had more than a
passing acquaintance with drugs; his nerves were shaky at the best of
times. His life on the newspapers afforded no opportunity of
cultivating pleasant social relations, but brought him all the time
into contact with the seamy side of life--the criminal, the abnormal,
the unwholesome in human nature. He knew, too, that strange thoughts,
id&eacute;es fixes and what not, grew readily in such a soil as this,
and, not wanting these, he had formed a habit--peculiar to himself--of
deliberately sweeping his mind clean once a week of all that had
haunted, obsessed, or teased him, of the horrible or unclean, during
his work; and his eighth day, his holiday, he invariably spent in the
woods, walking, building fires, cooking a meal in the open, and getting
all the country air and the exercise he possibly could. He had in this
way kept his mind free from many unpleasant pictures that might
otherwise have lodged there abidingly, and the habit of thus cleansing
his imagination had proved more than once of real value to him.</p>

<p>So now he laughed to himself, and turned on those whizzing brooms of
his, trying to forget these first impressions of Hensig, and simply
going in, as he did a hundred other times, to get an ordinary interview
with an ordinary prisoner. This habit, being nothing more nor less than
the practice of suggestion, was more successful sometimes than others.
This time--since fear is less susceptible to suggestion than other
emotions--it was less so.</p>

<p>Williams got his interview, and came away fairly creeping with
horror. Hensig was all that he had felt, and more besides. He belonged,
the reporter felt convinced, to that rare type of deliberate murderer,
cold-blooded and calculating, who kills for a song, delights in
killing, and gives its whole intellect to the consideration of each
detail, glorying in evading detection and revelling in the notoriety of
the trial, if caught. At first he had answered reluctantly, but as
Williams plied his questions intelligently, the young doctor warmed up
and became enthusiastic with a sort of cold intellectual enthusiasm,
till at last he held forth like a lecturer, pacing his cell,
gesticulating, explaining with admirable exposition how easy murder
could be to a man who knew his business.</p>

<p>And he did know his business! No man, in these days of inquests and
post-mortem examination, would inject poisons that might be found weeks
afterwards in the viscera of the victim. No man who knew his
business!</p>

<p>"What is more easy," he said, holding the bars with his long white
fingers and gazing into the reporter's eyes, "than to take a disease
germ ['cherm' he pronounced it] of typhus, plague, or any cherm you
blease, and make so virulent a culture that no medicine in the vorld
could counteract it; a really powerful microbe--and then scratch the
skin of your victim with a pin? And who could drace it to you, or
accuse you of murder?"</p>

<p>Williams, as he watched and heard, was glad the bars were between
them; but, even so, something invisible seemed to pass from the
prisoner's atmosphere and lay an icy finger on his heart. He had come
into contact with every possible kind of crime and criminal, and had
interviewed scores of men who, for jealousy, greed, passion or other
comprehensible emotion, had killed and paid the penalty of killing. He
understood that. Any man with strong passions was a potential killer.
But never before had he met a man who in cold blood, deliberately,
under no emotion greater than boredom, would destroy a human life and
then boast of his ability to do it.</p>

<p>Yet this, he felt sure, was what Hensig had done, and what his vile
words shadowed forth and betrayed. Here was something outside humanity,
something terrible, monstrous; and it made him shudder. This young
doctor, he felt, was a fiend incarnate, a man who thought less of human
life than the lives of flies in summer, and who would kill with as
steady a hand and cool a brain as though he were performing a common
operation in the hospital.</p>

<p>Thus the reporter left the prison gates with a vivid impression in
his mind, though exactly how his conclusion was reached was more than
he could tell. This time the mental brooms failed to act. The horror of
it remained.</p>

<p>On the way out into the street he ran against Policeman Dowling of
the ninth precinct, with whom he had been fast friends since the day he
wrote a glowing account of Dowling's capture of a "greengoods-man",
when Dowling had been so drunk that he nearly lost his prisoner
altogether. The policeman had never forgotten the good turn; it had
promoted him to plain clothes; and he was always ready to give the
reporter any news he had.</p>

<p>"Know of anything good to-day?" he asked by way of habit.</p>

<p>"Bet your bottom dollar I do," replied the coarse-faced Irish
policeman; "one of the best, too. I've got Hensig!"</p>

<p>Dowling spoke with pride and affection. He was mighty pleased, too,
because his name would be in the paper every day for a week or more,
and a big case helped the chances of promotion.</p>

<p>Williams cursed inwardly. Apparently there was no escape from this
man Hensig.</p>

<p>"Not much of a case, is it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It's a jim dandy, that's what it is," replied the other, a little
offended. "Hensig may miss the Chair because the evidence is weak, but
he's the worst I've ever met. Why, he'd poison you as soon as spit in
your eye, and if he's got a heart at all he keeps it on ice."</p>

<p>"What makes you think that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, they talk pretty freely to us sometimes," the policeman said,
with a significant wink.</p>

<p>"Can't be used against them at the trial, and it kind o' relieves
their mind, I guess. But I'd just as soon not have heard most of what
that guy told me--see? Come in," he added, looking round cautiously;
"I'll set 'em up and tell you a bit."</p>

<p>Williams entered the side-door of a saloon with him, but not too
willingly.</p>

<p>"A glarss of Scotch for the Englishman," ordered the officer
facetiously, "and I'll take a horse's collar with a dash of peach
bitters in it--just what you'd notice, no more." He flung down a
half-dollar, and the bar-tender winked and pushed it back to him across
the counter.</p>

<p>"What's yours, Mike?" he asked him.</p>

<p>"I'll take a cigar," said the bar-tender, pocketing the proffered
dime and putting a cheap cigar in his waistcoat pocket, and then moving
off to allow the two men elbowroom to talk in.</p>

<p>They talked in low voices with heads close together for fifteen
minutes, and then the reporter set up another round of drinks. The
bar-tender took his money. Then they talked a bit longer, Williams
rather white about the gills and the policeman very much in
earnest.</p>

<p>"The boys are waiting for me up at Brodie's," said Williams at
length. "I must be off."</p>

<p>"That's so," said Dowling, straightening up. "We'll just liquor up
again to show there's no ill-feeling. And mind you see me every morning
before the case is called. Trial begins to-morrow."</p>

<p>They swallowed their drinks, and again the bar-tender took a
ten-cent piece and pocketed a cheap cigar.</p>

<p>"Don't print what I've told you, and don't give it up to the other
reporters," said Dowling as they separated. "And if you want
confirmation jest take the cars and run down to Amityville, Long
Island, and you'll find what I've said is O.K. every time."</p>

<p>Williams went back to Steve Brodie's, his thoughts whizzing about
him like bees in a swarm. What he had heard increased tenfold his
horror of the man. Of course, Dowling may have lied or exaggerated, but
he thought not. It was probably all true, and the newspaper offices
knew something about it when they sent good men to cover the case.
Williams wished to Heaven he had nothing to do with the thing; but
meanwhile he could not write what he had heard, and all the other
reporters wanted was the result of his interview. That was good for
half a column, even expurgated.</p>

<p>He found the Senator in the middle of a story to Galusha, while
Whitey Fife was knocking cocktail glasses off the edge of the table and
catching them just before they reached the floor, pretending they were
Steve Brodie jumping from the Brooklyn Bridge. He had promised to set
up the drinks for the whole bar if he missed, and just as Williams
entered a glass smashed to atoms on the stones, and a roar of laughter
went up from the room. Five or six men moved up to the bar and took
their liquor, Williams included, and soon after Whitey and Galusha went
off to get some lunch and sober up, having first arranged to meet
Williams later in the evening and get the "story" from him.</p>

<p>"Get much?" asked the Senator.</p>

<p>"More than I care about," replied the other, and then told his
friend the story.</p>

<p>The Senator listened with intense interest, making occasional notes
from time to time, and asking a few questions. Then, when Williams had
finished, he said quietly:</p>

<p>"I guess Dowling's right. Let's jump on a car and go down to --ille,
and see what they think about him down there."</p>

<p>Amityville was a scattered village some twenty miles away on Long
Island, where Dr. Hensig had lived and practised for the last year or
two, and where Mrs. Hensig No. 2 had come to her suspicious death. The
neighbours would be sure to have plenty to say, and though it might not
prove of great value, it would be certainly interesting. So the two
reporters went down there, and interviewed anyone and everyone they
could find, from the man in the drug-store to the parson and the
undertaker, and the stories they heard would fill a book.</p>

<p>"Good stuff," said the Senator, as they journeyed back to New York
on the steamer, "but nothing we can use, I guess." His face was very
grave, and he seemed troubled in his mind.</p>

<p>"Nothing the District Attorney can use either at the trial,"
observed Williams.</p>

<p>"It's simply a devil--not a man at all," the other continued, as if
talking to himself. "Utterly unmoral! I swear I'll make MacSweater put
me to another job."</p>

<p>For the stories they had heard showed Dr. Hensig as a man who openly
boasted that he could kill without detection; that no enemy of his
lived long; that, as a doctor, he had, or ought to have, the right over
life and death; and that if a person was a nuisance, or a trouble to
him, there was no reason he should not put them away, provided he did
it without rousing suspicion. Of course he had not shouted these views
aloud in the market-place, but he had let people know that he held
them, and held them seriously. They had fallen from him in
conversation, in unguarded moments, and were clearly the natural
expression of his mind and views. And many people in the village
evidently had no doubt that he had put them into practice more than
once.</p>

<p>"There's nothing to give up to Whitey or Galusha, though," said the
Senator decisively, "and there's hardly anything we can use in our
story."</p>

<p>"I don't think I should care to use it anyhow," Williams said, with
rather a forced laugh.</p>

<p>The Senator looked round sharply by way of question.</p>

<p>"Hensig may be acquitted and get out," added Williams. "Same here. I
guess you're dead right," he said slowly, and then added more
cheerfully, "Let's go and have dinner in Chinatown, and write our copy
together." So they went down Pell Street, and turned up some dark
wooden stairs into a Chinese restaurant, smelling strongly of opium and
of cooking not Western. Here at a little table on the sanded floor they
ordered chou chop suey and chou om dong in brown bowls, and washed it
down with frequent doses of the fiery white whisky, and then moved into
a corner and began to cover their paper with pencil writing for the
consumption of the great American public in the morning.</p>

<p>"There's not much to choose between Hensig and that," said the
Senator, as one of the degraded white women who frequent Chinatown
entered the room and sat down at an empty table to order whisky. For,
with four thousand Chinamen in the quarter, there is not a single
Chinese woman.</p>

<p>"All the difference in the world," replied Williams, following his
glance across the smoky room. "She's been decent once, and may be again
some day, but that damned doctor has never been anything but what he
is--a soulless, intellectual devil. He doesn't belong to humanity at
all. I've got a horrid idea that--"</p>

<p>"How do you spell 'bacteriology,' two r's or one?" asked the
Senator, going on with his scrawly writing of a story that would be
read with interest by thousands next day.</p>

<p>"Two r's and one k," laughed the other. And they wrote on for
another hour, and then went to turn it into their respective offices in
Park Row.</p>

<p>The trial of Max Hensig lasted two weeks, for his relations supplied
money, and he got good lawyers and all manner of delays. From a
newspaper point of view it fell utterly flat, and before the end of the
fourth day most of the papers had shunted their big men on to other
jobs more worthy of their powers.</p>

<p>From Williams's point of view, however, it did not fall flat, and he
was kept on it till the end.</p>

<p>A reporter, of course, has no right to indulge in editorial remarks,
especially when a case is still sub judice, but in New York journalism
and the dignity of the law have a standard all their own, and into his
daily reports there crept the distinct flavour of his own conclusions.
Now that new men, with whom he had no agreement to "give up", were
covering the story for the other papers, he felt free to use any
special knowledge in his possession, and a good deal of what he had
heard at Amityville and from officer Dowling somehow managed to creep
into his writing. Something of the horror and loathing he felt for this
doctor also betrayed itself, more by inference than actual statement,
and no one who read his daily column could come to any other conclusion
than that Hensig was a calculating, cool-headed murderer of the most
dangerous type.</p>

<p>This was a little awkward for the reporter, because it was his duty
every morning to interview the prisoner in his cell, and get his views
on the conduct of the case in general and on his chances of escaping
the Chair in particular.</p>

<p>Yet Hensig showed no embarrassment. All the newspapers were supplied
to him, and he evidently read every word that Williams wrote. He must
have known what the reporter thought about him, at least so far as his
guilt or innocence was concerned, but he expressed no opinion as to the
fairness of the articles, and talked freely of his chances of ultimate
escape. The very way in which he glorified in being the central figure
of a matter that bulked so large in the public eye seemed to the
reporter an additional proof of the man's perversity. His vanity was
immense. He made most careful toilets, appearing every day in a clean
shirt and a new tie, and never wearing the same suit on two consecutive
days. He noted the descriptions of his personal appearance in the
Press, and was quite offended if his clothes and bearing in court were
not referred to in detail...And he was unusually delighted and pleased
when any of the papers stated that he looked smart and self-possessed,
or showed great self-control--which some of them did.</p>

<p>"They make a hero of me," he said one morning when Williams went to
see him as usual before court opened, "and if I go to the Chair--which
I tink I not do, you know--you shall see something fine. Berhaps they
electrocute a corpse only!"</p>

<p>And then, with dreadful callousness, he began to chaff the reporter
about the tone of his articles--for the first time.</p>

<p>"I only report what is said and done in court," stammered Williams,
horribly uncomfortable, "and I am always ready to write anything you
care to say--"</p>

<p>"I haf no fault to find," answered Hensig, his cold blue eyes fixed
on the reporter's face through the bars, "none at all. You tink I haf
killed, and you show it in all your sendences. Haf you ever seen a man
in the Chair, I ask you?"</p>

<p>Williams was obliged to say he had.</p>

<p>"Ach was! You haf indeed!" said the doctor coolly.</p>

<p>"It's instantaneous, though," the other added quickly, "and must be
quite painless" This was not exactly what he thought, but what else
could he say to the poor devil who might presently be strapped down
into it with that horrid band across his shaved head!</p>

<p>Hensig laughed, and turned away to walk up and down the narrow cell.
Suddenly he made a quick movement and sprang like a panther close up to
the bars, pressing his face between them with an expression that was
entirely new. Williams started back a pace in spite of himself.</p>

<p>"There are worse ways of dying than that," he said in a low voice,
with a diabolical look in his eyes: "slower ways that are bainful much
more. I shall get oudt. I shall not be conficted. I shall get oudt, and
then perhaps I come and tell you apout them."</p>

<p>The hatred in his voice and expression was unmistakable, but almost
at once the face changed back to the cold pallor it usually wore, and
the extraordinary doctor was laughing again and quietly discussing his
lawyers and their good or bad points.</p>

<p>After all, then, that skin of indifference was only assumed, and the
man really resented bitterly the tone of his articles. He liked the
publicity, but was furious with Williams for having come to a
conclusion and for letting that conclusion show through his
reports.</p>

<p>The reporter was relieved to get out into the fresh air. He walked
briskly up the stone steps to the court-room, still haunted by the
memory of that odious white face pressing between the bars and the
dreadful look in the eyes that had come and gone so swiftly. And what
did those words mean exactly? Had he heard them right? Were they a
threat?</p>

<p>"There are slower and more painful ways of dying, and if I get out I
shall perhaps come and tell you about them."</p>

<p>The work of reporting the evidence helped to chase the disagreeable
vision, and the compliments of the city editor on the excellence of his
"story", with its suggestion of a possible increase of salary, gave his
mind quite a different turn; yet always at the back of his
consciousness there remained the vague, unpleasant memory that he had
roused the bitter hatred of this man, and, as he thought, of a man who
was a veritable monster.</p>

<p>There may have been something hypnotic, a little perhaps, in this
obsessing and haunting idea of the man's steely wickedness,
intellectual and horribly skilful, moving freely through life with
something like a god's power and with a list of unproved and unprovable
murders behind him. Certainly it impressed his imagination with very
vivid force, and he could not think of this doctor, young, with unusual
knowledge and out-of-the-way skill, yet utterly unmoral, free to work
his will on men and women who displeased him, and almost safe from
detection--he could not think of it all without a shudder and a
crawling of the skin. He was exceedingly glad when the last day of the
trial was reached and he no longer was obliged to seek the daily
interview in the cell, or to sit all day in the crowded court watching
the detestable white face of the prisoner in the dock and listening to
the web of evidence closing round him, but just failing to hold him
tight enough for the Chair. For Hensig was acquitted, though the jury
sat up all night to come to a decision, and the final interview
Williams had with the man immediately before his release into the
street was the pleasantest and yet the most disagreeable of all.</p>

<p>"I knew I get oudt all right," said Hensig with a slight laugh, but
without showing the real relief he must have felt. "No one peliefed me
guilty but my vife's family and yourself, Mr. Vulture reporter. I read
efery day your repordts. You chumped to a conglusion too quickly, I
tink"</p>

<p>"Oh, we write what we're told to write--"</p>

<p>"Berhaps some day you write anozzer story, or berhaps you read the
story someone else write of your own trial. Then you understand better
what you make me feel."</p>

<p>Williams hurried on to ask the doctor for his opinion of the conduct
of the trial, and then inquired what his plans were for the future. The
answer to the question caused him genuine relief.</p>

<p>"Ach! I return of course to Chermany," he said. "People here are now
afraid of me a liddle. The newspapers haf killed me instead of the
Chair. Goot-bye, Mr. Vulture reporter, goot-bye!"</p>

<p>And Williams wrote out his last interview with as great a relief,
probably, as Hensig felt when he heard the foreman of the jury utter
the words "Not guilty"; but the line that gave him most pleasure was
the one announcing the intended departure of the acquitted man for
Germany.</p>

<p>The New York public want sensational reading in their daily life,
and they get it, for the newspaper that refused to furnish it would
fail in a week, and New York newspaper proprietors do not pose as
philanthropists. Horror succeeds horror, and the public interest is
never for one instant allowed to faint by the way.</p>

<p>Like any other reporter who betrayed the smallest powers of
description, Williams realised this fact with his very first week on
the Vulture. His daily work became simply a series of sensational
reports of sensational happenings; he lived in a perpetual whirl of
exciting arrests, murder trials, cases of blackmail, divorce, forgery,
arson, corruption, and every other kind of wickedness imaginable. Each
case thrilled him a little less than the preceding one; excess of
sensation bad simply numbed him; he became, not callous, but
irresponsive, and had long since reached the stage when excitement
ceases to betray judgment, as with inexperienced reporters it was apt
to do.</p>

<p>The Hensig case, however, for a long time lived in his imagination
and haunted him. The bald facts were buried in the police files at
Mulberry Street headquarters and in the newspaper office "morgues",
while the public, thrilled daily by fresh horrors, forgot the very
existence of the evil doctor a couple of days after the acquittal of
the central figure.</p>

<p>But for Williams it was otherwise. The personality of the heartless
and calculating murderer--the intellectual poisoner, as he called
him--had made a deep impression on his imaginations and for many weeks
his memory kept him alive as a moving and actual horror in his life.
The words he had heard him titter, with their covert threats and
ill-concealed animosity, helped, no doubt, to vivify the recollection
and to explain why Hensig stayed in his thoughts and haunted his dreams
with a persistence that reminded him of his very earliest cases on the
paper..With time, however, even Hensig began to fade away into the
confused background of piled up memories of prisoners and prison
scenes, and at length the memory became so deeply buried that it no
longer troubled him at all.</p>

<p>The summer passed, and Williams came back from his hard-earned
holiday of two weeks in the Maine backwoods. New York was at its best,
and the thousands who had been forced to stay and face its torrid
summer heats were beginning to revive under the spell of the brilliant
autumn days. Cool sea breezes swept over its burnt streets from the
Lower Bay, and across the splendid flood of the Hudson River the woods
on the Palisades of New Jersey had turned to crimson and gold. The air
was electric, sharp, sparkling, and the life of the city began to pulse
anew with its restless and impetuous energy. Bronzed faces from sea and
mountains thronged the streets, health and light-heartedness showed in
every eye, for autumn in New York wields a potent magic not to be
denied, and even the East Side slums, where the unfortunates crowd in
their squalid thousands, had the appearance of having been swept and
cleansed. Along the water-fronts especially the powers of sea and sun
and scented winds combined to work an irresistible fever in the hearts
of all who chafed within their prison walls.</p>

<p>And in Williams, perhaps more than in most, there was something that
responded vigorously to the influences of hope and cheerfulness
everywhere abroad. Fresh with the vigour of his holiday and full of
good resolutions for the coming winter he felt released from the evil
spell of irregular living, and as he crossed one October morning to
Staten Island in the big double-ender ferry-boat, his heart was light,
and his eye wandered to the blue waters and the hazy line of woods
beyond with feelings of pure gladness and delight.</p>

<p>He was on his way to Quarantine to meet an incoming liner for the
Vulture. A Jew-baiting member of the German Reichstag was coming to
deliver a series of lectures in New York on his favourite subject, and
the newspapers who deemed him worthy of notice at all were sending him
fair warning that his mission would be tolerated perhaps, but not
welcomed. The Jews were good citizens and America a "free country" and
his meetings in the Cooper Union Hall would meet with derision
certainly, and violence possibly.</p>

<p>The assignment was a pleasant one, and Williams had instructions to
poke fun at the officious and interfering German, and advise him to
return to Bremen by the next steamer without venturing among flying
eggs and dead cats on the platform. He entered fully into the spirit of
the job and was telling the Quarantine doctor about it as they steamed
down the bay in the little tug to meet the huge liner just anchoring
inside Sandy Hook.</p>

<p>The decks of the ship were crowded with passengers watching the
arrival of the puffing tug, and just as they drew alongside in the
shadow Williams suddenly felt his eyes drawn away from the swinging
rope ladder to some point about half-way down the length of the vessel.
There, among the intermediate passengers on the lower deck, he saw a
face staring at him with fixed intentness. The eyes were bright blue,
and the skin, in that row of bronzed passengers, showed remarkably
white. At once, and with a violent rush of blood from the heart, he
recognised Hensig.</p>

<p>In a moment everything about him changed: the blue waters of the bay
turned black, the light seemed to leave the sun, and all the old
sensations of fear and loathing came over him again like the memory of
some great pain. He shook himself, and clutched the rope ladder to
swing up after the Health Officer, angry, and yet genuinely alarmed at
the same time, to realise that the return of this man could so affect
him. His interview with the Jew-baiter was of the briefest possible
description, and he hurried through to catch the Quarantine tug back to
Staten Island, instead of steaming up the bay with the great liner into
dock, as the other reporters did. He had caught no second glimpse of
the hated German, and he even went so far as to harbour a faint hope
that he might have been deceived, and that some trick of resemblance in
another face had caused a sort of subjective hallucination. At any
rate, the days passed into weeks, and October slipped into November,
and there was no recurrence of the distressing vision. Perhaps, after
all, it was a stranger only; or, if it was Hensig, then he had
forgotten all about the reporter, and his return had no connection
necessarily with the idea of revenge.</p>

<p>None the less, however, Williams felt uneasy. He told his friend
Dowling, the policeman.</p>

<p>"Old news," laughed the Irishman. "Headquarters are keeping an eye
on him as a suspect. Berlin wants a man for two murders--goes by the
name of Brunner--and from their description we think it's this feller
Hensig. Nothing certain yet, but we're on his trail. I'm on his trail,"
he added proudly, "and don't you forget it! I'll let you know anything
when the time comes, but mum's the word just now!"</p>

<p>One night, not long after this meeting, Williams and the Senator
were covering a big fire on the West Side docks. They were standing on
the outskirts of the crowd watching the immense flames that a shouting
wind seemed to carry half-way across the river. The surrounding
shipping was brilliantly lit up and the roar was magnificent. The
Senator, having come out with none of his own, borrowed his friend's
overcoat for a moment to protect him from spray and flying cinders
while he went inside the fire lines for the latest information
obtainable. It was after midnight, and the main story had been
telephoned to the office; all they had now to do was to send in the
latest details and corrections to be written up at the news desk.</p>

<p>"I'll wait for you over at the corner!" shouted Williams, in moving
off through a scene of indescribable confusion and taking off his fire
badge as he went. This conspicuous brass badge, issued to reporters by
the Fire Department, gave them the right to pass within the police
cordon in the pursuit of information, and at their own risk. Hardly had
he unpinned it from his coat when a hand dashed out of the crowd
surging up against him and made a determined grab at it. He turned to
trace the owner, but at that instant a great lurching of the mob nearly
carried him off his feet, and he only just succeeded in seeing the arm
withdrawn, having failed of its object, before he was landed with a
violent push upon the pavement he had been aiming for.</p>

<p>The incident did not strike him as particularly odd, for in such a
crowd there are many who covet the privilege of getting closer to the
blaze. He simply laughed and put the badge safely in his pocket, and
then stood to watch the dying flames until his friend came to join him
with the latest details.</p>

<p>Yet, though time was pressing and the Senator had little enough to
do, it was fully half an hour before he came lumbering up through the
darkness. Williams recognised him some distance away by the check
ulster he wore--his own.</p>

<p>But was it the Senator, after all? The figure moved oddly and with a
limp, as though injured.</p>

<p>A few feet off it stopped and peered at Williams through the
darkness.</p>

<p>"That you, Williams?" asked a gruff voice.</p>

<p>"I thought you were someone else for a moment," answered the
reporter, relieved to recognise his friend, and moving forward to meet
him. "But what's wrong? Are you hurt?"</p>

<p>The Senator looked ghastly in the lurid glow of the fire. His face
was white, and there was a little trickle of blood on the forehead.</p>

<p>"Some fellow nearly did for me," he said; "deliberately pushed me
clean off the edge of the dock. If I hadn't fallen on to a broken pile
and found a boat, I'd have been drowned sure as God made little apples.
Think I know who it was, too. Think! I mean I know, because I saw his
damned white face and heard what he said." "Who in the world was it?
What did he want?" stammered the other.</p>

<p>The Senator took his arm, and lurched into the saloon behind them
for some brandy. As he did so he kept looking over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Quicker we're off from this dirty neighbourhood, the better," he
said.</p>

<p>Then he turned to Williams, looking oddly at him over the glass, and
answering his questions.</p>

<p>"Who was it?--why, it was Hensig! And what did he want?--well, he
wanted you!"</p>

<p>"Me! Hensig!" gasped the other.</p>

<p>"Guess he mistook me for you," went on the Senator, looking behind
him at the door. "The crowd was so thick I cut across by the edge of
the dock. It was quite dark. There wasn't a soul near me. I was
running. Suddenly what I thought was a stump got up in front of me,
and, Gee whiz, man! I tell you it was Hensig, or I'm a drunken
Dutchman. I looked bang into his face. 'Good-pye, Mr. Vulture
reporter,' he said, with a damned laugh, and gave me a push that sent
me backwards clean over the edge."</p>

<p>The Senator paused for breath, and to empty his second glass.</p>

<p>"My overcoat!" exclaimed Williams faintly.</p>

<p>"Oh, he'd been following you right enough, I guess."</p>

<p>The Senator was not really injured, and the two men walked back
towards Broadway to find a telephone, passing through a region of
dimly-lighted streets known as Little Africa, where the negroes lived,
and where it was safer to keep the middle of the road, thus avoiding
sundry dark alley-ways opening off the side. They talked hard all the
way.</p>

<p>"He's after you, no doubt," repeated the Senator. "I guess he never
forgot your report of his trial. Better keep your eye peeled!" he added
with a laugh.</p>

<p>But Williams didn't feel a bit inclined to laugh, and the thought
that it certainly was Hensig he had seen on the steamer, and that he
was following him so closely as to mark his check ulster and make an
attempt on his life, made him feel horribly uncomfortable, to say the
least. To be stalked by such a man was terrible. To realise that he was
marked down by that white-faced, cruel wretch, merciless and
implacable, skilled in the manifold ways of killing by stealth--that
somewhere in the crowds of the great city he was watched and waited
for, hunted, observed: here was an obsession really to torment and
become dangerous. Those light-blue eyes, that keen intelligence, that
mind charged with revenge, had been watching him ever since the trial,
even from across the sea. The idea terrified him. It brought death into
his thoughts for the first time with a vivid sense of nearness and
reality--far greater than anything he had experienced when watching
others die.</p>

<p>That night, in his dingy little room in the East Nineteenth Street
--ng-house, Williams went to bed in a blue funk, and for days
afterwards he went about his business in a continuation of the same
blue funk. It was useless to deny it. He kept his eyes everywhere,
thinking he was being watched and followed. A new face in the office,
at the --ng-house table, or anywhere on his usual beat, made him jump.
His daily work was haunted; his dreams were all nightmares; he forgot
all his good resolutions, and plunged into the old indulgences that
helped him to forget his distress. It took twice as much liquor to make
him jolly, and four times as much to make him reckless.</p>

<p>Not that he really was a drunkard, or cared to drink for its own
sake, but he moved in a thirsty world of reporters, policemen, reckless
and loose-living men and women, whose form of greeting was "What'll you
take?" and method of reproach "Oh, he's sworn off!" Only now he was
more careful how much he took, counting the cocktails and fizzes poured
into him during the course of his day's work, and was anxious never to
lose control of himself. He must be on the watch. He changed his eating
and drinking haunts, and altered any habits that could give a clue to
the devil on his trail. He even went so far as to change his
boarding-house. His emotion--the emotion of fear--changed everything.
It tinged the outer world with gloom, draping it in darker colours,
stealing something from the sunlight, reducing enthusiasm, and acting
as a heavy drag, as it were, upon all the normal functions of life.</p>

<p>The effect upon his imagination, already diseased by alcohol and
drugs, was, of course, exceedingly strong. The doctor's words about
developing a germ until it became too powerful to be touched by any
medicine, and then letting it into the victim's system by means of a
pin-scratch--this possessed him more than anything else. The idea
dominated his thoughts; it seemed so clever, so cruel, so devilish. The
"accident" at the fire had been, of course, a real accident, conceived
on the spur of the moment--the result of a chance meeting and a foolish
mistake.</p>

<p>Hensig had no need to resort to such clumsy methods. When the right
moment came he would adopt a far simpler, safer plan.</p>

<p>Finally, he became so obsessed by the idea that Hensig was following
him, waiting for his opportunity, that one day he told the news editor
the whole story. His nerves were so shaken that he could not do his
work properly.</p>

<p>"That's a good story. Make two hundred of it," said the editor at
once. "Fake the name, of course. Mustn't mention Hensig, or there'll be
a libel suit."</p>

<p>But William was in earnest, and insisted so forcibly that Treherne,
though busy as ever, took him aside into his room with the glass
door.</p>

<p>"Now, see here, Williams, you're drinking too much," he said;
"that's about the size of it. Steady up a bit on the wash, and Hensig's
face will disappear." He spoke kindly, but sharply. He was young
himself, awfully keen, with much knowledge of human nature and a rare
"nose for news". He understood the abilities of his small army of men
with intuitive judgment. That they drank was nothing to him, provided
they did their work. Everybody in that world drank, and the man who
didn't was looked upon with suspicion.</p>

<p>Williams explained rather savagely that the face was no mere symptom
of delirium tremens and the editor spared him another two minutes
before rushing out to tackle the crowd of men waiting for him at the
news desk.</p>

<p>"That so? You don't say!" he asked, with more interest. "Well, I
guess Hensig's simply trying to razzle-dazzle you. You tried to kill
him by your reports, and he wants to scare you by way of revenge. But
he'll never dare do anything. Throw him a good bluff, and he'll give in
like a baby. Everything's pretence in this world. But I rather like the
idea of the germs. That's original!"</p>

<p>Williams, a little angry at the other's flippancy, told the story of
the Senator's adventure and the changed overcoat.</p>

<p>"May be, may be," replied the hurried editor; "but the Senator
drinks Chinese whisky, and a man who does that might imagine anything
on God's earth. Take a tip, Williams, from an old hand, and let up a
bit on the liquor. Drop cocktails and keep to straight whisky, and
never drink on an empty stomach. Above all, don't mix!"</p>

<p>He gave him a keen look and was off.</p>

<p>"Next time you see this German," cried Treherne from the door, "go
up and ask him for an interview on what it feels like to escape from
the Chair--just to show him you don't care a red cent. Talk about
having him watched and followed--suspected man--and all that sort of
flim-flam. Pretend to warn him. It'll turn the tables and make him
digest a bit. See?" Williams sauntered out into the street to report a
meeting of the Rapid Transit Commissioners, and the first person he met
as he ran down the office steps was--Max Hensig.</p>

<p>Before he could stop, or swerve aside, they were face to face. His
head swam for a moment and he began to tremble. Then some measure of
self-possession returned, and he tried instinctively to act on the
editor's advice. No other plan was ready, so he drew on the last force
that had occupied his mind. It was that--or running.</p>

<p>Hensig, he noticed, looked prosperous; he wore a fur overcoat and
cap. His face was whiter than ever, and his blue eyes burned like
coals.</p>

<p>"Why! Dr. Hensig, you're back in New York!" he exclaimed. "When did
you arrive? I'm glad--I suppose--I mean--er--will you come and have a
drink?" he concluded desperately. It was very foolish, but for the life
of him he could think of nothing else to say. And the last thing in the
world he wished was that his enemy should know that he was afraid.</p>

<p>"I tink not, Mr. Vulture reporder, tanks," he answered coolly; "but
I sit py and vatch you drink." His self-possession was as perfect, as
it always was.</p>

<p>But Williams, more himself now, seized on the refusal and moved on,
saying something about having a meeting to go to.</p>

<p>"I walk a liddle way with you, berhaps," Hensig said, following him
down the pavement.</p>

<p>It was impossible to prevent him, and they started side by side
across City Hall Park towards Broadway. It was after four o'clock: the
dusk was falling: the little park was thronged with people walking in
all directions, everyone in a terrific hurry as usual. Only Hensig
seemed calm and unmoved among that racing, tearing life about them. He
carried an atmosphere of ice about with him: it was his voice and
manner that produced this impression; his mind was alert, watchful,
determined, always sure of itself.</p>

<p>Williams wanted to run. He reviewed swiftly in his mind a dozen ways
of getting rid of him quickly, yet knowing well they were all futile.
He put his hands in his overcoat pockets--the check ulster--and watched
sideways every movement of his companion.</p>

<p>"Living in New York again, aren't you?" he began.</p>

<p>"Not as a doctor any more," was the reply. "I now teach and study.
Also I write sciendific books a liddle--"</p>

<p>"What about?"</p>

<p>"Cherms," said the other, looking at him and laughing.</p>

<p>"Disease cherms, their culture and development." He put the accent
on the "op".</p>

<p>Williams walked more quickly. With a great effort he tried to put
Treherne's advice into practice.</p>

<p>"You care to give me an interview any time--on your special
subjects?" he asked, as naturally as he could.</p>

<p>"Oh yes; with much bleasure. I lif in Harlem now, if you will call
von day--"</p>

<p>"Our office is best," interrupted the reporter. "Paper, desks,
library, all handy for use, you know."</p>

<p>"If you're afraid--" began Hensig. Then, without finishing the
sentence, he added with a laugh, "I haf no arsenic there. You not tink
me any more a pungling boisoner? You haf changed your mind about all
dat?"</p>

<p>Williams felt his flesh beginning to creep. How could he speak of
such a matter! His own wife, too!</p>

<p>He turned quickly and faced him, standing still for a moment so that
the throng of people deflected into two streams past them. He felt it
absolutely imperative upon him to say something that should convince
the German he was not afraid.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are aware, Dr. Hensig, that the police know you have
returned, and that you are being watched probably?" he said in a low
voice, forcing himself to meet the odious blue eyes.</p>

<p>"And why not, bray?" he asked imperturbably.</p>

<p>"They may suspect something--"</p>

<p>"Susbected--already again? Ach was!" said the German.</p>

<p>"I only wished to warn you--" stammered Williams, who always found
it difficult to remain self-possessed under the other's dreadful
stare.</p>

<p>"No boliceman see what I do--or catch me again," he laughed quite
horribly. "But I tank you all the same."</p>

<p>Williams turned to catch a Broadway car going at full speed. He
could not stand another minute with this man, who affected him so
disagreeably.</p>

<p>"I call at the office one day to gif you interview!" Hensig shouted
as he dashed off, and the next minute he was swallowed up in the crowd,
and Williams, with mixed feelings and a strange inner trembling, went
to cover the meeting of the Rapid Transit Board.</p>

<p>But, while he reported the proceedings mechanically, his mind was
busy with quite other thoughts. Hensig was at his side the whole time.
He felt quite sure, however unlikely it seemed, that there was no fancy
in his fears, and that he had judged the German correctly. Hensig hated
him, and would put him out of the way if he could. He would do it in
such a way that detection would be almost impossible. He would not
shoot or poison in the ordinary way, or resort to any clumsy method. He
would simply follow, watch, wait his opportunity, and then act with
utter callousness and remorseless determination. And Williams already
felt pretty certain of the means that would be employed: "Cherms!"</p>

<p>This meant proximity. He must watch everyone who came close to him
in trains, cars, restaurants--anywhere and everywhere. It could be done
in a second: only a slight scratch would be necessary, and the disease
would be in his blood with such strength that the chances of recovery
would be slight. And what could he do? He could not have Hensig watched
or arrested.</p>

<p>He had no story to tell to a magistrate, or to the police, for no
one would listen to such a tale.</p>

<p>And, if he were stricken down by sudden illness, what was more
likely than to say he had caught the fever in the ordinary course of
his work, since he was always frequenting noisome dens and the haunts
of the very poor, the foreign and filthy slums of the East Side, and
the hospitals, morgues, and cells of all sorts and conditions of men?
No; it was a disagreeable situation, and Williams, young, shaken in
nerve, and easily impressionable as he was, could not prevent its
obsession of his mind and imagination.</p>

<p>"If I get suddenly ill," he told the Senator, his only friend in the
whole city, "and send for you, look carefully for a scratch on my body.
Tell Dowling, and tell the doctor the story."</p>

<p>"You think Hensig goes about with a little bottle of plague germs in
his vest pocket?" laughed the other reporter, ready to scratch you with
a pin?"</p>

<p>"Some damned scheme like that, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"Nothing could be proved anyway. He wouldn't keep the evidence in
his pocket till he was arrested, would he?"</p>

<p>During the next week or two Williams ran against Hensig
twice--accidentally. The first time it happened just outside his own
boarding-house--the new one. Hensig had his foot on the stone steps as
if just about to come up, but quick as a flash he turned his face away
and moved on down the Street. This was about eight o'clock in the
evening, and the hall light fell through the opened door upon his face.
The second time it was not so clear: the reporter was covering a case
in the courts, a case of suspicious death in which a woman was chief
prisoner, and he thought he saw the doctor's white visage watching him
from among the crowd at the back of the court-room.</p>

<p>When he looked a second time, however, the face had disappeared, and
there was no sign afterwards of its owner in the lobby or corridor.</p>

<p>That same day he met Dowling in the building; he was promoted now,
and was always in plain clothes. The detective drew him aside into a
corner. The talk at once turned upon the German.</p>

<p>"We're watching him too," he said. "Nothing you can use yet, but
he's changed his name again, and never stops at the same address for
more than a week or two. I guess he's Brunner right enough, the man
Berlin's looking for. He's a holy terror if ever there was one."</p>

<p>Dowling was happy as a schoolboy to be in touch with such a
promising case.</p>

<p>"What's he up to now in particular?" asked the other.</p>

<p>"Something pretty black," said the detective. "But I can't tell you
yet awhile. He calls himself Schmidt now, and he's dropped the
'Doctor.' We may take him any day--just waiting for advices from
Germany."</p>

<p>Williams told his story of the overcoat adventure with the Senator,
and his belief that Hensig was waiting for a suitable opportunity to
catch him alone.</p>

<p>"That's dead likely too," said Dowling, and added carelessly, "I
guess we'll have to make some kind of a case against him anyway, just
to get him out of the way. He's dangerous to be around huntin' on the
loose."</p>

<p>So gradual sometimes are the approaches of fear that the processes
by which it takes possession of a man's soul are often too insidious to
be recognised, much less to be dealt with, until their object has been
finally accomplished and the victim has lost the power to act. And by
this time the reporter, who had again plunged into excess, felt so
nerveless that, if he met Hensig face to face, he could not answer for
what he might do. He might assault his tormentor violently--one result
of terror--or he might find himself powerless to do anything at all but
yield, like a bird fascinated before a snake.</p>

<p>He was always thinking now of the moment when they would meet, and
of what would happen; for he was just as certain that they must meet
eventually, and that Hensig would try to kill him, as that his next
birthday would find him twenty-five years old. That meeting, he well
knew, could be delayed only, not prevented, and his changing again to
another boarding-house, or moving altogether to a different city, could
only postpone the final accounting between them.</p>

<p>It was bound to come.</p>

<p>A reporter on a New York newspaper has one day in seven to himself.
Williams's day off was Monday, and he was always glad when it came.
Sunday was especially arduous for him, because in addition to the
unsatisfactory nature of the day's assignments, involving private
interviewing which the citizens pretended to resent on their day of
rest, he had the task in the evening of reporting a difficult sermon in
a Brooklyn church. Having only a column and a half at his disposal, he
had to condense as he went along, and the speaker was so rapid, and so
fond of lengthy quotations, that the reporter found his shorthand only
just equal to the task. It was usually after half-past nine o'clock
when he left the church, and there was still the labour of transcribing
his notes in the office against time.</p>

<p>The Sunday following the glimpse of his tormentor's face in the
court-room he was busily condensing the wearisome periods of the
preacher. sitting at a little table immediately under the pulpit, when
he glanced up during a brief pause and let his eye wander over the
congregation and up to the crowded galleries. Nothing was farther at
the moment from his much-occupied brain than the doctor of Amityville,
and it was such an unexpected shock to encounter his fixed stare up
there among the occupants of the front row, watching him with an evil
smile, that his senses temporarily deserted him. The next sentence of
the preacher was wholly lost, and his shorthand during the brief
remainder of the sermon was quite illegible, he found, when he came to
transcribe it at the office.</p>

<p>It was after one o'clock in the morning when he finished, and he
went out feeling exhausted and rather shaky. In the all-night
drug-store at the corner he indulged accordingly in several more
glasses of whisky than usual, and talked a long time with the man who
guarded the back room and served liquor to the few who knew the
pass-word, since the shop had really no licence at all.</p>

<p>The true reason for this delay he recognised quite plainly: he was
afraid of the journey home along the dark and emptying streets. The
lower end of New York is practically deserted after ten o'clock: it has
no residences, no theatres, no caf&eacute;s, and only a few travellers
from late ferries share it with reporters, a sprinkling of policemen,
and the ubiquitous ne'er-do-wells who haunt the saloon doors. The
newspaper world of Park Row was, of course, alive with light and
movement, but once outside that narrow zone and the night descended
with an effect of general darkness.</p>

<p>Williams thought of spending three dollars on a cab, but dismissed
the idea because of its extravagance. Presently Galusha Owens came
in--too drunk to be of any use, though, as a companion. Besides, he
lived in Harlem, which was miles beyond Nineteenth Street, where
Williams had to go. He took another rye whisky--his fourth--and looked
cautiously through the coloured glass windows into the Street. No one
was visible. Then he screwed up his nerves another twist or two, and
made a bolt for it, taking the steps in a sort of flying leap--and
running full tilt into a man whose figure seemed almost to have risen
out of the very pavement.</p>

<p>He gave a cry and raised his fists to strike.</p>

<p>"Where's your hurry?" laughed a familiar voice. "Is the Prince of
Wales dead?" It was the Senator, most welcome of all possible
appearances.</p>

<p>"Come in and have a horn," said Williams, "and then I'll walk home
with you." He was immensely glad to see him, for only a few streets
separated their respective boarding-houses.</p>

<p>"But he'd never sit out a long sermon just for the pleasure of
watching you," observed the Senator after hearing his friend's excited
account.</p>

<p>"That man'll take any trouble in the world to gain his end," said
the other with conviction.</p>

<p>"He's making a study of all my movements and habits. He's not the
sort to take chances when it's a matter of life and death. I'll bet
he's not far away at this moment."</p>

<p>"Rats!" exclaimed the Senator, laughing in rather a forced way.
"You're getting the jumps with your Hensig and death. Have another
rye."</p>

<p>They finished their drinks and went out together, crossing City Hall
Park diagonally towards Broadway, and then turning north. They crossed
Canal and Grand Streets, deserted and badly lighted. Only a few drunken
loiterers passed them. Occasionally a policeman on the corner, always
close to the side-door of a saloon, of course, recognised one or other
of them and called good night. Otherwise there was no one, and they
seemed to have this part of Manhattan Island pretty well to themselves.
The presence of the Senator, ever cheery and kind, keeping close to his
friend all the way, the effect of the half-dozen whiskies, and the
sight of the guardians of the law, combined to raise the reporter's
spirits somewhat: and when they reached Fourteenth Street, with its
better light and greater traffic, and saw Union Square lying just
beyond, close to his own street, he felt a distinct increase of courage
and no objection to going on alone..."Good night!" cried the Senator
cheerily. "Get home safe; I turn off here anyway." He hesitated a
moment before turning down the street, and then added, "You feel O.K.,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"You may get double rates for an exclusive bit of news if you come
on and see me assaulted," Williams replied, laughing aloud, and then
waiting to see the last of his friend.</p>

<p>But the moment the Senator was gone the laughter disappeared. He
went on alone, crossing the square among the trees and walking very
quickly. Once or twice he turned to see if anybody were following him,
and his eyes scanned carefully as he passed every occupant of the park
benches where a certain number of homeless loafers always find their
night's lodging. But there was nothing apparently to cause him alarm,
and in a few minutes more he would be safe in the little back bedroom
of his own house. Over the way he saw the lights of Burbacher's saloon,
where respectable Germans drank Rhine wine and played chess till all
hours. He thought of going in for a night-cap, hesitating for a moment,
but finally going on. When he got to the end of the square, however,
and saw the dark opening of East Eighteenth Street, he thought after
all he would go back and have another drink. He hovered for a moment on
the kerbstone and then turned; his will often slipped a cog now in this
way.</p>

<p>It was only when he was on his way back that he realised the truth:
that his real reason for turning back and avoiding the dark open mouth
of the street was because he was afraid of something its shadows might
conceal. This dawned upon him quite suddenly. If there had been a light
at the corner of the street he would never have turned back at all. And
as this passed through his mind, already somewhat fuddled with what he
had drunk, he became aware that the figure of a man had slipped forward
out of the dark space he had just refused to enter, and was following
him down the street. The man was pressing, too, close into the houses,
using any protection of shadow or railing that would enable him to move
unseen.</p>

<p>But the moment Williams entered the bright section of pavement
opposite the wine-room windows he knew that this man had come close up
behind him, with a little silent run, and he turned at once to face
him. He saw a slim man with dark hair and blue eyes, and recognised him
instantly.</p>

<p>"It's very late to be coming home," said the man at once. "I thought
I recognised my reporder friend from the Vulhire." These were the
actual words, and the voice was meant to be pleasant, but what Williams
thought he heard, spoken in tones of ice, was something like, "At last
I've caught you! You are in a state of collapse nervously, and you are
exhausted. I can do what I please with you." For the face and the voice
were those of Hensig the Tormentor, and the dyed hair only served to
emphasise rather grotesquely the man's features and make the pallor of
the skin greater by contrast.</p>

<p>His first instinct was to turn and run, his second to fly at the man
and strike him. A terror beyond death seized him. A pistol held to his
head, or a waving bludgeon, he could easily have faced; but this odious
creature, slim, limp, and white of face, with his terrible suggestion
of cruelty, literally appalled him so that he could think of nothing
intelligent to do or to say. This accurate knowledge of his movements,
too, added to his distress--this waiting for him at night when he was
tired and foolish from excess. At that moment he knew all the
sensations of the criminal a few hours before his execution: the bursts
of hysterical terror, the inability to realise his position, to hold
his thoughts steady, the helplessness of it all. Yet, in the end, the
reporter heard his own voice speaking with a rather weak and unnatural
kind of tone and accompanied by a gulp of forced laughter--heard
himself stammering the ever-ready formula: "I was going to have a drink
before turning in--will you join me?"</p>

<p>The invitation, he realised afterwards, was prompted by the one fact
that stood forth clearly in his mind at the moment--the thought,
namely, that whatever he did or said, he must never let Hensig for one
instant imagine that he felt afraid and was so helpless a victim.</p>

<p>Side by side they moved down the street, for Hensig had acquiesced
in the suggestion, and Williams already felt dazed by the strong,
persistent will of his companion. His thoughts seemed to be flying
about somewhere outside his brain, beyond control, scattering wildly.
He could think of nothing further to say, and had the smallest
diversion furnished the opportunity he would have turned and run for
his life through the deserted streets.</p>

<p>"A glass of lager," he heard the German say, "I take berhaps that
with you. You know me in spite of--" he added, indicating by a movement
the changed colour of his hair and moustache.</p>

<p>"Also, I gif you now the interview you asked for, if you like."</p>

<p>The reporter agreed feebly, finding nothing adequate to reply. He
turned helplessly and looked into his face with something of the
sensations a bird may feel when it runs at last straight into the jaws
of the reptile that has fascinated it. The fear of weeks settled down
upon him, focussing about his heart. It was, of course, an effect of
hypnotism, he remembered thinking vaguely through the befuddlement of
his drink--this culminating effect of an evil and remorseless
personality acting upon one that was diseased and extra receptive. And
while he made the suggestion and heard the other's acceptance of it, he
knew perfectly well that he was falling in with the plan of the
doctor's own making, a plan that would end in an assault upon his
person, perhaps a technical assault only--a mere touch--still, an
assault that would be at the same time an attempt at murder. The
alcohol buzzed in his ears. He felt strangely powerless. He walked
steadily to his doom, side by side with his executioner.</p>

<p>Any attempt to analyse the psychology of the situation was utterly
beyond him. But, amid the whirl of emotion and the excitement of the
whisky, he dimly grasped the importance of two fundamental things.</p>

<p>And the first was that, though he was now muddled and frantic, yet a
moment would come when his will would be capable of one supreme effort
to escape, and that therefore it would be wiser for the present to
waste no atom of volition on temporary half-measures. He would play
dead dog. The fear that now paralysed him would accumulate till it
reached the point of saturation: that would be the time to strike for
his life. For just as the coward may reach a stage where he is capable
of a sort of frenzied heroism that no ordinarily brave man could
compass, so the victim of fear, at a point varying with his balance of
imagination and physical vigour, will reach a state where fear leaves
him and he becomes numb to its effect from sheer excess of feeling it.
It is the point of saturation. He may then turn suddenly calm and act
with a judgment and precision that simply bewilder the object of the
attack. It is, of course, the inevitable swing of the pendulum, the law
of equal action and reaction.</p>

<p>Hazily, tipsily perhaps, Williams was conscious of this potential
power deep within him, below the superficial layers of smaller
emotions--could he but be sufficiently terrified to reach it and bring
it to the surface where it must result in action.</p>

<p>And, as a consequence of this foresight of his sober subliminal
self, he offered no opposition to the least suggestion of his
tormentor, but made up his mind instinctively to agree to all that he
proposed. Thus he lost no atom of the force he might eventually call
upon, by friction over details which in any case he would yield in the
end. And at the same tune he felt intuitively that his utter weakness
might even deceive his enemy a little and increase the chances of his
single effort to escape when the right moment arrived.</p>

<p>That Williams was able to "imagine" this true psychology, yet wholly
unable to analyse it, simply showed that on occasion he could be
psychically active. His deeper subliminal self, stirred by the alcohol
and the stress of emotion, was guiding him, and would continue to guide
him in proportion as he let his fuddled normal self slip into the
background without attempt to interfere.</p>

<p>And the second fundamental thing he grasped--due even more than the
first to psychic intuition--was the certainty that he could drink more,
up to a certain point, with distinct advantage to his power and
lucidity--but up to a given point only. After that would come
unconsciousness, a single sip too much and he would cross the
frontier--a very narrow one. It was as though he knew intuitively that
"the drunken consciousness is one bit of the mystic consciousness." At
present he was only fuddled and fearful, but additional stimulant would
inhibit the effects of the other emotions, give him unbounded
confidence, clarify his judgment and increase his capacity to a stage
far beyond the normal. Only--he must stop in time.</p>

<p>His chances of escape, therefore, so far as he could understand,
depended on these two things: he must drink till he became
self-confident and arrived at the abnormally clear-minded stage of
drunkenness; and he must wait for the moment when Hensig had so filled
him up with fear that he no longer could react to it. Then would be the
time to strike. Then his will would be free and have judgment behind
it.</p>

<p>These were the two things standing up clearly somewhere behind that
great confused turmoil of mingled fear and alcohol.</p>

<p>Thus for the moment, though with scattered forces and rather wildly
feeble thoughts, he moved down the street beside the man who hated him
and meant to kill him. He had no purpose at all but to agree and to
wait. Any attempt he made now could end only in failure.</p>

<p>They talked a little as they went, the German calm, chatting as
though he were merely an agreeable acquaintance, but behaving with the
obvious knowledge that he held his victim secure, and that his
struggles would prove simply rather amusing. He even laughed about his
dyed hair, saying by way of explanation that he had done it to please a
woman who told him it would make him look younger. Williams knew this
was a lie, and that the police had more to do with the change than a
woman; but the man's vanity showed through the explanation, and was a
vivid little self-revelation.</p>

<p>He objected to entering Burbacher's, saying that he (Burbacher) paid
no blackmail to the police, and might be raided for keeping open after
hours.</p>

<p>"I know a nice quiet blace on T'ird Avenue. We go there," he
said.</p>

<p>Williams, walking unsteadily and shaking inwardly, still groping,
too, feebly after a way of escape, turned down the side street with
him. He thought of the men he had watched walking down the short
corridor from the cell to the "Chair" at Sing Sing, and wondered if
they felt as he did. It was like going to his own execution.</p>

<p>"I haf a new disgovery in bacteriology--in cherms," the doctor went
on, "and it will make me famous, for it is very imbortant. I gif it you
egsclusive for the Vulture, as you are a friend."</p>

<p>He became technical, and the reporter's mind lost itself among such
words as "toxins", "alkaloids", and the like. But he realised clearly
enough that Hensig was playing with him and felt absolutely sure of his
victim. When he lurched badly, as he did more than once, the German
took his arm by way of support, and at the vile touch of the man it was
all Williams could do not to scream or strike out blindly.</p>

<p>They turned up Third Avenue and stopped at the side door of a cheap
saloon. He noticed the name of Schumacher over the porch, but all
lights were out except a feeble glow that came through the glass
fanlight. A man pushed his face cautiously round the half-opened door,
and after a brief examination let them in with a whispered remark to be
quiet. It was the usual formula of the Tammany saloonkeeper, who paid
so much a month to the police to be allowed to keep open all night,
provided there was no noise or fighting. It was now well after one
o'clock in the morning, and the streets were deserted.</p>

<p>The reporter was quite at home in the sort of place they had
entered; otherwise the sinister aspect of a drinking "joint" after
hours, with its gloom and general air of suspicion, might have caused
him some extra alarm. A dozen men, unpleasant of countenance, were
standing at the bar, where a single lamp gave just enough light to
enable them to see their glasses. The bar-tender gave Hensig a swift
glance of recognition as they walked along the sanded floor.</p>

<p>"Come," whispered the German; "we go to the back room. I know the
bass-word," he laughed, leading the way.</p>

<p>They walked to the far end of the bar and opened a door into a
brightly lit room with about a dozen tables in it, at most of which men
sat drinking with highly painted women, talking loudly, quarrelling,
singing, and the air thick with smoke. No one took any notice of them
as they went down the room to a table in the corner farthest from the
door--Hensig chose it; and when the single waiter came up with "Was
nehmen die Herren?" and a moment later brought the rye whisky they both
asked for, Williams swallowed his own without the "chaser" of soda
water, and ordered another on the spot.</p>

<p>"It'sh awfully watered," he said rather thickly to his companion,
"and I'm tired."</p>

<p>"Cocaine, under the circumstances, would help you quicker, berhaps!"
replied the German with an expression of amusement. Good God! was there
nothing about him the man had not found out? He must have been
shadowing him for days; it was at least a week since Williams had been
to the First Avenue drug store to get the wicked bottle refilled. Had
he been on his trail every night when he left the office to go home?
This idea of remorseless persistence made him shudder.</p>

<p>"Then we finish quickly if you are tired," the doctor continued,
"and to-morrow you can show me your repordt for gorrections if you make
any misdakes berhaps. I gif you the address to-night pefore we
leave."</p>

<p>The increased ugliness of his speech and accent betrayed his growing
excitement. Williams drank his whisky, again without water, and called
for yet another, clinking glasses with the murderer opposite, and
swallowing half of this last glass, too, while Hensig merely tasted his
own, looking straight at him over the performance with his evil
eyes.</p>

<p>"I can write shorthand," began the reporter, trying to appear at his
ease.</p>

<p>"Ach, I know, of course."</p>

<p>There was a mirror behind the table, and he took a quick glance
round the room while the other began searching in his coat pocket for
the papers he had with him. Williams lost no single detail of his
movements, but at the same time managed swiftly to get the "note" of
the other occupants of the tables. Degraded and besotted faces he saw,
almost without exception, and not one to whom he could appeal for help
with any prospect of success. It was a further shock, too, to realise
that he preferred the more or less bestial countenances round him to
the intellectual and ascetic face opposite. They were at least human,
whereas he was something quite outside the pale; and this preference
for the low creatures, otherwise loathsome to him, brought his mind by
sharp contrast to a new and vivid realisation of the personality before
him. He gulped down his drink, and again ordered it to be refilled.</p>

<p>But meanwhile the alcohol was beginning to key him up out of the
dazed and negative state into which his first libations and his
accumulations of fear had plunged him. His brain became a shade
clearer. There was even a faint stirring of the will. He had already
drunk enough under normal circumstances to be simply reeling, but
to-night the emotion of fear inhibited the effects of the alcohol,
keeping him singularly steady. Provided he did not exceed a given
point, he could go on drinking till he reached the moment of high power
when he could combine all his forces into the single consummate act of
cleverly calculated escape. If he missed this psychological moment he
would collapse.</p>

<p>A sudden crash made him jump. It was behind him against the other
wall. In the mirror he saw that a middle-aged man had lost his balance
and fallen off his chair, foolishly intoxicated, and that two women
were ostensibly trying to lift him up, but really were going swiftly
through his pockets as he lay in a heap on the floor. A big man who had
been asleep the whole evening in the corner stopped snoring and woke up
to look and laugh, but no one interfered. A man must take care of
himself in such a place and with such company, or accept the
consequences. The big man composed himself again for sleep, sipping his
glass a little first, and the noise of the room continued as before. It
was a case of "knock-out drops" in the whisky, put in by the women,
however, rather than by the saloon-keeper. Williams remembered thinking
he had nothing to fear of that kind. Hensig's method would be far more
subtle and clever--cherms! A scratch with a pin and a germ!</p>

<p>"I haf zome notes here of my disgovery," he went on, smiling
significantly at the interruption, and taking some papers out of an
inner pocket. "But they are written in Cherman, so I dranslate for you.
You haf paper and benzil?"</p>

<p>The reporter produced the sheaf of office copy paper he always
carried about with him, and prepared to write. The rattle of the
elevated trains outside and the noisy buzz of drunken conversation
inside formed the background against which he heard the German's steely
insistent voice going on ceaselessly with the "dranslation and
egsplanation". From time to time people left the room, and new
customers reeled in. When the clatter of incipient fighting and smashed
glasses became too loud, Hensig waited till it was quiet again. He
watched every new arrival keenly. They were very few now, for the night
had passed into early morning and the room was gradually emptying. The
waiter took snatches of sleep in his chair by the door; the big man
still snored heavily in the angle of the wall and window. When he was
the only one left, the proprietor would certainly close up. He had not
ordered a drink for an hour at least. Williams, however, drank on
steadily, always aiming at the point when he would be at the top of his
power, full of confidence and decision. That moment was undoubtedly
coming nearer all the time. Yes, but so was the moment Hensig was
waiting for. He, too, felt absolutely confident, encouraging his
companion to drink more, and watching his gradual collapse with
unmasked glee. He betrayed his gloating quite plainly now: he held his
victim too securely to feel anxious; when the big man reeled out they
would be alone for a brief minute or two unobserved--and meanwhile he
allowed himself to become a little too careless from over-confidence.
And Williams noted that too.</p>

<p>For slowly the will of the reporter began to assert itself, and with
this increase of intelligence he of course appreciated his awful
position more keenly, and therefore, felt more fear. The two main
things he was waiting for were coming perceptibly within reach: to
reach the saturation point of terror and the culminating moment of the
alcohol. Then, action and escape!</p>

<p>Gradually, thus, as he listened and wrote, he passed from the stage
of stupid, negative terror into that of active, positive terror. The
alcohol kept driving hotly at those hidden centres of imagination
within, which, once touched, begin to reveal: in other words, he became
observant, critical, alert. Swiftly the power grew. His lucidity
increased till he became almost conscious of the workings of the other
man's mind, and it was like sitting opposite a clock whose wheels and
needles he could just hear clicking. His eyes seemed to spread their
power of vision all over his skin; he could see what was going on
without actually looking. In the same way he heard all that passed in
the room without turning his head. Every moment he became clearer in
mind. He almost touched clairvoyance. The presentiment earlier in the
evening that this stage would come was at last being actually
fulfilled.</p>

<p>From time to time he sipped his whisky, but more cautiously than at
first, for he knew that this keen psychical activity was the forerunner
of helpless collapse. Only for a minute or two would he be at the top
of his power. The frontier was a dreadfully narrow one, and already he
had lost control of his fingers, and was scrawling a shorthand that
bore no resemblance to the original system of its inventor.</p>

<p>As the white light of this abnormal perceptiveness increased, the
horror of his position became likewise more and more vivid. He knew
that he was fighting for his life with a soulless and malefic being who
was next door to a devil. The sense of fear was being magnified now
with every minute that passed. Presently the power of perceiving would
pass into doing; he would strike the blow for his life, whatever form
that blow might take.</p>

<p>Already he was sufficiently master of himself to act--to act in the
sense of deceiving. He exaggerated his drunken writing and thickness of
speech, his general condition of collapse: and this power of hearing
the workings of the other man's mind showed him that he was
successful.</p>

<p>Hensig was a little deceived. He proved this by increased
carelessness, and by allowing the expression of his face to become
plainly exultant.</p>

<p>Williams's faculties were so concentrated upon the causes operating
in the terrible personality opposite to him, that he could spare no
part of his brain for the explanations and sentences that came from his
lips. He did not hear or understand a hundredth part of what the doctor
was saving, but occasionally he caught up the end of a phrase and
managed to ask a blundering question out of it; and Hensig, obviously
pleased with his increasing obfuscation, always answered at some
length, quietly watching with pleasure the reporter's foolish
hieroglyphics upon the paper.</p>

<p>The whole thing, of course, was an utter blind. Hensig had no
discovery at all. He was talking scientific jargon, knowing full well
that those shorthand notes would never be transcribed, and that he
himself would be out of harm's way long before his victim's senses had
cleared sufficiently to tell him that he was in the grasp of a deadly
sickness which no medicines could prevent ending in death.</p>

<p>Williams saw and felt all this clearly. It somehow came to him,
rising up in that clear depth of his mind that was stirred by the
alcohol, and yet beyond the reach, so far, of its deadly confusion. He
understood perfectly well that Hensig was waiting for a moment to act;
that he would do nothing violent, but would carry out his murderous
intention in such an innocent way that the victim would have no
suspicions at the moment, and would only realise later that he had been
poisoned and--Hark! What was that? There was a change. Something had
happened. It was like the sound of a gong, and the reporter's fear
suddenly doubled. Hensig's scheme had moved forward a step.</p>

<p>There was no sound actually, but his senses seemed grouped together
into one, and for some reason his perception of the change came by way
of audition. Fear brimmed up perilously near the breaking-point. But
the moment for action had not quite come yet, and he luckily saved
himself by the help of another and contrary emotion. He emptied his
glass, spilling half of it purposely over his coat, and burst out
laughing in Hensig's face. The vivid picture rose before him of Whitey
Fife catching cocktail glasses off the edge of Steve Brodie's
table..The laugh was admirably careless and drunken, but the German was
startled and looked up suspiciously. He had not expected this, and
through lowered eyelids Williams observed an expression of momentary
uncertainty on his features, as though he felt he was not absolutely
master of the situation after all, as he imagined.</p>

<p>"Su'nly thought of Whitey Fife knocking Stevebrodie off'sh Brooklyn
Bridsh in a co-cock'tail glashh--" Williams explained in a voice
hopelessly out of control. "You know Whhhiteyfife, of coursh, don't
you?--ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>Nothing could have helped him more in putting Hensig off the scent.
His face resumed its expression of certainty and cold purpose. The
waiter, wakened by the noise, stirred uneasily in his chair, and the
big man in the corner indulged in a gulp that threatened to choke him
as he sat with his head sunk upon his chest. But otherwise the empty
room became quiet again. The German resumed his confident command of
the situation. Williams, he saw, was drunk enough to bring him easily
into his net.</p>

<p>None the less, the reporter's perception had not been at fault.
There was a change. Hensig was about to do something, and his mind was
buzzing with preparations.</p>

<p>The victim, now within measuring distance of his supreme moment--the
point where terror would release his will, and alcohol would inspire
him beyond possibility of error--saw everything as in the clear light
of day. Small things led him to the climax: the emptied room; the
knowledge that shortly the saloon would close; the grey light of day
stealing under the chinks of door and shutter; the increased vileness
of the face gleaming at him opposite in the paling gas glare. Ugh! how
the air reeked of stale spirits, the fumes of cigar smoke, and the
cheap scents of the vanished women. The floor was strewn with sheets of
paper, absurdly scrawled over. The table had patches of wet, and
cigarette ash lay over everything. His hands and feet were icy, his
eyes burning hot. His heart thumped like a soft hammer.</p>

<p>Hensig was speaking in quite a changed voice now. He had been
leading up to this point for hours. No one was there to see, even if
anything was to be seen--which was unlikely. The big man still snored;
the waiter was asleep too. There was silence in the outer room, and
between the walls of the inner there was--death.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Vulture reporder, I show you what I mean all this time to
egsplain," he was saying in his most metallic voice.</p>

<p>He drew a blank sheet of the reporter's paper towards him across the
little table, avoiding carefully the wet splashes.</p>

<p>"Lend me your bencil von moment, please. Yes?"</p>

<p>Williams, simulating almost total collapse, dropped the pencil and
shoved it over the polished wood as though the movement was about all
he could manage. With his head sunk forward upon his chest he watched
stupidly. Hensig began to draw some kind of outline; his touch was
firm, and there was a smile on his lips.</p>

<p>"Here, you see, is the human arm," he said, sketching rapidly; "and
here are the main nerves, and here the artery. Now, my discovery, as I
haf peen egsplaining to you, is simply--" He dropped into a torrent of
meaningless scientific phrases, during which the other purposely
allowed his hand to lie relaxed upon the table, knowing perfectly well
that in a moment Hensig would seize it--for the purposes of
illustration.</p>

<p>His terror was so intense that, for the first time this awful night,
he was within an ace of action. The point of saturation had been almost
reached. Though apparently sodden drunk, his mind was really at the
highest degree of clear perception and judgment, and in another
moment--the moment Hensig actually began his final assault--the terror
would provide the reporter with the extra vigour and decision necessary
to strike his one blow. Exactly how he would do it, or what precise
form it would take, he had no idea; that could be left to the
inspiration of the moment; he only knew that his strength would last
just long enough to bring this about, and that then he would collapse
in utter intoxication upon the floor. Hensig dropped the pencil
suddenly: it clattered away to a corner of the room, showing it had
been propelled with force, not merely allowed to fall, and he made no
attempt to pick it up. Williams, to test his intention, made a
pretended movement to stoop after it, and the other, as he imagined he
would, stopped him in a second.</p>

<p>"I haf another," he said quickly, diving into his inner pocket and
producing a long dark pencil. Williams saw in a flash, through his
half-closed eyes, that it was sharpened at one end, while the other end
was covered by a little protective cap of transparent substance like
glass, a third of an inch long. He heard it click as it struck a button
of the coat, and also saw that by a very swift motion of the fingers,
impossible to be observed by a drunken man, Hensig removed the cap so
that the end was free. Something gleamed there for a moment, something
like a point of shining metal--the point of a pin.</p>

<p>"Gif me your hand von minute and I drace the nerve up the arm I
speak apout," the doctor continued in that steely voice that showed no
sign of nervousness, though he was on the edge of murder. "So, I show
you much petter vot I mean."</p>

<p>Without a second's hesitation--for the moment for action had not
quite come--he lurched forward and stretched his arm clumsily across
the table. Hensig seized the fingers in his own and turned the palm
uppermost. With his other hand he pointed the pencil at the wrist, and
began moving it a little up towards the elbow, pushing the sleeve back
for the purpose. His touch was the touch of death. On the point of the
black pin, engrafted into the other end of the pencil, Williams knew
there clung the germs of some deadly disease, germs unusually powerful
from special culture; and that within the next few seconds the pencil
would turn and the pin would accidentally scratch his wrist and let the
virulent poison into his blood.</p>

<p>He knew this, yet at the same time he managed to remain master of
himself. For he also realised that at last, just in the nick of time,
the moment he had been waiting for all through these terrible hours had
actually arrived, and he was ready to act.</p>

<p>And the little unimportant detail that furnished the extra quota of
fear necessary to bring him to the point was--touch. It was the touch
of Hensig's hand that did it, setting every nerve a-quiver to its
utmost capacity, filling him with a black horror that reached the
limits of sensation.</p>

<p>In that moment Williams regained his self-control and became
absolutely sober. Terror removed its paralysing inhibitions, having led
him to the point where numbness succeeds upon excess, and sensation
ceases to register in the brain. The emotion of fear was dead, and he
was ready to act with all the force of his being--that force, too,
raised to a higher power after long repression.</p>

<p>Moreover, he could make no mistake, for at the same time he had
reached the culminating effect of the alcohol, and a sort of white
light filled his mind, showing him clearly what to do and how to do it.
He felt master of himself, confident, capable of anything. He followed
blindly that inner guidance he had been dimly conscious of the whole
night, and what he did he did instinctively, as it were, without
deliberate plan.</p>

<p>He was waiting for the pencil to turn so that the pin pointed at his
vein. Then, when Hensig was wholly concentrated upon the act of murder,
and thus oblivious of all else, he would find his opportunity. For at
this supreme moment the German's mind would be focussed on the one
thing. He would notice nothing else round him. He would be open to
successful attack. But this supreme moment would hardly last more than
five seconds at most!</p>

<p>The reporter raised his eyes and stared for the first time steadily
into his opponent's eyes, till the room faded out and he saw only the
white skin in a blaze of its own light. Thus staring, he caught in
himself the full stream of venom, hatred, and revenge that had been
pouring at him across the table for so long--caught and held it for one
instant, and then returned it into the other's brain with all its
original force and the added impetus of his own recovered will behind
it.</p>

<p>Hensig felt this, and for a moment seemed to waver; he was surprised
out of himself by the sudden change in his victim's attitude. The same
instant, availing himself of a diversion caused by the big man in the
corner waking noisily and trying to rise, he slowly turned the pencil
round so that the point of the pin was directed at the hand lying in
his. The sleepy waiter was helping the drunken man to cross to the
door, and the diversion was all in his favour.</p>

<p>But Williams knew what he was doing. He did not even tremble.</p>

<p>"When that pin scratches me," he said aloud in a firm, sober voice,
"it means--death."</p>

<p>The German could not conceal his surprise on hearing the change of
voice, but he still felt sure of his victim, and clearly wished to
enjoy his revenge thoroughly. After a moment's hesitation he replied,
speaking very low:</p>

<p>"You tried, I tink, to get me conficted, and now I punish you, dat
is all."</p>

<p>His fingers moved, and the point of the pin descended a little
lower. Williams felt the faintest imaginable prick on his skin--or
thought he did. The German had lowered his head again to direct the
movement of the pin properly. But the moment of Hensig's concentration
was also the moment of his own attack. And it had come.</p>

<p>"But the alcohol will counteract it!" he burst out, with a loud and
startling laugh that threw the other completely off his guard. The
doctor lifted his face in amazement. That same instant the hand that
lay so helplessly and tipsily in his turned like a flash of lightning,
and, before he knew what had happened, their positions were reversed.
Williams held his wrist, pencil and all, in a grasp of iron. And from
the reporter's other hand the German received a terrific smashing blow
in the face that broke his glasses and dashed him back with a howl of
pain against the wall.</p>

<p>There was a brief passage of scramble and wild blows, during which
both table and chairs were sent flying, and then Williams was aware
that a figure behind him had stretched forth an arm and was holding a
bright silvery thing close to Hensig's bleeding face. Another glance
showed him that it was a pistol, and that the man holding it was the
big drunken man who had apparently slept all night in the corner of the
room. Then, in a flash, he recognised him as Dowling's partner--a
headquarters detective.</p>

<p>The reporter stepped back, his head swimming again. He was very
unsteady on his feet.</p>

<p>"I've been watching your game all the evening," he heard the
headquarters man saying as he slipped the handcuffs over the German's
unresisting wrists. "We have been on your trail for weeks, and I might
jest as soon have taken you when you left the Brooklyn church a few
hours ago, only I wanted to see what you were up to--see? You're wanted
in Berlin for one or two little dirty tricks, but our advices only came
last night. Come along now."</p>

<p>"You'll get nozzing," Hensig replied very quietly, wiping his bloody
face with the corner of his sleeve. "See, I have scratched myself!"</p>

<p>The detective took no notice of this remark, not understanding it,
probably, but Williams noticed the direction of the eyes, and saw a
scratch on his wrist, slightly bleeding. Then he understood that in the
struggle the pin had accidentally found another destination than the
one intended for it.</p>

<p>But he remembered nothing more after that, for the reaction set in
with a rush. The strain of that awful night left him utterly limp, and
the accumulated effect of the alcohol, now that all was past,
overwhelmed him like a wave, and he sank in a heap upon the floor,
unconscious.</p>

<p>* * * The illness that followed was simply "nerves", and he got over
it in a week or two, and returned to his work on the paper. He at once
made inquiries, and found that Hensig's arrest had hardly been noticed
by the papers. There was no interesting feature about it, and New York
was already in the throes of a new horror.</p>

<p>But Dowling, that enterprising Irishman--always with an eye to
promotion and the main chance--Dowling had something to say about
it.</p>

<p>"No luck, Mr. English," he said ruefully, "no luck at all. It would
have been a mighty good story, but it never got in the papers. That
damned German, Schmidt, alias Brunner, alias Hensig, died in the prison
hospital before we could even get him remanded for further
inquiries--"</p>

<p>"What did he die of?" interrupted the reporter quickly.</p>

<p>"Black typhus. I think they call it. But it was terribly swift, and
he was dead in four days. The doctor said he'd never known such a
case."</p>

<p>"I'm glad he's out of the way," observed Williams.</p>

<p>"Well, yes," Dowling said hesitatingly; "but it was a jim dandy of a
story, an' he might have waited a little bit longer jest so as I got
something out of it for meself."</p>

<h2><a name="ch12"></a>The Occupant of the Room</h2>

<p>He arrived late at night by the yellow diligence, stiff and cramped
after the toilsome ascent of three slow hours. The village, a single
mass of shadow, was already asleep. Only in front of the little hotel
was there noise and light and bustle--for a moment. The horses, with
tired, slouching gait, crossed the road and disappeared into the stable
of their own accord, their harness trailing in the dust; and the
lumbering diligence stood for the night where they had dragged it--the
body of a great yellow-sided beetle with broken legs.</p>

<p>In spite of his physical weariness, the schoolmaster, revelling in
the first hours of his ten-guinea holiday, felt exhilarated. For the
high Alpine valley was marvellously still; stars twinkled over the torn
ridges of the Dent du Midi where spectral snows gleamed against rocks
that looked like ebony; and the keen air smelt of pine forests,
dew-soaked pastures, and freshly sawn wood.</p>

<p>He took it all in with a kind of bewildered delight for a few
minutes, while the other three passengers gave directions about their
luggage and went to their rooms. Then he turned and walked over the
coarse matting into the glare of the hall, only just able to resist
stopping to examine the big mountain map that hung upon the wall by the
door.</p>

<p>And, with a sudden disagreeable shock, he came down from the ideal
to the actual. For at the inn--the only inn--there was no vacant room.
Even the available sofas were occupied.</p>

<p>How stupid he had been not to write! Yet it had been impossible, he
remembered, for he had come to the decision suddenly that morning in
Geneva, enticed by the brilliance of the weather after a week of
rain.</p>

<p>They talked endlessly, this gold-braided porter and the hard-faced
old woman--her face was hard, he noticed--gesticulating all the time,
and pointing all about the village with suggestions that he ill
understood, for his French was limited and their patois was
fearful.</p>

<p>'There!'--he might find a room, 'or there! But we are, h&eacute;las
full--more full than we care about. To-morrow, perhaps-if So-and-So
give up their rooms--!' And then, with much shrugging of shoulders, the
hard-faced old woman stared at the gold-braided porter, and the porter
stared sleepily at the school-master.</p>

<p>At length, however, by some process of hope he did not himself
understand, and following directions given by the old woman that were
utterly unintelligible, he went out into the street and walked towards
a dark group of houses she had pointed out to him. He only knew that he
meant to thunder at a door and ask for a room. He was too weary to
think out details. The porter half made to go with him, but turned back
at the last moment to speak with the old woman. The houses sketched
themselves dimly in the general blackness. The air was cold. The whole
valley was filled with the rush and thunder of falling water. He was
thinking vaguely that the dawn could not be very far away, and that he
might even spend the night wandering in the woods, when there was a
sharp noise behind him and he turned to see a figure hurrying after
him. It was the porter--running.</p>

<p>And in the little hall of the inn there began again a confused
three-cornered conversation, with frequent muttered colloquy and
whispered asides in patois between the woman and the porter--the net
result of which was that, 'If Monsieur did not object--there was a
room, after all, on the first floor--only it was in a sense "engaged".
That is to say--' But the school-master took the room without inquiring
too closely into the puzzle that had somehow provided it so suddenly.
The ethics of hotel-keeping had nothing to do with him. If the woman
offered him quarters it was not for him to argue with her whether the
said quarters were legitimately hers to offer.</p>

<p>But the porter, evidently a little thrilled, accompanied the guest
up to the room and supplied in a mixture of French and English details
omitted by the landlady--and Minturn, the schoolmaster, soon shared the
thrill with him, and found himself in the atmosphere of a possible
tragedy.</p>

<p>All who know the peculiar excitement that belongs to lofty mountain
valleys where dangerous climbing is a chief feature of the attractions,
will understand a certain faint element of high alarm that goes with
the picture. One looks up at the desolate, soaring ridges and thinks
involuntarily of the men who find their pleasure for days and nights
together scaling perilous summits among the clouds, and conquering inch
by inch the icy peaks that for ever shake their dark terror in the
sky.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of adventure, spiced with the possible horror of a
very grim order of tragedy, is inseparable from any imaginative
contemplation of the scene: and the idea Minturn gleaned from the
half-frightened porter lost nothing by his ignorance of the language.
This Englishwoman, the real occupant of the room, had insisted on going
without a guide. She had left just before daybreak two days before--the
porter had seen her start--and...she had not returned! The route was
difficult and dangerous, yet not impossible for a skilled climber, even
a solitary one.</p>

<p>And the Englishwoman was an experienced mountaineer. Also, she was
self-willed, careless of advice, bored by warnings, self-confident to a
degree. Queer, moreover; for she kept entirely to herself, and
sometimes remained in her room with locked doors, admitting no one, for
days together; a 'crank,' evidently, of the first water.</p>

<p>This much Minturn gathered clearly enough from the porter's talk
while his luggage was brought in and the room set to rights; further,
too, that the search party had gone out and might, of course, return at
any moment. In which case--. Thus the room was empty, yet still hers.
'If Monsieur did not object--if the risk he ran of having to turn out
suddenly in the night--' It was the loquacious porter who furnished the
details that made the transaction questionable; and Minturn dismissed
the loquacious porter as soon as possible, and prepared to get into the
hastily arranged bed and snatch all the hours of sleep he could before
he was turned out.</p>

<p>At first, it must be admitted, he felt uncomfortable--distinctly
uncomfortable. He was in some one else's room. He had really no right
to be there. It was in the nature of an unwarrantable intrusion; and
while he unpacked he kept looking over shoulder as though some one were
watching him from corners. Any moment, it seemed, he would hear a step
in the passage, a knock would come at the door, the door would open and
there he would see this vigorous Englishwoman looking him up and down
with anger. Worse still--he would hear her voice asking him what he was
doing in her room--her bedroom. Of course, he had an adequate
explanation, but still--!</p>

<p>Then, reflecting that he was already half undressed, the humour of
it flashed for a second across his mind, and he laughed--quietly. And
at once, after that laughter, under his breath, came the sudden sense
of tragedy he had felt before. Perhaps, even while he smiled, her body
lay broken and cold upon those awful heights, the wind of snow playing
over her hair, her glazed eyes staring sightless up to the stars...It
made him shudder. The sense of this woman whom he had never seen, whose
name even he did not know, became extraordinarily real. Almost he could
imagine that she was somewhere in the room with him, hidden, observing
all he did.</p>

<p>He opened the door softly to put his boots outside, and when he
closed it again he turned the key. Then he finished unpacking and
distributed his few things about the room. It was soon done, for, in
the first place, he had only a small Gladstone and a knapsack, and
secondly, the only place where he could spread his clothes was the
sofa. There was no chest of drawers, and the cupboard, an unusually
large and solid one, was locked. The Englishwoman's things had
evidently been hastily put away in it. The only sign of her recent
presence was a bunch of faded Alpenrosen standing in a glass jar upon
the wash-hand-stand. This, and a certain faint perfume, were all that
remained. In spite, however, of these very slight evidences, the whole
room was pervaded with a curious sense of occupancy that he found
exceedingly distasteful. One moment the atmosphere seemed subtly
charged with a 'just left' feeling; the next it was a queer awareness
of 'still here' that made him turn and look hurriedly behind him.</p>

<p>Altogether, the room inspired him with a singular aversion, and the
strength of this aversion seemed the only excuse for his tossing the
faded flowers out of the window, and then hanging his mackintosh upon
the cupboard door in such a way as to screen it as much as possible
from view.</p>

<p>For the sight of that big, ugly cupboard, filled with the clothing
of a woman who might then be beyond any further need of covering--thus
his imagination insisted on picturing it--touched in him a startled
sense of the incongruous that did not stop there, but crept through his
mind gradually till it merged somehow into a sense of a rather
grotesque horror. At any rate, the sight of that cupboard was
offensive, and he covered it almost instinctively. Then, turning out
the electric light, he got into bed.</p>

<p>But the instant the room was dark he realised that it was more than
he could stand; for, with the blackness, there came a sudden rush of
cold that he found it hard to explain. And the odd thing was that, when
he lit the candle beside his bed, he noticed that his hand
trembled.</p>

<p>This, of course, was too much. His imagination was taking liberties
and must be called to heel.</p>

<p>Yet the way he called it to order was significant, and its very
deliberateness betrayed a mind that has already admitted fear. And
fear, once in, is difficult to dislodge. He lay there upon his elbow in
bed and carefully took note of all the objects in the room--with the
intention, as it were, of taking an inventory of everything his senses
perceived, then drawing a line, adding them up finally, and saying with
decision, 'That's all the room contains! I've counted every single
thing.</p>

<p>There is nothing more. Now--I may sleep in peace!'</p>

<p>And it was during this absurd process of enumerating the furniture
of the room that the dreadful sense of distressing lassitude came over
him that made it difficult even to finish counting. It came swiftly,
yet with an amazing kind of violence that overwhelmed him softly and
easily with a sensation of enervating weariness hard to describe. And
its first effect was to banish fear. He no longer possessed enough
energy to feel really afraid or nervous. The cold remained, but the
alarm vanished. And into every corner of his usually vigorous
personality crept the insidious poison of a muscular fatigue--at
first--that in a few seconds, it seemed, translated itself into
spiritual inertia. A sudden consciousness of the foolishness, the crass
futility of life, of effort, of fighting--of all that makes life worth
living, oozed into every fibre of his being, and left him utterly weak.
A spit of black pessimism, that was not even vigorous enough to assert
itself, invaded the secret chambers of his heart...</p>

<p>Every picture that presented itself to his mind came dressed grey
shadows; those bored and sweating horses toiling up the ascent
to--nothing! That hard-faced landlady taking so much trouble to let her
desire for gain conquer her sense of morality--for a few francs! That
gold-braided porter, so talkative, fussy, energetic, and so anxious to
tell all he knew! What was the use of them all? And for himself, what
in the world was the good of all the labour and drudgery he went
through in that preparatory school where he was junior master? What
could it lead to?</p>

<p>Wherein lay the value of so much uncertain toil, when the ultimate
secrets of life were hidden, and no one knew the final goal? How
foolish was effort, discipline, work! How vain was pleasure! How
trivial the noblest life!...</p>

<p>With a jump that nearly upset the candle Minturn challenge this weak
mood. Such vicious thoughts were usually so remote from his normal
character that the sudden vile invasion produced a swift reaction. Yet,
only for a moment. Instantly, again, the depression descended upon him
like a wave. His work--it could lead to nothing but the dreary labour
of a small headmastership after all--seemed as vain and foolish as his
holiday in the Alps. What an idiot he had been, to be sure, to come out
with a knapsack merely to work himself into a state of exhaustion
climbing over toilsome mountains that led to nowhere--resulted in
nothing. A dreariness of the grave possessed him. Life was a ghastly
fraud! Religion a childish humbug!</p>

<p>Everything was merely a trap--a trap of death; a coloured toy that
Nature used as a decoy! But a decoy for what? For nothing! There was no
meaning in anything. The only real thing was--DEATH. And the happiest
people were those who found it soonest.</p>

<p>Then why wait for it to come?</p>

<p>He sprang out of bed, thoroughly frightened. This was horrible.
Surely mere physical fatigue could not produce a world a black, an
outlook so dismal, a cowardice that struck with rich sudden
hopelessness at the very roots of life? For, normally, he was cheerful
and strong, full of the tides of healthy living; and this appalling
lassitude swept the very basis of his personality into nothingness and
the desire for death. It was like the development of a Secondary
Personality. He had read, of course, how certain persons who suffered
shocks developed thereafter entirely different characteristics, memory,
tastes, and so forth. It had all rather frightened him. Though
scientific men vouched for it, it was hardly to be believed. Yet here
was similar thing taking place in his own consciousness. He was, beyond
question, experiencing all the mental variations of--someone else! It
was un-moral. It was awful. It was--well, after all, at the same time,
it was uncommonly interesting.</p>

<p>And this interest he began to feel was the first sign of his
returned normal Self. For to feel interest is to live, and to love
life.</p>

<p>He sprang into the middle of the room--then switched on the electric
light. And the first thing that struck his eye was--the big
cupboard.</p>

<p>'Hallo! There's that--beastly cupboard!' he exclaimed to himself,
involuntarily, yet aloud. It held all the clothes, the winging skirts
and coats and summer blouses of the dead woman. For he knew
now--somehow or other--that she was dead...</p>

<p>At that moment, through the open windows, rushed the sound of
falling water, bringing with it a vivid realisation of the desolate,
snow-swept heights. He saw her--positively saw her!--lying where she
had fallen, the frost upon her cheeks, the snow-dust eddying about her
hair and eyes, her broken limbs pushing against the lumps of ice. For a
moment the sense of spiritual lassitude--of the emptiness of
life--vanished before this picture of broken effort--of a small human
force battling pluckily, yet in vain, against the impersonal and
pitiless potencies of inanimate nature--and he found himself again his
normal self. Then instantly, returned again that terrible sense of
cold, nothingness, emptiness...</p>

<p>And he found himself standing opposite the big cupboard where her
clothes were. He suddenly wanted to see those clothes--things she had
used and worn. Quite close he stood, almost touching it. The next
second he had touched it. His knuckles struck upon the wood.</p>

<p>Why he knocked is hard to say. It was an instinctive movement
probably. Something in his deepest self dictated it--ordered it. He
knocked at the door. And the dull sound upon the wood into the
stillness of that room brought--horror. Why it should have done so he
found it as hard to explain to himself as why he should have felt
impelled to knock. The fact remains that when he heard the faint
reverberation inside the cupboard, it brought with it so vivid a
realisation of the woman's presence that he stood there shivering upon
the floor with a dreadful sense of anticipation; he almost expected to
hear an answering knock from within--the rustling of the hanging skirts
perhaps--or, worse still, to see the locked door slowly open towards
him.</p>

<p>And from that moment, he declares that in some way or other he must
have partially lost control of himself, or at least of his better
judgment; for he became possessed by such an over-mastering desire to
tear open that cupboard door and see the clothes within, that he tried
every key in the room in the vain effort to unlock it, and then,
finally, before he quite realised what he was doing--rang the bell!</p>

<p>But, having rung the bell for no obvious or intelligent reason at
two o'clock in the morning, he then stood waiting in the middle of the
floor for the servant to come, conscious for the first time that
something outside his ordinary self had pushed him towards the act. It
was almost like an internal voice that directed him...and thus, when at
last steps came down the passage and he faced the cross and sleepy
chambermaid, amazed at being summoned at such an hour, he found no
difficulty in the matter of what he should say. For the same power that
insisted he should open the cupboard door also impelled him to utter
words over which he apparently had no control.</p>

<p>'It's not you I rang for!' he said with decision and impatience. 'I
want a man. Wake the porter and send him up to me at once--hurry! I
tell you, hurry--!'</p>

<p>And when the girl had gone, frightened at his earnestness, Minturn
realised that the words surprised himself as much as they surprised
her. Until they were out of his mouth he had not known what exactly he
was saying. But now he understood that some force, foreign to his own
personality, was using his mind and organs. The black depression that
had possessed him a few moments before was also part of it. The
powerful mood of this vanished woman had somehow momentarily taken
possession of him--communicated, possibly, by the atmosphere of things
in the room still belonging to her. But even now, when the porter,
without coat or collar, stood beside him in the room, he did not
understand why he insisted, with a positive fury admitting no denial,
that the key of that cupboard must be found and the door instantly
opened.</p>

<p>The scene was a curious one. After some perplexed whispering with
the chambermaid at the end of the passage, the porter managed to find
and produce the key in question. Neither he nor the girl knew clearly
what this excited Englishman was up to, or why he was so passionately
intent upon opening the cupboard at two o'clock in the morning. They
watched him with an air of wondering what was going to happen next. But
something of his curious earnestness, even of his late fear,
communicated itself to them, and the sound of the key grating in lock
made them both jump.</p>

<p>They held their breath as the creaking door swung slowly open. All
heard the clatter of that other key as it fell against the wooden
floor--within. The cupboard had been locked from the inside. But it was
the scared housemaid, from her position in the corridor, who first
saw--and with a wild scream fell crashing against the banisters.</p>

<p>The porter made no attempt to save her. The schoolmaster and himself
made a simultaneous rush towards the door, now wide open. They, too,
had seen.</p>

<p>There were no clothes, skirts or blouses on the pegs, but they saw
the body of the Englishwoman suspended in mid-air, the head bent
forward. Jarred by the movement of unlocking, the body swung slowly
round to face them...Pinned upon the inside of the door was a hotel
envelope with the following words pencilled in straggling writing:
'Tired--unhappy--hopelessly depressed...I cannot face life any
longer...All is black. I must put an end to it...I meant to do it on
the mountains, but was afraid. I slipped back to my room unobserved.
This way is easiest and best...'</p>

<h2><a name="ch13"></a>The Other Wing</h2>

<p>It used to puzzle him that, after dark, some one would look in round
the edge of the bedroom door, and withdraw again too rapidly for him to
see the face. When the nurse had gone away with the candle this
happened: "Good night, Master Tim," she said usually, shading the light
with one hand to protect his eyes; "dream of me and I'll dream of you."
She went out slowly.</p>

<p>The sharp-edged shadow of the door ran across the ceiling like a
train. There came a whispered colloquy in the corridor outside, about
himself, of course, and--he was alone. He heard her steps going deeper
and deeper into the bosom of the old country house; they were audible
for a moment on the stone flooring of the hall; and sometimes the dull
thump of the baize door into the servants' quarters just reached him,
too--then silence. But it was only when the last sound, as well as the
last sign of her had vanished, that the face emerged from its
hiding-place and flashed in upon him round the corner. As a rule, too,
it came just as he was saying, "Now I'll go to sleep. I won't think any
longer. Good night, Master Tim, and happy dreams." He loved to say this
to himself; it brought a sense of companionship, as though there were
two persons speaking.</p>

<p>The room was on the top of the old house, a big, high-ceilinged
room, and his bed against the wall had an iron railing round it; he
felt very safe and protected in it. The curtains at the other end of
the room were drawn. He lay watching the firelight dancing on the heavy
folds, and their pattern, showing a spaniel chasing a long-tailed bird
towards a bushy tree, interested and amused him. It was repeated over
and over again. He counted the number of dogs, and the number of birds,
and the number of trees, but could never make them agree. There was a
plan somewhere in that pattern; if only he could discover it, the dogs
and birds and trees would "come out right."</p>

<p>Hundreds and hundreds of times he had played this game, for the plan
in the pattern made it possible to take sides, and the bird and dog
were against him. They always won, however; Tim usually fell asleep
just when the advantage was on his own side. The curtains hung steadily
enough most of the time, but it seemed to him once or twice that they
stirred--hiding a dog or bird on purpose to prevent his winning. For
instance, he had eleven birds and eleven trees, and, fixing them in his
mind by saying, "that's eleven birds and eleven trees, but only ten
dogs," his eyes darted back to find the eleventh dog, when--the curtain
moved and threw all his calculations into confusion again. The eleventh
dog was hidden. He did not quite like the movement; it gave him
questionable feelings, rather, for the curtain did not move of itself.
Yet, usually, he was too intent upon counting the dogs to feel positive
alarm.</p>

<p>Opposite to him was the fireplace, full of red and yellow coals;
and, lying with his head sideways on the pillow, he could see directly
in between the bars. When the coals settled with a soft and powdery
crash, he turned his eyes from the curtains to the grate, trying to
discover exactly which bits had fallen. So long as the glow was there
the sound seemed pleasant enough, but sometimes he awoke later in the
night, the room huge with darkness, the fire almost out--and the sound
was not so pleasant then. It startled him. The coals did not fall of
themselves. It seemed that some one poked them cautiously. The shadows
were very thick before the bars. As with the curtains, moreover, the
morning aspect of the extinguished fire, the ice-cold cinders that made
a clinking sound like tin, caused no emotion whatever in his soul.</p>

<p>And it was usually while he lay waiting for sleep, tired both of the
curtain and the coal games, on the point, indeed, of saying, "I'll go
to sleep now," that the puzzling thing took place.</p>

<p>He would be staring drowsily at the dying fire, perhaps counting the
stockings and flannel garments that hung along the high fender-rail
when, suddenly, a person looked in with lightning swiftness through the
door and vanished again before he could possibly turn his head to see.
The appearance and disappearance were accomplished with amazing
rapidity always.</p>

<p>It was a head and shoulders that looked in, and the movement
combined the speed, the lightness and the silence of a shadow. Only it
was not a shadow. A hand held the edge of the door. The face shot
round, saw him, and withdrew like lightning. It was utterly beyond him
to imagine anything more quick and clever. It darted. He heard no
sound. It went. But--it had seen him, looked him all over, examined
him, noted what he was doing with that lightning glance. It wanted to
know if he were awake still, or asleep. And though it went off, it
still watched him from a distance; it waited somewhere; it knew all
about him. Where it waited no one could ever guess. It came probably,
he felt, from beyond the house, possibly from the roof, but most likely
from the garden or the sky. Yet, though strange, it was not terrible.
It was a kindly and protective figure, he felt. And when it happened he
never called for help, because the occurrence simply took his voice
away.</p>

<p>"It comes from the Nightmare Passage," he decided; "but it's not a
nightmare." It puzzled him.</p>

<p>Sometimes, moreover, it came more than once in a single night. He
was pretty sure--not quite positive--that it occupied his room as soon
as he was properly asleep. It took possession, sitting perhaps before
the dying fire, standing upright behind the heavy curtains, or even
lying down in the empty bed his brother used when he was home from
school. Perhaps it played the curtain game, perhaps it poked the coals;
it knew, at any rate, where the eleventh dog had lain concealed. It
certainly came in and out; certainly, too, it did not wish to be seen.
For, more than once, on waking suddenly in the midnight blackness, Tim
knew it was standing close beside his bed and bending over him. He
felt, rather than heard, its presence. It glided quietly away. It moved
with marvellous softness, yet he was positive it moved. He felt the
difference, so to speak. It had been near him, now it was gone. It came
back, too--just as he was falling into sleep again. Its midnight coming
and going, however, stood out sharply different from its first shy,
tentative approach. For in the firelight it came alone; whereas in the
black and silent hours, it had with it--others.</p>

<p>And it was then he made up his mind that its swift and quiet
movements were due to the fact that it had wings. It flew. And the
others that came with it in the darkness were "its little ones."</p>

<p>He also made up his mind that all were friendly, comforting,
protective, and that while positively not a Nightmare, it yet came
somehow along the Nightmare Passage before it reached him. "You see,
it's like this," he explained to the nurse: "The big one comes to visit
me alone, but it only brings its little ones when I'm quite
asleep."</p>

<p>"Then the quicker you get to sleep the better, isn't it, Master
Tim?"</p>

<p>He replied: "Rather! I always do. Only I wonder where they come
from!" He spoke, however, as though he had an inkling.</p>

<p>But the nurse was so dull about it that he gave her up and tried his
father. "Of course, replied this busy but affectionate parent, "it's
either nobody at all, or else it's Sleep coming to carry you away to
the land of dreams." He made the statement kindly but somewhat briskly,
for he was worried just then about the extra taxes on his land, and the
effort to fix his mind on Tim's fanciful world was beyond him at the
moment. He lifted the boy on to his knee, kissed and patted him as
though he were a favourite dog, and planted him on the rug again with a
flying sweep.</p>

<p>"Run and ask your mother," he added; "she knows all that kind of
thing. Then come back and tell me all about it--another time."</p>

<p>Tim found his mother in an arm-chair before the fire of another
room; she was knitting and reading at the same time--a wonderful thing
the boy could never understand. She raised her head as he came in,
pushed her glasses on to her forehead, and held her arms out. He told
her everything, ending up with what his father said.</p>

<p>"You see, it's not Jackman, or Thompson, or any one like that," he
exclaimed. "It's some one real."</p>

<p>"But nice," she assured him, "some one who comes to take care of you
and see that you're all safe and cosy."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I know that. But--"</p>

<p>"I think your father's right," she added quickly. "It's Sleep, I'm
sure, who pops in round the door like that. Sleep has got wings, I've
always heard."</p>

<p>"Then the other thing--the little ones?" he asked. "Are they just
sorts of dozes, you think?"</p>

<p>Mother did not answer for a moment. She turned down the page of her
book, closed it slowly, put it on the table beside her. More slowly
still she put her knitting away, arranging the wool and needles with
some deliberation.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she said, drawing the boy closer to her and looking into
his big eyes of wonder, "they're dreams!"</p>

<p>Tim felt a thrill run through him as she said it. He stepped back a
foot or so and clapped his hands softly. "Dreams!" he whispered with
enthusiasm and belief; "of course! I never thought of that."</p>

<p>His mother, having proved her sagacity, then made a mistake. She
noted her success, but instead of leaving it there, she elaborated and
explained. As Tim expressed it she "went on about it." Therefore he did
not listen. He followed his train of thought alone. And presently, he
interrupted her long sentences with a conclusion of his own:</p>

<p>"Then I know where She hides," he announced with a touch of awe.
"Where She lives, I mean." And without waiting to be asked, he imparted
the information: "It's in the Other Wing."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said his mother, taken by surprise. "How clever of you,
Tim!"--and thus confirmed it.</p>

<p>Thenceforward this was established in his life--that Sleep and her
attendant Dreams hid during the daytime in that unused portion of the
great Elizabethan mansion called the Other Wing. This other wing was
unoccupied, its corridors untrodden, its windows shuttered and its
rooms all closed. At various places green baize doors led into it, but
no one ever opened them.</p>

<p>For many years this part had been shut up; and for the children,
properly speaking, it was out of bounds. They never mentioned it as a
possible place, at any rate; in hide-and-seek it was not considered,
even; there was a hint of the inaccessible about the Other Wing.
Shadows, dust, and silence had it to themselves.</p>

<p>But Tim, having ideas of his own about everything, possessed special
information about the Other Wing. He believed it was inhabited. Who
occupied the immense series of empty rooms, who trod the spacious
corridors, who passed to and fro behind the shuttered windows, he had
not known exactly. He had called these occupants "they," and the most
important among them was "The Ruler." The Ruler of the Other Wing was a
kind of deity, powerful, far away, ever present yet never seen.</p>

<p>And about this Ruler he had a wonderful conception for a little boy;
he connected her, somehow, with deep thoughts of his own, the deepest
of all. When he made up adventures to the moon, to the stars, or to the
bottom of the sea, adventures that he lived inside himself as it
were--to reach them he must invariably pass through the chambers of the
Other Wing. Those corridors and halls, the Nightmare Passage among
them, lay along the route; they were the first stage of the journey.
Once the green baize doors swung to behind him and the long dim passage
stretched ahead, he was well on his way into the adventure of the
moment; the Nightmare Passage once passed, he was safe from capture;
but once the shutters of a window had been flung open, he was free of
the gigantic world that lay beyond. For then light poured in and he
could see his way.</p>

<p>The conception, for a child, was curious. It established a
correspondence between the mysterious chambers of the Other Wing and
the occupied, but unguessed chambers of his Inner Being. Through these
chambers, through these darkened corridors, along a passage, sometimes
dangerous, or at least of questionable repute, he must pass to find all
adventures that were real.</p>

<p>The light--when he pierced far enough to take the shutters down--was
discovery. Tim did not actually think, much less say, all this. He was
aware of it, however. He felt it. The Other Wing was inside himself as
well as through the green baize doors. His inner man of wonder included
both of them.</p>

<p>But now, for the first time in his life, he knew who lived there and
who the Ruler was. A shutter had fallen of its own accord; light poured
in; he made a guess, and Mother had confirmed it. Sleep and her Little
Ones, the host of dreams, were the daylight occupants. They stole out
when the darkness fell. All adventures in life began and ended by a
dream--discoverable by first passing through the Other Wing.</p>

<p>And, having settled this, his one desire now was to travel over the
map upon journeys of exploration and discovery. The map inside himself
he knew already, but the map of the Other Wing he had not seen. His
mind knew it, he had a clear mental picture of rooms and halls and
passages, but his feet had never trod the silent floors where dust and
shadows hid the flock of dreams by day. The mighty chambers where Sleep
ruled he longed to stand in, to see the Ruler face to face. He made up
his mind to get into the Other Wing.</p>

<p>To accomplish this was difficult; but Tim was a determined
youngster, and he meant to try; he meant, also, to succeed. He
deliberated. At night he could not possibly manage it; in any case, the
Ruler and her host all left it after dark, to fly about the world; the
Wing would be empty, and the emptiness would frighten him. Therefore he
must make a daylight visit; and it was a daylight visit he decided on.
He deliberated more. There were rules and risks involved: it meant
going out of bounds, the danger of being seen, the certainty of being
questioned by some idle and inquisitive grown-up: "Where in the world
have you been all this time"--and so forth. These things he thought out
carefully, and though he arrived at no solution, he felt satisfied that
it would be all right. That is, he recognised the risks. To be prepared
was half the battle, for nothing then could take him by surprise.</p>

<p>The notion that he might slip in from the garden was soon abandoned;
the red bricks showed no openings; there was no door; from the
courtyard, also, entrance was impracticable; even on tiptoe he could
barely reach the broad window-sills of stone. When playing alone, or
walking with the French governess, he examined every outside
possibility. None offered. The shutters, supposing he could reach them,
were thick and solid.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, when opportunity offered, he stood against the outside
walls and listened, his ear pressed against the tight red bricks; the
towers and gables of the Wing rose overhead; he heard the wind go
whispering along the eaves; he imagined tiptoe movements and a sound of
wings inside. Sleep and her Little Ones were busily preparing for their
journeys after dark; they hid, but they did not sleep; in this unused
Wing, vaster alone than any other country house he had ever seen, Sleep
taught and trained her flock of feathered Dreams. It was very
wonderful. They probably supplied the entire county. But more wonderful
still was the thought that the Ruler herself should take the trouble to
come to his particular room and personally watch over him all night
long. That was amazing. And it flashed across his imaginative,
inquiring mind: "Perhaps they take me with them! The moment I'm asleep!
That's why she comes to see me!"</p>

<p>Yet his chief preoccupation was, how Sleep got out. Through the
green baize doors, of course! By a process of elimination he arrived at
a conclusion: he, too, must enter through a green baize door and risk
detection.</p>

<p>Of late, the lightning visits had ceased. The silent, darting figure
had not peeped in and vanished as it used to do. He fell asleep too
quickly now, almost before Jackman reached the hall, and long before
the fire began to die. Also, the dogs and birds upon the curtains
always matched the trees exactly, and he won the curtain game quite
easily; there was never a dog or bird too many the curtain never
stirred. It had been thus ever since his talk with Mother and Father.
And so he came to make a second discovery: His parents did not really
believe in his Figure. She kept away on that account. They doubted her;
she hid. Here was still another incentive to go and find her out. He
ached for her, she was so kind, she gave herself so much trouble--just
for his little self in the big and lonely bedroom. Yet his parents
spoke of her as though she were of no account. He longed to see her,
face to face, and tell her that he believed in her and loved her. For
he was positive she would like to hear it. She cared. Though he had
fallen asleep of late too quickly for him to see her flash in at the
door, he had known nicer dreams than ever in his life before-travelling
dreams. And it was she who sent them. More--he was sure she took him
out with her.</p>

<p>One evening, in the dusk of a March day, his opportunity came; and
only just in time, for his brother Jack was expected home from school
on the morrow, and with Jack in the other bed, no Figure would ever
care to show itself. Also it was Easter, and after Easter, though Tim
was not aware of it at the time, he was to say good-bye finally to
governesses and become a day-boarder at a preparatory school for
Wellington. The opportunity offered itself so naturally, moreover, that
Tim took it without hesitation. It never occurred to him to question,
much less to refuse it. The thing was obviously meant to be. For he
found himself unexpectedly in front of a green baize door; and the
green baize door was--swinging! Somebody, therefore, had just passed
through it.</p>

<p>It had come about in this wise. Father, away in Scotland, at
Inglemuir, the shooting place, was expected back next morning; Mother
had driven over to the church upon some Easter business or other; and
the governess had been allowed her holiday at home in France. Tim,
therefore, had the run of the house, and in the hour between tea and
bed-time he made good use of it. Fully able to defy such second-rate
obstacles as nurses and butlers, he explored all manner of forbidden
places with ardent thoroughness, arriving finally in the sacred
precincts of his father's study. This wonderful room was the very heart
and centre of the whole big house; he had been birched here long ago;
here, too, his father had told him with a grave yet smiling face:</p>

<p>"You've got a new companion, Tim, a little sister; you must be very
kind to her." Also, it was the place where all the money was kept. What
he called "father's jolly smell" was strong in it--papers, tobacco,
books, flavoured by hunting crops and gunpowder.</p>

<p>At first he felt awed, standing motionless just inside the door; but
presently, recovering equilibrium, he moved cautiously on tiptoe
towards the gigantic desk where important papers were piled in untidy
patches. These he did not touch; but beside them his quick eye noted
the jagged piece of iron shell his father brought home from his Crimean
campaign and now used as a letter-weight. It was difficult to lift,
however. He climbed into the comfortable chair and swung round and
round. It was a swivel-chair, and he sank down among the cushions in
it, staring at the strange things on the great desk before him, as if
fascinated. Next he turned away and saw the stick-rack in the
corner--this, he knew, he was allowed to touch. He had played with
these sticks before. There were twenty, perhaps, all told, with curious
carved handles, brought from every corner of the world; many of them
cut by his father's own hand in queer and distant places. And, among
them, Tim fixed his eye upon a cane with an ivory handle, a slender,
polished cane that he had always coveted tremendously. It was the kind
he meant to use when he was a man. It bent, it quivered, and when he
swished it through the air it trembled like a riding-whip, and made a
whistling noise. Yet it was very strong in spite of its elastic
qualities. A family treasure, it was also an old-fashioned relic; it
had been his grandfather's walking stick. Something of another century
clung visibly about it still. It had dignity and grace and leisure in
its very aspect. And it suddenly occurred to him: "How grandpapa must
miss it! Wouldn't he just love to have it back again!"</p>

<p>How it happened exactly, Tim did not know, but a few minutes later
he found himself walking about the deserted halls and passages of the
house with the air of an elderly gentleman of a hundred years ago,
proud as a courtier, flourishing the stick like an Eighteenth Century
dandy in the Mall. That the cane reached to his shoulder made no
difference; he held it accordingly, swaggering on his way. He was off
upon an adventure. He dived down through the byways of the Other Wing,
inside himself, as though the stick transported him to the days of the
old gentleman who had used it in another century.</p>

<p>It may seem strange to those who dwell in smaller houses, but in
this rambling Elizabethan mansion there were whole sections that, even
to Tim, were strange and unfamiliar. In his mind the map of the Other
Wing was clearer by far than the geography of the part he travelled
daily.</p>

<p>He came to passages and dim-lit halls, long corridors of stone
beyond the Picture Gallery; narrow, wainscoted connecting-channels with
four steps down and a little later two steps up; deserted chambers with
arches guarding them--all hung with the soft March twilight and all
bewilderingly unrecognised. With a sense of adventure born of
naughtiness he went carelessly along, farther and farther into the
heart of this unfamiliar country, swinging the cane, one thumb stuck
into the arm-pit of his blue serge suit, whistling softly to himself
excited yet keenly on the alert--and suddenly found himself opposite a
door that checked all further advance. It was a green baize door. And
it was swinging.</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly, facing it. He stared, he gripped his cane more
tightly, he held his breath.</p>

<p>"The Other Wing!" he gasped in a swallowed whisper. It was an
entrance, but an entrance he had never seen before. He thought he knew
every door by heart; but this one was new. He stood motionless for
several minutes, watching it; the door had two halves, but one half
only was swinging, each swing shorter than the one before; he heard the
little puffs of air it made; it settled finally, the last movements
very short and rapid; it stopped. And the boy's heart, after similar
rapid strokes, stopped also--for a moment.</p>

<p>"Some one's just gone through," he gulped. And even as he said it he
knew who the some one was. The conviction just dropped into him. "It's
Grandfather; he knows I've got his stick. He wants it!" On the heels of
this flashed instantly another amazing certainty. "He sleeps in there.
He's having dreams. That's what being dead means."</p>

<p>His first impulse, then, took the form of, "I must let Father know;
it'll make him burst for joy"; but his second was for himself--to
finish his adventure. And it was this, naturally enough, that gained
the day. He could tell his father later. His first duty was plainly to
go through the door into the Other Wing. He must give the stick back to
its owner. He must hand it back.</p>

<p>The test of will and character came now. Tim had imagination, and so
knew the meaning of fear; but there was nothing craven in him. He could
howl and scream and stamp like any other person of his age when the
occasion called for such behaviour, but such occasions were due to
temper roused by a thwarted will, and the histrionics were half
"pretended" to produce a calculated effect. There was no one to thwart
his will at present. He also knew how to be afraid of Nothing, to be
afraid without ostensible cause, that is--which was merely "nerves." He
could have "the shudders" with the best of them.</p>

<p>But, when a real thing faced him, Tim's character emerged to meet
it. He would clench his hands, brace his muscles, set his teeth--and
wish to heaven he was bigger. But he would not flinch. Being
imaginative, he lived the worst a dozen times before it happened, yet
in the final crash he stood up like a man. He had that highest
pluck--the courage of a sensitive temperament.</p>

<p>And at this particular juncture, somewhat ticklish for a boy of
eight or nine, it did not fail him.</p>

<p>He lifted the cane and pushed the swinging door wide open. Then he
walked through it--into the Other Wing.</p>

<p>The green baize door swung to behind him; he was even sufficiently
master of himself to turn and close it with a steady hand, because he
did not care to hear the series of muffled thuds its lessening swings
would cause. But he realised clearly his position, knew he was doing a
tremendous thing.</p>

<p>Holding the cane between fingers very tightly clenched, he advanced
bravely along the corridor that stretched before him. And all fear left
him from that moment, replaced, it seemed, by a mild and exquisite
surprise. His footsteps made no sound, he walked on air; instead of
darkness, or the twilight he expected, a diffused and gentle light that
seemed like the silver on the lawn when a half-moon sails a cloudless
sky, lay everywhere. He knew his way, moreover, knew exactly where he
was and whither he was going. The corridor was as familiar to him as
the floor of his own bedroom; he recognised the shape and length of it;
it agreed exactly with the map he had constructed long ago. Though he
had never, to the best of his knowledge, entered it before, he knew
with intimacy its every detail.</p>

<p>And thus the surprise he felt was mild and far from disconcerting.
"I'm here again!" was the kind of thought he had. It was how he got
here that caused the faint surprise, apparently. He no longer
swaggered, however, but walked carefully, and half on tiptoe, holding
the ivory handle of the cane with a kind of affectionate respect. And
as he advanced, the light closed softly up behind him, obliterating the
way by which he had come. But this he did not know, because he did not
look behind him. He only looked in front, where the corridor stretched
its silvery length towards the great chamber where he knew the cane
must be surrendered. The person who had preceded him down this ancient
corridor, passing through the green baize door just before he reached
it, this person, his father's father, now stood in that great chamber,
waiting to receive his own. Tim knew it as surely as he knew he
breathed. At the far end he even made out the larger patch of silvery
light which marked its gaping doorway.</p>

<p>There was another thing he knew as well--that this corridor he moved
along between rooms with fast-closed doors, was the Nightmare Corridor;
often and often he had traversed it; each room was occupied. "This is
the Nightmare Passage," he whispered to himself, "but I know the
Ruler--it doesn't matter. None of them can get out or do anything." He
heard them, none the less, inside, as he passed by; he heard them
scratching to get out. The feeling of security made him reckless; he
took unnecessary risks; he brushed the panels as he passed. And the
love of keen sensation for its own sake, the desire to feel "an awful
thrill," tempted him once so sharply that he raised his stick and poked
a fast-shut door with it! He was not prepared for the result, but he
gained the sensation and the thrill. For the door opened with instant
swiftness half an inch, a hand emerged, caught the stick and tried to
draw it in. Tim sprang back as if he had been struck. He pulled at the
ivory handle with all his strength, but his strength was less than
nothing. He tried to shout, but his voice had gone. A terror of the
moon came over him, for he was unable to loosen his hold of the handle;
his fingers had become a part of it. An appalling weakness turned him
helpless. He was dragged inch by inch towards the fearful door. The end
of the stick was already through the narrow crack. He could not see the
hand that pulled, but he knew it was terrific. He understood now why
the world was strange, why horses galloped furiously, and why trains
whistled as they raced through stations. All the comedy and terror of
nightmare gripped his heart with pincers made of ice. The disproportion
was abominable. The final collapse rushed over him when, without a sign
of warning, the door slammed silently, and between the jamb and the
wall the cane was crushed as flat as if it were a bulrush. So
irresistible was the force behind the door that the solid stick just
went flat as a stalk of a bulrush.</p>

<p>He looked at it. It was a bulrush.</p>

<p>He did not laugh; the absurdity was so distressingly unnatural. The
horror of finding a bulrush where he had expected a polished cane--this
hideous and appalling detail held the nameless horror of the nightmare.
It betrayed him utterly. Why had he not always known really that the
stick was not a stick, but a thin and hollow reed...?</p>

<p>Then the cane was safely in his hand, unbroken. He stood looking at
it. The Nightmare was in full swing. He heard another door opening
behind his back, a door he had not touched. There was just time to see
a hand thrusting and waving dreadfully, familiarly, at him through the
narrow crack--just time to realise that this was another Nightmare
acting in atrocious concert with the first, when he saw closely beside
him, towering to the ceiling, the protective, kindly Figure that
visited his bedroom. In the turning movement he made to meet the
attack, he became aware of her. And his terror passed. It was a
nightmare terror merely. The infinite horror vanished. Only the comedy
remained. He smiled.</p>

<p>He saw her dimly only, she was so vast, but he saw her, the Ruler of
the Other Wing at last, and knew that he was safe again. He gazed with
a tremendous love and wonder, trying to see her clearly; but the face
was hidden far aloft and seemed to melt into the sky beyond the roof.
He discerned that she was larger than the Night, only far, far softer,
with wings that folded above him more tenderly even than his mother's
arms; that there were points of light like stars among the feathers,
and that she was vast enough to cover millions and millions of people
all at once.</p>

<p>Moreover, she did not fade or go, so far as he could see, but spread
herself in such a way that he lost sight of her. She spread over the
entire Wing...</p>

<p>And Tim remembered that this was all quite natural really. He had
often and often been down this corridor before; the Nightmare Corridor
was no new experience; it had to be faced as usual.</p>

<p>Once knowing what hid inside the rooms, he was bound to tempt them
out. They drew, enticed, attracted him; this was their power. It was
their special strength that they could suck him helplessly towards
them, and that he was obliged to go.</p>

<p>He understood exactly why he was tempted to tap with the cane upon
their awful doors, but, having done so, he had accepted the challenge
and could now continue his journey quietly and safely. The Ruler of the
Other Wing had taken him in charge.</p>

<p>A delicious sense of carelessness came on him. There was softness as
of water in the solid things about him, nothing that could hurt or
bruise. Holding the cane firmly by its ivory handle, he went forward
along the corridor, walking as on air.</p>

<p>The end was quickly reached: he stood upon the threshold of the
mighty chamber where he knew the owner of the cane was waiting; the
long corridor lay behind him, in front he saw the spacious dimensions
of a lofty hall that gave him the feeling of being in the Crystal
Palace, Euston Station, or St. Paul's. High, narrow windows, cut deeply
into the wall, stood in a row upon the other side; an enormous open
fireplace of burning logs was on his right; thick tapestries hung from
the ceiling to the floor of stone; and in the centre of the chamber was
a massive table of dark, shining wood, great chairs with carved stiff
backs set here and there beside it. And in the biggest of these
throne-like chairs there sat a figure looking at him gravely--the
figure of an old, old man.</p>

<p>Yet there was no surprise in the boy's fast-beating heart; there was
a thrill of pleasure and excitement only, a feeling of satisfaction. He
had known quite well the figure would be there, known also it would
look like this exactly. He stepped forward on to the floor of stone
without a trace of fear or trembling, holding the precious cane in two
hands now before him, as though to present it to its owner. He felt
proud and pleased. He had run risks for this.</p>

<p>And the figure rose quietly to meet him, advancing in a stately
manner over the hard stone floor. The eyes looked gravely, sweetly down
at him, the aquiline nose stood out. Tim knew him perfectly: the
knee-breeches of shining satin, the gleaming buckles on the shoes, the
neat dark stockings, the lace and ruffles about neck and wrists, the
coloured waistcoat opening so widely--all the details of the picture
over father's mantelpiece, where it hung between two Crimean bayonets,
were reproduced in life before his eyes at last. Only the polished cane
with the ivory handle was not there.</p>

<p>Tim went three steps nearer to the advancing figure and held out
both his hands with the cane laid crosswise on them.</p>

<p>"I've brought it, Grandfather," he said, in a faint but clear and
steady tone; "here it is."</p>

<p>And the other stooped a little, put out three fingers half concealed
by falling lace, and took it by the ivory handle. He made a courtly bow
to Tim. He smiled, but though there was pleasure, it was a grave, sad
smile. He spoke then: the voice was slow and very deep. There was a
delicate softness in it, the suave politeness of an older day.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said; "I value it. It was given to me by my
grandfather. I forgot it when I--"</p>

<p>His voice grew indistinct a little.</p>

<p>"Yes?" said Tim.</p>

<p>"When I--left," the old gentleman repeated.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Tim, thinking how beautiful and kind the gracious figure
was.</p>

<p>The old man ran his slender fingers carefully along the cane,
feeling the polished surface with satisfaction. He lingered specially
over the smoothness of the ivory handle. He was evidently very
pleased.</p>

<p>"I was not quite myself--er--at the moment," he went on gently; "my
memory failed me somewhat." He sighed, as though an immense relief was
in him.</p>

<p>"I forget things, too--sometimes," Tim mentioned sympathetically. He
simply loved his grandfather. He hoped--for a moment--he would he
lifted up and kissed. "I'm awfully glad I brought it," he
faltered--"that you've got it again."</p>

<p>The other turned his kind grey eyes upon him; the smile on his face
was full of gratitude as he looked down.</p>

<p>"Thank you, my boy. I am truly and deeply indebted to you. You
courted danger for my sake. Others have tried before, but the Nightmare
Passage--er--" He broke off. He tapped the stick firmly on the stone
flooring, as though to test it. Bending a trifle, he put his weight
upon it.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he exclaimed with a short sigh of relief, "I can now--"</p>

<p>His voice again grew indistinct; Tim did not catch the words.</p>

<p>"Yes?" he asked again, aware for the first time that a touch of awe
was in his heart.</p>

<p>"--get about again," the other continued very low. "Without my
cane," he added, the voice failing with each word the old lips uttered,
"I could not...possibly...allow myself...to be seen. It was
indeed...deplorable...unpardonable of me...to forget in such a way.
Zounds, sir...! I--I..."</p>

<p>His voice sank away suddenly into a sound of wind. He straightened
up, tapping the iron ferrule of his cane on the stones in a series of
loud knocks. Tim felt a strange sensation creep into his legs. The
queer words frightened him a little.</p>

<p>The old man took a step towards him. He still smiled, but there was
a new meaning in the smile. A sudden earnestness had replaced the
courtly, leisurely manner. The next words seemed to blow down upon the
boy from above, as though a cold wind brought them from the sky
outside.</p>

<p>Yet the words, he knew, were kindly meant, and very sensible. It was
only the abrupt change that startled him. Grandfather, after all, was
but a man! The distant sound recalled something in him to that outside
world from which the cold wind blew.</p>

<p>"My eternal thanks to you," he heard, while the voice and face and
figure seemed to withdrew deeper and deeper into the heart of the
mighty chamber. "I shall not forget your kindness and your courage. It
is a debt I can, fortunately, one day repay...But now you had best
return and with dispatch. For your head and arm lie heavily on the
table, the documents are scattered, there is a cushion fallen...and my
son is in the house...Farewell! You had best leave me quickly. See! She
stands behind you, waiting. Go with her! Go now...!"</p>

<p>The entire scene had vanished even before the final words were
uttered. Tim felt empty space about him. A vast, shadowy Figure bore
him through it as with mighty wings. He flew, he rushed, he remembered
nothing more--until he heard another voice and felt a heavy hand upon
his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Tim, you rascal! What are you doing in my study? And in the dark,
like this!"</p>

<p>He looked up into his father's face without a word. He felt dazed.
The next minute his father had caught him up and kissed him.</p>

<p>"Ragamuffin! How did you guess I was coming back to-night?" He shook
him playfully and kissed his tumbling hair. "And you've been asleep,
too, into the bargain. Well--how's everything at home--eh? Jack's
coming back from school to-morrow, you know, and..."</p>

<p>Jack came home, indeed, the following day, and when the Easter
holidays were over, the governess stayed abroad and Tim went off to
adventures of another kind in the preparatory school for Wellington.
Life slipped rapidly along with him; he grew into a man; his mother and
his father died; Jack followed them within a little space; Tim
inherited, married, settled down into his great possessions--and opened
up the Other Wing. The dreams of imaginative boyhood all had faded;
perhaps he had merely put them away, or perhaps he had forgotten them.
At any rate, he never spoke of such things now, and when his Irish wife
mentioned her belief that the old country house possessed a family
ghost, even declaring that she had met an Eighteenth Century figure of
a man in the corridors, "an old, old man who bends down upon a
stick"--Tim only laughed and said: "That's as it ought to be! And if
these awful land-taxes force us to sell some day, a respectable ghost
will increase the market value."</p>

<p>But one night he woke and heard a tapping on the floor. He sat up in
bed and listened. There was a chilly feeling down his back. Belief had
long since gone out of him; he felt uncannily afraid. The sound came
nearer and nearer; there were light footsteps with it. The door
opened--it opened a little wider, that is, for it already stood
ajar--and there upon the threshold stood a figure that it seemed he
knew. He saw the face as with all the vivid sharpness of reality. There
was a smile upon it, but a smile of warning and alarm. The arm was
raised. Tim saw the slender hand, lace falling down upon the long, thin
fingers, and in them, tightly gripped, a polished cane.</p>

<p>Shaking the cane twice to and fro in the air, the face thrust
forward, spoke certain words, and--vanished. But the words were
inaudible; for, though the lips distinctly moved, no sound, apparently,
came from them.</p>

<p>And Tim sprang out of bed. The room was full of darkness. He turned
the light on. The door, he saw, was shut as usual. He had, of course,
been dreaming. But he noticed a curious odour in the air. He sniffed it
once or twice--then grasped the truth. It was a smell of burning!</p>

<p>Fortunately, he awoke just in time...</p>

<p>He was acclaimed a hero for his promptitude. After many days, when
the damage was repaired, and nerves had settled down once more into the
calm routine of country life, he told the story to his wife--the entire
story. He told the adventure of his imaginative boyhood with it. She
asked to see the old family cane. And it was this request of hers that
brought back to memory a detail Tim had entirely forgotten all these
years. He remembered it suddenly again--the loss of the cane, the
hubbub his father kicked up about it, the endless, futile search. For
the stick had never been found, and Tim, who was questioned very
closely concerning it, swore with all his might that he had not the
smallest notion where it was. Which was, of course, the truth.</p>

<h2><a name="ch14"></a>Running Wolf</h2>

<p>The man who enjoys an adventure outside the general experience of
the race, and imparts it to others, must not be surprised if he is
taken for either a liar or a fool, as Malcolm Hyde, hotel clerk on a
holiday, discovered in due course. Nor is 'enjoy' the word to use in
describing his emotions; the word he chose was probably 'survive.'</p>

<p>When he first set eves on Medicine Lake he was struck by its still,
sparkling beauty, lying there in the vast Canadian backwoods; next, by
its extreme loneliness; and, lastly--a good deal later, this--by its
combination of beauty, loneliness, and singular atmosphere, due to the
fact that it was the scene of adventure.</p>

<p>'It's fairly stiff with big fish,' said Morton of the Montreal
Sporting Club. 'Spend your holidays there up Mattawa way, some fifteen
miles west of Stony Creek. You'll have it all yourself except for an
old Indian who's got a shack there. Camp on the east side--if you'll
take a tip from me.' He then talked for half an hour about the
wonderful sport; yet he was not otherwise very communicative, and did
nut suffer questions gladly, Hyde noticed. Nor had he stayed there very
long himself. If it was such a paradise as Morton, its discoverer and
the most experienced rod in the province, claimed, why had he himself
spent only three days there?</p>

<p>'Ran short of grub,' was the explanation offered; but to another
friend he had mentioned briefly, 'flies' and to a third, so Hyde
learned later, he gave the excuse that his half-breed 'took sick,'
necessitating a quick return to civilisation.</p>

<p>Hyde, however, cared little for the explanations; his interest in
these came later. 'Stiff with fish' was the phrase he liked. He took
the Canadian Pacific train to Mattawa, laid in his outfit at Stony
Creek, and set off thence for the fifteen-mile canoe-trip without a
care in the world.</p>

<p>Travelling light, the portages did not trouble him; the water was
swift and easy, the rapids negotiable; everything came his way, as the
saying is. Occasionally he saw big fish making for the deeper pools,
and was sorely tempted to stop; but he resisted. He pushed on between
the immense world of forests that stretched for hundreds of miles,
known to deer, bear, moose, and wolf, but strange to any echo of human
tread, a deserted and primeval wilderness. The autumn day was calm, the
water sang and sparkled, the blue sky hung cloudless over all, ablaze
with Light. Toward evening he passed an old beaver-dam, rounded a
little point, and had his first sight of Medicine Lake. He lifted his
dripping paddle; the canoe shot with silent glide into calm water.</p>

<p>He gave an exclamation of delight, for the loveliness caught his
breath away.</p>

<p>Though primarily a sportsman, he was not insensible to beauty. The
lake formed a crescent, perhaps four miles long, its width between a
mile and half a mile. The slanting gold of sunset flooded it. No wind
stirred its crystal surface. Here it had lain since the redskins' god
first made it; here it would lie until he dried it up again. Towering
spruce and hemlock trooped to its very edge, majestic cedars leaned
down as if to drink, crimson sumachs shone in fiery patches, and maples
gleamed orange and red beyond belief. The air was like wine, with the
silence of a dream.</p>

<p>It was here the red men formerly 'made medicine,' with all the wild
ritual and tribal ceremony of an ancient day. But it was of Morton,
rather than of Indians, that Hyde thought. If this lonely, hidden
paradise was really stiff with big fish, he owed a lot to Morton for
the information. Peace invaded him, but the excitement of the hunter
lay below.</p>

<p>He looked about him with quick, practised eye for a camping-place
before the sun sank below the forests and the half-lights came. The
Indian's shack, lying in full sunshine on the eastern shore, he found
at once; but the trees lay too thick about it for comfort, nor did he
wish to be so close to its inhabitant. Upon the opposite side, however,
an ideal clearing offered. This lay already in shadow, the huge forest
darkening it toward evening; but the open space attracted. He paddled
over and quickly examined it. The ground was hard and dry, he found,
and a little brook ran tinkling down one side of it into the lake. This
outfall, too, would be a good fishing spot.</p>

<p>Also it was sheltered. A few low willows marked the mouth.</p>

<p>An experienced camper soon makes up his mind. It was a perfect site,
and some charred logs, with traces of former fires, proved that he was
not the first to think so. Hyde was delighted.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, disappointment came to tinge his pleasure. His kit
was landed, and preparations for putting up the tent were begun, when
he recalled a detail that excitement had so far kept in the background
of his mind--Morton's advice. But not Morton's only, for the
storekeeper at Stony Creek reinforced it. The big fellow with
straggling moustache and stooping shoulders, dressed in shirt and
trousers, had handed him out a final sentence with the bacon, flour,
condensed milk, and sugar. He had repeated Morton's half-forgotten
words:</p>

<p>'Put yer tent on the east shore, I should,' he had said at
parting.</p>

<p>He remembered Morton, too, apparently. 'A shortish fellow, brown as
an Indian and fairly smelling of the woods. Travelling with Jake, the
half-breed.' That assuredly was Morton. 'Didn't stay long, now, did
he,' he added to himself in a reflective tone.</p>

<p>'Going Windy Lake way, are yer? Or Ten Mile Water maybe?' he had
first inquired of Hyde.</p>

<p>'Medicine Lake.'</p>

<p>'Is that so?' the man said, as though he doubted it for some obscure
reason. He pulled at his ragged moustache a moment. 'Is that so, now?'
he repeated. And the final words followed him down-stream after a
considerable pause--the advice about the best shore on which to put his
tent All this now suddenly flashed back upon Hyde's mind with a tinge
of disappointment and annoyance, for when two experienced men agreed,
their opinion was nor to be lightly disregarded. He wished he had asked
the storekeeper for more details. He looked about him, he reflected, he
hesitated. His ideal camping-ground lay certainly on the forbidden
shore. What in the world, he wondered, could be the objection to
it?</p>

<p>But the light was fading; he must decide quickly one way or the
other. After staring at his unpacked dunnage, and the tent, already
half erected, he made up his mind with a muttered expression that
consigned both Morton and the storekeeper to less pleasant places.
'They must have some reason,' he growled to himself; 'fellows like that
usually know what they're talking about. I guess I'd better shift over
to the other side--for to-night at any rate.'</p>

<p>He glanced across the water before actually reloading. No smoke rose
from the Indian's shack.</p>

<p>He had seen no sign of a canoe. The man, he decided, was away.
Reluctantly, then, he left the good camping-ground and paddled across
the lake, and half an hour later his tent was up, firewood collected,
and two small trout were already caught for supper. But the bigger
fish, he knew, lay waiting for him on the other side by the little
out-fall, and he fell asleep at length on his bed of balsam boughs,
annoyed and disappointed, yet wondering how a mere sentence could have
persuaded him so easily against his own better judgment. He slept like
the dead; the sun was well up before he stirred.</p>

<p>But his morning mood was a very different one. The brilliant light,
the peace, the intoxicating air, all this was too exhilarating for the
mind to harbour foolish fancies, and he marvelled that he could have
been so weak the night before. No hesitation lay in him anywhere. He
struck camp immediately after breakfast, paddled back across the strip
of shining water, and quickly settled in upon the forbidden shore, as
he now called it, with a contemptuous grin. And the more he saw of the
spot, the better he liked it. There was plenty of wood, running water
to drink, an open space about the tent, and there were no flies. The
fishing, moreover, was magnificent. Morton's description was fully
justified, and 'stiff with big fish' for once was not an
exaggeration.</p>

<p>The useless hours of the early afternoon he passed dozing in the
sun, or wandering through the underbrush beyond the camp. He found no
sign of anything unusual. He bathed in a cool deep pool; he revelled in
the lonely little paradise. Lonely it certainly was, but the loneliness
was part of its charm; the stillness, the peace, the isolation of this
beautiful backwoods lake delighted him.</p>

<p>The silence was divine. He was entirely satisfied.</p>

<p>After a brew of tea, he strolled toward evening along the shore,
looking for the first sign of a rising fish. A faint ripple on the
water, with the lengthening shadows, made good conditions.</p>

<p>Plop followed plop, as the big fellows rose, snatched at their food,
and vanished into the depths.</p>

<p>He hurried back. Ten minute later he had taken his rods and was
gliding cautiously in the canoe through the quiet water.</p>

<p>So good was the sport, indeed, and so quickly did the big trout pile
up in the bottom of the canoe, that despite the growing lateness, he
found it hard to tear himself away. 'One more,' he said, 'and then I
really will go.' He landed that 'one more,' and was in the act of
taking off the hook, when the deep silence of the evening was curiously
disturbed. He became abruptly aware that some one watched him. A pair
of eyes, it seemed, were fixed upon him from some point in the
surrounding shadows.</p>

<p>Thus, at least, he interpreted the odd disturbance in his happy
mood; for thus he felt it. The feeling stole over him without the
slightest warning. He was not alone. The slippery big trout dropped
from his fingers. He sat motionless, and stared about him.</p>

<p>Nothing stirred; the ripple on the lake had died away; there was no
wind; the forest lay a single purple mass of shadow; the yellow sky,
fast fading, threw reflections that troubled the eye and made distances
uncertain. But there was no sound, no movement; he saw no figure
anywhere.</p>

<p>Yet he knew that some one watched him, and a wave of quite
unreasoning terror gripped him.</p>

<p>The nose of the canoe was against the bank. In a moment, and
instinctively, he shoved it off and paddled into deeper water. The
watcher, it came to him also instinctively, was quite close to him upon
that bank. But where? And who? Was it the Indian?</p>

<p>Here, in deeper water, and some twenty yards from the shore, he
paused and strained both sight and hearing to find some possible clue.
He felt half ashamed, now that the first strange feeling passed a
little. But the certainty remained. Absurd as it was, he felt positive
that some one watched him with concentrated and intent regard. Every
fibre in his being told him so; and though he could discover no figure,
no new outline on the shore, he could even have sworn in which clump of
willow bushes the hidden person crouched and stared. His attention
seemed drawn to that particular clump.</p>

<p>The water dripped slowly from his paddle, now lying across the
thwarts. There was no other sound. The canvas of his tent gleamed
dimly. A star or two were out. He waited. Nothing happened.</p>

<p>Then, as suddenly as it had come, the feeling passed, and he knew
that the person who had been watching him intently had gone. It was as
if a current had been turned off; the normal world flowed back; the
landscape emptied as if some one had left a room. The disagreeable
feeling left him at the same time, so that he instantly turned the
canoe in to the shore again, landed, and, paddle in hand, went over to
examine the clump of willows he had singled out as the place of
concealment. There was no one there, of course, nor any trace of recent
human occupancy. No leaves, no branches stirred, nor was a single twig
displaced; his keen and practised sight detected no sign of tracks upon
the ground. Yet, for all that, he felt positive that a little time ago
some one had crouched among these very leaves and watched him. He
remained absolutely convinced of it.</p>

<p>The watcher, whether Indian hunter, stray lumberman, or wandering
half-breed, had now withdrawn, a search was useless, and dusk was
falling. He returned to his little camp, more disturbed perhaps than he
cared to acknowledge. He cooked his supper, hung up his catch on a
string, so that no prowling animal could get at it during the night,
and prepared to make himself comfortable until bedtime. Unconsciously,
he built a bigger fire than usual and found himself peering over his
pipe into the deep shadows beyond the firelight, straining his ears to
catch the slightest sound. He remained generally on the alert in a way
that was new to him.</p>

<p>A man under such conditions and in such a place need not know
discomfort until the sense of loneliness strikes him as too vivid a
reality. Loneliness in a backwoods camp brings charm, pleasure, and a
happy sense of calm until, and unless, it comes too near. It should
remain an ingredient only among other conditions; it should not be
directly, vividly noticed. Once it has crept within short range,
however, it may easily cross the narrow line between comfort and
discomfort, and darkness is an undesirable time for the transition. A
curious dread may easily follow--the dread lest the loneliness suddenly
be disturbed, and the solitary human feel himself open to attack.</p>

<p>For Hyde, now, this transition had been already accomplished; the
too intimate sense of his loneliness had shifted abruptly into the
worst condition of no longer being quite alone. It was an awkward
moment, and the hotel clerk realised his position exactly. He did not
quite like it. He sat there, with his back to the blazing logs, a very
visible object in the light, while all about him the darkness of the
forest lay like an impenetrable wall. He could not see a yard beyond
the small circle of his camp-fire; the silence about him was like the
silence of the dead. No leaf rustled, no wave lapped; he himself sat
motionless as a log.</p>

<p>Then again he became suddenly aware that the person who watched him
had returned, and that same intent and concentrated gaze as before was
fixed upon him where he lay. There was no warning; he heard no stealthy
tread or snapping of dry twigs, yet the owner of those steady eyes was
very close to him, probably not a dozen feet away. This sense of
proximity was overwhelming.</p>

<p>It is unquestionable that a shiver ran down his spine. This time,
moreover, he felt positive that the man crouched just beyond the
firelight, the distance he himself could see being nicely calculated,
and straight in front of him. For some minutes he sat without stirring
a single muscle, yet with each muscle ready and alert, straining his
eyes in vain to pierce the darkness, but only succeeding in dazzling
his sight with the reflected light. Then, as he shifted his position
slowly, cautiously, to obtain another angle of vision, his heart gave
two big thumps against his ribs and the hair seemed to rise on his
scalp with the sense of cold that gave him goose-flesh. In the darkness
facing him he saw two small and greenish circles that were certainly a
pair of eyes, yet not the eyes of Indian hunter, or of any human being.
It was a pair of animal eyes that stared so fixedly at him out of the
night. And this certainty had an immediate and natural effect upon
him.</p>

<p>For, at the menace of those eyes, the fears of millions of long dead
hunters since the dawn of time woke in him. Hotel clerk though he was,
heredity surged through him in an automatic wave of instinct. His hand
groped for a weapon. His fingers fell on the iron head of his small
camp axe, and at once he was himself again. Confidence returned; the
vague, superstitious dread was gone. This was a bear or wolf that smelt
his catch and came to steal it. With beings of that sort, he knew
instinctively how to deal, yet admitting, by this very instinct, that
his original dread had been of quite another kind.</p>

<p>'I'll damned quick find out what it is,' he exclaimed aloud, and
snatching a burning brand from the fire, he hurled it with good aim
straight at the eyes of the beast before him.</p>

<p>The bit of pitch-pine fell in a shower of sparks that lit the dry
grass this side of the animal, flared up a moment, then died quickly
down again. But in that instant of bright illumination he saw clearly
what his unwelcome visitor was. A big timber wolf sat on its
hindquarters, staring steadily at him through the firelight. He saw its
legs and shoulders, he saw its hair, he saw also the big hemlock trunks
lit up behind it, and the willow scrub on each side. It formed a vivid,
clear-cut picture shown in clear detail by the momentary blaze. To his
amazement, however, the wolf did not turn and bolt away from the
burning log, but withdrew a few yards only, and sat there again on its
haunches, staring, staring as before. Heavens, how it stared! He
'shoo-ed' it, but without effect; it did not budge. He did not waste
another good log on it, for his fear was dissipated now; a timber wolf
was a timber wolf, and it might sit there as long as it pleased,
provided it did not try to steal his catch. No alarm was in him any
more. He knew that wolves were harmless in the summer and autumn, and
even when 'packed' in the winter they would attack a man only when
suffering desperate hunger. So he lay and watched the beast, threw bits
of stick in its direction, even talked to it, wondering only that it
never moved. 'You can stay there for ever, if you like,' he remarked to
it aloud, 'for you cannot get at my fish, and the rest of the grub I
shall take into the tent with me!'</p>

<p>The creature blinked its bright green eyes, but made no move. Why,
then, if his fear was gone, did he think of certain things as he rolled
himself in the Hudson Bay blankets before going sleep? The immobility
of the animal was strange, its refusal to turn and bolt was still
stranger.</p>

<p>Never before had he know, a wild creature that was not afraid of
fire. Why did it sit and watch him, as with purpose in its gleaming
eyes? How had he felt its presence earlier and instantly? A timber
wolf, especially a solitary wolf, was a timid thing, yet this one
feared neither man nor fire.</p>

<p>Now, as he lay there wrapped in his blankets inside the cosy tent,
it sat outside beneath the stars, beside the fading embers, the wind
chilly in its fur, the ground cooling beneath its planted paws,
watching him, steadily watching him, perhaps until the dawn.</p>

<p>It was unusual, it was strange. Having neither imagination nor
tradition, he called upon no store of racial visions. Matter of fact, a
hotel clerk on a fishing holiday, he lay there in blankets, merely
wondering and puzzled. A timber wolf was a timber wolf and nothing
more. Yet this timber wolf--the idea haunted him--was different. In a
word, the deeper part his original uneasiness remained. He tossed
about, he shivered sometimes in his broken sleep; he did not go out to
see, but he woke early and unrefreshed.</p>

<p>Again with the sunshine and the morning wind, however, the incident
of the night before was forgotten, almost unreal. His hunting zeal was
uppermost. The tea and fish were delicious, his pipe had never tasted
so good, the glory of this lonely lake amid primeval forests went to
his head a little; he was a hunter before the Lord, and nothing else.
He tried the edge of the lake, and in the excitement of playing a big
fish, knew suddenly that it, the wolf, was there. He paused with the
rod, exactly as if struck. He looked about him, he looked in a definite
direction. The brilliant sunshine made every smallest detail clear and
sharp--boulders of granite, burned stems, crimson sumach, pebbles along
the shore in neat, separate detail--without revealing where the watcher
hid. Then, his sight wandering farther inshore among the tangled
undergrowth, he suddenly picked up the familiar, half-expected outline.
The wolf was lying behind a granite boulder, so that only the head, the
muzzle, and the eyes were visible. It merged in its background. Had he
not known it was a wolf, he could never have separated it from the
landscape. The eyes shone in the sunlight.</p>

<p>There it lay. He looked straight at it. Their eyes, in fact,
actually met full and square. 'Great Scott!' he exclaimed aloud, 'why,
it's like looking at a human being!'</p>

<p>From that moment, unwittingly, he established a singular personal
relation with the beast. And what followed confirmed this undesirable
impression, for the animal rose instantly and came down in leisurely
fashion to the shore, where it stood looking back at him. It stood and
stared into his eyes like some great wild dog, so that he was aware of
a new and almost incredible sensation--that it courted recognition.</p>

<p>'Well! Well!' he exclaimed again, relieving his feelings by
addressing it aloud, 'if this doesn't beat everything I ever saw! What
d'you want, anyway?'</p>

<p>He examined it now more carefully. He had never seen a wolf so big
before; it was a tremendous beast, a nasty customer to tackle, he
reflected, if it ever came to that. It stood there absolutely fearless,
and full of confidence. In the clear sunlight he took in every detail
of it--a huge, shaggy, lean-flanked timber wolf, its wicked eyes
staring straight into his own, almost with a kind of purpose in them.
He saw its great jaws, its teeth, and its tongue hung out, dropping
saliva a little. And yet the idea of its savagery, its fierceness, was
very little in him.</p>

<p>He was amazed and puzzled beyond belief. He wished the Indian would
come back. He did not understand this strange behaviour in an animal.
Its eyes, the odd expression in them, gave him a queer, unusual,
difficult feeling. Had his nerves gone wrong, he almost wondered.</p>

<p>The beast stood on the shore and looked at him. He wished for the
first time that he had brought a rifle. With a resounding smack he
brought his paddle down flat upon the water, using all his strength,
till the echoes rang as from a pistol-shot that was audible from one
end of the lake to the other. The wolf never stirred. He shouted, but
the beast remained unmoved. He blinked his eyes, speaking as to a dog,
a domestic animal, a creature accustomed to human ways.</p>

<p>It blinked its eyes in return.</p>

<p>At length, increasing his distance from the shore, he continued
fishing, and the excitement of the marvellous sport held his
attention--his surface attention, at any rate. At times he almost
forgot the attendant beast; yet whenever he looked up, he saw it there.
And worse; when he slowly paddled home again, he observed it trotting
along the shore as though to keep him company.</p>

<p>Crossing a little bay, he spurted, hoping to reach the other point
before his undesired and undesirable attendant. Instantly the brute
broke into that rapid, tireless lope that, except on ice, can run down
anything on four legs in the woods. When he reached the distant point,
the wolf was waiting for him. He raised his paddle from the water,
pausing a moment for reflection; for his very close attention--there
were dusk and night yet to come--he certainly did not relish. His camp
was near; he had to land; he felt uncomfortable even in the sunshine of
broad day, when, to his keen relief, about half a mile from the tent,
he saw the creature suddenly stop and sit down in the open. He waited a
moment, then paddled on. It did not follow. There was no attempt to
move; it merely sat and watched him. After a few hundred yards, he
looked back. It was still sitting where he left it. And the absurd, yet
significant, feeling came to him that the beast divined his thought,
his anxiety, his dread, and was now showing him, as well as it could,
that it entertained no hostile feeling and did not meditate attack.</p>

<p>He turned the canoe toward the shore; he landed; he cooked his
supper in the dusk; the animal made no sign. Not far away it certainly
lay and watched, but it did not advance. And to Hyde, observant now in
a new way, came one sharp, vivid reminder of the strange atmosphere
into which his commonplace personality had strayed: he suddenly
recalled that his relations with the beast, already established, had
progressed distinctly a stage further. This startled him, yet without
the accompanying alarm he must certainly have felt twenty-four hours
before. He had an understanding with the wolf. He was aware of friendly
thoughts toward it. He even went so far as to set out a few big fish on
the spot where he had first seen it sitting the previous night. 'If he
comes,' he thought, 'he is welcome to them, I've got plenty, anyway.'
He thought of it now as 'he.'</p>

<p>Yet the wolf made no appearance until he was in the act of entering
his tent a good deal later. It was close on ten o'clock, whereas nine
was his hour, and late at that, for turning in. He had, therefore,
unconsciously been waiting for him. Then, as he was closing the flap,
he saw the eyes close to where he had placed the fish. He waited,
hiding himself, and expecting to hear sounds of munching jaws; but all
was silence. Only the eyes glowed steadily out of the background of
pitch darkness. He closed the flap. He had no slightest fear. In ten
minutes he was sound asleep.</p>

<p>He could not have slept very long, for when he woke up he could see
the shine of a faint red light through the canvas, and the fire had not
died down completely. He rose and cautiously peeped out. The air was
very cold, he saw breath. But he also saw the wolf, for it had come in,
and was sitting by the dying embers, not two yards away from where he
crouched behind the flap. And this time, at these very close quarters,
there was something in the attitude of the big wild thing that caught
his attention with a vivid thrill of startled surprise and a sudden
shock of cold that held him spell-bound. He stared, unable to believe
his eyes; for the wolf's attitude conveyed to him something familiar
that at first was unable to explain. Its pose reached him in the terms
of another thing with which he was entirely at home. What was it? Did
his senses betray him? Was he still asleep and dreaming?</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, with a start of uncanny recognition, he knew. Its
attitude was that of a dog.</p>

<p>Having found the clue, his mind then made an awful leap. For it was,
after all, no dog its appearance aped, but something nearer to himself,
and more familiar still. Good heavens! It sat there with the pose, the
attitude, the gesture in repose of something almost human. And then,
with a second shock of biting wonder, it came to him like a revelation.
The wolf sat beside that camp-fire as a man might sit.</p>

<p>Before he could weigh his extraordinary discovery, before he could
examine it in detail or with care, the animal, sitting in this ghastly
fashion, seemed to feel his eyes fixed on it. It slowly turned and
looked him in the face, and for the first time Hyde felt a fullblooded
superstitious fear flood through his entire being. He seemed transfixed
with that nameless terror that is said to attack human beings who
suddenly face the dead, finding themselves bereft of speech and
movement. This moment of paralysis certainly occurred. Its passing,
however, was as singular as its advent. For almost at once he was aware
of something beyond and above this mockery of human attitude and pose,
something that ran along unaccustomed nerves and reached his feeling,
even perhaps his heart. The revulsion was extraordinary, its result
still more extraordinary and unexpected. Yet the fact remains. He was
aware of another thing that had the effect of stilling his terror as
soon as it was born. He was aware of appeal, silent, half expressed,
yet vastly pathetic.</p>

<p>He saw in the savage eyes beseeching, even a yearning, expression
that changed his mood as by magic from dread to natural sympathy. The
great grey brute, symbol of cruel ferocity, sat there beside his dying
fire and appealed for help.</p>

<p>The gulf betwixt animal and human seemed in that instant bridged. It
was, of course, incredible. Hyde, sleep still possibly clinging to his
inner being with the shades and half shapes of dream yet about his
soul, acknowledged, how he knew not, the amazing fact. He found himself
nodding to the brute in half consent, and instantly, without more ado,
the lean grey shape rose like a wraith and trotted off swiftly, but
with stealthy tread, into the background of the night.</p>

<p>When Hyde woke in the morning his first impression was that he must
have dreamed the entire incident. His practical nature asserted itself.
There was a bite in the fresh autumn air; the bright sun allowed no
half lights anywhere; he felt brisk in mind and body. Reviewing what
had happened, he came to the conclusion that it was utterly vain to
speculate; no possible explanation of the animal's behaviour occurred
to him: he was dealing with something entirely outside his experience.
His fear, however, had completely left him. The odd sense of
friendliness remained.</p>

<p>The beast had a definite purpose, and he himself was included in
that purpose. His sympathy held good.</p>

<p>But with the sympathy there was also an intense curiosity. 'If it
shows itself again,' he told himself, 'I'll go up close and find out
what it wants.' The fish laid out the night before had not been
touched.</p>

<p>It must have been a full hour after breakfast when he next saw the
brute; it was standing on the edge of the clearing, looking at him in
the way now become familiar. Hyde immediately picked up his axe and
advanced toward it boldly, keeping his eyes fixed straight upon its
own. There was nervousness in him, but kept well under; nothing
betrayed it; step by step he drew nearer until some ten yards separated
them. The wolf had not stirred a muscle as yet. Its jaws hung open, its
eyes observed him intently; it allowed him to approach without a sign
of what its mood might be. Then, with these ten yards between them, it
turned abruptly and moved slowly off, looking back first over one
shoulder and then over the other, exactly as a dog might do, to see if
he was following.</p>

<p>A singular journey it was they then made together, animal and man.
The trees surrounded them at once, for they left the lake behind them,
entering the tangled bush beyond. The beast, Hyde noticed, obviously
picked the easiest track for him to follow; for obstacles that meant
nothing to the four-legged expert, yet were difficult for a man, were
carefully avoided with an almost uncanny skill, while yet the general
direction was accurately kept. Occasionally there were windfalls to be
surmounted; but though the wolf bounded over these with it was always
waiting for the man on the other side after he had laboriously climbed
over. Deeper and deeper into the heart of the lonely forest they
penetrated in this singular fashion, cutting across the arc of the
lake's crescent, it seemed to Hyde; for after two miles or so, he
recognised the big rocky bluff that overhung the water at its northern
end. This outstanding bluff he had seen from his camp, one side of it
falling sheer into the water; it was probably the spot, he imagined,
where the Indians held their medicine-making ceremonies, for it stood
out in isolated fashion, and its top formed a private plateau not easy
of access. And it was here, close to a big spruce at the foot of the
bluff upon the forest side, that the wolf stopped suddenly and for the
first time since its appearance gave audible expression to its
feelings. It sat down on its haunches, lifted its muzzle with open
jaws, and gave vent to a subdued and long-drawn howl that was more like
the wail of a dog than the fierce barking cry associated with a wolf.
By this time Hyde had lost not only fear, but caution too; nor, oddly
enough, did this warning howl, revive a sign of unwelcome emotion in
him. In that curious sound he detected the same message that the eyes
conveyed--appeal for help. He paused, nevertheless, a little startled,
and while the wolf sat waiting for him, he looked about him quickly.
There was young timber here; it had once been a small clearing,
evidently. Axe and fire had done their work, but there was evidence to
an experienced eye that it was Indians and not white men who had once
been busy here. Some part of the medicine ritual, doubtless, took place
in the little clearing, thought the man, as he advanced again towards
his patient leader. The end of their queer journey, he felt, was close
at hand.</p>

<p>He had not taken two steps before the animal got up and moved very
slowly in the direction of some low bushes that formed a clump just
beyond. It entered these, first looking back to make sure that its
companion watched. The bushes hid it; a moment later it emerged again.
Twice it performed this pantomime, each time, as it reappeared,
standing still and staring at the man with as distinct an expression of
appeal in the eyes as an animal may compass, probably. Its excitement,
meanwhile, certainly increased, and this excitement was, with equal
certainty, communicated to the man. Hyde made up his mind quickly.
Gripping his axe tightly, and ready to use it at the first hint of
malice, he moved slowly nearer to the bushes, wondering with something
of a tremor what would happen.</p>

<p>If he expected to be startled, his expectation was at once
fulfilled; but it was the behaviour of the beast that made him jump. It
positively frisked about him like a happy dog. It frisked for joy.</p>

<p>Its excitement was intense, yet from its open mouth no sound was
audible. With a sudden leap, then, it bounded past him into the clump
of bushes, against whose very edge he stood, and began scraping
vigorously at the ground. Hyde stood and stared, amazement and interest
now banishing all his nervousness, even when the beast, in its violent
scraping, actually touched his body with its own. He had, perhaps, the
feeling that he was in a dream, one of those fantastic dreams in which
things may happen without involving an adequate surprise; for otherwise
the manner of scraping and scratching at the ground must have seemed an
impossible phenomenon. No wolf, no dog certainly, used its paws in the
way those paws were working. Hyde had the odd, distressing sensation
that it was hands, not paws, he watched. And yet, somehow, the natural,
adequate surprise he should have felt was absent. The strange action
seemed not entirely unnatural. In his heart some deep hidden spring of
sympathy and pity stirred instead. He was aware of pathos.</p>

<p>The wolf stopped in its task and looked up into his face. Hyde acted
without hesitation then.</p>

<p>Afterwards he was wholly at a loss to explain his own conduct. It
seemed he knew what to do, divined what was asked, expected of him.
Between his mind and the dumb desire yearning through the savage animal
there was intelligent and intelligible communication. He cut a stake
and sharpened it, for the stones would blunt his axe-edge. He entered
the clump of bushes to complete the digging his four-legged companion
had begun. And while he worked, though he did not forget the close
proximity of the wolf, he paid no attention to it; often his back was
turned as he stooped over the laborious clearing away of the hard
earth; no uneasiness or sense of danger was in him any more. The wolf
sat outside the clump and watched the operations. Its concentrated
attention, its patience, its intense eagerness, the gentleness and
docility of the grey, fierce, and probably hungry brute, its obvious
pleasure and satisfaction, too, at having won the human to its
mysterious purpose--these were colours in the strange picture that Hyde
thought of later when dealing with the human herd in his hotel again.
At the moment he was aware chiefly of pathos and affection. The whole
business was, of course, not to be believed, but that discovery came
later, too, when telling it to others.</p>

<p>The digging continued for fully half an hour before his labour was
rewarded by the discovery of a small whitish object. He picked it up
and examined it--the finger-bone of a man. Other discoveries then
followed quickly and in quantity. The cache was laid bare. He collected
nearly the complete skeleton. The skull however, he found last, and
might not have found at all but for the guidance of his strangely alert
companion. It lay some few yards away from the central hole now dug,
and the wolf stood nuzzling the ground with its nose before Hyde
understood that he was meant to dig exactly in that spot for it.
Between the beast's very paws his stake struck hard upon it. He scraped
the earth from the bone and examined it carefully. It was perfect, save
for the fact that some wild animal had gnawed it, the teeth-marks being
still plainly visible. Close beside it lay the rusty iron head of a
tomahawk. This and the smallness of the bones confirmed him in his
judgment that it was the skeleton not of a white man, but of an
Indian.</p>

<p>During the excitement of the discovery of the bones one by one, and
finally of the skull, but, more especially, during the period of
intense interest while Hyde was examining them, he had paid little if
any attention to the wolf. He was aware that it sat and watched him,
never moving its keen eyes for a single moment from the actual
operations, but sign or movement it made none at all. He knew that it
was pleased and satisfied, he knew also that he had now fulfilled its
purpose in a great measure. The further intuition that now came to him,
derived, he felt positive, from his companion's dumb desire, was
perhaps the cream of the entire experience to him.</p>

<p>Gathering the bones together in his coat, he carried them, together
with the tomahawk, to the foot of the big spruce where the animal had
first topped. His leg actually touched the creature's muzzle as he
passed. It turned its head to watch, but did not follow, nor did it
move a muscle while he prepared the platform of boughs upon which he
then laid the poor worn bones of an Indian who had been killed,
doubtless, in sudden attack or ambush, and to whose remains had been
denied the last grace of proper tribal burial. He wrapped the bones in
bark; he laid the tomahawk beside the skull; he lit the circular fire
round the pyre, and the blue smoke rose upward into the clear bright
sunshine of the Canadian autumn morning till it was lost among the
mighty trees far overhead.</p>

<p>In the moment before actually lighting the little fire he had turned
to note what his companion did. It sat five yards away, he saw, gazing
intently, and one of its front paws was raised a little from the
ground. It made no sign of any kind. He finished the work, becoming so
absorbed in it that he had eyes for nothing but the tending and
guarding of his careful ceremonial fire. It was only when the platform
of boughs collapsed, laying their charred burden gently on the fragrant
earth among the soft wood ashes, that he turned again, as though to
show the wolf what he had done, and seek, perhaps, some look of
satisfaction in its curiously expressive eyes. But the place he
searched was empty. The wolf had gone.</p>

<p>He did not see it again; it gave no sign of its presence where; he
was not watched. He fished as before, wandered through the bush about
his camp, sat smoking round his fire after dark, and slept peacefully
in his cosy little tent. He was not disturbed. No howl was ever audible
in the distant forest, no twig snapped beneath a stealthy tread, he saw
no eyes. The wolf that behaved like a man had gone for ever.</p>

<p>It was the day before he left that Hyde, noticing smoke rising from
the shack across the lake, paddled over to exchange a word or two with
the Indian, who had evidently now returned. The Redskin came down to
meet him as he landed, but it was soon plain that he spoke very little
English. He emitted the familiar grunts at first; then bit by bit Hyde
stirred his limited vocabulary into action. The net result, however,
was slight enough though it was certainly direct:</p>

<p>'You camp there?' the man asked, pointing to the other side.</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'Wolf come?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'You see wolf?'</p>

<p>'Yes.' The Indian stared at him fixedly a moment, a keen, wondering
look upon his coppery, creased face.</p>

<p>'You 'fraid wolf?' he asked after a moment's pause.</p>

<p>'No,' replied Hyde, truthfully. He knew it was useless to ask
questions of his own, though he was eager for information. The other
would have told him nothing. It was sheer luck that the man had touched
on the subject at all, and Hyde realised that his own best role was
merely to answer, but to ask no questions. Then, suddenly, the Indian
became comparatively voluble. There was awe in his voice and
manner.</p>

<p>'Him no wolf. Him big medicine wolf. Him spirit wolf.'</p>

<p>Whereupon he drank the tea the other had brewed for him, closed his
lips tightly, and said no more. His outline was discernible on the
shore, rigid and motionless, an hour later, when Hyde's canoe turned
the corner of the lake three miles away, and landed to make the
portages up the first rapid of his homeward stream.</p>

<p>It was Morton who, after some persuasion, supplied further details
of what he called the legend. Some hundred years before, the tribe that
lived in the territory beyond the lake began their annual
medicine-making ceremonies on the big rocky bluff at the northern end;
but no medicine could be made. The spirits, declared the chief medicine
man, would not answer. They were offended. An investigation followed.
It was discovered that a young brave had recently killed a wolf, a
thing strictly forbidden, since the wolf was the totem animal of the
tribe. To make matters worse, the name of the guilty man was Running
Wolf. The offence being unpardonable, the man was cursed and driven
from the tribe:</p>

<p>'Go out. Wander alone among the woods, and if we see you we slay
you. Your bones shall be scattered in the forest, and your spirit shall
not enter the Happy Hunting Grounds till one of another race shall find
and bury them.'</p>

<p>'Which meant,' explained Morton laconically, his only comment on the
story, 'probably for ever.'</p>

<h2><a name="ch15"></a>The Singular Death of Morton</h2>

<p>Dusk was melting into darkness as the two men slowly made their way
through the dense forest of spruce and fir that clothed the flanks of
the mountain. They were weary with the long climb, for neither was in
his first youth, and the July day had been a hot one. Their little inn
lay further in the valley among the orchards that separated the forest
from the vineyards.</p>

<p>Neither of them talked much. The big man led the way, carrying the
knapsack, and his companion, older, shorter, evidently the more
fatigued of the two, followed with small footsteps.</p>

<p>From time to time he stumbled among the loose rocks. An
exceptionally observant mind would possibly have divined that his
stumbling was not entirely due to fatigue, but to an absorption of
spirit that made him careless how he walked.</p>

<p>'All right behind?' the big man would call from time to time, half
glancing back.</p>

<p>'Eh? What?' the other would reply, startled out of a reverie.</p>

<p>'Pace too fast?'</p>

<p>'Not a bit. I'm coming.' And once he added: 'You might hurry on and
see to supper, if you feel like it. I shan't be long behind you.'</p>

<p>But his big friend did not adopt the suggestion. He kept the same
distance between them. He called out the same question at intervals,
Once or twice he stopped and looked back too.</p>

<p>In this way they came at length to the skirts of the wood. A deep
hush covered all the valley; the limestone ridges they had climbed
gleamed down white and ghostly upon them from the fading sky. Midway in
its journeys, the evening wind dropped suddenly to watch the beauty of
the moonlight--to hold the branches still so that the light might slip
between and weave its silver pattern on the moss below.</p>

<p>And, as they stood a moment to take it in, a step sounded behind
them on the soft pine-needles, and the older man, still a little in the
rear, turned with a start as though he had been suddenly called by
name.</p>

<p>'There's that girl--again!' he said, and his voice expressed a
curious mingling of pleasure, surprise and--apprehension.</p>

<p>Into a patch of moonlight passed the figure of a young girl, looked
at them as though about to stop yet thinking better of it, smiled
softly, and moved on out of sight into the surrounding darkness. The
moon just caught her eyes and teeth, so that they shone; the rest of
her body stood in shadow; the effect was striking--almost as though
head and shoulders hung alone in mid air, watching them with this
shining smile, then fading away.</p>

<p>'Come on, for heaven's sake,' the big man cried. There was
impatience in his manner, not unkindness. The other lingered a moment,
peering closely into the gloom where the girl had vanished. His friend
repeated his injunction, and a moment later the two had emerged upon
the high road with the village lights in sight beyond, and the forest
left behind them like a vast mantle that held the night within its
folds.</p>

<p>For some minutes neither of them spoke; then the big man waited for
his friend to draw up alongside.</p>

<p>'About all this valley of the Jura,' he said presently, 'there seems
to me something--rather weird.' He shifted the knapsack vigorously on
his back. It was a gesture of unconscious protest.</p>

<p>'Something uncanny,' he added, as he set a good pace.</p>

<p>'But extraordinarily beautiful--'</p>

<p>'It attracts you more than it does me, I think,' was the short
reply.</p>

<p>'The picturesque superstitions still survive here,' observed the
older man. 'They touch the imagination in spite of oneself.'</p>

<p>A pause followed during which the other tried to increase the pace.
The subject evidently made him impatient for some reason.</p>

<p>'Perhaps,' he said presently. 'Though I think myself it's due to the
curious loneliness of the place. I mean, we're in the middle of
tourist-Europe here, yet so utterly remote. It's such a neglected
little corner of the world. The contradiction bewilders. Then, being so
near the frontier, too, with the clock changing an hour a mile from the
village, makes one think of time as unreal and imaginary.' He laughed.
He produced several other reasons as well. His friend admitted their
value, and agreed half-heartedly. He still turned occasionally to look
back. The mountain ridge where they had climbed was clearly visible in
the moonlight.</p>

<p>'Odd,' he said, 'but I don't see that farmhouse where we got the
milk anywhere. It ought to be easily visible from here.'</p>

<p>'Hardly--in this light. It was a queer place rather, I thought,' he
added. He did not deny the curiously suggestive atmosphere of the
region, he merely wanted to find satisfactory explanations. 'A case in
point, I mean. I didn't like it quite--that farmhouse--yet I'm hanged
if I know why. It made me feel uncomfortable. That girl appeared so
suddenly, although the place seemed deserted. And her silence was so
odd. Why in the world couldn't she answer a single question? I'm glad I
didn't take the milk. I spat it out. I'd like to know where she got it
from, for there was no sign of a cow or a goat to be seen
anywhere!'</p>

<p>'I swallowed mine--in spite of the taste,' said the other, half
smiling at his companion's sudden volubility.</p>

<p>Very abruptly, then, the big man turned and faced his friend. Was it
merely an effect of the moonlight, or had his skin really turned pale
beneath the sunburn?</p>

<p>'I say, old man,' he said, his face grave and serious, 'What do you
think she was? What made her seem like that, and why the devil do you
think she followed us?'</p>

<p>'I think,' was the slow reply, 'it was me she was following.'</p>

<p>The words, and particularly the tone of conviction in which they
were spoken, clearly were displeasing to the big man, who already
regretted having spoken so frankly what was in his mind. With a
companion so imaginative, so impressionable, so nervous, it had been
foolish and unwise. He led the way home at a pace that made the other
arrive five minutes in his rear, panting, limping and perspiring as if
he had been running.</p>

<p>'I'm rather for going on into Switzerland tomorrow, or the next
day,' he ventured that night in the darkness of their two-bedded room.
'I think we've had enough of this place. Eh? What do you think?'</p>

<p>But there was no answer from the bed across the room, for its
occupant was sound asleep and snoring.</p>

<p>'Dead tired, I suppose!' he muttered to himself, and then turned
over to follow his friend's example. But for a long time sleep refused
him. Queer, unwelcome thoughts and feelings kept him awake--of a kind
he rarely knew, and thoroughly disliked. It was rubbish, yet it made
him uncomfortable so that his nerves tingled. He tossed about in the
bed. 'I'm overtired,' he persuaded himself, 'that's all.'</p>

<p>The strange feelings that kept him thus awake were not easy to
analyse, perhaps, but their origin was beyond all question: they
grouped themselves about the picture of that deserted, tumble-down
ch&acirc;let on the mountain ridge where they had stopped for
refreshment a few hours before. It was a farmhouse, dilapidated and
dirty, and the name stood in big black letters against a blue
background on the wall above the door: 'La Chenille.' Yet not a living
soul was to be seen anywhere about it; the doors were fastened, windows
shuttered; chimneys smokeless; dirt, neglect and decay everywhere in
evidence.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, as they had turned to go, after much vain shouting
and knocking at the door, a face appeared for an instant at a window,
the shutter of which was half open. His friend saw it first, and called
aloud. The face nodded in reply, and presently a young girl came round
the corner of the house, apparently by a back door, and stood staring
at them both from a little distance.</p>

<p>And from that very instant, so far as he could remember, these queer
feelings had entered his heart--fear, distrust, misgiving. The thought
of it now, as he lay in bed in the darkness, made his hair rise. There
was something about that girl that struck cold into the soul. Yet she
was a mere slip of a thing, very pretty, seductive even, with a certain
serpent-like fascination about her eyes and movements; and although she
only replied to their questions as to refreshment with a smile,
uttering no single word, she managed to convey the impression that she
was a managing little person who might make herself very disagreeable
if she chose. In spite of her undeniable charm there was about her an
atmosphere of something sinister. He himself did most of the
questioning, but it was his older friend who had the benefit of her
smile. Her eyes hardly ever left his face, and once she had slipped
quite close to him and touched his arm.</p>

<p>The strange part of it now seemed to him that he could not remember
in the least how she was dressed, or what was the colouring of her eyes
and hair. It was almost as though he had felt, rather than seen, her
presence.</p>

<p>The milk--she produced a jug and two wooden bowls after a brief
disappearance round the corner of the house--was--well, it tasted so
odd that he had been unable to swallow it, and had spat it out. His
friend, on the other hand, savage with thirst, had drunk his bowl to
the last drop too quickly to taste it even, and, while he drank, had
kept his eyes fixed on those of the girl, who stood close in front of
him.</p>

<p>And from that moment his friend had somehow changed. On the way down
he said things that were unusual, talking chiefly about the 'Chenille,'
and the girl, and the delicious, delicate flavour of the milk, yet all
phrased in such a way that it sounded singular, unfamiliar, unpleasant
even.</p>

<p>Now that he tried to recall the sentences the actual words evaded
him; but the memory of the uneasiness and apprehension they caused him
to feel remained. And night ever italicizes such memories!</p>

<p>Then, to cap it all, the girl had followed them. It was wholly
foolish and absurd to feel the things he did feel; yet there the
feelings were, and what was the good of arguing? That girl frightened
him; the change in his friend was in some way or other a danger signal.
More than this he could not tell. An explanation might come later, but
for the present his chief desire was to get away from the place and to
get his friend away, too.</p>

<p>And on this thought sleep overtook him--heavily.</p>

<p>The windows were wide open; outside was a garden with a rather high
enclosing wall, and at the far end a gate that was kept locked because
it led into private fields and so, by a back way, to the cemetery and
the little church. When it was open the guests of the inn made use of
it and got lost in the network of fields and vines, for there was no
proper route that way to the road or the mountains. They usually ended
up prematurely in the cemetery, and got back to the village by passing
through the church, which was always open; or by knocking at the
kitchen doors of the other houses and explaining their position. Hence
the gate was locked now to save trouble.</p>

<p>After several hours of hot, unrefreshing sleep the big man turned in
his bed and woke. He tried to stretch, but couldn't; then sat up
panting with a sense of suffocation. And by the faint starlight of the
summer night, he saw next that his friend was up and moving about the
room.</p>

<p>Remembering that sometimes he walked in his sleep, he called to him
gently:</p>

<p>'Morton, old chap,' he said in a low voice, with a touch of
authority in it, 'go back to bed! You've walked enough for one
day!'</p>

<p>And the figure, obeying as sleep-walkers often will, passed across
the room and disappeared among the shadows over his bed. The other
plunged and burrowed himself into a comfortable position again for
sleep, but the heat of the room, the shortness of the bed, and this
tiresome interruption of his slumbers made it difficult to lose
consciousness. He forced his eyes to keep shut, and his body to cease
from fidgeting, but there was something nibbling at his mind like a
spirit mouse that never permitted him to cross the frontier into actual
oblivion. He slept with one eye open, as the saying is. Odours of hay
and flowers and baked ground stole in through the open window; with
them, too, came from time to time sounds--little sounds that disturbed
him without being ever loud enough to claim definite attention.</p>

<p>Perhaps, after all, he did lose consciousness for a moment--when,
suddenly, a thought came with a sharp rush into his mind and galvanized
him once more into utter wakefulness. It amazed him that he had not
grasped it before. It was this: the figure he had seen was not the
figure of his friend.</p>

<p>Alarm gripped him at once before he could think or argue, and a cold
perspiration broke out all over his body. He fumbled for matches,
couldn't find them; then, remembering there was electric light, he
scraped the wall with his fingers--and turned on the little white
switch. In the sudden glare that filled the room he saw instantly that
his friend's bed was no longer occupied. And his mind, then acting
instinctively, without process of conscious reasoning, flew like a
flash to their walk of the day--to the tumble-down. 'Chenille,' the
glass of milk, the odd behaviour of his friend, and--to the girl.</p>

<p>At the same second he noticed that the odour in the room which
hitherto he had taken to be the composite odour of fields, flowers and
night, was really something else: it was the odour of freshly turned
earth. Immediately on the top of this discovery came another. Those
slight sounds he had heard outside the window were not ordinary
night-sounds, the murmur of wind and insects: they were footsteps
moving softly, stealthily down the little paths of crushed granite.</p>

<p>He was dressed in wonderful short order, noticing as he did so that
his friend's night-garments lay upon the bed, and that he, too, had
therefore dressed; further--that the door had been unlocked and stood
half an inch ajar. There was now no question that he had slept again:
between the present and the moment when he had seen the figure there
had been a considerable interval. A couple of minutes later he had made
his way cautiously downstairs and was standing on the garden path in
the moonlight. And as he stood there, his mind filled with the stories
the proprietor had told a few days before of the superstitions that
still lived in the popular imagination and haunted this little, remote
pine-clad valley. The thought of that girl sickened him. The odour of
newly-turned earth remained in his nostrils and made his gorge rise.
Utterly and vigorously he rejected the monstrous fictions he had heard,
yet for all that, could not prevent their touching his imagination as
he stood there in the early hours of the morning, alone with night and
silence. The spell was undeniable; only a mind without sensibility
could have ignored it.</p>

<p>He searched the little garden from end to end. Empty! Opposite the
high gate he stopped, peering through the iron bars, wet with dew to
his hands. Far across the intervening fields he fancied something
moved. A second later he was sure of it. Something down there to the
right beyond the trees was astir. It was in the cemetery.</p>

<p>And this definite discovery sent a shudder of terror and disgust
through him from head to foot.</p>

<p>He framed the name of his friend with his lips, yet the sound did
not come forth. Some deeper instinct warned him to hold it back.
Instead, after incredible efforts, he climbed that iron gate and
dropped down into the soaking grass upon the other side. Then, taking
advantage of all the cover he could find, he ran, swiftly and
stealthily, towards the cemetery. On the way, without quite knowing why
he did so, he picked up a heavy stick; and a moment later he stood
beside the low wall that separated the fields from the
churchyard--stood and stared.</p>

<p>There, beside the tombstones, with their hideous metal wreaths and
crowns of faded flowers, he made out the figure of his friend; he was
stooping, crouched down upon the ground; behind him rose a couple of
bushy yew trees, against the dark of which his form was easily visible.
He was not alone; in front of him, bending close over him it seemed,
was another figure--a slight, shadowy, slim figure.</p>

<p>This time the big man found his voice and called aloud:</p>

<p>'Morton, Morton!' he cried. 'What, in the name of heaven, are you
doing? What's the matter?'</p>

<p>And the instant his deep voice broke the stillness of the night with
its clamour, the little figure, half hiding his friend, turned about
and faced him. He saw a white face with shining eyes and teeth as the
form rose; the moonlight painted it with its own strange pallor; it was
weird, unreal, horrible; and across the mouth, downwards from the lips
to the chin, ran a deep stain of crimson.</p>

<p>The next moment the figure slid with a queer, gliding motion towards
the trees, and disappeared among the yews and tombstones in the
direction of the church. The heavy stick, hurled whirling after it,
fell harmlessly halfway, knocking a metal cross from its perch upon an
upright grave; and the man who had thrown it raced full speed towards
the huddled up figure of his friend, hardly noticing the thin, wailing
cry that rose trembling through the night air from the vanished form.
Nor did he notice more particularly that several of the graves, newly
made, showed signs of recent disturbance, and that the odour of turned
earth he had noticed in the room grew stronger. All his attention was
concentrated upon the figure at his feet.</p>

<p>'Morton, man, get up! Wake for God's sake! You've been walking
in--'</p>

<p>Then the words died upon his lips. The unnatural attitude of his
friend's shoulders, and the way the head dropped back to show the neck,
struck him like a blow in the face. There was no sign of movement. He
lifted the body up and carried it, all limp and unresisting, by ways he
never remembered afterwards, back to the inn.</p>

<p>It was all a dreadful nightmare--a nightmare that carried over its
ghastly horror into waking life. He knew that the proprietor and his
wife moved busily to and fro about the bed, and that in due course the
village doctor was upon the scene, and that he was giving a muddled and
feverish description of all he knew, telling how his friend was a
confirmed sleep-walker and all the rest.</p>

<p>But he did not realize the truth until he saw the face of the doctor
as he straightened up from the long examination.</p>

<p>'Will you wake him?' he heard himself asking, 'or let him sleep it
out till morning?' And the doctor's expression, even before the reply
came to confirm it, told him the truth. 'Ah, monsieur, your friend will
not ever wake again, I fear! It is the heart, you see; h&eacute;las, it
is sudden failure of the heart!' The final scenes in the little tragedy
which thus brought his holiday to so abrupt and terrible a close need
no description, being in no way essential to this strange story. There
were one or two curious details, however, that came to light
afterwards. One was, that for some weeks before there had been signs of
disturbance among newly-made graves in the cemetery, which the
authorities had been trying to trace to the nightly wanderings of the
village madman--in vain; and another, that the morning after the death
a trail of blood had been found across the church floor, as though
someone had passed through from the back entrance to the front. A
special service was held that very week to cleanse the holy building
from the evil of that stain; for the villagers, deep in their
superstitions, declared that nothing human had left that trail; nothing
could have made those marks but a vampire disturbed at midnight in its
awful occupation among the dead.</p>

<p>Apart from such idle rumours, however, the bereaved carried with him
to this day certain other remarkable details which cannot be so easily
dismissed. For he had a brief conversation with the doctor, it appears,
that impressed him profoundly. And the doctor, an intelligent man,
prosaic as granite into the bargain, had questioned him rather closely
as to the recent life and habits of his dead friend. The account of
their climb to the 'Chenille' he heard with an amazement he could not
conceal.</p>

<p>'But no such chalet exists,' he said. 'There is no "Chenille". A
long time ago, fifty years or more, there was such a place, but it was
destroyed by the authorities on account of the evil reputation of the
people who lived there. They burnt it. Nothing remains today but a few
bits of broken wall and foundation.'</p>

<p>'Evil reputation--?'</p>

<p>The doctor shrugged his shoulders 'Travellers, even peasants,
disappeared,' he said. 'An old woman lived there with her daughter, and
poisoned milk was supposed to be used. But the neighbourhood accused
them of worse than ordinary murder--'</p>

<p>'In what way?'</p>

<p>'Said the girl was a vampire,' answered the doctor shortly.</p>

<p>And, after a moment's hesitation, he added, turning his face away as
he spoke:</p>

<p>'It was a curious thing, though, that tiny hole in your friend's
throat, small as a pin-prick, yet so deep. And the heart--did I tell
you?--was almost completely drained of blood.'</p>

<h2><a name="ch16"></a>The Terror of the Twins</h2>

<p>That the man's hopes had built upon a son to inherit his name and
estates--a single son, that is--was to be expected; but no one could
have foreseen the depth and bitterness of his disappointment, the cold,
implacable fury, when there arrived instead--twins. For, though the
elder legally must inherit, that other ran him so deadly close. A
daughter would have been a more reasonable defeat. But twins--! To miss
his dream by so feeble a device--!</p>

<p>The complete frustration of a hope deeply cherished for years may
easily result in strange fevers of the soul, but the violence of the
father's hatred, existing as it did side by side with a love he could
not deny, was something to set psychologists thinking. More than
unnatural, it was positively uncanny. Being a man of rigid
self-control, however, it operated inwardly, and doubtless along some
morbid line of weakness little suspected even by those nearest to him,
preying upon his thought to such dreadful extent that finally the mind
gave way. The suppressed rage and bitterness deprived him, so the
family decided, of his reason, and he spent the last years of his life
under restraint. He was possessed naturally of immense forces--of will,
feeling, desire; his dynamic value truly tremendous, driving through
life like a great engine; and the intensity of this concentrated and
buried hatred was guessed by few. The twins themselves, however, knew
it. They divined it, at least, for it operated ceaselessly against them
side by side with the genuine soft love that occasionally sweetened it,
to their great perplexity. They spoke of it only to each other,
though.</p>

<p>'At twenty-one,' Edward, the elder, would remark sometimes,
unhappily, 'we shall know more.' 'Too much,' Ernest would reply, with a
rush of unreasoning terror the thought never failed to evoke--in him.
'Things father said always happened--in life.' And they paled
perceptibly. For the hatred, thus compressed into a veritable bomb of
psychic energy, had found at the last a singular expression in the cry
of the father's distraught mind. On the occasion of their final visit
to the asylum, preceding his death by a few hours only, very calmly,
but with an intensity that drove the words into their hearts like
points of burning metal, he had spoken. In the presence of the
attendant, at the door of the dreadful padded cell, he said it: 'You
are not two, but one. I still regard you as one. And at the coming of
age, by h--, you shall find it out!'</p>

<p>The lads perhaps had never fully divined that icy hatred which lay
so well concealed against them, but that this final sentence was a
curse, backed by all the man's terrific force, they quite well
realised; and accordingly, almost unknown to each other, they had come
to dread the day inexpressibly. On the morning of that twenty-first
birthday--their father gone these five years into the Unknown, yet
still sometimes so strangely close to them--they shared the same
biting, inner terror, just as they shared all other emotions of their
life--intimately, without speech.</p>

<p>During the daytime they managed to keep it at a distance; but when
the dusk fell about the old house they knew the stealthy approach of a
kind of panic sense. Their self-respect weakened swiftly...and they
persuaded their old friend, and once tutor, the vicar, to sit up with
them till midnight...He had humoured them to that extent, willing to
forgo his sleep, and at the same time more than a little interested in
their singular belief--that before the day was out, before midnight
struck, that is, the curse of that terrible man would somehow come into
operation against them.</p>

<p>Festivities over and the guests departed, they sat up in the
library, the room usually occupied by their father, and little used
since. Mr. Curtice, a robust man of fifty-five, and a firm believer in
spiritual principalities and powers, dark as well as good, affected
(for their own good) to regard the youths' obsession with a kindly
cynicism. 'I do not think it likely for one moment,' he said gravely,
'that such a thing would be permitted. All spirits are in the hands of
God, and the violent ones more especially.' To which Edward made the
extraordinary reply: 'Even if father does not come himself he
will--send!' And Ernest agreed: 'All this time he's been making
preparations for this very day. We've both known it for a long time--by
odd things that have happened, by our dreams, by nasty little dark
hints of various kinds, and by these persistent attacks of terror that
come from nowhere, especially of late. Haven't we, Edward?' Edward
assenting with a shudder. 'Father has been at us of late with renewed
violence. To-night it will be a regular assault upon our lives, or
minds, or souls!'</p>

<p>'Strong personalities may possibly leave behind them forces that
continue to act,' observed Mr. Curtice with caution, while the brothers
replied almost in the same breath: 'That's exactly what we feel so
curiously. Though--nothing has actually happened yet, you know, and
it's a good many years now since--'</p>

<p>This was the way the twins spoke of it all. And it was their
profound conviction that had touched their old friend's sense of duty.
The experiment should justify itself--and cure them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile none of the family knew. Everything was planned
secretly.</p>

<p>The library was the quietest room in the house. It had shuttered
bow-windows, thick carpets, heavy doors. Books lined the walls, and
there was a capacious open fireplace of brick in which the woodlogs
blazed and roared, for the autumn night was chilly. Round this the
three of them were grouped, the clergyman reading aloud from the Book
of Job in low tones; Edward and Ernest, in dinner-jackets, occupying
deep leather arm-chairs, listening. They looked exactly what they
were--Cambridge 'undergrads,' their faces pale against their dark hair,
and alike as two peas. A shaded lamp behind the clergyman threw the
rest of the room into shadow. The reading voice was steady, even
monotonous, but something in it betrayed an underlying anxiety, and
although the eyes rarely left the printed page, they took in every
movement of the young men opposite, and noted every change upon their
faces. It was his aim to produce an unexciting atmosphere, yet to miss
nothing; if anything did occur to see it from the very beginning. Not
to be taken by surprise was his main idea...And thus, upon this falsely
peaceful scene, the minutes passed the hour of eleven and slipped
rapidly along towards midnight.</p>

<p>The novel element in his account of this distressing and dreadful
occurrence seems to be that what happened--happened without the
slightest warning or preparation. There was no gradual presentiment of
any horror; no strange blast of cold air; no dwindling of heat or
light; no shaking of windows or mysterious tapping upon furniture.
Without preliminaries it fell with its black trappings of terror upon
the scene.</p>

<p>The clergyman had been reading aloud for some considerable time, one
or other of the twins--Ernest usually--making occasional remarks, which
proved that his sense of dread was disappearing. As the time grew short
and nothing happened they grew more at their ease.</p>

<p>Edward, indeed, actually nodded, dozed, and finally fell asleep. It
was a few minutes before midnight. Ernest, slightly yawning, was
stretching himself in the big chair. 'Nothing's going to happen,' he
said aloud, in a pause. 'Your good influence has prevented it.' He even
laughed now.</p>

<p>'What superstitious asses we've been, sir; haven't we--?'</p>

<p>Curtice, then, dropping his Bible, looked hard at him under the
lamp. For in that second, even while the words sounded, there had come
about a most abrupt and dreadful change; and so swiftly that the
clergyman, in spite of himself, was taken utterly by surprise and had
no time to think. There had swooped down upon the quiet library--so he
puts it--an immense hushing silence, so profound that the peace already
reigning there seemed clamour by comparison; and out of this enveloping
stillness there rose through the space about them a living and
abominable Invasion--soft, motionless, terrific. It was as though vast
engines, working at full speed and pressure, yet too swift and delicate
to be appreciable to any definite sense, had suddenly dropped down upon
them--from nowhere. 'It made me think,' the vicar used to say
afterwards, 'of the Mauretania machinery compressed into a nutshell,
yet losing none of its awful power.'</p>

<p>'...haven't we?' repeated Ernest, still laughing. And Curtice,
making no audible reply, heard the true answer in his heart: 'Because
everything has already happened--even as you feared.'</p>

<p>Yet, to the vicar's supreme astonishment, Ernest still
noticed--nothing!</p>

<p>'Look,' the boy added, 'Eddy's sound asleep--sleeping like a pig.
Doesn't say much for your reading, you know, sir!' And he laughed
again--lightly, even foolishly. But that laughter jarred, for the
clergyman understood now that the sleep of the elder twin was either
feigned--or unnatural.</p>

<p>And while the easy words fell so lightly from his lips, the
monstrous engines worked and pulsed against him and against his
sleeping brother, all their huge energy concentrated down into points
fine as Suggestion, delicate as Thought. The Invasion affected
everything. The very objects in the room altered incredibly, revealing
suddenly behind their normal exteriors horrid little hearts of
darkness. It was truly amazing, this vile metamorphosis. Books, chairs,
pictures, all yielded up their pleasant aspect, and betrayed, as with
silent mocking laughter, their inner soul of blackness--their decay.
This is how Curtice tries to body forth in words what he actually
witnessed...And Ernest, yawning, talking lightly, half foolishly--still
noticed nothing!</p>

<p>For all this, as described, came about in something like ten
seconds; and with it swept into the clergyman's mind, like a blow, the
memory of that sinister phrase used more than once by Edward: 'If
father doesn't come, he will certainly--send.' And Curtice understood
that he had done both--both sent and come himself...That violent mind,
released from its spell of madness in the body, yet still retaining the
old implacable hatred, was now directing the terrible, unseen assault.
This silent room, so hushed and still, was charged to the brim. The
horror of it, as he said later, 'seemed to peel the very skin from my
back.'...And, while Ernest noticed nothing, Edward slept!...The soul of
the clergyman, strong with the desire to help or save, yet realising
that he was alone against a Legion, poured out in wordless prayer to
his Deity. The clock just then, whirring before it struck, made itself
audible.</p>

<p>'By Jove! It's all right, you see!' exclaimed Ernest, his voice
oddly fainter and lower than before. 'There's midnight--and nothing's
happened. Bally nonsense, all of it!' His voice had dwindled curiously
in volume. 'I'll get the whisky and soda from the hall.' His relief was
great and his manner showed it. But in him somewhere was a singular
change. His voice, manner, gestures, his very tread as he moved over
the thick carpet toward the door, all showed it. He seemed less real,
less alive, reduced somehow to littleness, the voice without timbre or
quality, the appearance of him diminished in some fashion quite
ghastly. His presence, if not actually shrivelled, was at least
impaired. Ernest had suffered a singular and horrible decrease...</p>

<p>The clock was still whirring before the strike. One heard the chain
running up softly. Then the hammer fell upon the first stroke of
midnight.</p>

<p>'I'm off,' he laughed faintly from the door; 'it's all been pure
funk--on my part, at least...!'</p>

<p>He passed out of sight into the hall. The Power that throbbed so
mightily about the room followed him out. Almost at the same moment
Edward woke up. But he woke with a tearing and indescribable cry of
pain and anguish on his lips: 'Oh, oh, oh! But it hurts! It hurts! I
can't hold you; leave me. It's breaking me asunder--'</p>

<p>The clergyman had sprung to his feet, but in the same instant
everything had become normal once more--the room as it was before, the
horror gone. There was nothing he could do or say, for there was no
longer anything to put right, to defend, or to attack. Edward was
speaking; his voice, deep and full as it never had been before: 'By
Jove, how that sleep has refreshed me! I feel twice the chap I was
before--twice the chap. I feel quite splendid. Your voice, sir, must
have hypnotised me to sleep...' He crossed the room with great vigour.
'Where's--er--where's--Ernie, by the bye?' he asked casually,
hesitating--almost searching--for the name. And a shadow as of a
vanished memory crossed his face and was gone. The tone conveyed the
most complete indifference where once the least word or movement of his
twin had wakened solicitude, love. 'Gone away, I suppose--gone to bed,
I mean, of course.'</p>

<p>Curtice has never been able to describe the dreadful conviction that
overwhelmed him as he stood there staring, his heart in his mouth--the
conviction, the positive certainty, that Edward had changed interiorly,
had suffered an incredible accession to his existing personality. But
he knew it as he watched. His mind, spirit, soul had most wonderfully
increased. Something that hitherto the lad had known from the outside
only, or by the magic of loving sympathy, had now passed, to be
incorporated with his own being. And, being himself, it required no
expression. Yet this visible increase was somehow terrible. Curtice
shrank back from him. The instinct--he has never grasped the profound
psychology of that, nor why it turned his soul dizzy with a kind of
nausea--the instinct to strike him where he stood, passed, and a
plaintive sound from the hall, stealing softly into the room between
them, sent all that was left to him of self-possession into his feet.
He turned and ran. Edward followed him--very leisurely.</p>

<p>They found Ernest, or what had been Ernest, crouching behind the
table in the hall, weeping foolishly to himself. On his face lay
blackness. The mouth was open, the jaw dropped; he dribbled hopelessly;
and from the face had passed all signs of intelligence--of spirit.</p>

<p>For a few weeks he lingered on, regaining no sign of spiritual or
mental life before the poor body, hopelessly disorganised, released
what was left of him, from pure inertia--from complete and utter loss
of vitality.</p>

<p>And the horrible thing--so the distressed family thought, at
least--was that all those weeks Edward showed an indifference that was
singularly brutal and complete. He rarely even went to visit him. I
believe, too, it is true that he only once spoke of him by name; and
that was when he said--'Ernie? Oh, but Ernie is much better and happier
where he is--!'</p>

<h2><a name="ch17"></a>The Transfer</h2>

<p>The child began to cry in the early afternoon--about three o'clock,
to be exact. I remember the hour, because I had been listening with
secret relief to the sound of the departing carriage. Those wheels
fading into the distance down the gravel drive with Mrs. Frene, and her
daughter Gladys to whom I was governess, meant for me some hours'
welcome rest, and the June day was oppressively hot. Moreover, there
was this excitement in the little country household that had told upon
us all, but especially upon myself. This excitement, running delicately
behind all the events of the morning, was due to some mystery, and the
mystery was of course kept concealed from the governess. I had
exhausted myself with guessing and keeping on the watch. For some deep
and unexplained anxiety possessed me, so that I kept thinking of my
sister's dictum that I was really much too sensitive to make a good
governess, and that I should have done far better as a professional
clairvoyante.</p>

<p>Mr. Frene, senior, "Uncle Frank," was expected for an unusual visit
from town about tea-time. That I knew. I also knew that his visit was
concerned somehow with the future welfare of little Jamie, Gladys'
seven-year-old brother. More than this, indeed, I never knew, and this
missing link makes my story in a fashion incoherent--an important bit
of the strange puzzle left out. I only gathered that the visit of Uncle
Frank was of a condescending nature, that Jamie was told he must be
upon his very best behavior to make a good impression, and that Jamie,
who had never seen his uncle, dreaded him horribly already in advance.
Then, trailing thinly through the dying crunch of the carriage wheels
this sultry afternoon, I heard the curious little wail of the child's
crying, with the effect, wholly unaccountable, that every nerve in my
body shot its bolt electrically, bringing me to my feet with a tingling
of unequivocal alarm. Positively, the water ran into my eyes. I
recalled his white distress that morning when told that Uncle Frank was
motoring down for tea and that he was to be "very nice indeed" to him.
It had gone into me like a knife. All through the day, indeed, had run
this nightmare quality of terror and vision.</p>

<p>"The man with the 'normous face?" he had asked in a little voice of
awe, and then gone speechless from the room in tears that no amount of
soothing management could calm. That was all I saw; and what he meant
by "the 'normous face" gave me only a sense of vague presentiment. But
it came as anticlimax somehow--a sudden revelation of the mystery and
excitement that pulsed beneath the quiet of the stifling summer day. I
feared for him. For of all that commonplace household I loved Jamie
best, though professionally I had nothing to do with him. He was a
high-strung, ultra-sensitive child, and it seemed to me that no one
understood him, least of all his honest, tender-hearted parents; so
that his little wailing voice brought me from my bed to the window in a
moment like a call for help.</p>

<p>The haze of June lay over that big garden like a blanket; the
wonderful flowers, which were Mr. Frene's delight, hung motionless; the
lawns, so soft and thick, cushioned all other sounds; only the limes
and huge clumps of guelder roses hummed with bees. Through this muted
atmosphere of heat and haze the sound of the child's crying floated
faintly to my ears--from a distance. Indeed, I wonder now that I heard
it at all, for the next moment I saw him down beyond the garden,
standing in his white sailor suit alone, two hundred yards away. He was
down by the ugly patch where nothing grew--the Forbidden Corner. A
faintness then came over me at once, a faintness as of death, when I
saw him there of all places--where he never was allowed to go, and
where, moreover, he was usually too terrified to go. To see him
standing solitary in that singular spot, above all to hear him crying
there, bereft me momentarily of the power to act. Then, before I could
recover my composure sufficiently to call him in, Mr. Frene came round
the corner from the Lower Farm with the dogs, and, seeing his son,
performed that office for me. In his loud, good-natured, hearty voice
he called him, and Jamie turned and ran as though some spell had broken
just in time--ran into the open arms of his fond but uncomprehending
father, who carried him indoors on his shoulder, while asking "what all
this hubbub was about?" And, at their heels, the tailless sheep-dogs
followed, barking loudly, and performing what Jamie called their
"Gravel Dance," because they ploughed up the moist, rolled gravel with
their feet.</p>

<p>I stepped back swiftly from the window lest I should be seen. Had I
witnessed the saving of the child from fire or drowning the relief
could hardly have been greater. Only Mr. Frene, I felt sure, would not
say and do the right thing quite. He would protect the boy from his own
vain imaginings, yet not with the explanation that could really heal.
They disappeared behind the rose trees, making for the house. I saw no
more till later, when Mr. Frene, senior, arrived.</p>

<p>To describe the ugly patch as "singular" is hard to justify,
perhaps, yet some such word is what the entire family sought, though
never--oh, never!--used. To Jamie and myself, though equally we never
mentioned it, that treeless, flowerless spot was more than singular. It
stood at the far end of the magnificent rose garden, a bald, sore
place, where the black earth showed uglily in winter, almost like a
piece of dangerous bog, and in summer baked and cracked with fissures
where green lizards shot their fire in passing. In contrast to the rich
luxuriance of death amid life, a center of disease that cried for
healing lest it spread. But it never did spread. Behind it stood the
thick wood of silver birches and, glimmering beyond, the orchard
meadow, where the lambs played.</p>

<p>The gardeners had a very simple explanation of its barrenness--that
the water all drained off it owing to the lie of the slopes immediately
about it, holding no remnant to keep the soil alive. I cannot say. It
was Jamie--Jamie who felt its spell and haunted it, who spent whole
hours there, even while afraid, and for whom it was finally labelled
"strictly out of bounds" because it stimulated his already big
imagination, not wisely but too darkly--it was Jamie who buried ogres
there and heard it crying in an earthy voice, swore that it shook its
surface sometimes while he watched it, and secretly gave it food in the
form of birds or mice or rabbits he found dead upon his wanderings. And
it was Jamie who put so extraordinarily into words the feeling that the
horrid spot had given me from the moment I first saw it.</p>

<p>"It's bad, Miss Gould," he told me.</p>

<p>"But, Jamie, nothing in Nature is bad--exactly; only different from
the rest sometimes."</p>

<p>"Miss Gould, if you please, then it's empty. It's not fed. It's
dying because it can't get the food it wants."</p>

<p>And when I stared into the little pale face where the eyes shone so
dark and wonderful, seeking within myself for the right thing to say to
him, he added, with an emphasis and conviction that made me suddenly
turn cold: "Miss Gould"--he always used my name like this in all his
sentences--"it's hungry, don't you see? But I know what would make it
feel all right."</p>

<p>Only the conviction of an earnest child, perhaps, could have made so
outrageous a suggestion worth listening to for an instant; but for me,
who felt that things an imaginative child believed were important, it
came with a vast disquieting shock of reality. Jamie, in this
exaggerated way, had caught at the edge of a shocking fact--a hint of
dark, undiscovered truth had leaped into that sensitive imagination.
Why there lay horror in the words I cannot say, but I think some power
of darkness trooped across the suggestion of that sentence at the end,
"I know what would make it feel all right." I remember that I shrank
from asking explanation. Small groups of other words, veiled
fortunately by his silence, gave life to an unspeakable possibility
that hitherto had lain at the back of my own consciousness. The way it
sprang to life proves, I think, that my mind already contained it. The
blood rushed from my heart as I listened. I remember that my knees
shook. Jamie's idea was--had been all along--my own as well.</p>

<p>And now, as I lay down on my bed and thought about it all, I
understood why the coming of his uncle involved somehow an experience
that wrapped terror at its heart. With a sense of nightmare certainty
that left me too weak to resist the preposterous idea, too shocked,
indeed, to argue or reason it away, this certainty came with its full,
black blast of conviction; and the only way I can put it into words,
since nightmare horror really is not properly tellable at all, seems
this: that there was something missing in that dying patch of garden;
something lacking that it ever searched for; something, once found and
taken, that would turn it rich and living as the rest; more--that there
was some living person who could do this for it. Mr. Frene, senior, in
a word, "Uncle Frank," was this person who out of his abundant life
could supply the lack--unwittingly.</p>

<p>For this connection between the dying, empty patch and the person of
this vigorous, wealthy, and successful man had already lodged itself in
my subconsciousness before I was aware of it. Clearly it must have lain
there all along, though hidden. Jamie's words, his sudden pallor, his
vibrating emotion of fearful anticipation had developed the plate, but
it was his weeping alone there in the Forbidden Corner that had printed
it. The photograph shone framed before me in the air. I hid my eyes.
But for the redness--the charm of my face goes to pieces unless my eyes
are clear--I could have cried. Jamie's words that morning about the
"'normous face" came back upon me like a battering-ram.</p>

<p>Mr. Frene, senior, had been so frequently the subject of
conversation in the family since I came, I had so often heard him
discussed, and had then read so much about him in the papers--his
energy, his philanthropy, his success with everything he laid his hand
to--that a picture of the man had grown complete within me. I knew him
as he was--within; or, as my sister would have said--clairvoyantly. And
the only time I saw him (when I took Gladys to a meeting where he was
chairman, and later felt his atmosphere and presence while for a moment
he patronizingly spoke with her) had justified the portrait I had
drawn. The rest, you may say, was a woman's wild imagining; but I think
rather it was that kind of divining intuition which women share with
children. If souls could be made visible, I would stake my life upon
the truth and accuracy of my portrait.</p>

<p>For this Mr. Frene was a man who drooped alone, but grew vital in a
crowd--because he used their vitality. He was a supreme, unconscious
artist in the science of taking the fruits of others' work and
living--for his own advantage. He vampired, unknowingly no doubt, every
one with whom he came in contact; left them exhausted, tired, listless.
Others fed him, so that while in a full room he shone, alone by himself
and with no life to draw upon he languished and declined. In the man's
immediate neighborhood you felt his presence draining you; he took your
ideas, your strength, your very words, and later used them for his own
benefit and aggrandizement. Not evilly, of course; the man was good
enough; but you felt that he was dangerous owing to the facile way he
absorbed into himself all loose vitality that was to be had. His eyes
and voice and presence devitalized you. Life, it seemed, not highly
organized enough to resist, must shrink from his too near approach and
hide away for fear of being appropriated, for fear, that is,
of--death.</p>

<p>Jamie, unknowingly, put in the finishing touch to my unconscious
portrait. The man carried about with him some silent, compelling trick
of drawing out all your reserves--then swiftly pocketing them. At first
you would be conscious of taut resistance; this would slowly shade off
into weariness; the will would become flaccid; then you either moved
away or yielded--agreed to all he said with a sense of weakness
pressing ever closer upon the edges of collapse. With a male antagonist
it might be different, but even then the effort of resistance would
generate force that he absorbed and not the other. He never gave out.
Some instinct taught him how to protect himself from that. To human
beings, I mean, he never gave out. This time it was a very different
matter. He had no more chance than a fly before the wheels of a
huge--what Jamie used to call--"attraction" engine.</p>

<p>So this was how I saw him--a great human sponge, crammed and soaked
with the life, or proceeds of life, absorbed from others--stolen. My
idea of a human vampire was satisfied. He went about carrying these
accumulations of the life of others. In this sense his "life" was not
really his own. For the same reason, I think, it was not so fully under
his control as he imagined.</p>

<p>And in another hour this man would be here. I went to the window. My
eye wandered to the empty patch, dull black there amid the rich
luxuriance of the garden flowers. It struck me as a hideous bit of
emptiness yawning to be filled and nourished. The idea of Jamie playing
round its bare edge was loathsome. I watched the big summer clouds
above, the stillness of the afternoon, the haze. The silence of the
overheated garden was oppressive. I had never felt a day so stifling,
motionless. It lay there waiting. The household, too, was
waiting--waiting for the coming of Mr. Frene from London in his big
motor-car.</p>

<p>And I shall never forget the sensation of icy shrinking and distress
with which I heard the rumble of the car. He had arrived. Tea was all
ready on the lawn beneath the lime trees, and Mrs. Frene and Gladys,
back from their drive, were sitting in wicker chairs. Mr. Frene,
junior, was in the hall to meet his brother, but Jamie, as I learned
afterwards, had shown such hysterical alarm, offered such bold
resistance, that it had been deemed wiser to keep him in his room.
Perhaps, after all, his presence might not be necessary. The visit
clearly had to do with something on the uglier side of life--money,
settlements, or what not; I never knew exactly; only that his parents
were anxious, and that Uncle Frank had to be propitiated. It does not
matter. That has nothing to do with the affair. What has to do with
it--or I should not be telling the story--is that Mrs. Frene sent for
me to come down "in my nice white dress, if I didn't mind," and that I
was terrified, yet pleased, because it meant that a pretty face would
be considered a welcome addition to the visitor's landscape. Also, most
odd it was, I felt my presence was somehow inevitable, that in some way
it was intended that I should witness what I did witness. And the
instant I came upon the lawn--I hesitate to set it down, it sounds so
foolish, disconnected--I could have sworn, as my eyes met his, that a
kind of sudden darkness came, taking the summer brilliance out of
everything, and that it was caused by troops of small black horses that
raced about us from his person--to attack.</p>

<p>After a first momentary approving glance he took no further notice
of me. The tea and talk went smoothly; I helped to pass the plates and
cups, filling in pauses with little undertalk to Gladys. Jamie was
never mentioned. Outwardly all seemed well, but inwardly everything was
awful--skirting the edge of things unspeakable, and so charged with
danger that I could not keep my voice from trembling when I spoke.</p>

<p>I watched his hard, bleak face; I noticed how thin he was, and the
curious, oily brightness of his steady eyes. They did not glitter, but
they drew you with a sort of soft, creamy shine like Eastern eyes. And
everything he said or did announced what I may dare to call the suction
of his presence. His nature achieved this result automatically. He
dominated us all, yet so gently that until it was accomplished no one
noticed it.</p>

<p>Before five minutes had passed, however, I was aware of one thing
only. My mind focussed exclusively upon it, and so vividly that I
marvelled the others did not scream, or run, or do something violent to
prevent it. And it was this; that, separated merely by some dozen yards
or so, this man, vibrating with the acquired vitality of others, stood
within easy reach of that spot of yawning emptiness, waiting and eager
to be filled. Earth scented her prey.</p>

<p>These two active "centers" were within fighting distance; he so
thin, so hard, so keen, yet really spreading large with the loose
"surround" of others' life he had appropriated, so practiced and
triumphant; that other so patient, deep, with so mighty a draw of the
whole earth behind it, and--ugh!--so obviously aware that its
opportunity at last had come.</p>

<p>I saw it all as plainly as though I watched two great animals
prepare for battle, both unconsciously; yet in some inexplicable way I
saw it, of course, within me, and not externally. The conflict would be
hideously unequal. Each side had already sent out emissaries, how long
before I could not tell, for the first evidence he gave that something
was going wrong with him was when his voice grew suddenly confused, he
missed his words, and his lips trembled a moment and turned flabby. The
next second his face betrayed that singular and horrid change, growing
somehow loose about the bones of the cheek, and larger, so that I
remembered Jamie's miserable phrase. The emissaries of the two
kingdoms, the human and the vegetable, had met, I make it out, in that
very second. For the first time in his long career of battening on
others, Mr. Frene found himself pitted against a vaster kingdom than he
knew and, so finding, shook inwardly in that little part that was his
definite actual self. He felt the huge disaster coming.</p>

<p>"Yes, John," he was saying, in his drawling, self-congratulating
voice, "Sir George gave me that car--gave it to me as a present. Wasn't
it char--?" and then broke off abruptly, stammered, drew breath, stood
up, and looked uneasily about him. For a second there was a gaping
pause. It was like the click which starts some huge machinery
moving--that instant's pause before it actually starts. The whole
thing, indeed, then went with the rapidity of machinery running down
and beyond control. I thought of a giant dynamo working silently and
invisible.</p>

<p>"What's that?" he cried, in a soft voice charged with alarm. "What's
that horrid place? And someone's crying there--who is it?"</p>

<p>He pointed to the empty patch. Then, before anyone could answer, he
started across the lawn towards it, going every minute faster. Before
anyone could move he stood upon the edge. He leaned over--peering down
into it.</p>

<p>It seemed a few hours passed, but really they were seconds, for time
is measured by the quality and not the quantity of sensations it
contains. I saw it all with merciless, photographic detail, sharply
etched amid the general confusion. Each side was intensely active, but
only one side, the human, exerted all its force--in resistance. The
other merely stretched out a feeler, as it were, from its vast,
potential strength; no more was necessary. It was such a soft and easy
victory. Oh, it was rather pitiful! There was no bluster or great
effort, on one side at least. Close by his side I witnessed it, for I,
it seemed, alone had moved and followed him. No one else stirred,
though Mrs. Frene clattered noisily with the cups, making some sudden
impulsive gesture with her hands, and Gladys, I remember, gave a
cry--it was like a little scream--"Oh, mother, it's the heat, isn't
it?" Mr. Frene, her father, was speechless, pale as ashes.</p>

<p>But the instant I reached his side, it became clear what had drawn
me there thus instinctively. Upon the other side, among the silver
birches, stood little Jamie. He was watching. I experienced--for
him--one of those moments that shake the heart; a liquid fear ran all
over me, the more effective because unintelligible really. Yet I felt
that if I could know all, and what lay actually behind, my fear would
be more than justified; that the thing was awful, full of awe.</p>

<p>And then it happened--a truly wicked sight--like watching a universe
in action, yet all contained within a small square foot of space. I
think he understood vaguely that if someone could only take his place
he might be saved, and that was why, discerning instinctively the
easiest substitute within reach, he saw the child and called aloud to
him across the empty patch, "James, my boy, come here!"</p>

<p>His voice was like a thin report, but somehow flat and lifeless, as
when a rifle misses fire, sharp, yet weak; it had no "crack" in it. It
was really supplication. And, with amazement, I heard my own ring out
imperious and strong, though I was not conscious of saying it, "Jamie,
don't move. Stay where you are!" But Jamie, the little child, obeyed
neither of us. Moving up nearer to the edge, he stood there--laughing!
I heard that laughter, but could have sworn it did not come from him.
The empty, yawning patch gave out that sound.</p>

<p>Mr. Frene turned sideways, throwing up his arms. I saw his hard,
bleak face grow somehow wider, spread through the air, and downwards. A
similar thing, I saw, was happening at the same time to his entire
person, for it drew out into the atmosphere in a stream of movement.
The face for a second made me think of those toys of green india rubber
that children pull. It grew enormous. But this was an external
impression only. What actually happened, I clearly understood, was that
all this vitality and life he had transferred from others to himself
for years was now in turn being taken from him and
transferred--elsewhere.</p>

<p>One moment on the edge he wobbled horribly, then with that queer
sideways motion, rapid yet ungainly, he stepped forward into the middle
of the patch and fell heavily upon his face. His eyes, as he dropped,
faded shockingly, and across the countenance was written plainly what I
can only call an expression of destruction. He looked utterly
destroyed. I caught a sound--from Jamie?--but this time not of
laughter. It was like a gulp; it was deep and muffled and it dipped
away into the earth. Again I thought of a troop of small black horses
galloping away down a subterranean passage beneath my feet--plunging
into the depths--their tramping growing fainter and fainter into buried
distance. In my nostrils was a pungent smell of earth.</p>

<p>And then--all passed. I came back into myself. Mr. Frene, junior,
was lifting his brother's head from the lawn where he had fallen from
the heat, close beside the tea-table. He had never really moved from
there. And Jamie, I learned afterwards, had been the whole time asleep
upon his bed upstairs, worn out with his crying and unreasoning alarm.
Gladys came running out with cold water, sponge and towel, brandy
too--all kinds of things. "Mother, it was the heat, wasn't it?" I heard
her whisper, but I did not catch Mrs. Frene's reply. From her face it
struck me that she was bordering on collapse herself. Then the butler
followed, and they just picked him up and carried him into the house.
He recovered even before the doctor came.</p>

<p>But the queer thing to me is that I was convinced the others all had
seen what I saw, only that no one said a word about it; and to this day
no one has said a word. And that was, perhaps, the most horrid part of
all.</p>

<p>From that day to this I have scarcely heard a mention of Mr. Frene,
senior. It seemed as if he dropped suddenly out of life. The papers
never mentioned him. His activities ceased, as it were. His after-life,
at any rate, became singularly ineffective. Certainly he achieved
nothing worth public mention. But it may be only that, having left the
employ of Mrs. Frene, there was no particular occasion for me to hear
anything.</p>

<p>The after-life of that empty patch of garden, however, was quite
otherwise. Nothing, so far as I know, was done to it by gardeners, or
in the way of draining it or bringing in new earth, but even before I
left in the following summer it had changed. It lay untouched, full of
great, luscious, driving weeds and creepers, very strong, full--fed,
and bursting thick with life.</p>

<h2><a name="ch18"></a>Transition</h2>

<p>John Mudbury was on his way home from the shops, his arms full of
Christmas Presents. It was after six o'clock and the streets were very
crowded. He was an ordinary man, lived in an ordinary suburban flat,
with an ordinary wife and ordinary children. He did not think them
ordinary, but everybody else did. He had ordinary presents for each
one, a cheap blotter for his wife, a cheap air-gun for the boy, and so
forth. He was over fifty, bald, in an office, decent in mind and
habits, of uncertain opinions, uncertain politics, and uncertain
religion. Yet he considered himself a decided, positive gentleman,
quite unaware that the morning newspaper determined his opinions for
the day. He just lived--from day to day. Physically, he was fit enough,
except for a weak heart (which never troubled him); and his summer
holiday was bad golf, while the children bathed and his wife read
Garvice on the sands. Like the majority of men, he dreamed idly of the
past, muddled away the present, and guessed vaguely--after imaginative
reading on occasions--at the future.</p>

<p>'I'd like to survive all right,' he said, 'provided it's better than
this,' surveying his wife and children, and thinking of his daily toil.
'Otherwise--!' and he shrugged his shoulders as a brave man should.</p>

<p>He went to church regularly. But nothing in church convinced him
that he did survive, just as nothing in church enticed him into hoping
that he would. On the other hand, nothing in life persuaded him that he
didn't, wouldn't, couldn't. 'I'm an Evolutionist,' he loved to say to
thoughtful cronies (over a glass), having never heard that Darwinism
had been questioned.</p>

<p>And so he came home gaily, happily, with his bunch of Christmas
Presents 'for the wife and little ones,' stroking himself upon their
keen enjoyment and excitement. The night before he had taken 'the wife'
to see Magic at a select London theatre where the Intellectuals
went--and had been extraordinarily stirred. He had gone questioningly,
yet expecting something out of the common. 'It's not musical,' he
warned her, 'nor farce, nor comedy, so to speak'; and in answer to her
question as to what the critics had said, he had wriggled, sighed, and
put his gaudy neck-tie straight four times in quick succession. For no
Man in the Street, with any claim to self-respect, could be expected to
understand what the critics had said, even if he understood the Play.
And John had answered truthfully: 'Oh, they just said things. But the
theatre's always full--and that's the only test.'</p>

<p>And just now, as he crossed the crowded Circus to catch his 'bus, it
chanced that his mind (having glimpsed an advertisement) was full of
this particular Play, or rather, of the effect it had produced upon him
at the time. For it had thrilled him--inexplicably: with its marvellous
speculative hint, its big audacity, its alert and spiritual
beauty...Thought plunged to find something--plunged after this bizarre
suggestion of a bigger universe, after this quasi-jocular suggestion
that man is not the only--then dashed full-tilt against a sentence that
memory thrust beneath his nose: 'Science does not exhaust the
Universe'--and at the same time dashed full-tilt against destruction of
another kind as well...!</p>

<p>How it happened he never exactly knew. He saw a Monster glaring at
him with eyes of blazing fire. It was horrible! It rushed upon him. He
dodged...Another Monster met him round the corner. Both came at him
simultaneously. He dodged again--a leap that might have cleared a
hurdle easily, but was too late. Between the pair of them--his heart
literally in his gullet--he was mercilessly caught. Bones
crunched...There was a soft sensation, icy cold and hot as fire.</p>

<p>Horns and voices roared. Battering-rams he saw, and a carapace of
iron...Then dazzling light...</p>

<p>'Always face the traffic!' he remembered with a frantic yell--and,
by some extraordinary luck, escaped miraculously on to the opposite
pavement.</p>

<p>There was no doubt about it. By the skin of his teeth he had dodged
a rather ugly death. First...he felt for his Presents--all were safe.
And then, instead of congratulating himself and taking breath, he
hurried homewards--on foot, which proved that his mind had lost control
a bit!--thinking only how disappointed the wife and children would have
been if--well, if anything had happened. Another thing he realised,
oddly enough, was that he no longer really loved his wife, but had only
great affection for her. What made him think of that, Heaven only
knows, but he did think of it. He was an honest man without pretence.
This came as a discovery somehow. He turned a moment, and saw the crowd
gathered about the entangled taxi-cabs, policemen's helmets gleaming in
the lights of the shop windows...then hurried on again, his thoughts
full of the joy his Presents would give...of the scampering
children...and of his wife--bless her silly heart!--eyeing the
mysterious parcels...</p>

<p>And, though he never could explain how, he presently stood at the
door of the jail-like building that contained his flat, having walked
the whole three miles. His thoughts had been so busy and absorbed that
he had hardly noticed the length of weary trudge. 'Besides,' he
reflected, thinking of the narrow escape, 'I've had a nasty shock. It
was a d--d near thing, now I come to think of it...' He still felt a
bit shaky and bewildered. Yet, at the same time, he felt
extraordinarily jolly and lighthearted.</p>

<p>He counted his Christmas parcels.., hugged himself in anticipatory
joy...and let himself in swiftly with his latchkey. 'I'm late,' he
realised, 'but when she sees the brown-paper parcels, she'll forget to
say a word. God bless the old faithful soul.' And he softly used the
key a second time and entered his flat on tiptoe...In his mind was the
master impulse of that afternoon--the pleasure these Christmas Presents
would give his wife and children...</p>

<p>He heard a noise. He hung up hat and coat in the poky vestibule
(they never called it 'hall') and moved softly towards the parlour
door, holding the packages behind him. Only of them he thought, not of
himself--of his family, that is, not of the packages. Pushing the door
cunningly ajar, he peeped in slyly. To his amazement the room was full
of people. He withdrew quickly, wondering what it meant. A party? And
without his knowing about it! Extraordinary!...Keen disappointment came
over him. But, as he stepped back, the vestibule, he saw, was full of
people too.</p>

<p>He was uncommonly surprised, yet somehow not surprised at all.
People were congratulating him. There was a perfect mob of them.
Moreover, he knew them all--vaguely remembered them, at least. And they
all knew him.</p>

<p>'Isn't it a game?' laughed someone, patting him on the back. 'They
haven't the least idea...!'</p>

<p>And the speaker--it was old John Palmer, the book-keeper at the
office--emphasised the 'they.'</p>

<p>'Not the least idea,' he answered with a smile, saying something he
didn't understand, yet knew was right.</p>

<p>His face, apparently, showed the utter bewilderment he felt. The
shock of the collision had been greater than he realised evidently. His
mind was wandering...Possibly! Only the odd thing was--he had never
felt so clear-headed in his life. Ten thousand things grew simple
suddenly.</p>

<p>But, how thickly these people pressed about him, and
how--familiarly!</p>

<p>'My parcels,' he said, joyously pushing his way across the throng.
'These are Christmas Presents I've bought for them.' He nodded toward
the room. 'I've saved for weeks--stopped cigars and billiards and--and
several other good things--to buy them.'</p>

<p>'Good man!' said Palmer with a happy laugh. 'It's the heart that
counts.'</p>

<p>Mudbury looked at him. Palmer had said an amazing truth,
only--people would hardly understand and believe him...Would they?</p>

<p>'Eh?' he asked, feeling stuffed and stupid, muddied somewhere
between two meanings, one of which was gorgeous and the other stupid
beyond belief.</p>

<p>'If you please, Mr. Mudbury, step inside. They are expecting you,'
said a kindly, pompous voice. And, turning sharply, he met the gentle,
foolish eyes of Sir James Epiphany, a director of the Bank where he
worked.</p>

<p>The effect of the voice was instantaneous from long habit. 'They
are,' he smiled from his heart, and advanced as from the custom of many
years. Oh, how happy and gay he felt! His affection for his wife was
real. Romance, indeed, had gone, but he needed her--and she needed him.
And the children--Milly, Bill, and Jean--he deeply loved them. Life was
worth living indeed!</p>

<p>In the room was a crowd, but--an astounding silence. John Mudbury
looked round him. He advanced towards his wife, who sat in the corner
arm-chair with Milly on her knee. A lot people talked and moved about.
Momentarily the crowd increased. He stood in front of them--in front of
Milly and his wife. And he spoke--holding out his packages. 'It's
Christmas Eve,' he whispered shyly, 'and I've--brought you
something--something for everybody. Look!' He held the packages before
their eyes.</p>

<p>'Of course, of course,' said a voice behind him, 'but you may hold
them out like that for a century. They'll never see them!'</p>

<p>'Of course they won't. But I love to do the old, sweet thing,'
replied John Mudbury--then wondered with a gasp of stark amazement why
he said it.</p>

<p>'I think' whispered Milly, staring round her.</p>

<p>'Well, what do you think?' her mother asked sharply. 'You're always
thinking something queer.'</p>

<p>'I think,' the girl continued dreamily, 'that Daddy's already here.'
She paused, then added with a child's impossible conviction, 'I'm sure
he is. I feel him.'</p>

<p>There was an extraordinary laugh. Sir James Epiphany laughed. The
others--the whole crowd of them--also turned their heads and smiled.
But the mother, thrusting the child away from her, rose up suddenly
with a violent start. Her face had turned to chalk. She stretched her
arms out--into the air before her. She gasped and shivered. There was
anguish in her eyes.</p>

<p>'Look' repeated John, 'these are the Presents that I brought.'</p>

<p>But his voice apparently was soundless. And, with a spasm of icy
pain, he remembered that Palmer and Sir James--some years ago--had
died.</p>

<p>'It's magic,' he cried, 'but--I love you, Jinny--I love
you--and--and I have always been true to you--as true as steel. We need
each other--oh, can't you see--we go on together--you and I--for ever
and ever--'</p>

<p>'Think,' interrupted an exquisitely tender voice, 'don't shout! They
can't hear you--now.'</p>

<p>And, turning, John Mudbury met the eyes of Everard Minturn, their
President of the year before.</p>

<p>Minturn had gone down with the Titanic.</p>

<p>He dropped his parcels then. His heart gave an enormous leap of
joy.</p>

<p>He saw her face--the face of his wife--look through him.</p>

<p>But the child gazed straight into his eyes. She saw him..The next
thing he knew was that he heard something tinkling...far, far away. It
sounded miles below him--inside him--he was sounding himself--all
utterly bewildering--like a bell. It was a bell.</p>

<p>Milly stooped down and picked the parcels up. Her face shone with
happiness and laughter...</p>

<p>But a man came in soon after, a man with a ridiculous, solemn face,
a pencil, and a notebook.</p>

<p>He wore a dark blue helmet. Behind him came a string of other men.
They carried something...something...he could not see exactly what it
was. But, when he pressed forward through the laughing throng to gaze
upon it, he dimly made out two eyes, a nose, a chin, a deep red smear,
and a pair of folded hands upon and overcoat. A woman's form fell down
upon them then, and he heard soft sounds of children weeping strangely
...and other sounds...as of familiar voices laughing...laughing
gaily.</p>

<p>'They'll join us presently. It goes like a flash...'</p>

<p>And, turning with great happiness in his heart, he saw that Sir
James had said it, holding Palmer by the arm as with some natural yet
unexpected love of sympathetic friendship.</p>

<p>'Come on,' said Palmer, smiling like a man who accepts a gift in
universal fellowship, 'let's help 'em. They'll never
understand...Still, we can always try.'</p>

<p>The entire throng moved up with laughter and amusement. It was a
moment of hearty, genuine life at last. Delight and Joy and Peace were
everywhere.</p>

<p>Then John Mudbury realised the truth--that he was dead.</p>

<h2><a name="ch19"></a>The Tryst</h2>

<p>As he got out of the train at the little wayside station he
remembered the conversation as if it had been yesterday, instead of
fifteen years ago--and his heart went thumping against his ribs so
violently that he almost heard it. The original thrill came over him
again with all its infinite yearning. He felt it as he had felt it
then--not with that tragic lessening the interval had brought to each
repetition of its memory. Here, in the familiar scenery of its birth,
he realised with mingled pain and wonder that the subsequent years had
not destroyed, but only dimmed it. The forgotten rapture flamed back
with all the fierce beauty of its genesis, desire at white heat. And
the shock of the abrupt discovery shattered time. Fifteen years became
a negligible moment; the crowded experiences that had intervened seemed
but a dream. The farewell scene, the conversation on the steamer's
deck, were clear as of the day before. He saw the hand holding her big
hat that fluttered in the wind, saw the flowers on the dress where the
long coat was blown open a moment, recalled the face of a hurrying
steward who had jostled them; he even heard the voices--his own and
hers:</p>

<p>'Yes,' she said simply; 'I promise you. You have my word. I'll
wait--'</p>

<p>'Till I come back,' he interrupted.</p>

<p>Steadfastly she repeated his actual words, then added: 'Here; at
home--that is.'</p>

<p>'I'll come to the garden gate as usual,' he told her, trying to
smile. 'I'll knock. You'll open the gate--as usual--and come out to
me.'</p>

<p>These words, too, she attempted to repeat, but her voice failed, her
eyes filled suddenly with tears; she looked into his face and smiled.
It was just then that her little hand went up to hold the hat on--he
saw the very gesture still. He remembered that he was vehemently
tempted to tear his ticket up there and then, to go ashore with her, to
stay in England, to brave all opposition--when the siren roared its
third horrible warning...and the ship put out to sea.</p>

<p>Fifteen years, thick with various incident, had passed between them
since that moment. His life had risen, fallen, crashed, then risen
again. He had come back at last, fortune won by a lucky coup--at
thirty-five; had come back to find her, come back, above all, to keep
his word. Once every three months they had exchanged the brief letter
agreed upon: 'I am well; I am waiting; I am happy; I am unmarried.
Yours--' For his youthful wisdom had insisted that no 'man' had the
right to keep 'any woman' too long waiting; and she, thinking that
letter brave and splendid, had insisted likewise that he was free--if
freedom called him. They had laughed over this last phrase in their
agreement. They put five years as the possible limit of separation. By
then he would have won success, and obstinate parents would have
nothing more to say.</p>

<p>But when five years ended he was 'on his uppers' in a western mining
town, and with the end of ten in sight those uppers, though changed,
were little better, apparently, than patched and mended. It was just
then, too, that the change which had been stealing over him first
betrayed itself. He realised it abruptly, a sense of shame and horror
in him. The discovery was made unconsciously: it disclosed itself. He
was reading her letter as a labourer on a Californian fruit farm:
'Funny she doesn't marry--someone else!' he heard himself say. The
words were out before he knew it, and certainly before he could
suppress them. They just slipped out, startling him into the truth; and
he knew instantly that the thought was fathered in him by a hidden
wish...</p>

<p>He was older. He had lived. It was a memory he loved.</p>

<p>Despising himself in a contradictory fashion--both vaguely and
fiercely--he yet held true to his boyhood's promise. He did not write
and offer to release her as he knew they did in stories; he persuaded
himself that he meant to keep his word. There was this fine, stupid,
selfish obstinacy in his character. In any case, she would
misunderstand and think he wanted to set free--himself. 'Besides--I'm
still--awfully fond of her,' he asserted. And it was true; only the
love, it seemed, had gone its way. Not that another woman took it; he
kept himself clean, held firm as steel. The love, apparently, just
faded of its own accord; her image dimmed, her letters had ceased to
thrill, then ceased to interest him.</p>

<p>Subsequent reflection made him realise other details about himself.
In the interval he had suffered hardships, had learned the uncertainty
of life that depends for its continuance on a little food, but that
food often hard to come by, and had seen so many others go under that
he held it more cheaply than of old. The wandering instinct, too, had
caught him, slowly killing the domestic impulse; he lost his desire for
a settled place of abode, the desire for children of his own, lost the
desire to marry at all. Also--he reminded himself with a smile--he had
lost other things: the expression of youth she was accustomed to and
held always in her thoughts of him, two fingers of one hand, his hair!
He wore glasses, too. The gentlemen-adventurers of life get scarred in
those wild places where he lived. He saw himself a rather battered
specimen well on the way to middle age.</p>

<p>There was confusion in his mind, however, and in his heart: a
struggling complex of emotions that made it difficult to know exactly
what he did feel. The dominant clue concealed itself.</p>

<p>Feelings shifted. A single, clear determinant did not offer. He was
an honest fellow. 'I can't quite make it out,' he said. 'What is it I
really feel? And why?' His motive seemed obscured. To keep the flame
alight for the long buffeting years was no small achievement; better
men had succumbed in half the time. Yet something in him still held
fast to the girl as with a band of steel that would not let her go
entirely. Occasionally there came strong reversions, when he ached with
longing, yearning, hope; when he loved her again; remembered
passionately each detail of the far-off courtship days in the forbidden
rectory garden beyond the small, white garden gate. Or was it merely
the image and the memory he loved 'again'? He hardly knew himself. He
could not tell. That 'again' puzzled him. It was the wrong word
surely...He still wrote the promised letter, however; it was so easy;
those short sentences could not betray the dead or dying fires.</p>

<p>One day, besides, he would return and claim her. He meant to keep
his word.</p>

<p>And he had kept it. Here he was, this calm September afternoon,
within three miles of the village where he first had kissed her, where
the marvel of first love had come to both; three short miles between
him and the little white garden gate of which at this very moment she
was intently thinking, and behind which some fifty minutes later she
would be standing, waiting for...</p>

<p>He had purposely left the train at an earlier station; he would walk
the three miles in the dusk, climb the familiar steps, knock at the
white gate in the wall as of old, utter the promised words, 'I have
come back to find you,' enter, and--keep his word. He had written from
Mexico a week before he sailed; he had made careful, even accurate
calculations: 'In the dusk, on the sixteenth of September, I shall come
and knock,' he added to the usual sentences. The knowledge of his
coming, therefore, had been in her possession seven days. Just before
sailing, moreover, he had heard from her--though not in answer,
naturally. She was well; she was happy; she was unmarried; she was
waiting.</p>

<p>And now, as by some magical process of restoration--possible to deep
hearts only, perhaps, though even to them quite inexplicable--the state
of first love had blazed up again in him. In all its radiant beauty it
lit his heart, burned unextinguished in his soul, set body and mind on
fire.</p>

<p>The years had merely veiled it. It burst upon him, captured,
overwhelmed him with the suddenness of a dream. He stepped from the
train. He met it in the face. It took him prisoner. The familiar trees
and hedges, the unchanged countryside, the 'fields-smells known in
infancy,' all these, with something subtly added to them, rolled back
the passion of his youth upon him in a flood. No longer was he bound
upon what he deemed, perhaps, an act of honourable duty; it was love
that drove him, as it drove him fifteen years before. And it drove him
with the accumulated passion of desire long forcibly repressed; almost
as if, out of some fancied notion of fairness to the girl, he had
deliberately, yet still unconsciously, said 'No' to it; that she had
not faded, but that he had decided, 'I must forget her.' That sentence:
'Why doesn't she marry--someone else?' had not betrayed change in
himself. It surprised another motive: 'It's not fair to--her!'</p>

<p>His mind worked with a curious rapidity, but worked within one
circle only. The stress of sudden emotion was extraordinary. He
remembered a thousand things; yet, chief among them, those occasional
reversions when he had felt he 'loved her again.' Had he not, after
all, deceived himself? Had she ever really 'faded' at all? Had he not
felt he ought to let her fade--release her that way? And the change in
himself?--that sentence on the Californian fruit-farm--what did they
mean? Which had been true, the fading or the love? The confusion in his
mind was hopeless, but, as a matter of fact, he did not think at all:
he only felt. The momentum, besides, was irresistible, and before the
shattering onset of the sweet revival he did not stop to analyse the
strange result. He knew certain things, and cared to know no others:
that his heart was leaping, his blood running with the heat of twenty,
that joy recaptured him, that he must see, hear, touch her, hold her in
his arms--and marry her. For the fifteen years had crumbled to a little
thing, and at thirty-five he felt himself but twenty, rapturously,
deliciously in love.</p>

<p>He went quickly, eagerly, down the little street to the inn, still
feeling only, not thinking anything. The vehement uprush of the old
emotion made reflection of any kind impossible. He gave no further
thought to those long years 'out there,' when her name, her letters,
the very image of her in his mind had found him, if not cold, at least
without keen response. All that was forgotten as though it had not
been. The steadfast thing in him, this strong holding to a promise
which had never wilted, ousted the recollection of fading and decay
that, whatever caused them, certainly had existed. And this steadfast
thing now took command. This enduring quality in his character led him.
It was only towards the end of the hurried tea he first received the
singular impression--vague, indeed, but undeniably persistent--that he
was being led.</p>

<p>Yet, though aware of this, he did not pause to argue or reflect. The
emotional displacement in him, of course, had been more than
considerable: there had been upheaval, a change whose abruptness was
even dislocating, fundamental in a sense he could not estimate--shock.
Yet he took no count of anything but the one mastering desire to get to
her as soon as possible, knock at the small, white garden gate, hear
her answering voice, see the low wooden door swing open--take her.
There was joy and glory in his heart, and a yearning sweet delight. At
this very moment she was expecting him. And he--had come.</p>

<p>Behind these positive emotions, however, there lay concealed all the
time others that were of a negative character. Consciously, he was not
aware of them, but they were there; they revealed their presence in
various little ways that puzzled him. He recognised them
absent-mindedly, as it were; did not analyse or investigate them. For,
through the confusion upon his faculties, rose also a certain hint of
insecurity that betrayed itself by a slight hesitancy or miscalculation
in one or two unimportant actions. There was a touch of melancholy,
too, a sense of something lost. It lay, perhaps, in that tinge of
sadness which accompanies the twilight of an autumn day, when a
gentler, mournful beauty veils a greater beauty that is past. Some
trick of memory connected it with a scene of early boyhood, when,
meaning to see the sunrise, he overslept, and, by a brief half-hour,
was just--too late. He noted it merely, then passed on; he did not
understand it; he hurried all the more, this hurry the only sign that
it was noted. 'I must be quick,' flashed up across his strongly
positive emotions.</p>

<p>And, due to this hurry, possibly, were the slight miscalculations
that he made. They were very trivial. He rang for sugar, though the
bowl stood just before his eyes, yet when the girl came in he forgot
completely what he rang for--and inquired instead about the late trains
back to London. And, when the time-table was laid before him, he
examined it without intelligence, then looked up suddenly into the
maid's face with a question about flowers. Were there flowers to be had
in the village anywhere? What kind of flowers? 'Oh, a bouquet or a'--he
hesitated, searching for a word that tried to present itself, yet was
not the word he wanted to make use of--'or a wreath--of some sort?' he
finished. He took the very word he did not want to take. In several
things he did and said, this hesitancy and miscalculation betrayed
themselves--such trivial things, yet significant in and elusive way
that he disliked. There was sadness, insecurity somewhere in them. And
he resented them, though aware of their existence only because they
qualified his joy. There was a whispered 'No' floating somewhere in the
dusk. Almost--he felt disquiet. He hurried, more and more eager to be
off upon his journey--the final part of it.</p>

<p>Moreover, there were other signs of an odd
miscalculation--dislocation, perhaps, properly speaking--in him. Though
the inn was familiar from his boyhood days, kept by the same old
couple, too, he volunteered no information about himself, nor asked a
single question about the village he was bound for. He did not even
inquire if the rector--her father--still were living.</p>

<p>And when he left he entirely neglected the gilt-framed mirror above
the mantelpiece of plush, dusty pampas-grass in waterless vases on
either side. It did not matter, apparently, whether he looked well or
ill, tidy or untidy. He forgot that when his cap was off the absence of
thick, accustomed hair must alter him considerably, forgot also that
two fingers were missing from one hand, the right hand, the hand that
she would presently clasp. Nor did it occur to him that he wore
glasses, which must change his expression and add to the appearance of
the years he bore.</p>

<p>None of these obvious and natural things seemed to come into his
thoughts at all. He was in a hurry to be off. He did not think. But
though his mind may not have noted these slight betrayals with actual
sentences, his attitude, nevertheless, expressed them. This was, it
seemed, the feeling in him: 'What could such details matter to her now?
Why, indeed, should he give to them a single thought? It was himself
she loved and waited for, not separate items of his external, physical
image.' As well think of the fact that she, too, must have
altered--outwardly. It never once occurred to him. Such details were of
To-day...He was only impatient to come to her quickly, very quickly,
instantly, if possible. He hurried.</p>

<p>There was a flood of boyhood's joy in him. He paid for his tea,
giving a tip that was twice the price of the meal, and set out gaily
and impetuously along the winding lane. Charged to the brim with a
sweet picture of a small, white garden gate, the loved face close
behind it, he went forward at a headlong pace, singing 'Nancy Lee' as
he used to sing it fifteen years before.</p>

<p>With action, then, the negative sensations hid themselves,
obliterated by the positive ones that took command. The former,
however, merely lay concealed; they waited. Thus, perhaps, does vital
emotion, overlong restrained, denied, indeed, of its blossoming
altogether, take revenge.</p>

<p>Repressed element in his psychic life asserted themselves,
selecting, as though naturally a dramatic form.</p>

<p>The dusk fell rapidly, mist rose in floating strips along the
meadows by the stream; the old, familiar details beckoned him forwards,
then drove him from behind as he went swiftly past them. He recognised
others rising through the thickening air beyond; they nodded, peered,
and whispered, sometimes they almost sang. And each added to his inner
happiness; each brought its sweet and precious contribution, and built
it into the reconstructed picture of the earlier, long-forgotten
rapture. It was an enticing and enchanted journey that he made,
something impossibly blissful in it, something, too, that seemed
curiously irresistible.</p>

<p>For the scenery had not altered all these years, the details of the
country were unchanged, everything he saw was rich with dear and
precious association, increasing the momentum of the tide that carried
him along. Yonder was the stile over whose broken step he had helped
her yesterday, and there the slippery plank across the stream where she
looked above her shoulder to ask for his support; he saw the very
bramble bushes where she scratched her hand, a-blackberrying, the day
before...and, finally, the weather-stained signpost, 'To the Rectory.'
It pointed to the path through the dangerous field where Farmer
Sparrow's bull provided such a sweet excuse for holding,
leading--protecting her. From the entire landscape rose a stream of
recent memory, each incident alive, each little detail brimmed with its
cargo of fond association.</p>

<p>He read the rough black lettering on the crooked arm--it was rather
faded, but he knew it too well to miss a single letter--and hurried
forward along the muddy track; he looked about him for a sign of Farmer
Sparrow's bull; he even felt in the misty air for the little hand, that
he might take and lead her into safety. The thought of her drew him on
with such irresistible anticipation that it seemed as if the cumulative
drive of vanished and unsated years evoked the tangible phantom almost.
He actually felt it, soft and warm and clinging in his own, that was no
longer incomplete and mutilated.</p>

<p>Yet it was not he who led and guided now, but, more and more, he who
was being led. The hint had first betrayed its presence at the inn; it
now openly declared itself. It had crossed the frontier into a positive
sensation. Its growth, swiftly increasing all this time, had
accomplished itself; he had ignored, somehow, both its genesis and
quick development; the result he plainly recognised. She was expecting
him, indeed, but it was more than expectation; there was calling in
it--she summoned him. Her thought and longing reached him along that
old, invisible track love builds so easily between true, faithful
hearts. All the forces of her being, her very voice, came towards him
through the deepening autumn twilight. He had not noticed the curious
physical restoration in his hand, but he was vividly aware of this more
magical alteration--that she led and guided him, drawing him ever more
swiftly towards the little, white garden gate where she stood at this
very moment, waiting. Her sweet strength compelled him; there was this
new touch of something irresistible about the familiar journey, where
formerly had been delicious yielding only, shy, tentative advance.</p>

<p>His footsteps hurried, faster and ever faster; so deep was the
allurement in his blood, he almost ran. He reached the narrow, winding
lane, and raced along it. He knew each bend, each angle of the holly
hedge, each separate incident of ditch and stone. He could have plunged
blindfold down it at top speed. The familiar perfumes rushed at
him--dead leaves and mossy earth and ferns and dock leaves, bringing
the bewildering currents of strong emotion in him all together as in a
rising wave. He saw, then, the crumbling wall, the cedars topping it
with spreading branches, the chimneys of the rectory. On his right
bulked the outline of the old, grey church; the twisted, ancient yews,
the company of gravestones, upright and leaning, dotting the ground
like listening figures. But he looked at none of these. For, a little
beyond, he already saw the five rough steps of stone that led from the
lane towards a small, white garden gate. That gate at last shone before
him, rising through the misty air. He reached it.</p>

<p>He stopped dead a moment. His heart, it seemed, stopped too, then
took to violent hammering in his brain. There was a roaring in his
mind, and yet a marvellous silence--just behind it. Then the roar of
emotion died away. There was utter stillness. This stillness, silence,
was all about him. The world seemed preternaturally quiet.</p>

<p>But the pause was too brief to measure. For the tide of emotion had
receded only to come on again with redoubled power. He turned, leaped
forward, clambered impetuously up the rough stone steps, and flung
himself, breathless and exhausted, against the trivial barrier that
stood between his eyes and--hers. In his wild, half violent impatience,
however, he stumbled. That roaring, too, confused him. He fell forward,
it seemed, for twilight had merged in darkness, and he misjudged the
steps, the distances he yet knew so well. For a moment, certainly, he
lay at full length upon the uneven ground against the wall; the steps
had tripped him. And then he raised himself and knocked. His right hand
struck upon the small, white garden gate. Upon the two lost fingers he
felt the impact. 'I am here,' he cried, with a deep sound in his throat
as though utterance was choked and difficult. 'I have come back.'</p>

<p>For a fraction of a second he waited, while the world stood still
and waited with him. But there was no delay. Her answer came at once:
'I am well...I am happy...I am waiting.'</p>

<p>And the voice was clear and marvellous as of old. Though the words
were strange, reminding him of something dreamed, forgotten, lost, it
seemed, he did not take special note of them. He only wondered that she
did not open instantly that he might see her. Speech could follow, but
sight came surely first! There was this lightning-flash of
disappointment in him. Ah, she was lengthening out the marvellous
moment, as often and often she had done before. It was to tease him
that she made him wait. He knocked again; he pushed against the
unyielding surface. For he noticed that it was unyielding; and there
was a depth in the tender voice that he could not understand.</p>

<p>'Open!' he cried again, but louder than before. 'I have come back!'
And, as he said it, the mist struck cold against his face.</p>

<p>But her answer froze his blood.</p>

<p>'I cannot open.'</p>

<p>And a sudden anguish of despair rose over him; the sound of her
voice was strange; in it was faintness, distance as well as depth. It
seemed to echo. Something frantic seized him then--the panic sense.</p>

<p>'Open, open! Come out to me!' he tried to shout. His voice failed
oddly; there was no power in it. Something appalling struck him between
the eyes. 'For God's sake, open. I'm waiting here! Open, and come out
to me!'</p>

<p>The reply was muffled by distance that already seemed increasing; he
was conscious of freezing cold about him--in his heart:</p>

<p>'I cannot. You must come in to me.'</p>

<p>He knew not exactly then what happened, for the cold grew dreadful
and the icy mist was in his throat. No words would come. He rose to his
knees, and from his knees to his feet. He stooped. With all his force
he knocked again; in a blind frenzy of despair he hammered and beat
against the unyielding barrier of the small, white garden gate. He
battered it till the skin of his knuckles was torn and bleeding--the
first two fingers of a hand already mutilated. He remembered the torn
and broken skin, for he noticed in the gloom that stains upon the gate
bore witness to his violence; it was not till afterwards that he
remembered the other fact--that the hand had already suffered
mutilation, long, long years ago. The power of sound was feebly in him;
he called aloud; there was no answer. He tried to scream, but the
scream was muffled in his throat before it issued properly; it was a
nightmare scream. As a last resort he flung himself bodily upon the
unyielding gate, with such precipitate violence, moreover, that his
face struck against its surface.</p>

<p>From the friction, then, along the whole length of his cheek he knew
that the surface was not smooth. Cold and rough that surface was; but
also--it was not of wood. Moreover, there was writing on it he had not
seen before. How he deciphered it in the gloom, he never knew. The
lettering was deeply cut. Perhaps he traced it with his fingers; his
right hand certainly lay stretched upon it. He made out a name, a date,
a broken verse from the Bible, and strange words:</p>

<p>'Je suis la premi&egrave;re au rendez-vous. Je vous attends.' The
lettering way sharply cut with edges that were new. For the date was of
a week ago; the broken verse ran, 'When the shadows flee away...' and
the small, white garden gate was unyielding because it was
of--stone.</p>

<p>At the inn he found himself staring at a table from which the tea
things had not been cleared away. There was a railway time-table in his
hands, and his head was bent forwards over it, trying to decipher the
lettering in the growing twilight. Beside him, still fingering a form,
stood the serving-girl; her other hand held a brown tray with a running
dog painted upon its dented surface. It swung to and fro a little as
she spoke, evidently continuing a conversation her customer had begun.
For she was giving information--in the colourless, disinterested voice
such persons use:</p>

<p>'We all went to the funeral, sir, all the country people went. The
grave was her father's--the family grave...' Then, seeing that her
customer was too absorbed in the time-table to listen further, she said
no more but began to pile the tea things on to the tray with noisy
clatter.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, in the road, he stood hesitating. The signal at
the station just opposite was already down. The autumn mist was rising.
He looked along the winding road that melted away into the distance,
then slowly turned and reached the platform just as the London train
came in.</p>

<p>He felt very old--too old to walk three miles...</p>

<h2><a name="ch20"></a>Wayfarers</h2>

<p>I missed the train at Evian, and, after infinite trouble, discovered
a motor that would take me, ice-axe and all, to Geneva. By hurrying,
the connection might be just possible. I telegraphed to Haddon to meet
me at the station, and lay back comfortably, dreaming of the precipices
of Haute Savoie. We made good time; the roads were excellent, traffic
of the slightest, when--crash!</p>

<p>There was an instant's excruciating pain, the sun went out like a
snuffed candle, and I fell into something as soft as a bed of flowers
and as yielding to my weight as warm water...</p>

<p>It was very warm. There was a perfume of flowers. My eyes opened,
focused vividly upon a detailed picture for a moment, then closed
again. There was no context--at least, none that I could recall--for
the scene, though familiar as home, brought nothing that I definitely
remembered. Broken away from any sequence, unattached to any past,
unaware even of my own identity, I simply saw this picture as a camera
snaps it off from the world, a scene apart, with meaning only for those
who knew the context:</p>

<p>The warm, soft thing I lay in was a bed--big, deep, comfortable; and
the perfume came from flowers that stood beside it on a little table.
It was in a stately, ancient chamber, with lofty ceiling and immense
open fireplace of stone; old-fashioned pictures--familiar portraits and
engravings I knew intimately--hung upon the walls; the floor was bare,
with dignified, carved furniture of oak and mahogany, huge chairs and
massive cupboards. And there were latticed windows set within deep
embrasures of grey stone, where clambering roses patterned the sunshine
that cast their moving shadows on the polished boards. With the perfume
of the flowers there mingled, too, that delicate, elusive odour of age,
of wood, of musty tapestries on spacious halls and corridors, and of
chambers long unopened to the sun and air.</p>

<p>By the door that stood ajar far away at the end of the room--very
far away it seemed--an old lady, wearing a little cap of silk
embroidery, was whispering to a man of stern, uncompromising figure,
who, as he listened, bent down to her with a grave and even solemn
face. A wide stone corridor was just visible through the crack of the
open door behind her.</p>

<p>The picture flashed, and vanished. The numerous details I took in
because they were well known to me already. That I could not supply the
context was merely a trick of the mind, the kind of trick that dreams
play. Darkness swamped vision again. I sank back into the warm, soft,
comfortable bed of delicious oblivion. There was not the slightest
desire to know; sleep and soft forgetfulness were all I craved.</p>

<p>But a little later--or was it a very great deal later?--when I
opened my eyes again, there was a thin trail of memory. I remembered my
name and age. I remembered vaguely, as though from some unpleasant
dream, that I was on the way to meet a climbing friend in the Alps of
Haute Savoie, and that there was need to hurry and be very active.
Something had gone wrong, it seemed. There had been a stupid, violent
disaster, pain in it somewhere, an accident. Where were my belongings?
Where, for instance, was my precious ice-axe--tried old instrument on
which my life and safety depended? A rush of jumbled questions poured
across my mind. The effort to sort them hurt atrociously...</p>

<p>A figure stood beside my bed. It was the same old lady I had seen a
moment ago--or was it a month ago, even last year perhaps? And this
time she was alone. Yet, though familiar to me as my own right hand, I
could not for the life of me attract her name. Searching for it brought
the pain again. Instead, I asked an easier question; it seemed the most
important somehow, though a feeling of shame came with it, as though I
knew I was talking nonsense:</p>

<p>'My ice-axe--is it safe? It should have stood any ordinary strain.
It's ash...' My voice failed absurdly, caught away by a whisper
half-way down my throat. What was I talking about? There was vile
confusion somewhere.</p>

<p>She smiled tenderly, sweetly, as she placed her small, cool hand
upon my forehead. Her touch calmed me as it always did, and the pain
retreated a little.</p>

<p>'All your things are safe,' she answered, in a voice so soft beneath
the distant ceiling it was like a bird's note singing in the sky. 'And
you are also safe. There is no danger now. The bullet has been taken
out and all is going well. Only you must be patient, and lie very
still, and rest.'</p>

<p>And then she added the morsel of delicious comfort she knew quite
well I waited for: 'Marion is near you all day long, and most of the
night besides. She rarely leaves you. She is in and out all day.'</p>

<p>I stared, thirsting for more. Memory put certain pieces in their
place again. I heard them click together as they joined. But they only
tried to join. There were several pieces missing They must have been
lost in the disaster. The pattern was too ridiculous.</p>

<p>'I ought to tel--telegraph' I began, seizing at a fragment that
poked its end up, then plunged out of sight again before I could read
more of it. The pieces fell apart; they would not hold together without
these missing fragments. Anger flamed up in me.</p>

<p>'They're badly made,' I said, with a petulance I was secretly
ashamed of; 'you have chosen the wrong pieces! I'm not a child--to be
treated--' A shock of heat tore through me, led by a point of iron,
with blasting pain.</p>

<p>'Sleep, my poor dear Felix, sleep,' she murmured soothingly, while
her tiny hand stroked my forehead, just in time to prevent that
pointed, hot thing entering my heart. 'Sleep again now, and a little
later you shall tell me their names, and I will send on horseback
quickly--'</p>

<p>'Telegraph--' I tried to say, but the word went lost before I could
pronounce it. It was a nonsense word, caught up from dreams. Thought
fluttered and went out.</p>

<p>'I will send,' she whispered, 'in the quickest possible way. You
shall explain to Marion. Sleep first a little longer; promise me to lie
quite still and sleep. When you wake again, she will come to you at
once.'</p>

<p>She sat down gently on the edge of the enormous bed, so that I saw
her outline against the window where the roses clambered to come in.
She bent over me--or was it a rose that bent in the wind across the
stone embrasure? I saw her clear blue eyes--or was it two raindrops
upon a withered rose-leaf that mirrored the summer sky?</p>

<p>'Thank you,' my voice murmured with intense relief, as everything
sank away and the old-world garden seemed to enter by the latticed
windows. For there was a power in her way that made obedience sweet,
and her little hand, besides, cushioned the attack of that cruel iron
so that I hardly felt its entrance. Before the fierce heat could reach
me, darkness again put out the world...</p>

<p>Then, after a prodigious interval, my eyes once more opened to the
stately, old-world chamber that I knew so well; and this time I found
myself alone. In my brain was a stinging, splitting sensation, as
though Memory shook her pieces together with angry violence, pieces,
moreover, made of clashing metal. A degrading nausea almost vanquished
me. Against my feet was a heated metal body, too heavy for me to move,
and bandages were tight round my neck and the back of my head. Dimly,
it came back to me that hands had been about me hours ago, soft,
ministering hands that I loved. Their perfume lingered still. Faces and
names fled in swift procession past me, yet without my making any
attempt to bid them stay. I asked myself no questions. Effort of any
sort was utterly beyond me. I lay and watched and waited, helpless and
strangely weak.</p>

<p>One or two things alone were clear. They came, too, without the
effort to think them:</p>

<p>There had been a disaster; they had carried me into the nearest
house; and--the mountain heights, so keenly longed for, were suddenly
denied me. I was being cared for by kind people somewhere far from the
world's high routes. They were familiar people, yet for the moment I
had lost the name. But it was the bitterness of losing my holiday
climbing that chiefly savaged me, so that strong desire returned upon
itself unfulfilled. And, knowing the danger of frustrated yearnings,
and the curious states of mind they may engender, my tumbling brain
registered a decision automatically:</p>

<p>'Keep careful watch upon yourself,' it whispered.</p>

<p>For I saw the peaks that towered above the world, and felt the wind
rise from the hidden valleys. The perfume of lonely ridges came to me,
and I saw the snow against the blue-black sky.</p>

<p>Yet I could not reach them. I lay, instead, broken and useless upon
my back, in a soft, deep, comfortable bed. And I loathed the thought. A
dull and evil fury rose within me. Where was Haddon? He would get me
out of it if any one could. And where was my dear, old trusted
ice-axe?</p>

<p>Above all, who were these gentle, old-world people who cared for
me?...And, with this last thought, came some fairy touch of sweetness
so delicious that I was conscious of sudden resignation--more, even of
delight and joy.</p>

<p>This joy and anger ran races for possession of my mind, and I knew
not which to follow: both seemed real, and both seemed true. The cruel
confusion was an added torture. Two sets of places and people seemed to
mingle.</p>

<p>'Keep a careful watch upon yourself,' repeated the automatic
caution.</p>

<p>Then, with returning, blissful darkness, came another thing--a tiny
point of wonder, where light entered in. I thought of a woman...It was
a vehement, commanding thought; and though at first it was very close
and real--as much of To-day as Haddon and my precious ice-axe--the next
second it was leagues away in another world somewhere. Yet, before the
confusion twisted it all askew, I knew her; I remembered clearly even
where she lived; that I knew her husband, too--had stayed with them
in--in Scotland--yes, in Scotland. Yet no word in this life had ever
crossed my lips, for she was not free to come. Neither of us, with eyes
or lips or gesture, had ever betrayed a hint to the other of our deeply
hidden secret. And although for me she was the woman, my great
yearning--long, long ago it was, in early youth--had been sternly put
aside and buried with all the vigour nature gave me. Her husband was my
friend as well.</p>

<p>Only, now, the shock had somehow strained the prison bars, and the
yearning escaped for a moment full-fledged, and vehement with passion
long denied. The inhibition was destroyed. The knowledge swept
deliciously upon me that we had the right to be together, because we
always were together. I had the right to ask for her.</p>

<p>My mind was certainly a mere field of confused, ungoverned images.
No thinking was possible, for it hurt too vilely. But this one memory
stood out with violence. I distinctly remember that I called to her to
come, and that she had the right to come because my need was so
peremptory. To the one most loved of all this life had brought me, yet
to whom I had never spoken because she was in another's keeping, I
called for help, and called, I verily believe, aloud:</p>

<p>'Please come!' Then, close upon its heels, the automatic warning
again: 'Keep close watch upon yourself...!'</p>

<p>It was as though one great yearning had loosed the other that was
even greater, and had set it free.</p>

<p>Disappearing consciousness then followed the cry for an incalculable
distance. Down into subterraneans within myself that were positively
frightening it plunged away. But the cry was real; the yearning appeal
held authority in it as of command. Love gave the right, supplied the
power as well. For it seemed to me a tiny answer came, but from so far
away that it was scarcely audible. And names were nowhere in it, either
in answer or appeal.</p>

<p>'I am always here. I have never, never left you!'</p>

<p>The unconsciousness that followed was not complete, apparently.
There was a memory of effort in it, of struggle, and, as it were, of
searching. Some one was trying to get at me. I tossed in a troubled sea
upon a piece of wreckage that another swimmer also fought to reach.
Huge waves of transparent green now brought this figure nearer, now
concealed it, but it came steadily on, holding out a rope. My
exhaustion was too great for me to respond, yet this swimmer swept up
nearer, brought by enormous rollers that threatened to engulf us both.
The rope was for my safety, too. I saw hands outstretched. In the deep
water I saw the outline of the body, and once I even saw the face. But
for a second, merely. The wave that bore it crashed with a horrible
roar that smothered us both and swept me from my piece of wreckage. In
the violent flood of water the rope whipped against my feeble hands. I
grasped it. A sense of divine security at once came over me--an
intolerable sweetness of utter bliss and comfort, then blackness and
suffocation as of the grave. The white-hot point of iron struck me. It
beat audibly against my heart. I heard the knocking. The pain brought
me up to the surface, and the knocking of my dreams was in reality a
knocking on the door. Some one was gently tapping.</p>

<p>Such was the confusion of images in my painracked mind, that I
expected to see the old lady enter, bringing ropes and ice-axes, and
followed by Haddon, my mountaineering friend; for I thought that I had
fallen down a deep crevasse and had waited hours for help in the cold,
blue darkness of the ice. I was too weak to answer, and the knocking
for that matter was not repeated.</p>

<p>I did not even hear the opening of the door, so softly did she move
into the room. I only knew that before I actually saw her, this wave of
intolerable sweetness drenched me once again with bliss and peace and
comfort, my pain retreated, and I closed my eyes, knowing I should feel
that cool and soothing hand upon my forehead.</p>

<p>The same minute I did feel it. There was a perfume of old gardens in
the air. I opened my eyes to look the gratitude I could not utter, and
saw, close against me--not the old lady, but the young and lovely face
my worship had long made familiar. With lips that smiled their yearning
and eyes of brown that held tears of sympathy, she sat down beside me
on the bed. The warmth and fragrance of her atmosphere enveloped me. I
sank away into a garden where spring melts magically into summer. Her
arms were round my neck. Her face dropped down, so that I felt her hair
upon my cheek and eyes. And then, whispering my name twice over, she
kissed me on the lips.</p>

<p>'Marion,' I murmured.</p>

<p>'Hush! Mother sends you this,' she answered softly. 'You are to take
it all; she made it with her own hands. But I bring it to you. You must
be quite obedient, please.'</p>

<p>She tried to rise, but I held her against my breast.</p>

<p>'Kiss me again and I'll promise obedience always,' I strove to say.
But my voice refused so long a sentence, and anyhow her lips were on my
own before I could have finished it. Slowly, very carefully, she
disentangled herself, and my arms sank back upon the coverlet. I sighed
in happiness. A moment longer she stood beside my bed, gazing down with
love and deep anxiety into my face.</p>

<p>'And when all is eaten, all, mind, all,' she smiled, 'you are to
sleep until the doctor comes this afternoon. You are much better. Soon
you shall get up. Only, remember,' shaking her finger with a sweet
pretence of looking stern, 'I shall exact complete obedience. You must
yield your will utterly to mine. You are in my heart, and my heart must
be kept very warm and happy.'</p>

<p>Her eyes were tender as her mother's and I loved the authority and
strength that were so real in her. I remembered how it was this
strength that had sealed the contract her beauty first drew up for me
to sign. She bent down once more to arrange my pillows.</p>

<p>'What happened to--to the motor?' I asked hesitatingly, for my
thoughts would not regulate themselves. The mind presented such
incongruous fragments.</p>

<p>'The--what?' she asked, evidently puzzled. The word seemed strange
to her. 'What is that?' she repeated, anxiety in her eyes.</p>

<p>I made an effort to tell her, but I could not. Explanation was
suddenly impossible. The whole idea dived away out of sight. It utterly
evaded me. I had again invented a word that was without meaning. I was
talking nonsense. In its place my dream came up. I tried to tell her
how I had dreamed of climbing dangerous heights with a stranger, and
had spoken another language with him than my own--English, was it?--at
any rate, not my native French.</p>

<p>'Darling,' she whispered close into my ear, 'the bad dreams will not
come back. You are safe here, quite safe.' She put her little hand like
a flower on my forehead and drew it softly down the cheek. 'Your wound
is already healing. They took the bullet out four days ago. I have got
it,' she added with a touch of shy embarrassment, and kissed me
tenderly upon my eyes.</p>

<p>'How long have you been away from me?' I asked, feeling exhaustion
coming back.</p>

<p>'Never once for more than ten minutes,' was the reply. 'I watched
with you all night. Only this morning, while mother took my place, I
slept a little. But, hush!' she said, with clear authority again; 'you
are not to talk so much. You must eat what I have brought, then sleep
again. You must rest and sleep. Good-bye, good-bye, my love. I shall
come back in an hour, and I shall always be within reach of your dear
voice.'</p>

<p>Her tall, slim figure, dressed in the grey I loved, crossed silently
to the door. She gave me one more look--there was all the tenderness of
passionate love in it--and then was gone.</p>

<p>I followed instructions meekly, and when a delicious sleep stole
over me soon afterwards, I had forgotten utterly the ugly dream that I
was climbing dangerous heights with another man, forgotten as well
everything else, except that it seemed so many days since my love had
come to me, and that my bullet wound would after all be healed in time
for our wedding on the day so long, so eagerly waited for.</p>

<p>And when, several hours later, her mother came in with the
doctor--his face less grave and solemn this time--the news that I might
get up next day and lie a little in the garden, did more to heal me
than a thousand bandages or twice that quantity of medical
instructions.</p>

<p>I watched them as they stood a moment by the open door. They went
out very slowly together, speaking in whispers. But the only thing I
caught was the mother's voice, talking brokenly of the great wars.
Napoleon, the doctor was saying in a low, hushed tone, was in full
retreat from Moscow, though the news had only just come through. They
passed into the corridor then, and there was a sound of weeping as the
old lady murmured something about her son and the cruelty of Heaven.
'Both will be taken from me,' she was sobbing softly, while he stooped
to comfort her; 'one in marriage, and the other in death.' They closed
the door then, and I heard no more.</p>

<p>Convalescence seemed to follow very quickly then, for I was utterly
obedient as I had promised, and never spoke of what could excite me to
my own detriment--the wars and my own unfortunate part in them. We
talked instead of our love, our already too-long engagement, and of the
sweet dream of happiness that life held waiting for us in the future.
And, indeed, I was sufficiently weary of the world to prefer repose to
much activity, for my body was almost incessantly in pain, and this old
garden where we lay between high walls of stone, aloof from the busy
world and very peaceful, was far more to my taste just then than wars
and fighting.</p>

<p>The orchards were in blossom, and the winds of spring showered their
rain of petals upon the long, new grass. We lay, half in sunshine, half
in shade, beneath the poplars that lined the avenue towards the lake,
and behind us rose the ancient grey stone towers where the jackdaws
nested in the ivy and the pigeons cooed and fluttered from the woods
beyond.</p>

<p>There was loveliness everywhere, but there was sadness too, for
though we both knew that the wars had taken her brother whence there is
no return, and that only her aged, failing mother's life stood between
ourselves and the stately property, there hid a sadness yet deeper than
either of these thoughts in both our hearts. And it was, I think, the
sadness that comes with spring. For spring, with her lavish,
short-lived promises of eternal beauty, is ever a symbol of passing
human happiness, incomplete and always unfulfilled. Promises made on
earth are playthings, after all, for children. Even while we make them
so solemnly, we seem to know they are not meant to hold. They are made,
as spring is made, with a glory of soft, radiant blossoms that pass
away before there is time to realise them. And yet they come again with
the return of spring, as unashamed and glorious as if Time had utterly
forgotten.</p>

<p>And this sadness was in her too. I mean it was part of her and she
was part of it. Not that our love could change to pass or die, but that
its sweet, so-long-desired accomplishment must hold away, and, like the
spring, must melt and vanish before it had been fully known. I did not
speak of it. I well understood that the depression of a broken body can
influence the spirit with its poisonous melancholy, but it must have
betrayed itself in my words and gestures, even in my manner too. At any
rate, she was aware of it. I think, if truth be told, she felt it too.
It seemed so painfully inevitable.</p>

<p>My recovery, meanwhile, was rapid, and from spending an hour or two
in the garden, I soon came to spend the entire day. For the spring came
on with a rush, and the warmth increased deliciously. While the cuckoos
called to one another in the great beech-woods behind the chateau, we
sat and talked and sometimes had our simple meals or coffee there
together, and I particularly recall the occasion when solid food was
first permitted me and she gave me a delicate young bondelle, fresh
caught that very morning in the lake. There were leaves of sweet, crisp
lettuce with it, and she picked the bones out for me with her own white
hands.</p>

<p>The day was radiant, with a sky of cloudless blue, soft airs stirred
the poplar crests; the little waves fell on the pebbly beach not fifty
metres away, and the orchard floor was carpeted with flowers that
seemed to have caught from heaven's stars the patterns of their yellow
blossoms.</p>

<p>The bees droned peacefully among the fruit trees; the air was full
of musical deep hummings.</p>

<p>My former vigour stirred delightfully in blood, and I knew no pain,
beyond occasional dull twinges in the head that came with a rush of
temporary darkness over my mind. The scar was healed, however, and the
hair had grown over it again. This temporary darkness alarmed her more
than it alarmed me. There were grave complications, apparently, that I
did not know of.</p>

<p>But the deep-lying sadness in me seemed independent of the glorious
weather, due to causes so intangible, so far off that I never could
dispel them by arguing them away. For I could not discover what they
actually were. There was a vague, distressing sense of restlessness
that I ought to have been elsewhere and otherwise, that we were
together for a few days only, and that these few days I had snatched
unlawfully from stern, imperative duties. These duties were immediate,
but neglected. In a sense I had no right to this springtide of bliss
her presence brought me. I was playing truant somehow, somewhere. It
was not my absence from the regiment; that I know. It was infinitely
deeper, set to some enormous scale that vaguely frightened me, while it
deepened the sweetness of the stolen joy.</p>

<p>Like a child, I sought to pin the sunny hours against the sky and
make them stay. They passed with such a mocking swiftness, snatched
momentarily from some big oblivion. The twilights swallowed our days
together before they had been properly tasted, and on looking back,
each afternoon of happiness seemed to have been a mere moment in a
flying dream. And I must have somehow betrayed the aching mood, for
Marion turned of a sudden and gazed into my face with yearning and
anxiety in the sweet brown eyes.</p>

<p>'What is it, dearest?' I asked, 'and why do your eyes bring
questions?'</p>

<p>'You sighed,' she answered, smiling a little sadly; 'and sighed so
deeply. You are in pain again. The darkness, perhaps, is over you?' And
her hand stole out to meet my own. 'You are in pain?'</p>

<p>'Not physical pain,' I said, 'and not the darkness either. I see you
clearly,' and would have told her more, as I carried her soft fingers
to my lips, had I not divined from the expression in her eyes that she
read my heart and knew all my strange, mysterious forebodings in
herself.</p>

<p>'I know,' she whispered before I could find speech, 'for I feel it
too. It is the shadow of separation that oppresses you--yet of no
common, measurable separation you can understand. Is it not that?'</p>

<p>Leaning over then, I took her close into my arms, since words in
that moment were mere foolishness. I held her so that she could not get
away; but even while I did so it was like trying to hold the spring, or
fasten the flying hour with a fierce desire. All slipped from me, and
my arms caught at the sunshine and the wind.</p>

<p>'We have both felt it all these weeks,' she said bravely, as soon as
I had released her, 'and we both have struggled to conceal it. But
now--' she hesitated for a second, and with so exquisite a tenderness
that I would have caught her to me again but for my anxiety to hear her
further words--'now that you are well, we may speak plainly to each
other, and so lessen our pain by sharing it.' And then she added, still
more softly: 'You feel there is "something" that shall take you from
me--yet what it is you cannot discover nor divine. Tell me, Felix--all
your thought, that I in turn may tell you mine.'</p>

<p>Her voice floated about me in the sunny air. I stared at her,
striving to focus the dear face more clearly for my sight. A shower of
apple blossoms fell about us, and her words seemed floating past me
like those passing petals of white. They drifted away. I followed them
with difficulty and confusion. With the wind, I fancied, a veil of
indefinable change slipped across her face and eyes.</p>

<p>'Yet nothing that could alter feeling,' I answered; for she had
expressed my own thought completely. 'Nor anything that either of us
can control. Only--perhaps, that everything must fade and pass away,
just as this glory of the spring must fade and pass away--'</p>

<p>'Yet leaving its sweetness in us,' she caught me up passionately,
'and to come again, my beloved, to come again in every subsequent life,
each time with an added sweetness in it too!' Her little face showed
suddenly the courage of a lion in its eyes. Her heart was ever braver
than my own, a vigorous, fighting soul. She spoke of lives, I prattled
of days and hours merely.</p>

<p>A touch of shame stole over me. But that delicate, swift change in
her spread too. With a thrill of ominous warning I noticed how it rose
and grew about her. From within, outwards, it seemed to pass--like a
shadow of great blue distance. Shadow was somewhere in it, so that she
dimmed a little before my very eyes. The dreadful yearning searched and
shook me, for I could not understand it, try as I would. She seemed
going from me--drifting like her words and like the apple blossoms.</p>

<p>'But when we shall no longer be here to know it,' I made answer
quickly, yet as calmly as I could, 'and when we shall have passed to
some other place--to other conditions--where we shall not recognise the
joy and wonder. When barriers of mist shall have rolled between us--our
love and passion so made-over that we shall not know each other'--the
words rushed out feverishly, half beyond control--'and perhaps shall
not even dare to speak to each other of our deep desire--'</p>

<p>I broke off abruptly, conscious that I was speaking out of some
unfamiliar place where I floundered, helpless among strange conditions.
I was saying things I hardly understood myself.</p>

<p>Her bigger, deeper mood spoke through me, perhaps.</p>

<p>Her darling face came back again; she moved close within reach once
more.</p>

<p>'Hush, hush!' she whispered, terror and love both battling in her
eyes. 'It is the truth, perhaps, but you must not say such things. To
speak them brings them closer. A chain is about our hearts, a chain of
fashioning lives without number, but do not seek to draw upon it with
anxiety or fear. To do so can only cause the pain of wrong
entanglement, and interrupt the natural running of the iron links.' And
she placed her hand swiftly upon my mouth, as though divining that the
bleak attack of anguish was again upon me with its throbbing rush of
darkness.</p>

<p>But for once I was disobedient and resisted. The physical pain, I
realised vividly, was linked closely with this spiritual torture. One
caused the other somehow. The disordered brain received, though
brokenly, some hints of darker and unusual knowledge. It had stammered
forth in me, but through her it flowed easily and clear. I saw the
change move more swiftly then across her face.</p>

<p>Some ancient look passed into both her eyes.</p>

<p>And it was inevitable; I must speak out, regardless of mere bodily
well-being.</p>

<p>'We shall have to face them some day,' I cried, although the effort
hurt abominably, 'then why not now?' And I drew her hand down and
kissed it passionately over and over again. 'We are not children, to
hide our faces among shadows and pretend we are invisible. At least we
have the Present--the Moment that is here and now. We stand side by
side in the heart of this deep spring day. This sunshine and these
flowers, this wind across the lake, this sky of blue and this singing
of the birds--all, all are ours now. Let us use the moment that Time
gives, and so strengthen the chain you speak of that shall bring us
again together times without number. We shall then, perhaps, remember.
Oh, my heart, think what that would mean--to remember!'</p>

<p>Exhaustion caught me, and I sank back among my cushions. But Marion
rose up suddenly and stood beside me. And as she did so, another Sky
dropped softly down upon us both, and I smelt again the incense of old,
old gardens that brought long-forgotten perfumes, incredibly sweet, but
with it an ache of far-off, passionate remembrance that was pain. This
great ache of distance swept over me like a wave.</p>

<p>I know not what grand change then was wrought upon her beauty, so
that I saw her defiant and erect, commanding Fate because she
understood it. She towered over me, but it was her soul that towered.
The rush of internal darkness in me blotted out all else. The familiar,
present sky grew dim, the sunshine faded, the lake and flowers and
poplars dipped away. Conditions a thousand times more vivid took their
place. She stood out, clear and shining in the glory of an undressed
soul, brave and confident with an eternal love that separation
strengthened but could never, never change. The deep sadness I abruptly
realised, was very little removed from joy--because, somehow, it was
the condition of joy. I could not explain it more than that.</p>

<p>And her voice, when she spoke, was firm with a note of steel in it;
intense, yet devoid of the wasting anger that passion brings. She was
determined beyond Death itself, upon a foundation sure and lasting as
the stars. The heart in her was calm, because she knew. She was
magnificent.</p>

<p>'We are together--always,' she said, her voice rich with the
knowledge of some unfathomable experience, 'for separation is temporary
merely, forging new links in the ancient chain of lives that binds our
hearts eternally together.' She looked like one who has conquered the
adversity Time brings, by accepting it. 'You speak of the Present as
though our souls were already fitted now to bid it stay, needing no
further fashioning. Looking only to the Future, you forget our ample
Past that has made us what we are. Yet our Past is here and now, beside
us at this very moment. Into the hollow cups of weeks and months, of
years and centuries, Time pours its flood beneath our eyes. Time is our
schoolroom...Are you so soon afraid? Does not separation achieve that
which companionship never could accomplish? And how shall we dare
eternity together of we cannot be strong in separation first?'</p>

<p>I listened while a flood of memories broke up through film upon film
and layer upon layer that had long covered them.</p>

<p>'This Present that we seem to hold between our hands,' she went on
in that earnest, distant voice, 'is our moment of sweet remembrance
that you speak of, of renewal, perhaps, too, of reconciliation--a
fleeting instant when we may kiss again and say good-bye, but with
strengthened hope and courage revived. But we may not stay together
finally--we cannot--until long discipline and pain shall have perfected
sympathy and schooled our love by searching, difficult tests, that it
may last for ever.'</p>

<p>I stretched my arms out dumbly to take her in. Her face shone down
upon me, bathed in an older, fiercer sunlight. The change in her seemed
in an instant then complete. Some big, soft wind blew both of us ten
thousand miles away. The centuries gathered us back together.</p>

<p>'Look, rather, to the Past,' she whispered grandly, 'where first we
knew the sweet opening of our love. Remember, if you can, how the pain
and separation have made it so worth while to continue. And be braver
thence.'</p>

<p>She turned her eyes more fully upon my own, so that their light
persuaded me utterly away with her. An immense new happiness broke over
me. I listened, and with the stirrings of an ampler courage. It seemed
I followed her down an interminable vista of remembrance till I was
happy with her among the flowers and fields of our earliest
pre-existence.</p>

<p>Her voice came to me with the singing of birds and the hum of summer
insects.</p>

<p>'Have you so soon forgotten,' she sighed, 'when we knew together the
perfume of the hanging Babylonian Gardens, or when the Hesperides were
so soft, to us in the dawn of the world? And do you not remember,' with
a little rise of passion in her voice, 'the sweet plantations of
Chaldea, and how we tasted the odour of many a drooping flower in the
gardens of Alcinous and Adonis, when the bees of olden time picked out
the honey for our eating? It is the fragrance of those first hours we
knew together that still lies in our hearts to-day, sweetening our love
to this apparent suddenness. Hence comes the full, deep happiness we
gather so easily To-day...The breast of every ancient forest is torn
with storms and light..., that's why it is so soft and full of little
gardens. You have forgotten too easily the glades of Lebanon, where we
whispered our earliest secrets while the big winds drove their chariots
down those earlier skies...'</p>

<p>There rose an indescribable tempest of remembrance in my heart as I
strove to bring the pictures into focus; but words failed me, and the
hand I eagerly stretched out to touch her own, met only sunshine and
the rain of apple blossoms.</p>

<p>'The myrrh and frankincense,' she continued in a sighing voice that
seemed to come with the wind from invisible caverns in the sky, 'the
grapes and pomegranates--have they all passed from you, with the train
of apes and peacocks, the tigers and the ibis, and the hordes of
dark-faced slaves? And this little sun that plays so lightly here upon
our woods of beech and pine--does it bring back nothing of the old-time
scorching when the olive slopes, the figs and ripening cornfields heard
our vows and watched our love mature?...Our spread encampment in the
Desert--do not these sands upon our little beach revive its lonely
majesty for you, and have you forgotten the gleaming towers of
Semiramis...or, in Sardis, those strange lilies that first tempted our
souls to their divine disclosure...?'</p>

<p>Conscious of a violent struggle between pain and joy, both too deep
for me to understand, I rose to seize her in my arms. But the effort
dimmed the flying pictures. The wind that bore her voice down the
stupendous vista fled back into the caverns whence it came. And the
pain caught me in a vice of agony so searching that I could not move a
muscle. My tongue lay dry against my lips. I could not frame a word of
any sentence...</p>

<p>Her voice presently came back to me, but fainter, like a whisper
from the stars. The light dimmed everywhere; I saw no more the vivid,
shining scenery she had summoned. A mournful dusk instead crept down
upon the world she had momentarily revived.</p>

<p>'...we may not stay together,' I heard her little whisper, 'until
long discipline shall have perfected sympathy, and schooled our love to
last. For this love of ours is for ever, and the pain that tries it is
the furnace that fashions precious stones...'</p>

<p>Again I stretched my arms out. Her face shone a moment longer in
that forgotten fiercer sunlight, then faded very swiftly. The change,
like a veil, passed over it. From the place of prodigious distance
where she had been, she swept down towards me with such dizzy speed. As
she was To-day I saw her again, more and more.</p>

<p>'Pain and separation, then, are welcome,' I tried to stammer, 'and
we will desire them'--but my thought got no further into expression
than the first two words. Aching blotted out coherent utterance.</p>

<p>She bent down very close against my face. Her fragrance was about my
lips. But her voice ran off like a faint thrill of music, far, far
away. I caught the final words, dying away as wind dies in high
branches of a wood. And they reached me this time through the droning
of bees and of waves that murmured close at hand upon the shore.</p>

<p>'...for our love is of the soul and our souls are moulded in
Eternity. It is not yet, it is not now, our perfect consummation. Nor
shall our next time of meeting know it. We shall not even speak...For I
shall not be free...' was what I heard. She paused.</p>

<p>'You mean we shall not know each other?' I cried, in an anguish of
spirit that mastered the lesser physical pain.</p>

<p>I barely caught her answer:</p>

<p>'My discipline then will be in another's keeping--yet only that I
may come back to you...more perfect...in the end...'</p>

<p>The bees and waves then cushioned her whisper with their humming.
The trail of a deeper silence led them far away. The rush of temporary
darkness passed and lifted. I opened my eyes.</p>

<p>My love sat close beside me in the shadow of the poplars. One hand
held both my own, while with the other she arranged my pillows and
stroked my aching head. The world dropped back into a tiny scale once
more.</p>

<p>'You have had the pain again,' Marion murmured anxiously, 'but it is
better now. It is passing.' She kissed my cheek. 'You must come
in...'</p>

<p>But I would not let her go. I held her to me with all the strength
that was in me. 'I had it, but it's gone again. An awful darkness came
with it,' I whispered in the little ear that was so close against my
mouth. 'I've been dreaming,' I told her, as memory dipped away,
'dreaming of you and me--together somewhere--in old gardens, or
forests--where the sun was--'</p>

<p>But she would not let me finish. I think, in any case, I could not
have said more, for thought evaded me, and any language of coherent
description was in the same instant beyond my power.</p>

<p>Exhaustion came upon me, that vile, compelling nausea with it.</p>

<p>'The sun here is too strong for you, dear love,' I heard her saying,
'and you must rest more. We have been doing too much these last few
days. You must have more repose.' She rose to help me move indoors.</p>

<p>'I have been unconscious then?' I asked, in the feeble whisper that
was all I could manage.</p>

<p>'For a little while. You slept, while I watched over you.'</p>

<p>'But I was away from you! Oh, how could you let me sleep, when our
time together is so short?'</p>

<p>She soothed me instantly in the way she knew we both loved so. I
clung to her until she released herself again.</p>

<p>'Not away from me,' she smiled, 'for I was with you in your
dreaming.'</p>

<p>'Of course, of course you were'; but already I knew not exactly why
I said it, nor caught the deep meaning that struggled up into my words
from such unfathomable distance.</p>

<p>'Come,' she added, with her sweet authority again, 'we must go in
now. Give me your arm, and I will send out for the cushions. Lean on
me. I am going to put you back to bed.'</p>

<p>'But I shall sleep again,' I said petulantly, 'and we shall be
separated.'</p>

<p>'We shall dream together,' she replied, as she helped me slowly and
painfully towards the old grey walls of the chiteau.</p>

<p>Half an hour later I slept deeply, peacefully, upon my bed in the
big stately chamber where the roses watched beside the latticed
windows.</p>

<p>And to say I dreamed again is not correct, for it can only be
expressed by saying that I saw and knew. The figures round the bed were
actual, and in life. Nothing could be more real than the whisper of the
doctor's voice--that solemn, grave-faced man who was so tall--as he
said, sternly yet brokenly, to some one: 'You must say good-bye; and
you had better say it now.' Nor could anything be more definite and
sure, more charged with the actuality of living, than the figure of
Marion, as she stooped over me to obey the terrible command. For I saw
her face float down towards me like a star, and a shower of pale spring
blossoms rained upon me with her hair.</p>

<p>The perfume of old, old gardens rose about me as she slipped to her
knees beside the bed and kissed my lips--so softly it was like the
breath of wind from lake and orchard, and so lingeringly it was as
though the blossoms lay upon my mouth and grew into flowers that she
planted there.</p>

<p>'Good-bye, my love; be brave. It is only separation.'</p>

<p>'It is death,' I tried to say, but could only feebly stir my lips
against her own.</p>

<p>I drew her breath of flowers into my mouth...and there came then the
darkness which is final.</p>

<p>The voices grew louder. I heard a man struggling with an unfamiliar
language. Turning restlessly, I opened my eyes--upon a little, stuffy
room, with white walls whereon no pictures hung. It was very hot. A
woman was standing beside the bed, and the bed was very short. I
stretched, and my feet kicked against the boarding at the end.</p>

<p>'Yes, he is awake,' the woman said in French. 'Will you come in? The
doctor said you might see him when he woke. I think he'll know you.'
She spoke in French. I just knew enough to understand.</p>

<p>And of course I knew him. It was Haddon. I heard him thanking her
for all her kindness, as he blundered in. His French, if anything, was
worse than my own. I felt inclined to laugh. I did laugh.</p>

<p>'By Jove! old man, this is bad luck, isn't it? You've had a narrow
shave. This good lady telegraphed--'</p>

<p>'Have you got my ice-axe? Is it all right?' I asked. I remembered
clearly the motor accident--everything.</p>

<p>'The ice-axe is right enough,' he laughed, looking cheerfully at the
woman, 'but what about yourself? Feel bad still? Any pain, I mean?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I feel all right,' I answered, searching for the pain of broken
bones, but finding none.</p>

<p>'What happened? I was stunned, I suppose?'</p>

<p>'Bit stunned, yes,' said Haddon. 'You got a nasty knock on the head,
it seems. The point of the axe ran into you, or something.'</p>

<p>'Was that all?'</p>

<p>He nodded. 'But I'm afraid it's knocked our climbing on the head.
Shocking bad luck, isn't it?'</p>

<p>'I telegraphed last night,' the kind woman was explaining.</p>

<p>'But I couldn't get there till this morning,' Haddon said. 'The
telegram didn't find me till midnight, you see.' And he turned to thank
the woman in his voluble, dreadful French. She kept a little pension on
the shores of the lake. It was the nearest house, and they had carried
me in there and got the doctor to me all within the hour. It proved
slight enough, apart from the shock.</p>

<p>It was not even concussion. I had merely been stunned. Sleep had
cured me, as it seemed.</p>

<p>'Jolly little place,' said Haddon, as he moved me that afternoon to
Geneva, whence, after a few days' rest, we went on into the Alps of
Haute Savoie, 'and lucky the old body was so kind and quick. Odd,
wasn't it?' He glanced at me.</p>

<p>Something in his voice betrayed he hid another thought. I saw
nothing 'odd' in it at all, only very tiresome.</p>

<p>'What's its name?' I asked, taking a shot at a venture.</p>

<p>He hesitated a second. Haddon, the climber, was not skilled in the
delicacies of tact.</p>

<p>'Don't know its present name,' he answered, looking away from me
across the lake, 'but it stands on the site of an old
chateau--destroyed a hundred years ago--the Ch&acirc;teau de
Bellerive.'</p>

<p>And then I understood my old friend's absurd confusion. For
Bellerive chanced also to be the name of a married woman I knew in
Scotland--at least, it was her maiden name, and she was of French
extraction.</p>
