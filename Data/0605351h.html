<h3>Being the narration of James McLennegan, M.D., Ph.D.</h3>

<p>Prof. Wilhelm G. Breyfogle.<br>
University of Taychobera.</p>

<p>DEAR FRIEND,--Inclosed you will find some portions of the diary it
has been my life-long custom to keep, arranged in such a manner as to
narrate connectedly the history of some remarkable occurrences that
have taken place here during the last three years. Years and years
ago, I heard vague accounts of a strange lake high up in an almost
inaccessible part of the mountains of Wyoming. Various incredible
tales were related of it, such as that it was inhabited by creatures
which elsewhere on the globe are found only as fossils of a long
vanished time.</p>

<p>The lake and its surroundings are of volcanic origin, and not the
least strange thing about the lake is that it is subject to periodic
disturbances, which take the form of a mighty boiling in the centre,
as if a tremendous artesian well were rushing up there from the
bowels of the earth. The lake rises for a time, almost filling the
basin of black rocks in which it rests, and then recedes, leaving on
the shores mollusks and trunks of strange trees and bits of strange
ferns which no longer grow--on the earth, at least--and are to be
seen elsewhere only in coal measures and beds of stone. And he who
casts hook and line into the dusky waters, may haul forth, ganoid
fishes completely covered with bony plates.</p>

<p>All of this is described in the account written by Father LaMetrie
years ago, and he there advances the theory that the earth is hollow,
and that its interior is inhabited by the forms of plant and animal
life which disappeared from its surface ages ago, and that the lake
connects with this interior region. Symmes' theory of polar orifices
is well known to you. It is amply corroborated. I know that it is
true now. Through the great holes at the poles, the sun sends light
and heat into the interior.</p>

<p>Three years ago this month, I found my way through the mountains
here to Lake LaMetrie accompanied by a single companion, our friend,
young Edward Framingham. He was led to go with me not so much by
scientific fervor, as by a faint hope that his health might be
improved by a sojourn in the mountains, for he suffered from an acute
form of dyspepsia that at times drove him frantic.</p>

<p>Beneath an overhanging scarp of the wall of rock surrounding the
lake, we found a rudely-built stone-house left by the old cliff
dwellers. Though somewhat draughty, it would keep out the infrequent
rains of the region, and serve well enough as a shelter for the short
time which we intended to stay.</p>

<p>The extracts from my diary follow: APRIL 29TH, 1896.</p>

<p>I have been occupied during the past few days in gathering
specimens of the various plants which are cast upon the shore by the
waves of this remarkable lake. Framingham does nothing but fish, and
claims that he has discovered the place where the lake communicates
with the interior of the earth, if, indeed, it does, and there seems
to be little doubt of that. While fishing at a point near the centre
of the lake, he let down three pickerel lines tied together, in all
nearly three hundred feet, without finding bottom. Coming ashore, he
collected every bit of line, string, strap, and rope in our
possession, and made a line five hundred feet long, and still he was
unable to find the bottom. MAY 2ND, EVENING.</p>

<p>The past three days have been profitably spent in securing
specimens, and mounting and pickling them for preservation.
Framingham has had a bad attack of dyspepsia this morning and is not
very well. Change of climate had a brief effect for the better upon
his malady, but seems to have exhausted its force much sooner than
one would have expected, and he lies on his couch of dry water-weeds,
moaning piteously. I shall take him back to civilisation as soon as
he is able to be moved.</p>

<p>It is very annoying to have to leave when I have scarcely begun to
probe the mysteries of the place. I wish Framingham had not come with
me. The lake is roaring wildly without, which is strange, as it has
been perfectly calm hitherto, and still more strange because I can
neither feel nor hear the rushing of the wind, though perhaps that is
because it is blowing from the south, and we are protected from it by
the cliff. But in that case there ought to be no waves on this shore.
The roaring seems to grow louder momentarily. Framingham----MAY 3RD,
MORNING.</p>

<p>Such a night of terror we have been through. Last evening, as I
sat writing in my diary, I heard a sudden hiss, and, looking down,
saw wriggling across the earthen floor what I at first took to be a
serpent of some kind, and then discovered was a stream of water
which, coming in contact with the fire, had caused the startling
hiss. In a moment, other streams had darted in, and before I had
collected my senses enough to move, the water was two inches deep
everywhere and steadily rising.</p>

<p>Now I knew the cause of the roaring, and, rousing Framingham, I
half dragged him, half carried him to the door, and digging our feet
into the chinks of the wall of the house, we climbed up to its top.
There was nothing else to do, for above us and behind us was the
unscalable cliff, and on each side the ground sloped away rapidly,
and it would have been impossible to reach the high ground at the
entrance to the basin.</p>

<p>After a time we lighted matches, for with all this commotion there
was little air stirring, and we could see the water, now half-way up
the side of the house, rushing to the west with the force and
velocity of the current of a mighty river, and every little while it
hurled tree-trunks against the house-walls with a terrific shock that
threatened to batter them down. After an hour or so, the roaring
began to decrease, and finally there was an absolute silence. The
water, which reached to within a foot of where we sat, was at rest,
neither rising nor falling.</p>

<p>Presently a faint whispering began and became a stertorous
breathing, and then a rushing like that of the wind and a roaring
rapidly increasing in volume, and the lake was in motion again, but
this time the water and its swirling freight of tree-trunks flowed by
the house toward the east, and was constantly falling, and out in the
centre of the lake the beams of the moon were darkly reflected by the
sides of a huge whirlpool, streaking the surface of polished
blackness down, down, down the vortex into the beginning of whose
terrible depths we looked from our high perch.</p>

<p>This morning the lake is back at its usual level. Our mules are
drowned, our boat destroyed, our food damaged, my specimens and some
of my instruments injured, and Framingham is very ill. We shall have
to depart soon, although I dislike exceedingly to do so, as the
disturbance of last night, which is clearly like the one described by
Father LaMetrie, has undoubtedly brought up from the bowels of the
earth some strange and interesting things. Indeed, out in the middle
of the lake where the whirlpool subsided, I can see a large quantity
of floating things; logs and branches, most of them probably, but who
knows what else?</p>

<p>Through my glass I can see a tree-trunk, or rather stump, of
enormous dimensions. From its width I judge that the whole tree must
have been as large as some of the Californian big trees. The main
part of it appears to be about ten feet wide and thirty feet long.
Projecting from it and lying prone on the water is a limb, or root,
some fifteen feet long, and perhaps two or three feet thick. Before
we leave, which will be as soon as Framingham is able to go, I shall
make a raft and visit the mass of driftwood, unless the wind
providentially sends it ashore. MAY 4TH, EVENING.</p>

<p>A day of most remarkable and wonderful occurrences. When I arose
this morning and looked through my glass, I saw that the mass of
driftwood still lay in the middle of the lake, motionless on the
glassy surface, but the great black stump had disappeared. I was sure
it was not hidden by the rest of the driftwood, for yesterday it lay
some distance from the other logs, and there had been no disturbance
of wind or water to change its position. I therefore concluded that
it was some heavy wood that needed to become but slightly waterlogged
to cause it to sink.</p>

<p>Framingham having fallen asleep at about ten, I sallied forth to
look along the shores for specimens, carrying with me a botanical
can, and a South American machete, which I have possessed since a
visit to Brazil three years ago, where I learned the usefulness of
this sabre-like thing. The shore was strewn with bits of strange
plants and shells, and I was stooping to pick one up, when suddenly I
felt my clothes plucked, and heard a snap behind me, and turning
about I saw--but I won't describe it until I tell what I did, for I
did not fairly see the terrible creature until I had swung my machete
round and sliced off the top of its head, and then tumbled down into
the shallow water where I lay almost fainting.</p>

<p>Here was the black log I had seen in the middle of the lake, a
monstrous elasmosaurus, and high above me on the heap of rocks lay
the thing's head with its long jaws crowded with sabre-like teeth,
and its enormous eyes as big as saucers. I wondered that it did not
move, for I expected a series of convulsions, but no sound of a
commotion was heard from the creature's body, which lay out of my
sight on the other side of the rocks. I decided that my sudden cut
had acted like a stunning blow and produced a sort of coma, and
fearing lest the beast should recover the use of its muscles before
death fully took place, and in its agony roll away into the deep
water where I could not secure it, I hastily removed the brain
entirely, performing the operation neatly, though with some
trepidation, and restoring to the head the detached segment cut off
by my machete, I proceeded to examine my prize.</p>

<p>In length of body, it is exactly twenty-eight feet. In the widest
part it is eight feet through laterally, and is some six feet through
from back to belly. Four great flippers, rudimentary arms and feet,
and an immensely long, sinuous, swan-like neck, complete the
creature's body. Its head is very small for the size of the body and
is very round and a pair of long jaws project in front much like a
duck's bill. Its skin is a leathery integument of a lustrous black,
and its eyes are enormous hazel optics with a soft, melancholy stare
in their liquid depths. It is an elasmosaurus, one of the largest of
antediluvian animals. Whether of the same species as those whose
bones have been discovered, I cannot say.</p>

<p>My examination finished, I hastened after Framingham, for I was
certain that this waif from a long past age would arouse almost any
invalid. I found him somewhat recovered from his attack of the
morning, and he eagerly accompanied me to the elasmosaurus. In
examining the animal afresh, I was astonished to find that its heart
was still beating and that all the functions of the body except
thought were being performed one hour after the thing had received
its death blow, but I knew that the hearts of sharks, have been known
to beat hours after being removed from the body, and that decapitated
frogs live, and have all the powers of motion, for weeks after their
heads have been cut off.</p>

<p>I removed the top of the head to look into it and here another
surprise awaited me, for the edges of the wound were granulating and
preparing to heal. The colour of the interior of the skull was
perfectly healthy and natural, there was no undue flow of blood, and
there was every evidence that the animal intended to get well and
live without a brain. Looking at the interior of the skull, I was
struck by its resemblance to a human skull; in fact, it is, as nearly
as I can judge, the size and shape of the brain-pan of an ordinary
man who wears a seven and an eighth hat. Examining the brain itself,
I found it to be the size of an ordinary human brain, and singularly
like it in general contour, though it is very inferior in fibre and
has few convolutions. MAY 5TH, MORNING.</p>

<p>Framingham is exceedingly ill and talks of dying, declaring that
if a natural death does not put an end to his sufferings, he will
commit suicide. I do not know what to do. All my attempts to
encourage him are of no avail, and the few medicines I have no longer
fit his case at all. MAY 5TH, EVENING.</p>

<p>I have just buried Framingham's body in the sand of the lake
shore. I performed no ceremonies over the grave, for perhaps the real
Framingham is not dead, though such speculation seems utterly wild.
To-morrow I shall erect a cairn upon the mound, unless indeed there
are signs that my experiment is successful, though it is foolish to
hope that it will be.</p>

<p>At ten this morning, Framingham's qualms left him, and he set
forth with me to see the elasmosaurus. The creature lay in the place
where we left it yesterday, its position unaltered, still breathing,
all the bodily functions performing themselves. The wound in its head
had healed a great deal during the night, and I daresay will be
completely healed within a week or so, such is the rapidity with
which these reptilian organisms repair damages to themselves.
Collecting three or four bushels of mussels, I shelled them and
poured them down the elasmosaurus's throat. With a convulsive gasp,
they passed down and the great mouth slowly closed.</p>

<p>"How long do you expect to keep the reptile alive?" asked
Framingham.</p>

<p>"Until I have gotten word to a number of scientific friends, and
they have come here to examine it. I shall take you to the nearest
settlement and write letters from there. Returning, I shall feed the
elasmosaurus regularly until my friends come, and we decide what
final disposition to make of it. We shall probably stuff it."</p>

<p>"But you will have trouble in killing it, unless you hack it to
pieces, and that won't do. Oh, if I only had the vitality of that
animal. There is a monster whose vitality is so splendid that the
removal of its brain does not disturb it. I should feel very happy if
someone would remove my body. If I only had some of that beast's
useless strength."</p>

<p>"In your case, the possession of a too active brain has injured
the body," said I. "Too much brain exercise and too little bodily
exercise are the causes of your trouble. It would be a pleasant thing
if you had the robust health of the elasmosaurus, but what a
wonderful thing it would be if that mighty engine had your
intelligence."</p>

<p>I turned away to examine the reptile's wounds, for I had brought
my surgical instruments with me, and intended to dress them. I was
interrupted by a burst of groans from Framingham and turning, beheld
him rolling on the sand in an agony. I hastened to him, but before I
could reach him, he seized my case of instruments, and taking the
largest and sharpest knife, cut his throat from ear to ear.</p>

<p>"Framingham, Framingham," I shouted and, to my astonishment, he
looked at me intelligently. I recalled the case of the French doctor
who, for some minutes after being guillotined, answered his friends
by winking.</p>

<p>"If you hear me, wink," I cried. The right eye closed and opened
with a snap. Ah, here the body was dead and the brain lived. I
glanced at the elasmosaurus. Its mouth, half closed over its gleaming
teeth, seemed to smile an invitation. The intelligence of the man and
the strength of the brain. The living body and the living brain. The
curious resemblance of the reptile's brain-pan to that of a man
flashed across my mind.</p>

<p>"Are you still alive, Framingham?"</p>

<p>The right eye winked. I seized my machete, for there was no time
for delicate instruments. I might destroy all by haste and roughness,
I was sure to destroy all by delay. I opened the skull and disclosed
the brain. I had not injured it, and breaking the wound of the
elasmosaurus's head, placed the brain within. I dressed the wound
and, hurrying to the house, brought all my store of stimulants and
administered them.</p>

<p>For years the medical fraternity has been predicting that
brain-grafting will some time be successfully accomplished. Why has
it never been successfully accomplished? Because it has not been
tried. Obviously, a brain from a dead body cannot be used and what
living man would submit to the horrible process of having his head
opened, and portions of his brain taken for the use of others?</p>

<p>The brains of men are frequently examined when injured and parts
of the brain removed, but parts of the brains of other men have never
been substituted for the parts removed. No uninjured man has ever
been found who would give any portion of his brain for the use of
another. Until criminals under sentence of death are handed over to
science for experimentation, we shall not know what can be done in
the way of brain-grafting. But public opinion would never allow
it.</p>

<p>Conditions are favourable for a fair and thorough trial of my
experiment. The weather is cool and even, and the wound in the head
of the elasmosaurus has every chance for healing. The animal
possesses a vitality superior to any of our later day animals, and if
any organism can successfully become the host of a foreign brain,
nourishing and cherishing it, the elasmosaurus with its abundant
vital forces can do it. It may be that a new era in the history of
the world will begin here. MAY 6TH, NOON.</p>

<p>I think I will allow my experiment a little more time. MAY 7TH,
NOON.</p>

<p>It cannot be imagination. I am sure that as I looked into the
elasmosaurus's eyes this morning there was expression in them. Dim,
it is true, a sort of mistiness that floats over them like the
reflection of passing clouds. MAY 8TH, NOON.</p>

<p>I am more sure than yesterday that there is expression in the
eyes, a look of troubled fear, such as is seen in the eyes of those
who dream nightmares with unclosed lids. MAY 11TH, EVENING.</p>

<p>I have been ill, and have not seen the elasmosaurus for three
days, but I shall be better able to judge the progress of the
experiment by remaining away a period of some duration. MAY 12TH,
NOON.</p>

<p>I am overcome with awe as I realise the success that has so far
crowned my experiment. As I approached the elasmosaurus this morning,
I noticed a faint disturbance in the water near its flippers. I
cautiously investigated, expecting to discover some fishes nibbling
at the helpless monster, and saw that the commotion was not due to
fishes, but to the flippers themselves, which were feebly moving.</p>

<p>"Framingham, Framingham," I bawled at the top of my voice. The
vast bulk stirred a little, a very little, but enough to notice. Is
the brain, or Framingham, it would perhaps be better to say, asleep,
or has he failed to establish connection with the body? Undoubtedly
he has not yet established connection with the body, and this of
itself would be equivalent to sleep, to unconsciousness. As a man
born with none of the senses would be unconscious of himself, so
Framingham, just beginning to establish connections with his new
body, is only dimly conscious of himself and sleeps. I fed him, or
it--which is the proper designation will be decided in a few
days--with the usual allowance. MAY 17TH, EVENING.</p>

<p>I have been ill for the past three days, and have not been out of
doors until this morning. The elasmosaurus was still motionless when
I arrived at the cove this morning. Dead, I thought; but I soon
detected signs of breathing, and I began to prepare some mussels for
it, and was intent upon my task, when I heard a slight, gasping
sound, and looked up. A feeling of terror seized me. It was as if in
response to some doubting incantations there had appeared the
half-desired, yet wholly-feared and unexpected apparition of a fiend.
I shrieked, I screamed, and the amphitheatre of rocks echoed and
re-echoed my cries, and all the time the head of the elasmosaurus
raised aloft to the full height of its neck, swayed about unsteadily,
and its mouth silently struggled and twisted, as if in an attempt to
form words, while its eyes looked at me now with wild fear and now
with piteous intreaty.</p>

<p>"Framingham," I said.</p>

<p>The monster's mouth closed instantly, and it looked at me
attentively, pathetically so, as a dog might look.</p>

<p>"Do you understand me?"</p>

<p>The mouth began struggling again, and little gasps and moans
issued forth.</p>

<p>"If you understand me, lay your head on the rock."</p>

<p>Down came the head. He understood me. My experiment was a success.
I sat for a moment in silence, meditating upon the wonderful affair,
striving to realise that I was awake and sane, and then began in a
calm manner to relate to my friend what had taken place since his
attempted suicide.</p>

<p>"You are at present something in the condition of a partial
paralytic, I should judge," said I, as I concluded my account. "Your
mind has not yet learned to command your new body. I see you can move
your head and neck, though with difficulty. Move your body if you
can. Ah, you cannot, as I thought. But it will all come in time.
Whether you will ever be able to talk or not, I cannot say, but I
think so, however. And now if you cannot, we will arrange some means
of communication. Anyhow, you are rid of your human body and
possessed of the powerful vital apparatus you so much envied its
former owner. When you gain control of yourself, I wish you to find
the communication between this lake and the under-world, and conduct
some explorations. Just think of the additions to geological
knowledge you can make. I will write an account of your discovery,
and the names of Framingham and McLennegan will be among those of the
greatest geologists."</p>

<p>I waved my hands in my enthusiasm, and the great eyes of my friend
glowed with a kindred fire. JUNE 2ND, NIGHT.</p>

<p>The process by which Framingham has passed from his first
powerlessness to his present ability to speak, and command the use of
his corporeal frame, has been so gradual that there has been nothing
to note down from day to day. He seems to have all the command over
his vast bulk that its former owner had, and in addition speaks and
sings. He is singing now. The north wind has risen with the fall of
night, and out there in the darkness I hear the mighty organ
pipe-tones of his tremendous, magnificent voice, chanting the solemn
notes of the Gregorian, the full throated Latin words mingling with
the roaring of the wind in a wild and weird harmony.</p>

<p>To-day he attempted to find the connection between the lake and
the interior of the earth, but the great well that sinks down in the
centre of the lake is choked with rocks and he has discovered
nothing. He is tormented by the fear that I will leave him, and that
he will perish of loneliness. But I shall not leave him. I feel too
much pity for the loneliness he would endure, and besides, I wish to
be on the spot should another of those mysterious convulsions open
the connection between the lake and the lower world.</p>

<p>He is beset with the idea that should other men discover him, he
may be captured and exhibited in a circus or museum, and declares
that he will fight for his liberty even to the extent of taking the
lives of those attempting to capture him. As a wild animal, he is the
property of whomsoever captures him, though perhaps I can set up a
title to him on the ground of having tamed him. JULY 6TH.</p>

<p>One of Framingham's fears has been realised. I was at the pass
leading into the basin, watching the clouds grow heavy and pendulous
net appear over a knoll in the pass, followed by its bearer, a small
man, unmistakably a scientist, but I did not note him well, for as he
looked down into the valley, suddenly there burst forth with all the
power and volume of a steam calliope, the tremendous voice of
Framingham, singing a Greek song of Anacreon to the tune of "Where
did you get that hat?" and the singer appeared in a little cove, the
black column of his great neck raised aloft, his jagged jaws wide
open.</p>

<p>That poor little scientist. He stood transfixed, his butterfly net
dropped from his hand, and as Framingham ceased his singing,
curvetted and leaped from the water and came down with a splash that
set the whole cove swashing, and laughed a guffaw that echoed among
the cliffs like the laughing of a dozen demons, he turned and sped
through the pass at all speed.</p>

<p>I skip all entries for nearly a year. They are unimportant.</p>

<p>JUNE 30TH, 1897.</p>

<p>A change is certainly coming over my friend. I began to see it
some time ago, but refused to believe it and set it down to
imagination. A catastrophe threatens, the absorption of the human
intellect by the brute body. There are precedents for believing it
possible. The human body has more influence over the mind than the
mind has over the body. The invalid, delicate Framingham with refined
mind, is no more. In his stead is a roistering monster, whose
boisterous and commonplace conversation betrays a constantly growing
coarseness of mind.</p>

<p>No longer is he interested in my scientific investigations, but
pronounces them all bosh. No longer is his conversation such as an
educated man can enjoy, but slangy and diffuse iterations concerning
the trivial happenings of our uneventful life. Where will it end? In
the absorption of the human mind by the brute body? In the final
triumph of matter over mind and the degradation of the most mundane
force and the extinction of the celestial spark? Then, indeed, will
Edward Framingham be dead, and over the grave of his human body can I
fittingly erect a headstone, and then will my vigil in this valley be
over. FORT D. A. RUSSELL, WYOMING.</p>

<p>APRIL 15TH, 1899.</p>

<p>Prof. William G. Breyfogle.</p>

<p>DEAR SIR,--the inclosed intact manuscript and the fragments which
accompany it, came into my possession in the manner I am about to
relate and I inclose them to you, for whom they were intended by
their late author. Two weeks ago, I was dispatched into the mountains
after some Indians who had left their reservation, having under my
command a company of infantry and two squads of cavalrymen with
mountain howitzers. On the seventh day of our pursuit, which led us
into a wild and unknown part of the mountains, we were startled at
hearing from somewhere in front us a succession of bellowings of a
very unusual nature, mingled with the cries of a human being
apparently in the last extremity, and rushing over a rise before us,
we looked down upon a lake and saw a colossal, indescribable thing
engaged in rending the body of a man.</p>

<p>Observing us, it stretched its jaws and laughed, and in saying
this, I wish to be taken literally. Part of my command cried out that
it was the devil, and turned and ran. But I rallied them, and
thoroughly enraged at what we had witnessed, we marched down to the
shore, and I ordered the howitzers to be trained upon the murderous
creature. While we were doing this, the thing kept up a constant
blabbing that bore a distinct resemblance to human speech, sounding
very much like the jabbering of an imbecile, or a drunk trying to
talk. I gave the command to fire and to fire again, and the beast
tore out into the lake in its death-agony, and sank.</p>

<p>With the remains of Dr. McLennegan, I found the foregoing
manuscript intact, and the torn fragments of the diary from which it
was compiled, together with other papers on scientific subjects, all
of which I forward. I think some attempt should be made to secure the
body of the elasmosaurus. It would be a priceless addition to any
museum.</p>
