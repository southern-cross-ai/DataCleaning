<h1>A True Story</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Benjamin Disraeli</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>SIR,--When I was a young boy, I had delicate health, and was
somewhat of a pensive and contemplative turn of mind; it was my
delight in the long summer evenings to slip away from my noisy and
more robust companions, that I might walk in the shade of a venerable
wood, my favourite haunt, and listen to the cawing of the old rooks,
who seemed as fond of this retreat as I was.</p>

<p>One evening I sat later than usual, though the distant sound of
the cathedral clock had more than once warned me to my home. There
was a stillness in all nature that I was unwilling to disturb by the
least motion. From this reverie I was suddenly startled by the sight
of a tall, slender female who was standing by me, looking sorrowfully
and steadily in my face. She was dressed in white, from head to foot,
in a fashion I had never seen before; her garments were unusually
long and flowing, and resulted as she glided through the low shrubs
near me as if they were made of the richest silk. My heart beat as if
I were dying, and I knew not that I could have stirred from the spot;
but she seemed so very mild and beautiful, I did not attempt it. Her
pale brown hair was braided round her head, but there were some locks
that strayed upon her neck; and altogether she looked like a lovely
picture, but not like a living woman. I closed my eyes forcibly with
my hands, and when I looked again she had vanished.</p>

<p>I cannot exactly say why I did not on my return speak of this
beautiful appearance, nor why, with a strange mixture of hope and
fear, I went again and again to the same spot that I might see her.
She always came, and often in the storm and plashing rain, that never
seemed to touch or to annoy her, and looked sweetly at me, and
silently passed on; and though she was so near to me, that once the
wind lifted these light straying locks, and I felt them against my
cheek, yet I never could move or speak to her. I fell ill, and when I
recovered, my mother closely questioned me of the tall lady, of whom,
in the height of my fever, I had so often spoken.</p>

<p>I cannot tell you what a weight was taken from my boyish spirits
when I learned that this was no apparition, but a most lovely woman;
not young, though she had kept her young looks, for the grief which
had broken her heart seemed to have spared her beauty.</p>

<p>When the rebel troops were retreating after their total defeat, in
that very wood I was so fond of, a young officer, unable any longer
to endure the anguish of his wounds, sunk from his horse, and laid
himself down to die. he was found there by the daughter of Sir Henry
R--, and conveyed by a trusty domestic to her father's mansion. Sir
Henry was a loyalist; but the officer's desperate condition excited
his compassion, and his many wounds spoke a language a brave man
could not misunderstand. Sir Henry's daughter, with many tears,
pleaded for him and pronounced that he should be carefully and
secretly attended. And well she kept that promise, for she waited
upon him (her mother being long dead) for many weeks, and anxiously
watched for the first opening of eyes, that, languid as he was,
looked brightly and gratefully upon his nurse.</p>

<p>You may fancy better than I can tell you, as he slowly recovered,
all the moments that were spent in reading, and low-voiced singing,
and gentle playing on the lute, and how many fresh flowers were
brought to one whose wounded limbs would not bear him to gather them
for himself, and how calmly the days glided on in blessedness of
returning health, and in that sweet silence so carefully enjoined
him. I will pass by this to speak of one day, which brighter and
pleasanter than others, did not seem more bright or more lovely than
the looks of the young maiden, as she gaily spoke of "a little
festival which (though it must bear an unworthier name) she meant
really to give in honour of her guest's recovery." "And it is time,
lady," said he, "for that guest so tended and honoured, to tell you
his whole story, and speak to you of one who will help him to thank
you; may I ask you, fair lady, to write a little billet for me, which
even in these times of danger I may find some means to forward?" To
his mother, no doubt, she thought, as with light steps and a lighter
heart she seated herself by his couch, and smilingly bade him
dictate; but when he said "My dear wife," and lifted up his eyes to
be asked for more, he saw before him a pale statue, that gave him one
look of utter despair, and fell--for he had no power to help
her--heavily at his feet. Those eyes never truly reflected the pure
soul again, or answered by answering looks the found enquiries of her
poor old father. She lived to be as I saw her,--sweet and gentle, and
delicate always; but reason returned no more. She visited till the
day of her death the spot where she first saw that young soldier, and
dressed herself in the very clothes that he said so well became
her.</p>
