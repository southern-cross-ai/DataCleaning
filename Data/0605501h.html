<h1>The Haunted Cove</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>George Norman Douglas</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>COMMONPLACE in itself and showing positive vulgarity in the style
in which its pleasure-grounds are laid out, Clyffe, near
Berwick-on-Tweed, has yet one delightful feature of its own,--to wit,
a private bay to which access is obtained by a tunnel seventy or
eighty yards long, cut through the soft formation of the cliff from
the sloping gardens above. The result is that, if you are a visitor
at Clyffe, you have your own private bathing ground, your own private
beach where the children may play, without fear of being encroached
upon, unless, indeed, a boat should be run in among the rocks from
seaward. In the early nineties of the last century, the only daughter
of the house of Clyffe was engaged to be married to a young officer
quartered at the military depot at Berwick. They were a blameless but
not particularly interesting couple, and one of their hobbies was to
meet and promenade on the smooth sands of Clyffe bay in the brilliant
autumn moonlight. In order to prevent possible intrusion from the
sea, the seaward end of the tunnel was closed by a heavy iron gate,
and upon the inner side of this gate the Lieutenant was to wait until
his fiancee should steal forth bringing with her the key which should
give access to the beach. It was all very foolish and romantic, no
doubt, for they might have met just as conveniently in the
conservatory of Clyffe House, where their privacy would have been
equally respected, and where Miss Alix's satin shoes and diaphanous
draperies would have exposed her to no risk of a chill. Lovers are
like that, however, and had they not been so on this occasion, I
should have had no story to tell.</p>

<p>Like the exemplary swain he was, Dick arrived early at the
rendezvous,--that is to say, early in respect to the time agreed
upon, though, as a matter of fact, it was nearly eleven o'clock.
There he lit a cigarette, and approaching the heavy iron bars of the
locked gate, looked forth upon the peaceful scene beyond. It was a
perfect night, the harvest moon riding through fleecy cloud aloft,
whilst the breaking of the sea between the rocky points to right and
left was soothing in its gentle iteration. Dick had been on parade
extremely early that morning, and, tell it not in Gath! his eyes
involuntarily closed. Starting awake again, he saw with surprise
that, though Alix had not yet come forward, he was no longer alone.
No! the sacred beach had been invaded, and a female figure clad in
light draperies was pacing slowly in the moonlight betwixt himself
and the distant rocks. Who on earth could she be, and how had she got
there? were the questions he asked himself, his first sensation being
one of annoyance at so unexpected and so ill-timed an intrusion. But
as the moments passed and the figure came more clearly into view,
impatience gave way to curiosity, and curiosity to something like
awe.</p>

<p>What he saw was the tall and slender form of a young girl whose
hands were clasped in front of her, and whose eyes were fixed on the
ground in a pensive, not to say sorrowful, attitude. Clear as was the
moonlight, at least in the intervals of the moon's passage through
the broken clouds, her features were not plainly visible; but her
every movement was instinct with grace. What could she be doing
there? Under other circumstances, possibly Dick might have felt
inclined to pass the gate and himself step forth on to the sands.
But, besides that the gate was locked, he gradually became conscious
of a singular delicacy or unwillingness to intrude upon the privacy
of this solitary, inexplicable, and impressive figure. He was
content, therefore, to watch her noiseless progress, and, as he did
so, even his untrained masculine eye seemed to note something
unusual--out of date, it might be--in the fashion of her garments. So
perhaps might some old-world portrait have appeared, had it stept
down from its frame against the wall. This, however, stirred him
little. What he was not prepared for was the gesture of anguish, nay,
of positive despair, with which, when about opposite him, the figure
threw her head back and her arms aloft, as if in mute and agonised
appeal to Heaven. The action was heartrending even to look on; nor,
to a male eye, did it lose aught from the fact that, as the moonlight
now fell for the first time on her upturned face, it showed it to be
deathly pale indeed, but also exquisitely lovely. Another moment or
two, and the graceful and appealing form had passed beyond his field
of vision, for, as the locked gate stood some little way back from
the mouth of the tunnel, his view was restricted.</p>

<p>A short time only, though he knew not exactly how long, had passed
when Alix stood beside him.</p>

<p>"I had some difficulty," she archly explained, "in eluding prying
eyes."</p>

<p>For an ardent lover, Dick's greetings were perfunctory; after
which, being still powerfully under the impression of what he had
just seen, he told Alix all about it.</p>

<p>"We shall soon see who she is," replied that practical young lady,
as she placed the heavy key in the cumbrous lock, "and I shall also
take leave to inform her that this bit of coast is strictly
private."</p>

<p>And strictly private it appeared to be when they emerged from the
tunnel. For though their eyes swept the beach to right and left, and
though the moon just then was unobscured, they saw no trace of any
living form.</p>

<p>"She must have landed from a boat," said Alix; but as little trace
of a boat could they discover.</p>

<p>Still it was quite possible that she might pass unobserved against
the dark rocks, so they turned first to the right, then to the left,
keeping a keen look-out for any sign of motion.</p>

<p>They detected nothing.</p>

<p>And by this time I am bound to confess that a slightly
uncomplimentary suspicion had more than once crossed the brain of
Alix. She knew that, as a rule, her Dick was a pattern of moderation.
But even the most prudent may be liable to be occasionally overtaken.
And she recalled his having mentioned that this was to be a
guest-night at the mess. Indeed, it was chiefly upon that account
that the assignation had been fixed so late. This present portentous
solemnity was certainly most unlike him. Was it possible that the
poor fellow had taken just one more whisky-and-soda than he could
conveniently carry? Outspoken by nature, she blurted out her
suspicion, which was strengthened rather than the reverse by the
great earnestness with which he repelled it.</p>

<p>Less convinced than before, Alix then exclaimed: "Look here, Dick!
If, as you say, the young woman passed this way, she must have left
tracks on the smooth sand. Where do you say the place was?"</p>

<p>With some uncertainty, Dick then led her to what he took to be the
place. No tracks were there. He then tried further back from the
mouth of the tunnel, and with as little success. It was true the tide
was coming up, but it could scarcely yet have reached footmarks which
had been imprinted so far inshore as he supposed these to have
been.</p>

<p>In a spirit of levity which jarred on him, Alix now recommended
her lover to go back to his quarters and have a good sleep; and then,
having again passed through the gate and pushed their way up the
tunnel, the two young people parted in something very like a
tiff.</p>

<p>Dick did not call at Clyffe House the next day, and when he called
on the day following, Alix met him in a complaisant mood. After all,
she had no wish to quarrel with him. And very soon she said, "Going
back to what you told me you had seen the other night, Dick, it
occurred to me, after you were gone, that it fits in rather curiously
with an old story connected with this place." And then, at his
request, she proceeded to tell him how, some thirty years ago, her
grandmother had had a favourite maid, a friendless orphan girl named
Barbara, to whom attached a mystery. Barbara was a very lovely
creature of refinement and education above her station, and she had
of course numerous admirers. Young as she was, her discretion was
faultless, with the sole exception that her native amiability and
desire to please sometimes betrayed her into conduct which meant less
than her admirers wished to think it did. Well, at last Barbara
became plighted to a respectable young fisherman, part-owner of a
boat sailing from The Greenses, and, though details were vague, it
was generally understood that, as a consequence, several hearts were
severely damaged. As Barbara had no relatives, it was arranged by her
employer that she should remain in her situation until the
wedding-day and should be married from Clyffe House. Considerable
preparations had also been made to do honour to the occasion,
when--judge of the consternation of the inmates of the house!--upon
the morning of the wedding-day Barbara was not to be found. She was
believed to have retired to rest on the previous night as usual, yet
her bed had not been slept in. Nor, although most of her clothes were
packed in anticipation of her change of domicile, had she apparently
taken anything with her. Nothing in the least unusual had been
observed in her demeanour; nor could the unhappy bridegroom suggest
any possible motive for her conduct. Exhaustive inquiries and
exhaustive search were made; but, to cut the story short, nothing had
ever again been seen or heard of the fair Barbara to that day. Her
mistress, who had been sincerely attached to her, had long mourned
for her, and in after times would often sing her praises. But, in
order to be quite candid, it must be acknowledged that there were
others, not a few, who declined to believe that the girl had come to
an untimely end; and, who, knowing that she had several suitors, and
had sometimes appeared uncertain which to favour, preferred to think
that she had changed her mind at the last moment, and, deciding to
throw over her fisherman, had made her escape from Clyffe House
during the night to join some more eligible swain. This would have
been a desperate step indeed; nor could her conduct in withholding
subsequent explanations be absolved of heartlessness. But, after all,
she was the sort of girl who, where no actual misconduct was
involved, might easily allow herself to be over-persuaded. And
certainly the tangled skein of love does sometimes present a knot
which must be cut rather than untied.</p>

<p>The Lieutenant professed himself profoundly interested in this
narrative, which he and Alix then proceeded to discuss in all its
bearings, and more particularly, of course, in its relation to the
figure seen by him in the cove. It is true that Alix never quite
believed in the genuineness of the apparition; but, seeing that Dick
really wished to have it taken seriously, she decided tactfully to
humour him, and made quite a nine days' wonder of the mysterious
occurrence. Their own wedding-day was, however, fast drawing on, so
they soon found other things to talk and think of. To be brief, they
were in due course married, and, amid the cares and pleasures of
wedded life, the story, though not forgotten, came to be very seldom
referred to. So twenty years passed; at the end of which time the
Colonel (as he now was), accompanied by his wife and several
youngsters, paid one of his not very frequent visits to his wife's
parents at Clyffe House.</p>

<p>On the first night of the visit, after dinner, Alix's father had
significantly recalled the story of the maid Barbara's disappearance,
and, after stating that the mystery had now been finally cleared up,
had gone on to relate the following particulars:--A few days
previously there had lain at the point of death in the infirmary at
Berwick an aged fisherman, who had long been known in the seaport
town for his solitary habits and morose and violent ways. As death
drew near, it became evident that his mind was sorely troubled, and
to one of the nurses or doctors who had sought to comfort him he had
been led to make the acknowledgment that a guilty secret weighed upon
his soul, making him fearful to confront his Maker. He then told how,
as a young man, he had passionately loved a pretty servant-girl
employed at Clyffe House. Misled by those smiles and that
graciousness of manner which in the guileless amiability of her
nature the girl lavished upon all alike, he had for a moment imagined
himself her favoured suitor. How bitter, then, was the blow, and how
rude the awakening when he learned that a younger brother of his own,
a mere boy, was preferred before himself! Nor was it only unrequited
love that grieved him. No, he believed, or managed to persuade
himself, that an unfair advantage had been taken of him, by which he
had been made the lovers' dupe. A silent man, he took no one into his
confidence, but abode his time until the eve of the wedding-day. On
that day he had accidentally intercepted a note from the girl
Barbara, addressed to his brother, in which she had agreed to meet
her bridegroom of the morrow in the cove below Clyffe House one hour
before midnight, to spend a final hour together before the momentous
crisis in their lives. Instantly it had occurred to the elder brother
to use the knowledge gained from the note in order to make one last
desperate appeal on his own account to the sweet girl he loved so
madly. Accordingly he kept back the missive, and, to make assurance
doubly sure, mixed a soporific drug with his brother's drink when the
latter came in from fishing. Then, whilst the youngster slumbered
heavily, he himself embarked in a cockle-boat and, unobserved, rowed
quietly round the headland, into Clyffe cove, where he ran his boat
into a safe creek he knew of, and jumped ashore. Poor Barbara had
come down to the water's edge to meet the boat, and great was her
consternation on finding herself confronted by the wrong brother.</p>

<p>Then an impassioned scene was enacted, in which the seaman used
every means of persuasion known to him to get the girl to give up his
brother and plight herself to him. But though alternately distressed
and terrified, Barbara had stood her ground, and, gentle and yielding
though she appeared to be, neither threats nor vows had had the
slightest effect upon her constancy. And then, of a sudden, the
reckless brother had "seen red." If he could not have this girl to
wife, then neither should another, and a moment later her white form
lay stretched upon the dark rocks at his feet.</p>

<p>The sight brought him to himself. There was no room for doubt that
life was extinct; and if he was to escape suspicion, he must act at
once, for the summer night was short and the dread interview had
lasted long. He accordingly placed the body in the boat, and, having
collected several heavy stones, proceeded to make use of his seacraft
by binding them closely and firmly about the poor girl's body by
means of her clothing. Then he rowed out to sea, some mile or more,
and there quietly dropped the body overboard. Such, in essentials,
was the story told by the dying fisherman, and so it had come about
that the bride of that fatal morning was never seen or heard of more.
Though possibly intended to be regarded as confidential, certain it
is that the confession had leaked out, and very soon became public
property. For a few days it attracted great attention; and then, like
other more important things which had preceded it, it ceased, save
very occasionally, to be alluded to at all. But the Colonel never
forgot it, any more than he ever forgot the lovely and inexplicable
vision which had appeared to him for so brief an interval, in the
moonlight, on the shore below Clyffe House. It is true that he seldom
referred to it. Nor did that stately dame, who had once been Miss
Alix and who was now believed to command the regiment, encourage him
to do so. For she had observed that he was always most ready to tell
the story after an exceptionally good dinner. And, with her high
sense of what was due to his rank, she fancied that it made him
mildly ridiculous. Neither, it might be, had her earliest doubts been
ever wholly laid to rest. But members of the fair sex, when they are
practical, are apt to be very practical indeed.</p>
