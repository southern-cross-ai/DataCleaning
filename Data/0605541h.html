<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<p>In the year 1691, Lois Barclay stood on a little wooden pier,
steadying herself on the stable land, in much the same manner as,
eight or nine weeks ago, she had tried to steady herself on the deck
of the rocking ship which had carried her across from Old to New
England. It seemed as strange now to be on solid earth as it had
been, not long ago, to be rocked by the sea both by day and by night;
and the aspect of the land was equally strange. The forests which
showed in the distance all around, and which, in truth, were not very
far from the wooden houses forming the town of Boston, were of
different shades of green, and different, too, in shape of outline to
those which Lois Barclay knew well in her old home in Warwickshire.
Her heart sank a little as she stood alone, waiting for the captain
of the good ship Redemption, the kind, rough old sailor, who was her
only known friend in this unknown continent. Captain Holdernesse was
busy, however, as she saw, and it would probably be some time before
he would be ready to attend to her; so Lois sat down on one of the
casks that lay about, and wrapped her grey duffle cloak tight around
her, and sheltered herself under her hood, as well as might be, from
the piercing wind, which seemed to follow those whom it had
tyrannised over at sea with a dogged wish of still tormenting them on
land. Very patiently did Lois sit there, although she was weary, and
shivering with cold; for the day was severe for May, and the
Redemption, with store of necessaries and comforts for the Puritan
colonists of New England, was the earliest ship that had ventured
across the seas.</p>

<p>How could Lois help thinking of the past, and speculating on the
future, as she sat on Boston pier, at this breathing-time of her
life? In the dim sea mist which she gazed upon with aching eyes
(filled, against her will, with tears, from time to time), there
rose, the little village church of Barford (not three miles from
Warwick--you may see it yet), where her father had preached ever
since 1661, long before she was born. He and her mother both lay dead
in Barford churchyard; and the old low grey church could hardly come
before her vision without her seeing the old parsonage too, the
cottage covered with Austrian roses and yellow jessamine, where she
had been born, sole child of parents already long past the prime of
youth. She saw the path not a hundred yards long, from the parsonage
to the vestry door: that path which her father trod daily; for the
vestry was his study, and the sanctum where he pored over the
ponderous tomes of the Fathers, and compared their precepts with
those of the authorities of the Anglican Church of that day--the day
of the later Stuarts; for Barford Parsonage, at that time, scarcely
exceeded in size and dignity the cottages by which it was surrounded:
it only contained three rooms on a floor, and was but two storeys
high. On the first or ground floor, were the parlour, kitchen, and
back or working kitchen; upstairs, Mr and Mrs Barclay's room, that
belonging to Lois, and the maid servant's room. If a guest came, Lois
left her own chamber, and shared old Clemence's bed. But those days
were over. Never more should Lois see father or mother on earth; they
slept, calm and still, in Barford churchyard, careless of what became
of their orphan child, as far as earthly manifestations of care or
love went. And Clemence lay there too, bound down in her grassy bed
by withes of the briar-rose, which Lois had trained over those three
precious graves before leaving England for ever.</p>

<p>There were some who would fain have kept her there; one who swore
in his heart a great oath unto the Lord that he would seek her,
sooner or later, if she was still upon the earth. But he was the rich
heir and only son of the Miller Lucy, whose mill stood by the Avon
side in the grassy Barford meadows; and his father looked higher for
him than the penniless daughter of Parson Barclay (so low were
clergymen esteemed in those days!); and the very suspicion of Hugh
Lucy's attachment to Lois Barclay made his parents think it more
prudent not to offer the orphan a home, although none other of the
parishioners had the means, even if they had the will, to do so.</p>

<p>So Lois swallowed her tears down till the time came for crying,
and acted upon her mother's words</p>

<p>'Lois, thy father is dead of this terrible fever, and I am dying.
Nay, it is so; though I am easier from pain for these few hours, the
Lord be praised! The cruel men of the Commonwealth have left thee
very friendless. Thy father's only brother was shot down at Edgehill.
I, too, have a brother, though thou hast never heard me speak of him,
for he was a schismatic; and thy father and me had words, and he left
for that new country beyond the seas, without ever saying farewell to
us. But Ralph was a kind lad until he took up these newfangled
notions; and for the old days sake he will take thee in, and love
thee as a child, and place thee among his children. Blood is thicker
than water. Write to him as soon as I am gone--for, Lois, I am going,
and I bless the Lord that has letten me join my husband again so
soon.' Such was the selfishness of conjugal love; she thought little
of Lois's desolation in comparison with her rejoicing over her speedy
reunion with her dead husband! 'Write to thine uncle, Ralph Hickson,
Salem, New England (put it down, child, on thy tablets), and say that
I, Henrietta Barclay, charge him, for the sake of all he holds dear
in heaven or on earth---for his salvation's sake, as well as for the
sake of the old home at Lester Bridge--for the sake of the father and
mother that gave us birth, as well as for the sake of the six little
children who lie dead between him and me--that he take thee into his
home as if thou wert his own flesh and blood, as indeed thou art. He
has a wife and children of his own, and no one need fear having thee,
my Lois, my darling, my baby, among his household. O Lois, would that
thou wert dying with me! The thought of thee makes death sore!' Lois
comforted her mother more than herself, poor child, by promises to
obey her dying wishes to the letter, and by expressing hopes she
dared not feel of her uncle's kindness.</p>

<p>'Promise me'--the dying woman's breath came harder and
harder---'that thou wilt go at once. The money our goods will
bring--thy letter thy father wrote to Captain Holdernesse, his old
schoolfellow--thou knowest all I would say--my Lois, God bless
thee!'</p>

<p>Solemnly did Lois promise; strictly she kept her word. It was all
the more easy, for Hugh Lucy met her, and told her, in one great
burst of love, of his passionate attachment, his vehement struggles
with his father, his impotence at present, his hopes and resolves for
the future. And, intermingled with all this, came such outrageous
threats and expressions of uncontrolled vehemence, that Lois felt
that in Barford she must not linger to be a cause of desperate
quarrel between father and son, while her absence might soften down
matters, so that either the rich old miller might relent, or--and her
heart ached to think of the other possibility--Hugh's love might
cool, and the dear playfellow of her childhood learn to forget. If
not--if Hugh were to be trusted in one tithe of what he said--God
might permit him to fulfil his resolve of coming to seek her out,
before many years were over. It was all in God's hands; and that was
best, thought Lois Barclay.</p>

<p>She was aroused out of her trance of recollections by Captain
Holdernesse, who, having done all that was necessary in the way of
orders and directions to his mate, now came up to her, and, praising
her for her quiet patience, told her that he would now take her to
the Widow Smith's, a decent kind of house, where he and many other
sailors of the better order were in the habit of lodging during their
stay on the New England shores. Widow Smith, he said, had a parlour
for herself and her daughters, in which Lois might sit, while he went
about the business that, as he had told her, would detain him in
Boston for a day or two, before he could accompany her to her uncle's
at Salem. All this had been to a certain degree arranged on
ship-board; but Captain Holdernesse, for want of anything else that
he could think of to talk about, recapitulated it, as he and Lois
walked along. It was his way of showing sympathy with the emotion
that made her grey eyes full of tears, as she started up from the
pier at the sound of his voice. In his heart he said, 'Poor wench!
poor wench! it's a strange land to her, and they are all strange
folks, and, I reckon, she will be feeling desolate. I'll try and
cheer her up.' So he talked on about hard facts, connected with the
life that lay before her, until they reached Widow Smith's; and
perhaps Lois was more brightened by this style of conversation, and
the new ideas it presented to her, than she would have been by the
tenderest woman's sympathy.</p>

<p>'They are a queer set, these New Englanders,' said Captain
Holdernesse. 'They are rare chaps for praying; down on their knees at
every turn of their life. Folk are none so busy in a new country,
else they would have to pray like me, with a "Yo-hoy!" on each side
of my prayer, and a rope cutting like fire through my hand. Yon pilot
was for calling us all to thanksgiving for a good voyage, and lucky
escape from the pirates; but I said I always put up my thanks on dry
land, after I had got my ship into harbour. The French colonists,
too, are vowing vengeance for the expedition against Canada, and the
people here are raging like heathens--at least, as like as godly folk
can be--for the loss of their charter. All that is the news the pilot
told me; for, for all he wanted us to be thanksgiving instead of
casting the lead, he was as down in the mouth as could be about the
state of the country. But here we are at Widow Smith's! Now, cheer
up, and show the godly a pretty smiling Warwickshire lass!'</p>

<p>Anybody would have smiled at Widow Smith's greeting. She was a
comely, motherly woman, dressed in the primmest fashion in vogue
twenty years before in England, among the class to which she
belonged. But, somehow, her pleasant face gave the lie to her dress;
were it as brown and sober-coloured as could be, folk remembered it
bright and cheerful, because it was a part of Widow Smith
herself.</p>

<p>She kissed Lois on both cheeks, before she rightly understood who
the stranger maiden was, only because she was a stranger and looked
sad and forlorn; and then she kissed her again, because Captain
Holdernesse commanded her to the widow's good offices. And so she led
Lois by the hand into her rough, substantial log-house, over the door
of which hung a great bough of a tree, by way of sign of
entertainment for man and horse. Yet not all men were received by
Widow Smith. To some she could be as cold and reserved as need be,
deaf to all inquiries save one---where else they could find
accommodation? To this question she would give a ready answer, and
speed the unwelcome guest on his way. Widow Smith was guided in these
matters by instinct: one glance at a man's face told her whether or
not she chose to have him as an inmate of the same house as her
daughters; and her promptness of decision in these matters gave her
manner a kind of authority which no one liked to disobey, especially
as she had stalwart neighbours within call to back her, if her
assumed deafness in the first instance, and her voice and gesture in
the second, were not enough to give the would-be guest his dismissal.
Widow Smith chose her customers merely by their physical aspect; not
one whit with regard to their apparent worldly circumstances. Those
who had been staying at her house once always came again; for she had
the knack of making every one beneath her roof comfortable and at his
ease. Her daughters, Prudence and Hester, had somewhat of their
mother's gifts, but not in such perfection. They reasoned a little
upon a stranger's appearance, instead of knowing at the first moment
whether they liked him or no; they noticed the indications of his
clothes, the quality and cut thereof, as telling somewhat of his
station in society; they were more reserved; they hesitated more than
their mother; they had not her prompt authority, her happy power.
Their bread was not so light; their cream went sometimes to sleep,
when it should have been turning into butter; their hams were not
always just like the hams of the old country'; as their mother's were
invariably pronounced to be--yet they were good, orderly, kindly
girls, and rose and greeted Lois with a friendly shake of the hand,
as their mother, with her arm round the stranger's waist, led her
into the private room which she called her parlour. The aspect of
this room was strange in the English girl's eyes. The logs of which
the house was built showed here and there through the mud-plaster,
although before both plaster and logs were hung the skins of many
curious animals--skins presented to the widow by many a trader of her
acquaintance, just as her sailor-guests brought her another
description of gifts--shells, strings of wampum-beads, sea-birds'
eggs, and presents from the old country. The room was more like a
small museum of natural history of these days than a parlour; and it
had a strange, peculiar, but not unpleasant smell about it,
neutralised in some degree by the smoke from the enormous trunk of
pinewood which smouldered in the hearth.</p>

<p>The instant their mother told them that Captain Holdernesse was in
the outer room, the girls began putting away their spinning-wheel and
knitting needles, and preparing for a meal of some kind; what meal,
Lois, sitting there and unconsciously watching, could hardly tell.
First, dough was set to rise for cakes; then came out of a
corner-cupboard--a present from England--an enormous square bottle of
a cordial called Gold-Wasser; next, a mill for grinding chocolate--a
rare, unusual treat anywhere at that time; then a great Cheshire
cheese. Three venison-steaks were cut ready for broiling, fat cold
pork sliced up and treacle poured over it; a great pie, something
like a mince-pie, but which the daughters spoke of with honour as the
'punken-pie,' fresh and salt-fish brandered, oysters cooked in
various ways. Lois wondered where would be the end of the provisions
for hospitably receiving the strangers from the old country. At
length everything was placed on the table, the hot food smoking; but
all was cool, not to say cold, before Elder Hawkins (an old neighbour
of much repute and standing, who had been invited in by Widow Smith
to hear the news) had finished his grace, into which was embodied
thanksgiving for the past, and prayers for the future, lives of every
individual present, adapted to their several cases, as far as the
elder could guess at them from appearances. This grace might not have
ended so soon as it did, had it not been for the somewhat impatient
drumming of his knife-handle on the table, with which Captain
Holdernesse accompanied the latter half of the elder's words.</p>

<p>When they first sat down to their meal, all were too hungry for
much talking; but, as their appetites diminished, their curiosity
increased, and there was much to be told and heard on both sides.
With all the English intelligence Lois was, of course, well
acquainted; but she listened with natural attention to all that was
said about the new country, and the new people among whom she had
come to live. Her father had been a Jacobite, as the adherents of the
Stuarts were beginning at this rime to be called. His father, again,
had been a follower of Archbishop Laud; so Lois had hitherto heard
little of the conversation, and seen little of the ways of the
Puritans. Elder Hawkins was one of the strictest of the strict, and
evidently his presence kept the two daughters of the house
considerably in awe. But the widow herself was a privileged person;
her known goodness of heart (the effects of which had been
experienced by many) gave her the liberty of speech which was tacitly
denied to many, under penalty of being esteemed ungodly, if they
infringed certain conventional limits. And Captain Holdernesse and
his mate spoke out their minds, let who would be present. So that, on
this first landing in New England, Lois was, as it were, gently let
down into the midst of the Puritan peculiarities; and yet they were
sufficient to make her feel very lonely and strange.</p>

<p>The first subject of conversation was the present state of the
colony--Lois soon found out that, although at the beginning she was
not a little perplexed by the frequent reference to names of places
which she naturally associated with the old country. Widow Smith was
speaking: 'In county of Essex the folk are ordered to keep four
scouts, or companies of minutemen; six persons in each company; to be
on the look-out for the wild Indians, who are for ever stirring about
in the woods, stealthy brutes as they are! I am sure, I got such a
fright the first harvest-time after I came over to New England, I go
on dreaming, now near twenty years after Lothrop's business, of
painted Indians, with their shaven scalps and their war-streaks,
lurking behind the trees, and coming nearer and nearer with their
noiseless steps.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' broke in one of her daughters; 'and, mother, don't you
remember how Hannah Benson told us how her husband had cut down every
tree near his house at Deerbrook, in order that no one might come
near him, under cover; and how one evening she was a-sitting in the
twilight, when all her family were gone to bed, and her husband gone
off to Plymouth on business, and she saw a log of wood, just like a
trunk of a felled tree, lying in the shadow, and thought nothing of
it, till, on looking again a while after, she fancied it was come a
bit nearer to the house; and how her heart turned sick with fright;
and how she dared not stir at first, but shut her eyes while she
counted a hundred, and looked again, and the shadow was deeper, but
she could see that the log was nearer; so she ran in and bolted the
door, and went up to where her eldest lad lay. It was Elijah, and he
was but sixteen then; but he rose up at his mother's words, and took
his father's long duck-gun down; and he tried the loading, and spoke
for the first time to put up a prayer that God would give his aim
good guidance, and went to a window that gave a view upon the side
where the log lay, and fired; and no one dared to look what came of
it; but all the household read the Scriptures, and prayed the whole
night long; till morning came and showed a long stream of blood lying
on the grass close by the log---which the full sunlight showed to be
no log at all, but just a Red Indian covered with bark, and painted
most skilfully, with his war-knife by his side.'</p>

<p>All were breathless with listening; though to most the story, or
others like it, were familiar. Then another took up the tale of
horror:--</p>

<p>'And the pirates have been down at Marblehead, since you were
here, Captain Holdernesse. 'Twas only the last winter they
landed--French Papist pirates; and the people kept close within their
houses, for they knew not what would come of it; and they dragged
folk ashore. There was one woman among those folk--prisoners from
some vessel, doubtless---and the pirates took them by force to the
inland marsh; and the Marblehead folk kept still and quiet, every gun
loaded, and every car on the watch, for who knew but what the wild
sea-robbers might take a turn on land next; and, in the dead of the
night, they heard a woman's loud and pitiful outcry from the marsh,
"Lord Jesu! have mercy on me! Save me from the power of man, O Lord
Jesu!" And the blood of all who heard the cry ran cold with terror;
till old Nance Hickson, who had been stone-deaf and bed-ridden for
years, stood up in the midst of the folk all gathered together in her
grandson's house, and said, that, as they, the dwellers in
Marblehead, had not had brave hearts or faith enough to go and
succour the helpless, that cry of a dying woman should be in their
ears, and in their children's cars, till the end of the world. And
Nance dropped down dead as soon as she had made an end of speaking,
and the pirates set sail from Marblehead at morning dawn; but the
folk there hear the cry still, shrill and pitiful, from the waste
marshes, "Lord Jesu! have mercy on me! Save me from the power of man,
O Lord Jesu!"'</p>

<p>'And, by token,' said Elder Hawkins's deep bass voice, speaking
with the strong nasal twang of the Puritans (who, says Butler, 'godly
Mr Noyes ordained a fast at Marblehead, and preached a soul-stirring
discourse on the words, "Inasmuch as ye did it not unto one of the
least of these, my brethren, ye did it not unto me." But it has been
borne in upon me at times, whether the whole vision of the pirates
and the cry of the woman was not a device of Satan's to sift the
Marblehead folk, and see what fruit their doctrine bore, and so to
condemn them in the sight of the Lord. If it were so, the enemy had a
great triumph; for assuredly it was no part of Christian men to leave
a helpless woman unaided in her sore distress.)'</p>

<p>'But, Elder,' said Widow Smith, 'it was no vision; they were real
living men who went ashore, men who broke down branches and left
their footmarks on the ground.'</p>

<p>'As for that matter, Satan bath many powers, and, if it be the day
when he is permitted to go about like a roaring lion, he will not
stick at trifles, but make his work complete. I tell you, many men
are spiritual enemies in visible forms, permitted to roam about the
waste places of the earth. I myself believe that these Red Indians
are indeed the evil creatures of whom we read in Holy Scripture; and
there is no doubt that they are in league with those abominable
Papists, the French people in Canada. I have heard tell, that the
French pay the Indians so much gold for every dozen scalps of
Englishmen's heads.'</p>

<p>'Pretty cheerful talk this!' said Captain Holdernesse to Lois,
perceiving her blanched cheek and terror-stricken mien. 'Thou art
thinking that thou hadst better have stayed at Barford, I'll answer
for it, wench. But the devil is not so black as he is painted.'</p>

<p>'Ho! there again!' said Elder Hawkins. 'The devil is painted, it
bath been said so from old times; and are not these Indians painted,
even like unto their father?'</p>

<p>'But is it all true?' asked Lois, aside, of Captain Holdernesse,
letting the Elder hold forth unheeded by her, though listened to with
the utmost reverence by the two daughters of the house.</p>

<p>'My wench,' said the old sailor, 'thou hast come to a country
where there are many perils, both from land and from sea. The Indians
hate the white men. Whether other white men' (meaning the French away
to the north) 'have bounded-on the savages, or whether the English
have taken their lands and hunting-grounds without due recompense,
and so raised the cruel vengeance of the wild creatures--who knows?
But it is true that it is not safe to go far into the woods, for fear
of the lurking painted savages; nor has it been safe to build a
dwelling far from a settlement; and it takes a brave heart to make a
journey from one town to another; and folk do say the Indian
creatures rise up out of the very ground to waylay the English! and
then others affirm they are all in league with Satan to affright the
Christians out of the heathen country, over which he has reigned so
long. Then, again, the sea-shore is infested by pirates, the scum of
all nations: they land, and plunder, and ravage, and burn, and
destroy. Folk get affrighted of the real dangers, and in their fright
imagine, perchance, dangers that are not. But who knows? Holy
Scripture speaks of witches and wizards, and of the power of the Evil
One in desert places; and, even in the old country, we have heard
tell of those who have sold their souls for ever for the little power
they get for a few years on earth.'</p>

<p>By this time the whole table was silent, listening to the captain;
it was just one of those chance silences that sometimes occur,
without any apparent reason, and often without any apparent
consequence. But all present had reason, before many months had
passed over, to remember the words which Lois spoke in answer,
although her voice was low, and she only thought, in the interest of
the moment, of being heard by her old friend the captain.</p>

<p>'They are fearful creatures, the witches! and yet I am sorry for
the poor old women, whilst I dread them. We had one in Barford, when
I was a little child. No one knew whence she came, but she settled
herself down in a mud-hut by the common-side; and there she lived,
she and her cat.' (At the mention of the cat, Elder Hawkins shook his
head long and gloomily.) 'No one knew how she lived, if it were not
on nettles and scraps of oatmeal and such-like food, given her more
for fear than for pity. She went double, and always talking and
muttering to herself. Folk said she snared birds and rabbits in the
thicket that came down to her hovel. How it came to pass I cannot
say, but many a one fell sick in the village, and much cattle died
one spring, when I was near four years old. I never heard much about
it, for my father said it was ill talking about such things; I only
know I got a sick fright one afternoon, when the maid had gone out
for milk and had taken me with her, and we were passing a meadow
where the Avon, circling, makes a deep round pool, and there was a
crowd of folk, all still--and a still, breathless crowd makes the
heart beat worse than a shouting, noisy one. They were all gazing
towards the water, and the maid held me up in her arms, to see the
sight above the shoulders of the people; and I saw old Hannah in the
water, her grey hair all streaming down her shoulders, and her face
bloody and black with the stones and mud they had been throwing at
her, and her cat tied round her neck. I hid my face, I know, as soon
as I saw the fearsome sight, for her eyes met mine as they were
glaring with fury--poor, helpless, baited creature!--and she caught
the sight of me, and cried out, "Parson's wench, parson's wench,
yonder, in thy nurse's arms, thy dad bath never tried for to save me;
and none shall save thee, when thou art brought up for a witch." Oh!
the words rang in my cars, when I was dropping asleep, for years
after. I used to dream that I was in that pond; that all men hated me
with their eyes because I was a witch: and, at times, her black cat
used to seem living again, and say over those dreadful works.'</p>

<p>Lois stopped: the two daughters looked at her excitement with a
kind of shrinking surprise, for the tears were in her eyes. Elder
Hawkins shook his head, and muttered texts from Scripture; but
cheerful Widow Smith, not liking the gloomy rum of the conversation,
tried to give it a lighter cast by saying, 'And I don't doubt but
what the parson's bonny lass has bewitched many a one since, with her
dimples and her pleasant ways--eh, Captain Holdernesse? It's you must
tell us tales of the young lass's doings in England.'</p>

<p>'Ay, ay,' said the captain; 'there's one under her charms in
Warwickshire who will never get the better of it, I'm thinking.'</p>

<p>Elder Hawkins rose to speak; he stood leaning on his hands, which
were placed on the table: 'Brethren,' said he, 'I must upbraid you if
ye speak lightly; charms and witchcraft are evil things; I trust this
maiden bath had nothing to do with them, even in thought. But my mind
misgives me at her story. The hellish witch might have power from
Satan to infect her mind, she being yet a child, with the deadly sin.
Instead of vain talking, I call upon you all to join with me in
prayer for this stranger in our land, that her heart may be purged
from all iniquity. Let us pray.'</p>

<p>'Come, there's no harm in that,' said the captain; 'but, Elder
Hawkins, when you are at work, just pray for us all; for I am afeard
there be some of us need purging from iniquity a good deal more than
Lois Barclay, and a prayer for a man never does mischief.'</p>

<p>Captain Holdernesse had business in Boston which detained him
there for a couple of days; and during that time Lois remained with
the Widow Smith, seeing what was to be seen of the new land that
contained her future home. The letter of her dying mother was sent
off to Salem, meanwhile, by a lad going thither, in order to prepare
her Uncle Ralph Hickson for his niece's coming, as soon as Captain
Holdernesse could find leisure to take her; for he considered her
given into his own personal charge, until he could consign her to her
uncle's care. When the time came for going to Salem, Lois felt very
sad at leaving the kindly woman under whose roof she had been
staying, and looked back as long as she could see anything of Widow
Smith's dwelling. She was packed into a rough kind of country-cart,
which just held her and Captain Holdernesse, beside the driver. There
was a basket of provisions under their feet, and behind them hung a
bag of provender for the horse; for it was a good day's journey to
Salem, and the road was reputed so dangerous that it was ill tarrying
a minute longer than necessary for refreshment. English roads were
bad enough at that period, and for long after; but in America the way
was simply the cleared ground of the forest--the stumps of the felled
trees still remaining in the direct line, forming obstacles which it
required the most careful driving to avoid; and in the hollows, where
the ground was swampy, the pulpy nature of it was obviated by logs of
wood laid across the boggy part. The deep green forest, tangled into
heavy darkness even thus early in the year, came within a few yards
of the road all the way, though efforts were regularly made by the
inhabitants of the neighbouring settlements to keep a certain space
clear on each side, for fear of the lurking Indians, who might
otherwise come upon them unawares. The cries of strange birds, the
unwonted colour of some of them, all suggested to the imaginative or
unaccustomed traveller the idea of war-whoops and painted deadly
enemies. But at last they drew near to Salem, which rivalled Boston
in size in those days, and boasted the names of one or two streets,
although to an English eye they looked rather more like irregularly
built houses, clustered round the meeting-house, or rather one of the
meeting-houses, for a second was in process of building. The whole
place was surrounded with two circles of stockades; between the two
were the gardens and grazing-ground for those who dreaded their
cattle straying into the woods, and the consequent danger of
reclaiming them.</p>

<p>The lad who drove them flogged his spent horse into a trot, as
they went through Salem to Ralph Hickson's house. It was evening, the
leisure-time for the inhabitants, and their children were at play
before the houses. Lois was struck by the beauty of one wee, toddling
child, and turned to look after it; it caught its little foot in a
stump of wood, and fell with a cry that brought the mother out in
affright. As she ran out, her eye caught Lois' anxious gaze, although
the noise of the heavy wheels drowned the sound of her words of
inquiry as to the nature of the hurt the child had received. Nor had
Lois time to think long upon the matter; for, the instant after, the
horse was pulled up at the door of a good, square, substantial wooden
house, plastered over into a creamy white, perhaps as handsome a
house as any in Salem; and there she was told by the driver that her
uncle, Ralph Hickson, lived. In the flurry of the moment she did not
notice, but Captain Holdernesse did, that no one came out at the
unwonted sound of wheels, to receive and welcome her. She was lifted
down by the old sailor, and led into a large room, almost like the
hall of some English manor-house as to size. A tall, gaunt young man
of three or four-and-twenty sat on a bench by one of the windows,
reading a great folio by the fading light of day. He did not rise
when they came in, but looked at them with surprise, no gleam of
intelligence coming into his stem, dark face. There was no woman in
the house-place. Captain Holdernesse paused a moment, and then
said--</p>

<p>'Is this house Ralph Hickson's?'</p>

<p>'It is,' said the young man, in a slow, deep voice. But he added
no word further.</p>

<p>'This is his niece, Lois Barclay,' said the captain, taking the
girl's arm, and pushing her forwards. The young man looked at her
steadily and gravely for a minute; then rose, and carefully marking
the page in the folio, which hitherto had laid open upon his knee,
said, still in the same heavy, indifferent manner, 'I will call my
mother; she will know.'</p>

<p>He opened a door which looked into a warm bright kitchen, ruddy
with the light of the fire, over which three women were apparently
engaged in cooking something, while a fourth, an old Indian woman, of
a greenish-brown colour, shrivelled-up and bent with apparent age,
moved backwards and forwards, evidently fetching the others the
articles they required.</p>

<p>'Mother!' said the young man; and, having arrested her attention,
he pointed over his shoulder to the newly-arrived strangers and
returned to the study of his book, from time to time, however,
furtively examining Lois from beneath his dark shaggy eyebrows.</p>

<p>A tall, largely-made woman, past middle life, came in from the
kitchen, and stood reconnoitring the strangers.</p>

<p>Captain Holdernesse spoke--</p>

<p>'This is Lois Barclay, master Ralph Hickson's niece.'</p>

<p>'I know nothing of her,' said the mistress of the house in a deep
voice, almost as masculine as her son's.</p>

<p>'Master Hickson received his sister's letter, did he not? I sent
it off myself by a lad named Elias Wellcome, who left Boston for this
place yester morning.'</p>

<p>'Ralph Hickson has received no such letter. He lies bed-ridden in
the chamber beyond. Any letters for him must come through my hands;
wherefore I can affirm with certainty that no such letter has been
delivered here. His sister Barclay, she that was Henrietta Hickson,
and whose husband took the oaths to Charles Stuart, and stuck by his
living when all godly men left theirs'--</p>

<p>Lois, who had thought her heart was dead and cold, a minute
before, at the ungracious reception she had met with, felt words come
up into her mouth at the implied insult to her father, and spoke out,
to her own and the captain's astonishment--</p>

<p>'They might be godly men who left their churches on that day of
which you speak, madam; but they alone were not the godly men, and no
one has a right to limit true godliness for mere opinion's sake.'</p>

<p>'Well said, lass,' spoke out the captain, looking round upon her
with a kind of admiring wonder, and patting her on the back.</p>

<p>Lois and her aunt gazed into each other's eyes unflinchingly, for
a minute or two of silence; but the girl felt her colour coming and
going, while the elder woman's never varied; and the eyes of the
young maiden were filling fast with tears, while those of Grace
Hickson kept on their stare, dry and unwavering.</p>

<p>'Mother,' said the young man, rising up with a quicker motion than
any one had yet used in this house, 'it is ill speaking of such
matters when my cousin comes first among us. The Lord may give her
grace hereafter; but she has travelled from Boston city today, and
she and this seafaring man must need rest and food.'</p>

<p>He did not attend to see the effect of his words, but sat down
again, and seemed to be absorbed in his book in an instant. Perhaps
he knew that his word was law with his grim mother; for he had hardly
ceased speaking before she had pointed to a wooden settle; and,
smoothing the lines on her countenance, she said--'What Manasseh says
is true. Sit down here, while I bid Faith and Nattee get food ready;
and meanwhile I will go tell my husband that one who calls herself
his sister's child is come over to pay him a visit.'</p>

<p>She went to the door leading into the kitchen, and gave some
directions to the elder girl, whom Lois now knew to be the daughter
of the house. Faith stood impassive, while her mother spoke, scarcely
caring to look at the newly-arrived strangers. She was like her
brother Manasseh in complexion, but had handsomer features, and
large, mysterious-looking eyes, as Lois saw, when once she lifted
them up, and took in, as it were, the aspect of the sea-captain and
her cousin with one swift, searching look. About the stiff, tall,
angular mother, and the scarce less pliant figure of the daughter, a
girl of twelve years old, or thereabouts, played all manner of impish
antics, unheeded by them, as if it were her accustomed habit to peep
about, now under their arms, now at this side, now at that, making
grimaces all the while at Lois and Captain Holdernesse, who sat
facing the door, weary, and somewhat disheartened by their reception.
The captain pulled out tobacco, and began to chew it by way of
consolation; but in a moment or two his usual elasticity of spirit
came to his rescue, and he said in a low voice to Lois--</p>

<p>'That scoundrel Elias, I will give it him! If the letter had but
been delivered, thou wouldst have had a different kind of welcome;
but, as soon as I have had some victuals, I will go out and find the
lad, and bring back the letter, and that will make all right, my
wench. Nay, don't be down-hearted, for I cannot stand women's tears.
Thou'rt just worn out with the shaking and the want of food.'</p>

<p>Lois brushed away her tears, and, looking round to try and divert
her thoughts by fixing them on present objects, she caught her cousin
Manasseh's deep-set eyes furtively watching her. It was with no
unfriendly gaze; yet it made Lois uncomfortable, particularly as he
did not withdraw his looks, after he must have seen that she observed
him. She was glad when her aunt called her into an inner room to see
her uncle, and she escaped from the steady observance of her gloomy,
silent cousin.</p>

<p>Ralph Hickson was much older than his wife, and his illness made
him look older still. He had never had the force of character that
Grace, his spouse, possessed; and age and sickness had now rendered
him almost childish at times. But his nature was affectionate; and,
stretching out his trembling arms from whence he lay bedridden, he
gave Lois an unhesitating welcome, never waiting for the confirmation
of the missing letter before he acknowledged her to be his niece.</p>

<p>'Oh! 'tis kind in thee to come all across the sea to make
acquaintance with thine uncle; kind in sister Barclay to spare
thee!'</p>

<p>Lois had to tell him, there was no one living to miss her at home
in England; that, in fact, she had no home in England, no father nor
mother left upon earth; and that she had been bidden by her mother's
last words to seek him out and ask him for a home. Her words came up,
half choked from a heavy heart, and his dulled wits could not take in
their meaning without several repetitions; and then he cried like a
child, rather at his own loss of a sister whom he had not seen for
more than twenty years, than at that of the orphan's, standing before
him, trying hard not to cry, but to start bravely in this new strange
home. What most of all helped Lois in her self-restraint was her
aunt's unsympathetic look. Born and bred in New England, Grace
Hickson had a kind of jealous dislike to her husband's English
relations, which had increased since of late years his weakened mind
yearned after them; and he forgot the good reason he had had for his
self-exile, and moaned over the decision which had led to it as the
great mistake of his life. 'Come,' said she; 'it strikes me that, in
all this sorrow for the loss of one who died full of years, ye are
forgetting in Whose hands life and death are!'</p>

<p>True words, but ill-spoken at that time. Lois looked up at her
with a scarcely disguised indignation; which increased as she heard
the contemptuous tone in which her aunt went on talking to Ralph
Hickson, even while she was arranging his bed with a regard to his
greater comfort.</p>

<p>'One would think thou wert a godless man, by the moan thou art
always making over spilt milk; and truth is, thou art but childish in
thine old age. When we were wed, thou left all things to the Lord; I
would never have married thee else. Nay, lass,' said she, catching
the expression on Lois's face, 'thou art never going to browbeat me
with thine angry looks. I do my duty as I read it, and there is never
a man in Salem that dare speak a word to Grace Hickson about either
her works or her faith. Godly Mr Cotton Mather bath said, that even
he might learn of me; and I would advise thee rather to humble
thyself, and see if the Lord may not convert thee from thy ways,
since He has sent thee to dwell, as it were, in Zion, where the
precious dew fails daily on Aaron's beard.'</p>

<p>Lois felt ashamed and sorry to find that her aunt had so truly
interpreted the momentary expression of her features; she blamed
herself a little for the feeling that had caused that expression,
trying to think how much her aunt might have been troubled with
something, before the unexpected irruption of the strangers, and
again hoping that the remembrance of this misunderstanding would soon
pass away. So she endeavoured to reassure herself, and not to give
way to her uncle's tender trembling pressure of her hand, as, at her
aunt's bidding, she wished him 'goodnight', and returned into the
outer, or 'keeping'--room, where all the family were now assembled,
ready for the meal of flourcakes and venison steaks which Nattee, the
Indian servant, was bringing in from the kitchen. No one seemed to
have been speaking to Captain Holdernesse, while Lois had been away.
Manasseh sat quiet and silent where he did, with the book open upon
his knee; his eyes thoughtfully fixed on vacancy, as if he saw a
vision, or dreamed dreams. Faith stood by the table, lazily directing
Nattee in her preparations; and Prudence lofted against the
door-frame, between kitchen and keeping-room, playing tricks on the
old Indian woman, as she passed backwards and forwards, till Nattee
appeared to be in a state of strong irritation, which she tried in
vain to suppress; as, whenever she showed any sign of it, Prudence
only seemed excited to greater mischief. When all was ready, Manasseh
lifted his right hand and 'asked a blessing,' as it was termed; but
the grace became a long prayer for abstract spiritual blessings, for
strength to combat Satan, and to quench his fiery darts, and at
length assumed--so Lois thought--a purely personal character, as if
the young man had forgotten the occasion, and even the people
present, but was searching into the nature of the diseases that beset
his own sick soul, and spreading them out before the Lord. He was
brought back by a pluck at the coat from Prudence; he opened his shut
eyes, cast an angry glance at the child, who made a face at him for
sole reply, and then he sat down, and they all fell to. Grace Hickson
would have thought her hospitality sadly at fault, if she had allowed
Captain Holdernesse to go out in search of a bed. Skins were spread
for him on the floor of the keeping-room; a Bible and a square bottle
of spirits were placed on the table to supply his wants during the
night; and, in spite of all the cares and troubles, temptations, or
sins of the members of that household, they were all asleep before
the town clock struck ten.</p>

<p>In the morning, the captain's first care was to go out in search
of the boy Elias and the missing letter. He met him bringing it with
an easy conscience, for, thought Elias, a few hours sooner or later
will make no difference; tonight or the morrow morning will be all
the same. But he was startled into a sense of wrong-doing, by a sound
box on the ear from the very man who had charged him to deliver it
speedily, and whom he believed to be at that very moment in Boston
city.</p>

<p>The letter delivered, all possible proof being given that Lois had
a right to claim a home from her nearest relations, Captain
Holdernesse thought it best to take leave.</p>

<p>'Thou'lt take to them, lass, maybe, when there is no one here to
make thee think on the old country. Nay, nay! parting is hard work at
all times, and best get hard work done out of hand! Keep up thine
heart, my wench, and I'll come back and see thee next spring, if we
are all spared till then; and who knows what fine young miller mayn't
come with me? Don't go and get wed to a praying Puritan, meanwhile!
There, there; I'm off. God bless thee!'</p>

<p>And Lois was left alone in New England.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<p>It was hard work for Lois to win herself a place in this family.
Her aunt was a woman of narrow, strong affections. Her love for her
husband, if ever she had any, was burnt out and dead long ago. What
she did for him, she did from duty; but duty was not strong enough to
restrain that little member, the tongue; and Lois's heart often bled
at the continual flow of contemptuous reproof which Grace constantly
addressed to her husband, even while she was sparing no pains or
trouble to minister to his bodily case and comfort. It was more as a
relief to herself that she spoke in this way, than with any desire
that her speeches should affect him; and he was too deadened by
illness to feel hurt by them; or, it may be, the constant repetition
of her sarcasms had made him indifferent; at any rate, so that he had
his food and his state of bodily warmth attended to, he very seldom
seemed to care much for anything else. Even his first flow of
affection towards Lois was soon exhausted; he cared for her, because
she arranged his pillows well and skilfully, and because she could
prepare new and dainty kinds of food for his sick appetite, but no
longer for her as his dead sister's child. Still he did care for her,
and Lois was too glad of his little hoard of affection to examine how
or why it was given. To him she could give pleasure, but apparently
to no one else in that household. Her aunt looked askance at her for
many reasons: the first coming of Lois to Salem was inopportune; the
expression of disapprobation on her face on that evening still
lingered and rankled in Grace's memory; early prejudices, and
feelings, and prepossessions of the English girl were all on the side
of what would now be called Church and State, what was then esteemed
in that country a superstitious observance of the directions of a
Popish rubric, and a servile regard for the family of an oppressing
and irreligious king. Nor is it to be supposed that Lois did not
feel, and feel acutely, the want of sympathy that all those with whom
she was now living manifested towards the old hereditary loyalty
(religious as well as political loyalty) in which she had been
brought up. With her aunt and Manasseh it was more than want of
sympathy; it was positive, active antipathy to all the ideas Lois
held most dear. The very allusion, however incidentally made, to the
little old grey church at Barford, where her father had preached so
long--the occasional reference to the troubles in which her own
country had been distracted when she left--and the adherence, in
which she had been brought up, to the notion that the king could do
no wrong, seemed to irritate Manasseh past endurance. He would get up
from his reading, his constant employment when at home, and walk
angrily about the room after Lois had said anything of this kind,
muttering to himself; and once he had even stopped before her, and in
a passionate tone bade her not talk so like a fool. Now this was very
different to his mother's sarcastic, contemptuous way of treating all
poor Lois's little loyal speeches. Grace would lead her on--at least
she did at first, till experience made Lois wiser--to express her
thoughts on such subjects, till, just when the girl's heart was
opening, her aunt would turn round upon her with some bitter sneer
that roused all the evil feelings in Lois's disposition by its sting.
Now Manasseh seemed, through all his anger, to be so really grieved
by what he considered her error, that he went much nearer to
convincing her that there might be two sides to a question. Only this
was a view that it appeared like treachery to her dead father's
memory to entertain.</p>

<p>Somehow, Lois felt instinctively that Manasseh was really friendly
towards her. He was little in the house; there was farming, and some
kind of mercantile business to be transacted by him, as real head of
the house; and, as the season drew on, he went shooting and hunting
in the surrounding forests, with a daring which caused his mother to
warn and reprove him in private, although to the neighbours she
boasted largely of her son's courage and disregard of danger. Lois
did not often walk out for the mere sake of walking; there was
generally some household errand to be transacted when any of the
women of the family went abroad; but once or twice she had caught
glimpses of the dreary, dark wood, hemming in the cleared land on all
sides--the great wood with its perpetual movement of branch and
bough, and its solemn wail, that came into the very streets of Salem
when certain winds blew, bearing the sound of the pine-trees clear
upon the cars that had leisure to listen. And, from all accounts,
this old forest, girdling round the settlement, was full of dreaded
and mysterious beasts, and still more to be dreaded Indians, stealing
in and out among the shadows, intent on bloody schemes against the
Christian people: panther-streaked, shaven Indians, in league by
their own confession, as well as by the popular belief, with evil
powers.</p>

<p>Nattee, the old Indian servant, would occasionally make Lois's
blood run cold, as she and Faith and Prudence listened to the wild
stories she told them of the wizards of her race. It was often in the
kitchen, in the darkening evening, while some cooking process was
going on, that the old Indian crone, sitting on her haunches by the
bright red wood embers which sent up no flame, but a lurid light
reversing the shadows of all the faces around, told her weird
stories, while they were awaiting the rising of the dough, perchance,
out of which the household bread had to be made. There ran through
these stories always a ghastly, unexpressed suggestion of some human
sacrifice being needed to complete the success of any incantation to
the Evil One; and the poor old creature, herself believing and
shuddering as she narrated her tale in broken English, took a
strange, unconscious pleasure in her power over her hearers--young
girls of the oppressing race, which had brought her down into a state
little differing from slavery, and reduced her people to outcasts on
the hunting-grounds which had belonged to her fathers.</p>

<p>After such tales, it required no small effort on Lois's part to go
out, at her aunt's command, into the common pasture round the town,
and bring the cattle home at night. Who knew but what the
double-headed snake might start up from each blackberry bush--that
wicked, cunning, accursed creature in the service of the Indian
wizards, that had such power over all those white maidens who met the
eyes placed at either end of his long, sinuous, creeping body, so
that, loathe him, loathe the Indian race as they would, off they must
go into the forest to seek out some Indian man, and must beg to be
taken into his wigwam, adjuring faith and race for ever? Or there
were spells--so Nattee said--hidden about the ground by the wizards,
which changed that person's nature who found them; so that, gentle
and loving as they might have been before, thereafter they took no
pleasure but in the cruel torments of others, and had a strange power
given to them of causing such torments at their will. Once, Nattee,
speaking low to Lois, who was alone with her in the kitchen,
whispered out her terrified belief that such a spell had Prudence
found; and, when the Indian showed her arms to Lois, all pinched
black and blue by the impish child, the English girl began to be
afraid of her cousin as of one possessed. But it was not Nattee
alone, nor young imaginative girls alone, that believed in these
stories. We can afford to smile at them now; but our English
ancestors entertained superstitions of much the same character at the
same period, and with less excuse, as the circumstances surrounding
them were better known, and consequently more explicable by common
sense, than the real mysteries of the deep, untrodden forests of New
England. The gravest divines not only believed stories similar to
that of the double-headed serpent, and other tales of witchcraft, but
they made such narrations the subjects of preaching and prayer; and,
as cowardice makes us all cruel, men who were blameless in many of
the relations of life, and even praiseworthy in some, became, from
superstition, cruel persecutors about this time, showing no mercy
towards any one whom they believed to be in league with the Evil
One.</p>

<p>Faith was the person with whom the English girl was the most
intimately associated in her uncle's house. The two were about the
same age, and certain household employments were shared between them.
They took it in turns to call in the cows, to make up the butter
which had been churned by Hosea, a stiff, old out-door servant, in
whom Grace Hickson placed great confidence; and each lassie had her
great spinning-wheel for wool, and her lesser for flax, before a
month had elapsed after Lois's coming. Faith was a grave, silent
person, never merry, sometimes very sad, though Lois was a long time
in even guessing why. She would try, in her sweet, simple fashion, to
cheer her cousin up, when the latter was depressed, by telling her
old stories of English ways and life. Occasionally, Faith seemed to
care to listen; occasionally, she did not heed one word, but dreamed
on. Whether of the past or of the future, who could tell?</p>

<p>Stern old ministers came in to pay their pastoral visits. On such
occasions, Grace Hickson would put on clean apron and clean cap, and
make them more welcome than she was ever seen to do any one else,
bringing out the best provisions of her store, and setting of all
before them. Also, the great Bible was brought forth, and Hosea and
Nattee summoned from their work, to listen while the minister read a
chapter, and, as he read, expounded it at considerable length. After
this all knelt, while he, standing, lifted up his right hand, and
prayed for all possible combinations of Christian men, for all
possible cases of spiritual need; and lastly, taking the individuals
before him, he would put up a very personal supplication for each,
according to his notion of their wants. At first, Lots wondered at
the aptitude of one or two of his prayers of this description to the
outward circumstances of each case; but, when she perceived that her
aunt had usually a pretty long confidential conversation with the
minister in the early part of his visit, she became aware that he
received both his impressions and his knowledge through the medium of
'that godly woman, Grace Hickson;' and I am afraid she paid less
regard to the prayer 'for the maiden from another land, who bath
brought the errors of that land as a seed with her, even across the
great ocean, and who is letting even now the little seeds shoot up
into an evil tree, in which all unclean creatures may find
shelter.'</p>

<p>'I like the prayers of our Church better,' said Lois one day to
Faith. 'No clergyman in England can pray his own words; and therefore
it is that he does not judge of others so as to fit his prayers to
what he esteems to be their case, as Mr Tappau did this morning.'</p>

<p>'I hate Mr Tappau!' said Faith shortly, a passionate flash of
light coming out of her dark, heavy eyes.</p>

<p>'Why so, cousin? It seems to me as if he were a good man, although
I like not his prayers.'</p>

<p>Faith only repeated her words, 'I hate him!'</p>

<p>Lois was sorry for this strong, bad feeling; instinctively sorry,
for she was loving herself, delighted in being loved, and felt a jar
run through her at every sign of want of love in others. But she did
not know what to say, and was silent at the time. Faith, too, went on
turning her wheel with vehemence, but spoke never a word until her
thread snapped; and then she pushed the wheel away hastily, and left
the room.</p>

<p>Then Prudence crept softly up to Lois's side. This strange child
seemed to be tossed about by varying moods: today she was caressing
and communicative; tomorrow she might be deceitful, mocking, and so
indifferent to the pain or sorrows of others that you could call her
almost inhuman.</p>

<p>'So thou dost not like Pastor Tappau's prayers?' she
whispered.</p>

<p>Lots was sorry to have been overheard; but she neither would nor
could take back her words.</p>

<p>'I like them not so well as the prayers I used to hear at
home.'</p>

<p>'Mother says thy home was with the ungodly. Nay, don't look at me
so--it was not I that said it. I'm none so fond of praying myself,
nor of Pastor Tappau, for that matter. But Faith cannot abide him,
and I know why. Shall I tell thee, Cousin Lois?'</p>

<p>'No! Faith did not tell me; and she was the right person to give
her own reasons.'</p>

<p>'Ask her where young Mr Nolan is gone to, and thou wilt hear. I
have seen Faith cry by the hour together about Mr Nolan.'</p>

<p>'Hush, child! hush!' said Lois, for she heard Faith's approaching
step, and feared lest she should overhear what they were saying.</p>

<p>The truth was that, a year or two before, there had been a great
struggle in Salem village, a great division in the religious body,
and Pastor Tappau had been the leader of the more violent, and,
ultimately, the successful party. In consequence of this, the less
popular minister, Mr Nolan, had had to leave the place. And him Faith
Hickson loved with all the strength of her passionate heart, although
he never was aware of the attachment he had excited, and her own
family were too regardless of manifestations of mere feeling ever to
observe the signs of any emotion on her part. But the old Indian
servant Nattee saw and observed them all. She knew, as well as if she
had been told the reason, why Faith had lost all care about father or
mother, brother and sister, about household work and daily
occupation; nay, about the observances of religion as well. Nattee
read the meaning of the deep smouldering of Faith's dislike to Pastor
Tappau aright; the Indian woman understood why the girl (whom alone
of all the white people she loved) avoided the old minister--would
hide in the wood-stack, sooner than be called in to listen to his
exhortations and prayers. With savage, untutored people, it is not
'Love me, love my dog,'--they are often jealous of the creature
beloved; but it is, 'Whom thou hatest I will hate;' and Nattee's
feeling towards Pastor Tappau was even an exaggeration of the mute,
unspoken hatred of Faith.</p>

<p>For a long time, the cause of her cousin's dislike and avoidance
of the minister was a mystery to Lois; but the name of Nolan remained
in her memory, whether she would or no; and it was more from girlish
interest in a suspected love affair, than from any indifferent and
heartless curiosity, that she could not help piecing together little
speeches and actions with Faith's interest in the absent banished
minister, for an explanatory clue, till not a doubt remained in her
mind. And this without any further communication with Prudence, for
Lois declined hearing any more on the subject from her, and so gave
deep offence.</p>

<p>Faith grew sadder and duller, as the autumn drew on. She lost her
appetite; her brown complexion became sallow and colourless; her dark
eyes looked hollow and wild. The first of November was near at hand.
Lois, in her instinctive, well-intentioned efforts to bring some life
and cheerfulness into the monotonous household, had been telling
Faith of many English customs, silly enough, no doubt, and which
scarcely lighted up a flicker of interest in the American girl's
mind. The cousins were lying awake in their bed, in the great
unplastered room, which was in part storeroom, in part bedroom. Lois
was full of sympathy for Faith that night. For long she had listened
to her cousin's heavy, irrepressible sighs, in silence. Faith sighed,
because her grief was of too old a date for violent emotion or
crying. Lois listened without speaking in the dark, quiet night
hours, for a long, long time. She kept quite still, because she
thought such vent for sorrow might relieve her cousin's weary heart.
But, when at length, instead of lying motionless, Faith seemed to be
growing restless, even to convulsive motions of her limbs, Lois began
to speak, to talk about England, and the dear old ways at home,
without exciting much attention on Faith's part; until at length she
fell upon the subject of Hallow-e'en, and told about customs then and
long afterwards practised in England, and that have scarcely yet died
out in Scotland. As she told of tricks she had often played, of the
apple eaten facing a mirror, of the dripping sheet, of the basins of
water, of the nuts burning side by side, and many other such innocent
ways of divination, by which laughing, trembling English maidens
sought to see the form of their future husbands, if husbands they
were to have: then Faith listened breathlessly, asking short eager
questions, as if some ray of hope had entered into her gloomy heart.
Lois went on speaking, telling her of all the stories that would
confirm the truth of the second sight vouchsafed to all seekers in
the accustomed methods; half believing, half incredulous herself, but
desiring, above all things, to cheer up poor Faith.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Prudence rose up from her truckle-bed in the dim corner
of the room. They had not thought that she was awake; but she had
been listening long.</p>

<p>'Cousin Lois may go out and meet Satan by the brookside, if she
will; but, if thou goest, Faith, I will tell mother--ay, and I will
tell Pastor Tappau, too. Hold thy stories, Cousin Lois; I am afeared
of my very life. I would rather never be wed at all, than feel the
touch of the creature that would take the apple out of my hand, as I
held it over my left shoulder.' The excited girl gave a loud scream
of terror at the image her fancy had conjured up. Faith and Lois
sprang out towards her, flying across the moon-lit room in their
white night-gowns. At the same instant, summoned by the same cry,
Grace Hickson came to her child.</p>

<p>'Hush! hush!' said Faith, authoritatively.</p>

<p>'What is it, my wench?' asked Grace. While Lois, feeling as if she
had done all the mischief, kept silence.</p>

<p>'Take her away, take her away!' screamed Prudence. 'Look over her
shoulder--her left shoulder--the Evil One is there now, I see him
stretching over for the half-bitten apple.'</p>

<p>'What is it she says?' said Grace austerely.</p>

<p>'She is dreaming,' said Faith; 'Prudence, hold thy tongue.' And
she pinched the child severely, while Lois more tenderly tried to
soothe the alarms she felt that she had conjured up.</p>

<p>'Be quiet, Prudence,' said she, 'and go to sleep! I will stay by
thee, till thou hast gone off into slumber.'</p>

<p>'No, no! go away!' sobbed Prudence, who was really terrified at
first, but was now assuming more alarm than she felt, from the
pleasure she received at perceiving herself the centre of attention.
'Faith shall stay by me, not you, wicked English witch!'</p>

<p>So Faith sat by her sister; and Grace, displeased and perplexed,
withdrew to her own bed, purposing to inquire more into the matter in
the morning. Lois only hoped it might all be forgotten by that rime,
and resolved never to talk again of such things. But an event
happened in the remaining hours of the night to change the current of
affairs. While Grace had been absent from her room, her husband had
had another paralytic stroke: whether he, too, had been alarmed by
that eldritch scream no one could ever know. By the faint light of
the rush-candle burning at the bed-side, his wife perceived that a
great change had taken place in his aspect on her return: the
irregular breathing came almost like snorts--the end was drawing
near. The family were roused, and all help given that either the
doctor or experience could suggest. But before the late November
morning-light, all was ended for Ralph Hickson.</p>

<p>The whole of the ensuing day, they sat or moved in darkened rooms,
and spoke few words, and those below their breath. Manasseh kept at
home, regretting his father, no doubt, but showing little emotion.
Faith was the child that bewailed her loss most grievously; she had a
warm heart, hidden away somewhere under her moody exterior, and her
father had shown her far more passive kindness than ever her mother
had done; for Grace made distinct favourites of Manasseh, her only
son, and Prudence, her youngest child. Lois was about as unhappy as
any of them; for she had felt strongly drawn towards her uncle as her
kindest friend, and the sense of his loss renewed the old sorrow she
had experienced at her own parent's death. But she had no time and no
place to cry in. On her devolved many of the cares which it would
have seemed indecorous in the nearer relatives to interest themselves
in enough to take an active part: the change required in their dress,
the household preparations for the sad feast of the funeral--Lois had
to arrange all under her aunt's stern direction.</p>

<p>But, a day or two afterwards--the last day before the
funeral---she went into the yard to fetch in some faggots for the
oven; it was a solemn, beautiful, starlit evening, and some sudden
sense of desolation in the midst of the vast universe thus revealed
touched Lois's heart, and she sat down behind the wood-stack, and
cried very plentiful tears.</p>

<p>She was startled by Manasseh, who suddenly turned the corner of
the stack, and stood before her.</p>

<p>'Lois crying!'</p>

<p>'Only a little,' she said, rising up, and gathering her bundle of
faggots; for she dreaded being questioned by her grim, impassive
cousin. To her surprise, he laid his hand on her arm, and said--</p>

<p>'Stop one minute. Why art thou crying, cousin?'</p>

<p>'I don't know,' she said, just like a child questioned in like
manner; and she was again on the point of weeping. 'My father was
very kind to thee, Lois; I do not wonder that thou grievest after
him. But the Lord who taketh away can restore tenfold. I will be as
kind as my father--yea, kinder. This is not a time to talk of
marriage and giving in marriage. But after we have buried our dead, I
wish to speak to thee.'</p>

<p>Lois did not cry now; but she shrank with affright. What did her
cousin mean? She would far rather that he had been angry with her for
unreasonable grieving, for folly.</p>

<p>She avoided him carefully--as carefully as she could, without
seeming to dread him--for the next few days. Sometimes, she thought
it must have been a bad dream; for, if there had been no English
lover in the case, no other man in the whole world, she could never
have thought of Manasseh as her husband; indeed, till now, there had
been nothing in his words or actions to suggest such an idea. Now it
had been suggested, there was no telling how much she loathed him. He
might be good, and pious--he doubtless was--but his dark, fixed eyes,
moving so slowly and heavily, his lank, black hair, his grey, coarse
skin, all made her dislike him now--all his personal ugliness and
ungainliness struck on her senses with ajar, since those few words
spoken behind the hay-stack.</p>

<p>She knew that, sooner or later, the time must come for further
discussion of this subject; but, like a coward, she tried to put it
off by clinging to her aunt's apron-string, for she was sure that
Grace Hickson had far different views for her only son. As, indeed,
she had; for she was an ambitious, as well as a religious, woman;
and, by an early purchase of land in Salem village, the Hicksons had
become wealthy people, without any great exertions of their
own--partly, also, by the silent process of accumulation; for they
had never cared to change their manner of living, from the time when
it had been suitable to a far smaller income than that which they at
present enjoyed. So much for worldly circumstances. As for their
worldly character, it stood as high. No one could say a word against
any of their habits or actions. Their righteousness and godliness
were patent to every one's eyes. So Grace Hickson thought herself
entitled to pick and choose among the maidens, before she should meet
with one fitted to be Manasseh's wife. None in Salem came up to her
imaginary standard. She had it in her mind even at this very time, so
soon after her husband's death, to go to Boston, and take counsel
with the leading ministers there, with worthy Mr Cotton Mather at
their head, and see if they could tell her of a well-favoured and
godly young maiden in their congregations worthy of being the wife of
her son. But, besides good looks and godliness, the wench must have
good birth and good wealth, or Grace Hickson would have put her
contemptuously on one side. When once this paragon was found, and the
ministers had approved, Grace anticipated no difficulty on her son's
part. So Lois was right in feeling that her aunt would dislike any
speech of marriage between Manasseh and herself.</p>

<p>But the girl was brought to bay one day, in this wise. Manasseh
had ridden forth on some business, which every one said would occupy
him the whole day; but, meeting the man with whom he had to transact
his affairs, he returned earlier than any one expected. He missed
Lois from the keeping-room, where his sisters were spinning, almost
immediately. His mother sat by at her knitting; he could see Nattee
in the kitchen through the open door. He was too reserved to ask
where Lois was; but he quietly sought till he found her, in the great
loft, already piled with winter stores of fruit and vegetables. Her
aunt had sent her there to examine the apples one by one, and pick
out such as were unsound for immediate use. She was stooping down,
and intent upon this work, and was hardly aware of his approach,
until she lifted up her head and saw him standing close before her.
She dropped the apple she was holding, went a little paler than her
wont, and faced him in silence.</p>

<p>'Lois,' he said, 'thou rememberest the words that I spoke while we
yet mourned over my father. I think that I am called to marriage now,
as the head of this household. And I have seen no maiden so pleasant
in my sight as thou art, Lois!' He tried to take her hand. But she
put it behind her with a childish shake of her head, and, half
crying, said--</p>

<p>'Please, Cousin Manasseh, do not say this to me! I dare say you
ought to be married, being the head of the household now; but I don't
want to be married. I would rather not.'</p>

<p>'That is well spoken,' replied he; frowning a little,
nevertheless. 'I should not like to take to wife an over-forward
maiden, ready to jump at wedlock. Besides, the congregation might
talk, if we were to be married too soon after my father's death. We
have, perchance, said enough, even now. But I wished thee to have thy
mind set at case as to thy future well-doing. Thou wilt have leisure
to think of it, and to bring thy mind more fully round to it.' Again
he held out his hand. This time she took hold of it with a free,
frank gesture.</p>

<p>'I owe you somewhat for your kindness to me ever since I came,
Cousin Manasseh; and I have no way of paying you but by telling you
truly I can love you as a dear friend, if you will let me, but never
as a wife.'</p>

<p>He flung her hand away, but did not take his eyes off her face,
though his glance was lowering and gloomy. He muttered something
which she did not quite hear; and so she went on bravely, although
she kept trembling a little, and had much ado to keep from
crying.</p>

<p>'Pleae, let me tell you all! There was a young man in
Barford---nay, Manasseh, I cannot speak if you are so angry; it is
hard work to tell you anyhow--he said that he wanted to marry me; but
I was poor, and his father would have none of it; and I do not want
to marry any one; but, if I did, it would be'--Her voice dropped, and
her blushes told the rest. Manasseh stood looking at her with sullen,
hollow eyes, that had a gathering touch of wildness in them; and then
he said--</p>

<p>'It is borne in upon me--verily, I see it as in a vision--that
thou must be my spouse, and no other man's. Thou canst not escape
what is fore-doomed. Months ago, when I set myself to read the old
godly books in which my soul used to delight until thy coming; I saw
no letter of printer's ink marked upon the page, but I saw a gold and
ruddy type of some unknown language, the meaning whereof was
whispered into my soul; it was, 'Marry Lois! marry Lois!' And, when
my father died, I knew it was the beginning of the end. It is the
Lord's will, Lois, and thou canst not escape from it.' And again he
would have taken her hand, and drawn her towards him. But this time
she eluded him with ready movement.</p>

<p>'I do not acknowledge it to be the Lord's will, Manasseh,' said
she. 'It is not "borne in upon me," as you Puritans call it, that I
am to be your wife. I am none so set upon wedlock as to take you,
even though there be no other chance for me. For I do not care for
you as I ought to care for my husband. But I could have cared for you
very much as a cousin--as a kind cousin.'</p>

<p>She stopped speaking; she could not choose the right words with
which to speak to him of her gratitude and friendliness, which yet
could never be any feeling nearer and dearer, no more than two
parallel lines can ever meet.</p>

<p>But he was so convinced by what he considered the spirit of
prophecy, that Lois was to be his wife, that he felt rather more
indignant at what he considered to be her resistance to the
preordained decree, than really anxious as to the result. Again he
tried to convince her that neither he nor she had any choice in the
matter, by saying--</p>

<p>'The voice said unto me "Marry Lois;" and I said, "I will, Lord.
"'</p>

<p>'But,' Lois replied, 'the voice, as you call it, has never spoken
such a word to me.'</p>

<p>'Lois,' he answered solemnly, 'it will speak. And then wilt thou
obey, even as Samuel did?'</p>

<p>'No; indeed I cannot!' she answered briskly. 'I may take a dream
to be the truth, and hear my own fancies, if I think about them too
long. But I cannot marry any one from obedience.'</p>

<p>'Lois, Lois, thou art as yet unregenerate; but I have seen thee in
a vision as one of the elect, robed in white. As yet thy faith is too
weak for thee to obey meekly; but it shall not always be so. I will
pray that thou mayest see thy preordained course. Meanwhile, I will
smooth away all worldly obstacles.'</p>

<p>'Cousin Manasseh! Cousin Manasseh!' cried Lois after him, as he
was leaving the room, 'come back! I cannot put it in strong enough
words. Manasseh, there is no power in heaven or earth that can make
me love thee enough to marry thee, or to wed thee without such love.
And this I say solemnly, because it is better that this should end at
once.'</p>

<p>For a moment he was staggered; then he lifted up his hands, and
said--</p>

<p>'God forgive thee thy blasphemy! Remember Hazael, who said, "Is
thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing?" and went
straight and did it, because his evil courses were fixed and
appointed for him from before the foundation of the world. And shall
not thy paths be laid out among the godly, as it bath been foretold
to me?'</p>

<p>He went away; and for a minute or two Lois felt as if his words
must come true, and that, struggle as she would, hate her doom as she
would, she must become his wife; and, under the circumstances, many a
girl would have succumbed to her apparent fate. Isolated from all
previous connections, hearing no word from England, living in the
heavy, monotonous routine of a family with one man for head, and this
man esteemed a hero by most of those around him, simply because he
was the only man in the family--these facts alone would have formed
strong presumptions that most girls would have yielded to the offers
of such a one. But, besides this, there was much to tell upon the
imagination in those days, in that place and time. It was prevalently
believed that there were manifestations of spiritual influence--of
the direct influence both of good and bad spirits--constantly to be
perceived in the course of men's lives. Lots were drawn, as guidance
from the Lord; the Bible was opened, and the leaves allowed to fall
apart; and the first text the eye fell upon was supposed to be
appointed from above as a direction. Sounds were heard that could not
be accounted for; they were made by the evil spirits not yet banished
from the desert-places of which they had so long held possession.
Sights, inexplicable and mysterious, were dimly seen--Satan, in some
shape, seeking whom he might devour. And, at the beginning of the
long winter season, such whispered tales, such old temptations and
hauntings, and devilish terrors, were supposed to be peculiarly rife.
Salem was, as it were, snowed up, and left to prey upon itself The
long, dark evenings; the dimly-lighted rooms; the creaking passages,
where heterogeneous articles were piled away, out of the reach of the
keen-piercing frost, and where occasionally, in the dead of night, a
sound was heard, as of some heavy falling body, when, next morning,
everything appeared to be in its right place (so accustomed are we to
measure noises by comparison with themselves, and not with the
absolute stillness of the night-season); the white mist, coming
nearer and nearer to the windows every evening in strange shapes,
like phantoms--all these, and many other circumstances: such as the
distant fall of mighty trees in the mysterious forests girdling them
round; the faint whoop and cry of some Indian seeking his camp, and
unwittingly nearer to the white man's settlement than either he or
they would have liked, could they have chosen; the hungry yells of
the wild beasts approaching the cattle-pens--these were the things
which made that winter life in Salem, in the memorable time of
1691-2, seem strange, and haunted, and terrific to many; peculiarly
weird and awful to the English girl, in her first year's sojourn in
America.</p>

<p>And now, imagine Lois worked upon perpetually by Manasseh's
conviction that it was decreed that she should be his wife, and you
will see that she was not without courage and spirit to resist as she
did, steadily, firmly, and yet sweetly, Take one instance out of
many, when her nerves were subjected to a shock--slight in relation,
it is true; but then remember that she had been all day, and for many
days, shut up within doors, in a dull light that at midday was almost
dark with a long-continued snowstorm. Evening was coming on, and the
wood fire was more cheerful than any of the human beings surrounding
it; the monotonous whirr of the smaller spinning-wheels had been
going on all day, and the store of flax downstairs was nearly
exhausted: when Grace Hickson bade Lois fetch down some more from the
store room, before the light so entirely waned away that it could not
be found without a candle, and a candle it would be dangerous to
carry into that apartment full of combustible materials, especially
at this time of hard frost, when every drop of water was locked up
and bound in icy hardness. So Lois went, half-shrinking from the long
passage that led to the stairs leading up into the store room, for it
was in this passage that the strange night-sounds were heard, which
every one had begun to notice, and speak about in lowered tones. She
sang, however, as she went, 'to keep her courage up,' in a subdued
voice, the evening hymn she had so often sung in Barford church--</p>

<p>'Glory to Thee, my God, this night;' and so it was, I suppose,
that she never heard the breathing or motion of any creature near
her, till, just as she was loading herself with flax to carry down,
she heard some one--it was Manasseh--say close to her car; 'Has the
voice spoken yet? Speak, Lois! Has the voice spoken yet to thee--that
speaketh to me day and night, "Marry Lois"?'</p>

<p>She started and turned a little sick, but spoke almost directly in
a brave, clear manner--</p>

<p>'No, Cousin Manasseh! And it never will.'</p>

<p>'Then I must wait yet longer,' he replied hoarsely, as if to
himself. 'But all submission--all submission.'</p>

<p>At last, a break came upon the monotony of the long, dark winter.
The parishioners once more raised the discussion whether--the parish
extending as it did--it was not absolutely necessary for Pastor
Tappau to have help. This question had been mooted once before; and
then Pastor Tappau had acquiesced in the necessity, and all had gone
on smoothly for some months after the appointment of his assistant;
until a feeling had sprung up on the part of the elder minister,
which might have been called jealousy of the younger, if so godly a
man as Pastor Tappau could have been supposed to entertain so evil a
passion. However that might be, two parties were speedily formed; the
younger and more ardent being in favour of Mr Nolan, the elder and
more persistent---and, at the time, the more numerous--clinging to
the old, grey-headed, dogmatic Mr Tappau, who had married them,
baptized their children, and was to them, literally, as a 'pillar of
the church.' So Mr Nolan left Salem, carrying away with him,
possibly, more hearts than that of Faith Hickson's; but certainly she
had never been the same creature since.</p>

<p>But now--Christmas, 1691--one or two of the older members of the
congregation being dead, and some who were younger men having come to
settle in Salem--Mr Tappau being also older, and, some charitably
supposed, wiser--a fresh effort had been made, and Mr Nolan was
returning to labour in ground apparently smoothed over. Lois had
taken a keen interest in all the proceedings for Faith's sake--far
more than the latter did for herself, any spectator would have said.
Faith's wheel never went faster or slower, her thread never broke,
her colour never came, her eyes were never uplifted with sudden
interest, all the time these discussions respecting Mr Nolan's return
were going on. But Lois, after the hint given by Prudence, had found
a clue to many a sigh and look of despairing sorrow, even without the
help of Nattee's improvised songs, in which, under strange
allegories, the helpless love of her favourite was told to ears
heedless of all meaning, except those of the tenderhearted and
sympathetic Lois. Occasionally, she heard a strange chant of the old
Indian woman's--half in her own language, half in broken
English--droned over some simmering pipkin, from which the smell was,
to say the least, unearthly. Once, on perceiving this odour in the
keeping-room, Grace Hickson suddenly exclaimed--</p>

<p>'Nattee is at her heathen ways again; we shall have some mischief
unless she is stayed.'</p>

<p>But Faith, moving quicker than ordinary, said something about
putting a stop to it, and so forestalled her mother's evident
intention of going into the kitchen. Faith shut the door between the
two rooms, and entered upon some remonstrance with Nattee; but no one
could hear the words used. Faith and Nattee seemed more bound
together by love and common interest than any other two among the
self-contained individuals comprising this household. Lois sometimes
felt as if her presence, as a third, interrupted some confidential
talk between her cousin and the old servant. And yet she was fond of
Faith, and could almost think that Faith liked her more than she did
either mother, brother, or sister; for the first two were indifferent
as to any unspoken feelings, while Prudence delighted in discovering
them, only to make an amusement to herself out of them.</p>

<p>One day, Lois was sitting by herself at her sewing-table, while
Faith and Nattee were holding one of their secret conclaves, from
which Lois felt herself to be tacitly excluded: when the outer door
opened, and a tall, pale young man, in the strict professional habit
of a minister, entered. Lois sprang up with a smile and a look of
welcome for Faith's sake; for this must be the Mr Nolan whose name
had been on the tongue of every one for days, and who was, as Lois
knew, expected to arrive the day before.</p>

<p>He seemed half-surprised at the glad alacrity with which he was
received by this stranger: possibly, he had not heard of the English
girl who was an inmate in the house where formerly he had seen only
grave, solemn, rigid, or heavy faces, and had been received with a
stiff form of welcome, very different from the blushing, smiling,
dimpled looks that innocently met him with the greeting almost of an
old acquaintance. Lois, having placed a chair for him, hastened out
to call Faith, never doubting but that the feeling which her cousin
entertained for the young pastor was mutual, although it might be
unrecognised in its full depth by either.</p>

<p>'Faith!' said she, bright and breathless. 'Guess--No,' checking
herself to an assumed unconsciousness of any particular importance
likely to be affixed to her words; 'Mr Nolan, the new pastor, is in
the keeping-room. He has asked for my aunt and Manasseh. My aunt is
gone to the prayer-meeting at Pastor Tappau's, and Manasseh is away.'
Lois went on speaking, to give Faith time; for the girl had become
deadly white at the intelligence, while, at the same time, her eyes
met the keen, cunning eyes of the old Indian with a peculiar look of
half-wondering awe; while Nattee's looks expressed triumphant
satisfaction.</p>

<p>'Go,' said Lois, smoothing Faith's hair, and kissing the white,
cold cheek, 'or he will wonder why no one comes to see him, and
perhaps think he is not welcome.' Faith went without another word
into the keeping-room, and shut the door of communication. Nattee and
Lois were left together. Lois felt as happy as if some piece of good
fortune had befallen herself. For the time, her growing dread of
Manasseh's wild, ominous persistence in his suit, her aunt's
coldness, her own loneliness, were all forgotten, and she could
almost have danced with joy. Nattee laughed aloud, and talked and
chuckled to herself-'Old Indian woman great mystery. Old Indian woman
sent hither and thither; go where she is told, where she hears with
her cars. But old Indian woman'--and here she drew herself up, and
the expression of her face quite changed--'know how to call, and then
white man must come; and old Indian woman have spoken never a word,
and white man have heard nothing with his cars.' So the old crone
muttered.</p>

<p>All this time, things were going on very differently in the
keeping-room to what Lois imagined. Faith sat stiller even than
usual; her eyes downcast, her words few. A quick observer might have
noticed a certain tremulousness about her hands, and an occasional
twitching throughout all her frame. But Pastor Nolan was not a keen
observer upon this occasion; he was absorbed with his own little
wonders and perplexities. His wonder was that of a carnal man--who
that pretty stranger might be, who had seemed, on his first coming,
so glad to see him, but had vanished instantly, apparently not to
reappear. And, indeed, I am not sure if his perplexity was not that
of a carnal man rather than that of a godly minister, for this was
his dilemma. It was the custom of Salem (as we have already seen) for
the minister, on entering a household for the visit which, among
other people and in other times, would have been termed a 'morning
call,' to put up a prayer for the eternal welfare of the family under
whose roof-tree he was. Now this prayer was expected to be adapted to
the individual character, joys, sorrows, wants, and failings of every
member present; and here was he, a young pastor, alone with a young
woman; and he thought--vain thoughts, perhaps, but still very
natural--that the implied guesses at her character, involved in the
minute supplications above described, would be very awkward in a
tete-a-tete prayer; so, whether it was his wonder or his perplexity,
I do not know, but he did not contribute much to the conversation for
some time, and at last, by a sudden burst of courage and impromptu
hit, he cut the Gordian knot by making the usual proposal for prayer
and adding to it a request that the household might be summoned. In
came Lois, quiet and decorous; in came Nattee, all one impassive,
stiff piece of wood--no look of intelligence or trace of giggling
near her countenance. Solemnly recalling each wandering thought,
Pastor Nolan knelt in the midst of these three to pray. He was a good
and truly religious man, whose name here is the only thing disguised,
and played his part bravely in the awful trial to which he was
afterwards subjected; and if, at the time, before he went through his
fiery persecutions, the human fancies which beset all young hearts
came across his, we at this day know that these fancies are no sin.
But now he prays in earnest, prays so heartily for himself, with such
a sense of his own spiritual need and spiritual failings, that each
one of his hearers feels as if a prayer and a supplication had gone
up for each of them. Even Nattee muttered the few words she knew of
the Lord's Prayer; gibberish though the disjointed nouns and verbs
might be, the poor creature said them because she was stirred to
unwonted reverence. As for Lois, she rose up comforted and
strengthened, as no special prayers of Pastor Tappau had ever made
her feel. But Faith was sobbing, sobbing aloud, almost hysterically,
and made no effort to rise, but lay on her outstretched arms spread
out upon the settle. Lois and Pastor Nolan looked at each other for
an instant. Then Lois said--</p>

<p>'Sir, you must go. My cousin has not been strong for some time,
and doubtless she needs more quiet than she has had today.'</p>

<p>Pastor Nolan bowed, and left the house; but in a moment he
returned. Half-opening the door, but without entering, he said--</p>

<p>'I come back to ask, if perchance I may call this evening to
inquire how young Mistress Hickson finds herself?'</p>

<p>But Faith did not hear this; she was sobbing louder than ever.</p>

<p>'Why did you send him away, Lois? I should have been better
directly, and it is so long since I have seen him.'</p>

<p>She had her face hidden as she uttered these words and Lois could
not hear them distinctly. She bent her head down by her cousin's on
the settle, meaning to ask her to repeat what she had said. But in
the irritation of the moment, and prompted possibly by some incipient
jealousy, Faith pushed Lois away so violently that the latter was
hurt against the hard, sharp corner of the wooden settle. Tears came
into her eyes; not so much because her cheek was bruised, as because
of the surprised pain she felt at this repulse from the cousin
towards whom she was feeling so warmly and kindly, just for the
moment, Lois was as angry as any child could have been; but some of
the words of Pastor Nolan's prayer yet rang in her cars, and she
thought it would be a shame if she did not let them sink into her
heart. She dared not, however, stoop again to caress Faith, but stood
quietly by her, sorrowfully waiting; until a step at the outer door
caused Faith to rise quickly, and rush into the kitchen, leaving Lois
to bear the brunt of the new-comer. It was Manasseh, returned from
hunting. He had been two days away, in company with other young men
belonging to Salem. It was almost the only occupation which could
draw him out of his secluded habits. He stopped suddenly at the door
on seeing Lois, and alone; for she had avoided him of late in every
possible way.</p>

<p>'Where is my mother?'</p>

<p>'At a prayer-meeting at Pastor Tappau's. She has taken Prudence.
Faith has left the room this minute. I will call her.' And Lois was
going towards the kitchen, when he placed himself between her and the
door.</p>

<p>'Lois,' said he, 'the rime is going by, and I cannot wait much
longer. The visions come thick upon me, and my sight grows clearer
and clearer. Only this last night, camping out in the woods, I saw in
my soul, between sleeping and waking, the spirit come and offer thee
two lots; and the colour of the one was white, like a bride's, and
the other was black and red, which is, being interpreted, a violent
death. And, when thou didst choose the latter, the spirit said unto
me, "Come!" and I came, and did as I was bidden. I put it on thee
with mine own hands, as it is preordained, if thou wilt not hearken
unto the voice and be my wife. And when the black and red dress fell
to the ground, thou wert even as a corpse three days old. Now, be
advised, Lois, in time! Lois, my cousin, I have seen it in a vision,
and my soul cleaveth unto thee--I would fain spare thee.'</p>

<p>He was really in earnest--in passionate earnest; whatever his
visions, as he called them, might be, he believed in them, and this
belief gave something of unselfishness to his love for Lois. This she
felt at this moment, if she had never done so before; and it seemed
like a contrast to the repulse she had just met with from his sister.
He had drawn near her, and now he took hold of her hand, repeating in
his wild, pathetic, dreamy way--</p>

<p>'And the voice said unto me, "Marry Lois!"' And Lois was more
inclined to soothe and reason with him than she had ever been before,
since the first time of his speaking to her on the subject--when
Grace Hickson and Prudence entered the room from the passage. They
had returned from the prayer-meeting by the back way, which had
prevented the sound of their approach from being heard.</p>

<p>But Manasseh did not stir or look round; he kept his eyes fixed on
Lois, as if to note the effect of his words. Grace came hastily
forwards and, lifting up her strong right arm, smote their joined
hands in twain, in spite of the fervour of Manasseh's grasp.</p>

<p>'What means this?' said she, addressing herself more to Lois than
to her son, anger flashing out of her deep-set eyes.</p>

<p>Lois waited for Manasseh to speak. He seemed, but a few minutes
before, to be more gentle and less threatening than he had been of
late on this subject, and she did not wish to irritate him. But he
did not speak, and her aunt stood angrily waiting for an answer.</p>

<p>'At any rate,' thought Lois, 'it will put an end to the thought in
his mind, when my aunt speaks out about it.'</p>

<p>'My cousin seeks me in marriage,' said Lois.</p>

<p>'Thee!' and Grace struck out in the direction of her niece with a
gesture of supreme contempt. But now Manasseh spoke forth--</p>

<p>'Yea! it is preordained. The voice has said it, and the spirit has
brought her to me as my bride.'</p>

<p>'Spirit! an evil spirit then! A good spirit would have chosen out
for thee a godly maiden of thine own people, and not a prelatist and
a stranger like this girl. A pretty return, Mistress Lois, for all
our kindness!'</p>

<p>'Indeed, Aunt Hickson, I have done all I could--Cousin Manasseh
knows it--to show him I can be none of his. I have told him,' said
she, blushing, but determined to say the whole out at once, 'that I
am all but troth-plight to a young man of our own village at home;
and even putting all that on one side, I wish not for marriage at
present.'</p>

<p>'Wish rather for conversion and regeneration! Marriage is an
unseemly word in the mouth of a maiden. As for Manasseh, I will take
reason with him in private; and, meanwhile, if thou hast spoken
truly, throw not thyself in his path, as I have noticed thou hast
done but too often of late.'</p>

<p>Lois's heart burnt within her at this unjust accusation, for she
knew how much she had dreaded and avoided her cousin, and she almost
looked to him to give evidence that her aunt's last words were not
true. But, instead, he recurred to his one fixed idea, and said--</p>

<p>'Mother, listen! If I wed not Lois, both she and I die within the
year. I care not for life; before this, as you know, I have sought
for death' (Grace shuddered, and was for a moment subdued by some
recollection of past horror); 'but, if Lois were my wife, I should
live, and she would be spared from what is the other lot. That whole
vision grows clearer to me, day by day. Yet, when I try to know
whether I am one of the elect, all is dark. The mystery of Free-Will
and Fore-Knowledge is a mystery of Satan's devising, not of
God's.'</p>

<p>'Alas, my son! Satan is abroad among the brethren even now; but
let the old vexed topics rest! Sooner than fret thyself again, thou
shalt have Lois to be thy wife, though my heart was set far
differently for thee.'</p>

<p>'No, Manasseh,' said Lois. 'I love you well as a cousin, but wife
of yours I can never be. Aunt Hickson, it is not well to delude him
so. I say, if ever I marry man, I am troth-plight to one in
England.'</p>

<p>'Tush, child! I am your guardian in my dead husband's place. Thou
thinkest thyself so great a prize that I could clutch at thee whether
or no, I doubt not. I value thee not, save as a medicine for
Manasseh, if his mind get disturbed again, as I have noted signs of
late.'</p>

<p>This, then, was the secret explanation of much that had alarmed
her in her cousin's manner: and, if Lois had been a physician of
modern times, she might have traced somewhat of the same temperament
in his sisters as well--in Prudence's lack of natural feeling and
impish delight in mischief, in Faith's vehemence of unrequited love.
But, as yet, Lois did not know, any more than Faith, that the
attachment of the latter to Mr Nolan was not merely unreturned, but
even unperceived, by the young minister.</p>

<p>He came, it is true--came often to the house, sat long with the
family, and watched them narrowly, but took no especial notice of
Faith. Lois perceived this, and grieved over it; Nattee perceived it,
and was indignant at it, long before Faith slowly acknowledged it to
herself, and went to Nattee the Indian woman, rather than to Lois her
cousin, for sympathy and counsel.</p>

<p>'He cares not for me,' said Faith. 'He cares more for Lois's
little finger than for my whole body,' the girl moaned out, in the
bitter pain of jealousy.</p>

<p>'Hush thee, hush thee, prairie-bird! How can he build a nest, when
the old bird has got all the moss and the feathers?' Wait till the
Indian has found means to send the old bird flying far away.' This
was the mysterious comfort Nattee gave.</p>

<p>Grace Hickson took some kind of charge over Manasseh that relieved
Lois of much of her distress at his strange behaviour. Yet, at times,
he escaped from his mother's watchfulness, and in such opportunities
he would always seek Lois, entreating her, as of old, to marry
him---sometimes pleading his love for her, oftener speaking wildly of
his visions and the voices which he heard foretelling a terrible
futurity.</p>

<p>We have now to do with events which were taking place in Salem,
beyond the narrow circle of the Hickson family; but, as they only
concern us in as far as they bore down in their consequences on the
future of those who formed part of it, I shall go over the narrative
very briefly. The town of Salem had lost by death, within a very
short time preceding the commencement of my story, nearly all its
venerable men and leading citizens--men of ripe wisdom and sound
counsel. The people had hardly yet recovered from the shock of their
loss, as one by one the patriarchs of the primitive little community
had rapidly followed each other to the grave. They had been loved as
fathers, and looked up to as judges in the land. The first bad effect
of their loss was seen in the heated dissention which sprang up
between Pastor Tappau and the candidate Nolan. It had been apparently
healed over; but Mr Nolan had not been many weeks in Salem, after his
second coming, before the strife broke out afresh, and alienated many
for life who had till then been bound together by the ties of
friendship or relationship. Even in the Hickson family something of
this feeling soon sprang up; Grace being a vehement partisan of the
elder pastor's more gloomy doctrines, while Faith was a passionate,
if a powerless, advocate of Mr Nolan. Manasseh's growing absorption
in his own fancies, and imagined gift of prophecy, making him
comparatively indifferent to all outward events, did not tend to
either the fulfilment of his visions, or the elucidation of the dark
mysterious doctrines over which he had pondered too long for the
health either of his mind or body; while Prudence delighted in
irritating every one by her advocacy of the views of thinking to
which they were most opposed, and relating every gossiping story to
the person most likely to disbelieve, and to be indignant at, what
she told with an assumed unconsciousness of any such effect to be
produced. There was much talk of the congregational difficulties and
dissensions being carried up to the general court; and each party
naturally hoped that, if such were the course of events, the opposing
pastor and that portion of the congregation which adhered to him
might be worsted in the struggle.</p>

<p>Such was the state of things in the township, when, one day
towards the end of the month of February, Grace Hickson returned from
the weekly prayer-meeting, which it was her custom to attend at
Pastor Tappau's house, in a state of extreme excitement. On her
entrance into her own house she sat down, rocking her body backwards
and forwards, and praying to herself. Both Faith and Lois stopped
their spinning, in wonder at her agitation, before either of them
ventured to address her. At length Faith rose, and spoke--</p>

<p>'Mother, what is it? Hath anything happened of any evil
nature?'</p>

<p>The brave, stern old woman's face was blenched, and her eyes were
almost set in horror, as she prayed; the great drops running down her
cheeks.</p>

<p>It seemed almost as if she had to make a struggle to recover her
sense of the present homely accustomed fife, before she could find
words to answer--</p>

<p>'Evil nature! Daughters, Satan is abroad--is close to us; I have
this very hour seen him afflict two innocent children, as of old he
troubled those who were possessed by him in Judea. Hester and Abigail
Tappau have been contorted and convulsed by him and his servants into
such shapes as I am afeared to think on; and when their father, godly
Mr Tappau, began to exhort and to pray, their howlings were like the
wild beasts of the field. Satan is of a truth let loose among us. The
girls kept calling upon him, as if he were even then present among
us. Abigail screeched out that he stood at my very back in the guise
of a black man; and truly, as I turned round at her words, I saw a
creature like a shadow vanishing, and turned all of a cold sweat. Who
knows where he is now? Faith, lay straws across the door-sill!'</p>

<p>'But, if he be already entered in,' asked Prudence,' may not that
make it difficult for him to depart?'</p>

<p>Her mother, taking no notice of her question, went on rocking
herself, and praying, till again she broke out into narration--</p>

<p>'Reverend Mr Tappau says, that only last night he heard a sound as
of a heavy body dragged all through his house by some strong power;
once it was thrown against his bedroom door, and would, doubtless,
have broken it in, if he had not prayed fervently and aloud at that
very time; and a shriek went up at his prayer that made his hair
stand on end; and this morning all the crockery in the house was
found broken and piled up in the middle of the kitchen floor, and
Pastor Tappau says that, as soon as he began to ask a blessing on the
morning's meal, Abigail and Hester cried out, as if some one was
pinching them. Lord, have mercy upon us all! Satan is of a truth let
loose.'</p>

<p>'They sound like the old stories I used to hear in Barford,' said
Lois, breathless with affright.</p>

<p>Faith seemed less alarmed; but then her dislike to Pastor Tappau
was so great, that she could hardly sympathise with any misfortunes
that befell him or his family.</p>

<p>Towards evening Mr Nolan came in. In general, so high did party
spirit run, Grace Hickson only tolerated his visits, finding herself
often engaged at such hours, and being too much abstracted in thought
to show him the ready hospitality which was one of her most prominent
virtues. But today, both as bringing the latest intelligence of the
new horrors sprung up in Salem, and as being one of the Church
militant (or what the Puritans considered as equivalent to the Church
militant) against Satan, he was welcomed by her in an unusual
manner.</p>

<p>He seemed oppressed with the occurrences of the day; at first it
appeared to be almost a relief to him to sit still, and cogitate upon
them, and his hosts were becoming almost impatient for him to say
something more than mere monosyllables, when he began--</p>

<p>'Such a day as this I pray that I may never see again. It is as if
the devils, whom our Lord banished into the herd of swine, had been
permitted to come again upon the earth. And I would it were only the
lost spirits who were tormenting us; but I much fear that certain of
those whom we have esteemed as God's people have sold their souls to
Satan, for the sake of a little of his evil power, whereby they may
afflict others for a time. Elder Sherringham bath lost this very day
a good and valuable horse, wherewith he used to drive his family to
meeting.'</p>

<p>'Perchance,' said Lois, 'the horse died of some natural
disease.'</p>

<p>'True,' said Pastor Nolan; 'but I was going on to say, that, as he
entered into his house, full of dolour at the loss of his beast, a
mouse ran in before him so sudden that it almost tripped him up,
though an instant before there was no such thing to be seen; and he
caught it with his shoe and hit it, and it cried out like a human
creature in pain, and straight ran up the chimney, caring nothing for
the hot flame and smoke.'</p>

<p>Manasseh listened greedily to all this story; and, when it was
ended he smote his breast, and prayed aloud for deliverance from the
power of the Evil One; and he continually went on praying at
intervals through the evening, with every mark of abject terror on
his face and in his manner--he, the bravest, most daring hunter in
all the settlement. Indeed, all the family huddled together in silent
fear, scarcely finding any interest in the usual household
occupations. Faith and Lois sat with arms entwined, as in days before
the former had become jealous of the latter; Prudence asked low,
fearful questions of her mother and of the pastor as to the creatures
that were abroad, and the ways in which they afflicted others; and,
when Grace besought the minister to pray for her and her household,
he made a long and passionate supplication that none of that little
flock might ever so far fall away into hopeless perdition as to be
guilty of the sin without forgiveness--the Sin of Witchcraft.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<p>'The Sin of Witchcraft.' We read about it, we look on it from the
outside; but we can hardly realise the terror it induced. Every
impulsive or unaccustomed action, every little nervous affection,
every ache or pain was noticed, not merely by those around the
sufferer, but by the person himself, whoever he might be, that was
acting, or being acted upon, in any but the most simple and ordinary
manner. He or she (for it was most frequently a woman or girl that
was the supposed subject) felt a desire for some unusual kind of
food--some unusual motion or rest--her hand twitched, her foot was
asleep, or her leg had the cramp; and the dreadful question
immediately suggested itself, 'Is any one possessing an evil power
over me; by the help of Satan?' and perhaps they went on to think,
'It is bad enough to feel that my holy can he made to suffer through
the power of some unknown evil-wisher to me; but what if Satan gives
them still further power, and they can touch my soul, and inspire me
with loathful thoughts leading me into crimes which at present I
abhor?' and so on, till the very dread of what might happen, and the
constant dwelling of the thoughts, even with horror, upon certain
possibilities, or what were esteemed such, really brought about the
corruption of imagination at last, which at first they had shuddered
at. Moreover, there was a sort of uncertainty as to who might be
infected--not unlike the overpowering dread of the plague, which made
some shrink from their best-beloved with irrepressible fear. The
brother or sister, who was the dearest friend of their childhood and
youth, might now be bound in some mysterious deadly pack with evil
spirits of the most horrible kind--who could tell? And in such a case
it became a duty, a sacred duty, to give up the earthly body which
bad been once so loved, but which was now the habitation of a soul
corrupt and horrible in its evil inclinations. Possibly, terror of
death might bring on confession, and repentance, and purification. Or
if it did not, why, away with the evil creature, the witch, out of
the world, down to the kingdom of the master, whose bidding was done
on earth in all manner of corruption and torture of God's creatures!
There were others who, to these more simple, if more ignorant,
feelings of horror at witches and witchcraft, added the desire,
conscious or unconscious, of revenge on those whose conduct had been
in any way displeasing to them. Where evidence takes a supernatural
character, there is no disproving it. This argument comes up: 'You
have only the natural powers; I have supernatural. You admit the
existence of the supernatural by the condemnation of this very crime
of witchcraft. You hardly know the limits of the natural powers; how,
then, can you define the supernatural? I say that in the dead of
night, when my body seemed to all present to be lying in quiet sleep,
I was, in the most complete and wakeful consciousness, present in my
body at an assembly of witches and wizards, with Satan at their head;
that I was by them tortured in my body, because my soul would not
acknowledge him as its king; and that I witnessed such and such
deeds. What the nature of the appearance was that took the semblance
of myself, sleeping quietly in my bed, I know not; but, admitting, as
you do, the possibility of witchcraft, you cannot disprove my
evidence.' The evidence might be given truly or falsely, as the
person witnessing believed it or not; but every one must see what
immense and terrible power was abroad for revenge. Then, again, the
accused themselves ministered to the horrible panic abroad. Some, in
dread of death, confessed from cowardice to the imaginary crimes of
which they were accused, and of which they were promised a pardon on
confession. Some, weak and terrified, came honestly to believe in
their own guilt, through the diseases of imagination which were sure
to be engendered at such a time as this.</p>

<p>Lois sat spinning with Faith. Both were silent, pondering over the
stories that were abroad. Lois spoke first.</p>

<p>'Oh, Faith! this country is worse than ever England was, even in
the days of Master Matthew Hopkinson, the witch-finder. I grow
frightened of every one, I think. I even get afeared sometimes of
Nattee!'</p>

<p>Faith coloured a little. Then she asked--</p>

<p>'Why? What should make you distrust the Indian woman?'</p>

<p>'Oh! I am ashamed of my fear as soon as it arises in my mind. But,
you know, her look and colour were strange to me when I first came;
and she is not a christened woman; and they tell stories of Indian
wizards; and I know not what the mixtures are which she is sometimes
stirring over the fire, nor the meaning of the strange chants she
sings to herself. And once I met her in the dusk, just close by
Pastor Tappau's house, in company with Hota, his servant--it was just
before we heard of the sore disturbance in his house--and I have
wondered if she had aught to do with it.'</p>

<p>Faith sat very still, as if thinking. At last she said--</p>

<p>'If Nattee has powers beyond what you and I have, she will not use
them for evil; at least not evil to those whom she loves.'</p>

<p>'That comforts me but little,' said Lois. 'If she has powers
beyond what she ought to have, I dread her, though I have done her no
evil; nay, though I could almost say she bore me a kindly feeling.
But such powers are only given by the Evil One; and the proof thereof
is, that, as you imply, Nattee would use them on those who offend
her.'</p>

<p>'And why should she not?' asked Faith, lifting her eyes, and
flashing heavy fire out of them, at the question.</p>

<p>'Because,' said Lois, not seeing Faith's glance, 'we are told to
pray for them that despitefully use us, and to do good to them that
persecute us. But poor Nattee is not a christened woman. I would that
Mr Nolan would baptize her: it would, maybe, take her out of the
power of Satan's temptations.'</p>

<p>'Are you never tempted?' asked Faith half-scornfully; 'and yet I
doubt not you were well baptized!'</p>

<p>'True,' said Lois sadly; 'I often do very wrong; but, perhaps, I
might have done worse, if the holy form had not been observed.'</p>

<p>They were again silent for a time.</p>

<p>'Lois,' said Faith, 'I did not mean any offence'. But do you never
feel as if you would give up all that future life, of which the
parsons talk, and which seems so vague and so distant, for a few
years of real, vivid blessedness, to begin tomorrow--this hour--this
minute? Oh! I could think of happiness for which I would willingly
give up all those misty chances of heaven'--</p>

<p>'Faith, Faith!' cried Lois in terror, holding her hand before her
cousin's mouth, and looking around in fright. 'Hush! you know not who
may be listening; you are putting yourself in his power.'</p>

<p>But Faith pushed her hand away, and said, 'Lois, I believe in him
no more than I believe in heaven. Both may exist; but they are so far
away that I defy them. Why all this ado about Mr Tappau's
house---promise me never to tell living creature, and I will tell you
a secret.'</p>

<p>'No!' said Lois, terrified. 'I dread all secrets. I will hear
none. I will do all that I can for you, Cousin Faith, in any way; but
just at this time, I strive to keep my life and thoughts within the
strictest bounds of godly simplicity, and I dread pledging myself to
aught that is hidden and secret.</p>

<p>'As you will, cowardly girl, full of terrors, which, if you had
listened to me, might have been lessened, if not entirely done away
with.' And Faith would not utter another word, though Lois tried
meekly to entice her into conversation on some other subject.</p>

<p>The rumour of witchcraft was like the echo of thunder among the
hills. It had broken out in Mr Tappau's house, and his two little
daughters were the first supposed to be bewitched; but round about,
from every quarter of the town, came in accounts of sufferers by
witchcraft. There was hardly a family without one of these supposed
victims. Then arose a growl and menaces of vengeance from many a
household--menaces deepened, not daunted, by the terror and mystery
of the suffering that gave rise to them.</p>

<p>At length a day was appointed when, after solemn fasting and
prayer, Mr Tappau invited the neighbouring ministers and all godly
people to assemble at his house, and unite with him in devoting a day
to solemn religious services, and to supplication for the deliverance
of his children, and those similarly afflicted, from the power of the
Evil One. All Salem poured out towards the house of the minister.
There was a look of excitement on all their faces; eagerness and
horror were depicted on many, while stern resolution, amounting to
determined cruelty, if the occasion arose, was seen on others.</p>

<p>In the midst of the prayer, Hester Tappau, the younger girl, fell
into convulsions; fit after fit came on, and her screams mingled with
the shrieks and cries of the assembled congregation. In the first
pause, when the child was partially recovered, when the people stood
around, exhausted and breathless, her father, the Pastor Tappau,
lifted his right hand, and adjured her, in the name of the Trinity,
to say who tormented her. There was a dead silence; not a creature
stirred of all those hundreds. Hester turned wearily and uneasily,
and moaned out the name of Hota, her father's Indian servant. Hota
was present, apparently as much interested as any one; indeed, she
had been busying herself much in bringing remedies to the suffering
child. But now she stood aghast, transfixed, while her name was
caught up and shouted out in tones of reprobation and hatred by all
the crowd around her. Another moment, and they would have fallen upon
the trembling creature and torn her limb from limb--pale, dusky,
shivering Hota, half guilty-looking from her very bewilderment. But
Pastor Tappau, that gaunt, grey man, lifting himself to his utmost
height, signed to them to go back, to keep still while he addressed
them; and then he told them that instant vengeance was not just,
deliberate punishment; that there would be need of conviction,
perchance of confession; he hoped for some redress for his suffering
children from her revelations, if she were brought to confession.
They must leave the culprit in his hands, and in those of his brother
ministers, that they might wrestle with Satan before delivering her
up to the civil power. He spoke well; for he spoke from the heart of
a father seeing his children exposed to dreadful and mysterious
suffering, and firmly believing that he now held the clue in his hand
which should ultimately release them and their fellow-sufferers. And
the congregation moaned themselves into unsatisfied submission, and
listened to his long, passionate prayer, which he uplifted even while
the hapless Hota stood there, guarded and bound by two men, who
glared at her like blood-hounds ready to slip, even while the prayer
ended in the words of the merciful Saviour.</p>

<p>Lois sickened and shuddered at the whole scene; and this was no
intellectual shuddering at the folly and superstition of the people,
but tender moral shuddering at the sight of guilt which she believed
in, and at the evidence of men's hatred and abhorrence, which, when
shown even to the guilty, troubled and distressed her merciful heart.
She followed her aunt and cousins out into the open air, with
downcast eyes and pale face. Grace Hickson was going home with a
feeling of triumphant relief at the detection of the guilty one.
Faith alone seemed uneasy and disturbed beyond her wont; for Manasseh
received the whole transaction as the fulfilment of a prophecy, and
Prudence was excited by the novel scene into a state of discordant
high spirits.</p>

<p>'I am quite as old as Hester Tappau,' she said; 'her birthday is
in September and mine in October.'</p>

<p>'What has that to do with it?' said Faith sharply.</p>

<p>'Nothing; only she seemed such a little thing for all those grave
ministers to be praying for, and so many folk come from a distance;
some from Boston, they said, all for her sake, as it were. Why, didst
thou see, it was godly Mr Henwick that held her head when she
wriggled so, and old Madam Holbrook had herself helped up on a chair
to see the better? I wonder how long I might wriggle, before great
and godly folk would take so much notice of me? But, I suppose, that
comes of being a pastor's daughter. She'll be so set up, there'll be
no speaking to her now. Faith! thinkest thou that Hota really had
bewitched her? She gave me corn-cakes the last time I was at Pastor
Tappau's, just like any other woman, only, perchance, a trifle more
good-natured; and to think of her being a witch after all!'</p>

<p>But Faith seemed in a hurry to reach home, and paid no attention
to Prudence's talking. Lois hastened on with Faith; for Manasseh was
walking alongside of his mother, and she kept steady to her plan of
avoiding him, even though she pressed her company upon Faith, who had
seemed of late desirous of avoiding her.</p>

<p>That evening the news spread through Salem, that Hota had
confessed her sin--had acknowledged that she was a witch. Nattee was
the first to hear the intelligence. She broke into the room where the
girls were sitting with Grace Hickson, solemnly doing nothing,
because of the great prayer-meeting in the morning, and cried out,
'Mercy, mercy, mistress, everybody! take care of poor Indian Nattee,
who never do wrong, but for mistress and the family! Hota one bad,
wicked witch; she say so herself; oh, me! oh, me!' and, stooping over
Faith, she said something in a low, miserable tone of voice, of which
Lois only heard the word 'torture.' But Faith heard all, and, turning
very pale, half-accompanied, half-led Nattee back to her kitchen.</p>

<p>Presently, Grace Hickson came in. She had been out to see a
neighbour: it will not do to say that so godly a woman had been
gossiping; and, indeed, the subject of the conversation she had held
was of too serious and momentous a nature for me to employ a light
word to designate it. There was all the listening to, and repeating
of, small details and rumours, in which the speakers have no concern,
that constitutes gossiping; but, in this instance, all trivial facts
and speeches might be considered to bear such dreadful significance,
and might have so ghastly an ending, that such whispers were
occasionally raised to a tragic importance. Every fragment of
intelligence that related to Mr Tappau's household was eagerly
snatched at: how his dog howled all one long night through, and could
not be stilled; how his cow suddenly failed in her milk, only two
months after she had calved; how his memory had forsaken him one
morning for a minute or two, in repeating the Lord's Prayer, and he
had even omitted a clause thereof in his sudden perturbation; and how
all these forerunners of his children's strange illness might now be
interpreted and understood---this had formed the staple of the
conversation between Grace Hickson and her friends. There had arisen
a dispute among them at last, as to how far these subsections to the
power of the Evil One were to be considered as a judgment upon Pastor
Tappau for some sin on his part; and if so, what? It was not an
unpleasant discussion, although there was considerable difference of
opinion; for, as none of the speakers had had their families so
troubled, it was rather a proof that they had none of them committed
any sin. In the midst of this talk, one, entering in from the street,
brought the news that Hota had confessed all--had owned to signing a
certain little red book which Satan had presented to her--had been
present at impious sacraments--had ridden through the air to Newbury
Falls--and, in fact, had assented to all the questions which the
elders and magistrates, carefully reading over the confessions of the
witches who had formerly been tried in England, in order that they
might not omit a single inquiry, had asked of her. More she had owned
to, but things of inferior importance, and partaking more of the
nature of earthly tricks than of spiritual power. She had spoken of
carefully-adjusted strings, by which all the crockery in Pastor
Tappau's house could be pulled down or disturbed; but of such
intelligible malpractices the gossips of Salem took little heed. One
of them said that such an action showed Satan's prompting; but they
all preferred to listen to the grander guilt of the blasphemous
sacraments and supernatural rides. The narrator ended with saying
that Hota was to be hung the next morning, in spite of her
confession, even although her life had been promised to her if she
acknowledged her sin; for it was well to make an example of the
first-discovered witch, and it was also well that she was an Indian,
a heathen, whose life would be no great loss to the community. Grace
Hickson on this spoke out. It was well that witches should perish off
the face of the earth, Indian or English, heathen or, worse, a
baptized Christian who had betrayed the Lord, even as Judas did, and
had gone over to Satan. For her part, she wished that the
first-discovered witch had been a member of a godly English
household, that it might be seen of all men that religious folk were
willing to cut off the right hand, and pluck out the right eye, if
tainted with the devilish sin. She spoke sternly and well. The last
corner said that her words might be brought to proof, for it had been
whispered that Hota had named others, and some from the most
religious families of Salem, whom she had seen among the unholy
communicants at the sacraments of the Evil One. And Grace replied
that she would answer for it, all godly folk would stand the proof,
and quench all natural affection rather than that such a sin should
grow and spread among them. She herself had a weak bodily dread of
witnessing the violent death even of an animal; but she would not let
that deter her from standing amidst those who cast the accursed
creature out from among them on the morrow morning.</p>

<p>Contrary to her wont, Grace Hickson told her family much of this
conversation. It was a sign of her excitement on the subject that she
thus spoke, and the excitement spread in different forms through her
family. Faith was flushed and restless, wandering between the
keeping-room and the kitchen, and questioning her mother particularly
as to the more extraordinary parts of Hota's confession, as if she
wished to satisfy herself that the Indian witch had really done those
horrible and mysterious deeds.</p>

<p>Lois shivered and trembled with affright at the narration, and at
the idea that such things were possible. Occasionally she found
herself wandering off into sympathetic thought for the woman who was
to die, abhorred of all men, and unpardoned by God, to whom she had
been so fearful a traitor, and who was now, at this very time--when
Lois sat among her kindred by the warm and cheerful firelight,
anticipating many peaceful, perchance happy, morrows--solitary,
shivering, panic-stricken, guilty, with none to stand by her and
exhort her, shut up in darkness between the cold walls of the town
prison. But Lois almost shrank from sympathising with so loathsome an
accomplice of Satan, and prayed for forgiveness for her charitable
thought; and yet, again, she remembered the tender spirit of the
Saviour, and allowed herself to fall into pity, till at last her
sense of right and wrong became so bewildered that she could only
leave all to God's disposal, and just ask that he would take all
creatures and all events into His hands.</p>

<p>Prudence was as bright as if she were listening to some merry
story--curious as to more than her mother would tell her--seeming to
have no particular terror of witches or witchcraft, and yet to be
especially desirous to accompany her mother the next morning to the
hanging. Lois shrank from the cruel, eager face of the young girl, as
she begged her mother to allow her to go. Even Grace was disturbed
and perplexed by her daughter's pertinacity.</p>

<p>'No,' she said. 'Ask me no more! Thou shalt not go. Such sights
are not for the young. I go, and I sicken at the thoughts of it. But
I go to show that I, a Christian woman, take God's part against the
devil's. Thou shalt not go, I tell thee. I could whip thee for
thinking of it.'</p>

<p>'Manasseh says Hota was well whipped by Pastor Tappau ere she was
brought to confession,' said Prudence, as if anxious to change the
subject of discussion.</p>

<p>Manasseh lifted up his head from the great folio Bible, brought by
his father from England, which he was studying. He had not heard what
Prudence said, but he looked up at the sound of his name. All present
were startled at his wild eyes, his bloodless face. But he was
evidently annoyed at the expression of their countenances.</p>

<p>'Why look ye at me in that manner?' asked he. And his manner was
anxious and agitated. His mother made haste to speak--</p>

<p>'It was but that Prudence said something that thou hast told
her---that Pastor Tappau defiled his hands by whipping the witch
Hota. What evil thought has got hold of thee? Talk to us, and crack
not thy skull against the learning of man.'</p>

<p>'It is not the learning of man that I study; it is the Word of
God. I would fain know more of the nature of this sin of witchcraft,
and whether it be, indeed, the unpardonable sin against the Holy
Ghost. At times I feel a creeping influence coming over me, prompting
all evil thoughts and unheard-of deeds, and I question within myself,
"Is not this the power of witchcraft?" and I sicken, and loathe all
that I do or say; and yet some evil creature hath the mastery over
me, and I must needs do and say what I loathe and dread. Why wonder
you,' mother, that I, of all men, strive to learn the exact nature of
witchcraft, and for that end study the Word of God? Have you not seen
me when I was, as it were, possessed with a devil?'</p>

<p>He spoke calmly, sadly, but as under deep conviction. His mother
rose to comfort him.</p>

<p>'My son,' she said, 'no one ever saw thee do deeds, or heard thee
utter words, which any one could say were prompted by devils. We have
seen thee, poor lad, with thy wits gone astray for a time; but all
thy thoughts sought rather God's will in forbidden places, than lost
the clue to them for one moment in hankering after the powers of
darkness. Those days are long past; a future lies before thee. Think
not of witches, or of being subject to the power of witchcraft. I did
evil to speak of it before thee. Let Lois come and sit by thee, and
talk to thee.'</p>

<p>Lois went to her cousin, grieved at heart for his depressed state
of mind, anxious to soothe and comfort him, and yet recoiling more
than ever from the idea of ultimately becoming his wife--an idea to
which she saw her aunt reconciling herself unconsciously day by day,
as she perceived the English girl's power of soothing and comforting
her cousin, even by the very tones of her sweet cooing voice.</p>

<p>He took Lois's hand.</p>

<p>'Let me hold it! It does me good,' said he. 'Ah, Lois, when I am
by you, I forget all my troubles--will the day never come when you
will listen to the voice that speaks to me continually?'</p>

<p>'I never hear it, Cousin Manasseh,' she said softly; 'but do not
think of the voices. Tell me of the land you hope to enclose from the
forest--what manner of trees grow on it?' Thus, by simple questions
on practical affairs, she led him back, in her unconscious wisdom, to
the subjects on which he had always shown strong practical sense. He
talked on these, with all due discretion, till the hour for family
prayer came round, which was early in those days. It was Manasseh's
place to conduct it, as head of the family; a post which his mother
had always been anxious to assign to him since her husband's death.
He prayed extempore, and tonight his supplications wandered off into
wild, unconnected fragments of prayer, which all those kneeling
around began, each according to her anxiety for the speaker, to think
would never end. Minutes elapsed, and grew to quarters of an hour,
and his words only became more emphatic and wilder, praying for
himself alone, and laying bare the recesses of his heart. At length
his mother rose, and took Lois by the hand; for she had faith in
Lois's power over her son, as being akin to that which the shepherd
David, playing on his harp, had over king Saul sitting on his throne.
She drew her towards him, where he knelt facing into the circle, with
his eyes upturned, and the tranced agony of his face depicting the
struggle of the troubled soul within.</p>

<p>'Here is Lois,' said Grace, almost tenderly; she would fain go to
her chamber.' (Down the girl's face the tears were streaming.) 'Rise,
and finish thy prayer in thy closet.'</p>

<p>But at Lois's approach he sprang to his feet--sprang aside.</p>

<p>'Take her away, mother! Lead me not into temptation! She brings me
evil and sinful thoughts. She overshadows me, even in the presence of
God. She is no angel of light, or she would not do this. She troubles
me with the sound of a voice bidding me marry her, even when I am at
my prayers. Avaunt! Take her away!'</p>

<p>He would have struck at Lois, if she had not shrunk back, dismayed
and affrighted. His mother, although equally dismayed, was not
affrighted. She had seen him thus before, and understood the
management of his paroxysm.</p>

<p>'Go, Lois! the sight of thee irritates him, as once that of Faith
did. Leave him to me!'</p>

<p>And Lois rushed away to her room, and threw herself on her bed,
like a panting, hunted creature. Faith came after her slowly and
heavily.</p>

<p>'Lois,' said she, 'wilt thou do me a favour? It is not much to
ask. Wilt thou arise before daylight, and bear this letter from me to
Pastor Nolan's lodgings? I would have done it myself, but mother has
bidden me to come to her, and I may be detained until the time when
Hota is to be hung; and the letter tells of matters pertaining to
life and death. Seek out Pastor Nolan, wherever he may be, and have
speech of him after he has read the letter.'</p>

<p>'Cannot Nattee take it?' asked Lois.</p>

<p>'No!' Faith answered fiercely. 'Why should she?'</p>

<p>But Lois did not reply. A quick suspicion darted through Faith's
mind, sudden as lightning. It had never entered there before.</p>

<p>'Speak, Lois! I read thy thoughts. Thou would'st fain not be the
bearer of this letter?'</p>

<p>'I will take it,' said Lois meekly. 'It concerns life and death,
you say?'</p>

<p>'Yes!' said Faith, in quite a different tone of voice. But, after
a pause of thought, she added: 'Then, as soon as the house is still,
I will write what I have to say, and leave it here on this chest; and
thou wilt promise me to take it before the day is fully up, while
there is yet time for action.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I promise,' said Lois. And Faith knew enough of her to feel
sure that the deed would be done, however reluctantly.</p>

<p>The letter was written--laid on the chest; and, ere day dawned,
Lois was astir, Faith watching her from between her half-closed
eyelids--eyelids that had never been fully closed in sleep the
livelong night. The instant Lois, cloaked and hooded, left the room,
Faith sprang up, and prepared to go to her mother, whom she heard
already stirring. Nearly every one in Salem was awake and up on this
awful morning, though few were out of doors, as Lois passed along the
streets. Here was the hastily-erected gallows, the black shadow of
which fell across the street with ghastly significance; now she had
to pass the iron-barred gaol, through the unglazed windows of which
she heard the fearful cry of a woman, and the sound of many
footsteps. On she sped, sick almost to faintness, to the widow
woman's where Mr Nolan lodged. He was already up and abroad, gone,
his hostess believed, to the gaol. Thither Lois, repeating the words
'for life and for death!' was forced to go. Retracing her steps, she
was thankful to see him come out of those dismal portals, rendered
more dismal for being in heavy shadow, just as she approached. What
his errand had been she knew not; but he looked grave and sad, as she
put Faith's letter into his hands, and stood before him quietly
waiting until he should read it, and deliver the expected answer.
But, instead of opening it, he hid it in his hand, apparently
absorbed in thought. At last he spoke aloud, but more to himself than
to her--</p>

<p>'My God! and is she, then, to die in this fearful delirium? It
must be--can be--only delirium, that prompts such wild and horrible
confessions. Mistress Barclay, I come from the presence of the Indian
woman appointed to die. It seems, she considered herself betrayed
last evening by her sentence not being respited, even after she had
made confession of sin enough to bring down fire from heaven; and, it
seems to me, the passionate, impotent anger of this helpless creature
has turned to madness, for she appals me by the additional
revelations she has made to the keepers during the night--to me this
morning. I could almost fancy that she thinks, by deepening the guilt
she confesses, to escape this last dread punishment of all; as if,
were a tithe of what she says true, one could suffer such a sinner to
live! Yet to send her to death in such a state of mad terror! What is
to be done?'</p>

<p>'Yet Scripture says that we are not to suffer witches in the
land,' said Lois slowly.</p>

<p>'True; I would but ask for a respite, till the prayers of God's
people had gone up for His mercy. Some would pray for her, poor
wretch as she is. You would, Mistress Barclay, I am sure?' But he
said it in a questioning tone.</p>

<p>'I have been praying for her in the night many a time,' said Lois,
in a low voice. 'I pray for her in my heart at this moment; I suppose
they are bidden to put her out of the land, but I would not have her
entirely God-forsaken. But, sir, you have not read my cousin's
letter. And she bade me bring back an answer with much urgency.'</p>

<p>Still he delayed. He was thinking of the dreadful confession he
came from hearing. If it were true, the beautiful earth was a
polluted place, and he almost wished to die, to escape from such
pollution, into the white innocence of those who stood in the
presence of God.</p>

<p>Suddenly his eyes fell on Lois's pure, grave face, upturned and
watching his. Faith in earthly goodness came over his soul in that
instant, 'and he blessed her unaware.'</p>

<p>He put his hand on her shoulder, with an action half
paternal---although the difference in their ages was not above a
dozen years---and, bending a little towards her, whispered, half to
himself, 'Mistress Barclay, you have done me good.'</p>

<p>'I!' said Lois, half-affrighted; 'I done you good! How?'</p>

<p>'By being what you are. But, perhaps, I should rather thank God,
who sent you at the very moment when my soul was so disquieted.'</p>

<p>At this instant, they were aware of Faith standing in front of
them, with a countenance of thunder. Her angry look made Lois feel
guilty. She had not enough urged the pastor to read his letter, she
thought; and it was indignation at this delay in what she had been
commissioned to do with the urgency of life or death, that made her
cousin lower at her so from beneath her straight black brows. Lois
explained how she had not found Mr Nolan at his lodgings, and had bad
to follow him to the door of the gaol. But Faith replied, with
obdurate contempt--</p>

<p>'Spare thy breath, Cousin Lois! It is easy seeing on what pleasant
matters thou and the Pastor Nolan were talking. I marvel not at thy
forgetfulness. My mind is changed. Give me back my letter, sir; it
was about a poor matter--an old woman's life. And what is that
compared to a young girl's love?'</p>

<p>Lois heard but for an instant; did not understand that her cousin,
in her jealous anger, could suspect the existence of such a feeling
as love between her and Mr Nolan. No imagination as to its
possibility had ever entered her mind; she had respected him, almost
revered him--nay, had liked him as the probable husband of Faith. At
the thought that her cousin could believe her guilty of such
treachery, her grave eyes dilated, and fixed themselves on the
flaming countenance of Faith. That serious, unprotesting manner of
perfect innocence must have told on her accuser, had it not been
that, at the same instant, the latter caught sight of the crimsoned
and disturbed countenance of the pastor, who felt the veil rent off
the unconscious secret of his heart. Faith snatched her letter out of
his hands, and said--</p>

<p>'Let the witch hang! What care I? She has done harm enough with
her charms and her sorcery on Pastor Tappau's girls. Let her die, and
let all other witches look to themselves; for there be many kinds of
witchcraft abroad. Cousin Lois, thou wilt like best to stop with
Pastor Nolan, or I would pray thee to come back with me to
breakfast.'</p>

<p>Lois was not to be daunted by jealous sarcasm. She held out her
hand to Pastor Nolan, determined to take no heed of her cousin's mad
words, but to bid him farewell in her accustomed manner. He hesitated
before taking it; and, when he did, it was with a convulsive squeeze
that almost made her start. Faith waited and watched all, with set
lips and vengeful eyes. She bade no farewell; she spake no word; but,
grasping Lois tightly by the back of the arm, she almost drove her
before her down the street till they reached their home.</p>

<p>The arrangement for the morning was this: Grace Hickson and her
son Manasseh were to be present at the hanging of the first witch
executed in Salem, as pious and godly heads of a family. All the
other members were strictly forbidden to stir out, until such time as
the low-tolling bell announced that all was over in this world for
Hota, the Indian witch. When the execution was ended, there was to be
a solemn prayer-meeting of all the inhabitants of Salem; ministers
had come from a distance to aid by the efficacy of their prayers in
these efforts to purge the land of the devil and his servants. There
was reason to think that the great old meeting-house would be
crowded; and, when Faith and Lois reached home, Grace Hickson was
giving her directions to Prudence, urging her to be ready for an
early start to that place. The stern old woman was troubled in her
mind at the anticipation of the sight she was to see, before many
minutes were over, and spoke in a more hurried and incoherent manner
than was her wont. She was dressed in her Sunday best; but her face
was very grey and colourless, and she seemed afraid to cease speaking
about household affairs, for fear she should have time to think.
Manasseh stood by her, perfectly, rigidly still; he also was in his
Sunday clothes. His face, too, was paler than its wont; but it wore a
kind of absent, rapt expression, almost like that of a man who sees a
vision. As Faith entered, still holding Lois in her fierce grasp,
Manasseh started and smiled, but still dreamily. His manner was so
peculiar that even his mother stayed her talking to observe him more
closely; he was in that state of excitement which usually ended in
what his mother and certain of her friends esteemed a prophetic
revelation. He began to speak, at first very low, and then his voice
increased in power.</p>

<p>'How beautiful is the land of Beulah, far over the sea, beyond the
mountains! Thither the angels carry her, lying back in their arms
like one fainting. They shall kiss away the black circle of death,
and lay her down at the feet of the Lamb. I hear her pleading there
for those on earth who consented to her death. O Lois! pray also for
me, pray for me, miserable!'</p>

<p>When he uttered his cousin's name all their eyes turned towards
her. It was to her that his vision related! She stood among them,
amazed, awe-stricken, but not like one affrighted or dismayed. She
was the first to speak--</p>

<p>'Dear friends, do not think of me; his words may or may not be
true. I am in God's hands all the same, whether he have the gift of
prophecy or not. Besides, hear you not that I end where all would
fain end? Think of him, and of his needs! Such times as these always
leave him exhausted and weary, and he comes out of them.'</p>

<p>And she busied herself in cares for his refreshment, aiding her
aunt's trembling hands to set before him the requisite food, as he
now sat tired and bewildered, gathering together with difficulty his
scattered senses.</p>

<p>Prudence did all she could to assist and speed their departure.
But Faith stood apart, watching in silence with her passionate, angry
eyes.</p>

<p>As soon as they had set out on their solemn, fatal errand, Faith
left the room. She had not tasted food or touched drink. Indeed, they
all felt sick at heart. The moment her sister had gone upstairs,
Prudence sprang to the settle on which Lois had thrown down her cloak
and hood--</p>

<p>'Lend me your muffles and mantle, Cousin Lois. I never yet saw a
woman hanged, and I see not why I should not go. I will stand on the
edge of the crowd; no one will know me, and I will be home long
before my mother.'</p>

<p>'No!' said Lois, 'that may not be. My aunt would be sore
displeased. I wonder at you, Prudence, seeking to witness such a
sight.' And as she spoke she held fast her cloak, which Prudence
vehemently struggled for.</p>

<p>Faith returned, brought back possibly by the sound of the
struggle. She smiled--a deadly smile.</p>

<p>'Give it up, Prudence. Strive no more with her. She has bought
success in this world, and we are but her slaves.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Faith' said Lois, relinquishing her hold of the cloak, and
turning round with passionate reproach in her look and voice, 'what
have I done that you should speak so of me: you, that I have loved as
I think one loves a sister?'</p>

<p>Prudence did not lose her opportunity, but hastily arrayed herself
in the mantle, which was too large for her, and which she had,
therefore, considered as well adapted for concealment; but, as she
went towards the door, her feet became entangled in the unusual
length, and she fell, bruising her arm pretty sharply.</p>

<p>'Take care, another time, how you meddle with a witch's things,'
said Faith, as one scarcely believing her own words, but at enmity
with all the world in her bitter jealousy of heart. Prudence rubbed
her arm, and looked stealthily at Lois.</p>

<p>'Witch Lois! Witch Lois!' said she at last, softly, pulling a
childish face of spite at her.</p>

<p>'Oh, hush, Prudence! Do not bandy such terrible words! Let me look
at thine arm! I am sorry for thy hurt; only glad that it has kept
thee from disobeying thy mother.'</p>

<p>'Away, away!' said Prudence, springing from her. 'I am afeared of
her in very truth, Faith. Keep between me and the witch, or I will
throw a stool at her.'</p>

<p>Faith smiled--it was a bad and wicked smile--but she did not stir
to calm the fears she had called up in her young sister, just at this
moment, the bell began to toll. Hota, the Indian witch, was dead.
Lois covered her face with her hands. Even Faith went a deadlier pale
than she had been, and said, sighing, 'Poor Hota! But death is
best.'</p>

<p>Prudence alone seemed unmoved by any thoughts connected with the
solemn, monotonous sound. Her only consideration was, that now she
might go out into the street and see the sights, and hear the news,
and escape from the terror which she felt at the presence of her
cousin. She flew upstairs to find her own mantle, ran down again, and
past Lois, before the English girl had finished her prayer, and was
speedily mingled among the crowd going to the meeting-house. There
also Faith and Lois came in due course of rime, but separately, not
together. Faith so evidently avoided Lois that she, humbled and
grieved, could not force her company upon her cousin, but loitered a
little behind---the quiet tears stealing down her face, shed for the
many causes that had occurred this morning.</p>

<p>The meeting-house was full to suffocation; and, as it sometimes
happens on such occasions, the greatest crowd was close about the
doors, from the fact that few saw, on their first entrance, where
there might be possible spaces into which they could wedge
themselves. Yet they were impatient of any arrivals from the outside,
and pushed and hustled Faith, and after her Lois, till the two were
forced on to a conspicuous place in the very centre of the building,
where there was no chance of a seat, but still space to stand in.
Several stood around, the pulpit being in the middle, and already
occupied by two ministers in Geneva bands and gowns, while other
ministers, similarly attired, stood holding on to it, almost as if
they were giving support instead of receiving it. Grace Hickson and
her son sat decorously in their own pew, thereby showing that they
had arrived early from the execution. You might almost have traced
out the number of those who had been at the hanging of the Indian
witch, by the expression of their countenances. They were
awe-stricken into terrible repose; while the crowd pouring in, still
pouring in, of those who had not attended the execution, looked all
restless, and excited, and fierce. A buzz went round the meeting that
the stranger minister who stood along with Pastor Tappau in the
pulpit was no other than Dr Cotton Mather himself, come all the way
from Boston to assist in purging Salem of witches.</p>

<p>And now Pastor Tappau began his prayer, extempore, as was the
custom. His words were wild and incoherent, as might be expected from
a man who had just been consenting to the bloody death of one who
was, but a few days ago, a member of his own family; violent and
passionate, as was to be looked for in the father of children, whom
he believed to suffer so fearfully from the crime he would denounce
before the Lord. He sat down at length from pure exhaustion. Then Dr
Cotton Mather stood forward; he did not utter more than a few words
of prayer, calm in comparison with what had gone before, and then he
went on to address the great crowd before him in a quiet,
argumentative way, but arranging what he had to say with something of
the same kind of skill which Antony used in his speech to the Romans
after C&frac34;sar's murder. Some of Dr Mather's words have been
preserved to us, as he afterwards wrote them down in one of his
works. Speaking of those 'unbelieving Sadducees' who doubted the
existence of such a crime, he said: 'Instead of their apish shouts
and jeers at blessed Scripture, and histories which have such
undoubted confirmation as that no man that has breeding enough to
regard the common laws of human society will offer to doubt of them,
it becomes us rather to adore the goodness of God, who from the
mouths of babes and sucklings has ordained truth, and by the means of
the sore-afflicted children of your godly pastor, has revealed the
fact that the devils have with most horrid operations broken in upon
your neighbourhood. Let us beseech Him that their power may be
restrained, and that they go not so far in their evil machinations as
they did but four years ago in the city of Boston, where I was the
humble means, under God, of loosing from the power of Satan the four
children of that religious and blessed man, Mr Goodwin. These four
babes of grace were bewitched by an Irish witch; there is no end of
the narration of the torments they had to submit to. At one time they
would bark like dogs, at another purr like cats; yea, they would fly
like geese, and be carried with an incredible swiftness, having but
just their toes now and then upon the ground, sometimes not once in
twenty feet, and their arms waved like those of a bird. Yet, at other
times, by the hellish devices of the woman who had bewitched them,
they could not stir without limping; for, by means of an invisible
chain, she hampered their limbs, or sometimes, by means of a noose,
almost choked them. One, in special, was subjected by this woman of
Satan to such heat as of an oven, that I myself have seen the sweat
drop from off her, while all around were moderately cold and well at
ease. But not to trouble you with more of my stories, I will go on to
prove that it was Satan himself that held power over her. For a very
remarkable thing it was, that she was not permitted by that evil
spirit to read any godly or religious book, speaking the truth as it
is in Jesus. She could read Popish books well enough, while both
sight and speech seemed to fail her, when I gave her the Assembly's
Catechism. Again, she was fond of that prelatical Book of Common
Prayer, which is but the Roman mass-book in an English and ungodly
shape. In the midst of her sufferings, if one put the Prayer-book
into her hands, it relieved her. Yet, mark you, she could never be
brought to read the Lord's Prayer, whatever book she met with it in,
proving thereby distinctly that she was in league with the devil. I
took her into my own house, that I, even as Dr Martin Luther did,
might wrestle with the devil, and have my fling at him. But, when I
called my household to prayer, the devils that possessed her caused
her to whistle, and sing, and yell in a discordant and hellish
fashion.'</p>

<p>At this very instant a shrill, clear whistle pierced all ears. Dr
Mather stopped for a moment--</p>

<p>'Satan is among you!' he cried. 'Look to yourselves!' And he
prayed with fervour, as if against a present and threatening enemy;
but no one heeded him. Whence came that ominous, unearthly whistle?
Every man watched his neighbour. Again the whistle, out of their very
midst! And then a bustle in a corner of the building; three or four
people stirring, without any cause immediately perceptible to those
at a distance; the movement spread; and, directly after, a passage
even in that dense mass of people was cleared for two men, who bore
forwards Prudence Hickson, lying rigid as a log of wood, in the
convulsive position of one who suffered from an epileptic fit. They
laid her down among the ministers who were gathered round the pulpit.
Her mother came to her, sending up a wailing cry at the sight of her
distorted child. Dr Mather came down from the pulpit and stood over
her, exorcising the devil in possession, as one accustomed to such
scenes. The crowd pressed forward in mute horror. At length her
rigidity of form and feature gave way, and she was terribly
convulsed--torn by the devil, as they called it. By and by, the
violence of the attack was over, and the spectators began to breathe
once more; though still the former horror brooded over them, and they
listened as if for the sudden ominous whistle again, and glanced
fearfully around, as if Satan were at their backs picking out his
next victim.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Dr Mather, Pastor Tappau, and one or two others, were
exhorting Prudence to reveal, if she could, the name of the person,
the witch, who, by influence over Satan, had subjected the child to
such torture as that which they had just witnessed. They bade her
speak in the name of the Lord. She whispered a name in the low voice
of exhaustion. None of the congregation could hear what it was. But
the Pastor Tappau, when he heard it drew back in dismay, while Dr
Mather, knowing not to whom the name belonged, cried out, in a clear,
cold voice--</p>

<p>'Know ye one Lois Barclay; for it is she who bath bewitched this
poor child?'</p>

<p>The answer was given rather by action than by word, although a low
murmur went up from many. But all fell back, as far as falling back
in such a crowd was possible, from Lois Barclay, where she stood--and
looked on her with surprise and horror. A space of some feet, where
no possibility of space had seemed to be not a minute before, left
Lois standing alone, with every eye fixed upon her in hatred and
dread. She stood like one speechless, tongue-tied, as if in a dream.
She a witch! accursed as witches were in the sight of God and man!
Her smooth, healthy face became contracted into shrivel and pallor;
but she uttered not a word, only looked at Dr Mather with her dilated
terrified eyes.</p>

<p>Some one said, 'She is of the household of Grace Hickson, a
God-fearing women.' Lois did not know if the words were in her favour
or not. She did not think about them, even; they told less on her
than on any person present. She a witch! and the silver glittering
Avon, and the drowning woman she had seen in her childhood at
Barford--at home in England--was before her, and her eyes fell before
her doom. There was some commotion--some rustling of papers; the
magistrates of the town were drawing near the pulpit and consulting
with the ministers. Dr Mather spoke again--</p>

<p>'The Indian woman, who was hung this morning, named certain
people, whom she deposed to have seen at the horrible meetings for
the worship of Satan; but there is no name of Lois Barclay down upon
the paper, although we are stricken at the sight of the names of
some'--</p>

<p>An interruption--a consultation. Again Dr Mather spoke--</p>

<p>'Bring the accused witch, Lois Barclay, near to this poor
suffering child of Christ.'</p>

<p>They rushed forward to force Lois to the place where Prudence lay.
But Lois walked forward of herself--</p>

<p>'Prudence,' she said, in such a sweet, touching voice, that, long
afterwards, those who heard it that day spoke of it to their
children, 'have I ever said an unkind word to you, much less done you
an ill rum? Speak, dear child! You did not know what you said just
now, did you?'</p>

<p>But Prudence writhed away from her approach, and screamed out, as
if stricken with fresh agony--</p>

<p>'Take her away! take her away! Witch Lois! Witch Lois, who threw
me down only this morning, and turned my arm black and blue.' And she
bared her arm, as if in confirmation of her words. It was sorely
bruised.</p>

<p>'I was not near you, Prudence!' said Lois sadly. But that was only
reckoned fresh evidence of her diabolical power.</p>

<p>Lois's brain began to get bewildered. 'Witch Lois'! She a witch,
abhorred of all men! yet she would try to think, and make one more
effort.</p>

<p>'Aunt Hickson,' she said, and Grace came forwards. 'Am I a witch,
Aunt Hickson?' she asked; for her aunt, stern, harsh, unloving as she
might be, was truth itself, and Lois thought--so near to delirium had
she come--if her aunt condemned her, it was possible she might indeed
be a witch.</p>

<p>Grace Hickson faced her unwillingly.</p>

<p>'It is a stain upon our family for ever,' was the thought in her
mind.</p>

<p>'It is for God to judge whether thou art a witch or not. Not for
me. I</p>

<p>'Alas, alas!' moaned Lois; for she had looked at Faith, and learnt
that no good word was to be expected from her gloomy face and averted
eyes. The meeting-house was full of eager voices, repressed, out of
reverence for the place, into tones of earnest murmuring that seemed
to fill the air with gathering sounds of anger; and those who had
first fallen back from the place where Lois stood were now pressing
forwards and round about her, ready to seize the young friendless
girl, and bear her off to prison. Those who might have been, who
ought to have been, her friends, were either averse or indifferent to
her; though only Prudence made any open outcry upon her. That evil
child cried out perpetually that Lois had cast a devilish spell upon
her, and bade them keep the witch away from her; and, indeed,
Prudence was strangely convulsed, when once or twice Lois's perplexed
and wistful eyes were turned in her direction. Here and there, girls,
women, tittering strange cries, and apparently suffering from the
same kind of convulsive fit as that which had attacked Prudence, were
centres of a group of agitated friends, who muttered much and
savagely of witchcraft, and the list which had been taken down only
the night before from Hota's own lips. They demanded to have it made
public, and objected to the slow forms of the law. Others, not so
much or so immediately interested in the sufferers, were kneeling
around, and praying aloud for themselves and their own safety, until
the excitement should be so much quelled as to enable Dr Cotton
Mather to be again heard in prayer and exhortation.</p>

<p>And where was Manasseh? What said he? You must remember that the
stir of the outcry, the accusation, the appeals of the accused, all
seemed to go on at once, amid die buzz and din of the people who had
come to worship God, but remained to judge and upbraid their
fellow-creature. Tin now, Lois had only caught a glimpse of Manasseh,
who was apparently trying to push forwards, but whom his mother was
holding back with word and action, as Lois knew she would hold him
back; for it was not for the first time that she was made aware how
carefully her aunt had always shrouded his decent reputation among
his fellow-citizens from the least suspicion of his seasons of
excitement and incipient insanity. On such days, when he himself
imagined that he heard prophetic voices and saw prophetic visions,
his mother would do much to prevent any besides his own family from
seeing Mm; and now Lois, by a process swifter than reasoning, felt
certain, from her one look at his face when she saw it, colourless
and deformed by intensity of expression, among a number of others,
all simply ruddy and angry, that he was in such a state that his
mother would in vain do her utmost to prevent his making himself
conspicuous. Whatever force or argument Grace used, it was of no
avail. In another moment, he was by Lois's side, stammering with
excitement, and giving vague testimony, which would have been of
little value in a calm court of justice, and was only oil to the
smouldering fire of that audience.</p>

<p>'Away with her to gaol!' 'Seek out the witches!' 'The sin has
spread into all households!' 'Satan is in the very midst of us!'
'Strike and spare not!' In vain Dr Cotton Mather raised his voice in
loud prayers, in which he assumed the guilt of the accused girl; no
one listened, all were anxious to secure Lois, as if they feared she
would vanish from before their very eyes: she, white, trembling,
standing quite still in the tight grasp of strange, fierce men, her
dilated eyes only wandering a little now and then in search of some
pitiful face---some pitiful face that, among all those hundreds, was
not to be found. While some fetched cords to bind her, and others, by
low questions, suggested new accusations to the distempered brain of
Prudence, Manasseh obtained a hearing once more. Addressing Dr Cotton
Mather, he said, evidently anxious to make clear some new argument
that had just suggested itself to him: 'Sir, in this matter, be she
witch or not, the end has been foreshown to me by the spirit of
prophecy. Now, reverend sir, if the event be known to the spirit, it
must have been foredoomed in the counsels of God. If so, why punish
her for doing that in which she had no free-will?'</p>

<p>'Young man,' said Dr Mather, bending down from the pulpit and
looking very severely upon Manasseh, 'Take care! you arc trenching on
blasphemy.'</p>

<p>'I do not care. I say it again. Either Lois Barclay is a witch, or
she is not. If she is, it has been foredoomed for her, for I have
seen a vision of her death as a condemned witch for many months
past--and the voice has told me there was but one escape for
her--Lois--the voice you know'--In his excitement he began to wander
a little; but it was touching to see how conscious he was, that by
giving way he would lose the thread of the logical argument by which
he hoped to prove that Lois ought not to be punished, and with what
an effort he wrenched his imagination away from the old ideas, and
strove to concentrate all his mind upon the plea that, if Lois was a
witch, it had been shown him by prophecy: and, if there was prophecy,
there must be foreknowledge; if foreknowledge, no freedom; if no
freedom, no exercise of free-will; and, therefore, that Lois was not
justly amenable to punishment.</p>

<p>On he went, plunging into heresy, caring not--growing more and
more passionate every instant, but directing his passion into keen
argument, desperate sarcasm, instead of allowing it to excite his
imagination. Even Dr Mather felt himself on the point of being
worsted in the very presence of this congregation, who, but a short
half-hour ago, looked upon him as all but infallible. Keep a good
heart, Cotton Mather! your opponent's eye begins to glare and flicker
with a terrible, yet uncertain, light--his speech grows less
coherent, and his arguments are mixed up with wild glimpses at wilder
revelations made to himself alone. He has touched on the limits--he
has entered the borders--of blasphemy; and, with an awful cry of
horror and reprobation, the congregation rise up, as one man, against
the blasphemer. Dr Mather smiled a grim smile; and the people were
ready to stone Manasseh, who went on, regardless, talking and
raving.</p>

<p>'Stay, stay!' said Grace Hickson--all the decent family shame
which prompted her to conceal the mysterious misfortune of her only
son from public knowledge done away with by the sense of the
immediate danger to his life. 'Touch him not! He knows not what he is
saying. The fit is upon him. I tell you the truth before God. My son,
my only son, is mad.'</p>

<p>They stood aghast at the intelligence. The grave young citizen,
who had silently taken his part in life close by them in their daily
lives--not mixing much with them, it was true, but looked up to,
perhaps, all the more--the student of abstruse books on theology, fit
to converse with the most learned ministers that ever came about
those parts--was he the same with the man now pouring out wild words
to Lois the witch, as if he and she were the only two present? A
solution of it all occurred to them. He was another victim. Great was
the power of Satan! Through the arts of the devil, that white statue
of a girl had mastered the soul of Manasseh Hickson. SO the word
spread from mouth to mouth. And Grace heard it. It seemed a healing
balsam for her shame. With wilful, dishonest blindness, she would not
see--not even in her secret heart would she acknowledge--that
Manasseh had been strange, and moody, and violent long before the
English girl had reached Salem. She even found some specious reason
for his attempt at suicide long ago. He was recovering from a
fever--and though tolerably well in health, the delirium had not
finally left him. But since Lois came, how headstrong he had been at
times! how unreasonable! how moody! What a strange delusion was that
which he was under, of being bidden by some voice to marry her! How
he followed her about, and clung to her, as under some compulsion of
affection! And over all reigned the idea that, if he were indeed
suffering from being bewitched, he was not mad, and might again
assume the honourable position he had held in the congregation and in
the town, when the spell by which he was held was destroyed. So Grace
yielded to the notion herself, and encouraged it in others, that Lois
Barclay had bewitched both Manasseh and Prudence. And the consequence
of this belief was, that Lois was to be tried, with little chance in
her favour, to see whether she was a witch or no; and if a witch,
whether she would confess, implicate others, repent, and live a life
of bitter shame, avoided by all men, and cruelly treated by most; or
die, impenitent, hardened, denying her crime upon the gallows.</p>

<p>And so they dragged Lois away from the congregation of Christians
to the gaol, to await her trial. I say 'dragged her': because,
although she was docile enough to have followed them whither they
would, she was now so faint as to require extraneous force--poor
Lois! who should have been carried and tended lovingly in her state
of exhaustion; but, instead, was so detested by the multitude, who
looked upon her as an accomplice of Satan in all his evil doings,
that they cared no more how they treated her than a careless boy
minds how he handles the toad that he is going to throw over the
wall.</p>

<p>When Lois came to her full senses, she found herself lying on a
short, hard bed in a dark, square room, which she at once knew must
be a part of the city gaol. It was about eight feet square; it had
stone walls on every side, and a grated opening high above her head,
letting in all the light and air that could enter through about a
square foot of aperture. It was so lonely, so dark to that poor girl,
when she came slowly and painfully out of her long faint. She did so
want human help in that struggle which always supervenes after a
swoon; when the effort is to clutch at life, and the effort seems too
much for the will. She did not at first understand where she was, did
not understand how she came to be there; nor did she care to
understand. Her physical instinct was to lie still and let the
hurrying pulses have time to calm. So she shut her eyes once more.
Slowly, slowly the recollection of the scene in the meeting-house
shaped itself into a kind of picture before her. She saw within her
eyelids, as it were, that sea of loathing faces all turned towards
her, as towards something unclean and hateful. And you must remember,
you who in the nineteenth century read this account, that witchcraft
was a real terrible sin to her, Lois Barclay, two hundred years ago.
The look on their faces, stamped on heart and brain, excited in her a
sort of strange sympathy. Could it, O God!--could it be true, that
Satan had obtained the terrific power over her and her will of which
she had heard and read? Could she indeed be possessed by a demon and
be indeed a witch, and yet till now have been unconscious of it? And
her excited imagination recalled, with singular vividness, all she
had ever heard on the subject--the horrible midnight sacrament, the
very presence and power of Satan. Then, remembering every angry
thought against her neighbour, against the impertinences of Prudence,
against the overbearing authority of her aunt, against the
persevering crazy suit of Manasseh, her indignation--only that
morning, but such ages off in real time--at Faith's injustice: oh,
could such evil thoughts have had devilish power given to them by the
father of evil, and, all unconsciously to herself, have gone forth as
active curses in die world? And so the ideas went on careering wildly
through the poor girl's brain, the girl thrown inward upon herself.
At length, the sting of her imagination forced her to start up
impatiently. What was this? A weight of iron on her legs--a weight
stated afterwards, by the gaoler of Salem prison, to have been 'not
more than eight pounds.' It was well for Lois it was a tangible ill,
bringing her back from the wild, illimitable desert in which her
imagination was wandering. She took hold of the iron, and saw her tom
stocking, her bruised ankle, and began to cry pitifully, out of
strange compassion with herself. They feared, then, that even in that
cell she would find a way to escape! Why, the utter, ridiculous
impossibility of the thing convinced her of her own innocence and
ignorance of all supernatural power; and the heavy iron brought her
strangely round from the delusions that seemed to be gathering about
her.</p>

<p>No! she never could fly out of that deep dungeon; there was no
escape, natural or supernatural, for her, unless by man's mercy. And
what was man's mercy in such times of panic? Lois knew that it was
nothing; instinct, more than reason, taught her that panic calls out
cowardice, and cowardice cruelty. Yet she cried, cried freely, and
for the first time, when she found herself ironed and chained. It
seemed so cruel, so much as if her fellow-creatures had really learnt
to hate and dread her--her, who had had a few angry thoughts, which
God forgive! but whose thoughts had never gone into words, far less
into actions. Why, even now she could love all the household at home,
if they would but let her; yes, even yet, though she felt that it was
the open accusation of Prudence and the withheld justifications of
her aunt and Faith that had brought her to her present strait. Would
they ever come and see her? Would kinder thoughts of her--who had
shared their daily bread for months and months--bring them to see
her, and ask her whether it were really she who had brought on the
illness of Prudence, the derangement of Manasseh's mind? No one came.
Bread and water were pushed in by some one, who hastily locked and
unlocked the door, and cared not to see if he put them within his
prisoner's reach, or perhaps thought that that physical fact mattered
little to a witch. It was long before Lois could reach them; and she
had something of the natural hunger of youth left in her still, which
prompted her, lying her length on the floor, to weary herself with
efforts to obtain the bread. After she had eaten some of it, the day
began to wane, and she thought she would lay her down and try to
sleep. But before she did so, the gaoler heard her singing the
Evening Hymn--</p>

<p>'Glory to Thee, my God, this night,</p>

<p>For all the blessings of the light!'</p>

<p>And a dull thought came into his dull mind, that she was thankful
for few blessings, if she could tune up her voice to sing praises
after this day of what, if she were a witch, was shameful detection
in abominable practices, and if not--Well, his mind stopped short at
this point in his wondering contemplation. Lois knelt down and said
the Lord's Prayer, pausing just a little before one clause, that she
might be sure that in her heart of hearts she did forgive. Then she
looked at her ankle, and the tears came into her eyes once again; but
not so much because she was hurt, as because men must have hated her
so bitterly before they could have treated her thus. Then she lay
down and fell asleep.</p>

<p>The next day, she was led before Mr Hathorn and Mr Curwin,
justices of Salem, to be accused legally and publicly of witchcraft.
Others were with her, under the same charge. And when the prisoners
were brought in, they were cried out at by the abhorrent crowd. The
two Tappaus, Prudence, and one or two other girls of the same age
were there, in the character of victims of the spells of the accused.
The prisoners were placed about seven or eight feet from the
justices, and the accusers between the justices and them; the former
were then ordered to stand right before the justices. All this Lois
did at their bidding, with something of the wondering docility of a
child, but not with any hope of softening the hard, stony look of
detestation that was on all the countenances around her, save those
that were distorted by more passionate anger. Then an officer was
bidden to hold each of her hands, and justice Hathorn bade her keep
her eyes continually fixed on him, for this reason--which, however,
was not told to her--lest, if she looked on Prudence, the girl might
either fall into a fit, or cry out that she was suddenly or violently
hurt. If any heart could have been touched in that cruel multitude,
they would have felt some compassion for the sweet young face of the
English girl, trying so meekly to do all that she was ordered, her
face quite white, yet so full of sad gentleness, her grey eyes, a
little dilated by the very solemnity of her position, fixed with the
intent look of innocent maidenhood on the stem face of justice
Hathorn. And thus they stood in silence, one breathless minute. Then
they were bidden to say the Lord's Prayer. Lois went through it as if
alone in her cell; but, as she had done alone in her cell the night
before, she made a little pause, before the prayer to be forgiven as
she forgave. And at this instant of hesitation--as if they had been
on the watch for it--they all cried out upon her for a witch; and,
when the clamour ended, the justices bade Prudence Hickson come
forward. Then Lois turned a little to one side, wishing to see at
least one familiar face; but, when her eyes fell upon Prudence, the
girl stood stock-still, and answered no questions, nor spoke a word,
and the justices declared that she was struck dumb by witchcraft.
Then some behind took Prudence under the arms, and would have forced
her forwards to touch Lois, possibly esteeming that as a cure for her
being bewitched. But Prudence had hardly been made to take three
steps, before she struggled out of their arms and fell down writhing,
as in a fit, calling out with shrieks, and entreating Lois to help
her, and save her from her torment. Then all the girls began 'to
tumble down like swine' (to use the words of an eye-witness) and to
cry out upon Lois and her fellow-prisoners. These last were now
ordered to stand with their hands stretched out, it being imagined
that, if the bodies of the witches were arranged in the form of a
cross, they would lose their evil power. By and by, Lois felt her
strength going, from the unwonted fatigue of such a position, which
she had borne patiently until the pain and weariness had forced both
tears and sweat down her face; and she asked, in a low, plaintive
voice, if she might not rest her head for a few moments against the
wooden partition. But justice Hathorn told her she had strength
enough to torment others, and should have strength enough to stand.
She sighed a little, and bore on, the clamour against her and the
other accused increasing every moment; the only way she could keep
herself from utterly losing consciousness was by distracting herself
from present pain and danger, and saying to herself verses of the
Psalms as she could remember them, expressive of trust in God. At
length, she was ordered back to gaol, and dimly understood that she
and others were sentenced to be hanged for witchcraft. Many people
now looked eagerly at Lois, to see if she would weep at this doom. If
she had had strength to cry, it might--it was just possible that it
might--have been considered a plea in her favour, for witches could
not shed tears; but she was too exhausted and dead. All she wanted
was to lie down once more on her prison-bed, out of the reach of
men's cries of abhorrence, and out of shot of their cruel eyes. So
they led her back to prison, speechless and tearless.</p>

<p>But rest gave her back her power of thought and suffering. Was it
indeed true that she was to die? She, Lois Barclay, only eighteen, so
well, so young, so full of love and hope as she had been, till but
these few days past! What would they think of it at home--real, dear
home at Barford, in England? There they had loved her; there she had
gone about singing and rejoicing, all the day long, in the pleasant
meadows by the Avon side. Oh, why did father and mother die, and
leave her their bidding to come her to this cruel New England shore,
where no one had wanted her, no one had cared for her, and where now
they were going to put her to a shameful death as a witch? And there
would be no one to send kindly messages by, to those she should never
see more. Never more! Young Lucy was living, and joyful--probably
thinking of her, and of his declared intention of coming to fetch her
home to be his wife this very spring. Possibly he had forgotten her;
no one knew. A week before, she would have been indignant at her own
distrust in thinking for a minute that he could forget. Now, she
doubted all men's goodness for a time; for those around her were
deadly, and cruel, and relentless.</p>

<p>Then she turned round, and beat herself with angry blows (to speak
in images) for ever doubting her lover. Oh! if she were but with him!
Oh! if she might but be with him! He would not let her die, but would
hide her in his bosom from the wrath of this people, and carry her
back to the old home at Barford. And he might even now be sailing on
the wide blue sea, coming nearer, nearer every moment, and yet be too
late after all.</p>

<p>So the thoughts chased each other through her head all that
feverish night, till she clung almost deliriously to life, and wildly
prayed that she might not die; at least, not just yet, and she so
young!</p>

<p>Pastor Tappau and certain elders roused her up from a heavy sleep,
late on the morning of the following day. All night long, she had
trembled and cried, till morning light had come peering in through
the square grating up above. It soothed her, and she fell asleep, to
be awakened, as I have said, by Pastor Tappau.</p>

<p>'Arise!' said he, scrupling to touch her, from his superstitious
idea of her evil powers. 'It is noonday.'</p>

<p>'Where am I?' said she, bewildered at this unusual wakening and
the array of severe faces, all gazing upon her with reprobation.</p>

<p>'You are in Salem gaol, condemned for a witch.'</p>

<p>'Alas! I had forgotten for an instant,' said she, dropping her
head upon her breast.</p>

<p>'She has been out on a devilish ride all night long, doubtless,
and is weary and perplexed this morning,' whispered one in so low a
voice that he did not think she could hear; but she lifted up her
eyes, and looked at him, with mute reproach.</p>

<p>'We are come,' said Pastor Tappau, 'to exhort you to confess your
great and manifold sin.'</p>

<p>'My great and manifold sin!' repeated Lois to herself, shaking her
head.</p>

<p>'Yea, your sin of witchcraft. If you will confess, there may yet
be balm in Gilead.'</p>

<p>One of the elders, struck with pity at the young girl's wan,
shrunken look, said that if she confessed and repented, and did
penance, possibly her life might yet be spared.</p>

<p>A sudden flash of light came into her sunk, dulled eye. Might she
yet live? Was it in her power? Why, no one knew how soon Hugh Lucy
might be here, to take her away for ever into the peace of a new
home! Life! Oh, then, all hope was not over--perhaps she might still
live, and not die. Yet the truth came once more out of her lips,
almost without exercise of her will.</p>

<p>'I am not a witch,' she said.</p>

<p>Then Pastor Tappau blindfolded her, all unresisting, but with
languid wonder in her heart as to what was to come next. She heard
people enter the dungeon softly, and heard whispering voices; then
her hands were lifted up and made to touch some one near, and in an
instant she heard a noise of struggling, and the well-known voice of
Prudence shrieking out in one of her hysterical fits, and screaming
to be taken away and out of that place. It seemed to Lois as if some
of her judges must have doubted of her guilt, and demanded yet
another test. She sat down heavily on her bed, thinking she must be
in a horrible dream, so compassed about with dangers and enemies did
she seem. Those in the dungeon--and, by the oppression of the air,
she perceived that there were many--kept on eager talking in low
voices. She did not try to make out the sense of the fragments of
sentences that reached her dulled brain, till, all at once, a word or
two made her understand they were discussing the desirableness of
applying the whip or the torture to make her confess, and reveal by
what means the spell she had cast upon those whom she had bewitched
could be dissolved. A thrill of affright ran through her; and she
cried out beseechingly--</p>

<p>'I beg you, sirs, for God's mercy sake, that you do not use such
awful means. I may say anything--nay, I may accuse any one--if I am
subjected to such torment as I have heard tell about. For I am but a
young girl, and not very brave, or very good, as some are.'</p>

<p>It touched the hearts of one or two to see her standing there; the
tears streaming down from below the coarse handkerchief, tightly
bound over her eyes; the clanking chain fastening the heavy weight to
the slight ankle; the two hands held together, as if to keep down a
convulsive motion.</p>

<p>'Look!' said one of these. 'She is weeping. They say no witch can
weep tears.'</p>

<p>But another scoffed at this test, and bade the first remember how
those of her own family, the Hicksons even, bore witness against
her.</p>

<p>Once more, she was bidden to confess. The charges, esteemed by all
men (as they said) to have been proven against her, were read over to
her, with all the testimony borne against her in proof thereof. They
told her that, considering the godly family to which she belonged, it
had been decided by the magistrates and ministers of Salem that she
should have her life spared, if she would own her guilt, make
reparation, and submit to penance; but that, if not, she and others
convicted of witchcraft along with her, were to be hung in Salem
market-place on the next Thursday morning (Thursday being
market-day). And when they had thus spoken, they waited silently for
her answer. It was a minute or two before she spoke. She had sat down
again upon the bed meanwhile; for indeed she was very weak. She
asked, 'May I have this handkerchief unbound from my eyes; for
indeed, sirs, it hurts me?'</p>

<p>The occasion for which she was blindfolded being over, the bandage
was taken off, and she was allowed to see. She looked pitifully at
the stern faces around her, in grim suspense as to what her answer
would be. Then she spoke--</p>

<p>'Sirs, I must choose death with a quiet conscience rather than
life to be gained by a lie. I am not a witch. I know not hardly what
you mean, when you say I am. I have done many, many things very wrong
in my life; but I think God will forgive me them for my Saviour's
sake.'</p>

<p>'Take not His name on your wicked lips,' said Pastor Tappau,
enraged at her resolution of not confessing, and scarcely able to
keep himself from striking her. She saw the desire he had, and shrank
away in timid fear. Then justice Hathorn solemnly read the legal
condemnation of Lois Barclay to death by hanging, as a convicted
witch. She murmured something which nobody heard fully, but which
sounded like a prayer for pity and compassion on her tender years and
friendless estate. Then they left her to all the horrors of that
solitary, loathsome dungeon, and the strange terror of approaching
death.</p>

<p>Outside the prison-walls, the dread of the witches, and the
excitement against witchcraft, grew with fearful rapidity. Numbers of
women, and men, too, were accused, no matter what their station of
life and their former character had been. On the other side, it is
alleged that upwards of fifty persons were grievously vexed by the
devil, and those to whom he had imparted of his power for vile and
wicked considerations. How much of malice--distinct, unmistakable,
personal malice--was mixed up with these accusations, no one can now
tell. The dire statistics of this time tell us, that fifty-five
escaped death by confessing themselves guilty; one hundred and fifty
were in prison; more than two hundred accused; and upwards of twenty
suffered death, among whom was the minister I have called Nolan, who
was traditionally esteemed to have suffered through hatred of his
co-pastor. One old man, scorning the accusation, and refusing to
plead at his trial, was, according to the law, pressed to death for
his contumacy. Nay, even dogs were accused of witchcraft, suffered
the legal penalties, and are recorded among the subjects of capital
punishment. One young man found means to effect his mother's escape
from confinement, fled with her on horseback, and secreted her in the
Blueberry Swamp, not far from Taplay's Brook, in the Great Pasture;
he concealed her here in a wigwam which he built for her shelter,
provided her with food and clothing, and comforted and sustained her,
until after the delusion had passed away. The poor creature must,
however, have suffered dreadfully; for one of her arms was fractured
in the all but desperate effort of getting her out of prison.</p>

<p>But there was no one to try and save Lois. Grace Hickson would
fain have ignored her altogether. Such a taint did witchcraft bring
upon a whole family, that generations of blameless life were not at
that day esteemed sufficient to wash it out. Besides, you must
remember that Grace, along with most people of her time, believed
most firmly in the reality of the crime of witchcraft. Poor, forsaken
Lois believed in it herself; and it added to her terror, for the
gaoler, in an unusually communicative mood, told her that nearly
every cell was now full of witches, and it was possible he might have
to put one, if more came, in with her. Lois knew that she was no
witch herself; but not the less did she believe that the crime was
abroad, and largely shared in by evil-minded persons who had chosen
to give up their souls to Satan; and she shuddered with terror at
what the gaoler said, and would have asked him to spare her this
companionship, if it were possible. But, somehow, her senses were
leaving her; and she could not remember the right words in which to
form her request, until he had left the place.</p>

<p>The only person who yearned after Lois--who would have befriended
her if he could--was Manasseh, poor, made Manasseh. But he was so
wild and outrageous in his talk, that it was all his mother could do
to keep his state concealed from public observation. She had for this
purpose given him a sleeping potion; and, while he lay heavy and
inert under the influence of the poppy-tea, his mother bound him with
cords to the ponderous, antique bed in which he slept. She looked
brokenhearted, while she did this office and thus acknowledged the
degradation of her first-born--him of whom she had ever been so
proud.</p>

<p>Late that evening, Grace Hickson stood in Lois's cell, hooded and
cloaked up to her eyes. Lois was sitting quite still, playing idly
with a bit of string which one of the magistrates had dropped out of
his pocket that morning. Her aunt was standing by her for an instant
or two in silence, before Lois seemed aware of her presence.
Suddenly, she looked up and uttered a little cry, shrinking away from
the dark figure. Then, as if her cry had loosened Grace's tongue, she
began--</p>

<p>'Lois Barclay, did I ever do you any harm?' Grace did not know how
often her want of loving-kindness had pierced the tender heart of the
stranger under her roof; nor did Lois remember it against her now.
Instead, Lois's memory was filled with grateful thoughts of how much
that might have been left undone, by a less conscientious person, her
aunt had done for her; and she half-stretched out her arms as to a
friend in that desolate place, while she answered--</p>

<p>'Oh no, no! you were very good! very kind!'</p>

<p>But Grace stood immovable.</p>

<p>'I did you no harm, although I never rightly knew why you came to
us.'</p>

<p>'I was sent by my mother on her death-bed,' moaned Lois, covering
her face. It grew darker every instant. Her aunt stood, still and
silent.</p>

<p>'Did any of mine every wrong you?' she asked, after a time.</p>

<p>'No, no; never, till Prudence said--Oh, aunt, do you think I am a
witch?' And now Lois was standing up, holding by Grace's cloak, and
trying to read her face. Grace drew herself, ever so little, away
from the girl, whom she dreaded, and yet sought to propitiate.</p>

<p>'Wiser than I, godlier than I, have said it. But, oh, Lois, Lois!
he was my first-born. Loose him from the demon, for the sake of Him
whose name I dare not name in this terrible building, filled with
them who have renounced the hopes of their baptism; loose Manasseh
from his awful state, if ever I or mine did you a kindness.'</p>

<p>'You ask me for Christ's sake,' said Lois, 'I can name that holy
name--for oh, aunt! indeed, and in holy truth, I am no witch! and yet
I am to die--to be hanged! Aunt, do not let them kill me! I am so
young, and I never did any one any harm that I know of.'</p>

<p>'Hush! for very shame! This afternoon I have bound my first-born
with strong cords, to keep him from doing himself or us a
mischief--he is so frenzied. Lois Barclay, look here!' and Grace
knelt down at her niece's feet, and joined her hands, as if in
prayer. 'I am a proud woman, God forgive me! and I never thought to
kneel to any save to Him. And now I kneel at your feet, to pray you
to release my children, more especially my son Manasseh, from the
spells you have put upon them. Lois, hearken to me, and I will pray
to the Almighty for you, if yet there may be mercy.'</p>

<p>'I cannot do it; I never did you or yours any wrong. How can I
undo it? How can I?' And she wrung her hands, in intensity of
conviction of the inutility of aught she could do.</p>

<p>Here Grace got up, slowly, stiffly, and sternly. She stood aloof
from the chained girl, in the remote corner of the prison-cell near
the door, ready to make her escape as soon as she had cursed the
witch, who would not, or could not, undo the evil she had wrought.
Grace lifted up her right hand, and held it up on high, as she doomed
Lois to be accursed for ever, for her deadly sin, and her want of
mercy even at this final hour. And, lastly, she summoned her to meet
her at the judgment-seat, and answer for this deadly injury, done to
both souls and bodies of those who had taken her in, and received her
when she came to them an orphan and a stranger.</p>

<p>Until this last summons, Lois had stood as one who hears her
sentence and can say nothing against it, for she knows all would be
in vain. But she raised her head when she heard her aunt speak of the
judgment-seat, and at the end of Grace's speech she, too, lifted up
her right hand, as if solemnly pledging herself by that action, and
replied--</p>

<p>'Aunt! I will meet you there. And there you will know my innocence
of this deadly thing. God have mercy on you and yours!'</p>

<p>Her calm voice maddened Grace; and, making a gesture as if she
plucked up a handful of dust off the floor and threw it at Lois, she
cried--</p>

<p>'Witch! witch! ask mercy for thyself--I need not your prayers.
Witches' prayers are read backwards. I spit at thee, and defy thee!'
And so she went away.</p>

<p>Lois sat moaning that whole night through. 'God comfort me! God
strengthen me!' was all she could remember to say. She just felt that
want, nothing more--all other fears and wants seemed dead within her.
And, when the gaoler brought in her breakfast the next morning, he
reported her as 'gone silly'; for, indeed, she did not seem to know
him, but kept rocking herself to and fro, and whispering softly to
herself, smiling a little from time to time.</p>

<p>But God did comfort her, and strengthen her too. Late on that
Wednesday afternoon they thrust another 'witch' into her cell,
bidding the two, with opprobrious words, keep company together. The
new-comer fell prostrate with the push given her from without; and
Lois, not recognising any thing but an old ragged woman, lying
helpless on her face on the ground, lifted her up; and lo! it was
Nattee--dirty, filthy indeed, mud-pelted, stone-bruised, beaten, and
all astray in her wits with the treatment she had received from the
mob outside. Lois held her in her arms, and softly wiped the old
brown wrinkled face with her apron, crying over it, as she had hardly
yet cried over her own sorrows. For hours she tended the old Indian
woman--tended her bodily woes; and, as the poor scattered senses of
the savage creature came slowly back, Lois gathered her infinite
dread of the morrow, when she, too, as well as Lois, was to be led
out to die, in face of all that infuriated crowd. Lois sought in her
own mind for some source of comfort for the old woman, who shook like
one in the shaking-palsy at the dread of death--and such a death!</p>

<p>When all was quiet through the prison, in the deep dead midnight,
the gaoler outside the door heard Lois telling, as if to a young
child, the marvellous and sorrowful story of One who died on the
cross for us and for our sakes. As long as she spoke, the Indian
woman's terror seemed lulled; but, the instant she paused for
weariness, Nattee cried out afresh, as if some wild beast were
following her close through the 'dense forests in which she had dwelt
in her youth. And then Lois went on, saying all the blessed words she
could remember, and comforting the helpless Indian woman with the
sense of the presence of a Heavenly Friend. And, in comforting her,
Lois was comforted; in strengthening her, Lois was strengthened.</p>

<p>The morning came, and the summons to come forth and die came. They
who entered the cell found Lois asleep, her face resting on the
slumbering old woman, whose head she still held in her lap. She did
not seem clearly to recognise where she was, when she awakened; the
'silly' look had returned to her wan face; all she appeared to know
was that, somehow or another, through some peril or another, she had
to protect the poor Indian woman. She smiled faintly, when she saw
the bright light of the April day; and put her arm round Nattee, and
tried to keep the Indian quiet with hushing, soothing words of broken
meaning, and holy fragments of the Psalms. Nattee tightened her hold
upon Lois, as they drew near the gallows, and the outrageous crowd
below began to hoot and yell. Lois redoubled her efforts to calm and
encourage Nattee, apparently unconscious that any of the opprobrium,
the hootings, the stones, the mud, was directed towards herself. But,
when they took Nattee from her arms, and led her out to suffer first,
Lois seemed all at once to recover her sense of the present terror.
She gazed wildly around, stretched out her arms as if to some person
in the distance, who was yet visible to her, and cried out once, with
a voice that thrilled through all who heard it, 'Mother!' Directly
afterwards, the body of swung in the air; and every one stood with
hushed breath, with a sudden wonder, like a fear of deadly crime,
fallen upon them.</p>

<p>The stillness and the silence were broken by one crazed and mad,
who came rushing up the steps of the ladder, and caught Lois's body
in his arms, and kissed her lips with wild passion. And then, as if
it were true what the people believed, that he was possessed by a
demon, he sprang down, and rushed through the crowd, out of the
bounds of the city, and into the dark dense forest; and Manasseh
Hickson was no more seen of Christian man.</p>

<p>The people of Salem had awakened from their frightful delusion
before the autumn, when Captain Holdernesse and Hugh Lucy came to
find out Lois, and bring her home to peaceful Barford, in the
pleasant country of England. Instead, they led them to the grassy
grave where she lay at rest, done to death by mistaken men. Hugh Lucy
shook die dust off his feet in quitting Salem, with a heavy, heavy
heart, and lived a bachelor all his life long for her sake.</p>

<p>Long years afterwards, Captain Holdernesse sought him out, to tell
him some news that he thought might interest the grave miller of the
Avon-side. Captain Holdernesse told him, that in the previous
year--it was then 1713--the sentence of excommunication against the
witches of Salem was ordered, in godly sacramental meeting of the
church, to be erased and blotted out, and that those who met together
for this purpose 'humbly requested the merciful God would pardon
whatsoever sin, error, or mistake was in the application of justice,
through our merciful High Priest, who knoweth how to have compassion
on the ignorant, and those that are out of the way.' He also said,
that Prudence Hickson--now woman grown--had made a most touching and
pungent declaration of sorrow and repentance before the whole church,
for the false and mistaken testimony she had given in several
instances, among which she particularly mentioned that of her cousin
Lois Barclay. To all of which Hugh Lucy only answered--</p>

<p>'No repentance of theirs can bring her back to life.'</p>

<p>Then Captain Holdernesse took out a paper and read the following
humble and solemn declaration of regret on the part of those who
signed it, among whom Grace Hickson was one:--</p>

<p>'We, whose names are undersigned, being, in the year 1692, called
to serve as jurors in the court of Salem, on trial of many who were
by some suspected guilty of doing acts of witchcraft upon the bodies
of sundry persons: we confess that we ourselves were not capable to
understand, nor able to withstand, the mysterious delusions of the
powers of darkness, and prince of the air, but were, for want of
knowledge in ourselves, and better information from others, prevailed
with to take up with such evidence against the accused, as, on
further consideration, and better information, we justly fear was
insufficient for the touching the lives of any (Deut. xvii. 6),
whereby we feel we have been instrumental, with others, though
ignorantly and unwittingly, to bring upon ourselves and this people
of the Lord the guilt of innocent blood; which sin, the Lord saith in
Scripture, he would not pardon (2 Kings xxiv. 4), that is, we
suppose, in regard of his temporal judgments. We do, therefore,
signify to all in general (and to the surviving sufferers in special)
our deep sense of, and sorrow for, our errors, in acting on such
evidence to the condemning of any person; and do hereby declare, that
we justly fear that we were sadly deluded and mistaken, for which we
are much disquieted and distressed in our minds, and do therefore
humbly beg forgiveness, first of God for Christ's sake, for this our
error; and pray that God would not impute the guilt of it to
ourselves nor others; and we also pray that we may be considered
candidly and aright by the living sufferers, as being then under the
power of a strong and general delusion, utterly unacquainted with,
and not experienced in, matters of that nature.</p>

<p>'We do heartily ask forgiveness of you all, whom we have justly
offended; and do declare, according to our present minds, we would
none of us do such things again on such grounds for the whole world;
praying you to accept of this in way of satisfaction for our offence,
and that you would bless the inheritance of the Lord, that he may be
entreated for the land.</p>

<p>'Foreman, THOMAS FISK, c.'</p>

<p>To the reading of this paper Hugh Lucy made no reply save this,
even more gloomily than before--</p>

<p>'All their repentance will avail nothing to my Lois, nor will it
bring back her life.'</p>

<p>Then Captain Holdernesse spoke once more, and said that on the day
of the general fast, appointed to be held all through New England,
when the meeting-houses were crowded, an old, old man, with white
hair, had stood up in the place in which he was accustomed to
worship, and had handed up into the pulpit a written confession,
which he had once or twice essayed to read for himself, acknowledging
his great and grievous error in the matter of the witches of Salem,
and praying for the forgiveness of God and of His people, ending with
an entreaty that all then present would join with him in prayer that
his past conduct might not bring down the displeasure of the Most
High upon his country, his family, or himself That old man, who was
no other than justice Sewall, remained standing all the time that his
confession was read; and at the end he said, 'The good and gracious
God be pleased to save New England and me and my family!' And then it
came out that, for years past, judge Sewall had set apart a day for
humiliation and prayer, to keep fresh in his mind a sense of
repentance and sorrow for the part he had borne in these trials, and
that this solemn anniversary he was pledged to keep as long as he
lived, to show his feeling of deep humiliation.</p>

<p>Hugh Lucy's voice trembled as he spoke: 'All this will not bring
my Lois to life again, or give me back the hope of my youth.'</p>

<p>But--as Captain Holdernesse shook his head (for what word could he
say, or how dispute what was so evidently true?)--Hugh added, 'What
is the day, know you, that this justice has set apart?'</p>

<p>'The twenty-ninth of April.'</p>

<p>'Then, on that day, will I, here at Barford in England, join my
prayers as long as I live with the repentant judge, that his sin may
be blotted out and no more had in remembrance. She would have willed
it so.'</p>

<h3>THE END</h3>
