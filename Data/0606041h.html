<h1>The Separate Room</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Ethel Colburn Mayne</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">

<p>It was clear that Bergsma was pleased, and Marion Cameron held
her breath in thrilled alarm.</p>

<p>"You've done it--why! you've done it rippingly," said Bergsma,
in his intermittent foreign accent, which now made a w and y
precede the r in "rippingly." He did not look up, but read on
eagerly from the sheet that Marion had typed for him, this morning,
before he came into the study. She had felt tired, on waking, after
the late evening with its difficult job, and then the exciting
sense of having done it not so badly; she had hardly slept a wink,
but she was at Bergsma's house much earlier than usual, so that all
should be in best array when Bergsma came, and she herself in
something that might figure as composure.</p>

<p>"So it was interesting," Bergsma said, still reading. "Miss Grey
was in good voice, and Woolley not too--woolly?" He grinned at his
mild joke, but still did not look up.</p>

<p>"Miss Grey was splendid," Marion said, in her clear solemn
tones; "and Mr. Woolley was. . ."</p>

<p>She stopped. She wanted to acknowledge the joke, to say that Mr.
Woolley had been something textile, but the word would not present
itself, and Marion gave it up. "Mr. Woolley was quite good."</p>

<p>"Loose?" asked Bergsma, with another grin.</p>

<p>"Loose--Mr. Woolley?"</p>

<p>He glanced at her. "The part--it's quelque peu! I thought he
might have 'given' a bit for once, pulled his voice out...ah,
peste, no more of it!" He frowned.</p>

<p>Marion blushed. She knew she had been slow, and knew that
Bergsma hated slowness.</p>

<p>He laid the sheet aside. "It's all right. Send it off." Now he
looked up, and at her. "You enjoyed it--the job, I mean?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I did," she answered with the full force of her
earnestness.</p>

<p>He turned his thick blue eyes away.</p>

<p>"Like to do it again?"</p>

<p>"If you think I'm worthy..." Marion said, a shade more solemnly
still. All at once a different mood seized Bergsma. "Oh, any
intelligent person can turn out a notice like that. It wasn't an
important production... You've done it very nicely." He took the
morning paper; Marion knew she was dismissed to her own table in
the corner.</p>

<p>This kind of thing had happened before--the disconcerting change
of tone, when she had thought that he was really pleased beyond the
ordinary limits of a secretary's "giving-of-satisfaction."</p>

<p>Marion did not resent, but she would have liked to understand
it. Was it something in him, or in herself, that brought the quick
reaction? For she knew, as she had known before, that this was not
the mere return to business-manner when the moment for expansion is
over. No; he was cross, and about something that was definite, to
him.</p>

<p>She put up her article for post--the first words she had ever
written for print, and they were to appear, in the foremost musical
weekly, not as hers but his. She was Bergsma's "ghost!" Marion,
when first she had realized that this was what she was to be, had
smiled to herself with the humour of which, for all her lack of
wit, she was capable. Bergsma's ghost--a ludicrously dissimilar
one! He was short and squat, with a flat, smooth, white face, and
thick, prominent, most heavy-lidded eyes that deadened into boredom
frankly and alarmingly: "the eyes of genius," somebody had said of
them to Marion. Certainly, if that power of extinguishing his eyes
were proof of genius, Bergsma had it; and if the other power of
lighting so excitedly that they lit up his whole face were further
proof, the eyes doubly marked him. That was what made it comic that
she should be his ghost. Marion's eyes were large, but that was the
most they were. They always looked the same; their brightness was
constant--not a luminous brightness, but a mere surface glitter,
just enough to rescue them from dulness. They bored her; she
despised them heartily. Other things about herself she did not so
much mind. She was glad to have her strong white teeth, to be so
very tall and not an atom weedy; she could not help thinking, too,
that she looked more like "a lady" than most working-girls. (Marion
liked to call herself a working-girl, but it annoyed her mother.)
She carried herself gallantly, and had adopted the right manner of
dress for an impoverished but undeniable gentlewoman, glad and
proud to be the hard-working secretary to a leading critic of
music--the musical drama, especially. She wore dark, well-cut coats
and skirts, and broad, low stiff white collars, and sober hats that
had not "too much surface," as her friend, Mrs. Wynne, was fond of
saying. Marion didn't know what her friend meant, yet she always
contrived to get the kind of hat. It was worn one-sidedly,
"crammed" a little; that suited the frank, earnest face with its
wide brows and mouth, for it toned down what might have been too
much of earnestness. "You look almost piquante," Mrs. Wynne had
said.</p>

<p>"Not quite--I shouldn't countenance that; it would spoil
you."</p>

<p>Marion laughed. "You wouldn't countenance my countenance!"</p>

<p>But Mrs. Wynne did not laugh, and Marion flushed, as she often
did when people didn't laugh, as they often didn't. It wasn't a
good joke; one saw that when one heard it... She thought of saying
that; it sounded funny; but perhaps it wouldn't be a good joke,
either? At all events, it was a good joke that she should be
Bergsma's ghost. His public, this week, would read her devoutly,
thinking she was he! And he had known that this was to be so, and
yet had ordered her to send it off... She had not believed that she
could do it, when Bergsna, harried by a crisis at the theatre where
the opera in rehearsal was of his discovery--when he had said:</p>

<p>"Look here, Miss Cameron, they want a notice of that Russian
operetta at the Yellow on Wednesday night: the International
Amateurs, you know. Do you think you could do it? I'm so bothered!
It's interesting, though not important. I'd like to give them a
word or two this week, but I can't spare the time just now."</p>

<p>Marion had trembled. "Would they take a notice--from me?"</p>

<p>"They'll take what I send them," Bergsma said. "How are they to
know who wrote it? Do you feel inclined to try?"</p>

<p>His eyes were beginning to deaden... Marion hastened to say
something that would show she was not thinking of the sudden
evolution of her duties, or was thinking of it as an honour.</p>

<p>"If I only felt sure I could do it," she faltered.</p>

<p>"You know my point of view by this time, and it's only a short
notice--anything long would be absurd... It's very good of you,
Miss Cameron; we'll regard it as settled that you go and try your
hand." He had glanced at her again, a little suspiciously, she
thought; so Marion said, "I feel honoured," in her most earnest
manner.</p>

<p>He had a shrug and a grunted word for it; she felt again that
haunting sense of error... It made her the more ardent when the
evening at the Yellow Theatre arrived. Her mind was stretched to
fullest tension; the little opera was Russian of the subtlest, all
accumulation and intention, expressed in a new, disconcerting
scale, "that beats Sch&ocirc;nberg," said one of the appalling
experts among whom she sat, "into an egg-flip.".Though she did know
Bergsma's point of view, it was not an easy task for Marion,
writing her first article, to utter it, and so that it would be
accepted as his work. For Bergsma had a very special manner. It
seemed almost impious to ape it, but what else could he expect of
her? and Marion, blushing while she wrote, did ape it: the
quivering, suffused attack, the adjectives and adverbs, the
conviction and conversion, as in a revivalist campaign--Bergsma's
patent, making each experience of the higher musical drama into a
vicarious public change of heart; his heart, of course, had never
been anywhere but in the right scale.</p>

<p>Marion, though elated, was alarmed to find that she could "do"
it. Suppose he was angry? That opening--it was like...--But if
Bergsma had noticed the mimicry, he had said nothing about it, the
crossness did not refer to that, she knew. And now she had sent it
off--it would appear! Even though he had said it wasn't important,
she couldn't help regarding next Saturday as an epoch---she and her
mother, who had sat up for her, that "Yellow" night, with cocoa and
biscuits in their bedroom, and at one o'clock in the morning had
heard the article, and thought it exactly like Mr.</p>

<p>Bergsma's own.</p>

<p>Soon Marion was writing all the minor notices, yet the weekly
did not lose prestige. It was an astonishing development. All she
had had to offer, in the beginning, was her wide acquaintance (it
was hardly knowledge, in the deepest sense) with some new
developments in foreign music.</p>

<p>She had travelled, and (most useful, too) was polyglot in a
degree that rivalled even Bergsma, who never used his native
language-probably the one he now knew least, for it was Dutch, and
Holland has added little to the musical drama. Marion knew Dutch,
but that seemed to be one of the things in her that did not please
him.</p>

<p>"Ah, Dutch I now speak never," he had said hurriedly, when she
told him, and she had noticed with what an unusually foreign idiom
he then spoke. Normally he used quite normal English.</p>

<p>However, this had not deterred him from engaging her, and she
had not again mentioned her acquaintance with Dutch. His vexation
was put away among the rest of the puzzlements, once she had
thoroughly discussed it with her mother.</p>

<p>Marion discussed everything with her mother. Both were younger
than their ages, but while Marion, at twenty-eight, showed merely a
retarded maturity, Mrs. Cameron was of the type that never does
grow up. She was not "well-preserved"; her hair was grey, her small
pink face was frankly though quite prettily wrinkled and withered;
she was, in short, the confessed old lady who is a little
self-consciously a child. True to her type, she held herself to be
a deep diplomatist; Marion believed this of her too--she had been
nurtured in the faith. Thus they could, with zest and a tinge of
vanity on Mrs. Cameron's part, sit arguing for hours and hours
about other people's reasons for being or doing this or that. They
would turn an incident round and round, and up and down; then Mrs.
Cameron would bring forth an explanation which lately, now and
then, had seemed to Marion a little superannuated. She would laugh
her big, whole-hearted laugh. "Oh, mother, that's your
generation!"--and Mrs. Cameron, though offended, would laugh too,
and declare that Marion was now leading such a free life that no
doubt she must know better, but "that would have been the reason
when I was a girl."</p>

<p>In this way the repulse of Dutch had been explained. "He must
have been dissatisfied with a former secretary who spoke it. That
was it, you may be sure."</p>

<p>"Or perhaps," cried Marion the emancipate, "he was in love with
a secretary who spoke it. That could account for his nervousness,
too."</p>

<p>"But, Marion, Mr. Bergsma is married."</p>

<p>"&Ccedil;a n' emp&ecirc;che pas," Marion smiled.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cameron pondered the smile. Marion was growing; her mother
must grow with her.</p>

<p>"Will he fall in love with you, I wonder?" she said, archly.</p>

<p>Marion rose up from her chair. They were in their private
hotel's drawing-room, quite alone together; everybody else
preferred the lounge.</p>

<p>"Mother! If you ever say that again..."</p>

<p>Mrs. Cameron's little face at once took on a rosy obstinacy.</p>

<p>"I don't see why you fly at me, Marion. You said it first."</p>

<p>"I! Say such a thing about myself and...and Mr. Bergsma! I'm a
useful servant to him, that's all."</p>

<p>"So would the other one have been."</p>

<p>Marion gasped. "The 'other one!'" For a moment she could not say
any more.</p>

<p>Her mother became injured. "I see nothing dreadful in calling
another secretary 'the other one.' And please don't speak of
yourself as a servant, Marion; there's no need to do that, if you
are working for a salary."</p>

<p>Marion sat down again. "I am a servant, and I'm not ashamed of
it."</p>

<p>"You are an accomplished lady, who makes use of her talent to
help a busy man--not of course a gentleman, but. . ."</p>

<p>"Not a gentleman,"' Marion gasped again.</p>

<p>"Do not repeat every word I say." Mrs. Cameron was calm, but her
little fallen-in, pink mouth was closely set. "Mr. Bergsma is very
clever, but you must know as well as I do that he is not a
gentleman, in the way your father was, and Neil is."</p>

<p>"He's foreign," Marion panted. She had only just saved herself
from echoing "Neil!" Neil liked Bergsma; he had said so when he met
him before going out again to India.</p>

<p>"You are used to foreigners," continued Mrs. Cameron. "You know
that the Count and M. de la Vigne and Herr von Adelbert were not a
bit like Mr. Bergsma. He may be very courteous to you; I have no
doubt he is, but his manners to me..."</p>

<p>"And all this because Bergsma had omitted to open a door, the
other day, for Mrs. Cameron! He had been talking so eagerly that he
hadn't seen her get up. Marion did not speak; she could do nothing
but echo if she spoke. The Count--horrid old M. de la
Vigne--manners..."</p>

<p>"It is time to go to bed," said Mrs. Cameron, cheerfully, as if
nothing had happened. That was her tact, the famous tact which had
carried her--and Neil and Marion--through so many difficulties.
Marion wondered why she hated it, now that it was being exercised
upon herself. But mother had forgotten it when she spoke of Mr.
Bergsma as not being a gentleman. A cloud obscured the earnest
face, as she followed Mrs. Cameron upstairs, and wished, for the
first time in all her life, that they could afford to have separate
bedrooms.</p>

<p>She said much less about her work from that time forward. It
grew more and more exacting; there were few nights now on which she
was not out at concerts, for Bergsma was devoting himself to
musical drama: he found it more inspiring for his gifts of
exposition. It was clear that Marion's efforts pleased him; and yet
his crossness grew more pronounced, more constant--not rudeness,
but a curious coolness and aloofness, as it were a watchfulness.
And since now she did not talk about it with her mother, it seemed
the more oppressive, even sinister. Her mother did not ask the
questions Marion had expected, and would perhaps have welcomed;
they might have eased the dual strain. The strain was dual because
Mrs. Cameron, too, was often cool now about little things--the
cocoa, for example. It was always there when Marion came in late,
but there with an effect of duty, not of glad excited revel, as on
that first night. Marion sometimes felt a strange depression. Life
seemed altered; though outwardly more exhilarating, it was inwardly
less happy. Her toil was not the cause--that grew more dear and
glorious every day. No one could have told her articles from
Bergsma's now, and still he didn't seem to notice, or if he did, he
liked it, to judge by the opportunities he gave her.</p>

<p>One day, Mrs. Wynne said something which infuriated Marion.
"What's your salary now? I suppose it's a good deal bigger."</p>

<p>There fell an almost tangible silence. It was as if something
they had waited for had happened.</p>

<p>. . Marion looked at her friend. Mrs. Wynne was not looking at
Marion, but her eyes had just met Mrs. Cameron's, and Marion caught
the gleam. She felt her own eyes flash.</p>

<p>"My salary remains the same."</p>

<p>There was another little silence; then Mrs. Wynne said, "Well
done, Bergsma!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" cried Marion, choking.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cameron intervened at that point; she said something about
"on probation."</p>

<p>"Rather a long probation," Mrs. Wynne observed.</p>

<p>Marion got up. Her voice was gone, her eyes did not flash now,
but dimmed with sudden, smarting tears. She stood a moment, looking
at the others, then hurried from the room.</p>

<p>So that was what her mother had been plotting. She had asked
Mrs. Wynne to say something; the meeting of their eyes betrayed
it... When one was being given such a chance! If Bergsma knew, he
wouldn't think so highly of his lady-secretary. Rather common, a
sordid rise, as if she were indeed a servant! That was just the
difference it made, to be a lady. But mother was a lady too, if
Mrs. Wynne was a little too shrewd to be "quite-quite..." However,
there was no time to worry about it; she had a bigger job to-night
than she had ever had before-a symphony, a Danish one, produced by
a Society on their special Sunday night for the innermost circle
(Bergsma was out of town). She must keep fit for that. And
supper--Sunday supper here, with her mother!</p>

<p>Could she stand it? All the time that hateful incident would
hover, of the eyes that met and parted furtively... No; she
couldn't go through supper.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Cameron came up to change her dress, she found a note
upon the pin-cushion.</p>

<p>Marion was supping at a little restaurant, "quite nice and
respectable," close to the hall where her job lay; she would be
home at the usual hour.</p>

<p>Her mother was asleep, or seemed to be asleep, when she came in.
There was no cocoa.</p>

<p>2 xxx Quite without warning it came--the letter in which Bergsma
said he had decided to dispense with a secretary for the
present.</p>

<p>Marion read it at breakfast. She managed not to cry out; if she
turned white, nobody saw her, in the pre-occupation with their food
which, at breakfast especially, was a source of continual unrest
among the boarders. She put the letter in her belt, and blindly
took a plate displaying a poached egg. Marion cut her egg
mechanically; it flowed over the toast, and something in the sight
made her feel sick... She would have to tell her mother after
breakfast. It would be dreadful; her mother would gush out, like
the egg. But the thing could not be hidden: better get it told as
soon as possible.</p>

<p>"Come up to our room a moment, mother, before you read the
paper," Marion said, when Mrs.</p>

<p>Cameron had finished. She had smuggled her own streaming plate
away, before it could be noticed that she had not touched the egg
except to cut it.</p>

<p>"Are you staying in this morning, then?" Mrs. Cameron said,
wondering.</p>

<p>"Yes," Marion answered, and a bitter wave of woe swept into her.
She would be staying in all mornings now... She mounted the steep
stairs before her mother, the distress increasing as she went,
until at the last landing (for their room was at the very top) she
broke down, and stood with her face hidden, trembling.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" Mrs. Cameron called sharply from the flight
below; she had seen through the balusters.</p>

<p>Without answering, Marion went into their room. When the little
staring face appeared, she silently held out the letter.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cameron began to read. Almost as soon as she began, her
daughter broke out crying---weakly, the sound muffled by her
covering hands.</p>

<p>"What is it, mother, what can I have done? Oh, tell me, tell
me!" Marion sobbed.</p>

<p>"Don't cry, Marion," Mrs. Cameron said quickly. "Whatever you
do, don't cry."</p>

<p>She was feeling for a prop to clutch at--there was nothing but
their pride: they must not cry.</p>

<p>That man, whom she had always thought so common--that man had
done this to them! She dropped the letter; Bergsma's cheque fell
out. Money--his... she could have stamped upon the cheque.</p>

<p>"Oh, Marion, do not cry. Remember what you are--and what he is!"
she added fiercely. But the fierceness died. Soon she was crying
too, because she could not bear to cry. Their sobs were audible
outside, for Mrs. Cameron had forgotten to shut the door; a sloppy
servant came and stared into the room. It had not been "done" yet,
and the girl's face grew sulky--now they'd stop her doing it, and
she was to get out so soon as she had finished upstairs.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cameron went to the door, and locked it. "I saw that horrid
Annie staring in," she gulped.</p>

<p>Then she did not know what to say. Annie would be cross if they
delayed her, and Annie could make a lot of difference to the
boarders' comfort. But Marion would certainly not be able to come
downstairs for some time yet. She had thrown herself upon her
unmade bed; her sobs grew deeper every minute. Mrs. Cameron had
never, since the baby-years, heard Marion cry until to-day.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, tell me what I can have done," she kept on
moaning.</p>

<p>Was it not an occasion for the tact?</p>

<p>"I believe," said Mrs. Cameron, "that you were getting to write
so well that he was jealous."</p>

<p>But Marion only groaned. "Oh, mother!" on a different note of
anguish.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Wynne says your articles really seem like making fun of
him sometimes--they are so like."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Wynne!"</p>

<p>"She was your idol, Marion, before... all this."</p>

<p>The tact seemed to be working, for Marion suddenly sat up. Her
face was blurred, but it could show that she was cross, her mother
thought--and then she saw that Marion was not cross, but
desperate.</p>

<p>"It's no use," said Marion. "There's no good talking about it.
The servant is dismissed, with a quarter's salary in lieu of
notice."</p>

<p>Mrs. Cameron's eyes burned. "Extra salary! How dare he?"</p>

<p>"I'll throw his cheque back in his face," the girl said, getting
off the bed.</p>

<p>"Not in his face, Marion--you wouldn't go there?"</p>

<p>"Mother!" Marion groaned again.--They were hunted from their
room at last, for Annie knocked at the door violently. Mrs.</p>

<p>Cameron put on her hat before she yielded; she was going out to
do some shopping, for she couldn't settle to the morning paper now.
When she came back, in half-an-hour, Marion still was sitting at a
table in the drawing-room, her face buried in her hands, as she had
been when Mrs.</p>

<p>Cameron had left her... It all began again, and through the
whole day it went on. The letter to Bergsma must be written--a
dignified, ladylike letter. Marion made draft upon draft: they were
not torn up as they accumulated, for in each there was a phrase
that seemed essential to her solace--one of gratitude, of meek
reproach, of sad affection. But to every phrase like this, her
mother objected. "No, not that, Marion--please, not that."</p>

<p>So it went on, and they got crosser and crosser. Tea in their
bedroom--their own China tea---was the one change from the hot,
dingy, saddle-backed drawing-room. The house-tea was in the lounge
as usual; they rarely went down. This hotel was their poverty's
consent--a place so typical of its kind as to be almost mythical;
no aggravation of the cheap private hotel's horrors was absent. But
tea in their room did not refresh them. They drank cups down like
poison-cups; Marion could "touch nothing," though Mrs. Cameron had
specially, that morning, bought some favourite and expensive cakes.
Would to-morrow be as bad, the older woman wondered. At any rate,
the letter would be sent by then, and Marion might pick up some
courage after it had gone.</p>

<p>After dinner Mrs. Wynne came in. The final drift had not been
written yet, and they had lingered in the lounge--each shrinking
from renewal.</p>

<p>"Shall we tell her?" Mrs. Cameron said in a whisper, as Mrs.
Wynne came towards them, threading her way among the chairs, "Just
as you like," said Marion, weakly. "She'll have to know some
day."</p>

<p>But in her heart she knew that she desired to tell. Despite that
incident about the salary, Marion still liked Mrs. Wynne. With her
much wider knowledge of the world she might throw light on
Bergsma's action, and anyhow one couldn't talk or think of any
other subject. Mrs. Cameron, on her side, wanted to hear Bergsma
blamed "as he deserved"; so eagerly they welcomed Mrs.</p>

<p>Wynne, and quickly transferred her and themselves to the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>"You can smoke there--nobody ever enters it but ourselves," Mrs.
Cameron assured her.</p>

<p>Sunk in the saddle-back Chesterfield with her cigarette, Mrs.
Wynne sat listening. Her expressive monkey-face said more than she
did, for at first she only murmured sympathetically.</p>

<p>But Marion, watching her face, asked suddenly, "Have you ever
heard that Mr. Bergsma was... was given to dismissing secretaries
without notice?" She laughed--a wretched little laugh, most sadly
changed from the big note of other days.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wynne said, "Not exactly that."</p>

<p>"Then what?" said Marion.</p>

<p>"I may as well tell you. He is a 'woman's man,' they say;
attractive to women, I mean. I shouldn't have supposed so, but
that's his reputation. And there's a Mrs. Bergsma, you see. Have
you ever met her?"</p>

<p>"She has come into the study once or twice," said Marion coldly,
and wished she had not asked her question.</p>

<p>"She may be jealous."</p>

<p>"Jealous--of me!"</p>

<p>"Not of you personally. It's common enough, you know, with these
men's wives."</p>

<p>"But Mr. Bergsma never..."</p>

<p>Mrs. Cameron interrupted Marion. "You said it yourself."</p>

<p>"Said what, mother?"</p>

<p>"That he might have been in love with the other one who spoke
Dutch. You know he did, Marion.".Marion saw a smile--at once
repressed--break on the visitor's lips. But there was no stopping
Mrs. Cameron; the Dutch episode was told, with "Marion's"
explanation of it, and in that vein the dialogue developed, while
Marion sat and writhed. There was a transition to the other theory
of jealousy--Bergsma's jealousy of the articles. Mrs. Wynne
rejected it.</p>

<p>"A writer with... with his sort of style" (Marion wondered what
that meant) "would never notice."</p>

<p>There were no more smiles, no looks exchanged with Mrs. Cameron,
yet Mrs. Wynne preserved an air of knowing something that they
didn't know. Soon she went away, a little bored perhaps, for they
had talked of nothing else. Then Mrs. Cameron and Marion went to
bed, the letter still unwritten. Mrs. Wynne had said there was no
hurry; Bergsma would anticipate a short delay. It galled Mrs.
Cameron--she would have liked to finish with him; but Marion seemed
re-lieved, and indeed neither could have faced an evening like the
day. So they went up to bed, quite early.</p>

<p>. . .A separate room--a room in which she could have cried
herself to sleep! But Marion must be quiet every night--there never
would be one when she might cry.</p>

<p>Soon after the candle was put out, her mother spoke.</p>

<p>"Are you awake, Marion? Mrs. Wynne thinks you're in love with
Mr. Bergsma, I am sure."</p>

<p>No answer from the other bed.</p>

<p>"You're not asleep; I heard you move the pillow--that's what she
thinks. I never liked her, but she was your friend, so I said
nothing. After all, I daresay it's a blessing the connection is
ended."</p>

<p>"Anything that gives rise to gossip... I should have thought of
that; I blame myself. However, it's all over now, and Neil need
never know how it happened. We can let him think that the work had
got too hard for you, as indeed I think it had. And with no rise in
salary! Do you remember how Mrs. Wynne remarked on that?"</p>

<p>But her voice had got drowsy; soon she was asleep. Marion for a
long while did not dare to move. She lay, like a dead body, stiff
and straight, and thought how like she was to one, except that the
dead body would be dead. It would not wake next morning, and the
morning after that, nor go to bed next night and lie so still
because it feared to set its mother talking of how it was believed
to be in love with Mr. Bergsma, but how Neil need never know.</p>

<p>Miss Cameron had been working too hard, Dr. Ferguson said; she
would have had to take a long rest anyhow--she could not have gone
on at that rate.</p>

<p>Marion peered at him suspiciously, and found him peering in a
similar way at her. He was a good-looking pompous man, her mother's
contemporary. Marion felt that he would be on her mother's side.
She could not have accounted for the feeling, nor till now would it
have come to her--there had been no "sides" till now. But as he
peered at her, she found herself reflecting:</p>

<p>"He'll call mother wonderful, too, like Colonel Morris and the
Admiral." Though Dr. Ferguson had attended the Camerons for years,
he knew nothing of their lives except their ailments and their
poverty; he now was obviously impressed when he heard that Marion
had been working with Bergsma. It was his foible to be up-to-date,
as he still called it; Bergsma's work appealed to him--there had
been a new Scriabin piece lately: "the Theosophical School," said
Dr. Ferguson, with pride, looking at Marion more respectfully.
"Exacting work, no doubt, yours must have been."</p>

<p>"I was only his secretary," Marion said.</p>

<p>"'Only!'" said Mrs. Cameron. She was standing, very upright, at
the foot of the bed, gazing pathetically from the doctor's face to
Marion's, like a child who knew that it was like a child.</p>

<p>Marion groaned. "Be quiet, mother"; and at the same instant her
conviction of the doctor's partisanship changed. He was on her
side! He had been peering at her still more closely, but when Mrs.
Cameron spoke he turned his head and peered at her. His eyes lit up
with a quick gleam; he prevented Mrs. Cameron from going on by
going on himself with animation, ordaining change of air as soon as
Marion was well enough ("and rich enough," said Marion, but he took
no notice); in the meantime she was to see her friends, not read
nor write at all, not brood, but look forward instead of backwards,
make the best of life... Marion lay and listened. She knew what
would happen when her mother and the doctor left the bedroom. He
would be told about the extra work, and the not-extra salary, and
her too faithful mimicry of Bergsma's style. Perhaps he would not
be told of Mrs. Wynne's imputed theory, but she wasn't sure: mother
was so... so foolish! That was the amazing word that came to her,
and Marion's thoughts diverged. Her mother foolish--she who had
done such marvels with her tact, who had carried her big son and
her big daughter on its shoulders, as it were. "Minnie Cameron's a
wonderful woman." Had there ever been a Colonel or an Admiral,
among their large acquaintance in the sort, who had not at some
time said that to Marion? And Neil too: he was always saying how
wonderful mother was...was she?</p>

<p>Outside the door she heard them whispering. Why didn't her
mother take the doctor to the ever-empty drawing-room? He couldn't
know there was a place that they might, practically, call their own
sitting-room, but Mrs. Cameron knew it; and wasn't whispering
supposed to be the thing most fatal to a patient's nerves? "No rise
in her salary": she could have sworn she caught the words. There
could be no need to tell him that; the work would have been just as
hard if she had had the bigger salary. But it was vain to torment
one's-self; mother always did what she "thought right." And as
Marion lay and strained her ears, the certainty grew stronger that
Mrs.</p>

<p>Cameron would put the other view before him--the view that
Marion might have been in love with Bergsma. She would think that,
also, right. Perhaps it was; perhaps a doctor should be told such
things about a helpless, useless daughter who would be a burden
again now, instead of a breadwinner. And she had been so proud of
earning her own living! Hot tears ran down her cheeks. As a
secretary pure and simple, she would not have broken down. It was
the hard work, late hours, excitement, mental strain, and--and
Bergsma's growing crossness and aloofness, his avoidance of her,
even while he used her; the thick eyes that had not flashed for her
this many a day, but always deadened, deadened more and more with
each infrequent interview. How she had watched to see the eyes
light up, the way they used, when she had "done" some concert more
capably than usual--and the eyes never had, though still he sent
her: "in case there should be something startling that I'd better
do myself, and then I can write-up your article." That had meant
that she must take even more pains than usual, lest Bergsma be "let
down," and ignore a masterpiece. But Marion had not minded, or
would not have minded, if...And then had come the letter.</p>

<p>They had not sent back the cheque. Mrs. Wynne had said it would
be futile and undignified; they couldn't bandy money about--Bergsma
would insist, it would be horribly uncomfortable; and the "salary
in lieu of notice" was the proper thing for him to do. So a
colourless letter had gone, in which the phrases of affection and
reproach were all left out. It had had the effect of making Bergsma
write again, holding forth vague hopes that some day he would be
able to resume Miss Cameron's "invaluable services." There had been
discussions on what he meant by that. Marion said, "Nothing"; Mrs.
Cameron (commenting with much sarcasm on invaluable) hoped so, but
was afraid he did mean something. That went on for days and nights;
inspirations on what Bergsma meant would flock in the
darkness.--.--But the breakdown had mercifully come at last, and
had done this for Marion--she might cry in her bed now. It was
called part of her illness. Without the illness, another
explanation of her melancholy had been showing itself as imminent.
"I shall begin to think that your friend Mrs. Wynne was right."</p>

<p>Those words had been said one day, in a flurry of temper, at
tea-time. Marion could go out of the room then; but if they should
be said and added to, at night, when the candle was
extinguished...</p>

<p>Mrs. Cameron came back, brisk and brave and pathetic.</p>

<p>"The doctor thinks we shall have rain at last. I'm glad for your
sake, Marion; this room gets so hot. The sun is cheerful, but the
rain will make things fresh again."</p>

<p>"Did you talk about the weather all that time?" asked
Marion.</p>

<p>"Of course we talked of you a little; he had to tell me about
your diet. But, Marion, dear, you know there are other things in
the world besides your trouble."</p>

<p>"Oh yes--the weather," Marion said.</p>

<p>"Invalids are never told what the doctor says about them. You
must not be unreasonable, Marion."</p>

<p>Marion fixed her eyes upon the little face, like a
ventriloquist's puppet's face. It looked back at her, and the lips
drew together, with a kind of peevish patience. "You've been
crying. The doctor says (as you insist on being told what he says)
that I mustn't let you cry, on any account."</p>

<p>"Then of course you mustn't, mother. How are you going to stop
me? Shall I tell you what I was crying about? It was about never
being alone. I'm going to ask the doctor to order me a separate
bedroom. The extra-quarter's salary will pay for it. It will do me
more good than any other change."</p>

<p>Mrs. Cameron began to cry.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, that's not tactful, is it, showing me a bad
example?" Marion loathed herself, yet could not stop. It was too
much for her--the triple wreck, of herself and Bergsma and her
mother.</p>

<p>The doctor would not order the separate room. He gave all sorts
of unconvincing reasons, very cheerily. Marion lay and looked at
him.</p>

<p>"I shall torment myself till I find out the real reason," she
said. "Will that be good for me?"</p>

<p>He laughed. "You have far too much intelligence, Miss Cameron.
You won't waste your mental strength like that."</p>

<p>"I have no use for my intelligence," said Marion. "I have no use
for my mental strength. One way of wasting them is as good as
another."</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense, nonsense!" laughed the doctor. "What you've got
to do is to get well, and then see if you haven't a use for them.
Mr. Bergsma's not the only busy man who needs a secretary."</p>

<p>A cunning look came in Marion's face. "And he may 'resume my
invaluable services,'" she said, fixing her eyes on her mother.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cameron winced, but she stood bravely up to Marion's eyes.
"Well, all right, darling, if he does." She smiled
pathetically.</p>

<p>The cunning look died out. "I'm not mad, I tell you both!" cried
Marion. The doctor took her wrist between his fingers. "What put
that brilliant idea into your head, may I inquire?"</p>

<p>"You two!" Marion shrieked, and tore her wrist away. "You two
think I am. That's why you won't let me have a room to myself, and
that's why mother grins and pretends she wouldn't rather die than
ever let me work again for Mr. Bergsma. She hated him, you know,"
she told the doctor in a sudden mood of confidence, "and all
because he forgot to open the drawing-room door for her one day!"
She sank back on the pillow. "That was why, just that"; and she
began to sob and moan...</p>

<p>But as time went on, she did get better. Her strength came back,
and with it, self-control. It was not often now that she sneered
at, or "flew at," her mother; she only lay and watched her, with a
smile. Mrs. Cameron did not like the smile, but she avoided
looking--it was the most tactful thing to do. And when Marion got
better and could be up, and better still and could come out for
little walks, the smile, though it was there sometimes, was not so
frequent. It, like the crying, had been part of her illness, and
that was nearly over; the smile would disappear when all the
illness did, and everything would be as it had been before, except
that the horrid Bergsma connection would be done with. Neil need
never know that Marion had, for a while, been so--so overstrained
that Dr. Ferguson had warned Mrs. Cameron not to let her be alone
even for a moment. Neil need never know, and that was all that
mattered... She looked at Marion complacently, one day in
Kensington Gardens; but instantly she looked away again. Marion's
eyes were fixed on her; the smile was there.</p>

<p>"You're a wonderful woman, mother," Marion said. "You've got me
over it."</p>

<p>"Over what, Marion?" Mrs. Cameron faltered, off her guard.</p>

<p>"My passion for Mr. Bergsma."</p>

<p>"Don't be wicked!" the old woman exclaimed. Marion was nearly
well now; there was no need to humour her to this extent.</p>

<p>"And my suicidal tendency, too," continued Marion. "I wonder
which I ought to be most grateful for. Which do you think?"</p>

<p>"I am not aware that either of those things was the matter with
you, I assure you, Marion, and neither is Dr. Ferguson. You
exaggerate your illness absurdly."</p>

<p>"You and Dr. Ferguson exaggerated it too, then. I often heard
you both; I was able to get out of bed, you know. I always thought
you should have taken him down to the drawing-room instead of
whispering outside my door, but it didn't seem to occur to you, and
as it was convenient to me, I said nothing... Well, mother, if I
can't believe in your wisdom any more, I can believe in your pluck.
It's just as good; I don't know that it isn't better. But I hope
you didn't tell anyone besides the doctor that I was in love with
Mr. Bergsma."</p>

<p>The little puppet-face was convulsed in the effort not to cry.
"I never could have dreamed that my daughter would listen."</p>

<p>"I was mad, you see."</p>

<p>"You were not, Marion, so don't bring that up as an excuse. You
were not mad, only overstrained. You exaggerate everything. I only
told the doctor what your own friend, Mrs. Wynne, had said--or what
she thought, at any rate. I never thought so myself."</p>

<p>"You should have thought so, mother. It was true. That was why
he dismissed me. He didn't want his secretary to have a passion for
him."</p>

<p>"Don't use that wicked word! And about that man, with his flat
face and horrid collars--they were never clean."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, they were clean, but they were lower than the men you
know would wear. That's all, mother... I used to watch for a look
from the flat face-was it flat? I suppose so. I only saw his eyes."
She spoke in a deep musing tone, with no smile now; she had
forgotten her mother.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cameron stood up. "It's nearly lunch-time."</p>

<p>The girl looked at her again. "Won't you let me talk about my
passion, a little now and then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Marion," the other moaned, returning. "How can you torment
me so? It's cruel of you!"</p>

<p>She sat down again. "You frighten me, indeed you do." Her voice
shattered into sobs.</p>

<p>The girl sat unmoved. "We're like two dead bodies tied together.
We don't love each other any more, yet we must be for ever side by
side... I think I won't forgive you for curing the tendency to
suicide, mother. The passion's different--I can brood on that. I
can think of his flat face, and wonder why a man with a flat face
was not more flattered--there's a joke. But he's a woman's man,
isn't he? He's tired of passionate secretaries, I suppose. That was
why he snubbed my Dutch; it would have been dangerous to speak in
his own language with a yearning secretary--"</p>

<p>Mrs. Cameron got up again, her pink cheeks glistening. "I won't
listen to you. It's disgraceful--that's what it is. You ought to be
ashamed."</p>

<p>"Haven't I been ashamed enough? Let me glory in my shame now,
for a change." She got up too. "Come home to lunch, mother.
Tuesday... it will be mutton-hash to-day, and treacle-pudding. That
will be so nice; we'll easily forget this painful scene. Yes, let's
go--home."</p>

<p>Mrs. Cameron pointed out the beauty of the autumn tints as they
went through the Gardens.</p>

<p>Marion looked at each example; then looked at her mother, with
the smile.</p>

<p>3 That phase also passed. Marion felt abominable while it
lasted; it was like daggers into a doll, and the daggers hurt this
doll. They made no difference, moreover; Mrs. Cameron said the same
kind of things between-times.</p>

<p>Mother and daughter went away together for their change of air,
returned, and Marion was nearly well. The doctor still came
sometimes, but now as though he were a friend, vigilant and
interested. He seemed, as she had felt before, to be Marion's
friend rather than her mother's; but Marion did not care; she cared
for nothing. In the passage of the months her bitterness had grown
beneath the outward self-control; she had one watchword
now--concealment of all feeling.</p>

<p>"I feel nothing, but if you must feel hide it--hide everything
about you, all you think and are."</p>

<p>It became a trial of skill. She paid visits with her mother,
watching for good opportunities for lies about herself, especially
the lie of being lazy, glad to cease breadwinning and be entirely
dependent, hanging as it were upon her mother's arm like a spoilt
child.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cameron's friends began to disapprove; Marion perceived it,
fostered it. The plan of the Minnie party was that Marion now
should teach the many languages--such work could always be
procured. Marion refused to try for pupils, not saying that she
liked best to be lazy--that would have spoilt the game. She let it
be inferred, amid glances of concern at the sad change in her.</p>

<p>The glances of concern pleased Mrs. Cameron. They made her feel
a wonderful woman again.</p>

<p>During the later Bergsma period there had been a certain
obscuration--Marion had been so prominent with her "inside"
knowledge of musical events, her acquaintance with the virtuosi,
her own remarkable development in capacity and self-reliance. But
now people saw again that Minnie was the heroine, with her bravery
and cheer, her patience with the lazy daughter. She loved to take
the lazy daughter out to tea, to come into a room thus followed,
and display her pluck and tact. But as the months drew out and she
felt firmer on the pedestal, an insidious change began. At some
houses there would sound again a note of interest in Marion rather
than in Minnie.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wynne's was one of these. The dark monkey-face would turn
and dwell, observing silently but intently taking in. She would
talk about music, that in-hibited topic on which Marion, lamentably
and surprisingly, still enjoyed to talk. Tactless of Mrs. Wynne! It
brought the whole thing up again--the buried past, with all its
mystery and invidiousness; and besides, "Marion would never try for
pupils, while she was encouraged to remember those horrible days,"
said Mrs. Cameron to her friends.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wynne's Irish maid was another grievance. This little
creature was "positively insulting" to Mrs. Cameron, one day soon
after the return to London. It happened thus. Marion and her mother
entered, and put down their umbrellas--Mrs. Cameron thrusting hers
into the stand, Marion propping hers against the table. Bridget
(she had an engaging cast in her right eye) gave swimming Irish
looks at Marion, whose height and "style" she openly admired--she
was far too free with both her eyes and tongue. Then she went
towards the stairs, with no admiring glance for Mrs. Cameron, who
had on a new grey toque. Marion, un-delayed by the small difficulty
of getting an umbrella neatly into the narrow stand, had begun to
ascend at Bridget's heels, conversing with her.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mrs. Cameron called out: "Come back here, Marion." The
two on the stairs stopped short.</p>

<p>"Come back and put your umbrella in the proper place."</p>

<p>"Oh, ma'am, it doesn't matter," Bridget cried. "The mistress
never--"</p>

<p>"Come back here, Marion." The face under the new toque was
scarlet.</p>

<p>Marion, pale and silent, stood still on the stairs. Her eyes
were dreadful. For an instant they met Bridget's.</p>

<p>"Do you hear what I say?" the voice below vibrated shrilly.</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake, mother..." Marion gasped, and came down from
the stairs. She went by her mother, and put her umbrella into the
stand.</p>

<p>"Oh, miss; oh, ma'am!" breathed Bridget, almost crying--but Mrs.
Cameron was now on Marion's stair, and was looking at her angrily.
Bridget gulped, and went on to the drawing-room door. Her voice
broke as she announced them. Mrs. Cameron pushed by her haughtily;
Marion. .</p>

<p>. . Bridget never knew what Marion did, except that she did not
break down, nor speak to Bridget, nor look angry, but--"Oh, ma'am,"
said Bridget, choking, to her mistress, "it was awful! As if Mrs.
Cameron wanted to shame her before me, turning her into a child
like that. The umbrella--Miss Cameron went down and put it in the
stand; I could hardly keep quiet when I saw her face. She'll go
mad, ma'am, if she can't get away from her mother."</p>

<p>Bridget's agitation was so great that Mrs. Wynne, though she too
thought it "awful," tried to calm the girl and herself by saying
that there was really nothing in it.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, ma'am, there was, and you'd know if you'd seen it. The
way Mrs. Cameron looked at her--you wouldn't believe the wickedness
of it."</p>

<p>"Nonsense; you're fond of Miss Cameron; you exaggerate."</p>

<p>"It's well someone's fond of her. You are yourself, ma'am. Is
there no way you could get her away from that old--"</p>

<p>But this was decidedly too much; Mrs. Wynne dismissed the girl.
She sat thinking. She had long perceived the trouble. The mother's
jealousy--innate and ineradicable--never roused by Marion till the
Bergsma phase, and then appeased by the dismissal, now again was
quickened by her daughter's attitude. If Marion's friends should
show more interest in that than in the mother's pluck and patience,
the jealousy would crouch, a-stretch like a wild beast that sees
its prey; and ah, that prey was visible! The daughter's pride--what
a long feasting meal... One knew such moods in these undeveloped
women, these old children, with the cruelty and blindness of a
child, but not the child's inconsequence. No; the feast once begun,
the wild beast would drive out the child; its prey would not be
loosened till consumed. "And one can do not one least thing to
save--unless indeed one should abandon Marion, and join with Mrs.
Cameron! Shall I urge the poor girl to the teaching that she
shrinks from? It might help; I'll try it."</p>

<p>When Mrs. Wynne next went to see them, in pursuance of her
scheme, she found a message from the Bergsma quarter so absorbing
Mrs. Cameron that even she--now almost openly cold-shouldered---was
called into council.</p>

<p>The message had taken the shape of a visiting-card--Mrs.
Bergsma's, intimating change of address. It had come to Mrs.
Cameron, not to Marion.</p>

<p>"Now what ought we to do?"</p>

<p>"Take no notice," Mrs. Wynne said, at a venture. She had not yet
surveyed the ground, but it seemed probable that this would
please.</p>

<p>It did not please, and as that showed, the visitor began to see
the rest. Marion sat by, silent. Not even by a look did she confess
herself, but Mrs. Wynne's nerves shuddered for her.</p>

<p>"There's nothing in it," Mrs. Wynne continued. "Mrs. Bergsma
just went through her address-book, or someone else did for her,
more likely. They'll not expect a call."</p>

<p>The argument began, went on; and Mrs. Wynne knew horror. All
cruelty seemed in it, all base vengeance, all that once meant
woman; each word seemed chosen to retaliate for that brief spell of
bliss and glory; yet as the listener looked into the little face,
she told herself that she, like Bridget, was imputing that which
was not in its owner's competence. This could be only sheer
stupidity; the worst evil was not there. But then again some
glance, some word, abominable, would upset the milder judgment.</p>

<p>"What does Marion say?" her friend broke out at last, unable
longer to fight single-handed. She turned to the dumb girl and saw
her quiver momentarily, then constrain herself to sit impassive as
before. But it were kindlier to force her speech, and Mrs. Wynne
persisted.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Marion," she entreated, casting aside caution, putting
all her friendship into the low tone. It was as if she challenged
the fell mother for the daughter's voice. No answer came. The
girl's eyes met hers for an instant, and she caught her breath.
What a look--what weary wastes of suffering... And yet admitted the
thing was trivial--almost certainly, a mere card-leaving: they
would not be admitted, no one ever was home on chance, in London.
But Mrs. Wynne could understand the girl's repugnance.</p>

<p>"I can't see why Marion should be with you, if you wish to go,"
she repeated, for this had been of course the first thing she had
said.</p>

<p>"It is only through her that I ever knew these people"--yes, the
tone, the look... "It is for her sake that I wish to go."</p>

<p>"But if she doesn't want it? Such morbid nonsense! 'Hanging
round the house,' she calls it. I think it is we who confer the
favour by calling."</p>

<p>But as if this, in its absurdity, were the breaking point,
Marion spoke at last.</p>

<p>"Mother has never consented to recognize Mr. Bergsma as a social
being. He's only a common little man with a crushed collar to her.
'No one' goes to his house; 'no one' knows the Bergsma."</p>

<p>She smiled--the old smile which had frightened Mrs. Cameron, but
now had lost its power.</p>

<p>"I don't profess to understand the society in which people like
the Bergsmas move. I leave that to you... and your friends."</p>

<p>There was a silence.</p>

<p>"Could you, Marion?" Mrs. Wynne then murmured. "Could you go, I
mean. It wouldn't be a case of getting in, I'm sure.".Marion,
having spoken at all, seemed to have abandoned wholly her new
attitude, for she gave her friend an overwhelming answer. "I could
go, but I won't. I won't be dragged there at mother's
chariot-wheels." She stood up. "Now you know, mother. I dare say
you'll say you don't understand, but I'll explain another time.
Don't drag Mrs. Wynne into a scene like this morning's. She
wouldn't like it. Let her off the rest."</p>

<p>But the teeth were firm in the flesh now, and Mrs. Wynne heard
all the rest. She heard that Marion was still absurdly 'sorry for
herself' and that her friends encouraged her, while Mrs. Cameron's
were more and more disgusted every day; that "that man" would
imagine, if no one else did, all that their omission to call might
signify; that indeed his wife could not be blamed if she had been
suspicious, and her card was intended for a delicate hint that,
having nipped the thing in the bud, she was prepared to resume a
friendly acquaintance. "Anything more disgusting, more indecent,
than Marion's whole behaviour since that man cast her off..."</p>

<p>And Marion stood and heard, without the smile, and said at last
in a pause:</p>

<p>"The most devoted and most tactful mother, you can see--and Mrs.
Bergsma is to see. How do you know I haven't been 'hanging round
the house' in secret, mother? Mr. Bergsma cast me off, as you say,
but men do that and women hang about them, still. Perhaps that's
why I stick at going to call--how do you know it isn't?"</p>

<p>But this was a bad slip.</p>

<p>"I know," said Mrs. Cameron, "because I've never let you out of
my sight for a single instant, and never intend to."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wynne saw Marion pale at that. She exclaimed after a
moment: "But Dr. Ferguson said yesterday that I'm to have a room to
myself, in future. They're getting it ready now; you know they
are." Her voice was harsh with fear.</p>

<p>"They're not getting it ready. I countermanded it, after this
morning's 'scene,' as you call it."</p>

<p>The girl sank on a chair. Her face was terrible to see, but Mrs.
Wynne did not see it--she had hidden her own. She sat, crumpled
into a heap, in her corner of the sofa. Marion looked at her, then
at her mother. Mrs. Cameron was by the tea-table; she was picking
biscuits from a plate and nibbling at them, and then dropping them;
her face was red and angry, but exultant.</p>

<p>"Look at Mrs. Wynne, mother," Marion said at last, in the old
languid tone. "She seems distressed. It's not a pretty scene. We
ought to let her go."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wynne sprang up. "I'm going. I can't stand it. You two
should be entirely apart--it's monstrous. Is there no one who could
take you, Marion, for a while? I will, if you like. I can't stand
by and let this be--it's not safe; I feel responsible... Let her
come to me!" She turned to the mother, speaking gently now: she had
regained her self-control.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cameron, a biscuit at her lips, laughed slightingly. Her
voice took a vile note as she replied: "I'll keep my unfortunate
daughter, thank you."</p>

<p>"Then some day you'll have to keep her in a mad-house," Mrs.
Wynne exclaimed, once more forgetting prudence.</p>

<p>"That's no worse than the kind of house you'd keep her in."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wynne did not hear; she was looking at Marion, who had got
up again.</p>

<p>"Stop!" she cried.</p>

<p>But Marion laughed, and threw the biscuit-plate--now empty--in
her mother's face.</p>

<p>It grazed the skin, that was all. Mrs. Cameron wept, Marion
stood and laughed. Mrs. Wynne took out her handkerchief to stop the
blood. The plate lay whole upon the floor some distance off; it had
fallen into a thick woolly rug. The blood soon ceased--it was the
merest graze. Marion stopped laughing; and Mrs. Wynne escaped.
There was nothing she could do, except go to Dr. Ferguson. He must
insist upon the separate room, at any rate.</p>

<p>She went, straight from the hotel--she found him in and told her
tale, and Dr. Ferguson confessed that he was anxious. He would see
the Camerons tomorrow. As a measure of precaution--"you understand
me?"--he had at first refused the separate bedroom; now he, too,
considered it essential.</p>

<p>"There can be no doubt that the mother's constant presence is
injurious to Miss Cameron."</p>

<p>"But what should make her so inhuman to the girl? It has been a
strain for both, of course; but what happened to-day was more than
nerves. I assure you, Dr. Ferguson, it looked like intentional
persecution. Yet surely such things cannot be?"</p>

<p>The doctor thought awhile; then said, "Persecution, yes;
intentional persecution (in your sense), no. Do you happen to have
read what is now being published here about Freud, a German
scientist, and his theory of the 'suppressed wish'?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Wynne had not. He set it forth, rudimentarily--a
subconscious motive, usually sexual in origin and sinister in aim,
underlying the conscious will, and secretly inspiring the action.
In certain conditions, it became the dominant impulse, potent above
all others.</p>

<p>"That amiable old lady," he continued, and as Mrs. Wynne
exclaimed, he sagely smiled. "As she appears, or appeared, to us to
be, and in her own view still is. She knows nothing of the 'wish,'
you must consider, either as a psychological theory or in
herself--the wish in her case being to dominate, nay, humiliate,
her daughter. You have perceived this in her, and may even, being a
woman" (he bowed), "have diagnosed it correctly as jealousy: no
rare thing, as doubtless you are aware, in a mother towards her
daughter, though here it takes a somewhat unusual form. It was
awakened, as I early saw, in Mrs. Cameron by her daughter's
prominence during the Bergsma period."</p>

<p>"It sounds more devilish than ever," Mrs. Wynne exclaimed.</p>

<p>"You must remember that the state is pathological. To inhibit
the 'wish' is not within the victim's competence, did she even know
that it exists. A pitiable condition--and the more because it
engenders dislike in all who witness its effects."</p>

<p>But Mrs. Wynne could feel no sense of mitigation; rather, the
"Freudian wish," in its gaunt determinism, seemed to add despair to
all the other ills.</p>

<p>"And the unhappy girl!" she cried. "Is she to be condemned to
this, because a German scientist has an interesting psychological
theory?"</p>

<p>He had an indulgent smile for her feminine unreason. "Most
natural--in a woman, most natural... But reflect that if the
daughter's martyrdom can be explained, it is not thereby
increased."</p>

<p>She groaned. "Explanations have a way of paralysing us, I think!
What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>Dr. Ferguson stiffened a little. "What can be done, you may rest
assured. The separate room, for example."</p>

<p>His tone annoyed her. "Is that the certain panacea?"</p>

<p>"We are struggling against an occult force in human nature, Mrs.
Wynne," he said, more stiffly still.</p>

<p>"But we're not sure it's there; we have only this man's word for
it!" And as he shrugged, she exclaimed, "I want to take Marion away
from her."</p>

<p>"Do so, by all means, if you can compass it," Dr. Ferguson more
cordially rejoined.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, I will ordain the lesser separation." His gesture
was dismissive, and she rose.</p>

<p>At the door she turned. "To-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Without delay," the doctor promised, again somewhat
stiffly.</p>

<p>But with the morning of the next day, very early, came the
secretary of the Camerons' hotel to Mrs. Wynne, who, going out, met
her upon the doorstep, and when she learnt who it was, drew her at
once into the dining-room. The woman, with a horrible detached
annoyance in her manner, told her news. Mrs. Cameron had found her
daughter dead in bed at six o'clock that morning--in the same room
with herself.</p>

<p>"In the same room, Mrs. Wynne, lying in streams of blood." The
faded, worried eyes traversed Mrs. Wynne's room curiously, as she
talked on. "Miss Cameron had cut open a vein in her arm, and bled
to death. Such a state as everything was in--I needn't tell
you!"</p>

<p>"It must have been," Mrs. Wynne heard herself inanely answer.
She looked at the secretary; there was a kind of pity in her horror
at the woman's callousness. She was so much the creature of her job
that her blank face, if it could be said to wear any expression,
wore only that of anger at the "state" of Marion's bedclothes and
the carpet by the bed.</p>

<p>"And the talk and annoyance in the hotel--it's been bad enough
without that; people leaving because of the old lady and her
tempers. We all thought Miss Cameron would go out of her mind,
three months ago, but she seemed better."</p>

<p>"We were getting a separate bedroom ready for her yesterday, but
Mrs. Cameron countermanded it. Well, she might have spared herself
something, if she hadn't--not that it would have made much
difference, I suppose. And of course there's any amount of trouble
and annoyance before us--the inquest, and all the
unpleasantness."</p>

<p>The inquest... of course there would have to be one... How much
could be kept back? Mrs.</p>

<p>Wynne controlled her face and voice.</p>

<p>"I'll come over at once and see Mrs. Cameron," she said, though
her soul fainted at thought of that interview.</p>

<p>"You won't find her. You wouldn't suppose that she'd be in and
out of the house every minute, but that's what she is, and looking
so queer with that cut on her face"--the secretary glanced at Mrs.
Wynne as she said this--"that she got at tea-time yesterday."</p>

<p>The biscuit-plate--had either of the Camerons remembered to pick
it up, or had a servant found it on the floor, so far from the
tea-table?...Mrs. Wynne again controlled herself.</p>

<p>"That cut was nothing, I fancy; I remember noticing it yesterday
afternoon. You say Mrs. Cameron won't be in?"</p>

<p>"She was out when I left, at Dr. Ferguson's; at least that's
where she told the taxi to go--she had a taxi, that time. He was at
the house this morning, of course; but she said she must see him
again. Goodness knows why."</p>

<p>Even the gleam of curiosity was listless. Mrs. Wynne felt, with
shuddering reassurance, that you could never fathom London's
indifference.</p>

<p>"I'll wait, then; I won't go back with you to the hotel," she
said.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Cameron spoke of you, this morning," the woman
apathetically remarked.</p>

<p>"And said what?"</p>

<p>"It's not very pleasant to repeat, but perhaps I'd better. She
said on no account to let you in."</p>

<p>"I was more Miss Cameron's friend than hers. It's odd, though,"
Mrs. Wynne returned, and hoped that she seemed only ordinarily
troubled. "At such a time, however, one can't wonder at anything...
Is there nothing I can do to help in any way?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so." But the woman still sat, looking round the
room, and Mrs. Wynne grew fidgety. She wanted her to go at once,
that she herself might get to Dr. Ferguson's before Mrs. Cameron
should leave him. No place could be so good to meet, and they would
have to speak together, let her knowledge be resented as it
might.</p>

<p>The secretary seemed to feel at last that they had finished. She
rose, but then she paused, and spoke with eyes averted.</p>

<p>"I found the plate myself," she said, as impassively as before.
"I happened to go into the drawing-room. I haven't mentioned it."
She waited.</p>

<p>"The plate?" said Mrs. Wynne, in a strained voice of
questioning.</p>

<p>The faded eyes met hers. "The biscuit-plate. It wasn't broken,
fortunately. We may as well leave it out, if we have anything to
say at the inquest. It would be a nuisance, if ..." She drifted to
the door. "You see, I have to think of my employers. People hate a
scandal about a private hotel; it ruins business. You won't speak
of it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean," Mrs. Wynne lied bravely.</p>

<p>The secretary looked at her again. "Something happened in the
drawing room," she went on, unmoved. "Any fool could see that--and
you were there at the time. But it's just as well for me to know
nothing about it, so don't tell me if I'm right."</p>

<p>With that, she opened the door at last; Mrs. Wynne went with her
to the steps in a stunned silence.</p>

<p>As she drove to Dr. Ferguson's, Mrs. Wynne reflected on his
theory. It, like K the biscuit-plate, would have to be kept dark!
Even in her grief, she smiled at a quick thought. The Freudian
Wish--and the Bergsma visiting-card... but such ironic fellowships
would be the very core, no doubt, of speculations in this kind. Was
it another Wish that put the silly strip of pasteboard in its
halfpenny envelope? And had Marion had one too--did she "wish"
Bergsma to know what had been done? For, without the card, she
would have had her separate room; those words would not have
sounded: "I've never left you alone for a single instant, and I
never intend to..." Never alone from Mrs. Cameron, ridden by the
Freudian Wish! A new burden had been bound upon humanity, if that
frightful theory were true.</p>

<p>She was at once admitted at the doctor's, for she sent in her
card. As she drew it from the case, she wondered if she ever should
do that again without a shudder--and knew that she would, that this
would pass as all things pass... She entered the
consulting-room--yes, Mrs. Cameron was there. Instantly the old
woman sprang up, and stood defiant of her. But the doctor put his
hand upon her arm.</p>

<p>"Keep quiet, Mrs. Cameron," he said, with stern decision. "Sit
down, Mrs. Wynne."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wynne sat down. She felt horribly unpitying. Mrs. Cameron
looked as usual--the pink face was a little pinker for the
sticking-plaster on the cheek, which gave her a weird air of
coquetry. Her mouth was quivering, but it looked more peevish than
distressed... And she had seen that sight, not many hours ago!</p>

<p>"Go on with what you were telling me," Dr. Ferguson said.</p>

<p>Still standing, with one hand on the table and her angry eyes on
Mrs. Wynne, Mrs. Cameron obeyed eagerly, as if she trusted the man
to be her friend against the woman.</p>

<p>She had evidently been telling him about the visiting-card.</p>

<p>"I thought it seemed unnecessary, but my opinion was that Marion
and I should call. I considered it my duty to uphold Marion's
dignity."</p>

<p>She stopped, still fixing Mrs. Wynne with her malignant
eyes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wynne dropped hers before them. A coroner's jury would not
have heard of Freud.</p>

<p>"Yes--your daughter's dignity?" Dr. Ferguson said, smoothly. His
eyes met Mrs. Wynne's when she lifted her head again.</p>
