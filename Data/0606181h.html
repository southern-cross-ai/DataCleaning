<h2><a name="s1"></a>The Last Day of Windsor Forest</h2>

<p>MANY of my younger, and some of my maturer years, were passed on the
borders of Windsor Forest. I was early given to long walks and rural
explorations, and there was scarcely a spot of the Park or the Forest,
with which I was not intimately acquainted. There were two very
different scenes, to which I was especially attached: Virginia Water,
and a dell near Winkfield plain.</p>

<p>The bank of Virginia Water, on which the public enter from the
Wheatsheaf Inn, is bordered, between the cascade to the left and the
iron gates to the right, by groves of trees, which, with the exception
of a few old ones near the water, have grown up within my memory. They
were planted by George the Third, and the entire space was called the
King's Plantation. Perhaps they were more beautiful in an earlier age
than they are now: or I may so think and feel, through the general
preference of the past to the present, which seems inseparable from old
age. In my first acquaintance with the place, and for some years
subsequently, sitting in the large upper room of the Inn, I could look
on the cascade and the expanse of the lake, which have long been masked
by trees.</p>

<p>Virginia Water was always open to the public, through the Wheatsheaf
Inn, except during the Regency and Reign of George the Fourth, who not
only shut up the grounds, but enclosed them, where they were open to a
road, with higher fences than even the outside passengers of
stage-coaches could look over, that he might be invisible in his punt,
while fishing on the lake. William the Fourth lowered the fences, and
re-opened the old access.</p>

<p>While George the Third was king, Virginia Water was a very solitary
place. I have been there day after day, without seeing another visitor.
Now it has many visitors. It is a source of great enjoyment to many,
though no longer suitable to Les Reveries d'un Promeneur Solitaire.</p>

<p>A still more solitary spot, which had especial charms for me, was
the deep forest dell already mentioned, on the borders of Winkfield
Plain. This dell, I think, had the name of the Bourne, but I always
called it the Dingle. In the bottom was a watercourse, which was a
stream only in times of continuous rain. Old trees clothed it on both
sides to the summit, and it was a favourite resort of deer. I was a
witness of their banishment from their forest-haunts. The dell itself
remained some time unchanged: but I have not seen it since 1815, when I
frequently visited it in company with Shelley, during his residence at
Bishopgate, on the eastern side of the Park. I do not know what changes
it may have since undergone. Not much, perhaps, being now a portion of
the Park. But many portions of the Park and its vicinity, as well as of
the immediate neighbourhood of Windsor, which were then open to the
public, have ceased to be so, and such may be the case with this. I
have never ventured to acertain the point. In all the portions of the
old forest, which were distributed in private allotments, I know what
to expect. I shrink from the ghosts of my old associations in scenery,
and never, if I can help it, revisit an enclosed locality, with which I
have been familiar in its openness.</p>

<p>Wordsworth would not visit Yarrow, because he feared to disappoint
his imagination:</p>

<pre>
    Be Yarrow stream unseen, unknown!
     It must, or we shall rue it:
    We have a vision of our own.
     Ah! why should we undo it?
    The treasured dreams of times long past.
     We'll keep them, winsome Marrow!
    For then we're there, although 'tis fair.
     'Twill be another Yarrow.
</pre>

<p>Yet, when he afterwards visited it, though it was not what he had
dreamed, he still found it beautiful, and rejoiced in having seen
it:</p>

<pre>
    The vapours linger round the heights:
     They melt, and soon must vanish:
    One hour is theirs, nor more is mine:
     Sad thought which I would banish.
    But that I know, where'er I go.
     Thy genuine image Yarrow!
    Will dwell with me, to heighten joy.
     And cheer my mind in sorrow.
</pre>

<p>He found compensation in the reality, for the difference of the
imagined scene: but there is no such compensation for the
disappointments of memory: and when--in the place of scenes of youth,
where we have wandered under antique trees, through groves and glades,
through bushes and underwood, among fern, and foxglove, and bounding
deer; where, perhaps, every "minutest circumstance of place" has been
not only "as a friend" in itself, but has recalled some association of
early friendship, or youthful love--we can only pass between high
fences along dusty roads, I think it best to avoid the sight of the
reality, and to make the best of cherishing at a distance</p>

<pre>
    The memory of what has been.
     And never more will be.
</pre>

<p>I do not express, or imply, any opinion on the general utility of
enclosures. For the most part, they illustrate the scriptural maxim:
"To him that hath much, much shall be given; and from him that hath
little, shall be taken away even the little he hath." They are, like
most events in this world, "Good to some, bad to others, and
indifferent to the majority." They are good to the landowner, who gets
an addition to his land: they are bad to the poor parishioner, who
loses his rights of common: they are bad to the lover of rural walks,
for whom footpaths are annihilated: they are bad to those, fro whom the
scenes of their youth are blotted from the face of the world. These
last are of no account in ledger balances, which profess to demonstrate
that the loss of the poor is more than counterbalanced by the gain of
the rich; that the aggregate gain is the gain of the community; and
that all matters of taste and feeling are fitly represented by a
cypher. So be it.</p>

<p>George the Fourth's exclusions and high fences had not, however,
effectually secured to him the secrecy he desired. On an eminence
outside of the royal grounds, stood, and still stands, in the midst of
a pine-grove, a tower, which from its form was commonly called the
Clock-case. This tower, and the land round it, had been sold for a
small sum, as a lot in a sale of Crown Lands. The tower was in two or
three stories, and was inhabited by a poor family, who had a telescope,
supplied, most probably, by the new proprietor, on the platform of the
roof, which rose high above the trees, and commanded an extensive view
of the lake. This tower and its grounds became a place of great resort
for pic-nic parties, and visitors of all kinds, who kept up a perpetual
succession at the telescope, while the Royal Angler and his fair
companion were fishing. This became an intolerable nuisance to the
would-be-recluse. He set on foot a negociation for re-purchasing the
Clock-case. The sum demanded was many times the multiple of the
purchase-money. The demand was for some time resisted, but the
proprietor was inflexible. The sum required was paid, the property
reverted to the Crown, and the public were shut out from the Clock-case
and its territory. When William the Fourth succeeded, this story was
told to him, and he said: "A good place for a view, is it? I will put
an old couple into it, and give them a telescope:" which was done
without loss of time. I saw and conversed with this old couple, and
looked through their telescope.</p>

<p>About the same time, William the Fourth was sitting one Sunday
evening in a window of Windsor Castle, when the terrace was thronged
with people.</p>

<p>A heavy rain came on, and the people ran in all directions. He said
to one near him: "This is the strangest thing I ever saw: so many
English people, without an umbrella among them." He was told that, by
order of his late Majesty, umbrellas were prohibited on the terrace.
"Then," he said, "let the prohibition be immediately withdrawn."</p>

<p>In the early days of his reign, he was fond of walking about, not
only in Windsor, but in London. It pleased him to be among the people.
In one of his walks, he noticed, in Windsor Little Park, a board with
an inscription, by which all persons were "ordered" to keep the
footpath. He desired that "requested" might be substituted. He was told
that "requested" would not be attended to. He said: "If they will not
attend to 'requested' that is their affair: I will not have
'ordered.'"</p>

<p>A most good-natured, kind-hearted gentleman was William the Fourth:
but to record the many instances of good feeling in his sayings and
doings, which came within my knowledge, would be foreign to the purpose
of the present paper.</p>

<p>The Act for the enclosure of Windsor Forest contained the following
clause:--</p>

<p>WINDSOR FOREST.</p>

<p>53rd George III. Cap. 158.</p>

<p>LXIV.--And be it further enacted, That from and after the first day
of July one thousand eight hundred and fourteen, all and singular the
Lands, Tenements and Heridaments within the said respective Parishes
and Liberties (save and except such Parts thereof respectively as are
now or shall or may become vested in His Majesty, or any Person or
Persons in Trust for Him by virtue hereof) shall be, and the same is
and are hereby disafforested to all Intents and Purposes whatsoever;
and that from thenceforth no Person or Persons shall be questioned or
liable to any Pain, Penalty or Punishment for hunting, coursing,
killing, destroying or taking any Deer whatsoever within the same, save
and except within such Part or Parts thereof (if any) as shall be
enclosed within Pales and kept for a Park or Parks by the Owners,
Lesees, or Tenants thereof.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt, that the exception in favour of the Crown
was intended to apply to all the provisions of the lause: but it was
held by Counsel learned in law, that it applied to the first half only,
and that, after the specified day, it was lawful to kill deer in any
portion of the old forest, not enclosed with pales, whether such
portion had, or had not, been vested in the Crown. The Crown allotment
had been left as it was. Armed with this opinion, a farmer of Water
Oakley, whose real name I have forgotten in his assumed name, calling
himself Robin Hood, and taking with him two of his men, whom he called
Scarlet and Little John, sallied forth daily into the forest to kill
the king's deer, and returned home every evening, loaded with
spoil.</p>

<p>Lord Harcourt, who was then Deputy Ranger of the Forest, and
discharged all the duties of superintendence (for the Ranger, who was a
Royal Highness, of course did nothing), went forth also, as the
representative of Majesty, to put down these audacious trespassers. In
my forest rambles, I was a witness to some of their altercations: Lord
Harcourt threatening to ruin Robin Hood by process in the Court of
Exchequer; Robin Hood setting him at defiance, flourishing the Act of
Parliament, and saying: "My Lord, if you don't know how to make Acts of
Parliament, I'll teach you."</p>

<p>One day, I was walking towards the Dingle, when I met a man with a
gun, who asked me, if I had seen Robin Hood? I said, I had just seen
him at a little distance, in discussion with Lord Harcourt, who was on
horseback, Robin Hood being on foot. He asked me to point out the
direction, which I did; and in return I asked him, Who he might be? He
told me, he was Scarlet. He was a pleasant-looking man, and seemed as
merry as his original: like one in high enjoyment of sport.</p>

<p>This went on some time. The law was not brought to bear on Robin
Hood, and it was finally determined to settle the matter, by driving
the deer out of the forest into the Park. Two regiments of cavalry were
employed for this purpose, which was kept as secret as possibe, for a
concourse of people would have been a serious impediment to the
operation. I received intelligence of it from a friend at court, who
pointed out to me a good position, from which to view the close of the
proceedings.</p>

<p>My position was on rising ground, covered with trees, and
overlooking an extensive glade. The park was on my left hand: the main
part of the forest on the right and before me. A wide extent of the
park paling had been removed, and rope fencing had been carried to a
great length, at oblique angles from the opening. It was a clear calm
sunny day, and for a time there was a profound silence. This was first
broken by the faint sound of bugles, answering each other's signals
from remote points in the distance: drawing nearer by degrees, and
groing progressively loud. The came two or three straggling deer,
bounding from the trees, and flying through the opening of the park
pales. Then came greater numbers, and ultimately congregated herds: the
beatings of their multitudinous feet mingled with the trampling of the
yet unseen horses, and the full sounds of the bugles. Last appeared the
cavalry, issuing from the woods, and ranging themselves in a
semi-circle, from horn to horn of the rope fencing. The open space was
filled with deer, terrified by the chace, confused by their own
numbers, and rushing in all directions: the greater part through the
park opening: many trying to leap the rope fencing, in which a few were
hurt; and one or two succeeded: escaping to their old haunts, most
probably to furnish Robin Hood with his last venison feast. By degrees,
the mass grew thinner: at last, all had disappeared: the rope fencing
shut up the park for the night: the cavalry rode off towards Windsor:
and all again was silent.</p>

<p>This was, without any exception, the most beautiful sight I ever
witnessed: but I saw it with deep regret: for, with the expulsion of
the deer, the life of the old scenes was gone, and I have always looked
back on that day, as the last day of Windsor Forest.</p>

<h2><a name="s2"></a>Calidore</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<p>NOTWITHSTANDING the great improvements of machinery in this rapidly
improving age, which is so much wiser, better, and happier than all
that went before it, every gentleman is not yet accommodated with the
convenience of a pocket boat.* We may therefore readily imagine that
Miss Ap-Nanny and her sister Ellen, the daughters of the Vicar of
Llanglasrhyd, were not a little astonished in a Sunday evening walk on
the sea shore, when a little skiff, which, by the rapidity of its
motion had attracted their attention while but a speck upon the waves,
ran upon the beach, from which emerged a very handsome young gentleman,
dressed not exactly in the newest fashion, who, after taking down the
sail and hauling up the boat upon the beach, carefully folded it up in
the size of a prayer-book and transferred it to his pocket: after which
he turned himself to the sea, and, scooping up some water in the hollow
of his hand, poured it down again in the manner of a libation, calling
on the names of Neptune and Bromian* Jupiter and Proteus and Triton and
the Nereids. Then turning towards the rocks he spread open his arms and
invoked the Nymphs, the mountains, the rivers, the lakes, the fields,
the springs, the woods, and the sea-shore, by the several appellations
of Oreads, and Naiads, and Limniads, and Limoniads, and Ephydriads, and
Dryads and Hamadryads. He did not notice the young ladies till he had
completed this operation, and when he looked round and discovered them
he seemed a little confused, but made them a very courteous bow in a
fine but rather singular style of ancient politeness. From the moment
of his first landing, and the commencement of the curious process of
folding up his boat, Miss Ap-Nanny had been dying with curiosity, and
had consulted her sister Ellen as to the propriety of addressing the
stranger, having, however, fully made up her mind beforehand as usual
with young ladies when they ask advice.</p>

<p>The stranger spared Ellen the trouble of giving her opinion by
advancing and politely enquiring if there were any such thing as a town
or inn in the neighbourhood? those being things, he said, for which he
was instructed to enquire. Miss Ap-Nanny informed him, in fifty times
as amny words as were necessary, that there was no town within many
miles, but a very good inn for the accommodation of picturesque
tourists, kept by a very polite well-behaved accommodating old woman,
named Gwyneth Owen, whose poor dear husband was gone to Abraham's
bosom. "I hope he will not stay there long," said the stranger, touched
apparently with sympathy by the rueful aspect with which Miss Ap-Nanny
deemed it expedient to pronounce these latter words. The hawk's-eyes of
Miss Ap-Nanny distended with amazement: but she proceeded to point out
the way to the inn, observing at the same time: "You seem to be a
stranger here, sir"--"Perfectly, sweet lady," was the reply, which left
Miss Ap-Nanny's curiosity as unsatisfied as before, though her wide
mouth was pursed up into a smile by the courteous appellative, for she
was not esteemed a beauty in this sinful generation, though she had
eyes like the fish-pools by the gate of Bath-rabbim, and a nose like
the tower of Lebanon which looks towards Damascus.* These prepossessing
features, with the subaddition of two thin colourless lips, like faded
threads of pink silk, set altogether in a complexion of smoky yellow
like the wood of the Barberry-tree, over-shaded with inflexible masses
of coarse copper-coloured hair, and mounted on a neck not perhaps very
unlike the tower which David built for an armoury, formed altogether a
combination of feminine charms that might have warmed the heart of a
Jew, though it was doomed to "waste its sweetness on the desert air"
among the tasteless squires of Cambria.</p>

<p>"Your way to the inn," she pursued, "lies to the left of that rocky
peak; where you will see a narrow path that will bring you into the
public road, where you will first pass by the house of my papa, the
vicar."</p>

<p>This was said to give the stranger a notion of her consequence, but
he astonished her again by asking: "Pray, what is a vicar?"</p>

<p>"A vicar, sir," said Miss Ap-Nanny, "Lord bless me! don't you know
what a vicar is?"</p>

<p>The stranger had too much politeness to press any further enquiry
into a subject which the lady seemed either unable or unwilling to
explain, as to what a vicar might be, and directed his attention to her
companion. All the mild and modest simplicity of Cambrian beauty
concentered its gentle graces in the beautiful Ellen. The soft light of
her dark-brown eyes indicated a rare and happy union of sprightliness
and gentleness: her complexion, delicately fair, was tinged with the
natural roses of serenity and health: her black hair curled gracefully
round her ivory temples, under the becoming Welsh costume of a black
hat and feather: and her symmetrical figure sustained no disadvantage
from the pressure of the sea-breeze upon her drapery.*</p>

<p>Nature had gifted our youth with a very susceptible spirit, and the
contemplation of this beautiful creature fanned the dormant sparks of
his natural combustibility into an instantaneous conflagration. When we
add to this that these were the first unmarried girls he had ever seen,
it will not appear surprising that he with difficulty restrained
himself from falling at the feet of the lovely Ellen, and proffering
himself to her acceptance as her true and devoted knight: but calling
to mind some prudent counsels that had been carefully engraven on the
tablets of his memory, touching the importance of time and place, he
tore himself away with a very polite bow and an inarticulate
valediction; and following the directions of Miss Ap-Nanny, arrived at
the hospitable doors of mine hostess Gwyneth Owen.</p>

<p>The inn was filled with picturesque tourists who had arrived in
various vehicles by the help of those noble quadrupeds who confer so
much dignity on the insignificant biped, that if he venture to travel
without them and rest his reception on his own merits the difference of
his welcome may serve to shew him how much more of his imaginary
importance belongs to his horse than to himself. Our traveller arriving
alone and on foot was received with half a courtesy by the landlady,
and shewn into the common parlour where the incipient cold of the
autumnal evening was dispelled by an immense turf fire, by which were
sitting two elderly gentlemen of the clerical profession, recumbent in
arm chairs, with their eyes half shut, and their legs stretched out so
that the points of their shoes came in contact at the centre of the
fender. Each was smoking his pipe with contemplative gravity. Neither
spoke: nor moved, except now and then as if by mechanism, to fill his
glass from the jug of ale that stood between them on the table, and the
moment this good example was set by one the other followed it
instantaneously and automatically as the two figures at St Dunstan's
strike upon the bell to the great delight of cockneys, amazement of
rustics, and consolation of pickpockets. The stranger made several
attempts to draw them into conversation, but could not succeed in
extracting more than a "Hum!" from either of them. At length one of the
reverend gentlemen, having buzzed the jug, articulated, with slow and
minute emphasis: "Will you join in another jug?"</p>

<p>"Hum!" said the other.</p>

<p>A violent rattling of copper ensued in their respective coat
pockets; two equal quantities of half-pence were deliberately counted
down upon the table; the bell was rung, and the little, round, Welsh
waiting-maid carried out the money, and replenished the jug in silence.
They went on as before till the liquor was exhausted, when it became
the other's turn to ask the question, and the same eventful words,
"Will you join in another jug?" were repeated, with the same ceremonies
and the same results.</p>

<p>Our traveller, in the meanwhile, looked over his tablets of
instruction. These two reverend gentlemen were the Vicar of
Llanglasrhyd and the Rector of Bwlchpenbach. The rector performed
afternoon service at a chapel twenty miles from his rectory, and
Llanglasrhyd lying half-way between them, he slept every Sunday night
under the roof of Gwyneth Owen, where his dearest friend, the Vicar of
Llanglasrhyd, met him to smoke away the evening. They had thus passed
together every Sunday evening for forty years, and during the whole
period had scarcely said ten words to each other beyond the usual forms
of meeting and parting, and "Will you join in another jug?" Yet were
their meetings so interwoven with their habitual comforts that either
would have regarded the loss of the other as the greatest earthly
misfortune that could have befallen him, and would never, perhaps, have
mustered sufficient firmness of voice to address the same question,
"Will you join in another jug?" to any other human being. It may seem
singular to those who have heard the extensive form of Welsh
hospitality that the vicar did not invite the rector to pass these
evenings at his vicarage; but it must be remembered that the Rector of
Bwlchpenbach was every week at Llanglasrhyd in the way of his business,
and that the Vicar of Llanglasrhyd had no business whatever to take him
on any single occasion to Bwlchpenbach; therefore the balance of the
consumption of ale would have been entirely against the vicar, and as
they regularly drank three quarts each at a sitting, or one hundred and
fifty-six quarts in a year, the Rector of Bwlchpenbach would have
consumed in forty years six thousand two hundred and forty quarts of
ale, without equivalent or compensation, at the expense of the Vicar of
Llanglasrhyd, a circumstance not to be thought of without vexation of
spirit.</p>

<p>Our traveller folded up his tablets, rung the bell, and inquired
what he could have for supper, and what wine was to be had? The
landlady entered with a tempting list of articles, and enumerated
several names of wine. The stranger seemed perplexed, and at length
said he would have them all, for he liked to see a well-covered table,
having always been used to one. The landlady dropped a double courtesy,
and the reverend gentlemen dropped their pipes; the pipes broke, and
the odorous embers were scattered on the hearth.</p>

<p>When the supper smoked, and the wine sparkled on the table, the
stranger pressed the reverend gentlemen to join him. They did not
indeed require much pressing, and assisted with great industry in the
demolition of his abundant banquet: but sill not a syllable could he
extract from either of them except that the Vicar of Llanglasrhyd, when
his heart was warmed with Madeira, invited the rector and the young
stranger to breakfast with him the next morning at the vicarage, which
the latter joyfully accepted, as he very well by this time understood
that his lively and jovial companion was the father of the beautiful
creature who had charmed him on the sea-shore. He sate from this time
in contented silence, contemplating the happy meeting of the following
morning while the reverend gentlemen sipped the liquid so far and only
till with their usual felicitous sympathy they vanished at the same
instant under the table. The landlady and her household were summoned
to their assistance. The Vicar of Llanglasrhyd was carried home by the
postillions, and the Rector of Bwlchpenbach was put to bed by the
ostler.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<p>OUR YOUTH was not unmindful of his engagement, and rising betimes,
sent up his compliments to the rector of Bwlchpenbach to know if he was
ready to accompany him to the vicarage. The ostler, by dint of knoching
a the door and shouting "Ho! ho! ho! your reverence!" succeeded in
waking the reluctant rector, and in extracting a response very oracular
in its brevity, the purport of which was that he was too queasy to
rise. The stranger therefore proceeded to the vicarage without him,
where he found the lovely Ellen in the parlour alone, to whom he found
himself under the awkward necessity of explaining that he came to
breakfast by the vicar's invitation; for the vicar had been carried
home in a state of profound sleep, and had continued in the same state
sans intermission, so that his family necessarily remained in profound
ignorance of his appointment. Ellen ran upstaies and knocked at her
father's door to announce the starnger's arrival, but he vicar
sympathised in queasiness with his friend the rector, and murmured an
injuction to his wife and daughters to do the honours of the house.
Miss Ap-Nanny, hearing her sister's communication, skipped down stairs
by three steps at a time, determined not to let the stranger escape
again without gratifying her curiosity about himself and his baot. Mrs
Ap-Nanny, a grave and solemn matron, as silent as her husband, next
made her appearance, and the beautiful hands of Ellen prepared the
tea.</p>

<p>"Ellen, my dear," said Miss Ap-Nanny, "perhaps Mr--I beg the
gentleman's pardon, I have not the pleasure of knowing his name."</p>

<p>"My name," said the stranger, "is Calidore."</p>

<p>"A foreign name, I presume," said Miss Ap-Nanny.</p>

<p>"Probably," said the stranger.</p>

<p>"But, dear me, sir, surely you must know something about your own
name!"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Calidore, stealing glances all the while at Ellen,
and perfectly distrait.</p>

<p>"Allow me to hand you some toast: you must have had a very pleasant
sail yesterday."</p>

<p>"Very pleasant!"</p>

<p>"Did you come far?"</p>

<p>"Very far."</p>

<p>"From Ireland perhaps."</p>

<p>"Not from Ireland."</p>

<p>"Then you must have come a long way in such a small boat, such a
very small boat."</p>

<p>"Not so very small: it is one of our best sea boats."</p>

<p>"Do you carry your best sea boats in your waistcoat pockets? Then I
suppose in your great-coat pockets you carry your ships of the
line!--But, dear me, sir, you must come from a very strange place."</p>

<p>"I come from a part of the world which is known to the rest by the
name of Terra Incognita. I am not at liberty to say more concerning
it."</p>

<p>"But, sir, if it is a fair question, what has brought you to
Wales?"</p>

<p>"I have landed on this shore by accident. My present destination is
London. I am to remain in this island twelve months, and return with a
wife and a philosopher."</p>

<p>"God bless me! what can Terra Incognita want with a philosopher, and
how are you to take them away?"</p>

<p>"In the same boat that brought me."</p>

<p>"Why, who do you think will trust herself? You would like some more
tea?--Ellen, my dear, do you think any lady would trust herself?"</p>

<p>"If she had love enough," said Ellen.</p>

<p>"Cream and sugar?" said Miss Ap-Nanny.</p>

<p>"The boat is perfectly safe," said the stranger, looking at Ellen.
"I could go through a hurricane with it."</p>

<p>"Love, to be sure, will do anything," said Miss Ap-Nanny, "but, Lord
bless me! Pray take an egg; and to be sure it would be worth some risk
just in the way of curiosity to see Terra Incognita. They must be very
strange people, but what they can want of a philosopher I cannot
imagine. I hope if you bring him this way you will keep him muzzled,
for my papa says they are very terrible monsters, fiends of darkness
and imps of the devil. I would not trust myself in a boat with one for
the world. Would you, Ellen, my dear?"</p>

<p>"I should not be much afraid," said Ellen, smiling, "if he were in
the hands of a safe keeper."</p>

<p>"We have a philosopher or two among us already," said the stranger,
"and they are by no means such formidable animals as you seem to
suppose."</p>

<p>"But my papa says so," said Miss Ap-Nanny.</p>

<p>"I bow acquiescence," said the stranger, "but perhaps the Welsh
variety is a peculiarly fierce breed."</p>

<p>"I am happy to say there is not one in all Wales," said Miss
Ap-Nanny.</p>

<p>"I hear they run tame in London," said Ellen.</p>

<p>"Then you are not so much afraid of them as your sister, said the
stranger.</p>

<p>"Not quite," said Ellen, smiling again, "I think I would venture
into the same room with one even if he were not in an iron cage."</p>

<p>"Oh, fie, Ellen," said Miss Ap-Nanny, "that is what you call having
liberal opinions. I cannot imagine where you got them. I am sure you
did not learn them from me. Do you know, sir, Ellen is very heterodox.
My papa actually detected her in the fact of reading a wicked book
called Principles of Moral Science, which, with his usual sweet temper,
he put, without saying a word, behind the fire. He says liberal
opinions are only another name for impiety."</p>

<p>"Dear, good man!" said Mrs Ap-Nanny, opening her mouth for the first
time, "he never was guilty of a liberal opinion in the course of his
life."</p>

<p>Mrs Ap-Nanny left the room shortly after breakfast to superintend
the affairs of the household; and Miss Ap-Nanny, who was her secreatry
of state for the culinary department, was called out to assist in
consultation whether leek porridge or buttered ale should be
administered to the queasy vicar: for, though the old gentleman
preferred the latter, Mrs Ap-Nanny was of opinion that the former was
more medicinal, and the vicar was one of that numerous class of
Benedicts* of whom their wives take so much care in their
indispositions, that they are never suffered to consult their own
tastes in any of the essential practice of the science of dietetics. On
this occasion, however, the vicar was roused to exertion, and was so
Athanasian* in his invectives against the leek porridge, and so
Jeremitaylorically* pathetic in his entreaties for the buttered ale,
that the heart of Mrs Ap-Nanny was softened, and the ale was prepared
accordingly.</p>

<p>Whether it was owing to the exertion he had used in obtaining the
ale, or to the ale itself, or to both in conjunction, we are not
prepared to say, but the vicar found himself suddenly better, rose,
dressed and descended. Opening the parlour-door, he recoiled several
paces in amazement to see the stranger on his knees before his daughter
Ellen, in the act of making passionate love, and Ellen, in the
simplicity of her heart, listening to him with interested if not
delighted attention.</p>

<p>"Heyday!" exclaimed the vicar, who was destined this morning to
exert his energies more than he had done for twenty years, "Why, what
on earth--? Is this your return for my old Welsh hospitality, to begin
by seducing my daughter, the staff of my life now that I am stricken in
Years?"</p>

<p>"I assure you, sir," said Calidore, "I have none but the most
honourable motives."</p>

<p>"How can that be, sir, when you never saw her before this
morning?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir, I beg your pardon. I saw her yesterday."</p>

<p>"Oho! then you came here by appointment, and this was the scheme
between you to lay a trap for my sobriety, and make me an accomplice.
And now I recollect, I do not recollect that I gave you an invitation,
as you want to make me to believe I did."</p>

<p>"Nay, sir, your friend the rector can witness it."</p>

<p>"Sir, what can a young man of your figure--you look like a
courtier--mean by making love at first sight to my daughter? What can
you mean, sir? Perhaps you have heard that she will have a thousand
pounds, and that may be a temptation."</p>

<p>"Money," said the stranger, "is to me mere chaff." And producing a
bag from his pocket, and shaking it by one corner, he scattered on the
floor a profusion of gold. The Vicar, who had seen nothing but paper
money for twenty years, was astonished at these yellow apparitions, and
picking up one inspected it with great curiosity. On one side was the
phenomenon of a crowned head with a handsome and intelligent face, and
the legend ARTHURUS REX. On the reverse, a lion sleeping at Neptune's
feet, and the legend REDIBO.</p>

<p>"Here is a foreign potentate," said the Reverend Dr Ap-Nanny, "whom
I never remember to have heard of. Pray, is he legitimate by the grace
of God, or a blasphemous and seditious usurper whom the people have had
the impudence to choose for themselves?"</p>

<p>"He is very legitimate, and has an older title than any other being
in the world."</p>

<p>"Then I reverence him," said the Vicar. "Old Authority, sir, old
Authority, there is nothing like old Authority. But what do you want
with my daughter?"</p>

<p>"Candidly, sir," said the stranger, "I am on a quest for a wife, and
am so far inspired by the grace of Venus, Cupid, and Juno, that I am
willing my quest should end where it begins--here."</p>

<p>"On a quest!" exclaimed the Vicar; "Venus, Cupid, and Juno! Ah! I
see how it is. Rich, humoured, and touched in the head. Pray, what do
you mean by Juno?"</p>

<p>"Juno Pronuba, said the stranger, the goddess of marriage."</p>

<p>"I see, sir, you are inclined to make a joke of both me and my
daughter. Sir, I must tell you this very unbecoming levity."</p>

<p>"My dear sir, I assure you."</p>

<p>"Sir, it is palpable. Would any man make a serious proposal to a man
of my cloth for his daughter, and talk to him of the grace of Venus and
Cupid and Juno Pronuba, the goddess of marriage?"</p>

<p>"I swear to you, sir," said the stranger, earnestly, "by the sacred
head of Pan."</p>

<p>"Pan!" exclaimed the vicar. "Sir! this is most outrageous. Ellen, my
love, fetch me another mug of buttered ale, for my exertions exhaust
me."</p>

<p>Ellen disappeared, glad of momentary relief, for she had been
sitting in a state of extreme embarrassment, with her hands crossed on
her lap, and her looks fixed on the carpet. The vicar threw himself
into his great arm-chair, and fanned himself with his handkerchief. The
stranger stood silently watching the door for the reappearance of
Ellen, who shortly returned with the mug, which the vicar, taking,
presented to the stranger, saying: "Come, sir. My wrath, which was
great, must not make me unmindful of old Welsh hospitality."</p>

<p>Calidore took the mug, and sipped it to please the vicar, having
first poured a small quantity of it on the floor, saying: "Hilethi,
Bacche!"*</p>

<p>"Really, sir," said the vicar, after a copious draught,--"this is
most monstrous and most incomprehensible. I wax warm, sir, in
wrath."</p>

<p>The truth was that the vicar was really angry with the stranger's
words and actions, but as often as he cast his eyes on the golden
shower on the floor he felt his wrath suddenly mollified But having
broken the ice of his voice he went on like a general thaw, to the
great amazement of Ellen, as well as of Mrs and Miss Ap-Nanny, who,
hearing the unusual rimbombo of his gutturonasal eloquence, burst into
the room to ascertain what was the matter.</p>

<p>"I declare," said Mrs Ap-Nanny, "here is the floor covered with
money."</p>

<p>"I declare," said Miss Ap-Nanny, "here is papa in a passion."</p>

<p>"I am so," said the vicar, "and with very orthodox reason. I am in a
great and very exceeding passion. I found this young man in the act of
seducing Ellen--"</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, dear papa," said Ellen deprecatingly.</p>

<p>"Oh! the monster!" said Miss Ap-Nanny.</p>

<p>"Oh! horrid!" said Mrs Ap-Nanny.</p>

<p>"And with this gold, I suppose," said Miss Ap-Nanny. "Did he throw
all this gold on the floor?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the vicar: "he throws everything on the floor: he threw
himself on the floor: he threw his money on the floor: he threw my
buttered ale on the floor."</p>

<p>"And greased the carpet, I protest!" screamed Mrs Ap-Nanny.</p>

<p>"And had the impudence to talk to me about Bacchus," continued the
vicar; "and called Pan to witness that he wanted to marry my daughter
by the grace of Venus and Cupid and Juno Pronuba, the goddess of
marriage: which I think composes altogether the most atrocious outrage
that was ever offered to a man of my cloth."</p>

<p>"I am so inexperienced in the manners of this country," said
Calidore, "that I did not know that the greatest outrage one gentleman
can offer to another is to propose to marry his daughter. I should have
acted with more circumspection if I had been aware of this fact."</p>

<p>"Sir," said the vicar, "there is no such fact but in your own head,
which seems to be a repository for every thing that is nowhere else,
and for nothing that is elsewhere. Sir, the vial of my wrath
overflows."</p>

<p>"Jupiter knows," said the stranger.</p>

<p>"Jupiter!" said the vicar. "Do you take my daughter for Dana', that
you come courting with a shower of gold? Rally sir, I must say--"</p>

<p>"Certainly," interrupted Miss Ap-Nanny, "it is a most extraordinary
proceeding for a gentleman to land one evening on a strange coast, and
begin the next morning by making love to one of the two first pretty
girls he sees. But Ellen knows better than to listen to such a fly-away
offer. Don't you, Ellen, my dear?"--Ellen was silent.--"Why, bless me,
the girl is bewitched. What can you have done to her, you wicked
wretch, to bewitch her so completely in such a short space of time?"
And combining this idea of Ellen's bewitchment with those of the gold
and the pocket-boat, the conviction flashed upon her that the stranger
was one who had sold himself to the devil; and unable in her sudden
panic to give utterance to the idea, she fell back in a chair kicking
and screaming in a fit of violent hysterics.</p>

<p>"Water! water!" cried the vicar, and in his hurry and alarm poured
over her forehead the remainder of his buttered ale.</p>

<p>Ellen slipped away in the confusion, sent in the servant with the
water, and made her escape into the garden. The stranger snatched his
opportunity and pursued her, while Dr and Mrs Ap-Nanny were engrossed
with the fainting spinster. Calidore, after a few detours among the
thick shades of the garden, found Ellen by the banks of a little
torrent, that flung itself in rapid descent down a sloping hollow of
rock. She was sitting on a rustic bench under a trellis wreathed with
clematis, which she had planted and reared. Calidore threw himself at
her feet. Ellen was exceedingly discomposed. Her acquaintance with the
youth of the other sex had been limited to the jolly squires and
hunting parsons of Cambria, and a young and handsome stranger, kneeling
at her feet, and breathing passionate love, made a very dazzling
impression on her inexperienced and susceptible mind. Calidore, on the
other hand, who had come to England on a quest for a wife, had been
prepared to fall in love at a moment's notice, and being thus prepared
on both sides the ignition was easy and the combustion rapid. Ellen
however, could not feel perfectly convinced that she had really made so
sudden a conquest; nor, if she had been so convinced, could she have
supposed that a flame so lightly kindled would not be as easily
destroyed. She therefore, as usual on similar occasions, assured the
enamoured youth that she had no other attachments; that if he were what
he appeared to be she might in time feel kindly disposed towards him;
entreated him to take a little time to ascertain if his momentary
partiality were likely to continue permanent; exhorted him to proceed
to London, as that was his destination, and assured him that if he
revisited that part of Wales she should be happy to see him again.
Calidore* could not but acquiesce in the propriety of all she said:
and, encouraged by these sweet words, and by much sweeter looks, he
tore himself away from the garden of the vicarage, returned to the inn,
threw himself into a post-chaise, and set forward for the metropolis.
We shall leave him to enjoy the music of hoofs and wheels, while we
give some account of his birth, parentage and education.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<p>KING ARTHUR, after the fatal battle in which so many of his knights
perished, and he himself was dangerously wounded by the traitor
Mordred, was conveyed by the Ladies or Nymphs of the waters on board a
small vessel, which made from the land in the sight of Duke Lukyon of
Gloster. Fatigue and exhaustion overcame the pain of his wound, and he
fell into a deep sleep. When he awoke, under the midnight moon, he
found himself miraculously well. Merlin was standing by him on the deck
with a small bottle. He had just poured from it a few drops upon
Arthur's wound, which had healed immediately. Looking round, the king
found himself in the midst of familiar faces. He recognised his dear
Guenever, and her dear friend Sir Launcelot, and Sir Cawline and his
lady, and Sir Gawaine and Sir Kay and many other valiant and courteous
knights and ladies bright of blee, and last not least in love his
butler Bedevere.</p>

<p>"Honest Bedevere," said King Arthur, "if there be anything in this
vessel analogous to a buttery and a cellar, do thy office and let us
eat and drink. This is a merry meeting indeed, for I thought we were
all dead."</p>

<p>"The will of fate," said Merlin, "seconded by my art and this vital
elixir, has wrought this effect. You must forsake your kingdom for the
present, but you shall return to it by-and-by with a numerous chivalry,
and reign glorious and victorious in Britain. Meanwhile we must live in
a solitary island, in a sea hitherto unexplored, where we must enjoy
ourselves as well as we can till the fated hour of your return."</p>

<p>"Very well," said King Arthur; "and for the present, illuminate
Bedevere with your art, to assist him in procuring us a supper, for
none of us has eaten anything since we were killed."</p>

<p>Merlin led the whole party to the cabin, where they feasted joyously
till sunrise, and continued to live a very merry life during the whole
of their voyage.</p>

<p>When they approached the destined island they were delighted to
perceive that its aspect presented a most promising diversity of
mountain, valley, and forest reposing in the sunshine of a delicious
climate. Two very singular persons were walking on the seashore; one in
the appearance a young and handsome man with a crown of vine-leaves on
his head; the other a wild and singular figure in a fine state of
picturesque roughness with goat's horns and feet and a laughing face.
As the vessel fixed its keel in the shore and King Arthur and his party
landed, the two strangers approached and inquired who they were, and
whence they came?--This, replied Merlin, is the great King Arthur; this
is his fair queen, Guenevere: and I am the potent Merlin: these are the
illustrious knights of the round table: and this is the King's butler,
Bedevere. The butler, said the first stranger, shall be welcome. And so
shall the ladies, said the second. But as to the rest of you, pursued
the first, we must know you a little better before we accord you our
permission to advance a step in this island. I am Bacchus, and I, said
the other, am Pan. So, said Sir Launcelot, I find we have to contend
with the evil powers. If you mean us by that appellation, said Bacchus,
you will find us too strong for you. This island is the retreat of all
the gods and goddesses, genii and nymphs, who formerly reigned in
Olympus, and dwelt in the mountains and valleys of Greece and Italy.
Though we had not much need of mankind, we had a great affection for
them, and lived among them on good terms and in an interchange of kind
offices. They regaled us with the odours of sacrifice, built us
magnificent temples, and especially showed their piety by singing and
dancing, and being always social and cheerful, and full of pleasure and
life, which is the most gratifying appearance that man can present to
the gods. But after a certain time they began to change most lamentably
for the worse. They discontinued their sacrifices; they broke our
images, many of which we had sate for ourselves; they called us
frightful and cacophonous names--Beelzebub and Amaimon and Astaroth:
they plundered and demolished our temples, and built ugly structures on
their ruins, where, instead of dancing and rejoicing as they had been
used to do, and delighting us with spectacles of human happiness, they
were eternally sighing and groaning, and beating their breasts, and
dropping their lower jaws, and turning up the whites of their eyes, and
cursing each other and all mankind, and chaunting such dismal staves
that we shut our eyes and ears, and, flying from our favourite
terrestrial scenes, assembled in a body among the clouds of Olympus.
Here we held a council as to what was to be done for the amendment of
these perverted mortals; but Jupiter informed us that necessity, his
mistress, and that of the world, compelled him to acquiesce for a time
in this condition of things, that mankind, who had never been good for
a great deal, were now become so worthless, and withal so disagreeable,
that the wisest course we could adopt would be to leave them to
themselves and retire to an undisturbed island for which he had
stipulated with the fates. Here, then, we are, and have been for ages.
That mountain on which the white clouds are resting is now Mount
Olympus, and there dwell Jupiter and the Olympian deities. In these
forests and valleys reside Pan and Silenus, the Fauns and the Satyrs,
and the small nymphs and genii. I divide my time between the two, for
though my home is Olympus, I have a most special friendship for Pan.
Now I have only this to say, that if you come here to make frightful
faces, chaunt long tunes, and curse each other through the nose, I give
you fair warning to depart in peace: if not, we shall find no trouble
in expelling you by force, as Jupiter will testify to you. Jupiter gave
the required testification by a peal of thunder from Olympus.</p>

<p>Merlin and King Arthur fell on their knees, and the rest of their
party followed the example.</p>

<p>"Great Bacchus and mighty Pan," said Merlin, "pity our ignorance and
take us under your protection, for if you banish us from this happy
shore, our vessel must wander over the seas for ever, like the Flying
Dutchman that is to be, and we are very ill victualled for such a
navigation."</p>

<p>"Speak," said Bacchus.</p>

<pre>
Will you drink, and join with me
In midnight feast and revelry.
And songs whose notes shall take their pace
From an Olympic chariot-race.
Till Echo from our social mirth
Shall learn there still are souls on earth.
And with her hundred tongues repeat
The tale to Jove's own mountain seat?"
</pre>

<p>"That will we," exclaimed King Arthur and Merlin.</p>

<p>"That will we," shouted the knights of the round table.</p>

<p>"That will we," vociferated the butler, with a voice like the voice
of three.</p>

<p>"Speak," said Pan.</p>

<pre>
"Will ye dance and bound with me
At evening round the old oak tree
Or round the tall and tufted pine.
With woodbine wreathed and eglantine.
While Fauns shall pipe, and wood nymphs sweet.
The cymbals clash, the timbrels beat;
Knights and damsels fair and free.
Will ye join these sports with me?"
</pre>

<p>"That will we," exclaimed the ladies of King Arthur's court.</p>

<p>"That will we," exclaimed the king and the knights and Merlin and
the butler.</p>

<p>"Rise, then," said Bacchus: "rise, then," said Fan, courteously
assisting the ladies.</p>

<p>Mercury came flying from the clouds on Olympus and presently
alighted among them. "I come," said he, "to propose a treaty of holy
alliance between the powers of Olympus and those of Fairyland. What
says Merlin?"</p>

<p>"It is my dearest wish," said Merlin.</p>

<p>"Then stretch forth your wand."--Merlin stretched forth his wand:
Bacchus touched it with his thyrsus: a vessel immediately appeared in
the offing, from which landed Oberon and Titania, and the whole of the
fairy court. Pan blew his horn, and a chorus of Fauns, Satyrs, Nymphs
and Genii came dancing from the woods. Apollo and Venus came down from
Olympus. The happy alliance was concluded immediately. Oberon raised on
the spot a palace for King Arthur. Bacchus made a fountain of wine
spring up in the hall and gave it in charge to the butler Bedevere. Pan
spread a sumptuous banquet: and the whole assembly of Gods, Nymphs,
Genii, Fairies, Knights, and Ladies, entered at once into the full
spirit of festal harmony, feasting, singing and dancing till Iris came
down to inform Apollo that the Hours were looking for him, as it was
near the time of sunrise.</p>

<p>It was the virtue of this island that its inhabitants were exempt
from age and mortality: but they did not as a great philosopher has
conjectured that persons similarly circumstanced would do, "cease to
propagate": on the contrary, the ladies deemed themselves bound in
loyalty to raise an army for King Arthur, that when the time should
come for him to revisit his kingdom, he might do so with glory and
power. Merlin assuming (by means of a pure anticipated cognition, as
the transcendentalists express it) the figure of Mr. Malthus, made them
an oration on the evils that might result from a too rapid increase of
population, in an island where no one could die, and where they might
possibly be under the necessity of remaining some ages, expatiating
with great eloquence on the virtue of moral restraint; but his
eloquence was thrown away: les choses alloient leur train:* and one
morning, being thrown into a panic by the squeal of a newborn child,
Merlin called his flying chariot, and waited upon Jupiter to entreat
his interference in checking the impending dangers of a superabundant
population. Jupiter consulted with Juno, and sent Mercury with a
message to Necessity, the Queen of the World. On the return of Mercury,
Jupiter assured Merlin that there should be only three children to a
marriage, and that no marriage should take place before the parties
were twenty years of age: and he might satisfy himself by an easy
calculation that this judicious arrangement would restrain the
population of the island within the capacity of its produce, for a much
longer period of ages than King Arthur and his followers were likely to
inhabit it.</p>

<p>Thus the islanders increased in numbers only by slow and regular
gradations, and lived much the same kind of life as Pindar, in his
tenth Pythian, ascribes to the Hyperboreans, alife eternally
diversified by songs and festal dances, the breathing of pipes and the
resonance of lyres, and banquets of protracted festivity, at which they
bound their hair with golden laurel in honour of Apollo. Our islanders
were less exclusive in their garlands, and forgot neither "the myrtle
of Venus nor Bacchus's vine." Bacchus became so fond of them that he
was almost a stranger in Olympus, and seldom sight of King Arthur; and
in turn the butler Bedevere seldom lost sight of Bacchus.</p>

<p>But, as Ulysses grew weary in the island of Calypso, and cast a
longing look towards the shores of Itbaca, so King Arthur often found
himself much too comfortable where he was, and longed for the time to
come when he should return to his kingdom, and flourish again his good
sword Escalabor. It would sometimes happen, at long and rare intervals,
that there was an odd male child; and as it could not be expected that
this unfortunate person should live without a wife, and be held up as a
solitary and shining example of the beauty of moral restraint, Merlin
deemed it more prudent, when he arrived at the marriageable age, to
provide him with a fairy boat, and send him, under restrictions of
secrecy, to England, to choose a wife for himself. On these occasions
King Arthur enjoined him to examine accurately the state of the
country, that he might judge from his report if there were a good
opening for his return. Merlin took the same opportunity of procuring
all remarkable philosophical books, that he might have an accurate view
of the progress of human knowledge: and the ladies were always most
unmerciful in their commissions for trinkets and jewellery. To detail
the results of all these expeditions would lead us too far from our
present subject. On one occasion King Arthur was informed that England
was at that time governed by a cowardly braggadocio, whom his barons
had just pent up in a little island in the Thames, and were making him
do and say just whatever they pleased.</p>

<p>"They must treat kings with more ceremony mony," said King Arthur,
"before I trust myself among them."</p>

<p>On another occasion he heard tha the people's faces had grown longer
by an inch an a half; that they were always psalm-singing an "seeking
the Lord," and not finding him so readily as they expected, had amused
themselves en attendant with cutting off the king's head, and tha a
French wag had made this epigram on this occasion:--</p>

<p>The English, in their way of managing things.</p>

<p>Dock the tails of their horses, the heads of their kings;</p>

<p>But the French, among whom more politeness prevails.</p>

<p>Let their kings wear their heads and their horses their tails.</p>

<p>"Very facetious indeed," said King Arthur, "but I have a great
aversion to long faces, and have too much regard for my horse's tail to
trust it among them at present."</p>

<p>On another occasion he was told that the people had risen with one
voice against the doctrine of divine right, had turned out a legitimate
fanatical Scotchman, and imported a grave Dutchman, to whom, and his
lawful heirs, they had made over themselves and all their posterity for
ever, and that this they called a glorious revolution.</p>

<p>"I see," said King Arthur, "I bestir myself speedily, or my
legitimacy will stand but a poor chance."</p>

<p>"Wait a little," said Merlin, "and you will see the doctrine of
divine right rise from its ashes in the shape of a plump French
Phoenix, and fatten itself on the blood and treasure of England, to the
great delight and glory of the nation."</p>

<p>Many years now passed by without an odd male child; and they would
have remained in total ignorance of what was passing in the old world
but for an accident which never before had happened on those shores--a
shipwreck.* King Arthur and his knights were leading the midnight
revelry, in company with Bacchus and Pan, in the royal palace, careless
of the roar of the midnight storm; when the butler Bedevere entered and
informed them that a vessel had been cast away on the shore, and only
one person had escaped, whowas soliciting shelter and refreshment.
"Refresh him," said King Arthur, "then bring him in and let us see
him."</p>

<p>"I will soon set him to rights," said Bacchus.</p>

<p>All eyes were fixed on the door, and when Bedevere reopened it the
whole party recoiled in surprise and alarm from the strange apparition
that entered. A thin figure, in a close suit of black, which stuck to
him the closer from being wet through with salt water; a face
artificially stretched into preposterous elongation; eyes of which
little more than the whites were visible long straight hair that hung
like ends of black rope on each side of a hollow and saffron-coloured
face; compounded altogether such a phaenomenon as none of the party had
ever before seen or imagined. The apparition paused on the threshold,
and stretching out his hands and spreading his long thin fingers,
exclaimed:-"Satan avaunt! Hast thou spread thy snares for me in the
wilderness? Sons and daughters of Belial! leave your abominations and
lewd meetings and revelries, and fall on your knees and humble
yourselves before the Lord with fasting and mortification and godly
groans."</p>

<p>"Leave your grimaces," said King Arthur, "and eat, drink, and be
merry."</p>

<p>"If any be merry," said the apparition, "let him sing psalms."</p>

<p>"Drink," said Bacchus. "Here is a cup of Chian for you. I am the
roaring Bacchus."</p>

<p>"Avaut! Beelzebub!" said the spectre. "Tempt me not. Children of
Belial, I say unto you--"</p>

<p>"Stop--" said Arthur--</p>

<p>"Now say what manner of man art thou.</p>

<p>And whither would'st thou rove.</p>

<p>And why hast thou that clouded brow.</p>

<p>And is it for some evil vow</p>

<p>Or for thy lady love?"</p>

<p>"I am one," said the stranger, "whose feet are joyful on the
mountains, for he bringeth good tidings."</p>

<p>"So it should seem," said Sir Launcelot, "by your pleasant
physiognomy."</p>

<p>"I am a missionary of the New Light," pursued the stranger. "The
spirit has moved me to wander and call back the stray sheep, the
heathen and the gentile into the fold of sanctification. But the wind
hath whirled me about, and the sea hath cast me forth among you. You
are the children of Belial, and shall be cast into outer darkness."</p>

<p>"I understand this fellow," said Bacchus. "He is one of same cast as
the old lamenters, whose dismal faces and frightful noises compelled
us, as a mere matter of taste; to forsake the ancient world. Let me
talk to him. You are a missionary of the lew Light."</p>

<p>"Verily I am a chosen vessel."</p>

<p>We are all staunch Heathens here. You would like to convert us?"</p>

<p>"Truly I would baptise you in Jordan, and whitewash your inward
man."</p>

<p>Very well. There is a prophetess who lives just by in a cavern in
the wood. She is an oracle. Convert her, and we will all follow. You
have only to get the best of the argument with her, and your victory is
complete."</p>

<p>"I will buckle on the armour of controversy and beat down Satan
under my feet."</p>

<p>Pan undertook to shew him the way, and conducted him to the cave of
a beautiful wood-nymph, with whom he left him.</p>

<p>A month passed away, and they heard nothing of him, till one night,
while the palace was resounding with the sounds of music and the feet
of the dancers, the wood-nymph appeared among them, followed by the
chosen vessel. It was with difficulty that they recognised him, for he
was in the dress of a Bacchanal; his hair was curling and bound with a
wreath of vine-leaves; his face was round; his eyes sparkled; his right
hand brandished a thyrsus, and in his left he carried a goblet, which
he held out with a significant Bacchic gesture to Bedevere. Bedevere
filled it with wine, and the missionary, advancing to Bacchus, poured a
libation before him and knelt on one knee. Bacchus raised him up,
embraced him with delight and said: "The nymph, I see, had the best of
the argument."</p>

<p>"She has converted me, I confess," said the missionary.</p>

<p>"By what process of logic," said Bacchus, "we will not enquire too
closely."</p>

<p>The proselyte smiled: the nymph blushed, and, taking him by the
hand, led him into the mazes of the dance, where he frolicked the
gayest of the gay.</p>

<p>"I protest," said Queen Guenever, "he is really handsome fellow. Who
would have thought it?" Such is the difference," said Bacchus, "between
cheerful and gloomy creeds. Cheerfulness is the great source and
fountain of beauty: but the ugliest object in nature is a human visage
distorted by a fanatical faith."</p>

<p>King Arthur learned from this new-comer that all Europe was in an
uproar; that the swinish multitude had broken loose, and was playing a
cup and ball with sceptres and crowns. "Well," said King Arthur to
Merlin, "what say you now?"</p>

<p>"I say," said Merlin, "as I have always said:--'Patience!'"</p>

<p>"You have said so," said King Arthur, "any time these thousand
years."</p>

<p>"But you see very clearly," said Merlin, "things are continually
getting better."</p>

<p>"I maintain," said King Arthur, "they are continually getting worse:
for I am certain that though in my time there wer in Britain many
monsters 'whom I and my good knights did slay,' there were no such
monsters as these chosen vessels, of whom it seems there are swarms in
that country now."</p>

<p>"That is an oscillation," said Merlin, "an accidental variation, or,
to speak more correctly, a secular moral equation, as I will prove--;"
and Merlin being a perfectibilian and King Arthur a deteriorationist,
they immediately lapsed into an argument on a point which they had
argued for a thousand years, and were of the same opinions still.</p>

<p>The chosen vessel became a new light among the Gentiles, and an
especial darling of Bacchus and Pan. The first-fruit of his theological
controversy with the wood-nymph was our hero Calidore: and the year
which placed Calidore on the marriageable list, the number of males
exceeding that of females by one, the lot fell on him to set sail in
the fairy-boat and choose a wife for himself in England. He was charged
with the usual commissions from the ladies and Merlin, with this
addition from the latter, that being desirous to understand the
progress of things viva voce from a philosopher, he commissioned him to
bring over, on any terms, the finest philosopher he could buy.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<p>THE FIRST object of Calidore on arriving in London was to change
some of his gold Arthurs into the circulating medium of the country,
and on making inquiry at his hotel, he was directed, for this purpose,
to a spacious stone building with high walls and no windows. Alighting
from his hackney-coach, with a money-box in his hand, he wandered
through a labyrinth of paved courts and spacious rooms filled with
smoky-faced clerks and solid globes of Jews, through some of which he
had great difficulty in forcing his way. After some time, he discovered
the office he wanted, presented his gold, which was duly tried,
weighed, and carefully removed from his sight. The sum was enounced
with very distinct articulation, and a piece of paper was given to him,
with which he was sent to another place.</p>

<p>"How would you like it, sir?" said a little sharp-nosed man with a
quill behind his ear.</p>

<p>"In the circulating medium of this city," said Calidore.</p>

<p>"But I mean, sir, in what portions?"</p>

<p>"In no portions: I wish to have it all at once."</p>

<p>"Thousands, sir? said the little man."</p>

<p>"The specified sum, sir, said Calidore.--The little man put into his
hand several slips of paper."</p>

<p>"Well, sir!" said Calidore, "what am I to do with these?"</p>

<p>"Whatever you please, sir, said the little man, smiling. I wish I
could say as much for myself."</p>

<p>"I am much obliged to you, said Calidore; and I have no doubt you
are an exceedingly facetious and agreeable person; but, at the same
time, if you would have the goodness to direct me where I can receive
my money."</p>

<p>"Sir, said the little man, that is your money."</p>

<p>"This!"</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir; that."</p>

<p>"What would you have?"</p>

<p>"Gold coin, to be sure, said Calidore."</p>

<p>"Gold coin! I am afraid, sir, you are a disaffected man and a
Jacobin, or you would not ask for such a thing, when I have given you
the best money in the world. Pray, sir, look at it--you are a stranger,
perhaps--look at it, sir; that's all."</p>

<p>Calidore looked at one of the pieces of paper, and read aloud: "I
promise to pay to Mr Henry Hare--One Thousand Pounds--John
Figginbotham.--Well, sir; and what have I to do with John
Figginbotham's promise to pay a thousand pounds to Henry Hare?"</p>

<p>"John Figginbotham, sir, having made that promise, and put it upon
that paper, makes that paper worth a thousand pounds."</p>

<p>"To Henry Hare, said Calidore."</p>

<p>"To any one, said the little man. You overlook the words: or bearer.
Now, sir, you are the bearer."</p>

<p>"I understand. John Figginbotham promises to pay me a thousand
pounds."</p>

<p>"Precisely."</p>

<p>"Then, sir, if you will have the goodness to direct me to John
Figginbotham I will thank him to pay me directly."</p>

<p>"But, good God, sir! you mistake the matter."</p>

<p>"Mistake, sir!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir! John Figginbotham does not pay; he only signs. We pay:
we, who are here; I and my chums."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir; then why can you not pay me without all this
circumlocution?"</p>

<p>"Sir, I have paid you."</p>

<p>"How, sir?"</p>

<p>"With those notes, sir."</p>

<p>"Sir, these are promises to pay, made by one Figginbotham. I wish
these promises to be performed. You send me round in a circle from Hare
to Figginbotham, and from Figginbotham to yourself, and I am still as
much in the dark as ever, as to where I am to look for the performance
of their very liberal promises."</p>

<p>"Oh! the performance, sir,--very true sir,--as you say; but, sir,
promises are of two kinds, those which are meant to be performed, and
those which are not, the latter being forms used for convenience and
dispatch of business."</p>

<p>"Then, sir, these promises are not meant to be performed."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, sir, they are meant to be performed, not literally, but
in a manner. They used to be performed by giving gold to the bearer,
but that having been found peculiarly inconvenient has been laid aside
by Act of Parliament ever since the year Ninety-Seven, and we now pay
paper with paper, which simplifies business exceedingly."</p>

<p>"And pray, sir, do these promises to pay pass for realities among
the people?"</p>

<p>"Certainly they do, sir; one of those slips of paper which you hold
in your hand will purchase the labour of fifty men for a year."</p>

<p>"John Figginbotham must be a person of very great consequence, there
is not much trouble I presume in making one of these things."</p>

<p>"Not much, sir."</p>

<p>"Then I suppose, sir, John Figginbotham has all the labour of the
country under his absolute disposal. Assuredly this Figginbotham must
be a great magician, and profoundly skilled in magic and demonology;
for this is almost more than Merlin could do, to make the eternal
repetition of the same promise pass for its eternal performance, and
exercise unlimited control over the lives and fortunes of a whole
nation, merely by putting his name upon pieces of paper. However,
since, such is the case, I must try to make the best of the matter: but
if I find that these talismans of the great magician Figginbotham do
not act upon the people as you give me to understand they will, I shall
take the liberty of blowing my bugle in his enchanted castle, and in
the meantime, sir, I respectfully take leave of your courtly
presence."</p>

<p>"Poor, deranged gentleman! exclaimed the little man after Calidore
was gone, did you ever hear a man talk so in all your life, Mr
Solomons?"</p>

<p>"Veyry much cracked," said Mr Solomons, "veyry much cracked in the
head; but seems to be sound in the pocket, which is the beyter part of
man."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<p>CALIDORE, finding the talismans of Figginbotham sufficiently
efficacious, proceeded to establish himself in a magnificent house,
engaged numerous servants, purchased an equipage, and lived like an
ambassador. He suffered so much of his object to be known as might
facilitate its accomplishment; and it was soon buzzed about the town,
and significantly told in dashes by the Morning Post, that a stranger
of great consequence was arrived from Terra Incognita, whither he would
shortly return, and take with him from England a wife and a
philosopher; which would be a very good speculation for any unmarried
lady and literary gentleman, as on their arrival in the stranger's
country, the former would receive a most splendid allowance of
pin-money, and the latter would sit down for life as an Honorable
Gentleman Pensioner, with such a pension in his single person as in
this more economical nation would keep in pay two whole gangs of
Legitimate Reviewers. This intelligence threw into a state of complete
fermentation all the disinterested beauty and liberal talent of the
metropolis, and all the seats of the Carlisle mails were engaged every
night for a week in bringing up shoals of embryo laureats and poetical
philosophers from Cumberland.</p>

<p>Calidore,* persuading hiniself that he had already made up his mind
in the choice of a wife, prosecuted with great assiduity his search for
a philosopher, and made diligent enquiry of several eminent
booksellers, and among the rest of the fashionable Mr Macquire.</p>

<p>"A philosopher, sir," said Mr Macquire: "really the article is
rather plentiful the in market, but I have not a sample on hand. A
critic, indeed--I could spare you a fine lively critic on reasonable
terms, as I have several in my pay; but they are all sworn enemies to
the very name of philosophy, and if it be mentioned in their hearing,
one of them faints, another cries, another swears terrible oaths, and a
fourth falls into such a fit of raving that I am obliged to call for a
straight waistcoat. To be sure there is a Mr. Crocodile, the
lay-preacher, who looks in upon me now and then, and talks a great deal
about old philosophy: perhaps he might do, and I should think he would
go cheap: he is woth little to us, and I never could hear that he was
worth anything to any one else: but here is a gentleman who knows more
about these things. Allow me to introduce Mr Index." And he presented
to Calidore* a very smart, lively-looking little man, dressed in the
pink of the fashion.</p>

<p>"Sir," said Mr Index, "I am proud of the opportunity of this
introduction. From the moment I heard of your arrival in London I have
longed for the hour of your acquaintance."</p>
