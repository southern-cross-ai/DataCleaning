<h1>The Heir of Mondolfo</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Mary Shelley</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>In the beautiful and wild country near Sorrento, in the Kingdom of
Naples, at the time it was governed by monarchs of the house of
Anjou, there lived a territorial noble, whose wealth and power
overbalanced that of the neighboring nobles. His castle, itself a
stronghold, was built on a rocky eminence, toppling over the blue and
lovely Mediterranean. The hills around were covered with
ilex-forests, or subdued to the culture of the olive and vine. Under
the sun no spot could be found more favored by nature.</p>

<p>If at eventide you had passed on the placid wave beneath the
castellated rock that bore the name of Mondolfo, you would have
imagined that all happiness and bliss must reside within its walls,
which, thus nestled in beauty, overlooked a scene of such surpassing
loveliness; yet if by chance you saw its lord issue from the portal,
you shrunk from his frowning brow, you wondered what could impress on
his worn cheek the combat of passions. More piteous sight was it to
behold his gentle lady, who, the slave of his unbridled temper, the
patient sufferer of many wrongs, seemed on the point of entering upon
that only repose "where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary
are at rest."1 The Prince Mondolfo had been united early in life to a
princess of the regal family of Sicily. She died in giving birth to a
son. Many years subsequently, after a journey to the northern Italian
states, he returned to his castle, married. The speech of his bride
declared her to be a Florentine. The current tale was that he married
her for love, and then hated her as the hindrance of his ambitious
views. She bore all for the sake of her only child--a child born to
its father's hate; a boy of gallant spirit, brave even to wildness.
As he grew up, he saw with anger the treatment his mother received
from the haughty Prince. He dared come forward as her defender; he
dared oppose his boyish courage to his father's rage: the result was
natural--he became the object of his father's dislike. Indignity was
heaped on him; the vassals were taught to disobey him, the menials to
scorn him, his very brother to despise him as of inferior blood and
birth. Yet the blood of Mondolfo was his; and, though tempered by the
gentle Isabel's more kindly tide, it boiled at the injustice to which
he was a victim. A thousand times he poured forth the overflowings of
his injured spirit in eloquent complaints to his mother. As her
health decayed, he nurtured the project, in case of her death, of
flying his paternal castle, and becoming a wanderer, a soldier of
fortune. He was now thirteen. The Lady Isabel soon, with a mother's
penetration, discovered his secret, and on her death-bed made him
swear not to quit his father's protection until he should have
attained the age of twenty. Her heart bled for the wretchedness that
she foresaw would be his lot; but she looked forward with still
greater horror to the picture her active fancy drew of her son at an
early age wandering forth in despair, alone and helpless, suffering
all the extremities of famine and wretchedness; or, almost worse,
yielding to the temptations that in such a situation would be held
out to him. She extracted this vow, and died satisfied that he would
keep it. Of all the world, she alone knew the worth of her
Ludovico--had penetrated beneath the rough surface, and become
acquainted with the rich store of virtue and affectionate feeling
that lay like unsunned ore in his sensitive heart.</p>

<p>Fernando hated his son. From his earliest boyhood he had felt the
sentiment of aversion, which, far from endeavoring to quell, he
allowed to take deep root, until Ludovico's most innocent action
became a crime, and a system of denial and resistance was introduced
that called forth all of sinister that there was in the youth's
character, and engendered an active spirit of detestation in his
father's mind. Thus Ludovico grew, hated and hating. Brought together
through their common situation, the father and son, lord and vassal,
oppressor and oppressed, the one was continually ready to exert his
power of inflicting evil, the other perpetually on the alert to
resist even the shadow of tyranny. After the death of his mother,
Ludovico's character greatly changed.</p>

<p>The smile that, as the sun, had then often irradiated his
countenance, now never shone; suspicion, irritability, and dogged
resolution, seemed his master-feelings. He dared his father to the
worst, endured that worst, and prevented from flying by his sacred
observance of his vow, nurtured all angry and even revengeful
feelings till the cup of wrath seemed ready to overflow. He was loved
by none, and loving none his good qualities expired, or slept as if
they would never more awaken.</p>

<p>His father had intended him for the Church; and Ludovico, until he
was sixteen, wore the priestly garb. That period past, be cast it
aside, and appeared habited as a cavalier of those days, and in short
words told his parent that he refused to comply with his wishes; that
he should dedicate himself to arms and enterprise. All that followed
this dedaration--menace, imprisonment, and even ignominy--he bore,
but he continued firm; and the haughty Fernando was obliged to submit
his towering will to the firmer will of a stripling. And now, for the
first time, while rage seemed to burst his heart, he felt to its
highest degree the sentiment of hatred; he expressed this
passion--words of contempt and boundless detestation replied; and the
bystanders feared that a personal encounter would ensue. Once
Fernando put his hand on his sword, and the unarmed Ludovico drew in
and collected himself, as if ready to spring and seize the arm that
might be uplifted against him.</p>

<p>Fernando saw and dreaded the mad ferocity his son's eye expressed.
In all personal encounters of this kind the victory rests not with
the strong, but the most fearless. Fernando was not ready to stake
his own life, or even with his own hand to shed his son's blood;
Ludovico, not as aggressor, but in self-defense, was careless of the
consequences of an attack--he would resist to the death; and this
dauntless feeling gave him an ascendency his father felt and could
not forgive.</p>

<p>From this time Fernando's conduct toward his son changed. He no
longer punished, imprisoned, or menaced him. This was usage for a
boy, but the Prince felt that they were man to man, and acted
accordingly. He was the gainer by the change; for he soon acquired
all the ascendency that experience, craft, and a court education,
must naturally give him over a hot-headed youth, who, nerved to
resist all personal violence, neither saw nor understood a more
covert mode of proceeding. Fernando hoped to drive his son to
desperation. He set spies over him, paid the tempters that were to
lead him to crime, and by a continued system of restraint and
miserable thwarting hoped to reduce him to such despair that he would
take refuge in any line of conduct that promised freedom from so
irksome and degrading a slavery. His observance of his vow saved the
youth; and this steadiness of purpose gave him time to read and
understand the motives of the tempters. He saw his father's
master-hand in all, and his heart sickened at the discovery.</p>

<p>He had reached his eighteenth year. The treatment he had endured
and the constant exertion of fortitude and resolution had already
given him the appearance of manhood, He was tall, well made, and
athletic. His person and demeanor were more energetic than graceful,
and his manners were haughty and reserved. He had few
accomplishments, for his father had been at no pains for his
education; feats of horsemanship and arms made up the whole
catalogue. He hated books, as being a part of a priest's insignia; he
was averse to all occupation that brought bodily repose with it. His
complexion was dark--hardship had even rendered it sallow; his eyes,
once soft, now glared with fierceness; his lips, formed to express
tenderness, were now habitually curled in contempt; his dark hair,
clustering in thick curls round his throat, completed the wild but
grand and interesting appearance of his person.</p>

<p>It was winter, and the pleasures of the chase began. Every morning
the huntsmen assembled to attack the wild-boars or stags which the
dogs might arouse in the fastnesses of the Apennines.</p>

<p>This was the only pleasure that Ludovico ever enjoyed. During
these pursuits he felt himself free. Mounted on a noble horse, which
he urged to its full speed, his blood danced in his veins, and his
eyes shone with rapture as he cast his eagle glance to Heaven; with a
smile of ineffable disdain, he passed his false friends or open
tormentors, and gained a solitary precedence in the pursuit.</p>

<p>The plain at the foot of Vesuvius and its neighboring hills was
stripped bare by winter; the full stream rushed impetuously from the
hills; and there was mingled with it the baying of the dogs and the
cries of the hunters; the sea, dark under a lowering sky, made a
melancholy dirge as its waves broke on the shore; Vesuvius groaned
heavily, and the birds answered it by wailing shrieks; a heavy
sirocco hung upon the atmosphere, rendering it damp and cold. This
wind seems at once to excite and depress the human mind: it excites
it to thought, but colors those thoughts, as it does the sky, with
black. Ludovico felt this; but he tried to surmount the natural
feelings with which the ungenial air filled him.</p>

<p>The temperature of the air changed as the day advanced. The
clouded sky spent itself in snow, which fell in abundance; it then
became clear, and sharp frost succeeded. The aspect of earth was
changed. Snow covered the ground and lay on the leafless trees,
sparkling, white, and untrod.</p>

<p>Early in the morning a stag had been roused, and, as he was
coursed along the plain skirting the hills, the hunters went at
speed. All day the chase endured. At length the stag, who from the
beginning had directed his course toward the hills, began to ascend
them, and, with various winclings and evolutions, almost put the
hounds to fault. Day was near its close when Ludovico alone followed
the stag, as it made for the edge of a kind of platform of the
mountain, which, isthmus-like, was connected with the hill by a small
tongue of land, and on three sides was precipitous to the plain
below. Ludovico balanced his spear, and his dogs drew in, expecting
that the despairing animal would there turn to bay. He made one
bound, which conducted him to the very brow of the
precipice--another, and he was seen no more. He sprang downward,
expecting more pity from the rocks beneath than from his human
adversary. Ludovico was fatigued by the chase and angry at the escape
of his prey. He sprang from his horse, tied him to a tree, and sought
a path by which he might safely descend to the plain. Snow covered
and hid the ground, obliterating the usual traces that the flocks or
herds might have left as they descended from their pastures on the
hills to the hamlets beneath; but Ludovico had passed his boyhood
among mountains: while his hunting-spear found sure rest on the
ground, he did not fear, or while a twig afforded him sufficient
support as he held it, he did not doubt to secure his passage; but
the descent was precipitous, and necessary caution obliged him to be
long. The sun approached the horizon, and the glow of its departure
was veiled by swift-rising clouds which the wind blew upward from the
sea--a cold wind, which whirled the snow from its resting-place and
shook it from the trees. Ludovico at length arrived at the foot of
the precipice. The snow reflected and enhanced the twilight, and he
saw four deep marks that must have been made by the deer. The
precipice was high above, and its escape appeared a miracle. It must
have escaped; but those were the only marks it had left. Around lay a
forest of ilex, beset by thick, entangled underwood, and it seemed
impossible that any animal so large as the stag in pursuit could have
broken its way through the apparently impenetrable barrier it
opposed. The desire to find his quarry became almost a passion in the
heart of Ludovico. He walked round to seek for an opening, and at
last found a narrow pathway through the forest, and some few marks
seemed to indicate that the stag must have sought for refuge up the
glen. With a swiftness characteristic even of his prey, Ludovico
rushed up the pathway, and thought not of how far he ran, until,
breathless, he stopped before a cottage that opposed itself to his
further progress. He stopped and looked around. There was something
singularly mournful in the scene. It was not dark, but the shades of
evening seemed to descend from the vast woof of cloud that climbed
the sky from the West. The black and shining leaves of the ilex and
those of the laurel and myrtle underwood were strongly contrasted
with the white snow that lay upon them. A breeze passed among the
boughs, and scattered the drift that fell in flakes, and disturbed by
fits the silence around; or, again, a bird twittered, or flew with
melancholy flap of wing, beneath the trees to its nest in some hollow
trunk. The house seemed desolate; its windows were glassless, and
small heaps of snow lay upon the sills. There was no print of footing
on the equal surface of the path that led right up to the door, yet a
little smoke now and then struggled upward from its chimney, and, on
paying fixed attention, Prince Ludovico thought he heard a voice. He
called, but received no answer. He put his hand on the latch; it
yielded, and he entered. On the floor, strewed with leaves, lay a
person sick and dying; for, though there was a slight motion in the
eyes that showed that life had not yet deserted his throne, the
paleness of the visage was that of death only. It was an aged woman,
and her white hair showed that she descended to no untimely grave.
But a figure knelt beside her which might have been mistaken for the
angel of heaven waiting to receive and guide the departing soul to
eternal rest, but for the sharp agony that was stamped on the
features, and the glazed but earnest gaze of her eye. She was very
young, and beautiful as the star of evening. She had apparently
despoiled herself to bestow warmth on her dying friend, for her arms
and neck were bare but for the quantity of dark and flowing hair that
clustered on her shoulders. She was absorbed in one feeling, that of
watching the change in the sick person. Her cheeks, even her lips,
were pale; her eyes seemed to gaze as if her whole life reigned in
their single perception.</p>

<p>She did not hear Ludovico enter, or, at least, she made no sign
that indicated that she was conscious of it. The sick person
murmured; as she bent her head down to catch the sound, she replied,
in an accent of despair:</p>

<p>"I can get no more leaves, for the snow is on the ground; nor have
I any other earthly thing to place over you."</p>

<p>"Is she cold?" said Ludovico, creeping near, and bending down
beside the afflicted girl.</p>

<p>"Oh, very cold!" she replied, "and there is no help."</p>

<p>Ludovico had gone to the chase in a silken mantle lined with the
choicest furs: he had thrown it off, and left it with his horse that
it might not impede his descent. He hastened from the cottage, he ran
down the lane, and, following the marks of his footsteps, he arrived
where his steed awaited him. He did not again descend by the same
path, reflecting that it might be necessary for him to seek
assistance for the dying woman. He led his horse down the bill by a
circuitous path, and, although he did this with all possible speed,
night closed in, and the glare of the snow alone permitted him to see
the path that he desired to follow. When he arrived at the lane he
saw that the cottage, before so dark, was illuminated, and, as he
approached, he heard the solemn hymn of death as it was chanted by
the priests who filled it. The change had taken place, the soul had
left its mortal mansion, and the deserted ruin was attended with more
of solemnity than had been paid to the mortal struggle. Amid the
crowd of priests Ludovico entered unperceived, and he looked around
for the lovely female he had left She sat, retired from the priests,
on a heap of leaves in a corner of the cottage. Her clasped hands lay
on her knees, her head was bent downward, and every now and then she
wiped away her fast-falling tears with her hair. Ludovico threw his
cloak over her. She looked up, and drew the covering round her, more
to hide her person than for the sake of warmth, and then, again
turning away, was absorbed in her melancholy thoughts.</p>

<p>Ludovico gazed on her in pity. For the first time since his
mother's death, tears filled his eyes, and his softened countenance
beamed with tender sympathy. He said nothing, but he continued to
look on as a wish arose in his mind that he might wipe the tears that
one by one fell from the shrouded eyes of the unfortunate girl. As he
was thus engaged, he heard his name called by one of the attendants
of the castle, and, throwing the few pieces of gold he possessed into
the lap of the sufferer, he suddenly left the cottage, and, joining
the servant who had been in search of him, rode rapidly toward his
home.</p>

<p>As Ludovico rode along, and the first emotions of pity having, as
it were, ceased to throb in his mind, these feelings merged into the
strain of thought in which he habitually indulged, and turned its
course to something new.</p>

<p>"I call myself wretched," he cried--"I, the well-clad and fed, and
this lovely peasant-girl, half famished, parts with her necessary
clothing to cover the dying limbs of her only friend. I also have
lost my only friend, and that is my true misfortune, the cause of all
my real misery--sycophants would assume that name--spies and traitors
usurp that office. I have cast these aside--shaken them from me as
yon bough shakes to earth its incumbrance of snow, not as cold as
their iced hearts, but I am alone--solitude gnaws my heart and makes
me savage--miserable--worthless."</p>

<p>Yet, although he thought in this manner, the heart of Ludovico was
softened by what he had seen, and milder feelings pressed upon him.
He had felt sympathy for one who needed it; he had conferred a
benefit on the necessitous; tenderness molded his lips to a smile,
and the pride of utility gave dignity to the fire of his eye. The
people about him saw the change, and, not meeting with the usual
disdain of his manner, they also became softened, and the alteration
apparent in his character seemed ready to effect as great a
metamorphosis in his external situation. But the time was not come
when this change would become permanent.</p>

<p>On the day that succeeded to this hunt, Prince Fernando removed to
Naples, and commanded his son to accompany him. The residence at
Naples was peculiarly irksome to Ludovico. In the country he enjoyed
comparative freedom. Satisfied that he was in the castle, his father
sometimes forgot him for days together; but it was otherwise here.
Fearful that he should form friends and connections, and knowing that
his commanding figure and peculiar manners excited attention and
often curiosity, he kept him ever in sight; or, if he left him for a
moment, he first made himself sure of the people around him, and left
such of his own confidants whose very presence was venom to the eye
of Ludovico. Add to which, Prince Mondolfo delighted to insult and
browbeat his son in public, and, aware of his deficiencies in the
more elegant accomplishments, he exposed him even to the derision of
his friends. They remained two months at Naples, and then returned to
Mondolfo.</p>

<p>It was spring; the air was genial and spirit-stirring. The white
blossoms of the almond-trees and the pink ones of the peach just
began to be contrasted with the green leaves that shot forth among
them. Ludovico felt little of the exhilarating effects of spring.
Wounded in his heart's core, he asked nature why she painted a
sepulcher; he asked the airs why they fanned the sorrowful and the
dead. He wandered forth to solitude. He rambled down the path that
led to the sea; he sat on the beach, watching the monotonous flow of
the waves; they danced and sparkled; his gloomy thoughts refused to
imbibe cheerfulness from wave or sun.</p>

<p>A form passed near him--a peasant-girl, who balanced a pitcher,
urn-shaped, upon her head; she was meanly clad, but she attracted
Ludovico's regard, and when, having approached the fountain, she took
her pitcher and turned to fill it, he recognized the cottager of the
foregoing winter. She knew him also, and, leaving her occupation, she
approached him and kissed his hand with that irresistible grace that
southern climes seem to instill into the meanest of their
children.</p>

<p>At first she hesitated, and began to thank him in broken accents,
but words came as she spoke, and Ludovico listened to her eloquent
thanks--the first he had heard addressed to him by any human being. A
smile of pleasure stole over his face--a smile whose beauty sank deep
into the gazer's heart. In a minute they were seated on the bank
beside the fountain, and Viola told the story of her poverty-stricken
youth--her orphan lot--the death of her best friend--and it was now
only the benign climate which, in diminishing human wants, made her
appear less wretched than then. She was alone in the world--living in
that desolate cottage--providing for her daily fare with difficulty.
Her pale cheek, the sickly languor that pervaded her manner, gave
evidence of the truth of her words; but she did not weep, she spoke
words of good heart, and it was only when she alluded to the
benefaction of Ludovico that her soft dark eyes swam with tears.</p>

<p>The youth visited her cottage the next day. He rode up the lane,
now grass-grown and scented by violets, which Viola was gathering
from the banks. She presented her nosegay to him. They entered the
cottage together. It was dilapidated and miserable. A few flowers
placed in a broken vase was a type only of poor Viola herself--a
lovely blossom in the midst of utter poverty; and the rose-tree that
shaded the window could only tell that sweet Italy, even in the midst
of wretchedness, spares her natural wealth to adorn her children.</p>

<p>Ludovico made Viola sit down on a bench by the window, and stood
opposite to her, her flowers in his hand, listening. She did not talk
of her poverty, and it would be difficult to recount what was said.
She seemed happy and smiled and spoke with a gleeful voice, which
softened the heart of her friend, so that he almost wept with pity
and admiration. After this, day by day, Ludovico visited the cottage
and bestowed all his time on Viola. He came and talked with her,
gathered violets with her, consoled and advised her, and became
happy. The idea that he was of use to a single human being instilled
joy into his heart; and yet he was wholly unconscious how entirely he
was necessary to the happiness of his prot&eacute;g&eacute;e. He felt
happy beside her, he was delighted to bestow benefits on her, and to
see her profit by them; but he did not think of love, and his mind,
unawakened to passion, reposed from its long pain without a thought
for the future. It was not so with the peasant-girl. She could not
see his eyes bent in gentleness on her, his mouth lighted by its
tender smile, or listen to his voice as he bade her trust in him, for
that he would be father, brother, all to her, without deeply,
passionately loving him. He became the sun of her day, the breath of
her life--her hope, joy, and sole possession. She watched for his
coming, she watched him as he went, and for a long time she was
happy. She would not repine that he replied to her earnest love with
calm affection only--she was a peasant, he a noble--and she could
claim and expect no more; he was a god--she might adore him; and it
were blasphemy to hope for more than a benign acceptation of her
worship.</p>

<p>Prince Mondolfo was soon made aware of Ludovico's visits to the
cottage of the forest, and he did not doubt that Viola had become the
mistress of his son. He did not endeavor to interrupt the connection,
or put any bar to his visits. Ludovico, indeed, enjoyed more liberty
than ever, and his cruel father confined himself alone to the
restricting of him more than ever in money. His policy was apparent:
Ludovico had resisted every temptation of gambling and other modes of
expense thrown in his way. Fernando had long wished to bring his son
to a painful sense of his poverty and dependence, and to oblige him
to seek the necessary funds in such a career as would necessitate his
desertion of the paternal roof. He had wound many snares around the
boy, and all were snapped by his firm but almost unconscious
resistance; but now, without seeking, without expectation, the
occasion came of itself which would lead him to require far more than
his father had at any time allowed him, and now that allowance was
restricted, yet Ludovico did not murmur--and until now he had had
enough.</p>

<p>A long time Fernando abstained from all allusion to the connection
of his son; but one evening, at a banquet, gayety overcame his
caution--a gayety which ever led him to sport with his son's
feelings, and to excite a pain which might repress the smile that his
new state of mind ceased to make frequent visits to his
countenance.</p>

<p>"Here," cried Fernando, as he filled a goblet--"here, Ludovico, is
to the health of your violet-girl!"</p>

<p>and he concluded his speech with some indecorous allusion that
suffused Ludovico's cheek with red. Without replying he arose to
depart.</p>

<p>"And whither are you going, sir?" cried his father. "Take yon cup
to answer my pledge, for, by Bacchus! none that sit at my table shall
pass it uncourteously by."</p>

<p>Ludovico, still standing, filled his cup and raised it as he was
about to speak and retort to his father's speech, but the memory of
his words and the innocence of Viola pressed upon him and filled his
heart almost to bursting. He put down his cup, pushed aside the
people who sought to detain him, and left the castle, and soon the
laughter of the revelers was no more heard by him, though it had
loudly rung and was echoed through the lofty halls. The words of
Fernando had awakened a strange spirit in Ludovico. "Viola! Can she
love me? Do I love her?" The last question was quickly answered.
Passion, suddenly awake, made every artery tingle by its thrill-ing
presence. His cheeks burned and his heart danced with strange
exultation as he hastened toward the cottage, unheeding all but the
universe of sensation that dwelt within him. He reached its door.
Blank and dark the walls rose before him, and the boughs of the wood
waved and sighed over him. Until now he had felt impatience
alone--the sickness of fear--fear of finding a cold return to his
passion's feeling now entered his heart; and, retreating a little
from the cottage, he sat on a bank, and hid his face in his hands,
while passionate tears gushed from his eyes and trickled from between
his fingers. Viola opened the door of her cottage; Ludovico had
failed in his daily visit, and she was unhappy. She looked on the
sky--the sun had set, and Hesperus glowed in the West; the dark
ilex-trees made a deep shade, which was broken by innumerable
fire-flies, which flashed now low on the ground, discovering the
flowers as they slept hushed and closed in night, now high among the
branches, and their light was reflected by the shining leaves of ilex
and laurel. Viola's wandering eye unconsciously selected one and
followed it as it flew, and ever and anon cast aside its veil of
darkness and shed a wide pallor around its own form. At length it
nestled itself in a bower of green leaves formed by a clump of united
laurels and myrtles; and there it stayed, flashing its beautiful
light, which, coming from among the boughs, seemed as if the
brightest star of the heavens had wandered from its course, and,
trembling at its temerity, sat panting on its earthly perch. Ludovico
sat near the laurel--Viola saw him--her breath came quick--she spoke
not--but stepped lightly to him--and looked with such mazed ecstasy
of thought that she felt, nay, almost heard, her heart beat with her
emotion. At length she spoke--she uttered his name, and he looked up
on her gentle face, her beaming eyes and her sylph-like form bent
over him. He forgot his fears, and his hopes were soon confirmed. For
the first time he pressed the trembling lips of Viola, and then tore
himself away to think with rapture and wonder on all that had taken
place.</p>

<p>Ludovico ever acted with energy and promptness. He returned only
to plan with Viola when they might be united. A small chapel in the
Apennines, sequestered and unknown, was selected; a priest was easily
procured from a neighboring convent and easily bribed to silence.
Ludovico led back his bride to the cottage in the forest. There she
continued to reside; for worlds he would not have had her change her
habitation; all his wealth was expended in decorating it; yet his all
only sufliced to render it tolerable. But they were happy. The small
circlet of earth's expanse that held in his Viola was the universe to
her husband. His heart and imagination widened and filled it until it
encompassed all of beautiful, and was inhabited by all of excellent,
this world contains.</p>

<p>She sang to him; he listened, and the notes built around him a
magic bower of delight. He trod the soil of paradise, and its winds
fed his mind to intoxication. The inhabitants of Mondolfo could not
recognize the haughty, resentful Ludovico in the benign and gentle
husband of Viola.</p>

<p>His father's taunts were unheeded, for he did not hear them. He no
longer trod the earth, but, angel-like, sustained by the wings of
love, skimmed over it, so that he felt not its inequalities nor was
touched by its rude obstacles. And Viola, with deep gratitude and
passionate tenderness, repaid his love. She thought of him only,
lived for him, and with unwearied attention kept alive in his mind
the first dream of passion.</p>

<p>Thus nearly two years passed, and a lovely child appeared to bind
the lovers with closer ties, and to fill their humble roof with
smiles and joy.</p>

<p>Ludovico seldom went to Mondolfo; and his father, continuing his
ancient policy, and glad that in his attachment to a peasant-girl he
had relieved his mind from the fear of brilliant connections and able
friends, even dispensed with his attendance when he visited Naples.
Fernando did not suspect that his son had married his low-born
favorite; if he had, his aversion for him would not have withheld him
from resisting so degrading an alliance; and, while his blood flowed
in Ludovico's veins, he would never have avowed offspring who were
contaminated by a peasant's less highly-sprung tide.</p>

<p>Ludovico had nearly completely his twentieth year when his elder
brother died. Prince Mondolfo at that time spent four months at
Naples, endeavoring to bring to a conclusion a treaty of marriage he
had entered into between his heir and the daughter of a noble
Neapolitan house, when this death overthrew his hopes, and he retired
in grief and mourning to his castle. A few weeks of sorrow and reason
restored him to himself. He had loved even this favored eldest son
more as the heir of his name and fortune than as his child; and the
web destroyed that he had woven for him, he quickly began
another.</p>

<p>Ludovico was summoned to his father's presence. Old habit yet
rendered such a summons momentous; but the youth, with a proud smile,
threw off these boyish cares, and stood with a gentle dignity before
his altered parent.</p>

<p>"Ludovico," said the Prince, "four years ago you refused to take a
priest's vows, and then you excited my utmost resentment; now I thank
you for that resistance."</p>

<p>A slight feeling of suspicion crossed Ludovico's mind that his
father was about to cajole him for some evil purpose. Two years
before he would have acted on such a thought, but the habit of
happiness made him unsuspicious. He bent his head gently.</p>

<p>"Ludovico," continued his father, while pride and a wish to
conciliate disturbed his mind and even his countenance, "my son, I
have used you hardly; but that time is now past."</p>

<p>Ludovico gently replied:</p>

<p>"My father, I did not deserve your ill-treatment; I hope I shall
merit your kindness when I know--"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," interrupted Fernando, uneasily, "you do not
understand--you desire to know why--in short, you, Ludovico, are now
all my hope--Olympio is dead--the house of Mondolfo has no support
but you--"</p>

<p>"Pardon me," replied the youth. "Mondolfo is in no danger; you, my
lord, are fully able to support and even to augment its present
dignity."</p>

<p>"You do not understand. Mondolfo has no support but you. I am old,
I feel my age, and these gray hairs announce it to me too glaringly.
There is no collateral branch, and my hope must rest in your
children--"</p>

<p>"My children, my lord!" replied Ludovico. "I have only one; and if
the poor little boy--"</p>

<p>"What folly is this?" cried Fernando, impatiently. "I speak of
your marriage and not--"</p>

<p>"My lord, my wife is ever ready to pay her dutious respects to
you--"</p>

<p>"Your wife, Ludovico! But you speak without thought. How?
Who?"</p>

<p>"The violet-girl, my lord."</p>

<p>A tempest had crossed the countenance of Fernando. That his son,
unknown to him, should have made an unworthy alliance, convulsed
every fiber of his frame, and the lowering of his brows and his
impatient gesture told the intolerable anguish of such a thought. The
last words of Ludovico restored him. It was not his wife that he thus
named--he felt assured that it was not.</p>

<p>He smiled somewhat gloomily, still it was a smile of
satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, "I understand; but you task my patience--you
should not trifle with such a subject or with me. I talk of your
marriage. Now that Olympio is dead, and you are, in his place, heir
of Mondolfo, you may, in his stead, conclude the advantageous, nay,
even princely, alliance I was forming for him."</p>

<p>Ludovico replied with earnestness:</p>

<p>"You are pleased to misunderstand me. I am already married. Two
years ago, while I was still the despised, insulted Ludovico, I
formed this connection, and it will be my pride to show the world
how, in all but birth, my peasant-wife is able to follow the duties
of her distinguished situation."</p>

<p>Fernando was accustomed to command himself. He felt as if stabbed
by a poniard; but he paused till calm and voice returned, and then he
said:</p>

<p>"You have a child?"</p>

<p>"An heir, my lord," replied Ludovico, smiling--for his father's
mildness deceived him--"a lovely, healthy boy."</p>

<p>"They live near here?"</p>

<p>"I can bring them to Mondolfo in an hour's space. Their cottage is
in the forest, about a quarter of a mile east of the convent of Santa
Chiara."</p>

<p>"Enough, Ludovico; you have communicated strange tidings, and I
must consider of them. I will see you again this evening."</p>

<p>Ludovico bowed and disappeared. He hastened to his cottage, and
related all that he remembered or understood of this scene, and bade
Viola prepare to come to the castle at an instant's notice. Viola
trembled; it struck her that all was not so fair as Ludovico
represented; but she hid her fears, and even smiled as her husband
with a kiss hailed his boy as heir of Mondolfo.</p>

<p>Fernando had commanded both look and voice while his son was
within hearing. He had gone to the window of his chamber, and stood
steadily gazing on the drawbridge until Ludovico crossed it and
disappeared. Then, unrestrained, he strode up and down the apartment,
while the roof rang with his impetuous tread. He uttered cries and
curses, and struck his head with his clenched fist. It was long ere
he could think--he felt only, and feeling was torture. The tempest at
length subsided, and he threw himself in his chair. His contracted
brows and frequently-convulsed lips showed how entirely he was
absorbed in consideration. All at first was one frightful whirl; by
degrees, the motion was appeased; his thoughts flowed with greater
calmness; they subsided into one channel whose course he warily
traced until he thought that he saw the result, Hours passed during
this contemplation. When he arose from his chair, as one who had
slept and dreamed uneasily, his brows became by degrees smooth; he
stretched out his arm, and, spreading his hand, cried:</p>

<p>"So it is! and I have vanquished him!"</p>

<p>Evening came, and Ludovico was announced. Fernando feared his son.
He had ever dreaded his determined and fearless mode of action. He
dreaded to encounter the boy's passions with his own, and felt in the
clash that his was not the master-passion. So, subduing all of hate,
revenge, and wrath, he received him with a smile. Ludovico smiled
also; yet there was no similarity in their look: one was a smile of
frankness, joy, and affection--the other the veiled grimace of
smothered malice. Fernando said:</p>

<p>"My son, you have entered lightly into a marriage as if it were a
child's game, but, where principalities and noble blood are at stake,
the loss or gain is too momentous to be trifled with. Silence,
Ludovico! Listen to me, I entreat. You have made a strange marriage
with a peasant, which, though I may acknowledge, I cannot approve,
which must be displeasing to your sovereign, and derogatory to all
who claim alliance with the house of Mondolfo."</p>

<p>Cold dew stood on the forehead of Fernando as he spoke; he paused,
recovered his self-command, and continued:</p>

<p>"It will be difficult to reconcile these discordant interests, and
a moment of rashness might cause us to lose our station, fortune,
everything! Your interests are in my hands. I will be careful of
them. I trust, before the expiration of a very few months, the future
Princess Mondolfo will be received at the court of Naples with due
honor and respect. But you must leave it to me. You must not move in
the affair. You must promise that you will not, until I permit,
mention your marriage to any one, or acknowledge it if you are taxed
with it."</p>

<p>Ludovico, after a moment's hesitation, replied:</p>

<p>"I promise that, for the space of six months, I will not mention
my marriage to any one. I will not be guilty of falsehood, but for
that time I will not affirm it or bring it forward in any manner so
as to annoy you."</p>

<p>Fernando again paused; but prudence conquered, and he said no
more. He entered on other topics with his son; they supped together,
and the mind of Ludovico, now attuned to affection, received all the
marks of his father's awakening love with gratitude and joy. His
father thought that he held him in his toils, and was ready to
sweeten the bitterness of his intended draft by previous
kindness.</p>

<p>A week passed thus in calm. Ludovico and Viola were perfectly
happy. Ludovico only wished to withdraw his wife from obscurity from
that sensation of honest pride which makes us desire to declare to
the whole world the excellence of a beloved object. Viola shrank from
such an exhibition; she loved her humble cottage--humble still though
adorned with all that taste and love could bestow on it. The trees
bent over Its low roof and shaded its windows, which were filled with
flowering shrubs; its floor shone with marble, and vases of antique
shape and exquisite beauty stood in the niches of the room.</p>

<p>Every part was consecrated by the memory of their first meeting
and their loves--the walks in snow and violets; the forest of ilex
with its underwood of myrtle and its population of fire-flies; the
birds; the wild and shy animals that sometimes came in sight, and,
seen, retreated; the changes of the seasons, of the hues of nature
influenced by them; the alterations of the sky; the walk of the moon;
and the moving of the stars--all were dear, known, and commented on
by this pair, who saw the love their own hearts felt reflected in the
whole scene around, and in their child, their noisy but speechless
companion, whose smiles won hopes, and whose bright form seemed as if
sent from Heaven to reward their constant affection.</p>

<p>A week passed, and Fernando and Ludovico were riding together,
when the Prince said:</p>

<p>"Tomorrow, early, my son, you must go to Naples. It is time that
you should show yourself there as my heir, and the best
representative of a princely house. The sooner you do this the
quicker will arrive the period for which, no doubt, you long, when
the unknown Princess Mondolfo will be acknowledged by all. I cannot
accompany you. In fact, circumstances which you may guess make me
desire that you should appear at first without me. You will be
distinguished by your sovereign, courted by all, and you will
remember your promise as the best means of accomplishing your object.
In a very few days I will join you."</p>

<p>Ludovico readily assented to this arrangement, and went the same
evening to take leave of Viola. She was seated beneath the laurel
tree where first they had made their mutual vows; her child was in
her arms, gazing with wonder and laughter on the light of the flies.
Two years had passed. It was summer again, and as the beams from
their eyes met and mingled each drank in the joyous certainty that
they were still as dear to one another as when he, weeping from
intense emotion, sat under that tree. He told her of his visit to
Naples which his father had settled for him, and a cloud passed over
her countenance, but she dismissed it. She would not fear; yet again
and again a thrilling sense of coming evil made her heart beat, and
each time was resisted with greater difficulty. As night came on, she
carried the sleeping child into the cottage, and placed him on his
bed, and then walked up and down the pathway of the forest with
Ludovico until the moment of his departure should arrive, for the
heat of the weather rendered it necessary that he should travel by
night. Again the fear of danger crossed her, and again she with a
smile shook off the thought; but, when he turned to give her his
parting embrace, it returned with full force on her. Weeping
bitterly, she clung to him, and entreated him not to go. Startled by
her earnestness, he eagerly sought an explanation, but the only
explanation she could give excited a gentle smile as he caressed and
bade her to be calm; and then, pointing to the crescent moon that
gleamed through the trees and checkered the ground with their moving
shades, he told her he would be with her ere its full, and with one
more embrace left her weeping. And thus it is a strange prophecy
often creeps about, and the spirit of Cassandra inhabits many a
hapless human heart, and utters from many lips unheeded forebodings
of evils that are to be: the hearers heed them not--the speaker
hardly gives them credit--the evil comes which, if it could have been
avoided, no Cassandra could have foretold, for if that spirit were
not a sure harbinger so would it not exist; nor would these half
revealings have place if the to come did not fulfill and make out the
sketch.</p>

<p>Viola beheld him depart with hopeless sorrow, and then turned to
console herself beside the couch of her child. Yet, gazing on him,
her fears came thicker; and in a transport of terror she rushed from
the cottage, ran along the pathway, calling on Ludovico's name, and
sometimes listening if she might hear the tread of his horse, and
then again shrieking aloud for him to return.</p>

<p>But he was far out of hearing, and she returned again to her cot,
and, lying down beside her child, clasping his little hand in hers,
at length slept peacefully.</p>

<p>Her sleep was light and short. She arose before the sun, and
hardly had he begun to cast long shadows on the ground when, attiring
herself in her veil, she was about to go with the infant to the
neighboring chapel of Santa Chiara, when she heard the trampling of
horses come up the pathway; her heart beat quick, and still quicker
when she saw a stranger enter the cottage. His form was commanding,
and age, which had grizzled his hair, had not tempered the fire of
his eye nor marred the majesty of his carriage; but every lineament
was impressed by pride and even cruelty. Self-will and scorn were
even more apparent. He was somewhat like what Ludovico had been, and
so like what he then was that Viola did not doubt that his father
stood before her. She tried to collect her courage, but the surprise,
his haughty mien, and, above all, the sound of many horses, and the
voices of men who had remained outside the cottage, so disturbed and
distracted her that her heart for a moment failed her, and she leaned
trembling and ashy white against the wall, straining her child to her
heart with convulsive energy. Fernando spoke:</p>

<p>"You are Viola Amaldi, and you call yourself, I believe, the wife
of Ludovico Mandolfo?"</p>

<p>"I am so"--her lips formed themselves to these words, but the
sound died away.</p>

<p>Fernando continued:</p>

<p>"I am Prince Mondolfo, father of the rash boy who has entered into
this illegal and foolish contract. When I heard of it my plan was
easily formed, and I am now about to put it into execution. I could
easily have done so without coming to you, without enduring the scene
which, I suppose, I shall endure; but benevolence has prompted me to
the line of conduct I adopt, and I hope that I shall not repent
it."</p>

<p>Fernando paused; Viola had heard little of what he had said. She
was employed in collecting her scattered spirits, in bidding her
heart be still, and arming herself with the pride and courage of
innocence and helplessness. Every word he spoke was thus of use to
her, as it gave her time to recollect herself. She only bowed her
head as he paused, and he continued:</p>

<p>"While Ludovico was a younger son, and did not seek to obtrude his
misalliance into notice, I was content that he should enjoy what he
termed happiness unmolested; but circumstances have changed. He has
become the heir of Mondolfo, and must support that family and title
by a suitable marriage. Your dream has passed. I mean you no ill. You
will be conducted hence with your child, placed on board a vessel,
and taken to a town in Spain. You will receive a yearly stipend, and,
as long as you seek no communication with Ludovico, or endeavor to
leave the asylum provided for you, you are safe; but the slightest
movement, the merest yearning for a station you may never fill, shall
draw upon you and that boy the vengeance of one whose menaces are but
the uplifted arm--the blow quickly follows!"</p>

<p>The excess of danger that threatened the unprotected Viola gave
her courage. She replied:</p>

<p>"I am alone and feeble, you are strong, and have ruffians waiting
on you to execute such crimes as your imagination suggests. I care
not for Mondolfo, nor the title, nor the possession, but I will
never, oh! never, never! renounce my Ludovico--never do aught to
derogate from our plighted faith. Torn from him, I will seek him,
though it be barefoot and a-hungered, through the wide world. He is
mine by that love be has been pleased to conceive for me; I am his by
the sentiment of devotion and eternal attachment that now animates my
voice. Tear us asunder, yet we shall meet again, and, unless you put
the grave between us, you cannot separate us."</p>

<p>Fernando smiled in scorn.</p>

<p>"And that boy," he said, pointing to die infant, "will you lead
him, innocent lamb, a sacrifice to the altar of your love, and plant
the knife yourself in the victim's heart?"</p>

<p>Again the lips of Viola became pale as she clasped her boy and
exclaimed, in almost inarticulate accents:</p>

<p>"There is a God in Heaven!".Fernando left the cottage, and it was
soon filled by men, one of whom threw a cloak over Viola and her boy,
and, dragging them from the cottage, placed them in a kind of litter,
and the cavalcade proceeded silently. Viola had uttered one shriek
when she beheld her enemies, but, knowing their power and her own
impotence, she stifled all further cries. When in the litter she
strove in vain to disengage herself from the cloak that enveloped
her, and then tried to hush her child, who, frightened at his strange
situation, uttered piercing cries. At length he slept; and Viola,
darkling and fearful, with nothing to sustain her spirits or hopes,
felt her courage vanish.</p>

<p>She wept long with despair and misery. She thought of Ludovico and
what his grief would be, and her tears were redoubled. There was no
hope, for her enemy was relentless, her child torn from her, a
cloister her prison. Such were the images constantly before her. They
subdued her courage, and filled her with terror and dismay.</p>

<p>The cavalcade entered the town of Salerno, and the roar of the sea
announced to poor Viola that they were on its shores.</p>

<p>"O bitter waves!" she cried. "My tears are as bitter as ye, and
they will soon mingle!"</p>

<p>Her conductors now entered a building. It was a watch-tower at
some distance from the town, on the sea-beach. They lifted Viola from
the litter and led her to one of the dreary apartments of the tower.
The window, which was not far from the ground, was grated with iron;
it bore the appearance of a guardroom. The chief of her conductors
addressed her, courteously asked her to excuse the rough lodging; the
wind was contrary, he said, but change was expected, and the next day
he hoped they would be able to embark. He pointed to the destined
vessel in the offing.</p>

<p>Viola, excited to hope by his mildness, began to entreat his
compassion, but he immediately left her. Soon after another man
brought in food, with a flask of wine and a jug of water. He also
retired; her massive door was locked, the sound of retreating
footsteps died away.</p>

<p>Viola did not despair; she felt, however, that it would need all
her courage to extricate herself from her prison. She ate a part of
the food which had been provided, drank some water, and then, a
little refreshed, she spread the cloak her conductors had left on the
floor, placed her child on it to play, and then stationed herself at
the window to see if any one might pass whom she might address, and,
if he were not able to assist her in any other way, he might at least
bear a message to Ludovico, that her fate might not be veiled in the
fearful mystery that threatened it; but probably the way past her
window was guarded, for no one drew near. As she looked, however, and
once advanced her head to gaze more earnestly, it struck her that her
person would pass between the iron grates of her window, which was
not high from the ground. The cloak, fastened to one of the
stanchions, promised a safe descent. She did not dare make the essay;
nay, she was so fearful that she might be watched, and that, if she
were seen near the window, her jailers might be struck with the same
idea, that she retreated to the farther end of the room, and sat
looking at the bars with fluctuating hope and fear, that now dyed her
cheeks with crimson, and again made them pale as when Ludovico had
first seen her.</p>

<p>Her boy passed his time in alternate play and sleep. The ocean
still roared, and the dark clouds brought up by the sirocco blackened
the sky and hastened the coming evening. Hour after hour passed; she,
heard no clock; there was no sun to mark the time, but by degrees the
room grew dark, and at last the Ave Maria tolled, heard by fits
between the howling of the winds and the dashing of the waves. She
knelt, and put up a fervent prayer to the Madonna, protector of
innocence--prayer for herself and her boy--no less innocent than the
Mother and Divine Child, to whom she made her orisons. Still she
paused. Drawing near to the window, she listened for the sound of any
human being: that sound, faint and intermittent, died away, and with
darkness came rain that poured in torrents, accompanied by thunder
and lightning that drove every creature to shelter. Viola shuddered.
Could she expose her child during such a night? Yet again she
gathered courage. It only made her meditate on some plan by which she
might get the cloak as a shelter for her boy after it had served for
their descent. She tried the bars, and found that, with some
difficulty, she could pass, and, gazing downward from the outside, a
flash of lightning revealed the ground not far below. Again she
commended herself to divine protection; again she called upon and
blessed her Ludovico; and then, not fearless but determined, she
began her operations.</p>

<p>She fastened the cloak by means of her long veil, which, hanging
to the ground, was tied by a slip-knot, and gave way when pulled. She
took her child in her arms, and, having got without the bars, bound
him with the sash to her waist, and then, without accident, she
reached the ground.</p>

<p>Having then secured the cloak, and enveloped herself and her child
in its dark and ample folds, she paused breathlessly to listen.
Nature was awake with its loudest voice--the sea roared--and the
incessant flashes of lightning that discovered that solitude around
her were followed by such deafening peals as almost made her fear.
She crossed the field, and kept the sight of the white sea-foam to
her right hand, knowing that she thus proceeded in an opposite
direction from Mondolfo. She walked as fast as her burden permitted
her, keeping the beaten road, for the darkness made her fear to
deviate. The rain ceased, and she walked on, until, her limbs falling
under her, she was fain to rest, and refresh herself with the bread
she had brought with her from the prison. Action and success had
inspired her with unusual energy. She would not fear--she believed
herself free and secure. She wept, but it was the overflowing emotion
that found no other expression. She doubted not that she should
rejoin Ludovico. Seated thus in the dark night--having for hours been
the sport of the elements, which now for an instant paused in their
fury--seated on a stone by the roadside--a wide, dreary, unknown
country about her--her helpless child in her arms--herself having
just finished eating the only food she possessed--she felt triumph,
and joy, and love, descend into her heart, prophetic of future
reunion with her beloved.</p>

<p>It was summer, and the air consequently warm. Her cloak had
protected her from the wet, so her limbs were free and unnumbed. At
the first ray of dawn she arose, and at the nearest pathway she
struck out of the road, and took her course nearer the bordering
Apennines. From Salerno as far south as the eye could reach, a low
plain stretched itself along the seaside, and the hills at about the
distance of ten miles bound it in. These mountains are high and
singularly beautiful in their shape; their crags point to Heaven and
streams flow down their sides and water the plain below. After
several hours' walking, Viola reached a pine forest, which descended
from the heights and stretched itself in the plain. She sought its
friendly shelter with joy, and, penetrating its depths until she saw
trees only on all sides of her, she again reposed. The sirocco had
been dissipated by the thunderstorm, and the sun, vanquishing the
clouds that at first veiled its splendor, glowed forth in the clear
majesty of noon. Southern born, Viola did not fear the heat.</p>

<p>She collected pine nuts, she contrived to make a fire, and ate
them with appetite; and then, seeking a covert, she lay down and
slept, her boy in her arms, thanking Heaven and the Virgin for her
escape. When she awoke, the triumph of her heart somewhat died away.
She felt the solitude, she felt her helplessness, she feared
pursuers, yet she dashed away the tears, and then reflecting that she
was too near Salerno--the sun being now at the sea's verge--she arose
and pursued her way through the intricacies of the wood. She got to
the edge of it so far as to be able to direct her steps by the
neighboring sea. Torrents intercepted her path, and one rapid river
threatened to impede it altogether; but, going somewhat lower down,
she found a bridge; and then, approaching still nearer to the sea,
she passed through a wide and desolate kind of pasture-country, which
seemed to afford neither shelter nor sustenance to any human being.
Night closed in, and she was fearful to pursue her way, but, seeing
some buildings dimly in the distance, she directed her steps thither,
hoping to discover a hamlet where she might get shelter and such
assistance as would enable her to retrace her steps and reach Naples
without being discovered by her powerful enemy. She kept these high
buildings before her, which appeared like vast cathedrals, but that
they were untopped by any dome or spire; and she wondered much what
they could be, when suddenly they disappeared. She would have thought
some rising ground had intercepted them, but all before her was
plain. She paused, and at length resolved to wait for dawn. All day
she had seen no human being; twice or thrice she had heard the bark
of a dog, and once the whistle of a shepherd, but she saw no one.
Desolation was around her; this, indeed, had lulled her into security
at first. Where no men were, there was no danger for her. But at
length the strange solitude became painful-she longed to see a
cottage, or to find some peasant, however uncouth, who might answer
her inquiries and provide for her wants. She had viewed with surprise
the buildings which had been as beacons to her. She did not wish to
enter a large town, and she wondered how one could exist in such a
desert; but she had left the wood far behind her, and required food.
Night passed--balmy and sweet night--the breezes fanned her, the
glowing atmosphere encompassed her, the fire-flies flitted round her,
bats wheeled about in the air, and the heavy-winged owl hooped anigh,
while the beetle's constant hum filled the air. She lay on the
ground, her babe pillowed on her arm, looking upon the starry
heavens. Many thoughts crowded upon her: the thought of Ludovico, of
her reunion with him, of joy after sorrow; and she forgot that she
was alone, half-famished, encompassed by enemies in a desert plain of
Calabria 2--she slept.</p>

<p>She awoke not until the sun had risen high--it had risen above the
temples of Pastum,3 and the columns threw short shadows on the
ground. They were near her, unseen during night, and were now
revealed as the edifices that had attracted her the evening before.
They stood on a rugged plain, despoiled of all roof, their columns
and cornices encompassing a space of high and weed-grown grass; the
deep-blue sky canopied them and filled them with light and
cheerfulness. Viola looked on them with wonder and reverence; they
were temples to some god who still seemed to deify them with his
presence; he clothed them still with beauty, and what was called
their ruin might, in its picturesque wildness and sublime loneliness,
be more adapted to his nature than when, roofed and gilded, they
stood in pristine strength; and the silent worship of air and happy
animals might be more suited to him than the concourse of the busy
and heartless. The most benevolent of spirit-gods seemed to inhabit
that desert, weed-grown area; the spirit of beauty flitted between
those columns embrowned by time, painted with strange color, and
raised a genial atmosphere on the deserted altar. Awe and devotion
filled the heart of lonely Viola; she raised her eyes and heart to
Heaven in thanksgiving and prayer--not that her lips formed words, or
her thoughts suggested connected sentences, but the feeling of
worship and gratitude animated her; and, as the sunlight streamed
through the succession of columns, so--did joy, dove-shaped, fall on
and illumine her soul.</p>

<p>With such devotion as seldom before she had visited a
saint-dedicated church, she ascended the broken and rude steps of the
larger temple, and entered the plot that it in-closed. An inner
circuit of smaller columns formed a smaller area, which she entered,
and, sitting on a huge fragment of the broken cornice that had fallen
to the ground, she silently waited as if for some oracle to visit her
sense and guide her.</p>

<p>Thus sitting, she heard the near bark of a dog, followed by the
bleating of sheep, and she saw a little flock spread itself in the
field adjoining the farther temple. They were shepherded by a girl
clothed in rags, but the season required little covering; and these
poor people, moneyless, possessing only what their soil gives them,
are in the articles of clothing poor even to nakedness.</p>

<p>In inclement weather they wrap rudely-formed clothes of undressed
sheepskin around them--during the heats of summer they do little more
than throw aside these useless garments. The shepherd-girl was
probably about fifteen years of age; a large black straw hat shaded
her head from the intense rays of the sun; her feet and legs were
bare; and her petticoat, tucked up, Diana-like, above one knee, gave
a picturesque appearance to her rags, which, bound at her waist by a
girdle, bore some resemblance to the costume of a Greek maiden. Rags
have a costume of their own, as fine in their way, in their contrast
of rich colors and the uncouth boldness of their drapery, as kingly
robes. Viola approached the shepherdess and quietly entered into
conversation with her; without making any appeal to her charity or
feelings, she asked the name of the place where she was, and her boy,
awake and joyous, soon attracted attention. The shepherd-girl was
pretty, and, above all, good-natured; she caressed the child, seemed
delighted to have found a companion for her solitude, and, when Viola
said that she was hungry, unloaded her scrip of roasted pine nuts,
boiled chestnuts, and coarse bread. Viola ate with joy and gratitude.
They remained together all day; the sun went down, the glowing light
of its setting faded, and the shepherdess would have taken Viola home
with her. But she dreaded a human dwelling, still fearing that,
wherever there appeared a possibility of shelter, there her pursuers
would seek her.</p>

<p>She gave a few small silver-pieces, part of what she had about her
when seized, to her new friend, and, bidding her bring sufficient
food for the next day, entreated her not to mention her adventure to
any one. The girl promised, and, with the assistance of her dog,
drove the flock toward their fold. Viola passed the night within the
area of the larger temple.</p>

<p>Not doubting the success of his plan, on the very evening that
followed its execution, Prince Mondolfo had gone to Naples. He found
his son at the Mondolfo Palace. Despising the state of a court, and
careless of the gaieties around him, Ludovico longed to return to the
cottage of Viola.</p>

<p>So, after the expiration of two days, he told his father that he
should ride over to Mondolfo, and return the following morning.
Fernando did not oppose him, but, two hours after his departure,
followed him, and arrived at the castle just after Ludovico, leaving
his attendants there, quitted it to proceed alone to his cottage. The
first person Prince Mondolfo saw was the chief of the company who had
had the charge of Viola. His story was soon told: the unfavorable
wind, the imprisonment in a room barricaded with the utmost strength,
her incomprehensible escape, and the vain efforts that had
subsequently been made to find her. Fernando listened as if in a
dream; convinced of the truth, he saw no clue to guide him--no hope
of recovering possession of his prisoner. He foamed with rage, then
endeavored to suppress as useless his towering passion. He
overwhelmed the bearer of the news with execrations; sent out parties
of men in pursuit in all directions, promising every reward, and
urging the utmost secrecy, and then, left alone, paced his chamber in
fury and dismay. His solitude was of no long duration. Ludovico burst
into his room, his countenance lighted up with rage.</p>

<p>"Murderer!" he cried. "Where is my Viola?"</p>

<p>Fernando remained speechless.</p>

<p>"Answer!" said Ludovico. "Speak with those lips that pronounced
her death-sentence--or raise against me that hand from which her
blood is scarcely washed--Oh, my Viola! thou and my angel-child,
descend with all thy sweetness into my heart, that this hand write
not parricide on my brow!"</p>

<p>Fernando attempted to speak.</p>

<p>"No!" shrieked the miserable Ludovico; "I will not listen to her
murderer. Yet--is she dead? I kneel--I call you father--I appeal to
that savage heart--I take in peace that hand that often struck me,
and now has dealt the death-blow--oh, tell me, does she yet
live?"</p>

<p>Fernando seized on this interval of calm to relate his story. He
told the simple truth; but could such a tale gain belief? It awakened
the wildest rage in poor Ludovico's heart. He doubted not that Viola
had been murdered; and, after every expression of despair and hatred,
he bade his father seek his heir among the clods of the earth, for
that such he should soon become, and rushed from his presence.</p>

<p>He wandered to the cottage, he searched the country round, he
heard the tale of those who had witnessed any part of the carrying
off of his Viola. He went to Salerno. He heard the tale there told
with the most determined incredulity. It was the tale, he doubted
not, that his father forged to free himself from accusation, and to
throw an impenetrable veil over the destruction of Viola.</p>

<p>His quick imagination made out for itself the scene of her death.
The very house in which she had been confined had at the extremity of
it a tower jutting out over the sea; a river flowed at its base,
making its confluence with the ocean deep and dark. He was convinced
that the fatal scene had been acted there. He mounted the tower; the
higher room was windowless, the iron grates of the windows had for
some cause been recently taken out. He was persuaded that Viola and
her child had been thrown from that window into the deep and gurgling
waters below.</p>

<p>He resolved to die! In those days of simple Catholic faith,
suicide was contemplated with horror. But there were other means
almost as sure. He would go a pilgrim to the Holy Land, and fight and
die beneath the walls of Jerusalem. Rash and energetic, his purpose
was no sooner formed than he hastened to put it in execution. He
procured a pilgrim's weeds at Salerno, and at midnight, advising none
of his intentions, he left that city, and proceeded southward.
Alternate rage and grief swelled his heart. Rage at length died away.
She whose murderer he execrated was an angel in Heaven, looking down
on him, and he in the Holy Land would win his right to join her.
Tender grief dimmed his eyes. The world's great theater closed before
him-of all its trappings his pilgrim's cloak was alone gorgeous, his
pilgrim's staff the only scepter--they were the symbols and signs of
the power he possessed beyond the earth, and the pledges of his union
with Viola. He bent his steps toward Brundusium.4 He walked on fast,
as if he grudged all space and time that lay between him and his
goal. Dawn awakened the earth and he proceeded on his way. The sun of
noon darted its ray upon him, but his march was uninterrupted. He
entered a pine wood, and, following the track of flocks, he heard the
murmurs of a fountain. Oppressed with thirst, he hastened toward it.
The water welled up from the ground and filled a natural basin;
flowers grew on its banks and looked on the waters unreflected, for
the stream paused not, but whirled round and round, spending its
superabundance in a small rivulet that, dancing over stones and
glancing in the sun, went on its way to its eternity--the sea. The
trees had retreated from the mountain, and formed a circle about it;
the grass was green and fresh, starred with summer flowers. At one
extremity was a silent pool that formed a strange contrast with the
fountain that, ever in motion, showed no shape, and reflected only
the color of the objects around it. The pool reflected the scene with
greater distinctness and beauty than its real existence. The trees
stood distinct, the ambient air between, all grouped and pictured by
the hand of a divine artist. Ludovico drank from the fount, and then
approached the pool. He looked with half wonder on the scene depicted
there. A bird now flitted across in the air, and its form, feathers,
and motion, were shown in the waters. An ass emerged from among the
trees, where in vain it sought herb-age, and came to grass near these
waters; Ludovico saw it depicted therein, and then looked on the
living animal, almost appearing less real, less living, than its
semblance in the stream.</p>

<p>Under the trees from which the ass had come lay someone on the
ground, enveloped in a mantle, sleeping. Ludovico looked
carelessly--he hardly at first knew why his curiosity was roused;
then an eager thought, which he deemed madness, yet resolved to
gratify, carried him forward.</p>

<p>Rapidly he approached the sleeper, knelt down, and drew aside the
cloak, and saw Viola, her child within her arms, the warm breath
issued from her parted lips, her lovebeaming eyes hardly veiled by
the transparent lids, which soon were lifted up.</p>

<p>Ludovico and Viola, each too happy to feel the earth they trod,
returned to their cottage-their cottage dearer than any palace--yet
only half believing the excess of their own joy. By turns they wept,
and gazed on each other and their child, holding each other's hands
as if grasping reality and fearful it would vanish.</p>

<p>Prince Mondolfo heard of their arrival. He had long suffered
keenly from the fear of losing his son. The dread of finding himself
childless, heirless, had tamed him. He feared the world's censure,
his sovereign's displeasure--perhaps worse accusation and punishment.
He yielded to fate. Not daring to appear before his intended victim,
he sent his confessor to mediate for their forgiveness, and to
entreat them to take up their abode at Mondolfo. At first, little
credit was given to these offers. They loved their cottage, and had
small inclination to risk happiness, liberty, and life, for worthless
luxury. The Prince, by patience and perseverance, at length convinced
them. Time softened painful recollections; they paid him the duty of
children, and cherished and honored him in his old age; while he
caressed his lovely grandchild, he did not re-pine that the
violet-girl should be the mother of the heir of Mondolfo.</p>
