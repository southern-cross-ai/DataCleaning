<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

<pre>
Thou art indeed ill-fated;
Snatch'd, when an infant, from thy nurse's arms.
And borne we known not whither.
--LANGHORNE
</pre>

<p>Near that long tract of hills, known by the name of Mount Jura,
was situated, in the year 1605, the cottage of Julie de Rubine;
commanding on one side a view of Geneva and its Lake, lying north of
the town, and on the other an extensive plain, covered with
pine-woods and pasturage: beyond which arose, in various forms and
directions, that vast range of Alps which divide Italy from Savoy,
forming a natural barrier to Geneva and its little territory.</p>

<p>The owner of this secluded retreat, having met with some peculiar
misfortunes, originating from the depravity of those with whom she
was unhappily connected, had disengaged herself from the world at
that period of existence when it usually presents the most alluring
prospects; and accompanied by her infant son and one faithful
domestic, had taken refuge in retirement.</p>

<p>After having passed some years in uninterrupted solitude, she was
one evening returning from a monastery, near Ripaille, which formerly
belonged to the hermits of St Maurice, whither she had been at
confession, and was pursuing her way through a large forest, whose
vistas terminated upon the Lake, when she observed a cabriolet move
along at some distance before her, which afterwards stopped at her
door.</p>

<p>Before Julie de Rubine arrived at her cottage, the traveller, who
was a female, had alighted, and on hearing her name, advanced some
paces to receive her. She was a tall thin woman, of a pale, healthy
appearance. Her dress bespoke her of the middle rank of life, and an
infant that she held in her arms, which was entirely obscured in a
mantle, intimated that she acted in the capacity of nurse.</p>

<p>After having unfolded the occasion of her visit, the stranger
presented the recluse with a letter, which she informed her was from
the Marchese de Montferrat. Julie de Rubine started, and appeared
much affected. The messenger observed these emotions with concern,
and endeavoured to remove the cause by introducing a new subject of
conversation. She discoursed upon the temperature of the climate, the
fineness of the weather, and related many little adventures they had
met with upon the road, not forgetting to recite the difficulties
they had encountered as they journeyed over the rocky steeps of Mount
Cennis, on their way from Turin thither, which she assured her had
cost them much labour and fatigue. Julie, who perceived the kindness
of the intention, attempted to subdue the acuteness of those
feelings, which had prevented her from welcoming the stranger with
her accustomed courtesy, and, having in some measure succeeded,
ventured to turn aside the mantle with which the infant was covered,
and beheld a very beautiful female child, apparently about four
months old. Having expressed her astonishment that the stranger
should travel so far with so young a companion, she ordered
Doroth&eacute;e, her servant, to prepare some refreshment; and taking
the Marchesse's letter, with trembling hand she opened it, and read
as follows:</p>

<p>The Marchese de Montferrat having, after many unsuccessful
inquiries, discovered the abode of Julie de Rubine, and wishing in
some measure to compensate for the misfortunes he has occasioned, is
willing to offer his protection to her, and also to her son, for whom
he will hereafter amply provide, on condition that she will take into
her care a young female infant, and perform, in every respect, the
part of a mother. She is also requested not to make any inquiries
relative to the child, but to rest satisfied that there are reasons,
which, if known, would be deemed sufficient for the justification of
his conduct, however mysterious it may appear. If Julie de Rubine
agrees to these proposals, the Marchese will provide for her an
asylum, in which she will find every accommodation suitable to her
rank; he will also send a person to convey her to her new habitation,
and will settle upon her a handsome annual sum as a provision for
herself and the children. He also considers that, to avoid the
effects of an impertinent curiosity, it will be at once prudent and
necessary to take another name and to assume the character of a
widow. If Julie De Rubine acquits herself in this affair with that
uniform propriety of conduct which she has hitherto never failed to
support, she and her child have every thing to hope from his
patronage; but on the contrary, if she refuses to comply with his
desires, and presumes to disclose the most unimportant incident
respecting this circumstance to any individual living, she has
everything to fear from his displeasure.</p>

<p>Amazement for the moment almost deprived the agitated Julie of
reason! That the Marchese should select her from the rest of the
world, to act as a mother to the orphan; her whom he had so
materially injured, and that this child should be conveyed to her
under circumstances so peculiar, was equally surprising and
inexplicable! That it was deprived of maternal attention was beyond a
doubt, or why send it to her, to perform the part of so tender a
relation? It might yet have a father living, and who could that
father be? An universal trembling seized her as the idea occurred--an
idea which the whole of the proceeding apparently justified, that it
was no other than the Marchese. She knew that he had not been long
united to a woman of high rank and considerable fortune, to whom he
had offered himself on an early and superficial acquaintance, when
resident in the neighbourhood of Padua, whither he had spent some
time in the society of a friend to whom he had been long attached.
His love of gallantry was too generally known to allow the
probability of his affections being long in the possession of any
one; she, by melancholy experience, was convinced of the truth of
this assertion: the child could then be no other than the offspring
of an illicit amour. She knew that, previous to his marriage, he had
seduced the affections of a young Neapolitan beauty, the daughter of
a merchant, whose name was Di Capigna, less celebrated for external
charms than for those seductive and elegant accomplishments, 'that
take the reason prisoner'.</p>

<p>Her father, she had been informed, did not long survive the loss
of his daughter's reputation, which event so seriously affected the
Signora that she suddenly left the Marchese, some believing that she
was dead, and others that she had thrown herself into a convent; but
the truth of this singular affair was not known.</p>

<p>Every circumstance seemed to favour the opinion that this might be
the child of the Signora Di Capigna, whose birth, added to her own
distresses, probably occasioned her death. She had not indeed heard
of an infant; but this, considering the secrecy with which affairs of
this nature are usually conducted, was not a matter of surprise,
particularly as the marriage of the Marchese must have taken place
before the birth of the child. Every thing being thus collected,
there no longer remained a doubt in the breast of Julie de Rubine,
but that this was indeed the daughter of the Marchese, and
consequently of the Signora Di Capigna.</p>

<p>The conclusion of the letter contained a threat, if she refused to
comply with his desires; yet the pride of conscious innocence
revolted at the idea of receiving pecuniary support from a man, who
had stooped to the most humiliating and degrading falsehoods, merely
to tarnish the brightest of all gems, a stainless reputation. But
when she considered the unprotected situation of her child, her
Enr&icirc;co, who would find a bitter enemy, where from the ties of
nature he might reasonably expect the tenderest of friends, her own
inability to provide for him, the hardships to which he might be
exposed, pleaded powerfully the cause of the Marchese, and staggered
her accustomed firmness. This little innocent too, sent to solicit
her protection--what sorrows, what distresses, might it have to
encounter, what treatment might it experience from the harsh and the
mercenary! These reflections, excited by the unexampled generosity of
her nature, sunk deep into her heart, and elevated her above every
ignoble and selfish consideration. For herself she would have been
contented to have lived and died in obscurity, and would have endured
without murmuring the severest penury rather than have thrown herself
upon the liberality of one, for whom she now felt no softer sentiment
than horror and resentment But her son had no doubt a claim to his
protection; on his part it might be considered as a debt, not as a
bounty; and as to the infant, a handsome allowance might certainly be
demanded for such a charge, without incurring an obligation; but the
matter was too important to be immediately determined. Silent and
deliberating she quitted her apartment, and returned into the room,
where she had left the nurse and child.</p>

<p>The latter was now awake, and as Julie de Rubine pressed its cheek
gently to her lips, it smiled; she took its hand; it grasped her
finger and she imagined looked as if imploring her protection Agatha,
Which was the name of the messenger, sent by the Marchese observed
these maternal attentions with apparent satisfaction. And discovering
much humanity and softness in the deportment of the recluse
endeavoured to direct these amiable traits of character to the
advantage of her employer by dwelling with a. Tender concern upon the
beauty and innocence of the child, from whom she lamented she was so
soon to be separated. She expatiated also on the generosity of the
Marchese, extolling the benevolent solicitude he had displayed in the
cause of the infant, who but for him, she added, might have perished
for want, as few were at once invested with power and inclination to
patronize the unfortunate Madame de Rubine, after having complimented
the stranger upon her sensibility, inquired how long the infant had
remain under her protection, and was informed ever since it was born
That it was consigned to her care by Paoli, her husband, at the
desire of the Marchese, with whom he had resided some years in the
capacity of steward; but that whose it was, or from whence it came,
she was incapable of ascertaining, though she had sometimes ventured
to interrogate Paoli upon the subject; his answers being always
short, undecisive, and frequently uttered with hesitation and
displeasure.</p>

<p>She then demanded whether she herself saw the Marchese, and if any
time was fixed for her return? The former part of the question was
answered with a negative; the message respecting her embassy was also
conveyed by her husband, who had intimated a desire that the affair
should be speedily determined as his Lord had some thoughts of
removing from the Castello St Aubin, his present residence in the
environs of Turin, to another estate to which he had recently
succeeded, in consequence of the death of a near relation, who,
having suddenly disappeared, was supposed to have been slain by
banditti, as he was returning from a remote province to his paternal
seat; which mournful event had, she added, so serious an effect upon
his lady, that she scarcely survived the intelligence; and during her
illness the affectionate attentions of the Marchese and Marchesa, who
were sent for to assist and administer consolation, so excited her
gratitude, that she bequeathed them all her valuables.</p>

<p>Julie then inquired if she was acquainted with the name of the
nobleman whose life had been terminated by this fatal disaster, and
whether he was also an Italian, and an inhabitant of Turin. But with
these particulars Agatha was totally unacquainted; she had, she said,
endeavoured to gain some information upon the subject, but her
exertions had been at present unsuccessful, as a variety of reports
had been circulated in the neighbourhood, few of which assumed the
appearance of truth. She then modestly reminded Madame de Rubine of
the necessity of entering into a speedy determination concerning the
child; as if the proposals conveyed in the letter were rejected, she
had orders to return without further delay, that it might be
committed to the protection of some other, who would not scruple, in
consideration of the terms proposed, to undertake the important
charge.</p>

<p>Julie, having assured her that she would re-examine these
proposals, and adopt, as soon as possible, a final resolution
concerning them, observed, that the infant was again fallen asleep,
and requested that it might be put to bed. Agatha, being much
fatigued, agreed to the proposition; and, after having laid the
little innocent to rest, and partaken of some refreshment with
Doroth&eacute;e, retired herself to repose. But Madame de Rubine's
mind was too much agitated and perplexed with the strange occurrences
of the day, to feel the least inclination to sleep. The Marchese's
letter, which contained such promises of protection to her son, was
flattering to the hopes of a fond and affectionate mother. But could
a man of his character be relied upon? Might he not, from caprice, if
not from a more reasonable motive, be induced at some future time
suddenly to withdraw that protection and might not this be more
severely felt, than if it had never been afforded? But could she with
justice suppose this possible? From his former conduct, without
departing, in the smallest instance from the native candour of her
mind, he was unable to form a judgment upon his conduct decisively to
his advantage. To her she was sensible he had not acquitted himself
as a man of principle or of honour; but maturer years she considered
might have corrected the errors of youth, and her misfortunes, united
with those of the Signora Di Capigna, might have led to repentance
and reformation. There had been instances of many who had entirely
forsaken their offspring, exposing them without pity all the
hardships of poverty and oppression; but crimes of this nature were
not become familiar to him; he seemed interested in their unprotected
situations, and was anxious to defend them from the insults and
cruelty of an unfeeling world.</p>

<p>The threat which the letter contained, appeared to have been made
use of merely for the purpose of conquering those little scrupulous
delicacies which might eventually stand in the way of her son's
advancement. If he was not concerned in their welfare, why not have
sent the infant to the care of some other; for doubtless many would
have received such proposals with transport. She was pleased to find
some traits of virtue in a character which resentment had for some
time placed in an unfavourable light; and being accustomed to behold
every circumstance with an eye of candour, she began to hope, at
least, that the Marchese was become a convert.</p>

<p>Weary and irresolute, she retired to her apartment; but to sleep
she found was impossible. Enr&icirc;co lay in a small bed by the side
of her's; his slumbers were undisturbed, though a smile occasionally
played upon his cherub lip. Julie, with all the fondness of parental
affection, stood and gazed anxiously upon him as he slept. A tear
fell upon her cheek when she reflected how soon the serenity of that
angel countenance might be disturbed-at some future time what might
be his suffering! A thousand mournful presages now arose in her mind;
and willing to divert her thoughts from so painful a subject, she
walked pensively towards the window.</p>

<p>It was a calm and serene night; the moon slept upon the brow of
the hill, and the whole face of nature wore an appearance of
gentleness and tranquillity. She thought of the days of childhood,
when she used to ramble with her father in the stillness of evening,
to hear the song of the nightingale. What vicissitudes had she known
since then! Could her parents have foreseen her misfortunes, what
would have been their anguish; and what was now their situation! Her
imagination then wandered to distant worlds; she raised her eyes
towards the stars of heaven; their number, the immensity of their
distance, excited her adoration and wonder! 'Possibly the spirits of
the departed,' cried she, 'may inhabit those glorious luminaries! How
enviable is their situation; now how far are they placed beyond the
reach of misfortune; their griefs, their inquietudes are now no
more!' Full of these reflections she retired to her bed; but it was
long before she forgot in sleep the strange occurrences of the
day.</p>

<p>In the morning she arose early, and again perused the Marchese's
letter. He had mentioned nothing of the melancholy story which Agatha
had imperfectly related, nor of the large estates he had succeeded to
in consequence of it. But this being an event in which she was not
immediately concerned, any information on this subject might be
deemed unnecessary.</p>

<p>As soon as the nurse and child arose, Madame de Rubine again took
the infant into her arms, whose complexional delicacy and beauty
equally attracted her admiration and astonishment. Whilst she
continued to gaze upon its sweet innocent countenance, it appeared
conscious of her attention; the soft sentiment of pity was already
ripening into affection, and she perceived, if she parted with it, it
would be with reluctance. She considered likewise it would a
companion for Enr&icirc;co, and that much domestic comfort might
reasonably expected from this lovely object of her compassion, the
stillness of uninterrupted retirement, particularly during the time
of her separation from Enr&icirc;co; which, however painful the
reflection was, she was convinced in the present state of affairs
indispensably requisite, as he must endeavour, by every necessary
exertion, to secure promotion and independence in that department,
which would eventually prove the least repugnant to his feelings and
inclinations. These suggestions determined her to accept the
proposals made to her by the Marchese; and, having acquainted Agatha
with her intention, she addressed a few lines to him in return, in
which she expressed her astonishment at this singular and unexpected
adventure; at the same time assuring him that, having consented to
take the child under her care, she was resolved to fulfil, in every
respect, the part of a parent; that he might also depend upon her
secrecy in the affair, and as he had offered her an asylum, which
nothing but the welfare of the children could have induced her to
accept, she must desire that he would never attempt visit them in
their retirement, as she should consider an interview of that kind as
highly improper.</p>

<p>Agatha, being impatient to return from her embassy, besought
permission to depart; which being granted, the carriage that had
conveyed her hither, and was left at a small inn near the cottage,
was immediately ordered. She then took an affectionate leave of the
infant; and, after many tender adieus and good wishes to Madame de
Rubine, set forwards on her journey.</p>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>

<pre>
Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort.
As if he mock'd himself, and scorn'd his spirit.
That could be mov'd to smile at any thing.
--SHAKESPEARE
</pre>

<p>Nothing material happened at the cottage till near a fortnight
after the departure of Agatha, when Paoli, her husband, and the
distinguished favourite of the Marchese, came to conduct Julie and
the children to their destined abode. He also brought a letter from
his lord, in which he expressed his entire approbation of her
conduct; assuring her, at the same time, that if the secret, with
which she was partially entrusted, remained inviolable, she might
depend upon his friendship and protection, and expect on his part the
most scrupulous attention to her desire, concerning his not visiting
the retreat he had chosen for her, which was a castle on a German
estate, beautifully situated near the Rhine. He also informed her,
that he had given orders for every necessary preparation to be made
against her arrival; and that he intended to remit her a considerable
sum quarterly, which would be more than sufficient to defray every
expence; and requested, that she would acquaint him, at the return of
Paoli, if any part of the arrangement, which he had formed for her
establishment, should not be agreeable to her wishes. He also desired
that, immediately on her arrival in Germany, she would name the
infant, which name he left entirely to her decision, and as to her
son, she might depend upon his honour to fulfil the promises already
made.</p>

<p>When Madame de Rubine had perused this epistle, she questioned the
steward respecting her new situation, and inquired whether any
servants were sent thither by the Marchese, or whether he expected
her to provide them.</p>

<p>Paoli assured her that every thing was in readiness for their
reception; that two servants were already there, an elderly woman and
a man, who had been some years in the service of his lord, at the
castello St Aubin, and who were either to remain or to return, as she
thought proper. The appearance of Paoli did not prejudice his fair
auditress much in his favour. His deportment was stern, harsh, and
forbidding, and she thought in the character of his brow she read
determined villainy. He seemed to behold, with the most scrutinizing
eye, her every look and action, forming in the whole of his behaviour
a striking contrast with the tenderness and artless simplicity of his
wife. She felt uneasy in his presence, and earnestly longed for the
time of his dismission to arrive. The consequence he assumed, from
the known partiality of the Marchese, bordered on rudeness, and he
frequently obtruded himself into her presence contrary to the rules
of good breeding, which, however, he affected to understand. He
seemed to possess an infinite deal of cunning, and to be every way
formed for intrigue and dark design. Being unwilling to resent this
want of address, she endeavoured, as much as possible, to divert her
mind from the uneasiness his unpleasant society occasioned, by
nursing her little charge, and listening to the childish simplicity
of Enr&icirc;co.</p>

<p>The ensuing week was now fixed for their departure, and Madame de
Rubine and Doroth&eacute;e were busily employed in making every
necessary arrangement for their journey. The few household goods she
possessed, which were of the simplest kind, were divided among the
neighbouring poor, by whom she was tenderly beloved.</p>

<p>After a residence of near four years in this beautiful retreat,
the amiable Julie found she could not bid it adieu without extreme
reluctance. In these calm and peaceful shades she had taken refuge
from the censure of a rash unfeeling world; and had in some degree
gained a tranquillity and composure of mind, which she once believed
it impossible ever to recover. She had endeavoured to reconcile
herself to her misfortunes, and to check, as much as in her power,
the natural sensibility of her disposition, which she was convinced
was too acute to admit of lasting comfort.</p>

<p>She knew that true happiness was only to be found in the bosom of
religion and virtue, and the warmth of her affection led her to
indulge in that glow of religious enthusiasm, which elevates the soul
beyond every earthly pursuit, and renders it susceptible of the most
worthy impressions. On the evening preceding their departure, she
wandered once more along that beautiful valley she was now soon to
quit for ever; and casting her eyes over the clear expanse of waters,
heaved a sigh at the recollection that she might probably, in that
situation, never behold it more. To part from these scenes, to which
she had been long inured, was like parting from a beloved friend,
which, though only known in the moments of sorrow, were still dear to
her. The sun had long sunk beneath the horizon, yet she still
continued her walk. It was now the gay season of the vintage, but the
rural sports were over, the shepherd's pipe was silent, and nothing
was heard from the mountains but the distant sound of the mournful
sheep-bell, and at intervals the rustling of the leaves, that faintly
sighed in the evening gale. Every object on which she gazed, wore
that soft and tender melancholy so congenial to her feelings, and
impelled her with an irresistible charm to linger in her favourite
walks. The large plane-tree, which had so often afforded her shelter,
the bank on which she used to sit selecting flowers for the playful
Enr&icirc;co, were objects of regret; and it was not till the shades
of night were perceptibly stealing upon the meek grey of the
twilight, that she recollected the impropriety of wandering so far
from her cottage alone, and at so late an hour. The danger to which
this imprudent conduct had exposed her, precipitated her steps, and
she was surprised on finding she had strayed so much farther from her
little retreat, than she had at first imagined. As she advanced, it
became so much darker that she was irresolute whether to proceed, or
to call at one of the huts of the peasants to procure a guide; but
recollecting that there were several others on the road leading to
her home, she ventured to continue on her way. On arriving at the
side of the wood, near to which the cottage was situated, the moon,
bursting from a cloud in its meridian splendour, partly dissipated
her fears; and the melodious song of the nightingale, who was
concealed in the inmost recesses of the wood, again arrested her
steps. As she listened, the strain swelled still louder, and more
plaintive; and she thought there was a pathos in the note she never
remembered to have heard before. It seemed the language of complaint,
and the frame of mind she was then in heightened the tender sensation
of pity that the lay inspired. Sitting down on a bench, which she had
formed under the shade of a chestnut, she took out her pencil, and
wrote the following lines, which have certainly but little poetical
merit, yet sufficiently evince that her griefs, though softened by
time and the comforts of religion, had made an impression too great
ever to be perfectly erased.</p>

<p>SONNET TO THE NIGHTINGALE</p>

<pre>
Hail, chantress sweet, who lov'st in woodlands drear.
And shades unseen beneath the pale moon's ray.
To pour thy sorrows in eve's listening ear.
And charm the nightly wanderer's lonely way;
Say, is it love that wakes the melting song?
Or pity's tender throe, or wan despair?
If such thy woes, ah! yet the strain prolong.
Still let thy wild notes float upon the air;
Yet spring's next visit shall, sweet bird, restore
Those ravag'd joys that wake the thrilling lay.
Sad mem'ry's open'd wounds shall bleed no more.
And happier love adorn the future day:
But not on me can spring one charm bestow.
Or make this pensive breast with her wild raptures glow.
</pre>

<p>Madame de Rubine had been absent on her evening walk so much
longer than usual, that Doroth&eacute;e, beginning to be alarmed, was
going in search of her; but was agreeably surprised on seeing her
safely seated under her favourite tree. Having again reminded her of
the lateness of the hour, which she had recently ceased to recollect,
she thanked the affectionate girl for her attention, and returned to
the cottage.</p>

<p>After a night spent in broken slumbers she arose, and every thing
being in readiness for their journey, and Paoli impatiently waiting
with the mules, they prepared to depart.</p>

<p>At first she was much alarmed at the necessity of the children
travelling without a carriage; but the steep and craggy mountains
they had to ascend rendered that mode of conveyance impossible. The
mule on which Doroth&eacute;e and the infant were seated, was led by
a peasant; Julie guided her own, and poor Enr&icirc;co was
reluctantly left to the care of Paoli.</p>

<p>Having slowly descended the hill, on which the cottage was
situated, they travelled along the beautiful and picturesque borders
of the lake, and without any material occurrence, arrived at
Lausanne, where the party was compelled to stop for a few days, being
fatigued with the ruggedness of the road, and the unpleasant motion
of the animals destined to convey them to their new abode. After this
salutary revival, they recommenced their journey along the finely
cultivated mountains between Lausanne and Vevay. The scenery of this
country, which perhaps is scarcely to be equalled, the mildness of
the season, and the wild harmony of the birds that inhabited the
branches of the pines, withdrew the attention of Madame de Rubine
from the unpleasant conversation of Paoli, which was gloomy, morose,
and artful. Chagrined at his behaviour, she avoided mentioning any
thing relative to the Marchese, and interrogated him as little as
possible as to their future residence. Doroth&eacute;e and
Enr&icirc;co were less disposed to silence; they saw much in the
novelty of the objects presented to them to attract their admiration,
and expressed it with all the simplicity of youth and nature. In the
evening they arrived at a small post-house on the road, which was
merely a cottage, though from its casual situation it had acquired
some importance. As soon as the host appeared, Paoli inquired of him
whether he could accommodate a party of travellers and mules with
lodgings for the night. The good man seemed doubtful, and, after some
minutes' conversation with his wife, informed them, that they had but
two beds fit for the reception of strangers, and that one was already
in use. 'This is unfortunate, indeed,' cried Julie, perplexed at this
unexpected disaster, 'as it is impossible to proceed any further
tonight with two children, and one an infant.' 'I am heartily sorry,'
replied the host, with much apparent concern; 'but what can be done
in the affair? There is a gentleman in the best bed, who is so ill
that my heart has ached for him ever since he has been here; and as
to his daughter, poor young creature! She has taken no rest night or
day since their arrival; and if he dies, which will probably be the
case, she will certainly die with him!' 'It is no matter who is ill,'
interrupted Paoli, haughtily, 'we have no leisure to hear affecting
stories; if we cannot procure beds here we must go on.' 'For heaven's
sake,' cried Julie, 'do, if possible, contrive somewhere for the
children to sleep; as to Doroth&eacute;e and myself, we will submit
to any thing if you will endeavour to accommodate them.' The host,
pleased with the gentle manners of Madame de Rubine, which derived no
inconsiderable advantage from being contrasted with the callous
moroseness of the steward, assured her, that he and his wife would
sit up themselves rather than they should suffer such an
inconvenience; and if she would accept of their bed, which was indeed
a very common one, in addition to that reserved for the use of their
guests, it would give him pleasure to have it in his power to oblige
them. This proposal Paoli would willingly have accepted; but Julie's
delicacy objected to making this temporary disarrangement, observing
that a night's rest was too valuable to those who were condemned to
arduous employment, to be sacrificed to the service of strangers. Her
arguments were, however, powerfully overruled by the host, who did
not fail to convince her, that his wife and himself were better able
to sustain the loss of a nights repose than they who had undergone
the fatigue of a long and tedious journey. After a little gentle
reluctance, which the countenance of Paoli sternly reproved, she
ventured to dismount, and was conducted into a small but decent room,
enlightened with a blazened fire, which the hostess had just kindled
for their reception, made of the dried stalks of the vine. The
appearance of neatness and cheerfulness, which reigned throughout
this humble dwelling, animated the drooping spirits of Madame de
Rubine, who was now relieved from apprehension respecting the
children, for whom she experienced the most tender concern and
solicitude Paoli himself seemed to lose something of his natural
gloom; he even condescended to converse with the landlord on the
manners of the country, its verdure, and of the mode of cultivating
the mountains. The hostess now appeared; who, spreading a clean
coarse cloth upon the table, assured her quests, that had she known
of their arrival, she would have prepared them a more comfortable
meal. Their daughter, a pretty looking girl, apparently about
eighteen, then entered with a small number of boiled eggs, some
bread, chiefly composed of rye, and the vin du cot&eacute;, which was
all the house afforded The bloom of Madelina, which was the name of
the host's daughter, could not fail to attract the attention of our
travellers. She was not tall, but elegantly shaped; her eyes
possessed all the vivacity and fire which is chiefly ascribed to the
Gallic brunette, mingled with a certain expression of softness and
sensibility, which added much to her native loveliness. Her fine fair
hair, which was remarkably luxuriant, fell in curls about her neck,
and shaded a forehead of the finest proportion, which was simply
ornamented with a neat straw hat and black ribbons; the mode of dress
which prevails, without individual exception, among the mountain
nymphs of Switzerland. As soon as Doroth&eacute;e had conveyed her
young charges to bed, Julia questioned the landlady about the
gentleman her husband mentioned, in terms so replete with compassion,
being desirous of knowing whether he was indeed so ill as he had been
represented, and if he had received any assistance from medicine.
Alas! Madame,' replied the hostess, 'he seems to care for no advice
but that of his ghostly confessor; and as to Mademoiselle his
daughter, she has scarcely partaken of any refreshment since she has
been here, and weeps continually. There is none but herself to attend
upon her father; and though I have frequently offered my assistance,
she has seldom accepted the proposal.' 'What a comfortless
situation!' cried Madame de Rubine, much affected by the landlady's
simple eloquence. 'Ill from home, and without assistance, a young
woman too, his only attendant! Can you not inform me from whence they
came, and whither they are going and is it not possible we may be of
service to them? The unfortunate have an irresistible claim on our
protection, and may we not obey the impulses of inclination when
they, are consistent with duty?' The hostess replied, 'that she knew
nothing more of them than that their names were La Roque; that they
arrived at the inn about four days ago, since which time the poor
gentleman had been so ill, that, though his disorder was somewhat
abated, his recovery was still very doubtful. That his daughter
seldom quitted his apartment except it was to prepare something of
refreshment for her father, and seemed herself to be sinking under
the calamity!' 'This is very singular,' cried Madame de Rubine, 'that
a gentleman, and an invalid, should travel into a distant country
attended only by his daughter! There must be something in this
circumstance of a very peculiar nature; I wish it was possible to
know more of it. Do commend me to the lady, and tell her, though a
stranger, I feel interested in her distresses, and should be happy to
have it in my power to alleviate them. Surely ceremony in an affair
of this nature may be dispensed with.' 'I will go to her instantly,'
returned the hostess, 'poor young lady! I am sure so kind a message
will comfort her. But would it not be better, Madame, if you was to
take a night's rest before you visit them? You seem weary, and such a
scene will, I fear, be too much for you.' 'We must not selfishly
consider our own ease,' replied Julie, 'when with a little exertion
we may render ourselves useful to others; besides, I have heard too
much already to be able to sleep, and, as we are travelling in haste,
we must pursue our journey to-morrow at an early hour.' Whilst this
conversation passed concerning the unfortunate La Roque, Paoli was
silent; but his looks sufficiently expressed his disapprobation of
her conduct. The luxury of doing good was a luxury unknown to him.
Totally devoid of benevolence himself, he did not believe it really
existed in the heart of another; and whilst Madame de Rubine was
indulging the fond and not delusive hope, that she might soften with
her tenderness the pang of misfortune, he was revolving in his mind
what secret purpose of her's this was to answer, and reflecting
whether it was not possible that treachery might not be concealed
under the veil of humanity. From the infamy of his own conduct he
formed his opinion of others; and when he could not make the
intentions and actions of the greater part of the world wear a colour
dark as his own, he believed himself outdone in cunning, and gave
them credit for a superior degree of duplicity. In a few minutes the
hostess returned with the warmest acknowledgments of gratitude from
the gentleman and his daughter, with an earnest desire of thanking
her personally for her attention. 'Monsieur,' added she, 'has just
awaked from a fine refreshing sleep, and seems better; if you will
permit me, I will shew you the room.' She then conducted Julie up
stairs, and having led her into the interior of the apartment,
introduced her as the kind stranger, and withdrew. The young lady,
who, notwithstanding the paleness of her looks, and the disorder of
her dress, appeared extremely lovely, stepped forward to receive her,
closing at the same time her missal, having been recently engaged in
devotion, which she replaced by a small image of the Virgin, that
adorned one of the angles. As her fair visitor began to unfold the
reasons that had actuated her to this singular mode of procedure, she
endeavoured to express the high sense she had of the obligation; but
an impulse of gratitude stifled her utterance, and the words she
would have articulated died upon her lips. She then gently undrew the
curtain and having removed a stool, on which was placed a lamp and a
crucifix, led her to the side of the bed. As she advanced, the
invalid, attempting to raise himself, held out his hand to receive
her; then gazing upon one of the most affecting Countenances he had
ever seen with mingled surprise and admiration 'May I ask, Madame,'
cried he, 'to whom I am indebted for this unexampled benevolence, and
what angel has directed you to sooth with your kindness the most
forlorn and unhappy of men?' Julie having returned this compliment to
her sensibility with her usual grace, apologized for the liberty she
had taken; to which she assured him she was not instigated by a
principle of idle curiosity, but from having cherished the idea that
she might possibly have it in her power to alleviate his sufferings.
She had been informed, she added, that he had at present no medical
assistance; and as business of a peculiar nature rendered it
necessary for her to quit the post-house early on the following day,
she intended, with his permission to send a physician to attend him,
from the nearest town. 'You are too, too good, Madame,' cried the
amiable young stranger speaking through her tears; 'but my father, I
fear, will never consent to it. I have urged the necessity of it
without ceasing; yet he is deaf to my entreaties.' 'Why, my child,'
interrupted La Roque, 'should I endeavour to prolong a life only
productive of evil? Have I not been an unnatural parent, a cruel
husband? Yes,' resumed he, fixing his hollow eyes upon a small
picture, which was fastened round his neck with a black ribbon, 'my
Helena! My much injured Helena! I was thy murderer!' Then heaving a
profound, convulsive sigh, he sunk again upon the pillow. 'Oh! my
father,' replied Mademoiselle, in a voice rendered tremulous by
emotion, 'how unjust, how cruel are these self-accusations! And why
will you thus aggravate affliction by remorse? Reflect how conducive
to health is serenity of mind, and for my sake, if not for our own,
embrace the means of recovery: for though retched at present from
circumstances not in our power to prevent, let us look forwards with
comfort and hope to better days.' Madame de Rubine, who, during these
pathetic exclamations had regarded Mademoiselle La Roque with a gaze
of earnest inquiry, endeavoured, by the most forcible arguments she
could summon to her aid, to reconcile him to the application of means
to accelerate his recovery, not only for the sake of his child, who
would feel so severely his loss, but from a principle of duty;
assuring him, at the same time, that, if he absolutely rejected her
proposal, she should depart with extreme reluctance. Finding, from
the expressive looks of the invalid, that what she had advanced was
not totally disregarded, she ventured to ask, why they travelled
without a servant? and requested permission to inquire in the village
for a suitable person to attend them. 'Your generosity, Madame,'
returned La Roque, 'is unbounded; and language can but feebly express
the warmth of my feelings on this occasion. The servant who attended
us from home was murdered by a party of banditti about nine leagues
from this place, whilst we narrowly escaped with our lives! I was
then ill, and the grief and apprehension this melancholy accident
excited, increased my fever, which, I have some reason to hope, is
now abating. Was your residence at the inn to be prolonged, I might
possibly be induced to venture upon a story long and mournful; but
thus much I will unfold: My real name is not La Roque; we are taking
refuge from the vilest, the most infamous of men-a wretch, who has
been long resolutely determined to accomplish my destruction!' 'May I
ask,' cried Julie, with apparent astonishment, 'who is this
persecutor, and what are his intentions?' 'His intentions are,'
returned La Roque, 'to the murder of a son to add that of a father;
and was there a greater fiend than himself, I would address him by
that name, it is the Marchese de Montferrat.' As he uttered these
last words, Julie started, and turned pale. She had, however,
presence of mind to conceal her emotion, and bade him proceed. 'It
would detain you too long, Madame,' replied La Roque, 'and my spirits
are unequal to the task; but should we ever meet again you shall be
thoroughly acquainted with the history of my misfortunes.' 'That we
should ever meet again is, I fear, too improbable to be depended
upon,' cried Madame de Rubine, hesitatingly; 'yet I feel much
interested in your narrative. May I ask where is your intended
residence?' 'In one of the convents on the borders of Germany,'
returned Mademoiselle La Roque, 'when my father's health will allow
us to travel. 'Then it is not impossible, as I am myself going to
reside in Germany, and may be fortunate enough to succeed in my
inquiries.' 'If then,' cried the invalid, 'you will so far honour me
as to visit the convent, the name I mean to take is Father Francisco;
and should my disorder prove fatal, my daughter will be there as
sister Maria.' Mademoiselle La Roque, who was sitting by the side of
the bed attending earnestly to this discourse, wept as he reverted to
the danger of his situation. The idea of parting was not become
familiar to her, and covering her face with her handkerchief, she
sobbed aloud. Madame de Rubine, whose heart 'was so finely tuned, and
harmonized by nature', that it vibrated at the slightest touch of
human calamity, endeavoured to console her young friend, by a
assurance that her fears were ill-founded respecting her father, who
was visibly in a state of convalescence; signifying also her
intention of sending a physician and a servant to attend him. Having
removed some slight objections that were offered by invalid, in
opposition to her benevolent proposal, she arose to depart; and
taking the hand of Mademoiselle with the tenderness and familiarity
of an old acquaintance, she informed her, that she would join in her
prayers for the recovery of Monsieur La Roque, and would spare no
effort to discover the convent to which they were retiring. After
many grateful adieus on the part of the strangers, his daughter
following Julie out of the apartment, requested the favour of her
name, that by mutual inquiries they might hasten second meeting. Not
immediately prepared to reply, she hesitated, blushed, and was
silent. The impropriety of mentioning a name she was soon to disown,
was too evident; to be absent from her thoughts, and the
embarrassment she had already discovered, filled her with new
confusion. Yet aware of the necessity of framing a reply, she evaded
the question, by informing her, that she would avail herself of every
possible means of learning their place of abode, and would then take
the earliest opportunity of acquainting her with every circumstance
she was permitted to disclose. Though harassed and fatigued with
traversing the mountains, Julie's mind was too much discomposed by
this strange unexpected adventure to allow her to hope for repose.
The story she had heard was imperfect, yet the villainy of the
Marchese was evident; and she reflected with terror on the certainty
that she had thrown herself upon the protection of a man capable of
the most deliberate cruelty. She wished that her curiosity had either
been gratified or unexcited; but was resolved to commence her
inquiries immediately on her arrival in Germany. La Roque had
mentioned their having fallen into the hands of banditti, who had
murdered his servant, and that his daughter and himself had escaped
with difficulty: consequently they must have been plundered by these
lawless wretches, and probably had nothing left to defray their
expenses, which accounted in some measure for his having no person to
attend upon him. With sensation of exalted pleasure, peculiar to the
noble and disinterested mind, she recollected she was empowered to
assist them; but this was an affair that required to be conducted
with the greatest delicacy imaginable, and she was for some time
irresolute in what manner to proceed. At last, however, she thought
of a expedient which would prevent every unpleasant consequence that
might otherwise arise from her benevolent intention--She had lately
received fifty ducats, the quarterly portion of her income; which, on
mature deliberation, she determined to inclose in a paper and leave
to be delivered by the hostess after her departure from the inn. Then
advancing slowly towards the stairs, she paused for a moment to
listen if Paoli was yet retired. Finding all was silent, and
remembering the lateness of the hour, and that he was probably in
bed, she ventured to proceed towards the kitchen, where she
discovered the host, his wife, and Doroth&eacute;e, sitting by a
cheerful fire. Having asked for a pen and ink, which was instantly
procured, she returned to her room, and framing an elegant apology,
in which she folded up the ducats, gave it to the landlady, with
orders to deliver it to Mademoiselle immediately on her quitting the
inn. In the morning she arose early, and having satisfied the kind
host for his civility, put another piece of gold into the hands of
his wife, desiring her to provide a servant to attend upon La Roque
and his amiable daughter, and then hastened to join the rest of the
party, who had already mounted their mules. After they had each taken
leave of the hospitable cottagers, they pursued their journey towards
the Castle of Elfinbach which was the name of the mansion selected
for them by the Marchese de Montferrat.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

<pre>
Yes, let the rich deride, the proud disdain.
These simple blessings of the lowly train;
To me more dear, congenial to my heart.
One native charm than all the gloss of art:
Spontaneous joys, here nature has its play.
The soul adopts, and owns its first-born sway;
Lightly they frolic o'er the vacant mind.
Unenvied, unmolested, unconfin'd.
--GOLDSMITH
</pre>

<p>As they advanced, the most picturesque objects of nature were
presented to their view; mountains crowned with the oak, the beech,
and the pine, and the most beautiful woods, groves, and lakes,
interspersed with vineyards and fertile fields! To behold such a
combination of beauties rivalling each other in grace, yet improving
by contrast the effect of the whole, without experiencing the most
pleasurable emotions, would have been scarcely possible; even Paoli
appeared not to be entirely insensible of the power of sylvan
attraction, for his features lost much of their accustomed
austerity.</p>

<p>He praised the rich verdure of the landscape, listened with
apparent satisfaction to the responses of the birds, which were
concealed in the pine-forests, and was for the moment, or affected to
be, pleased. He inquired about the strangers at the inn, what were
their names, and whither they were going; and whether the melancholy
account of the invalid, as delivered by the host, had not been
exaggerated.</p>

<p>Julie in this instance mistook curiosity for humanity; from the
uncontaminated purity of her own heart she formed the most liberal
opinion of others, and was not a little gratified on finding in the
character of Paoli, at least one trait that bore the semblance of a
virtue.</p>

<p>But when he found that some of his interrogatories were evaded,
and others answered undecisively, the look of gentleness which he had
assumed, vanished, and his brow wore the cloud of disappointment and
of anger.</p>

<p>The conversation, which this transient good-humour had animated,
now sunk into silence. Madame de Rubine, who found no difficulty in
ascertaining the cause, lamented that she had been deceived, though
she had the internal satisfaction of knowing that it was candour, not
childish credulity, that had thus momentarily obscured her better
judgment.</p>

<p>Her spirits were, however, both soothed and invigorated by the
glowing landscape before her; and she felt refreshed by the soft
salute of the zephyr that wafted the perfume of the flowers which
adorned the valleys.</p>

<p>The peasant girls were busily employed in carrying baskets of
grapes from the vineyards; the chamoix, who during the extreme heat
of the day had secluded themselves in the rocky glens of the
precipices, or in the darkest recesses of the woods, were now
skipping about them; while the loud laugh, the jest, and the song,
accompanied their labours, and sometimes the wild harmony of the
shepherd's pipe, attuned to the notes of the Kuhreihen, (The
herdsman's song) echoed from the mountains that simple fascinating
air, which is indiscriminately used by the inhabitants of the Alps,
when they drive their cattle from the valleys to the cultivated tops
of the eminences. As the evening advanced, the rural dance, beneath
the deep shade of the trees, began, and the voices of merriment and
delight were every-where heard. Those who were too ancient to join
themselves in the sports, were pleased spectators of those juvenile
delights, which many of them had, perhaps, reluctantly resigned, who
appeared to catch something of the spirit of youth as they
contemplated the happy groups before them. Uncorrupted simplicity was
never more forcibly expressed, nor was ever the charm of content more
successfully delineated; for the peasantry of these beautiful regions
seemed to have forgotten all the cares and anxieties inseparable from
humanity, in the unrestrained enjoyment of mirth and festivity.</p>

<p>Julie sighed as she surveyed these innocent pastimes, but it was a
sigh not of envy, but regret. She recalled to her recollection days
long past, which memory had too faithfully treasured among her
stores, when she also was gay, sportive, and animated as those who
were now blissfully partaking of pastoral amusement. The road being
less rugged than on the preceding day, and the mountains they had to
ascend less rocky, they were enabled to proceed farther than they at
first intended, and in the evening arrived at a small hotel, or
post-house, finely situated near the much-admired Lake of Murat,
which is so justly celebrated for its crystal surface.--Here they
remained during the night, and in the morning continued leisurely on
their way; Paoli still silent, Madame de Rubine thoughtful, and
Doroth&eacute;e and Enr&icirc;co gay and talkative.</p>

<p>After having previously passed through a number of those rich and
beautiful fir-woods, for which this country is deservedly eminent,
the travellers arrived at the town of Bern, where it was deemed
necessary for them to remain resident at least for a few days in
order to recruit their strength and spirits, in which time they had
an opportunity of surveying that master-piece of Gothic architecture,
the cathedral, which, for taste and greatness of design, scarcely to
be equalled in Switzerland, and of beholding those beautiful walks
that run along its side, commanding, from their elevated situation,
one of the most finished prospects in the world. The large number of
handsome fountains too, which were variously disposed throughout the
principal streets, came in for their share of admiration, as they
united beauty with convenience, and gave an air of coolness and
cleanliness to the appearance of the whole.</p>

<p>Julie recollecting that she was to take another name immediately
on her arrival in Germany, after much revolving in her mind, fixed
upon Chamont, and bestowed upon the infant that of Laurette. She also
engaged the most skilful physician to attend La Roque; and several
days having elapsed during their continuance at Bern, they proceeded
on their journey.</p>

<h3>Chapter 4</h3>

<pre>
High o'er the pines that, with their darkening shade.
Surround yon craggy bank, the castle rears
Its crumbling turrets; still its tow'ring head.
A warlike mien, a sullen grandeur wears.
--MICKLE
</pre>

<p>It was at a late hour when the party arrived at their destined
abode, and the shades of evening had conspired, with the solitude of
its situation, to give an air of gloomy magnificence to the scene.
The castle, which was seated upon an eminence, about a quarter of a
league from the bed of the river, seemed to have been separated by
nature from the habitable world by deep and impenetrable woods. Two
of the towers, which were all that remained entire, were half
secreted in a forest; the others, which were mouldering into ruins,
opened into a narrow, uncultivated plain, terminating in a rocky
declivity, at the bottom of which flowed the Rhine, wide, deep, and
silent. Paoli, having dismounted, conveyed them through the principal
portal to the door of the great hall; when heaving a massy knocker,
which returned a deep-toned hollow sound, he waited for some time in
visible impatience, and no one approaching, again repeated the alarm.
In a few moments, the bolts being undrawn with a suspicious caution,
the heavy doors were unfolded by an aged domestic, who came forwards
to welcome them, and to lead them into the interior of the mansion.
They were then conducted through a spacious hall into a room newly
fitted up for their reception, which seemed, from the many vestiges
of ancient grandeur which remained, to have been formerly the grand
saloon of the castle. The antique furniture, consisting of many
articles long fallen into disuse, and the dark wainscot composed of
larch-wood, which was overhung with a number of grotesque figures,
aided the gloom of its appearance, and might have awakened unpleasant
sensations, had not the effect been counteracted by the cheerful
blaze of a fire, which animated the sinking spirits of the travellers
till the hour that called them to repose. Julie, having enquired if
necessary accommodations were made for the children, which was
answered in the affirmative, partook of some refreshment; and, after
lingering for a few minutes to examine the figures upon the walls,
expressed a wish to retire, and was conducted by Margaritte, the old
female domestic, to her room. As she passed along the hall, which was
feebly enlightened with the expiring ray of a dim and solitary lamp,
she shuddered involuntarily at the gloom of its appearance, and
followed her guide in pensive silence. Having ascended the stairs,
and passed through the corridor, into which opened several
apartments, Margaritte informed her of the one designed for herself,
and wishing her a good night, left her to repose. Thoughtful and
dejected, she retired to her bed. The desolate aspect of the mansion
had already affected her spirits, and as the wind howled in hollow
murmurs round the turret, in which her chamber was situated, and
sometimes in hollow gusts agitated the decayed tapestry with which it
was hung, she looked fearfully around, and shrunk with a
superstitious dread entirely new to her. It seemed as if the dreary
abode, to which she was consigned, had long been forsaken by
humanity, and was now become the asylum of supernatural agents; but
reproving herself for this momentary weakness, and turning her
thoughts towards Laurette and Enr&icirc;co, her mind dwelt with
something like comfort upon the future, and she sunk into a tranquil
slumber. The sun shone in full splendour when she awoke, and reminded
her that she had slept past her usual hour. Hastily arising, she
endeavoured to ring the bell, that she might inquire of
Doroth&eacute;e how the children had rested; but from long neglect it
seemed to have forgot its office, and it was some time before she
succeeded. In a few minutes her faithful servant attended with the
infant and Enr&icirc;co; whilst the innocent smiles of the former,
and prattling simplicity of the latter, contributed to chase away
every melancholy impression which her new situation had occasioned.
Having pressed them to her bosom with maternal tenderness, she
desired breakfast to be instantly prepared, and dressed herself in
haste. The day, which was chiefly devoted to domestic arrangements,
passed with unusual rapidity. The attention of Madame de Rubine was
now chiefly divided between her children, and the cares of her
household, which two material concerns so entirely occupied her
thoughts, that she did not revert so frequently as before to the
primary cause of her inquietudes. The family, which was stationary
before their arrival, consisted of Margaritte, an old female servant,
the same who had directed her to her apartment on the preceding
night; Lisette, who was her granddaughter, and Ambrose, a man who had
been long resident in the family of the Marchese, to whom she was
introduced by the name of Chamont. The countenance of Paoli still
wore the same forbidding expression; and though Julie found it
necessary to consult with him on some subjects relative to her
present establishment, she still retained an unconquerable aversion
to his general conversation and deportment, which gave an air of
reserve to her manners, that not escaping his penetration, excited an
equal degree of distrust in his breast, which he endeavoured to
smother in silence. As it was necessary, both from the desire of the
Marchese, and from the age of the child committed to her care, that
the baptismal rites should be performed, a friar, from a neighbouring
monastery, of the Carthusian order, was applied to, who, according to
the usual ceremonies of the Romish church, gave her the name of
Laurette. When this was concluded, Julie, who had not yet examined
the different apartments in the castle, wandered for some time in
uninterrupted silence through a long extent of desolated chambers,
some of which were hung with old arras, and others wainscotted with
cedar and Spanish oak. The furniture, which seemed to be nearly
coeval with the building, being formed of the most durable materials,
had long resisted the attacks of time; but was now, with the damps
and with age, falling fast into decay. She then proceeded through a
gallery to a suite of rooms that communicated with the eastern
turret, the last of which opened into the oriel. Here she observed
several portraits, which appeared to have been the workmanship of
some of the best Italian masters. Two of them which were apparently
more modern than the rest, chiefly engaged her attention; though even
these were so covered with dust, and so injured with the damps, as to
have lost much of their former beauty. The first was the figure of a
young warrior, who was supposed to have been mortally wounded in an
engagement. He was supported by two grey-haired veterans; an
allegorical figure of Death approached with a dart, which Valour,
accoutred as Mars, opposed with his shield. The other was the figure
of a female leaning upon a tomb; it possessed uncommon beauty and
expression; the hands were clasped as if in prayer; the eyes, which
were dark, were directed towards heaven with peculiar sweetness, and
spoke, in a language the most eloquent, the extreme sensibility of
the mind. Having gazed for some time upon these pictures with silent
admiration, she proceeded through a gallery which led to the western
side of the structure; in which were also several spacious and
forsaken apartments that received additional gloom from the evening
twilight, and made her shrink with fearful apprehension. She wondered
why the Marchese had placed her and the children in this comfortless
abode; or, if this was indispensable, why he had not made it more
habitable? It seemed as if he was uninterested in her happiness, and
careless of her fate:--the words of La Roque returned forcibly upon
her mind; he had pronounced him a murderer; she shuddered at the
thought, and reproved herself for not prevailing upon Mademoiselle
when she led her from the room, to give her the outlines of the
story; though she entertained the hope that in a short time she
should be able to discover their residence, and might then be
informed of the whole. Wrapped in silent meditation, she rambled for
some time through the long winding passages, without being able to
find the marble staircase which she had first ascended; but was
relieved from this incertitude on reaching the corridor, which she
descended in haste, leaving the greater part of the mansion to be
explored at some future time. Though an air of melancholy
distinguished every object around, there was much of the sublime and
the beautiful in the appearance of the castle, and also in the
surrounding scenery. Julie, having again crossed the hall, proceeded
towards the portico, being resolved to examine more minutely the
awful grandeur of its external aspect, which she had never attempted
before, having been engaged in the duties of her family the greater
part of the day. Walking into the inner court, which was wild and
grass-grown, she stopped to observe a figure, which haste and the
darkness of the evening had prevented her from perceiving on her
arrival. It was a column of the Corinthian order, on whose summit was
erected an equestrian statue of black marble, representing a young
hero in complete armour, which, on examination, she found was
designed for the same as the portrait she had observed in the oriel.
It seemed to aid the solemnity of the scene, and acquired additional
character from the loneliness of its situation; surrounded by lofty
walls, which were overgrown with wild weeds, and the deadly
night-shade, whilst the thread moss encrusted the fragments of the
fallen ramparts which lay scattered at the base of the pillar, it
seemed to stand as if exulting in its strength, and triumphing amid
the desolation and ruin it surveyed. She now proceeded through a gate
into the outer court, which was still more wild than the former one,
leading to the principal portal. The grey mist of the twilight, which
now deepened and reflected upon every object a dusky hue, made her
fearful of venturing through the avenues at that lonely hour, and
occasioned her to return again towards the castle. As she surveyed
that lofty edifice, which seemed to shrink from observation in the
deep recesses of the wood, her imagination dwelt with horror upon the
miseries of war, which rendered necessary those impenetrable
fortresses, those massy walls that spoke of murder and imprisonment,
in which the proud possessor, wrapped in selfish security, listened
to the cry of anguish and the groan of death with sullen apathy. She
was roused from these reflections by the appearance of Paoli, who had
just emerged from the wood, and with his arms folded upon his breast,
in the attitude of musing, was crossing the inner court. As soon as
the gloom permitted him to distinguish her, he started and retreated,
as a person who, conscious of guilt, recedes from the eye of
observation, lest his secret designs should be displayed; but,
anxious to learn for whom the statue was designed, and the pictures
she had seen in the oriel, she followed him into the hall, and
interrogated him concerning them. He seemed, however, averse to
gratifying her curiosity; but whether this proceeded from his
ignorance of the subject, or his own uncommunicative disposition, he
was too great a master of dissimulation for her to discover; but
though he did not give her the information she immediately desired,
he indulged her with a piece of intelligence of a more interesting
nature, which was, that he intended to quit the mansion on the
following day. This intimation was received with pleasure not only by
Julie, but also by the rest of the family, who all acknowledged
themselves weary of his unprepossessing deportment and manners. When
the morning arrived, whilst Paoli was preparing to depart she wrote a
few lines to the Marchese, to acquaint him, that, agreeable to his
former request, she had named the infant; and from his not having
signified any desire of fixing upon it himself, previous to her
residence in the castle, she had ventured to give it that of
Laurette. She concluded this concise epistle with informing him, that
she considered herself as strictly bound to fulfil the promises
already made, and depended upon his honour for a future provision for
Enr&icirc;co. This being folded up, and delivered to the steward, he
repeated his formal adieus, and set forwards towards Italy. Julie,
whose time was now uniformly devoted to the service of her little
favourites, and other laudable occupations, became gradually
reconciled to her new situation; and habit so powerfully prevailed,
as to render scenes, which were at first beheld with an unconquerable
emotion of terror, interesting and even charming. She frequently
rambled in the woods, which were beautiful and wild, and sometimes on
the banks of the Rhine; where, taking her pencil or her lute, she
would oftentimes linger till the close of the day, till the sun
having sunk beneath the horizon, was lost beyond the distant hills. A
long acquaintance with sorrow had given strength and elasticity to
her mind. She had acquired by effort an advantage which Nature,
though in other respects liberal, had withheld; an advantage which
enabled her at once to endure misfortune, and to triumph over
it.--She knew that a state of uninterrupted happiness was never
intended to be the lot of mortality, and that to suffer with uniform
fortitude was true dignity. This lesson, which her mother had
inculcated in youth, she had cherished in maturity. The meek and
unaffected piety of that excellent parent was never absent from her
thoughts, and she exerted her most strenuous endeavours to emulate
her virtues. Time, though it had thrown a veil over the acute sorrow
which her loss had excited, had awakened a more tender, if a less
melancholy sensation, when her imagination reverted with more than
filial affection to the past; and as in rural scenes the mind is more
abstracted from worldly pursuits, it is also more susceptible of
amiable impressions. This directed her to the recollection of every
estimable precept delivered by her deceased and much-lamented parent,
which had been hitherto the established rule of her conduct. As no
material incident occurred at the castle of Elfinbach for a
considerable time after the arrival of the family, it may here be
proper to introduce the story of Julie de Rubine, that the reader may
be acquainted with the nature of these misfortunes which had
occasioned her to embrace, in early youth, a life of almost total
seclusion.</p>

<h3>Chapter 5</h3>

<pre>
Canst thou not minister to minds diseas'd.
Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow.
Raze out the written troubles of the brain.
And with some sweet oblivious antidote.
Cleanse the foul bosom of that perilous stuff
That weighs upon the heart
--SHAKESPEARE
</pre>

<p>Julie de Rubine was descended from an ancient and illustrious
family, long resident in the southern part of France. Her father's
name was Gerard, who was the only son of St Herbert de Rubine. He had
entered at an early period of life into the service of his country,
and signalized himself in the victorious battles of Henry the Third;
but not receiving from this Monarch those honours which he considered
as the just reward of his valour, he abandoned the Court and the
sword together, and retired, with an amiable wife and his only
daughter, to a chateau on a small paternal estate in the province of
Artois.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more congenial to the disposition of Madame de
Rubine than the sequestered situation of this beautiful retreat. The
chateau was of Gothic construction, and seemed to have withstood the
attacks of ages; but the northern side of the edifice was now visibly
falling to decay, and St Gerard's mind was entirely occupied by
endeavouring to make this part of the structure habitable, without
destroying that appearance of ancient simplicity which formed its
most striking beauty; but when this was completed, and the ardour of
pursuit was over, he again experienced all that chagrin and restless
dissatisfaction, which is too often the consequence of disappointed
ambition.</p>

<p>This change Madame de Rubine beheld with extreme regret, and
attempted to remove the cause with all the tenderness of a refined
and inviolable affection, hoping, by the example of her own exemplary
piety, she might be enabled to elevate his mind above the trifling
consideration of worldly dignities; but she knew not all the
distresses of the unfortunate Gerard. Previous to his seclusion from
the gay circles of life he had contracted debts, that the narrowness
of his annual income, which he had long vainly hoped to increase,
rendered impossible to discharge; and the solicitude he felt in
behalf of his amiable wife, had imprudently confined the secret to
his own bosom.</p>

<p>He had no sooner quitted Paris than he received a letter from his
principal creditor, demanding the immediate payment of a large sum.
This event determined him to write to Madame Laronne, his only
sister, who had been some years a widow, and was left in affluent
circumstances, to acquaint her with the embarrassed situation of his
affairs, and also to request the loan of a sum sufficient to
discharge the debt.</p>

<p>But here his too sanguine expectations were again deceived Madame
Laronne assured him, that had it been possible, nothing would have
contributed more to her happiness than to have given him a proof of
her regard by affording pecuniary assistance; but the stile of
elegance, to which she had been accustomed, was now become necessary
to her happiness; and her expenses were lately so considerably
increased, that she was sorry to add she must endure the painful
sensation which refusing his request would inevitably excite.</p>

<p>Grief and resentment, the natural consequence of unexpected
ingratitude, now agitated the mind of the astonished Gerard. He knew
that Madame Laronne's rank in life, and also her ambition, required
the ostentatious display of wealth and grandeur; but he was also
convinced that, without materially injuring herself, she had it
sufficiently in her power immediately to relieve his necessities.
When the mingled emotions of indignation and anguish had, in some
measure, subsided, he seemed to have lost all his energy of soul;
nothing bestowed even a transitory pleasure, and he sunk into the
most alarming melancholy! Not even the conversation of Madame de
Rubine, nor the undeviating gentleness of her manners, could for a
moment withdraw his thoughts from the painful contemplation of his
real and imaginary distresses. That smile of affection, and that look
of sentiment, which once cherished his vivacity, and rewarded her
tenderness, was now lost in the gloom of disappointment, disgust, and
anguish.</p>

<p>Julie, having now entered upon her thirteenth year, was remarkably
tall of her age, and elegant in her person. Her disposition was mild,
frank, and benevolent; and she united, with admirable discretion the
unadorned graces of youth, with the uniform sedateness of maturer
years. In obedience to the will of her father she had learned to play
upon the lute, and her voice, which was exquisitely sweet, was
perfectly adapted to the soft and plaintive tones of that charming
instrument. During the few first months of their residence at the
chateau, St Gerard frequently rambled with her by moon-light through
the beautiful woods, and sometimes over the fine range of hills which
appeared so picturesque from the chateau; where he would desire her
to play one of his favourite airs, selected from the sonnets of
Ariosto, or expressing the melting sorrows of Petrarch.</p>

<p>The look of settled despondency which was so strongly portrayed on
the features of the unfortunate veteran, when his new situation no
longer afforded amusement and variety, did not remain unobserved by
his amiable daughter, who exerted herself unceasingly to remove it by
the sprightliness of her wit, the melody of her voice, or the soft
pathos of her lute; but his mind, enervated by sorrow, was no longer
alive to the fine touches of harmony; and frequently, in the midst of
one of his favourite songs, to which he had formerly listened with
all the rapture of enthusiasm, he would start as from a dream, and
hasten from the room as if agitated by the appearance of some
frightful demon.</p>

<p>His constitution, which in the early part of his life had suffered
much from the severity of military discipline, now became visibly
impaired; the disorder of his mind daily increased; melancholy became
habitual to him, and so rapid was the progress it made in undermining
his health, that Madame de Rubine began to be seriously alarmed.
Advice was immediately procured, and change of air prescribed; but
not to quit the chateau was the unalterable determination of Gerard.
A nervous fever was the consequence of this resolution, which in a
short time terminated his existence.</p>

<p>This shock Madame de Rubine supported with that true dignity of
soul, which gave a peculiar grace and energy to every sentiment and
action. She felt severely her loss, but she felt it with the
resignation of a Christian; she mingled patience with sorrow, and was
enabled, through the most pure and elevated piety, to triumph over
the repeated attacks of calamity. But the lovely Julie possessed not
at this early period of life that exalted strength of mind, which she
admired, without being able to imitate, in the character of her
mother. That exquisite sensibility, which glowed upon her cheek, and
spoke, in the fine language of her eyes, the tenderness of a father,
she had cherished as a grace, without reflecting that, if indulged,
it would degenerate into weakness, and cease to be a virtue.</p>

<p>Soon after the remains of St Gerard were deposited in the chapel
of the chateau, Madame de Rubine, whose health was much injured by
her unceasing attention to her husband, was advised by the physician
who attended her, to try the effect of a softer climate.</p>

<p>About this time she received a consolatory letter from Madame
Laronne, with a pressing invitation to visit her at her seat near
Turin; which proposal would have been accepted with gratitude, had
not the coldness, bordering upon contempt, which marked her behaviour
towards her brother, lessened her in the estimation of his
affectionate widow. For the sake of Julie, however, she was un
willing to refuse this offered kindness; she considered that her
illness might possibly prove fatal, and in that case it would be
right to secure a friend for her child, though she ardently wished
that friend had been any other than Madame Laronne.</p>

<p>Every thing was now properly arranged for the intended journey,
and the time fixed for their departure, when Madame de Rubine as
attacked by a malignant disorder, which threatened a speedy
dissolution. It was her mind only that was masculine; for her frame
being excessively slight, and delicately formed, was incapable of
sustaining unusual fatigue.</p>

<p>Julie, who had not yet recovered from the shock occasioned by the
death of her father, now felt her former loss was small, when
compared with what she should experience in being parted from her
beloved mother; and when she reflected upon the probability of this
event, the dreadful presentiment worked so powerfully upon her
feelings, as almost to deprive her of reason.</p>

<p>Madame de Rubine beheld the anguish of her daughter with extreme
concern, which was augmented by the mournful idea of a separation, as
the dangerous symptoms of her disease hourly increased; this she
believed was inevitable, and being fully apprized of her situation,
with that calm dignity which accompanied every action of her life,
she desired that a friar from a neighbouring monastery, who was her
confessor, might attend with the consecrated water, and read the
service for the dying.</p>

<p>This customary ceremony being over, and the extreme unction
administered, she appeared for some moments unusually agitated; but
after a second interview with the monk, became more serene and
tranquil. Being firmly persuaded that the awful hour was approaching
that was to remove her from, and dissolve all her earthly connexions,
she requested that Julie might be instantly called.</p>

<p>Pale and trembling, she entered the apartment, leaning upon the
arm of a servant, and without attending to the common forms by
addressing the holy visitor, who had just risen from a small altar
erected near the window, threw herself by the side of the bed, and
fixing her languid eyes upon the faded, yet interesting, countenance
of her mother, burst into a flood of tears!</p>

<p>The venerable friar regarding her with an aspect on which pity and
affection were strikingly depicted, endeavoured to console her with
the comforts of religion, by reminding her of the gracious promises
of protection which the doctrines of Christianity afforded, in a
stile replete with simple and unaffected eloquence; but finding that
her feelings were too acute to admit of premature consolation, with
an air of tenderness mingled with sorrow, he withdrew.</p>

<p>Madame de Rubine, who beheld these emotions of severe distress
with inexpressible concern, besought her to receive, and consider
with gratitude, the salutary and valuable advice of the holy father.
'Remember, my child,' added she, with the look and accents of a
departing saint, 'that this separation, though to us mournful and
afflictive, is the will of the Most High God, and that we ought to
submit without a murmur to his unerring Providence! Let us then,
instead of arrogating to ourselves the right of disputing his mercy
and equity, prove, by the most implicit obedience to his divine
decrees, that we are not unworthy to be called his servants; and give
me reason to believe, my Julie, that the lessons of fortitude, which
I have so frequently given you, have not been delivered in vain.</p>

<p>'I leave you, my darling alone and, almost unfriended, in a world
in which you will find much occasion for the exercise of this
estimable virtue, The only relation you will have left is Madame
Laronne; and though for many reasons she is not the person I should
have selected from all others as the guardian of my child, yet as she
is the only surviving sister of your father, it cannot easily be
dispensed with. Let me then endeavour, if possible by timely advice,
to prevent the evils which might otherwise ensue from the precepts
and example of one who may probably have some virtues, but who I
fear, has many follies. I must now, my love, enter upon a subject
that appears at this crisis more than usually important: I must
demand from you, my Julie, before I leave you for ever, a solemn
promise, upon the performance of which depends both your temporal and
eternal welfare.'</p>

<p>Here the meek sufferer paused, as if unable to proceed, whilst her
daughter, with an assumed resignation, that shaded but imperfectly
the emotions of her soul, assured her, that whatever was the nature
of the request, she was prepared to comply with it, and would
instantly ratify her resolve with the most solemn vow.</p>

<p>'You are not, my dear, sufficiently aware,' resumed Madame de
Rubine, 'of the little respect that is paid to the religious, and
even the moral, duties of life, amid the dissipation and gaiety of
the world. Madame Laronne is a woman of rank, and undoubtedly from a
motive of kindness, but, I fear, a mistaken one, will introduce you
into the most brilliant and fashionable circles. She will also
desire, in the common acceptation of the term, to see you
advantageously married; but, though desirous of leading you to
happiness, she may unfortunately mistake the way. In her choice of a
husband for you, religion, I am convinced, will be only a secondary
consideration, and a disagreement of sentiment in this important
affair has been the occasion of innumerable evils. Promise me then,
my Julie, that whatever arguments may be employed to dissuade you
from your purpose, never to unite yourself to a man, however
estimable in point of morals, and however splendid in situation, who
does not exactly agree with you in all the articles of the Catholic
Faith. Say then, my child, that whatever trials and temporal
distresses this resolution may involve you in, that nothing shall
prevail upon you to marry a Protestant.'</p>

<p>Julie, who equally revered with her mother the doctrines of the
Church of Rome, and whose zeal in the cause of her persuasion was not
less animated, readily acquiesced in the proposal; and, having
assured her dying parent in a manner the most solemn and impressive
that she should consider this promise as sacred and inviolable, an
exquisite expression of joy irradiated for a moment the features of
Madame de Rubine, who, having uttered a few words as in prayer, sunk
upon the pillow, and her spirits being greatly exhausted, fell into a
slumber, from which she awoke unrefreshed and in a few hours breathed
her last!</p>

<p>Immediately on the decease of Madame de Rubine, the friar, who had
attended her as confessor, came with a consolatory message and
invitation to Julie from the prioress of an adjacent convent; but
this nothing could prevail upon her to accept till the funereal rites
were over, and she had paid every possible respect to the memory of
her lamented relative.</p>

<p>In a few days the body of the deceased was entombed by the side of
St Gerard, in the chapel of the chateau, which was accompanied to the
place of interment by a few of the domestics, and Julie, who attended
as chief mourner.</p>

<p>Mindful of the lesson of resignation that her mother had so
recently delivered, she attempted to appear tranquil; but the effort
was ineffectual, and the service, which was pronounced with peculiar
solemnity, was frequently interrupted with her convulsive sobs.</p>

<p>The next day, at the request of Father Austin, the confessor, she
was conducted to the convent of St Catherine, and introduced to the
superior of the order, who received her with much apparent tenderness
and concern, which Julie attempted to repay with the modest effusions
of her gratitude.</p>

<p>The prioress, having been informed by the monk of the forlorn
situation in which she was left, and also of the losses she had
lately sustained, took the earliest opportunity of offering her an
asylum until she could be more eligibly accommodated; and when she
beheld her, endeavoured, with the most affecting gentleness of
demeanour, to alleviate her affliction.</p>

<p>There was an air of solemnity in the manners of the superior, but
it was tempered with mildness; and though the language of her
countenance was expressive of sorrow, it was sorrow softened by
resignation, reflection, and piety.</p>

<p>After a week's residence in the convent, Mademoiselle de Rubine,
by the desire of her new friend, wrote to Madame Laronne, her aunt,
to acquaint her with the death of her mother, and to inform her under
whose care she was placed; requesting likewise to know, whether she
was to remain under the maternal protection of the prioress, or to
repair to Italy.</p>

<p>In a few weeks she received an answer from her aunt, in which she
expressed her concern for the death of her sister, and also declared
her intention of visiting the Netherlands for the purpose of
conveying her into Italy, which address was concluded with many
affectionate acknowledgments of unalterable regard.</p>

<p>The promises of support which this letter afforded, were
thankfully and cordially received by the lovely Julie; yet the idea
of being launched into a world, which she had been taught to believe
was pregnant with vice and immorality, filled her with apprehension
and uneasiness; and made her ardently wish that, instead of attending
her aunt into Italy, she might be permitted to remain in the
cloister, sheltered in the bosom of Religion and Virtue from the
evils that threatened her in the world.</p>

<p>Soon after her admission into the convent, she attached herself to
one of the sisters, whose name was Ursula. She was much older than
herself, and from her many estimable qualities, had been recommended
to her as a companion by the superior. In the society of this amiable
nun, and that of her noble protectress, Julie became composed, and at
times somewhat animated. Attentively observing the rules of the
order, she arose early to matins, and as regularly attended at
vespers, whilst the intermediate hours were chiefly engaged in
assisting the prioress in embroidery, or other elegant employments,
who expressed herself much gratified with her performance, and
complimented her highly on the evident superiority of her taste.</p>

<p>After some time had elapsed in this calm, uninterrupted
retirement, whose solitude was so entirely congenial to her present
frame of spirits, a carriage and splendid retinue appeared at the
gate, and announced the arrival of Madame Laronne.</p>

<p>Julie was walking in the shrubbery with sister Ursula and another
lady, who was a novice, when she received an order to attend upon her
aunt in the apartment of the superior.</p>

<p>Madame Laronne met her with many flattering appellations; but
there was nothing of that genuine sensibility in her demeanour which
communicates itself to the heart. When she condescended to listen to
the plaint of misery, and to wipe away the tear from the cheek of the
unfortunate, it was evidently more to display her own fancied
superiority, than for the sake of experiencing that pure and
heartfelt satisfaction, which in amiable minds accompanies the
performance of a generous action.</p>

<p>After having continued a few weeks in the convent, which time was
employed in settling the affairs of St Gerard, she desired her niece
to prepare for the intended journey, whom she rallied on her
partiality to that sequestered retreat, and her strict adherence to
the rules of the institution. Julie, having obtained permission to
visit once more the grave of her beloved parents, which she again
watered with her tears, took an affectionate leave of the prioress,
her favourite Ursula, and the rest of the sisterhood; and placing
herself in the carriage with Madame Laronne, they were driven from
the gate.</p>

<p>It was in vain that Julie attempted to conceal her emotions when
she cast her eyes, for the last time, upon that hospitable mansion,
which had so humanely afforded her shelter; she, however, exerted her
most strenuous endeavours to appear cheerful; but these efforts were
painful, and sometimes ineffectual; and Madame Laronne condemned that
sensibility, which having never felt, she knew not how to
compassionate.</p>

<h3>Chapter 6</h3>

<pre>
Far to the right where Apennine ascends.
Bright as the summer Italy extends.
Its upland sloping decks the mountains side.
Woods over woods in gay theatric pride.
While oft some temple's mould'ring top between.
With venerable grandeur marks the scene.
--GOLDSMITH
</pre>

<p>The rich and variegated landscape that every way presented itself,
had a happy but transient effect upon the spirits of Julie, and for
some time diverted her mind from the painful contemplation of her own
misfortunes. Amidst the vast and magnificent scenery arose mountains
crested with pines, in high cultivation and verdure, some of which
seemed retiring, and to have formed themselves into the most
picturesque lines, whose slopes were decorated with mosses, tinted
with a variety of hues, which gave a sylvan richness to their
surface.</p>

<p>The rapidity of their motion occasioned a hasty succession of
beautiful imagery; sometimes a venerable abbey, half mouldering into
ruins, reared its majestic head above the thick foliage of the wood,
and sometimes in the meek hour of evening, or before the sun had
risen upon the eminences, the shepherd-boy, as he led his flock from
the valleys, would lean upon his staff, and listen to the chaunted
hymn, or early matins, as the sound floated upon the gale along the
surface of the water.</p>

<p>As they arrived near the mansion of Madame Laronne, the magical
influence of the picturesque scenery was at an end; and as Julie
fixed her eyes upon the turrets of the chateau, which were gilded
with the last rays of the retiring sun, a thousand melancholy
presages arose in her mind, and awakened sensations of grief and
terror.</p>

<p>The chateau was situated on an extensive lawn between two
mountains, which opened to a clear and beautiful lake; the banks of
the river, the lawn, and the hills, were clothed in the finest and
richest verdure, whilst the whole of the scenery appeared capable of
the highest improvement; but nothing like taste was displayed in the
design. The mansion, which was lofty and extensive, had been formerly
a fortified castle, but was now modernized with the addition of two
large wings; but neither the building nor the grounds surrounding it
discovered any traces of taste or judgment. The walks were gloomy and
ill contrived, no elevations or windings displayed to advantage the
grandeur of the mountains; nor did this appear to have been the
intention of the artist, as they seemed to have been originally
designed to lead as avenues to some fanciful but inelegant
structures, which terminated their prospect.</p>

<p>When Madame Laronne and Julie had alighted, they were conducted
into a spacious saloon, which was richly ornamented with the most
costly furniture and valuable paintings. The ostentatious
magnificence of every thing around formed a striking contrast with
that unadorned and charming simplicity which characterized the former
dwelling of Julie, so congenial to her feelings, and that of her
mother.</p>

<p>Madame Laronne, anxiously displaying all the grandeur that
surrounded her, expected from her niece that tribute of applause
which she considered she had a right to demand; but was evidently
mortified when Julie's countenance discovered nothing of either
pleasure or surprise as she contemplated the splendour of her new
abode.</p>

<p>After partaking of a slight collation with her aunt, Julie gained
permission to retire to her chamber; and a servant having conducted
her up a winding staircase, and through a long suite of rooms,
informed her which was her apartment.</p>

<p>It was a large half-furnished room, situated in the ancient part
of the edifice, hung with tapestry, and ornamented with the ancient
portraits of the family; she was, however, too much fatigued, and too
spiritless to examine them, and hastily undressing, retired to her
bed.</p>

<p>In the morning she arose much earlier than the rest of the family,
and amused herself for some time with observing the pictures. The
greater part of them were allegorical, but in general ill-designed
and executed, much damaged by neglect, and the colouring so
materially injured by time, that the figures were scarcely
perceptible.</p>

<p>When she had gazed for a considerable time upon these relics of
ancient greatness, she opened the high Gothic casement of her window,
which was adorned, on the upper part, with a variety of saints,
crucifixes, and other holy devices, and cast her eyes over the fine
extent of landscape with the most pleasurable emotions. The sun was
just rising, but had not yet power sufficient to entirely dissipate
the mists that had veiled the summits of the mountains; yet some
parts of them were tinged with its faint radiance, which shed an
effusion of the most soft and delicate tints.</p>

<p>Cheered and animated by the objects that were presented to her
view, she wished to ramble through the grounds that she might examine
more attentively the fine features of nature, and enjoy the first
charms of the morning. Having unclosed the door, she listened for a
few moments to hear if any of the family were stirring; but finding
all was silent, and believing that none of the servants were at
present arisen, she closed it, and taking a small volume of
Metastasio from her pocket, sat down to read.</p>

<p>In about an hour she again opened the door, and hearing footsteps
upon the stairs, ventured to proceed. It was Madame Laronne's woman,
who, having conducted her to the outward gate, informed her which was
the avenue that led to the principal part of the gardens. After
walking slowly and thoughtfully through rows of pine and chestnut,
the scene opened into a circular plain, which was decorated with a
collection of statues and vases, neither of which possessed a
sufficient degree of merit to invite observation.</p>

<p>Having taken an extensive ramble through the most considerable
part of the grounds, she began to fear she had been absent too long,
and returning rapidly to the chateau, found Madame Laronne in the
breakfast-room impatiently awaiting her arrival.</p>

<p>After much uninteresting conversation on subjects little
calculated to bestow pleasure on a refined and cultivated mind, which
were introduced by the lady of the mansion at once to impress her
niece with an idea of her importance, and to make her feel more
forcibly her own dependant situation, Julie now, more than ever
inclined to seek for consolation in solitude, retired to her room,
and having indulged in a flood of tears, which she found it
impossible to restrain, endeavoured, by serious reflection, to arm
herself with courage to endure the evils of her destiny with becoming
firmness. The example of her excellent mother, and the precepts she
had delivered with her dying breath, recurred continually to her
thoughts, tending to reassure and strengthen her mind, so as to
prepare it to withstand the attacks of misfortune.</p>

<p>Having regained, in some measure, that enviable serenity of soul,
which never long abandons the virtuous, she left her retirement, and
was proceeding leisurely through the gallery, when the stopping of a
carriage, announcing the arrival of visitors, arrested her steps, and
determined her to return again to her apartment, and await their
dismission, lest she should be obliged to attend them in the
saloon.</p>

<p>In about an hour, on hearing the carriage roll from the door, she
ventured to descend, and found Madame Laronne alone, and in high
spirits, having been honoured with a visit from the Contessa di
Romilini, from whom she had received an invitation for that day in
the next week to a fete; which condescension, she informed Julie, was
politely extended to herself, at the same time observing that all the
nobility in the neighbourhood were to be present on the occasion, and
that it would be necessary to prepare habits immediately suitable to
the nature of the entertainment, and the company of which it was to
be composed.</p>

<p>'But let me tell you, niece,' resumed Madame Laronne, 'that you
must not indulge yourself in these imaginary distresses when you are
introduced to circles of fashion; that pensiveness of demeanour,
which you believe to be so fascinating, will be thought not only
unseasonable but ridiculous, and will be considered in a young woman
as a piece of unpardonable affectation. Besides, this extreme languor
which you fancy so becoming and so amiable, if allowed to become
habitual, will render you unfit for the society of those who may be a
means of advancing your fortunes. Who do you suppose will think of
addressing a girl who can do nothing but weep and sigh? Men in
general are not partial to people of this cast, and indeed they are
only fit to be the companions of groves and fountains.'</p>

<p>'If my misfortunes, Madame,' replied Julie, meekly, 'have, as you
have justly observed, rendered me unfit for the society of the
fashionable part of the world, I must solicit you to dispense with my
attendance, as there is but little probability of my being able to
conduct myself either to your satisfaction or my own.'</p>

<p>'I am sorry to find, niece,' continued Madame Laronne, 'a degree
of obstinacy in your disposition, which I was not prepared to expect;
but so long as you are under my protection, I am in some measure
answerable for your conduct: I therefore think it right to inform
you, that I shall expect, on your part, the most implicit obedience.
Though your ideas of propriety and mine may not exactly accord, not
to accept the invitation of the Contessa, an honour you could not
reasonably expect from a person of her rank, particularly as you was
not present at the time, would be considered not only as a deviation
from the laws of politeness, but a breach of gratitude-an error of
which I thought you people of sentiment were never to be
accused.'</p>

<p>Finding that no powers of persuasion were likely to prove
effectual, Julie silently acquiesced, and the intermediate time was
chiefly employed in preparing dresses suitable to the occasion.</p>

<p>When the expected evening arrived, which was so fondly anticipated
by Madame Laronne, they were conveyed to the chateau of the Contessa
di Romilini. It was a large magnificent structure, situated on the
brow of a hill, which commanded a rich and extensive prospect. The
architecture was a mixture of the Tuscan and Composite; the pillars,
which were remarkably lofty, were finely polished and ornamented with
a number of lamps of various colours, which being formed into the
most beautiful wreaths, had an unspeakably fine effect. The trees
that surrounded the lawn and the walks, which were long and winding,
were also fancifully adorned with a profusion of lights, and garlands
of flowers elegantly and artfully disposed, were carelessly hung upon
the branches of the larch and the laburnum. Seats were placed in the
gardens and baskets of fruits, the finest that Italy could produce,
were held by a number of beautiful girls, habited as wood-nymphs in a
style equally simple and alluring.</p>

<p>The assembly was large and brilliant; all the fashion of Turin and
its environs were present. Julie, being personally unknown to the
lady who presided, was introduced first to the Contessa, and then to
the rest of the company, who were already seated on the lawn. Nothing
could be more lovely, more interesting, than her appearance. Her
hair, which was somewhat darker than flaxen, waved upon her neck in
the most charming profusion, decorated only with pearls formed into a
garland of jessamine, which gave an air of lightness and grace
perfectly correspondent with the rest of her figure. Her long
mourning robe, which displayed to advantage the fine symmetry of her
shape, was clasped and fastened with a cestus of the same, and the
whole of her form and demeanour displayed that irresistible grace and
sweetness which the utmost eloquence of language can but feebly
describe. Every eye was fixed upon the beautiful stranger, who,
unconscious of her powers of attraction, averted her blushing cheek
from the gaze of admiration with evident distress.</p>

<p>All the company being assembled, and the music in readiness, the
dance began. Julie was led out by Signor Vescolini, the only son of
the Conte della Croisse, and Madame Laronne by the Marchese de
Montferrat.</p>

<p>In a few hours, the evening being far advanced, they repaired to
the saloon, where a banquet was prepared, chiefly composed of dried
fruits, cream, and sweetmeats.</p>

<p>Elated beyond measure at the preference shewn her by the Marchese,
and anxious to cultivate an acquaintance so flattering to her
ambition, Madame Laronne gave him a general invitation to visit her
at her chateau, in which his relation, Signor Vescolini, was
included, whose marked attentions to her niece were beheld with
secret satisfaction.</p>

<p>It was late when the party separated for the night; yet she left
with regret an entertainment which had, as was seldom the case, more
than answered her most sanguine expectations. The solicitude of her
partner, aided by her own vanity, had deluded her into a thousand
inconsistences. She reflected upon her beauty with triumph, without
considering that, though once fascinating, it was beauty in the wane,
and was in idea already a Marchesa.</p>

<p>Her captivating niece, who had formed no very flattering hopes of
the evening's amusement, experienced more satisfaction than she
believed it could produce, and felt gratified with the attention she
received, without one spark of vanity being excited in her bosom.</p>

<p>On the morrow, by mutual agreement, the Marchese de Montferrat and
the Signor Viscolini waited upon the ladies at their chateau, to
inquire into the state of their healths after the fatigue of the
preceding evening. As the Signor addressed himself to Mademoiselle de
Rubine, there was an air of respectful tenderness in his deportment
which did not elude the observation of her aunt, who would probably
have felt somewhat mortified at the preference thus evidently shewn
to her dependant, had not the conversation of the Marchese been
chiefly directed to herself.</p>

<p>The remains of a fine person were still visible in Madame Laronne,
notwithstanding the form which Nature had bestowed upon her, was
continually distorted with unpardonable affectation. Having but just
entered her fortieth year, she still retained a sufficient portion of
beauty to attract regard, though the pains she employed to display
and improve it, too frequently counteracted its effects.</p>

<p>Dress was her favourite occupation, which she studied as a
science; but a false taste was perceptible in her choice of attire a
dazzling and ill judged finery, which ever renders less lovely the
most delicate forms, being usually substituted in the room of that
attractive simplicity which indicates a refined and elegant mind.</p>

<p>As the morning was fine, a walk in the gardens was proposed and
acceded to, during which ramble Julie was compelled, with a slight
degree of uneasiness, to endure the increasing attentions of Signor
Vescolini, which she feared would not escape the penetration of her
aunt, who would probably on her return rally her upon a subject,
which the present tone of her spirits would render insupportable; and
which determined her to absent herself on his next visit.</p>

<p>It was late in the day before the Marchese and the Signor arose to
depart, when Madame Laronne, who in their presence had exhausted all
the graces of her eloquence, again reminded them of her former
invitation, which she desired them to consider as a general one; and
having, with a gracious smile particularly directed to the Marchese,
repeated her adieus, attended them to the gate.</p>

<p>Glad to be thus released from the society of her new acquaintance,
Julie hastened from the room, that by this means she might escape the
scrutinizing glances of her aunt, which beamed nothing of feminine
tenderness, and indulge the sadness of her feelings in the solitude
of her closet. In spite of every effort to the contrary, she too
often reverted to the past; and when she compared her former
felicity, when blessed with the counsel and society of her parents
with the forlornness of her present situation, the poignancy of her
affliction was scarcely supportable, and tears, that refused to be
suppressed, fell fast upon her cheek. Once nurtured, protected, and
caressed in the bosom of maternal affection, now consigned to the
care of a haughty relation, who, notwithstanding her former
professions, seemed to feel nothing of genuine regard, nor even the
sentiment of pity for her misfortunes, she was lost in these
melancholy reflections, when the loud tone of the dinner-bell
summoned her into the dining-parlour, where Madame Laronne, with more
than her accustomed dignity, was seated to receive her. As soon as
the cloth was withdrawn, and the servants dismissed, she began, after
a short preparatory address, to congratulate her niece upon the
conquest she had made over the young Signor Vescolini. Julie blushed,
but remained silent.</p>

<p>'His family and connexions,' resumed Madame Laronne, 'are
unexceptionable; and though sanguine expectations are too frequently
founded on error, we may sometimes innocently indulge them. At
present his attentions may be directed to no other object than that
of momentary amusement; but if you receive them with due gratitude
and humility, it is possible it may terminate fortunately.'</p>

<p>Disconcerted at these hasty and indelicate effusions, Julie was at
first unprepared for a reply, whilst her aunt, who construed this
silent embarrassment into joy for such unexpected good fortune, began
to enlarge upon the subject, endeavouring at the same time to
contaminate the pure principles of her heart with the precepts which
had infected her own.</p>

<p>As soon as Mademoiselle de Rubine could command courage enough to
answer, she assured Madame Laronne that, however eligible such a
connexion might appear in the eyes of the world, she was convinced
she could never descend to the meanness of accepting an alliance in
which her heart had no interest, merely for the sake of attaining
that elevation of rank and precedence which she had been taught to
consider as unimportant, and which was only to be obtained by the
humiliating circumstances she had mentioned; not omitting to observe,
that, however the attentions of the Signor might appear to be
directed to herself, those enviable distinctions to which she had
recurred must eventually preclude every idea of the kind. 'Can I,
Madame,' resumed she, raising her soft blue eyes from the ground,
which were half obscured with her tears, 'submit to the meanness of
dissimulation for the sake of ripening into affection what may be
nothing more than momentary admiration? Can I throw myself upon the
generosity of a family who, from motives of ambition, may reject me,
and doubly despise me for my presumption in entering it? Rather let
me endure the severest mortification that neglect and penury can
inflict, than lessen myself in my own estimation, and by yielding to
the erroneous prejudices of the multitude, justly incur the censure
of the most worthy and discerning.'</p>

<p>'I little thought, niece,' resumed Madame Laronne, 'that when, in
consideration of your unprotected youth, I condescended to take you
under my care, of the difficulty attending so important a charge, or
that obstinacy and caprice were so strongly featured in your
character. Had the assiduities of the Signor been displeasing to me
you would have been eloquent in his praise, and would have discovered
a thousand amiable qualities which have now escaped unnoticed.'</p>

<p>'I hope, Madame,' continued Julie, mildly, 'that you have had no
reason to pass this severe censure upon my conduct, as, should I ever
form an attachment, my happiness will be materially augmented by your
approbation of my choice.'</p>

<p>'But this is not an affair,' replied Madame Laronne, raising her
voice still higher, 'in which we are likely to agree. You have, or
pretend to have, an aversion to those things which only make marriage
desirable, at least in the opinion of the reasonable part of the
world; but I am sorry to add, niece, that you are a very romantic
girl, and when it is too late, may possibly repent your error. Your
mother had many strange prejudices as well as yourself, and it would
have been much to her advantage if she had been enabled to conquer
them.'</p>

<p>'If I imitate her example, Madame,' returned Julie, wiping an
obtruding tear from her cheek, 'which I hope will ever be the rule of
my conduct, I shall not prove myself unworthy of your
protection.'</p>

<p>Madame Laronne was preparing to reply, but her lovely dependant,
being willing to escape from so unpleasant a conference,
precipitately withdrew, leaving her offended relation to vent her
anger in secret. The reflection cast upon the character of her
mother, whom she considered as the brightest pattern of female
excellence, Mademoiselle de Rubine could but ill support. She had,
indeed, formed no very high opinion of Madame Laronne's tenderness,
or of the delicacy of her sentiments; but to mention this revered
parent in terms of disapprobation, convinced her that she was not
only destitute of sensibility, but of candour.</p>

<p>Not a day passed in which the Marchese de Montserrat and the
Signor Vescolini did not visit the chateau. The assiduities of the
latter increased; but, though Julie admired his person, which was
cast in the finest mould, and was by no means insensible to his
numerous accomplishments, he was unable to interest her affections.
His continual solicitude displeased her, and the levity with which he
treated the articles of the Romish Church, from whose tenets he had
recently dissented, determined her to preserve an apparent
indifference of deportment towards him, which she hoped, by offending
his pride, would eventually terminate his visits.</p>

<p>Signor Vescolini, having received his education in Germany, had
embraced the Reformed Religion through the doctrines of Luther; and
Julie, after having been for some time deceived by the artifice of
Madame Laronne respecting his religious opinions, was convinced, by a
conversation with the Marchese, that he had relinquished what he
termed his former errors; and owing to the native pliability of his
disposition, had been prevailed upon, by the adherents of this
celebrated reformer, to embrace Protestantism.</p>

<p>A few days after this discovery she was summoned into the
apartment of her aunt, who informed her, to her inexpressible
uneasiness, that the Signor had made a formal declaration of his
passion, and moreover had solicited her interference in his behalf.
Perfectly aware of the consequence of this sudden and indiscrete
avowal, Julie started, and appeared much agitated.</p>

<p>'You have certainly been peculiarly fortunate,' continued Madame
Laronne, regarding her attentively as she spoke; 'and,
notwithstanding the unjustifiable caprice and insensibility you
discovered on a former conversation, I cannot believe you mean
seriously to reject such honourable proposals. I would feign not
imagine it possible you could hesitate for a moment. How many young
women have been obliged to accept of inferior alliances, who may
boast of an equal share of beauty and discretion!'</p>

<p>'I am sorry to affirm, Madame,' replied Julie, hesitatingly, 'that
there are reasons which must subject me to the painful necessity of
refusing my obedience to your and the Signor's requests. The
religious opinions of the person you have proposed to me as a husband
are repugnant to my own, and a want of concord in that important
article must ever prove hostile to domestic happiness.'</p>

<p>'So you would actually decline a connexion with one of the first
families in Italy,' returned Madame Laronne, indignantly, 'because
the person who addresses you, happens not to be so bigoted and so
ridiculous as yourself?'</p>

<p>Julie observing that he might be equally bigoted, even though his
principles were erroneous, ventured to disclose the motive which had
instigated her to this sudden rejection of a suit, she candidly
acknowledged a mind less unambitious than her own, unbiassed by more
weighty arguments, might have acceded to with pleasure; not doubting
but when her aunt was thoroughly acquainted with the whole of the
circumstance, that she would finally applaud her conduct.</p>

<p>A promise, administered in so solemn a manner to her last and
dearest friend, in the moment of approaching dissolution, appeared to
the reflecting mind of the dutiful Julie as an unsurmountable
obstacle; and she could scarcely conceive it possible that Madame
Laronne, however destitute of religion herself, would presume to
descant upon the subject with her accustomed levity.</p>

<p>But she soon discovered that this fondly cherished hope was
delusive, and that little was to be expected from the lenity of her
offended relation, who perceiving that the gentle measures, as she
termed them, which had hitherto been adopted, were not likely to
avail, threatened to have recourse to more violent ones; not
neglecting to assure her, that more misfortunes would inevitably
ensue from a strict adherence to so ridiculous a vow, than from an
actual breach of it. She then expatiated with equal success upon the
consequences of indulged superstition, and the indispensable
necessity of endeavouring to liberate the mind from the shackles of
vulgar prejudices, which, she concluded with remarking, was
considered by the discerning as the irrefragable testimony of an
exalted mind.</p>

<p>Fearful of irritating her pride by a continued avowal of
sentiments so dissimilar to her own, Julie did not meditate a reply;
but remained with her eyes fastened upon the ground, whilst her cheek
was one moment suffused with vermilion, and the next faded into the
paleness of the lily, as actuated by the revolving passions of her
mind.</p>

<p>Madame Laronne, flattering herself that her niece was
reconsidering the subject, and that the arguments she had employed in
defence of her favourite hypothesis, were recalling her to
rationality, pursued the discourse; and to add more weight to what
she had before advanced, stated the possibility of the Signor's
reformation being effected, should he fail in making her a convert to
his own creed, providing his attachment survived the matrimonial
engagement; intimating that whatever persuasion they embraced, it was
unimportant, so long as it was mutual.</p>

<p>Julie, finding her aunt was falling into a new error, which, if
not timely prevented, might be productive of fresh evils, declared,
that her resolution, however singular, was unalterable, and that she
desired nothing more ardently than to have an opportunity of verbally
convincing the Signor of her determination.</p>

<p>Astonished at the firmness of character this avowal exhibited, and
mortified that her niece remained unsubdued by her arguments, and
unmoved by her eloquence, Madame Laronne descended from persuasion to
invective, threatening her with the most arbitrary proceedings if
gentle ones continued inefficacious: then informing her, that if she
consented to what would contribute to her own happiness, she was
fortunate in having a relation who would guide her to the attainment
of it; but if she refused, that relation would compel her to accept
the only conditions which would eventually secure it. She darted an
indignant look at the affrighted Julie, and withdrew.</p>

</pre>

<p>The severity which Julie experienced from Madame Laronne, and the
unceasing visits of Vescolini, who seemed determined to persevere in
his addresses, had a visible effect upon her health; yet believing
that he was not thoroughly acquainted with her resolution, she
anxiously awaited an opportunity of convincing him that she meant
positively to reject the alliance, hoping that, when he was able to
ascertain the primary cause of this conduct, he would be less
disposed to continue his persecutions. But she knew not sufficiently
the character of her lover when she cherished this delusive idea.
Young, sanguine, and enterprising, every new obstacle increased his
ardour, and, regardless of the consequences of such a proceeding, he
was secretly persuaded that nothing but death should prevent the
accomplishment of his design.</p>

<p>Finding that all hopes, founded on his generosity of sentiment,
were likely to prove abortive, since no honourable motive could
instigate him to abandon the pursuit, she began to lose all esteem
for his character, and to reflect upon this authoritative mode of
procedure with mingled disgust and aversion.</p>

<p>The Marchese, whose attentions to Madame Laronne were less marked
than on the commencement of their acquaintance, was still a constant
visitor at the chateau; and Julie observed that he was now become
unusually thoughtful without in the least suspecting the cause,
though in conversation he was visibly abstracted from the subject in
which he had engaged, and he frequently gazed upon her with a degree
of silent and tender earnestness that heightened her distress. This
change, though it might have been easily penetrated by an
uninterested spectator, was unmarked by Madame Laronne, who was too
much blinded by an excess of unprecedented vanity to imagine that the
Marchese could behold any other than herself with an eye of
approbation.</p>

<p>As Julie's indisposition now daily increased, she spent many hours
in her apartment, which was one of the most substantial comforts
allowed her under her augmenting afflictions. She was sometimes
fortunately excused from attending upon her aunt's parties, which
were frequent and uninteresting, and declined, as much as possible,
all visits of ceremony.</p>

<p>One evening, Madame Laronne being engaged at a route, to which the
Marchese was also invited, Julie was left alone in her absence to
meditate upon her own misfortunes, as well as to endeavour to arm her
mind as much as she was able against the accumulating adversities of
her fate.</p>

<p>As soon as her haughty protectress had left the chateau, she took
a long and solitary walk along the margin of the lake. It was a still
and beautiful evening; every object seemed to repose in uninterrupted
silence and tranquillity. The sun, retiring from the horizon, was
setting beyond the distant hills. Not a bird broke the stillness of
the night; not a breeze disturbed the universal calm of nature; not a
sound was borne upon the air, save a bell from an adjacent convent,
which was solemnly tolling for vespers, 'that the day, which had been
ushered in with blessings, might be closed with the effusions of
gratitude'.</p>

<p>As she gazed upon that venerable pile, which was tinged with the
last ray of the retiring orb, she lamented she had not been consigned
to a similar abode, and reverted with tender regret to that in which
she had found so hospitable an asylum. Having yielded to a flood of
tears, she endeavoured to recall her mind from these painful
contemplations; but the attempt was inefficacious; the cruelty of her
aunt, the perseverance of Vescolini, and her own defenceless
situation, were invincible bars to returning peace.</p>

<p>The moon, now sailing majestically through the concave, was
shedding her mildest light upon the surface of the water, which
warned her of the approach of night, and precipitated her steps
towards the mansion; but not without an intention of extending her
walk along the gardens in this serene hour of moon-light.</p>

<p>Having reached the chateau, she took her lute, which had lain
neglected in one corner of her apartment, and repairing to a grotto
that terminated one of the principal avenues, played her service to
the virgin.</p>

<p>As the last notes, which were warbled with a peculiar taste and
sweetness, died into cadence, she fancied she distinguished the sound
of advancing footsteps, and willing to discover the intruder, hastily
arose from the place; but not being able to discern any one, and
finding all was again silent, she believed it to be only an illusion,
and again resumed her seat. The moon, now shining with redoubled
lustre, deepened the contrasting gloom of the walks, which were so
effectually shaded from its benign influence by the protuberant
branches of the chestnut, that her beams could only play on the tops
of the boughs. Again she thought she heard the approach of footsteps,
and a faint rustling among the leaves, and starting from her seat,
hurried to the door of the grotto, where she beheld, in the same
instant, the shadow of plumes waving upon the grass. Believing it
could be no other than Vescolini, an emotion of terror took
possession of her frame, and, without waiting to be assured whether
she was right or not in the conjecture, she quitted the recess.</p>

<p>It was the Marchese de Montferrat, who, having learned from Madame
Laronne that Julie was prevented by indisposition from joining the
party, to which he had repaired in the hope of meeting with her, had
suddenly retreated from this scene of splendour and gaiety soon after
its commencement, and had wandered about in pursuit of her. Finding
she was not at the chateau, he had rambled for a considerable time
along the grounds; and being still unsuccessful in his undertaking,
was alarmed lest any thing had happened, till he was at once relieved
from the anguish of fear and suspense by the wild harmony of her
song, to which he had listened attentively with the most pleasurable
emotions till the sound died away upon the air, and was succeeded by
a mournful silence.</p>

<p>Julie, being assured that the Marchese was of Madame Laronne's
party, was not less surprised than agitated at this intrusion; and
supposing that some material occurrence had occasioned it, eagerly
demanded if any thing had happened to her aunt.</p>

<p>Having dissipated her apprehensions, and made an inquiry
concerning her health, he began, in a stile at once the most
seductive and impressive, to assure her, that he had long sedulously
sought for an opportunity of soliciting her attention on a subject
the most serious and important.</p>

<p>After this preparatory address, he proceeded to inform her that
Vescolini, contrary to the nice dictates of honour, intended to have
recourse to the most infamous mode of conduct, if she refused to
yield to his entreaties; and that Madame Laronne was so earnestly
engaged in his interest, that every thing was to be dreaded without
timely interference. This, he added, had influenced him to quit
rather precipitately the society into which he had entered, as the
probability of her being sacrificed to a man who had proved himself
not only destitute of religion, but of honour, was insupportable and
dreadful.</p>

<p>He then endeavoured, with all the eloquence he could command, to
prevail upon her to accept his protection, since the means of
preventing the machinations of her enemies could only be accomplished
by instant flight; which arguments he attempted to enforce by an
avowal of his regard, and a declaration that his life would be
joyfully hazarded in her defence.</p>

<p>Julie, who had listened to this discourse with mingled confusion
and astonishment, replied with more warmth than was natural to her
disposition, but with the firmness inseparable from rectitude, and
the delicacy peculiar to her sex; which tended to convince the
Marchese that nothing could induce her to rush voluntarily into an
act of imprudence, which might hereafter be attended with the
severest remorse; and, though she acknowledged the high sense she
entertained of the honour he was anxious to confer, desired, if he
valued her esteem, he would desist from farther solicitation. She was
then hastening towards the chateau, when the Marchese, throwing
himself at her feet, again besought her attention.</p>

<p>'Say but that you pity me,' continued he, respectfully taking her
hand, which she instantly withdrew, 'that you forgive this premature
declaration, and promise that no arguments shall persuade you to
bestow yourself upon a man who has proved himself unworthy of your
favour.'</p>

<p>Julie, having given him an answer sufficiently satisfactory
concerning Vescolini, whom she now began to reflect upon with
increasing indignation, quickened her steps towards the mansion, and
had just reached the edge of the lawn, pursued by the Marchese, when
Madame Laronne's carriage appeared at the gate.</p>

<p>Alarmed at her unexpected arrival, she ran to the side of the
carriage, and inquired if she was indisposed, or what had occasioned
her return, with that affectionate tenderness of deportment natural
to her character, whilst the Marchese endeavoured to escape
unobserved through the vista, which opened on the lawn, till
perceiving he was already discovered by the person whose notice he
was visibly anxious to elude, he was compelled to emerge from his
obscurity.</p>

<p>Madame Laronne, having observed an alteration in the looks of her
imaginary lover, when she had mentioned the indisposition of
Mademoiselle de Rubine, and having also remarked that soon afterwards
he had suddenly disappeared, began to feel herself neglected by the
only individual in the company whose attention she was anxious to
secure, and by comparing the present with the past, and reverting to
some little occurrences which her vanity had prevented her from
considering before, suspected her niece as the cause. She had a
presentiment that he was with her during her continuance at the
route, and being determined to ascertain the truth of the surmise,
had pleaded a sudden indisposition as an excuse to return to her
chateau.</p>

<p>Confused and chagrined at this discovery, the Marchese, though not
often off his guard, was unable to acquit himself with his accustomed
address; and after inquiring into the state of her health as he led
her from the carriage, which was answered with an air of unusual
formality, an awkward silence ensued. Conscious of the integrity and
purity of her conduct, Julie met the angry glances of her aunt with
patient firmness, who exerted herself to conceal her mortification
whilst in the presence of the Marchese.</p>

<p>As soon as he had retired, Julie perceiving from the countenance
of Madame Laronne, that she had but little to expect from the candour
and clemency of her offended relative, sat for some moments in silent
dread. 'Your taste for solitude is at last well accounted for,' cried
the irritated lady, darting a look of severity at her innocent niece;
'I little thought when I consented to take you under my protection,
that my kindness would have been repaid with such flagrant
ingratitude; but since the liberty I have allowed you in the disposal
of your time has induced you to form assignations which may lead to
the most dangerous consequences, I am resolved to prevent the bad
effects of a conduct which prudence would blush to reflect upon, to
hasten your marriage with the Signor; granting you a month only to
conquer your ridiculous scruples, during which interval I shall
insist upon you confining yourself to your chamber, excepting the
evenings when you will be permitted to have a private conference with
your lover.'</p>

<p>Finding that no powers of persuasion were likely to soften the
invincible cruelty of Madame Laronne, Julie retired from her
presence, and, after some time spent in devotion with more than usual
earnestness, she endeavoured to find comfort in repose. But the
subject of her dreams had a reference to the past; her sleep was
transient and disturbed, for fearful and uneasy visions fleeted
before her fancy.</p>

<p>In the morning she arose long before her accustomed hour, and cast
her eyes over her ancient and gloomy apartment, which was now become
her prison, with a painful sensation, though even this was felicity
when compared with the prospects of the future.</p>

<p>Several days were passed by Mademoiselle de Rubine in this dreary
confinement, in which time she received no message or visit from
Madame Laronne, who avoided giving her any opportunity of repeating
her entreaties. Doroth&eacute;e, one of the inferior domestics, who
had received orders to convey her food into the chamber, glanced upon
her a look of tender concern as she was performing her office, which
Julie, long unused to the language of sympathy, did not fail to
return.</p>

<p>'This is a poor forlorn looking place, Mademoiselle,' cried the
simple-hearted girl, looking fearfully around as she spread the cloth
upon the table for supper; 'I little thought Madame would have fixed
upon this for your apartment, that looks for all the world as if it
was haunted by spirits, when there are so many handsome ones in the
chateau!'</p>

<p>Julie, being awakened from her reverie by these words, which were
uttered in an accent of condolence, was going to reply, when a
message from her aunt summoned her into the saloon.</p>

<p>Weak and trembling she descended the stairs, and a glow of
resentment crimsoned her cheek, when on entering the room she beheld,
instead of Madame Laronne, the Signor Vescolini. Amazed and
disconcerted, she was hastily retreating, when he caught her hand to
prevent her retiring, and closing the door, led her to a chair. As
soon as she was seated, he repeated his former professions, lamenting
at the same time that measures, seemingly so arbitrary, could not be
dispensed with; assuring her, that when he had attained the
completion of his happiness, he would endeavour to insure her's by
the most unremitting attention to her desires; and, though he could
not so far divest himself of every thing repugnant to her
inclinations as to embrace the tenets of the Romish Church, he would
allow her the free exercise of her religion, and would engage a
confessor to attend her.</p>

<p>Julie, who rejected his proposals with dignity and energy,
informed him, that if he desired to make any alteration in her
sentiments respecting himself, that this could only be accomplished
by his desisting from further persecution, which, as her resolution
was irrevocably fixed, would be at once conducive to his honour and
her peace.</p>

<p>Pacing the room for some minutes with a perturbed air, and then
gazing wildly upon her face, he declared that nothing on earth should
alter his determination; and, though he had much rather use
persuasion than force, if one would not prove effectual, the other
must.</p>

<p>'In a fortnight from this time,' resumed he, emphatically, 'you
become my wife; and as business of a peculiar nature will detain me
from this place during the interval, I must request you will employ
it in attempting to reconcile yourself to a destiny that is
unavoidable. Madame Laronne will see you no more till the ceremony is
performed.'</p>

<p>The truth of the Marchese's assertion being now proved, Julie was
unable for the moment to utter a reply. She endeavoured to arise, but
could not; her limbs trembled her voice failed an ashy paleness
overspread her face and she sunk into a state of insensibility!</p>

<p>Vescolini, having caught her in his arms, rang the bell for some
water, which soon acted as a restorative; and wiping a tear from his
eye, uttered some incoherent expressions as he pressed her hand to
his breast, and suffered her to be conveyed from the room.</p>

<p>The next morning, her agitation being in some measure subsided,
she began to reflect seriously upon her situation, and to consider if
by any means she could prevent the success of the Signor's designs.
Her first resolve was, to send a note to Madame Laronne, to desire
she would indulge her with an interview, which intention was speedily
executed. To this an answer was returned, which was perfectly
consistent with her former conduct; it contained an assurance of the
request being granted, on her promise of acceding to the proposals of
Signor Vescolini, but on no other conditions, and a conviction that,
if she still continued to decline the alliance, she had nothing to
expect from her compassion.</p>

<p>Several days had elapsed after this event, in which time Julie was
not permitted to see any of the family except Doroth&eacute;e. During
this period of suspense, the extreme agitation of her mind so
seriously affected her health, that the rose had forsaken her cheek,
though without considerably impairing her beauty, having left in its
stead a bewitching softness of complexion, a kind of interesting
dejection, which was infinitely more charming and attractive than the
most striking animation of colour.</p>

<p>One week of that fortnight which was to seal her inevitable doom,
was now past, and still no probable means of preventing the success
of these authoritative measures appeared. To escape unassisted from
the chateau was impracticable, and to stay (in the present situation
of affairs) would be attended with unavoidable misery; yet,
possessing much sanguineness of disposition, she did not yield,
without reflection, to the despondency of the moment. Some unexpected
assistance she still hoped might be administered, though no object
was presented to her imagination to justify and confirm the
supposition.</p>

<p>This comfort, however delusive in its consequences, was cherished
as a divine emanation, and with spirits more tranquillized than
before, she partook of the evening's repast, whilst Doroth&eacute;e,
availing herself of her permission, kindled a fire in the apartment,
as the night was unusually chill; and the hollow gusts of wind,
penetrating through the crevices of the walls, which were but
partially covered with the faded and decayed tapestry, made her
shrink with cold.</p>

<p>Having drawn close to the fire, whose cheerful blaze enlivened the
gloominess of her extensive apartment, she thought in the pauses of
the wind she perceived the whispering of voices on the stairs. The
sound was indistinct; but on advancing towards the door, she easily
distinguished that of the Marchese, who, before she had time for
resistance, entered the room.</p>

<p>Alarmed at this intrusion, she uttered an involuntary scream, and
attempted to retire; but this he so resolutely opposed, that she was
compelled to desist. When he had in some degree quieted her
apprehensions, he acquainted her with the purport of his visit, which
was to convey some important and necessary intelligence respecting
the intentions of Signor Vescolini, who had determined, with the
assistance of Madame Laronne, to remove her either by force or
stratagem from the chateau at the expiration of three days, and to
oblige her to assent to the nuptials. How he had obtained this
information he seemed unwilling to disclose; but from what had
already occurred, the intimation was too probable to admit of a doubt
as to the truth of it; and the shortness of the intervening time
appeared to preclude all possibility of escape.</p>

<p>The Marchese, who beheld every movement of her soul in the
expression of her countenance, so tenderly interested himself in her
concerns, and applauded so warmly that uniform piety and rectitude of
mind which had hitherto withstood the attacks of severity and
artifice, that, though Julie continually besought him to resign her
to her destiny, she was not insensitive to the sympathy he
discovered, which she assured him would be ever gratefully retained
in her memory.</p>

<p>He then ventured to repeat his former proposals, urging the
necessity of the measure with all the arts of persuasion he could
summon to his aid, which, he added, would insure his happiness, and,
he presumed to flatter himself, her own. That, if she would consent
to accept of his protection, a carriage should be stationed at a
convenient distance from the chateau, which would convey her with all
imaginable speed to the Castello St Aubin, where the ceremony, which
was to complete his felicity, might be instantly performed.</p>

<p>Though Julie at first strenuously opposed a proceeding which, on a
cursory survey, appeared rash and imprudent, she was finally
influenced by a mode of behaviour, which, but for the circumstance of
his having forced himself into her room, was at once amiable and
respectful; and ventured to promise, if he would immediately quit the
apartment, she would reconsider his proposals, and acquaint him with
the result of her reflections on the ensuing day.</p>

<p>As soon as the Marchese had retired, Mademoiselle de Rubine being
again alone, began to ruminate in silence upon this singular
adventure. The person who was solicitous to obtain her regard, had
hitherto conducted himself in her presence with the strictest
propriety and decorum. In respect to religion he was decidedly of
that persuasion in which she had been educated, and early taught to
believe was essential both to her temporal and eternal interests. His
figure was rather agreeable to her than otherwise; in manners he was
peculiarly elegant and alluring, whilst in point of rank, which was
only a secondary consideration, it was a match which she imagined as
far transcended her merit as expectations. To escape unassisted from
the power of Vescolini was impossible, and even could it be effected,
without a protector to act in her defence, she was still liable to
insult and persecution.</p>

<p>These arguments determined her to accept the offers of the
Marchese, could she be so fortunate as to prevail upon her favourite
domestic to attend her. This being easily accomplished, she awaited
the evening, when she was to deliver her final answer to him
agreeable to her promise, with a kind of fearful impatience.</p>

<p>Madame Laronne had so carefully concealed from Mademoiselle de
Rubine her extraordinary prepossession in favour of the Marchese,
that the most distant suspicion of this partiality never occurred to
her thoughts, or she might have concluded, from the present as well
as the past, that jealousy was the foundation of this arbitrary
conduct.</p>

<p>When the time, in which her final decision was to be conveyed to
the Marchese, arrived, being anxious to spare herself the confusion
of another interview, Julie wrote a note to acquaint him with the
whole of her determination, which was carefully delivered by
Doroth&eacute;e. Another was instantly returned, informing her that a
carriage would be in readiness to receive them beyond the walls of
the mansion, at an appointed hour, on the succeeding evening.</p>

<p>The intervening time was passed by Mademoiselle de Rubine in
extreme agitation of mind; she, however, endeavoured to combat her
fears, and when the hour of their departure approached, had reasoned
herself into some degree of composure.</p>

<p>Having with much difficulty escaped from the chateau, she ran,
attended by Doroth&eacute;e, to the appointed spot; and the Marchese,
after placing them in the carriage, seated himself by their side, and
commanded the postillion to proceed.</p>

<p>In a few hours they reached the Castello St Aubin, the residence
of the Marchese, and a priest being in readiness, the nuptials were
solemnized.</p>

<p>As soon as this ceremony was performed, he acquainted Julie, that,
owing to his not having at present informed his friends of the
connexion, it was necessary for them to remove to another of his
seats till the affair should be unfolded. To this proposition Julie
readily assented, and was soon afterwards conveyed to a hunting
villa, in a very remote situation, half concealed in a wood.</p>

<p>Here the augmenting tenderness of the Marchese, aided by his
amiable and polished manners, soon ripened what was only esteem into
the most lasting affection; but the happiness of Mademoiselle de
Rubine was always of a transient nature. After the few first months
had elapsed, his attentions visibly declined; he was continually
forming excuses to absent himself, and at last nearly forsook the
retreat. He was forever engaged in parties of pleasure, in gaming,
and expensive diversions; and when he visited the villa, conducted
himself towards Julie with a chilling indifference of demeanour,
which was perceived with inexpressive uneasiness.</p>

<p>Yet still she retained some hopes that when the tender interest of
a father was united with that of a husband, his former affection
might be awakened, and his home endeared; but in this she was also
deceived; he still pleaded engagements; nor could the infantine
innocence of Enr&icirc;co withdraw him from folly and
dissipation.</p>

<p>Unable to endure the pressure of this severe and unexpected
calamity, she at last ventured to inquire of the Marchese in what way
she had been so unfortunate as to forfeit his regard, and if there
was no possible means of regaining it? But what was her grief and
astonishment when he informed her that their nuptials were not
solemnized by a priest, and that the marriage was consequently
illegal!</p>

<p>For a considerable time after she had received this intelligence
Julie was too ill to bear a removal; but as soon as her health was
sufficiently re-established, she took an eternal adieu of the
Marchese, and with the child and Doroth&eacute;e, after much fatigue
and many difficulties, repaired to the cottage on the borders of the
Lake of Geneva.</p>

<pre>
I care not, Fortune, what you from me take.
You cannot rob me of free Nature's grace;
You cannot shut the windows of the sky.
Thro' which Aurora shews her brightening face;
You cannot bar my constant feet to trace
The woods and lawns by living streams at eve;
Let health my nerves and finer fibres brace.
Of Fancy, Reason, Virtue, nought can me bereave.
--THOMSON
</pre>

<p>Several years passed in an uninterrupted tranquillity at the
castle of Elfinbach, and its peaceful inhabitants, being perfectly
reconciled to their situation, had not a wish ungratified. No
visitor, except Paoli, broke in upon their solitude, and his visits
being those of business and necessity, were hastily terminated.</p>

<p>The amiable manners of Julie, whose real name will hereafter be
disguised under that of Chamont, and the uniform sweetness of her
disposition, so endeared her to her dependants, that the domestics
were cheerful and assiduous to oblige; and as she contemplated the
happy countenances around her, she felt that delightful sensation
arising from the performance of duty, which is frequently the only
temporal reward of virtue; but is, notwithstanding, a reward so
considerable, that the mind, which has once experienced its effects,
would not exchange it for every other advantage independent of
it.</p>

<p>Ambrose, who had been long tutored in the family of the Marchese,
did not possess that openness of character which distinguished the
rest of the household. A mixture of selfishness and cunning was
evident in his disposition, which could not elude the penetration of
an accurate observer, though upon the whole he appeared quiet and
inoffensive; and, if he did not secure the esteem of his associates,
he managed so as to escape their censure.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more simple, more innocent, than the life of
Madame Chamont, which was occupied in the education of her children,
in family arrangements, and every other worthy employment which her
station required.</p>

<p>Both Enr&icirc;co and Laurette displayed early in life quickness
of parts and gracefulness of demeanour, which were united with the
most amiable inclinations of which the human mind is susceptible. It
was impossible for any thing to exceed their mutual affection; one
was never to be seen without the other; in play, or in study, they
were equally inseparable; nor could one taste of any enjoyment, of
which the other might not partake.</p>

<p>Enr&icirc;co possessed spirit, and energy of soul, sufficient to
encounter the greatest difficulties. He was sometimes impatient of
controul, and impetuous in his replies; but a fault was scarcely
committed before it was followed by repentance, and an earnest desire
of removing the consequent uneasiness of his mother by the most
endearing caresses.</p>

<p>Laurette was blessed with an equal share of sensibility, but was
gentle and timid. Her manners were so invariably amiable, that she
never excited anger; when she did fall into an error, which was
seldom the case, a look of disapprobation was sufficient to recall
her to a sense of her duty, and an acknowledgment of her fault. Her
charming instructress had never imposed herself upon her as her
mother, neither had she intimated anything relative to the mysterious
manner in which she had been conveyed to her; but had taught her to
believe that she was an orphan, protected by the Marchese de
Montferrat, to whom she was under infinite obligations, and whose
kindness she must repay with the obedience of a child.</p>

<p>Nor was Enr&icirc;co informed of the circumstances of his birth,
his affectionate parent having concealed from him, with equal
discretion, what she did not cease to reflect upon with unutterable
anguish; though sometimes in infantine simplicity he would touch upon
the subject, and ask some questions respecting his father, his
innocent interrogatories being only answered by tears and blushes, he
had soon penetration enough to discover they had awakened mournful
recollections, and a sufficient degree of prudence to discontinue the
inquiry.</p>

<p>Father Benedicta, a friar, who belonged to a monastery of
Carthusians, not far from the castle of Elfinbach, and who was Madame
Chamont's confessor, assisted her in the education of the children.
He was a man that had spent the early part of his life in the bustle
and gaiety of the world, in which he was supposed to have suffered
much from disappointment; but what were the misfortunes that had
occasioned this almost total seclusion from society, and from which
he had taken refuge in the gloom of a cloister, were unknown even to
the fraternity; but they were thought to be of a peculiar and
mournful nature. Yet, though removed from the pleasures, he was
sensible to the charities of life. To the unfortunate, the afflicted,
or the dying, he was a never failing source of support and
assistance; he never heard of a calamity in which he did not take an
interest, or a request, if virtuous, that he did not immediately
grant. But the uniform austerities of his own life were beyond the
strictest rules of his order, and it was only from the tender concern
that he discovered for the welfare of others, that he was supposed to
feel any 'touch of humanity'.</p>

<p>He overlooked the conduct of Enr&icirc;co and Laurette with the
mild benignity of a saint; instructed them in the principles of
religion, as well as in the classics, and watched the unfolding of
each infant virtue with parental tenderness.</p>

<p>From the instructive conversation of this holy Father, Madame
Chamont reaped many advantages; he was her friend and adviser, as
well as her confessor, acquitting himself always to her satisfaction
in every undertaking; though his increasing affection for his pupils,
exclusively considered, was of itself sufficient to secure her
esteem.</p>

<p>Of this Monk she made an inquiry concerning La Roque; but no Friar
of the name of Francisco had arrived at his monastery. At her request
he wrote to the Superiors of several others, but every attempt of
gaining intelligence upon the subject proved ineffectual, which made
her apprehend that either his illness had proved fatal, or that he
had fallen into the hands of his persecutors. His mournful, his
interesting expressions, the stingings of remorse that attended the
recollection of his sufferings, excited her Compassion whenever she
reflected upon them, and awakened new curiosity to be acquainted with
the sequel.</p>

<p>The undisturbed felicity which was experienced by Madame Chamont
in the bosom of her family, and in the exercise of religion and
virtue, was of a more pure and animated nature than any she had
enjoyed since the death of her parents. No society was to her like
that of her children, no hours passed so pleasantly as those
dedicated to their improvement and amusement; whilst on their part
affection was so entirely divested of fear, that they were never so
happy as when in her presence.</p>

<p>The mornings were chiefly devoted to study, and the evenings to
beautiful rambles in the woods, or along the margin of the river, and
sometimes to the adjacent villages, where they were enabled to feel
that tranquil delight arising from the practice of benevolence the
luxury of succouring the unfortunate, and of giving an expression of
joy to the face long accustomed to sadness.</p>

<p>The study of botany was one of Madame Chamont's favourite
employments, in which she had made some proficiency, which occasioned
her to spend many hours in the fields, improving herself in this
useful and elegant science. On these expeditions her young pupils
were ever ready to attend her, and taking an osier basket on her arm,
she would frequently wander with them in the stillness of the evening
amid scenes the most romantic and picturesque, where, seated upon a
hillock, or under the broad shade of a chestnut, she would weave a
garland for Enr&icirc;co, or a chaplet to adorn the beautiful hair of
Laurette; and frequently they would exchange the fertile and
cultivated charms of Nature for her unadorned and more majestic
works; sometimes they would ascend the steep crags of the mountains,
where all was wild, waste, and rude, yet in its naked simplicity
grand, stupendous, and sublime. Here they would contemplate the awful
beauty of the scene, the retiring hills half lost in the distant
horizon, and the spires of some neighbouring abbeys just appearing
amid the deep gloom of the woods, and hearken to the faint sound of
the vesper bell, borne at intervals upon the wing of the breeze; and
sometimes, when not a breath of air disturbed the universal calm, or
shook the light foliage of the leaves, the distant chaunt of the Nuns
would be heard, now swelling into holy rapture, and now sinking into
sweet and mournful cadence, till softened by distance, or lost in the
rising flutter of the gale, it died away upon the ear.</p>

<p>To the admirer of Nature every object she presents becomes
interesting; the variety of her charms relieves the mind from
satiety, and, in the enjoyment of her beauties, the soul of the
enthusiast becomes elevated above the narrow boundaries of the world:
he sees the Creator in his works, and adores in silence the
perfection of the whole. At times a disposition of this cast will be
inclined to melancholy; but it is a sublime and tender melancholy,
which he would not resign for all the pleasures which gaiety could
bestow, or wealth procure. To such impressions as these the mind of
Madame Chamont was peculiarly susceptible, and she perceived this
pensive sensation steal upon her spirits, at that season above all
others, when the rich bloom of the landscape begins to fade, when the
glow of vegetation and the flush of maturity are past, and the whole
scenery exhibits a more saddened, but a more interesting
appearance.</p>

<p>To these simple and innocent delights Enr&icirc;co and Laurette
discovered an early attachment, which their amiable protectress
beheld with satisfaction. She knew the necessity of employment, being
well aware of the danger attending inactivity and indolence. She
taught them to value every moment of their existence, not allowing
them to pass without due improvement. Reading was a favourite
occupation, and Madame Chamont did not neglect the selecting such
books for their perusal as were capable of conveying both instruction
and amusement, the reading of which might be considered not so much a
task as a recreation. Enr&icirc;co was partial to historical
writings, and having been permitted to examine, at an early age, the
most eminent authors in that species of composition, was soon well
acquainted with the works of the most celebrated Grecian and Latin
historians. He was also an ardent lover of ancient poetry,
particularly of the epic kind. Homer, Lucan, and Virgil, were perused
with juvenile transport; nor was the much admired Gerusalemme of
Tasso disregarded: his soul was fired with the illustrious
atchievements of Rinaldo, and he burned with an irresistible desire
of attaining military honours. Madame Chamont, who discovered his
inclinations before he was conscious of having betrayed them,
endeavoured at first to check a propensity which she had not a
sufficient portion of fortitude to reflect upon with calmness: but
finding that his happiness depended upon the success of his hopes,
opposition appeared like cruelty; and having heard from Paoli that
the Marchese wished to provide for him in the army, where his
interest could not fail of being successful, she began to reason
herself into compliance. She considered that if his disposition had a
strong bias to a military life, he would not have an equal chance of
rising to eminence in any other profession; and that this
disposition, aided by the powerful interest of the Marchese, would
doubtless raise him to high preferment. Thus the fondness overcame
the fears of the mother, and she acquiesced in the proposition.</p>

<p>When this affair was determined upon, the Marchese being apprized
of Enr&icirc;co's wishes, procured him a commission in the army of
Maximilian, Duke of Bavaria, and Paoli attending to conduct him from
the castle, he took an affectionate adieu of his mother and Laurette,
and proceeded on his journey.</p>

<p>For some time after the departure of Enr&icirc;co every
countenance expressed concern and inquietude. Doroth&eacute;e, who
had been his nurse from his infancy, was inconsolable for his loss,
and continued to weep incessantly; but being gradually reconciled to
what was unavoidable, the family regained their serenity.</p>

<p>In a short time Madame Chamont received a letter from him, which
contained the most pleasing intelligence, that he was well and happy.
He spoke tenderly of his dear companion, his little Laurette, and
desired she might be told that he would never forget her. This
account of the health and welfare of Enr&icirc;co was received by his
excellent parent with the most lively rapture; and though sometimes
this temporary absence would cast a shade of sorrow upon her
countenance, which all her firmness could not enable her to subdue,
she would anticipate the future glory of her son; her sanguine
imagination would follow him through all the intricacies of his
destiny, and represent him covered with honours, and glowing in the
pride of martial glory.</p>

<p>With redoubled attention Madame Chamont now devoted herself to the
education of her lovely charge. She instructed her without any
assistance in the French and Italian languages, as well as in drawing
and music. She also cultivated her taste for poetry, of which she was
passionately fond.</p>

<p>The songs of Laurette were generally of the plaintive kind, which
she accompanied with her lute with exquisite taste and judgment;
though she sometimes exerted herself in a lively air to dissipate the
tender dejection which was perceptible in the demeanour of Madame
Chamont, when her thoughts reverted too anxiously to her son, who
felt she was amply repaid for all the attention she had bestowed upon
her orphan charge, by her undeviating assiduity to please, and the
sweetness of disposition she displayed.</p>

<p>The absence of Enr&icirc;co had for some time affected the spirits
of Laurette. She could ill support the loss of him who had been the
companion of her infancy, the sharer in her amusements and her
studies, and for whom she felt more than a sisterly affection.</p>

<p>Laurette in person was at the age of fourteen, in which time she
had nearly completed her growth, rather above the middle size. Her
form was of the most perfect symmetry, her complexion rather delicate
than blooming; her eyes were dark, sparkling, and tender, and when
directed upwards had an expression of sweetness, and sometimes of
melancholy, that was at once charming and interesting. When silent,
there was a certain softness in her countenance that was infinitely
fascinating; and when animated by the expression that her
conversation diffused, it was equally captivating and alluring.
Though her cheek did not always display the full and glowing tint of
the rose, yet exercise, or an emotion of surprise, awakened the most
delicate bloom, and gave a dazzling lustre to her beauty.</p>

<pre>
Whene'er with soft serenity she smil'd.
Or caught the orient blush of quick surprise.
How sweetly mutable, how brightly wild.
The liquid lustre darted from her eyes!
--MASON
</pre>

<p>One of the rooms in the eastern part of the building, which was
entirely appropriated to herself, contained her music, books, drawing
implements, and embroidery. The windows of this room opened upon a
lawn, that was terminated by groves of laurel, fir, and flowering
ash. Here she spent many hours in the morning, improving herself,
with the assistance of Madame Chamont, in useful and elegant
employments. She usually arose early, and rambled for some time
unattended through wild and unfrequented walks, where too frequently
the image of Enr&icirc;co would recur to her imagination, and melt
her into tears. These rambles were inexpressibly grateful to her at
that charming season when all Nature is rising as from her grave into
perfect vegetation and verdure, when the embryo leaves are just
unfolding their beauties to the sun, and all breathe harmony,
delight, and rapture! It was after one of these little romantic
excursions that she penned the following lines, which was the first
effort of her muse: blended with the harsher lines of calamity, each
uniting to soften what could not be eradicated.</p>

<pre>
SONNET TO SPRING


Come, lovely nymph, with all thy flow'ry train.
And let thy herald gem these mountains hoar;
With fragrant violets deck this lonely plain.
And bid rude Winter's whirlwind howl no more.
Thy soft approach the hawthorn buds declare.
That scent, with odours sweet, the passing gale.
And, clad in snowy vest, the lily fair.
Hides her meek beauties in the humid vale.
Oh! come, thou nymph divine, delightful Spring!
With all thy graces, all thy melting lays.
And mild Content, thy sweet companion, bring.
She that in sylvan shades and woodlands strays:
Whose angel form, health's blushing sweets disclose.
And on whose beauteous lip the eastern ruby glows.
</pre>

<p>Laurette's time was not so entirely devoted to music, reading, or
the study of languages, as to preclude the duties of society, nor the
tender and benevolent offices of charity. She frequently visited the
sick, the infirm, and the aged, and to work for the peasantry that
inhabited the border of the river, was a favourite occupation.</p>

<p>In one of these cottages was a poor widow, who was left with a
numerous family, without any other means of support than what was
afforded by her own industry. Here Madame Chamont and Laurette
oftentimes resorted to soften the acuteness of distress, and to
relieve the hardships of poverty. By their hands the younger part of
the family were entirely clothed, who no sooner beheld their
benefactresses, than they flocked around them with the most endearing
tenderness; their presence diffused universal pleasure, and never was
the sentiment of gratitude more eloquently expressed than in the
countenance of the widow. Those who have experienced the luxurious
sensation of contributing to the happiness of their fellow-creatures
will form some estimate of that heartfelt satisfaction, which
animated the amiable visiters as they contemplated the objects of
their benevolence; and will allow, that it is a luxury too pure, and
too refined, to exist in the midst of folly and dissipation, and,
like other virtues, usually retires from the bustle of the world to
the silent walks of domestic life.</p>

<h3>Chapter 9</h3>

<pre>
How happy is the blameless vestal's lot.
The world forgetting, by the world forgot;
Eternal sun-shine of the spotless mind.
Each prayer accepted, and each wish resign'd;
Labour and rest, that equal periods keep.
Obedient slumbers, that can wake and weep;
Desires composed, affections ever even.
Tears that delight, and sighs that waft to heaven.
--POPE
</pre>

<p>The only female acquaintance cultivated by Madame Chamont in her
retirement was the Superior of a convent of penitent Nuns, of the
order of St Francis, to whom she was recommended by Father Benedicta.
This Abbess was a woman of high birth and education. Her aspect was
entirely divested of that stately reserve, which usually accompanies
undisputed authority. Her conduct was irreproachable, and she blended
judiciously all the elegances of refinement with maternal tenderness.
She loved the Nuns as her children, entering into all their concerns
and distresses with the lively interest of a friend, extending her
sympathy to all that were in need of it, her charity to the
friendless, and her succour to the oppressed. Her looks, her words,
were those of comfort and compassion, and her precepts, being
delivered with plainness and energy, never failed to persuade.
Misfortune had given pensiveness to her demeanour without throwing
any thing of gloom around. The whole of her countenance was
expressive of the most fervent piety; no appearance of bigotry
disgraced it, for her religion was that of the heart, that of
sentiment rather than of theory, which taught her to cherish every
virtue that dignifies the human mind, to instigate by example, and to
reward with affection.</p>

<p>To such perfections as these Madame Chamont could not be
insensible; and on a first interview there was nothing she more
ardently desired than to be included amongst the number of her
friends. She was not long denied this enviable privilege; for the
holy Benedicta had advanced much in her favour, and her own
insinuating address had done more. The lady Abbess found in the
graceful ease of her manners, a charm every way congenial to her
mind. She saw she had suffered, for time and reflection had not yet
erased the mark of sorrow from her countenance; yet this was not its
only character gentleness, meekness, and resignation, were blended
with the harsher lines of calamity, each uniting to soften what could
not be eradicated.</p>

<p>She was soon admitted into the cloister as an intimate, and spent
many hours in the society of her new acquaintance, who received her
with inexpressible tenderness, never allowing her to depart without a
promise to shorten her next absence. The difference of their years
did not preclude the advances of friendship of the most noble and
interesting kind, though in this the Abbess had considerably the
advantage. But age had given nothing of gloom to her deportment,
having rather added to, than detracted from, its natural grace. She
soon loved Madame Chamont as her daughter, cherished her as a friend,
and felt unusually animated in her presence. Some of the Nuns beheld
her with no symptoms of pleasure; the attentions of their noble
protectress, which had hitherto been confined to themselves, were,
they imagined, transferred to a stranger; and though respect for
their much-revered lady prevented them from murmuring, they could not
entirely conceal the cause of their chagrin.</p>

<p>At every meeting the two friends were more delighted with each
other than before, and this attachment led them to indulge in the
luxury of mutual confidence. The lady Abbess related to Madame
Chamont the most memorable events of her past life; they were
melancholy, but not uninteresting, and her gentle auditress, who
listened to her with the most lively concern, shed many tears at the
recital; the substance of which was as follows:</p>

<p>THE STORY OF THE ABBESS</p>

<p>The Superior of the convent of the penitent Nuns, of the order of
St Francis, was of Gallic extraction, being the only daughter of the
Compte de Vendome, who was a General Officer in the service of the
Prince of Conde, when that renowned warrior fought the famous battle
of Jarnac with the Duke of Anjon.</p>

<p>His valour was the boast of his country, the admiration of Europe,
making him revered as an ally, and equally dreaded as an enemy! After
being celebrated, and almost idolized in France for the signal
victories he had gained, his hitherto successful armies were routed
by an attack from an unexpected quarter, and the enemy being joined
by numbers too powerful for resistance, they were called upon to
surrender.</p>

<p>The Compte, unwilling to lessen his former fame by what he termed
a shameful acquiescence, resolutely refused to obey, chusing rather
to die in the field than to tarnish his spotless reputation by
relinquishing his arms. Some of the soldiers preferring captivity to
death, consented to the proposition, whilst others, who had caught
somewhat of that martial ardour that animated the invincible soul of
their leader, persisted in a refusal. The fight now became more
desperate; the enemy was joined by a detachment coveniently ambushed
near the place; the field was soon covered with the dead and the
wounded, and the father of the amiable Abbess, after having defended
himself bravely for a long time, was at last overpowered and
slain!</p>

<p>This melancholy news was soon communicated to the Comptessa with
all imaginable delicacy, but she did not long survive the recital.
She had been for some time in a weak state, and this was a shock she
was unable to sustain. Immediately on her decease, Adela, her only
surviving child, was consigned to the care of her guardian, Monsieur
de Santong, who resided in a distant part of the province. He was a
widower, of reduced fortunes; with one son, who was finishing his
education at one of the public seminaries in Paris.</p>

<p>Monsieur was a man of stern and severe deportment, in disposition
at once haughty and morose, and his manners were so little calculated
to please, that Adela, having never since her birth left the side of
her mother, shrunk with terror from his gaze.</p>

<p>Before the Comte de Vendome quitted his beloved home, to undertake
his last fatal expedition, he settled all his temporal affairs,
leaving his daughter to the protection of this his only surviving
relative, on the death of her mother, should this event take place
before she was disposed of in marriage.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Santong, having been long disgusted with the world,
had retired from the haunts of society to a small estate that he
possessed in a remote and dreary situation, where he lived as
peaceful and undisturbed as if consigned to his grave. Previous to
his seclusion, he had mixed occasionally with people of various
descriptions, but without being able to select any one with whom he
could remain in habits of intimacy. He was a man of parts, without
gaining the respect that usually adheres to science, because he
expected undue regard; and in spite of the gravity of his appearance,
the eccentricities of his conduct frequently made him the sport of
witticism: by the learned he was rejected for his obstinacy, by the
gay for his severity, and by the candid for his misanthropy. Thus,
after the death of his wife, and the departure of his son, who was
educated under the eye of one of his mother's relatives in the
metropolis, he was left a lonely and solitary being, in whom no one
was interested; few gave themselves the trouble to inquire whether he
was still in existence, and those who did, lamented, when answered in
the affirmative, that the useless were permitted to survive the
worthy.</p>

<p>His relation, the Compte de Vendome, was, perhaps, the only person
of his acquaintance by whom he was not thoroughly despised, though
the sentiments and disposition of this justly esteemed nobleman were
so diametrically opposite to his. The application and activity
inseparable from a military capacity, had indeed prevented a
continual intercourse, and the connexion subsisting between the
families had silenced many out of respect to the much-revered Compte,
who might otherwise have uttered much to Monsieur de Santong's
disadvantage. He had more than once visited Monsieur before he took
refuge in retirement; and, from the observations he was enabled to
make, was convinced that his knowledge was profound, though obscured
by caprice; and finding nothing to alledge against him but his
inordinate love of praise, and his eccentric indulgences, he fixed
upon him as the guardian of his Adela, should she be deprived of her
parents before that sacred trust should devolve to another.</p>

<p>The fair orphan, being not more than seven years of age, received
from Monsieur de Santong the first rudiments of her education. She
was not allowed, for reasons never to be penetrated, to receive it in
its usual form, in the shades of a cloister, though the mansion in
which she resided was equally dreary and secluded. Society, or
unexpected events, never retarded her progress, which enabled her
soon to become conversant in every branch of elegant literature, and
to be well acquainted with the classics, without being compelled to
receive their beauties through the medium of her mother tongue.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Santong, who, next to his own son, loved her as much
as he was capable of loving any one, beheld the proficiency she made
with surprise and pleasure; and when in conversation with her,
relaxed so much from his accustomed severity, that she became
imperceptibly more at ease in his presence; yet her youthful
imagination would frequently wander beyond the walls of the chateau,
and portray scenes of gaiety and happiness in the world, which the
original would not have equalled.</p>

<p>But, upon the whole, the life of Adela passed less unpleasantly
than might have been imagined. A lively French woman, who was the
director of the domestic affairs, interested herself much in her
happiness, and saved her from many moments of despondency. Her name
was Agnes; she had received a respectable education at Moulines under
the care of an aunt, and after meeting with some misfortunes in life,
respecting pecuniary affairs, had accepted a superior kind of service
in the family of Monsieur de Santong.</p>

<p>In the society of this young woman, who possessed much genuine
good humour, she frequently rambled a considerable distance from the
mansion when the occupations of the day were over, and amused herself
with surveying the landscape which her secluded situation commanded.
But books were her chief amusements, and these were never denied her.
Those selected by her guardian for her instruction and entertainment
were mostly of the learned kind, though she was sometimes supplied
with lighter works by the assistance of Agnes, from which she reaped
less solid advantage.</p>

<p>Several years were passed in this manner without any material
incident, till the arrival of the younger Santong, who had just
completed his studies, occasioned an alteration in affairs.</p>

<p>He came attended by a schoolfellow, his principal companion, who
was introduced by the name of Clairville to Monsieur, who received
him with an air of coldness bordering upon rudeness. The young
chevalier, who did not fail to remark the unpleasant consequence of
his visit, appeared chagrined and uneasy, which Adela perceiving,
endeavoured to remove by every attention she was empowered to bestow.
In this she succeeded. His thoughts were soon abstracted from this
slight cause of distress, but were directed to a subject more
dangerous to his peace. He loved Adela the moment he beheld her, and
without asking permission of his reason for doing so: well aware of
the distance at which fortune had thrown him, he would have
submitted, for the first time, to have solicited her favours, could
wealth have secured the possession of his wishes.</p>

<p>Every interview increased his regard; he soon lived but for Adela,
who was by no means insensible to his merit; and from the native
openness of her disposition, felt no inclination to conceal from the
observation of others the sentiment she indulged in his favour.</p>

<p>The young Santong, who was evidently as much inferior to his
friend in mind as in person, beheld the decided preference shewn to
him by his fair relation with a degree of dissatisfaction and
displeasure, which he sometimes failed to disguise. He had bestowed
upon the person and accomplishments of Adela no common attention; but
her birth and splendid possessions were still more alluring in his
eyes. His father had intimated his intention of uniting him with his
ward, whose early seclusion from the world must have prevented the
possibility of any other attachment. He had acceded with rapture to
the proposal before he was introduced to her, and no sooner beheld
her than lie considered her as his future bride. Had his own vanity
been less, he would have avoided throwing a handsome young chevalier
in her way, whose mind was not less perfect than his person, and
whose soul was formed for all the delicacies and refinements of the
tender passions.</p>

<p>Adela, being a stranger to disguise, would frequently, in the
absence of Clairville, speak eloquently in his praise in the presence
of Monsieur and the younger Santong, and perceived, not without
astonishment, the apparent coldness with which her guardian repressed
her innocent encomiums, and the flashes of anger that occasionally
darted from the eyes of his offended son. But unsuspicious of the
cause, she still continued to talk of him with that ardour of
friendship, which declared to the more experienced observer how
tenderly she was attached to the object of her commendation.
Clairville, who felt the awkwardness of his situation, endeavoured to
reconcile himself to the thoughts of quitting the chateau; but the
idea of never again beholding her, in whose fate he was so strongly
interested, and of the probability of her being soon disposed of to
his more fortunate rival, sunk upon his heart, and he became pensive
and disconsolate. Every day brought with it fresh proof that the
affections of his friend were estranged from him, and that common
courtesy only prevented him from accelerating his departure.
Conscious of this, he began internally to despise himself for having
so long yielded to the weakness of his feelings, and resolved to
regain his own esteem by naming an early day for his return to the
metropolis. Having once determined upon this mode of conduct, he
hastened to fulfil his intentions, and on the following morning,
seeing his friend walking alone in the shrubbery, he joined him with
the resolution of executing his purpose.</p>

<p>The young Santong did not immediately observe him, being lost in
musing, till the voice of the once-respected chevalier roused him
from his stupor; and turning towards him, he accosted him with an
expression of kindness that overcame him with surprise and
pleasure.</p>

<p>Contrary to his original determination, he did not instantly make
known his intention; and being soon afterwards joined by Adela and
Monsieur de Santong, he continued to defer it.</p>

<p>The conversation now became general, and more than usually lively;
the young Comptessa discoursed with her accustomed sprightliness,
whilst the eyes of her lover, announcing every feeling of his soul,
conveyed a tender and earnest expression as they became riveted upon
her's. Not far from the mansion was an extensive wood; and Santong
having heard that it contained a large quantity of game, proposed to
de Clairville, as the morning was fine, to spend a few hours in the
diversion of shooting. His friend agreed to the proposal, though not
without some reluctance, as it would deprive him of the society of
Adela, and they began their excursion.</p>

<p>As soon as they were gone, the fair recluse retired pensively to
her library, willing to beguile the moments of absence with her
books, her usual resources in the moments of uneasiness. She felt,
without knowing why, an unusual depression of spirits, which she made
many efforts to dissipate, but without success. She reflected, with
dissatisfaction, on the solicitous attentions of Santong, who, she
easily perceived, was designed by her guardian for her future
husband. She compared him with the noble, the insinuating stranger,
and for the first time discovered the partiality which the merit of
the latter had inspired. He had never openly declared his passion for
her; but his expressive manners could not be misconstrued, and he was
apparently withheld, only by respectful diffidence, from making a
verbal confession.</p>

<p>Nothing appeared so dreadful to her as a marriage with Santong;
yet how was it to be avoided, if her guardian insisted upon her
compliance? How could she presume to oppose him, to whose will she
had hitherto yielded the most implicit obedience? She knew that he
was severe in his disposition, terrible in his displeasure, and
capable of adopting the most resolute measures, and of performing the
most daring actions. As to the younger Santong, he appeared to her
somewhat prejudiced mind to be deficient in every amiable
qualification of the heart. She wondered why the Chevalier de
Clairville, who seemed to possess every moral and elevated virtue,
had enlisted him among the number of his intimates, since there was
certainly no reciprocity of sentiment to unite them in the bonds of
affection.</p>

<p>The young sportsmen, having been absent some hours, and nothing
happening to break the train of her reflections, she took a walk
towards the skirts of the wood, and having reached a heathy mountain,
seated herself upon a piece of broken rock, and continued to muse on
the subject which had so recently occupied her thoughts. She had not
been long in this situation before the report of a gun, proceeding
from the wood, convinced her they were returning from the excursion.
She started from her place without knowing whither she was going, and
advancing rapidly towards the spot from whence the sound was heard, a
dreadful scream alarmed her, and in the next moment she beheld young
Santong and the servant, who had attended them in their expedition,
bearing the bleeding, and apparently almost lifeless form of the
Chevalier de Clairville!</p>

<p>What a sight was this for Adela, the tender, the adoring Adela, to
sustain! But surprise and anguish soon depriving her of sensation,
she sunk into a state of insensibility. The cries of the servant (for
Santong, transfixed in horror, was unable to utter a sound) reached
the chateau, and the domestics, with anxious and terrified looks,
crowded around them. Adela, who was long before she discovered any
symptom of returning life, was conveyed to her room, where every
method was employed to restore and console her; but a fever and
delirium were the consequence of this dreadful alarm, which
threatened to terminate her existence. The physician that attended de
Clairville was called in to her assistance, who pronounced her to be
in a state of danger; at the same time desired that she might be kept
as tranquil as possible, as the only chance of success depended upon
the recomposing of her spirits. This induced her attendants to delude
her, in the intervals of reason, with the most flattering information
respecting the chevalier. The physician was also from necessity
compelled to aid the deception, by assuring her that his wounds were
not mortal, and that from their favourable appearance every thing was
to be hoped.</p>

<p>This joyful intelligence tended to accelerate her recovery, and as
soon as she was enabled to bear a repetition of the subject, inquired
how the accident had happened? But of this she could hear no
satisfactory account. The young Santong was alone acquainted with the
particulars, and he being in a state little short of distraction, was
not in a situation to answer inquiries.</p>

<p>As soon as Adela was sufficiently recovered from her illness to
endure the sight of de Clairville, he requested permission to see
her. What they might mutually suffer from so trying an interview,
induced the worthy physician to deny him the privilege; but as the
necessity of refusing a dying request is, perhaps, one of the
severest inflictions that benevolence can endure, he at last yielded,
though not unreluctantly, to his wishes.</p>

<p>As soon as Adela was informed of his desire, she quitted her room,
for the first time since she entered it, and proceeded, supported by
Agnes, to the side of his bed.</p>

<p>But what were her feelings when, instead of finding him in a state
of convalescence as she had been taught to expect, she beheld him
with the image of death stamped upon his countenance, saw his lips
quivering as if on the eve of closing for ever, and heard his short
convulsive breathings, with every other symptom of approaching
dissolution! The moment she fixed her eyes on the faded form before
her, a cold trembling seized her: she had but just power to repress
the scream that was escaping her, and afraid she should relapse into
insensibility before she should catch the last accents of his voice,
clung still closer to Agnes. The dying chevalier, though unable to
articulate, extended his feeble hand to grasp her's, with a look so
tender, so mournful, so touching, that her grief arose to agony!</p>

<p>Incapable of moving, she still continued by his side, with her
eyes fixed wildly upon his face, with such an expression of anguish,
that none present could refrain from tears! At last the wan
countenance on which she gazed assumed a more ghastly paleness, the
films obscured his sight, the pulse that had long beat, feebly
fluttered, and then ceased for ever, and that captivating, that once
graceful form, became stiffened in death! Adela's distress was now
too acute to be suppressed, and disengaging herself from Agnes, who
could no longer restrain her, she fell breathless on the bed! A deep
silence, as of the grave, ensued, which was only interrupted
occasionally by the loud sobs of Monsieur de Santong, who had
remained in speechless sorrow at the farther end of the room during
this pathetic scene, unobserved by the unfortunate sufferers. It was
too much for human nature to endure with firmness, and the stern, and
before impenetrable, heart of the misanthropist melted at the touches
of sympathy!</p>

<p>As soon as the account of de Clairville's dissolution reached the
ears of his son, he flew into the room with the desperation of a
maniac, declaring himself his murderer. His cries recalled Adela to
existence, who, regarding him with speechless horror as he uttered
the dreadful truth, threw herself into the arms of her attendant, and
was conveyed to her apartment.</p>

<p>It was several days after this mournful event before she was in a
situation to see any one except her physician and confessor, and
during that period the remorse and distraction of Santong portended
the loss of his senses! He raved continually of Adela, besought his
father to plead for his forgiveness, and then resign him as a
murderer to the laws of his country. He acknowledged that it was
jealousy alone that had instigated him to the horrid deed, having
observed the attachment that had subsisted between his friend and the
young Comptessa ever since its commencement, particularly the tender
looks they had exchanged on the morning that had witnessed his guilt,
which, he added, had given fresh fuel to that unbridled resentment,
which was before too violent to be concealed or subdued.</p>

<p>Though Adela had been brought by this trying calamity nearly to
the brink of the grave, youth, united to a good constitution, finally
triumphed, and in a few weeks she was enabled to sit up in her room,
and to converse with her confessor.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Santong, who had made daily inquiries concerning his
unhappy ward ever since the death of de Clairville, ventured, at the
request of his son, to solicit an audience. Having gained the
permission he desired, he was ushered into the room, and, with an
aspect on which pity and distress were strikingly depicted, placed
himself on a chair by her side. Adela received him with a placid and
sorrowful air; but when he began to plead for his son, the assassin
of the noble chevalier, a slight blush of resentment tinged her
cheek, and she surveyed him with a look of mingled astonishment and
displeasure. But when he assured her that his son did not aspire to
her love, but only besought her forgiveness, and had convinced her
that the atrocious crime his unfortunate child had committed was not
the effect of deliberate and premeditated cruelty, the expression of
her countenance changed, and compassion gave new softness to its
character. A heart that could deny its pardon to a wretch, suffering
all the agonies of guilt and remorse, must have been made of sterner
materials than was that of Adela; and she bestowed it in accents so
gentle, that, though the younger Santong never presumed to obtrude
himself into her presence, when he received an account of it from his
father, he became more tranquil.</p>

<p>The wretched culprit did not continue much longer at the chateau;
and though despondency had prompted the request concerning a
resignation to the civil laws of his country, other considerations
determined him to purchase a dispensation from the Pope, and to close
his existence in some religious retirement. Monsieur de Santong did
not oppose his inclinations; this heavy calamity, inflicted upon him
by the violence of unregulated passions, had an effect upon his mind
as powerful as it was instantaneous. He was now no longer proud,
vain, or inaccessible; his favourite project, that of uniting his son
to the heiress of the noble house of Vendome, was at an end, and
every earthly pursuit seemed to have expired with it. Grief had the
happy effect of convincing him that he was not beyond the reach of
misfortune, and by teaching him the insufficiency of immoderate
acquirements, had conveyed a lesson of humility and wisdom. When the
chevalier was first introduced to him, he imagined, in his fine
person and insinuating address, he discovered a formidable rival for
his son. He saw his perfections with dissatisfaction, because he
believed they could not fail to attract the regard of the youthful
and blooming Adela; but now that he had paid so dear for his
rivalship, he felt nothing of prejudice lingering at his heart, and
cherished a kind of melancholy esteem for his memory. This sudden
transition, from moroseness to kindness, indicated that his former
misanthropy was rather the effect of circumstance than a natural
inclination of the mind; for from this time he became the mild
guardian, the compassionate and tender father; and could he have
prevailed upon himself to have returned to society, might have become
the estimable friend.</p>

<p>As soon as Adela was recovered, she formed a resolution of
secluding herself in a convent, and took an early opportunity of
informing Monsieur de Santong of her design. Amazed at her intention,
he offered some slight objections, which she speedily removed, and
then consented to inquire for a situation suitable to her wishes.</p>

<p>About a week after she had made known her determination, the
unhappy Santong repaired to his monastery, which was somewhere in the
southern part of France; and on the succeeding day the Comptessa de
Vendome was conducted by her guardian to the convent, which, in
obedience to her former desire, he had selected for her residence: it
contained a society of Carmelite Nuns of one of the strictest orders
in the country. Here she was admitted as a boarder; but owing to its
not meeting with her entire approbation, did not continue her abode
in this place. There was not one among the sisterhood with whom she
could connect herself; for the Lady of the convent was reserved,
haughty, and mercenary, and the Nuns seemed invariably to emulate her
example.</p>

<p>This influenced her intentions of not remaining in so unpleasant a
society during life, and led her to adopt a resolution of quitting it
as soon as she could inform herself of another more congenial to her
taste. Having executed her design, she left France, and removing into
Germany, entered into a convent of Penitent Nuns, of the order of St
Francis. Here she spent several years as a sister; and after the
death of the Abbess, having endowed this religious asylum with her
vast possessions, was preferred to the honour of succeeding her as
Supenor. When this little affecting narrative was concluded, which
was illustrated with many elevated sentiments and tender incidents,
which, unless recited with the grace and eloquence of the amiable
narrator, might fail to interest the reader, she drew a small gem
from her bosom, which contained the name of the chevalier, wrought
with his hair: it was suspended by a small string of rubies, and was
worn continually round her neck. As she gazed upon this precious
relic, a throbbing emotion disturbed her usually serene features; she
sighed, pressed it mournfully to her heart, and seemed to be
insensible to every thing for the moment but the recollection of her
long-indulged sorrows.</p>

<p>Madame Chamont, who had listened to her with a painful interest,
bent over the arm of the chair on which her friend was sitting, and
mingled her tears with her's, till their attention was recalled from
melancholy reflection by the appearance of a Nun who came to present
a piece of embroidery to the Abbess, which she had newly finished. As
she advanced towards the Superior with a pensive and dignified air,
she bent gracefully to Madame Chamont, and drawing aside her veil,
discovered to her one of the most lovely faces she had ever seen. It
was pale, and marked with sorrow; but there was a certain expression
of softness and resignation in her fine Grecian features an air of
meek, corrected sadness, that could not be perused without pity and
affection. As soon as she had delivered her work, and had received
the grateful commendation of the Abbess, she drew her veil again over
her face, and retired.</p>

<p>As soon as she was gone, Madame Chamont, willing to withdraw her
revered friend from the luxury of too tender remembrances, praised
the singular beauty of the sister, and requested to be informed of
her name. 'It is sister Cecilia,' returned the Superior, 'one of the
most devout Nuns of the order. She never enters into any of our
amusements, except at the holy festivals, and seems to dedicate the
whole of her life to prayer and religious exercises. She confines
herself almost entirely to her cell, seldom enters into conversation
with any other than her confessor, and preserves a life of uniform
reserve and austerity.</p>

<p>'She is the only one of the sisterhood with whose story I am
unacquainted, though she has been in the society upwards of fourteen
years; nor have any of the Nuns, not even those for whom she
possesses the most decided regard, been able to gain admission into
her confidence. Yet, though she has preserved this invariable
reserve, none of the inhabitants of the cloister are more tenderly,
more universally beloved. She is the first to shew consolation and
kindness to all who are in need of it; her breast is the temple of
benevolence, the seat of truth and of virtue. Her charity is as
unbounded as her other excellencies, and she seems capable of no
other enjoyment than what she derives from the source of religion,
and the happiness of her fellow-creatures. Besides these solid and
estimable virtues, she possesses many charming accomplishments,
which, but for their being connected with the stable principles, the
intrinsic excellencies of the mind, might be justly deemed of little
value. Nature has bestowed upon her, amongst her other gifts, a rich
and excursive fancy; the devout pieces, which are used not
unfrequently on the most solemn occasions, attuned to the notes of
the organ, are chiefly of her composing; and for grace, delicacy, and
energy of thought, may be said to be nearly unequalled. In music she
is an avowed proficient, and the needle-work she has just brought for
my inspection,' resumed the Abbess, 'is an indisputable proof of her
taste in that elegant department.'</p>

<p>There was something in this account, united with the exalted, yet
meek devotion, that characterized the appearance of the Nun, so
affecting to Madame Chamont, that, when the Superior had finished,
she still listened, in hopes of hearing a farther account of her. But
her informer had related all that she knew of her, except that she
was a Neapolitan, and that it was believed she had suffered some
severe irremediable calamity previous to her retirement from the
world.</p>

<p>Madame Chamont's curiosity was now more than ever awakened; she
thought of the Signora di Capigna, the supposed mother of Laurette,
and anxiety to be informed of the truth of this surmise arose to the
most painful impatience. The more she mused upon the subject, the
more probable it appeared, that the devout Cecilia was no other than
the once celebrated Neapolitan, the fair unfortunate victim of early
seduction, who, after the death of her father, was believed either to
have died of grief, or to have sought a remedy for it in some
religious seclusion. When she considered every thing the Abbess had
uttered, her grief, her silence respecting her family and name, her
penitential devotions, the length of time since she had entered into
the convent answering so nearly to the age of Laurette, her Italian
origin every circumstance seemed to convince her that the conjecture
was not founded on error, which determined her, if possible, to gain
further intelligence; but the difficulty of accomplishing her design
repressed the energy of the enterprize; was it likely that the fair
Nun, who had denied her confidence to so many with whom she was in
habits of intimacy, and even to the Superior herself, should impart
it to a stranger, one whom she had scarcely seen, and who had no
possible claim on her regard or attention?</p>

<p>As soon as she had quitted the convent, she returned silently
towards the castle, meditating as she went upon this new incident. If
this was really the Signora de Capigna, and her idea concerning
Laurette was a just one, she was doubtless ignorant respecting her
offspring, who had probably been conveyed from her without her
consent or knowledge. The actions of the Marchese were so veiled in
mystery, that it was impossible to comprehend, or to account for
them. But the propriety of acquainting sister Cecilia with the
situation of her child, if by any means Laurette could be proved to
be her's, appeared, every time she reflected upon it, more striking.
After much consideration, she formed the resolution of sending a few
lines to the Nun by Father Benedicta, who was confessor of the
convent.</p>

<p>Some days passed before she had an opportunity of accomplishing
her design, not being able to gain an interview with him in private;
but having written a letter to be in readiness, in which she avoided
mentioning any thing of herself or her charge, merely asking if she
ever had a daughter, and was ignorant of her fate, she committed it
to the care of the Father. The holy Benedicta eyed the direction,
which was written in Italian, with a look expressive of surprise; and
then placing it silently in the folds of his habit, bowed meekly, and
withdrew. It was not long before the Monk returned again to the
castle, and as soon as he was admitted into the presence of Madame
Chamont, presented her with an answer to her epistle, which she
instantly opened. It contained many grateful acknowledgments,
elegantly and delicately expressed, and, without any reference to her
own peculiar misfortunes, informed her she never had a daughter. The
conclusion, expressive of the devout spirit of the writer, breathed a
solemn benediction, commending her with impressive fervency to the
protection of Heaven. The signature, which bore no other name than
that of Cecilia, a penitent Nun of the order of St Francis, seemed to
have been written with a disordered hand, and to have been watered
with her tears.</p>

<p>Satisfied that this either was not Signora di Capigna, or that
Laurette was not the daughter of that unfortunate beauty, she made no
further attempt to investigate the subject; and whether from chance
or design she was unable to ascertain, the Nun never more entered the
apartment of the Abbess when Madame Chamont was there.</p>

<h3>Chapter 10</h3>

<pre>
Down many a winding step, mid dungeons dank.
Where anguish wails aloud, and fetters clank
To caves bestrew'd with many a mouldering bone.
And cells, whose echos only learn to groan.
Where no kind bars a whispering friend disclose.
No sun-beam enters, and no zephyr blows.
He treads.
--DARWIN
</pre>

<p>A considerable time had elapsed since the departure of
Enr&icirc;co, and no recent account of him having arrived at the
castle, a thousand mournful conjectures destroyed the repose of
Madame Chamont and Laurette, who began to believe that he was either
taken captive, or was slain by his more fortunate foes, while bravely
fighting the cause of the great Maximilian. These dreadful
apprehensions drew tears incessantly from the eyes of his
affectionate mother, whilst her beautiful pupil, who endeavoured to
appear cheerful in the presence of her protectress, often retired to
her apartment, or into the secret recesses of the woods, to weep and
suffer in silence.</p>

<p>The imagined fate of the young warrior was yet undecided, when
Paoli once more arrived at the mansion. From him they indulged a hope
of gaining some information respecting the Bavarian armies; but this
proving delusive, the family again sunk into sorrow and deep
dejection.</p>

<p>Madame Chamont's mind was so extremely agitated with these
distressing surmises, that, unable to sleep, she frequently forsook
her bed before the sun had risen upon the mountains, and wandered for
some hours unattended in the solitudes of the forest; hoping, in the
contemplation of external objects, that she might be able to divert
her thoughts from a subject that was attended with the severest
anguish.</p>

<p>One morning, having extended her walk much longer than usual, she
found herself in a part of the domain which she had never visited
before. It was more wild and picturesque than any thing she had ever
seen; an appearance of uncultivated grandeur was delineated in the
prospect it commanded, an air of desolation that was in unison with
her feelings, and to the frame of mind she was then in, was
infinitely more grateful than the more soft and glowing
landscape.</p>

<p>As she continued her ramble through the most woody part of the
grounds, one object above all others engaged her attention, and
excited her surprise.</p>

<p>This was a small square tower that once belonged to the
fortification wall of the castle, which had formerly spread along a
vast extent of ground, including the principal part of the forest;
the design of which was evidently that, in case of a siege, a
sufficient quantity of cattle might be pastured to supply the
inhabitants during the attack. This solitary turret, which, with the
aid of a buttress, had strengthened one of the angles of the exterior
polygon, was all that remained of the out work, and even this was
falling to decay. It was overtopped with long grass, briery, and the
enchanter's nightshade; and being almost immersed in the deep gloom
of the woods, seemed to have become the residence of birds of
prey.</p>

<p>Curiosity impelling her to examine the inside of the fabric, she
entered what had once been a door, and was proceeding through the
arch on the opposite side, when the sound of voices issuing from
below struck her with terror and dismay. The first idea that
presented itself, which the extreme solitude of the situation seemed
to favour, was, that it was the resort of a party of banditti, which
made her irresolute whether to stop for a few minutes to be convinced
if she was right in her conjecture, or to hasten from a place which
threatened her with danger, and return towards the mansion. Whilst
she was thus hesitating, she perceived, at the most remote part of
the structure, a small iron door, and on one side of it, nearly at
the bottom, a narrow grated aperture. An irresistible impulse
impelled her to kneel down, that she might be able to observe to what
part of the building this entrance led; but the light this window
admitted was so feeble, that she could but just distinguish a small
extent of passage, which apparently terminated in a flight of stone
steps.</p>

<p>In a state of inconceivable dread she listened for some moments to
be assured from whence the voices proceeded; but the deep sighing of
the wind among the trees prevented her from discriminating any other
sound. Anxious to be assured who were the people thus strangely
secluded in the subterranean recesses of this gloomy abode, and to be
acquainted with the purpose of their concealment, she advanced
fearfully towards the door, and examining it attentively, endeavoured
to discover some way of opening it; but no visible means appearing,
she pressed forcibly against it, and to her utter astonishment it
unclosed. Thus enabled to gratify a curiosity which was augmented by
the small prospect of gratification the first view of it had
presented, she walked slowly through the passage, and was within a
few paces of the stairs when a deep groan, which was instantly
succeeded by the clinking of a chain, overcame her with horror and
amazement. Fear having suspended her faculties, she stood for a few
seconds motionless as a statue, totally unable either to proceed or
to return, till a loud voice, elevated as in anger, recovered her
from her stupor, which being answered in the low, mournful accents of
entreaty, convinced her that some unhappy being was suffering in that
unfrequented and dreary solitude; but, as the turret belonged
immediately to the castle, who could be the tyrant, and who the
prisoner, was strange beyond conjecture.</p>

<p>As soon as she was enabled to conquer the terror this incident had
occasioned, she again advanced towards the stairs, and in the pauses
of the wind heard these words distinctly pronounced, in a voice which
she immediately knew to be Paoli's:--</p>

<p>'You have had a sufficient time allowed you, and as death is
inevitable, and nothing can procure even a temporary respite, you
have only to chuse the means. I leave this place to-day. The moments
are precious, therefore be hasty in your determination.'</p>

<p>These incoherent expressions were enough to assure her that some
person was confined in that place for the purpose of being murdered.
Almost fainting with apprehension, she receded as far as the
entrance, and holding the iron door with her hand, was irresolute
whether to return again towards the steps, or to hurry from the spot.
As she stood for a few moments endeavouring to overcome the agony
that this strange adventure had excited, as well as to consider if it
was not possible, by timely interference, to avert the fate that
awaited this victim of perhaps unjust resentment, she heard a noise
like the undrawing of rusty bolts, which was followed by the sound of
footsteps, apparently proceeding towards her.</p>

<p>Knowing this could be no other than Paoli, she closed the door
that led into the passage, and rapidly retreating, concealed herself
in the thick foliage of the trees that surrounded the lonely turret;
but in such a situation, that she must unavoidably see him pass.</p>

<p>In a few minutes he quitted the tower; and having turned into the
glade, was hastily putting something into his pocket, when the
rustling of the trees, under which Madame Chamont had secreted
herself to elude being noticed by him, made him start involuntarily,
and what he was attempting to secure fell upon the ground. The grass
preventing any noise, he was unconscious of his loss, and, seemingly
satisfied with being undiscovered, walked speedily away.</p>

<p>Paoli having reached a considerable distance, Madame Chamont
emerged from her obscurity, and on gaining the spot the steward had
recently left, beheld, to her unutterable joy, a small rusty key,
which she had no doubt belonged to the dungeon where the sufferer was
confined.</p>

<p>For some time she was undetermined whether immediately to release
the unfortunate captive from his state of misery and perplexity, or
to return to the castle, and to perform that office of humanity as
soon as Paoli had quitted it, who had just intimated an intention of
commencing his journey without further delay. On mature deliberation
the latter plan was adopted; as, should the careful steward be aware
of his loss before his arrival at the mansion, he would probably
return in hopes of being able to recover it, in which case her
generous designs would not only be frustrated, but instant death, or
new and unheard-of torture might be inflicted upon the ill-fated
object of her compassion.</p>

<p>This being resolved upon, she returned towards the castle elated
at the thoughts of being able to release a fellow-creature from the
grasp of inflexible tyranny, and secretly determining not to acquaint
Laurette with the adventure, as it was impossible that an affair of
that kind could be executed without the knowledge and consent of the
Marchese; consequently, was she to be informed of this singular
circumstance, she would reflect upon him, whom she had every reason
to believe was the author of her being, with horror and aversion.</p>

<p>As soon as she had reached the outer court, she beheld her
beautiful charge, with the airy lightness of a sylph, advancing to
meet her; an emotion of joy played upon her features, and the usual
salutations being over, she presented her with a letter from
Enr&icirc;co.</p>

<p>Madame Chamont's feelings on this occasion can better be imagined
than described. The intelligence the epistle conveyed was of the most
pleasing kind; he spoke highly of his Colonel, the Marchese de
Martilini, and rapturously of the way of life in which he had
engaged. He also informed them that, as his regiment, at the close of
the year, was likely to be stationed in a less remote province, he
entertained some hopes of being permitted to pay his respects to his
beloved mother and his dear Laurette, at the expiration of a few
months.</p>

<p>Thus effectually relieved from a painful inquietude, Madame
Chamont, though she could not forbear slightly censuring the
negligence that had given rise to it, felt a degree of tranquillity
and animation which she had been long unused to.</p>

<p>As soon as she arrived at the castle, she found Paoli was already
returned; and being assured, from his manner, that he had not seen
her in the forest, scrupulously avoided mentioning any thing in his
presence relative to her excursion.</p>

<p>Immediately on his departure she resolved, though enervated with
the terror this occurrence had excited, to visit the solitary tower,
and to liberate the unfortunate captive. The more she considered this
singular incident, the more mysterious it appeared. If the Marchese
had received any material injury from the prisoner, why not resign
him to the laws of his country? Or, if the offence was of too venial
a nature for justice to punish with death, or sufferance, why confine
him at so vast a distance from his own residence, when assassination,
or torture, might have been inflicted with equal secrecy and success
in the dungeons of the Castello St Aubin? What Paoli had uttered
before he quitted his victim was expressive of the most arbitrary
conduct; for though it allowed him the choice of means, this affected
clemency was counteracted by a repetition of threats, which could not
fail to appal the most resolute mind. He mentioned, during this
conference, his intention of leaving the castle immediately, and the
necessity of a hasty determination respecting the method of
accomplishing the design; yet the matter seemed not to have been
decided; no violent measures had at present been adopted, no screams
of terror, or of agonizing torture, had pierced the deep solitude of
the woods. The unfortunate being was then assuredly alive, though
probably left to perish by poison, or the pining miseries of famine.
More than once it occurred to her thoughts that it might possibly be
La Roque; yet the length of time that had elapsed since her meeting
with him at the post house, did not justify the opinion, as, had he
so long escaped falling into the hands of his enemy, he would surely,
before this time, have placed himself beyond the reach of his malice.
The clinking of a chain, so distinctly heard from the place,
convinced her of the difficulty of her enterprize; but recollecting
that amongst a quantity of old lumber, in one of the chambers in the
northern buildings, she had observed several files, and other
instruments, which might be useful in the undertaking, she hastened
to find them.</p>

<p>Having obtained the means of admission, she entered this range of
apartments, which, from superstition, or some more rational motive,
were kept constantly fastened, and in one of the most
desolate-looking rooms, discovered the objects of her search. They
were thrown into a remote corner, with a considerable number of
broken helmets, shields, corselets, and other military accoutrements,
with some fragments of different kinds of tapestry, and a large heap
of rusty keys, which seemed to have remained in a state of inactivity
for many years. After availing herself of these treasures, whilst
Laurette was employed in her morning amusements and exercises, with a
hurried step and palpitating heart she bent her way towards the
tower.</p>

<p>When she arrived at the entrance, she looked fearfully round, lest
any one should observe her; but no one approaching, and no sound, not
even the flutter of the breeze, disturbing the awful stillness of the
place, she ventured to proceed. The iron door, as on a former
occasion, gave way to a forcible pressure, and having reached the
passage, that only admitted the light of a small grated aperture, she
distinguished the flight of steps which she had perceived before.</p>

<p>Beyond this all was dark; but having with much difficulty groped
her way till she had obtained the bottom of the stairs, she proceeded
through a vast extent of passage, and was then enabled to observe, by
the feeble ray of a lamp that glimmered through a crevice in the
wall, a door which, from the appearance of the light, seemed to be
that leading into the dungeon. As she paused for a moment, to find
the key, a deep sigh, that might be said to breathe the language of
despair, broke the sepulchral kind of stillness that had hitherto
prevailed.</p>

<p>Having, with much difficulty, applied the key to the door, she
withdrew the bolts, which the wretched inhabitant of this dark abyss
supposing to be a prelude to death, or some new calamity, answered
with a scream. 'Whoever you are,' cried Madame Chamont, in a low
disordered voice, 'whom guilt or misfortune have brought to this
miserable abode, I beseech you to be comforted.' Having uttered these
words, she listened for a moment, but all was again silent; no sound
was returned, which made it probable that her words were unheard, or
disregarded. Much strength was requisite in the accomplishment of her
purpose, for the lock was so rusted by time and neglect, that it was
impossible for so feeble and delicate a hand to make it (without
painful exertion) perform its long-forgotten office. By repeated
efforts she was, however, enabled to put her designs in execution,
and opening the door, which turned sullenly on its grating hinges,
she beheld, in one corner of the dungeon, a pale, emaciated figure
seated upon straw. An emotion of terror seemed to have deprived him
of reason, which prevented him from attending to the compassionate
exclamation of his deliverer; and having covered his face with his
hands, he did not perceive her approach till she was within a few
steps of the place where he was sitting. A second address, however,
uttered in the plaintive accents of pity, roused him from his stupor,
and discovered to Madame Chamont the features of La Roque, who,
instead of the messenger of death which his affrighted imagination
had portrayed, beheld the still beautiful form of his former
benefactress.</p>

<p>After quieting his apprehensions, by convincing him of the
possibility of effecting an escape, she raised the lamp from the
ground and having used many ineffectual efforts to release him from
his fetters, finally succeeded in her design.</p>

<p>The effusions of his gratitude for some time deprived the
astonished La Roque of utterance; but his feelings being now too
violent to be restrained, he burst into a flood of tears. Joy and
compassion operated as powerfully in the mind of Madame Chamont, who
having, after many arduous endeavours, entirely accomplished his
deliverance, assisted in raising him from the ground, and led him
from the dungeon.</p>

<p>Those who have been long secluded from the beauties of Nature in a
miserable subterranean abode, can only form an adequate conception of
the raptures experienced by La Roque on his sudden emancipation from
captivity. A few minutes before, he was in continual expectation of a
miserable death, hopeless, and, as he believed, beyond the reach of
compassion; now he was restored to a world from which he imagined
himself separated for ever, was permitted to behold the beautiful
face of Nature, to hear again the melody of the birds, and to feel
the enlivening breath of the zephyr; yet so much was he enervated by
confinement, and his ancles were so weakened by manacles, that he was
unable to walk without support.</p>

<p>Madame Chamont, who at first thought only of the means of
deliverance, now foresaw difficulties which her mind had not been
collected enough to have contemplated before. She had now conducted
La Roque from his dreadful abode, but in what manner he was to be
disposed of was an idea that never occurred to her before. After
having suffered much from the dark vapours of a dungeon, from the
miserable confinement of chains and fetters, with the addition of
spare and meagre diet, he wanted assistance and support. This
rendered it impossible for him to prosecute his journey without
needful rest and refreshment; yet how was this to be procured, since
it could not be accomplished without assistance, and this would be
attended not only with difficulty, but with danger? She was resolved,
however, to procure him some food without further delay, and having
seated him upon a projection of stone in the turret, gave him a
promise that she would speedily return, and hurried towards the
castle.</p>

<p>As she went, she began to reflect upon the necessity of coming to
a speedy resolution in this important affair, as to the manner of
proceeding in it; for should the loss of the key be discovered, it
might occasion the return of Paoli, which would render abortive every
scheme she had devised for the preservation of the prisoner.</p>

<p>After much consideration, she found it would be impossible to
convey La Roque to his place of destination without some one to
assist her in the enterprise; and knowing the prudence and secrecy of
the faithful Doroth&eacute;e, resolved to make her a confidante in
the undertaking. This matter being settled, she proceeded towards the
mansion with redoubled alacrity; and having acquainted her servant
with the adventure, desired that she would take some food and wine to
La Roque in the turret of the forest. The good woman, whose
tenderness and compassion were equally awakened, cheerfully obeyed
the summons, whilst Madame Chamont retired to her apartment to
consider the most effectual way of rendering herself serviceable to
the much-injured La Roque, that he might be immediately placed in
security, and herself avoid detection. She saw the policy of a hasty
removal, yet was anxious that he should first recover from that state
of weakness and indisposition, to which grief and imprisonment had
reduced him.</p>

<p>Whilst she still continued to muse upon this affecting incident,
without being able to adopt any plan for her future conduct, the
arrival of Father Benedicta, her confessor, broke in upon her
reflections.</p>

<p>As she surveyed the placid countenance of this holy Father,
lighted up by the smile of benevolence, and glowing with universal
philanthropy, the idea of soliciting his protection instantly
occurred to her. With his assistance La Roque might take refuge in
the monastery till he was in a condition to travel, and in the habit
of a Friar, which could easily be procured, might be secure from the
possibility of discovery.</p>

<p>This plan appeared so much more eligible than any she had before
conceived, that she was resolved to put it into execution. As soon as
the Monk was seated, having first expatiated upon the duties of
charity, she informed him that an unfortunate stranger, whom she had
lately met with under peculiar circumstances, which were at present
somewhat veiled in mystery, had much interested her compassion. That
there were reasons, with which she was herself partly unacquainted,
why he must be secluded from observation till he could prosecute the
remaining part of his journey without farther injury to his health;
and from the exemplary piety and general benevolence of her revered
Father, she had flattered herself that he would, if possible, offer
him an asylum till that period arrived. She forbore mentioning any
thing of the Marchese, and even of Paoli, and entirely avoided the
subject of his imprisonment.</p>

<p>Father Benedicta, who regarded her, during this discourse, with a
look of tenderness and admiration that encouraged her to proceed,
easily discovered, from the timid hesitation of her manner, that she
was not only much concerned in the fate of the stranger, but that
there was something connected with the affair which prudence forbade
her to reveal.</p>

<p>Having desisted from any inquiry that might tend to heighten her
anxiety, he readily assented to her desire of affording him a place
of security, appointing an hour in which he would meet them at the
end of the eastern rampart, for the purpose of conducting him to the
cloister.</p>

<p>As soon as the Friar was departed, Madame Chamont formed an excuse
to Laurette for her absence, and then returned towards the tower,
where she found La Roque considerably revived by the salutary relief
which the castle had afforded, and anxious to assure her of the
extent of his gratitude.</p>

<p>Having seated herself by his side, she informed him of her newly
concerted scheme of placing him in the monastery under the patronage
and protection of Father Benedicta, whose benevolent acquiescence had
delivered her, she added, from much apprehension and perplexity on
his account, from which place he might escape in the dress of the
order; and should his flight be discovered by the return of the
steward, he might be easily defended from the vigilance of his
pursuers in so holy a disguise.</p>

<p>This proposal, that promised at once secrecy and security, was
accepted with transport; and La Roque being evidently much recovered
by the attentions bestowed upon him since his confinement, Madame
Chamont made some inquiries concerning his daughter, who she learned
was consigned to the care of a generous protector; and then reminded
him of the promise made to her at the post-house of relating his
story, at the same time desiring him to desist if he found himself
unequal to the task.</p>

<p>Having acknowledged the justice of the claim, and given his assent
to the proposition, he hesitated for a few moments, as if to acquire
additional fortitude; and then checking a tear, the obtrusion of
which seemed to have been occasioned by the recollection of some
recent calamity, he thus began his narration.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

<p><b>THE STORY OF LA ROQUE</b></p>

<pre>
List a brief tale.
And when 'tis told, Oh! that my heart would break.
The bloody proclamation to escape.
--SHAKESPEARE
</pre>

<p>'My real name, which from unavoidable circumstances I have for
some time disguised under that of La Roque, is Conte della Croisse.'
Madame Chamont started, and with much difficulty concealing her
emotions, La Roque proceeded:</p>

<p>'Being early in life deprived of my parents, I was consigned by my
father to the guardianship of the late Marchese de Montferrat; and,
immediately on his decease, quitted Naples, the ancient seat of my
ancestors, and repaired to the environs of Turin.</p>

<p>'Being too young to know the extent of my loss, the affectionate
behaviour of the Marchese, and still gentler attentions of the
Marchesa, soon relieved me from unpleasant recollections, and
restored me to my former felicity. Masters were procured to instruct
me in the classics and different sciences; as it was the particular
request of my dying father, who had an unconquerable aversion to
public seminaries, that my education should be a private one.</p>

<p>'My time, now chiefly devoted to literary pursuits, fled rapidly
away; and my guardian beheld the progress I made with satisfaction
and complacency.</p>

<p>'The family at the Castello St Aubin, consisted of the Marchese,
the Marchesa, one daughter (who was somewhat younger than myself),
and a large number of domestics.</p>

<p>'The hospitality and generosity inseparable from the inhabitants
of this princely abode, was become proverbial. Every countenance
expressed disinterested affection, content, and innocence; and every
breast was animated with truth, sincerity, and virtue.</p>

<p>'The first serious uneasiness I experienced, after the loss of my
parents, was occasioned by the death of the Marchesa, who died, much
regretted, in consequence of a fever that proved fatal after a few
days' illness. The Marchese was for some time inconsolable for her
loss, and instead of mixing as usual with the world, abandoned
himself to solitude; till an habitual melancholy was stealing
gradually upon his mind, which threatened the most unhappy
consequences.</p>

<p>'Whilst he was yet yielding to the influence of unavailing regret,
he received a visit from a relation who had been some years abroad,
and for whom he had conceived a peculiar regard. This unexpected
event had so happy an effect upon him, that with much persuasion, he
consented to accompany his friend on an expedition to Verona, for the
recovery of his health and spirits.</p>

<p>'He had not been there long before he was struck with the singular
beauty of a young Signora, much his inferior in point of rank and
fortune, but whose person, he imagined, resembled that of the once
lovely Marchesa. Opportunity threw her frequently in his way, and,
finding her affections were disengaged, he offered her his hand,
which she readily accepted; and the marriage being solemnized during
the Marchese's continuance at Verona, they returned to the
Castello.</p>

<p>'It was easy to discover, even on a transient acquaintance, that
the mind of the young Marchesa was much inferior to that of her
predecessor; with whose manners, the haughtiness of disposition she
early displayed, formed a striking contrast. She did not long,
however, enjoy newly acquired dignities; but having given birth to a
son about a year after her marriage, soon afterwards expired.</p>

<p>'About this period, Helena, the daughter of my guardian, having
completed her education at Naples, returned to the Castello. Her
vivacity and sweetness of demeanour soon dissipated the clouds that
shaded the brow of the Marchese, and diffused universal tranquillity
around. During the infancy of the young Signor, her brother, she
attended to him with the undeviating affection of a parent; and the
family, under her gentle authority, were re-instated in their
original felicity.</p>

<p>'To have been continually in the presence of the beautiful Helena
without feeling the power of her attractions, would justly have
exposed me to the imputation of stoicism; a short time convinced me
that I had too little of that cold philosophy in my heart to be
insensible to the most modest graces of her person, or the angelic
sweetness of her disposition. I had soon the consolation of
discovering that our feelings were mutual, and had the satisfaction
of perceiving that the Marchese beheld this growing attachment with
approbation.</p>

<p>'The period was now arrived in which some knowledge of the world
was supposed to be requisite; and, accompanied by another young
nobleman, whose name was Berlotto, I made the tour of Europe.</p>

<p>'Having visited several of the principal Courts, and seen the most
valuable vestiges of antiquity, my companion became weary of the
expedition, and expressed his impatience to return; but as much
remained to be seen, which was sufficiently interesting to merit
observation, and as yet my thirst for information was ungratified, I
was deaf to the intreaties he employed for the accomplishment of his
desire, till an alarming account of the declining health of the
Marchese altered my resolution.</p>

<p>'On my arrival at the Castello St Aubin I found him much worse
than I had reason to apprehend; and soon afterwards the progress of
his disorder was so rapid as to preclude the probability of a
recovery. Perfectly sensible of his danger, he summoned me to the
side of his bed; and, warmly commending the young Signor to my
friendship and protection, soon afterwards expired.</p>

<p>'It was now necessary to exert all the fortitude that Nature had
bestowed upon me, as well to rouse myself from the state of
despondency that succeeded the death of so valuable a friend, as to
mitigate the sorrows of the affectionate Helena. During the illness
of the Marchese, a female relation of his was sent for to the
Castello, who was now resident in the family. She was past the bloom
of youth; but possessed some accomplishments and much good-humour,
and seemed anxious to afford consolation.</p>

<p>'When the time of mourning was expired, and grief had in some
measure yielded to the certain effects of time, finding that Helena
still continued to receive my attentions with courtesy, I ventured to
declare my love. She was too frank, too innocent for disguise; and,
confessing a mutual attachment, gave me her hand at once, to reward
and to confirm my virtues.</p>

<p>'After this event, as the time of my minority was expired, we
repaired to Naples; and, in that city, enjoyed more pure and
uninterrupted felicity than usually falls to the lot of
mortality.</p>

<p>'The young Signor, now Marchese de Montferrat, soon after the
celebration of our nuptials, was removed to a public school in the
vicinity; and from the proficiency he made in all the branches of
literature, and the early genius he displayed, attained every mark of
distinction to which he had ambitiously aspired. But, as he arrived
towards manhood, it was easy to discover that his mind possessed more
brilliancy than energy; and through the exterior accomplishments of
the gentleman, an accurate observer might distinguish some qualities,
which, though early veiled in dissimulation, were unpromising as well
to the man as to the scholar.--He wished to appear virtuous, without
doing violence to his inclinations by becoming so; refusing to deny
himself the smallest gratification to obtain, what is much more
estimable than popular applause, the approbation of his own heart.
Wearing publicly the semblance of goodness, he so far succeeded in
his desires as to impose himself upon the greater part of the world,
who are only superficial observers, as a miracle of worth and
honour.</p>

<p>'About a year after our marriage, the happiness we had hitherto
enjoyed was augmented by the birth of a son; which event was
celebrated by a fete, given at a beautiful villa in the environs of
Naples, to which, as a summer residence, we frequently resorted.</p>

<p>'On this occasion, several of the Neapolitan Nobles were present,
and, amongst others, the Conte de Pietro, who was introduced to me by
an acquaintance with whom I had been lately in habits of intimacy,
having newly arrived in the province.</p>

<p>'This much-esteemed courtier was just returned from his travels;
and, compared with many that were present, who had seen life with
equal advantages, displayed many shining perfections--in conversation
he was polite, easy, and communicative; and there was an air of
unreserve, and at the same time, of dignity in his manners, which
could not fail to attract the admiration of congenial minds. The
deference he paid to my opinion in every subject of discourse, and
the warmth with which he applauded every sentiment I expressed, could
not fail of exciting somewhat of vanity in my breast, when I
perceived the countenances of others soliciting his regard without
equal success.--From this aera I date most of my succeeding
misfortunes. We had early conceived a partiality for each other; and
I naturally considered a man of his easy address, fashionable
accomplishments, and literary attainments, as a most valuable
acquisition to my domestic happiness.</p>

<p>'The affluence of his circumstances enabled him to indulge himself
unrestrainedly in those pleasures to which he was the most addicted,
and allowed him the gratification of performing many acts of
benevolence, which considerably exalted him in my estimation.</p>

<p>'The dissipation of the metropolis was every way suited to the
gaiety of his mind, where his rank, his person, and his lively parts
quickly introduced him into the first assemblies; gaining him
universal applause in all places of public resort which he honoured
with his attention.</p>

<p>'With the other sex he was a general favourite; for he was by no
means insensible to the attractions of beauty, though he might be
said to be incapable of a sincere and honourable attachment. No
dissimulation, however, veiled for a moment his natural character: he
was ostentatious in his gallantries, and open in his amours. He
smiled when I expatiated on the happiness arising from the
endearments of a beloved wife and a beautiful offspring; for his
attentions having been confined to the gay, the light, and the
dissipated, he knew not the value of an inviolable attachment.
Anxious to lead me from those home-bred pleasures that my Helena had
endeared to me, he used many arguments for the accomplishment of his
purpose; and though at first they were firmly opposed, yet, becoming
by degrees too powerful for resistance, they at length finally
succeeded.</p>

<p>'When the mind once deviates from the path of virtue, it soon
becomes reconciled to vice; and the habits of life into which I was
continually led, began imperceptibly to destroy my natural feelings
of rectitude, and to take from depravity the restraints of
conscience.</p>

<p>'From a long course of perpetual and, I may add, guilty
indulgences, what had formerly afforded the most serene satisfaction,
became tasteless and disgusting; since the most worthy occupations
were exchanged for debauchery, and that time, which used formerly to
be devoted to the welfare of my family, was divided between the
Theatre, the Opera, and the Gaming-house.</p>

<p>'The Contessa's attachment to the country occasioned her to reside
chiefly at the villa; and, as she partook but little of the
amusements of Naples, she was for some time spared the uneasiness
which a knowledge of my excesses would have inevitably produced. At
first she expressed some degree of pleasure at my having found
entertainment in society; but when my absences became more frequent,
though she forbore reproaches, her countenance sufficiently testified
her disapprobation of my conduct.</p>

<p>'A daughter was now added to our family; after which event my wife
was for some weeks so ill that her life was supposed to be in danger,
during which time my anxiety was so great that I never quitted her
room; but, contrary to my expectation, the disease, when arrived at
the crisis, took a favourable turn, and she recovered. My joy at this
moment was beyond all bounds; for a sense of her condition had
recalled me to reason, and I felt anxious, by convincing her of my
affection, to atone for the errors of my past conduct.</p>

<p>'No sooner was she restored to my wishes, than I received a visit
from the Conte de Pietro, who congratulated me on this happy event;
and observing that I looked ill, and that too much confinement had
injured my health, endeavoured to prevail upon me to accompany him on
an excursion to Padua. At first I persisted in rejecting the
proposal; but Helena, whose mind was reassured by the attention I had
paid her in retirement, and with the tender anxiety I had discovered
on her account, prevailed upon me to accept of it, and in a few days
we commenced our journey.</p>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>

<pre>
Hark!
Waked--from according Lyres the sweet restrain flows
In symphony divine; from air to air.
The trembling numbers fly, swift bursts away
The flow of joy.
--LANGHORNE
</pre>

<p>'Not many days after my arrival in Padua, as I was walking with De
Pietro, by the side of the Brenta, our steps were arrested by the
tones of a lute, accompanied by a female voice, which breathed such
exquisite sweetness that we were unable to move from the spot. Whilst
we still continued to listen, in wrapt and silent attention, the
strain ceased, the plaintive notes of the instrument died into
silence, and, in a few moments, we perceived a gondola, from which
the melodious accents proceeded, approaching towards the margin of
the river. Anxious to behold the musician and songstress who had
possessed such powers of enchantment over us, we still lingered on
the banks till the gondoliers rested upon their oars, and we beheld
two females come on shore, who were escorted by a young Signor
apparently of the middle rank of life.--They were both veiled; but
the graceful figure of the younger, for the other seemed to have
passed the summer of her days, chiefly attracted our regard. Fancy
had portrayed a face not less beautiful than the form to which it
belonged; and I was anxious to be assured whether she had not been
too profuse of her colouring, when a ruder breeze from the water
wafted aside the light texture of her veil, and discovered the
original.</p>

<p>'It was a face that could not be gazed upon with indifference; it
did not possess the insipid uniformity of perfect beauty; but there
was something in it infinitely more attractive than the most exact
harmony of feature could have bestowed, divested of that
inexpressible charm, which gave animation and loveliness to the
whole. The blush that suffused her cheek, at being thus unexpectedly
exposed to the rude gaze of admiration, gave new graces to her
person. Having directed her eyes upwards, which were dazzlingly
bright, she drew her veil over her face, with a look that expressed
somewhat of distress; and taking the arm of her companion, hastened
along the banks of the river.</p>

<p>'The Conte having intimated a desire to follow them to their home,
I gladly consented to attend him; and, keeping a respectful distance,
we followed slowly behind.</p>

<p>'Our way lay, for a considerable time, along the borders of the
Brenta; and during this pursuit the beautiful Stranger frequently
turned, as if to discern whether we were near them; and then, in
apparent confusion, hastened her steps, as if anxious to elude our
observation.</p>

<p>'Having ascended the cliff, contrary to our expectation, they took
a road which did not lead into the city; and the young Signor that
attended them, who appeared to be only a school-boy, having resigned
the lute which he had carried for the beautiful songstress, took a
contrary direction.</p>

<p>'Our curiosity was now too much excited to enable us to relinquish
a project, whose novelty was attended with so much pleasure; and
having proceeded through a vista, we reached the confines of a simple
but elegant villa, whose situation was equally secluded and
picturesque:--It was seated upon a gentle acclivity; and being nearly
surrounded with groves of citron, acacia, and mountain ash, which
were tastefully interspersed with a number of variegated shrubs
peculiar to the climate of Italy, formed one of the most delightful
landscapes we had ever seen.</p>

<p>'Having arrived within a few paces of a gate, leading into a kind
of shrubbery, which seemed to be a private entrance, the laws of
politeness would have compelled us to recede, had not the necessity
of this conduct been prevented by a trifling occurrence:</p>

<p>'A snake, which had concealed itself in the grass, had assailed
the ankle of the youngest Signora, and the alarm this circumstance
occasioned was so excessive, that I had no sooner flown to her
assistance, and accomplished her release from this venomous attack,
than she fell senseless in my arms. A rivulet that wandered among the
recesses of the shade, inclosing this sylvan retreat, supplied us
with water, and soon afterwards, to my unspeakable satisfaction, she
recovered.</p>

<p>'When this was effected, the elder lady abounded in the most
eloquent expressions of gratitude, whilst the young one thanked me
rather with her looks than with her words.</p>

<p>'Having supported the fair invalid into the mansion, we were
ushered into a room genteelly, but not expensively furnished, where
we were courteously accommodated with seats; and when the alarm was
dispelled that this little accident had produced, had the consolation
of seeing the countenance of the interesting stranger animated with
smiles, and sparkling with intelligence. She called me her deliverer;
and when addressing herself to me, there was a bewitching softness in
her eyes, a fascination in her voice and manners, that would have
warmed a heart less susceptible than mine. In those moments even
Helena was forgot; and, as the Conte steadfastly observed my
emotions, there was an air of triumph in his countenance when I
adverted to the incident that had obtained for us the gratification
we desired, which did not escape my notice.</p>

<p>'Laurentina, which was the name of the syren, at the desire of
Signora Bairdiella, who was her aunt, presented us with some fruit,
the produce of her garden; and then, at our joint solicitation, took
her lute, which she again touched with exquisite expression, and
performed some of the finest Italian compositions with inimitable
grace and sweetness.</p>

<p>'The hours flew so rapidly away that it was late before we
departed; which we could not prevail upon ourselves to accelerate
without requesting permission to repeat our visit at a more
convenient season.</p>

<p>'In this we succeeded; and so well availed ourselves of this
indulgence, that not a day passed in which we did not repair
together, or severally, to the villa of Salazzar.</p>

<p>'Laurentina possessed wit, sentiment, and tenderness--every thing
I valued most, and least expected to find united with such youth and
beauty; and was apparently so much interested in my appearance, and
so much flattered by my attentions and conversation, that I felt
unusually delighted in her presence. Every interview tended to
increase her partiality in my favour, as well as to convince me that
my attachment to her person and accomplishments was become too
powerful for resistance, and that her society was necessary to my
happiness, if not to my existence.</p>

<p>'After about a fortnight's residence in the city, the Conte de
Pietro discontinued his visits to the villa; observing with a
sarcastic smile, at which I was not so much offended as I ought to
have been, that though Laurentina was as beautiful as an angel, he
was too much my friend to endeavour to deprive me of so inestimable a
jewel; then assuring me that if I continued the siege, she would not
long continue inexorable. He proceeded to inform me of some traits in
the character of her aunt, Signora Bairdiella, particularly that of
avarice, which might eventually prove favourable to my wishes; and of
some hints which he had received from a native of Padua respecting
the conduct of Laurentina. They were of a nature to encourage hope,
and I felt still more elevated at the discovery. 'The ascendancy over
me that the Conte possessed, was increased by a more powerful
attraction than what had hitherto cemented our affections--from the
infatuated regard which my own vanity and susceptibility, as much as
her own art and loveliness had made me experience for Laurentina.</p>

<p>'When under the dominion of passion we are insensible to the
influence of reason, Vice, on a nearer acquaintance, loses her
deformity; and the mind abating in its vigour, and being no longer
able to resist the force of temptation, finally espouses her
cause.</p>

<p>'Having given a thousand imaginary perfections to the object of my
admiration, of which I could not easily divest her, the enterprize in
which I had engaged, on a transient survey appeared to me more
difficult than it eventually proved, which the extreme innocence of
Laurentina's looks and manners contributed to increase, at the same
time that it established the affection I had conceived for her on a
firmer basis.</p>

<p>'The unbounded hospitality with which I had been treated by
Signora Bertola, ever since the commencement of our acquaintance,
aided by the respectful politeness that accompanied her attentions,
were circumstances favourable to my wishes; particularly as I had
never imposed myself upon her niece as an unmarried man, and she was
too much a woman of the world to mistake the warm addresses of the
lover, for the temperate assiduity of the friend.</p>

<p>'Having some reason to believe, from what I had heard from De
Pietro, that she would not oppose my designs upon her beautiful
dependant, I requested an audience with her in private; and, after
avowing my passion for Laurentina, proposed a handsome addition to
her own fortune, with a considerable settlement upon her niece, on
her consent to accompany me to Naples. I lamented that it was not in
my power to offer her my hand; but did not neglect to assure her that
unremitting attention should be paid to her desires, since the
affection her merit had excited would find its chief gratification in
ensuring her felicity.</p>

<p>'At first she objected to the proposition with a degree of
earnestness, which, considering what was past, and the report I had
heard previous to this declaration, filled me with surprise and
consternation; but the largeness of my offers eventually silenced her
scruples, and she promised to exert her influence in my cause.</p>

<p>'I did not long suffer the tortures of suspense; but the
conditions were such that, if I had not proceeded too far to recede,
would have recalled me to the path of rectitude: they were, that if,
during the lifetime of Laurentina, I should be left in a state of
widowhood, I was to repair her injured reputation by making her
Contessa della Croisse, should I have no reason to suspect her
fidelity.</p>

<p>'This promise was to be delivered to Signora Bairdiella in
writing;--I complied, but shuddered as I penned it. The image of my
Helena was presented to my imagination at the moment when I was going
to desert her; the meek, the unoffending innocence of her conduct,
her purity, her tenderness, the unaffected graces of her person
appeared as rising up in judgment against me, and staggered my
resolution. But one empassioned look from the insidious Laurentina,
one word from her, uttered in the tremulous accents of genuine
affection, were sufficient to silence the eloquent pleadings of
reason, and to stifle the impulses of virtue and compassion.</p>

<p>'The time now drew near in which we were to quit Padua, and
already had I received several letters from my wife which gently
chided my absence; and having previously taken lodgings for
Laurentina, in one of the principal streets in the city, for her
immediate reception, we proceeded towards Naples. With a heart not
much at ease, I placed my fair favourite in her new situation, and
repaired to the villa.</p>

<p>'Those who have lost that calm dignity of mind that accompanies
conscious rectitude, will only form an adequate idea of my feelings.
When I met those artless expressions of unalterable regard which
marked the deportment of Helena, I felt a sensation of anguish at
that moment more keen than I had ever experienced, and would have
given worlds to have regained that integrity of soul which I was now
capable of estimating--that internal satisfaction which is the
offspring of uncorrupted virtue. Reflection now became torture; and,
unable to escape from it whilst thus exposed to its influence, I
fought to bury it in dissipation.</p>

<p>'The conversation of Helena could only bestow a charm on minds
serene and angel-like as her's; and what had formerly so largely
contributed to my happiness, now became my aversion; I felt my
inferiority, and wished to hide it from all, and even from
myself.</p>

<p>'My time was now chiefly divided between Laurentina and the Conte
de Pietro; for the former I took a house in one of the squares, which
was furnished with much expence and magnificence suitable to her
taste and inclination.</p>

<p>'To conceal Laurentina from the knowledge of the Contessa, was a
matter which was attended with but little difficulty; since her mind
was too pure for suspicion and jealousy, and it was easy for a less
able dissembler than myself to deceive her. Independent of this, I
had also an experienced assistant in the Conte, who frequently, in
her presence, delivered a lecture upon the wise government of wives;
in which there was something so smart, and yet so unoffending, that
it was impossible not to be pleased with him.</p>

<p>'But when my absences became still more frequent, the mild
dejection of her looks testified her uneasiness at my conduct, whilst
I was compelled to hide the pang of distress and the stingings of
remorse, under an affected appearance of gaiety.</p>

<p>'When nearly two years had elapsed, I found my expenses were so
materially increased, having also lost many considerable sums at the
gaming-table, that I began to be seriously alarmed. Laurentina, under
a character which she had artfully assumed for the accomplishment of
my destruction, disguised many of her sex's frailties: she was
passionately fond of equipage and shew, and was not only elegant, but
magnificent in her attire. The profusion of jewels she demanded were
adequate to the expenses of my household; and finding that my
situation was becoming desperate, I hinted the affair to De Pietro,
who advised me to forsake Laurentina.</p>

<p>'Though from the uneasy sensations I had experienced ever since
the commencement of my folly, a separation would assuredly have been
desirable; but there appeared a degree of cruelty in this method of
proceeding which I could not immediately reconcile to my feelings.
The Conte anticipated my meaning, and took some pains to convince me,
that amours of that kind did not require that delicacy of sentiment
which I believed to be requisite; for having made a settlement upon
the Signora, her person and accomplishments, he added, would easily
procure her another lover; and she might possibly be a gainer by the
change.</p>

<p>'The idea of her encouraging the addresses of another, my passion
was not sufficiently cooled to reflect upon without emotion, and I
replied, with some warmth, that I did not believe it possible that
the affections of Laurentina could be transferred; and having been
the means of wounding her reputation, I considered myself
indisputably bound to protect her. The Conte regarded me with a look
of surprise and dissatisfaction, and then asked, with an assumed
gravity of appearance, whether I did not suppose Laurentina had other
admirers, who were equally favoured with her attention?--I was too
much irritated by this question not to betray somewhat of anger; and
assured him, with a degree of impetuosity too natural to my
character, that nothing less than ocular demonstration should
convince me that she ever admitted any other visitors.</p>

<p>'The violence of my emotions during this discourse, too plainly
evinced that I was still the slave of an unfortunate attachment; and
De Pietro, with his usual address, finding the subject was a painful
one, endeavoured to change it; but that which he introduced was
foreign to my heart, and I could not join in it.</p>

<p>'When again alone, I began to reflect upon my situation with
redoubled energy; and, after much consideration, resolved immediately
to visit Laurentina, and to inform her, that the immense sums she had
squandered, threatened me with the most serious consequences; and
that it was necessary for her sake, as well as for my own, that new
measures should be adopted.</p>

<p>'Thus determined, I was hastening to execute my design when,
having arrived within a few steps of the door, I was agreeably
surprised on meeting with my old travelling companion, Signor
Berlotte, who expressed much pleasure at this unexpected event.</p>

<p>'He had not been many hours in the city; and having been informed
at Venice, where he was detained some time on business of an
important nature, that I had quitted Naples, he had not yet, he
added, extended his enquiries respecting my present place of
residence; but as it was now his intention to remain some months in
that city, his happiness, he assured me, would be materially
augmented by my society.</p>

<p>'Though, in the early part of my life, I entertained no very high
opinion of the character of Berlotte, knowing that his sentiments
were mean, and his abilities contracted; yet allowing that years and
reflection might have refined the one, and expanded the other, though
I did not express myself on this occasion with equal warmth and
ardour, I was not insensible to his professions of friendship, or
undesirous of cultivating it.</p>

<p>'Having walked with him as far as the hotel, I requested that his
visits might be frequent and without ceremony; and, after giving him
my address, hasted back to Laurentina.</p>

<p>'Not expecting me at so early an hour, my visits being usually
nocturnal ones, I was told she was absent. Believing that she was
only gone on some trifling business, without regarding the answer,
and meaning to wait her return, I walked on to the saloon.</p>

<p>'Having entered this room, the first object that engaged my
attention was a small miniature portrait, suspended over the
chimney-piece by a chain of gold: It was the figure of a young Signor
in a military habit, of a noble and dignified appearance. The
countenance was fine, open, and impressive, and had at once an air of
grandeur and of sweetness. That this was some favoured lover of
Laurentina's was an idea that instantly occurred, and brought with it
all the tortures of jealousy and resentment. The words of De Pietro
returned to my recollection, who I now believed was acquainted with
her inconstancy, and was only prevented from disclosing it by an
unreasonable warmth, which determined me, on a next interview with
him, to interrogate him concerning her.</p>

<p>'When the first emotions of surprise and anger had subsided, I
again took the picture from its place, and was gazing upon it
attentively, when Laurentina entered.</p>

<p>'She started in visible confusion on observing me; but in a moment
recollecting herself, assumed an appearance of composure that filled
me with astonishment, since the miniature was still in my hand, which
I considered as a testimony of her falsehood;</p>

<p>'This, however, she seemed not to regard; but was advancing
towards me with one of those fascinating smiles, which had so often
deceived me, when I demanded, in an authoritative tone, for whom that
portrait was designed? She was too able a practitioner in the art of
dissembling, to suffer the least hesitation to betray her, and
replied emphatically, her brother. I regarded her earnestly as she
spoke, but the undaunted serenity of her countenance was unchanged;
and having expressed my surprise that I had never heard her speak of
her brother, she informed me that he had entered into the service of
his country very early in life, and having been some years abroad, he
had sent her that picture as a memento, which had lately been
conveyed to her by Signora Bairdiella.</p>

<p>'There was too much of the appearance of truth in this recital to
justify suspicion, which made me anxious, by the gentleness of my
manners, to atone for the want of confidence I had betrayed, as well
as to reward the patience with which she had supported it.</p>

<p>'This was no time for expatiating on the necessity of adopting a
plan of economy, being too much humbled by her artifice to propose
any thing on that subject; and having an engagement at the villa, I
left her with many expressions of tenderness, and hasted to fulfil
it.</p>

<p>'The circumstance of the picture, and the conversation of the
Conte, in spite of all my efforts to the contrary, would frequently
return to my memory, and awaken unpleasant surmises. There was indeed
nothing improbable in the story of its being the portrait of her
brother, nor had I any reason, at present, to doubt her veracity; yet
it by no means amounted to conviction.</p>

<p>'Berlotte was now frequently at the villa, and generously made one
in our parties, on private as well as public occasions, though he was
far from being a general favourite. There was indeed nothing
prepossessing in his appearance; and he was justly suspected of
shallowness and affectation.</p>

<p>'My wife, who was candour itself, could not sometimes forbear
uttering something to his disadvantage; his confidence distressed
her, and his conversation at once wounded her feelings, and excited
disgust.</p>

<p>'I now anxiously sought an opportunity of questioning the Conte
concerning Laurentina; and was not long before I succeeded. I found
that nothing material could be alledged against her; but I was still
chagrined and unhappy. De Pietro observed my uneasiness, and being
convinced that a state of suspense is, of all others, the least
supportable, asked me if I would submit to a stratagem, that would at
once either remove or realize my suspicions. Having assured him that
I would gladly embrace any means that could be adopted with honour,
he proposed, that when I next visited Laurentina, I should inform her
that business of importance made me under the necessity of quitting
Naples for a few weeks. That on the supposition that I had put my
intentions in execution, she would consider herself at liberty to
follow her own inclinations; and in the mean time, avoiding
detection, I might observe her actions in those places of public
resort to which she was the most attached.</p>

<p>'This proposal was no sooner made than agreed to; and having
acquainted Laurentina with my design of leaving the city for a few
weeks, on an affair of importance, I became a spy upon her
conduct.</p>

<p>'The masquerade was, I knew, a favourite diversion; and as this
was one of which the Contessa never partook, and a place of more
security than any other, I frequently spent my evenings there with
Laurentina, and determined to make my first trial there.</p>

<p>'I had not been long in this place before a number of dominos
entered the room. To ascertain her by her dress was I knew
impossible, as she seldom appeared twice in the same. But a figure of
more than ordinary elegance, who entered leaning upon the arm of a
young Signor in a blue domino, soon attracted my regard; and this, on
a near view, I conceived to be the object of my search. The jewels
that braided her hair, which I had lately presented to her, convinced
me of the truth of the conjecture; and the suspicion that the person
who attended her was a lover, was soon lost in conviction.</p>

<p>'It was with much difficulty that I was enabled to forbear
discovering myself to her, and of upbraiding her with the infamy of
her proceedings.</p>

<p>'My endeavours to overhear any part of the conversation were
unsuccessful, as it was invariably delivered in a whisper; yet I
still followed, in hopes of hearing something of which I might openly
accuse her, till the rest of the company unmasking, they suddenly
retreated.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

<pre>
Know'st thou not.
That when the searching eye of heav'n is hid
Behind the globe, and lights the lower world.
Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen.
In murders and in outrage, bloody here?
But when from under this terrestrial ball
He fires the proud tops of the Eastern pines.
And darts his light through ev'ry guilty hole.
Then treasons, murders, and detested sins.
The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs.
Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves.
--SHAKESPEARE
</pre>

<p>'The various emotions of rage, jealousy, and remorse that the
conviction of her falsehood had awakened, for some time deprived me
of the power of action; and in a frame of mind little short of
distraction, I returned again to the villa.</p>

<p>'The ruin to which her artifice was leading me, now flashed upon
my mind; the altered looks of the Contessa added keenness to my
affliction, and I felt all the miseries of guilt and anguish.</p>

<p>'Several days passed before I had fixed upon any mode of
proceeding respecting Laurentina; in which time the agitation of my
mind was so great, that my situation was thought to be alarming.</p>

<p>'Affairs were in this train when a Monk of the Crucifix Order
arrived at the villa, who having intimated that his business was of
moment, requested an audience.</p>

<p>'Being admitted into a private apartment, after strictly enjoining
me to secrecy as to what he was about to relate, in a manner not less
singular than impressive, he proceeded to inform me of a piece of
treachery, which had been unfolded to him at the confessional of the
Order of the Holy Cross.</p>

<p>'Who the penitent was by whom the confession was made, was, he
added, unknown to him; and even could it have been ascertained, the
rules of the church absolutely forbade a discovery. But that a female
had attended on the preceding day, who appeared to suffer much from
the horrors of an awakened conscience; and, after an endeavour on his
part to console her with promises of forgiveness on a candid avowal
of her sins, she began to disclose the cause of her remorse.</p>

<p>'She had, she said, yielded to the solicitations of a young man,
that was employed by a courtezan, whose name was Laurentina Bertola,
to administer poison to the Contessa della Croisse. That he had
addressed her as a lover, and had so far insinuated himself into her
affections and wrought upon her by his promises, that she had finally
consented. Since which time she had suffered such dreadful, such
uneasy sensations, that she was resolved to abandon the project. And
the idea of having agreed to participate in a crime of such
magnitude, returned so forcibly upon her mind, that she had hasted to
the Confessional, at once to disburthen her conscience, and to obtain
absolution.</p>

<p>'As it appeared probable to the Father that, without timely
interference, some other person would be employed to commit this
atrocious murder, he had, he continued, taken the earliest
opportunity of apprizing me of it.</p>

<p>'He then repeated his former injunctions respecting my secrecy in
what he had unfolded; since, if known, not even the necessity of the
case would excuse his disobedience to the ecclesiastical laws: the
nature of a confession never being permitted to be made public,
unless the priest to whom it is made, is called upon by the Courts of
the Inquisition to prove something which cannot otherwise be known in
cases where, for capital offences, the culprit is either punishable
according to the severe rules of that institution, or is given lip to
the civil powers, as in cases of murder, or of any other crime not
bearing the imputation of sacrilege.</p>

<p>'Surprise, horror, and resentment almost deprived me of utterance;
but when the first tumults had subsided, and the Monk had quitted the
villa, I loaded the authoress of my misfortunes with the most bitter
invectives; and having already formed a resolution never more to
enter her doors; but to make an assignation with her that I might
convince her I was not ignorant of her perfidy and ingratitude, I
repaired to an hotel.</p>

<p>'From this place I wrote a billet, in which I desired that she
would meet me in a retired spot in the evening, having something of
importance to communicate to her in private. In this I avoided
mentioning her name, and having given it to my valet, with orders for
him to convey it immediately as directed, hastened to the Conte de
Pietro's.</p>

<p>'He was from home, and finding that he was not expected till the
evening, I was for some time irresolute how to dispose of myself, not
being sufficiently tranquil to be able to see Helena, who expressed
much anxiety about my health, without adding to her distress; which
determined me, after some consideration, to return again to the
hotel, and to wait there the hour in which I had appointed to meet
Laurentina.</p>

<p>'Never shall I forget with what sensations I quitted this place,
when I went to fulfill the engagement--when I went to accuse the fair
cause of all my griefs and inquietude of premeditated guilt, and, by
one desperate exertion, to tear myself from her presence for
ever.</p>

<p>The destined spot was near the borders of the sea; it yet wanted
some minutes of the time, and seating myself upon a fragment of rock,
in a state of mind not easy to describe, I listened to the moaning
waves of the ocean with divided attention, till the murmur of voices
at a distance roused me from my place. I started, without considering
that it was unlikely that she would bring an attendant; and, before I
had time for conjecture, perceived that the voices approached nearer
to the spot, and soon afterwards distinguished these words, which
were pronounced in low and tremulous accents:</p>

<p>'His frequent visits have distressed me more than I can express;
and I must, if possible, be released from them. You know how much I
have suffered, and that he is now more than ever my aversion.</p>

<p>'The answer was nearly lost in the flutter of the breeze; but I
could easily discover it was the voice of a man.</p>

<p>'In a few moments the female advanced towards me; I did not
suppose it could be any other than Laurentina, though her features
were not perceptible, for her veil and the deepening shades of the
twilight completely concealed them from my view.</p>

<p>'Having now a fresh proof of her ingratitude, as I felt assured
that I was the subject of their discourse, my rage increased to such
a height at the idea of having been so long the dupe of an infamous
designing woman, that nothing less than the death she meditated
against the most amiable of her sex, seemed adequate to her crime.
Thus being worked into a fit of desperation by the violence of
contending passions, without reverting to the cause, I obeyed the
impulse of my feelings, and instantly drawing my stilette from my
cloak, plunged it into her heart.</p>

<p>'She fell!--but just Heaven! what was the horror of my situation
when I heard my own name pronounced, in a voice which was not
Laurentina's, but which I immediately recognized as that of my wife,
my much-injured Helena!</p>

<p>'This dreadful conviction was succeeded by a state of
insensibility, from which it was long before I awoke to a sense of my
irremediable crimes and misfortunes; when I did, I found myself in
the hotel which I usually frequented, attended by Dc Pietro and the
Marchese de Montferrat.</p>

<p>'As soon as the powers of recollection were returned, I asked
eagerly for my wife; their looks told me she was no more; and I
relapsed into a state little short of distraction.</p>

<p>'My death was hourly expected, but the measure of my woes was not
yet full, and I recovered. I then declared the fatal mistake which
had occasioned this mournful catastrophe, and found, from the
confession of a servant, who sometimes carried letters to Laurentina,
that he had received a bribe from Berlotte to deliver the next into
his hands; who having artfully altered it, to suit it better to his
purpose, inclosed it in a cover, and directing it to the Contessa
della Croisse, ordered it to be conveyed to the villa.</p>

<p>'She had expressed her surprise at this strange appointment in the
presence of her brother, the Marchese de Montferrat, who offered to
accompany her, in a carriage, within a few yards of the place, as to
walk so far in her weak state was impossible, and to wait her return
at a convenient distance.</p>

<p>'This accounted for the voices I had heard, and the subject of the
discourse; doubtless Berlotte, who had long secretly endeavoured to
insinuate himself into the affections of Helena, as the most
effectual way, attempted to convince her of my falsehood.</p>

<p>'When the violent effects of overwhelming distress had in some
degree subsided, I found, upon enquiry, that this melancholy affair
had been managed with so much secrecy by the Conte and Marchese de
Montferrat, that it was not generally understood. The rumour that
prevailed was, that the Contessa della Croisse was assassinated when
walking unattended by the Bay of Naples, and it was supposed, though
the cause could not be investigated, that it was perpetrated by one
of those inhuman wretches who are too frequently hired for that
dreadful purpose.</p>

<p>'It was long before I had courage to enquire for my children; when
I did, I learned that Vescolini, my son, was placed under the care of
one of his mother's relations in Germany; and that my daughter was
entered as a boarder in a neighbouring convent.</p>

<p>'The grief of the Conte de Pietro, who considered himself as the
primary cause of my misfortunes, though it was more calm, was but
little inferior to my own. What he before termed innocent amusement,
and attempted to palliate by the appellation of youthful levities, he
now discovered might lead to the most serious consequences, and be
productive of the most fatal effects. A short time after this event,
which had so materially affected his peace, he formed the design of
entering into a monastery of Carthusians, and soon afterwards put it
into execution.</p>

<p>'I would gladly have retired with him from the world, and have
submitted with him to the severe discipline of the Holy Fathers, and
had once adopted the resolution, but it was shaken by the entreaties
of the Conte.</p>

<p>'He bade me to consider my children, to watch over their
educations, particularly that of my son; and to guard him from those
fatal errors which had caused such severe calamity, and which
inevitably lead to lasting misery.</p>

<p>'During my illness he attended me with the greatest care and
humanity, never allowing Laurentina or any thing relative to the
subject to be mentioned in my hearing, till I was sufficiently
recovered to bear it with calmness; and then informed me that she
was, by his orders, conveyed to her former place of residence, and
that the settlement which she demanded, he had ordered to be
paid.</p>

<p>'Persisting in his resolution of abandoning the world, he began to
make every necessary preparation; and having wrested a promise from
me not to avenge myself on Berlotte or Laurentina, but to leave them
to the tortures of a guilty conscience, he hastily quitted Naples,
which was become no longer supportable, and endeavoured to take
refuge from inquietude in the gloom of a monastery.</p>

<p>'When my health was so far re-established as to enable me to leave
my room, and dismiss my physician, I began to form some plan for my
future conduct. Society was now become irksome to me; every object
reminded me of her I had lost, and I finally resolved to quit the
scene of my guilt and my sorrows, and to bury myself in a castello
situated amid the solitudes of the Apennines. This to me appeared
more eligible than even a monastic life, since here I should find
interesting companions in my children, who were all that could make
life desirable.</p>

<p>'This resolution being fixed, I acquainted the young Marchese with
my intention, whose recent rectitude of conduct had considerably
exalted him in my esteem. At first he objected to the plan with some
warmth, but finding, from a second review of the subject, the
propriety of the measure, he offered his assistance in the regulation
of my affairs.</p>

<p>'The immense debts I had contracted during my connection with
Laurentina, I found, upon enquiry, had been discharged by the Conte
de Pietro previous to his seclusion; and, also, that he had settled
the greater part of his princely fortune upon my son, which was made
over to a person, selected as a guardian in trust, till he should
arrive at years of maturity.</p>

<p>'Fearing that, by coming to the knowledge of this affair, I should
endeavour to frustrate his generous design, he had left Naples
precipitately, without even informing me, or any of his associates,
of his place of destination.</p>

<p>'Vescolini being still in Germany, I wrote to acquaint his
relation with the plan I had projected, and to request his return;
but the arguments he made use of to prevail upon me to permit him to
remain under his protection, at least for the present, were so
persuasive that I consented to his wishes.</p>

<p>'My daughter, my little Helena, whom I had not seen since the
commencement of my misfortunes, I ordered to be conveyed from her
convent; and soon afterwards, attended by a small number of
domestics, we proceeded on our journey by slow and easy stages, till
we arrived at this long forsaken mansion, which had been for many
centuries the abode of the Contes della Croisse.</p>

<p>'Here many years passed in uninterrupted retirement. My son's
visits, though not frequent, were long; the education of my daughter
employed much of my leisure; and though moments of dejection would
occasionally intrude, my griefs in some measure had yielded to the
influence of time, and I began to taste something like
tranquillity.</p>

<p>'The Marchese de Montferrat having finished his minority, took
possession of the Castello St Aubin; and some time after this event,
Vescolini being on a visit to this relation, accidentally saw a young
beauty that was under the care of Madame Laronne, a widow of quality,
who occupied a chateau in the neighbourhood of Turin, with whom he
became instantly enamoured. Her charms were also too powerful for the
Marchese to withstand, who soon became a passionate admirer.'</p>

<p>Here Madame Chamont heaved a deep sigh, and covered her face with
her handkerchief, to hide the blushes and tears this narration
excited, whilst La Roque proceeded:</p>

<p>'I knew that during my son's residence in Germany he had embraced
what is sometimes termed the Reformed Religion; and found, upon
enquiry, that the lady he addressed was a Catholic, which had
instigated her to discourage his attention, and finally to reject the
alliance. Being at too great a distance from Turin to obtain a
thorough knowledge of the affair, and having previously determined
not to influence my son in a matter of such importance to his future
happiness, I awaited the result without further enquiry.</p>

<p>'But, merciful Heaven! what was my grief and my astonishment when
I was informed that Vescolini was assassinated in the streets of
Naples by one of the Lazarone; whither he had repaired to arrange his
affairs before his intended marriage.</p>

<p>'Who was the author of this bloody deed was for some time unknown;
but being at last discovered by an inhabitant of that city, through
the confession of the wretch employed, I was informed that the
villain who had stooped to this base, cruel, and dishonourable method
of gratifying an unconquerable passion, was the Marchese de
Montferrat.'</p>

<p>Madame Chamont, being now no longer able to restrain her emotions,
sobbed aloud; whilst La Roque, who was unacquainted with the cause,
regarded her with redoubled tenderness, and hastily drying the tears
that fell in torrents from his eyes, continued his recital.</p>

<p>'Scarcely could I credit the assertion, till undeniable proofs
rendering unbelief obstinacy, I could no longer be deceived.</p>

<p>'In the desperation of the moment I resolved to see him
immediately, and publicly accuse him of these infamous proceedings;
but a fever, the consequence of extreme agitation of mind, prevented
my design. Yet though disabled from verbally declaring my resentment,
as soon as I had regained strength enough for the purpose, I wrote to
assure him that the crime he had committed was of too great magnitude
to sink into oblivion, and that it called aloud for justice.</p>

<p>'This menace had the effect I might have expected; he had
satisfied the Ecclesiastical Powers, and having of course nothing to
fear from the Civil, now vowed vengeance against his accuser. Soon
after this I received a letter from a person whose name was
concealed, but who I supposed was the Marchese's former steward,
because I knew him to be a benevolent character, informing me that my
life was in danger so long as I continued in my present abode; and
that if I was anxious to preserve my existence, I must take another
name, and remove my family from the Apennines, without further
delay.</p>

<p>'Having availed myself of this intelligence, I assumed the name
and character of a Frenchman, the better to disguise me from notice;
I hastened with my daughter into Germany, meaning to have taken
refuge in a convent.</p>

<p>'With the circumstance of our being assaulted by banditti you are
already acquainted; and it was from your bounty we were enabled to
proceed, which I hope soon to have an opportunity of doubly
repaying.'</p>

<p>Madame Chamont having assured him that she would never allow him
to repay the trifle it gave her so much pleasure to bestow, requested
that he would relate what happened to them after having quitted the
inn; and inform her, since he had so long escaped the vigilance of
those who were in pursuit of him, by what strange chance he had at
last fallen into the hands of his persecutors.</p>

<h3>Chapter 4</h3>

<pre>
To thee, yon Abbey, dark and lone.
Where ivy chains each mould'ring stone.
That nods o'er many a martyr's tomb.
May cast a formidable gloom;
Yet some there are, that free from fear.
Could wander through these cloisters drear.
And dauntless view, or seem to view.
As faintly flash the lightnings blue.
Thin shiv'ring ghosts from yawning charnels throng.
And glance, with silent sweep, the shaggy vaults along.
--MASON
</pre>

<p>'Having, madame,' continued La Roque, 'by the assistance of the
physician, whom you benevolently ordered to attend me, sufficiently
recovered from my indisposition, with the addition of a servant we
set off from the inn, and for several days performed our journey with
ease and safety; till my daughter, whose constitution was ever
delicate, began to experience some symptoms of the disorder with
which I had lingered. In the evening she became so much worse that I
began to be alarmed, and we were compelled to stop once more at a
small cottage on the road.</p>

<p>'A few days, however, so far recovered her, that we were enabled
to pursue our journey; and being anxious to retrieve the time we had
lost, we travelled with all imaginable speed till we arrived at the
edge of a forest, whose woods seemed as if destined for the abode of
banditti; when night closing in upon us, we had not courage to
proceed.</p>

<p>'We were now at too considerable a distance from the last inn to
be able to return, and no other human habitation appearing to offer
us shelter, we were for some time undetermined what course to pursue.
At length the sky became suddenly overcast with unusual darkness; the
wind rising in sudden gusts, swept along the mountains, and seemed to
portend an approaching storm.</p>

<p>'In a few minutes the thunder rolled awfully over our heads, the
forked lightnings ran dreadfully along the sky, and convinced us of
the danger of continuing exposed to the fury of the elements, or of
taking refuge in the woods.</p>

<p>'We were in this alarming situation when a sudden light from the
heavens discovered to us what seemed to be the remains of an Abbey,
which was not sufficiently in ruins to deny us an hospitable
shelter.</p>

<p>'Elated by the hopes of finding safety in this desolate abode,
which appeared to have been long forgotten by humanity, we hastened
to the spot. Having entered the gate-way, our path was obstructed by
large fragments of the broken edifice, which lay either hurled from
the summit by the fury of the winds, or scattered by the decaying
hand of Time; but our case was too desperate to remain long
irresolute, and we ventured to proceed.</p>

<p>'Having burst open the door, which was too old to make a
formidable resistance, we entered a spacious hall, the roof of which
was so exposed to the severity of the tempest as not to wear an
appearance of safety.</p>

<p>'We then, with fearful steps, hastened through a long aisle; and,
at the end of this, perceived, by a sudden flash of light that darted
through the half decayed casements, a flight of steps. This was a
discovery that afforded us much consolation, and we advanced with
alacrity, till having descended them, we found ourselves involved in
total darkness, there being no grate to admit even a partial
glimmering of light. The mournful obscurity that veiled us, the loud
blasts that howled dismally around the pile, and the thunder that
echoed amongst the rocks, filled us with terrifying apprehensions,
making us unable either to return to that part we had quitted, or to
continue our pursuit.</p>

<p>'The fortitude of Helena, which had hitherto so wonderfully
supported her, now almost forsook her; and Nicola, our affrighted
servant, joined with her in entreaties for us not to proceed.</p>

<p>'Having felt about the walls, which were dropping with the damps,
I at last perceived a door, which opened without difficulty into a
place that offered an asylum from the violence of the storm.</p>

<p>'Here we remained till it gradually abated, and at last entirely
subsided, and then ascended the steps.</p>

<p>'It was long past midnight when we left our subterranean abode,
and we waited with some degree of impatience the approach of morning.
At length the grey mists stole meekly over the summits of the
mountains; all nature seemed restored to its accustomed serenity; and
the rising sun, bursting from the glowing horizon in unusual
splendour, animated our drooping frames, and restored us to new life
and vigour.</p>

<p>'On examining our new situation, I found that a considerable part
of it was still habitable, and that there was also a sufficient
quantity of furniture for our immediate use, though much impaired by
time, and covered with dust and cobwebs.</p>

<p>'This was an asylum that promised peace and security to
unfortunate fugitives like us; and, upon mature consideration, I
determined if there was any town or village that could supply us with
food, within a few miles of the place, to remain there for the
present. This scheme I imparted to Helena, whose looks told me that
she had not so effectually quieted her fears as to relish the
proposal; but, as she always submitted her will to my judgment, she
did not seriously oppose it, and I persisted in my intention.</p>

<p>'Having cautiously provided ourselves with a quantity of
provisions before we proceeded from the post-house, we had yet
suffered nothing from the attacks of hunger; but the principal thing
remained yet to be proved, which was, whether more could be procured
at a convenient distance. It was also a matter of doubt, whether it
would be better to send Nicola on this expedition, or to go myself,
as it was possible that the blunders of a servant might betray us;
yet should it be a town of any eminence, it might be imprudent to
venture there myself.</p>

<p>'I was yet irresolute what course to pursue, when walking
thoughtfully along the gallery, I observed a door in the corner,
which I did not recollect having entered before. Curiosity induced me
to explore this part of the building, which I found upon examination
opened into an entire suite of rooms, containing nothing like
furniture except a large iron chest.</p>

<p>'This object immediately engaged my attention, and brought with it
the idea that it probably contained the booty of robbers, till having
lifted up the lid, I beheld to my astonishment the complete habit of
a monk; which consisted of a white cassock, a scapulary and hood of
the same colour, a plited cloak, a cowl, and a pair of sandals.</p>

<p>'Having examined these different articles of dress, which were all
perfect, though they seemed to have remained for some years in their
present situation, I determined, in the evening, to cloak myself in
these newly acquired vestments, and to sally forth in quest of
provisions.</p>

<p>'My first step was to take a view of the face of the country from
one of the neighbouring mountains, that I might be assured there was
some town or village within a few miles of the Abbey; as, should
there be none, it would be proper to defer the execution of my design
till the succeeding day.</p>

<p>'Having reached the summit of a rocky acclivity, which promised an
extent of prospect, I found that a great part consisted of forest
ground, intermingled with woods and lakes, but in general wild and
uncultivated; inhabited chiefly by fishermen and goatherds, whose
simple cottages just peeping beneath the deep foliage of the trees,
added much to the beauty of the landscape.</p>

<p>'The other side of the country was more fertile: several towns,
villages, and monasteries appeared within the reach of vision, which,
from contrast, received additional grandeur and beauty; but a little
hamlet that skirted a lonely precipice, which seemed to be but a few
miles from our abode, chiefly engaged my attention. It appeared to
have no connection with any other town from the distance at which it
was placed from all others, and to be distinguished for the
loneliness of its situation.</p>

<p>'Pleased with the observations I had made, which flattered me with
peace and security, I hastened to put my intentions into practice.
Having invested myself in my new habiliments, I ordered my mule to be
prepared; and, taking an osier-basket upon my arm, I threw the cowl
over my face, and proceeded towards the village.</p>

<p>'I had no difficulty either in finding the place which I sought,
or in procuring food; but I could not help observing that the
inhabitants seemed to be somewhat alarmed at my appearance, and felt
the awkwardness of my situation.</p>

<p>'There was certainly nothing very extraordinary in the figure of a
white friar; but the circumstance of being mounted on a mule, and
coming in quest of food to a village so little frequented, and so
totally uncivilized, was sufficient to awaken curiosity, and to lead
to conjecture.</p>

<p>'As soon as my business was dispatched I returned again towards
the abbey, so well satisfied with my expedition, that I resolved not
to leave it; and having again mentioned the affair to Helena, who
began to be more reconciled to the plan, she soon acceded with
pleasure to the proposal.</p>

<p>'It was not long before I discovered that the forest contained a
large quantity of wild fowl and venison, which we esteemed
delicacies; and that it also abounded in chamoix and wild goats,
whose flesh and milk were very acceptable in our retirement; and
having provided myself with a gun, we were soon amply supplied with
provision.</p>

<p>'Some years had passed in uninterrupted quiet, till an unexpected
adventure occasioned a change of situation.</p>

<p>'As we were partaking of the morning's refreshment, in an
apartment adjoining the hall, we were alarmed with the cry of hounds,
and in a few minutes, before we had time for resistance, a stag
darted into the room.</p>

<p>'This circumstance so much alarmed Helena, that she screamed and
fell lifeless into my arms; before I could recover her, two of the
hunters, who were in pursuit of the animal, entered the place in
which it had taken refuge, attended by a number of dogs, whose cries
resounding through the building, recalled Helena to life.</p>

<p>'If I was surprised at the appearance of strangers, they were no
less astonished to find the abbey was become once more the abode of
humanity; and, with many apologies for their intrusion, flew to the
assistance of Helena.</p>

<p>'The amiable solicitude they discovered for my daughter could not
be returned with indifference, and I requested them to accept of some
refreshment. They gladly acquiesced in the proposal; and, in the
pleasure that their conversation diffused, I lost for the moment the
fears of detection.</p>

<p>'I soon discovered that they were people of rank, as their
conversation was elegant, and their deportments dignified. Having
acquitted themselves with infinite grace and propriety, they asked
permission to repeat their visit; which being unreluctantly acceded
to, they departed.</p>

<p>'Though in cultivating an acquaintance of this kind, there
appeared some probability of its leading to a discovery, I felt an
irresistible inclination to gratify myself in this particular, and
was resolved to run some hazard to obtain that pleasure.</p>

<p>'In a few days they availed themselves of the permission I had so
willingly granted, and again arrived at the abbey.</p>

<p>'Helena being engaged in her household concerns, was not present;
but as the youngest of my guests enquired after the health of my
daughter, I observed a blush steal across his cheek, and a degree of
hesitation in his manner, which convinced me that the beauty of
Helena, though seen only in the languor of illness, was not beheld
with indifference.</p>

<p>'I did not know whether to be pleased or otherwise at this
discovery, till I found that he was one of the first private Noblemen
in Germany; that the gentleman who accompanied him was his guardian;
and that they were not only men of rank, but of unsullied
reputation.</p>

<p>'At present I had hinted nothing of my rank, neither had I related
any thing of my story, but only that I was unfortunate, and from some
wayward circumstances, was compelled to remain in obscurity.</p>

<p>'It was not long before I perceived that the insinuating manners
of Count Saalfield, which was the name of the stranger, had won the
affections of my daughter; and I beheld it with concern, till he
requested the honour of her hand, and engaged me to plead in his
behalf.</p>

<p>'As this was an opportunity of settling my child eligibly in life,
by uniting her to a person equal to her in rank, superior in fortune,
and every way worthy of her regard, I could not reasonably object to
it; and a time was soon fixed for their nuptials.</p>

<p>'It was not till the eve of the day appointed for the celebration
of this event, that I informed the Count to whom he was going to be
united; which intelligence seemed to excite more surprise than
pleasure; for it was the virtues of my daughter that had won his
esteem, and this could not be augmented by a knowledge of her rank
and connections.</p>

<p>'Before this marriage could be solemnized, we were necessitated to
quit the hospitable retreat which had so long afforded security.
Custom had long reconciled me to its solitudes, and I left it with
regret.</p>

<p>'The length of time which had elapsed since I retired from the
Apennines, seemed to justify the supposition that time had quieted
the fears and softened the resentment of the Marchese de Montferrat;
and I was less afraid of mixing with the world than before; though I
cautiously avoided dropping any hints which might lead to the
knowledge of my family and connections, and was still known only by
the name of La Roque.</p>

<p>'Having drawn a considerable sum out of the hands of my banker
immediately on my arrival at Augsburg, which was the residence of
Count Saalfield, I took a small seat at a convenient distance from
his castle, where I remained near two years, experiencing more
tranquillity than I ever expected to enjoy; till walking one evening
in the city, unarmed and unattended, I was attacked by two ruffians,
one of which I soon discovered to be Paoli, who having fixed a gag
upon my mouth to prevent my crying for assistance, placed me in a
vehicle ready stationed for the purpose, which conveyed me with
inconceivable rapidity to this place.</p>

<p>'As soon as I was consigned to the dungeon, I was informed that I
must die; and the only indulgence that would be allowed me, was to
chuse the means.</p>

<p>'Dreadful as was the prospect of perishing by famine, I chose this
in preference to any other death that was offered me; and was vainly
endeavouring to reconcile myself to my destiny, when the arm of
Providence graciously interposed in my defence, and sent you, Madame,
for my deliverer.'</p>

<h3>Chapter 5</h3>

<pre>
Now o'er the braid from fancy's loom.
The rich tints breath a deeper gloom.
While consecrated domes beneath.
Midst hoary shrines and caves of death.
Secluded from the eye of day.

Brooding o'er monumental cells.
Where awe diffusing silence dwells.
Save when along the lofly fane.
Devotion wakes her hallow'd strain.

</pre>

<p>La Roque, having concluded his narration, was conducted by Madame
Chamont, agreeable to the appointment of the Monk, to the end of the
eastern rampart.</p>

<p>Though she had ill succeeded in the endeavour of concealing her
emotions during this pathetic recital; yet that Madame Chamont, by
which name only she was known to him, was Julie de Rubine, that
unfortunate beauty who was the innocent cause of the death of Signor
Vescolini, was a suspicion that never occurred to the agitated mind
of La Roque. And as she prudently avoided mentioning any thing
relative to her knowledge of the Marchese, he had no reason to
suppose, even had his mind been sufficiently tranquillized to have
reflected, that her story was in the least connected with his
own.</p>

<p>Father Benedicta, who was faithful to the hour he had proposed,
was in readiness to receive them; and, the better to disguise the
object of his compassion from the gaze of curiosity, had conveyed a
habit of his order.</p>

<p>As La Roque advanced towards the Monk, with a mournful yet
dignified air, the benevolent Father sprung forward to receive him,
who, after regarding him for a moment with a look of silent
interrogation, threw back his hood upon his shoulders; whilst La
Roque, who instantly recognized a long lost friend disguised under
the habit of a Carthusian, rushed into his arms.</p>

<p>Surprise and joy for some time deprived them of utterance, till
the name of De Pietro escaping the lips of La Roque, convinced Madame
Chamont that the penitent Father, who was now become eminent for that
meekness, piety, and virtuous resignation which dignify the Christian
character, was no other than the once brilliant Italian, whose
dangerous example and seductive accomplishments had ensnared the
affectionate, the once noble Della Croisse, and had finally
annihilated his happiness.</p>

<p>When the first transports of joy, grief, and astonishment, which
were alternately expressed in the countenances of La Roque and the
Monk, were in some degree subsided, the former was arrayed in the
holy vestment of a Carthusian; and after taking an affectionate adieu
of Madame Chamont, which was accompanied with an expression of
gratitude which words could not have conveyed, he put himself under
the protection of his newly discovered friend, and repaired to the
monastery.</p>

<p>Pensive, thoughtful, and dejected, Madame Chamont continued on her
way towards the castle; musing as she went upon this singular
adventure, which now engrossed all her attention.</p>

<p>Having entered the gate leading into the outer court, she missed a
bracelet from her arm. It was one which contained the portrait of her
father, and she felt distressed and chagrined at the loss.</p>

<p>Thinking it probable that she might have dropped it in her way
from the tower, with hurried steps and a perturbed air she returned
again towards the forest.</p>

<p>After walking along the whole extent of the battlements, and
through the deep recesses of the wood which secreted the turret,
without success, she began to lose all hopes of recovering it, till
recollecting that she might have lost it when liberating La Roque
from his fetters, she descended once more into the dungeon.</p>

<p>The dim and nearly extinguished lamp that glimmered from a remote
corner of the abyss, throwing a melancholy gleam upon the dark and
mouldering walls, just served as a guide for her steps; having raised
it from the ground, she looked carefully around, but not discovering
the object of her search, she replaced the light, meaning to examine
those parts of the castle where she remembered to have been in the
morning.</p>

<p>When passing by the door of the chapel, it occurred to her that
she might have dropped it on assembling with the rest of the family
at matins; and that the surprising incidents of the day, which had so
strangely affected her mind, had prevented her from discovering her
loss before. But afraid lest Laurette should be alarmed at her long
absence, she determined first to partake of some refreshment with
her, and to endeavour at least to revive her deeply depressed
spirits, and then to explore the chapel.</p>

<p>The ill-assumed appearance of serenity with which Madame Chamont
attempted to conceal the grief La Roque's adventures had revived, and
which the recent loss of the picture had increased, appeared too
unnatural to escape the notice of Laurette, who watched every
movement of her countenance with an earnest anxiety.</p>

<p>The inexorable cruelty of the Marchese, the heart-rending sorrows
of La Roque, the murder of Vescolini, herself the primary cause,
flashed upon her mind in spite of every effort to the contrary, and
heaved her bosom with convulsive throbbings.</p>

<p>As soon as dinner was removed, she repaired to her apartment; and,
as was her custom when any new griefs or misfortunes assailed her,
bowed her knee before a small altar that was erected for the purpose,
and addressed herself to Heaven, in the hope that, with the divine
assistance, she might be enabled to triumph over the severest attacks
of human misery.</p>

<p>With spirits somewhat more composed she descended the stairs, and
proceeded, with a slow and measured step, towards the chapel.</p>

<p>It was a fine and cloudless evening, and no sound but the sighing
of the wind amongst the trees, broke the stillness that prevailed.
The sun was just quitting the hemisphere; its appearance was at once
sublime and beautiful, which induced her to pause for a moment to
survey it: now richly illuminating the western canopy with a crimson
glow, and then trembling awhile at the extremity of the horizon, and
at last sinking from the sight beyond the summits of the
mountains.</p>

<p>Having opened the door of the chapel, she fixed her eyes upon the
ground, and walked slowly through the aisles, in hopes of discovering
the bracelet; but being still unsuccessful in the pursuit, and
believing it to be irrecoverably gone, she began to reconcile herself
to the loss.</p>

<p>At the corner of the chapel was a door which she had before
frequently observed, but without any hopes of being able to ascertain
whither it led, as it was always fastened whenever she had attempted
to open it; from which circumstance it appeared probable that it
belonged to the burial vault, in which the ancient inhabitants of the
castle were entombed.</p>

<p>As she passed this door, which terminated one of the eastern
aisles, she perceived that it was not entirely closed, and curiosity
induced her to examine it.</p>

<p>Having opened it without difficulty, she descended a winding
flight of steps, and proceeding through a stone arch, whose strength
seemed to defy the arm of Time, entered a spacious building, which,
instead of being merely a receptacle for coffins, as her imagination
had suggested, appeared to have been originally used as a chapel; as
the monuments which it contained were more costly and ornamented than
those in the place which had latterly been appropriated to purposes
of devotion, and were evidently much more ancient. This surmise
seemed still more probable, when she considered that the part of the
edifice which was used as a chapel, was more modern than the rest of
the structure; and that neither the doors nor the windows were
strictly gothic, like those belonging to the other parts of the
castle. A small grated window at the farther end of the place, which
dimly admitted the light, discovered to her the last abode of man,
and spoke of the vanity of human greatness.</p>

<p>It was dreary and of vast extent; the walls, which were once
white, were now discoloured with the damps, and were mouldering fast
into decay.</p>

<p>At the upper end of the abyss were erected two statues, now
headless, which though not sufficiently entire to betray the original
design, gave additional melancholy to the scene.</p>

<p>Having lingered for some time amid the graves, whose proud arches
contained all that remained of former greatness, and whose
inscriptions were too much effaced to convey the intended lesson to
mortality; she felt herself impressed with a solemn awe, and an
emotion of fear, which she could neither account for, nor subdue,
directed towards the grated aperture.</p>

<p>The sky was clear and serene, and nothing but the light trembling
of the leaves, heard at intervals in the breeze, disturbed the
silence of the place. It was a moment sacred to meditation, and
wrapped in sublime contemplations, she beheld the deepening veil of
the twilight, which had just shaded the meek blue of the heavens,
stealing upon the surrounding scenery. As she gazed, the first pale
star trembled in the eastern sky, and the moon rising slowly above
the tops of the trees, sailed majestically through the concave; all
lower objects the height of the window had excluded, except the
foliage of the trees that waved mournfully over the place, and
replied to the moaning of the rising blast.</p>

<p>Unwilling to quit a scene so congenial to her feelings, and
anxious to examine the stately monuments that arose above the remains
of former greatness, she determined to convey a light to the place,
since it was now too dark to distinguish them, and another
opportunity of satisfying her curiosity she considered might not
speedily occur.</p>

<p>This design was no sooner formed than executed; having procured a
lamp, unobserved by any of the family she again returned to the
chapel, and descending the stairs, as before, entered the vaulted
building.</p>

<p>Having observed with the most earnest attention the stately busts
that adorned the niches, the heavy gloom of the impending monuments,
and the cross-bones, saints, crucifixes, and various other devices
suitable to the nature of the place, which were once painted on the
walls, but which time had now nearly obliterated, she felt an uneasy
sensation stealing upon her mind; and, as the partial gleam of the
lamp fell upon the ghastly countenances of the marble figures before
her, she started involuntarily from the view. Ashamed of having given
way to this moment of weakness, she seated herself upon a fallen
stone near the entrance, and, setting down the lamp by her side, cast
her eyes calmly around, as if determined to conquer the fears that
assailed her, and then taking her pencil from her pocket, wrote the
following lines:</p>

<pre>
TO MELANCHOLY

Oh! thou, the maid, in sable weeds array'd.
Who haunt'st the darksome caverns, dreary shade.
Or wrapp'd in musing deep, mid charnels pale.
Meet'st in thy sunless realms the humid gale.
That sullen murmurs, and then loudly blows.
Disturbing Silence from her deep repose;
Whilst in the mournful, dreaded midnight hour.
The hermit owl screams from yon mould'ring tower.
Or flaps his boding wing, the death room nigh.
Waking grim Horror with his funeral cry.
Hence, horrid dame, with all thy spectre train.
And let Hope's star illume this breast again;
Not with that dazzling, that delusive ray.
Which oft misleads the youthful Pilgrim's way;
But that pure beam that burns serenely bright.
And leads to visions of eternal light.
</pre>

<p>Having raised the lamp from the steps, she arose, and perceiving
that it was nearly extinguished, was retiring in haste; when casting
her eyes over this extensive and gloomy abode, to take a last survey
of the whole, she thought she distinguished, by the expiring gleam of
the lamp, a tall white figure, who having emerged slowly from behind
one of the gigantic statues at the remotest part of the building,
glided into an obscure corner.</p>

<p>The alarm that this strange appearance, whether real or imaginary,
occasioned, was so great that Madame Chamont was for some moments
unable to move; but in a short time again collecting her spirits, yet
at the same time not daring to turn her eyes to that part of the
chapel where the phantom had appeared, she gained the steps she had
descended; willing to persuade herself it was only an illusion, yet
not daring to be convinced, when she thought she heard a faint
rustling, as of garments, which was succeeded by the sound of distant
footsteps. Fear added swiftness to her flight, but before she could
reach the top of the stairs, the lamp, which had been some time
glimmering in the socket, expired and left her in total darkness.</p>

<p>Having with much difficulty reached the door leading into the
chapel, exhausted and almost sinking with terror, she paused for
breath, and was for some moments unable to proceed, however dreadful
her present situation.</p>

<p>The aspect being an eastern one, the moon shining full into the
window partly dissipated her fears, and she again stopped to listen
if all was still. In the same minute the rustling sound which she had
heard upon the stairs returned; and, without closing the door which
she had entered, with the swiftness of an arrow she darted through
the aisles, not slackening her pace till she had reached that part of
the building communicating with the chapel; then turning once more to
be assured that no one was following her, she saw, by the partial
beam of the moon, a tall stately figure moving slowly by the window
without the chapel.</p>

<p>Having reached a door which was open to admit her, she stopped at
the entrance, and following the phantom with her eyes, saw it sweep
mournfully along the corner of the edifice, and then glide into the
deep recesses of the wood.</p>

<p>This strange occurrence so much alarmed Madame Chamont, that it
was some time before she could recompose her spirits; and being too
much fatigued to endure conversation, she excused herself to
Laurette, whose looks anxiously enquired the cause of these emotions,
and retired to her bed. But her mind was not sufficiently
tranquillized to admit of rest; the strange appearance she had seen,
continually occurred to her memory, and when she sunk into
forgetfulness, her dreams were confused, wild, and horrible.
Sometimes the image of Vescolini would present itself to her fancy,
covered with blood, and gasping in the agonies of death; at others,
the ill-fated La Roque loaded with chains, weak, pale, and emaciated,
torn from his tenderest connections, and consigned to a dungeon as to
his grave.</p>

<p>These terrible imaginations and dreadful realities worked too
powerfully upon her mind not to occasion indisposition, and she awoke
in the morning weak and unrefreshed. Her griefs were not of a nature
to be softened by friendly participation; for prudence forbidding her
to reveal them, condemned her to suffer in silence.</p>

<p>Laurette discovering that some hidden sorrow was preying upon the
spirits of her revered protectress, exerted every effort she was
mistress of to remove it; these gentle attentions were usually
rewarded with a smile, but it was a smile that expressed more of
melancholy than of pleasure, and which was frequently followed with a
tear.</p>

<p>Near a week had passed since La Roque's departure from the tower,
before Father Benedicta again visited the castle. By him Madame
Chamont was informed, that he had quitted the monastery on the
preceding day, and was continuing his journey towards Augsburg, being
anxious to relieve his daughter from that state of suspense and
apprehension to which his absence had reduced her.</p>

<p>When the holy Benedicta mentioned the name of his friend, there
was a swell in his language which spoke the tenderest affection, and
the deep and heartfelt sighs that accompanied the subject whenever he
was mentioned, convinced her of the sincerity of his repentance; and
in the penitent Benedicta she forgot the once dissipated De
Pietro.</p>

<h3>Chapter 6</h3>

<pre>
Oh! How this spring of love resembleth
Th' uncertain glory of an April day.
Which now shews all the beauty of the sun.
And by and by a cloud takes all away.
--SHAKESPEARE
</pre>

<p>Some months had elapsed since La Roque's departure from the tower,
before Madame Chamont was sufficiently recovered from the shock her
feelings had sustained, to be enabled to partake of those simple and
elegant amusements, which were formerly so conducive to her
happiness; till the unexpected arrival of Enrico, who declined
mentioning any thing of his intended visit, that joy might be
augmented by surprise, restored her once more to felicity.</p>

<p>The rapturous sensations which this meeting occasioned, must be
left to the imagination of those who are blessed with sensibility
exquisite as their's, and are capable of experiencing those fine,
those delicate emotions which are the offspring of a genuine
affection.</p>

<p>After an absence of near two years from the Castle, the person of
Enrico was considerably improved. He had nearly entered his
eighteenth year, was tall and finely proportioned; his eyes were full
of fire, yet occasionally tender; and his countenance, which was
frank, open, and manly, being animated with the most lively
expression, betrayed every movement of his soul.</p>

<p>But the form of Laurette was more visibly improved than even that
of Enrico. Being some years younger, she had just attained the age
when the playful simplicity of childhood is exchanged for the more
fascinating charms of the lovely girl. The peculiar elegance of her
mind, which her amiable monitress had refined and cultivated with
unceasing attention, was finely portrayed in her features, which were
soft, pensive, and interesting; and though not exactly answering to
the description of a perfect beauty, possessed a something which
beauty alone could not have bestowed.</p>

<p>The presence of the young Chevalier diffused universal gladness
throughout the mansion. The domestics, who had conceived for him an
early regard, were anxious to convince him of their esteem, by the
most marked and assiduous attentions, which he never failed to repay
with that insinuating gentleness of demeanor which is frequently more
eloquent than words.</p>

<p>Doroth&eacute;e, who loved him with a degree of tenderness but
little inferior to that of a parent, could not restrain the tears
which surprise and transport had excited on his arrival; and would
frequently pause longer than her duty required, to hear him enumerate
the difficulties he had encountered, the hardships he had undergone,
and the dangers to which he had been exposed.</p>

<p>But the pleasures which his profession afforded was a topic still
more productive of delight; and Madame Chamont, who listened to him
with undivided attention, beheld with satisfaction, that the mind of
her son was too strong to suffer either from the intoxication of
success, or the depression of disappointment.</p>

<p>When the subject was of a kind to awaken pity, Enrico marked with
affectionate concern the intelligent looks of Laurette. He saw the
blush overspread her cheek, then fade, and as suddenly disappear, as
conversation unfolded the powers and energies of her soul. The lifted
eye directed upwards in the language of sympathy, and the tear that
trembled beneath its lid, which gave new softness, expression, and
character to her appearance, he beheld with a degree of admiration
which he found it impossible to conceal.</p>

<p>As the only amusements which this sequestered situation afforded
were of the most simple kind, they were usually enjoyed in the open
air; under the thick shade of an oak or a plane tree, they would
frequently pass many hours listening to the harmony of the birds,
and, in the calm serenity of the evening, would extend their rambles
along the most wild and unfrequented paths, till the bat flitted
silently by them, and the cottage lights seen at intervals between
the dark foliage of the trees, reminded them of the approach of
night; whilst the music of the nightingale, immersed in the deep
gloom of the woods, broke softly upon the stillness of the hour.</p>

<p>In these little excursions Laurette would sometimes seat herself
upon a stile or a fragment of rock, and taking her lute, which she
knew how to touch with exquisite pathos, would play some charming air
which she accompanied with her voice, till the soul of Enrico was
lost in an extasy of delight, from which he was reluctantly
awakened.</p>

<p>But their favourite walk was through a thick grove of beeches and
laburnums, that led to a little sequestered dell; there the distant
murmur of a waterfall gave a soothing tranquillity to the scene,
whose monotony was only occasionally interrupted by the lively tones
of the oboe, or the pipe of the shepherd, who having led his flock
from their pastures, had retired from the immediate scene of his
labours and his cares, and placing himself at the root of an elm or
an acacia, beguiled the moments with a song.</p>

<p>Such were the innocent delights of the rural inhabitants of this
lonely retreat; to Enrico they had the additional advantage of
novelty; but when he recollected that he must soon relinquish them,
must leave Laurette, his revered parent, all that was dear to him,
perhaps for ever, a sigh would agitate his breast, and an involuntary
tear would oftentimes start into his eye.</p>

<p>Madame Chamont was not insensible to these emotions, nor
unsuspicious of the cause; she observed, with tender anxiety, the
looks of her son when the subject of his departure was touched upon,
and saw the colour fade from the cheek of Laurette as the necessity
of it was mentioned, with evident concern. The suspicion that she was
the daughter of the Marchese de Montferrat, and consequently nearly
allied to Enrico, was a sufficient cause for distress; and as every
circumstance she had collected seemed to confirm the justice of the
supposition, the evidence, upon the whole, nearly amounted to
conviction.</p>

<p>This growing tenderness, if not opposed, might ripen, she
considered, into a deep and lasting attachment; yet to give a hint of
disapprobation, without adding a reason sufficient to justify such a
proceeding, would seem arbitrary and capricious, and from its not
being conducted with an appearance of openness, might probably fail
in the design.</p>

<p>To a young and susceptible mind like that of Enrico, the beauty
and accomplishments of Laurette could not be indifferent; and when he
compared her with many of her sex whom he had accidentally seen on
his travels, whose manners contrasted with hers were coarse or
unnatural; her superiority was too evident not to attract his
admiration, and that admiration was of too exalted and refined a
nature not to terminate in a softer passion.</p>

<p>Yet this increasing affection, though it might have been easily
discovered by a common observer, was for some time concealed from the
objects by whom it was mutually inspired. They felt they were uneasy
in each other's absence without suspecting the cause, and looked
forwards to the moment of departure with painful inquietude.</p>

<p>The subject was too unpleasant to be unnecessarily introduced, yet
time flew rapidly away, and after a month spent in this enviable
retreat, he was in hourly expectation of an order from his Colonel to
summon him to join his regiment. This, notwithstanding his military
ardour, his thirst for honour and immortal glory, he now dreaded as
the approach of death; since it would tear him from society which was
become necessary to his happiness, from quiet, innocence, and rural
life.</p>

<p>Yet constrained by situation to submit, without murmuring, to his
destiny, he combated as much as possible the sensibility that
assailed him, endeavouring to mitigate what he could not subdue, the
poignancy of uneasy reflections, by the cold, and frequently
ineffectual, dictates of reason.</p>

<p>Fearing lest his passion for retirement, which was endeared to him
by objects too tenderly beloved, should extinguish every vigorous,
active, and noble principle of his mind, he frequently retired
voluntarily from the presence of Laurette; and, in the vain attempt
of reconciling himself to this approaching separation, would walk
alone upon the borders of the wood; hoping, by this method of
communication with himself, that he might be enabled to recall the
natural fortitude of his mind, which had yielded without reflection
to the impulse of a premature attachment.</p>

<p>Yet though he wished so far to conquer his feelings as not to sink
into effeminacy, and to disgrace the soldier, he did not wish to be
insensible to the virtues and graces of Laurette, which, on a nearer
examination of his heart, he discovered to be the indissoluble spell
that had bound his affections to the place.</p>

<p>Was it possible that he could have beheld her perfections with
indifference, he would have sunk in his own estimation; he did not
wish not to love her; but he wished to love her with that moderation
which would not interfere with the performance of his duty; and
should he be so fortunate as to conciliate her regard, to look
forward to her as the invaluable reward of his perseverance and
virtue.</p>

<p>Unconscious of what was passing in the mind of Enrico, Laurette,
in these temporary absences, sometimes appeared pensive and
dispirited; she observed after his return from the wood, which was
always his walk when alone, an air of thoughtfulness in his
deportment, and oftentimes of dejection, that awakened solicitude,
and led to anxious enquiry.</p>

<p>Madame Chamont, who was a silent, but not an unconcerned spectator
of what was passing, was often absorbed in musing and abstraction,
whilst yet in their presence; but this being natural to her
disposition was disregarded, as the suspicion that their attachment
was the cause, never occurred to the minds of the lovers.</p>

<p>But these little absences arising from melancholy reflection,
though frequent, were not lasting; a lively air, a ramble in the
forest, or the artless tale of a cottage girl, delivered with that
genuine simplicity of expression which will continue to interest
whilst nature has a charm, was sufficient to restore them to
animation, and even to gaiety.</p>

<p>How rapturous were the sensations of Enrico when sometimes alone
with Laurette, he would linger amid the lonely recesses of the
mountains, and would point out to her the peculiar beauties of the
landscape; beauties which she had before observed, but never with
such charming sensations. How soon did the sun appear to sink upon
the bosom of the waters, and the night shades to fall upon the
surrounding objects. And how lovely did she seem to him amid scenes
so picturesque; how delicate, how undescribable were the emotions her
beauty and innocence inspired.</p>

<p>Hurried away by a sanguine and warm imagination, he would
sometimes indulge hopes which a more experienced mind would have
rejected as fallacious; and at other times a causeless anxiety would
prey upon his spirits, and suspend every faculty of his soul.</p>

<p>After a six weeks' residence in the castle, the dreaded order,
which had been daily expected, arrived, and he now perceived, more
than ever, the necessity of conquering those feelings which, though
in themselves amiable, and the object that excited them every way
worthy, might, considering his situation, have a dangerous
tendency.</p>

<p>Induced by the most honourable motive to preserve a perpetual
silence upon the subject, he had never yet verbally hinted to
Laurette his prepossession in her favour, and he resolutely
determined not to make an open declaration of his passion, either to
her or to his mother, but to strive to render himself agreeable to
both, by those ardent and vigorous exertions in his military
capacity, which might eventually lead to independence and to
happiness.</p>

<p>Though to subdue the sentiment of affection, which occasioned this
intellectual weakness, was impracticable, he succeeded in the
endeavour of concealing it; and was congratulating himself on the
success attending it till the evening preceding his departure, when
some of those mournful presages, which too frequently assail minds of
extreme sensibility, threw him somewhat off his guard.</p>

<p>He was then sitting with Laurette in an oriel window, commanding
an extensive view, in the serene hour of moonlight; when the idea
presented itself that he might probably never more be placed in so
enviable a situation, since a few hours must inevitably separate him
from his dearest connections, and that death, or some wayward
circumstances, might prevent the fruition of those fondly indulged
hopes which had hitherto supported him.</p>

<p>Agitated by this surmise, he seized the hand of Laurette, and
pressing it to his lips with an impassioned exclamation, an immediate
disclosure of his sentiments would have succeeded, had not the
retiring dissidence of her manners checked the momentary impulse, and
given him up to the guidance of discretion.</p>

<p>When the time of departure arrived, which was early on the
following morning, a severe trial awaited him. The uneasiness
expressed in his looks was understood by his mother, who mingled
tears with embraces; whilst Laurette, whose feelings were not less
awakened or acute, was condemned by the laws of delicacy, which are
sometimes severe and arbitrary, to conceal them under an appearance
of tranquillity.</p>

<p>Having torn himself from a scene too tender for his present frame
of mind, with a breast throbbing with emotion, he waved his hand to
Madame Chamont and Laurette, whose eyes anxiously followed him
through the portal, and departed from the castle.</p>

<p>That tender and interesting kind of dejection that steals upon the
spirits after the departure of a beloved friend, we often fondly
indulge; it is one of those amiable propensities that the heart
cherishes and approves. When under the dominion of this pleasing
melancholy, we love to retire from observation, to recollect every
parting expression, and to feed upon the remembrance of the past;
every affecting incident connected with those we have lost, every
interesting situation in which we have seen them, recurs to the
memory, and excites moving and pensive reflections.</p>

<p>It was this affectionate impulse that led Madame Chamont beneath
the spreading branches of an oak, where, in the society of Enrico,
she had often sat secluded from the influence of a mid-day sun; and
where they had sometimes partaken of a simple repast.</p>

<p>It was this stealing tenderness that soothes whilst it wounds,
that directed Laurette to the side of a foaming rivulet, which fell
in a natural cascade from a rocky acclivity, to whose murmurs they
had often listened with the most pleasurable emotions when they
visited the lonely dell.</p>

<p>But here she found it impossible to remain without enduring the
most poignant regret. Tears, which she was unable to restrain, fell
fast upon her cheek, and she was compelled to retire from the spot
she had chosen, that she might exchange it for one less mournful and
sequestered.</p>

<p>Enrico had not been gone many days from the castle before the
arrival of Paoli was announced. So unpleasant a visitor was not
considered as an acquisition to the happiness of its inhabitants,
which occasioned him to be received by all, though not with
incivility, yet with coldness. His presence was always a restraint
upon the conduct of Madame Chamont, but at this time fear also was
mingled with aversion.</p>

<p>The circumstance of La Roque's delivery, though she reflected upon
it with satisfaction and self-complacency, was not unattended with
certain presages, which neither reason nor fortitude could subdue;
that he would repair to the turret, and also to the dungeon, in the
expectation of finding the body of his prisoner, she considered as
highly probable; that he would be both surprised and irritated at the
disappointment, and would take some pains to discover the author of
it, was equally certain; but that the suspicion should fail upon her,
or any of the family, she was willing to hope was unlikely.</p>

<h3>Chapter 7</h3>

<pre>
The midnight clock has told and hark! the bell
Of Death beats slow; heard ye the note profound?
It pauses now, and now with rising knell.
Flings to the hollow gale its sullen sound.
--MASON
</pre>

<p>The strange variety of events that had recently occupied the
thoughts of Madame Chamont, prevented her from paying her respects to
the Lady Abbess so frequently as had been her custom; who beginning
to feel uneasy at her absence, sent a message by Father Benedicta to
invite her to the convent. Not more anxious to obtain that
consolation which the conversation of the Superior afforded, than to
be released from the society of the steward, whose haughtiness of
deportment rather increased than diminished, she readily acquiesced;
and Laurette, who was usually the companion of her walks, was allowed
to accompany her on her visit.</p>

<p>The features of the venerable Abbess were animated with a smile as
she came forward to receive them, but an expression of deep dejection
soon afterwards succeeded.</p>

<p>Believing that she had met with some new cause of distress, Madame
Chamont would have requested permission to have shared it with her;
but fearful of intruding upon the sacredness of her sorrow, she
remained silent with her eyes fixed upon the ground, till the
Superior, in a voice which she could scarcely command, informed her
that the sister Cecilia was so ill, that all hopes, founded on human
assistance, were likely to prove inefficacious. 'But as her life,'
resumed the Abbess, 'has displayed an example of the most uniform
piety, penitence, and submission; so her serenity at the approach of
death indicates that the hope of acceptance she has cherished is not
founded on error. If you will attend me to her cell,' continued the
Superior, 'you will witness the most perfect tranquillity in the
midst of exquisite suffering.'</p>

<p>Madame Chamont, who had every reason to believe that the beautiful
vestal had of late carefully avoided meeting with her, though she
could not easily account for it, would have excused herself from
visiting her cell; observing, that the presence of a stranger, in the
last moments of existence, might be considered as an intrusion. But
every objection that she offered was instantly removed by the Abbess,
who seemed so anxiously to desire her attendance, that she was
compelled to yield to the proposition. As they were proceeding along
the cloisters on their way to the chamber, they were met by a nun,
who advancing hastily towards the Superior, informed her that for the
last two hours the sister Cecilia had been rapidly declining; and, as
the moment of her departure was supposed to be near, her Confessor
was in waiting to perform the usual ceremony for the repose of her
soul.</p>

<p>The Abbess replied only with a sigh, and a look directed
eloquently towards heaven, and then taking the hand of Madame
Chamont, with the fond affection of a mother, led her to a small door
between two columns which opened into the apartment.</p>

<p>Here on a mattress, at the end of the room, lay sister Cecilia.
She was attended by two nuns, who were seated on stools by her side,
and who, by the silent movement of their lips, appeared to be engaged
in devotion.</p>

<p>Beneath a dim gothic casement on the eastern side of the
apartment, stood Father Benedicta. He held a missal in his hand, and
seemed to be so entirely abstracted from worldly affairs as not to
observe their entrance.</p>

<p>The fair sufferer, who was apparently too near death to feel any
acute pain, cast a glance of filial tenderness upon the Abbess, and
another, not less affectionate, towards Madame Chamont. Her fine blue
eyes were not so radiant as before her illness, but in other respects
she was but little altered; her features still retained the same
interesting expression, and though overspread with that livid hue,
which indicates approaching dissolution, were still lovely.</p>

<p>'Daughter,' said the Superior, seating herself on the bed by her
side, 'I have brought Madame Chamont to see you; I thought a visit
from her would not be unpleasant.'</p>

<p>The nun smiled serenely, and then, with a motion of her hand,
invited her to come forwards; whilst the Abbess walked towards the
window where the Confessor was stationed.</p>

<p>'Perhaps I have been unkind to you,' cried sister Cecilia,
addressing herself to Madame Chamont, in low and mournful accents;
'you have discovered a tender interest in my misfortunes, and I have
hitherto denied you my confidence. You wrote to ask me if I ever had
a daughter, or had cause to lament the loss of one? The answer I
returned was as true as it was concise--I never had one. But had I
not previously taken a vow never to disclose any incident of my past
life to any other than my Confessor, the amiable sympathy you
discovered for my irremediable calamities, would have induced me to
reveal them; but this sacred vow, which has long bound me to secrecy,
reaches but to the confines of the grave. Father Benedicta is
acquainted with my story, and has my permission to give you any
information you may desire upon this subject immediately on my
decease.'</p>

<p>Madame Chamont thanked the nun gratefully for her attention, who
being much exhausted by this slight exertion, uttered a benediction,
and then closing her eyes, fell into a gentle doze.</p>

<p>As soon as she awaked from this short slumber, the sisterhood were
summoned, by the ringing of a bell, to attend the mass.</p>

<p>The Monk was now arrayed in his priestly robes, and the ceremony
was performed with a degree of solemnity that was at once awful and
impressive.</p>

<p>Madame Chamont attended to these pious rites with a devout
enthusiasm peculiar to her character; they reminded her of the last
moments of her revered mother, and sighs, which she was unable to
subdue, frequently convulsed her bosom.</p>

<p>As soon as these holy acts of devotion were concluded, the Lady
Abbess and the rest of the assembly, except the nuns whose business
it was to attend upon the dying, arose to depart. But the former
being recalled by the Monk, at the request of the sister Cecilia,
remained in the apartment, whilst Madame Chamont retired in
procession with the rest of the nuns.</p>

<p>Had she not been withheld by earthly connections, how willingly
would Madame Chamont have committed herself to this holy retirement.
The placid countenances of the sisters, the gentleness, the humility
of their deportments, the air of solemnity that dignified their
movements, were so grateful to her feelings, that she was tempted to
believe, from a transient review of the subject, that peace was only
to be enjoyed in the solitude of a cloister.</p>

<p>The deepening shades of the evening now convinced her of the
necessity of quitting the convent, and calling for Laurette, who had
remained below in the Abbess's parlour, they returned to the
castle.</p>

<p>The next day the Father Benedicta was commissioned by the
Superior, to inform Madame Chamont of the death of sister Cecilia,
which event had taken place a few hours after her departure; and also
to request, if her spirits were equal to the task, that she would
attend the funeral of the nun, which was fixed for the evening of the
ensuing day.</p>

<p>Seduced by that pleasing melancholy which scenes of solemnity
inspire, she assented to the proposal; and calling the Monk into a
saloon which was unoccupied, she besought him to acquaint her with
some circumstances relative to the departed sister, particularly that
of her name and former residence.</p>

<p>'Her name,' replied the Father, 'which I am now permitted to
disclose, is Di Capigna.'</p>

<p>Madame Chamont started; a blush passed suddenly across her cheek,
but instantly disappeared, leaving it more wan than before.</p>

<p>'Her place of residence,' resumed the Father, 'before the
commencement of her misfortunes, was Naples.' Madame Chamont's
countenance became still paler; whilst, without appearing to observe
her emotions, the Monk continued.</p>

<p>'She formed an attachment in early youth, an attachment not more
unfortunate than dangerous. Her lover was an Italian Noble of high
rank and immense possessions, but of libertine unstable principles;
he had been long initiated in all the arts of intrigue; and being
entirely divested of that energy of soul which resists evil
inclinations, became a slave to every passion that tyrannizes in the
heart of man. He seduced her affections under the appearance of
sincerity, and finally prevailed upon her to relinquish the
protection of her only surviving parent, and to become an inmate of
his mansion.</p>

<p>'The father of the misguided Signora was no sooner informed of his
daughter's dishonour, than it began to have an alarming effect upon
his constitution: he raved incessantly of his child, though he
persisted in refusing to see her; and soon afterwards fell a victim
to his own and his daughter's calamities.</p>

<p>'The Signora was no sooner acquainted with his death, which she
was conscious of having hastened, than she fled from her lover, and
suddenly became the most austere of penitents. She undertook a
pilgrimage to the Chapel of Loretto, and afterwards consigned her
youth, beauty, and almost matchless accomplishments to the shades of
a cloister.</p>

<p>'It is now upwards of fourteen years,' resumed the Father, 'since
she entered into the convent; and whatever irregularities may have
marked her former conduct, her penitence, her tears, and her
sufferings have been sufficient to expiate them.--Yes, her late
exemplary life,' continued the Monk, after a momentary pause,
'whatever errors she may have committed previous to her retirement,
we may venture to hope, with humility, will ensure her eternal
felicity.'</p>

<p>The conversation was here interrupted by the presence of Laurette,
who advancing towards the Father with an easy and sprightly air, drew
her chair near his, and seated herself by his side.</p>

<p>The holy Benedicta, who loved her with parental affection, gazed
placidly upon her beautiful face, and then taking her hand,
continued--'The death of the sister Cecilia presents to all,
particularly to the young and the sanguine, an awfully important
lesson; let us consider it, my daughters, and endeavour to profit by
it--She was once rich, lovely, and celebrated; but, by one act of
unrestrained error, became miserable, despised, and abject. A whole
life of austerity was scarcely sufficient to purify her contaminated
soul, and to prepare it for that unknown change that awaits us all.
The sting of conscience is, perhaps, the most acute pang which the
regenerated mind can endure. It is a wound we carry unhealed to the
grave; and at the hour of separation, when the parting spirit
requires every aid that conscious integrity can bestow, is, unless
softened by the interposition of divine grace, more dreadfully
afflictive than at any other period of existence.'</p>

<p>Madame Chamont perceiving that the latter part of this discourse
was delivered in a faltering voice, raised her tearful eyes from the
ground, on which they had long been riveted, and fixing them upon the
countenance of the Father, saw it was distorted by emotion: he seemed
to feel acutely the terrible sensation he had been describing, and
finding himself observed, embarrassment deprived him of the power of
proceeding.</p>

<p>But the pang of remorse was not of long continuance; hope
reanimated his breast, and the same placid expression which his
features usually wore, returned with more affecting interest.</p>

<p>He was unconscious of Madame Chamont's being informed of his
story, though he knew that she had released his friend from
captivity, and consequently that she had made herself acquainted with
some of the most remarkable events of La Roque's past life. Perhaps
there was nothing that the Father so ardently desired as to conceal
from the knowledge of the world the dissipated follies of his youth,
though the cause of this reluctance to reveal them could not be
easily ascertained; as of all men he was the most meek, humble, and
unassuming, the least apprehensive of censure, and by no means
solicitous to secure the applause of the multitude. To his God only,
he was accountable for his actions, and not to frail humanity. In his
service he preserved an uniform austerity of life, suffering all the
mortifications and bodily inflictions which the severity of his order
required. By this method he endeavoured to erase from his mind the
melancholy remembrance of the past; or, if it could not be forgotten,
at least to blunt the poignancy of his feelings with the comforts of
religion, attended by the elevated, and not presumptive hope, that
the atonement was accepted.</p>

<p>When the Monk had regained his composure, he continued the subject
till the chime of the vesper-bell, which was heard faintly on the
wind, warned him of the hour of prayer, and precipitated his
departure from the castle.</p>

<p>On the succeeding day Madame Chamont prepared, at the request of
her friend, to attend the funeral of the sister Cecilia; and putting
on a long black robe, with a veil of the same colour, but little
different either in form or texture to those worn by the order of
Penitents, she took her missal, her crucifix, and her rosary, and
repaired to the convent.</p>

<p>She was met at the gate by a friar, who usually attended for the
purpose of opening it, and on enquiry for the Abbess, was directed to
the Refectoire, where the nuns, who had taken the eternal veil, were
already assembled.</p>

<p>They all arose on her entrance, and courteously offered her a seat
by the fire, which, as the evening was cold and damp, she consented
to accept. When the first salutations were over, a mournful silence
ensued, which was interrupted at intervals by deep and heartfelt
sighs, proceeding from the farther end of the room.</p>

<p>Curiosity induced Madame Chamont to turn; it was Father Benedicta,
who had taken a place in a remote corner, to conceal what he mistook
for weakness, but what was really the effect of his humanity.</p>

<p>The hollow tolling of the bell, and the entrance of four lay
brothers, who passed hastily through the room, and departed at a
contrary door, announced the moment was at hand in which the remains
of the beautiful penitent was to be consigned to its last cold and
cheerless abode.</p>

<p>As soon as these religious men had passed through the Refectoire,
the Superior gave orders for the assembly to remove to the edge of
the chapel-yard, to wait there till the body was disposed in the
order in which it was to be conveyed, and to be in readiness to
attend it from thence to the place of destination.</p>

<p>Having arrived within the gate of the burial-ground, they stopped,
and in a few minutes beheld the melancholy procession stealing
solemnly towards the spot. The coffin was supported by the four lay
brothers from the Carthusian Monastery, who were commissioned to
attend for the purpose; a friar walked before, holding in one hand a
crucifix of ebony, and in the other a small image of the Virgin; six
of the same order moved slowly behind bearing torches, followed by
the novices and boarders of the convent; these advanced at a short
disttance, bearing baskets of myrtle, laurel, and other evergreens,
to decorate the new-made grave of their departed sister.</p>

<p>The procession was now joined by the Lady Abbess, Madame Chamont,
and the train of nuns, who proceeded between the corpse and the
following monks, till they reached the door of the chapel; here they
were met by Father Benedicta, who being the sister Cecilia's
Confessor, was requested to officiate at the last mournful office,
that of interment.</p>

<p>Having arrived at the interior of the edifice, the coffin was
deposited in a recess scooped out in the wall for similar occasions,
beneath the image of a Magdalen in the act of penitence. The chapel
was dimly lighted, except near the altar, which was splendidly
adorned with a profusion of valuable paintings and consecrated
tapers. At some distance from this stood the venerable Father: a
gleam of light, which fell upon his face, marked the shadowy lines of
sorrow softened by resignation; the hood which he usually wore being
thrown back upon his shoulders, as soon as the service was begun, the
whole of his countenance was visible and impressive.</p>

<p>At first his voice was low and faltering but as he resumed the
discourse, his words regained their accustomed solemnity of
expression, his features no longer retained the cloud of dejection
but assumed the vivid glow of hope and confidence.</p>

<p>An exhortation to survivors succeeded, delivered with all the
moving graces of eloquence: every auditor listened with reverence as
the holy Father proceeded, and felt impressed with the spirit and
fire of devotion as he continued to expatiate upon the beauty of
holiness, and the misery inseparable from vice and immorality.</p>

<p>As soon as this was concluded, the nuns, who had seated themselves
in the aisles during the ceremony, attended by the monks and the rest
of the congregation, advanced towards the burial-ground, whither the
deceased was borne, in the same order as before, till they reached
the edge of the grave. As they passed along the chapel on their way
towards the place, strains, almost divine, echoed through the
cloisters, which being aided by the voices of the choir, had a
charmingly sublime effect, tending to preclude as unholy every
earthly idea, and to wrap the mind in deep religious musings.</p>

<p>When the procession arrived at the consecrated spot, the tones of
the organ were still heard, and the voices that accompanied it, being
softened by distance, sounded to the ear of enthusiasm like the
chaunt of angels.</p>

<p>Madame Chamont listened with undescribable sensations till the
notes died into silence, and the Father made a sign for the coffin to
be committed to the earth. A short prayer was then delivered with
much fervency and emphasis, which was often interrupted by the sobs
of the audience, who loved the sister Cecilia with the most refined
affection and tenderness. Madame Chamont's tears flowed fast; and as
she returned towards the convent, her feelings became so acute that
she was compelled to take the arm of a nun for support.</p>

<p>As it was nearly dark when the funeral rites were concluded, the
Abbess used many arguments to prevail upon her friend to continue
with her during the night; but unwilling to leave her young charge,
who she considered might be uneasy at her absence, declined the
proposal; and, attended by one of the superior domestics of the
convent, walked thoughtfully towards the castle.</p>

<p>Deeply impressed by the awful scene she had witnessed, Madame
Chamont retired early to her room, and feeling little inclination to
sleep, placed herself in a large antique chair which was fixed at the
side of her bed, and taking her pen, her customary resource in the
moments of dejection, she endeavoured to beguile the solitary hours
by inscribing the following lines to the memory of the unfortunate
Signora Di Capigna:</p>

<pre>
DIRGE

Meek Flower, untimely doom'd to fade.
Ere half thy op'ning sweets were known.
To pine in drear Misfortune's shade.
Alike forgotten and unknown.
Tho' rob'd in more than mortal charms.
To quit thy peerless earthly frame.
o waste thy sweets in Death's cold arms.
That slowly, but relentless came.
Ah! what avails the vermeil dye.
The charm that Beauty's step attends.
The ruby lips, the halcyon eye.
And ev'ry grace that Nature lends;
Since all must meet the direful blow:
Nor could thy powers, Oh! Genius, save;
For thee the tear shall ever flow.
To grace thy silent, early grave.
And there no thistle rude shall grow.
No weedy flower of baleful hues;
But there the mournful poppy blow.
And bathe thy turf with opiate dews.
No spectre wan shall haunt the way.
Nor screaming owl with boding cry;
But Cynthia's bird, of sweetest lay.
Shall sooth the zephyr's evening sigh.
</pre>

<p>When Madame Chamont had finished this little plaintive memorial,
she began to ruminate upon the subject of Father Benedicta's
discourse on the evening preceding the funeral. As the beautiful nun
was indisputably proved to be the Signora Di Capigna, agreeable to
her former supposition; from her own declaration she was assuredly
not the mother of Laurette, as she had verbally confessed, within a
few hours of her death, that she never had a daughter; which was
perfectly consistent with the assertion which her letter contained
previous to this event. This certainly communicated a slight gleam of
satisfaction to her mind; for if Laurette was not the daughter of
this unfortunate nun, it appeared highly probable that she was the
orphan child of some deceased friend of the Marchese's, whom pity had
induced him to patronize; and possibly, should time and reflection
fix the attachment between her and Enrico upon a still firmer basis,
no adverse circumstances might prevent their union.</p>

<h3>Chapter 8</h3>

<pre>
Oh! Conspiracy!
Sham'st thou to shew thy dang'rous brow by night.
When evils are most free? Oh! then by day
Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
To mask thy monstrous visage?
--SHAKESPEARE
</pre>

<p>Paoli had not been long resident in the castle before Madame
Chamont was convinced, that the uneasy apprehensions she had
experienced previous to his arrival, were not groundless; and that
the noble part she had taken in liberating the unfortunate from the
grasp of oppression, an unforeseen accident had early discovered.</p>

<p>The sullen reserve which had hitherto marked the behaviour of the
steward, and was peculiar to his character, was soon after his
arrival augmented; and he frequently fixed his eyes upon Madame
Chamont, when he accidentally and unavoidably met her, with a look
conveying a shrewd and malicious expression. This she perceived with
some appearance of emotion; whilst her tormentor, who seemed to
derive pleasure from her embarrassment, endeavoured, as much as
possible, to increase that distress he was conscious of having
excited, with a repetition of his former conduct.</p>

<p>That he had already visited the dungeon, and that his suspicions
were directed to her, nearly amounted to conviction; but why he
should suspect her, as the immediate cause of La Roque's escape from
captivity, without some recent information which might lead to the
conjecture, was at once strange and unaccountable. But from this
state of surmise and perplexity she was soon afterwards relieved, by
the certainty that a full discovery was the consequence of a trifling
inadvertency; which convinced her that she had every thing to fear
from the rage of her enemies, and that on her part the most strenuous
exertions of heroic fortitude were necessary.</p>

<p>The bracelet which she had dropped from her arm, whose loss she
lamented because adorned by the portrait of her father, was found by
Paoli amid the files and other instruments which she had employed in
the accomplishment of her design, in the dungeon of the turret.</p>

<p>This he secured and presented to her when she was amusing herself
in the selection of some of the finest flowers which the gardens
produced, to ornament the windows of the oriel; informing her from
whence he had taken it, and demanding, in an imperious and
authoritative tone, for what purpose she had visited the tower.</p>

<p>Being unprepared for an answer, Madame Chamont did not immediately
reply; nor could the conscious rectitude of her conduct, which had
hitherto dignified her misfortunes, prevent her from feeling some
portion of that acute pain, which is inseparable from the performance
of decided wrong.</p>

<p>The hesitation of her manner, and the paleness of her looks were a
sufficient confirmation of the truth of the conjecture; and the
haughty steward, having thus openly avowed the circumstance which had
led to the supposition, after eyeing her with a malignant sneer, that
insulted and wounded her feelings more than the severest invective,
retired from her presence, with the self-important air of a man who
congratulates himself upon some new and valuable discovery.</p>

<p>Soon after this event, Ambrose was dispatched with a letter to the
nearest town, addressed to the Marchese; which Paoli informed Madame
Chamont was respecting some business which was to be transacted
before his return into Italy, which could not be conducted without
the directions of his Lord; and at the same time avoiding any hint
that could justify the opinion that it had any relation to
herself.</p>

<p>Some weeks passed without any material occurrence; in which time
the steward, in the presence of Madame Chamont, still preserved that
stately kind of reserve, which necessarily forbids the communication
of sentiment; seeming to regard the family at the castle as people of
an inferior order, whose welfare and happiness were entirely
dependant upon himself, and over whom he was permitted to exercise an
unlimited power.</p>

<p>This behaviour could not pass without the deserved imputation of
arrogance; and Madame Chamont, who possessed a delicate sense of
propriety, and had been early taught to make reflections upon
character, though she did not allow herself to yield to the impulse
of a quick resentment, was not insensible to the indignity that was
offered her, and anticipated, with somewhat of impatience, the moment
of his departure.</p>

<p>A letter from the Marchese, that was directed to Paoli, in answer
to that which had been recently conveyed to him, was now brought to
the castle. The joy evidently expressed in the countenance of the
steward, on the perusal of it, could not pass unobserved; but the
contents, or even the subject of the epistle, was carefully
concealed.</p>

<p>Madame Chamont, who was too well acquainted with the disposition
of the Marchese, not to be assured that she had much to fear from his
resentment, should he arrive at the knowledge of La Roque's release,
which she had every reason to believe would be the case, that she
felt depressed and uneasy whenever this was the subject of her
thoughts; and so terrifying were her apprehensions at times, that
nothing but the applause of her own heart, that internal reward of
virtue, could have supported her under them.</p>

<p>It was not without some astonishment that she perceived a
considerable alteration in the manners of Paoli soon after the
receipt of the letter: He appeared at some times unusually animated,
joined frequently in conversation, and lost much of that haughtiness
of demeanour which had hitherto precluded the advances of
freedom.</p>

<p>To account for this sudden alteration was no very easy task,
though Madame Chamont could not forbear surmising, that it was
assumed for the concealment of some deep design; but from whatever
motive it proceeded, it contributed much to the comfort of that part
of the family who were entirely unsuspicious of the cause.</p>

<p>Laurette, whose heart was still occupied by the image of Enrico,
took every opportunity of being alone, when her necessary assistance
in the household concerns did not render her presence indispensable,
that she might ramble alone and unobserved in those walks which his
society had endeared; where she frequently remained till the close of
the day, recollecting every sentiment he had expressed, every object
he had admired, and soothing herself with the hope that she still
lived in his remembrance.</p>

<p>One evening, after having wandered for some time through the
groves and shrubberies surrounding the mansion, which were wild,
lonely, and beautiful, she was tempted to prolong her walk, and
striking into a new path, which apparently led into a wood not
immediately connected with the castle, she felt an irresistible
inclination to follow the track, and proceeded in it rapidly.</p>

<p>Having reached the precincts of the wood, she heard the trampling
of mules as advancing towards the spot, and stopped for a few moments
to distinguish whither they were going. She had not remained long in
this situation before voices were heard, which seemed to approach
nearer, and were soon afterwards succeeded by loud bursts of
laughter, evidently proceeding from intoxication. Alarmed at the
consequence of venturing so far unattended, she receded from the
borders of the forest, and being afraid lest she should be overtaken
before she could arrive at a place of security, ran swiftly towards
home.</p>

<p>As soon as she had entered the gate leading into the second court,
the tolling of the vesper bell, which informed her she had been
absent too long, directed her towards the chapel.</p>

<p>The family were already assembled to render thanks for the
blessings of the day; and, as she placed herself in the aisle where
the congregation were kneeling, Madame Chamont's looks seemed gently
to reproach her inattention to the hour. Laurette felt severely the
reproof, and secretly determining not to merit it again, joined in
devotion with more than her accustomed earnestness.</p>

<p>As soon as vespers were concluded, Paoli requested that Madame
Chamont would indulge him with a few moments' conversation in
private, as he wished to consult with her respecting some repairs
that were wanting on the other side of the edifice. Our heroine fixed
her eyes upon her governess as the proposal was made, and perceived
that she appeared much concerned, though the cause was unknown to
her, and that she seemed unwilling to comply. After having made some
objections, chiefly arising from the lateness of the evening, which
the steward removed by observing that the moon was unusually bright,
and that the distance was so trifling as to preclude the possibility
of danger, she assented; Laurette, who innocently besought permission
to attend them, was repulsed by a frown from Paoli, and not daring to
dispute his authority, returned to the interior of the castle.</p>

<p>As the evening was cold and rather damp, she ordered a fire to be
made in the saloon; and taking one of her favourite authors from her
store of books that were arranged in an antique piece of furniture,
designed for the purpose, she sat down by the cheerful blaze, and
endeavoured to amuse herself with reading.</p>

<p>When nearly an hour had elapsed, she began to be alarmed at Madame
Chamont's absence, which appeared protracted beyond the time which
business required; and desiring Doroth&eacute;e to accompany her,
walked by the side of the rampart wall till she had reached the
northern buildings, the way she recollected they had taken.</p>

<p>The melancholy stillness that universally prevailed, increased the
uneasy sensation that was stealing upon her spirits; and as she
looked anxiously around without distinguishing those she was in
search of, her fears began to augment, and she felt irresolute in
what manner to act.</p>

<p>The apparent dissatisfaction and reluctance with which Madame
Chamont had yielded to the steward's proposal, recurred frequently to
her thoughts, though she was unable to form any conjecture as to the
reason of it, since there was nothing very surprising or singular in
the request.</p>

<p>Yet, notwithstanding the probability of his having something to
communicate in private, which could not well be dispensed with, she
was not unacquainted with the malignant disposition of the steward;
and had oftentimes beheld with astonishment the causeless aversion he
seemed to have conceived for her amiable protectress, ever since she
had been capable of forming a judgment upon the subject.</p>

<p>Having pursued their way for a considerable time without better
success, they mutually agreed to return, and to send Ambrose
immediately in search of them.</p>

<p>This was no sooner determined than they saw Paoli walking by the
side of the wood. He was alone, and unconscious of observation, was
moving slowly and thoughtfully along.</p>

<p>Doroth&eacute;e being anxious to know what was become of her lady,
called to him, and roused him from his reverie. As he turned and
advanced towards them, he betrayed some symptoms of confusion; but
recollecting himself, proceeded to inform them that as he was
conducting Madame Chamont along the northern side of the battlements,
a party of banditti rushed suddenly from the wood, and, regardless of
her cries, or the threats and remonstrances that he had uttered,
seized upon her with violence, and placing her upon a mule, in spite
of every effort he had exerted to effectuate her release, fled
instantly away. The alarm this strange adventure occasioned had, he
added, so entirely deprived him of the power of action, that he was
undetermined what mode to pursue; and was meditating on the most
probable method of overtaking them, when he was roused from these
reflections by the voice of Doroth&eacute;e.</p>

<p>Laurette, being overcome with grief and apprehension, was
insensible to the latter part of the discourse, for she had fainted
in the arms of her attendant, who, after many attempts to recall her
to life, was obliged, with the assistance of the steward, to convey
her into the castle.</p>

<p>Doroth&eacute;e, though she had more command over her feelings,
was not less affected, and besought Paoli to send Ambrose
immediately, accompanied by some of the peasantry, in pursuit of the
ruffians. To this proposal he readily assented, though there appeared
but little probability of success; and Ambrose, with a party of men
armed and mounted, were instantly dispatched.</p>

<p>However unlikely it was that a few simple cottagers, headed by an
old servant, who was equally unskilled in the use of arms, should
succeed in an attack against a band of robbers, it was a hope that
conveyed a solace to the bosom of Laurette, and after many intreaties
she was at last prevailed upon to retire to her bed.</p>

<h3>Chapter 9</h3>

<pre>
Patience and Sorrow strove
Which should express her goodliest; you have seen
Sunshine and rain at once; her smiles and tears
Are like a better May; those happy smiles
That played on her ripe lip, seemed not to know
What guests were in her eyes, which parted thence
As pearls from diamonds dropped; in brief
Sorrow would be a vanity most lov'd.
If all could so become it.
--SHAKESPEARE
</pre>

<p>Laurette arose early in the morning unrefreshed by sleep, and
being informed that the party in pursuit of the robbers were not yet
returned, remained in a state of anxious expectation.
Doroth&eacute;e, and the rest of the domestics, whose hopes were less
sanguine, wept incessantly at their loss; though they carefully
concealed from Laurette this appearance of sorrow, lest it should
lead to the suspicion that the case was hopeless.</p>

<p>It was not till the evening of the ensuing day that Ambrose and
the peasantry returned, without having gained any satisfactory
intelligence of the fate of Madame Chamont. All the information they
were enabled to obtain, was at a small village inn, about a league
and a half from the castle, where they were told that a lady, who
seemed to be a person of rank, had stopped for a few moments in the
society of three men of a strange suspicious appearance. They were
unable to give an accurate description of her person, as she was
covered with a veil of unusual thickness, which descended nearly to
her feet; but, from the little observation they had been able to
make, she seemed to be above the middle size; that during their stay
at the door of the inn, she had betrayed no symptom of fear or
indisposition; and one of the men, of a less ferocious deportment
than the others, having assured her in a low voice that she had
nothing to apprehend, each of the men took a glass of spirits,
without alighting from their mules, and galloped from the place.</p>

<p>As no hint respecting their future destination had escaped them
whilst they were refreshing themselves, the party in pursuit were,
for a short time, undetermined which way to proceed; but, as danger
might be augmented by delay, they finally resolved to follow the
beaten track, and to make a second enquiry at the next town. Here
they arrived at the break of day but were unable to gain any hint
that could lead to the knowledge they desired. They then pursued
their journey for a considerable way, without better success; and as
there appeared but little chance of overtaking them, or of gaining
farther intelligence upon the subject, they mutually agreed to
return.</p>

<p>Laurette, now finding that the feeble hope which had sustained her
was delusive, felt the keenest affliction, and it was long before a
cessation of sorrow allowed time for reflection, or the animated
exertions of fortitude. To indulge in unavailing regret was, she had
frequently been told, vain and impious; but this was a trial which
youth and inexperience could with difficulty support. Every object
reminded her of her valuable friend, and she found it impossible to
resist the pressure of her grief, which now affected her spirits, and
undermined her health.</p>

<p>A letter from Enrico, which at an earlier period would have been
received with the most innocent effusions of rapture, now tended to
increase her uneasiness; it was directed to Madame Chamont, but
having been always allowed the privilege of perusing his epistles,
she ventured to open it.</p>

<p>As the tender, the dutiful expressions with which it abounded met
her eye, her tears flowed silently and fast; but when she got to that
part of the letter which treated of the danger of his situation, and
informed her that he expected soon to be called into action, her
feelings could no longer be restrained, and she wept and sobbed
aloud.</p>

<p>Paoli, who at first affected to interest himself in her distress,
now either totally disregarded her, as a being unworthy of his
attention, or reproached her with severity for the indulgence of
it.</p>

<p>The only consolation afforded her was derived from the
conversation of Doroth&eacute;e, whose solicitude to remove her
concern mitigated the severity of her own.</p>

<p>The suspicion that Paoli was indirectly an auxiliary in the
affair, would sometimes occur to the imagination of Laurette, though
she could not effectually reconcile it to her reason or the native
candour of her mind. The voices that excited alarm, which she
supposed to be those of the ruffians, and the circumstance of the
steward's requesting the society of Madame Chamont alone, and at that
silent hour, and his walking apparently from the wood from whence
those voices proceeded, was food for conjecture; and a mind less pure
and inexperienced than her own, would have resolutely decided against
him. But she knew the value of that virtue which places the actions
of others in the most favourable light, and willingly rejects every
thing that tends to criminate, if it falls short of conviction.</p>

<p>Had she been acquainted with La Roque's confinement and escape
from the dungeon, which was carefully concealed from her, or had
heard of the bracelet which was found there by the steward,
sufficient evidence would have been collected to justify the
opinion.</p>

<p>The only consolation that now offered itself, was the probability
of Madame Chamont's being still alive, and in a place of safety; for
as one of the men had assured her she had nothing to fear, there
appeared not to be any design upon her life.</p>

<p>Her silence and apparent tranquillity at the inn could not easily
be accounted for; but from whatever cause it proceeded, it wore an
aspect by no means unfavourable.</p>

<p>These circumstances she continued to reflect upon with hope; and
as the possibility of meeting again with her beloved friend was
presented to her young and sanguine imagination, her spirits
gradually revived.</p>

<p>When the mind has once escaped from the influence of overwhelming
calamity, it endeavours to extract comfort from surrounding objects
at once to apply a balm to the wounds it has endured, and to
compensate for the losses it has sustained. So Laurette attempted to
divert the melancholy that assailed her by constant and unremitting
employment; at first her former amusements were irksome and
uninteresting, in a short time they became more supportable, and
finally, as the reward of effort, assumed the power of pleasing.</p>

<p>Though the lovely orphan was too much intimidated to venture far
from the castle alone, she continued to stroll as usual in the
gardens, whose wild and desolate appearance was in unison with her
feelings, and sometimes, under the shade of her favourite tree, where
she had so often sat with Enrico, would resign herself to the
influence of melancholy reflections.</p>

<p>One evening as she was returning from this spot, and had arrived
at the smaller gate which led directly to the mansion, she observed
Lisette, seemingly much affrighted, darting along the side of the
edifice. Anxious to be made acquainted with her cause of alarm, she
called to her, and desired her to stop. The girl, not immediately
hearing her, did not slacken her pace, till Laurette's repeating the
call occasioned her to turn.</p>

<p>Having made some enquiries, which the affrighted servant was too
much terrified to answer, she led her into the hall, and observing
that she looked unusually pale, called instantly for assistance. As
soon as Lisette revived, she informed them, that as she was returning
from one of the cottages on the margin of the river, whither she had
been to convey some food to a poor woman that was ill, according to
her usual custom in cases of a similar nature, she perceived a tall
dreadful looking figure gliding by the side of the rampart. She was
too much agitated, she added, to observe it minutely; but it appeared
much taller than any human being she had ever seen, and very
ghastly.</p>

<p>As soon as she had arrived within a few steps of the court, she
saw the same figure, which she was assured could be no other than an
apparition, stealing along the avenue. Having turned hastily back,
she had, she said, the courage to look behind, and saw the spectre
pursuing her, who having waved its hand mournfully, as if beckoning
her to follow it, vanished suddenly from her sight. In a few moments
a terrible scream, which was more loud and dreadful than any thing
she had ever heard, and which was succeeded by a strange noise or
fluttering in the air, so considerably augmented her alarm as almost
to deprive her of her senses.</p>

<p>When a little recovered from the astonishment which this horrible
phantom had excited, she was, she said, hastening towards home, when
the voice of her young lady, which she believed to be that of the
spirit, increased her terror.</p>

<p>Laurette could not forbear smiling at the latter part of the
recital, and though she could not account for the strange unnatural
appearance she described, she was persuaded that the screams and
flutterings in the air which had so powerfully affected the girl's
fancy, were occasioned by the sudden flight of a number of owls that
inhabited the tops of the turrets. But it was difficult to convince
Lisette that it could otherwise be accounted for than by the
interposition of supernatural agency.</p>

<p>Father Benedicta, who had frequently been at the castle since the
departure of Madame Chamont, having been informed of the strange
incident that had been the cause of it, expressed much surprise and
uneasiness. As he was not ignorant of Della Croisse's escape from
captivity being effected by her means, he naturally suspected the
Marchese to be the primary cause. He knew that under an inscrutable
disguise he was capable of executing the most daring villainy; though
accustomed to think with candour, and act with gentleness, the mild
precepts of his religion did not render Father Benedicta insensible
to the vices of others, neither had they obliterated all traces of
former resentment.</p>

<p>He reflected with concern upon the unprotected situation of
Laurette, and endeavoured to dissuade her from the indulgence of
unavailing sorrow. As she appeared to derive comfort from his
society, his visits were more frequently repeated than before the
commencement of her misfortunes, and he had the satisfaction of
finding, that when he expatiated upon the indispensable necessity of
guarding against that intellectual weakness, which is sometimes
dignified with the name of sensibility, and of the incontestible
advantages arising from an undiminished fortitude, that she listened
to him not only with attention, but with gratitude.</p>

<p>Though the Father had resolved to discover, if possible, whither
Madame Chamont was conveyed, and by what authority she was forced
from the castle, he executed his intentions with secrecy, lest it
should occasion the indulgence of unwarranted hope. Yet though he
extended his enquiries with perseverance and solicitude, they were
ineffectual, and he was finally compelled to relinquish an enterprize
that was attended with so little success.</p>

<p>Laurette was for some time irresolute whether to write to Enrico
immediately, to inform him of this unhappy event, or to defer it till
some future period. The former plan seemed to be the most eligible,
as his endeavours would be exerted in the cause; but the mournful
intelligence she had to communicate, so entirely deprived her of the
power of action, that though she several times began to frame an
epistle, she was long before she accomplished her design.</p>

<p>The idea that probably before the arrival of that letter Enrico
might be no more, would sometimes present itself to her disordered
fancy, with a thousand dreadful accompaniments: She saw him, in her
terrified imagination, borne bleeding and lifeless from the field;
her heart sickened at the thought, till a shower of tears that fell
in large drops upon the paper, which she had prepared for the purpose
of writing to him, relieved her almost bursting bosom.</p>

<p>She recollected every amiable qualification he possessed, his
graceful, his dignified deportment, the uniform delicacy of his
manners, his tenderness, and filial affection. When she remembered
these, and the expression of his countenance at the parting
interview, and saw the groves through which they had walked, and the
flowers they had together admired, her feelings were too painful to
be endured, and she quitted abruptly the place, as if desirous of
escaping from the memorials of her former happiness.</p>

<p>A letter from the Marchese to his steward now arrived at the
castle, which contained an account of the death of the Marchesa. She
had suffered much from a lingering and severe illness, with which she
had been afflicted some time. Having been separated from her husband
soon after her marriage, she had resided, during this state of
premature widowhood, in a mansion on a German estate, in a distant
part of the country.</p>

<p>The Marchese, who had been long weary of his present residence,
the Castello St Aubin, determined immediately on the decease of his
lady, to have the mansion where she had resided repaired and
modernized for his reception.</p>

<p>This occasioned the removal of Paoli, who had orders to visit the
estate, to observe what repairs might be requisite, and to employ a
sufficient number of hands to accomplish the work with all possible
expedition. Having informed Laurette of these particulars, and of his
intention of returning as soon as the business was transacted, the
steward made some little necessary arrangements, and commenced his
journey.</p>

<p>Laurette, in the meantime, dedicated her hours to the most worthy
and useful employments, and with the assistance of the good Friar,
the Father Benedicta, was soon enabled to reflect upon the past, and
to anticipate the future, with some degree of tranquillity.</p>

<p>Her virtues were of the most active kind: she employed means of
being acquainted with the necessities of the indigent, and
experienced the delightful gratification of contributing to their
comforts.</p>

<p>This diffusive humanity, which acquired additional excellence from
its being united with youth and beauty, so exalted her in the
estimation of those who were its objects, that they mingled
admiration with gratitude; and though they lamented the loss of their
former benefactress, who had so suddenly and so strangely
disappeared, they soon discovered that her young charge possessed all
those valuable and endearing qualifications which had rendered her so
deservedly beloved.</p>

<p>Though Laurette, in the course of her reading, had met with some
fictitious tales of distress, those abounding in tender description,
and that irresistibly affect the fancy, were in some measure
prohibited. Madame Chamont, though she had retired early from
society, and of course had mixed but little with the world, was
sufficiently acquainted with the human heart to be convinced that
works of this kind might have a dangerous tendency. She therefore
discountenanced in her young pupil that unlimited indulgence, in the
passive feelings of sensibility, which inevitably unfits the mind for
any undertaking that requires firm and vigorous exertion; she knew
that, when deeply affected by tales of imaginary woe, the mind too
often sinks into imbecility; and when abstracted from the influence
of romantic delusion, it beholds real objects of compassion divested
of those false and glowing colours in which they have been exhibited
by the song of the Poet, or the pen of the Novelist--it beholds them
without that sympathetic interest which would extend the arm of
active benevolence for their relief.</p>

<h3>Chapter 10</h3>

<p>I'll read you matter deep and dangerous.</p>

<p>As full of peril and adventurous spirit</p>

<p>As to o'erwalk a current, roaring loud.</p>

<p>On the unstedfast foot of a spear.</p>

<p>The gentle mind of Laurette, though strengthened by effort, was
yet tenderly alive to mournful impressions, which solitude and the
native softness of her disposition rendered sometimes irresistible.
The silence of Enrico increased her apprehensions, and though she
endeavoured to dissipate her fears, and to sweeten with hope the cup
of affliction, her anguish was sometimes too keen to be subdued, and
her life became a series of sufferance and exertion.</p>

<p>Paoli's absence being protracted beyond what he had intimated as
necessary, it began to be a matter of doubt whether it was his
intention to return, or to remain stationary in the family of the
Marchese; till the trampling of hoofs, heard in the silence of
evening, put an end to conjecture.</p>

<p>Laurette was sitting in her apartment when he arrived,
endeavouring to find comfort in employment, when a message from the
steward, which was delivered by Lisette, summoned her into the
saloon, where he was in waiting to receive her. As soon as she
entered, he presented her with a letter. She was unacquainted with
the hand-writing, but, on opening it, found it bore the signature of
the Marchese de Montferrat. So unexpected a circumstance covered her
with confusion, and she perused it with apparent emotion.</p>

<p>He expressed much astonishment at the intelligence that had been
recently conveyed to him concerning the departure of Madame Chamont,
and also informed her that it was his intention to remove her, in a
few weeks, from her present residence to a less ancient castle, that
was preparing for himself, in the principality of Salzburg. He was,
he added, by unforeseen events, prevented from repairing thither
immediately himself; but, as it would soon be in readiness for her
reception, he had given orders for his steward to convey her to the
mansion, where it was his intention for her to remain during the
winter season. He concluded with desiring her not to regret the loss
of her protectress, as all possible means of discovering the authors
of so unjustifiable a proceeding should be instantly employed.</p>

<p>Laurette examined the contents of this letter with mingled
distress and astonishment. To leave that beloved retreat, which had
been her home from earliest infancy; to be allowed to ramble no more
over those beautiful mountains, which had been the scenes of youthful
festivity, and which were endeared to her by the remembrance of
former happiness, was a subject of painful reflection; but when she
recollected that the felicity which she had once experienced in those
delightful shades was annihilated, and that those who had shared it
with her were separated from her, perhaps for ever, she endeavoured
to reconcile herself to a destiny which, from the unlimited power
which the Marchese possessed over her, she considered as
unavoidable.</p>

<p>Paoli, in the meantime, began to make every necessary preparation
for a speedy removal. And as it appeared probable to Laurette that he
was to remain in the castle mentioned by the Marchese in the absence
of his lord, she endeavoured, though with little hopes of success, to
soften the native moroseness of his disposition with the undeviating
sweetness of her own. But though she frequently attempted to engage
him in conversation, she usually failed in her design; for his mind
was so entirely absorbed in its own reflections and concerns, that he
seemed scarcely conscious of her presence. Yet as the suspicion which
she once faintly entertained, respecting his having entered into a
conspiracy with the ruffians who had forced Madame Chamont into the
woods, was now entirely removed, she beheld him with less
aversion.</p>

<p>As the time drew near which was to separate her from the scenes of
her earliest happiness, she found it difficult to support that serene
tranquillity of soul which she so ardently desired to retain, though
she did not fail to exert every effort in her power to preserve that
uniformity of conduct she had been taught to estimate and admire.</p>

<p>When Father Benedicta again repeated his visit, Laurette informed
him of the letter she had received from the Marchese, and also of his
intention of removing her to another castle in a distant part of the
country, whither she was soon to be conveyed.</p>

<p>The surprise and uneasiness expressed in the countenance of the
Father when the intelligence was communicated, could not pass
unobserved by his lovely young pupil, who beheld him with a silent
and fixed attention.</p>

<p>He asked eagerly under whose protection she was to be placed, and
whether the Marchese was to reside on this estate during her
continuance there.</p>

<p>Assured of the sincerity of his friendship, and grateful for the
interest he had ever discovered in her concerns, Laurette presented
him with the letter. Having perused it, he sighed, shook his head
mournfully, and, as if anxious to escape from enquiry, arose to
depart: 'I shall see you again, my child,' cried the Monk tenderly,
as she followed him towards the door.</p>

<p>Laurette regarded him steadfastly as he spoke, and thought she
perceived a tear steal down his placid cheek. She would have enquired
the cause, but her heart was too full for utterance, and having
attended him to the portal, she watched him as he proceeded along the
avenue till he was lost in distance, and then returning to the
saloon, placed herself in one of the recesses of the windows, and
indulged the acuteness of her feelings in secret.</p>

<p>It was evident from the words of the Friar, as well as from the
tone in which they were delivered, that there was something either in
the stile of the epistle, or in the proposal it contained, that did
not accord with his ideas of propriety. She wished she had been
collected enough to have requested the avowal of his sentiments, and
looked forwards to another interview with somewhat of impatience.</p>

<p>The Marchese she had never seen, consequently, though he had
offered her his castle, he was uninfluenced by affection. She had
been taught to believe that he was her only surviving friend and
protector; yet, as he had never conciliated her esteem by winning
offices of kindness, her gratitude was unmingled with tenderness.</p>

<p>The mysterious silence that had been preserved concerning her
birth, she had often considered with surprise; she was called
Laurette, but no other name was added; and when she ventured to
extend her enquiries, her questions were either evaded, or remained
entirely unanswered. When blessed with the protection of Madame
Chamont, the subject was attended with curiosity, and not with
regret; but now that protection was withdrawn, it returned forcibly
upon her mind. She had been told she was an orphan, but every hint
that could tend to a farther knowledge of this mystery was carefully
avoided.</p>

<p>These reflections, which the forlornness of her situation
suggested, added to the uncertainty of the fate of Madame Chamont and
Enrico; so entirely occupied her thoughts, that the taciturnity of
the steward, and the presaging gloom of his aspect were unobserved,
or beheld with indifference. But on being assured that
Doroth&eacute;e and Lisette were to attend her to her place of
destination, her spirits became suddenly reanimated and she began to
prepare for her journey with redoubled alacrity.</p>

<p>As to ramble alone in the wood, or along the solitary glens of the
mountains, was a charm the most suited to her mind, she yielded to
the impulse of her feelings, and often, in the meek hour of twilight,
would gaze with a tranquil kind of melancholy upon those dear, those
much-loved scenes she was soon to resign for ever.</p>

<p>One evening, on her return from one of these lonely excursions,
she seated herself against a window in the room which she always
called her own, because it contained the implements of her studies
and her amusements.</p>

<p>When wrapped in pensive reflections, as she was gazing upon the
moon gliding silently along through a clear and cloudless sky, she
observed a white figure, somewhat answering to the description that
Lisette had given of the phantom which had occasioned her alarm, move
slowly beneath the arch of the window.</p>

<p>Though Laurette had before treated this appearance as an illusion,
she now felt a superstitious dread stealing upon her mind. Fear, for
a moment, arrested her faculties, but an effort of fortitude
releasing them, she arose and opened the casement. In a few minutes
the same figure emerged from the deep shade of the trees, and
approached towards the window.</p>

<p>She started and was retreating, till the sound of her own name,
uttered in a deep and hollow tone, rivetted her to the spot. She
stopped--it was again repeated, and venturing to raise her eyes
towards the object of her terror, she beheld a person standing before
her, of a pale and melancholy aspect, clad in the habit of a monk; he
was tall and of a singular physiognomy, he wore no cowl nor even a
cloak, and his dress being entirely white, except a narrow black
scapulary, added much to the ghastliness of his appearance.</p>

<p>As he moved towards the casement, he waved his hand, in token for
her to stop, and again repeating the name of Laurette, with deeper
emphasis, 'Beware,' cried he, 'of the Marchese de Montferrat.'</p>

<p>Laurette trembled, but was unable to articulate; she scarcely knew
whether the being addressing her was human or supernatural; a
sensation of mingled terror and awe almost overcame her, and it was
with difficulty that she could prevent herself from falling.</p>

<p>The Monk, not seeming to regard her emotion, drew a miniature from
beneath his garment, and then surveying her for a moment in silence,
added--'Will you, in consideration of my holy office, utter a solemn
promise, which nothing shall prevail upon you to violate, never to
disclose to any individual living what I am about to relate?'</p>

<p>Laurette's tremor increased; but not being allowed time for
reflection, and having no idea that a person in the garb of a
religious could act so inconsistently with that devout character as
to exact a promise which she could not make with impunity, she gave
her answer in the affirmative.</p>

<p>'Will you swear then,' resumed the Father, raising his voice still
higher, which acquired deeper energy of expression as he proceeded,
'by the ever spotless and holy Maria, by the accepted souls of the
departed, and by the blessed assembly of the Saints and Martyrs, to
keep this vow inviolable, till I shall call upon you to attest the
truth of what I shall hereafter declare, at some future and,
perchance, far distant period.'</p>

<p>Laurette tremblingly assented to the proposition, and the Father
repeating the form in which he wished it to be delivered, she
pronounced it after him.</p>

<p>When this impressive vow was recited agreeable to the desire of
the Father, he presented Laurette with the miniature which he held
suspended by a chain of brilliants, and then softening his voice,
added, 'Take this, it is the portrait of thy mother; wear it as an
invaluable gift, and to-morrow, as soon as vespers are concluded,
meet me at the equestrian statue in the inner court. Recollect the
solemnity of your promise, and I will unfold to you an important
secret.'</p>

<p>She was going to reply, but before she was sufficiently collected,
he had glided amongst the trees, and had disappeared.</p>

<p>'The portrait of my mother!' cried Laurette, fixing her eyes upon
the picture with a look of undescribable astonishment, 'is it
possible; and have I then a parent living?' But in an instant
remembering that the delivery of the miniature by no means implied
that she was still in existence, a slight degree of disappointment
was communicated to her heart.</p>

<p>Doroth&eacute;e, who entered the room to kindle a fire, broke
unwelcomely upon her solitude; but mindfull of the injunctions of her
mysterious visitor, Laurette arose, and, after secreting the
portrait, assumed an appearance of composure.</p>

<p>As soon as she was again alone, and her thoughts were somewhat
recomposed, she began to muse upon this singular occurrence. If this
was the person who had excited so much alarm in the bosom of Lisette,
it was strange that his nocturnal rambles had not been regularly
continued, as since that time no one had been seen about the grounds
in the least answering to that description; and as the subject of his
visits was undoubtedly herself, and the secret he had to declare was
of so important a nature, it was natural to suppose, instead of
avoiding her, he would have loitered within the boundaries of the
mansion, in the hope of meeting with her.</p>

<p>The solemn manner in which these words were pronounced, 'Beware of
the Marchese de Montferrat!' struck her with dismay. To beware of him
whom she had been taught to revere as a parent, and to look forwards
to as the patron of her future days, was not more astonishing than
afflictive. The admonition seemed to presage some impending evil from
which it was impossible to fly; and the dread of what she might have
to encounter, alone and unfriended, now entirely occupied her
thoughts, tending to make her fear more than ever the approach of
that hour which was to separate her from the much-loved scenes of her
earliest youth.</p>

<p>As she examined the features of the portrait, rendered infinitely
more touching by the sweet pensive cast of the countenance, she
thought she had somewhat seen a painting that strongly characterized
it; and as the castle contained all that had ever fallen under her
observation, she was resolved to regard them more attentively, and,
if possible, to trace the resemblance.</p>

<p>The chain, by which the miniature was suspended, did not fail to
attract her admiration; she had never seen any thing of the sort, and
the jewels, though small, being of the most valuable kind, possessed
unusual brilliancy and lustre.</p>

<p>As Laurette wished to ruminate in secret upon this singular
adventure, she retired to her room earlier than was her custom, at
once to abridge the moments of suspense, and to lose the society of
Paoli. But though weary and indisposed, she was unable to sleep, and
arose in the morning but little refreshed.</p>

<p>Her first resolve was to examine the portraits, which were very
numerous, and much defaced by time and neglect. She had wandered over
the greatest part of the castle, except the northern side of the
building which remained always unopened, before she recollected the
paintings in the oriel, which were more modern, and consequently less
injured than the rest.</p>

<p>Here she examined the picture which had attracted the attention of
Madame Chamont soon after her arrival at the mansion. It represented
the figure of a female leaning upon a tomb, the countenance of which
bore some resemblance to the miniature; the latter, indeed, appeared
somewhat younger, and, if possible, still more beautiful. It
possessed the same softness of expression, but there was less of
melancholy; a smile beamed from the eyes, which were dark, and full
of the most animated sweetness, while the light brown tresses that
shaded the forehead, and waved carelessly upon the neck, completed
the character of beauty.</p>

<p>But for whom the portrait was designed, which she imagined was so
lively a representation of that presented by the Monk, she had never
been informed; though she remembered having once questioned
Margaritte concerning it. But as her only hope of gaining
intelligence upon the subject depended upon the expected interview in
the evening, she awaited the hour with increasing solicitude.</p>

<h3>Chapter 11</h3>

<pre>
With what a leaden and retarding weight
Does expectation load the wing of Time!
--MASON
</pre>

Willing to divert her thoughts from a subject in which she was too
nearly interested, Laurette attempted, though without success, to
find amusement in employment: She took up her lute, but her fingers
were unable to perform their office; the notes she awakened were low,
spiritless, and inharmonious, and it was replaced with languor and
dissatisfaction. Her embroidery and books were equally ineffectual to
bestow the charm of content, and the more frequently this strange
incident recurred to her mind, the more insupportable were the
moments of suspense. That attractive composure of demeanour, which
formerly added the most winning softness to her motions, had in some
degree forsaken her; she reflected, with concern, upon her promise to
the Father, and seemed equally to dread and to desire the expected
interview. 

<p>As soon as dinner was removed, she arose and quitted the room,
meaning to ramble though the shrubberies; but as the afternoon was a
remarkably fine one, she determined to endeavour, at least, to calm
the more painful emotions by visiting the cottages that bordered the
river, whose simple and industrious inhabitants had been always the
objects of her bounty.</p>

<p>Having relieved the necessities of those who apparently suffered
the most from the hardships of poverty, and listened with peculiar
kindness to the infantine prattle of the children, who were each
anxious to gain a smile or a kiss from their lovely benefactress, she
continued her walk.</p>

<p>The loneliness of the road she had chosen was ill adapted to her
present frame of mind, as it failed, for want of variety in its
scenery, to fix her attention, and to recall her from that harassing
anxiety which enervates, and unfits for action.</p>

<p>The singular aspect of the Monk, his abrupt stile of addressing
her, the secret he had to disclose so dreadfully important as his
manner had indicated, were circumstances ever present to her
thoughts. Sometimes it occurred to her that the expected discovery
related to Madame Chamont, and that the person who had so strangely
introduced himself, having by some means become acquainted with the
violent measures that had been adopted in forcing her from her abode,
and of the primary cause of them, intended, by making it known to
those who were the most nearly concerned in her welfare, to prevent
the unhappy consequences that might otherwise ensue. But this, on a
second review, appeared unlikely; if the Monk had obtained any
knowledge upon this subject, he would doubtless have embraced some
other means of conveying this necessary intelligence at an earlier
period, and of rendering her such advice and assistance, as to the
manner of proceeding, as would have been consistent with his holy
character and office.</p>

<p>What he had to unfold must then relate merely to herself,
something probably concerning her birth. This opinion the delivery of
the picture seemed to corroborate; but who it could be that had
acquired information upon a subject which had hitherto been so
mysteriously concealed, and by what means he had gained possession of
the picture, which he declared to be the portrait of her mother, were
points equally surprising and unaccountable.</p>

<p>The shades of night that fell fast upon the surrounding objects,
now warning her of the approaching hour, quickened her steps towards
the castle.</p>

<p>The soft stillness of the evening that seemed to breathe peace and
tranquillity, tended to revive her depressed spirits, enabling her to
reflect upon the appointment she had made with more composure and
serenity.</p>

<p>As soon as she entered the hall, the shrill tone of the
vesper-bell reminded her of her mysterious visitor, and summoned her
to nocturnal prayer.</p>

<p>When the service was concluded, and the family were retired from
the chapel, with trembling steps and a palpitating heart she prepared
to meet the Monk, according to her engagement.</p>

<p>Having waited for a few minutes in the outward court, in hopes of
seeing Paoli enter the castle, she observed, with some emotion, that
he turned into the wood that secreted the eastern side of the
edifice. But as he sometimes rambled alone in the evening for a
considerable time, she began to flatter herself into the opinion that
he would not return from his excursion during her conference with the
Father.</p>

<p>She had no sooner entered the smaller court, and placed herself by
the column, than she perceived the mysterious Monk, with a thoughtful
and dejected air, moving slowly through the avenue.</p>

<p>When he had arrived at the vista he stopped, crossed himself, and
then numbering his Paternosters and Ave Marias on his rosary, a
ceremony which Laurette's impatience would at that moment gladly have
spared, he hastened to the appointed place.</p>

<p>A hood was added to his dress, which he threw back the instant he
recognized Laurette, and a small crucifix of silver was suspended on
his breast.</p>

<p>Having advanced within a few paces of the column--'I am come,'
said he, fixing his eyes upon her with a mild and steadfast gaze, 'to
warn you of the dangers that threaten you--to save you from misery,
and perchance from death. I am come also,' added he, sighing deeply,
and clasping his hands together, with a look directed meekly towards
heaven, 'to acquaint you with the wrongs you have endured, and to
unveil the hidden mysteries of your birth. Listen to me, my child; on
this moment, this important moment, depends your future destiny.'</p>

<p>Laurette trembled, and looking fearfully around, whilst the Father
was repeating his injunctions of secrecy in the same manner as on the
preceding day, she beheld Paoli embowered in some trees that
projected from the side of the wood, apparently listening to their
discourse. Fear almost deprived her of utterance: 'We are observed,'
cried she, in tremulous and broken accents, 'leave me, holy Father, I
beseech you--to-morrow at this hour.'</p>

<p>She could proceed no farther; the Monk glided amongst the trees,
to elude the observation of Paoli, who finding himself discovered,
rushed instantly from the wood.</p>

<p>Having demanded, in an imperious tone, with whom she was
conversing, and what was the subject of their conference, and
Laurette, amazed at his presumption and arrogance, resolutely
refusing to answer, he seized her rudely by the arm, and led her into
the saloon.</p>

<p>Here he again repeated his command, but finding that neither this
nor menaces were likely to prove effectual, as she replied to his
interrogatories with a degree of firmness which he termed the most
daring obstinacy, he desired her to prepare for her departure from
the castle on the following morning.</p>

<p>This was a blow the gentle spirits of Laurette could with
difficulty support; yet no alternative remained. She was too well
acquainted with the disposition of the steward to believe he would
yield to intreaty, and she was also convinced, from the judgment she
had formed of his character, that if she ventured to expostulate with
him, or to enquire by what authority he was capacitated to remove her
from her present residence, without the knowledge and acquiescence of
the Marchese, before the expiration of the time proposed, that by
thus appearing to doubt his consequence in the eye of his Lord, he
would only, by more arbitrary proceedings, endeavour to convince her
of the unlimited extent of his power.</p>

<p>Being assured that all hopes of receiving the information she so
ardently desired, respecting her birth and connection, were now
entirely frustrated, she felt all the bitterness of disappointment
and perplexity; as she was perfectly convinced that was she even
permitted to remain a few weeks longer at the castle, she would
doubtless be so strictly watched by the suspicious eye of Paoli
during the interval, as to render a second interview with the Monk
impracticable.</p>

<p>The night was passed by Laurette in a state of restless anxiety;
what she had heard from the Father increased her uneasiness, and
nothing but the rectitude of her intentions, and the conscious
innocence of her conduct, could have sustained her under this new
cause of distress.</p>

<h3>Chapter 12</h3>

At night returning, every labour sped.
He sits him down the monarch of a shed.
Smiles by his chearful fire, and round surveys
His children's looks, that brighten at the blaze;

--GOLDSMITH
</pre>

<p>The sun had scarce risen upon the mountains before Laurette, by
the desire of the steward, was awakened from a soft slumber into
which she had recently fallen, with orders for her to prepare for an
immediate departure.</p>

<p>Doroth&eacute;e, who was the unwilling messenger of these
unpleasant tidings, unable to bear the idea of this temporary
separation, as it was determined on the preceding night that she and
Lisette were not to accompany them, but to remain at the castle till
the return of Ambrose; Laurette, feeling more collected than she had
been since her interview with the Monk, assumed an appearance of
serenity, and having conversed with her faithful servant for some
time, as she sat by the side of the bed, with the most affecting
tenderness, she gave some necessary orders concerning her wardrobe,
her books, and what other things she wished to have conveyed to her
future residence, and then ordering breakfast to be served in her
apartment, prepared to obey the summons.</p>

<p>She had scarcely partaken of the morning's repast before she was
informed that the mules were in readiness, and that Paoli and Ambrose
were already impatiently awaiting her arrival.</p>

<p>Having taken a tender adieu of the kind Margaritte, who was too
old to be a follower of her fortunes, and had therefore determined to
return to the cottage she formerly possessed in an adjacent village;
she presented her with her five last remaining rix-dollars, as the
reward of her services; and waving her hand to her poor pensioners,
who crowded about her to give and to receive a last farewel, she held
her handkerchief to her eyes, as if afraid to trust herself with a
last look at the only home she had ever known, and advanced towards
the gate.</p>

<p>Being placed upon the mule that was guided by the steward, Ambrose
mounted the lesser one, and after some resistance on the part of the
latter, who had been for some time unaccustomed to discipline, they
pursued their journey.</p>

<p>It was a fine autumnal morning, and as the travellers advanced,
the face of Nature, which at the early hour they had chosen, wore a
lowering and unpromising aspect, now gradually brightened. The mists,
which had veiled the tops of the eminences, were suddenly dispersed,
and the sun, no longer watery and dim, spread over the landscape a
soft and silvery light.</p>

<p>The birds, whose responses were at first low, now swelled into
choral harmony; every object seemed to partake of the general joy;
all was melody, delight, and ecstasy.</p>

<p>Laurette meditated on them in silence, lamenting at the same time
that she could not join in these universal expressions of rapture,
which would have afforded her inconceivable pleasure, had melancholy
anticipation been banished from her heart.</p>

<p>The same gloomy reserve marked the behaviour of Paoli that was
peculiar to his character; sometimes he turned to Laurette, and asked
her some questions concerning the road, and whether the motion was
too slow or too rapid, and then, without attending to the answer,
relapsed into his former state of silence and thoughtfulness.</p>

<p>There were several small inns on the road that afforded them rest
and provisions, whose inhabitants frequently extended their civility
beyond the common bounds of hospitality, seeming anxious to
accommodate them with every necessary which their situation as
travellers required.</p>

<p>It was not till the evening of the third day that they arrived
near the boundaries of Salzburg, when Laurette was informed by the
steward, who appeared somewhat to relax from his reserve, that they
were within two days' journey of the castle of Lunenburg, which was
the name of her future abode.</p>

<p>The beauty of the landscape now visibly improved; the boundless
and variegated plains, innumerable lakes, rivers, brooks, and valleys
of tremendous depth, encompassed with huge rocks of granite, which,
being contrasted with the dark woods that waved from the cultivated
mountains, had an unspeakable fine effect, and could not be gazed
upon without the most sublime and exquisite sensations.</p>

<p>Every thing was presented to the eye in these beautiful regions
which the most fertile and picturesque imagination could conceive;
and Laurette, recalled from the contemplation of her own peculiar
distresses, beheld some of the finest scenery in nature with
indescribable astonishment.</p>

<p>Every beauty was augmented by contrast; sometimes the hut of a
shepherd, or the cottage of a goatherd, situated upon the hanging
brow of a precipice, caught her eye, shaded only by the foliated
branches of the oak from the inclemency of the weather. The roads in
this mountainous country being in general good, they proceeded on
their journey with less fatigue than would otherwise have been the
case. The most dreadful abysses were rendered passable by the
assistance of wooden bridges, which were hung in chains, some
apparently so loosely as to impress on the mind an alarming idea of
danger. But of their safety our travellers were assured by the
peasantry, who asserted that an accident very rarely happened from
this mode of conveyance, as the heaviest carriages had been known to
pass over without receiving any injury but what might be occasioned
by a violent gust of wind, or a sudden fall of snow in the
spring.</p>

<p>Having left the town of Salzburg on the right, they proceeded on
their way with redoubled speed, in hopes of being able to reach the
next tolerable inn, which Paoli recollected was at some distance from
the place.</p>

<p>But as the evening was approaching, and Laurette was somewhat
fatigued and indisposed, it was mutually agreed that the party should
endeavour to get accommodations at one of the cottages that lay
scattered upon the road.</p>

<p>One peculiar for its neatness riveted their attention, and Ambrose
being dispatched with a message, Laurette and Paoli stopped at the
bottom of the hill on which it was situated, to await the success of
his embassy.</p>

<p>In a short time the owner of this little retreat, attended by his
daughter, with all that diffusive hospitality which is characteristic
of the peasantry of Salzburg, mingled with a certain degree of
courtesy that seemed not to be wholly the gift of nature, appeared to
conduct them to the cottage.</p>

<p>All that Laurette had ever read of rural simplicity, content, and
innocence, and all that her imagination, though somewhat warm and
romantic, had formed, fell short of that which was presented to her
in the family of the cottager.</p>

<p>Zierman, which was the name of her host, having led them into a
small neat room, whose casement was embowered with the honeysuckle
and the eglantine, and which commanded a prospect of pastoral beauty
almost unequalled, left our heroine and the steward alone, whilst he
went to assist Ambrose in finding a place of security for his mules,
and to order refreshment for his guests.</p>

<p>In a few minutes he returned with some fruit, cream, and a thin
kind of wine, which was all that the cottage afforded.</p>

<p>Having partaken of this hospitable meal, which was animated with a
smile of unfeigned welcome, the spirits of the travellers were
recruited; and as Paoli conversed with the peasant, who seemed,
though placed in obscurity, to possess some knowledge of men and
manners, Laurette amused herself with observing the beautiful variety
of every thing around.</p>

<p>The little garden cultivated with care, that was surrounded with a
hedge blooming with briar-roses and wild honeysuckles, discovered not
only the simplicity but the taste of its owner; beyond which arose
hills formed into the most picturesque lines, and covered with
delightful verdure, which acquired an appearance of the most
flourishing vegetation from being contrasted with those tremendous
mountains, whose summits, penetrating the clouds, were veiled in
awful obscurity.</p>

<p>Much as she had been accustomed to admire the wild and extensive
scenery which her former residence commanded, the infinite diversity
of objects which were visible from this secluded retreat, could not
be contemplated without the sublimest emotions.</p>

<p>When Paoli and his host had conversed for some time upon common
subjects, the latter began to recite some particulars relative to
himself and his family, which were interesting, because in relating
them he discovered a sensibility of mind not usually found in that
sphere of life, the hard and laborious employments of which preclude
the cultivation of the nicer feelings.</p>

<p>Paoli, who neither understood nor internally applauded these
amiable traits of character which Laurette observed with increasing
admiration, apparently listened to the discourse, though his
intellectual powers were probably more profitably employed in the
contemplation of some favourite project.</p>

<p>'It is now ten years,' added the old man, with a sigh, and a tear
which he endeavoured to repress, 'since I lost my wife; she died
suddenly, and for some time this cottage, which was once so dear to
mc, and in which I had enjoyed so many hours of repose and happiness,
was by this unexpected event rendered insupportable, which determined
me to remove from it to another occupied by my daughter, that is
situated about a league and a half from this place; hoping to take
refuge from uneasiness in the society of my only child, who was
united to a young farmer, to whom she had been long attached, a few
months before the death of her mother.</p>

<p>'There I remained some time, till my natural affection to my
little paternal inheritance returning, I felt an irresistible
inclination to revisit it. Having obviated some objections on the
part of my daughter and her husband, I at length prevailed upon them
to accompany me here; and in their society, and in the amusement
their little family affords, I have regained that habitual
cheerfulness of temper which I am persuaded is one of the first
blessings of life.'</p>

<p>Here Zierman was interrupted by the entrance of Ulrica, his
daughter, with two of her children, whom Laurette remembered having
seen and admired as she ascended the hill, when they were engaged in
play with their companions in the glens of the mountains.</p>

<p>As soon as Ulrica entered, she repeated the same friendly welcome
with which the party were at first received, and then seating herself
by the side of her young guest, to whom she more particularly
addressed herself, occasionally joined in conversation.</p>

<p>Laurette being now materially recovered from her fatigue by the
salutary rest and refreshment that had been administered, requested
permission to walk to the end of the garden, which terminated in a
kind of natural terrace, that she might be gratified with the beauty
of the prospect. The hostess agreed to the proposition, and attended
her to the place.</p>

<p>It commanded an infinitude of objects of the most interesting and
attractive kind: on the right was a beautiful lake retiring amongst
the hills into remote distance, whose silvery appearance, contrasted
with the dark woods that frequently interrupted its course, had a
very charming effect. On the left, appeared a range of rocks of an
enormous size, some of which, projecting forwards, frowned over the
Saltza, that rushed impetuously through the cliffs with the foam of a
cataract; except the noise of this boisterous stream, which, from its
being softened by distance, occasioned only a gentle murmur, no other
sound was to be heard, save the tones of a flute, resounding from the
valleys or from the brow of a precipice, to assemble the sheep around
the huts of the peasants.</p>

<p>As Laurette took a survey of this beautiful country, she was
tempted to believe that happiness was exclusively the portion of the
shepherd and the goatherd, and would at that moment gladly have
resigned all future advantages for a similar situation, could those
she had lost have been restored to her.</p>

<p>Having thanked Ulrica for her attention with the most insinuating
courtesy of manners, Laurette made some general enquiries concerning
the families of the mountaineers whose picturesque habitations had so
romantic an appearance, and then returned towards the cottage.</p>

<p>Here she found Paoli and his host regaling themselves with some
wine and grapes which the son-in-law of the latter had presented to
them in her absence, and of which, on being politely offered to her
on her entrance, she consented to partake.</p>

<p>The moon now shone full into the casement, and every sound being
hushed, except the light trembling of the leaves that overshadowed
the cottage, Laurette intimated a wish to retire, and was conducted
by her hostess to her room.</p>

<p>As she paused for a moment at the window of the apartment to enjoy
the serenity of the scene, the notes of a guitar, accompanied by a
female voice that breathed the most affecting sweetness, fixed her to
the spot. The air, which was a melancholy one, seemed to have been
awakened by no common sorrow, and throwing open the casement, she
stood for some time to be assured from whence it proceeded, and to
indulge herself in the soft sensation of sympathy which the song
inspired.</p>

<p>As she still listened, the strain died away upon the air, and all
was again silent; but after a momentary pause it swelled louder, and
seemed to approach nearer towards the cottage.</p>

<p>In hopes of being able to get a sight of the harmonist, she still
lingered at the window, but, contrary to her expectation, the music
seemed to retreat again towards the woods, and was soon heard no
more.</p>

<p>Ulrica, who re-entered the room to enquire if she could render her
any farther assistance, gave her some intelligence relative to the
musician, who she learned was a young woman who had met with a
disappointment in the tender passion, which had occasioned the loss
of her senses.</p>

<p>'I know but little of the story, Madame,' resumed Ulrica, 'but I
believe my father can inform you of the whole. All that I have heard
is, that she is the daughter of a goatherd, and that she lives in a
small hut on one of the neighbouring mountains;--her name is Ida; her
lover, I think, died on the day fixed for their marriage; but there
are many mournful circumstances attending the story which I am partly
unacquainted with, for it is now several years since they happened,
and at that time I was not resident in the neighbourhood. But ever
since the commencement of her misfortunes she has wandered about in
the woods, singing so sweetly that I have heard my father say, before
it was known to be Ida, it was reported that the woods were
haunted.'</p>

<p>'And does no one attend her,' asked Laurette, 'in her nocturnal
rambles?'</p>

<p>'Yes, her father or her brother follows her at some distance,'
returned the hostess; 'but she will not allow them to break in upon
her solitude; if it was known to her that she was watched, she would
become desperate; so that they are compelled to indulge her in this
unfortunate propensity, which frequently deprives them of rest,
because her father, who adores her, will not allow her to be
confined. In the day-time she usually remains in her hut, though I
have sometimes seen her in the glens of the rocks culling flowers
from the interstices, and forming them into garlands, and then sing
so sadly, that I have been unable to refrain from weeping.</p>

<p>'But it is a mournful story, Madame,' continued Ulrica, observing
that her fair auditor appeared much affected; 'let us change the
subject.'</p>

<p>Laurette forced a smile upon her features, and desiring that she
might no longer detain her, since it was a late hour, and the rest of
the family were in bed, wished her a good night, and endeavoured to
forget her own sorrows, and those of the unfortunate Ida, in
repose.</p>

<p>As soon as the morning appeared, the travellers arose from their
slumbers, and after a simple repast, returned thanks to the cottagers
for their hospitable reception, who would accept no pecuniary reward
for their services, and then continued their journey.</p>

<p>It was not till the evening that they arrived within sight of the
place of their destination, and Laurette's heart sunk within her when
the first turret was partially seen through the dark foliage of the
woods with which it was surrounded.</p>

<p>As they advanced nearer, the body of the edifice gradually emerged
from the gloom, and the moon, throwing her soft light upon its
summit, discovered a magnificent abode, which, from comparison with
the desolate looking mansion they had left, appeared to the young and
astonished eyes of Laurette like the residence of an eastern
prince.</p>

Bear me, embowering shades, between.
Through many a glade and vista green;
Whate'er can captivate the sight.
Elysian lawns and prospects bright;
Give me, fair Fancy, to pervade
Chambers in pictur'd pomp array'd.
Peopling whose stately walls, I view
The godlike forms that Raphael drew;
I seem to see his magic hand
Wield the wond'rous pencil wand.
Whose touches animation give.

</pre>

<p>As soon as the travellers had alighted, Paoli conducted Laurette
to a private-door, and having ordered a female-servant to convey her
into the interior of the castle, left her whilst he gave some
necessary orders to Ambrose respecting the mules.</p>

<p>Our heroine in the meantime proceeded through a long extent of
passage, dimly lighted by a lamp, which terminated in a spiral
stair-case. As soon as she had ascended the steps, the woman who
attended her opened a door leading into an anti-chamber, which was
furnished with much taste and magnificence, where, to her
inexpressible astonishment, she beheld a lady, apparently about
forty, genteelly and rather elegantly dressed, seated upon a
sofa.</p>

<p>Laurette being somewhat embarrassed at the appearance of the
stranger, who herself betrayed some symptoms of surprise, endeavoured
to apologize for her intrusion, and to explain the occasion of
it.</p>

<p>Signora d'Orfo, which was the name of the lady, having acquitted
herself with much grace and propriety, led her to a seat, and
observing that she looked faint, rang the bell for refreshment.</p>

<p>The courteous manners of the stranger, whose aspect bespoke her a
woman of rank, soon dissipated the uneasy sensations of her guest,
who was early relieved from the suspicion that her arrival was
unexpected, though it was evident that it was precipitated without
orders from the Marchese.</p>

<p>The air of tender dejection that marked the features of Laurette,
and the peculiar elegance of her deportment, rendered still more
interesting by that gentle diffidence of manner, occasioned by the
exquisite sensibility of a mind yet new to the world, so insinuated
her into the affections of the Signora, that admiration was mingled
with pity, and she felt an irresistible desire to be more
particularly acquainted with her story, of which she had heard
something, but not distinctively, and to conciliate her regard. Yet
being influenced by the native gentleness of her heart, she forbore
to make an immediate enquiry, lest it should lead to melancholy
remembrances; and having prevailed upon her to partake of a repast
that was prepared for her, finding that rest was more than ordinarily
requisite, she conducted her to her apartment.</p>

<p>Laurette, when alone, began to ruminate upon an incident which,
though unlooked for, was attended with some degree of pleasure. Her
first conjecture was, that the lady who presided at the castle in the
absence of its owner, was related to the Marchese; and this opinion
the air of fashion that distinguished her, and the circumstances of
her being at the mansion previous to his arrival, to prepare it for
his reception, seemed to justify. But that Paoli, who consequently
must have been apprized of the affair, should have preserved so
strict a silence upon the subject, notwithstanding his disposition
was naturally uncommunicative, was a matter of astonishment.</p>

<p>In the morning Signora d'Orfo entered her room, and having made
some general enquiries concerning her health, which were answered
with the most captivating sweetness, they descended into the
breakfast room.</p>

<p>Though Laurette exerted herself as much as possible to wear an
appearance of cheerfulness, she frequently sunk into fits of
abstraction. The uncertain fate of her lamented friend, whose loss
had so long wounded her repose, the mysterious silence of Enrico,
whose dangerous enterprize her fears had so materially augmented,
preyed upon her heart; and now that she was removed from the castle,
it seemed as if she was separated for ever from every vestige of her
former happiness. Yet to appear uneasy in the presence of her new
acquaintance, whose solicitude to please could not be misconstrued,
would, she considered, wear an appearance of ingratitude, or at least
of indifference, which might injure her in the estimation of a person
apparently so little deserving of neglect or inattention.</p>

<p>This reflection instigated her to endeavour, at least, to conceal
that regret which she found it was impossible to erase, under an
assumed tranquillity of deportment; but in this attempt she succeeded
so ill that the Signora, who possessed much penetration, united to a
sound judgment and a thorough knowledge of the world, easily
discovered that she was unhappy; and though partly acquainted with
the cause, arising from her own forlorn and dependant situation,
which, joined to the uncertainty of her birth, a mind of sensibility
could not reflect upon without pain, she believed there was some more
recent occasion of inquietude, and curiosity, as well as pity, was
excited in her bosom.</p>

<p>As soon as breakfast was over, the Signora proposed a walk in the
gardens, observing, that since they were at present condemned to
solitude, they must accommodate themselves to what was unavoidable,
and extract comfort, if not happiness, from the means that were
offered them.</p>

<p>'There are some paintings also in the castle,' resumed the
Signora, 'which are worthy of notice; and if you will permit me, I
will conduct you through the principal apartments, and we will then
take a stroll through the grounds.'</p>

<p>Charmed with the gentle attentions of her new friend, Laurette
unreluctantly assented to the proposal; and throwing an embroidered
scarf over her shoulders, followed the Signora through the
corridor.</p>

<p>Several of the rooms were in an unfinished state, but those that
were completed were extremely magnificent, and much taste was
displayed in the decoration; some of them were hung with damask,
others with costly tapestry, and the inferior ones with gilt leather.
The furniture corresponded with these, and appeared so much superior
to any thing Laurette had ever seen, that she could not forbear
expressing her surprise. The Signora smiled at the simplicity of her
remarks, and anticipated her astonishment when she should behold the
grand saloons and principal rooms in the castle.</p>

<p>Having taken a general survey of the upper apartments, they
proceeded towards the northern gallery, which was ornamented with
several paintings from sacred history by the first masters of the
Lombard school, as Titian, Paul Veronese, and Tintoret, under which
were placed a number of ancient and valuable busts, particularly
those of the Emperors Trajan, Otho, Tibullus, and Augustus
Caesar.</p>

<p>They then descended the marble staircase, and proceeded through a
long vaulted passage, which led immediately to the great hall. Here a
scene of wonders was presented to the astonished eyes of Laurette; it
was spacious and of vast extent; the floor was of marble; the walls,
in which were several recesses, were painted in fresco; the ceiling,
exhibiting a scene from the Odyssey of Homer, was supported by twenty
composite pillars, whose bandelets were of silver; the recesses were
adorned with statues from the antique of granite, porphyry, and
parian marble.</p>

<p>At the upper end of the hall was erected a stately organ, composed
of ebony, beautifully inlaid with ivory, and decorated with a variety
of ornaments. The curtain was of purple satin, fringed and drawn up
with tassels of gold; the pipes and pedals were of silver, and the
upper keys of the finest ivory.</p>

<p>The Signora having opened it, touched a few simple notes; the
tones were full and harmonious, and the effect was heightened by
echo. Laurette, to whom this instrument was new, requested that she
would favour her with a song; to this she immediately assented, and
taking a place at the organ, played and sung the following air:</p>

<pre>
THE SYLPH

A RONDEAU

From your wild aerial pleasures.
Sister spirits, haste away.
Join the dance, in frolic measures.
'Mid dark woods, in shadows grey.
On the zephyrs' pinion sailing
Swift we'll cleave the ambient air.
Catch the od'rous sweets, exhaling
From each herb and flow'ret fair.
Now our wild course earthward bending.
Where the sportive sun-beams play;
On the viewless winds descending
Through the silvery floods of day.
'Mid deep shades and glens advancing.
Where sequester'd mortals dwell.
Round the purple orchis dancing.
Or the lily's pendant bell.
From your wild aerial pleasures.
Sister Spirits, haste away.
Join the dance in frolic measures.
'Mid dark woods, in shadows grey.
</pre>

<p>Laurette having complimented the Signora upon a performance that
discovered much taste and judgment, was conducted by her into the
saloons, and other magnificent rooms in the castle, which were
adorned with a profusion of rare and valuable pictures by the most
celebrated of the Italian painters, and some that exhibited the bold
and masterly strokes of the Roman pencil.</p>

<p>All here appeared like the work of enchantment; the windows,
descending to the floors, opened into balconies, in which were placed
vases containing roses, myrtle, and Amaranthus that distilled
delicious fragrance; beyond these the most gay and beautiful
parterres, lawns, groves, and winding streams, being aided by the
natural grandeur of the scenery, presented to the eye of the
enthusiast a combination of beauties which Fancy herself could not so
successfully have delineated.</p>

<p>From the principal saloon they proceeded through a glass door,
which opened into the pleasure-ground. Here our lovely heroine, whose
astonishment could be only equalled by her admiration, was conducted
to several grottos, cascades, and beautiful declivities, where so
little method was observed by the artist, that they appeared like the
work of Nature when in one of her most wild and fanciful moods.</p>

<p>The timidity natural to minds of quick and delicate perception,
which had hitherto repressed the communication of sentiment, now
imperceptibly yielded to reciprocal affection; and the Signora,
ardently desirous of exciting an interest in the heart of her young
and amiable guest, began to relate several incidents of her past
life, endeavouring by her example to betray her into a similar and
mutual confidence.</p>

<p>Laurette listened with attention; and some symptoms of curiosity
appearing in her looks, the Signora continued.</p>

<p>'My life, which has been hitherto almost invariably marked with
ill-fortune, can boast no great variety of incident; yet, though my
story is uniformly sad, it may not be altogether uninteresting; and a
mind that has been taught by reflection to think and to feel, will
not contemplate the misfortunes I have endured without an emotion of
pity.'</p>

<p>Laurette, to whom the latter part of this discourse was
particularly addressed, bowed gracefully; and still more desirous of
being acquainted with a story, which though its prelude promised
little to entertain, yet much to interest, besought her to
proceed.</p>

<p>The Signora hesitated some moments, as if to recollect or to
arrange some circumstances of her narrative, and then began as
follows.</p>

The beauteous maid that bids the world adieu
Oft of that world will snatch a fond review.
Oft at the shrine neglect her beads, to trace
Some social scene, some dear familiar face.
Forgot when first a father's stern controul
Chas'd the gay visions of her op'ning soul;
And e'er with iron-tongue the vesper-bell.
Bursts thro' the cyprus walk, the convent cell
Oft will her warm and wayward heart revive.
To love and joy still tremblingly alive.
--ROGERS
</pre>

<p>'My father, whose name was Ruberto, was lineally descended from a
younger branch of the noble and once honourable house of Manini. The
misfortunes of this family, which are well known, rendered it
necessary for my grandfather, the unhappy victim of Court intrigue,
to take refuge in obscurity. When the policy of this measure first
appeared, he felt the severity of his fortunes with the keenest
energy. To be compelled to quit his paternal inheritance in Naples,
long the residence of his ancestors, was to him dreadful as a
Siberian banishment; yet no alternative remained, and after many
struggles, too powerful to be immediately overcome, he repaired with
his wife, who was also a person of high birth and a numerous family,
of which my father was the eldest, to a chateau on the borders of
France.</p>

<p>'Thus trained in obscurity, and disguised under an assumed name,
the children of the unfortunate Manini were deprived of the
advantages of birth, though not of education, as my grandfather
instructed them in the learned languages, and other branches of
literature, with unceasing attention; but at the same time that he
assisted them in classical acquirements, he instilled into them
principles that were at enmity with the social virtues.</p>

<p>'After some years, a political revolution occasioned a change of
circumstances; and my grandfather, whose character was finally
cleared from the false aspersions of his enemies, returned once more
to his paternal seat, and was restored to his former dignities. This
sudden transition from disgrace to favour, from obscurity to
comparative splendour, wrought so violent an effect upon his mind,
that he, who could once think nobly, and act vigorously, now became
weak, vain, and luxurious, a slave to passions he once boldly
resisted, and to vices which he felt no longer an inclination to
oppose. He believed, because he had met with some insincerity where
he had the least expected it, that all were vicious and ungrateful.
With this conviction he renounced all former friendships, he rather
wished to excite envy than esteem, and as the most effectual way of
attracting the observation of the multitude, enlarged his mansion,
and increased his household.</p>

<p>'One expence naturally led to another, till his fortune, his
peace, and the future prospects of his children were eventually
sacrificed. In a few years this unfortunate and misguided courtier
died insolvent; his widow did not long survive him; his three sons
were provided for in the army, and his daughters forced into a
convent, that the family might not be disgraced by inferior
alliances.</p>

<p>'My father was united, early in life, to a woman, elegant in her
manners, and amiable in her disposition. She was beautiful, but
beauty was her least perfection, for she possessed, in an eminent
degree, all those virtues and graces by which the female character is
adorned and dignified;--she was a native of Italy, and an only child;
her fortune was small, but her family respectable. Her parents dying
in her minority, left their fair daughter to the guardianship of an
uncle, who was distantly related to my father, which led to the
connection that afterwards formed all the happiness and misery of
their future lives.</p>

<p>'Soon after this marriage, which took place a short time after the
commencement of the acquaintance, my father's regiment being called
into action for the purpose of quelling a rebel troop of Condottieri,
he was necessitated to leave Mantua that he might join a detachment
in a distant part of the province, who were in readiness to march
against the foe.</p>

<p>'During this state of separation, which was equally afflictive to
both, my mother remained under the protection of Signor Montefico,
her uncle and former guardian, at his residence, which was a small
but elegant villa on the banks of the Po. My birth rapidly succeeded
this event, and my mother's attention was now entirely confined to
the care and education of her daughter; so much so that she seldom
quitted her solitude, and seemed to be insensible to every pleasure
or amusement but what I was empowered to bestow.</p>

<p>'Several years passed before the return of my father; and a report
of his death being circulated, which his unusual silence tended to
confirm, my mother resigned herself for some time to unavailing
grief; but recollecting the defenceless situation of her child, she
exerted herself to endure what could not be remedied, and in time
regained some portion of her former tranquillity.</p>

<p>'As no doubt remained concerning the truth of the report, she
assumed the dress of a widow, and with redoubled assiduity dedicated
her time and her thoughts to my instruction and improvement.</p>

<p>'But the serenity she had acquired was soon afterwards disturbed
by the death of Signor Montefico, who expired suddenly in a fit,
without having received the benefit of the sacrament, or the other
customary solemnities of the church. As he died without a will, his
property, which would otherwise have been my mother's, descended to
the male heir.</p>

<p>'Poverty, and other accumulated distresses, now threatened to
destroy the small remains of comfort which had hitherto been
afforded; but my mother, who possessed firmness sufficient to
withstand the severest attacks of misfortune, did not suffer herself
to sink under them; but having followed her venerable protector to
the grave, and paid every mark of respect to his memory which
pecuniary embarrassments would permit her to bestow, she prepared to
quit the villa Santieri, which had been her home almost from infancy,
and to repair to the interior of the city. But she was prevented from
putting her design immediately in execution by the arrival of Signor
Gualando, the rightful heir to the estates of her deceased friend,
who came to assert his claim to the personal, as well as landed,
property of Signor Montefico.</p>

<p>'Something relative to the arrangement of his affairs rendered
frequent conversations with my mother indispensible, previous to her
quitting the villa. She was too beautiful not to attract his
admiration, and too amiable not to ensure his esteem. The soft
melancholy that pervaded her features, the easy dignity of her
figure, and the winning graces of her manners, inspired the most
lively sentiment in her favour.</p>

<p>'He felt that he loved her, but that love was so tempered with
esteem that it was long before delicacy allowed an avowal of his
passion.</p>

<p>'At first he steadily opposed our leaving the villa, having no
intention of continuing there himself, as he possessed a considerable
estate, independent of this, in the neighbourhood of Pisa, the
present residence of his family. But my mother strictly adhered to
her first resolution, and soon afterwards, agreeable to her original
intention, removed into the city.</p>

<p>'She was frequently visited in her new abode by Signor Gualando,
whom necessary business detained some time in Mantua, who finally
made her an offer of his person and fortune.</p>

<p>'Though my mother had no remaining doubt concerning her widowhood,
she prudently declined the proposal, having already formed a
resolution never to enter into a second engagement.</p>

<p>'The disappointment and uneasiness which a knowledge of this
determination inflicted upon the Signor, cannot easily be described;
not only his spirits, but his health, seemed to yield to the force of
his attachment, which was too serious to allow him to relinquish the
pursuit, and too ardent not to expose him to real distress. Yet not
absolutely despairing of success, he ventured to continue his visits
under the sanction of friendship, and was meditating on the most
effectual method of insinuating himself into the affections of the
beautiful widow, as she was generally called, when the unexpected
return of my father, who had been confined five years in a fortress
by the forces of the triumphant Condottieri, terminated all his
future hopes.</p>

<p>'The Signor Gualando was alone with my mother on his arrival, and,
in the attitude of intreaty, was pressing his suit with all the
eloquence of an inviolable regard, when my father, whom no motive of
prudence could restrain from precipitating himself into the presence
of his wife, burst into the room.</p>

<p>'The rapturous surprise experienced by my mother when she beheld
the long lost object of her affections, whose imaginary death she had
so long and so tenderly lamented, can better be conceived than
described. My father was sensible to the first impulse of joy, but
far different emotions succeeded. From this moment his mind became a
prey to violent and contending passions, which reason could neither
bridle nor subdue. In the Signor Gualando he believed he beheld the
favoured lover of his wife, to whom, supposing herself at liberty,
she would shortly have been united, had not his unexpected and
unhoped--for return rendered it impracticable. Though, from the
natural expressions of transport which were portrayed in the
countenance of my mother, and the innocent effusions of unfeigned
rapture that succeeded, a mind collected and unimpassioned would have
decided otherwise; yet too much was he blinded by an excess of
jealousy to be enabled to observe the one, or to feel the just value
of the other.</p>

<p>'From this aera a gloomy reserve characterised his deportment
towards his wife, which no effort of tenderness, on her part, could
soften or dispel; though she cautiously avoided giving him any cause
of suspicion, by abstracting herself from society, and devoting every
moment of her time to domestic duties.</p>

<p>'Signor Gualando, in the mean time, suffered all the chagrin and
mental uneasiness which love and disappointment could inflict. He saw
the necessity of tearing himself from the object of his regard, and
of combatting these feelings by the most strenuous exertions in his
power; and, after repeated conflicts with himself, was enabled to put
his prudent resolutions into practice, and returned to his former
abode.</p>

<p>'The behaviour of my father, which was alternately sullen and
severe, was so injurious to the peace of my mother, that her natural
vivacity disappeared, and her health rapidly declined. Her cruel
companion beheld this change without either pity or remorse; he
imputed it to chagrin for the loss of her lover, not to his unmerited
severity; and this reflection, as distressing as it was unjust,
marked his appearance and manners with increasing asperity.</p>

<p>'In a short time this patient victim of groundless and
unjustifiable resentment, was removed from a state of sufferance and
oppression to receive the reward of uncorrupted innocence; and left
him, who was insensible of her value when living, to feel and lament
her loss.</p>

<p>'As at this period I was not more than twelve years of age, my
father, who had no female relation living, was for some time
irresolute in what manner to dispose of me. At length he determined
to board me in a convent of Celestinas, which was about a league and
a half from Mantua, whither he promised to convey me at the
expiration of the time which he had fixed.</p>

<p>'That boundless love of variety, which is inseparable from youth
and inexperience, made me readily agree to the proposal; and my
father having previously entered into a contract with the Superior to
admit me as a boarder, I was conducted by him to the convent.</p>

<p>'The Lady Abbess received me with a stately kind of politeness but
little adapted to my sentiments or my years; and the nuns eyed me
with a kind of eager curiosity, which, young as I was, filled me with
confusion and displeasure.</p>

<p>'When my father had left me, which he appeared to do with little
regret, I felt the forlornness of my situation with redoubled energy.
I seemed to have awakened to a new state of existence, and to be
placed among beings of another order, which made it long before I was
sufficiently reconciled to my new abode to be able to enumerate its
comforts.</p>

<p>'But as the mind naturally submits to necessity, and endeavours to
accommodate itself to those circumstances that are unavoidable, in
time I became tranquil and even gay; though I believe my satisfaction
chiefly arose from the too sanguine expectations I had indulged of
the future, when, being liberated from confinement, I should be
restored to society.</p>

<p>'With these hopes, which I conceived were shortly to be realized,
the hours fled rapidly away, and having no idea of continuing in the
convent longer than the time proposed, I felt the tenderest pity and
commiseration for those whom pride, bigotry, or other adverse
circumstances had condemned to perpetual retirement.</p>

<p>'Many of the sisters were young, and some of them were extremely
lovely. The dress of the order, which consisted of a loose white robe
simply confined at the bosom, and ornamented with a blue cloak, and
scapulary of the same colour, added grace to beauty; and had they not
been characterized by a certain air of discontent and dejection, they
would have appeared infinitely charming. But few had voluntarily
resigned themselves to a conventual life, and the hopelessness of
their situations was a source of continual dissatisfaction and
regret.</p>

<p>'Whenever I contemplated features whose harmony and expression, if
lighted up by the animated smile of contentment and benevolence,
would have possessed undescribable powers of attraction, I mingled a
degree of silent indignation with my pity at the violated rights of
human nature, at once trampled on and overborne by creatures, formed
and endued with so many delicate and exalted affections. Can it be
the will of heaven, thought I, that beings, who are endeared to each
other by so many tender connections, should embrace a system which is
unquestionably subversive of all the ties of humanity? Is it virtue
to fly from the possibility of exercising those amiable principles
which are implanted in our natures for the noblest purposes, and to
relinquish those innocent sources of amusement and delight, that are
bountifully bestowed upon us to give value to our existence? It
cannot be--we are assuredly designed to be the mutual support and
comfort of each other; and as by mixing with the world our sphere of
action is enlarged, it is indisputably our duty to continue in
it.</p>

<p>'But pardon me, Madame,' continued the Signora, 'I confess I have
been guilty of an egotism, and am now amusing you rather with
sentiment than narrative; but I will resume my story, and conclude it
as briefly as possible.'</p>

<p>Laurette replied only with a smile, and the Signora proceeded.</p>

<p>'Two years had elapsed before my father again visited the convent,
who I now believed was come to obtain my dismission. But what were my
feelings when he acquainted me with his determination, which was,
that I was to remain in the convent, and immediately to take the veil
as a novice! My anguish was now too acute to be concealed, and,
throwing myself at his feet, I besought him not to doom me to eternal
regret--not to exclude me from the blessings of nature, but to allow
me to return with him.</p>

<p>'The sternness that was gathering on his brow convinced me that I
had nothing to hope; and the peremptory tone in which his former
resolution was repeated, terrified me into silence; and knowing that
resistance would be in vain, and being fearful of exasperating him
with a refusal, I appeared to acquiesce. When he left me, his
countenance somewhat relaxed from its severity; and after an
assurance that he would see me again before the ceremony was
performed, he quitted the convent.</p>

<p>'The recollection of my sufferings when I was apprized of my
unalterable destiny, returns, even at this distant period, forcibly
to my thoughts, and brings with it a train of correspondent ideas. At
one time I resolved to disobey, and to purchase liberty at the
expense of duty and every moral obligation; at another, to submit
patiently to what was unavoidable, and to endeavour, at least, to
alleviate the sense of my uneasiness with the rectitude of my
conduct.</p>

<p>'Had persuasion been used instead of those arbitrary means which
had been adopted, and had that persuasion been directed by reason, I
could have yielded myself a sacrifice, however painful the task; but
as no motive could be alledged to justify measures so repugnant to my
inclinations, they appeared so despotic and capricious that I could
neither reconcile them to my feelings or my understanding.</p>

<p>'The stately distance that was uniformly preserved by the Abbess,
precluded the possibility of winning her over to my interest; and
though I more than once determined to solicit her interference in my
behalf, her looks, her voice, and her manners were sufficient to awe
me into silence.</p>

<p>'Some of the sisters apparently pitied my situation, whilst others
secretly triumphed in my disappointment; for there were some that,
though trained to habits of hourly devotion, were destitute of
sensibility and every amiable principle of the mind.</p>

<p>'It was on the eve of the vigil of San Marco that my father again
repeated his visit, and as it is usual at this festival for nuns to
be professed, I naturally imagined that he had received some previous
intimation of it from the Superior, and was come at once to enforce
and to witness my vows.</p>

<p>'No powers of language can do justice to my feelings at that
moment; for though as a novice I was not absolutely a prisoner for
life, yet placing but little confidence in the paternal tenderness of
my father, and being perfectly aware of the watchfulness of the Lady
Abbess, any successful attempt of effectuating an escape from
captivity would, I knew, be impracticable, before the expiration of
the year, when the other veil would follow of course. Thus situated,
I resolved, though with no sanguine hopes of success, to soften, if
possible, the native ferocity of my father's temper; and, if every
spark of affection was not entirely extinguished in his breast, to
strive to rekindle and call it into action.</p>

<p>'As soon as I was admitted into his presence, which was not till
the Abbess had retired, I endeavoured to execute my intention by
appealing to his compassion; and, contrary to my expectation, he
heard me with complacency;--and whether it was my altered looks, for
my complexion was much faded by sorrow, or the result of a previous
conversation with the Superior, that occasioned it, I was unable to
ascertain; but, after fixing his eyes upon mine, which were streaming
with tears, with an expression of earnestness not unmingled with
pity, after a few gentle reproaches he granted me his permission to
accompany him home, and to remain resident there till my health was
re-established; though he took some pains to convince mc that his
former resolution was unchanged; but in compliance with my
unjustifiable prejudices, as he termed it, he would grant me the
indulgence of postponing the performance of it till another
opportunity.</p>

<p>'Even this indulgence, though not augmented by a promise of its
permanency, so much exceeded my expectation, that, in the ecstatic
emotions of the moment, I loaded him with the effusions of my
gratitude; and having yielded to the intreaties of the Abbess to wait
the celebration of the festival, which was crowded with friars,
pilgrims, and other professed devotees, we quitted this religious
asylum, whose massy walls and solitary cells heard only the sigh of
regret and the groan of mental anguish, and repaired to Mantua.</p>

<p>'As I gazed upon the venerable spires of the convent retiring into
distance, which were half lost amid the rocks that surrounded them, I
secretly determined not to enter it again, since I believed that
misery and confinement were inseparable.</p>

<p>'Every object which I regarded, and every sound that I heard, had
now the advantage of novelty; the hills covered with verdure, the
flowers that embroidered the valleys, the low warblings of the birds
from the deep shade of the woods, all were in unison with my
feelings, and I felt as if just called into existence to enjoy the
sublimities of nature. With the vanity inseparable from youth and
inexperience, I anticipated the pleasures of society, anxious to
display the few accomplishments I had acquired, and to be convinced
of their value.</p>

<p>'My solicitude to please being frequently carried to excess, my
father did not fail to observe, with concern, a propensity that
threatened to render his favourite scheme of professing me abortive.
This induced him resolutely to oppose my mixing with the world, which
he constantly represented as teeming with misfortune, folly, and
insincerity.</p>

<p>'The only persons who were in habits of intimacy in the family,
were Father Alberto, a Jesuit, who was my father's Confessor; Signor
Lamberto, a man of fortune and connections resident in Mautna, and
Lorenzo d'Orfo, a young officer, who was committed to his care by his
last surviving parent, a short time before his death, which happened
in consequence of a wound received in a desperate engagement, a few
months after he had been raised by merit to the rank of Mareschal,
not without some hopes that a future provision might be the effect of
this politic arrangement, should this veteran, who had lately retired
from the toil and uncertainty inseparable from a military life,
continue single, or die without heirs.</p>

<p>'Signor Lamberto was not so rigid in his principles as my father,
and being informed of the decided aversion I had expressed to the
solitude of a cloister, and of his inexorable determination to oblige
me to take the vow, used some arguments to dissuade him from his
purpose. But they were overruled by the more powerful ones urged by
the Jesuit, who was my father's friend and adviser on every occasion,
and who contrived, from interested motives, to convince him that his
eternal salvation depended upon the sacrifice of his daughter; who,
if allowed to remain with him, would so far influence his affections
as to withdraw them from the only true source of all consolation.</p>

<p>'To be continually in the society of the Signor d'Orfo without
feeling a prepossession in his favour, would have been impossible.
His manners were easy and elegant, his figure was more than
ordinarily graceful, and his countenance expressive of a certain
ingenuousness of mind, which could not be contemplated without
affection. I had not been many weeks in the city before we mutually
felt and acknowledged our attachment, though it was necessary to
conceal it from my father, his Confessor, and even from Signor
Lamberto; who, was every objection to be removed on the part of my
friends, would, we had every reason to believe, vigorously oppose an
alliance which, in the indigent situation of his dependant, could not
be justified by prudence. But though we attempted to disguise our
affection under an assumed appearance of indifference, we were so
narrowly watched by the scrutinizing eyes of the Jesuit, who
contrived to overhear our conversation when we imagined ourselves in
secrecy, that my father was early apprized of it.</p>

<p>'Perfectly aware of the extent of my punishment, and more than
ever averse to a conventual life, which would inevitably separate me
for ever from the amiable object of my early love, I at last
consented to accept the protection of Signor d'Orfo, and to unite my
destiny with his.</p>

<p>'My father, in the mean time, placing no confidence in the dutiful
acquiescence of his daughter, probably from a consciousness that he
had never deserved it, resolved to accelerate my departure, as the
most effectual method of preventing any future intercourse between
us, and desired me to prepare to accompany him to the convent on the
following week; at the same time commanding me not to quit my
apartment during the interval, on pain of his everlasting
displeasure.</p>

<p>'Thus secluded from the possibility of obtaining another interview
with Lorenzo, I abandoned myself to despair; and since, in the
despondency of the moment, I believed the fate that awaited me was
irreversible, wished, for the first time, that I had never quitted my
prison, since I should now return to it with redoubled
reluctance.</p>

<p>'By means of a confidential servant, a method of informing the
Signor of my confinement was with some difficulty effected; who I
discovered by a letter, which was immediately conveyed, was actually
meditating my escape.</p>

<p>'This, by the assistance of the domestics, who were bribed to our
interests, notwithstanding the vigilance of my father and his
Jesuitical Confessor, was finally accomplished: a ladder of ropes was
placed beneath the window of my apartment, which I unreluctantly
descended, and a vehicle being stationed at a convenient distance
from the mansion, I placed myself in it, without asking whither I was
going, and was conveyed rapidly away.</p>

<p>'It was the intention of the Signor to take a cross-road, lest a
premature alarm might occasion pursuit, and to alight at one of the
monasteries in the road, where a priest might be procured, and the
ceremony be performed.</p>

<p>'It was long past midnight when we commenced our journey; but the
moon shining with unclouded radiance, enabled us to prosecute it with
speed, till her light became gradually pale, and the grey mists of
the morning rose slowly upon the summits of the hills.</p>

<p>'Having arrived at a lonely and apparently deserted village,
situated at the foot of a mountain, we enquired for the nearest
convent, and was directed to one about a league from the place.</p>

<p>'Here we arrived when the Monks were returning from matins. It was
a society of Augustines, and having engaged a Friar of the Order to
officiate, the marriage was solemnized.</p>

<p>'As we had no fixed residence to return to, nor any friend or
relation to receive us, we mutually agreed to drive on to the next
town that could offer us accommodation, and to remain there till we
could fix upon some plan for our future conduct.</p>

<p>'Here we arrived early in the day; and as soon as my scattered
thoughts were somewhat collected, I wrote to my father, at once to
solicit his forgiveness and his patronage. Lorenzo also wrote to
Signor Lamberto, but our letters were disregarded; another and
another were written, but without success; and having no hopes of
obtaining the attention we requested, we determined to relinquish the
pursuit.</p>

<p>'Near a month elapsed in this situation, when Lorenzo received
orders to join his regiment, that was stationed in a remote province,
whither, after some little preparation, I accompanied him.</p>

<p>'The journey was accomplished with little fatigue; and soon
afterwards we had the satisfaction of being placed in a state of
security and comfort, in which we experienced all the happiness that
life could bestow. Our circumstances were indeed limited, but we
managed so as to make not only a decent, but a respectable
appearance, and might be said to be rich in each other's
affection.</p>

<p>'Some years had passed in unclouded tranquillity, without any
interesting event, except the birth of a son, who bore the name as
well as the resemblance of his father, but of whom death early
deprived me. Scarcely was I recovered from the indisposition this
loss had occasioned, before our regiment was ordered into another
part of the kingdom, to secure it from the invasion of the enemy,
which obliged us to remove with all possible speed.</p>

<p>'Alas! I knew not then it was destined to become the seat of war,
and being anxious to recover my spirits, exulted in the variety a
change of situation would afford.</p>

<p>'But not to weary you with too long a detail, the regiment was
soon afterwards engaged in a close action, and Lorenzo d'Orfo
fell!</p>

<p>'Gracious heaven! what were my sufferings at that dreadful moment
when I was informed that he was amongst the numbers of the fallen;
though, to soften the intelligence, I was told he was only wounded.
Frantic with despair, I flew into the field with the wildness of
distraction, though it was night, and I had no one but a servant to
attend me thither. After examining for a considerable time the
mangled forms of the vanquished; which were so covered with blood as
to render the features scarcely perceptible, I discovered the object
of my search. But he was dead; the breath seemed newly to have
forsaken the body, and his limbs were not yet stiff in death.</p>

<p>'In an agony, not to be described, I pressed him to my heart; and
it was long before the people, whom my cries had attracted, could
tear me from the place. A fever and delirium succeeded, which brought
me to the brink of the grave; but the natural goodness of my
constitution finally resisting the attack, I was gradually
restored.</p>

<p>'As soon as the disorder of my mind was in some degree removed, I
formed a resolution of returning to Mantua, for the purpose of
soliciting the protection of my father, who, I now believed, would
receive me with compassion and affection. When the physician who
attended me, pronounced me able to travel without endangering my
safety, I availed myself of his permission, and soon put my design
into execution.</p>

<p>'After a few days' journey, which was performed with less fatigue
than was expected, I arrived within the territories of Naples, and
from thence proceeded, by easy stages, to Mantua.</p>

<p>'Here I learned, to my inexpressible grief and disappointment,
that my father had been dead some time; and, on extending my
enquiries concerning the disposal of his property, was informed that
he had bequeathed the whole of it, which was indeed nothing very
considerable, to the Jesuit, his Confessor.</p>

<p>'Having now no other means of subsistence than what my own
exertions could procure, I had recourse to the embroidering of silks,
to supply the convents and principal nobility of the place; which,
from some skill in the art, more than supplied me with the actual
necessaries of life.</p>

<p>'Near two years had elapsed without any incident worthy of
attention, when a cessation of hostilities, which was somewhat
suddenly effected, occasioned a visit from the Marchese de Martilini;
who, having been acquainted with my misfortunes, and the injustice of
my father, requested my acceptance of a sum sufficient to elevate me
above want and dependance. This, knowing the exalted character of the
bestower, I gratefully accepted; and, on the death of the Marchese de
Montferrat, which happened some years after this event, consented, at
the request of my patron, to accept of this situation, till one more
eligible could be procured. Here I hope, in the capacity of Casiera:
to enjoy at least peace and tranquillity.</p>

<p>'I have not at present been introduced to the Marchese de
Montferrat; but as the castle will soon be in readiness for his
reception, it is not probable that he will continue much longer in
Italy. He has already honoured me with two letters respecting the
repairs, and the disposal of the pictures, statues, vases, and other
ornamental effects, in which he has discovered much taste and
sentiment.</p>

<p>'In his last letter he mentioned a young person of the name of
Laurette, who was shortly to be placed under my protection, with
whose person, he added, he was yet unacquainted, though he had
maintained and patronized her from infancy. This, I acknowledge,
excited my curiosity, and instigated me to extend my enquiries among
the servants, from whom I could gain no satisfactory intelligence
upon the subject.'</p>

<p>Here the Signora was silent; and Laurette, who had listened with a
painful interest to this brief yet mournful narrative, in return for
such unlimited confidence, proceeded to inform her new friend of some
particulars relative to herself. The incidents of her life were few
and simple; but the tone and manner in which they were delivered, and
the tears that accompanied the recollection of infantine felicity,
gave importance to the most trivial event, and won the esteem of her
auditor.</p>

<p>When she arrived at that part of her story which treated of the
sudden departure of her more than parent, the attention of the
Signora was fixed in astonishment; and when the name of Enrico
escaped her lips, the blush that suffused her cheeks, and the
tremulous accent in which the words were delivered, declared how
tenderly she was interested in his concerns, and breathed more than
sisterly affection.</p>

<p>The Signora, who observed these emotions with the most refined
compassion, endeavoured to console her with an assurance that she
would make some immediate enquiries respecting the fate of the young
chevalier, desiring her at the same time to look up and be comforted;
not to give way to causeless suggestions, but to continue to rely on
the protection of that Supreme Power, which she had never wilfully
offended, and who consequently would never abandon her.</p>

<p>Those who know what it is to suffer, and to have those sufferings
alleviated by the sympathy of friendship, will conceive the
delightful sensation that was imparted to the bosom of Laurette in
thus finding, contrary to her expectation, a person inclined to
bestow that consolation which her present feelings required, in a
stile the most grateful to her heart, and in whom, from what had
recently passed, she had reason to believe she might entirely
confide.</p>

<p>The only part of her narrative which Laurette had concealed, was
the extraordinary appearance and behaviour of the mysterious Monk,
with the delivery of the picture. This circumstance she had strictly
promised to conceal; and though it returned frequently and forcibly
to her thoughts, accompanied with the most dreadful presages, she
resolved, agreeably to the solemn vow she had taken in the presence
of the father, never to disclose it.</p>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>

<pre>
Oft at the silent shadowy close of day.
When the tir'd grove has sung its parting lay.
When pensive Twilight, in her dusky car.
Comes slowly on to meet the evening star.
Above, below, aerial murmurs swell.
From hanging wood, brown heath, and bushy dell.
A thousand nameless rills, that shun the sight.
Stealing soft music on the ear of Night;
So oft the finer movements of the soul.
That shun the sphere of Pleasure's gay controul.
In the still shades of calm Seclusion rise.
And breathe their sweet seraphic harmonies.
--ROGERS
</pre>

<p>Laurette had not been long resident in the castle of Lunenburg,
before Paoli received an order from the Marchese to hasten his return
into Italy; who having made some necessary arrangements, and given
general orders to the Signora, prepared to depart.</p>

<p>His attention was so wholly directed to the business of rendering
the mansion a fit residence for his Lord, and he so seldom obtruded
himself into the presence of the ladies, that Laurette was scarcely
conscious that he was an inhabitant of the place. When he entered the
saloon to bid them adieu, being anxious to know when Doroth&eacute;e
and Lisette were to be conveyed thither, she ventured to follow him
through the hall to make some enquiries concerning them, and was
informed, to her inexpressible uneasiness, that they were already
discharged; the Marchese having recently given orders for none of her
former domestics to attend her.</p>

<p>There was something in this circumstance so unkind, as well as
capricious, that had not her mind been occupied by nearer interests,
she would have felt severely the having been once flattered by
assurances which were probably never intended to be realized.</p>

<p>Though hope, the usual attendant on youth and inexperience,
sometimes brightened the future prospects of our heroine, she often
yielded to despondency; and though grateful for the comforts her
present situation afforded, which exceeded her most sanguine
expectations, she did not cease to reflect upon the past with the
most poignant regret and anxiety.</p>

<p>The picture, which was delivered by the Monk, she wore continually
in her bosom, carefully concealing it from observation, according to
her promise, and secretly cherishing it as an invaluable relic,
consecrated by the solemn manner in which it was bestowed and
endeared as being the portrait of her mother.</p>

<p>Though the conversation of the Signora d'Orfo, which was at once
animated and interesting, excited in the gentle mind of Laurette the
most lively emotions of gratitude, the exertion which was requisite
of wearing the aspect of cheerfulness, was often times painful, which
occasioned her to seize every opportunity of abstracting herself from
the rest of the family, when it could be done without a breach of
propriety, that she might wander alone through the grounds attached
to the castle, which were not more beautiful than extensive.</p>

<p>One evening, when the Signora was engaged in giving directions to
the persons employed in the repairs, concerning the ornamental parts
of the workmanship, Laurette was induced by the fineness of the
weather to ramble in an adjacent forest; and having reached a distant
part of it, seated herself upon a gentle eminence, to enjoy the
prospect it commanded. The evening was serene and cloudless--no
sound, except the song of the nightingale that was warbling its last
farewell, or the soft note of a far distant oboe, broke upon the
calmness that prevailed. These tended to recall to her memory the
imagery of the past, and, absorbed in tender reflections, she paused
till every sound was hushed, till even the night bird had forsaken
his accustomed haunts, and all was silence and repose.</p>

<p>Her mind was now tenderly susceptible of the finest impressions,
and the melancholy stillness that pervaded the woods, only
occasionally agitated by the last sigh of the zephyr, aided the
poetic enthusiasm that was stealing upon her spirits, and resigning
herself to the luxury of sadly pleasing emotions, she composed the
following lines:</p>

<pre>
AN ELEGY

ON THE CLOSE OF THE YEAR

Where are the wreaths that Spring's young fingers wove.
Each op'ning bud, which she had gemm'd with dew;
Hypaticas that blush'd in every grove.
The heath flower, and the violet meekly blue.
No more beneath the woodbine's trembling shade.
Peeps the wan primrose from its silken cell;
No more the wild rose blooms along the glade.
Or modest cowslip hangs her golden bell;
Yet though no shrubs the Alpine steeps adorn.
Though Spring and Summer's smiling reign be past.
I love to linger in these shades forlorn.
And listen to the rude Autumnal blast.
And chief, when Evening hangs her glooms profound
On every pine-clad hill and valley fair;
When the noctule begins his nightly round.
In mazy circles, through the liquid air;
Then oft I climb some mountain's hoary side.
Whose craggy base the silent water laves.
And mark the wand'ring Naiades, as they glide
To meet the Sea Nymphs in their coral caves;
Or seek the moss-grown cavern's inmost dell.
The tangl'd wood walk, or the forest drear;
Where, as soft, dying gales at distance swell.
Methinks the Spirit of the rock I hear.
And when meek Eve, with matron step retires
With humid tresses newly bath'd in dews;
Then Fancy visionary dreams inspires.
Veiling each object in unreal hues.
Her magic wand bids fairy forms advance.
Forms that have slept in lily bells the day.
In frolic wild to celebrate the dance.
Beneath the silver moon-beam's trembling ray;
To keep their vigils far from mortal ken.
By side of fringed brook, or shadowy glade.
Or in some rushy cavern's hallow'd glen.
Till Day's bright orb the realms of Night pervade.
Then swift they fly, nor can e'en Fancy's power.
With all her magic spells, prolong their stay.
Till Cynthia's train leads on the silent hour.
And Night's sad minstrel tunes his parting lay.
Ah! so, before cold Reason's sober gaze.
Youth's fairy visions fade and disappear;
Dark Winter thus her chilling form displays.
Blasting the produce of the blooming year.
Yet Spring again shall dress her groves with flow'rs.
Perfum'd and tinted by a hand divine;
And Music's voice delight the laughing hours;
But when will happiness again be mine?
</pre>

<p>The deepening shades of the evening at length reminded her of her
distance from the castle, and that she had a long and lonely
wilderness to pass, which made it necessary for her to return with
all possible speed to the path she had quitted, which was the direct
road to the mansion, before it was too dark to be able to distinguish
the way.</p>

<p>When she had reached the gate that marked the boundaries of the
pleasure grounds, being nearly exhausted with fatigue, she paused for
a moment to recover herself, and as she was now well acquainted with
the road, to take a survey of the beautiful range of hills that
bounded the horizon, and the rich, though half-foliated woods that
skirted the mountains.</p>

<p>Lost in the contemplation of these picturesque objects, she
proceeded leisurely along till having imperceptibly arrived at the
vista, which opened upon the lawn, her attention was recalled from
the illusions of fancy, to whose captivating power she had resigned
herself, by the voices of two people, apparently in earnest
discourse, but whose persons were concealed amid the trees of the
avenue.</p>

<p>In the direction she had taken it was probable she must have
passed very near to them; but they were too much engaged in their own
concerns to perceive her approach, and the grass preventing her
footsteps from being heard, as she moved lightly beneath the shade of
the trees, occasioned their being unconscious of any observer.</p>

<p>It naturally occurred to her, that they were some of the servants
belonging to the castle; but, lest strangers might have intruded
themselves into these extensive domains, she emerged precipitately
from the gloom of the avenues, and bounded swiftly over the lawn.</p>

<p>In a moment she heard steps pursuing her, and before she had
recovered from her alarm, the sound of her own name, uttered by a
well-known voice, drew her attention upon the person who pronounced
it. Turning hastily around, she beheld, to her astonishment, a young
chevalier in a military habit, who immediately came up to her; and,
before she was restored to recollection, found herself in the arms of
a stranger, in whom she afterwards recognized the person of
Enrico.</p>

<p>Surprise and joy operated so powerfully upon her feelings, that
she was near fainting; which made it some time before she was
conscious of her situation, or of the extent of her happiness.</p>

<p>When amazement had in some degree subsided, Laurette fixed her
eyes upon Enrico with an earnest and tender gaze, and, as the partial
beams of the moon fell upon his face, observed that he looked
unusually pale, and that his once animated features wore an
expression of deep dejection, which it was not difficult to
interpret.</p>

<p>As soon as she had courage to introduce the subject, which had
been productive of so much uneasiness, she ventured to ask if he had
received the letter containing the melancholy intelligence respecting
Madame Chamont, and what had occasioned his unexpected arrival.</p>

<p>Enrico sighed deeply, and then proceeded to inform her, that on
account of his regiment having shifted its quarters, her letter did
not arrive till some weeks after the date; but that immediately on
the receipt of it, he obtained permission of his Colonel to absent
himself; and, attended by Anselmo, his servant, took the direct road
to the Castle of Elfinbach.</p>

<p>'You have been at the Castle, then,' interrupted Laurette, not
instantly considering the improbability of his being able to receive
information relative to her present place of residence by any other
means; as, at the time she addressed him, she was herself
unacquainted with the intentions of the Marchese, and consequently
had mentioned nothing of her removal. Enrico answered her question
with an affirmative, and having hesitated for a moment,
continued--'Though hopeless as to receiving any satisfactory
intelligence concerning my much-injured parent, which might serve as
a clue to guide me in pursuit, I resolved to hasten to the Castle; by
these means to soften, if I could not eradicate my grief, and to
convince myself whether you, my Laurette--my more than sister, was in
safety. But what was my disappointment and distress when I found the
mansion silent and deserted, and every vestige of my former happiness
removed and annihilated?</p>

<p>'It was night when I arrived; and the air of extreme desolation
that it exhibited, had my mind been sufficiently collected, or
abstracted from more painful interests, would have struck me
forcibly; but my feelings were too much and too tenderly wounded, to
regard local circumstances.</p>

<p>'Having reached the principal gate, I rapped violently, but
without success; no passing footstep answered to the summons, and
surprise and impatience succeeded. I then alighted from my horse, and
desiring Anselmo to follow my example, we fastened the animals to a
tree, and then walked round the courts, in hopes of being able to
gain admittance at the western side of the structure; but here our
sanguine expectations were again deceived. I called, but no voice
returned an answer but the echo of my own, which being aided by the
loud rising of the blast, that swept in hollow gusts along the
mountains, had a mournful and solemn effect.</p>

<p>'Impatience now yielded to the most excruciating anguish; I began
to imagine that you also was separated from me for ever. My heart
beat quick--my feeble limbs could scarcely support my agitated
frame--and throwing myself on a piece of the fallen rampart, I
yielded to the despondency that was stealing upon my mind.</p>

<p>'The clouds now passing rapidly over the sky, seemed to portend an
approaching storm; which Anselmo observing, reminding me at the same
time of the danger to which our present situation would expose us,
ventured to request my permission to release the horses from their
confinement; stating the necessity of our endeavouring to accommodate
ourselves for the night at one of the cottages by the side of the
river, as, by this method of proceeding, we might obtain shelter from
the storm, and be enabled to pursue our enquiries at leisure on the
following day.</p>

<p>'This advice, however reasonable, was suddenly rejected, as I
still flattered myself a possibility existed that the castle might be
still inhabited, though nothing appeared to justify the opinion.
Anselmo objected to the probability of the proposition, declaring
that the repeated alarms he had given were sufficient to have
awakened the dead; and besought me to consider my own safety while it
was yet in my power, and, plunged in unavailing despair, not to brave
the fury of the storm which was gathering fast over our heads.</p>

<p>'Having finally yielded, though reluctantly, to his entreaties, I
determined to make another attempt, and wheeling round the quadrangle
again, rapped loudly at the gate. But all was yet silent;--I called,
but no answer was returned; and a stillness, as of the grave, ensued.
Still more chagrined, though the hope that had inspired this last
effort was too feeble to admit of extreme disappointment, I walked
silently towards the oak, to whose trunk the horses were bound, and
began to liberate them.</p>

<p>'Anselmo, who had anticipated my second unsuccessful undertaking,
proposed, that since we had so little chance of obtaining admittance
into the interior of the mansion, for us to make the best of our way,
since we had a wild and dreary forest to pass, and a wood that
appeared like the abode of robbers; observing, that if it was really
the ease, our only chance of escape depended upon the threatening
aspect of the heavens, which might induce those outlaws, by whom
these solitudes are infested, to take refuge in their caves.</p>

<p>'Whilst I still continued to meditate upon the past, without
forming any plan for the future, Anselmo, after having employed many
fruitless endeavours to engage me in conversation, directed my
attention towards a tall edifice, which was partially seen as the
light issued from the sky, which he imagined to be a fane; remarking
that if it was any thing that could offer us an asylum, we were
fortunate in having made the discovery, as it would prevent the
necessity of encountering the peril and danger of traversing the
wood, in whose tangled thickets we might possibly be so entirely
bewildered as to lose the track.</p>

<p>'Though I was too much lost in uneasy conjecture to be
apprehensive of consequences, and was too little inclined to attend
to the loquacity of Anselmo, to listen to the former part of his
discourse; I turned involuntarily towards the mountain to which he
had pointed, and beheld, by a second ray of light that flashed from
the heavens, the spires of a convent, which were half lost to the eye
amid surrounding foliage. Instantly it occurred to me that it was the
convent of St Angelo, belonging to the Carthusians, which determined
me to make up to it immediately and to enquire for Father
Benedicta.</p>

<p>'The extreme perturbation of my mind accounted, in some measure,
for my not having recollected the propriety of this step before; as
information respecting the former inhabitants of the castle might,
with more appearance of probability, be obtained by this means, than
by any other that had been offered. Somewhat animated by this
reflection, we redoubled our speed, regardless of the storm that
broke in thunder over our heads, or the almost universal darkness
that prevailed.</p>

<p>'When we had arrived near the boundaries of the forest, Anselmo's
horse took fright, and threw him, with inconceivable force, against a
piece of broken rock. The scream he uttered on falling, and the deep
groan that succeeded, made me apprehensive of the worst. I called,
but he was unable to answer; the groans continued, but were fainter,
and being convinced that he was materially injured by the blow he had
sustained, if not already dying, I dismounted and hurried to the spot
from whence these melancholy sounds proceeded, though I was so
enveloped in darkness that it was with difficulty I could grope my
way.</p>

<p>'The lightnings had ceased, but the thunder continued to roll,
though distantly, among the rocks, and the rain fell in torrents
around. Having, after many arduous endeavours, raised him from the
ground, being anxious to be assured he was still in existence, I
demanded in what manner he was afflicted. He spoke faintly, that his
head only had suffered, but the blow he feared was mortal. I put my
hand upon his forehead, it streamed with blood; and, being desirous
of preventing too copious an effusion, bound my handkerchief around
his head, and assisted in placing him on my horse.</p>

<p>'Recollecting that there was a hut, whose possessor I had formerly
known, at no very considerable distance from the place, I resolved to
convey him thither; though from the length of time that had elapsed
since I had last seen it, I was not assured of its exact
situation.</p>

<p>'We were, however, fortunate in finding the place we sought; and,
though the family had long forgotten the cares of the day in the
tranquillity of repose, we roused them to the exertion of
benevolence.</p>

<p>'Having procured something of a cordial nature, by means of the
cottagers, to restore the fleeting spirits of Anselmo, I ordered him
to be put to bed, but not till I had examined his wound, which my
skill in surgery, though slight, was sufficient to convince me was
not likely to have a dangerous tendency. But being unwilling to rely
upon my own judgment in so important a matter, lest it should prove
to be erroneous, I dispatched a peasant to the next village, where I
was informed that a surgeon of some eminence resided, to procure
assistance.</p>

<p>'The good fellow, who appeared to possess many excellent
qualities, readily undertook the care of my servant; and mounting my
horse (that which had caused Anselmo's misfortune having escaped),
galloped towards the village.</p>

<p>'It was near midnight when the cottager returned attended by the
surgeon, whose countenance I steadfastly regarded as he examined the
wound, which I had soon the satisfaction of hearing him declare was
not mortal, no contusion having been effected; though he averred that
a slight fever would probably be the consequence of the accident,
which would render an early removal impracticable without a prospect
of further danger.</p>

<p>'The storm was now past; the light clouds dispersed rapidly
towards the horizon, and the moon gleaming palely from the sky, made
me anxious to pursue the way leading to the monastery; and having
convinced Anselmo that he was in good hands, and given him assurances
that I would be with him at an early hour on the following day, I
committed him to the care of the peasants, and quitted the
cottage.</p>

<p>'The rude winds were now hushed, and the undisturbed tranquillity
that succeeded the boisterous warring of the elements, assisted the
melancholy of my reflections. Having descended into the valley, I
looked anxiously towards the mountain where the spires of the convent
had appeared, but they were lost in the gloom of the woods; and
finding it was impossible to obtain even a partial view of the
edifice, I began to apprehend I had taken a wrong path, and was on
the eve of determining to bend my way towards the cottage I had left,
and to wait there for the returning light of the morning, when the
midnight chaunt of the Monks broke softly upon the stillness of the
night, and directed me towards the place from whence it issued.</p>

<p>'As soon as I had struck into the glen that wound up the steep
ascent of the eminence, the meek and holy strain swelled louder,
paused, then sunk into deeper cadence, and in a few moments was heard
no more.</p>

<p>'Fearing lest I should not be able to reach the monastery before
the Monks returned from the chapel, I redoubled my speed, knowing
that admittance could not be easily obtained, should the fathers have
returned to their cells before I could introduce myself to their
notice.</p>

<p>'When I had arrived at the outer gate, I perceived they were just
crossing the chapel yard; and, hanging the bridle of my horse round
the trunk of a chestnut-tree, I waited in hopes of being able to
distinguish Father Benedicta, to whom I could instantly make my self
known, and explain the occasion of this visit. But the faces of the
Monks were so shrouded in their cowls, that not a feature was exposed
to observation.</p>

<p>'The Superior walked first, and the rest of the order in
procession. They had nearly reached the arched door leading into the
court, before I had determined in what manner to address them; when
finding I was at present unperceived, I resolved to let them pass
quietly into the abbey. This done, I rapped loudly at the gate, and
one of the lay brothers appearing, I enquired for Father
Benedicta.</p>

<p>'Without returning an answer, the person whom I addressed retired,
but soon afterwards came attended by a Monk, who, I felt assured, by
his gait and figure, was him for whom I had enquired. Believing I
could not be mistaken in this particular, I was advancing forwards to
meet him, and to express my satisfaction on seeing him, when he threw
back his cowl, and discovered a countenance meek, placid, and full of
devout expression, but it was not Father Benedicta's.</p>

<p>'The Monk bowed courteously, and seemed to await my introduction;
I informed him that I was a benighted traveller who had met with some
singular misfortunes, and had been induced, by the known benevolence
of the fraternity, to request a lodging for the night. The Monk again
bowing, I declared my name, and repeated my enquiries for Father
Benedicta.</p>

<p>'"Our brother is ill," replied the Monk, mildly, "and has not been
able to attend public devotions for some days; but if you will have
the goodness to step into the Refectoire, I will visit his cell, and
will inform him of your name, and the circumstances you have
mentioned." Then ordering a servant to take care of my horse, he
desired me to follow him.</p>

<p>'Having entered the Refectoire, he offered me a seat by the fire,
and hastened to acquaint the Father with my arrival. I was soon
ordered to attend him, and accompanied my conductor to his cell.</p>

<p>'At the farther end of this little apartment was the holy
Benedicta, who had newly arisen from a mattress, probably for the
purpose of performing his midnight devotions. He appeared pale and
emaciated, but serene and cheerful. He arose on my entrance, and
instantly recollecting me, sprang forwards to receive me with an
expression of affection which words would have imperfectly
conveyed.</p>

<p>'His looks and manner affected me so powerfully that I was unable
to speak, and sitting down by his side, I covered my face with my
handkerchief to conceal my emotions; when these had somewhat
subsided, I observed that his features were lighted up by a smile of
more than usual tranquillity, and he began to converse upon common
topics of discourse. I saw he wished to lead me from the subject of
my griefs, and I wished to flatter him with the hope that he had
succeeded.'--</p>

<p>Laurette, who had listened with tender anxiety to this little
narrative, here interrupted Enrico, by asking if the Father Benedicta
was indeed very ill, and if his disorder was supposed to be of a
dangerous nature? On being assured that it was generally believed to
be otherwise throughout the monastery, she demanded eagerly, whether
the Monk had mentioned any thing relative to herself, or the Marchese
de Montferrat? Enrico's countenance visibly changed as she repeated
the question, and he appeared for the moment unable to reply.</p>

<p>'You hesitate,' resumed Laurette, tenderly, 'and consequently have
heard something you are unwilling to disclose;--but if you feel for
me as for a sister, agreeably to your former professions, I conjure
you to make me acquainted with it?' 'If I feel for you as for a
sister!' repeated Enrico, 'Oh, Laurette, is it possible you can be
ignorant of my sentiments?' But in a moment recollecting that he had
never openly avowed them, he checked himself; whilst Laurette,
confused, and anxious to change the conversation, asked whether he
had been into the castle previous to his meeting with her, and if he
had been introduced to the Signora? To this he answered that he had
seen the Marchese's casiera, whom he supposed to be the lady
mentioned, and was directed by her to that part of the grounds where,
she observed, her young guest usually walked when alone. A silence of
some minutes then ensued, which Laurette at length broke, by asking
whether his servant was sufficiently recovered to be able to attend
him hither. 'He is somewhere hereabouts,' returned Enrico, 'and will
soon be here to answer for himself. Anxious as I was to see you, I
could not leave the poor fellow alone in so melancholy a situation;
which occasioned me to prolong my continuance in the monastery, till
the surgeon who attended him assured me that he was in a situation to
travel without endangering his health.' 'You had then frequent
conferences with the Monk?' returned Laurette. Enrico assured her
that he had; but it required little penetration to discover that
there was something connected with the subject he was desirous to
avoid. The discourse then turned upon Madame Chamont, but this was
too distressing to be continued.--Enrico had gained no intelligence
respecting her, as Father Benedicta's exertions had been at present
unsuccessful. The Signora, who now crossed the court to remind them
of the lateness of the hour, a circumstance that never occurred to
them before, summoned her guests into the saloon, where a simple, but
elegant, repast was prepared.</p>

<p>The conversation now became more animated, though less
interesting, than before; and the Signora joined in it with much
spirit and sentiment; she related many incidents concerning some of
the most celebrated families in Italy, and displayed much wit and
vivacity.</p>

<p>Enrico insensibly became pleased with her, and, had not his
attention been so entirely engrossed by the companion of his earliest
days, she might have been a candidate for admiration.</p>

<p>It was late when the party retired to their beds; and Enrico and
Laurette were both too deeply interested in the occurrences of the
day, and too much inclined to reflection, to yield immediately to the
impulse of nature, by seeking forgetfulness in repose.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

<pre>
Oh! let me still with simple Nature live.
My lowly field-flowers at her altar lay;
Enjoy the blessings that she meant to give.
And calmly waste th' inoffensive day.
When waves the grey light o'er the mountain's brow.
Then let me meet the morn's first beauteous ray;
Carelessly wander from my sylvan shed
And catch the sweet breath of the op'ning day.
--LANGHORNE
</pre>

<p>Enrico arose early in the morning, and as no part of the family
was stirring, except the inferior domestics, endeavoured for some
time to amuse himself with strolling about the gardens. As the
residence of the lovely Laurette, scenes that might otherwise have
been contemplated without any extraordinary emotions, excited an
interest in his breast, and he wandered about the castle, wrapped in
that pleasing kind of melancholy which is peculiar to refined and
cultivated minds.</p>

<p>Often as he paced silently the terrace-walk that led to the inner
court, he turned an enquiring eye towards the upper apartments, in
hopes of seeing Laurette at the casement; but she was at present
invisible, and he could not forbear secretly chiding her for losing
the beauty of the morning. Still anxious to beguile the moments of
separation, he walked towards the western lawn, and having reached
the centre, attempted to open the door of the pavilion; but it was
fastened, which made him for a short time irresolute in what manner
to dispose of himself.</p>

<p>At length he determined to return towards the mansion, and to
procure the key; this being delivered to him by the porter, he again
walked pensively along the lawn, and before he applied the key to the
door of the pavilion, stopped to examine this magnificent structure
with more attention than he had before bestowed on it.</p>

<p>It was of Corinthian architecture, and ornamented with much taste
and splendour. It appeared not to have been coeval with the castle,
which was originally Gothic, though some part of the edifice was so
materially modernized that, except the embattled parapets, the
chapel, which was half in ruins, and the narrow pointed arch of the
window, it retained little of its primitive appearance.</p>

<p>The portico of the pavilion was composed of various coloured
marbles, and the pillars which supported it were of the finest
porphyry. The interior of the building was not inferior in
magnificence, and displayed an infinite superiority in point of taste
and beauty. It consisted of three apartments elegantly furnished; one
as a banqueting room, which being lofty and extensive, exhibited a
profusion of rare and valuable ornaments; the ceiling was richly
adorned with paintings by the most celebrated masters; and the floor
covered with a carpet of purple damask, which was beautifully
embroidered with silver, in fanciful and elegant devices. The walls
being in fine relief, were decorated with gilded trophies, whilst the
canopies and other ornaments harmonized with the splendour and
magnificence that pervaded the other parts of this superb
apartment.</p>

<p>Behind this were two other rooms, smaller but not less beautiful
than the one he had examined. They were terminated by glass doors
opening into a shrubbery, whose entrance was guarded by two statues
from the antique, which were half lost to the eye amid the trees and
flowering shrubs that surrounded them. The floors of these apartments
were covered with tapestry, representing scenes from Lucan, Tasso,
and Ovid. The walls were adorned with historical and fanciful
devices, and the upper part of them decorated with valuable pictures
by the first Italian painters. One was a descending angel, by Pietro
Perugino; another a Madonna, by Raphael.</p>

<p>As Enrico gazed attentively upon the latter, which exhibited the
astonishing genius and cultivated taste of the inimitable artist, he
thought he discovered a charm that was familiar to his fancy. The
lifted eye, the melancholy, yet captivating, smile that was stealing
upon the features, he imagined so strikingly resembled the lovely
object of his affections, that he was unable to move from the
spot.</p>

<p>Whilst he was regarding this performance with the admiration it
merited, Laurette entered the room, and finding his attention was
entirely absorbed in the contemplation of the picture, she seated
herself, without accosting him, on a small settee, which was placed
near the door, and amused herself with penciling a flower, which she
had selected for the purpose on her way thither.</p>

<p>When a few minutes had elapsed, finding that he still continued to
observe the Madonna with a fixed and earnest attention, she laid
aside her pencil, and advancing towards him, demanded why he
continued to examine that picture so minutely, when there were so
many paintings in the pavilion which were equally worthy of
admiration?</p>

<p>Enrico, though effectually roused from his reverie, did not
immediately reply; whilst Laurette turning her beautiful eyes
alternately upon him and the picture, repeated the enquiry.</p>

<p>'Because it resembles,' returned Enrico, in a voice faltering with
emotion, 'my too charming sister she whose image is ever present to
my mind, and who is dearer to me than my existence.</p>

<p>Laurette blushed deeply, but was silent and Enrico proceeded:</p>

<p>'Did you know what I have suffered and that I still suffer on your
account, you would not deny me a part of that angelic pity and
commiseration which I have seen you bestow upon objects less
deserving of it.--I have long imposed upon myself,' resumed he, still
more agitated, yet endeavouring to stifle his emotions, 'a severe
restraint;--hitherto I have listened to, and obeyed the dictates of
prudence which instigated me to forbear verbally acknowledging an
attachment which must eventually form all the happiness or torment of
my future life. But doubts and melancholy presages recur frequently
and forcibly to my thoughts which neither reason nor reflection can
subdue. I would fain find a solace for my present inquietude by
anticipating the future, with those enthusiastic hopes which are
peculiar to youth and inexperience; but that future presents only
grief and disappointment to my disordered fancy.</p>

<p>'Whilst you are here, Laurette,' continued Enrico, pressing her
unreluctant hand to his breast, 'you are under the protection of the
Marchese de Montferrat; a man who has had art enough to impose
himself upon the superficial part of the world, as one of its most
perfect characters. I cannot absolutely assert that I am acquainted
with any material crimes that can be alledged against him; but from
some hints, inadvertently dropped by those who have received better
information upon the subject, I am convinced that there are reasons
to justify the suspicion that he is not what he pretends to be.'</p>

<p>Finding that Laurette continued to listen to him with eager
attention, he requested that she would take a seat upon the sofa,
and, placing himself by her side, proceeded:</p>

<p>'The Marchese is yet passionately attached to the pleasures and
luxuries of life, and his ample possessions at once gratify, and give
unlimited range to his desires; he is unaccustomed to controul, and
cannot submit to be shackled by discretion, when it is at enmity with
his inclinations.--Is such a man the proper guardian of youth and
beauty? or is it possible that he, who has hitherto never resisted
their power, can behold them with decided indifference. Besides he
has recently been released from a matrimonial connection, in which
his heart had no interest, and may possibly earnestly desire to
contract another less repugnant to his feelings and
inclinations.'</p>

<p>'Why, Enrico,' interrupted Laurette, 'do you thus resign yourself
to unavailing despondency? why voluntarily yield to the impulse of a
quick and warm indignation, which at once enslaves and obscures your
better judgment?--Is it likely that the Marchese de Montferrat should
behold with decided preference a poor dependant orphan, whose birth
is veiled from all but himself in impenetrable mystery, and whose
youth must preclude the probability of his thinking of her but as a
child?'</p>

<p>Enrico was meditating a reply, when a summons for breakfast
prevented a continuation of the subject.</p>

<p>As soon as they entered the castle they were met by the Signora,
who had prepared the morning's repast, and had been some time in
waiting to receive them. Having rallied them good-naturedly on their
early rising, she proposed a walk, after breakfast, to an adjacent
village, which, from its elevated situation, commanded an extensive
prospect. Laurette and Enrico readily acceding to her wishes, it was
agreed that a female servant should attend them, for the purpose of
conveying a basket of fruit, sweetmeats, and other articles of food,
that the party might not be obliged to return before the evening.</p>

<p>The Signora's favourite woman was also permitted to accompany them
on their excursion, more in the capacity of a companion than a
domestic. She was an Italian, and before the arrival of Laurette, was
admitted as a familiar into those apartments which were appropriated
to the use of her mistress, and was considered as her companion and
confidante. Since then she had been less conversant with the Signora,
who was more strongly attached to her new acquaintance, but was still
highly esteemed and beloved.</p>

<p>It was yet early in the autumn, and the weather remarkably fine.
The road leading to the village was for a considerable way through a
lone and beautiful wood, chiefly composed of oak, flowering ash, and
wild juniper; it skirted a neighbouring mountain which rose gradually
from the gloom, whose summit was crested with the village, which was
the object of their ramble. Its aspect was wild and picturesque,
whilst the profusion of trees that half screened it from observation,
being contrasted with the bare rocks and huge masses of granite, with
which they were surrounded, had a singular and beautiful
appearance.</p>

<p>By winding round an obscure path, encircling the foot of the
mountain, they might have avoided a steep and rugged ascent, but they
preferred the unfrequented glade they had chosen, accessible only to
the foot of the enthusiast and the goatherd. Here they lingered amid
the points of the rocks, selecting mosses and flowers from the
interstices, till the sun, in its noon-tide radiance, spread over the
variegated scenery that full profusion of light and shade, which is
deemed the most favourable to landscape.</p>

<p>As they advanced within a few paces of the summit, the Signora's
foot unfortunately slipped; and had not Enrico, whose solicitude was
equally extended to all that were in need of it, caught her in his
arms, she must have fallen, and such a fall would consequently have
been attended with danger.</p>

<p>A slight hurt was however the result of this trifling accident;
her ankle was sprained, but being unwilling to give pain to others by
the expression of her own, she concealed it; and thanking Enrico for
his attention, agreed to accept of his arm the rest of the way.</p>

<p>Before they arrived at the village it was considerably worse, and
she was under the necessity of stopping at one of the huts, which
were dispersed over the brow of the mountain, to procure an
embrocation. An hospitable cottager received them with a hearty
welcome, and as the Signora's ankle was much swelled, and the pain
still more acute, it was thought necessary for the party to postpone
the execution of their design; and, as it was impossible for her to
return without a conveyance, it was proposed that Enrico and Laurette
should return to the castle, and send Ambrose or Anselmo with a
horse; as no carriage could be procured at a convenient distance.</p>

<p>This, however, the Signora earnestly opposed till they had taken a
view of the country from the extremity of the eminence, and had seen
every thing worthy of observation; at the same time informing them
that it was her intention to remain in the cottage till the evening,
if her hospitable hostess, addressing herself to the woman of the
house, would permit her to remain there.</p>

<p>The cottager acceded, with much good humour, to the request; and
leaving the room for a few minutes, presented them on her return with
some newly-gathered grapes, which her husband, she added, had just
brought from the vineyard. These, in consideration of the fruits and
other provisions which they had conveyed thither, were politely
refused; and the baskets being opened, some of the most delicious
sweetmeats were offered to the cottager, of which she modestly
consented to partake; some wine was then produced by the hostess,
which, more from courtesy than inclination, was accepted.</p>

<p>This simple repast being concluded, the Signora desired her young
companions would leave her to the care of her humane entertainer and
the female domestics who had accompanied them, and continue their
ramble.</p>

<p>At first Laurette objected to the proposal, being unwilling to
leave her friend in a state of indisposition; but her arguments were
overruled by those of the Signora and Enrico, who could not forbear
joining in the request.</p>

<p>As they were retiring from the cottage, the entrance of the
mountaineer, who was its possessor, prevented their design; not being
prepared to expect visitors, his looks expressed surprise and
pleasure, but without making any enquiries, he drew chairs for his
young guests, and desired they would be seated. They obeyed, and the
peasant addressing himself to his wife, desired her to prepare some
refreshment. The Signora, who understood his meaning rather from his
gestures than his words, not being perfectly conversant in the German
tongue, informed him they had just been regaling themselves with some
fruits, and concluded with thanking him for his attention and
hospitality.</p>

<p>The party then alternately explained the occasion of their visit;
expatiating, at the same time, on the neatness and simplicity of the
cottage, the fineness of its situation, and the pure and exalted
felicities of rural life.</p>

<p>Enrico beheld, with an equal degree of curiosity and pleasure, the
peculiar form and countenance of the mountaineer: from some lines in
his face, his long beard, which characterizes the inhabitants of
Saltzburg, and the silver hairs which were thinly scattered among his
fine chestnut locks, he might have been supposed to have been upwards
of fifty, did not his light carriage, his glowing complexion, and his
fine dark speaking eyes, seem to contradict the supposition. An
inexpressible serenity of soul was pictured upon his brow, whilst the
whole contour of his face, which was regular, exhibited a certain
dignity of mind inseparable from a virtuous character. There was
indeed something altogether in his figure and deportment not easy to
describe; and our hero regretted his want of sufficient skill in the
provincial dialect, which prevented the agreeable communication with
him that this circumstance would have afforded.</p>

<p>Enrico having reminded Laurette of their intended ramble, they
arose to depart; and informing the Signora that they would call on
her again before they returned to the castle, they repeated their
acknowledgments to the host and his benevolent companion, and
ascended the summit of the mountain.</p>

<p>The prospect from this eminence was more extensive and picturesque
than they had ventured to imagine; and as they gazed alternately on
the surrounding objects, and on each other, they yielded to the
exquisite sensations of the moment; forgetting in the happiness of
the present, the unpromising aspect of the future, the approaching
separation, and the despondency they had so lately indulged.</p>

<p>The village consisted of a number of cottages, built of stone, and
straggled amid the rocks, without the appearance of design or order;
a few wooden huts, inhabited chiefly by shepherds and vine-dressers,
with the ruins of an abbey, standing lonely and solitary nearly at
the foot of the mountain, and what had formerly been the conventual
church, but was now left open for the devout accommodations of the
unlettered rustics.</p>

<p>The extremity of the eminence commanded, on one side, the wide
part of the valley which ran between two beautiful hills, parts of
which were cultivated to their summits with the vine and pomegranate,
and other parts covered with rich dark woods, encircled with lakes,
whose effect was not less singular than charming; on the other side
were large masses of yellow granite, rising in the most grotesque
forms, and the deep glen through which they had at first ascended,
whose rocky points were yet sparkling in the rays of the sun, whilst
the depth below was veiled in perpetual shade and obscurity. A vast
chain of hills bounded the horizon, which were scarcely to be
distinguished from the clouds which rested upon them, and which gave
grandeur and sublimity to the landscape.</p>

<p>Being somewhat fatigued with traversing the mountain, Enrico and
Laurette seated themselves upon a rock, and in cheerful unrestrained
conversation, disregarded the lapse of time, and even the unequalled
magnificence of scenery which was every way presented.</p>

<p>As Enrico fixed his eyes tenderly upon Laurette, he thought she
never before appeared so beautiful as at that moment; her dress was
more than ordinarily negligent, and the wind, which had disordered
her fine hair, had given a soft bloom to her complexion, which no
vermilion could emulate. Whilst he continued to regard her elegant
form, which for grace and proportion might have been taken as a model
for perfection, and listened to the sweet accents of her voice, his
soul was resigned to the fascinating influence of love and beauty;
but when he reflected upon the Marchese, who, he was assured, could
not behold such inimitable perfections with indifference, he fell
suddenly from the most animated discourse into fits of musing and
dejection, to which a mind, less interested in his happiness than
Laurette's, could not be insensible.</p>

<p>She recollected what had passed in the pavilion, and also the
conversation of the preceding evening, when he mentioned having had
another conference with the venerable Carthusian, but was prevented
from acquainting her with the result by the appearance of the
Signora.</p>

<p>The person from whom he had obtained information concerning the
Marchese, she believed could be no other than the Father Benedicta,
who, from his looks and manners when she presented him with the
letter previous to her quitting her former abode, and from some hints
he had then dropped, was evidently concerned on her account; and it
was equally certain that he was not much prejudiced either in favour
of the epistle or the writer.</p>

<p>Anxious to be acquainted with the extent of his fears, that she
might administer all possible consolation, yet fearful of increasing
the uneasiness of Enrico by reverting to the cause of it, she at last
ventured to ask how long Anselmo's indisposition had detained him at
the monastery? and whether the Monk had mentioned any thing in which
they were materially interested?</p>

<p>Enrico did not instantly reply; for it was difficult to command
his feelings, and the eyes of Laurette being fixed upon his with an
expression of earnest and tender solicitude, tended to heighten his
distress.--Finding, at length, that suspense was becoming painful, be
assumed an appearance of composure, and then began as follows.</p>

<h3>Chapter 4</h3>

<pre>
Love only feels the marvellous of pain.
Opens new veins of torture in the heart.
And wakes the nerve where agonies are born.
--YOUNG
</pre>

<p>'My first visit to the father was short, for it was long past
midnight when I entered his cell. What happened at that interview I
have already related. He appeared at first much affected, but
afterwards became more tranquil; and a message from the Superior, who
politely accommodated me with a bed, put an end to all farther
discourse.</p>

<p>'I was then conducted to my apartment by one of the lay brothers,
whose office it is to attend upon pilgrims, and being weary and
exhausted with grief and fatigue, obtained a transient forgetfulness
in repose. I had not slept long, before I was alarmed by the tolling
of a bell, whose hollow and heavy sound vibrating through the
buildings, produced a melancholy and solemn effect. Knowing that this
was not the usual summons to the early matins, I conceived it
portended some extraordinary event, and being desirous of learning
the occasion of it, arose and dressed myself in haste. These
suspicions were confirmed by the shutting and opening of doors, the
murmur of distant voices, and of the number of footsteps which were
heard passing and repassing the cloisters.</p>

<p>'I endeavoured, for a considerable time, to arrest the attention
of some of the Friars by calling at the door of my apartment, but
without success, and was retiring to my bed without being acquainted
with the cause of this alarm, when one of the brotherhood, whom I
afterwards discovered to be the same who had given me admittance on
my arrival, entered the chamber, and informed me that the bell I had
heard announced the departure of a soul that was just fled to its
eternal home.</p>

<p>'I started, and without giving myself time for reflection,
demanded whether the person he alluded to was Father Benedicta. The
answer was a negative; it was Father Marco, who had been long ill,
and whose death had been some time expected. Thanking him for his
attention, he withdrew; and, glad to find my fears respecting the
worthy Monk were not realized, I endeavoured to compose myself to
rest.</p>

<p>'In the morning I was introduced to the Prior, who received me
with much cordiality and friendship. We conversed for some time over
the morning's repast upon different subjects, which he discussed with
much ease and fluency, though it was not without reluctance that I
entered into a conversation, which, however animated on the part of
the Superior, was in my present tone of spirits, tedious and
uninteresting.</p>

<p>'Having obtained his permission to revisit Father Benedicta, who I
was assured was in a state of convalescence, though not sufficiently
recovered to attend prayers in the chapel, I availed myself of the
indulgence, and repaired to his cell.</p>

<p>'On opening the door, I observed this devout Monk, being newly
arisen, was engaged in the performance of his devotions. He was
kneeling at a square stone table on the eastern side of the room,
that was covered with a black cloth, on which were placed a human
scull, and other mementos of mortality; a small ivory crucifix stood
in the centre, over which was suspended a painting, representing the
resurrection of Lazarus.</p>

<p>'Fearing I had obtruded myself into his presence at an improper
hour, I apologized for my intrusion, and would have retired, but he
prevented my design, and leading me to a seat, "You are welcome, my
son," said he, with his accustomed mildness; "a visit from you can
never be unseasonable; it is a gratification which I have long
anxiously desired, and for which I have waited perhaps too
impatiently."</p>

<p>'Here he hesitated; and, on looking up, I thought I discovered
something more in his countenance than its usual expression: the fire
of devotion was still in his eyes; his face, which was marked with
the lines of penitence and sorrow, was animated with a faint glow
that crossed his cheek and disappeared, leaving upon the features it
thus transiently illumined, that kind of dignified tenderness which
we generally attribute to beings of a superior order.</p>

<p>'"You are doubtless acquainted with some unfortunate events that
have taken place since you last joined your regiment," resumed the
Father, "but possibly have not been able to ascertain the cause of
the compulsive and arbitrary measures employed; or to form any
conception as to what part of the Continent Madame Chamont, your
excellent parent, is conveyed."</p>

<p>'After assuring him that I had but recently received this
unwelcome intelligence, and was unable to form any conjecture
concerning it, I demanded eagerly why the castle was deserted; and
whither you and the rest of its inhabitants were removed?</p>

<p>"They are removed, I think," returned the Monk, meekly, "to a
castle in the principality of Saltzburg."</p>

<p>"Think, Father!" I replied, "gracious heaven! do you then only
think? If you are not certain they are there, or in some place of
security, I shall suspect that there remains another calamity to be
unfolded, another attack upon my peace, perhaps severer than the
last."</p>

<p>"You are impetuous, my son," returned the Monk, "but these are
trials that put our virtues to the proof, and frequently render
ineffectual the most vigorous efforts of reason and fortitude. Though
we must endeavour to endure as christians, we must feel as men; nor
can we expect to see always the warm affections of youth corrected
and regulated by the calmness of discretion. Laurette, the subject of
your enquiry, is still under the protection of the Marchese de
Montferrat, though not under his eye; the Marchese being still
resident at the Castello St Aubin, in the neighbourhood of Turin.</p>

<p>"You have at last relieved me, holy Father, I replied, from a
state of perplexity and suspense that was becoming almost
insupportable; and which, I hope, will, in some measure, excuse that
extreme impetuosity of which you have justly accused me, and which
the most perfect esteem for your character would, on any common
occasion, have prevented me from discovering."</p>

<p>'Father Benedicta bowed; then asked if I had been introduced to my
patron, and, if not, whether he had never intimated a desire, either
by message or letter, of being personally known to me? On my
convincing him of the contrary, he was evidently much amazed; and
enquired, with some appearance of confusion, if I was acquainted with
the nature of the connection which had so long subsisted between the
Marchese and Madame Chamont?</p>

<p>'I informed him that I was not; for every thing that could lead to
the subject had been as much as possible avoided, and that whenever I
had ventured to introduce any thing likely to have this tendency, my
mother appeared chagrined and unhappy; that she never on any account
mentioned my father, and scrupulously concealed every circumstance of
her past life; that the name of the Marchese seldom escaped her lips,
though I was compelled to believe, from the earliest period of my
existence, that my only dependance was upon him; and that, from the
native generosity of his disposition, he had sent to the protection
of my mother a lovely little girl, who was supposed to be the orphan
daughter of a deceased friend: from which circumstance, as well as
from the conversation of his steward, I was taught to reverence him
as a father, to respect him as a friend, and to consider him as a man
of stainless honour and unblemished reputation, to whom only I could
look as to the patron of my future days.</p>

<p>'"Would to heaven you was not mistaken, my son!" returned the
Monk, mournfully, "perhaps I am not justified in advancing any thing
which may serve to counteract principles so heedfully instilled into
your mind in early youth, but I fear you have been miserably
deceived. Is it possible that you are unacquainted with the
unfortunate story of the Conte della Croisse?" resumed he, sighing
deeply, and pausing to await my answer. You have not, I think, been
stationary at the Castle of Elfinbach since a certain strange and, I
may say, providential discovery.'</p>

<p>'On my requesting to know what was the discovery he alluded to, he
betrayed many symptoms of astonishment, and then added, 'You are, I
find, designedly kept ignorant of the affair; and since, by extending
your knowledge, I might possibly injure your repose, an explanation
would be unpardonable.</p>

<p>"Indeed," continued the Monk, seeming to recollect himself, "I may
have been too uncandid in my conjectures; we are apt to reflect upon
our own frailties and imperfections with partiality, and to judge too
unfavourably of the conduct of others. The Marchese may have some
virtues."</p>

<p>'Here the father was silent; and, being anxious to comprehend the
extent of his suspicions, I acknowledged myself much interested in
what had already been recited, and besought him to indulge me with an
explanation, and inform me who was the Conte della Croisse, and with
whom his story was connected. A violent emotion seemed to agitate his
frame as I repeated this request, and, without answering me, he arose
and paced the room for some time with quick and perturbed steps; and
then, after regarding me with a look of fixed and earnest
attention--</p>

<p>'"My son," cried he, "this subject is too painful; neither my
health nor my spirits will allow me to continue it; and, since it
will inevitably endanger our mutual peace, we will defer it till some
future period, when, should an explanation be necessary, whatever
torment it may inflict upon myself, I will give it you."</p>

<p>'"Watch over Laurette with the tender solicitude of a brother; for
she is young, artless, and beautiful, and may have need of a
disinterested protector. I wished to have had some conversation with
that dear child, but she was taken suddenly from the castle, and
every precaution I had formed for her future welfare was, by this
means, rendered ineffectual."</p>

<p>'Having thanked him for the zeal he had discovered in your cause
with the ardour natural to my disposition, the Monk cast upon me a
look of tenderness, and continued--</p>

<p>'"It is needless to exhort you to exert your most strenuous
endeavours to inform yourself of the destiny of your unfortunate
parent; but let me request, nay command, that, should every effort
prove inefficacious, you will not allow yourself to sink into
despondency; but remember the duty you owe to your God, to yourself,
and to your country. Recollect that wherever she is, she is equally
under the protection of heaven, who never abandons the virtuous; and
that your utmost exertions are necessary as well for your own
preservation and advancement, as to support the unprotected innocence
of your adopted sister."</p>

<p>'Here the father remained silent; and the entrance of a Monk, who
came to enquire into the state of his health, put an end to all
farther discourse upon the subject. Having no hopes of renewing it, I
took my leave; and, with a mind but ill at ease, repaired to the
cottage to fulfil my engagement with Anselmo.</p>

<p>'I found him considerably better, and much more cheerful than on
the preceding evening. He told me he was in readiness to accompany
me, though his looks did not agree with the assertion, for he still
appeared pale and enervated.</p>

<p>'Having continued with him some hours, I availed myself of the
Prior's invitation to return to, and remain in, the monastery, till
Anselmo was in a situation to travel. During this period, my time was
chiefly devoted to the society of Father Benedicta; but nothing could
prevail on him to renew the discourse. He seemed to repent having
touched upon it at all, and we parted mutually dissatisfied; he
regretting that he had said so much, and I that he had explained so
little.</p>

<p>'The rest of the narrative may be concluded in a few words: I left
him considerably recovered, and received his heavenly benediction,
mingled with tears and gentle remonstrances; and, having obtained a
direction to the Castle of Lunenburg, set forwards, attended by
Anselmo, for Saltzburg. No material incident happened on my journey,
and with the rest you are acquainted.</p>

<p>'I introduced myself to the Signora d'Orfo; she received me with
courtesy, and instructed me where to seek you. Contrary to my
expectations, you was beyond the boundaries of the walls. At the time
that you passed near the shrubbery on your return, I was conversing
with Ambrose, who, I was in hopes, might have seen what road you had
taken, but who was unable to give me any satisfactory
intelligence.</p>

<p>'I have now, my Laurette,' continued Enrico, 'acquainted you with
all; and, from the circumstances I have related, you may guess all I
feel, and all I fear. We must part--a temporary separation is
unavoidable. I must go in search of my much-injured mother; and if
she has not been seized by banditti, but has been torn from her home,
her family, and all who are dear to her, by the daring machinations
of designing villainy, I will not rest till I have discovered the
authors of this premeditated cruelty--till I have restored her to her
tenderest connections, and have exposed the artifice of her
persecutors. There are laws, and if they cannot be enforced, I have a
sword, never yet drawn but in the exercise of justice, but which
shall be raised against the heart of the oppressor, in the cause of
defenceless innocence.</p>

<p>'But, Oh Laurette! before I am compelled to quit these heavenly
regions, dear to me, because consecrated by your presence, and, in
compliance with my wayward destiny, prepare to bid you a long, and if
obliged to engage in any desperate enterprize, perhaps a last adieu;
tell me, I conjure you, that I am not indifferent to you, and that
the recollection of our juvenile felicity will endear to your
remembrance him who was a sharer of it--the companion of your
earliest days; since this is the only reflection that can soften the
rigours of my fate, and dissipate the cloudy atmosphere of my future
prospects?'</p>

<p>Laurette, who had marked with concern every circumstance which he
had related, and had been comparing them with those that had fallen
under her immediate notice, now yielded to the softness that
oppressed her mind; and, leaning tenderly upon his arm, covered her
face with her handkerchief, and wept unrestrainedly.</p>

<p>'By heaven this is too much!' cried Enrico, endeavouring to
command his emotions, 'forgive me, dearest Laurette, if, in the
attempt of drawing from you a mutual confession, I have renewed that
grief I ought to have mitigated.--Say but that you love me and, from
this moment, all the energies of my soul shall be exerted in your
cause, and for the security of your happiness.'</p>

<p>'Is it possible, Enrico,' replied Laurette, 'that you can doubt
the sincerity of my friendship--a friendship I have so long, so
tenderly indulged; or believe that the son of my amiable
benefactress, who supplied to me the place of a parent, and deprived
of whom, I now feel the wants of one, can be reflected upon without
esteem and gratitude.'</p>

<p>'Esteem and gratitude!' repeated Enrico, 'and is this all I must
expect or hope for--is the cold sentiment of friendship a sufficient
reward for inviolable affection--is this all you can bestow as a
recompence for the innumerable cares and anxieties I have
endured?--rather hate and abandon me at once--teach me to think of
you, and adore you no more--and let me wander over this desolated
earth, without a hope to stimulate exertion, or an object to endear
existence.--There was a time when I indulged the transient, delusive
idea that I could have insured your affection; but I have been
deceived, unhappily deceived, and you have assisted in the deception
that has undone me.'</p>

<p>'You wrong me, indeed you wrong me,' replied Laurette, in a voice
scarcely audible, 'how have I deserved this censure? and why, by
affecting to misunderstand me, will you thus add to my distress?
Enrico, you are not calm--you do not listen to the dictates of
reason, nor resign yourself to the guidance of discretion. By
endeavouring to work upon my feelings, in thus appealing to my heart,
you have been striving to wrest from me a confession, which perhaps I
ought not to make.</p>

<p>'I am not insensible to your merit, nor do I affect to be so; but
the peculiarity of my situation forbids any advances but those of
friendship and brotherly affection, which I have ever tenderly
cherished. To enter into any engagement without the sanction of those
under whose protection I am placed, would justly expose me to
censure, and would appear, to the unprejudiced and discerning, as the
height of indiscretion and ingratitude.</p>

<p>'Besides, would not such conduct lessen you in the estimation of
the person, on whom your dependance, as well as mine, is placed?
Would not the Marchese openly resent the want of confidence we had
betrayed, and consequently withdraw his patronage, not only from me,
but from you; and should I not then consider myself as the author of
your misfortunes, and feel acutely the uneasiness such a reflection
must occasion?'</p>

<p>'Has he not withdrawn it already?' returned Enrico; 'has he ever
expressed a wish to see me, or exerted his interest to procure my
advancement? How slender would be my hopes if they rested entirely
upon him--But are you determined, Laurette, to resign yourself to the
power of the Marchese?'</p>

<p>'Alas! on whom can I depend?' replied she, sighing; 'I have no
friend but him on whom I can rely for immediate support, no relation
living, at least not to my knowledge, and am totally unacquainted
with the authors of my existence. If the Marchese proves himself
unworthy of my confidence, and I find any thing in his conduct which
may eventually prove injurious to my peace, it will then be time
enough to relinquish his protection, and to secure another asylum in
a less splendid and dangerous situation.'</p>

<p>Finding that she was too firm to yield to the force of a premature
attachment, and was too strictly guarded by delicacy to avow more
than a sisterly affection, till it was sanctioned by those who had a
right to the disposal of her; Enrico only ventured to request that,
should her present abode be less eligible than she expected, and he
sufficiently fortunate in his military department to secure an
independence, or at least the prospect of one, that she would then
allow him to resume the subject, and in the mean time permit him to
write to her; and that she would continue to think with tenderness
upon him, whose whole existence was dedicated to her service.</p>

<p>To this she cheerfully assented, and giving him her hand with the
most charming frankness, reminded him of the time they had been
absent from the cottage, and proposed their returning to it
immediately.</p>

<p>Having watched, for a few moments, the sun sinking slowly upon the
surface of the water, they gradually descended the extreme point of
the mountain, and entered the cottage.</p>

<p>The Signora had been expecting them some time and, as her ankle
was still very painful, had sent one of the servants to the castle to
order Ambrose to bring a horse, for the purpose of conveying her
home.</p>

<p>As no animal, except a mule, could traverse without danger the
steep ascent of the eminence, she was compelled to go near half a
league round; which obliged Laurette and Enrico to return without her
by what way they should think proper.</p>

<p>Ambrose soon appeared; and the Signora being mounted behind him,
our young wanderers took leave of the kind-hearted peasantry, and
agreed, as the difference in the length of the way was
inconsiderable, to return by the other side of the mountain, and to
visit the solitary ruin.</p>

<p>Having descended the eminence by a lone and entangled sheep-path,
frequently turning aside to mark the purple tints of the western sky,
to listen to the last flutter of the breeze among the half leafless
trees, or the distant sound of a flute, or a vesper-bell, they
arrived at the long-neglected and forsaken abbey.</p>

<p>The deepening glooms of the twilight, which fell fast around them,
rendered the solitary grandeur of this lonely ruin still more
impressive and sublime, whose interesting appearance was materially
increased by the correspondent melancholy of the scenery. A clump of
dark firs, on one side, cast an almost impenetrable shade, whilst the
other opening upon an extensive heath, was exposed to the merciless
beatings of the not unfrequent storm. All here wore an aspect still
more dreary and deserted, from the total want of vegetation which was
every where visible.</p>

<p>'The thistle was there, on its rock, shedding its aged beard; the
old tree groaned in the blast; the murmur of night was abroad.'</p>

<p>The abbey was originally built round a quadrangle, in the manner
of a fortified castle, with spires instead of turrets. The entrance
into the court was rugged, overgrown with long grass, and scattered
with the fragments of the fallen edifice. The walls which marked the
circumference, wore an appearance of great antiquity, and of such
ponderous strength, that they contemplated with astonishment the
invincible attacks of time. The ivy and the elder had taken root in
the crevices of the stones, which were encrusted with moss,
night-shade, and wild gilliflower; and from the loop-windows, which
were fringed with weeds, a solitary sprig of the ash and the arbeal
were occasionally seen waving mournfully in the wind, and replying to
the murmurs of the rising blast.</p>

<p>The spires of the building were crumbling fast into dust, and the
body of this once massy structure was nearly sharing the same fate.
Indeed the whole of the remains were in so tottering a state, that
Laurette could scarcely prevail upon Enrico to allow her to enter
what had once been a door, to examine it more minutely.</p>

<pre>
A pile stupendous, once of fair renown.
This mould'ring mass of shapeless ruin rose.
Where nodding heights of fractur'd columns frown,
And birds obscene in ivy bowers repose;
Oft the pale matron, from the threat'ning wall,
Suspicious, bids her heedless children fly;
Oft, as he views the meditated fall.
Full swiftly steps the frighted peasant by.
--LANGHORNE
</pre>

<p>On the eastern side of the court was a small chapel, which was
less ruinous than the rest of the fabric, though the narrow Gothic
windows, once filled with painted glass, that cast a dim and fading
light, were now shattered and decayed; whilst the pavement leading to
the entrance, which once resounded only to the foot of devotion, was
now rude and grass-grown.</p>

<p>Impressed with the awful scene of desolation that surrounded her,
Laurette felt a sublime and tender melancholy stealing upon her mind;
and as she surveyed the venerable pile sinking slowly into oblivion,
her imagination reverted to its former inhabitants, now long since
mingled with the dust.</p>

<p>The door of the chapel being made of the most lasting materials,
retained somewhat of its primitive appearance; a large stone, by way
of a step, was placed at the entrance, which being broken, and
covered with moss and fallen leaves, exhibited an aspect of gloom,
neglect, and silence.</p>

<p>The door was not quite closed, and desiring Enrico to follow her,
Laurette entered the chapel. It was dark, and was considerably larger
than she expected to have found it. A narrow window, at the farther
end, just discovered its extent; and turning round she distinguished,
in that part of it where the altar had been formerly erected, a
figure in the dress of a white friar, kneeling, and deeply engaged in
devotion.</p>

<p>The idea of the mysterious Monk darted instantly across her mind,
and not being sufficiently tranquil to endure new scenes of surprise
and terror, she seized the arm of Enrico, and would have hurried him
from the place, without farther explanation.</p>

<p>Astonished at the alarm she expressed, and the sudden paleness of
her looks, he endeavoured to learn the occasion of her fears, and to
quiet them; informing her, in a low voice, that she had nothing to
apprehend, since it was doubtless some Friar from a neighbouring
monastery, who, walking round the ruin, had been suddenly inspired to
offer up his evening prayer at that once holy altar.</p>

<p>Laurette acknowledged the apparent probability of the remark; but
at the same time repeated her resolution of retiring, in a manner
which sufficiently displayed how much of terror was mingled with
amazement.</p>

<p>Smiling at what he believed to be merely superstition, yet
secretly touched with the earnestness of her manner, he was leading
her towards the door, when the Monk, who either did not hear, or did
not regard the murmur of their voices, arose and advanced with quick
steps towards the entrance.</p>

<p>They stopped for a few seconds by the side of a pillar to let him
pass; and as he swept by them, as if before unconscious of witnesses,
he turned aside his cowl to survey them. It discovered a thin spare
face, marked with age and affliction; a ray of light that fell upon
it, gave life to a large, full, melancholy eye, that was lifted up
with an expression of mingled pity and sadness. There was indeed
nothing in his figure or countenance expressive of severity or
austere devotion; and Laurette thinking she recognized the person of
her mysterious visitor, clung still closer to Enrico, and endeavoured
to conceal herself behind one of the columns.</p>

<p>As he passed, Enrico bowed, and would have addressed him; but he
drew his cowl close, and heaving a deep sigh, left the chapel.</p>

<p>When they crossed the court, they beheld him standing by the side
of the building, as if surveying it, and frequently turning to see
whether he was observed. As they pursued their walk, Enrico gently
rallied her upon her superstition; for his mind, being somewhat
reassured by the promise she had made him of accepting his
protection, should she be obliged to relinquish that of the Marchese,
he felt more disposed to cheerfulness.</p>

<p>When they had arrived near the castle, Laurette turned, and
perceived the Monk, at some distance, apparently following them. Her
suspicions concerning it being the identical Friar who had delivered
the portrait, were now more strongly confirmed; but not seeming to
regard him, she hastened her steps, and, faint and fatigued, arrived
at the castle.</p>

<p>The Signora was already there, waiting with the evening's
refreshment; and after relating to each other the incidents of the
day, they separated and retired to their rooms: Laurette to reflect
upon the conversation during their ramble, with the strange adventure
at the abbey; and Enrico, upon the charming object of his regard, who
was never absent from his thoughts.</p>

<h3>Chapter 5</h3>

<pre>
When morn first faintly draws her silver line.
Or Eve's grey clouds descend to drink the wave;
When sea and sky in midnight darkness join.
Still, still he views the parting look she gave.
--ROGERS
</pre>

<p>Enrico had remained some days at the castle of Lunenburg before he
had collected a sufficient degree of fortitude to enable him to
endure the idea of quitting it; till the dutiful impulses of his
nature directing his harassed thoughts towards his mother, determined
him to fix an early day for his departure.</p>

<p>This intention being imparted to his Colonel by letter, who was
still resident with his regiment, he began to reason himself into
composure, and to mark the limits of his intended route. No places,
he believed, were so likely to afford information as the hotels and
village inns on the borders of the Rhine, which made him resolve to
let none of them escape his enquiries.</p>

<p>Now secretly accusing himself of inattention by this transient
delay, and now yielding to apprehensions he could not possibly
eradicate, the mind of Enrico endured the most painful conflict; and
so acute were his feelings, that it was long before he could assume
serenity enough to acquaint Laurette with the day which he had
appointed to leave her, and to conjure her never to forget him.</p>

<p>On the evening preceding the time fixed for his journey, he
detained her for some hours longer in the saloon than was his custom,
inflicting new torment upon himself, by reflecting upon the fleeting
nature of his happiness, and the anguish of being compelled to leave
her innocent and defenceless beauty exposed to the rigours of a
destiny so full of danger; and the melancholy, but not improbable
conjecture, that they might meet no more.</p>

<p>These sad presages, which Laurette found it impossible to dispel,
she endeavoured to assuage, by representing the causelessness of his
surmises, and the indispensible necessity of exercising the virtues
of resignation and fortitude.</p>

<p>Enrico listened, and attempted to profit by so bright an example
of meekness and patient endurance, internally suffering from
disappointment and uneasy apprehensions, yet suffering with the most
collected firmness; but though his mind was naturally strong, noble,
and vigorous, it required an effort beyond it to bear to leave her
alone to contend with the adversities of her fate, without the
possibility of his being able to overlook the conduct of those in
whose power she was placed, or of investing himself in that
authority, which would give her a claim upon his immediate
protection.</p>

<p>She had, however, promised to correspond with him, to remember him
with the affection of a sister, which recollection, at the same time
that it operated as an antidote to his present inquietude, permitted
him to look forwards to the future with less regret and
solicitude.</p>

<p>On the morning that was to separate him from her, in whose society
he enjoyed all the felicity he was capable of experiencing, he arose,
pale and unrefreshed by sleep, long before the sun had risen upon the
hills that bounded the eastern horizon, and paced as usual, with slow
and thoughtful steps, the grand terrace walk, which was under the
range of apartments occupied by Laurette, the Signora, and other
branches of the family.</p>

<p>None of the domestics being arisen except Ambrose, who had opened
him the door of the portico, a deep and universal silence prevailed,
disturbed only occasionally by the distant sound of a cataract, the
stroke of a wood-cutter, or the distant and mellow tones of a flute,
to call the sheep from their nightly folds.</p>

<p>At length the sun emerged gradually from the waters into a clear
and cloudless sky, spreading over the whole extent of ether a meek
and silvery glow. The grey mists that had dimmed the summits of the
mountains, crept slowly into the interstices of the rocks, and the
gentle responses of the birds were heard feebly from the neighbouring
woods.</p>

<p>With a mind too much absorbed in its own reflections to be able to
feel the full force of sylvan beauty, or to listen with pleasure to
those simple and rural sounds so dear to the heart of the enthusiast,
Enrico continued to walk along the terrace with perturbed and unequal
steps, till he was roused from his thoughtfulness by the opening of a
casement. He turned--it was Laurette; she did not instantly perceive
him, and he retreated a few paces backwards to observe her
motions.</p>

<p>She looked pale, and seemed to have been weeping, but her beauty
was nothing impaired by the sorrow she appeared to have indulged. A
loose robe was negligently thrown over her lovely person, without
care or art; it was of the purest white, long, and open at the bosom,
displaying to advantage her fine disordered hair, that wandered about
her neck loose and unconfined. Her eyes, which were yet filled with
tears, were directed towards the heavens, and her thoughts seemed to
have ascended with them.</p>

<p>Enrico was at present undistinguished, for he had placed himself
behind the spreading branches of a larch, and was sensible only to
the charming object of his affection. She sighed, and in the same
moment he heard his own name pronounced in a soft and tremulous
accent, accompanied by some words too indistinct to be heard. Unable
to endure the increasing tenderness that was stealing upon his mind,
he sprang forwards from the deep shade that had afforded him
concealment, and requested that she would descend, and walk with him
in the gardens.</p>

<p>Confused at being thus unexpectedly exposed to the gaze of her
lover, she blushed, and drying away the tears that had fallen
unrestrainedly upon her cheeks, she forced a smile upon her features,
and agreed to meet him at the portal.</p>

<p>Having bound her beautiful locks with a turban, which she usually
wore, not because it was authorized by custom, but as it was a mode
of dress recommended by Madame Chamont, who imagined that it became
her, which was ornamented with a wreath of roses and violets, worked
by her own delicate fingers; she threw a thin shade upon her
shoulders, and left her apartment.</p>

<p>She met Enrico at the door of the great hall, who was impatiently
waiting her arrival; and, on observing with pity the extreme sadness
that was depicted upon his countenance, held out her hand to him, and
asked him, with a soft yet melancholy smile, if he was ill?</p>

<p>Transported with the tenderness of her manner beyond the powers of
expression or utterance, he could only press it eagerly to his lips,
and then hold it to his heart, as if he would never part with it
again. At length Laurette gently disengaging herself, asked him how
long he had been in the gardens, and whether he was inclined to
prolong his walk, or to wait in the terrace parlour till the Signora
was risen?</p>

<p>'Have you not promised to ramble with me,' returned Enrico, 'and
would you deny me a pleasure--' here he paused, 'the last I may ever
experience' he would have added, but his voice faltered; and Laurette
perceiving his emotions, without attempting a reply, took his offered
arm, and walked with him along the lawn.</p>

<p>The door of the pavilion being open, they involuntarily entered
it; and proceeding to the last of the apartments that opened into the
shrubbery, seated themselves upon a small sofa at the extremity. A
large marble table was placed before it, which was scattered over
with leaves of music; at one end of it lay a small lute, the property
of the Signora, who sometimes, when alone, had resorted thither, that
she might be enabled to beguile the moments of solitude with a
song.</p>

<p>Laurette took it up, and played a little melancholy air; it was a
cantata from Metestasio, but too applicable to her present feelings
to bestow the charm of content. It breathed the sorrows of disastrous
love; and as she played, 'she waked her own sad tale from every
trembling string'.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of it, her lips faltered, the colour forsook her
cheek, and forgetting the lesson of fortitude which she had been so
lately instilling in to the mind of Enrico, and the resolution she
had made to wear, at least, the appearance of it in his presence, she
was compelled to lean upon the side of the sofa for support; and
tears, which she could no longer suppress, fell in large drops upon
the lute.</p>

<p>Enrico, who had been lost to every other circumstance in the
harmony of her voice, now thought she had fainted, and would have
caught her in his arms; but an effort of fortitude revived her, and
disengaging herself from his embrace, she would have spoke to have
quieted his fears, but the entrance of Anselmo prevented her. He had
been for some time in quest of his master, and finding that the door
of the pavilion was unfastened, had ventured to intrude. His business
was to inform him that the horses were in readiness, and to know if
he had any further commands.</p>

<p>Enrico started as if he had received a summons for death; and
after walking to the other end of the apartment with hasty and
agitated steps, paused for an instant to recompose his disordered
spirits. In a few moments he assumed an appearance of composure, and
returning again towards Laurette, who had just risen from the sofa,
he fixed his fine eyes upon her's, with a look too expressive to be
misunderstood, and then added--</p>

<p>'The moment of separation, which has been long painfully
anticipated, is arrived; and nothing but the sweet consolatory hope
that I shall still live in your remembrance, could reconcile me to
this cruel exile.'</p>

<p>Laurette was unable to reply; and having led her from the
pavilion, he reminded her again of her former promises, and, with an
aching and oppressed heart, gazed tenderly upon her pale but lovely
face, and heard her innocent farewel.</p>

<p>The Signora, who was but just arisen, came forwards to meet them
at the outer gate, and wishing Enrico much happiness with the
appearance of much sincerity and kindness, he mounted his horse; and,
after lingering some time for one more look at the beautiful
Laurette, till the white folds of her robe were lost in distance, he
left the boundaries of the castle, and pursued his journey.</p>

<p>Overcome with grief for the present, and sorrowful presages for
the future, our heroine returned pensively towards the mansion; and
being unable to conceal the uneasiness that preyed upon her heart,
retired to her apartment, that she might weep, and indulge it in
secret. The hope that Enrico would succeed in his enterprize, was too
feeble to sustain her; for the length of time that had elapsed since
Madame Chamont was forced from the castle, and the many ineffectual
measures that had been already employed, promised nothing of success
to any future ones that could be adopted. Sometimes she imagined that
the Marchese was materially concerned in it; and at others, though
many collected circumstances seemed to justify the opinion, she
dismissed it, as uncandid and illiberal.</p>

<p>What the Father Benedicta had uttered, agreed but too well with
the words of the mysterious Monk, though those of the latter were of
more dreadful import; and she remembered and reflected upon them with
increasing emotion. That he was the person whom she had seen in the
chapel of the ruin, she believed nearly amounted to conviction; both
from his dress, the height of his stature, and the attention with
which he had regarded them; this, added to the circumstance of his
following them, as if to be assured of the exact place of their
residence, was sufficient to confirm the suspicion.</p>

<p>It appeared reasonable to suppose, from the former conduct of the
Father, that he would loiter about in the evenings, in the hope of
meeting with her; but whatever symptoms of curiosity she had formerly
betrayed respecting her birth, and of being acquainted with the
manner in which he had obtained the possession of the picture, so
much of terror was mingled with it, and so little did she believe it
would avail her any thing as to her future happiness, to be informed
of her birth and connections, since she had no relation to claim, or
to protect her, that she resolved rather to avoid than precipitate an
interview, which could be productive of no real good, and might
possibly augment her uneasiness.</p>

<p>Accustomed from earliest youth to place an unlimited confidence in
the wisdom and goodness of Providence, she determined to act in every
respect with caution and dignity, and to endure those temporal and
unavoidable evils, which are the common lot of humanity, with patient
firmness.</p>

<p>Had she not been so strictly enjoined to secrecy as to preclude
the advantage arising from the advice and participation of
disinterested friendship, she would have met him without reluctance;
but thus situated, another conference, even could it have been
effected with ease and safety, she was aware might lead to future
inquietude and danger; and therefore resolved to take no direct
measures to further his scheme, but rather to avoid any future
opportunity of conversing with him, unless some succeeding event
should make another interview necessary or desirable.</p>

<p>The violent emotions Enrico had betrayed, when he related the
conversation that had passed between himself and the pious
Carthusian, would have determined her, had she not already by a
solemn promise bound herself to perpetual silence upon the subject,
not to disclose what she had seen and heard, lest they should confirm
his worst and most terrible surmises. From the words of the
mysterious Monk she had every thing to fear, and nothing had
happened, or was likely to happen, at present, to obviate or remove
the painful impressions which they had left upon her mind.</p>

<p>But thus being prepared to encounter calamity, she resolved, if
possible, not to yield to its influence; but, by opposing the most
vigorous efforts of her fortitude, to endure what could not be
remedied, and to gain at least, by her most strenuous endeavours, the
applause of her own heart.</p>

<p>The picture which he had delivered, she wore constantly in her
bosom, suspended by the small string of brilliants to which it was
fastened, though she so entirely concealed it in the folds of her
robe, that it could not be perceived.</p>

<p>That it was really the portrait of her mother, was beyond a doubt.
The resemblance that it bore to herself she was perfectly aware of,
for the mild pensive east of the countenance, the soft cloud upon the
brow, the smile that played upon the lip, and the expression of the
whole, were too striking to escape the penetration of the most
transient observer.</p>

<p>As Laurette fixed her eyes upon the portrait, some portion of her
former curiosity returned; she was anxious to be informed of the
destiny of her parents, though it was probable they had been long
since numbered with the dead. Her tears streamed anew when she
reflected upon her hard unhappy lot, the obscurity of her birth, her
family (if any of them were still in existence) unknown to her;
commanded to beware of the only person whom she had been taught to
revere as a protector; deprived of the guardian of her infancy and
childhood; and with no human being, except Enrico and the Father
Benedicta, to interest themselves in her welfare; and these, from the
peculiarity of their situations, precluded from affording immediate
assistance, however necessary.</p>

<p>The Signora had indeed hitherto behaved to her with uniform
kindness, and she had no reason to apprehend that it was likely to be
of short continuance; for she appeared to possess a strong and
well-informed mind, a correct judgment, not easily to be led into
error, and much feminine grace and softness, which rendered it
unlikely that she should be misled by the sophistical arguments of
designing falsehood, or be induced to yield to the influence of
decided wrong. The pains she had already taken to console and
re-assure her, were striking proofs of her friendship; and this being
one of the most substantial comforts that her lot afforded, she
resolved to endeavour to conciliate her esteem by every gentle
attention which her situation allowed.</p>

<p>To this conduct the natural sweetness of her disposition would
have directed her, unbiassed by other motives; but she now saw the
necessity of securing one friend, at least, in the place destined for
her future residence, who might be inclined to assist her on any
future emergency.</p>

<p>A gentle tapping at the door roused her from these deep and
melancholy reflections, and arising hastily from the side of the bed,
on which she had been sitting, she opened it, and beheld the Signora,
who being desirous of diverting her thoughts from the subject of her
grief, proposed a walk along the grounds. She could not, she added,
alluding to her late accident, undertake an extensive ramble beyond
the boundaries of the castle; but the day was too fine to be allowed
to pass without taking advantage of it, and she hoped she would
indulge her with her society, as she was anxious to have her opinion
respecting some intended improvements.</p>

<p>Laurette instantly assented, and succeeded so well in the
endeavour of tranquillizing her spirits, that she appeared little
less animated than usual. The fineness of the weather assisted her
efforts; and the vivacity of her companion, who exerted herself to
soften the affliction of her friend, tended to comfort and re-assure
her.</p>

<p>There was something in the manners of Laurette at once so
endearing and fascinating, that no one could be acquainted with her
without feeling for her the most lasting affection; she entered with
so lively an interest into the joys and sorrows of others, and
mingled such an amiable concern with her assiduities, so entirely
divested of art or unnatural refinement, that she appeared to the
Signora, who had been also schooled in adversity, and whose native
levity of disposition had been checked, though not entirely
annihilated, by the correcting hand of Misfortune, as one of the most
perfect creatures she had ever seen. The amiable sentiment she had
conceived for her fair young friend, induced her to dwell upon the
affecting incidents of her past life, which she had before briefly
and imperfectly related, and upon the remembrance of those sorrows,
which time had softened, but not thoroughly erased; that, by
convincing her that she was not singularly unfortunate, she might
teach her to endure her calamities with patience, and convince her
also of the possibility of finally triumphing over them.</p>

<p>By a long course of useful and extensive reading, united to an
uncommon strength of memory, she was enabled to recollect many
anecdotes in real life, and many passages from the most polished
writers and historians of the age, which made her not only an
entertaining, but an intelligent companion, every way formed to
engage the affections of our heroine, and to deserve her
confidence.</p>

<p>Having wandered for some time through the lawns and shrubberies,
and taken a general survey of the improvements, they discontinued
their walk; and music, conversation, and other innocent amusements
shortened the cares and fatigues of the day. In the evening, Laurette
avoided taking her accustomed stroll, lest she should see her ghostly
visitor, whom she determined, for the present at least, sedulously to
avoid, since so little comfort could be expected from intelligence
which she was not permitted to disclose.</p>

Which, like the needle true.

But, turning, trembles too.
--GREVILLE
</pre>

<p>Some weeks passed before Laurette heard from Enrico, and being
alarmed at this delay, she became anxious and dispirited; sometimes
fearing that the warmth of his disposition had led him into some
dangerous enterprize, and at others, that he was ill, or had met with
some unexpected obstacle in his pursuit. She was at last, however,
relieved from this painful suspense by a letter bearing his
signature, which contained no other unpleasant intelligence than that
he had been at present unsuccessful in his enquiries, though he was
not yet without hopes of obtaining the welcome information; and
concluded with desiring that she would write to him immediately, and
relate every thing that had happened.</p>

<p>She had stepped into an anti-chamber to read the epistle, and was
deeply engaged in the perusal of it, when the trampling of hoofs drew
her attention towards the window, and she perceived in the gloom of
the evening, for it was nearly dark, two men on horseback advancing
towards the gate. In one of them she imagined she recognized the
person of Paoli; but the dim grey of the twilight prevented her from
being certain that she was right in her conjecture, till she heard
him call loudly for Ambrose, and then saw him alight from his horse,
and, attended by a stranger, whom she believed to be one of the
inferior servants belonging to the Castello St Aubin, cross the
second court, and enter the private door, where she had gained
admittance on her arrival.</p>

<p>The return of Paoli, thus suddenly and unexpectedly, to the
castle, indicated, she supposed, the approach of his Lord; and
willing to be assured of the truth of the conjecture, she gained the
top of the stairs, meaning to descend and inform herself of the
whole, when an universal trembling seized her, and being unable to
proceed, she leaned upon the spiral balustrade, in that state of
breathless suspense which frequently precedes some new and
much-dreaded event. Soon afterwards she heard a passing footstep in
the hall, and saw through the iron rails, over which she bent, the
Signora ascending the foot of the stairs. Knowing that she would
afford her the gratification she desired, Laurette returned to the
room she had quitted, and seating herself on a small settee by the
fire, endeavoured to prepare herself for what might happen.</p>

<p>The looks of the Signora as she entered, announced some hasty
intelligence, and before Laurette had power to request to be made
acquainted with the nature of it, she was told that the Marchese was
already within a day's journey of the castle, and meant to reach it
on the following day; that he had sent his steward and one of the
inferior servants to apprize them of his intention, that all things
might be in readiness for his reception, and was proceeding on his
way with all imaginable speed.</p>

<p>Though this was little more than Laurette expected, the moment she
was assured it was Paoli, the certainty that the Marchese was really
upon the road, and already so near the end of his journey, almost
overcame her; and she turned suddenly so pale, that the Signora was
compelled to throw open the casement, and to lead her towards the
window. In a few minutes she revived; and after thanking her amiable
companion for her attention, consented to walk into the air.</p>

<p>Leaning upon the arm of her friend, she descended slowly the
marble stair-case, and crossing the hall, stood for a few minutes at
the portico, surveying the placid face of the heavens, illuminated
with innumerable stars, and then proceeded along the court. When she
had passed through the great gate, she turned a fearful and enquiring
eye amid the trees of the avenues, expecting every moment to see the
white robes of the Monk glaring among the dark branches of the fir or
the mountain-ash, and fancying she heard the deep tones of his voice
in the hollow murmurs of the wind, amid the faded and almost leafless
woods.</p>

<p>A small repast was prepared for them on their return, of which
Laurette scarcely partook, and soon afterwards retired to her bed.
The night was spent in broken and uneasy slumbers, the intervals of
repose were short and disturbed, and the visions of her sleep were
confused and terrible. Unrefreshed by this transient respite from
real calamity, and unable to gain any comfortable repose, she arose
by the dim light of early morning, and amused herself for some hours
in her apartment, with reading that fine, melting, and descriptive
kind of poetry, for which the bards of Italy are so highly and justly
celebrated.</p>

<p>A summons for breakfast broke in upon her solitude, and descending
into the breakfast-room, she was received by the Signora with more
than her accustomed tenderness, who mingled the most refined
compassion with her solicitude; and after a short consolatory
address, which was delivered with the most attractive gentleness,
besought her to rely upon her friendship, which she might rest
assured would never be withdrawn from her, but should be ever exerted
most sedulously for her security and happiness.</p>

<p>Laurette could only answer with her tears, for her heart was too
full for utterance, and her gratitude far beyond the powers of
expression.</p>

<p>The day was passed, as usual, in a variety of simple occupations,
but with less tranquillity than many of the preceding ones; and
towards the close of it, our heroine being in hourly expectation of
the arrival of the Marchese, repaired to an anti-chamber adjoining
the Signora's apartment, where she frequently passed many hours in
the morning, in reading, drawing, embroidery, or other works of taste
and fancy.</p>

<p>As she was amusing herself in the arrangement of some books that
were placed in a recess in the wall, she discovered, amongst the
rest, a manuscript volume bound in black, the property of the
Signora, containing a number of Poems written by herself, chiefly of
the elegiac kind, from which she selected the two following little
pieces of poetry, apparently composed by the Signora in her
affliction, after the loss of Lorenzo d'Orso and her infant son.</p>

<pre>
TO DEATH

Hail, awful Power, no human heart denies.
Who com'st unsought for, and when ask'd, denies;
Thou, who did'st give this bosom ceaseless woe.
Repress the tears which thou hast taught to flow.
Was 't not enough, with direful hand, to wrest
A beauteous infant from a mother's breast;
But must a husband, and a father, feel
Thy arm, relentless as the murderer's steel?
When first, Oh Tyrant! thy sad work began.
How thro' my veins the thrilling horror ran;
Awhile entranc'd in speechless grief I lay.
This heart forgot to beat, each pulse to play.
Till ling'ring, near her home, the vital flame
Faintly revisited her mortal frame;
These eyes, reluctant, met the op'ning light.
And long'd for slumbers of eternal night.
Oh! thou, at once the foe and friend of man.
In pity finish what thy rage began.
Oh! come, I hail thee now a welcome guest.
And with thee bring that long-sought stranger, Rest.
I ask no strains of elegiac woe.
No pensive tear on my cold urn to flow;
But young Delight shall clap his cherub wing.
And soft-ey'd virgins Hymeneals sing.
With freshest flowers shall strew the gladsome way.
And choral music melt on every spray;
Their vestal hands my hallow'd tomb prepare.
Whilst sounds celestial float upon the air.
When loosen'd from her mean companion, clay.
The soul, exulting, wings her heavenly way;
Quicker than thought, through constellations flies.
Leaves the gross air, and anchors in the skies.
Ah! come, Lorenzo, from thy bright abode.
Smooth the rude path, and lead me to my God!
Descend in all thy blaze of heavenly charms.
New woo me now to thy celestial arms;
Prepare thy roseate seats, seraphic bowers.
Nectarious sweets, and never fading flowers.
Fancy presents thy beauteous image now.
The amaranthus blooming on thy brow.
Whose varied tints surpass the Tyrian hues.
Sweeter than perfume of Arabian dews.
When the bright God of Day retires to rest.
And softly sinks on Ocean's silver breast;
When hush'd in night the stormy winds are laid.
And gentle moon-beams tremble through the shade;
If yet thy Emma claims thy guardian care.
In slumbers soft, etherial whispers bear;
Hush the rude tumults of each rising sigh.
And wrap my soul in visionary joy.


SONNET

Ah! why, sweet Philomel, that plaintive song.
Why dost thou shun the day star's glitt'ring light.
To mourn, unseen, the woodland glades among.
And tune thy vesper to the Queen of night?
Art thou too widow'd? has relentless Fate.
From thy fond breast, thy sweet companion tore?
Does faithful Memory every charm relate.
And tell of raptures thou must know no more?
If such thy woes, sweet bird, ah! yet again
Pour through the shades of Eve the liquid strain;
Still dwell like me, on long-regretted hours.
Till Morn, bright sparkling through the murky gloom.
Sheds on the zephyrs' wing her wild perfume.
And wakes, to light and life, the op'ning flowers.
</pre>

<p>The distant rolling of a carriage at last announced the approach
of the Marchese; and, in a state of mind that partook of terror,
Laurette advanced towards the lattice, and in the same moment beheld
a splendid chariot stop suddenly at the gate, and soon afterwards the
Marchese alight. The dusk of the evening, for it was past twilight,
prevented her from distinguishing his figure, any otherwise than that
he was tall, and appeared stately.</p>

<p>He did not address any of the domestics that were crowded about to
receive him, except Paoli, and then walked silently through the
courts.</p>

<p>She now waited impatiently for the Signora, anxiously listening to
every approaching footstep till near an hour had elapsed, when she
ventured into the corridor to listen if she could hear her voice.</p>

<p>An universal stillness seemed to prevail through the castle,
except in that part of it which was inhabited by the servants, from
which a loud and coarse laugh occasionally proceeded. At last the
long-expected step was heard ascending the spiral stair-case, and
Laurette, overjoyed to be released from this state of inquietude,
sprang forwards to meet her beloved friend, and to ask if any
enquiries had been made relative to herself.</p>

<p>'My Lord,' returned the Signora, 'being fatigued and indisposed,
means to retire early to his room. He has mentioned you, but has not
intimated a desire of being introduced to you this evening; you may
therefore compose yourself, my dear friend, and be assured you have
nothing to fear. In the morning I shall be enabled to give you some
further information upon the subject, and in the mean time I request
you will endeavour to fortify your mind, and not allow yourself to
yield to imaginary distresses.'</p>

<p>The Signora was in fact unacquainted with the principal cause of
her uneasiness, and consequently was not capable of forming a
judgment upon the matter; but her valuable advice was not lost upon
Laurette, who always endeavoured to profit by the virtuous precepts
and examples of others, which she always received with gratitude, and
beheld with admiration.</p>

<p>Thankful for this temporary release, and re-assured by the words
of the Signora, the night passed with less agitation than the
preceding one; and having yielded to the sweet influence of
undisturbed repose, she awoke more refreshed and tranquillized than
before, and after offering up her meek and plaintive devotions,
waited patiently for the Signora, who promised to visit her in the
morning, and to breakfast with her at the accustomed hour.</p>

<p>She entered at the appointed time, and observed, with pleasure,
that Laurette appeared less dejected than when she saw her last; and
that she was able to converse with ease, though not with vivacity,
upon indifferent subjects.</p>

<p>A summons for the casiera to attend upon the Marchese in the
saloon, put an end to all farther discourse; and Laurette requesting
that she would return to her as soon as she was again at leisure,
remained in her room, occasionally amusing herself with reading,
drawing, or in taking a survey of the rich and glowing landscape from
one of the balconies.</p>

<p>The Signora found the Marchese busily employed in looking over
some papers, which had been delivered to him by his steward, which he
laid aside as soon as she entered, and politely offered her a chair.
After some general conversation, concerning the furniture and recent
improvements at the castle, he asked carelessly about Laurette, if
she seemed satisfied with her new situation, or lamented being
removed from the Castle of Elfinbach; and then, without waiting for
an answer, reverted to the former subject, and enquired how she had
disposed of the paintings and other ornamental effects; and then
proposed taking a view of the whole range of apartments, that he
might give some directions concerning them.</p>

<p>The greater part of the day was passed by the Signora in attending
upon her Lord, who was apparently highly gratified with her judgment
and taste; though she seized every interval of leisure, and dedicated
it to the society of her lovely friend, who now determined to confine
herself to her chamber, till the Marchese should intimate a desire to
see her; secretly wishing that moment might never arrive, which had
been so long anticipated with terror. Thus devoted to solitude and
silence, she employed her time in writing to Enrico, frequently
destroying what she had written, lest it should increase his
uneasiness; and then beginning other letters, and throwing them
aside, because as little to her satisfaction as the former ones.</p>

<p>Towards the evening she entered again into the balcony, and saw,
at the farthest extent of the terrace, the Marchese in conversation
with Paoli. They were a considerable distance from her apartment, but
being unwilling to be seen by them, she retired; and closing the
casement, stood for some minutes leaning pensively over the back of a
chair, which was placed directly under the windows, contemplating the
fine features of nature, and the beautiful variety of objects it
commanded, till she saw them descend from the terrace, (which, after
extending the whole length of the edifice, wound round the western
turret, and then terminated in a gentle slope); then ascending a
winding path, hewn in the rock below, which was shaded from her view
by thick groves of fir, acacia, and pomegranate, they glided into
obscurity.</p>

<p>The Marchese, from this transient survey, seemed to be listening
to the discourse of his steward with much deference and attention,
whilst Paoli talked much; though, from distance, she could only
distinguish a faint murmur, which was accompanied with much eagerness
of gesticulation.</p>

<p>As soon as they were gone, she retired from the window, and,
stirring up the almost decayed embers, sat down by the fire, and
endeavoured to finish her epistle; but it was nearly dark, and being
compelled to defer it for the present, she resolved to conclude it on
the following day.</p>

<p>In about an hour the Signora returned to her room, with a message
from the Marchese, who desired to see her immediately, as he was
waiting to receive her in one of the lower apartments.</p>

<p>Knowing the necessity of obeying him, and having been in continual
expectation of a similar address, she summoned all her spirits to her
aid, and prepared to comply with the command.</p>

<p>They found him in one of the saloons, lounging carelessly upon a
sofa, with a book in his hand, which he appeared to be reading so
attentively that he either did not, or affected not, instantly to
observe them. The Signora's voice, however, roused him from his
abstraction, and fixing his eyes upon Laurette, with a look
expressive of surprise, he arose involuntarily as they advanced, and
led her to a seat. A silence of some moments ensued, which none
seemed disposed to interrupt, proceeding rather from embarrassment
than any other cause, till the Marchese, with many symptoms of
confusion, began to make an enquiry concerning the old castle she had
quitted; at the same time avoiding making any mention of Madame
Chamont, and then suddenly changing the discourse, as if fearful it
might lead to a subject that would be entered upon with
reluctance.</p>

<p>If he was charmed with the beautiful form of Laurette, which,
though pale with apprehension and terror, was infinitely more
charming than any thing his imagination could have portrayed, he was
not less so with her manners; and the silent admiration with which he
regarded her, though it tended to heighten her distress, increased
the natural loveliness of her person.</p>

<p>Susceptible even to weakness, the mind of the Marchese became
entirely absorbed in the contemplation of so much delicacy and
sweetness, which no recent hint had prepared him to expect; and as he
continued to observe her with an earnestness that evinced the power
of her attractions, he soon became insensible to every other
object.</p>

<p>Anxious to put an end to an interview, rendered painful by
embarrassment, Laurette arose soon afterwards, and would have
withdrawn; but this the Marchese so ardently opposed, that she was
compelled to relinquish the design, and to return, though
reluctantly, to her seat. There was something in her appearance and
demeanour so different from what his imagination had suggested, that
he continued to gaze upon her with augmenting surprise. But what was
his astonishment when that timid reserve, that retiring delicacy,
which had hitherto veiled many natural perfections, being now in some
degree conquered, she discovered what had only been transiently
obscured, a highly cultivated and accomplished mind, whose strength,
softness, and elegance gave power and energy to beauty. How much
unlike the poor, unpatronized, neglected orphan, which his fancy had
delineated; nurtured in solitude, and consigned early to grief and
misfortune, with a mind unstored with virtuous principles, and
features marked with no other expression than that of dissatisfaction
and regret, perhaps with rustic coarseness and vulgarity.</p>

<p>Nor was the interesting person of the Signora d'Orfo, or the
polished ease of her manners, unobserved or beheld with indifference,
so little expected in the humble capacity in which she had engaged;
and, as conversation awakened the powers of her mind, her superiority
over the greater part of her sex was so striking, that he resolved
almost instantaneously to make a companion of her, as well as of
Laurette, whom he now began to reflect upon with increasing
partiality.</p>

<p>When the supper hour drew near, the casiera, not forgetting the
humility of her station, arose to depart; but the Marchese prevented
her design, by desiring that she would continue with him the evening,
which request he concluded by ordering a repast to be immediately
prepared in an adjoining room.</p>

<p>This was a proposal which contained too flattering a proof of her
Lord's esteem and condescension to be received without pleasure; and
had she been disposed to have rejected it, the expressive look
conveyed by her lovely young friend, would have counteracted the
intention. Being again seated, she joined in the conversation, which
now became general, with more than her accustomed vivacity; and
Laurette, though somewhat chagrined at not being permitted to retire
when she ventured to make the attempt, being considerably re-assured
by the Signora's continuance in the party, insensibly lost much of
her reserve, and though her lovely countenance retained the same
pensiveness of expression, it was occasionally enlivened with smiles,
and lighted up with intelligence.</p>

<p>As an Italian and a woman of birth, the Signora was acquainted
with several families of consequence in Italy, which were personally
known to the Marchese. This circumstance led to much unreserved
communication, and the frankness and ease with which she delivered
her sentiments, entirely divested of that servile kind of fear which
frequently accompanies conscious inferiority, so exalted her in his
estimation, that his behaviour was at once attentive and
respectful.</p>

<p>After having partaken of a slight but elegant repast, with the
addition of some dried Italian fruits, by way of dessert, the ladies
were allowed to retire, but not without first promising to breakfast
with the Marchese on the following day.</p>

<p>As soon as they had quitted the room, the Signora could not
forbear speaking of her Lord in the highest and most respectful
terms, and awaited impatiently Laurette's opinion upon the subject,
who confessed he was more agreeable and condescending than she
expected to have found him; but it was easy to discover that her
former prejudices were not entirely removed, and, though she
acquiesced in the sentiments of her friend, her apprehensions
relative to his future conduct were not dissipated.</p>

My fair one's fascinating voice I hear.
And Fancy bids the soft lute's silver sound.
Waft her mild accents to my ravish'd ear.
Deep grav'n by Love, thy image ne'er shall fade.
While Memory in this breast maintains her seat;
And when for thee it beats not, lovely maid.
Each trembling pulse of life shall cease to beat.
--SALMAGUNDI
</pre>

<p>In the morning the ladies met in the breakfast parlour somewhat
later than the accustomed hour, and were soon afterwards joined by
the Marchese. He was more animated than on the preceding day,
discoursed with ease and elegance upon every subject that was
introduced, and directed his attentions so peculiarly to Laurette,
that her confusion and distress were evident.</p>

<p>Before she had been introduced to him, her imagination had
suggested that he was much older, and that he possessed more gravity,
and dignity of deportment. She was therefore not a little surprised
when she beheld a tall, graceful figure, of an insinuating and
fashionable address, apparently not more than forty; for the spirit
and vivacity of his countenance, when actuated by gaiety and good
humour, counteracted the effects of time, and his whole behaviour,
when solicitous to please, assisted in carrying on the deception. To
the Signora he was polite and attentive; but when he addressed
Laurette, there was an air of tenderness in his manners which he did
not attempt to disguise, and which it was impossible not to
understand.</p>

<p>The apprehensions that Enrico had suggested were now communicated
to her own heart; the temporary vivacity that had enlivened her
features soon vanished, and was succeeded by a kind of thoughtful and
tender dejection, which, so far from detracting from the natural
graces of her person, bestowed an additional delicacy and
softness.</p>

<p>The Marchese, who watched every change of expression with
undeviating assiduity, imputed this pensive cast of character to
perpetual retirement, and dwelt with energy upon the advantages
arising from an unrestrained intercourse with the world. This
sentiment was warmly applauded by the Signora, who, by enlarging upon
the subject, endeavoured to place her favourite persuasion in the
most favourable light; for if she had a weakness, it was certainly
that of possessing too great an attachment to the fashionable
elegances of life, which had lost nothing of value, but had rather
gained additional importance in her estimation, from having been long
withheld from her. It was this growing and seductive passion, so
early implanted in her nature, aided by that love of liberty so
natural to the human mind, that occasioned an invincible aversion to
a conventual life, and which taught her to submit her duty to her
inclination, by accepting the protection of a husband, without the
knowledge or acquiescence of her only surviving parent; which conduct
nothing but his unjustifiable severity could have excused.</p>

<p>The day passed without any material occurrence; the attentions of
the Marchese rather augmented than decreased, and he attempted, but
not always with success, to detach Laurette from her friend, that he
might more effectually insinuate himself into her favour and
confidence. But the melancholy he thus strove to dissipate, was by
these measures increased. She received his assiduities with coldness,
and sometimes with terror, which it was impossible to conceal or
subdue; and the animated emotion of displeasure with which she
repressed the familiarity of his advances, when respectful attention
yielded to the ardour of ungovernable passion, wounded and offended
his pride.</p>

<p>But he was too well initiated in the arts of intrigue to suffer
himself to give words to his resentment; and, as he attributed this
uniform reserve to the cause of offended delicacy, since it appeared
not to be merely the effect of solitude and inexperience, he
resolved, if no possibility existed of contaminating the angelic
purity of her mind, since she was not only the most beautiful, but
the most interesting object he had ever beheld, finally to offer her
his hand. The rank to which she would be elevated by so splendid an
alliance, he imagined, could not fail to attract and dazzle so young
and charming a creature; who, if in the slightest degree conscious of
the perfections she possessed, would doubtless be anxious to place
them in a situation where they would meet with deserved admiration,
and not continue, if an opportunity offered of placing herself
eligibly in the world, to shroud herself in silence and
obscurity.</p>

<p>On the death of the Marchesa he had indeed hastily, and too rashly
determined not to submit to what he termed the shackles of matrimony;
but other reasons, besides the extreme beauty and innocence of
Laurette, now influenced his conduct--reasons which he reluctantly
avowed even to himself; they were however sufficient to unfix his
wavering resolution; and the more he reflected upon this
newly-concerted plan, the more fascinating it appeared.</p>

<p>He still ventured to believe, that a considerable portion of
flattery, judiciously administered, might prove efficacious, as few
minds, if feminine, could resist its power. And as sophistry was not
likely to be detected by so young and inexperienced a girl,
unremitting attention to her desires, assisted by the most lavish
praises he was empowered to bestow, would eventually triumph over
that retiring diffidence of deportment, that guarded delicacy of
conduct, which was so strikingly featured in her character.</p>

<p>But, however sanguine his expectation, the artful means he
employed for the accomplishment of his purpose, not only retarded,
but prevented the success of the enterprize. What had been darkly and
mysteriously hinted, recurred frequently to her thoughts; and the
image of Enrico, noble, respectful, and tender, being presented with
all its interesting accompaniments to her mind, rendered the
solicitude of the Marchese still more unpleasant and disgusting.</p>

<p>She remembered, with satisfaction, the promise she had given him
previous to his leaving the castle; and was determined, if her new
lover deviated in the smallest degree from the nice rule of
propriety, to accept of his protection. Nothing, indeed, could
prevail upon her to alter her resolution respecting a marriage with
Enrico, before he was enabled to provide for her without involving
him in new difficulties; for though she could have been satisfied
with a very slender provision, if shared with the object of her
affections, yet her apprehensions of entering into life with
embarrassments, which might finally lead to sorrow and repentance,
when the romantic enthusiasm, peculiar to youth and inexperience,
subsided, repressed every yielding principle of her nature; and she
thought only of consigning herself, with his assistance, since she
had so little to expect from the exertions of the Marchese in his
favour, to a convent, or some other temporary place of security, till
she could fix upon some more eligible abode, or till the bars which
prevented their union were removed.</p>

<p>The letter, which had been conveyed to Enrico, did not remain long
unanswered, and she was agreeably surprised on receiving one much
sooner than she imagined it possible. This was delivered to her by
the Signora when she was alone in her apartment, and with mingled joy
and curiosity she perused the contents.</p>

<p>He informed her, in the first place, of his own situation, and
want of success in his undertaking; and then of the necessity of his
quitting Germany, at least for a short time, at the desire of the
Marchese de Martilini, his Colonel, who was prevented by
indisposition from remaining with his regiment, and was then resident
at his seat near Mantua. He had reason to fear, he added, from some
recent accounts, that his disorder was of a severe and dangerous
nature; and, from its frequent attacks, had so injured and
debilitated his constitution, that but little was to be expected from
medicinal applications.</p>

<p>An epistle, penned by an unknown hand, had acquainted him with
some circumstances which made his attendance necessary, particularly
that of the strong desire which his Colonel had expressed to see him,
and his many anxious enquiries respecting his future destination.</p>

<p>He likewise informed her, that since his departure from the Castle
of Lunenburg, a cessation of hostilities had actually commenced; and
that, in consequence of this measure, a speedy termination of the war
was universally expected, which would probably precipitate his
return, and prevent the indispensability of his future absences.</p>

<p>He then reverted to the subject of her last epistle, expressing
his astonishment at the intelligence conveyed, which was that the
Marchese de Montferrat, contrary to his original intention, meant to
reside during the winter in Germany.</p>

<p>But this was a topic too productive of uneasiness to be dwelt
upon; and that part of the paper which contained it was written over
with so disorderly a hand, that the characters which attempted to
convey those undescribable sensations of tenderness that pained and
agitated his breast, were scarcely legible.</p>

<p>Then desiring that, should any thing happen to render her present
situation unpleasant, she would recollect her former promise of
accepting his protection, whatever distance might divide them, he
gently withdrew her from the immediate cause of their mutual
uneasiness, by reverting with tender concern to those blissful
moments of juvenile felicity, which once made existence
happiness.</p>

<p>'How often, Laurette,' he continued, 'is your image presented to
me in the visions of my fancy! How often, since I have been wandering
in unsuccessful pursuits, have I dismissed Anselmo, that I might
indulge my melancholy in secret, and fastening my horse to the
sapless branches of an oak, have rambled about in the still and
silent hour of evening, endeavouring to recall the exact expression
of your countenance, to recollect the tones of your voice, and every
word you have uttered, in those charming moments of unrestrained and
mutual confidence which we have enjoyed together. Sometimes I seat
myself under the spreading branches of a larch or a sycamore, and
gaze upon the mild splendour of the setting sun, sinking gradually
from my view beneath the faded and half-foliated woods, in the sweet
hope that the same object is engaging your attention, and that I meet
you in idea.</p>

<p>'In the course of my enquiries,' continued Enrico, 'I was
imperceptibly led into the neighbourhood of your former residence, I
may also add of my own, in the days of childhood. Finding I was
within a league of the castle, an irresistible inclination directed
me to the place; and dismissing my servant on some trifling pretence,
I indulged the pensiveness of my feelings, by wandering through those
now desolated shades, where we have once held unrestrained
communication.</p>

<p>'To gain admittance into the interior of the edifice was denied
me; but with a melancholy pleasure I was enabled, through the high
gothic casements of the lower apartments, to discover dimly in the
gloom the scenes of our earliest happiness.--The furniture, every
thing remained the same, and methought I saw you indistinctly through
my tears, seated in one of the recesses in the saloon, where we have
so often sat, marking the fine tints of the sky, when the last ray of
the retiring orb had empurpled the sublime summits of the mountains,
and the blue mist of the twilight was overspreading the plains. Do
you not remember how often, in that mild and placid hour, we have
rambled over the dewy hills, marking the winding course of the river
stealing slowly along in the most romantic directions, or listening
to the sighing of the wind amongst the trees? Do you not remember,
but is it possible you can forget, how frequently we have lingered
under your favourite tree, till only the tinkling of a sheep-bell, or
the mellow tones of a flute were heard faintly from the margin of the
river or the plaintive orisons of the nightingale were warbled sadly
from the woods?</p>

<p>'Oh Laurette! the melting recollection of those moments overwhelms
me;--I sought out this spot, so tenderly endeared tome by the
grateful memorials of the past, and throwing myself on the rudely
carved bench, which was formerly so familiar to me, sat lost in
pensive reverie. Your image again presented itself to my fancy; I saw
you in that white robe which you usually wore, without any other
ornament than a knot of wild flowers, gathered from the interstices
of the mountains; a lute was in your hand, you bent over it, with one
of those smiles which are at once so seductive and fascinating, and
as the rising breeze wafted aside your locks, a blush ripened on your
cheek. How strong, how chimerical is the imagination of a lover!
methought you touched a chord of the instrument, which was answered
faintly by an echo. The sound communicated to my soul--I started from
my seat--but the angelic vision was no more; it came only for a
moment to console me, and then vanished from my sight.</p>

<p>'I know you will condemn these wild and romantic effusions of a
disordered mind; but you do not know what tender and interesting
reflections your idea imparts to it; I would not part with it to be
occasionally less wretched, because I should then lose all that can
make life desirable.'</p>

<p>In another part of his letter he adds, 'I am resolved to see you
before I visit Italy, whatever danger it may expose me to; I will
encounter the coldness, perhaps the displeasure of the Marchese, for
I find it impossible to quit Germany without one consoling glance. In
a few days after the receipt of this I may probably be with you; do
not mention my intention to any one; I wish it was possible to see
only yourself, for the necessity of my speedy arrival in Italy will
prevent my being stationary. I would desire to see you alone, and
without the knowledge of the Marchese, if I was not in danger of
hazarding your displeasure. You will not, I fear, adopt this mode of
conduct, however requisite, because it discovers a want of
openness.</p>

<p>'But why, Laurette, will you forget that I am your brother? Why
would you deprive me of the sacred power of protecting you, the
primary wish of my soul; of defending you from future injuries, or of
redressing them if committed?'</p>

<p>Towards the conclusion of the letter he gave her an account of the
convents he had visited, and of the unsatisfactory intelligence he
had received; and then finished with a request, that she would
indulge him, if possible, with a private interview, since, contrary
to his original design, he was resolved to see her immediately.</p>

<p>Laurette perused the former part of this epistle with a painful
interest, and a ray of consolation was communicated to her bosom when
she arrived at that part of it which treated of his intended visit.
But the interview, for which he pleaded so forcibly, she feared could
not be easily obtained; as the Marchese seldom left her even for a
moment, and consequently that retirement, which had been long
familiar and dear to her, could only be enjoyed in the solitude of
her own apartment.</p>

<p>Laurette was roused from these reflections by the ringing of the
dinner-bell, and before she had descended the stairs, the Marchese,
who thought every moment of her absence an age while she had been
engaged in the perusal of the letter, came forwards to conduct her
into the room which was appropriated for that purpose.</p>

<p>The empassioned glances which he cast upon her, as he advanced
forwards to lead her into the room, covered her with confusion; and
as he took her hand, on their way through the hall, it trembled so
excessively, that the animated expression of his countenance suddenly
changed, and surprise, mingled with displeasure, succeeded.</p>

<p>He would have demanded the cause of this alarm, but to avoid
interrogatories she hurried into the apartment, and seating herself
by the side of the Signora, endeavoured to conceal her chagrin by an
ill-assumed appearance of composure.</p>

<p>During the dinner hour, the Marchese, contrary to his custom,
remained totally silent, and seemed unusually thoughtful. As soon as
the cloth was withdrawn, without offering any thing of an apology, he
arose from the table, and traversed the room with a gloomy and
disordered air, regardless of the Signora and even of Laurette,
though the conversation of both was more than once directed to
himself.</p>

<p>The repulsive coldness which was so evident in the deportment of
the beautiful orphan, in spite of all his insinuating efforts to
secure her affections, at once wounded his feelings, and exasperated
his pride.--What he formerly imagined proceeded merely from native
timidity, and that chilling reserve, which usually accompanies rigid
delicacy of sentiment on the first advances of freedom, he now
attributed to a different cause.</p>

<p>Paoli having been informed of Enrico's visit at the castle, did
not fail to communicate this intelligence to his Lord, who received
it with no sensation of pleasure. From what had been related to the
steward, he appeared to have been a favoured lover; and his person
and manners being spoken of in the most flattering terms, assisted in
justifying the surmise.</p>

<p>As Paoli did not conceal the smallest circumstance from the
Marchese relative to Enrico, he soon succeeded in his intention of
inspiring him with jealousy and aversion towards the amiable young
Chevalier, which now added keenness to the various and conflicting
passions that agitated his breast.</p>

<p>Had his rival been any other than his own son, he would probably
have meditated some dreadful revenge; but the ties of blood, however
feebly cemented by the bonds of affection, prevented him from
exercising any actual cruelty, though it tended not to mitigate his
resentment, but rather added warmth to the violence of his
unrestrained passions. He had before determined to disown and abandon
him, notwithstanding his former promises were delivered with a degree
of solemnity which would have awed a mind less strong and energetic
than his own.</p>

<p>At an earlier period of existence, could he have allowed himself
time for reflection, he might possibly have shrunk from this act of
undeserved barbarity with the abhorrence it merited; but he was now
grown too familiar with vice to be shocked at, or even to detect its
natural deformity; and his love of virtue, of which it was evident he
possessed no larger a portion than what is inseparable from, and
inherent in, our natures, was so weakened by a long course of
debauchery and immorality, so secretly practised as to deceive
superficial observers; who, allured by his apparent generosity and
public benevolence of conduct, easily gave him credit for the reality
of every perfection which he found it necessary to assume; and being
thus satisfied with the outward semblance of goodness, he wanted not
only resolution, but inclination, to become virtuous.</p>

<p>Though the Marchese did not relax from his resolve respecting
Laurette, he discovered that it was requisite to adopt some new plan
for the accomplishment of his design; he easily perceived that she
regarded him with the most stoical indifference, which she now did
not attempt to disguise;--he was also conscious, that the spark of
gratitude which had once faintly beamed from her countenance was
extinguished; and, instead of appearing flattered by his attentions,
she carefully avoided giving him any opportunity of bestowing
them.</p>

<h3>Chapter 8</h3>

<pre>
Some strange commotion
Is in his brain, he bites his lip, and starts;
Stops on a sudden, looks upon the ground.
Then lays his finger on his temple; straight
Springs out into fast gait, then stops again.
Strikes his breast hard, and anon he casts
His eye against the moon: in most strange postures
We've seen him set himself.
--SHAKESPEARE
</pre>

<p>The Signora, who observed this almost immediate change in the
deportment of the Marchese, attributed it to the right cause. She
perceived, on his first interview with Laurette, the commencement of
his passion and saw, with extreme concern, the visible coldness of
her manners, and the air of unusual dejection which was delineated on
her countenance, when his assiduous attentions were more particularly
directed to her.</p>

<p>It was easy to discover, even on a superficial acquaintance, that
the passions of the Marchese were strong and invincible; and though
the Signora was totally unacquainted with his excesses, and was
equally a stranger to the insatiable cruelty of disposition he had
formerly displayed when any one dared to oppose him in his interests
or his pleasures, she had sufficiently penetrated into his character
to be aware of the danger of irritating his pride, and ventured
gently to remonstrate with her friend upon the subject.</p>

<p>She suspected the attachment which had so long tenderly subsisted
between our heroine and the handsome young Chevalier, even before she
was personally known to him, though the native delicacy of Laurette's
sentiments and feelings prevented her from openly avowing any
extraordinary prepossession in his favour. Yet as she no longer
retained, in any eminent degree, that enchanting frankness of
expression which once gave new charms to her conversation and
demeanour when in the presence of the Marchese, whose attentions
could not be misunderstood, what before was only conjecture, now
ripened into conviction.</p>

<p>The solicitude that the Signora discovered for the welfare and
happiness of her lovely favourite, was received with the most
attractive gentleness, and repayed with almost filial affection. But
when she reverted to the Marchese, dwelling upon the ardour of his
passion, and the unhappy consequence of such a rejection; which,
considering his rank, fortune, and accomplishments, could only be
occasioned by a premature attachment, a throbbing emotion agitated
the bosom of Laurette, and her tears flowed silently and fast. Since
she was now wholly in his power, the danger of exasperating his
vengeance was too evident to escape her notice, yet she could not,
however necessary, submit to the meanness of disguising her
sentiments for the sake of future advantage, or to the policy of
apparently encouraging hopes, which could not finally be
realized.</p>

<p>The Marchese was now less frequently in the society of the ladies
than on his first arrival, and even in their presence, the deep
musings of his mind so entirely abstracted him from conversation, and
threw at times such a deep gloom over his features, that Laurette
could not observe him without a sensation of awe, mingled with
terror. He was frequently closeted with his steward for many hours in
the day; and when he returned into the saloon, his dark piercing eyes
assumed a ferocious and dreadful appearance, so different from their
former expression, that no one presumed to address him, except Paoli,
who possessed over his Lord an unlimited power; and, by constant and
unremitting perseverance, was enabled to prosecute his purposes with
all imaginable ease and success.</p>

<p>The aspect of the Marchese now indicated the most restless
inquietude; he often started wildly from his seat, without any
apparent cause, answered widely from the subject if a question was
directed to him, which was never unnecessarily the case, and threw
his eyes strangely around the room, like a man newly awakened from a
dream, as if his whole soul was absorbed in some desperate and
important enterprize, which he was alarmed lest any one should
penetrate.</p>

<p>It was after one of these secret interviews with the steward, that
the Marchese informed the Signora of his intention of visiting the
old castle on the Rhine; having some thoughts of rendering it
habitable, that he might occasionally retire to it as a summer
residence: at the same time requesting, that she would prepare to
accompany him thither on the succeeding day, as he wished to have her
opinion and assistance respecting the alterations.</p>

<p>He slightly asked Laurette if she would consent to be of the
party; and, on her modestly declining it, left the room to give some
farther orders to Paoli, without repeating the invitation.</p>

<p>Having betrayed no symptoms of anger or resentment, the expected
consequence of her refusal, a ray of comfort was conveyed to the
bosom of Laurette; since she had been for some days in hourly
expectation of Enrico, and had now an opportunity of seeing him alone
without the knowledge of the Marchese.</p>

<p>To remain at the castle during his absence was a privilege so
unhoped for, that she could with difficulty conceal her satisfaction.
But how must she inform Enrico of her new cause of apprehension,
without augmenting his distress? though to avoid entering upon a
subject, in which he was so nearly interested, would be utterly
impossible, since he would assuredly introduce it, and reluctance on
her part would naturally kindle curiosity and lead to conjecture.</p>

<p>When the morning arrived, the family assembled early in the
breakfast room, and, as soon as they had partaken of the usual
repast, the carriage being in readiness, the Marchese informed
Laurette that they meant to return at the expiration of a week, and
seating himself by the side of the Signora, drove from the gate.</p>

<p>As soon as the chariot was out of sight, though she had reason to
lament the absence of her friend, the beautiful orphan felt as if
released from a long and mournful captivity; joy once more played
about her heart, and forgetting for the moment the presaging aspect
of the future, she yielded to the new and sweet emotion.</p>

<p>The only unpleasant circumstance with which this indulgence was
attended, arose from the presence of Paoli, who, contrary to her
expectation, received no orders to attend his Lord; but as he did not
often obtrude himself into her company, she reflected upon it with
less uneasiness, and, being alone, began to form some plan as to her
future conduct.</p>

<p>It was now the beginning of November, and the winds blowing chill
and bleak from the mountains, prevented her from frequenting her
favourite solitary walks; she sometimes, indeed, strolled along the
lawn, or through the thick shades of the shrubberies; but the cold
and drizzly rains, and the thick mists that pervaded the atmosphere,
made her fearful of continuing her rambles. When the weather did not
permit her to extend them, she observed, not without some
astonishment, that she was followed at an inconsiderable distance by
Paoli, who seemed to watch her movements whenever she advanced along
the grounds with the most uniform scrutiny, as if anxious to avail
himself of every opportunity of observing them, when she was the
least apprehensive of his intention. He never, however, attempted
entering into any conversation with her, even when aware of her
notice; but this restraint upon her actions, which was evidently the
result of design, confined her almost constantly to her
apartment.</p>

<p>With somewhat of impatience she now awaited the arrival of Enrico,
and when several days had elapsed, began to reflect upon his absence
with grief and disappointment. Something might have happened since he
had last written, to have prevented the execution of his design; but
his not acquainting her with the occasion of his absence, when he had
so expressly declared his resolution of visiting her, was an omission
for which she could by no means account.</p>

<p>The week now drew rapidly to a close, yet still he did not appear;
and, as she was hourly apprehensive of the return of the Marchese,
she began rather to dread, than to desire the performance of his
promise.</p>

<p>One evening when it was nearly dark, as she was standing at the
window of her apartment, she perceived, at some distance, a tall
figure in a white garment, stealing slowly through a copse beyond the
boundaries of the castle, as if desirous of concealment.--This she
was convinced could be no other than the Monk who had formerly
forewarned her of the danger of her situation, and whom she had of
late studiously avoided.</p>

<p>As she continued to observe him, he advanced nearer, and entering
a small gate, at the extremity of the walls, swept hastily along the
grounds till he had reached a thick grove of evergreens which led to
the southern side of the building, when he suddenly stopped, and
remained stationary.</p>

<p>It now occurred to her mind, that the reason why she was so
narrowly watched by Paoli was, that by this means he might be enabled
to prevent a future interview with the Monk, which, from some cause,
she was incapable of investigating, and which was known only to the
Marchese and himself, was thus carefully to be hindered from taking
effect.</p>

<p>Curiosity, from a second review of the subject, triumphed for the
moment over every other consideration, and she felt an irresistible
inclination to descend, and hear him unfold the important secret,
which he was before prevented from disclosing.</p>

<p>As she still ruminated upon this singular event, new fortitude was
communicated to her mind; and leaving the room with an assumed
appearance of calmness, she resolved, if by any means the vigilance
of her tormentor could be eluded, who, as it was night, would
probably not suspect her of rambling from the castle, to go
immediately to the place.</p>

<p>Scarcely had she descended the stairs before her resolution
forsook her, and fear and terror took possession of her faculties.
The little advantage that might possibly attend such a discovery, and
the dangers which might arise from this mode of procedure, in the
calmer moments of reflection, compelled her to abandon the design;
and she was returning pensively to the apartment she had quitted,
without attempting to gratify her curiosity, when the rolling of a
carriage announced the arrival of the Marchese.</p>

<p>Paoli ran instantly to the gate to welcome his Lord, whilst
Laurette, who experienced a slight degree of surprise and
disappointment, remained fixed to the spot.</p>

<p>In a few moments he entered the great hall, attended by his
steward, whom he hastily called aside, without apparently observing
any other, whilst Laurette waited to receive the Signora at the door
of the saloon.</p>

<p>Surprised that she did not appear, she proceeded towards the
portal, and made an enquiry of one of the servants, who informed her,
to her unspeakable grief and astonishment, that she was left at the
Castle of Elfinbach, and was to remain there till the ensuing week,
for the purpose of overlooking the repairs.</p>

<p>The glaring impropriety of her situation now filled the
unfortunate Laurette with new terrors; she trembled, lest the
Marchese had adopted this plan that he might continue his
persecutions successfully, and more than ever distracted with
tormenting apprehensions, she entered the saloon, and throwing
herself upon a sofa, which was fixed in a recess under a window,
burst into an agony of tears.</p>

<p>Having remained there some time, she heard steps in the hall which
advanced nearer, and believing it to be the person whom she most
dreaded to see, arose hastily, and endeavoured to open the window
which descended to the ground that she might effectuate an escape;
but the attempt was in vain, and the presence of the Marchese
prevented her from retreating by any other means.</p>

<p>He entered with an air of easy confidence, and as Laurette
tremblingly advanced forwards to welcome him, he led her courteously
to a seat, and then placed himself by her side. A deep blush now took
possession of her features; she cast her beautiful eyes upon the
ground, and a sigh, that refused to be suppressed, agitated her
bosom.</p>

<p>The Marchese, after gazing upon her for some time with a look of
earnest tenderness, took her hand, and would have pressed it to his
lips, but she withdrew it hastily from his grasp, and a look of
displeasure awed him into forbearance.</p>

<p>'By heaven this is too much!' cried the Marchese; 'Laurette, you
are cruel--you are unjust;--you know I love you; my passion I have
never attempted to conceal, though it has been chilled with the most
provoking indifference. But, in spite of all your reserve, I cannot
believe you mean seriously to reject me; and to convince you that the
proposals I mean to make are as honourable as advantageous, I now
offer you my hand. Consent then, beautiful Laurette,' resumed he,
softening his voice, and regarding her with a look of ineffable
tenderness, 'to become the Marchesa de Montferrat, and to accept of a
situation which every other woman would embrace with transport.'</p>

<p>Keener agony now suppressed her utterance; her silence encouraged
the hopes of the Marchese, who watched every turn of her countenance
with the utmost impatience, and taking again the resisting hand she
had withdrawn, besought her to determine immediately.</p>

<p>Her answer was at once gentle and decisive: she acknowledged the
honour he was solicitous to confer, but conjured him not to distress
her by a repetition of his request, which would inevitably be
productive of uneasiness, and could never be attended with
success.</p>

<p>The firmness of her tone and manner surprised and offended him;
the attachment, which he suspected had early subsisted between her
and Enrico, could only account for this conduct. Anger was again
kindled in his breast; the submissive tenderness of deportment which
he had assumed, vanished, whilst resentment and ungovernable pride
struggled for concealment.</p>

<p>He did not, however, yield without reflection to their influence,
but with all the eloquence he could command, pleaded forcibly his
cause, assiduously endeavouring to remove every obstacle which her
imagination could suggest. But to each new argument she replied with
the same decisive coldness, without assigning the reasons that
actuated her, though he frequently demanded them in a tone of
authority and displeasure.</p>

<p>Finding that she was not to be wrought upon by any means that had
been hitherto employed, resentment, no longer to be restrained, burst
forth with unbridled energy; his breast heaved with contending
emotions, which he found it impossible to resist, and a deep
indignant glow animated his expressive features.</p>

<p>'You are then determined to reject my suit,' resumed the Marchese,
rising hastily from his seat, and fixing his eyes upon her's with a
keen and penetrating glance.</p>

<p>'You have already received an answer, my Lord,' replied Laurette,
'and why should I irritate you by repeating it? You have hitherto
protected me, and have, from that circumstance, a claim upon my
gratitude. I was taught, from the earliest period of my existence, to
consider you as my only surviving friend; and, when personally
unknown to you, to honour and revere you as a parent;--forgive me
when I say no other sentiment can be excited; and permit me also to
add, that if you wish for my esteem, you must instantly desist from
farther persecution.'</p>

<p>Rage and exasperated pride now deprived him of utterance; and as
he still continued to pace the room with a perturbed and agitated
step, Laurette, willing to take advantage of this silence, arose and
would have retired. But this he resolutely opposed, and fastening the
door to prevent a similar attempt, compelled her to return to her
seat.</p>

<p>New terror now took possession of her mind; but knowing that
resistance would be vain, and remonstrance equally ineffectual, she
ventured not to dispute his authority. As he still continued to
traverse the room, apparently musing upon some new project, an
universal trembling seized her, and scarcely dared she to raise her
eyes from the ground, lest they should meet his dreadful and
indignant glances.</p>

<p>A Venetian mirror that was placed on the opposite side of the
saloon, over which was suspended an Etruscan lamp, dimly reflected
his figure, which was altogether more stern and terrible than her
fancy could have formed:--His cloak hung loosely from his shoulder,
his plume waved haughtily over his brow, whilst his darkened
countenance, that expressed all the energies of a soul refusing to be
subdued, was strongly marked with rage, jealousy, and revenge. In a
few minutes he started from his reverie, and placing himself upon the
sofa, again demanded her reasons for rejecting him.</p>

<p>'You have already heard them, my Lord,' replied Laurette, mildly.
'My answer, I think, was sufficiently decisive; and, as I have no
more to add upon the subject, I must request your permission to
retire.'</p>

<p>'Presumptuous girl!' interrupted the Marchese, in a voice half
stifled with resentment, 'will you still persist in this daring
obstinacy? Do you dispute my power, or is it that you have a young
Chevalier at hand to protect you?'</p>

<p>As he uttered these words, which were accompanied with a
disdainful and sarcastic smile, a faint glow tinged the cheek of
Laurette; the tremulous sensation that was stealing upon her spirits
prevented her from framing an immediate answer; but the integrity of
her mind invested her with new fortitude, and as he paused with his
eyes fixed upon her innocent and blushing face, as if awaiting her
reply, she endeavoured so far to command her feelings as to give it
with dignity. When she had regained some portion of her native
composure, she attempted to convince him of the impossibility of
gaining her affections by this arbitrary conduct, or indeed by any
other mode that could be adopted; at the same time requesting him not
to compel her to lose all esteem for his character, as she should
unwillingly relinquish the favourable impression, and this could only
be prevented by a promise on his part never to resume the
subject.</p>

<p>'Do you forget,' returned the Marchese, emphatically, 'your orphan
and dependant state? Do you forget that you are without friends,
fortune, or connections? that there is not a being existing on whom
you have any claim for protection--none who, from any other motive
than that of common humanity, would preserve you from the miseries of
neglect and poverty? Have I not hitherto defended you from these; and
have I not a right to be obeyed?'</p>

<p>'I am not insensible to these obligations,' replied Laurette,
weeping, 'and I would not willingly have any thing happen to cancel
them; I would feign consider you as a tender and disinterested
friend, still honour you as the guardian of my helpless infancy--but
as a lover, my Lord, I must not, indeed I cannot return the affection
with which you have honoured me.</p>

<p>'You must not, and you cannot!' repeated the Marchese, with deeper
emphasis, whilst jealousy and rage lent all their fury to his
countenance 'But your reason for persisting in this refusal is
evident; some wretch has pilfered those affections which ought to
have been mine; and by heaven he shall not escape my revenge.
Laurette, you either accede to my wishes, or you are thrown from my
protection, not into the arms of your lover (for I will pursue him
with unabating vengeance), but into a situation sufficiently remote
to elude his most arduous researches; where, after lingering in
obscurity, you will live and die unknown and unlamented. Recollect
that I will no longer be trifled with; I have dedicated too much of
my time already to the indulgence of your caprice; and from
henceforth, if you still continue to practise it, I will assume the
tyrant. Hitherto I have meanly descended to supplicate, in hopes of
inspiring you with a mutual attachment, but my mind has regained its
energy; consider me then no longer as your slave, but remember I
expect, nay command your obedience, and that a contrary conduct will
be attended with the punishment it merits.'</p>

<p>Laurette heard not the latter part of the sentence, for she had
fainted; the assurance that Enrico would be involved in her
misfortunes, to whom he certainly alluded, quite overcame her, and
she sunk lifeless upon the sofa.</p>

<p>The Marchese, unwilling to call for assistance, made many
fruitless attempts to recall her to life; and taking her into his
arms, ventured to open the folds of her robe for freer respiration.
Whilst he continued to support her, with his arm encircling her
waist, anxiously gazing upon her colourless form, and impatiently
awaiting the glow of animation which had formerly added such
loveliness to her person, the string of brilliants, that was
suspended round her neck, attracted his attention; and, not doubting
but the portrait of Enrico was fastened to it, he snatched it hastily
from her bosom, and starting, as if he had seen an apparition, let it
fall involuntarily from his hand. A faint struggle now indicated
returning life, and the Marchese taking immediate advantage of it,
demanded how she had obtained the possession of that picture.</p>

<p>'The picture, my Lord,' replied Laurette, 'what picture?'</p>

<p>'That which was concealed in your bosom,' returned the Marchese,
sternly, 'by whom was it delivered? Speak, I command you,
instantly.'</p>

<p>'Alas! I know not,' sighed Laurette, scarcely knowing what she had
uttered; 'it is the portrait of my mother.'</p>

<p>'The portrait of your mother,' repeated the Marchese; 'and who
informed you that the Contessa della Caro was your mother--who has
dared to utter such a falsehood? tell me this instant from whom you
have received this intelligence, or expect the severest inflictions
that rage and disappointment can suggest?'</p>

<p>The deep and dreadful tones of his voice when ascending the climax
of passion, so agitated and alarmed Laurette, that she relapsed into
a state of insensibility, and the Marchese having employed many
ineffectual means to restore her to life, was compelled to call for
assistance.</p>

<p>In this lifeless condition she was conducted to her apartment by
one of the women of the castle, and, gradually reviving, retired to
her bed. When she was alone, and began to meditate upon the Marchese,
dislike arose into abhorrence; and though she felt that she must
inevitably suffer, she trembled less for her own fate than for that
of Enrico. If she persisted in refusing the hand of her persecutor,
she knew there was nothing to be expected from his clemency. He had
threatened to convey her to some remote and dreary solitude, where
she was to be left, without pity, to all the horrors of her wayward
destiny. To what place did he allude when he assured her, with
menaces, that it was beyond the reach of her lover? The astonishment
and terror that was delineated on his countenance, on the discovery
of the picture, was also food for conjecture. He declared that it was
the Contessa della Caro, but denied that it was her mother with a
degree of vehemence which tended rather to frighten than convince.
Unable to solve this inexplicable mystery, she endeavoured to find
comfort in repose; but it was long before she was relieved by slumber
from these harassing and tormenting apprehensions.</p>

<h3>Chapter 9</h3>

<pre>
Whither should I fly?
I've done no harm! But I remember now
I'm in this earthly world, where to do harm
Is often laudable, to do good, sometimes
Accounted dangerous folly; why then, alas!
Do I put up this womanly defence
To say I've done no harm? what mean
These faces?
--SHAKESPEARE
</pre>

<p>Laurette arose with the first blush of early morning, and not
daring to quit the apartment, sat pensively by the side of her bed,
meditating upon a train of anticipated evils, which it was impossible
either to conquer or dispel. The melancholy sensation which the
conversation of the preceding evening had excited, having obtained a
transient respite by repose, returned to her waking faculties with
severer poignancy, and grief of the most corrosive nature overwhelmed
her heart.</p>

<p>Enrico, suffering for her offences, was incessantly presented to
her tortured imagination. She perused his letter again and again,
endeavouring, though without success, to inform herself of the
occasion of his absence, and still more of his unaccountable
silence.</p>

<p>A strange and fatal presage told her they should meet no more; she
pressed the paper to her bosom, sighed, and wetted it with her tears,
and then breathing a prayer for his preservation, arose from the bed
on which she had been sitting, and attempted, in the contemplation of
the variegated scenery which was exhibited from her window, to
abstract her thoughts from those agonizing reflections that could no
longer be endured.</p>

<p>The morning was chill, and the sun shot only a pale and uncertain
ray, yet it was peaceful and serene; and as none of the inhabitants
of the castle were visible, she descended into the balcony, and gazed
upon the tranquil face of the heavens with a devout and tender
emotion.</p>

<p>'The season, like her fortunes, had fallen into the sear, the
yellow leaf'; yet, though the glow of maturity was past, some remains
of vegetation appeared groves of fir, laurel, and other evergreen
shrubs, were thinly scattered upon the hills that inclosed the walls
of the mansion, whilst the spires of distant convents, seen only from
the woods when divested of their honours, added grandeur and beauty
to the landscape.</p>

<p>All was serene and gentle; yet tinged with the melancholy that
assailed her bosom, all appeared desolate and mournful. With a
pensive and dejected air she leaned over the rails of the balcony,
endeavouring to find some single object that might fix her attention,
and soften the acute pangs of piercing reflection; but the woods, the
rocks, and the mountains were too familiar to her eye to have the
wished-for effect, and, except the low warblings of the autumnal
songsters, no sound, not even the pipe of the goatherd, broke upon
the stillness of the morning.</p>

<p>Finding no possibility of soothing herself into a transient
forgetfulness of her present sorrows, or of softening the
recollection of those hours now fled for ever--hours, in which she
had enjoyed happiness as exquisite as pure, she yielded to the
softness that oppressed her feelings, sometimes pronouncing the name
of Enrico in accents so tremulous that she was scarcely conscious of
having uttered it, and at others that of Madame Chamont, the amiable
guide of her inexperience, whose ill-starred destiny she still
severely, though secretly, lamented.</p>

<p>Resolved not to quit her room without the express orders of the
Marchese, she attempted to amuse herself with sketching some of the
finest features of the landscape before her; but enervated by
affliction, her trembling hand was unable to direct the pencil; she
endeavoured to read, but her attention wandered from the subject, and
she was finally compelled to resign every former source of
gratification, because they had lost their accustomed power.</p>

<p>The picture, which seemed to have led to some fatal discovery,
still hung in her bosom. She often drew it from its place, and gazed
mournfully upon the sweet expressive face, and having no doubt but it
was her mother, and from what had involuntarily escaped the lips of
the Marchese, that it was the Contessa della Caro, though he
positively denied that it was the portrait of her unknown parent.</p>

<p>But however the practice of guilt and hypocrisy may enable a man
to wear the mask of falsehood so successfully as to deceive the
greater part of the world, events for which he is totally unprepared,
frequently, by their suddenness, may surprise him into confession.
The language of nature is indelibly engraven on the human
countenance, and however the slave of vice and insincerity may hope
to seclude it from the eagle eye of Truth, there are moments when the
mask of dissimulation will drop, and the unfortunate being who has
taken refuge under so weak a subterfuge, if not totally abandoned to
irremediable guilt, will be covered with the blushes of shame and
dishonour.</p>

<p>The Marchese, for the moment off his guard by his own
inadvertency, betrayed a secret which the wealth of the world could
not have wrested from him; for though his selfish love of pleasure
was unbounded, and his schemes for the means of obtaining it were
deep and unsearchable, reputation was the leading principle of his
mind, the soul of his existence, and none but the immediate victims
of his cruelty were thoroughly acquainted with his excesses.</p>

<p>When Laurette considered the various inconsistences of the
Marchese's conduct, her candid and inexperienced mind found it
difficult to analyse his character: one moment he was solicitous to
please, the next haughty and reserved; his countenance now beaming
with tenderness, and lighted up by gaiety and animation; the next
instant, if not meeting with that attentive regard which he
considered as his due, darkened with anger, vexation, and
disappointment.</p>

<p>Had no prior attachment removed a marriage with so capricious a
tyrant almost beyond the bounds of possibility, she would have
instantly rejected him; for her mind was too pure and unambitious to
barter the treasures of contentment for wealth or precedence, and to
forsake the substance of happiness for the shadow; though she was too
prudent to enter into a matrimonial engagement, even to save herself
from the present evils of her destiny, till there appeared a
probability of effecting it without involving the object of her
tenderest attachment in new and severe difficulties.</p>

<p>Laurette had remained the greater part of the day alone in her
apartment, without receiving any orders to leave it; in which time no
one intruded upon her retirement, except the servant who conveyed her
food, of whom she ventured to enquire if the Marchese was below, and
whether any thing had been mentioned relative to herself.</p>

<p>The young woman informed her, with many symptoms of compassion,
that her Lord had been, for the last half hour, in private
conversation with Paoli; that his thoughts seemed to be employed on
some important concern, as he scarce partook of a morsel at dinner,
and as soon as it was removed, called again for his steward, in whose
society he had spent some hours in the morning, and whose presence
appeared more than usually necessary.</p>

<p>Conceiving herself to be the subject of their discourse, Laurette
answered only with a sigh; and not doubting but that some new misery
was preparing for her, endeavoured to arm her mind with a sufficient
portion of fortitude to sustain it with serenity.</p>

<p>Next to the hated marriage with which she had been threatened,
nothing seemed so dreadful to her terrified imagination as a removal,
without the knowledge of Enrico, to a remote and dreary solitude; yet
more than ever convinced, that if she persisted in her resolution of
rejecting his proposals, this, or some other situation not less
hopeless, would be selected for her, she once half resolved to
attempt an escape from the castle, and to endeavour to gain admission
into a convent; but the little chance of success which this method of
proceeding offered to maturer reflection, prevented her from putting
it into practice. Could she be so fortunate as to elude the vigilance
of her haughty protector, the Argus-eyed Paoli would detect her
design before it was carried into execution; and even was it possible
that she should so far succeed as to gain some religious retirement,
few Superiors, she feared, were sufficiently disinterested to receive
a poor unpatronized female, however unhappy her situation, without a
friend to speak in her behalf, or the possession of any property by
which she might be enabled to pay for her maintenance. And was she to
throw herself upon the compassion of strangers, of an humbler rank of
life, who would dare to admit her, and much less to harbour her, when
the danger of incurring the displeasure of the Marchese would be the
price of their hospitality? And even should any one be so blind to
their immediate interests as to listen to the soft pleadings of
humanity, could she, wrapped in temporary security, act so
inconsistently with her own exalted sentiments, as to expose such
benevolence and refined generosity to his unbridled resentment?</p>

<p>These considerations determined her to abandon the design, and to
wait with humility for the interposition of Providence in her behalf,
in whom, she had been taught early, to place an unlimited
reliance.</p>

<p>'Why do I tremble at the future,' cried the beautiful sufferer,
with that firmness and dignity inseparable from true greatness, 'when
I know that there is an Omnipotent Power who governs the world with
wisdom and equity, and who frequently turns the dark designs of the
wicked from their original bias, to the advantage of oppressed and
unrepining innocence.</p>

<p>'Forgive me, holy Saint,' resumed she, falling meekly upon her
knees before a small image of Saint Rosalie, 'forgive me if I have
dared to murmur; and Oh! infuse into my heart that pure and heavenly
virtue which taught thee to endure calamity with patience, and even
with transport. Shall I presumptuously repine when I look around,
and, in the narrow sphere of my observation, see others suffering the
extreme of misery, and expect exemption from the common lot of
mortality?--No, let me rather endeavour to fortify my mind with those
invaluable principles of religion which were instilled into my heart,
from the earliest period of my existence, by my first and dearest
friend. And may I, as the only proof of gratitude I am enabled to
bestow, cherish her inestimable precepts as much as I revere her
memory! and if she is already released from the shackles of
mortality, and is become the companion of angels, may she look down
with compassion upon her adopted child, strengthen her weak resolves,
and lead her, by secret inspiration, to that excelling and unassuming
piety which dignified her character!'</p>

<p>With a mind elevated above the narrow boundaries of the earth,
Laurette arose from her knees, and walked again towards the lattice.
The day was still fine, and her feelings being somewhat tranquillized
with these meek effusions of devotion, she surveyed the placid face
of Nature with a sensation of pleasure.</p>

<p>Knowing that the Marchese, when in secret conference with his
steward, frequently remained some hours in his closet, she resolved
to descend, by a private stair-case, and, if she was fortunate enough
to escape unobserved, to amuse herself with a ramble through the
grounds.</p>

<p>Having executed her purpose unperceived by all, except the lower
order of domestics, she bent her steps towards the pavilion, and
entering the banqueting-room, seated herself upon a small settee that
was placed under a canopy.</p>

<p>Every thing remained the same as when she left it last, which was
on the morning when she parted with Enrico. The Marchese and the
Signora had been there in the interval, but nothing appeared to have
been displaced. The leaves of music still lay scattered upon the
table, the lute lay neglected upon a corner of the sofa, and her
imagination could have almost portrayed the form of Enrico sitting
pensively in the place which he had so recently occupied. His looks,
his words, his attitudes, returned with all their pathetic interest
to her memory, and connected his idea with more than usual
tenderness.</p>

<p>Till the moment when she was taught to feel the most dreadful
apprehensions for his safety, she was not wholly acquainted with the
extent of her attachment; she had deluded herself into the
suggestion, that she loved him only with the affection of a sister,
as the companion of her infantine felicities, and as the son of her
maternal friend. But now that danger was suspended over his head,
which threatened finally to crush him, she acknowledged a warmer and
more tender sentiment in his favour.</p>

<p>Unable to continue long in a place, rendered too interesting by
sadly pleasing recollections, she reached the extent of the building,
and found in the apartment, beyond the room of state that she had
quitted, a small pocket volume of Italian miscellanies, which she
remembered to have seen in the hand of Enrico on the morning
preceding his departure. She opened it with an emotion of joy, and as
his name, which was inserted in the blank leaf, met her eye, resolved
to avail herself of what she esteemed an inestimable treasure, by
securing it in her pocket.</p>

<p>Afraid of being observed if she remained longer in her present
situation, she would have retreated by the way she had entered, but
voices approaching the pavilion prevented her design; and, before she
had time to recover from the breathless agitation of spirits this
unexpected incident occasioned, she distinguished the tones of the
Marchese, and soon afterwards those of Paoli.</p>

<p>Alarmed lest they should enter the apartment she occupied, and her
inadvertency by these means expose her to new evils, she endeavoured
gently to open the door leading into the shrubbery, in the hope that
she might be able to secret herself among the trees, till an
opportunity offered to favour an escape. But it was locked, and the
key being removed, she was compelled to remain in the pavilion
carefully avoiding any noise which might lead to detection.</p>

<p>Though Laurette could not descend to the meanness of voluntarily
overhearing conversation supposed to be private, there being only a
thin partition wall between the room she had chosen, and that
occupied by the Marchese, it could not easily be prevented, and she
was obliged, however reluctantly, to submit to what appeared
unavoidable.</p>

<p>When apparently in the most earnest discourse, they spoke low, as
if afraid of being overheard, though unconscious that any one was
near; and some disjointed sentences, which seemed to be of dreadful
import, were occasionally communicated to her ear.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards she heard her own name hesitatingly pronounced,
followed by Enrico's; and curiosity triumphing over the nicer
feelings of her mind, directed her involuntarily towards the
door.</p>

<p>A short silence succeeded, which was at length broken by Paoli,
who uttered something in a low key which she could not clearly
understand, and then exalting his voice, he added--'You are well
aware, my Lord, of the necessity of this measure; why then do you
hesitate to adopt the only possible means of ensuring you safety and
reputation? Some discovery fatal to your peace has been made--her
silence, as well as her indifference, confirms the justice of the
suspicion; she is treacherous, my Lord, and every thing is to be
feared from the artifice of a designing woman. That softness of
character, which she assumes at discretion, is it not worn as a veil
to conceal the blackness of her intentions? and is happiness to be
obtained in a state of continual fear?'</p>

<p>'To what would you advise me?' replied the Marchese, in a voice
agitated with contending passion; 'have I not already given orders
for her removal; to what further would you urge me?'</p>

<p>'To secure your own safety beyond the reach of circumstance,'
returned the steward; 'to teach you to act consistently with those
exalted ideas of independence, which have hitherto aggrandized your
character. Do you cease to remember, my Lord, that self-preservation
is one of the first laws of Nature, that it is wisely interwoven with
our existence for reasons too forcibly to be rejected, and becomes
the master-spring of all our actions? If a venomous insect assaults
us, do we not annihilate it? Who, but a maniac, would feel the sting
of a serpent, and not endeavour to release him self from its
grasp?--Would any one, not divested of reason, endanger his own life
by listening to the plea of humanity? If an assassin attacks us with
the weapons of death, and we succeed in disarming him, do we not
instantly sheath the stiletto in his breast; do we feel any thing of
remorse or pity, when we behold it reeking with the blood of an
enemy? I need add no more, my Lord; you must assuredly understand me;
there are means to prevent the evils which threaten you--it is you
that are to apply them.'</p>

<p>'There are means,' repeated the Marchese, 'but they are dreadful
ones; yet, if it must be done, let it be done quickly; I would feign
not think of it again till it is beyond recall. Let me be acquainted
with the time and place, and then let the subject drop for ever.'</p>

<p>'About seven leagues from this spot,' continued Paoli, 'is a house
every way fitted for the purpose: it stands in a lonely and dreary
forest, and is fenced out from the civilized world by wild and almost
inaccessible woods. These are sometimes infested by banditti, but
never with any other human being; the beasts of the deserts are their
only inhabitants, and scarcely a vestige of man is to be found. Here
Silence has fixed her abode, disturbed only at intervals by the
howling of the wolf, or the cry of the vulture. In such a situation
actions have no witnesses; these woods are no spies. You understand
me, my Lord?'</p>

<p>'I do,' returned the Marchese, with seeming emotion; 'but the
time, have you thought of that?'</p>

<p>'Any time, my Lord, to-morrow.'</p>

<p>'To-morrow!' exclaimed the Marchese; 'Ah to-morrow, or tonight, it
cannot be too soon. I leave this business to you; but I command you,
let me hear of it no more till it is executed--I would fain escape
from the recollection.'</p>

<p>They now quitted the pavilion; and Laurette, anxious to hear the
whole of the conference, since she was certainly the subject of it,
listened in hopes of catching another sentence; but their voices,
after being imperfectly heard from the opposite side of the building,
grew fainter, and were soon lost in distance.</p>

<p>With trembling limbs, that could scarcely support her agitated
frame, she gained the door of the pavilion, when a death-like
faintness prevented her from proceeding, and she was obliged to lean
against one of the pillars of the portico for support. Somewhat
revived by the cool breeze, she looked fearfully around, and being
assured that the Marchese and Paoli were returned to the castle,
began to reflect upon the dangers with which she was surrounded, and
to consider if there was any possibility of eluding them.</p>

<p>Death, in its most terrifying form, was presented to her
affrighted imagination; and being convinced that, if she continued
longer in the power of her persecutors, it would be inevitable, she
determined to attempt an escape. Fear gave new swiftness to her
motions, and with rapidity, almost incredible, she ran, or rather
flew to the small arched door, which was usually unfastened, and was
the direct road from the castle. But this being locked, hope, the
only balm of affliction, forsook her, and had she not felt the
indispensible necessity of actual exertion, this new disappointment
would have overthrown her purpose. But the certain danger of delay
animated her resolves; and, however improbable it appeared that she
could effectuate an escape, unobserved, from the principal entrance,
she ventured to make a similar attempt. But here also she was denied
admittance; and being unable either to proceed or to return, in a
state of inconceivable suffering she threw herself upon a grassy
acclivity, under the shade of a larch, and endeavoured to reflect
upon some probable means of avoiding the horrors of her destiny. But
she was unable to direct her thoughts to any point that was likely to
lead to preservation; the gate of mercy seemed to be closed against
her, and the knife of the assassin ready to be plunged into her
innocent and unoffending bosom.</p>

<p>As Paoli, for what cause she was incapable of ascertaining,
appeared to be a more formidable enemy than even the Marchese
himself, who seemed, from the conversation in the pavilion, to have
betrayed some symptoms of remorse and pity, she once half resolved to
throw herself at the feet of her haughty lover, to convince him, if
possible, that she was innocent of the crimes alledged against her;
and that no attempt, on her part, to investigate circumstances
intended for concealment, had justly rendered her an object of
resentment. But the knowledge of his disposition, which she had
already obtained, was sufficient to dismiss the forlorn hope which
had been recently conveyed to her heart. For even was she allowed to
see the Marchese, which was an indulgence the wary steward was not
likely to grant, lest it should unfix the wavering purpose of his
Lord, there appeared but a small degree of probability in the
supposition that she would be enabled to interest his compassion,
without making another sacrifice more dreadful to her than that of
life itself.</p>

<p>No prospect of effecting her safety by her own efforts, nor any
human assistance appearing, she could not acquire resolution to stir
from the place; but continued to sit, with her pale cheek resting
upon her still whiter arm, till the whole scene was involved in
almost total darkness, without her having fixed upon any plan that
was likely to lead to security.</p>

<p>The chill winds of the east now blew cold from the mountains, and
scattered the few remaining leaves from the half-desolated branches,
whilst scarcely sensible of existence, she continued to muse upon
what she had heard with undescribable anguish, till a deep and hollow
knell, proceeding from a conventual church at an inconsiderable
distance from the castle, at length recalled her to consciousness.
She started--it was the bell of death; and seemed, to her weakened
and almost deranged faculties, to foretell her own immediate
dissolution. Pale and breathless as a statue, she clasped her hands
eagerly together, and uttering a deep convulsive sigh, proceeded from
the place.</p>

<p>Voices were now heard approaching towards the tree she had
quitted, and a pale uncertain light was dimly seen through a grove of
dark firs which led nearly to the spot. In the next moment she
perceived two men, apparently in pursuit of her, bearing torches,
whom she soon discovered to be Paoli and Ambrose. She was not long
unobserved; and the former accosting her in a rough voice, demanded
whither she had been, and what had induced her to ramble so far at
that late and perilous hour? Being in capable of framing a reply, he
seized her by the arm with the fury of a barbarian, and finding from
the livid paleness of her countenance that she was near fainting,
commanded Ambrose to assist in supporting her. In this manner she was
conveyed to the castle, more dead than alive, and soon afterwards
into a kind of garret, never before occupied by any of the family,
and far removed from her former apartment. To this place she was
carried by Paoli, who, having seated her upon an ancient leather
settee, which was placed at the extremity of the room, left her a
lamp, and retired, not forgetting the precaution of fastening the
door, lest his dark designs should be frustrated.</p>

<p>No doubt now remained in the bosom of Laurette but that the
desolate apartment to which she was conveyed by her inexorable enemy,
was to witness the perpetration of his bloody designs; and that the
wretch who was hired to commit the execrable deed, was to take the
advantage of night and of silence, the hour when all but herself were
resigned to the influence of repose. Her meek, her inoffensive life,
was given into the hands of an inhuman monster, a wretch incapable of
pity, dead to every principle of benevolence and virtue. He had
appointed the morrow for the execution of his villainy, in a dreary
and unfrequented forest; but as she was unable to learn the result of
the conversation, from not having heard the whole of it, he seemed to
have yielded to the request of the Marchese, and meant to execute his
purpose instantaneously.</p>

<p>Though Laurette's apprehensions of death were too terrible to be
sustained with uniform fortitude, the sufferings of Enrico when he
should be informed of her destiny, was a reflection more difficult to
be endured; and this, aided by the probability of the persecutions of
the Marchese being extended to him, should one victim be insufficient
for the gratification of his resentment, completed the number of
melancholy sensations that pained and corroded her heart.</p>

<p>The more she endeavoured to unravel the mystery that had involved
her in such a series of calamities, the more inexplicable it
appeared; and being incapable of investigating the subject with the
minute attention it required, it seemed, from a cursory survey, to be
the effect of some deep-laid scheme, formed by the malicious
disposition of Paoli, for the accomplishment of her destruction,
rather than the result of a combination of casual occurrences, as she
had formerly imagined; since something had been evidently laid to her
charge which no part of her conduct could justify.</p>

<p>A thousand times she blamed the weakness, the cowardice which
prevented her from availing herself of the many opportunities that
had offered themselves of obtaining another interview with the Monk.
But this was beyond recall, and she was soon going to expiate this
error, the only one she ever remembered to have committed, with her
blood.</p>

<p>It was now past midnight, and though she was at too great a
distance from the inhabited part of the castle to hear what was
passing below, she had reason to believe that all were retired to
their beds.</p>

<p>A deep and mournful stillness seemed to reign throughout the
mansion, and being in hourly expectation of her murderer, she betook
herself to prayer, that she might prepare her mind, as much as
possible, for the awful change that awaited her, by soliciting the
protection of Heaven in the moments of dissolution, which she was
well assured could bestow comfort even in the agonies of death, and
teach her to sustain them with dignity.</p>

<p>As soon as her plaintive orisons were concluded, she took the
volume of poems from her pocket which she had found in the pavilion,
and connecting with it the idea of Enrico, bathed it with tears newly
come to her relief, and then opening it, accidentally met with one of
the beautiful sonnets of Petrarch, composed after the death of Laura.
Not daring to trust herself with the perusal of a poem whose subject
was so destructive to fortitude, she instantly closed it, and taking
the fatal picture from her bosom, whose saint-like countenance so
finely imaged her own, she pressed it to her lips, and breathing an
eternal adieu, replaced it in her bosom; and then throwing herself
upon the bed, endeavoured to await, with something like resignation,
the doom which she considered as inevitable.</p>

<p>As the morning advanced, her fears gradually subsided. If that
desolate apartment was intended for her death-room, the bloody deed,
she believed, would have been executed in the silence of the night;
and with no small degree of consolation she beheld the first dawn of
early day peep through the high lattices of her prison.</p>

<p>Somewhat re-assured by this unexpected clemency, and nearly
exhausted with fatigue, she yielded for a short time to the sweet
influence of sleep; but her slumbers were broken and disturbed, and
dreadful foreboding visions terrified her fancy.</p>

<p>She thought she saw Enrico with a wild unsettled look, haggard
countenance, and every symptom of suffering, dart into a forest,
whither she was conveyed for the purpose of being massacred, who,
after many ineffectual efforts to accomplish her release, was obliged
to resign her to her murderer. She was then conducted through
unfrequented woods, followed by Enrico, till they had reached a place
still more dreary than the last, when the assassin drawing a stiletto
from beneath his cloak, which he had previously concealed, gave her
the mortal stab; then, as if not sufficiently glutted with the sight
before him, he drew the instrument from her bosom, yet reeking with
her blood, and plunged it into the heart of Enrico.</p>

<p>This horrible dream, occasioned by the excessive agitation of her
spirits, had such an effect upon her mind, that, uttering a faint
scream, she started wildly from the bed, and saw, by the dusky light
which the narrow casement admitted, a tall figure, whose stature her
imagination heightened to a being of gigantic size, standing by her
side, apparently watching her as she slept. Not having courage to
cast her eyes again towards that part of the chamber where they had
met the object of her terror, to be convinced that it was not an
illusion, she uttered a deep and dreadful scream, and again fell
senseless on the bed.</p>

<p>No means being employed to recall her to life, she remained in
this state of insensibility till she found herself in the arms of the
steward, who had already conveyed her, assisted by Ambrose, beyond
the walls of the castle.</p>

<p>Paoli having mounted a mule that was in readiness at the outer
gate, commanded Laurette to be placed behind him, and ordering her to
be tied to the animal, to prevent her from effecting an escape,
hurried from the place; when he had somewhat relaxed from the pace
with which he had set out, she made a gentle, but hopeless, attempt
to interest his compassion.</p>

<p>'Oh save me! save me!' cried she, weeping, 'if ever you have known
what it is to suffer, or have felt the soft touches of sympathy; if
ever you have considered the value of existence, or have trembled at
the thoughts of losing it.'</p>

<p>'To what do you allude?' replied Paoli, sternly; 'what reason have
you to indulge yourself in fanciful conjectures, and what is it that
you fear?'</p>

<p>'Alas! I fear every thing,' returned Laurette, mournfully; 'and it
is you only that can save me.'</p>

<p>'Is there any thing so very terrible in a removal from the
castle,' replied Paoli, angrily--'a place that you entered so
reluctantly; are you never to be pleased?'</p>

<p>'Ah! but I know--' cried the fair sufferer, weeping.</p>

<p>'What do you know?' interrupted the steward, turning round
fiercely upon his saddle; 'and what is it that you apprehend since
you know it to be the will of the Marchese?'</p>

<p>'Ah! but to be conveyed, I know not whither; to be carried into a
dreary wood, and to die; to have the rights of burial denied me, and
to be left a prey to the wolves of the desert--have I deserved all
this? and can I reflect upon it without fear?'</p>

<p>'Banish these ridiculous suspicions,' returned Paoli, with
surprise, 'who has told you all this? who has imagined it for you? or
what cause have you to indulge in these improbable surmises?'</p>

<p>'No one has informed me of my danger,' replied Laurette,
tremulously; 'Alas! I had no friend left in the castle to inform me
of it. It was myself only that heard it in the pavilion, when you was
in conversation with the Marchese.'</p>

<p>'And what demon,' interrupted the steward, 'has instructed you in
the art of overhearing secret conferences? what did you hear? tell me
instantly, as you value your safety.'</p>

<p>In hopes of being able to excite his compassion, Laurette
acquainted him with the circumstance of her having been in the
pavilion previous to their arrival, and of the fruitless attempts she
had made to leave it, that she might not be obliged to overhear
conversation intended to be secret. Then disguising some part of the
discourse, lest it should irritate him the more, she related what she
had heard.</p>

<p>Some symptoms of confusion appeared in Paoli's countenance at the
recital, though he positively denied that it had any reference to
herself; and after endeavouring to convince her that no harm would
befall her, he sunk again into his accustomed reserve; whilst
Laurette, with a heart palpitating with terror, was compelled to
proceed on her journey.</p>

How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds
Make deeds ill done! Hadst not thou been by--
A fellow, by the hand of Nature mark'd.
Louted, and sign'd to do a deed of shame.
This murder had not come into my mind:
Hadst thou but shook thy head, or made a pause.
When I spake darkly what I purposed.
Or turned an eye of doubt upon my face.
Or bade me tell my tale in express words.
Deep shame had struck me dumb, made me break off;
And these, thy fears, would have wrought fears in me.

<p>The lovely orphan was no sooner conveyed from the castle, than the
Marchese appeared to labour under such an oppression of spirits, as
no change of circumstance, or of place, promised to remove.</p>

<p>Though he would willingly have spared himself this new cause of
remorse, by confining Laurette in a convent at the instigation of the
inhuman steward, he had at last determined upon her death. Offended
pride and disappointed hopes taught him at first to reflect upon it
with indifference, whilst the apparent necessity of committing this
horrid deed, to conceal the perpetration of another not less
criminal, actuated him still more powerfully; yet, probably, even
these arguments would not have possessed a sufficient portion of
energy and persuasion to have effected so sudden a resolution, had he
not beheld in the person of Paoli a wretch, whose mind, as well as
aspect, indicated him a villain, marked and selected by Nature for
the accomplishment of the most daring and bloody purposes; who being
entirely unrestrained by conscience, was ever ready to espouse the
cause of iniquity, for the sake of temporary advantage; and from a
long acquaintance with all the arts of intrigue, was enabled to
direct the weaknesses and vices of others to his immediate
interests.</p>

<p>Three days had passed since Laurette's departure from the castle,
during which period a thousand internal conflicts destroyed the
repose of the Marchese, and lacerated his guilty bosom. He awaited
with a dreadful kind of impatience the return of Paoli. The sun of
the morning arose to him without exciting one sweet or pleasurable
emotion; and, as if anxious to escape from his penetrating and
reproachful beams, he frequently retired into the deep clefts of the
rocks, or the rude narrow glens of the mountains, as if alarmed lest
his very thoughts should have witnesses; but, though he dared not
trust himself to visit those scenes which were once rendered
interesting by the soft form of her, who was now the patient victim
of his cruelty, her beautiful image, adorned with all its innocent
and unassuming graces, was continually presented to him, even in the
wild and lonely recesses he had chosen. Since she had now paid so
dear for her offence, remorse and tenderness rapidly succeeded each
other; and sensations, as new as they were agonizing, were excited in
his breast. Conscious that to the mind diseased, no state is so
insupportable as that of suspense, he became still more impatient for
the return of his steward, though it was impossible he could
communicate any intelligence of a cordial nature, since he equally
dreaded to hear that Laurette was assassinated, or had effected an
escape, as such an event could not take place without the
interference of another, which must inevitably lead to a discovery
productive of the most alarming consequences.</p>

<p>Four days had now elapsed, and still he did not return; something
the Marchese imagined must have happened to occasion this delay, and
sensations still more afflictive and terrible passed through his
disordered mind. Unable any longer to endure the pressure of his
uneasiness, which was now rendered still more acute by a thousand
memorials of her whom he had thus sacrificed to ambition and unjust
resentment, he adopted the resolution of repairing to the castle of
Elfinbach, in hopes that a new succession of objects might effect a
change of idea. This plan, as soon as formed, was communicated to
Ambrose, who was commanded to attend him thither and leaving orders
for Paoli to follow him immediately on his return, the Marchese
proceeded on his journey.</p>

<p>After a dreary and melancholy ride over barren heaths and rugged
precipices, the travellers arrived at this desolated castle, which,
from the heavy rains that had recently fallen, and the high winds
which had blown down the rampart-wall, and shattered the easements,
appeared more than usually gloomy. The Marchese surveyed it for a
moment in silence, and then alighting from his horse, asked eagerly
for the Signora, and was directed into one of the saloons.</p>

<p>He found her alone, engaged in some household employment; and
being surprised at his sudden return to a place not at present
rendered fit for his reception, she looked chagrined and embarrassed.
The restless agitation of mind that was so strongly delineated on the
features and manners of the Marchese, did not elude the observation
of the Signora, though the cause was inexplicable. She would have
demanded the reason of this conduct, but the reserve, with which he
repressed every inquiry she ventured to make that could lead to the
subject, occasioned her to desist.</p>

<p>She did not mention Laurette till the following day, fearing lest
this mysterious sadness was the effect of her coldness, and might be
increased by reverting to the cause; but anxiety to gain some
information respecting her lovely young friend overpowering every
other consideration, directed her simply to interrogate him
concerning her health. The name of Laurette, uttered by the Signora,
roused him from that state of stupor into which he had fallen. He
started, and confusion for the moment prevented him from framing a
reply, till at length recalling some portion of that studied
composure, that masterly command of feature, for which he was once so
deservedly eminent, he informed her, without recollecting that he had
not answered her first question, that Laurette had proved herself
unworthy of his future protection, by having escaped secretly from
the castle, unknown to and unobserved by any one.</p>

<p>The Signora now imagined that she was acquainted with the whole:
every thing that the Marchese had uttered relative to her escape,
appeared probable, when she recollected the boldness, and even
aversion, with which she had uniformly repressed the ardour of his
passion. But in what part of the province could she find an asylum
that would defend her from the power of her lover, or elude the
vigilance of his researches, should he be disposed to continue his
persecutions, was unanswerable. Her unprotected situation filled the
mind of the Signora, as she reflected upon it, with new terror; but
afraid of betraying too much emotion in the presence of her Lord, she
abruptly quitted the apartment, that she might consider it more
deeply in secret.</p>

<p>The Marchese now believing that he had convinced his Casiera that
Laurette had deservedly forfeited all claim to his protection from
having voluntarily quitted the castle, less frequently came into her
presence than before, still endeavouring to find that repose he had
lost amid the wildest scenes of Nature, which his dark discoloured
imagination rendered still more dreary.</p>

<p>Day after day passed in a state of mournful solicitude, yet Paoli
was not announced; 'the attempt, and not the deed', was dreadful! If
the bloody business was transacted, what could have detained him? A
thousand terrible surmises now agitated his breast; his nights
continued to be sleepless, and, before he had been a week resident at
the castle, his pallid countenance, and his emaciated limbs, foretold
alarming consequences!</p>

<p>A strange account of noises heard in different parts of the
mansion, and of spectres being seen gliding through the galleries at
the dead hour of the night, was now circulated among the domestics!
The Signora was informed of it, and, willing to remove what she
termed causeless superstition, endeavoured to convince them of the
absurdity of allowing themselves to be deluded by imaginary terrors;
but the arguments she made use of to quiet their apprehensions were
ineffectual. Ambrose averred, that he had met a figure clothed in
white, gliding through the corridor, who, without accosting him,
vanished apparently into one of the deserted apartments! The female
servants, who were procured by the Signora from the nearest village,
to assist in cleaning the castle, each declared they had seen the
same spectre, exactly answering to his description, in different
situations, and had all formed the resolution not to stir alone in
the night, nor even in the dusk, each declaring that she had rather
meet a wild beast than a spirit!</p>

<p>The Signora's woman, being the only one among them who had not
caught the contagion, proposed, if any one would accompany her, to
explore every room in the castle; but no individual in the family
being courageous enough to assist her in her researches, she was
compelled to abandon the design, though not without branding all,
particularly Ambrose, with the imputation of cowardice.</p>

<p>The Marchese in the meantime, though kept in total ignorance of
the affair, through the express orders of the Casiera, appeared to
suffer more internal horror than any of the servants. His meals were
short, and his answers, when any one addressed him, were far from the
purpose, and usually uttered with an aspect of displeasure. At some
times he seemed lost in the gloom of silent thoughtfulness, whilst at
others his strong expressive features were distorted by emotions; and
with his arms folded upon his breast, and his eyes fixed with a
vacant stare upon some object he was unconscious of beholding, his
whole frame appeared to suffer some dreadful convulsion. He usually
retired early to his room, but seldom to his bed: he never courted
the sweet influence of sleep, for he knew that it shunned the
blood-stained couch of the murderer, and descended only on the lid of
unoffending innocence.</p>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>

<p>The room, which was selected by ambrose for his Lord immediately
on his arrival, was on the northern side of the edifice, and from its
remote situation, as well as from the circumstance of that range of
apartments having always remained locked during Madame Chamont's
residence in the mansion, had long fallen into disuse. It was a large
dreary looking chamber, partially hung with tapestry of no common
workmanship, representing a group of grim and ghastly figures habited
as knights, with their spears, bucklers, and other implements of war.
The bed, which was composed of crimson damask, was so much faded and
discoloured with age, and the curtains that hung loosely from the
high canopied tester, had been so long a prey to the moths and the
night-flies, that the windows were no sooner opened, after having
been closed for near twenty years, than they fell into fragments. A
few faded portraits, in the costume of the thirteenth century, and
large old-fashioned mirror, whose massy gilt frame appeared to have
withstood the assaults of ages, were the only ornaments this
apartment contained, if those could be called ornaments, which,
instead of relieving the eye, tended to make the correspondent gloom
of the whole more dreadfully impressive.</p>

<p>This room Ambrose endeavoured to convince the Signora was less
exposed than any other to the fury of the winds, and upon the whole a
more comfortable asylum than any other which the castle
contained.</p>

<p>The Marchese, in any other frame of spirits, would have been
shocked at its desolate appearance; but horrors were now become
familiar to him, and taking a lamp and book, he usually retired to it
early; and if he ever closed his eyes, this transient respose was
obtained in a large antique chair, covered with green damask, that
was placed by the side of the fire.</p>

<p>The Signora, believing that this increasing malady was chiefly the
effect of sleepless anxiety, ventured one night, unknown to him, to
put something in his wine of a soporific nature, whose effect being
almost instantaneous, occasioned him to retire to his chamber still
earlier than before.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he entered the room before he perceived a soft
composure stealing upon his spirits, and contrary to his late custom,
threw himself upon the bed, and yielded to a transient slumber. But
the comfort of serene sleep was denied him; for his guilty soul
conjured up strange and dreadful images, not less appalling than his
waking terrors. He imagined that, for some crime committed against
the ecclesiastical powers, he was consigned to the dungeons of the
inquisition within the authority of Rome, where he remained in hourly
expectation of being summoned to the secret tribunal--a tribunal
where mercy, and even justice, are for ever excluded, to confess what
must doom him to immediate death, or have that confession extorted
from him, by means more dreadful than the human mind could conceive,
by inflictions more excruciating than the annihilation of existence.
He awaked; it was but a dream, and sleep still overpowering him, he
closed his eyes, and again yielded to its influence. The dreadful
vision still continued; he was now conducted by two of the officers
belonging to this hopeless prison, through dark subterranean
passages, to the secret tribunal. The grand inquisitor, with the
three persons that formed the tribunal, were seated on a lofty
elevation. He arose when he entered, and eyeing him with a dreadful
kind of minuteness, proceeded to judgment. The charge against him was
read; it spoke of murder and sacrilege. His accuser was called; it
was a Monk, of a meek and saint-like appearance, clad in the holy
vestments of his order. He came forwards; the trial proceeded; the
facts alledged against him were incontrovertible, and the tribunal,
in a loud voice, demanded his confession. The excessive agitation of
his mind now released him from the fetters of sleep, and starting
from the couch, in an agony not to be described, he pronounced the
word 'Confess.' 'Confess,' repeated a voice apparently proceeding
from a distant part of the room, in a tone at once deep and
impressive. The Marchese's alarm increased; a sound was certainly
heard that echoed his words, and surprise and terror for the moment
deprived him of utterance. But a desperate kind of courage was at
length communicated to his mind, and in an accent not less firm,
though more furious, he retorted, 'Confess what?' 'Confess what?'
returned the same voice, delivering the last word in a tone of deeper
emphasis--'Dost thou ask what?' The sensation which the Marchese now
experienced, was little short of distraction; it could not be an
illusion, and he would have sprang from his couch to have
investigated this mysterious affair, and to have discovered, if
possible, from whence the tones proceeded; but throwing his eyes
wildly around, he perceived a tall, dreadful-looking figure moving
slowly from one of the angles into a remote part of the chamber. The
lamp was extinguished, and the dying embers refused to administer the
smallest portion of light; but the moon-beams that penetrated through
the half-decayed curtains, dimly discovered the figure.</p>

<p>With a countenance, on which extreme agony of soul was faithfully
delineated, the eyes of the Marchese continued to follow the
terrifying phantom, who, without appearing to observe him, moved
pensively along beneath the dim Gothic arch of the casement, in a
kind of white robe or cassock, which descending beneath the feet,
swept mournfully along the ground. A hood of the same colour covered
its face, and shaded the ghastliness of its features. The castle bell
now tolled one; the spectre stopped, turned, and in a few moments
advanced with a quickened movement towards the bed. The desperate
courage which the Marchese had assumed, now vanished; he threw
himself back upon the pillow, his breath shortened, the cold dews
paced each other down his forehead, he veiled his face, which
exhibited a cadaverous paleness, with the coverture; and stifled
groans, and irregular respiration, were all the symptoms of remaining
existence!</p>

<p>In a few minutes he heard a rustling kind of noise towards the
feet of the bed; the curtains were soon afterwards undrawn, and had
not the alarm attendant on conscious guilt, wrapped him in obscurity,
he might have seen distinctly the form of the spectre bending
silently over his couch.</p>

<p>In this situation he remained till the light of the morning
dissipated the gloom that had veiled his dreary apartment; when
venturing to divest himself of his temporary covering, he perceived
that the phantom, which had excited such alarm, was vanished, though
the door of the chamber was still fastened.</p>

<p>This remarkable incident now completely engaged his attention; and
having communicated the affair to Ambrose, who was become a kind of
confident since the departure of Paoli, he contrived, with his
assistance, to remove the tapestry with which the apartment was hung,
that by these means they might be enabled to explore every part of
the wainscot, and to discover if any secret entrance was concealed
behind this grotesque covering; but no door, or any other possible
method of gaining admission, appeared, or any thing that could act as
a clue to conjecture. Still more perplexed and agonized, the mind of
the Marchese became a prey to superstitious terror. Afraid of being
alone, yet ashamed of acknowledging his weakness, he suffered a
tumult of distracting apprehension, which no effort of fortitude
could subdue.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

Ah me! for aught that ever I could read.
Could ever hear by tale or history.
The course of true love never did run smooth;
But either it was different in blood.

Or if there were a sympathy in choice.
War, death, or sickness, did lay siege to it.

</pre>

<p>Enrico had been prevented from visiting Laurette to his promise by
a second letter from Italy, which acquainted him with the increasing
indisposition of his Colonel, and convinced him of the necessity of
his quitting Germany immediately, if he was desirous of preventing
the danger of seeing him no more. The grateful heart of the young
Chevalier felt a severe pang of self-reproach when he perused this
epistle, and willing to repair this fault of omission with all
imaginable speed, he wrote to inform Laurette of the occasion of his
absence, and commenced his journey. As the Signora was removed from
the castle at the time this letter arrived, it unfortunately fell
into the hands of the steward, who, after intercepting and reading it
himself, discovered the contents to his Lord. Thus the two lovers
mutually upbraided each other without any actual cause, and felt,
through the meanness and vices of others, the most poignant regret
and solicitude.</p>

<p>As soon as Enrico had reached the borders of Italy, he made the
best of his way to Pietola, the customary residence of the Marchese
de Martilina when disengaged from the duties of his station.</p>

<p>Here he arrived but just in time to receive the last sigh of his
revered patron, and to bathe the almost lifeless hand that was
extended to welcome him with his tears! Perfectly sensible, though
unable to give his thoughts utterance, the Marchese gazed with silent
tenderness upon his young favourite, till the vital spark, which had
been long expiring, was extinguished, and he fell into the arms of
death as into a quiet slumber. The serenity displayed by this great
and good man at the hour of death, sufficiently evinced that his life
had been blameless: it was the cloudless evening of a tranquil day;
no ruffling gales disturbed the calm of his soul; all was comfort and
repose.</p>

<p>The affectionate Enrico felt as if he had lost not only a friend,
but a parent; and when he followed the adviser and protector of his
youth to his last mournful receptacle, he suffered an agony of
distress, which required a more than ordinary effort of fortitude to
subdue. Endowed with that exquisite perception of pain, or pleasure,
which is annexed to extreme sensibility, he found it difficult to
tear himself from the place which contained the sacred remains of his
friend; till anxiety to gain some intelligence relative to Laurette's
silence, which was as mysterious as alarming, determined him to
remove from Pietola without further delay, and to set forwards for
the castle of Lunenburg.</p>

<p>Having given orders to Anselmo for the horses to be prepared,
which were to convey them into Germany, he visited, for the last
time, the grave of his much-revered Colonel; and after having
indulged the sacredness of his sorrow in secret, was walking silently
from the spot, when he was accosted by the nearest relative of his
deceased friend, who, with much courtesy of address, requested an
audience.</p>

<p>Enrico bowed assent, and following his conductor to a place
appointed for the purpose, was informed that the Marchese di
Martilina had bequeathed to him a thousand Louis-d'ors per annum, as
a pledge of his friendship and esteem. The heart of the noble
Chevalier overflowed with effusions of gratitude, which no eloquence
of language can express, as this event was recited; tears of
tenderness and regret rushed into his eyes, and having thanked the
Signor for his information, with a gracefulness of expression
peculiar to himself, he retired to indulge the luxury of his feelings
in secret. Enrico had accidentally heard that his much-lamented
Colonel had accumulated a considerable share of personal property,
besides those ample estates he possessed in many parts of the
Continent, which devolved to the male heir; but he never flattered
himself into the supposition that he should be remembered in his
will, though on former occasions he had experienced many proofs of
his benevolence. A mind more sanguine and disinterested than his own
might, indeed, have collected some circumstances to favour such an
opinion; as the Marchese had no near relation living, and
consequently his immense possessions descended to a distant branch of
the family, to whom he was not much attached, whilst the
ever-increasing partiality he had discovered for the amiable
Chevalier wore the most promising aspect in his favour.</p>

<p>This worthy Nobleman had never formed a matrimonial connexion,
owing to his having experienced a severe disappointment in the early
part of his life, which directed him, as the most effectual way of
subduing it, into the service of his country.</p>

<p>New avocations now retarded the journey of Enrico for a few days;
but more than ever anxious to behold the charming object of his
affections, whose fair form too frequently obtruded itself into his
thoughts, as well as to learn the cause of her silence, as soon as
suitable arrangements were made respecting pecuniary affairs, he
proceeded on his journey.</p>

<p>The tender melancholy which pervaded the heart of our hero, was
not unmixed with pleasing sensations, when he considered himself as
advancing towards that mansion, which he had reason to imagine was
inhabited by her, whose presence was sufficient to compensate for the
loss of every other valuable connexion, and who, he flattered
himself, would mingle the breathings of affection with the blushes of
retiring diffidence.</p>

<p>He recollected that he now possessed a competency adequate to all
the comforts, if not the luxuries, of life, which, though by no means
equal to the merit of the person beloved, was yet, he was convinced,
far beyond her desires, as it would, at least, place them, would she
deign to listen to his proposals, above mediocrity; but when his mind
reverted with painful concern to his lost parent, whose destiny was
yet veiled in obscurity, a cloud of premature sadness overshadowed
his future prospects. Was she present to congratulate him on his new
accessions, and at the same time to confer upon him her orphan
charge, how pure, how unmixed, would have been his felicity; and how
exquisite would have been her sensations when empowered to bestow
such happiness!</p>

<p>Lost in these reflections, Enrico proceeded silently along; nor
could the loquacity of Anselmo, who endeavoured to direct his
attention towards those 'cloud-capped' temples, decayed edifices, and
lofty columns, which on every side decorate the Italian landscape,
giving sublimity to beauty, withdraw him from thoughtfulness.</p>

<p>Having proceeded for many leagues along the winding borders of the
Po, by means of a gondola they crossed the Adda that communicates
with the Lago di Como, celebrated by Virgil under the name of Lake
Larius, which issuing out at the extremity, loses itself in that
river, the grand receptacle of all others, except the Adige, that
washes the vernal and fruitful soil of this romantic country. Had
Enrico's mind been entirely disengaged from nearer interests, with
what solemn emotions of awe and admiration would he have contemplated
the scene before him? The vast range of Alps, which serve as a
barrier to divide France and Germany from the Italian states, rose in
irregular and misshapen forms, some towering till their summits were
lost in perpetual obscurity, whilst others were broken into so many
steeps and inaccessible precipices, that the traveller, surveying
them with that kind of enthusiasm which is peculiar to the admirers
of stupendous imagery, feels an affecting kind of horror stealing
irresistibly to his heart.</p>

<p>After passing with much difficulty these dangerous acclivities,
the soul of Enrico became more animated. Every step he conceived
brought him nearer to Laurette; and though still far distant, he
imagined the wintry landscape, as he passed the boundaries of
Germany, exhibited a less saddened appearance. Hope again brightened
his prospects, and scarcely submitting to the delay of stopping for
necessary food, he redoubled his speed. A few days brought them
within three leagues of the castle, and having proceeded thus far,
the travellers were compelled, from the darkness of the night, to put
up at a small cottage on the road, meaning to prosecute the remaining
part of their journey on the ensuing mornmg; but Enrico had of late
suffered so much mental, as well as bodily fatigue, that he was
obliged to remain at the cottage some hours longer than was his
intention, and also to take something of a medicinal nature before he
was enabled to proceed; though his impatience arose almost to agony
when he recollected how inconsiderable was the distance which
separated him from Laurette, and yet that he was prevented from being
with her, without having even obtained an assurance that she was
still in safety. Towards evening, however, the symptoms, which had
threatened him with severe indisposition, abated, and, unable to
endure the idea of procrastinated happiness when his lovely
enchantress was so near, he determined to proceed; and, after
bestowing upon the owners of this little asylum many testimonies of
gratitude, they continued their journey.</p>

<p>It was night when the travellers arrived within sight of the
mansion, and new sensations assailed the mind of Enrico as he
surveyed it. From what had passed, he had every reason to believe
that he must encounter the displeasure of its possessor by venturing
into his presence without a previous invitation, who had never once
hinted a desire of being known to him on any former occasion; but the
force of his attachment soon weakened these unpleasant surmises, and
as nearer interests succeeded in his thoughts, he wondered how they
had ever troubled him. When Enrico had reached the high wall which
encompassed the castle, his heart beat high with expectation. He
attempted to open the arched door which had before given him
admission; it gave way to his touch; and desiring Anselmo to attend
to the horses till he received orders to the contrary, he advanced
rapidly through the grounds. The moon, which before gave only a pale
and uncertain light, now shrunk beneath a cloud, and it was with much
difficulty that he was enabled to proceed through the numerous
shrubberies and low coppices, which were every where scattered
around. The path he had chosen, though the most direct one leading to
the portico, was winding and irregular, frequently intercepted with
small clumps of juniper, almond, and pomgranate, or with knots of
variegated evergreens, which, in a more favourable season, perfumed
the air with their fragrance. When arrived at the principal entrance,
he knocked, but the summons was unanswered; he listened, but no step
was to be heard; fear and mistrust, with a thousand melancholy
accompaniments, were now communicated to his mind. He surveyed the
front of the edifice; no lights appeared at the windows. He ascended
the solarium, and looked through the glass door that opened into the
terrace-parlour, which the Signora d'Orfo and her fair friend
formerly occupied when alone; but it was deserted, and even the
lamps, which used to be hung in the balconies, were removed.
Impatience now arose to the most painful solicitude; he knocked again
and again, but without better success, and at length becoming
desperate by this cruel disappointment, endeavoured to scale the wall
inclosing the court which led to the portal. After many ineffectual
attempts, he succeeded in his desires; but the enterprise was a
dangerous one, and as he alighted on the other side, something placed
there for the purpose lacerated his leg. The pain, though acute, was
disregarded; but the blood, which flowed fast from the wound, obliged
him to apply his handkerchief as a bandage to the part till
assistance could be procured. This accident, though it retarded the
execution, tended not to subdue the energy of his resolves. He
bounded instantly towards the door, and knowing that a bell,
resounding through one whole wing of the building, was here the
signal of approach, he repeated the alarm, and in a few minutes had
the consolation of hearing footsteps approaching slowly along the
hall. The door was now opened by a male servant, whom Enrico never
remembered to have seen during his former residence in the castle,
who, after surveying him with surprise, demanded his business. In a
voice rendered tremulous by emotion, he inquired for Laurette, and
was informed that she had eloped from the mansion without the
knowledge of the family, and was gone no one could tell whither.</p>

<p>To describe the sensations of the unfortunate Chevalier at this
moment, would demand powers of expression beyond the utmost eloquence
of language. He rushed into the castle in spite of the efforts of the
domestic, who endeavoured to prevent his design, and hastening along
the hall, stopped at the door of the saloon. He attempted to open it,
but it was locked. The Marchese and the Signora were then assuredly
removed, and whither must he go for information. The servant, by whom
he was admitted, having never seen him before, being entirely
ignorant of his intentions from the circumstance of his scaling the
wall, as well as the wildness of his looks, took him for a maniac,
and had left him to pursue his own inclinations only whilst he
acquainted his fellows with the adventure.</p>

<p>Lost in bewildering conjecture, Enrico stood with his eyes
unconsciously fixed upon the deserted apartments in a state of total
inaction; for surprise had deprived him of the power of exertion, and
made him sensible only of his own misfortunes and disappointment. One
solitary lamp, suspended from the ceiling in a central situation,
which cast a dim and partial light, scarcely dissipated the gloom
that was every where visible; but his mind was too much wounded to
feel the effect of accidental events, though all around appeared
melancholy, hopeless, and blank as his destiny.</p>

<p>The few remaining domestics now crowded about the forlorn
traveller, some to demand his business at that lone and silent hour,
and others to prove the truth of the assertion, by discovering
whether he was really touched with insanity. Extreme agony of mind
prevented Enrico from immediately undeceiving them; but recollecting
the necessity of recalling some portion of that resisting fortitude,
which love only could have weakened, he repeated his inquiries with
all the calmness he could command, and finally, by declaring his
name, endeavoured to make himself known. This avowal roused one of
the women that followed in the rear, who elevating her lamp as she
advanced nearer, for the purpose of examining his countenance, let it
fall suddenly from her hand, exclaiming, in evident astonishment,
that it was indeed the Chevalier Chamont. Somewhat animated by the
certainty that he was remembered, at least, by one of the domestics,
Enrico made a second attempt at recomposing his spirits; and having
requested that she would indulge him with a few moments' conversation
alone, she opened the door of the terrace-parlour to give him
admittance, whilst the rest stole silently away.</p>

<p>Fanchette, which was the name of the servant, possessing much
natural kindness, was easily prevailed upon to give him an audience;
and when she beheld his wild, unsettled appearance, and the many
symptoms of distress which marked his dejected features, compassion
was so warmly excited in her bosom, that, had it been in her power to
have offered him consolation, she would have bestowed it with
pleasure.</p>

<p>The Marchese, as well as Ambrose, had confidently affirmed that
Laurette had voluntarily escaped from the castle ever since her
departure, and had taken much pains to circulate this report among
the servants; and as she had not been seen by any one but Paoli and
Ambrose after having left the pavilion, the probability of the
assertion was apparently justified; though Fanchette observed, that
the steward's quitting the castle at so early an hour in the morning,
without giving some previous intimation of his intentions, appeared
somewhat mysterious. The sudden removal of the fair orphan, in whose
fate all were interested, had been a subject of surprise and
conjecture in those apartments appropriated to the use of the
servants ever since the event had taken place. Various opinions were
received and propagated, which were faithfully recited by Fanchette;
but from these nothing was to be gathered that might lead to a future
discovery. Plunged still deeper in despair, the disconsolate Enrico
could scarcely be prevailed upon to continue in the castle during the
night, so anxious was he to commence his pursuit of Laurette, however
hopeless the attempt.</p>

<p>Having at length reluctantly assented to Fancliette's wishes, who
kindly applied something of an healing quality to his leg, which was
found upon examination to be very slightly injured, Anselmo's horses
were ordered into the stable, and he into the kitchen, to partake of
a comfortable repast, and the warmth of a blazing fire. Enrico's mind
was too much disturbed with internal conflicts to attend to the wants
of Nature, and throwing himself upon one of those sofas, on which in
happier times he had often sat with Laurette, he yielded to all the
melancholy forebodings of his agitated breast.</p>

<h3>Chapter 4</h3>

<pre>
Oh thievish night!
Why shouldst thou, but for some felonious ends.
In thy dark lantern thus close up the stars
That Nature hung in Heaven, and fill'd their lamps
With everlasting oil, to give due light
To the misled and lonely traveller?
For their way
Lies through the perplex'd path of this drear wood;
The nodding horror of whose shady brow
Threats the forlorn and wand'ring passenger.
--MILTON
</pre>

<p>Unable to obtain even a moment's repose, Enrico arose with the
dawn of early day, and being determined to go instantly in search of
Laurette, roused his servant from a comfortable sleep into which he
had recently fallen, with orders for him to prepare to accompany him
on his new expedition. Anselmo hastily obeyed the summons, and the
unfortunate travellers, being again mounted, commenced their hopeless
journey.</p>

<p>It was a dreary December morning, and the grey heavy mists that
loaded the atmosphere brought on a cold and drizly rain. The woods
were now disrobed of their honours; no choral harmony resounded
through the desolated branches; all was melancholy, repose, and
silence! With no guide but chance, and without having obtained any
intelligence that could serve as a clue to discovery, the wretched
Enrico traversed the barren hills and humid values, in a state of
mind that partook of agony. A thousand vague conjectures passed
across his mind as he continued to ruminate upon the subject.
Sometimes he imagined that the Marchese had conceived a passion for
Laurette, and had adopted this plan at once to separate her from the
Signora, and to deceive the domestics; at others, he conceived it
probable that she had made a voluntary escape to avoid falling a
victim to his artifice, which, he naturally believed, had been
already exerted for the accomplishment of her destruction. But why
was the promise she made to him on parting disregarded? Why did she
not inform him of her danger, and accept of his protection? A slight
emotion of indignation accompanied this reflection; she might be
false, her affections might be another's, or, what was still more
probable, they might never have been his.</p>

<p>This apprehension brought with it a pang more acute, but it was
only momentary. He recollected the touching expression of her
countenance when he tore himself from the castle, the sweet
languishment of her charming eyes as they followed him towards the
portico, and the tears and speaking blushes that graced her last
innocent farewels. These had been indelibly impressed upon his memory
ever since he had parted from her in every distressing emergency; and
amidst all the cross accidents and unexpected calamities which he
experienced, these sweet remembrances conveyed a cordial to his
wounded spirits.</p>

<p>Thinking that some information might possibly be obtained from the
peasantry, should they have providentially taken the same road as the
lovely young fugitive, they did not permit a village or town to
escape their inquiries;--but no one had seen any person the least
answering to the description; and a few incoherent words, accompanied
by a stare of idle curiosity, was frequently the only answer they
received. Wounded where he was the most vulnerable, the distracted
Chevalier suffered the keenest anguish that circumstance could
inflict: it was too deep for utterance; but the wildness of his
aspect, and the settled paleness of his countenance, discovered the
inward working of his mind.</p>

<p>As it advanced towards mid-day, the rain gradually ceased, the sun
looked meekly from the south, and a cold driving wind assisted in
dissipating the mists, which had enveloped the faded features of the
landscape. As Enrico surveyed the cheerless face of Nature, and
contrasted it with its summer appearance, he could not forbear
applying this melancholy change to his own more desolate situation;
and sighing deeply as the idea occurred, he turned involuntarily
round to contemplate the whole of the prospect, and observed, as his
eyes glanced towards those vast mountains that rise in all forms and
directions in this picturesque country, that which he had once
rambled over with Laurette, crowned with the rustic church. A
thousand mournful reflections were now communicated to his
mind:--where was the sweet wanderer gone, who appeared like the Hebe
of that secluded retreat? If alone, how could she avoid danger? And
if conveyed away by stratagem, how was it possible she should escape
from it? The more he reflected upon the subject, the more improbable
it appeared that he should ever meet with her again; yet he steadily
resolved never to relinquish the pursuit, since life without her, who
could only make it desirable, would be a tasteless potion.</p>

<p>Several leagues had been traversed without any material event, in
which time no intelligence had been obtained, though they stopped at
all the inns and cottages on the road, as well as at the convents, to
renew their inquiries.</p>

<p>Anselmo, who was naturally volatile, preserved throughout the
whole of the journey a respectful silence. He perceived that his
beloved master's uneasiness was too deep to be diverted from its
source, and could only be removed by the success of the enterprise,
or by the slow, but certain, effects of time. Knowing with what
reluctance he stopped to obtain a sufficient portion of food, the
wary servant had procured unknown to Enrico three flasks of Florence
wine, the best that part of the country afforded, which he secured in
his wallet, to be in readiness in case of emergency.</p>

<p>About the middle of the third day the travellers left the direct
road, and struck into one which took a different direction. This path
was more rugged than the one they had left, lying for a considerable
way among gloomy forests, desert heaths, and rocky precipices. No
human abode, except a few solitary huts, appeared within the reach of
vision, whose rude inhabitants were chiefly employed in leading their
goats from the shrubby tops of the mountains to the tinkling of a
bell, or the soft breathings of a flute, or in seeking for the
moss-lined nest of the marmot amid the clefts of the rocks. These
wandering rustics were frequently addressed by Anselmo; but his
interrogatories were usually answered with rudeness, or at best with
incivility.</p>

<p>The scene now gradually became more barren; yet, though destitute
of the accompaniment of trees, it was still highly interesting and
charming to the admirers of romantic imagery. Large masses of granite
scowled beneath the eye, and mountains, whose crested summits
penetrated into the clouds, considerably augmented that sensation of
solitary sublimity that overwhelms and astonishes the mind of the
spectator.</p>

<p>The melancholy air of neglect and depopulation, which was on every
side discernible, unenlivened by sun, threw a melancholy calm over
the spirits of our hero, though they tended not to subdue the energy
of his soul. As the evening advanced, a dark line of threatening
clouds, rolling in vast volumes round the heads of the eminences,
were productive of an effect, at once awful and sublime, which was
heightened by the scream of the eagle returning to her lofty abode,
or the repeated cries of the kestril, or the wurchangel, sated with
the triumph of rapacious pursuit.</p>

<p>Anselmo, alarmed and intimidated at the gloomy appearance of
Nature, aided by the approach of night, looked wistfully around for
some hospitable retreat; but they had now passed near a league beyond
the huts of the peasantry, and no place of security was to be seen.
The path, which had long wound among the mountains, now directed them
by a precipitant descent into a deep and extensive valley, bordered
with wood, and interspersed with lakes. Though this new scene
afforded more appearance of vegetation than those they had quitted,
the entangled thickets being occasionally intermingled with a variety
of dark firs and evergreen oaks, still it wore an aspect of
melancholy and desolation; the luxuriance that clothed the lofty side
of the glen being no where else perceptible, whilst the uncultivated
mountain and the frowning precipice were still the principal objects
of this lonely, yet sublime landscape, rising into the most majestic
and yet terrifying forms that imagination could conceive. A branch of
the Danube, rushing impetuously over several large fragments of
broken rock, only disturbed the universal silence, rendering the
effect of the whole more awfully impressive, as it foamed with
dreadful and inconceivable rapidity through the intervals between the
masses of rock that formed the bed of the torrent. It was with much
difficulty that they were enabled to proceed through this deep and
rough glen, rendered dangerous by the advance of night, and the
motion of this boisterous stream, which rushed impetuously in a
series of broken cascades, till it precipitated itself, with the
force of a cataract, into the bosom of the parent river. They now
continued their way, through long and winding sheep-walks, towards
the extremity of the valley, till they reached the border of a small
clear lake, which again intercepted their path. Here amid long grass,
weeds, and rushes, the solitary bittern had long fixed her abode, who
having shaken off her autumnal indolence, was seen rising in a spiral
ascent, filling the air with her cries, till she was lost in the
immensity of distance. Night, which now closed in, brought them to
the edge of a forest, dark, dreary, and almost inaccessible. As they
advanced, the gloom became more profound, and the clouds, which had
long been gathering over their heads, discharged their humid
contents: even Enrico felt appalled, and turned to descry, if
possible, some place of security. Anselmo was still more anxious to
obtain an hospitable shelter, but no vestige of habitation was to be
seen; and the latter, encouraged by the example of his master,
ventured, though reluctantly, to proceed. A path cut in the forest
directed them along till they had reached that dreary and
unfrequented spot, known to the traveller by the name of the Jammer
Holtz, or Wood of Groans, situated near the Ghorde. This place, which
cannot fail of exciting in the occasional visiter a sensation of fear
and horror, did not lose its accustomed effect, and they were each
for the moment irresolute whether to venture into the interior of the
forest, or to return towards the skirts of it, and await the approach
of morning.</p>

<p>Anselmo, though he disdained the imputation of cowardice, pleaded
warmly for the former plan, observing that there were several trees,
whose interwoven branches were capable of affording them security
from the storm; and that in such a situation they would be in less
danger of becoming a prey to banditti, or to the beasts that infested
the deserts. Impatient of delay, Enrico did not yield immediately to
the proposition; but was giving it a second review, when Anselmo
perceived a light glimmering through the wood at no considerable
distance from that part of it in which they were stationed: it cast
only a faint gleam, and from the waving of the trees was seen only at
intervals; yet they were soon convinced that it proceeded from a
taper, and not from one of those watery exhalations, which in low
boggy grounds frequently leads the traveller astray. Elated by this
unexpected adventure, they dismounted, and tying their horses to the
stump of an oak, advanced towards the place. The storm was now past,
and the moon, emerging from a cloud, threw her soft light upon the
tops of the trees, and discovered half hid, among the unfoliated
branches, the shattered wing of a hunting villa. It appeared to have
been once a stately structure, but now exhibited an air of extreme
neglect and desolation. Part of the portico was still visible; but
the pillars, which were broken and decayed, scarcely supported its
roof. A small court led to the door, which was scattered over with
masses of the ruined edifice. It had once been paved; but the stones
were so much broken, that several self-planted trees had established
themselves in its area, which exalted their tall heads above the
mouldering walls that inclosed them. A light still gleamed from a
window, and having with much difficulty made their way through the
heaps of rubbish that on every side obstructed their path, they
arrived at the entrance, hoping in this long-neglected spot, which,
doubtless, from the circumstance of the taper, contained some
solitary inhabitant, to gain admittance for the night. Anselmo
advancing first, heaved a large rusty knocker, whose sullen sound was
awfully reverberated through the building, but no answering footstep
approached. Again they repeated the summons, but no one appeared; nor
was any sound to be heard but the deep murmurs of the wind, which
blew in rising gusts round the decayed mansion, and the loud roar of
a distant cataract. In a few moments the light receded, but no human
being was visible; and half-despairing of success, the unfortunate
travellers walked round the edifice to discover if it was possible to
obtain admission at another door; but no other entrance appeared, and
they were returning hopelessly towards that which they had quitted,
when a deep groan, proceeding from a kind of grate, or loop-hole,
again riveted their attention.</p>

<p>'Some one is suffering here,' cried Enrico, recalled from his
abstraction by this new incident, 'and Providence has, perhaps in
mercy, conducted us to this place for their deliverance. Let us make
another attempt, and if we are still unsuccessful, we will address
the prisoner, and, if possible, afford assistance.'</p>

<p>Anselmo did not wait for a second command, but sprang hastily
round, whilst Enrico lingered for some moments behind, with his eyes
fixed in astonishment upon the ivyed arch of the window, in hopes, as
the moon still shone full upon it, of being able to discern the
unfortunate sufferer who had thus interested his compassion. The
groan was not repeated; but, assured that it was not fancy, having
heard it distinctly in the pauses of the wind, he determined not to
leave this melancholy abode till the affair was investigated. Grown
desperate by delay, Anselmo again thundered at the door, and on
hearing a slow measured step advance towards the entrance, called
loudly to his master. Enrico instantly appeared, and the door being
opened by a being, whose aspect indicated the extreme of guilt and
wretchedness, they were asked who they were, and what had directed
them thither? Enrico, after informing him that they were benighted
travellers, who requested a lodging for the night, put a ducat into
his hand, and besought admittance. The haggard wretch, whose meagre
countenance was distorted by a long connexion with vice and misery,
having already the splendid present in possession, would have closed
the door upon his necessitous guests, had not our hero, who was aware
of his design, assured him that if he would allow them to remain
there during the night, he would present him with twice the sum on
their departure.</p>

<p>This was a bribe too considerable to be rejected, and having
thrown open the door, which he had held half closed in his hand, they
were admitted into the interior of the structure. They then proceeded
through a long dark passage, in which opened two doors on contrary
directions, that on the right leading into a large desolate hall, and
the opposite one into a kind of kitchen, which the stranger observed
was the room usually inhabited by himself, and the only one with
which they could be accommodated during their continuance in the
mansion. This miserable apartment contained no other furniture than a
few broken chairs, an old worm-eaten cupboard occupying one of the
angles, a Norway oak table, whose grotesque frame was cut into
numerous devices, and an ancient time-piece, which was erected as a
fixture, and seemed, from the antiquity of its appearance, to be
nearly co-existent with the building. There was no fire, though it
was the middle of winter, and the room consequently rendered
intensely cold by several apertures in the wall, which admitted the
bleak winds of the east. Anselmo complaining of the chill air,
besought the stranger to kindle a fire upon the hearth, and also to
prepare them some refreshment. Masehero, which was the name of the
host, eyeing him askance as he made the request, replied sullenly
that he had no food in the house, except a few barley cakes, and a
dish of goat's milk, which were both of them stale and unpalatable.
Enrico desiring that he would bring these, and also some wood to
kindle a fire, the stranger took the lamp from the table, and
withdrew. Anselmo knowing that his master's thoughts were partly
absorbed in a new subject of astonishment, proposed that they should
engage their host in conversation during the greater part of the
night, and take an opportunity of searching the mansion when he was
overpowered by sleep.</p>

<p>'How can this possibly be effected?' replied Enrico, hastily; 'if
he has an important secret in his possession, it is unlikely he
should be so little on his guard as to disclose it. Force is the only
means that can be adopted with success: and though I should
unwillingly spill the blood of a wretch like this, if innocence can
by no other method be released from the grasp of oppression, we must
submit to necessity.'</p>

<p>'I have something in my wallet though,' returned Anselmo, rising
with a look of self-complacency, 'which, if properly applied, may be
of use notwithstanding, as it sometimes brings to confession as
completely and instantaneously as the most acute tortures of the
inquisition.'</p>

<p>Enrico turned to him with a look of inquiry, and could not forbear
smiling when he saw him select from his store two flasks of wine
which he had thus fortunately procured. The matter was now hastily
determined; the liquor was to be presented to Masehero, who would
doubtless receive it with pleasure, and if it failed in the design of
making him sufficiently communicative, it would, at least, from its
inebriating qualities, lull him into a state of insensibility, till
they had explored the different apartments in the ruin, and had
accomplished their design.</p>

<p>In a short time the gloomy and sullen inhabitant of this miserable
abode returned with a log of wood, and a bundle of sticks. There was
no grate remaining; but throwing the fuel upon the hearth, a fire was
instantly kindled, and his guests, who had been long shivering with
cold, drew close to the blaze. The barley cakes were then placed upon
the table, with a small bowl of goat's milk, and a large old horn, to
be used as a drinking vessel. Anselmo, who was too hungry to be nice,
eyed them with satisfaction, whilst Enrico, though little inclined to
partake of this coarse, unpalatable fare, attempted to eat. The wine
was then produced, and the stranger was requested to taste of it. He
assented. It was a liquor he had been long unused to. The lineaments
of his face seemed to lose their hardness, and he began to join in
the conversation. Enrico demanded if the mansion contained any other
tenant? and being answered in the negative, discontinued the inquiry.
Finding from his name, as well as from his accents, that he was an
Italian.</p>

<p>Anselmo availed himself of this discovery, by claiming him as a
countryman, and asking several questions concerning his family and
former residence; but the recluse was too wary not to elude his
inquiries, and soon convinced his guests that he had previously
determined never to unfold any particular with which they were at
present unacquainted. The wine now went cheerfully round; Masehero
drank plentifully, and was soon so much elevated as not to perceive
that Enrico and his servant, after having taken a very small
quantity, were satisfied with only raising it to their lips.</p>

<p>Accustomed only to spare and meagre diet, it soon arrested his
faculties, and before he had drained the second flask, he fell back
on his chair, and closing his eyes, sunk into a fast sleep. The
success of the design elated the spirits of our travellers, who
anticipated with pleasure the full accomplishment of the project they
had so artfully imagined. Anxious to commence the pursuit, Anselim
arose from his seat, and taking the lamp from the table, moved it
slowly towards the corner, in which Masehero was placed, to observe
if his slumbers were sound. The lids of his eyes did not move, and
being convinced that he was perfectly insensible, he was going to
make a sign for his master to proceed, when he perceived a small
dagger just appearing beneath the cloak of the stranger. The policy
of securing this instantly occurred, and drawing it carefully from
its concealment, he presented it with an air of triumph to his
master, telling him, at the same time, in a low voice, that he was
ready to accompany him. Enrico, having extended his arm to grasp this
instrument of death, started when he examined the blade, which was
apparently rusted with blood. He, however, repressed the expression
of his astonishment, and desiring Anselmo to follow him, quitted the
room, without neglecting the necessary precaution of fastening the
door on the other side, which was easily effected by means of a bolt.
This, from long disuse, could not be managed without some little
noise; but the loud breathings of Masehero convinced them that he
still slept. Having previously secured the lamp, they advanced along
the hall, and departing through a contrary door, which directed them
into a long vaulted passage, they were enabled to find their way
through many intricate windings to a stone stair-case. These steps,
which were mouldering into ruins, led them into a wide dreary
gallery, in which opened several rooms. Anselmo, being naturally
superstitious, followed slowly behind, and as the hollow gusts of
wind hurried through the deserted passages, expected every moment to
see the form of a spectre gliding into the remote corners; but
ashamed of confessing his fears in the presence of his master, he
remained silent, whilst Enrico took a general survey of the old
chambers through which they passed. All that had hitherto fallen
under their observation were unfurnished. The casements were gone,
the walls were in several places decayed and mouldered into dust,
whilst the yarrow, the nettle, and other weedy shrubs, which had
taken root in the interstices of the broken stones, were seen waving
through the apertures. Birds of prey had long lived unmolested in
this dreary building, and seemed, from long possession, to have laid
claim to the most considerable part of it. The sight of the lamp,
however, put many of them to flight, whose screams resounding through
the whole range of apartments, had a dreadful and solemn effect.
Unappalled by these terrors, Enrico reached the extent of the
gallery, and undrawing a rusty bolt, opened the door of the only room
which had not before fallen under his notice. This chamber was of a
triangular form, low, gloomy, and extensive, containing nothing like
furniture except a small mattress at the farther end of it, a stool,
and a broken table. A high narrow grate was the only means of
admitting the light, and from the whole of its appearance, it seemed
to have been originally intended for a prison. Being well assured,
from the direction of the window, that this was the room from whence
the groan proceeded, Enrico desiring Anselmo to wait without the
door, advanced towards that corner where the mattress was laid, and
beheld, to his unutterable astonishment, the figure of a female,
whose face was covered with a veil, apparently asleep! Enrico's
breast now throbbed with new emotion; his heart beat quick, his limbs
trembled, and a feverish heat pervaded his whole frame. Having
proceeded within a few steps of the bed, he placed the lamp upon the
floor, and turning the veil gently aside, beheld the pale, yet
lovely, countenance of Laurette! She started, but did not awake, and
never did Enrico discover so much self-command as at this moment.
Rapture and tenderness struggled in his breast, and scarcely could he
stifle those feelings which would have prompted him to clasp her
wildly to his heart, and awaken her to a sense of unexpected
happiness. But a moment's reflection was sufficient to convince him
that such a conduct might be attended with danger; joy might operate
too powerfully upon a frame enervated by sorrow, and he prudently
resolved to send Anselmo to watch by her till she awaked, and gently
to prepare her for an interview; yet, after having thus determined,
he could not deny himself the luxury of gazing once more upon her
beautiful face. Her slumbers seemed now to be tranquil, yet mournful
visions had recently been presented to her fancy, for her cheek was
still wet with tears.</p>

<p>As he stooped to take up the lamp, which he had placed by the side
of the mattress, he observed a small book, bound in red leather, that
he instantly knew to have been his own, and which he recollected to
have left at the castle of Lunenburg. He took it up, and saw on the
blank leaf that she had been attempting to sketch his likeness.
Memory had been too faithful to its task not to portray his exact
resemblance, and charmed with this new proof of her affection, all
his senses were absorbed in delight and rapture.</p>

<p>Fearing Laurette should awake, and endure an agony of surprise,
which, during her present state of indisposition, might overpower her
faculties, and plunge her again into insensibility, he receded
towards the door, and calling Anselmo gently forwards, who had
remained in the passage whilst his master explored the apartment, he
informed him who the prisoner was, and instructed him in what manner
to proceed.</p>

<p>The delighted servant could scarcely suppress the acknowledgment
of his joy, and taking the lamp, with a heart bounding with rapture,
promised strictly to observe the rules which had been prescribed; and
entering the chamber, placed himself as far as possible from the
mattress, but in such a situation, that he might easily observe her
motion. Enrico, in the meantime, waited impatiently in the gallery,
whilst love, tenderness, and astonishment took possession of his
mind. How she had been conveyed thither, by whom, and for what
purpose, was as marvellous as inexplicable; and the more he reflected
upon the subject, the more intricate and wonderful it appeared.</p>

<p>'The wretch,' cried he,'who occupies the mansion, is undoubtedly
an assassin! The dagger, rusted with blood, is an undeniable proof of
it: was it then intended that her innocent life should be sacrificed?
If so, who could instigate the wretch to so horrid a deed--a deed so
disgraceful to humanity, that none but fiends could reflect upon it
without shuddering!'</p>

<p>Unable to solve this mystery, the mind of Enrico suffered a tumult
of distracting surmises, till the soft voice of Laurette, that dear,
that well-known voice, wrapped him in attention. She was uttering
something in a tone of supplication, but the words were
undistinguishable, for they were low and inarticulate; yet it was
easy to ascertain that Anselmo was offering something of condolence,
which she did not clearly understand. Still he listened in hopes of
distinguishing her words, till he heard a faint scream, not
expressive of terror, but of mingled surprise and rapture, which was
instantly succeeded by the name of Enrico, pronounced in those sweet,
those melting accents, which had ever possessed such powers of
enchantment over him. Unable to endure longer suspense, he did not
wait to be recalled; but rushing precipitately from his concealment,
darted into the room, whilst joy of the most ecstatic kind pained and
agitated his breast.</p>

<p>Laurette had just risen from the mattress when he entered, and
being weak, almost to fainting, was obliged to lean against the wall
for support. As soon as she beheld him, from whom she believed
herself separated for ever, her soft bosom throbbed with new emotion,
and the powers of utterance forsook her; but as Enrico, with all the
enthusiasm of affection, called wildly upon her name, her beautiful
eyes were turned towards him with a look so full of affection and
tenderness, that his feelings arose almost to agony.</p>

<p>'And is it possible,' cried Enrico, pressing her gently to his
heart, whilst his words were almost stifled with transport, 'that I
have at last found her whom I so hopelessly sought? Oh Laurette! from
this moment one destiny shall unite us; we will separate no
more.'</p>

<p>The fair captive attempted to reply, but tears of joy prevented
her utterance; and as Enrico surveyed her pallid cheek, her thin
emaciated form, and every symptom of alarming indisposition,
solicitude succeeded to rapture, and anxious as he was to be made
acquainted with every particular relative to this mysterious event,
he forbore making any immediate inquiry concerning it. As soon as the
first tumults of joy were subsided, Laurette, who was unable to move
without assistance, and whose delicate frame was still more weakened
by this sudden, though joyful, surprise, sat down upon the mattress,
whilst Enrico, after having dispatched Anselmo to convey the
remaining part of the wine, and some of the barley cake, which had
been left in the room where Maschero was confined, seated himself by
her side, supporting her with his arm, which encircled her waist,
whilst tears of tenderness and compassion fell copiously from his
eyes, as he marked the ravages grief had already made upon her
angelic countenance.</p>

<p>As soon as Laurette had taken a small quantity of the wine and
cake, which Anselmo had fortunately removed without awakening his
host, and had received fresh assurances from Enrico that she was safe
from the power of the assassin, and that no danger was likely to
befal him or his servant on her account, she felt considerably
revived, and joined with her enraptured lover in returning thanks to
Heaven for having thus sent her a deliverer. Anselmo could not
forbear weeping for joy; his master's happiness was inseparable from
his own, and he could not, nor did he attempt to conceal his
transports.</p>

<p>Laurette, having convinced Enrico that her indisposition entirely
proceeded from want of rest and necessary food, besought him to leave
her alone, and in the meantime to endeavour to procure some sleep in
one of the adjoining apartments, as she was assured from his
appearance he was in want of repose, promising on his return she
would gratify his curiosity respecting her present confinement. As it
yet wanted some hours of day, he assented, observing it was more for
her sake than his own that he was prevailed upon to leave her.
Laurette rewarded his acquiescence with a smile, and pressing her
hand to his lips as he bade her adieu, he quitted the chamber.</p>

<p>Anselmo recollecting that, in one of the unoccupied apartments, he
had seen a large old piece of tapestry lying at one corner of it,
which appeared formerly to have been used as a floor-cloth, assured
his master that this would make a most excellent bed, and that he
would engage, with the assistance of an old blanket that lay by the
side of it, to make him a more comfortable one than he had enjoyed
for some time. Enrico remarking that the assertion was by no means
improbable, since his couch, in whatever situation, had of late been
a thorny one, desired him to prepare it; adding, with a smile, that
the knight, who came to relieve distressed damsels, must not be
afraid of a few temporary inconveniences.</p>

<p>The tapestry being spread in several folds upon the broken floor
of a remote chamber, which was selected by Anselmo from the rest,
because the walls were more entire, Enrico lay down to rest; but as
joy is as great an enemy to repose as grief, he did not feel the
least inclination to sleep. His servant, at his desire, partook of
the bed he had so judiciously formed, as well as of the tattered
blanket, which served them both as a covering.</p>

<p>In this situation they remained till the morning dawned faintly
through the narrow shattered lattice of their room, which was so
fringed with weeds, that the sun was scarcely ever admitted.</p>

<h3>Chapter 5</h3>

Can such things be?
And overcome us like a summer's cloud.
Without our special wonder!
Blood will have blood;
Stones have been made to move, and trees to speak:
Augurs and understood relations have.
By magpies, and by choughs and rooks, brought forth
The secret man of blood.
--SHAKESPEARE
</pre>

<p>Anselmo's mind not being harassed with such a variety of strange
surmises as his master's, he sunk into a quiet slumber, from which he
did not awake till it was light; when, having forgotten the reality
of his situation in the visions of his fancy, he could not forbear
uttering an exclamation of astonishment; but soon recollecting the
past, he turned round to inquire of Enrico in what manner Maschero
was to be disposed of, who would probably soon become sensible to his
confinement, when he beheld with amazement that his master had
quitted his side. Starting instantly from the bed, he hastened into
the gallery, where he soon discovered him taking a general survey of
the building; endeavouring by these means to beguile the tedious
moments that must elapse before Laurette would again admit him into
the interior of her prison.</p>

<p>As they passed along one of the apartments, whose barred casements
looked into the court, they perceived a board to shake under their
feet, which, on examination, was found to be loose and unfixed.</p>

<p>'This is surely a trap-door,' cried Anselmo, with evident
astonishment, 'which leads into some strange, and still more dreary,
place. Let us explore it, Signor; who knows but we may find some
hidden treasure.'</p>

<p>Enrico made no reply; but desirous of being convinced whether it
was really a door, and if so, to what part of the ruin it led,
attempted to unclose it. He was not long unsuccessful, and on heaving
up the board, discovered that it opened upon a flight of steps, which
being steep, broken, and decayed, perfectly corresponded with the
rest. These they immediately descended, and soon found themselves in
a dismal old chamber, which contained, amongst a considerable
quantity of lumber, a large oak chest.</p>

<p>This, on opening, they perceived to be empty; but the lid was no
sooner closed, than it occurred to Enrico, that, from its external
appearance, it probably contained a false bottom. Having communicated
his thoughts to Anselmo, the chest was again examined, and the
suspicion ascertained not to have been groundless. The
artfully-contrived board was speedily removed, and our travellers
beheld, to their mutual astonishment, the plumed helmet of a warrior,
a military habit, with several other articles of dress, stained with
blood; an unsheathed sword rusted by time, and a cross of the order
of St Julias. Enrico started with an emotion of horror as he surveyed
them, whilst Anselmo observed, with a shuddering sensation,
accompanied by an expressive shake of the head, that there had been
some foul play there.</p>

<p>'Gracious Heaven!' exclaimed Enrico, recovering from the stupor of
amazement into which he had been plunged, 'What do these garments
mean, and with whose blood are they stained?'</p>

<p>Anselmo, who had been examining them severally as his master
spoke, took up a piece of linen, which seemed to be connected with
the rest of the apparel; this was literally dyed in gore, and as he
extended his arm to display it to Enrico, it dropped into pieces with
age.</p>

<p>'The unfortunate being who owned these things' cried Anselmo,
piteously, 'has long since been at rest. Can you conjecture, Signor,
whose they could have been?'</p>

<p>'Your question is a strange one,' returned Enrico, 'since I cannot
possibly ascertain to whom the ruin belongs, much less can I form any
idea of its present possessor; and even could that be discovered, I
should still be as far from the point as to the murder committed in
it.'</p>

<p>'But one may form some kind of a notion about it, Signor?'</p>

<p>'Indeed! then you have more penetration than I have, who am unable
to form any judgment upon the subject.'</p>

<p>'I do not mean to insinuate that I have more penetration than you,
Signor. Do not mistake me; but it is reduced to a certainty that
blood has been spilled-ah! and in this very place; the garments are
here to attest the truth of the assertion.'</p>

<p>'There is sufficient testimony of that,' returned Enrico; 'but I
thought you was endeavouring to discover the authors of this
assassination, and was applying to me for assistance.'</p>

<p>'That was not the case, Signor; you never will understand me
without I speak directly to the purpose. The whole of the affair then
is this: If you think as I do, you will from these evidences believe,
that this old building belongs to some great man, who keeps it as a
kind of slaughter-house, that when any one offends him, or stands in
the way of his advancement, he may send him to an eternal sleep
without making any one the wiser.'</p>

<p>Enrico appeared thoughtful, but made no reply; and Anselmo, having
replaced the bloody garments in the chest, disposing them in the same
manner as before, followed him up the steps. Scarcely had they
reached the trap-door leading into the chamber, before a loud
knocking at the outer gate filled them with new astonishment.</p>

<p>'Mercy upon us!' cried Anselmo, 'the ghost is surely coming to
revenge himself upon us for disturbing his old clothes; for what
human being would think of coming to such a place as this? If it is
man, I can soon do for him; for I have a weapon here,' resumed he,
taking the rusty dagger from his girdle, 'that will do his business
quickly--ah! and one too that, by the appearance of the blade, seems
to have been well employed; but, if it should be a spirit, Oh Sancta
Maria! Signor! what can we do with that?'</p>

<p>Enrico, without waiting till Anselmo had concluded his harangue,
walked towards the window which opened into the court, and beheld, to
his unspeakable surprise, four armed men taking a survey of the
edifice. At first he imagined them to have been banditti, who
infested the woods in the night, and were accustomed to inhabit a
part of the building during the day; but the appearance of him who
seemed to direct the motions of the rest, indicated nothing of the
kind.</p>

<p>The alarm was now repeated, which being aided by the yells of
Maschero, who had just discovered his confinement, had altogether a
dreadful effect. Afraid that Laurette, from being ignorant of the
cause, might be disturbed and affrighted, Enrico ran hastily to her
room. She was just awake, and seemed better. The knocking still
continuing, she inquired the cause; and on his assuring her that
nothing was the matter, and that he would speedily return to her, she
consented to be left.</p>

<p>Not knowing whether the intentions of the strangers were hostile
or otherwise, Anselmo took the dagger from beneath his cloak, whilst
Enrico, clapping his hand upon the hilt of his sword, in an attitude
of defence, proceeded towards the door.</p>

<p>The person, who appeared to be the leader, advanced first with a
stately and dignified air. He seemed to have passed the autumn of
life, for locks of grey shaded his forehead, and his face was marked
with the lines of age. Struck with the benignity of his aspect,
Enrico raised his hand involuntarily from his sword, and courteously
bowing, offered him admittance. The stranger, after surveying him a
moment in silence, turned to the men, and said, 'There must be some
mistake; this is not the person we were taught to expect.'</p>

<p>'May I be allowed to understand the motive of this visit?' cried
Enrico, addressing himself to him who was evidently the superior,
'possibly I may be enabled to solve this difficulty.'</p>

<p>The stranger gave an assenting nod; and then desiring the men, who
had accompanied him, to await his orders in the wood, followed his
conductor into the hall; not without frequently turning an inquiring
eye towards the place from whence the cries of Maschero
proceeded.</p>

<p>'I will unravel this mysterious affair immediately,' resumed
Enrico, finding his new acquaintance was much interested in these
expressions of distress, 'when we have reached a place convenient for
the purpose.' His guest again bowed, and continued to follow him.</p>

<p>The only seats they were able to find, were two large stones which
had fallen from the ceiling at the farther end of the hall, but by
these they were tolerably well accommodated; and the stranger having
again fixed his eyes upon the intelligent countenance of our hero
with new astonishment, requested to be made acquainted with his name;
and since it was impossible that neglected solitude could be his
residence, by what strange combination of circumstances he had been
directed thither.</p>

<p>Enrico did not keep him in suspense. He related his name, at least
the only one he had ever known, that of Chamont, and informed him
briefly of the most interesting events of his past life, as far as
was connected with the subject upon which they had touched; including
the mysterious manner in which his mother had disappeared, Laurette's
residence with the Marchese, her precipitate retreat from the castle,
though in what manner had not been investigated, and how strangely,
how miraculously she had been discovered in the prison of the ruin;
which little narrative he concluded, by declaring the means that had
been employed to intoxicate the assassin, who, he had every reason to
believe, meditated her death, though he had at present taken no
desperate method to accomplish it.</p>

<p>The stranger could scarcely wait for the conclusion; but throwing
his arms round the neck of Enrico, he exclaimed, in an agony of joy,
'Are you then the son of Madame Chamont, the noblest, the most
amiable of women? And shall I, by presenting you to her after this
long, this hopeless absence, be enabled to discharge some part of
that vast debt of gratitude which I owe her. Behold in me the Conte
della Croisse, the once wretched La Roque, who, but for her
interference, must have perished in a dungeon.'</p>

<p>Enrico's amazement increased; he had never heard the name of Della
Croisse uttered by any one except Father Benedicta; and the little he
had been able to gain from what that Monk had inadvertently dropped,
was so wrapped in obscurity, that no opinion could be formed upon the
subject. But as the Conte's exclamation indicated that he was not
only formerly known to his mother, but was actually acquainted with
her present place of residence, his raptures could not be repressed;
and falling at the feet of his venerable guest, he besought him with
tears to inform him immediately where his revered parent was removed,
and whether he could not instantly be with her. Della Croisse's heart
melted within him when he beheld these effusions of affection; and so
much was the sensibility of his nature excited, that it was some time
before he could command his feelings sufficiently to comply with the
request. But finding his auditor could no longer endure a state of
suspense and anxiety, he informed him that Madame Chamont was in a
place of security not many leagues distant from the wood; and that he
might soon have an opportunity of being introduced to her, and of
bestowing upon this excellent parent that unexpected and exalted
happiness which his presence would inevitably confer.</p>

<p>'Having been recently apprized,' continued the Conte, 'of the
alarming situation of the lovely young captive, with whose fate I
find you are already acquainted, I brought a carriage to convey her
from this place to the convent in which Madame Chamont has found a
secure asylum.'</p>

<p>'My mother is then safe in a convent,' repeated Enrico,
rapturously.</p>

<p>'She is,' returned the Conte; 'and not having remained resident
there long enough to have commenced Nun, according to the established
rules of the Institution, will have no objection to remove from
it.</p>

<p>'I have many circumstances to unfold,' continued Della Croisse,
'in which you are materially interested, and must therefore request
you will allow me a patient hearing.'</p>

<p>Enrico bowed assent; but fearing lest Laurette should be uneasy at
his absence, excused himself for a moment before the Conte began his
recital, and hastened to her apartment. She had been expecting him
for some time with a degree of painful anxiety; but his presence soon
relieved her from uneasy apprehension, and after having taken, at his
desire, a small portion more of the wine and cake, which had been
left on the preceding night, he again quitted the room, with an
assurance that he would return to her as soon as suitable
arrangements were made relative to their intended departure.</p>

<p>The cries of Maschero still continuing to resound through the
edifice, producing a melancholy and dreadful effect, Enrico found it
necessary to silence him, by asserting that, since his criminal
intentions were discovered, his only hopes of obtaining that mercy he
had so little reason to expect, rested upon the compassion of his
judges, and the purity of his future conduct.</p>

<p>This had the desired effect, and Enrico, being anxious to hear the
important incidents which were shortly to be unfolded by the Conte
della Croisse, again seated himself upon the stone by his side, and
besought him to proceed.</p>

<p>'As it is necessary,' replied the venerable guest, 'that we should
remove from this place as speedily as possible, I shall relate all
briefly. You are, doubtless, informed that your birth is supposed by
all, even by your mother, who is, notwithstanding, Virtue herself, to
have been illegitimate.' Enrico shuddered, and looked surprised.</p>

<p>'You are, I say,' added the Conte, 'universally considered as the
illegal offspring of the Marchese de Montferrat.'</p>

<p>'Impossible!' returned Enrico impetuously. 'Who dares to asperse
the character of my mother?'</p>

<p>'None, none,' replied the Conte, 'can cast a shade upon her
spotless reputation: I would myself defend her with my life from the
shafts of calumny and malice; grant me but patience, and you shall
hear the whole. The Marchese de Montferrat is your father; you are
his lawful child, and consequently the next heir to his title and
possessions.</p>

<p>'Great Heaven, is it possible!' cried Enrico, lifting up hands and
eyes in astonishment; 'and is this mystery but just unravelled?'</p>

<p>'The death of a wretch,' returned the Conte, 'who has been long
initiated in all the arts of cunning, and who has long secretly
sought my destruction, could only have unravelled it. The monster to
whom I allude, is the Marchese's steward; you are assuredly
acquainted with his character?'</p>

<p>'Is Paoli then dead?' interrupted Enrico.</p>

<p>'The same,' replied Della Croisse. 'That death, he so long
meditated against me, he received at my hands: I met with him by
accident, or rather by the direction of an interposing Providence;
for to attribute such events to blind chance is impious. He attacked
me; I was fortunately armed, and being aware of his infamous design,
before he could disengage the stiletto from his cloak, plunged mine
into his heart. He groaned, and fell; but his breathing convinced me
he was still alive. Little as he merited compassion, I found my
breast was not steeled against its influence; and ordering my
servants, who were not far behind, to convey the assassin to an inn,
I followed him, and sent for assistance. The wound was pronounced
mortal; but the effect was not instantaneous, as it allowed time for
the confession of his crimes. He informed me that Madame Chamont was
placed in a convent, whither she was to have remained for life; in
which seclusion more than ordinary restrictions were exercised over
her. That, by the express orders of the Marchese, she was not
permitted to write from the cloister; and the more effectually to
prevent the circulation of letters between her and her son, she was
taught to believe that he had been killed in an engagement, and that
Laurette, her adopted daughter, was already united to a young
Nobleman, selected for her by her guardian.</p>

<p>'He then informed me,' resumed the Conte, 'that this fair young
creaturewas the daughter of the Conte Della Caro, whose father was
murdered in a wood by a wretch hired for the purpose by order of the
Marchese de Montferrat, who, if he died childless, was the next heir
to his estates; but as the Contessa brought forth an infant soon
afterwards, it was necessary that this also should be removed. Some
qualms of conscience seizing upon the Marchese at this time,
prevented him from sacrificing the child; but as to secrete it was
indispensably requisite, he found means of doing this so
efficaciously, that no one suspected his design, every body supposing
that the infant expired with its mother, who lived only to give it
birth. Some peculiar circumstances had, he added, induced the
Marchese to believe the mysteries respecting her origin had been
unfolded to Laurette; but who the person was who had obtained and
conveyed this intelligence could not be ascertained, as no one, he
had imagined, had gained any certain information upon the subject.
This, together with her beauty and inimitable accomplishments,
instigated him to offer her his hand, as a means of securing the
secret to themselves; but, contrary to his expectation, this was
resolutely refused, and finding from another conversation with her,
and the discovery of a picture, bearing the resemblance of her
mother, the Contessa della Caro, that she had been previously made
acquainted with the secret of her birth, he had at last determined
upon her death.</p>

<p>'He then declared to me,' continued the Conte, 'whither she was
conveyed; at the same time giving me so minute a description of the
assassin employed, as to render a mistake impossible. Not expecting,
therefore, to meet any other being than the forlorn and guilty wretch
I was in search of, you may easily conceive my astonishment when I
beheld you, apparently an inhabitant of the ruin, at the time of my
arrival.'--Here the Conte remained silent, and Enrico, after
acknowledging his gratitude for the active part he had taken, and
expressing his surprise at the interesting events that had been
recounted, demanded in what convent Madame Chamont was now resident,
and how the legality of her marriage with the Marchese de Montferrat
was to be proved, since the person, by whom the confession had been
made, was removed by death.</p>

<p>'The convent in which your mother is placed is not far from this
place,' returned the Conte; 'she is in a society of reformed
Benedictine Nuns, of the congregation of Mount Calvary, and has
probably before this time entered into her noviciate state. As to the
priest who officiated at the marriage, being already acquainted with
his name and place of abode, there will be no difficulty in securing
him as an evidence, who will bring undeniable proofs of the truth of
the assertion.</p>

<p>'As to the murder committed on the body of the Conte della Caro,'
resumed the Conte, 'it must, if possible, be consigned to oblivion,
the offender being not only the husband of Madame Chamont, but your
father; and as the fair orphan may easily assert the justice of her
claim, without making so dreadful a disclosure, through the evidence
of the woman who acted in the capacity of nurse, the wife of Paoli,
whose testimony will be sufficient to vindicate the proceeding, and
who will be ready to appear in case of necessity.'</p>

<p>Enrico shuddered at the idea of the Marchese de Montferrat, who,
he was now convinced was his father, being brought to justice, and
inquired eagerly if it could not be prevented.</p>

<p>'Easily,' replied Della Croisse, 'if the offender will criminate
himself in a private confession, and restore Laurette to her rights,
by bestowing her upon you, and by investing you in his possessions,
at least the principal part of his property, on your nuptials, and in
the rest on his decease. But from what I was enabled to gather from
the last words of Pauli,' continued the Conte, 'the Marchese does not
consider your mother as his lawful wife; the steward having expressly
received orders from him to procure a person under the assumed habit
of an ecclesiastic to solemnize the marriage, instead of which, from
some secret motive, he applied to a secular priest, probably from
this consideration, that should the Marchese be induced to deny him
pecuniary assistance, he might, by disclosing the affair to him after
his union with the lady whom he afterwards married, procure large
sums by keeping the important secret. But this never happening in the
course of his stewardship, the Marchese, he confessed, was yet
ignorant of the truth; but the priest being yet alive, to whom I
might instantly apply, the fact would easily be proved. The
unfortunate wretch also acknowledged,' resumed the Conte, 'that he
had artfully instigated the Marchese to the murder of Laurette for
some time before the measure was adopted, fearing lest he should
succeed in gaining her affections, and by another connexion involve
him in new difficulties, as he had, he declared, suffered continual
fear and apprehension during the lifetime of the reputed Marchesa,
lest the former marriage, through the confession of the priest who
united them, should be publicly attested. The person, he likewise
informed me, who was employed to assassinate Laurette, was his
brother, a native of Italy, who had consented to execute the bloody
business, according to his engagement, in consideration of a splendid
reward. That it was their intention to have murdered her, as she
slept, on the night of their arrival at the wood, but that grief and
terror had prevented her from yielding to repose; and being each
unwilling to undertake the task allotted to them, during his
continuance with Maschero, they had mutually agreed to leave her to
perish by famine, having previously determined in what manner the
body was to be disposed of, which was to be entombed in an obscure
part of the forest. The wretch, who was necessary to the crime, whom
he had acknowledged for his brother, he commended to my mercy; and
having particularly directed me to this place, soon afterwards
expired in inexpressible agony and horror.'</p>

<p>Enrico, who had listened with increasing amazement, now arose from
his seat, and stood for some time transfixed in astonishment. The
scenes of complicated guilt and depravity, which had been thus
wonderfully unfolded, quite overpowered him; and when he connected
the tender name of father with these enormities, the blood crept cold
through his veins, and a chilling sensation disordered his whole
frame. But as soon as his thoughts glanced upon Laurette and his
mother, dwelling upon the rapture the latter would experience on
seeing him, tears of affection and tenderness fell fast from his
eyes; and requesting that the Conte would liberate Maschero, and deal
with him as he thought proper, being in haste to depart, he flew
again to Laurette, who had been long impatiently awaiting his
return.</p>

<p>Lost in doubt and perplexity, her spirits were now nearly
exhausted; and unable to form any conjecture concerning the person
below, from what she had heard, besought him to acquaint her who he
was, and what was his business. Unwilling that she should suffer even
a transient suspense, Enrico, after some little preparation, informed
her all that he deemed necessary for her to know, concealing every
thing for the present which could excite uneasiness, and even
disclosing the joyful part of the intelligence with the utmost
circumspection. But when she was convinced that her dear-lamented
friend was in safety, and that there was a probability of her soon
being with her, joy could no longer be restrained, and tears of
tenderness and affection flowed fast upon her cheek.</p>

<p>Fearing the effect of these indulged transports upon so delicate a
frame, Enrico endeavoured to calm them by an assurance, that nothing
should prevail upon him to remove her immediately, but a promise on
her part to become more tranquil.</p>

<p>Whilst Enrico remained in the prison with Laurette, Maschero was
released from his confinement by the Conte della Croisse, on his
solemnly declaring that he would never again participate in a crime
of such magnitude. The punishment for capital offences by the German
laws, being so much worse than death itself, was held in utter
abhorrence by his lenient accuser, the wretch who has committed them
being doomed to wear that external brand of infamy which precludes,
through a miserable existence, the possibility of a return to virtue;
that probably, had he been instigated by no primary consideration, he
might have been tempted to have declined a prosecution without
reflecting that by this clemency he would be espousing the cause of
vice, and violating the laws of justice.</p>

<p>Enrico had hitherto mentioned nothing to the Conte of the strange
discovery made in the old chamber previous to his arrival; and having
now every reason to believe that the Marchese, his father, was
materially concerned in the murder, evidently committed either in or
near that place, determined to avoid it. The bloody clothes found in
the chest were once, he imagined, the property of the Conte della
Caro, who was said to have been massacred in a wood, and whose body
was either buried or concealed in some part of the ruin. But Anselmo,
not being aware of his master's intention, and being anxious to
disclose to the stranger all the wonders of the place, conducted
Della Croisse, in his absence, through the trap-door leading to the
apartment, and displayed to him the object of their mutual
surprise.</p>

<p>The Conte examined the sword, helmet, and garments severally,
without being able to ascertain the unfortunate possessor; but he no
sooner discovered the cross of the military order of knighthood, than
he was convinced that they originally belonged to the Conte della
Caro, who, he recollected, from Paoli's confession, was declared to
have been assassinated in a wood or forest. Deeming it imprudent,
however, to give Anselmo admission into the secret, he ascended the
steps, observing that the person, to whom those bloody garments had
belonged, was probably murdered by banditti, who, after having
interred the body in some adjacent place, had secured the clothes of
the deceased to prevent detection.</p>

<p>Anselmo appeared not perfectly satisfied with the conclusion, but
made no reply; and Della Croisse having returned again into the hall,
desired he would inform his master that the carriage had been waiting
for a considerable time at the skirts of the wood; and since all
preliminaries were adjusted, he was in readiness to depart.</p>

<p>Enrico, attended by the beautiful Laurette, soon entered the room;
and as she leaned gently upon his arm for support, there was
something so lovely, so interesting, in her appearance, that as Della
Croisse continued to gaze upon her with a mixture of pity and
admiration, his eyes were suddenly filled with tears; and scarcely
could he subdue his feelings sufficiently to answer the meek
effusions of her gratitude, which she bestowed upon him.</p>

<p>The party now quitted the ruin, and the armed men, who had
attended the Conte for the purpose of securing the assassin, were
discharged without executing their design. Enrico remembering the
ducats he had mentioned to Maschero as the price of their admission,
on a promise, solemnly delivered before them all, that he would quit
his present residence immediately, and endeavour to become an useful
member of society, did not withhold them. Laurette being supported,
or rather carried through the wood, was placed in the carriage with
the Conte and Enrico; the horses were consigned to the care of
Anselmo, and the whole party, thus relieved from fear and anxiety,
commenced their journey.</p>

<p>They travelled leisurely through the day, frequently stopping for
refreshment, as Laurette's weak state required the most strict care
and attention. In the evening they arrived at a small inn on the
road, not more than two leagues from the convent, where they were
enabled to procure a suitable person to attend upon Laurette, and
comfortable accommodations for the night.--During their continuance
in this place, Della Croisse acquainted Enrico with the melancholy
incidents of his past life. He also related the manner of his having
met with Madame Chamont at an inn, as she was travelling from the
hills of Mount Jura into Germany; expatiated with gratitude upon her
amiable conduct towards him and his daughter; the still greater
obligations she had conferred on him afterwards by saving him from a
miserable death; which little recital he concluded with a relation of
that part of her story which was immediately connected with his
own.</p>

<p>Enrico listened to all with a painful concern, and thought every
moment an age till he could throw himself at the feet of that beloved
parent, from whom he had been so long, so strangely separated.</p>

Bring the rath primrose that forsaken dies.
The tufted crow-toe and pale jessamine.
The white pink, and the pancy freaked with jet.
The glowing violet.
The musk-rose, and the well-attir'd woodbine.
With cowslips wan that hang the pensive head.
And every flower that sad embroidery wears.

</pre>

<p>Rest and nourishment had so happy an effect upon Laurette, that
she was enabled to prosecute her journey on the ensuing morning
without much apparent fatigue. The vehicle which had conveyed them
thither, was stationed at an early hour near the door of the inn, and
our travellers felt their hearts bound with new sensations of
pleasure when they entered it.</p>

<p>As soon as they were seated, Enrico besought Laurette to acquaint
them with all that had happened to her previous to her quitting the
castle; and also by what chance the letter which he had written to
her, remained unanswered.</p>

<p>The epistle he alluded to, she assured him, was never received;
and as letters very rarely miscarried, they were both internally
convinced that it had been intercepted. She then proceeded to inform
him of the strange events which had taken place during his absence;
what she had suffered from the unremitting assiduities of the
Marchese, his cruelty, his threats, when she repeated her resolution
of rejecting him; the conference overheard in the pavilion, and the
unaccountable manner in which she had been forced from the
chamber.</p>

<p>Enrico listened with the most earnest attention as she continued
her little affecting narrative, which was frequently interrupted by
her auditors with exclamations of surprise and horror, particularly
in that part of it which treated of the conversation supported
between the Marchese and Paoli in the room of state.</p>

<p>When the steward had conveyed her, she added, about a league from
the mansion, he endeavoured to dissipate her fears by an assurance of
protection, solemnly declaring that the Marchese had no intention of
sacrificing her life; but had determined to place her in a convent
till he could think of some other method of disposing of her more
congenial to his inclinations.--This, she acknowledged, had the
desired effect, as she now imagined that a new plan had been adopted,
less terrible than her former surmises had suggested, and the
circumstance of being confined for life in a cloister, since she now
believed herself separated for ever from her earliest and tenderest
connexions, produced reflections unattended with regret: but her late
sufferings occasioned such languor and indisposition, that they were
obliged to alight at a small inn upon the road. A fever was the
consequence of these repeated alarms, which confined her for some
days to the place, during which time she was attended only by a woman
of a very unpromising aspect; a surgeon, resident in an adjacent
village, and Paoli, who expressing the utmost impatience for her
recovery, seldom quitted the room.</p>

<p>'Ah Laurette!' interrupted Enrico, 'how providential was this
illness! But for such an event, the benevolent exertions of the Conte
della Croisse, as well as my own efforts, to inform myself of your
situation, might have been fruitless.' The fair narrator directed a
look of gratitude towards Heaven, and then continued her recital.</p>

<p>'As soon as I was able,' resumed Laurette, 'to leave this inn,
which presented very indifferent accommodations, we pursued our
journey; and firmly assured, from what Paoli had advanced, that I was
going to be secluded in some religious retirement, I made no farther
attempt to interest his compassion, or obstruct the prosecution of
his purpose.</p>

<p>'On the evening of the second day after our departure from the
inn, he informed me, that I should be at the end of my journey that
night. Again my fears began to take alarm; I looked wistfully around,
but no convent appeared. Night hung her glooms upon the landscape,
but still no hospitable asylum was to be seen. I now began to imagine
I had been deceived; apprehension succeeded to hope, and a thrilling
sensation of horror almost deprived me of reason. We then entered the
precincts of the wood, whose wildness and extent appeared dreadful.
The sterile sublimity of the rocks, which I had hitherto contemplated
with awful admiration, receded from my view. The deafening sound of
the cataract softened in a sad murmur; the wind moaned among the
trees, and the hollow sighs, that it sometimes uttered, seemed to
lament my approaching fate. As we entered the wood, the moon threw a
pale, uncertain light upon the eminences; but no sooner had we
arrived near the centre, than her beams were entirely excluded;
briars and entangled thickets frequently intercepted the path,
rendering it not more dreary than dangerous, and voices, heard at
intervals in the silence of night, filled me with new terrors. At
length a light was seen streaming through the trees, proceeding from
a distant window. I inquired to whom it belonged, and was informed it
was a house not far from the convent, which would accommodate us with
lodgings for the night. Thither, incapable of making resistance, I
suffered myself to be conveyed. Maschero gave us admittance; and
having conducted us to the liabitable part of the ruin, brought some
food. I attempted to eat, but could not; and pleading lassitude and
indisposition, requested to be directed to my room. Maschero led me
to an apartment, and after eyeing me with a malignant kind of
curiosity, withdrew, leaving me, at my desire, the lamp he had
carried, which I considered as an invaluable treasure. As soon as he
had retired, I began to examine the door, in hopes of discovering
some possible means of fastening it; but none appearing, I yielded
without restraint to the impulse of my feelings, which were now too
violent to be subdued. When I had indulged the first paroxysms of my
sorrow, I advanced towards the window, to take a minute survey of my
situation, and to ascertain if there was any apparent possibility of
escaping from it, should I be deserted by my artful conductor, and
left in the power of Maschero, whose unprepossessing appearance had
given me justly the idea of an assassin.</p>

<p>'After a night passed in the utmost distress and anxiety, I was
again visited by this emaciated figure, whose aspect had excited at
once pity and terror. He entered without seeming to recollect that
the room contained any other inhabitant, and after setting a pitcher
of water and a cake upon the floor, would have instantly withdrawn;
but I prevented his design by inquiring whether Paoli was arisen; and
being answered in the affirmative, ventured to ask if he had
mentioned any thing relative to our intended departure?'</p>

<p>"You are at the end of your journey, I believe," replied Maschero,
with a malignant smile; "and since the person who brought you has
thought proper to leave you, must make yourself contented where you
are."</p>

<p>'What I suffered from this intelligence cannot be easily imagined,
or rather what I suffered a short time afterwards; for having
fainted, I was not immediately conscious of what had passed. As soon
as I recovered, I found myself again alone. The door was fastened,
and the pitcher and the barley-cake were placed by the side of the
mattress upon which I had fallen. My distress now admitted of no
increase, death appeared unavoidable, and I now began to consider in
what manner it was likely to be executed. Sometimes I conceived it
probable that Paoli had only absented himself for a few days, for the
purpose of transacting some business in that part of the province,
and meant to return at the expiration of that time, and to fulfil his
intention. At other times, I imagined it likely that I was designedly
left to perish, either by poison or famine; and that the steward
intended to wait at a convenient distance, till after my decease,
that he might have the satisfaction of conveying the intelligence to
his Lord.</p>

<p>'Two whole days passed in this manner without any material event,
in which time no creature approached the melancholy chamber selected
for my apartment. Hunger had obliged me to take a small portion of
the cake, with which my inhospitable host had supplied me; it was
coarse and unpalatable; but being ready to sink for want of food, I
was compelled to have recourse to it. The next day this pittance was
exhausted, and I soon discovered that it was not the intention of my
gaoler to present me with more, who having closed the door upon me
when I was in a state of insensibility, meant never more to break in
upon my solitude with a repetition of his services.</p>

<p>'As night advanced, I felt my indisposition considerably
augmented; a death-like faintness was communicated to my heart, and
placing myself again upon the mattress, I endeavoured to resign
myself to my lot. At last a loud knocking at the outer door roused me
from my seat. I started, and proceeded towards the grate; but the
gloom prevented me from distinguishing any object, though I had no
remaining doubt but that it was Paoli, who was come to witness the
completion of his dreadful purpose.</p>

<p>'Some hours passed in the utmost solicitude, till wearied Nature
could no longer resist the attacks of sleep. With what succeeded this
period,' resumed Laurette, 'you are already acquainted; but the
extent of my gratitude you cannot easily comprehend.'</p>

<p>The look, which accompanied the conclusion of the narrative, was
perhaps more expressive of her feelings than any thing she could have
uttered: and those bestowed upon her by Enrico displayed more of
compassion, affection, and tender concern, than the most forcible
language could have conveyed.</p>

<p>The spires of the convent were now discovered above the tops of
the trees, and the most pleasurable emotions succeeded. It was a
stately Gothic edifice, inclosing an extensive area. The walls, which
were at a considerable distance, were strengthened at the angles by
small square towers, which were partly in ruins; and these, together
with the whole of the out-works, though formed of the most ponderous
materials, were crumbling into dust, and were overrun with mosses,
lickens, and other weedy incrustations, which gave it rather the
appearance of a deserted than an inhabited mansion.</p>

<p>When the party had arrived at a large stone arch, leading into the
grounds, they alighted from the carriage; and having crossed the
lawn, were met by a Friar at the gate, who came forwards to receive
them. Of him the Conte della Croisse made an inquiry concerning the
Superior of the convent, and learned from him that the greatest part
of the building was inhabited by a society of Monks, who were also
Benedictines. This he considered was no unfavourable circumstance, as
Enrico and himself might easily gain admission into their order,
should their enterprize not be conducted with the facility they
desired: whilst Laurette might remain resident in the convent till
Madame Chamont had obtained permission to leave it, and could do it
without a breach of propriety.</p>

<p>Whilst the Conte continued in conversation with the Friar, the
tolling of a bell, proceeding from the chapel, which was situated
somewhat remote, fixed the attention of the travellers. Della Croisse
inquired the occasion of it, and was told that a Nun was going to be
professed.</p>

<p>'You will find some difficulty in gaining an introduction to the
Superior,' resumed the Monk, 'till the ceremony is performed. Would
it not be better to defer the execution of your intention till
afterwards; and in the meantime, by mixing with the multitude, you
may be gratified with a view of the solemnities. Some of the sisters
are already proceeding towards the chapel, and if you will grant me
permission, I will accompany you thither.'</p>

<p>From what the Monk had declared, it appeared probable that the
Abbess would not indulge them with an audience till the profession
was over; and after thanking him for his courtesy, they agreed to the
proposition.</p>

<p>The congregation was not at present assembled, and the Friar
having conducted them along the eastern aisle, placed them on a bench
of black marble, which was fixed near the altar, and then left them
to join a procession of Monks, who were commissioned to attend.</p>

<p>As soon as this religious had retired, the party contemplated,
with surprise, the magnificence and beauty of the chapel. It was
supported by pillars of Carara marble, of the most exquisite
workmanship. The niches of the walls were adorned with images of the
saints and martyrs, the performances of the most celebrated artists,
and taste and greatness of design were every where evident.</p>

<p>The organ was loftily situated in a gallery built for the purpose:
it was composed chiefly of ebony, and ornamented with curtains of
crimson velvet, which were curiously wrought with flowers of gold and
purple. The altar was decorated with a profusion of wax-tapers,
interspersed with vases, containing frankincense, and other costly
perfumes. The table was covered with an embroidered cloth, which was
worked by the ingenious hands of the vestals in the most chaste and
sacred devices. A large crucifix was erected in the centre, which was
supported on one side by an image of the Virgin, and on the other by
that of Saint Agatha. The altar-piece was the last supper, by Michael
Angelo, which was surrounded by a number of large
medallion-paintings, by the most admired artists, representing the
deaths and sufferings of the martyrs.</p>

<p>When they had paused for some minutes, to take a general survey of
these splendid decorations, they observed two of the Friars hastening
towards the aisle, to which they had been con-ducted on their
arrival. They were habited as Benedictines; but their garments being
made of coarser materials, bespoke inferiority of rank.</p>

<p>One of these religious spread a carpet, which he had brought for
the purpose, in the centre of the chapel, whilst the other laid a
pall at the steps of the altar. Soon after this preparation was over,
a multitude of spectators assembled, which curiosity, or some not
less active principle of their natures, had directed thither, who,
having placed themselves in the most eligible situations, awaited the
commencement of the sacred rites.</p>

<p>The funeral-bell, which had been for some time tolling, now
ceased, and the loud peals of the organ were heard in its stead. A
train of Monks, attended by their Superior, then advanced, who moved
slowly along the aisle; and the ceremony of the entrance, which was
not more striking than impressive, began. First came the novices,
strewing the floor with the most beautiful evergreens, preserved and
reared for the purpose; then the Lady of the convent, Iattended by
the Nuns, according to their order, with her mitre, and in robes of
state; and lastly, the fair devotee, who was come to take the sacred,
the indissoluble vow, which was to seal her inevitable doom. She was
conducted, or rather supported, by two of the sisterhood, who, with a
slow and solemn pace, led her towards the centre of the chapel, each
bearing a lighted taper in her hand. The music now ceased. A buz of
indistinct voices was heard for the moment, which gradually grew
fainter, and then died into silence. Our travellers, having eyed the
procession with a kind of painful curiosity, now left the place on
which they had been seated, and mingled with the throng. In vain did
Enrico endeavour to recognize the features of his mother; for the
veils of the novices were so artfully folded, that their faces were
entirely concealed.</p>

<p>As soon as the procession had reached the steps of the altar, the
Superior of the monastery addressed the devotee in an exhortation
replete with unaffected grace and eloquence, to which she gave the
most fixed and earnest attention. The easy dignity of his manners,
the deep pathos of his voice, and above all, the sublimity of his
doctrines, so affected his audience, that the whole congregation
listened to him with devout astonishment.</p>

<p>As soon as this was delivered, the sister, who was to take the
veil, advanced between two others of the Nuns, to make her
profession. Her voice was at first tremulous; but as she proceeded,
it naturally regained its powers; and having answered some questions
which were proposed by the priest, respecting the time of her
initiation, she knelt before him, and made her profession, which was
delivered with the most admirable articulation, and classical
elegance.</p>

<p>The prayers appointed for the occasion were then read, in which
the Abbess and the rest of the Nuns, as well as the Monks who
attended, joined with much fervency, and apparent devotion. As soon
as these were concluded, the officiating priest came forward, and
having laid the proper dress of the order upon a small marble table
erected on one side of the altar, began to assort them; whilst the
Lady Abbess took the noviciate veil from the fair devotee, and
prepared to enrobe her in black.--When this covering was removed, the
eyes of the spectators were withdrawn from the priest, and fixed with
a gaze of curiosity on the sister. It discovered a very lovely face,
full of the most interesting expression. It was pale, but it was
beautiful, and received lustre and character from a pair of dark blue
eyes, whose fringed lids shaded a complexion of the most dazzling
whiteness; whilst the extreme delicacy of her form was rendered
infinitely more attractive from being finely contrasted with the long
sable robe descending far beneath the feet, the garb, in which the
reformed Benedictine Nuns of the congregation of Mount Calvary are
clad.</p>

<p>As soon as the eternal veil was substituted in the room of the
noviciate one, and the broad belt and the rosary were adjusted, the
priest dipped the consecrated brush in the holy water, and, after
having repeatedly crossed himself, sprinkled the devotee, who being
then reconducted to that part of the chapel where the rest of the
sisterhood were assembled, remained for some time at her devotions.
Whilst this ceremony continued, the most solemn breathing strains
issued from the organ, which seemed to wrap the souls of all present
in a divine enthusiasm. These were succeeded by the choral voices of
the Monks, whose deep tones were softened and harmonized by the sweet
sound of female strains occasionally joining in and improving the
melody.--These rites being over, the professed arose from the place
in which she had been kneeling, to undergo that part of the solemnity
which appeared to the spectators more awfully impressive than the
rest. She was attended as before by two of the sisters, who having
led her into the centre, receded a few paces back, whilst she threw
herself, with a degree of collected earnestness, upon the carpet.
Thus humbled to the dust, she imprinted a kiss upon the earth, to
express her humility and lowliness of heart, as well as to signify
that she had now totally relinquished the pomps and vanities of the
world, to whose follies she was henceforth dead. The body of the fair
votarist was now covered with a pall, as if the spark of life, which
had animated it, was extinguished for ever; whilst the burial service
was chaunted to the notes of the organ, assisted by the vocal powers
of the Nuns, Priests, and Friars, whose wrapt souls seemed to be as
much elevated above the world, and its trifling concerns, as if they
had already shaken off the gross mould that inclosed them.</p>

<p>As soon as these lofty strains had ceased, the vestal was
reconducted to her place; and after some time spent in prayer, in
which she was devoutly joined by the Priests, Sisters, and whole
fraternity of Monks, the consecrated wafer was administered, and the
awful solemnities of the church in the rites of the Sacrament began.
The devotee having received it with an aspect of collected meekness
almost angelic, arose, and having kissed the robes of the officiating
Priest, she bowed herself, with inimitable grace, before the
crucifix, breathing at the same time a repetition of her vow. She
then embraced the rest of the sisterhood, and was conducted by them
to the Lady Abbess, who saluted her with a maternal smile, and
afterwards to the novices, who received her with the most cordial
affection; while a number of rose-lipped girls, fair and beautiful as
angels, who were resident for a convent education, strewed flowers
over them as they passed along to the last ceremony, that of the
coronation, emblematic of that crown of glory, which is promised as a
reward to those who, after suffering continual trials and
mortifications, are admitted into the regions of felicity.</p>

<p>When this was over, the bleeding cross of Mount Calvary was hung
in her bosom, whilst the chaunted hymn, which seemed to utter forth
celestial sounds, rose into deep and choral harmony. All present,
being wrapped in undivided attention, appeared to have forgotten that
they were among the inhabitants of that world, above which they felt
so strangely elevated. As the strains died into cadence, which seemed
to have proceeded from no mortal touch, the procession of Nuns and
Friars, attended by their Superiors, retired in the same order in
which they had entered; and our travellers, who during these
ceremonies had secluded themselves as much as possible among the
crowd of spectators, emerged from obscurity. As the novices, who
followed in the rear, moved slowly from the chapel, Enrico observed
them with peculiar attention, endeavouring to discover Madame
Chamont, but without success. Many were tall and graceful like her;
but there appeared so great a similarity, from being dressed exactly
the same, that one was scarcely to be distinguished from another.</p>

<p>Delay now became painful, and the whole party being anxious to
obtain some information relative to the best manner of proceeding,
walked rapidly from the chapel; and having reached the great gate
leading to the principal court belonging to the brotherhood, soon
beheld, to their satisfaction, the Friar who had given them
admittance on their arrival, standing with two of the Fathers of the
Benedictine order in the portico of the monastery.</p>

<p>The Conte instantly advanced to them, and after politely
interrogating them concerning their rules and institutions, repeated
his foriner inquiry respecting the Abbess. The Monk received him as
before with the most easy courtesy of manner; but on his requesting
to know if there would be any impropriety in desiring an immediate
audience with the Superior, was advised to defer it till she had
given her charge to the sisterhood--a ceremony never dispensed
with.</p>

<p>'If you have any thing important to learn from, or to disclose to
the Abbess,' resumed the Monk, 'your arrival this day may be termed
unfortunate; as when the solemnities of our church are over, the day
is uniformly dedicated to innocent festivity, in which the Superior
herself condescends to join. A feast is always prepared on this
occasion in the refectoire of the convent, at which she also
presides, and a number of Friars, particularly those of the
Benedictine fraternity, and pilgrims are admitted. No business of any
kind is allowed to be transacted this day, which is rendered not only
sacred, but glorious, from its having entitled a beautiful spirit to
that eternal reward, which will be conferred upon those, who, from
motives of piety, resign the follies and vanities of the world.'</p>

<p>'But if I only interpose in the cause of oppressed innocence,'
returned the Conte, 'and endeavour to steal some hours of sorrow from
the heart which has too long felt its influence; if my business is to
bestow comfort upon those, from whom it has been long withheld,
surely this cannot be called an intrusion upon the rites of their
festivity.'</p>

<p>'These arguments will have but little weight on the present
occasion, I fear,' replied the Monk, thoughtfully; 'and, perhaps, if
your request is forwarded with so little discretion, it may meet with
a refusal, or, if otherwise, not with that degree of attention which
it may merit. If you will take my advice, you will remain here
to-night. In this monastery the stranger and the pilgrim are always
received with hospitality; and, although the mode of life we have
embraced excludes us from what are generally esteemed the comforts of
life, we have at least the power of bestowing them upon others. And
as to the Lady,' continued the Friar, turning a look of inquiry
towards Laurette, 'I will introduce her to the convent, where she
will be allowed to remain till the morrow.'</p>

<p>Laurette courtesied meekly, and having thanked the Father for his
attention with that elegance of expression peculiar to herself,
awaited the result of the conference. Upon mature deliberation, the
plan, which was marked out for them by the Friar, was adhered to; and
the carriage being stationed at the outer gate, it was mutually
agreed, that the party should remove to some inn, or cottage, capable
of affording them accommodations till the evening, when they proposed
to accept the kind invitation of the Monk, who promised to introduce
them on their return to his Abbot, a man of exemplary goodness and
piety. Doomed a little longer to suffer the pangs of procrastinated
happiness, our travellers again entered the carriage, and soon
arrived at a small, but cleanly, hotel, in which comfortable
situation they obtained the rest and refreshment they required.</p>

<p>Laurette being much fatigued, at the joint request of Enrico and
the Conte della Croisse, consented to retire, and to endeavour, at
least, to obtain some repose; but the exquisite sensibility of her
nature prevented the approach of sleep; the idea of Madame Chamont,
and the scene she had just witnessed, which called forth all the
soft, as well as all the sublime emotions of her soul, pressed too
much upon her thoughts; and though she wished to steal into a
transient forgetfulness, that by salutary rest she might be better
enabled to meet, with becoming fortitude and composure, the tender
scene that awaited her, she found it could not be effected; and when
informed that the carriage was in readiness to convey them to the
convent, she arose without having once yielded to repose, and
prepared to obey the summons.</p>

<p>Having satisfied the master of the hotel, they drove from the
door, and arrived at the gate of the monastery just as vespers were
concluded.</p>

<p>The benevolent Friar, who had been some time in waiting to receive
his guests, advanced forwards to meet them, and having conducted them
into a lofty apartment adjoining the refectoire, introduced them to
the Abbot. By him they were welcomed with that superior kind of
courtesy, which is not always attached to the manners of the recluse;
offering them at the same time an asylum in his monastery till the
business which had directed them thither was accomplished; and also
to conduct Laurette to that part of the convent inhabited by the
Nuns, where, he assured her, she would meet with all due respect and
attention, which, he observed, alluding to her languid appearance,
seemed to be necessary. Laurette, who considered that if she
prolonged her stay at the monastery after what the holy Father had
said, she might be looked upon by the fraternity as an intruder,
after many acknowledgments of gratitude, consented to accompany him.
As they crossed the spacious area, which directed her so near to her
long-lost friend, all composure forsook her; and she looked round
with solicitude, in hopes of being able to distinguish her among a
party of novices, who, with their veils partly drawn aside, were
walking, as if in earnest conversation, along the winding paths of
the shrubberies.</p>

<p>As soon as she had gained admittance into the interior of the
cloister, a message was sent from the Abbot to the Superior,
requesting that she would take a female stranger under her protection
till the ensuing morning. An answer was immediately returned
expressive of the most hearty welcome, which was delivered by one of
the pensioners, who, attended by a Nun, came to conduct her into the
parlour of the convent.</p>

<p>Music, heard from a distant part of the edifice, convinced
Laurette that the festivities were not over; and being unwilling to
detain those who were constrained by situation to endure a life of
austerity and mortification from the means of occasional enjoyment,
she besought them to leave her alone; assuring the Nun, who was the
most assiduously attentive to her, that she should be enabled to
procure a sufficient degree of amusement from the novelty of the
objects.</p>

<p>As it had been previously determined, that the Conte della
Croisse, after having gained an audience with the Abbess, should
unfold his welcome intelligence to Madame Chamont with all imaginable
care and circumspection, Laurette resolved to conceal herself as much
as possible from the rest of the Nuns; and having failed in her
design of dismissing the sister, whose office it was more
particularly to attend upon strangers, she pleaded weariness and
indisposition, and requested to be conveyed to her apartment.</p>

<h3>Chapter 7</h3>

<pre>
Come, pensive Nun, devout and pure.
Sober, stedfast, and demure.
All in a robe of darkest grain.
Flowing with majestic rain.
And sable stole of cyprus lawn.
Over thy decent shoulders drawn;
Come, but keep thy wonted state.
Even step, and musing gait.
And looks commencing with the skies.
Thy wrapt soul sitting in thine eyes.

</pre>

<p>As soon as Laurette arose, she received an invitation from the
Abbess to attend her in the breakfast-parlour, which was delivered by
the Nun who had directed her to her chamber on the preceding night,
distinguished from the rest by the name of sister Monica. Having
returned this mark of politeness with her accustomed grace, she
followed her conductor down the principal staircase, and was ushered
into the presence of the Superior, who arose on her entrance, and,
with an air of dignified gentleness, offered her a place by the fire.
Laurette blushed deeply at the awkwardness of her situation, being
thus led into the presence of a stranger without any previous
introduction, who, she considered, might possibly form an opinion of
her by no means to her advantage.</p>

<p>Having accepted her offer with a degree of modest diffidence,
which rather augmented than detracted from the natural elegance of
her manners, she awaited, with mingled anxiety and impatience, the
arrival of the Conte della Croisse.</p>

<p>Her wishes were uot long protracted; for scarcely had they
partaken of the morning's refreshment, before the Conte, attended by
the Abbot, after a short message to signify their intention, entered
the room. Laurette being aware of the necessity of leaving them
alone, and observing that some of the Nuns, among whom was sister
Monica, were walking in a grove of acacia and mountain ash, that
overshadowed the edge of the lawn, which the window of the
convent-parlour commanded, gained the Abbess's permission to retire,
and hastened to join them, rather wishing for the moment to avoid
Madame Chamont than to meet with her, lest the sudden surprise might
be too powerful to be sustained with fortitude. It was a clear frosty
morning in the beginning of December; the air was excessively chill,
but the range of hills that almost encompassed the monastery, as well
as the high walls which bounded the gardens, sheltered its
inhabitants from those bleak and petrifying winds, which are so much
dreaded in mountainous countries. The party of Nuns seemed to regard
Laurette with a gaze of curiosity as she approached, frequently
turning to observe her as she moved pensively through the avenues;
whilst sister Monica, who was apparently solicitous to conciliate her
esteem by the gentle offices of courtesy, advanced forwards to meet
her, offering at the same time to show her all that was worthy of
notice in the gardens, as far as the austerity of her rules permitted
her.</p>

<p>Though secluded in this religious retirement from earliest youth,
this Nun understood and respected the laws of politeness; and though
there was much in the appearance of her new acquaintance to excite an
interest in her concerns, she forbore to infringe upon them by minute
interrogation. The rest of the Nuns having taken a contrary
direction, Laurette was left alone with sister Monica, who beguiled
the moments of suspense by leading her through the grounds allotted
to the vestals, which displayed through the neglected wildness of the
whole some vestiges of antique taste, perfectly in unison with the
whole of the structure, which, she was informed, had formerly
belonged to a suppressed society of a less modern institution than
that of the reformed Benedictine Nuns of the congregation of Mount
Calvary, which she learned, upon Inquiry, was newly founded by Madame
Antonia, of Orleans, Princess of France.</p>

<p>By this communicative Nun Laurette was made acquainted with many
anecdotes connected with the lives of several of the present
mhabitants of the cloister, to which she listened with eager
attention, being in momentary expectation of obtaining some
intelligence relative to her maternal friend; but on her sad story
the sister never touched, from which it appeared that she was either
totally unacquainted with it, or that some primary cause prevented
her from reverting to it. Though sister Monica possessed nothing of
that childish levitv, with which the manners of youth are sometimes
infected, there was a certain vivarnty of expression and a certain
correspondent look attending it, unobseured by the gloom of a
convent, which rendered her a very interesting and pleasing
companion; and Laurette, who, from the natural gentleness of
demeanour she displayed on a first introduction, had beheld her with
partiality, now experienced an increasing sentiment of affection in
her favour.</p>

<p>As they walked slowly through the gardens, Laurette could not
forbear expressing her surprise at the wildness and neglect which was
every where visible; at the same time remarking, that those places
consecrated to religion which had hitherto fallen under her
observation, had generally exhibited a very different appearance.</p>

<p>'This will easily be accounted for,' returned the Nun, 'when you
are informed that the Superior of this convent, though in other
respects almost unexceptionahie in every species of goodness, allows
her mind to be contaminated with one vice, whose baleful influence
deprives her of that respectful regard which would otherwise be paid
to her virtues; namely, that of an inordinate love of wealth. This
feverish and ever-growing desire has been productive of many serious
distresses, not only to those who are under her immediate protection,
but extending also to herself. It has occasioned her to exist in a
state of continual warfare between duty and inclination. She is
sensible of the danger of this augmenting attachment; but wants
firmness and zeal to subdue it. This foible, or this vice,' resumed
the sister, 'for it deserves no softer appellation, has not only
blunted the natural edge of her sensibility, which I have frequently
heard her declare was too acute to be endured, but it has weakened
her judgment, and by constant and guilty indulgence has checked the
active benevolence of her nature, which might otherwise have been
directed to the noblest purposes. But I am wandering widely from my
subject,' continued the Nun, sportively, 'and must endeavour to
return to it.' She then gave Laurette an accurate account of every
curiosity the gardens contained, which were numerous, and from the
antiquity of appearance which the whole of them discovered, might be
said to merit observation.</p>

<p>Having rambled over a considerable part of the grounds, a walk,
conducting them through several little picturesque windings, directed
them into what the Nun termed the wilderness, which, from its
disordered and uncultivated state, might be allowed to deserve the
name which the recluse had bestowed upon it. A path was, however, cut
among the trees; and several recesses, in which were placed seats of
wood, or wicker work, frequently presented themselves. Laurette, at
the desire of her friend, took possession of one of them, and was
informed by her that this little melancholy retreat was a favourite
resort with the greater part of the society, who were probably
walking towards the contrary end, or had seated themselves in one of
those little summer recesses which were made for their accommodation.
'Some of them I hear not far distant,' resumed sister Monica; 'speak
low, or they will overhear our conversation.'</p>

<p>She had no sooner made this remark than the sound of approaching
voices proved the truth of the assertion; and two Nuns, the one in
her noviciate state, and the other in her veiled one, moved slowly
beneath the thick plantation of firs that guarded the entrance, and
then advanced towards the arbour in which they were seated. Laurette
did not immediately perecive them, till her new acquaintance pulling
her gently by the sleeve, said, 'They are here. This nearest the
recess is she who was professed yesterday; and on the contrary side
is sister Juliana; they are inseparables; if we remain here a moment
we shall see them pass.'</p>

<p>She had scarcely ceased speaking before they came up close to the
arched tree under which Laurette and the sister Monica were seated.
As soon as they had arrived within a few steps of the bench, the
newly-professed Nun, after having given them a transient survey,
courtesied meekly, and passed on; whilst her companion, who was much
taller, moved pensively by her side with a mournful and dejected air,
without once lifting her eyes from the ground on which they appeared
to have been riveted. She had now, however, advanced many paces
before she turned, and raising her veil, that entirely covered her
features, discovered a face which Laurette imagined, from the cursory
survey she had obtained, was Madame Chamont's. But the hasty manner
in which the veil was replaced, and the obscurity of her own
situation did not allow her to be certain. Scarcely had she recovered
from the agitation this incident had occasioned, before one of the
pensioners advanced with a hurried step towards the sisters, and
addressing herself to the novice, informed her that she was wanted
immediately in the apartment of the Superior, where a person, whose
business was of merit, was in waiting to see her.</p>

<p>'To see me!' returned a voice, which Laurette instantly discovered
to be that of Madame Chamont, though it was rendered tremulous by
surprise; 'who can want me?' The pathetic energy of her articulation,
and the corrected sadness of her manners, as she turned towards the
messenger, pressed forcibly upon the heart of Laurette; and but for
the necessity of submitting her inclination to the dictates of
prudence, she would gladly have thrown herself into her arms, and
have acquainted her, without reserve, with the happiness that awaited
her.</p>

<p>As soon as the Nuns had retired from the wilderness, Laurette ve
ntured to inquire of sister Monica how long the novice, to whom the
message was delivered, had been resident in the convent; and was
informed somewhat above a year.</p>

<p>'Do you know any thing of her story?' rejoined Laurette.</p>

<p>'I am not in her confidence,' returned the sister; 'but this
circumstance, as it does not detract from her worth, does not lessen
her in my estimation, as she has doubtless some secret reason to
justify the strict silence as to her former life, family, and
connexions, which she has hitherto preserved; and, notwithstanding
this secrecy, she is more beloved than the rest of the sisterhood,
though though I do not imagine any of them, not even the Nun to whom
she is most attached, are better informed upon the subject than
myself.'</p>

<p>They had now passed through the wilderness, and were conducted by
a gentle descent into a little rocky recess, which appeared like a
natural cave. This perfectly coincided with the rest of the grounds;
for the entrance was so wild, that it was with difficulty they were
enabled to proceed. After some little exertion they, however,
accomplished their design; and entering this little romantic dell,
placed thernselvcs upon a stone seat, which was encrusted with moss,
whilst the number of weeds, and self-planted shrubs, that waved from
the brow of the arch, contributed to the correspondent gloom of its
appearance. Here they paused for some moments, listening, with
tender, yet melancholy sensation, to the murmur of a tinkling rill,
which was heard falling in gentle meanders among the channels of the
neighbouring hills. There was something in this soothing sound which
reminded Laurette of the past, of those days of juvenile delight,
which she had spent at the castle of Elfinbach, whose spacious domain
contained a wild and solitary spot riot unlike her present situation,
where she had often listened to the sad cadence of a waterfall in the
stillness of the evening. This brought to her recollection the
feelings connected with these memories, the numerous hopes, fears,
and anxieties that had oppressed and agitated her bosom, and the
gloomy hours of retrospection which she had afterwards suffered when
those days were remembered.</p>

<p>Wherever we have a kindred melody.</p>

<p>The scene recurs, and with it all its pleasures and its cares.</p>

<p>But the future, since she had now a generous protector who would
never forsake her, presented only visions of happiness; and at times
she found it as difficult to support that uniform calmness of mind,
which ever accompanies the greatness in the midst of expected
felicity, as to endure that appalling malignity with which fortune
had hitherto treated her.</p>

<p>As soon as they had retired from this lonely dell, they proceeded
through a vista towards the western lawn, which presented nothing
worthy of attention, except a large ancient cross, which was erected
in the centre. When arrived at the base of this sacred memento,
sister Monica numbered the beads upon her rosary, and then prostrated
herself before it; whilst Laurette, after bowing humbly as she
advanced towards it, paused for a few minutes to examine the figures
which were represented upon the pedestal, and the rudely-formed
characters, which age had long since obscured, and now nearly
obliterated. The steps, 'which holy knees had worn', were almost sunk
into the earth; the stones were fractured and discoloured, and
overgrown with several vegetable encrustations; and though preserved
by superstition from actual decay, were broken and deranged by
time.</p>

<p>Whilst Laurette stood musing upon the impossibility of saving even
these vestiges of holy record from the oblivious grasp of age, and
the meek Nun with bended knees was invoking the shades of the
departed, those long since mingled with the dust, to look down upon
her, and to assist her weak endeavours after piety; a novice,
unperecived till she had reached the side of Laurette, summoned her
into the apartment of the Superior. Though she had been for some time
in expectation of a similar address, a tremulous sensation took
possession of her frame, and sister Monica observing the sudden
change of her complexion, which from being more than usually pale,
was instantly suffused with blushes, and that shortness of
respiration proceeding from extreme solicitude, offered her arm,
which Laurette gladly accepted, as she advanced with a quick, unequal
pace towards the door leading to the cloisters. Having crossed these,
she stopped for a moment to recollect her spirlts, and heard, as
distinctly as joy and agitation would permit her to hear, the voice
of Madame Chamont, elevated into notes of transport. Impatience could
now no longer be restrained, and pushing open the door with a kind of
gentle violence, she soon found herself locked to the bosom of her
long-lost friend. Any attempt to do justice to the feelings of the
beautiful orphan, of Enrico, or even of the Conte della Croisse, who
had just witnessed a scene as tender, and if possible still more
touching, when he introduced to his amiable benefactress a son whom
she had mourned as dead, would be vain. Rapture broke forth into
tears, and it was brig before the charming Nun could believe the
happiness that awaited her was not visionary, before she could assure
herself that she was not still under the influence of some enchanting
dream, from which she feared to he awakened to a sense of former
distress. It was not immediately that Laurette was conscious that the
room contained any other inhabitant than Madame Chamont: even Enrico
was absent from her thoughts, and the tender glances which lie
frequently conveyed to her whilst he saw more than filial affection
expressed in the fine language of her eyes, were, perhaps, for the
first time since they had been bestowed upon her, unobserved or
disregarded.</p>

</pre>

<p>The Conte Della Croisse, when admitted into the convent, after a
formal introduction by the Abbot, was left alone with the Superior,
who received him with that stately kind or politeness which is
usually attached to the station she filled. As soon as he was seated,
he began to open the occasion of his visit, and fixing his eyes upon
her as he continued the subject, with the minute attention of a
physiognomist, he perceived that her countenance relaxed with no
symptom of pleasure when he mentioned the necessity of Madame
Chamont's quitting her retirement immediately, to assert the legality
of her claims, should any new difficulties arise to render her
presence indispensable. Having entered into a full explanation of the
subject as far as the nature of the case required, preserving at the
same time a scrupulous reserve as to those events in which she was
entirely uninterested, he requested an audience with his fair
benefactress, and politely demanded her dismission, since he had
already proved that all proceedings against her had been hitherto
illegal. As soon as the Abbess had recovered from her surprise, she
endeavoured to convince the Conte of the impossibility of yielding to
his desires unless the intricacies of the affair could be unravelled,
since she had nothing to depend upon but the bare assertion of a
stranger, which she considered as insufficient to prove the justice
of his claim. From the intelligence which the Conte had received from
Paoli in his dying moments, he knew that a considerable sum had been
paid into the hands of the Abbess on Madame Chamont's entrance into
the convent, which accounted in some measure for the many
insurmountable obstacles which were thrown in the way of her
departure.</p>

<p>Being perfectly aware of this, he took the most effectual method
of silencing her scruples, by convincing her that the sum, which was
consigned to her care for the benefit of the sisterhood, would never
be recalled; not forgetting to assure her, upon his honour, that he
would himself indemnify her from any loss she might sustain; and,
moreover; would venture to affirm, that if she would assist in
forwarding their design, Madame Chamont, when reinstated in her
rights, would richly compensate her for every proof of kindness and
attachment she had discovered, since she was unequalled in generosity
as well as every other mental perfection.</p>

<p>The Conte's arguments had the desired effect; and as the Abbess
listened with complacency to these eventual advantages, she became
gradually reconciled to the person by whom they were offered; yet, to
enhance the value of the obligation, and also to persuade her new
guest that she was not actuated by mercenary considerations, she
thought proper to propose a few more objections, which being
delivered with less energy than the former ones, were easily removed
by the Conte, who anxiously availed himself of every turn in his
favour.</p>

<p>After much courtesy of address on the part of Della Croisse, aided
by a little well-timed flattery, agreeably and delicately
administered, which the Abbess was too young to receive with
displeasure, the requested interview was granted; and the noble
Conte, whose generous heart overflowed with the most lively effusions
of gratitude, was permitted to prepare Madame Chamont for that scene
of delight she was shortly to experience, and afterwards to
contemplate the effect of joy, the most exquisite in the completion
of newly arisen hopes, when she clasped her long-lost son to her
maternal bosom! Such scenes of ecstatic bliss cannot he justly
delineated by the feeble hand that attempts to sketch them; nor can
the mind, which has not been disciplined in the harsh school of
adversity, form an adequate conception of them. A sudden alteration
in the manners of the Abbess, after Madame Chamont's introduction to
Enrico and Laurette, was evident to all. The apprehensions which her
avarice had excited being lulled to repose, there was room for the
exercise of those sympathetic virtues which Nature had implanted in
her mind; and now that her interest was no longer at war with her
inclination, she did not arm herself against their influence. Anxious
to remove any little prejudices which she considered might yet lurk
in the mind of the Conte, she paid the most marked attention to her
guests, giving Laurette an invitation with more than ordinary
kindness to remain in the convent till all preliminaries were settled
relative to their departure, not omitting to repeat her permission
for Madame Chamont to resign her protection when the nature of her
concerns rendered it necessary.</p>

<p>The Conte and Enrico now began to form plans as to the best method
of proceeding; and, after a second investigation of the subject,
determined to leave the ladies at the convent, whilst they went in
search of the priest by whom the marriage was solemnized, who they
learned upon inquiry had left his residence in Turin, and had entered
into an order of Franciscans not many leagues from Saltzburg. This
was a circumstance much in their favour, as it prevented them from
traversing a number of barren mountains and rocky precipices, which
would have considerably impeded their progress. To prove the truth of
Paoli's assertion, without taking this Friar as an evidence, whose
testimony would alone be sufficient for the execution of their
purpose, would, they knew, be impossible, even should they find the
Marehese more favourably disposed towards them than, from his former
conduct, they had reason to expect. To allow Madame Chamont and
Laurette to attend them on such an expedition, unless the Marchese
should intimate a desire to see them, would, they also considered, be
highly imprudent, since their reception might be far from a pleasant
one; though, by alarming the fears of the Marchese, it appeared
probable, since he was now entirely at their mercy, that he would be
glad to embrace any terms of reconciliation that would be offered
him, rather than suffer his crimes to be exposed.</p>

<p>As soon as they had informed the ladies of their newly-concerted
plan, they recommended them to the matronly protection of the
Superior; and, attended by Anselmo and two of the servants belonging
to the Conte della Croisse, commenced their journey.</p>

<p>As soon as Laurette was alone with Madame Chamont, she related
every interesting event that had befallen her since she last parted
from her; and requested, in return, that she would acquaint her with
every thing that had happened to her since she had been forced from
the castle, as this had long been a subject of painful surmise.</p>

<p>'You are already informed, my dear child,' replied the amiable
Madame Chamont, 'of the principal incidents of my eventful story: and
what I have to relate will, therefore, appear but like a repetition
of what has before been recited; yet, as you desire it, I will
indulge you with pleasure.</p>

<p>'You may possibly remember that, on the evening of my departure,
Paoli proposed, as soon as vespers were concluded, that I should
accompany him along the decayed side of the edifice, that he might
consult me respecting the repairs; and you may probably recollect
that I acceded rather reluctantly to the proposition, though at that
time I was incapable of ascertaining his intention, which was, after
conducting me to a remote part of the structure, to deliver me into
the hands of three ruffians, who, having covered me with a veil so
thick as to exclude every object from my view, placed me upon a mule,
and conveyed me, regardless of my cries, through the deepest recesses
of the woods, when, having arrived at a small inn, situated at the
extremity of the forest, we stopped without alighting for
refreslnnent. As soon as we had reached this place, one of the men,
whose aspect indicated him less ferocious than the rest, assured me
that I had nothing to fear, and promised, that if I would follow
striefly the rules he should prescribe, that he would engage to
conduct me to some place of security. This kindness, in a man of his
profession, filled me with astonishment; and though I could scarcely
believe him sincere, I ventured to assure him of my acquiescence.</p>

<p>'"You have then nothing to do," resumed the ruffian, "but to
remain silent. Any attempt to liberate yourself by your own exertion,
or any endeavour to interest the compassion of others, whom we may
accidentally meet with in our way, will render my scheme for your
preservation abortive. Appear resigned to whatever may be your
destiny, and leave the rest to me."</p>

<p>'His companions, who had remained a few moments behind to finish
their refreshment, now approached towards us, preventing by their
presence all further communication; but being somewhat re-assured by
these promises, my spirits gradually revived; and mindful of the
injunctions I had received, I preserved an uniform silence. We
travelled all the next day and the following one without obtaining
any rest, till, from fatigue and indisposition, I could scarcely
proceed. My companions frequently stopped upon the road to procure
some food, of which they always ofiered me a part; but never ventured
to alight, probably having some material reason for this
precaution.</p>

<p>'It was not till near midnight that, after two days' harassing
journey, we arrived at the place of destination, which was an ancient
dreary habitation secreted in a wood. The impenetrable veil that was
thrown over my face did not allow me to distinguish the road; but I
was no sooner sat down that it was removed, and I found myself in a
large grass-grown court, with three ill-looking men, whose persons I
had only partially seen.</p>

<p>'Scarcely had I obtained leisure to reflect upon my situation
before a loud hallo, given by one of my companions, brought to the
door of this melancholy abode a being, whose appearance had more in
it of savage ferocity than was expressed in the countenance of my
conductors. Terror and consternation now almost overcame me, and so
weakened was I for want of sustenance and rest, that, had I not
leaned against the trunk of a tree, I must have fallen.</p>

<p>"You have no farther to go at present," cried one of the men
roughly, "but if you will follow your host into the hall, he will
give you some supper; for since you have eat so little upon the road,
you must doubtless be in want of refreshment."</p>

<p>'Finding there was no alternative, I obeyed; and the men, having
fastened their mules to a tree, entered the room into which my
conductor had directed me. Obliged to submit to the necessity of
mixing with this horrid group, I endeavoured to reconcile myself to
my lot; but no soonerr had I partaken of a small portion of the bread
and milk, which was prepared by our host, than the indelicate jokes,
that were occasionally mingled with their loud peals of laughter,
determined me to abandon their society; and addressing myself to the
person of the house, whose name was Maschero, I desired to be
directed to my apartment.'</p>

<p>'Holy Maria!' exclaimed Laurette, in a tone of astonishment, was
you then at the Jansmer Holtz, the abode of the assassin? Could it be
the intention of the Marchese that you also should be sacrificed? If
so, tell me briefly, I beseech you, how your escape was
effected.'</p>

<p>'From what has since happened,' continued Madame Chamont, 'I have
no reason to suppose that the Marchese had any design upon my life;
but not to keep you longer in suspense. I will hasten to the
conclusion of my mournful narrative.</p>

<p>'I was then shewn into a large dreary-looking room, whose
appearance was sufficient to impress terror upon a mind not already
occupied by this dreadful sensation; but what more than any thing
alarmed my fears was the certainty of not having any means of
fastening the door. My conductor did not forget, however, to secure
it, with the assistance of a bolt, on the other side. 'As soon as I
was alone, a thousand melancholy conjectures passed along my mind;
and unable to compose myself to sleep, I paced the room for some time
in silent agony, frequently starting as the old boards shook beneath
my feet; and imagining I heard other steps beside my own, and saw
grim and ghastly figures gliding into remote corners. These
apprehensions were augmented by other noises, for which I could not
immediately account, but which struck me with more terror and dismay
than I am able to express. Deep groans were apparently uttered from
an upper apartment, and screams, which I was assured did not proceed
from the nocturnal revellers, whose voices, which I could yet
sometimes distinguish, broke upon the stillness that pervaded the
room: I did not, however, long suffer these imaginary terrors, which
were not less appalling than my real ones, being soon convinced that
the sounds I had heard were occasioned by a considerable number of
owls that inhabited the ruinous part of the building.</p>

<p>'I had not suffered more than an hour the forlornness of my
situation before the man, whose unexpected compassion had awakened my
gratitude, entered the apartment. I trembled as he approached; but my
fears were gradually dispersed when he assured me, that if I would
bestow upon him and his associates all the money and valuables I had
about me, they would not leave me to perish as was their original
design, but would convey me to a convent not far from the wood, where
I might easily obtain admission.</p>

<p>'"You were then employed for the basest of purposes," cried I,
astonished at his having made this avowal; "and you have agreed, no
doubt, for some considerable reward to take away my life, which, if
not more than ordinarily useful, has at least been innocent. Can you,
after such an acknowledgment, hope to obtain mercy?"</p>

<p>"The proposal I have made," interrupted the ruffian, "is at least
merciful; and if you refuse to accede to it, you are no longer an
object of compassion. But I have no leisure to parley, therefore be
swift. What is that gem upon your finger?" resumed the ruffian; "take
it off, and let me examine it."</p>

<p>'It was a ruby presented to me by my mother of considerable value,
and unable to bear the idea of parting with this little sacred
memento, I refused to yield to his wishes; at the same time
delivering my purse, which contained no inconsiderable sum. He
counted the ducats with a look of sullen dissatisfaction, and then
demanded, in a stern voice, if I was determined not to relinquish the
jewel. Afraid of irritating him by repeating my resolution, I
endeavoured to interest his pity, by informing him that it was the
gift of my last surviving parent, from whom I had been long
separated, and as; such was invaluable.</p>

<p>"If it is more precious to you than your life," replied the
ruffian, maliciously, "you may assuredly keep it; you are certainly
at liberty either to accept the couditions, or to reject them."</p>

<p>'Finding that nothing less than the ruby would bind him to my
interest, since the sum in the purse was insufficient for the
gratification of his avarice, I was compelled to yield to his
threats, though not without shedding many tears at the sad necessity
which obliged me to part with it. 'The light of the morning now
dawned dimly through the grate of my prison, and soon afterwards I
had the satisfaction of quitting my gloomy abode to pursue my
journey. Melancholy as was the prospect before me, it was less dreary
than on the preceding night, and a small portion of that hope, which
never totally abandons us, returned with all its cheering
accompaniments to my heart. When I arrived at the convent, the Abbess
left her room to receive me; but what was my astonishment when I
discovered from her conversation that I was an expected guest. It was
now easy to investigate the truth even through the obscurity which
veiled it. The men were employed by the Marchese, or rather by Paoli,
in obedience to the commands of his Lord, to convey me by stratagem
into this religious asylum; and the wretches, selected by the steward
for the purpose, taking advantage of my fears and ignorance of their
in-tentions contrived to rob me of the little property I
possessed.</p>

<p>'Scarcely was I settled in my new habitahon, when the arrival of
Paoli was announced, who came to makesome arrangements respecting my
board. He was closeted for some hours with the Superior; but the
result of this conversation was kept a profound secret.</p>

<p>'As soon, as he was gone I discovered, from the behaviour of the
Abbess, that she had been induced, through the insinuations of the
steward, to form an unfavourable opinion or me, as she never
addressed me with that maternal affection which characterized her
deportment towards the rest of the sisters; arid when her eyes
accidentally met mine, I observed they were usually turned from me
with an expression of contempt, and sometimes of horror, that
penetrated my heart. That Paoli had uttered much to my disadvantage,
to excuse the infamy of his proceedings, was evident; but of what
nature were the aspersions he had thrown upon my reputation, was not
easy to be discovered. Often did I half resolve to lay the ease
before the Abbess, as well to excite her compassion with a relation
of my misfortunes, as to absolve me from the crimes imputed to me by
my enemies. But an irresistible impulse withheld me for a time from
putting this fluctuating design into practice; and another unexpected
event relieved me from the indispensibility of again adopting a plan,
which, from the probability of being accused of adding dissimulation
to treachery, wore rather all unpromising aspect.</p>

<p>'One day, as I was sitting alone in my cell, a message was
delivered to me by one of the novices, desiring my attendance at the
grate. The surprise this incident excited almost overwhelmed me; hope
had so long sunk beneath the horizon of my prospects, that I believed
it impossible the morning of joy could ever more dawn upon them; a
faint sickness was communicated to my heart, and it was with
difficulty that I was enabled, even with the assistance of a Nun, to
reach the appointed place. It was late in the evening when I was
summoned to the grate; but the dusky hue of the twilight did not
prevent me from distinguishing that the person in waiting was Pali.
His figure was too strongly impressed upon my mind to allow me to
mistake it; arid knowing that a tongue like his could convey no
welcome intelligence, I surveyed him for a moment with a look of
silent abhorrence, but without uttering a word, till at length
disengaging something from his cloak, which I soon discovered to be a
letter, "I am come," cried he, with a malicious smile, "to bring you
news of your son; this paper will inform you of the whole"--I took it
with a trembling hand, and desiring the Nun, who accompanied me, to
elevate her lamp, opened it in haste. The first words which met my
eye were these:--</p>

<p>'Our son, having been called into actual service, has lately died
in consequence of a wound received at the battle of Prague; and your
adopted daughter, in obedience to the will of the Marchese de
Montferrat, her guardian and lawful protector, is contracted to a
young Venetian nobleman. Any future inquiry after these persons will
therefore be useless."--The paper now dropped from my hand, a dimness
came before my eyes, and I fell lifeless on the pavement. The cries
of the Nun who attended me, brought others to my assistance; and on
recovering I found myself on a bed in one of those apartments which
are allotted to the Superior, with two of the sisters, who were
seated by my side. One of these I soon perceived was sister Agnes,
the Nun who was professed the day of your arrival, and the only one
to whom I had singularly attached myself.</p>

<p>'It was long before my health was re-established, and probably it
would have been still longer, had not the Abbess, who soon learned
the cause of my sorrow, assisted, with the utmost kindness and
attention, in the recomposing of my spirits. During the first three
months of my captivity, the use of pens, paper, and every other
implement of writing, was denied me; and so strictly was I guarded,
that had I been inclined to attempt an escape, I should have found it
impracticable. But after this melancholy event I was treated with
more gentleness than before; and not feeling any desire to be
delivered from confinement, since every earthly tie was dissolved, I
endeavoured to conciliate the esteem of my associates; and being
entirely disengaged from all worldly concerns, resolved to dedicate
the rest of my days to the exercises of religion.'--</p>

<p>Here Madame Chamont concluded her recital; and scarcely had
Laurette expressed her sense of the obligation, before the Lady of
the convent entered the room. The conversation now turned upon more
general subjects till the bell rang for dinner; when the party,
retiring from the Abbess's parlour, joined the Nuns, who were
assembled in the refectoire.</p>

<p>The rest of the day was passed by our heroine and her earliest
friend in a state of tender thoughtfulness. The absence of Enrico and
the Conte, as well as the motive of it, now the raptures of the
meeting were over, threw a soft shade upon the spirits of Madame
Chamont. The interview, which was shortly to take place between them
and the Marchese, had something in it peculiarly touching. Her son
was gone to claim him as a father; her spotless reputation was
shortly to be cleared from those cruel aspersions with which it had
been tainted, and how these important matters were to be conducted
was a subject for continual reflection. Laurette did not consider it
so deeply; happiness was alone presented to her in the visions of her
fancy; the Marchese, she believed, would not only confess, but repent
of his crimes. What he had meditated against her was already
forgotten; and unsuspicious of the murder of her father, she knew of
little else that could be laid to his charge. To walk together
through the cloister in the ealin hour of twilight; to wander among
the massy pillars which supported its arched roof; to mark the holy
devices upon the dim gothic windows, was a charm the most congenial
to their feelings; and often did Madame Chamont and Laurette steal
away unobserved to enjoy that melancholy kind of pleasure, which
scenes of this kind never fail to excite in devout and susceptible
minds. With what pious sensations did they pace the burial-ground of
the convent, divided only from that appropriated to the Monks by a
terrace-walk bordered with cypresses! How many of the sisters, who,
after having lingered out a life of solitude and penitence in that
religious retirement, were now, they considered, numbered with the
dead! The second evening after the departure of the Conte and Enrico,
the chapel-door being left open after the evening prayers, they went,
attended by two of the sisters, to see an ancient stately monument,
which was erected to the memory of the convent's Foundress, who from
her exemplary conduct was reputed a Saint. It was composed of black
marble, and was situated on that side of the chapel which was nearest
the altar. It was almost encompassed with some others, which had
since been creeted to the memory of several of the former Abbesses,
which, though less splendid, were also ornamented with a number of
religious devices.</p>

<p>The privilege of being interred in the chapel was only granted to
the Superiors, the Nuns, whatever might be their rank, being always
buried without. Laurette could not forbear heaving a profound sigh
when she reflected upon the vanity of human distinctions and as she
returned slowly towards the cloister, she frequently turned to survey
the simple graves of the Nuns, which were covered with high grass,
and bordered with evergreens; it being one of the rules of the
institution that, after the profession of a vestal (an event which
had recently taken place) for the novices to replace the flowers and
shrubs used in the ceremony in the same baskets in which they were
originally gathered, and then to leave them at the foot of the altar
till the vigil is at an end: as soon as the festivities are over, the
train of Nuns proceed from the convent to the burial-ground, and
being met at the chapel-door by the novices bearing the baskets,
strew them upon the graves of their departed friends, chaunting at
the same time a requiem for the repose of their souls. This being
concluded, the vesper service is performed; after which the sisters
are allowed either to return to their cells, or to remain in the
gardens till the tolling of the second bell.</p>

<pre>
Better be with the dead.
Whom we, to gain our place, hate sent to peace.
Than on the torture of the mind to lie
In restless agony.
--SHAKESPEARE
</pre>

<p>Near a week had elapsed since the departure of Enrico and the
Conte before any news respecting the success of their embassy
arrived. During this painful interval Madame Chamont's mind became a
prey to causeless anxiety. Joy arid sorrow had so uniformly succeeded
each other in her past life, that she could scarcely forbear dreading
the future; for having enjoyed so lately the raptures of unexpected
felicity, experience had taught her, that, in the general course of
human events, she might probably suffer the reversc. Long schooled in
affliction, her disposition, though it remained unsoured by
disappointment, had lost much of its sanguineness; and she sometimes
doubted if, when at liberty to return to the world, whether she
should acquit herself to her satisfaction, whether her weakened
spirits could support that elevation of rank to which she must
shortly aspire, with the bustle of society, and all those
accompaniments of greatness, which in high life are so seldom
dispensed with. Respecting the interview between the Marchese and her
son, she indulged a variety of vague conjectures. It was their first
meeting; and what would be the result of such an event? Anxiety was
increased by reflection, and all the tender, the indescribable
sensations of the mother were called into action.</p>

<p>From this state of suspense she was, however, relieved by a letter
delivered by Anselmo, who, as soon as he had entered the gate,
inquired eagerly for Madame Chamont, arid was directed to the convent
parlour. Having received it with breathless anxiety, she retired to
her apartment, and finding it bore the signature of Enrico, unfolded
and perused it in haste. It contained only a few lines; but these
were sufficient to quiet her fears concerning the effect of their
journey.</p>

<p>'We have at present,' says Enrico, 'met with no material obstacles
to retard the success of our undertaking. The priest, who was the
principal object of our search, was easily found; and on a strict
investigation, we were mutually convinced that he also had been made
the dupe of designing villany, and was by no means accessary to the
plot, which appears to have been entirely conducted by Paoli.</p>

<p>'The Marchese has already entered into a full confession of his
crimes. He seemed, on our introduction, to endure much internal
affliction; for never did I behold remorse and acute anguish more
forcibly delineated than when his eyes met those of Della Croisse.
This self-condemning conduct induced us to proceed in the affair with
as much gentleness as possible, though we did not omit the necessary
information relative to the legality or his first marriage, and
Laurette's providential release from captivity and expected death!
This intelligence, as it served to assure him of her safety, seemed
to take an oppressive weight from his heart; though the starts of
agony, which frequently convulsed his frame when his distracted mind
reverted to his past crimes, were altogether more dreadful than the
imagination can conceive.</p>

<p>'But I am wandering from my original intention,' continues Enrico,
'which was only to state the policy or your leaving the convent
immediately. Anselmio, who is the bearer of this incoherent epistle,
will procure you a carriage from the Kaiser, which will convey your
charming companion and yourself to the castle of Elfinbach, our
present place of residence, and of late the abode of the Marchese:
perhaps it may be prudent to add, that it is his request also, who,
if we may judge by appearances, is anxious to obtain the forgiveness
of those he has injured. I need not entreat you to prepare for an
interview which may demand some exertion and fortitude, as I am
convinced your own superior understanding will instruct you in what
manner to act. I wish it was in my power to add, that the Marchese's
sincerity and repentance are likely to be proved by the purity of his
future conduct. But, alas I fear it will be otherwise; his
constitution seems to have yielded to intense sorrow, and much is to
be feared from its baleful influence. I mention this,' resumes
Enrico. 'for the purpose of hastening your departure from the
convent, as well as to acquaint you with what may happen. Let nothing
prevent you from commencing your journey immediately.'</p>

<p>When Madame Chamont had communicated the contents of this letter
to Laurette, she gave orders for Anselmo to make every requisite
arrangement; and being informed in about an hour that the carriage
was in readiness, she took an affectionate leave of the sisterhood,
and, attended by her fair charge, pursued her way towards the
castle.</p>

<p>After a few days' journey, in which no event happened worthy of
attention, they came within view of the mansion, whose rude, deserted
appearance brought to the recollection of Madame Chamont the ideas it
had first excited; and when they arrived at the great gate leading to
the outer court, her tears flowed fast and unrestrainedly, as her
memory reverted to the scenes she had wit--nessed since she last
quitted it.</p>

<p>The death-like silence, which seemed to prevail throughout the
castle as they advanced within a few paces of the portico, aided
these uneasy sensations; and already had they reached the door of the
great hall, which was thrown open for their reception, without having
met with any inmate of the mansion. At last one of the servants
belonging to the Marchese crossed the hall with a hurried step; and
on being accosted by Laurette, stopped to hear her commands. She
inquired for the Chevalier Chamont; and the servant having conducted
them into one of the apartments which they had formerly occupied, ran
to inform him of their arrival. They had not been many minutes in the
room before Enrico entered. His demeanour was mild, but dejected, and
his face, 'like to a title-page, foretold the nature of some tragic
volume'. Madame Chamont, who, from the hints dropped in the letter,
too well guessed the cause, after a fruitless attempt to recompose
her feelings, inquired tremulously if they had arrived too late?</p>

<p>'The Marchese is yet alive,' returned Enrico; 'but we must not
flatter ourselves with delusive hopes--he is evidently dying. To me
and to the Conte he has made a full confession of his enormities, and
may Heaven, in consideration of his sincere, though late repentance,
pardon his atrocious crimes! A Carthusian Priar, who has been with
him more than two hours at confession, is so shocked with what has
already been related, that he has twice left the room without giving
him absolution, though, as his decease is hourly expected, I hope he
will be wrought upon not to postpone it.'</p>

<p>Madame Chamont, who now found it necessary to resist the native
softness of her heart with all the fortitude she could command,
endeavoured to mitigate the keenness of her sensibility by the most
vigorous exertion; whilst Laurette attempted to support the sinking
spirits of her friend with an external appearance of firmness, the
effect of painful effort. Since it was impossible for them to be
introduced to the Marchese during his engagement with the Monk, the
party resorted to the saloon, where they were soon joined by the
Signora d'Orfo, whose unbounded joy on beholding Laurette could only
discover itself in tears. She would have made a thousand inquiries
concerning her mysterious departure, and the events that had taken
place since that memorable era, could she have sufficiently commanded
her voice; but surprise, for she had not been taught to expect her
arrival, and the settled melancholy that was depicted upon the
countenances of all present, prevented her interrogatories. After
about an hour spent in painful reflection, the Conte della Croisse,
with the permission of the Marchese, came to conduct Madame Chamont
and Laurette into the chamber. Night and solitude combined to assist
the pensiveness of their feelings, as they advanced with a slow,
unsteady pace through the long winding galleries which led into the
apartment; and as Della Croisse laid his hand upon the door to give
them admission, Madame Chamont's spirits so entirely forsook her,
that she was obliged to lean against one of the pillars of the
corridor for support. A look from Enrico at length inspired her with
new fortitude, who, taking a hand of each, led them to the side of
the bed on which the Marchese was laid.</p>

<p>As soon as he was conscious of their presence, which was not
immediately, a deep groan agitated his frame, and an expression of
guilt and horror was marked in his wildly-looking eyes, which
language can but feebly convey. 'Great Heaven!' thought Laurette, as
she surveyed, with mingled pity and astonishment, the emaciated form
before her, 'look down with compassion upon this afflicted being
suffering in the last hours of existence the agony of an awakened
conscience; and Oh soften the rigour of thy justice with the
effusions of mercy!'</p>

<p>Madame Chamont's grief was silent, but it was deep; she frequently
attempted to articulate, but could not; low sobs prevented her
utterance, whilst her soft eyes were directed eloquently towards
Heaven with a look that was almost angelic; yet, anxious to convince
the Marchese that she came to offer him her forgiveness, and also to
assure him that nothing of enmity lurked in her bosom, she extended
her hand to grasp his, breathing at the same time a prayer for the
repose of his soul. Charmed with the manner in which this favour was
bestowed, he pressed it fervently to his heart; his ghastly
countenance lost much of its dreadful wildness, whilst his hollow
eyes, which before glared with deep and inbred honor, gradually
softened till sorrow, deep and immoveable, was the only expression
that remained.</p>

<p>As Madame Cliamont and Laurette continijed to kneel, though
without addressing him, the Marchese gazed alternately upon each, but
was unable to speak. They, indeed, appeared like two ministering
angels come to offer consolation to a soul bowed down with the weight
of its own irremediable crinies. But the awful distance at which he
was thrown from them, sealed his lips in silence. Their countenances
were irradiated by innocence, whilst his was depressed by guilt; and
now that adversity had brought conviction to his heart, he
experienced the weakness, the imbecility of vice when opposed to the
innate dignity of virtue.</p>

<p>At length Madame Chamont broke silence, and in language the most
simple and pathetic, pronounced her forgiveness; dwelling likewise
with energy upon the promises of the Gospel in a stile so unassuming
and elegant, that her auditors listened with interest and emotion,
whilst the Marchese, at the same time that he found his whole
attention irresistibly attracted by the consoling truths she had
uttered, felt his hopes insensibly revive; and, after having received
the pardon of all present whom he had injured, he became gradually
more tranquil; though, when his eyes glanced upon Laurette, something
was evidently brought to his recollection, from the influence of
which he would gladly have escaped; and when he beheld the gentleness
of her demeanour, and saw the anxiety she discovered for his
happiness, he observed her with a kind of wrapt astonishment, as if
he scarcely believed that a being so injured could bestow compassion
upon its persecutor.</p>

<p>The interview was short, but affecting. The Marchese, as soon as
his sufferings would allow him command of language, addressed himself
to all present witli the most pathetic energy, expressing forcibly
the high sense he entertained of their unexampled goodness, who could
thus bestow pardon upon a wretch whose crimes had been productive of
such accumulated misery. Shortness of respiration, and sorrow at the
recollection of the past, prevented the Marchese from proceeding, and
being unable longer to support himself, he sunk back upon his pillow;
a cadaverous paleness overspread his face, whilst his quivering lips,
which were parched by the violence of his disease, appeared to be on
the eve of closing for ever. The scene now became insupportably
painful, and Enrico perceiving that his mother and Laurette were much
affected, would have conducted them from the room; but the Marchese
being aware of his design, gently recalled them, and fixing his dim
eyes alternately upon his son and Laurette, added, 'You have long
loved each other with an affection as pure as it has been lasting: I
only have been the means of rendering this attachment unfortunate;
and let me, as the only atonement I can offer for my past offences,
bestow you on each other.'</p>

<p>Laurette, not expecting such an address, bent her blushing cheek
towards the ground, whilst Enrico pressed her unresisting hand to his
breast, as he leaned over the bed with an air of melancholy attention
listening to the words of his father.</p>

<p>The Marchese paused for a moment, and then proceeded:</p>

<p>'Let him, whose crimes and weaknesses have clouded the days of
juvenile affection with premature sorrow, now sanction your future
happiness.</p>

<p>'Sanction did I say!' continued the Marchese, interrupting
himself; 'have I hitherto sanctioned any thing but vice; and is it
not virtue to disobey a wretch like me? But can you not, Laurette,
meek-suffering angel! as you contemplate the virtues of the son,
forget the vices of the father?--the fiend, who would have been thy
murderer, from having consented, after many struggles, to thy death,
as well as to-.' Here he stopped--his wandering eyes became fixed in
horror--his limbs shook--he struck his hand forcibly upon his
forehead, as if a pang had forced it there--and then, apparently
exhausted, sunk again upon the bed!</p>

<p>Enrico, finding that quiet and repose were necessary, conducted
the ladies from the room, whilst the Conte della Croisse remained
with the Marchese, who soon afterwards fell into a short slumber.</p>

<p>When they had descended the stairs, they were met by the
Confessor, who, with his cowl over his face, was moving thoughtfully
along on his way to the Marchese's chamber.</p>

<p>Enrico first observing the Father, addressed him for a few minutes
aside; whilst Laurette, hoping in this holy Friar to behold her early
instructor, the lather Benedicta, surveyed him attentively. The
subject he had entered upon, seeming to engage all his powers of
attention, prevented him from being conscious of the presence of any
other than the person to whom he was speaking, till accidentally
turning aside his cowl, she perceived, with amazement, the long pale
visage of her mysterious visitor. Her presence, in the moment he
beheld her, seemed to operate as powerfully upon his feelings; for
his cheek reddened, and his whole frame suffered a slight convulsion;
yet he remained silent, following her with his eyes till she had
reached the door of the saloon, where the Signora was in waiting to
receive her.</p>

<p>Had not the mind of Lairrette been entirely occupied by the scene
she had just witnessed, this singular incident would have excited her
curiosity, arid possibly she might have taken some pains to have
unravelled an affair which had long engaged her in deep reflection.
But compassion for the fate of the wretched Marchese, whose suffering
she had so recently contemplated, was so forcibly impressed upon her
memory, that the recollection of past events, as well as of past
wrongs, were entirely obliterated from her heart.</p>

<p>As soon as Enrico had ended his conversation with the Monk, he
entered the room, and endeavoured, with an assumed composure of
address, to bestow comfort and consolation on the rest of the party.
The night was passed by all in a state of tender dejection, each
retiring to their apartments with a persuasion that the Marchese
could not survive the following day, as he every hour betrayed new
symptoms of approaching death.</p>

<p>In the morning Enrico and Madame Chamont were summoned into the
Marchese's chamber as soon as they were risen; and Laurette, having
disengaged herself from the society of the Conte and the Signora
d'Orfo, felt an irresistible inclination to take a solitary walk
through the avenues, being willing to indulge the luxury of her
feelings amid the scenes of her earliest youth--scenes which memory
presented with more pathetic interest to her heart, when she compared
what had happened when resident there, with the long train of
adversities which had followed in the rear of her former
felicity.</p>

<p>No sooner had she crossed the lawn, on her way towards the vista,
than she observed the mysterious Monk moving slowly beneath the
leafless branches of a chesnut in the attitude ofdeep reflection. The
hints he had once given her on a subject of so much importance to her
happiness, as he had so positively affirmed; the portrait he had
delivered with such solemn injunctions, with the various
inconsistencies which had hitherto marked his conduct, now crowded
upon her mind; and since she had nothing to fear from the
persecutions of those who had formerly been her enemies, she
resolved, instead of avoiding him as before, to throw herself in his
way, that she might demand what motive had instigated him to such a
singular mode of proceeding.</p>

<p>This was no sooner determined on than she advanced with a
quickened step along the avenue through which the Father had passed
beheld him stationed at some distance apparently lost in thought.</p>

<p>The sound of her steps did not rouse him from his reverie till she
had arrived within a few paces of the tree under which he was
standing, when starting as from a dream, lie seemed to survey her
with astonishment and painful emotion, but without speaking.
Laurette's newly-acquired courage now forsook her, and anxious as she
was to have these mysteries unravelled, she was unable to address
him, and slightly courtesying, passed on in silence. She had not
proceeded many yards before a sigh, which seemed as if it would rend
in sunder the breast that heaved it, again recalled her attention.
She turned--it was the Monk, who, without moving from the place in
which she had left him, stood gazing upon her with a rapt and earnest
regard.</p>

<p>'He has certainly something to relate,' thought Laurette, 'which
materially concerns me, and why should I fear to know it? His conduct
has hitherto been inexplicable; but that by no means implies that it
is always to remain so; besides, he seems to be unhappy, and who
knows but I may have it in my power to comfort him?'--Thus released
from the dominion of fear, she returned again towards the Monk, who
observing her approach, threw his hood back upon his shoulders, and
advanced a few steps forwards; then, as if a sudden pang had seized
him, he stopped, fixed his tearful eyes upon the gniund, and again
drawing his cowl over his face, as if struggling to conceal an excess
of tenderness, turned round, and leaned upon his staff.</p>

<p>Compassion, as well as curiosity, now warmed the heart of
Laurette; and unable any longer to resist the amiable impulses of her
nature, she ventured to intnidc upon the sacredness of his sorrow by
asking him why he wept. Her words seemed to have the effect of
electricity, and so much of tenderness and pity was mingled with his
astonishment, that Laurette felt her bosom throb with new emotion;
and anxious, though fcarful, to enter upon a conversation whose
prelude appeared to have occasioned extreme distress, she at length
besought him to inform her who he was, and why he bent his eyes upon
her so piteously without unfolding the cause.</p>

<p>'Oh my daughter! my daughter!' cried the Monk, clasping her wildly
to his heart, 'Heaven, who alone is acquainted with my sufferings,
knows what I have endured; since, without a possibility of assisting
you, I have left you alone to contend with the adversities of your
fate.'</p>

<p>Amazed at a conduct she could by no means explain or excuse,
Laurette disengaged herself from his embrace, and being terrified at
the raptures he had betrayed, for which she could not account, was
irresolute whether to remain with him till her curiosity was
gratified, or to return to the castle; till the Monk, after having
wiped away the tears that had fallen plentifully upon his cheeks,
proceeded--</p>

<p>'Dear orphan of her whom I so early lost, caust thou forgive him
who ought to have defended thee from the shafts of misfortune for
having thus forsaken thee? And wilt thou, by listening patiently to
his recital, acquit him of premeditated wrong?'</p>

<p>'Alas! what mean you, holy Father?' replied Laurette, interrupting
him; 'how have you wronged me, and what claim have I upon your
protection who never knew you?'</p>

<p>'An undoubted claim,' replied the Monk, emphatically--'the claim
of a child upon a parent.'</p>

<p>'Upon a parent!' exclaimed Laurette. 'Oh Heavens! are you then my
father?'</p>

<p>'I am not thy father,' returned the Monk, mournfully; 'but, as
being the last surviving parent of thy beloved, yet unfortunate,
mother, am bound to thee by the most sacred ties. From a long
residence abroad I was supposed to be dead; and on my return from
imprisonment and exile, was marvellously directed to this place.'</p>

<p>Joy and astonishment now animated the features of Laurette. To
find a relation of her mother in the mysterious Monk was an
unexpected blessing; and the idea of having it in her power to soften
the remembrance of the past, to tranquillize the future, and to sooth
the infirmities of age with the sweet affections of her nature, was a
source of immeasurable delight; and she besought him to inform her of
those past events which he had described as replete with misery.</p>

<p>An advancing footstep, which proved to be Enrico's, put an end to
the interview; and the Monk, having given her his permission to
acquaint her friends with what he had unfolded, immediately on the
decease of the Marchese, she retired. As Enrico attended her along
the avenues, he perceived that her spirits had been much agitated;
but fearing to distress her by an inquiry into the cause, he only
rallied her gently on her love of solitude, and her secret confidence
with the Father, and then conducted her into the terrace-parlour.
Here she found Madame Chamont alone, and in tears; for her last
interview with the Marchese had much afflicted her: having witnessed
his repentance, she now lamented that death would so shortly prevent
him from proving the sincerity of it. He had delivered her a packet
with his dying hand, expressly commanding that it should be opened on
his decease, as it contained papers conveying particular orders
concerning the manner of his interment. This parcel he presented with
his blessing, conjuring her at the same time to forget the unhappy
wretch whose vices had proved so injurious to her repose, and to
endeavour to prolong her life to augment the happiness of her
children, who possessing the advantage of her precepts and example,
would reach the summit of virtue.</p>

<p>The day now passed silently towards the close. The physician, by
whom the Marchese was attended, having declared soon after their
arrival that his patient could not survive many days, they were in
momentary expectation of his death. The Monk, his Confessor, who had
hitherto denied him absolution, was called in towards evening to
administer the last Sacrament, and a few hours after midnight the
soul of the Marchese, after repeated struggles, took its flight into
the regions of eternity.</p>

<p>When this melancholy event was commumeated to the family, they
suffered for a time the severest distress; but knowing the necessity
of exertion, each assisted in consoling the othcr, till by repeated
endeavours they at length became reconciled and resigned, through the
not presumptive hope that his repentance, though late, would be
finally accepted.</p>

<h3>Chapter 10</h3>

<pre>
Now let the sacred organ blow
With solemn pause, and sounding slow;
Now let the voice due measures keep.
In strains that sigh, and words that weep.
--MALLET
</pre>

<p>A few days after the death or the Marchese, Madame Chamont, now
Marchesa de Montferrat, mindful of his last injunctiun, opened the
packet, so solemnly delivered, in the presence of the Conte, Enrico,
and Laurette, to examine the contents. It contained several papers
relative to the estates seized upon in the lifetime of their rightful
heir, the orphan daughter of the Conte della Caro, the testimony of
which was sufficient to prove the legality and justice of her claim,
and thereby to reinstate her in her immense possessions, should she
refuse to unite her fate with that of Enrico. Other papers were also
inclosed, which were penned by Father Paulo, the priest, who attended
for the purpose during the illness of the Marchese, in obedience to
the will of the Conte della Croisse, acknowledging Julie de Rubine,
long known by the name of Madame Chamont, to be the lawful wife of
the Marchese de Montferrat; and the youth, hitherto called the
Chevalier Chamont, to be his legitimate son and heir to the titles,
as well as the estates of his deceased father. Then followed the
will, which, after a properarrangement of the landed property, placed
Julie, hisacknowledged wife, in undoubted possession of all the
personal property, amounting to an astonishing sum, excepting only a
few legacies, which were to be paid at the expiration of a month; one
to the Conte della Croisse, the rest to a small number of broken
dependants, who had hitherto partaken of his bounty. The rest of the
writings contained some particular orders relative to his funeral,
which he requested might he conducted with as much privacy as
possible; and as he had no wish to be conveyed into Italy, for the
purpose of being entombed with his ancestors, he desired that his
bones might be laid quietly in the conventual church belonging to the
Carthusians; that no monument should be erected to perpetuate his
memory to futurity, but that every thing should be conducted with as
little ceremony as possible.</p>

<p>As soon as all these affairs were properly adjusted, the remains
of the Marchese were interred according to his desire in the church
of the convent of St Angelo, which was about a quarter of a league
from the castle. The new Marchesa, Enrico, Laurette, and the Conte
della Croisse, attended as mourners. The service for the occasion was
read by Father Benedicta, who delivered it in a stile so moving, that
the least affected of the audience could not refrain from tears. When
this ceremony was concluded, and the body consigned to the dust, a
sermon was presented from the centre of the church, replete with all
that simplicity and energy of expression which the solemnity of the
subject required, and ornamented with all those peculiar graces of
eloquence, for which the accomplished Monk was so deservedly eminent.
It spoke of the reward of the just, and the excellence of all
unpolluted conscience. The subject was of too affecting a nature to
be introduced without exciting emotion Laurette sobbed aloud, whilst
the widowed Marchesa drew her veil over her face to conceal her tears
from observation, as she leaned upon the arm of her son. The whole
congregation, which consisted chiefly of Friars and Lay-brothers
belonging to the monastery, and a number of the rustic inhabitants of
the adjacent villages, listened with undivided attention as the
Father proceeded, who dwelt upon the Divine promises concerning the
fate of departed penitents in a manner that seemed to diffuse peace
and comfort around. As he continued, the audience crowded still
nearer; a saint-like devotion was portrayed on every countenance, and
hope, which before had afforded only a pale and tremulous beam, now
burst forth with unclouded radiance. The path leading to eternal
happiness appeared no longer inaccessible; fear was succeeded by
confidence, and sorrow by resignation. This discourse was followed by
a deep and solemn strain attuned to the notes of the organ, which was
full, harmonious and sublime, such as was calculated to impress
deeply upon the mind the important truths which had been uttered.</p>

<p>This being over, the congregation dispersed, and the party
returned to the castle in a state of tender melancholy, not
altogether unpleasing, each disposed to reflection on the vanity of
human desires, and human attainments.</p>

<p>On the following day Laurette availed herself of the Monk's
permission, and acquainted her friends of what he had already
disclosed relative to his mysterious appearances, and with every
other event worthy of notice, displaying at the same time the picture
of her mother, the Contessa della Caro, which she had till this
period carefully concealed. However highly the fair orphan had been
estimated by her amiable preceptress previous to this recital, the
circumstance just mentioned, as it discovered that no threats or
afilictions, however terrible, possessed suflicient influence to
induce her to forfeit the promise thus sacredly delivered to the
Father, was a convincing proof that she had early united all the
winning delicacies of her sex with a certain dignity of mind not
usually connected with youth and inexperience: that her son had made
so excellent a choice was not the least of her comforts, and she
looked forwards to the consummation of their happiness with a great
degree of tranquil delight. Enrico's eyes beamed with every virtuous
sensation of which the human mind is susceptible as the Marchesa
dwelt upon her praises, and anticipated with impatience that hour
which would complete his felicity by bestowing upon him the charming
reward of his fidelity.</p>

<p>Father Benedicta did not long delay his visit of congratulation
and condolence, but came attended by the Monk, who had acknowledged
himself the near relation of Laurette, whom he introduced to the
Marchesa and the rest of the family by the name of Father Andrea.
From this Friar the pious Carthusian had heard of the many strange
occurrences which had lately taken place at the castle, and waited
anxiously till he could clasp his dear friend, the unfortunate Della
Croisse, to his breast without a breach of propriety. The meeting was
joyful, yet affecting; for busy memory recurred with melancholy
minuteness to the fatal incidents of their past lives, the follies
which had disgraced their earlier years, and thus planted thorns in
their future paths. So true is it, that the mind, though escaped from
the dominion of vice, dwells with pain upon the recollection of those
hours which have been dedicated to licentious pleasures.</p>

<p>In the edifying conversation of these devout Friars the family
spent much of their time, and gained from their religious, as well as
moral discourses, many solid advantages; Peace was soon established
among them, and comfort and joy, the reward of virtuous endurance,
came in her train. The Signora, whose affectionate attention to
Laurette, though she had been deprived through artifice of the power
of assisting her, was remembered with gratitude, and detained not as
a domestic, but a friend: and as soon as suitable arrangements were
made, agreeable to the will of the deceased, the Marchesa, whose
delicacy would not permit this truly-accomplished woman to consider
herself as a dependant, presented her with a very considerable sum as
a reward for her services to the Marchese, which she desired her to
receive not as a bounty but a debt, gently intimating that the
Marchese would have been aware of the justice of this measure, had
his mind been sufficiently collected to have considered it properly.
This piece of generosity was accepted as it merited, with unbounded
gratitude; and in such society as she now enjoyed, the Signora felt
that heaven had made her ample amends for all the former discomforts
of her lot.</p>

<p>Nor was Dorothee, the faithful servant of the Marchese, who had
been so injustly discarded, nor Margeritte, nor Lisette forgotten;
these had all taken refuge in obscure villages, which they gladly
quitted to be again received into the service of their long-lost and
much-lamented Lady. Blessed with an ample fortune, the Marchesa could
now indulge with impunity the diffusive generosity of her nature; and
it was with no common degree of delight that she beheld the same
virtuous principles which she had early instilled into the minds of
her pupils, now blossoming in maturity, bestowing upon their
possessors those undescribable sensations of happiness, which exalted
benevolence can alone experience.</p>

<p>After more than a month spent in the castle since the death of its
former inhabitant, it was deemed requisite for Enrico to be presented
at Court, that he might take possession of the Italian estates
annexed to the title those in Germany being the sole property of
Laurette, now Contessa della Caro, in right of her mother, the
daughter of a Bavarian Noble, an heiress of immense fortune. The
Conte della Croisse offered to attend him on this expedition, which,
in the present situation of affairs, could not be dispensed with, and
as soon as necessary anangements were made, leaving the ladies at the
castle till their return, they quitted this ancient mansion, and
commenced their journey towards Italy.</p>

<p>Father Andrea, who, in the person of Laurette, recalled the image
of her beloved mother, frequuently gazed upon her with tears; and so
much acute anguish did her memory cost him, that it was long before
he could trust himself again with the subject, or reply to Laurette's
anxious request to hear something of his story.</p>

<p>'We will waive it at present, my child,' was his customary answer.
'Perhaps a short time may enable me to be more explicit.'--This was
sufficient to repress the inquiries of our heroine, though not to
stifle her curiosity, who felt an ardent desire of being acquainted
with the destinies of her unknown parents. As Enrico wished her to
remain in ignorance of the murder of her father, he did not fail to
signify this to the Monk previous to his departure, who strictly
promised never to disclose it, since distress, unattended by any
advantage, would inevitably be the result of such a declaration. But
though averse to gratifying her desires immediately as to any
particular events that had befallen him, Father Andrea would
oftentimes accompany Laurette through the long galleries in the
castle, which were ornamented with the portraits of her family, and
inform her for whom they were designed. The painting in the oriel so
strikirigly resembled the miniature that she wore in her bosom, he
passed by in silence, but did not forget to explain the next which
was allegorical, and but for the apparent difference in the age,
strongly characterized the equestrian statue erected in the inner
court. This magnificent column, he informed her, was placed there in
honour of himself by his daughter, the late Contessa della Caro, who
having never heard from him since he had been engaged in a battle,
which had proved fatal to many, supposed him to have been dead; and
by means of an original portrait left at the castle, which was drawn
in the early part of his life, to gratify her filial affection had
ordered it to be copied agreeable to her own design, giving it,
instead of the wrinkles of age, the blooming graces of youth. From
this intelligence it was easy for Laurette to account for the
attitude of the figure which was the next in succession, since it was
evident, from the position of the picture, that it was designed to
represent the affectionate Contessa weeping over the tomb of her
lamented Father.</p>

<p>'How elegantly is sorrow expressed!' thought Laurette, not
allowing herself to introduce so delicate a subject. 'What
languor--what softness is in these eyes--how beautiful is the tear
that trembles beneath the lid!'</p>

<p>Could the fair orphan have known, whilst she was internally
bestowing praises upon the portrait, the near resemblance that it
bore to herself; had she been conscious that her form was still more
attractive than that on which she gazed, and that her features, if
not more exact and regular, were of a more bewitching kind; that her
eyes were not less brilliant, and the whole of her figure not less
lovely, she might have accused herself of vanity as she lavished
these deserved encomiums upon the insensible object of her
admiration. But she was the only person who remained ignorant of her
external perfections, though, had she known their extent, this
conviction would not have detracted from her worth, since she valued
not too highly these accidental advantages, either to be elated by
the possession of them, or depressed by the revense.</p>

<p>Laurette, having received her education in the castle of
Elfinbach, and spent, under the guidance of the present Marchesa,
some of the happiest hours of her life in this gloomy mansion,
retained for it an affection which she believed it impossible for her
to experience for any other residence, however evident its
superiority in point of beauty and accommodation. The shades, the
groves, and the mountains, had been familiar to her from childhood,
and a thousand tender memorials were connected with them all. Nor was
the Marchesa de Montferrat less attached to this dreary abode, though
a considerable part of it had fallen into ruins since she had quitted
it last; and but for its amazing extent, they would have found it
difficult to have discovered a sufficient number of rooms for the
accommodation of their household.</p>

<p>The rampart-wall had fallen entirely into fragments, and the
northern side of the structure was crumbling fast into dust; yet the
greatest part of the building, though not uninjured, was able to
resist the inclemencies of the weather; and the rooms which they
usually occupied, though they might have been presented to the
curious as models of antiquity, when animated by the blazing fire and
the social board, wore an appearance of more than modern comfort.</p>

<h3>Chapter 11</h3>

<pre>
Beauty alone is but of little worth;

Both shine alike, then they obtain a price.
And are a fit reward for gallant actions.
--YOUNG
</pre>

<p>When Enrico and the Conte had been absent some weeks, their return
was daily expected; and as it was determined that the family should
then remove to the mansion on the Saltzburg estate, till the castle
of Elfinbach was made fit for their residence, Laurette besought the
Monk, whose spirits were less oppressed than before, to perform his
long-neglected promise before she quitted the seat of her
ancestors.</p>

<p>'What relates merely to myself,' replied the Father, 'may be less
interesting than you imagine. A life which has chiefly been spent
amid the bustle of Courts and the clang of arms, though it may be
marked with some affecting incidents, does not usually form a
pleasing narrative: I shall therefore pass the greater part of it
over in silence. I have before informed you that your mother was a
native of Germany, and that my name was Ferdinand Baron Neuburg.</p>

<p>'It was in the reign Rodolph, the son of Maximilian the Second,
that I first entered into the service of my eountry, which at that
time suffered not only from internal commotion, but was involved in
wars with the Hungarians, and disturbed with the difference between
this Monarch and Mathias his brother, to whom he finally ceded
Hungary and Austria.</p>

<p>'Under the patronage of Rodolph, who regarded me with the most
flattering attention, I became skilled in every military art, and
received many enviable proofs of his attachment; but scarcely was I
enlisted among the number of his favourites before an unfortunate
affair deprived me of this flattering distinction. In the Empress's
train was a young orphan beauty, whose name was Augusta, of a noble
but reduced family, who had received her education under the sanction
of her Imperial Mistress, and was introduced at Court much earlier
than damsels of rank usually are. Any attempt to portray the extreme
loveliness of this fair young creature, would convey but an imperfect
idea of her charms, as it was not so much the graces of symmetry, or
the bloom of complexion, though in these she excelled in an eminent
degree, as it was a certain delicacy of sentiment and ingenuousness
of mind, discovering themselves in every movement and action which
diffused such universal enchantement.</p>

<p>'To see frequently the lovely Augusta, without feeling the
influence of her charms, would have justly exposed me to the
imputation of stoicism, particularly when I perceived that she
bestowed upon me a decided attention whenever I presumed to address
her, not less grateful to my affection than my vanity. As she was
always about the person of the Empress, who distinguished her with
peculiar marks of her favour, seldom a day passed at Court which was
not rendered interesting by the object of my admiration and I
observed, with no common share of delight, when compelled, under the
banners of the Duke of Bavaria, to lead a detachment of the Imperial
armies into Hungary, that there was a transporting melancholy in her
deportment, which seemed to intimate that she suffered the keenest
apprehensions for my safety.</p>

<p>'My absence from Vienna was not long; the rebel armies were soon
routed, and I returned once more to lay my laurels at the feet of my
Master.</p>

<p>"You are brave, Ferdinand," cried Rodolph, rising graciously to
receive me, "and I would fain think of something to bestow as a
reward for your valour, something adequate to your worth I know you
are not mercenary, and either I mistake, or you are not ambitious,
yet you would not disdain to receive a recompence from your
Sovereign. I would raise you to the rank of General, did not your
extreme youth stand in the way of your advancement; but this is a
difficulty which time will remove, and an honour that may be
conferred at some future period. If in the meantime I can serve you
in any other respect, you have only to mention your request; and if
it is within the bounds of possibility, it shall be granted."</p>

<p>'Deprived of the power of utterance by this unexpected generosity,
I could not for some moments express the warmth of my gratitude.
Rodolph perceived my emotions, and finding I had something to ask,
conjured me not longer to deprive him of the power of obliging me,
but to name my request.</p>

<p>'It was not immediately that I could form a reply; when I did, I
touched upon the subject nearest to my heart, and asked, as the
reward of my services, the hand of Augusta. Scarcely had I pronounced
her name before I observed art expression of uneasiness and
displeasure in his countenance which alarmed and perplexed me; and as
I continued to expatiate on the ardent affection I had long conceived
for this beautiful maid, he eyed me with a disordered air; and after
assuring me that this was a recompence not in his power to bestow
without the permission of the Empress, who would unwillingly part
with her, and that these were affairs in which he always considered
it prudent to remain neuter, he left me to all the chagrin and
mortification that grief and disappointment could inflict.</p>

<p>'As soon as I was awakened from my astonishment to a sense of my
hopeless situation, I naturally imagined that Rodolph was himself the
lover of Augusta; and this surmise was soon afterwards confirmed.</p>

<p>'It was in commemoration of a victory formerly gained by the
Emperor, Charles the Fifth, over the French King, Francis the First,
that a society of German Nobility assembled to partake of a sumptuous
banquet, given by the Duke of Bavaria in honour of this interesting
event. Being included among the number of patriots, I endeavoured, as
much as possible, to conceal the mortification I had lately
experienced under an aspect of assumed gaiety. The conversation,
though it was chiefly on the cabinet and the field, was lively and
unconstrained; unbounded hilarity universally prevailed, and, after
many attempts to obtain a temporary animation, r finally succeeded,
though my heart was still occupied by one favourite object-the image
of Augusta. As soon as the dinner was concluded, the wines sparkled
on the board, and the exhilarating draught went round. The name of
Rodolph was given--his praises echoed through the room. The flames of
my loyalty had been somewhat extinguished, yet I accorded with the
rest; I acknowledged him brave, noble, and warlike; I would have
added disinterested, but my heart contradicted the assertion.</p>

<p>'The Empress was then given; her virtues were applauded, and
encomiums, that would have enhanced the reputation of the immaculate
Portia, were bestowed, or rather lavished, upon her. Then followed
the Princes of the Blood, excepting only Mathias, whose disaffection
to his Sovereign justly excluded him from this honorary attention;
and then the Nobles in general, particularly those who had
distinguished themselves in the Senate or the Camp.</p>

<p>"We have hitherto confined our attention to the brave and the
virtuous," cried a young soldier, who was seated at the right-hand of
the Duke, because accidentally related to him. "Shall not beauty come
in for its share? has it not hitherto been offered as the reward of
military glory, and shall we not exalt its praise? Let us then,"
resumed he, filling high the sparkling goblet, "drink to the
matchless Augusta, the brightest gem of the Crown--the rose of
Vienna!"</p>

<p>'I raised the cup to my lips, but scarcely could I keep it from
falling; her name penetrated my soul, and brought with it a thousand
uneasy sensations. The mirth of the assembly now became boisterous;
the name of Augusta was frequently repeated, and it was easy to
discover that sire was universally considered as the favourite of the
Emperor. My distress now became too deep for conccalrnent, and
without offering any apology for my conduct, I quitted the company
abruptly, that I might converse with my own soul in secret, and
reconcile myself, if possible, to my disappointment.</p>

<p>'In vain did I endeavour to combat my affection, or to convince
myself that she merited the oblique aspersions that had been thrown
upon her character; her modesty, her unexampled beauty, the dignity
of her demeanour, the retiring delicacy of her manners--all pleaded
eloquently her cause, and seemed to reproach me for having even
listened to a conversation tending to deprive them of their
influence.</p>

<p>'A few days after this event I was summoned into the presence of
the Emperor, who received me with an affected satisfaction, which
displeased me, because I easily discovered that it was not genuine.
After having accosted me with his accustomed familiarity, he praised
my former exploits, and concluded with making known his intention of
sending me on another expedition into the precincts of Hungary. The
coldness with which I received this proposal, for I was a stranger to
the arts of dissimulation, offended him; but he cautiously avoided a
verbal confession of his displeasure, still endeavouring to conceal
it under an appearance of cordiality. He saw he had injured himself
in my esteem, and considered that from the intestine divisions of his
country, for many had secretly espoused the causc of Mathias, it
would be a politic measure to regain it. Easily penetrating his
design, I shrunk from the meanness of it with contempt; yet the
strength of my local attachment determined me to defend my country,
though I now no longer regarded with partiality the man who was
reputed its father.</p>

<p>'Having acceded to his desires, I once more quitted Austria, but
not till I had first accomplished an interview with my Augusta, by
means of a confidential dependant. This was with difliculty effected,
as native modesty for some time prevented her from according with my
desires; but affection finally triumphed, and in accents which are
indelibly impressed upon my memory, she acknowledged herself
concerned in my welfare. Still, however, I was dissatisfied and
restless; what I had heard at the banquet, with what had fallen under
my immediate observation, gave room for conjecture; yet scarcely
could I summon resolution enough to make it known. To hint my
suspicions, to throw a shade upon her conduct which, if spotless,
must so tenderly wound a heart incapable of depravity, would, I
considered, be raising an insurmountable bar to my hopes. Yet to
remain in a state of suspense, to endure the idea that her affections
were devoted to another, to feel the possibility of doubting whether
they were my own, was a reflection that brought with it the most
acute anguish; and at length I resolved to free myself from these
inquietudes by a disclosure of my halfindulged surmises.</p>

<p>'The result of this conference placed her worth and honour beyond
a doubt, and occasioned me to depart with a full determination of
returning as soon as possible to Vienna, and of renewing my suit.
Released from these visionary distresses, I commenced my military
tour. Success crowned our endeavours--the enemy retreated as far as
Buda--the General of the Hungarian forces, after a severe and sudden
attack, laid down his arms--victory seemed on all sides to decide for
us--and, every way fortunate, we returned to the metropolis loaded
with spoils and honours.</p>

<p>"Surely," cried I, "Rodolph will no longer refuse to bestow upon
me the lovely Augusta. If my former deeds in arms have not entitled
me to so rich a reward after this change in his favour, he will no
longer slight my services but will confer upon me this mestimable
maid, the only return I shall require, or deign to receive."</p>

<p>'Full of these warm, these sanguine hopes, whose only tendency is
to mislead the judgment, I arrived at Vienna, and took the first
opportunity of throwing myself before the throne of Rodolph, whose
arms were open to receive me. But before I had time fully to acquaint
him with the extent of my good fortune, or to repeat my request, I
perceived a fixed expression of melancholy in his countenance, so
nearly connected with despair, that my heart glowed with every
sentiment of compassion. He observed it, and endeavoured to force a
smile upon his features, as he congratulated me on the success of my
undertaking; but it was a smile that had more in it of internal
sadness than of tranquillity. Finding that he listened to me with a
divided attention, and being unwilling to probe the wound he seemed
recently to have received, I left him with an intention of seizing a
more favourable moment of winning him to my interest. Scarcely had I
removed from his presence before Count Wallestein, a courtier in the
train of the Empress, crossed my path. I inquired of him the cause of
this universal silence which seemed to reign throughout the Court;
and was informed, to my unspeakable grief and astonishment, that my
Augusta was no more; that she had been attacked with a severe
disorder soon after I left Austria, which in a few days proved fatal!
The anguish I endured at this moment can be scarcely conceived; the
Count saw it, and offered something which he meant for consolation,
at the same time convincing me by his manner, rather than his words,
that he had been acquainted with the attachment subsisting between me
and Augusta.</p>

<p>'This unexpected calamity occasioned me to consign myself to
solitude for the space of some weeks, during which time I allowed no
one to intrude upon the rights of my sorrow, chusing rather to
reconcile myself to my misfortunes iii the solitude of my closet,
than to attempt to procure consolation amid scenes of dissipation.
Peace being soon afterwards proclaimed, I now felt disengaged from
all earthly pursuits; and, after much consideration, determined to
bid my adieu to my Sovereign, and to retire into one of those castles
occupied by my ancestors in the Dutchy of Bavaria. This resolution
was at first strenuously opposed by Rodolph, who held forth the most
alluring promises to divert me from a project by no means favourable
to his interests: hut finding I was not to be wrought upon by the
sophistical arguments made use of in his defence, he left me to
pursue my own inclinations with many marks of displeasure, without
even hinting any thing as to a reward for my former services. I had
already made every necessary arrangemerit for my intended expedition,
and was preparing to bid a long adieu to those scenes of illusion,
which, from the prejudices of education, and the force of habit, had
long occupied my thoughts, and was ruminating in silence on the new
plan of life I was going speedily to adopt, when my reflections were
disturbed by Count Wallestein, who having been long a concerned
spectator of what was passing in my heart, besought me, instead of
prosecuting my former intentions, to accompany him on a little rural
excursion through Switzerland and Savoy.</p>

<p>"I know the nature of your feelings too well," resumed the Count,
"to propose, what is usually recommended as a restorative to a
wounded mind, scenes of levity and dissipation. These generally fail
in their effect, and if otherwise, the remedy is too frequently a
dangerous one; yet, though I mean to discountenance this method of
subduing the pang of severe distress, I by no means approve the mode
of conduct you have recently, and I may add, too hastily adopted. You
are at present too young to bury yourself in total inaction; the
duties of your station require exertion, and he who believes he can
discharge them in solitude, suffers his judgment to be deluded. Much
may be done, I acknowledge, in the narrow sphere of domestic
arrangements; sorrow may be made to smile, and poverty to feel the
diffusive power of benevolence. Virtue and content are said to
inhabit the path of rural seclusion, and, like the wild flowers that
decorate the forest, thrive best, amid the unfrequented shades of
Nature; yet in situations like these, our sphere of action is too
much contracted to lead to any high attainment in virtue. It is in
society only that our power is equal to our inclination; and trust
me, the blessings it bestows make ample amends for those little
wayward accidents in human life, which will occasionally happen to
the most fortunate however ardently they may endeavour to escape from
them. Let me then," resumed the Count, "prevail upon you to renounce
a plan which secludes you from the participation of pleasure, without
retaining power sufficient to indemnify you from partaking of that
joyless portion of bitter disappointment, which inevitably lingers in
the cup of human life."</p>

<p>'These and other arguments, seducingly delivered, at last
prevailed upon me to accede to the proposal, though I secretly
resolved, on my return from this rural expedition, to quit Vienna,
and to repair, at least for some time, to the seat of my ancestors. A
few days after this event we commenced our journey towards
Switzerland, meaning to perform it by easy stages, that we might
occasionally loiter amongst the most picturesque scenes of this
romantic country. It was now the beginning of June, and the heat not
sufficiently intense considerably to retard our progress. Every
object that presented itself was enrobed in that sublime simplicity
which characterizes these charming regions, whose imagery is at once
lofty and impressive, lilling the mind that contemplates it with the
most exquisite emotions. Having coasted the Alps, whose snow-capped
summits were half obscured in the clouds, viewing from these lofty
eminences every unadorned beauty which the most glowing imagination
could portray, we arrived at a beautiful village beneath the Alpine
steep of a precipice, near St Julian in Savoy, whose prospect was
bounded by a fine range of hills retiring into remote distance,
which, being covered on one side with fine woods and vineyards,
formed a striking contrast with the naked sublimity of the
uncultivated side, deformed, or rather aggrandized by huge masses of
frowning rock, rising in the most romantic directions.</p>

<p>'We did not reach this village till near an hour after sun-set for
as we proceeded leisurely along the glen on our way thither, we
frequently paused to survey the rich vermeil hue left upon Mount
Blanc, long after the sun had receded from the horizon, which fired
the whole western hemisphere with the most glowing tints, till the
blue mist of the twilight stole meekly upon the scene, and the moon
sailing silently towards her destination, commenced her reign of
tranquillity. Fatigued with traversing these immense mountains, which
it was impossible to avoid, I proposed taking our nightly rest at a
small inn, situated about a quarter of a league from the village,
which, however, appeared to be near; but the Count objected to the
proposition, assuring me that the village was an object of too much
importance to be neglected, since it possessed more natural beauty
than many others which had attracted our attention; and as we were
now at such an inconsiderable distance, he must insist upon our
reaching it that night, intimating a desire that, for the sake of
variety, we should leave our carriage and mules at the inn, and
descend gradually the mountain till we had gained the object of our
ramble. Feeling no inclination to contend with him in a matter of so
little importance, I acquiesced; and having disposed of our mules and
attendants agreeably to his desire, we advanced towards the hamlet,
which consisted of a number of small white cottages, remarkable for
their neatness and beauty, almost surrounded with mountains. In this
sylvan spot the simple children of Nature, whose habitations were
enclosed by these almost inaccessible barriers, seemed to repose in
uninterrupted quiet, and to be equally removed from the cares and
distresses of life. The song of the herdsman, the bleat of the lamb,
or the carol of the hasty-footed passenger, tended to wrap the mind
in that pleasing kind of melancholy, which rural sounds and rural
objects never fail to inspire, when the heart is sufficiently at ease
to be susceptible of these amiable impressions.</p>

<p>'Having examined all that had hitherto fallen within the sphere of
our observation, we proceeded, by a little winding path, along a
gentle descent, till we reached a cottage so peculiarly beautiful,
that our senses were for some time absorbed in admiration. It was
small, and of exact proportion; and so much taste was displayed in
the grounds which inclosed it, that it appeared like the retreat of
some sylvan deity, who had exhausted all the beauties of nature to
harmonize her favourite residence. A little lawn led to the door,
which was ornamented with several fltnciful shrubberies, intermingled
with a variety of those many-coloured flowers, wilieli enamel, and
perfume with their odours, the flinty bosom of Savoy. A wood wound
along its side, through which a stream, that had spent its fury among
the rocks, was dimly and but at intervals seen through the
deep-foliated branches that hung over it, whose sound died away in a
gentle murmur, as it retreated from this beautiful dwelling to form a
lake in front of the village.</p>

<p>'As we drew nearer to the cottage, a strain of music, so soft, so
sweet, that it seemed to proceed from no mortal touch, came faintly
to our ears in the silence of the night. It appeared to possess the
powers of enchantment, for we were unable either to return or to
proceed. Whilst we still listened, it paused, and then, accompanied
by a voice which was melody itself, struck into another measure. The
Count eyed me with a look of secret triumph, and then desired me to
follow him. I obeyed in silence till we arrived within a few steps of
the door, when I demanded in what manner he intended to introduce
himself to the fair syren who had thus riveted our attention.</p>

<p>"Your curiosity will soon be gratified," returned the Count, with
a smile, which was attended by a look I did not comprehend. "You have
nothing to do but to follow my steps, and be assured the adventure
will terminate to your satisfaction." While he yet spoke, the voice
ceased, the music sunk into cadence, and low sobs, broken, but
distinct, were heard in its stead.</p>

<p>"What can this mean?" cried I, interrupting him. "Can sorrow have
found an asylum in this sweet abode? If so, where call we look for
tranquillity?" The Count, without vouchsafing a reply, advanced
towards the window from whence the music was heard, and encouraged by
his example, I followed slowly along. The casement was thrown open to
admit the cool breeze of the evening; but a shade of fine
lattice-work, which was over-canopied with the clematis integrifolia,
eglantine, and a number of variegated evergreens, concealed the
inhabitants of this beautiful little cottage from the gaze of the
passenger. Whilst we yet paused to observe the tasteful simplicity of
its aspect, a rough breeze wafted aside the foliated covering, and
discovered a female, clad in a white robe, bending gracefully over a
harp. Her fine flaxen locks, which descended to her waist in the most
luxuriant tresses, were simply confined with a ribbon passing over
her forehead, and fastened, without the appearance of art, in a loose
and airy manner. A thin veil, of the slightest texture, covered her
face, to which imagination now gave all those charms of expression,
all that softness of eolour which glow in the mind of the painter,
the poet, and the lover. In a few moments she arose, replaced the
harp by her side, and then heaving a gentle sigh, advanced towards
the window.</p>

<p>'Ashamed of being seen thus watching her movements, as the breath
of the zephyr allowed me partially to observe her, I receded some
paces back; but before I could conceal myself behind the interwoven
branches of the clematis, she drew up the lattice-work with an
intention of closing the casement, and gave us a full view of her
person. Her veil was yet over her face; but as the Count approached
nearer to the window she uttered an exclamation of surprise, and
threw it back upon her shoulders. I caught the tones of her voice;
but scarcely could I convince myself that I was still in existence,
when, raising my eyes from the ground, I beheld in the beautiful
recluse my beloved Augusta. To convey a just idea of my feelings at
this moment would be impossible; I shall therefore pass them over in
silence, observing only that she received me with those speaking
tears, and blushing smiles, which convey more eloquently than words
the genuine force of affection.</p>

<p>'As soon as I was a little composed, I desired the Count would
explain this eventful mystery, since it was evident that to lead me
to this spot was a preconcerted scheme, and that he was acquainted
with the strange circumstance which had given rise to the report of
her death.</p>

<p>"You are right, my dear Ferdinand," returned the Count, whose fine
countenance was irradiated with a smile of benevolence; "I have been
the chief performer in this little drama, and if you will give me a
patient hearing, I will instantly explain my motive for having thus
led you from joy to grief, and from grief to happiness. You are not
ignorant of the passion that Rodolph cherished for Augusta, which he,
however, long concealed from her; but this unfortunate prepossession
increasing with her beauty, he was led, by slow progressive measures,
to the attempt of conciliating her affections, which he had some
hopes of effecting. Your attachment to his favourite, and the
benignant glances which she sometimes cast upon you, gave him more
serious uneasiness than he had ever before experienced. This accounts
for a behaviour which before this discovery was uniformly different,
and for the manner in which he precipitated your departure into
Hungary.</p>

<p>"No sooner had you left the Court of Vienna than the Empress
observed his emotions in the presence of Augusta, and instantly
guessed the cause. In this affair she displayed less of that exalted
magnanimity of conduct than she had formerly discovered on every
other occasion. Her affection for Augusta was transformed into the
most deadly hate, which instigated her not only to withdraw her
protection, but to inflict some punishment as severe as undeserved.
Hitherto I had been honoured with her confidence in affairs of equal
importance; and fearing, lest the violence of her passions should
plunge her into some unexampled error, I called a little
dissimulation to my aid, and entering warmly into her feelings,
promised to assist her design. Fortunately at this crisis Augusta was
so much indisposed as to be obliged to remain in her apartment. This
was favourable to my purpose; and during her confinement I prevailed
upon the Empress to allow me to spread a report of her death, and
also to permit me to convey her into a convent, which would
effectually prevent her from being either seen or heard of more.
Having undertaken the management of this affair, I contrived to
inform this fair victim of unjust resentment of these newly-concerted
measures; at the same time assuring her, that if she would assist my
enterprise, by wearing an appearance of joy in the presence of the
Empress at being allowed to end her days in a religious retirement,
instead of devoting her to a conventual life, I would only remove her
for a short time to a little romantic retreat in a remote province
till I had acquainted you with her situation, who, I was convinced,
would gladly liberate her from solitude. Since to leave the Court had
been for some weeks the primary wish of her soul, she gladly
consented to the proposal, and was immediately conveyed hither. In
the meantime the report of her death was circulated so successfully
by the Empress and her confidential dependants, who had bound
themselves by oath to an eternal silence upon the subject, in
consideration of a great reward, that none entertained any doubt of
its reality. A coffin, attended by all the ladies of the Court, who
knew not but that it contained the body of their companion, was
interred with all the rites of burial; and so artfully was every
thing conducted, that the Emperor, the Nobles, and the whole Court,
were completely deceived.</p>

<p>"As then, you must allow," resumed the Count, "that I have acted
the part of a friend, you will pardon me for having permitted you to
taste of calamity, since without the bitter ingredients of life, the
sweets would be deprived of their relish; and as you will have the
justice to allow that the few weeks of separation, which were
necessary for the furthering of our scheme, have been more than
counter-balanced by the joys of meeting, you have now nothing to do,"
continued the Count, directing a playful smile at the blushing
Augusta, "but to obtain the hand of this fair wood nymph, who, if I
have any skill in physiognomy, bestowed her heart upon you almost
before she knew she had one. A priest may easily be procured, by whom
the ceremony may be performed, and your own prudence, as to secrecy,
will instruct you how to act.--"</p>

<p>'The path being thus cleared, half the difficulties were removed;
and having renewed my suit with all the ardency of the sincerest
affection, she soon consented to bestow upon me the happiness I
sought; and a priest being engaged, I was soon permitted to address
her by the endearing appellation of wife.'--The Monk now paused for a
moment, to give a tear to the recollection of his former happiness,
and then proceeded--</p>

<p>'As soon as the marriage was solemnized, we repaired, attended by
the Count Wallestein, to this castle, in which I spent many years in
uninterrupted felicity. Heaven blessed us with a daughter soon after
our marriage, and the important secret remaining still undiscovered,
I removed occasionally to Court during the reign of Rodolph; but my
absences from the castle were never long, serving only to augment the
happiness I enjoyed in the society of my wife and daughter. At last,
however, it pleased Heaven to deprive me of my much-loved partner,
though not till she had seen her daughter eligibly and happily united
to the Conte della Caro, an Italian Nobleman, who accidentally saw
her as he was making the tour of Europe, and who, on my consent to
their marriage, promised to allow his bride to spend half the year in
this castle, to which she was singularly attached. Thus deprived by
death of my Augusta, I felt once more an inclination to travel, and
to resume, if occasion required, my former profession, that of arms.
Mathias had now succeeded to the empire; and though by no means
attached to this haughty Prince, I determined to defend my country,
now suffering from a confederacy called the Evangelical League, which
was, however, counterbalanced by an host equally formidable, the
assembly of the Catholics.</p>

<p>'Those who have courage to take an active part on either side when
a kingdom is divided against itself, are encompassed with innumerable
dangers, and few there are that escape persecution. Some trifling
inadvertency, which I could never perfectly understand, was alledged
against me, which was blackened with so many malicious insinuations,
that, without any formal accusation, I was conveyed by stratagem from
the kingdom, after having rendered it many services; and having found
means of escaping from my persecutors, was confined in a prison by
order of Mathias, who recollecting that in the reign of his brother I
was no friend to his unjust pretensions, eagerly listened to the
calumnious reports which were circulated by my enemies for the
accomplishment of my destruction. In this miserable situation I
remained near two years, and then, without any reason being publicly
given for this, or for my mysterious confinement, I was as strangely
released. Thus emancipated from captivity, I resolved to leave the
intrigues of Courts, and the uncertainty of arms, to the young and
the fortunate, and to return again to my former residence. Having put
my intention into practice, of resigning for ever a military life, I
returned to the castle of Elfinbach, anxious to clasp to my heart a
daughter from whom I had been so unjustly separated. But what was my
grief, when I was informed that both she and the Conte were dead, the
latter being slain by a party of banditti, or some other as lawless
wretches, which caused the death of the lovely mourner, his widow,
soon after she had given birth to a daughter, who, it was supposed,
had died with her! Though I had no suspicion of the falsehood of the
report concerning the fate of the infant, having never heard any
thing to the disadvantage of the late Marchese de Montferrat, who I
knew to be the nearest relative of the Conte della Caro, and
consequently the next heir to his estates if he died childless; yet I
could not forbear sometimes listening to reports which were
circulated, though not generally believed, in the neighbourhood of
Turin (whither I afterwards repaired) respecting a female infant,
which was sent to nurse by the Marchese de Montferrat, believed by
some to have been the daughter of the Contessa della Caro. This
instigated me to call on the woman who had accepted the charge; but,
except a numerous family of her own, she had no child in her care;
and her replies were at once so simple and so artless, that I easily
credited her assertion, which tended to convince me that all reports
upon this subject were founded in error. Weary of a world in which I
was left al-e and unfriended, I finally determined to find out some
secure and peaceful asylum, where I might terminate my days in peace
and solitude; and at length fixed upon a little alpine spot amid the
mountains of Switzerland, which was merely a cottage. In this
melancholy retreat I remained many years under an assumed character
and name, leading literally the life of a hermit, till a very
singular dream, joined with an ardent desire of visiting my former
dwelling, induced me to quit my retirement.</p>

<p>'It was one night, when I had fallen into a sleep much earlier
than usual, that I thought a person approached me as I slept, and
bade me to repair without delay to the castle of Elfinbach, for in
that mansion the offspring of the unfortunate Conte della Care was
receiving her education, and that it depended upon myself not only to
reinstate her in the possessions of her ancestors, but to save her
from misery and from death. This visionary address was so deeply
impressed upon my mind, that it was long before I could recompose my
spirits, or convince myself it was but a dream. At the same hour the
next night the command was repeated; the same figure appeared to me
again in the visions of my sleep, bidding me depart, and watch
unobserved the movements of the present inhabitants of the castle;
not openly to declare what I had been told, but to wait the effects
of time, which would eventually unravel all. This repetition of the
last night's adventure determined me to adhere to the advice
delivered; and having procured the habit of a white Friar, the better
to protect me from danger and impertinence, I commenced, in the
character of a ghost, my nightly watchings. I soon, however,
discovered means of informing Ambrose that I was mortal, and from him
gained an accurate account of what was passing in the castle, and
what had happened before I reached its boundaries. From what he
affirmed, I had every reason to believe that my dream was founded on
truth, though it was riot sutflcient to lead to a certainty.</p>

<p>'To the chapel I had free access, continued the Monk, 'at every
hour of the night, and also to the burial-vault beneath, which I
entered by means of an outward door opening behind the headless
statue erected at the extremity, where I frequently spent some time
in conversation with Ambrose, or, when alone, allowed myself the sad
indulgence of weeping over the remains of my beloved Augusta, which
were entombed in that place.</p>

<p>'When I beheld you, which was not, in spite of my utmost
endeavours, till several weeks after my arrival, the resemblance you
bore to your mother, convinced me you was her child; and thinking it
necessary to warn you of your danger whilst in the power of the
Marchese de Moutferrat, I delivered you her picture, and meant to
have disclosed the secret of your birth, and then to have offered you
my protection; but was prevented by the interference of Paoli and
your sudden removal. Not knowing whither you was conveyed, till after
the return of Ambrose, which did not happen till a considerable time
afterwards, I suffered the most restless anxiety for your safety. His
presence, however, when lie came to discharge the domestics, relieved
me from apprehension, though the information he gave me determined me
to go immediately in quest of you. Not knowing the exact situation of
the castle in the principality of Saltzburg, I was obliged to repeat
my inquiries; and being at first unsuccessful, was directed by
chance, or rather by Providence, into the chapel of a forsaken abbey,
which you afterwards entered, attended by a stranger of a dignified
and amiable aspect, who proved to be the present Marchese. His
presence prevented me from addressing you as I should otherwise have
done; but by following you along the mountains, I had soon an
opportunity of discovering your place of residence. After this event,
I frequented the castle of Lunenburg as I had formerly done this, but
without obtaining the accomplishment of my desires. Soon afterwards I
learned from Ambrose, whom I largely rewarded for this intelligence,
that you was sent into a convent on the borders of Italy, and that
the Marchese had retired in extreme perturbation of spirits and
distress of mind to the castle of Elfinbach. Knowing, if this was the
ease, which I had no reason to doubt, that I might be enabled by some
means, during your year of initiation, to contrive your escape, could
I inform myself of your place of destination, I repaired again to
this ancient and almost deserted mansion, entertaining some hopes
that, with the assistance of Ambrose, I might repeat with success my
supernatural appearances, and thus surprise and terrify the Marchese
into confession; since it was now evident, from the whole of his
conduct, that he had concealed, and usurped the rights of, a
defenceless orphan. In this attempt I succeeded, and by the
assistance of a trap-door, so artfully contrived as not to be
perceived by the most careful observer, gained the interior of his
apartment, and so well accommodated myself to his own guilty
feelings, that the disorder of his mind hourly increased, and was
followed by an alarming disease, attended with many dangerous
symptoms. This occasioned him to send for a Confessor from the
Carthusian monastery, that he might have an opportunity of
unburthening his conscience.</p>

<p>'I was fortunately at the abbey of St Angelo at the time the
message arrived, in the society of Father Benedicta, with whoni,
under my assumed habit, I had accidentally formed a superficial
acquaintance, and whose worth and goodness led me to esteem his
character long before I was personally known to him. As to learn the
substance of a confession, which appeared to promise much important
information, was of the utmost consequence to my future interests, I
formed the resolution of attending as Confessor, as I knew the
severity of the ecclesiastical rules would effectually prevent my
obtaining this knowledge, however necessary, by any other means. This
induced me to make my intention known to Father Benedicta relative to
my plan of personating a Carthusian, though without disclosing to him
that I was not really a Friar; and with some difficulty, after making
my reasons partly known, prevailed upon him to supply me with a habit
of the order.</p>

<p>As the Marchese had not signified a desire that any particular
Friar should attend, I was readily admitted, and soon learned the
cause of his remorse; but the purport of this singular confession I
consider myself as bound, by the strictest ties of religion, as well
as of honour, strictly to conceal, and should consider myself as
culpable by the laws of justice, if I suffered myself to reveal it,
as if I had taken the indissoluble oath administered in the period of
initiation, which binds to eternal secrecy as to the nature of
confessions.</p>

<p>'When the Marchese had completely unburthened his conscience,
which was not till my third visit, and it was proved, after the
arrival of the Conte della Croisse, that you was in a place of
security, which appeared to take a considerable weight from his
heart, I sent one of the brotherhood to bestow absolution, not being
empowered to perform this ceremony myself, to whom also the substance
of the confession was repeated in the same manner as before, though
from the appearance of the Monk, which perfectly corresponded with my
own, the Marchese was not conscious of the deception.</p>

<p>'As soon as these ceremonies were properly adjusted, I informed
Father Benedicta of the artifice I had employed; and having thrown
aside the habit I had formerly worn, substituted that adopted by the
Carthusiaris; and entering juto the convent of St Angelo, agreeable
to mv former intention, took the name of Father Andrea.</p>

<p>'With all the rest, my dear child,' rejoined the Monk, 'you are
already acquainted. I have now related to you all the material
mcidents of my past life, which for many years has been marked with
severe misfortune; but Heaven, in your preservation and happiness,
has bestowed some sweeteners of my melancholy existence, and I
receive them with gratitude.'</p>

<h3>Chapter 12</h3>

<pre>
Swift o'er the lyre's harmonious strings
His magic hand the minstrel flings;
Obedient to the sprightly sound
The dancers' quivering feet rebound:
Diffusing wide their silver rays.
Aloft the sparkling lustres blare:
While milder emanations flow
From love-enkindling orbs below.
--SALMAGUNDI
</pre>

<p>The Marchesa and Laurette did not neglect, amid the newly-acquired
happiness that surrounded them, to visit their amiable acquaintance,
the Abbess of the Order of Penitents, who received them with every
proof of the sincerest affection. To her society they devoted many of
the intervening hours passed in the absence of Enrico and his
venerable friend, finding in her conversation all that elegance of
expression, and delicacy of sentiment, which rendered her as charming
as respectable, even in the midst of age and infirmities.</p>

<p>It was now the latter end of May, and the season remarkably fine.
The groves and the woods were again clothed in the most delightful
verdure, whilst the hedgerows, which displayed that luxuriance of
foliage ever perceptible in this fertile country, were now
beautifully embroidered with honeysuckles, and overhung with the
blushing wreaths of the rosa canina; all Nature seemed to have
awakened to joy and harmony! With what emotions of delight did
Laurette now wander along the borders of that river, whose bank had
formerly been the scene of infant pastime, recalling fondly to her
recollection the years that were past, and alternately weeping and
smiling at the vicissitudes of fortune! How charming was it to bring
back, with the aid of memory, every interesting event in that
uninformed period of existence, when hope revelled in the heart
unchecked by disappointment, and joy suffered no decrease from gloomy
retrospection! It was after one of these sweet lonely excursions,
which she had commenced in the absence of the Marchesa, who had taken
an early walk to the convent, that she observed at some distance four
horsemen advancing towards the castle, which on a nearer view she
discovered to be Enrico and the Conte della Croisse, attended by
Anselmo and another of the domestics.</p>

<p>Tremblingly alive to every sensation of pleasure, she bounded
swiftly from the mountains, and before the travellers alighted,
arrived at the portico. As soon as Enrico observed her, his eyes
beamed with inexpressible rapture, whilst love, in the most lively
colours, was depicted on his countenance.</p>

<p>The usual expressions of congratulation on meeting again being
over, which were accompanied, on the part of Enrico and Laurette,
with those melting looks of unspeakable affection which lovers only
understand, they were joined in the terrace-parlour by the Marchesa,
and soon afterwards by the Signora d'Orfo.</p>

<p>When the travellers had partaken of a little refreshment, they
were requested to relate the success of their journey, which, they
soon convinced their hearers had been every way fortunate; since
proofs of the legitimacy of Enrico's birth had appeared sufficient to
silence the claim of any other person, should an attempt to
discountenance the justice and truth of the fact be hereafter
made.</p>

<p>'Yet my happiness is at present incomplcte,' cried Enrico, casting
a look of tenderness upon the timid blushing Laurette; 'will not she
then, who has it exclusively in her power to bestow on me the
felicity I ask, deign to confer it? Can she doubt the strength of my
affection, or refuse to reward it, after having received so many
testimonies of its permanency?'</p>

<p>'She does not mean to prevent, or even to procrastinate your
happiness,' replied the Marchesa. 'She is above dissimulation; and as
I have hitherto been allowed to influence her actions under the
character of a preceptress, she will grant me the privilege of naming
the day. Will you not, my lovely pupil,' resumed the Marchesa, with a
smile of ineffable tenderness, 'give me this new proof of your
dutiful acquiescence, the last I may have cause to demand?'</p>

<p>Laurette blushed deeply; and, having assured her beloved friend
that any request of her's would have the force of a command,
permitted her, after a little gentle reluctance, to name the same day
on the following week.</p>

<p>Enrico's joy on this occasion could only discover itself in tears;
every wish of his soul was gratified, and it now appeared impossible,
to his delighted imagination, that sorrow could ever again become an
inmate of his breast.</p>

<p>The week now passed rapidly towards the close, which was employed
by the Marchesa and the Signora in preparing for the intended
marriage, which was to be attended with all that diffusive
hospitality, so strikingly exhibited in the character of the former,
and which she had now the power, as well as the inclination, to
display.</p>

<p>Enrico and Laurette, in the meantime, found an inexhaustible
source of delight in traversing those sublimc and beautiful regions
in which the castle was situated. The trackless mountain, whose rocky
glens were encrusted with moss or enamelled with wildflowers; the
impenetrable forest, sacred to the foot of the adventurer, were
objects of curiosity and wonder, which they were never weary of
contemplating or admiring, among which every day presented, from the
variety of their productions, some new subject for investigation.</p>

<p>At last the long-expected day, which was to ratify these solemn
vows already registered in heaven, arrived. The officiating priest
was the Father Benedicta, who, at his own request, had the felicity
of receiving the lovely bride at the hand of Father Andrea, in the
chapel of the castle, by the name of Laurette Contessa della Cano,
and of bestowing her upon Enrico Marchese de Montferrat.</p>

<p>The ceremony being performed in the morning, the remaining part of
the day was dedicated to rural festivity; and every luxury was
procured in honour of this event, that the country, within some
leagues of the mansion, could afford. The nuptials were, indeed, not
celebrated with the lofty appearance of courtly personages, as none,
except the family at the castle, could boast of a noble origin; the
rest of the company being composed of the tenantry and uninformed
inhabitants of those humble cottages, which were--variously dispersed
on the banks of the Rhine, who concluded the evenirig of this joyful
day with a dance upon the lawn, to the lively notes of the guitar and
the hautboy; each returning laden with presents to their homes, and
pouring out blessings upon their hospitable entertainers.</p>

<p>Nothing could exceed the happiness of Father Andrea, when he
beheld the felicity of his children thus hourly increasing. He seemed
to have forgotten already all his sorrows, and looked up to Heaven
with pious gratitude, which had thus recompensed his patience and
sufferings, long after lie had ceased to expect a temporal
reward.</p>

<p>Inured to solitude, and naturally attached to it, the young
Marchesa never wished to stray beyond her native mountains; she had
formed no ideas of happiness beyond them, and it was not without some
reluctance that she quitted the castle of Elfinbach, the abode of her
childhood, to repair to the mansion on the Saltzburg estate till the
former one was rendered more habitable. This was, however, a
necessary measure, as a considerable part of the fabric was so much
decayed as to form but an uncomfortable asylum. On this expedition
she was attended by the whole of the family, except the Conte della
Croisse and the Fathers, as the former had determined upon visiting
his daughter at Augsberg during their absence from the castle, and
the Monks were obliged to remain in the convent of St Angelo.</p>

<p>In this modern and luxurious mansion, which to the elder Marchesa
had all the charms of novelty to recommend it, they prolonged their
stay till the castle of Elfinbach was made fit for their residence,
which seemed, from having been long known as well as from the
circumstance of its having been the seat of Father Andrea when
dignified by the title of Baron Neuburg, and of the late Contessa
della Caro, to have a prior claim to their regard. Laurette had
already resolved to return to it, and quit it no more; and Enrico,
whose every wish centered in her happiness, had adopted a similar
resolution, being not less attached to it than the beautiful
Marchesa.</p>

<p>During their continuance at the castle of Lunenburg, the
generosity of this noble family was so unbounded, that on leaving it
they were followed for a considerable way by a large number of the
peasantry, who crowded about their carriages with tearful eyes,
showering blessings upon them as they repeated their adicus. How
delightful were these simple effusions of gratitude to those on whom
they were bestowed! And who that has a mind capable of reflection,
and a heart of feeling, would exchange those noble impulses of our
nature, which direct us to acts of Godlike benevolence, for the
chillness of unsocial grandeur? And how can it be truly estimated
what they lose, who suffer themselves to be deluded into an opinion
that the bold pre-eminence of rank and state can compensate for the
absence of those amiable aflections, which teach us to conciliate and
to deserve the love of others?</p>

<p>As the weather was more than usually favourable, they travelled
leisurely towards the castle, Enrico and Laurette occupying one of
the carriages, and the elder Marchesa and the Signora the other,
frequently stopping, and sometimes alighting; when any thing
particularly attracted their attention.</p>

<p>On the evening of the third day they arrived at the castle of
Elfinbach, which wore a much more comfortable appearance than when
they quitted it last. The rampart-walls, the turrets, and buttresses,
were repaired, and the fallen fragments, which before were only
partially removed, were cleared from the courts, which, with the
whole of the grounds, were new mown for their reception.</p>

<p>The Monks seized the first opportunity of welcoming them home, and
a few days afterwards the happiness of the whole partv was materially
augmented by the presence of the Conte della Croisse, who informed
Enrico, soon after his arrival, that he had long secretly formed a
resolution of entering into the convent of St Angelo; and having
taken leave of his daughter, was come purposely to fulfil his
intention.</p>

<p>'The crimes of my youth,' resumed the Conte, 'stand yet in
terrible array before me, and the only atonement I can now make for
my offences, is to dedicate the remaining part of my life to prayer
and penitence. Hitherto I have been irresistibly withheld from the
execution of my intention; for the designations of Providence are
uncontroulable. It was the will of Heaven that I should continue in
society, to become an instrument of punishment to the guilty, and to
rescue innocence from the grasp of oppression, relieving myself by
these means from a debt of gratitude, which I should otherwise have
found it impossible to have discharged; but the end being
accomplished, why should I longer defer the prosecution of my
purpose, since I am already bending with years, and, in the common
course of nature, cannot reasonably expect to continue much longer an
inhabitant of this world?'</p>

<p>Enrico finding that his friend was bent upon this new project, and
being secretly gratified on his having fixed upon the convent of St
Angelo for his future abode, did not attempt to dissuade him from his
design but gained, or rather wrested a promise from him, that he
would remain in the family for the space of a month. Often in the
society of Laurette and Enrico did the penitent Della Croisse fix his
eyes upon them with an expression of earnest tenderness, as he
witnessed their mutual affection, whilst busy memory reverted to the
scenes of his youth, and presented the image of his Helena, with all
its amiable accompaniments, to his mind. When reflecting upon her,
his thoughts would frequently glance upon Laurentina, she whose
Circean charms had accomplished his overthrow, arid dwell with
painful regret upon the recollection of his complicated enmes and
misfortunes.</p>

<p>'Learn from my fate, my children,' he would sometimes say,
addressing himself to the lovely pair, 'the danger of venturing on
the borders of vice. I was once virtuous as you are; but one fatal
error, one unsubdued passion, plunged me irito irremediable guilt;
yet not aware of my danger, even when on the brink of a precipice, I
believed I could return at discretion to the path of rectitude; but
when once tempted to deviate from the principles of truth and honour,
how soon is every amiable impression obliterated from the heart, how
soon does vice by familiarity lose its deformity! Yet what an
inexhaustible source of felicity is an untainted conscience, and how
eternally connected are guilt and misery!'</p>

<p>Often, as he thus movingly addressed them, did he melt his
audience into tears, who endeavoured, with all those gentle
assiduities, which sensibility like their's knew so well how to
bestow, to delude him into a transient forgetfulness of his past
crimes; and sometimes attempted to convince him that the purity of
his present conduct, aided by the sorrow he expressed for what could
not be recalled, was sufficient to atone for the errors of his youth;
and that the irregularities into which he had been precipitated
through the artifice of others, were not so much to be attributed to
his faults as his misfortunes.</p>

<p>Anselmo, whose faithful attachment to his master had rather
increased than diminished, was, in consideration of his former
services, exalted to the rank of steward, which the generous Marchese
contrived to make both an easy and lucrative post.</p>

<p>Thus restored to joy and tranquillity, the inhabitants of the
castle of Elfinbach enjoyed the most uninterrupted felicity.--Enrico,
whose dutiful impulses prompted him to the most benevolent exertions,
set apart annually a third of his princely income for charitable
purposes; and his mother, following his bright example, adopted a
similar plan. None that entered the portals of this hospitable
mansion departed without calling down blessings from Heaven upon its
owners.</p>

<p>Della Croisse, at the appointed time, repaired to the convent of
St Angelo, and entered into the severe order of the Carthusians,
where he found, in the purified conversation of his early companion,
the pious Benedicta, and that of Father Andrea, all the consolation
he was capable of receiving.--Whilst blessed with health, virtue, and
innocence, the Marchese and Marchesa, in the bosom of their amiable
family, experienced the most refined sensations of happiness; and
anxious of possessing it themselves, felt a Godlike pleasure in
dispensing it to others. They were blessed with a numerous offspring,
lovely as themselves, and presented, in the whole of their lives to
the reflecting mind of the moralist, a striking instance of the
imbecility of vice, and of the triumphant power of virtue.</p>
