  <p class="first">"THIS," said the Franciscan, "is my Automaton, who at the
  proper time will speak, answer whatsoever question I may ask, and reveal all
  secret knowledge to me." He smiled as he laid his hand affectionately on the
  iron skull that topped the pedestal.</p>

  <p>The youth gazed open-mouthed, first at the head and then at the Friar.
  "But it's iron!" he whispered. "The head is iron, good father."</p>

  <p>"Iron without, skill within, my son," said Roger Bacon. "It will speak, at
  the proper time and in its own manner, for so have I made it. A clever man
  can twist the devil's arts to God's ends, thereby cheating the fiend&mdash;
  Sst! There sounds vespers! <i>Plena gratia, ave Virgo."</i></p>

  <p>But it did not speak. Long hours, long weeks, the <i>doctor mirabilis</i>
  watched his creation, but iron lips were silent and the iron eyes dull, and
  no voice but the great man's own sounded in his monkish cell, nor was there
  ever an answer to all the questions that he asked&mdash;until one day when he
  sat surveying his work, composing a letter to Duns Scotus in distant
  Cologne&mdash;one day&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Time is!" said the image, and smiled benignly.</p>

  <p>The Friar looked up. "Time is, indeed," he echoed. "Time it is that you
  give utterance, and to some assertion less obvious than that time is. For of
  course time is, else there were nothing at all. Without time &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Time was!" rumbled the image, still smiling, but sternly, at the statue
  of Draco.</p>

  <p>"Indeed time was," said the monk, "Time was, is, and will be, for time is
  that medium in which events occur. Matter exists in space, but
  events&mdash;</p>

  <p>The image smiled no longer. "Time is past!" it roared in tones deep as the
  cathedral bell outside, and burst into ten thousand pieces.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"There," said old Haskel van Manderpootz, shutting the
book, "is my
  classical authority in this experiment. This story, overlaid as it is with
  medieval myth and legend proves that Roger Bacon himself attempted the
  experiment and failed." He shook a long finger at me. "Yet do not get the
  impression, Dixon, that Friar Bacon was not a great man. He was&mdash;
  extremely great, in fact; he lighted the torch that his namesake Francis
  Bacon took up four centuries later, and that now van Manderpootz
  rekindles."</p>

  <p>I stared in silence,</p>

  <p>"Indeed," resumed the Professor, "Roger Bacon might almost be called a
  thirteenth-century van Manderpootz, or van Manderpootz a twenty-first-century
  Roger Bacon. His <i>Opus Majus</i>, <i>Opus Minor</i>, and <i>Opus
  Tertium</i> &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What," I interrupted impatiently, "has all this to do with&mdash;that?" I
  indicated the clumsy metal robot standing in the corner of the
  laboratory.</p>

  <p>"Don't interrupt!" snapped van Manderpootz.</p>

  <p>At this point I fell out of my chair. The mass of metal had ejaculated
  something like "A-a-gh-rasp!" and had lunged a single pace toward the window,
  arms upraised. "What the devil!" I sputtered as the thing dropped its arms
  and returned stolidly to its place.</p>

  <p>"A car must have passed in the alley," said van Manderpootz indifferently.
  "Now as I was saying, Roger Bacon &mdash;"</p>

  <p>I ceased to listen. When van Manderpootz is determined to finish a
  statement, interruptions are worse than futile. As an ex-student of his, I
  know. So I permitted my thoughts to drift to certain personal problems of my
  own, particularly Tips Alva, who was the most pressing problem of the moment.
  Yes, I mean Tips Alva the 'vision dancer, the little blonde imp who
  entertains on the Yerba Mate hour for that Brazilian company. Chorus girls,
  dancers, and television stars are a weakness of mine; maybe it indicates that
  there's a latent artistic soul in me. Maybe.</p>

  <p>I'm Dixon Wells, you know, scion of the N.J. Wells Corporation, Engineers
  Extraordinary. I'm supposed to be an engineer myself; I say supposed, because
  in the seven years since my graduation, my father hasn't given me much
  opportunity to prove it. He has a strong sense of the value of time, and I'm
  cursed with the unenviable quality of being late to anything and for
  everything. He even asserts that the occasional designs I submit are late
  Jacobean, but that isn't fair. They're Post-Romanesque.</p>

  <p>Old N.J. also objects to my penchant for ladies of the stage and 'vision
  screen, and periodically threatens to cut my allowance, though that's
  supposed to be a salary. It's inconvenient to be so dependent, and sometimes
  I regret that unfortunate market crash of 2009 that wiped out my own money,
  although it did keep me from marrying Whimsy White, and van Manderpootz,
  through his subjunctivisor, succeeded in proving that that would have been a
  catastrophe. But it turned out nearly as much of a disaster anyway, as far as
  my feelings were concerned. It took me months to forget Joanna Caldwell and
  her silvery eyes. Just another instance when I was a little late.</p>

  <p>Van Manderpootz himself is my old Physics Professor, head of the
  Department of Newer Physics at N. Y. U., and a genius, but a bit eccentric.
  Judge for yourself.</p>

  <p>"And that's the thesis," he said suddenly, interrupting my thoughts.</p>

  <p>"Eh? Oh, of course. But what's that grinning robot got to do with it?"</p>

  <p>He purpled. "I've just told you!" he roared. "Idiot! Imbecile! To dream
  while van Manderpootz talks! Get out! Get out!"</p>

  <p>I got. It was late anyway, so late that I overslept more than usual in the
  morning, and suffered more than the usual lecture on promptness from my
  father at the office.</p>

  <p>Van Manderpootz had forgotten his anger by the next time I dropped in for
  an evening. The robot still stood in the corner near the window, and I lost
  no time asking its purpose.</p>

  <p>"It's just a toy I had some of the students construct," he explained.
  "There's a screen of photoelectric cells behind the right eye, so connected
  that when a certain pattern is thrown on them, it activates the mechanism.
  The thing's plugged into the light-circuit, but it really ought to run on
  gasoline."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Well, the pattern it's set for is the shape of an automobile. See here."
  He picked up a card from his desk, and cut in the outlines of a streamlined
  car like those of that year. "Since only one eye is used," he continued, "the
  thing can't tell the difference between a full-sized vehicle at a distance
  and this small outline nearby. It has no sense of perspective."</p>

  <p>He held the bit of cardboard before the eye of the mechanism. Instantly
  came its roar of "A-a-gh-rasp!" and it leaped forward a single pace, arms
  upraised. Van Manderpootz withdrew the card, and again the thing relapsed
  stolidly into its place.</p>

  <p>"What the devil!" I exclaimed. "What's it for?"</p>

  <p>"Does van Manderpootz ever do work without reason back of it? I use it as
  a demonstration in my seminar."</p>

  <p>"To demonstrate what?"</p>

  <p>"The power of reason," said van Manderpootz solemnly.</p>

  <p>"How? And why ought it to work on gasoline instead of electric power?"</p>

  <p>"One question at a time, Dixon. You have missed the grandeur of van
  Manderpootz's concept. See here, this creature, imperfect as it is,
  represents the predatory machine. It is the mechanical parallel of the tiger,
  lurking in its jungle to leap on living prey. This monster's jungle is the
  city; its prey is the unwary machine that follows the trails called streets.
  Understand?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Well, picture this automaton, not as it is, but as van Manderpootz could
  make it if he wished. It lurks gigantic in the shadows of buildings; it
  creeps stealthily through dark alleys; it skulks on deserted streets, with
  its gasoline engine purring quietly. Then&mdash;an unsuspecting automobile
  flashes its image on the screen behind its eyes. It leaps. It seizes its
  prey, swinging it in steel arms to its steel jaws. Through the metal throat
  of its victim crash steel teeth; the blood of its prey&mdash;the gasoline,
  that is&mdash;is drained into its stomach, or its gas-tank. With renewed
  strength it flings away the husk and prowls on to seek other prey. It is the
  machine-carnivore, the tiger of mechanics."</p>

  <p>I suppose I stared dumbly. It occurred to me suddenly that the brain of
  the great van Manderpootz was cracking. "What the&mdash;?" I gasped.</p>

  <p>"That," he said blandly, "is but a concept. I have many another use for
  the toy. I can prove anything with it, anything I wish."</p>

  <p>"You can? Then prove something."</p>

  <p>"Name your proposition, Dixon."</p>

  <p>I hesitated, nonplussed.</p>

  <p>"Come!" he said impatiently. "Look here; I will prove that anarchy is the
  ideal government, or that Heaven and Hell are the same place, or that
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Prove that!" I said. "About Heaven and Hell."</p>

  <p>"Easily. First we will endow my robot with intelligence. I add a
  mechanical memory by means of the old Cushman delayed valve; I add a
  mathematical sense with any of the calculating machines; I give it a voice
  and a vocabulary with the magnetic-impulse wire phonograph. Now the point I
  make is this: Granted an intelligent machine, does it not follow that every
  other machine constructed like it must have the identical qualities? Would
  not each robot given the same insides have exactly the same character?"</p>

  <p>"No!" I snapped. "Human beings can't make two machines exactly alike.
  There'd be tiny differences; one would react quicker than others, or one
  would prefer Fox Airsplitters as prey, while another reacted most vigorously
  to Carnecars. In other words, they'd have&mdash;individuality!" I grinned in
  triumph.</p>

  <p>"My point exactly," observed van Manderpootz. "You admit, then, that this
  individuality is the result of imperfect workmanship. If our means of
  manufacture were perfect, all robots would be identical, and this
  individuality would not exist. Is that true?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;suppose so."</p>

  <p>"Then I argue that our own individuality is due to our falling short of
  perfection. All of us&mdash;even van Manderpootz&mdash;are individuals only
  because we are not perfect. Were we perfect, each of us would be exactly like
  everyone else. True?"</p>

  <p>"Uh-yes."</p>

  <p>"But Heaven, by definition, is a place where all is perfect. Therefore, in
  Heaven everybody is exactly like everybody else; and therefore, everybody
  thoroughly and completely bored. There is no torture like boredom, Dixon, and
  &mdash;Well, have I proved my point?"</p>

  <p>I was floored. "But&mdash;about anarchy, then?" I stammered.</p>

  <p>"Simple. Very simple for van Manderpootz. See here; with a perfect nation
  &mdash;that is, one whose individuals are all exactly alike, which I have
  just proved to constitute perfection&mdash;with a perfect nation, I repeat,
  laws and government are utterly superfluous. If everybody reacts to stimuli
  in the same way, laws are quite useless, obviously. If, for instance, a
  certain event occurred that might lead to a declaration of war, why,
  everybody in such a nation would vote for war at the same instant. Therefore
  government is unnecessary, and therefore anarchy is the ideal government,
  since it is the proper government for a perfect race." He paused. "I shall
  now prove that anarchy is not the ideal government &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind!" I begged. "Who am I to argue with van Manderpootz? But is
  that the whole purpose of this dizzy robot? Just a basis for logic?" The
  mechanism replied with its usual rasp as it leaped toward some vagrant car
  beyond the window.</p>

  <p>"Isn't that enough?" growled van Manderpootz. "However"&mdash;his voice
  dropped&mdash;"I have even a greater destiny in mind. My boy, van Manderpootz
  has solved the riddle of the universe!" He paused impressively. "Well, why
  don't you say something?"</p>

  <p>"Uh!" I gasped. "It's&mdash;uh&mdash;marvelous!"</p>

  <p>"Not for van Manderpootz," he said modestly.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;what is it?"</p>

  <p>"Eh&mdash;oh!" He frowned. "Well, I'll tell you, Dixon. You won't
  understand, but I'll tell you." He coughed. "As far back as the early
  twentieth century," he resumed, "Einstein proved that energy is particular.
  Matter is also particular, and now van Manderpootz adds that space and time
  are discrete!" He glared at me.</p>

  <p>"Energy and matter are particular," I murmured, "and space and time are
  discrete! How very moral of them!"</p>

  <p>"Imbecile!" he blazed. "To pun on the words of van Manderpootz! You know
  very well that I mean particular and discrete in the physical sense. Matter
  is composed of particles, therefore it is particular. The particles of matter
  are called electrons, protons, and neutrons, and those of energy, quanta. I
  now add two others, the particles of space I call spations, those of time,
  chronons."</p>

  <p>"And what in the devil," I asked, "are particles of space and time?"</p>

  <p>"Just what I said!" snapped van Manderpootz. "Exactly as the particles of
  matter are the smallest pieces of matter that can exist, just as there is no
  such thing as a half of an electron, or for that matter, half a quantum, so
  the chronon is the smallest possible fragment of time, and the spation the
  smallest possible bit of space. Neither time nor space is continuous; each is
  composed of these infinitely tiny fragments."</p>

  <p>"Well, how long is a chronon in time? How big is a spation in space?"</p>

  <p>"Van Manderpootz has even measured that. A chronon is the length of time
  it takes one quantum of energy to push one electron from one electronic orbit
  to the next. There can obviously be no shorter interval of time, since an
  electron is the smallest unit of matter and the quantum the smallest unit of
  energy. And a spation is the exact volume of a proton. Since nothing smaller
  exists, that is obviously the smallest unit of space."</p>

  <p>"Well, look here," I argued. "Then what's in between these particles of
  space and time? If time moves, as you say, in jerks of one chronon each,
  what's between the jerks?"</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said the great van Manderpootz. "Now we come to the heart of the
  matter. In between the particles of space and time, must obviously be
  something that is neither space, time, matter, nor energy. A hundred years
  ago Shapley anticipated van Manderpootz in a vague way when he announced his
  cosmo-plasma, the great underlying matrix in which time and space and the
  universe are embedded. Now van Manderpootz announces the ultimate unit, the
  universal particle, the focus in which matter, energy, time, and space meet,
  the unit from which electrons, protons, neutrons, quanta, spations, and
  chronons are all constructed. The riddle of the universe is solved by what I
  have chosen to name the cosmon." His blue eyes bored into me.</p>

  <p>"Magnificent!" I said feebly, knowing that some such word was expected.
  "But what good is it?"</p>

  <p>"What good is it?" he roared. "It provides&mdash;or will provide, once I
  work out a few details&mdash;the means of turning energy into time, or space
  into matter, or time into space, or &mdash;" He sputtered into silence.
  "Fool!" he muttered. "To think that you studied under the tutelage of van
  Manderpootz. I blush; I actually blush!"</p>

  <p>One couldn't have told it if he were blushing. His face was always
  rubicund enough. "Colossal!" I said hastily. "What a mind!"</p>

  <p>That mollified him. "But that's not all," he proceeded. "'Van Manderpootz
  never stops short of perfection. I now announce the unit particle of thought
  &mdash;the psychon!"</p>

  <p>This was a little too much. I simply stared.</p>

  <p>"Well may you be dumbfounded," said van Manderpootz. "I presume you are
  aware, by hearsay at least, of the existence of thought. The psychon, the
  unit of thought, is one electron plus one proton, which are bound so as to
  form one neutron, embedded in one cosmon, occupying a volume of one spation,
  driven by one quantum for a period of one chronon. Very obvious; very
  simple."</p>

  <p>"Oh, very!" I echoed. "Even I can see that that equals one psychon."</p>

  <p>He beamed. "Excellent! Excellent!"</p>

  <p>"And what," I asked, "will you do with the psychons?"</p>

  <p>"Ah," he rumbled. "Now we go even past the heart of the matter, and return
  to Isaak here." He jammed a thumb toward the robot. "Here I will create Roger
  Bacon's mechanical head. In the skull of this clumsy creature will rest such
  intelligence as not even van Manderpootz&mdash;I should say, as only van
  Manderpootz&mdash;can conceive. It remains merely to construct my
  idealizator."</p>

  <p>"Your idealizator?"</p>

  <p>"Of course. Have I not just proven that thoughts are as real as matter,
  energy, time, or space? Have I not just demonstrated that one can be
  transformed, through the cosmon, into any other? My idealizator is the means
  of transforming psychons to quanta, just as, for instance, a Crookes tube or
  X-ray tube transforms matter to electrons. I will make your thoughts visible!
  And not your thoughts as they are in that numb brain of yours, but in ideal
  form. Do you see? The psychons of your mind are the same as those from any
  other mind, just as all electrons are identical, whether from gold or iron.
  Yes! Your psychons"&mdash;his voice quavered&mdash;"are identical with those
  from the mind of&mdash;van Manderpootz!" He paused, shaken.</p>

  <p>"Actually?" I gasped.</p>

  <p>"Actually. Fewer in number, of course, but identical. Therefore, my
  idealizator shows your thought released from the impress of your personality.
  It shows it&mdash;ideal!"</p>

  <p>Well, I was late to the office again.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">A week later I thought of van Manderpootz. Tips was on tour
somewhere, and
  I didn't dare take anyone else out because I'd tried it once before and she'd
  heard about it. So, with nothing to do, I finally dropped around to the
  professor's quarter, found him missing, and eventually located him in his
  laboratory at the Physics Building. He was puttering around the table that
  had once held that damned subjunctivisor of his, but now it supported an
  indescribable mess of tubes and tangled wires, and as its most striking
  feature, a circular plane mirror etched with a grating of delicately
  scratched lines.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, Dixon," he rumbled.</p>

  <p>I echoed his greeting. "What's that?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"My idealizator. A rough model, much too clumsy to fit into Isaak's iron
  skull. I'm just finishing it to try it out." He turned glittering blue eyes
  on me. "How fortunate that you're here. It will save the world a terrible
  risk."</p>

  <p>"A risk?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. It is obvious that too long an exposure to the device will extract
  too many psychons, and leave the subject's mind in a sort of moronic
  condition. I was about to accept the risk, but I see now that it would be
  woefully unfair to the world to endanger the mind of van Manderpootz. But you
  are at hand, and will do very well."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no I won't!"</p>

  <p>"Come, come!" he said, frowning. "The danger is negligible. In fact, I
  doubt whether the device will be able to extract any psychons from your mind.
  At any rate, you will be perfectly safe for a period of at least half an
  hour. I, with a vastly more productive mind, could doubtless stand the strain
  indefinitely, but my responsibility to the world is too great to chance it
  until I have tested the machine on someone else. You should be proud of the
  honor."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm not!" But my protest was feeble, and after all, despite his
  overbearing mannerisms, I knew van Manderpootz liked me, and I was positive
  he would not have exposed me to any real danger. In the end I found myself
  seated before the table facing the etched mirror.</p>

  <p>"Put your face against the barrel," said van Manderpootz, indicating a
  stovepipe-like tube. "That's merely to cut off extraneous sights, so that you
  can see only the mirror. Go ahead, I tell you! It's no more than the barrel
  of a telescope or microscope."</p>

  <p>I complied. "Now what?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"What do you see?"</p>

  <p>"My own face in the mirror."</p>

  <p>"Of course. Now I start the reflector rotating." There was a faint whir,
  and the mirror was spinning smoothly, still with only a slightly blurred
  image of myself. "Listen, now," continued van Manderpootz. "Here is what you
  are to do. You will think of a generic noun. 'House,' for instance. If you
  think of house, you will see, not an individual house, but your ideal house,
  the house of all your dreams and desires. If you think of a horse, you will
  see what your mind conceives as the perfect horse, such a horse as dream and
  longing create. Do you understand? Have you chosen a topic?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." After all, I was only twenty-eight; the noun I had chosen was
  &mdash;girl.</p>

  <p>"Good," said the professor. "I turn on the current."</p>

  <p>There was a blue radiance behind the mirror. My own face still stared back
  at me from the spinning surface, but something was forming behind it,
  building up, growing. I blinked; when I focused my eyes again, it was&mdash;
  she was&mdash;there.</p>

  <p>Lord! I can't begin to describe her. I don't even know if I saw her
  clearly the first time. It was like looking into another world and seeing the
  embodiment of all longings, dreams, aspirations, and ideals. It was so
  poignant a sensation that it crossed the borderline into pain. It was&mdash;
  well, exquisite torture or agonized delight. It was at once unbearable and
  irresistible.</p>

  <p>But I gazed. I had to. There was a haunting familiarity about the
  impossibly beautiful features. I had seen the face&mdash;somewhere&mdash;
  sometime. In dreams? No; I realized suddenly what was the source of that
  familiarity. This was no living woman, but a synthesis. Her nose was the
  tiny, impudent one of Whimsy White at her loveliest moment; her lips were the
  perfect bow of Tips Alva; her silvery eyes and dusky velvet hair were those
  of Joan Caldwell. But the aggregate, the sum total, the face in the mirror
  &mdash;that was none of these; it was a face impossibly, incredibly,
  outrageously beautiful.</p>

  <p>Only her face and throat were visible, and the features, were cool,
  expressionless, and still as a carving. I wondered suddenly if she could
  smile, and with the thought, she did. If she had been beautiful before, now
  her beauty flamed to such a pitch that it was&mdash;well, insolent; it was an
  affront to be so lovely; it was insulting. I felt a wild surge of anger that
  the image before me should flaunt such beauty, and yet be&mdash;
  non-existent! It was deception, cheating, fraud, a promise that could never
  be fulfilled.</p>

  <p>Anger died in the depths of that fascination. I wondered what the rest of
  her was like, and instantly she moved gracefully back until her full figure
  was visible. I must be a prude at heart, for she wasn't wearing the usual
  cuirass-and-shorts of that year, but an iridescent four-paneled costume that
  all but concealed her dainty knees. But her form was slim and erect as a
  column of cigarette smoke in still air, and I knew that she could dance like
  a fragment of mist on water. And with that thought she did move, dropping in
  a low curtsy, and looking up with the faintest possible flush crimsoning the
  curve of her throat. Yes, I must be a prude at heart; despite Tips Alva and
  Whimsey White and the rest, my ideal was modest.</p>

  <p>It was unbelievable that the mirror was simply giving back my thoughts.
  She seemed as real as myself, and&mdash;after all&mdash;I guess she was. As
  real as myself, no more, no less, because she was part of my own mind. And at
  this point I realized that van Manderpootz was shaking me and bellowing,
  "Your time's up. Come out of it! Your half-hour's up!"</p>

  <p>"O-o-o-o-o-oh!" I groaned.</p>

  <p>"How do you feel?" he snapped.</p>

  <p>"Feel? All right&mdash;physically." I looked up.</p>

  <p>Concern flickered in his blue eyes. "What's the cube root of 4913?" he
  crackled sharply.</p>

  <p>I've always been quick at figures. "It's&mdash;uh&mdash;17," I returned
  dully. "Why the devil-T'"</p>

  <p>"You're all right mentally," he announced. "Now&mdash;why were you sitting
  there like a dummy for half an hour? My idealizator must have worked, as is
  only natural for a van Manderpootz creation, but what were you thinking
  of?"</p>

  <p>"I thought&mdash;I thought of 'girl'," I groaned.</p>

  <p>He snorted. "Hah! You would, you idiot! 'House' or 'horse', wasn't good
  enough; you had to pick something with emotional connotations. Well, you can
  start right in forgetting her, because she doesn't exist."</p>

  <p>I couldn't give up hope as easily as that. "But can't you&mdash;can't you
  &mdash;" I didn't even know what I meant to ask.</p>

  <p>"Van Manderpootz," he announced, "is a mathematician, not a magician. Do
  you expect me to materialize an ideal for you?" When I had no reply but a
  groan, he continued. "Now I think it safe enough to try the device myself. I
  shall take&mdash;let's see&mdash;the thought 'man.' I shall see what the
  superman looks like, since the ideal of van Manderpootz can be nothing less
  than superman." He seated himself. "Turn that switch," he said. "Now!"</p>

  <p>I did. The tubes glowed into low blue light. I watched dully,
  disinterestedly; nothing held any attraction for me after that image of the
  ideal.</p>

  <p>"Huh!" said van Manderpootz suddenly. "Turn it on, I say! I see nothing
  but my own reflection."</p>

  <p>I stared, then burst into a hollow laugh. The mirror was spinning; the
  banks of tubes were glowing; the device was operating.</p>

  <p>Van Manderpootz raised his face, a little redder than usual. I laughed
  half hysterically. "After all," he said huffily, "one might have a lower
  ideal of man than van Manderpootz. I see nothing nearly so humorous as your
  situation."</p>

  <p>The laughter died. I went miserably home, spent half the remainder of the
  night in morose contemplation, smoked nearly two packs of cigarettes, and
  didn't get to the office at all the next day.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Tips Alva got back to town for a weekend broadcast, but I
didn't even
  bother to see her, just phoned her and told her I was sick. I guess my face
  lent credibility to the story, for she was duly sympathetic, and her face in
  the phone screen was quite anxious. Even at that, I couldn't keep my eyes
  away from her lips because, except for a bit too lustrous make-up, they were
  the lips of the ideal. But they weren't enough; they just weren't enough.</p>

  <p>Old N.J. began to worry again. I couldn't sleep late of mornings any more,
  and after missing that one day, I kept getting down earlier and earlier until
  one morning I was only ten minutes late. He called me in at once.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Dixon," he said. "Have you been to a doctor recently?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not sick," I said listlessly.</p>

  <p>"Then for Heaven's sake, marry the girl! I don't care what chorus she
  kicks in, marry her and act like a human being again."</p>

  <p>"I can't."</p>

  <p>"Oh. She's already married, eh?"</p>

  <p>Well, I couldn't tell him she didn't exist. I couldn't say I was in love
  with a vision, a dream, an ideal. He thought I was a little crazy, anyway, so
  I just muttered "Yeah," and didn't argue when he said gruffly: "Then you'll
  get over it. Take a vacation. Take two vacations. You might as well for all
  the good you are around here."</p>

  <p>I didn't leave New York; I lacked the energy. I just mooned around the
  city for a while, avoiding my friends, and dreaming of the impossible beauty
  of the face in the mirror. And by and by the longing to see that vision of
  perfection once more began to become overpowering. I don't suppose anyone
  except me can understand the lure of that memory; the face, you see, had been
  my ideal, my concept of perfection. One sees beautiful woman here and there
  in the world; one falls in love&mdash;but always, no matter how great their
  beauty or how deep one's love, they fall short in some degree of the secret
  vision of the ideal. But not the mirrored face; she was my ideal, and
  therefore, whatever imperfections she might have had in the minds of others,
  in my eyes she had none. None, that is, save the terrible one of being only
  an ideal, and therefore unattainable&mdash;but that is a fault inherent in
  all perfection.</p>

  <p>It was a matter of days before I yielded. Common sense told me it was
  futile, even foolhardy, to gaze again on the vision of perfect desirability.
  I fought against the hunger, but I fought hopelessly, and was not at all
  surprised to find myself one evening rapping on van Manderpootz's door in the
  University Club. He wasn't there; I'd been hoping he wouldn't be, since it
  gave me an excuse to seek him in his laboratory in the Physics Building to
  which I would have dragged him anyway.</p>

  <p>There I found him, writing some sort of notations on the table that held
  the idealizator. "Hello, Dixon," he said. "Did it ever occur to you that the
  ideal university cannot exist? Naturally not, since it must be composed of
  perfect students and perfect educators, in which case the former could have
  nothing to learn and the latter, therefore, nothing to teach."</p>

  <p>What interest had I in the perfect university and its inability to exist?
  My whole being was desolate over the nonexistence of another ideal.
  "Professor," I said tensely, "may I use that&mdash;that thing of yours again?
  I want to&mdash;uh&mdash;see something."</p>

  <p>My voice must have disclosed the situation, for van Manderpootz looked up
  sharply. "So!" he snapped. "So you disregarded my advice! Forget her, I said.
  Forget her because she doesn't exist."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;I can't! Once more, Professor&mdash;only once more!"</p>

  <p>He shrugged, but his blue, metallic eyes were a little softer than usual.
  After all, for some inconceivable reason, he likes me. "Well, Dixon," he
  said, "you're of age and supposed to be of mature intelligence. I tell you
  that this is a very stupid request, and van Manderpootz always knows what
  he's talking about. If you want to stupefy yourself with the, opium of
  impossible dreams, go ahead. This is the last chance you'll have, for
  tomorrow the idealizator of van Manderpootz goes into the Bacon head of Isaak
  there. I shall shift the oscillators so that the psychons, instead of
  becoming light quanta, emerge as an electron flow&mdash;a current which will
  actuate Isaak's vocal apparatus and come out as speech." He paused musingly.
  "Van Manderpootz will bear the voice of the ideal. Of course Isaak can return
  only what psychons he receives from the brain of the operator, but just as
  the image in the mirror, the thoughts will have lost their human impress, and
  the words will be those of an ideal." he perceived that I wasn't listening, I
  suppose. "Go ahead, imbeciles," he grunted.</p>

  <p>I did. The glory that I hungered after flamed slowly into being,
  incredible in loveliness, and somehow, unbelievably, even more beautiful than
  on that other occasion. I know why now; long afterwards, van Manderpootz
  explained that the very fact that I had seen an ideal once before had altered
  my ideal, raised it to a higher level. With that face among my memories, my
  concept of perfection was different than it had been.</p>

  <p>So I gazed and hungered. Readily and instantly the being in the mirror
  responded to my thoughts with smile and movement. When I thought of love, her
  eyes blazed with such tenderness that it seemed as if&mdash;I&mdash;I, Dixon
  Wells&mdash;were part of those pairs who had made the great romances of the
  world, Heloise and Abelard, Tristram and Isolde, Aucassin and Nicolette. It
  was like the thrust of a dagger to feel van Manderpootz shaking me, to hear
  his gruff voice calling, "Out of it! Out of it! Time's up."</p>

  <p>I groaned and dropped my face on my hands. The Professor had been right,
  of course; this insane repetition had only intensified an unfulfillable
  longing, and had made a bad mess ten times as bad. Then I heard him muttering
  behind me. "Strange!" he murmured. "In fact, fantastic. Oedipus&mdash;
  oedipus of the magazine covers and billboards."</p>

  <p>I looked dully around. He was standing behind me, squinting, apparently,
  into the spinning mirror beyond the end of the black tube. "Hub?" I grunted
  wearily.</p>

  <p>"That face," he said. "Very queer. You must have seen her features on a
  hundred magazines, on a thousand billboards, on countless 'vision broadcasts.
  The oedipus complex in a curious form."</p>

  <p>"Eh? Could you see her?"</p>

  <p>"Of course!" he grunted. "Didn't I say a dozen times that the psychons are
  transmuted to perfectly ordinary quanta of visible light? If you could see
  her, why not I?"</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;what about billboards and all?"</p>

  <p>"That face," said the professor slowly. "It's somewhat idealized, of
  course, and certain details are wrong. Her eyes aren't that pallid
  silver-blue you imagined; they're green, sea-green, emerald-colored."</p>

  <p>"What the devil," I asked hoarsely, "are you talking about?"</p>

  <p>"About the face in the mirror. It happens to be, Dixon, a close
  approximation of the features of de Lisle d'Agrion, the Dragon Fly!"</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;she's real? She exists? She lives? She &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wait a moment, Dixon. She's real enough, but in accordance with your
  habit, you're a little late. About twenty-five years too late, I should say.
  She must now be somewhere in the fifties&mdash;let's see&mdash;fifty-three,
  I think. But during your very early childhood, you must have seen her face
  pictured everywhere, de Lisle d'Agrion, the Dragon Fly."</p>

  <p>I could only gulp. That blow was devastating.</p>

  <p>"You see," continued van Manderpootz, "one's ideals are implanted very
  early. That's why you continually fall in love with girls who possess one or
  another features that reminds you of her, her hair, her nose, her mouth, her
  eyes. Very simple, but rather curious."</p>

  <p>"Curious!" I blazed. "Curious, you say! Every time I look into one of your
  damned contraptions I find myself in love with a myth! A girl who's dead, or
  married, or unreal, or turned into an old woman! Curious, eh? Damned funny,
  isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Just a moment," said the professor placidly. "It happens, Dixon, that she
  has a daughter. What's more, Denise resembles her mother. And what's Still
  More, she's arriving in New York next week to study American letters at the
  University here. She writes, you see."</p>

  <p>That was too much for immediate comprehension. "How&mdash;how do you
  know?" I gasped.</p>

  <p>It was one of the few times I have seen the colossal blandness of van
  Manderpootz ruffled. He reddened a trifle, and said slowly, "It also happens,
  Dixon, that many years ago in Amsterdam, Haskel van Manderpootz: and de Lisle
  d'Agrion were&mdash;very friendly&mdash;more than friendly, I might say, but
  for the fact that two such powerful personalities as the Dragon Fly and van
  Manderpootz were always at odds." He frowned. "I was almost her second
  husband. She's had seven, I believe; Denise is the daughter of her
  third."</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;why is she coming here?"</p>

  <p>"Because," he said with dignity, "van Manderpootz is here. I am still a
  friend of de Lisle's." He turned and bent over the complex device on the
  table. "Hand me that wrench," he ordered. "Tonight I dismantle this, and
  tomorrow start reconstructing it for Isaak's head."</p>

  <p>But when, the following week, I rushed eagerly back to van Manderpootz's
  laboratory, the idealizator was still in place. The professor greeted me with
  a humorous twist to what was visible of his bearded mouth. "Yes, it's still
  here," he said, gesturing at the device. "I've decided to build an entirely
  new one for Isaak, and besides, this one has afforded me considerable
  amusement. Furthermore, in the words of Oscar Wilde, who am I to tamper with
  a work of genius. After all, the mechanism is the product of the great van
  Manderpootz."</p>

  <p>He was deliberately tantalizing me. He knew that I hadn't come to hear him
  discourse on Isaak, or even on the incomparable van Manderpootz. Then he
  smiled and softened, and turned to the little inner office adjacent, the room
  where Isaak stood in metal austerity. "Denise!" he called. "Come here."</p>

  <p>I don't know exactly what I expected, but I do know that the breath left
  me as the girl entered. She wasn't exactly my image of the ideal, of course;
  she was perhaps the merest trifle slimmer, and her eyes&mdash;well, they must
  have been much like those of de Lisle d'Agrion, for they were the clearest
  emerald I've ever seen. They were impudently direct eyes, and I could imagine
  why van Manderpootz and the Dragon Fly might have been forever quarreling;
  that was easy to imagine, looking into the eyes of the Dragon Fly's
  daughter.</p>

  <p>Nor was Denise, apparently, quite as femininely modest as my image of
  perfection. She wore the extremely unconcealing costume of the day, which
  covered, I suppose, about as much of her as one of the one-piece swimming
  suits of the middle years of the twentieth century. She gave an impression,
  not so much of fleeting grace as of litheness and supple strength, an air of
  independence, frankness, and&mdash;I say it again&mdash;impudence.</p>

  <p>"Well!" she said coolly as van Manderpootz presented me. "So you're the
  scion of the N.J. Wells Corporation. Every now and then your escapades
  enliven the Paris Sunday supplements. Wasn't it you who snared a million
  dollars in the market so you could ask Whimsy White?"</p>

  <p>I rushed. "That was greatly exaggerated," I said hastily, "and anyway I
  lost it before we&mdash;uh&mdash;before I &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not before you made somewhat of a fool of yourself, I believe," she
  finished sweetly.</p>

  <p>Well, that's the sort she was. If she hadn't been so infernally lovely, if
  she hadn't looked so much like the face in the mirror, I'd have flared up,
  said "Pleased to have met you," and never have seen her again. But I couldn't
  get angry, not when she had the dusky hair, the perfect lips, the saucy nose
  of the being who to me was ideal.</p>

  <p>So I did see her again, and several times again. In fact, I suppose I
  occupied most of her time between the few literary courses she was taking,
  and little by little I began to see that in other respects besides the
  physical she was not so far from my ideal. Beneath her impudence was honesty,
  and frankness, and, despite herself, sweetness, so that even allowing for the
  head-start I'd had, I fell in love pretty hastily. And what's more, I knew
  she was beginning to reciprocate.</p>

  <p>That was the situation when I called for her one noon and took her over to
  van Manderpootz's laboratory. We were to lunch with him at the University
  Club, but we found him occupied in directing some experiment in the big
  laboratory beyond his personal one, untangling some sort of mess that his
  staff had blundered into. So Denise and I wandered back into the smaller
  room, perfectly content to be alone together. I simply could rot feel hungry
  in her presence; just talking to her was enough of a substitute for food.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to be a good writer," she was saying musingly. "Some day, Dick,
  I'm going to be famous."</p>

  <p>Well, everyone knows how correct that prediction was. I agreed with her
  instantly.</p>

  <p>She smiled. "You're nice, Dick," she said. "Very nice."</p>

  <p>"Very?"</p>

  <p>"Very!" she said emphatically. Then her green eyes strayed over to the
  table that held the idealizator. "What crack-brained contraption of Uncle
  Haskel's is that?" she asked.</p>

  <p>I explained, rather inaccurately, I'm afraid, but no ordinary engineer can
  follow the ramifications of a van Manderpootz conception. Nevertheless,
  Denise caught the gist of it and her eyes glowed emerald fire.</p>

  <p>"It's fascinating!" she exclaimed. She rose and moved over to the table.
  "I'm going to try it."</p>

  <p>"Not without the professor, you won't! It might be dangerous."</p>

  <p>That was the wrong thing to say. The green eyes glowed brighter as she
  cast me a whimsical glance. "But I am," she said. "Dick, I'm going to&mdash;
  see my ideal man!" She laughed softly.</p>

  <p>I was panicky. Suppose her ideal turned out tall and dark and powerful,
  instead of short and sandy-haired and a bit&mdash;well, chubby, as I am.
  "No!" I said vehemently. "I won't let you!"</p>

  <p>She laughed again. I suppose she read my consternation, for she said
  softly, "Don't be silly, Dick." She sat down, placed her face against the
  opening of the barrel, and commanded, "Turn it on."</p>

  <p>I couldn't refuse her. I set the mirror whirling, then switched on the
  bank of tubes. Then immediately I stepped behind her, squinting into what was
  visible of the flashing mirror, where a face was forming, slowly&mdash;
  vaguely.</p>

  <p>I thrilled. Surely the hair of the image was sandy. I even fancied now
  that I could trace a resemblance to my own features. Perhaps Denise sensed
  something similar, for she suddenly withdrew her eyes from the tube and
  looked up with a faintly embarrassed flush, a thing most unusual for her.</p>

  <p>"Ideals are dull!" she said. "I want a real thrill. Do you know what I'm
  going to see? I'm going to visualize ideal horror. That's what I'll do. I'm
  going to see absolute horror!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no you're not!" I gasped. "That's a terribly dangerous idea." Off in
  the other room I heard the voice of van Manderpootz, "Dixon!"</p>

  <p>"Dangerous&mdash;bosh!" Denise retorted. "I'm a writer, Dick. All this
  means to me is material. It's just experience, and I want it."</p>

  <p>Van Manderpootz again. "Dixon! Dixon! Come here." I said, "Listen, Denise.
  I'll be right back. Don't try anything until I'm here&mdash;please!"</p>

  <p>I dashed into the big laboratory. Van Manderpootz, was facing a cowed
  group of assistants, quite apparently in extreme awe of the great man.</p>

  <p>"Hah, Dixon!" he rasped. "Tell these fools what an Emmerich valve is, and
  why it won't operate in a free electronic stream. Let 'em see that even an
  ordinary engineer knows that much."</p>

  <p>Well, an ordinary engineer doesn't, but it happened that I did. Not that
  I'm particularly exceptional as an engineer, but I did happen to know that
  because a year or two before I'd done some work on the big tidal turbines up
  in Maine, where they have to use Emmerich valves to guard against electrical
  leakage from the tremendous potentials in their condensers. So I started
  explaining, and van Manderpootz kept interpolating sarcasms about his staff,
  and when I finally finished, I suppose I'd been in there about half an hour.
  And then&mdash;I remembered Denise!</p>

  <p>I left van Manderpootz staring as I rushed back, and sure enough, there
  was the girl with her face pressed against the barrel, and her hands gripping
  the table edge. Her features were hidden, of course, but there was something
  about her strained position, her white knuckles&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Denise!" I yelled. "Are you all right? Denise!"</p>

  <p>She didn't move. I stuck my face in between the mirror and the end of the
  barrel and peered up the tube at her visage, and what I saw left me all but
  stunned. Have you ever seen stark, mad, infinite terror on a human face? That
  was what I saw in Denise's&mdash;inexpressible, unbearable horror, worse than
  the fear of death could ever be. Her green eyes were widened so that the
  whites showed around them; her perfect lips were contorted, her whole face
  strained into a mask of sheer terror.</p>

  <p>I rushed for the switch, but in passing I caught a single glimpse of
  &mdash;of what showed in the mirror. Incredible! Obscene, terror-laden,
  horrifying things&mdash;there just aren't words for them. There are no
  words.</p>

  <p>Denise didn't move as the tubes darkened. I raised her face from the
  barrel and when she glimpsed me she moved. She flung herself out of that
  chair and away, facing me with such mad terror that I halted.</p>

  <p>"Denise!" I cried. "It's just Dick. Look, Denise!"</p>

  <p>But as I moved toward her, she uttered a choking scream, her eyes dulled,
  her knees gave, and she fainted. Whatever she had seen, it must have been
  appalling to the uttermost, for Denise was not the sort to faint.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It was a week later that I sat facing van Manderpootz in
his little inner
  office. The grey metal figure of Isaak was missing, and the table that had
  held the idealizator was empty.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said van Manderpootz. "I've dismantled it. One of van Manderpootz's
  few mistakes was to leave it around where a pair of incompetents like you and
  Denise could get to it. It seems that I continually overestimate the
  intelligence of others. I suppose I tend to judge them by the brain of van
  Manderpootz."</p>

  <p>I said nothing. I was thoroughly disheartened and depressed, and whatever
  the professor said about my lack of intelligence, I felt it justified.</p>

  <p>"Hereafter," resumed van Manderpootz, "I shall credit nobody except myself
  with intelligence, and will doubtless be much more nearly correct." He waved
  a hand at Isaak's vacant corner. "Not even the Bacon head," he continued.
  "I've abandoned that project, because, when you come right down to it, what
  need has the world of a mechanical brain when it already has that of van
  Manderpootz?"</p>

  <p>"Professor," I burst out suddenly, "why won't they let me see Denise? I've
  been at the hospital every day, and they let me into her room just once
  &mdash;just once, and that, time she went right into a fit of hysterics. Why?
  Is she&mdash;?" I gulped.</p>

  <p>"She's recovering nicely, Dixon."</p>

  <p>"Then why can't I see her?"</p>

  <p>"Well," said van Manderpootz placidly, "it's like this. You see, when you
  rushed into the laboratory there, you made the mistake of pushing your face
  in front of the barrel. She saw your features right in the midst of all those
  horrors she had called up. Do you see? From then on your face was associated
  in her mind with the whole hell's brew in the mirror. She can't even look at
  you without seeing all of it again."</p>

  <p>"Good&mdash;God!" I gasped. "But she'll get over it, won't she? She'll
  forget that part of it?"</p>

  <p>"The young psychiatrist who attends her&mdash;a bright chap, by the way,
  with a number of my own ideas&mdash;believes she'll be quite over it in a
  couple of months. But personally, Dixon, I don't think she'll ever welcome
  the sight of your face, though I myself have seen uglier visages somewhere or
  other."</p>

  <p>I ignored that. "Lord!" I groaned. "What a mess!" I rose to depart, and
  then&mdash;then I knew what inspiration means! "Listen!" I said, spinning
  back. "Listen, professor Why can't you get her back here and let her
  visualize the ideally beautiful? And then stick my face into that" Enthusiasm
  grew. "It can't fail!" I cried. "At the worst, it'll cancel that other
  memory. It's marvelous!"</p>

  <p>"But as usual," said van Manderpootz, "a little late."</p>

  <p>"Late? Why? You can put up your idealizator again. You'd do that much,
  wouldn't you?"</p>

  <p>"Van Manderpootz," he observed, "is the very soul of generosity. I'd do it
  gladly, but it's still a little late, Dixon. You see, she married the bright
  young psychiatrist this noon."</p>

  <p>Well, I've a date with Tips Alva tonight, and I'm going to be late for it,
  just as late as I please. And then I'm going to do nothing but stare at her
  lips all evening.</p>
