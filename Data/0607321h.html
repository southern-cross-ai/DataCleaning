<p class="first">"LANDLORD, ho!" The shout broke the lowering
silence and reverberated through the black forest with sinister
echoing.</p>

<p>"This place hath a forbidding aspect, meseemeth."</p>

<p>Two men stood in front of the forest tavern. The building was
low, long and rambling, built of heavy logs. Its small windows
were heavily barred and the door was closed. Above the door its
sinister sign showed faintly&mdash;a cleft skull.</p>

<p>This door swung slowly open and a bearded face peered out. The
owner of the face stepped back and motioned his guests to
enter&mdash;with a grudging gesture it seemed. A candle gleamed
on a table; a flame smoldered in the fireplace.</p>

<p>"Your names?"</p>

<p>"Solomon Kane," said the taller man briefly.</p>

<p>"Gaston l'Armon," the other spoke curtly. "But what is that to
you?"</p>

<p>"Strangers are few in the Black Forest," grunted the host,
"bandits many. Sit at yonder table and I will bring food."</p>

<p>The two men sat down, with the bearing of men who have
traveled far. One was a tall gaunt man, clad in a featherless hat
and somber black garments, which set off the dark pallor of his
forbidding face. The other was of a different type entirely,
bedecked with lace and plumes, although his finery was somewhat
stained from travel. He was handsome in a bold way, and his
restless eyes shifted from side to side, never still an
instant.</p>

<p>The host brought wine and food to the rough-hewn table and
then stood back in the shadows, like a somber image. His
features, now receding into vagueness, now luridly etched in the
firelight as it leaped and flickered, were masked in a beard
which seemed almost animal-like in thickness. A great nose curved
above this beard and two small red eyes stared unblinkingly at
his guests.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" suddenly asked the younger man.</p>

<p>"I am the host of the Cleft Skull Tavern," sullenly replied
the other. His tone seemed to challenge his questioner to ask
further.</p>

<p>"Do you have many guests?" l'Armon pursued.</p>

<p>"Few come twice," the host grunted.</p>

<p>Kane started and glanced up straight into those small red
eyes, as if he sought for some hidden meaning in the host's
words. The flaming eyes seemed to dilate, then dropped sullenly
before the Englishman's cold stare.</p>

<p>"I'm for bed," said Kane abruptly, bringing his meal to a
close. "I must take up my journey by daylight."</p>

<p>"And I," added the Frenchman. "Host, show us to our
chambers."</p>

<p><br>
BLACK shadows wavered on the walls as the two followed their
silent host down a long, dark hall. The stocky, broad body of
their guide seemed to grow and expand in the light of the small
candle which he carried, throwing a long, grim shadow behind
him.</p>

<p>At a certain door he halted, indicating that they were to
sleep there. They entered; the host lit a candle with the one he
carried, then lurched back the way he had come.</p>

<p>In the chamber the two men glanced at each other. The only
furnishings of the room were a couple of bunks, a chair or two
and a heavy table.</p>

<p>"Let us see if there be any way to make fast the door," said
Kane. "I like not the looks of mine host."</p>

<p>"There are racks on door and jamb for a bar," said Gaston,
"but no bar."</p>

<p>"We might break up the table and use its pieces for a bar,"
mused Kane.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>," said l'Armon, "you are timorous,
<i>m'sieu</i>."</p>

<p>Kane scowled. "I like not being murdered in my sleep," he
answered gruffly.</p>

<p>"My faith!" the Frenchman laughed. "We are chance
met&mdash;until I overtook you on the forest road an hour before
sunset, we had never seen each other."</p>

<p>"I have seen you somewhere before," answered Kane, "though I
can not now recall where. As for the other, I assume every man is
an honest fellow until he shows me he is a rogue; moreover, I am
a light sleeper and slumber with a pistol at hand."</p>

<p>The Frenchman laughed again.</p>

<p>"I was wondering how <i>m'sieu</i> could bring himself to
sleep in the room with a stranger! Ha! Ha! All right,
<i>m'sieu</i> Englishman, let us go forth and take a bar from one
of the other rooms."</p>

<p>Taking the candle with them, they went into the corridor.
Utter silence reigned and the small candle twinkled redly and
evilly in the thick darkness.</p>

<p>"Mine host hath neither guests nor servants," muttered Solomon
Kane. "A strange tavern! What is the name, now? These German
words come not easily to me &mdash;the Cleft Skull? A bloody
name, i'faith."</p>

<p>They tried the rooms next to theirs, but no bar rewarded their
search. At last they came to the last room at the end of the
corridor. They entered. It was furnished like the rest, except
that the door was provided with a small barred opening, and
fastened from the outside with a heavy bolt, which was secured at
one end to the door-jamb. They raised the bolt and looked in.</p>

<p>"There should be an outer window, but there is not," muttered
Kane. "Look!"</p>

<p>The floor was stained darkly. The walls and the one bunk were
hacked in places, great splinters having been torn away.</p>

<p>"Men have died in here," said Kane, somberly. "Is yonder not a
bar fixed in the wall?"</p>

<p>"Aye, but 'tis made fast," said the Frenchman, tugging at it.
"The&mdash;"</p>

<p>A section of the wall swung back and Gaston gave a quick
exclamation. A small, secret room was revealed, and the two men
bent over the grisly thing that lay upon its floor.</p>

<p>"The skeleton of a man!" said Gaston. "And behold, how his
bony leg is shackled to the floor! He was imprisoned here and
died."</p>

<p>"Nay," said Kane, "the skull is cleft&mdash;methinks mine host
had a grim reason for the name of his hellish tavern. This man,
like us, was no doubt a wanderer who fell into the fiend's
hands."</p>

<p>"Likely," said Gaston without interest; he was engaged in idly
working the great iron ring from the skeleton's leg bones.
Failing in this, he drew his sword and with an exhibition of
remarkable strength cut the chain which joined the ring on the
leg to a ring set deep in the log floor.</p>

<p>"Why should he shackle a skeleton to the floor?" mused the
Frenchman. "<i>Monbleu!</i> 'Tis a waste of good chain. Now,
<i>m'sieu</i>," he ironically addressed the white heap of bones,
"I have freed you and you may go where you like!"</p>

<p>"Have done!" Kane's voice was deep. "No good will come of
mocking the dead."</p>

<p>"The dead should defend themselves," laughed l'Armon.
"Somehow, I will slay the man who kills me, though my corpse
climb up forty fathoms of ocean to do it."</p>

<p><br>
KANE turned toward the outer door, closing the door of the
secret room behind him. He liked not this talk which smacked of
demonry and witchcraft; and he was in haste to face the host with
the charge of his guilt.</p>

<p>As he turned, with his back to the Frenchman, he felt the
touch of cold steel against his neck and knew that a pistol
muzzle was pressed close beneath the base of his brain.</p>

<p>"Move not, <i>m'sieu</i>!" The voice was low and silky. "Move
not, or I will scatter your few brains over the room."</p>

<p>The Puritan, raging inwardly, stood with his hands in air
while l'Armon slipped his pistols and sword from their
sheaths.</p>

<p>"Now you can turn," said Gaston, stepping back.</p>

<p>Kane bent a grim eye on the dapper fellow, who stood
bareheaded now, hat in one hand, the other hand leveling his long
pistol.</p>

<p>"Gaston the Butcher!" said the Englishman somberly. "Fool that
I was to trust a Frenchman! You range far, murderer! I remember
you now, with that cursed great hat off&mdash;I saw you in Calais
some years agone."</p>

<p>"Aye&mdash;and now you will see me never again. What was
that?"</p>

<p>"Rats exploring yon skeleton," said Kane, watching the bandit
like a hawk, waiting for a single slight wavering of that black
gun muzzle. "The sound was of the rattle of bones."</p>

<p>"Like enough," returned the other. "Now, <i>M'sieu</i> Kane, I
know you carry considerable money on your person. I had thought
to wait until you slept and then slay you, but the opportunity
presented itself and I took it. You trick easily."</p>

<p>"I had little thought that I should fear a man with whom I had
broken bread," said Kane, a deep timbre of slow fury sounding in
his voice.</p>

<p>The bandit laughed cynically. His eyes narrowed as he began to
back slowly toward the outer door. Kane's sinews tensed
involuntarily; he gathered himself like a giant wolf about to
launch himself in a death leap, but Gaston's hand was like a rock
and the pistol never trembled.</p>

<p>"We will have no death plunges after the shot," said Gaston.
"Stand still, <i>m'sieu</i>; I have seen men killed by dying men,
and I wish to have distance enough between us to preclude that
possibility. My faith&mdash;I will shoot, you will roar and
charge, but you will die before you reach me with your bare
hands. And mine host will have another skeleton in his secret
niche. That is, if I do not kill him myself. The fool knows me
not nor I him, moreover&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Frenchman was in the doorway now, sighting along the
barrel. The candle, which had been stuck in a niche on the wall,
shed a weird and flickering light which did not extend past the
doorway. And with the suddenness of death, from the darkness
behind Gaston's back, a broad, vague form rose up and a gleaming
blade swept down. The Frenchman went to his knees like a
butchered ox, his brains spilling from his cleft skull. Above him
towered the figure of the host, a wild and terrible spectacle,
still holding the hanger with which he had slain the bandit.</p>

<p>"Ho! ho!" he roared. "Back!"</p>

<p>Kane had leaped forward as Gaston fell, but the host thrust
into his very face a long pistol which he held in his left
hand.</p>

<p>"Back!" he repeated in a tigerish roar, and Kane retreated
from the menacing weapon and the insanity in the red eyes.</p>

<p>The Englishman stood silent, his flesh crawling as he sensed a
deeper and more hideous threat than the Frenchman had offered.
There was something inhuman about this man, who now swayed to and
fro like some great forest beast while his mirthless laughter
boomed out again.</p>

<p>"Gaston the Butcher!" he shouted, kicking the corpse at his
feet. "Ho! ho! My fine brigand will hunt no more! I had heard of
this fool who roamed the Black Forest&mdash;he wished gold and he
found death! Now your gold shall be mine; and more than
gold&mdash;vengeance!"</p>

<p>"I am no foe of yours," Kane spoke calmly.</p>

<p>"All men are my foes! Look&mdash;the marks on my wrists!
See&mdash; the marks on my ankles! And deep in my back&mdash;the
kiss of the knout! And deep in my brain, the wounds of the years
of the cold, silent cells where I lay as punishment for a crime I
never committed!" The voice broke in a hideous, grotesque
sob.</p>

<p>Kane made no answer. This man was not the first he had seen
whose brain had shattered amid the horrors of the terrible
Continental prisons.</p>

<p>"But I escaped!" the scream rose triumphantly. "And here I
make war on all men... What was that?"</p>

<p>Did Kane see a flash of fear in those hideous eyes?</p>

<p>"My sorcerer is rattling his bones!" whispered the host, then
laughed wildly. "Dying, he swore his very bones would weave a net
of death for me. I shackled his corpse to the floor, and now,
deep in the night, I hear his bare skeleton clash and rattle as
he seeks to be free, and I laugh, I laugh! Ho! ho! How he yearns
to rise and stalk like old King Death along these dark corridors
when I sleep, to slay me in my bed!"</p>

<p>Suddenly the insane eyes flared hideously: "You were in that
secret room, you and this dead fool! Did he talk to you?"</p>

<p>Kane shuddered in spite of himself. Was it insanity or did he
actually hear the faint rattle of bones, as if the skeleton had
moved slightly? Kane shrugged his shoulders; rats will even tug
at dusty bones.</p>

<p>The host was laughing again. He sidled around Kane, keeping
the Englishman always covered, and with his free hand opened the
door. All was darkness within, so that Kane could not even see
the glimmer of the bones on the floor.</p>

<p>"All men are my foes!" mumbled the host, in the incoherent
manner of the insane. "Why should I spare any man? Who lifted a
hand to my aid when I lay for years in the vile dungeons of
Karlsruhe&mdash;and for a deed never proven? Something happened
to my brain, then. I became as a wolf&mdash;a brother to these of
the Black Forest to which I fled when I escaped.</p>

<p>"They have feasted, my brothers, on all who lay in my
tavern&mdash;all except this one who now clashes his bones, this
magician from Russia. Lest he come stalking back through the
black shadows when night is over the world, and slay me&mdash;for
who may slay the dead?&mdash;I stripped his bones and shackled
him. His sorcery was not powerful enough to save him from me, but
all men know that a dead magician is more evil than a living one.
Move not, Englishman! Your bones I shall leave in this secret
room beside this one, to&mdash;"</p>

<p>The maniac was standing partly in the doorway of the secret
room, now, his weapon still menacing Kane. Suddenly he seemed to
topple backward, and vanished in the darkness; and at the same
instant a vagrant gust of wind swept down the outer corridor and
slammed the door shut behind him. The candle on the wall
flickered and went out. Kane's groping hands, sweeping over the
floor, found a pistol, and he straightened, facing the door where
the maniac had vanished. He stood in the utter darkness, his
blood freezing, while a hideous muffled screaming came from the
secret room, intermingled with the dry, grisly rattle of
fleshless bones. Then silence fell.</p>

<p>Kane found flint and steel and lighted the candle. Then,
holding it in one hand and the pistol in the other, he opened the
secret door.</p>

<p>"Great God!" he muttered as cold sweat formed on his body.
"This thing is beyond all reason, yet with mine own eyes I see
it! Two vows have here been kept, for Gaston the Butcher swore
that even in death he would avenge his slaying, and his was the
hand which set yon fleshless monster free. And he&mdash;"</p>

<p>The host of the Cleft Skull lay lifeless on the floor of the
secret room, his bestial face set in lines of terrible fear; and
deep in his broken neck were sunk the bare fingerbones of the
sorcerer's skeleton.</p>
