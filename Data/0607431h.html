<h3>Chapter I.</h3>

<p>The long silence which I have observed, must have led my friends
to conclude that I had relinquished all my European connexions,--that
from some untoward accident, or the natural visitation of Providence,
they would never hear from me more;--but that not being the case;
after assuring them that it merely proceeded from the multiplicity of
business, and the unceasing vigilance my situation demanded, I shall
without farther preface resume my narrative.</p>

<p>The government of this colony now devolved upon Francis Grose,
Esquire, Commandant of the New South Wales Corps. He immediately
superseded the civil power at Parramatta by the military, and all
complaints in future were to be preferred to the military officer on
duty there. Hitherto the magistracy regulated all differences, and
punished such offences as required immediate cognizance on the spot;
reporting his proceedings, from time to time, to the governor; and
every order emanating from his excellency, respecting the regulation
of the convicts, was promulgated through the same channel.</p>

<p>At Sydney, similar regulations took place, and all reference to
the civil magistrate was in future to be dispensed with. It had been
usual with the magistrates to hold a kind of court weekly, or as
often as occasion might require; and to inflict such punishment as
they deemed proportionate to the offence, always reporting their
proceedings, as before stated.</p>

<p>At this time the magistracy consisted of the Lieutenant Governor
and the Judge Advocate, who were justices of the peace in virtue of
their commissions; the Reverend Mr. Johnston, Augustus Alt, and
Richard Atkins, Esquires, who had been sworn in as magistrates by
governor Philip.</p>

<p>No inconvenience having arisen from the former mode of dispensing
justice, the cause of the change cannot be easily accounted for;
unless it were that prediliction military governors generally
possess, of concentrating all the power in their own hands.</p>

<p>Governor Philip had gratuitously distributed among the settlers,
stock of various kinds, for the purpose of breeding; but he was
scarce out of sight of the settlement when the greater part was
brought to market; when, had not the officers purchased the whole,
his benevolent intentions would have been frustrated, by the greater
part being prematurely consigned to the pot or the spit.</p>

<p>New regulations now took place in the working hours of the
convicts,--the time of labour was fixed from five in the morning
'till nine, and then rested until four, when they resumed their work,
which terminated at sunset. This was a very salutary alteration, as
they not only avoided the scorching ray of the noon-day sun, but had
an opportunity of earning a title for themselves, at their respective
trades.</p>

<p>About this time a very serious calamity befel the settlement, the
weather was excessive sultry, and the grass having been set on fire
by the natives raged on all sides, whereby several of the gardens
were destroyed, and I was in the utmost jeopardy of losing my little
all.--The progress of the fire, by the efforts of the settlers at
Parramatta and its neighbourhood, being checked, and nearly
extinguished, but a spark lodging among the thatch of a house on the
adjoining farm soon spread out into a blaze, and consumed the same,
out houses &amp; c. and it was only by the greatest exertions it was
prevented from communicating to my premises.</p>

<p>From the arrival of several American Vessels, New England Rum now
began to circulate in considerable quantities, the baneful effects of
which were soon conspicuous, in the frequent intoxication of the
convicts.--The fondness they evinced for this deleterious liquor was
incredible; they would run any hazard to procure it, and preferred
receiving it as the price of their labour, to any other article,
either of provisions or cloathing.</p>

<p>To remedy this evil, the governor issued an order, wherein he
stated that if it ever appeared that a convict was possessed of
liquor, supplied by the commissaries, that he should consider them as
responsible for any irregularities that might happen in consequence
of such injudicious and reprehensible conduct.</p>

<p>A deplorable instance of the mischevous effects of inebriety now
happened, Elenor Mc Cave, wife of Charles Williams, a settler, one of
my neighbours, with an infant; and a Mrs. Green, was drowned
returning to Parramatta from Sydney, where they had been spending the
day, drinking and revelling; it blowing fresh the boat heeled
considerably, and the woman, Green, getting up suddenly to move a bag
of rice to windward, to prevent its getting wet, the boat upset, and
the two women and child were drowned: the child was snatched from the
mother's hold, who was sinking with it, and brought on shore, but for
want of proper aid expired.--The father and mother of this child were
notorious in the colony for their loose behaviour; previous to their
leaving Sydney they had been wrangling and fighting with each other,
and the woman wished every evil might befal her and the infant in her
womb (she was six months gone with child) if she went home with her
husband--the bodies were found soon after, and Williams buried his
wife and child before his own door. This mournful event made not the
least impression on this hardened character; for a few days after he
had thus buried his wife, he was seen sitting at his door, with a
bottle of rum in his hand, and actually drinking one glass himself,
and pouring the next over her grave, till it was emptied: saying at
every glass "there's your share my old girl," concluding with, "the
devil's in it if you won't be quiet now."</p>

<p>Being upon duty, looking out for some of the stragglers, I fell in
with one Gray, who had been very notorious for his villainies, and
who had eluded the vigilance of the Magistrates at Sydney; I
presented my piece and threatned to shoot him if he did not
immediately march before me to the settlement, which he did very
quietly, and having disposed of him securely for the night, sent him
the next morning under a proper escort down to Sydney.</p>

<p>He had formerly been sent to Norfolk Island for several crimes he
had committed, and, the term of his sentence being expired, had
returned here as a free man; he had hired himself as a servant to one
of the New South Wales Corps; one who by great industry and the most
rigid economy had scraped up between thirty and forty pounds; but
having most indiscreetly made this fellow acquainted with his riches,
and also where he kept them, the natural propensity to stealing
reigning paramount in this gentleman's constitution, he made no
scruple of moving off with the whole sum and several other articles
which lay in his way. When upon his trial, he very readily admitted
the fact, and on being urged to restore the property, he mentioned a
spot where he said he had secured it, but those that were sent not
being able to find it, he was conducted to the place himself, when,
accidentally meeting the Lieutenant Governor by the way, in order to
interest his humanity in his favor, he threw himself on the ground,
counterfeiting the most terrible convulsions, but his artifice was
too shallow,--he was instantly tied up and punished with 100 lashes.
After this he would not make any discovery, and as there was no
direct evidence against him, he was sent to the Hospital, and soon
after discharged.</p>

<p>Yeariana had now become, as it were, a part of my family, seldom
spending a day in a week with her old friends; Batchery could not be
persuaded on any account to leave the farm, and as he began to jabber
a little English I found him very useful. My domestic concerns were
now assuming a very promising aspect, when they were suddenly
deranged by an adventure in which Palerino, the brother of Yeariano,
was the principal personage.</p>

<p>Palerino had been with me at the farm, and in the afternoon I had
persuaded him to take a tiff of weak punch, which I had made to
alleviate my thirst, it being a very sultry day;--the beverage
pleased him, and he made repeated applications to the jug till he
fairly finished its contents. This unusual drink soon operated upon
him, causing his eyes to sparkle, and he became quite merry and
frolicksome: the punch being made weak, did not produce on him any
disagreeable effect.</p>

<p>He took his leave about an hour before sunset, and had proceeded
nearly half-way, when he fell in with a party of the tribe of
Tugegal, who were wrangling, and appeared ready to go to loggerheads.
Palerino recognised among them one of his most intimate friends, and
at the same instant saw him knocked down with a club by one of the
party;--exhilerated with what he had drank, Palerino flew upon the
aggressor like a tyger, and wresting the club from him struck him to
the ground, the blow falling on the temple, and being a very violent
one, proved his immediate death. The rest of the party not being of
kin to the deceased took no part in the fray. They bore off the body
on their shoulders, leaving the termination of the affair to be
settled by his relations.</p>

<p>Palerino very soon perceived the dangerous situation which his
intemperate zeal had hurried him into, and on his return home
apprized the family of what had happened.</p>

<p>The very high sense of honour inherent in these people, prevented
Palerino from endeavouring to evade the enquiries that were made
after him by the friends of the deceased,--he promised to be ready to
surrender himself into their hands, and accordingly a day was
appointed for retribution.</p>

<p>It is a custom among them that when one kills another of a
different tribe, if they are on friendly terms,--whosoever should be
the offender--to surrender him up to the party aggrieved; and he is
destined to be speared to death, as an expiatory sacrifice to the
manes of their murdered friend.</p>

<p>The news of this rencounter reaching the farm by means of
Batcherry, plunged Yeariano in the deepest distress; she well knew
that her brother's life would be the forfeit of his indiscretion;
and, notwithstanding my utmost entreaties, and endeavours to soothe
her, she forced herself from my arms, and quitting my habitation,
took the road to Paculbenah, the residence of her tribe, with such
speed that it was impossible to overtake her.</p>

<p>In a state of the most disagreeable and painful incertitude I
remained for about ten days, my business of Peace Officer requiring
my constant attendance, I could not leave the district without
express permission or upon duty; the disorderly and riotous behaviour
of the convicts in general rendering it absolutely necessary to keep
a strict and continual watch upon their conduct.</p>

<p>I was relieved from this suspence by Batchery, from whose
countenance I conjectured that nothing very terrible had happened, I
asked where his sister was, he smiled, and said "you forget poor
Palerino--tho he be very well too" then said I "Yeariana is well?"
"ees, ees, very well, she be here presently," and before I had time
to ask any more questions, a gentle tap made me look round, when my
eyes met those of the lovely girl, beaming with love, satisfaction
and joy. She made me understand that her brother had been happily
extricated from the perilous situation which his late adventure had
brought him into.</p>

<p>It seems that the young native in whose defence Palerino had
stepped forward, was the favorite Son of the Chief; and was beloved
and highly respected by the whole tribe. The evening of the day that
Palerino was to expiate his offence with his life, the two tribes
collected together, and proceeded to Pannerong (signifying the field
of blood) where they spent the night in feasting and dancing; nor did
the devoted victim appear as though the next morning was to be the
last of his existence, but seemed as unconcerned and conducted
himself with as much ease and cheerfulness as any of the company.</p>

<p>A little before sunrise the ceremony began, and forming themselves
into a long square, Palerino, attended by two of his own tribe,
deliberately and with a firm step walked to the center, where he was
met by Warennee, and his father, the chief, who took Palerino by the
hand, and told him that as it was a single blow which occasioned the
death of Oroodeo, unaccompanied by any other violence, they should
consider it as an accident, and that too occasioned by the brutish
and ill behaviour of the deceased;--that the custom of his being
exposed to the spears of the relations must be complied with, but on
account of the circumstances before set forth, it had been agreed
that he should be indulged with a shield, when they should see
whether he was as skillful in acting on the defensive, as he was bold
and powerful in the attack--he then gave him his own shield, and
withdrew on one side.</p>

<p>The throwing now began at forty paces distant; the agility and
dexterity with which he avoided their aim were loudly extolled by the
spectators; when an accident put an end to the contest and relieved
Palerino from his dangerous situation;--one of a different tribe
being present, was very busy picking up and returning the spears, and
being off his guard, was killed on the spot by a random spear--a
general shout ensued, and the ceremony was ended, without Palerino
receiving a single hurt;--the blood thus accidentally shed was
considered as sufficient; altho it was more than probable that
whenever his tribe got intelligence of the event, it would occasion a
more serious meeting.</p>

<p>Palerino was conducted home, amidst the caresses of both tribes,
and the friendship which had for some time subsisted between them was
now strongly cemented, by the chief giving him his beautiful
daughter, Oteniate, for his wife. The young folks had been no
strangers to each other, and were mutually pleased.</p>

<p>The happy winding-up of this tragical business was very gratifying
to all the settlers here about; as Palerino was a great favorite, and
always ready to oblige them, frequently as a guide, for three or four
days together, so that his loss would have been much regretted.</p>

<p>Some settlers having arrived in transports were allotted a tract
of land at the upper part of the harbour, and being free people, the
spot was christened by the name of Liberty Plains.</p>

<h3>Chapter II.</h3>

<p>Two Spanish Ships, upon a voyage of discovery, came into the
harbour, called the Discovery and the Intrepid, the former wore the
broad pendant of a Commodore. They had been three years and a half
from Europe, and had ran down the coast of South America, visiting
all the Spanish possessions, and precisely ascertaining their
boundaries, and situations, whereby they had gained much
information.</p>

<p>An officer belonging to them having walked up to Parramatta, I had
the honor of dining with him; he was of Irish extraction, and spoke
English as his mother tongue; he was a well informed man, and his
conversation eagerly listened too. The afternoon was spent with great
hilarity, nor did we break up till near midnight, so much were the
company charmed with the information, and pleasant manners of this
accomplished stranger.</p>

<p>A depredation was discovered to have been made upon the stores,
and was carried on in the following manner; two convicts had been
employed in issuing the provisions under the storekeeper; they had
contrived usually to give an extra allowance to two or three messes,
each mess consisting of six people, during the absence of the
storekeeper, which often happened while they were serving; when one
of each of the mess who were in the league with those who served,
took their allowance and hurried off with it;--on the return of the
storekeeper the man serving out, call'd the messes over again which
had been already served, and they received a second time their
allowance, this plot was at last divulged by one of the wives of the
party when she was in liquor.</p>

<p>On the examination of the parties it came out that this practice
had been pursued for some months, and the different persons concerned
being apprehended twere all severely punished by order of the
Lieutenant Governor.</p>

<p>A quarrel happening at the hut a of female convict between Abraham
Gordon and Richard Sutton; being both very much inflamed with liquor,
Sutton was stabbed in the Belly, and otherwise dangerously wounded;
Gordon was instantly apprehended; some people were also taken up at
Parramatta on suspicion of nightly depredations, also of having
killed one of the watchmen belonging to the settlement; the
circumstances of which one of them had been overheard relating to a
fellow convict; but after much investigation nothing could be brought
home to them and they were accordingly discharged.</p>

<p>A soldier who had been sentenced three hundred lashes, on being
led out to receive his punishment, attempted to cut his throat, and
actually wounded himself pretty deeply under the ear with a knife.
The punishment was put off 'till the Evening, when he avowed that he
was the person who killed the watchman, and that he would point out
the spot where he had secreted the body--This not preventing him from
receiving as much of the punishment as he could bear; he afterwards
declared that he knew nothing of the murder, and that he only accused
himself merely in the hope of deferring his punishment.</p>

<p>Crimes now began to multiply fast upon our hands, On Saturday the
24th. of May, a settler had been drinking at the house of Williams,
with Rose Burke, a woman with whom he lived, until they were very
much intoxicated, and as they were returning to his farm through the
town of Parramatta, a violent quarrel arose between them; when his
musquet went off by accident, and shattered the bones of her right
arm below the elbow so dreadfully that instant amputation was
necessary, which Mr. Arndel the Surgeon being fortunately at home
directly performed.</p>

<p>The new grants since the departure of governor Philip amounted to
nearly two thousand acres, one half of which lay between Sydney and
Parramatta, it being the design of government to establish a range of
farms so as to connect those settlements as much as possible, which
was a most desirable object to the inhabitants of both.</p>

<p>A dangerous mutiny broke out among the sailors of the Kitty
Transport,--the master had frequently complained of the disorderly
conduct of his people, several of whom had been punished in
consequence; one in particular, Benjamin Williams, had received one
hundred lashes.--This man had procured a gallon of rum from one of
the convicts, whose term of transportation had expired, and had
obtained permission to take his passage home in the Kitty. With this
liquor they were carousing, and being noisy in their cups, disturbed
the master, who instantly rose and went to the forecastle, where he
found them with a candle burning, stuck on the head of an oil cask,
and the men in a state nearly bordering upon intoxication: he ordered
them to put out the light and go to their hammocks, which they
refused; Williams declaring that if he (the master) put it out it
should be lit again--the master stepping forward to extinguish it
himself, they immediately seized hold of him, and dragging him upon
deck actually threw him overboard, before the mate, or any of the
rest of the ship's company could come to his assistance. Fortunately
he could swim very well, and the mate throwing him a rope over the
quarter, he swam to it and got safely on board.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this daring outrage the captain was disposed to
pass it over, and would have inconsiderately put to sea next morning;
but when he ordered them to hoist the top-sails, and prepare to get
the ship under way, Williams stood forward, and declared that she
should not be moved until their complement of hands was on board. The
anchor, however, was got up with the assistance of the passengers,
and colonists, who had a boat along-side, and she gradually dropped
down the harbour.</p>

<p>In the interim the governor being informed of the transactions,
ordered a signal to be made for the Kitty to bring to, and
immediately went on board, being determined by a striking example,
not only to crush the present disorder, but to deter others from
committing similar outrages. He ordered Williams and two others of
the most refractory to be taken on shore, and replaced them with two
convicts of exemplary character, and a seaman, who had been
discharged from the Daedalus: tranquillity and order being restored,
the ship braced about, and stood out to sea with a fair ind.</p>

<p>The mutineers on their landing were conducted to the parade, where
they received, the reward which they richly deserved; Williams two
hundred and fifty, and his companions, being less culpable, one
hundred and fifty lashes each; after which they were delivered over
to the care of an overseer, with strict injunctions that they should
be made to earn the provisions which they consumed.</p>

<p>His majesty's birth day was celebrated with the usual
festivity--three vollies were fired by the regiment on the parade,
and the governor caused twelve of the largest hogs to be slaughtered,
and divided among the people in the hospital and the
convalescents.</p>

<p>Several attempts had been made to import cattle into this colony,
but with very bad success: at this time there had been twelve bulls
and upwards of a hundred cows lost on their passage--of all the
cattle that were landed, two bulls, twenty cows and two calves, were
only living at this period, (June 1793.)--Horses, sheep and hogs were
found to stand the rough weather, generally met in the passage from
the Cape of Good Hope to this country, much better than the horned
cattle.</p>

<p>It is now about three years since the colony experienced a very
serious loss: A convict, entrusted with the grazing, by a strange and
unaccountable neglect, permitted two bulls and four cows to stray
into the woods. He had been strictly enjoined never to lose sight of
them; to this order he had paid little attention; he frequently left
them and went home to his dinner; till at last on his return to the
spot where he had left them, he found that they had quitted it;
distracted with fear of the punishment that awaited him, he remained
in the woods searching for them, till he was absolutely perishing
with hunger, and was found in a most deplorable condition by one of
the parties that had been sent out after him.</p>

<p>After a fruitless search for nearly a fortnight, all hopes of
finding them were despaired of, and it was conjectured that they had
been driven away by the natives: we were afterwards confirmed in this
idea, as some of them declared that they had seen them killed, and
offered to point out the spot where they had deposited the bones: the
place they mentioned being a considerable distance off, the governor
declined any farther search. It was very probable that they had been
destroyed:--if by chance they had escaped, and were yet living, their
numbers must have been considerably increased.</p>

<p>The natives becoming very troublesome, lurking about the different
farms, robbing and wounding the convicts whenever they met them
without arms;--parties of the military were sent out to drive them
from their haunts; yet, notwithstanding, many found means to continue
in the towns, and mix with the inhabitants--it was a common thing to
fee them coming into the town loaded with firewood, which they had
been hired to procure, or bringing water from the tanks; for which
services they thought themselves well paid with a worn-out jacket,
trowsers, pieces of blanket, or a little bread, of which they were
extravagantly fond.</p>

<p>As much inconvenience had been experienced from not having a
church, divine service having been hitherto performed in the open
air, exposed to the ardent rays of a scorching sun, the Reverend Mr.
Johnston, himself, undertook to remove the evil.</p>

<p>Having fixed upon a spot, at the back of the huts, the building
was begun under his own inspection. The front was seventy three feet,
and the depth about forty; it was constructed with strong posts,
entrelaced with wattles, and filled up with plaister; the roof was
thatched, not yet being able to afford tiles for so large a building.
Great praise was due to the truly christian-like benevolence of our
worthy pastor for his personal and unwearied exertions in the
erection of this spacious edifice.</p>

<p>The convicts had never yet relaxed in their attendance on Sundays,
but had not the conduct of the minister endeared himself to the
convicts in general, it would not now have been practicable to
enforce a full audience;--the solicitous attention he individually
bestowed on the whole community continually crowded his new
church.</p>

<p>A plot had lately been discovered which had for its end, the
seizing and carrying off one of the long boats--the ringleaders of
this business were some soldiers, and their plan was to proceed to
Java, a chart of which they had by some means or other procured; had
they succeeded they would (to use a homely proverb) have jumped out
of the frying pan into the fire; for the Dutch are too jealous of
strangers to give them any encouragement, so that in all probability
they would have been reduced to the alternative, either of enlisting
into their service, a sure and certain method of shortening their
days in that premature grave of Europeans, or being kept prisoners
till some English ship should touch there to take them off.</p>

<p>Two of the soldiers were immediately put in confinement; and in
the night two others absconded into the woods with their arms and all
the ammunition they could collect; the two in confinement were
brought to a court martial, one of whom was acquitted; but a drummer,
named Roberts, for endeavouring to persuade another drummer to be of
the party, was sentenced to receive three hundred lashes.</p>

<p>The parties who had been sent after the runaways, by dividing
themselves, soon found out their haunt; they were taken without
opposition, and escorted back to the settlement, and a few days
afterwards they underwent a similar sentence with Roberts.</p>

<p>Some persons had been displaying their ingenuity in the
fabricating of counterfeit Dollars, and many were in circulation, two
of which among others, I was unlucky enough to get for some stock
which I had taken down to Sydney to dispose of. They were ably
executed, and notwithstanding a handsome reward was promised to the
informer, and a strict search after the manufacturer he remained
undiscovered.</p>

<p>About this time a transport from Ireland arrived, with one hundred
and fifty convicts of that country, male and female; a party of the
New South Wales Corps had embarked with them, and it proved a very
salutary precaution; as the spirit of mutiny soon broke out, and they
had the hardihood to attempt taking the Ship, but were happily
frustrated by the vigilance, spirit, and activity of the master and
officers.</p>

<p>Representations having been made to government that the masters of
the transports did not take proper care of the health of the
convicts, when in their charge, they entered into an agreement to pay
the contractors five pounds in addition for every convict that they
should land in a healthy state at the settlement. The propriety, and
salutary effects of this arrangement, were fully evinced, by the
appearance of those lately landed;--each were allowed a hammock and
bed to themselves during the passage, and a New suit of clothes to
land in;--they unanimously gave testimony to the good treatment they
had met with by three cheers to the Captain on going from along side
the Ship.</p>

<h3>Chapter III.</h3>

<p>We now heard of the agitated state of Europe, and of the war
having commenced with the French, and that administration had made
arrangements for our being supplied with cattle from the East Indies,
fearing that in a state of warfare our supplies might be cut off by
the enemy; this precaution gave great satisfaction to the settlement
at large, for the Bengal Sheep though small, were very productive,
breeding twice in the year, and mostly bringing two lambs at a time.
An instance of the remarkable fecundity of a goat happened in the
house of one of the superintendants at Sydney, she produced five
kids, all of which died from a blow she received while in kid: seven
months afterwards she gave birth to four, all of which lived; she was
the most beautiful animal I ever saw.</p>

<p>A ship being about to sail for England, seven persons, whose term
of transportation had expired, were permitted to embark
themselves;--Passages to Europe from hence were procured with the
greatest facility (little more being required than permission to
receive them, and the finding their provisions,) yet it was
frequently the case that convicts secreted themselves on board
without leave, as was the case in this ship; (the Sugar Cane) for the
day she sailed two were sent back who had not obtained their
certificate for which they were punished with fifty lashes each.</p>

<p>The New South Wales Corps was now augmented;--thirty recruits, who
had been selected from among the convicts, bearing good Characters,
and having been formerly soldiers, were permitted to enlist; they
behaved as well as any of the Corps; one of them only excepted, who
was for misbehaviour afterwards discharged, and reduced to his former
situation. A reinforcement of twenty three more was added, which made
up the full complement of convicts that was intended to be admitted
into the Corps. The condition of enlisting was that of their serving
in the regiment till regularly discharged.</p>

<p>Many irregularities and robberies being frequently committed in
and about Parramatta, my post as Peace Officer, became very
troublesome; being obliged to be ever on the watch to suppress
disorders, and apprehend all suspicious and straggling persons who
could not render a good account of themselves.--On the 15th. of
October four people broke into the house of John Randall, one of the
settlers, within a hundred paces from my house, and nearly murdered
two men who lived with him.--The hands and faces of these plunderers
were blackened to avoid detection, and they observed the strictest
silence while they were in the hut, that their voices might not
betray them, they were prevented from robbing the premises by the
spirited resistance they met with. The Irish Convicts, who had taken
to the woods were soon apprehended; they confessed that they had
formed a plan to rob the mill house, the governor's and several
others, and that they were to be visited from time to time in their
concealment, by their associates in the town, who were to supply them
with provisions, and such information as was necessary for their
safety, they also acknowledged that the attack on Randal's house was
committed by them and their associates.</p>

<p>Soon after this the house of Mr Atkins, notwithstanding the
sharpest look out, was broke open, and plundered of a large quantity
of provisions; and a quarter cask of wine was taken from the store,
but left in the garden on their being disturbed; they however carried
off a large booty.</p>

<p>A severe storm of rain and thunder happened on Saturday the 26th.
of October 1793, two Convicts, Dennis Reardon, and William Meredith,
who were employed in cutting wood just without the town, ran to a
tree for shelter in the beginning of the storm, where they were found
next morning lying dead, with a dog that had followed them. There was
little doubt but the shelter which they had sought had proved their
destruction, and that they had been struck dead by the lightning, as
the flashes were observed to have been very vivid, and hovering over
the tree where they were found; the pupils of their eyes appeared
much injured, and their tongues were forced out between their teeth;
their faces were discoloured, as were also several parts of their
bodies; the tree was stripped of its bark from top to bottom, and
some of its branches were torn off. This was the first accident of
the kind that had occurred in the colony, though lightning more
ardent and alarming had often appeared, and storms of a much longer
duration.</p>

<p>Williams the settler, whom I before have had occasion to mention,
wearied of being in a state of independence, sold his farm with the
house crop and stock, for a little less than &pound;100. to an
officer whose ground was contiguous; another settler, anxious to
return to England, followed his example; in consequence they had to
seek employment from others till an opportunity occurred of their
getting a passage home.</p>

<p>A convict of the name of Crow fell in my way as I was out on the
patrol, against whom there were several charges; I accordingly
apprehended him, and saw him safely lodged in the military guard
house at Paramatta, from which, however, he found means to escape,
and, rambling down to Sydney Cove, swam off to a transport in the
harbour, the master of which immediately took him on shore--he
received a slight punishment and was put in the black-hole at Sydney,
out of which he also effected his liberation, by untiling a part of
the roof of his prison, and was not heard of for some time; when he
again fell in my way, between Parramatta and Toongabbe, where he had
been committing fresh depredations, having actually broken open two
houses, considerable property from which was now found upon him.</p>

<p>The frequent commission of capital offences had rendered it
necessary to inflict punishments more likely to prevent the
perpetration of crimes than a mere flogging;--Crow was therefore
delivered over to the civil power, and ordered to be tried by the
criminal court of judicature.--He was accordingly tried on the second
of December, and being clearly convicted, sentence of death was
passed upon him--two others were tried with him, but they were
acquitted, for want of sufficient evidence, although the whole court
were fully assured of their guilt:</p>

<p>Crow was ordered for immediate execution, but petitioning for a
respite it was granted him till the tenth, when he justly forfeited
his life, as an atonement for the depredations he had committed on
society. Just before he suffered he had nearly effected his escape a
third time--with much labour and ingenuity he had displaced some
bricks from the wall, covering the interstices so neatly that they
were scarcely perceptible: being discovered, by the vigilant eye of
the centinel, he next attempted the necessary, but not succeeding
there, his spirits failed him, and he exhibited more weakness and
dismay at the place of execution than was expected from such a
determined character.</p>

<h3>Chapter IV.</h3>

<p>Many Officers now began to avail themselves of the permission
which had been granted them of cultivating land; several of them
fixed at Parramatta and its neighbourhood, whereby I gained a most
valuable acquisition in the friendship and acquaintance of several
gentlemen, who passing over the shade of my past life, deigned to
make me their companion, and I flatter myself my future conduct shall
never put them to the blush for their condescendsion.</p>

<p>They commenced their occupation of farmers in the highest
spirits--Tools and implements for husbandry were furnished by
Government, and they were allowed the labour of ten convicts each, by
which they made great progress; also by the hire of extra hands on
those days that they were not employed for the public; and as they
were not restrained from paying them in liquors, they easily obtained
as many Gangs as they could employ.</p>

<p>The passion for liquor still predominated over every other
consideration, there being nothing which they would not risk to
obtain it: and while spirits were to be had, they would take no other
article in pay for their labour, and which were now sold so high as
Six Shillings a bottle--A Settler near Parramatta having procured a
small still from England, obtained a deleterious and mischievous
spirit from his Wheat, which he found more profitable than carrying
it to the public store, and selling it for ten Shillings per bushell.
From one bushell of wheat he extracted nearly five quarts of spirits,
which he sold, or paid for labour, at the rate of five and six
shillings a bottle: hence proceeded the shocking immorality now
visible in the convicts, hence the frequent robberies, and disorders
in the settlements, and their total disregard to all decency and
neglect of Divine worship--formerly the worthy Pastor had an audience
of two or three hundred; but now, on Christmas day, he preached to
about thirty persons, and the evening produced a watch house full of
prisoners; the greater part in a state of intoxication.</p>

<p>Mr. Mc, Donald, a settler at the field of Mars--a settlement so
called from its being first occupied by men discharged from the
marines--made a different use of the produce of his Farm. Having a
mill he ground and dressed his wheat, which he sold to a baker at
Sydney for four pence the pound; one bushell of wheat producing forty
four pounds of flour--He also killed a weather Sheep, produced from
some that had been given him by Governor Philip, and sold it at two
Shillings per pound, the quarters weighing about fifteen pounds.
Sydney town had considerably increased since the departure of
Governor Philip, not less than one hundred and sixty huts and five
barracks having been added; some of the huts were large and
commodious, and to each of them fifteen hundred bricks were allowed
for a chimney and floor, each hut was twenty six feet in front, and
fourteen in width, and were divided into apartments for ten convicts,
a proportionate spot of garden-ground was reserved for each
building.</p>

<p>About Christmas a large party of the natives attacked some
settlers who were returning from Parramatta to Toongabbe, and took
from them the provisions which they had just received from the
store--They instantly made off into the woods; and though they were
immediately pursued we could not overtake them. They were of the
hunter or woodman's tribe, who were seldom among us, and consequently
very little known. The natives who lived about Sydney placed the
utmost confidence in us, choosing a cleared spot near the town for
the performance of their rites and ceremonies, and for three
successive evenings the town had been amused with one of their
spectacles which might very properly be termed a tragic comedy; for,
though some blood was shed, no lives were lost. It is the custom as
before observed with respect to Palerino, that the person who was the
cause of another's death, was compelled to meet the relations of the
deceased, who were to avenge the death by throwing spears and drawing
blood for blood.--A native of the tribe of Cammerray, a very fine
fellow named Carradah, who had stabbed another in the night, but not
mortally, was obliged to make the amende honourable, by standing two
evenings exposed to the spearing of the relations of the wounded man.
He was indulged with a bark shield, and defended himself with great
skill and resolution, and the first day ended without his receiving a
single wound. But on the next evening, after having exhausted the
patience of his opponents, and remaining unhurt, the wounded man
walked up very composedly to Carradah, who suffered him to pin his
arm to his side with his spear, without the least resistance;
prevented, very probably, by the threatning and uplifted spears of
the other natives, who could easily have destroyed him, by throwing
at him in different directions. Carradah stood for some time after
this, defending himself, although wounded in the arm which held the
shield, until his adversaries had not a spear left, and they retired
to gather up the fragments of the broken spears. The business was
resumed when they had repaired their weapons, it then appeared a
battle Royal, men, women, and children mingled in it, in the course
of which many severe wounds were given and received ere night ended
the warfare. We never could account for this extraordinary contest;
for the utmost cordiality and friendship subsisted between the
different parties who fought each other with all the fury of the most
implacable enemies, and those worsted in the conflict, spoke of their
opponents as brave men, and their friends.</p>

<p>The wounds of the combatants were soon healed, and it was
understood that Carradah had yet another trial to sustain from some
of the natives who had been prevented by absence from joining in the
ceremonies of that evening, Carradah was very intimate in the town,
and had exchanged names with Mr. Ball, who commanded the Supply, he
went after by that name which the natives pronounced Midjer Bool.</p>

<h3>Chapter V.</h3>

<p>Another barrack was now building at Sydney, but for want of the
tiles was not finished; two mill-wrights had also got up the frames
and roofs of two mill-houses, and while they were waiting for the
tiles endeavoured to forward the wood-work; the great want of tiles
proceeded from there being only one person who understood the
moulding them, and he never could burn more than five thousand in a
week, being obliged to burn a great number of bricks in the same
kilns. It required near Seventy thousand bricks to complete the
building of one barrack, and twenty thousand tiles to cover it in--to
furnish bricks for these barracks and other buildings, three gangs
were constantly at work, which comprised three overseers and eighty
convicts--The distance from the brick fields to the barracks was
about three quarters of a mile, three brick carts were employed
conveying these materials, each drawn by twelve men, under the
direction of an overseer--seven hundred tiles, or three hundred and
fifty bricks were a load; and every cart was expected to make five
turns in the day. The bringing in of the timber was also a most
laborious work; There were four timber carriages employed, each drawn
by twenty four men; every carriage was attended by two fellers, and
an overseer[?], making in the whole two hundred and twenty eight men,
exclusive of sawyers, carpenters, smiths, painters, glaziers, and
stone masons; the Provisioning and Clothing all these people must be
very considerable, and will be found to amount to an enormous sum
when the expences of the public works erected in this colony come to
be calculated.</p>

<p>On the 5th, of January 1794. A most atrocious murder was committed
on the body of John Lewis, an elderly man, who was employed to graze
the cattle of Parramatta. The beasts having lost their conductor,
remained all night in the woods; they were found next morning, but no
tidings of Lewis could be got, which caused it to be apprehended that
some accident had happened him. It was some days before his body was
found, and was at last pointed out by the snorting and uneasiness of
the cattle when they came to a particular spot; having been drove out
on purpose by way of experiment. It was laying in a ravine, into
which it had been thrown by the murderers, who had covered it with
logs, branches of trees and grass. Some native dogs allured by the
scent of blood had already been mangling the carcase, which added to
the horrible spectacle it exhibited.</p>

<p>This unfortunate man had imprudently boasted of being worth a sum
of money, and that he always carried it about him, sewed up in his
clothes, in case his hut should be robbed during his absence. By the
number of wounds he had received, he must have defended himself
stoutly, and was certainly overpowered by numbers, being a stout
muscular man;--to discover, if possible, the murderers, several
people of bad characters were apprehended and examined, but nothing
transpired that could attach to any of them, and the enquiry dropped,
with an expectation that the perpetrators would sooner or later be
brought to punishment, and that some riot or disagreement among
themselves would furnish a clue, that would infallibly lead to
detection.</p>

<p>The pernicious vice of gaming which had rapidly obtained in the
settlement, and which was carried on to such excess among the
convicts that many had been known, after losing their provisions,
money, and spare cloathing, to bet, and lose the very clothes from
their backs, exhibiting themselves as naked, and as indifferent about
it, as the natives of the country.--Money was their principal object;
for with it they could purchase spirits, which they greedily coveted.
They have frequently been seen playing at their favourite games of
Cribbage and All Fours, for ten dollars a game, and those who were
ignorant of those games would be content to toss up for dollars,
instead of halfpence. Their meetings were scenes of quarrelling
swearing, and every wickedness that might be expected by a
description of people totally destitute of the least particle of
shame; but glorying in their depravity. To this dreadful vice in a
great measure may be attributed most of the crimes that existed in
the colony.</p>

<p>It was found that the settlers, notwithstanding the plentiful
crops which they generally gathered, gave no assistance to
government, by sending it into store, for which (as before observed)
they were allowed Ten Shillings per Bushel, a very small quantity had
been sent in, and totally inadequate to their wants or expectation.
They seemed ungratefully to prefer any other mode, than what in
justice or gratitude they ought to have pursued; some by
clandestinely brewing and distilling it, others by paying debts
contracted by gambling, as even the farms themselves, were some times
staked, and lost at a game of Hazard.</p>

<p>In this month (January) another division of settlers was
added--Williams and Rouse having squandered away the money for which
they had sold their farms, were permitted, with some others, to
settle on the banks of the Hawksbury, about 24 Miles from Parramatta.
They pitched upon a spot desirably situated with respect to water,
and where it did not require much labour to clear it;--they began
with great alacrity and spirit; and formed very sanguine hopes of
success. At the end of the month they had cleared several acres, and
were in great forwardness with their huts, nor were they in the least
interrupted by the natives--not so in this neighbourhood, where it
might have been supposed that they would have expected such
resistance as they would not have chose to encounter. However, be
that as it may, several settlers about Parramatta had been attacked
by armed parties, and robbed of their clothing and provisions. Many
reports of this kind had been brought into the town, perhaps some of
them might have been fabricated, to conceal the effects of their
gambling--Notwithstanding it was clearly apparent that these people
were ever on the watch, and it was observed that as the corn ripened
they constantly approached nearer the farms and the public grounds,
for the purpose of depredation.</p>

<p>William Crozier Cook, having rendered himself obnoxious to the
law, had absconded into the woods, where not being able to grind the
wheat he had stolen from the store he ate it unground, which upon
drinking a quantity of water fermented in his bowels, and caused a
mortification, and notwithstanding, (on his being obliged from the
excessive torments he endured to crawl into the town) the most
efficacious medicines were administred he soon after expired.</p>

<p>In the beginning of February two Watches which had been missing
were discovered, and taken down to Sydney. Upon investigation it
appeared they had been stolen by John Bevan, who at the time had
broken out of the Prison Hut of Toongabba, a settlement near
Parramatta, and getting down to Sydney committed the theft in
conjunction with Sutton, who had been before tried for a similar
offence; he had returned with the spoil to his hut, before he had
been missed by any of the watchmen.--Playing at cards some time
afterwards with other convicts, he exchanged the watches for a
Nankeen jacket and trowsers.--From this they went from one to the
other till at length they were found in the possession of one Batty,
in the thatch of whose house they were discovered, together with ten
dollars, which were supposed to be part of the money of a man who had
been robbed in the hospital, with whom Bevan had been intimate, and
had won from him an hundred weight of flour which he had almost
starved himself to hoard up--he also inveigled him out of the secret
of his having money, and all the particulars that were necessary to
his design of stealing it.</p>

<p>This information was gained from the people through whose hands
the watches had passed; but it being unsupported by any corroborating
evidence, the court, though thoroughly convinced of his guilt, was
under the necessity of giving him an acquital--Batty and another man,
Normanton, whose guilt was sufficiently proved, received each a
severe punishment.</p>

<h3>Chapter VI.</h3>

<p>In the foregoing part I promised to transmit an account of the
rise and progress of the Colony at Norfolk Island, but have hitherto
been prevented, by the delay occasioned from Mr. Wentworth being so
fully occupied that he had not leisure to write me the particulars at
once, however, from our correspondence I hope I shall be able to
collect a Narrative which I presume will not be uninteresting to the
reader.</p>

<p>Governor Philip, previous to his leaving England, had received
orders to establish a Colony at Norfolk Island as soon as possible
after his arrival in New-South Wales; and to shew that no time was
lost, he dispatched Lieutenant King, of the Sirius, in the Supply,
tender, the middle of February, (not more than a month after his
arrival in the country) investing him with the Offices of
Superintendant and commandant of the Settlement. Mr. King, previous
to his departure for his little government, was sworn in as a justice
of the peace, which enabled him to punish such petty offences as
might be committed among his people--capital crimes being reserved
for the cognizance of the criminal court of judicature, established
at Sydney.</p>

<p>Lieutenant King took with him one Surgeon, one Petty officer, (Mr.
Cunningham) two privates, two persons who pretended to have some
knowledge of flax-dressing, nine male, and six female convicts, with
provisions for six months.</p>

<p>Norfolk Island is situated in 29 degrees South Lattitude, and 168
degrees East Longitude, and was settled with a view to the
cultivation of the Flax-Plant, which at the time it was discovered by
Captain Cook, was found in great abundance, and from specimens taken
to England of the New Zealand Flax, which is of the same kind as that
at Norfolk Island, it was hoped that the mother-country might derive
great advantage from its cultivation.</p>

<p>The Supply arrived at the Island on the 29th. of February, 1788,
but it was five days before any landing could be effected, occasioned
by a surf breaking violently over a reef of rocks, which crossed the
principal bay. Their patience was nearly exhausted, and it was almost
determined to return; judging that a spot so difficult of access was
not the most desirable for a new Settlement; when upon standing in a
little nearer the shore a small opening was perceptible in the reef,
wide enough to admit a boat, through which he and his people landed
with all their provisions and stores in perfect safety.</p>

<p>When landed, they found themselves in an impenetrable wilderness,
and could not discover a clear spot, sufficient to pitch a tent, so
that all hands were immediately set to work in order to clear the
ground for the New Settlement, which Mr. King named Sydney-Bay, he
had also become sponsor to two small islands in the vicinity, one of
which he named Philip, after the Governor, and the other Nepean, in
compliment to the present Secretary to the Admiralty.</p>

<p>In the month of August a transport arrived from Port Jackson,
having on board a midshipman and two seaman of the Sirius, a
serjeant, corporal and a party of marines, also some free settlers
with their families. The utmost regularity and industry were observed
throughout the settlement for a whole year: when the following plan
of an insurrection among the convicts was discovered--They were to
commence their operations by the seizure of Mr. King, which was
intended to be effected on the first Saturday after the arrival of
any ship in the Bay, except the Sirius. Saturday was the day pitched
upon, it being generally, the custom of Mr. King on that day to visit
a farm he had established a small distance from the settlement. He
was accordingly to be surprised and secured in his way to the farm. A
message was then to be sent, in his name, to Mr. Jameison, the
surgeon, to come immediately to the farm, when he was to be secured
directly on his entering the woods;--the serjeant and party were to
be treated in the same manner. These being properly taken care of, a
signal was to be made to the vessel in the Bay, to send her boat on
shore, the crew of which were to be made prisoners on their landing;
when two or three of the revolters were to go off in a boat belonging
to the Island, and inform the commanding officer that the ship's boat
had been stove on the beach, and that the commandant requested that
another might be sent on shore; this also was to be captured, and
then the ship was to be boarded and taken, with which they were to
proceed to Otaheite. We must do them the justice to acknowledge that
they meant to leave some provisions for the commandant and his
officers--This was their scheme, not one difficulty in the execution
whereof had ever occurred to their imagination, and they took it for
granted that all was to succeed as easily as they had planned it, and
had it not happened to be revealed by a female convict, to Mr. King's
gardener, with whom she cohabited, there is no doubt but that this
inconsistent plan would have been put in execution. Upon the
discovery of their villainous intentions every possible precaution
was taken to defeat them. The first step was to clear the ground
round the settlement to such a distance, that the woods should not
conceal any preparations for a future attempt.</p>

<p>On the 26th. of February they were visited by a hurricane in which
several Pine Trees from one hundred and eighty, to two hundred feet,
in length, and from twenty to thirty in the girt, were blown down;
and by noon the gale increased to such violence that Pines and Oaks
were borne down by the fury of the tempest; which tearing up trees
and rocks with them, left chasms of eight and ten feet deep in the
earth: those trees that were not torn up by the roots bent till they
nearly swept the ground with their tops: a large Oak was blown on the
granary, which crushed to pieces, with a number of casks of
flour--and nothing but horror and desolation presented itself.</p>

<p>By the activity of the free people and officers the flour, Indian
corn, and stores were collected and removed to the commandant's
house--a greater number of trees were blown down than could have been
felled by fifty men in a month's labour. In the progress of the
storm, the whole of the bay and great part of the settlement was
covered with water, and the gardens, public and private were totally
destroyed. The island had lately received an increase of inhabitants
so that at this time they mustered sixteen free people; fifty one
male, and twenty three female convicts with four children, who were
all in exceeding good health; a certain sign of the goodness of the
climate.--For the defence of the Island, the free people formed a
Militia, and a guard was mounted every night. The colony still
increasing in numbers, it was thought necessary that they should have
an additional military Force, accordingly in the month of June,
Lieut. Cresswell of the Marines, and fourteen privates arrived from
New South Wales.</p>

<p>The greatest assiduity had been used in repairing the ravages of
the hurricane, and by the month of August the country not only
assumed its former cheerful appearance, but twenty acres of ground
had been cleared and sown on the public account--a store-house was
now erected capable of containing a large quantity of stores, and a
road cut across the Island to Cascade Bay.</p>

<p>The pine trees which were expected to have been a most valuable
acquisition for malts and yards, of large ships, were found wholly
unfit for the purpose; and no use could be yet made of the flax,
owing to the ignorance of the people who had come out as professed
flax dressers. However the affairs of the colonists were in the most
thriving state, and the harvest had returned more than twenty fold,
though they had experienced much dry weather. After the harvest all
the spare hands were employed in palisadoing a piece of ground two
hundred feet, by one hundred and fifty, encircling the house of the
commandant, the public stores, and a military barrack.--This
precaution was very highly necessary to guard against a surprize,
should any further attempts be made by the villainous and
disaffected, many of which description were now on the island.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the year 1790, governor Philip became uneasy
at the non-arrival of supplies from England, as the provisions in
store, at half-allowance to each man in the colony, would not hold
out above four months. They had on their landing a sufficient stock
for two years; that time was now elapsed, and had it not been for the
great care and economy of the governor, the whole colony must have
perished with hunger.</p>

<p>Towards the end of February, no vessels arriving, his excellency
judged it absolutely necessary to divide the settlement: he
accordingly ordered captain Hunter to prepare the Sirius for sea, and
to take on board a number of marines and convicts, and proceed with
them to Norfolk Island where there were many resources, which they
had not at port Jackson.</p>

<p>The Sirius was soon ready, and on the 6th. of March the weighed
anchor, having on board Major Ross, the Lieutenant Governor, one
company of marines and officers, and one hundred and eighty six
convicts, with a proportion of the remaining provisions, and other
stores--The Supply tender, commanded by Lieutenant Ball also took a
company of marines, and twenty convicts.</p>

<p>After a week's sail, they arrived at Norfolk Island, and sailing
nearly round it, they at last found a spot on which the captain
judged that he should be able to land his passengers in safety, the
Island being almost entirely begirt with a shoal, or reef of sunken
rocks, which caused a heavy surf on the least fresh of wind. The
debarkation took place on a rock which projects some distance into
the sea, and continued for two days; no sooner had the last boat load
landed, than the wind shifted, and set right on the shore; as it
began to blow very strong, the ship was obliged to stand out to sea,
leaving nearly three hundred people on shore without a possibility of
landing any of the provisions or stores. This circumstance alarmed
the new settlers, and the more so, as the weather grew so hazey that
they soon lost sight of the ship; however, the next morning the
Supply came to an anchor in the bay, but the greater part of the
provisions and stores being in the Sirius, their apprehensions on her
score were increased. In this state of uncertainty they remained for
four days, when to their great satisfaction at day break on the 20th.
of March they perceived her working into the bay. She soon after
brought too, hoisted out the boats which were loaded with provisions
and dispatched on shore.</p>

<p>The ship falling very fast to leeward, captain Hunter thought it
expedient to make sail, but the reef of sunken rocks extending
farther than was imagined, which was now visible; as the sea began to
rise the surf broke over them a considerable way out, so that it was
not possible for the Sirius to weather it; upon which when they were
sufficiently near they attempted to tack, but missed stays and fell
off again; they were now obliged to wear her round in as small a
space as possible, which was done, and they got under the same sail
as before. The ship continuing to fall to leeward, shoaling her
water, and being baulked a second time in her attempt to tack, her
anchor was let go, but before the cable brought her up, she struck
upon the reef; in a few minutes after she bulged, and the water
flowed into the hold.</p>

<p>The masts were now cut away in order to lighten her, so that there
might be a chance of her swinging over the reef in-shore, whereby the
lives of those on board might be saved, which was effected in the
course of the day, by means of a hawser, which was floated to the
shore by a cask, and made fast to a tree.</p>

<p><a name="s7"></a></p>

<h3>Chapter VII.</h3>

<p>The preservation of the stores and provisions was their next
concern, and as the sea continued turbulent and the weather
tempestuous their former fears of starving returned; there being now
upon that small island (five miles in length, and three in breadth)
no fewer than five hundred souls upon half-allowance of provisions,
and that for a very short time, as the chief part was still in the
most perilous state.--The severe weather subsiding, they had several
very fine days, during which all hands were employed in getting out
the provisions and stores. By great exertions, from twenty to thirty
casks of provisions were brought from the wreck every day, with
various other articles of public and private property; such things as
would swim were thrown into the sea to take their chance of being
wasted on shore by the surf, and guards were placed on the beach to
prevent their being stolen by the convicts: and every thing that was
washed a-shore was placed under the charge of the centinels until
claimed by the proprietor.</p>

<p>Two of the convicts offered their services to bring on shore what
live hogs they could save, but unfortunately they could not withstand
the temptation of the spirit-room, in proceeding to which, they set
the ship on fire in two places, which being perceived from the shore,
a young man named Ascott, a convict, gallantly plunged into the surf,
gained the wreck, extinguished the fire and forced the wretches out
of the ship.</p>

<p>Before the ship could be cleared, the weather became unfavorable,
and the high surf rendered it unsafe for any person to go on
board--'till at length a very heavy sea raised her bodily, and
shifted her berth a cable's length nearer in-shore, so that it was
much easier and safer to send on board, and the greater part of her
cargo was safely landed: before we entirely gave her up, we landed
even the guns, and all her ordnance stores.</p>

<p>The Lieutenant Governor now called a council of all the naval and
military officers, when it was determined that martial law should be
proclaimed--that all private stock, poultry excepted, should be
considered as the property of the state--that justice should be
administered by a court martial, to be composed of seven officers,
five of whom were to concur in a sentence of death; and that there
should be two keys upon the door of the public store, whereof one was
to be in the keeping of a person appointed by Captain Hunter, in
behalf of the seamen, the other by a person in behalf of the
military. The day following the troops, seamen, and convicts, being
assembled, these resolutions were publickly read, and the whole
confirmed their engagement of abiding by them, by passing under his
Majesty's Flag, which was displayed on a convenient spot, and every
person passed under it, bowing as they passed (which they were given
to understand signified their assent) this ceremony was performed
with proper solemnity and great cheerfulness;--Hitherto every
criminal, amenable to trial was to be sent to Port Jackson, with all
the necessary evidence, and there tried, which had been attended with
great inconveniences. Mr. King, was dispatched in the Supply to Port
Jackson with news of the loss of the Sirius, and to entreat that
immediate relief might be sent, as the provisions were so very
scanty, that the following short weekly allowance was obliged to be
resorted to; viz. three pounds of flour, one pound and a half of
beef, or one pound of pork, and one pound of rice.</p>

<p>Observing great quantities of birds hovering over a hill which had
been christened Mount Pitt, it was conjectured that they might draw
some support from thence; accordingly some persons were sent to
examine it--They found it perforated like a rabbit-warren, and full
of nests; towards the evening such flocks came in from the sea that
their numbers were incredible; the people made small fires which
attracting their attention they dropped on the ground, and they
killed as many as they pleased. When they are upon the ground they
cannot raise themselves, owing to the length of their wings, and
until they gain an eminence they cannot take to flight:--for this
purpose nature has provided them with a sharp spur and a strong
hawk's bill, with this assistance they have been seen to climb up a
crooked tree sufficiently high to throw themselves on the wing--they
are about the size of a pidgeon, web-footed and of a dun colour; they
lay but a single egg, but that is full as large as a duck's--the
flesh is like that of a puffin, rather fishy; and although they
killed between two and three thousand every night they could perceive
no diminution of their numbers.</p>

<p>More than six months passed ere any succours arrived from Port
Jackson, and the people in general were very much reduced in bodily
strength for want of food; when two ships arrived with provisions and
a fresh reinforcement of convicts--these supplies were extremely
providential, as their greatest resource, Mount Pitt, began to fail
in the quantity of birds, and the fishing had entirely ceased.</p>

<p>It was at this time that Mr. Wentworth arrived, and was
particularly noticed by Major Ross, who on account of his abilities
and reputation immediately appointed him as a superintending surgeon
of the Island.</p>

<p>During the residence of Captain Hunter and the crew of the Sirius,
he had employed them in blowing up some rocks which obstructed the
passage through the reef; their efforts had been attended with great
success; correct Surveys had also been made by Lieutenant Bradley, so
that a landing was now effected in any weather. The Lieutenant
Governor had caused near two hundred acres of land to be cleared,
having had great success in the first crops of Maize and Wheat--Two
pieces of coarse canvass were manufactured and sent as a specimen to
Governor Philip.</p>

<p>Martial law being discontinued, some prisoners for capital
offences were sent to New South Wales to be tried, but for want of
sufficient evidence they were acquitted--much inconvenience was
experienced from this mode--as all the witnesses were obliged to be
embarked to attend the trial.--In this case the prosecutor was a
settler, and being obliged to leave his farm for the time, his
business of course was suspended 'till his return, and his whole
concern went to ruin--one of the witnesses also was nearly in the
same perdicament. But as the courts here will always be the superior
courts, it will not be easily remedied.</p>

<p>Captain Hunter, his officers and men took their passage to Port
Jackson, after sharing the fatigues and anxieties of the settlers for
the space of eleven months, leaving the Island in a comparative state
of plenty.</p>

<p>Soon after captain King, now promoted to the rank of a master and
commander; also appointed Lieutenant Governor of the settlement,
arrived with his family in the Atlantic transport, and relieved Major
Ross, who returned to New South Wales, with his detatchment, on board
the Queen.</p>

<p>The frequent visitations to Mount Pitt had greatly thinned the
numbers of the birds; more owing to the thoughtless wantonness of the
convicts than the quantity killed; for they not only destroyed bird,
its young and the egg, but the hole in which it burrowed, and from
which they had the most positive orders to refrain; as nothing was
more likely to make them forsake the Island.</p>

<p>The governor having discovered that the Island abounded in
lime--stones, built a handsome and convenient house for himself, with
store houses, Barracks for the soldiery, and other public buildings:
he also persevered with respect to the flax-plant, and agreed with
the master of a transport to procure him two of the natives of New
Zealand, who made good canvas from it in their country; for which
service he was to give him one hundred pounds. Two of them were
accordingly prevailed on to venture to Norfolk Island, where they
resided near a twelvemonth; and having given such instructions as
enabled the colonists to manufacture it tolerably well, began to
evince a hankering after their own country; the governor therefore
was resolved by the first opportunity to gratify their wishes; and
that he might be sure that they did not experience any neglect, or
ill usage, determined to accompany them himself--He accordingly
embarked on board the Britannia, and in a few days restored them to
their native country, and their friends.</p>

<p>A jealousy had subsisted for some time between the Soldiery, the
free men, and others of the Settlers; frequent sparring and acts of
violence had taken place, till at length on the 18th. of January
1794, it broke out in an open warfare, in a place which the governor
had permitted the convicts to perform plays, after their working
hours. He being present immediately ordered one of the soldiers to be
put under an arrest. As soon as the play was finished, the rest of
the soldiers in a body repaired to their own commanding officer; and
boldly demanded the release of their comrade. On his refusing their
request, they signified that they would release him themselves; upon
which the officer spiritedly remonstrated with them, and they
dispersed. They made no movement towards putting their threats in
execution, nevertheless when their conduct was reported to the
governor, he convened all the officers together, and laid before them
what he had heard; also an account of a determination among the
soldiers to release from the halberts any of their comrades, who
should be ordered punishment for any injury or offence done to a
settler: all of which had been ratified with an oath.--He then
pointed out the necessity of punishing the delinquents, which was
effected in the following manner.</p>

<p>On the next day the detatchment was sent from their quarters in
parties upon different duties, unarmed, when the marines, and
settlers who were of the late militia took their arms. On their
return, twenty of them were selected as ringleaders, ten of whom were
sent to Port Jackson in irons to be tried for mutiny, the other ten
received punishment on the island; others were confined for a short
time, when the rest returning cheerfully to their duty the affair
blew over, and things went on as tranquilly as before.</p>

<p>All remembrance of former scarcity began now to be done away, and
upwards of fifty thousand bushels of maize, might have been sent to
Port Jackson, had the Lieutenant Governor though proper to fall in
with the proposals of Mr. King--His harvests had been extremely
productive, and he had purchased from the settlers the surplus of
their first-crops;--bills for the amount of which he drew upon
government in favour of the respective owners;--but as they required
to be approved by the Lieutenant Governor, they were sent to Port
Jackson for that purpose:--There being at this juncture a tolerable
supply of grain in the settlement, the Lieutenant Governor did not
think it prudent to put the crown to so great an expence (nearly four
thousand pounds sterling) therefore declined accepting the Bills.</p>

<p>Mr. King had been fully warranted in this procedure not only by
the idea that the corn would be acceptable, but that it was one of
the express conditions on which the settlers had received their
respective allotments, under the regulations of Governor Philip;
which was, that the overplus grain and stock should be purchased from
them at a fair market price; this circumstance gave great discontent
among the settlers, many of whom gave up their farms, and went to
Port Jackson.</p>

<p>The ground now cleared, comprised near six thousand acres, about
one half of the Island, and the greater part was in high cultivation
in 1794 and 1795, and produced upwards of forty thousand bushels of
grain; but from the impolitic check given to private industry as
before mentioned, the quantity gradually decreased to nearly one
half--the ground thus neglected became over-run with strong thick
weeds, which gave harbour to the numerous rats with which the island
abounds, besides the injury done to the soil, which was much to be
lamented; however, it is to be hoped that--as through the humane
interference of governor Hunter the corn bills are now paid, and a
notification that all the surplus grain would be purchased in future
by government--the industrious disposition of the settlers will again
revive.</p>

<p>The inhabitants on the island are divided into six classes, First,
the Civil and the Military--second, Settlers by grant, or lease,
Freeman hired, and Convicts taken off the stores by officers; the
third class consists of Convicts allowed to officers as servants and
overseers. Artificers, Watchmen. Those employed in husbandry for the
public, and other incidental work, compose the fourth class. The
fifth and sixth comprize the women and children.</p>

<p>There were two schools;--one for young children who were
instructed by a very decent woman;--the other kept by a man, who
taught reading, writing and arithmetic, for which he was well
qualified, and was very attentive: another institution was added for
the reception of orphans. It was unfortunate that these as well as
the other children were destitute of every article of cloathing,
except such as the store afforded, which was not at all calculated
for them in that warm climate. In order to support these institutions
a subscription was raised among the officers, and fines were imposed
in lieu of other punishments for breaches of the peace &amp; c. all
of which were applied to that purpose.</p>

<p>The state of the flax-manufactory is not such as to boast of,
being in great want of tools; they have but one loom, and the only
cloth they at present make is a canvas something finer than No.
7--which is equally strong and durable with that made of European
flax.</p>

<p>Before the arrival of the two New Zealanders no progress had been
made in this manufacture, and it was with great difficulty they could
be persuaded to give any information respecting it, and indeed as the
work is generally performed in New Zealand by the women, they were
not competent to give the fullest instruction: Sufficient however was
obtained to proceed thus far, and since their departure such women as
could be spared from other work, about twelve in number, had been
employed in preparing the flax, and a flax-dresser, weaver, and three
assistants, in manufacturing it into Canvas, Rope &amp; c.</p>

<p>The convicts are employed according to their respective trades,
and work from day-light till eight o'clock,--from nine till noon, and
from two in the afternoon till sun-set. On Fridays and Saturdays they
are allowed to work for themselves, or whoever chuses to hire them;
they are also indulged by government with the loan of tools and
materials. Husbandmen and Labourers work from day light 'till one
o'clock, and have the rest of the day to themselves, which is found
to be more eligible than letting them break off to their meals.</p>

<p>The price of labour for a convict is from five to six pounds per
annum--A Freeman, clothed and victualled, twelve pounds.--A
day's--work for a labourer is three shillings, allowing him
provisions, otherwise five--Clearing an acre of wood, two pounds, an
acre of weeds, thirty shillings--Threshing of Wheat, twenty pence the
bushel--other work is done in proportion--the mode of payment for
which, is according to the circumstances of the employer; in stock,
grain, European Articles, and sometimes, though very rarely, in
cash,--Provisions at the time Mr. Wentworth left the island were very
reasonable; Fresh Pork, six pence a pound; Pickled Pork, eight pence;
Wheat from seven to ten shillings a bushel; Potatoes three shillings
the hundred weight; Fowls from sixpence to a shilling; Ducks from ten
pence to fifteen pence; Turkeys, seven shillings and sixpence; Geese,
ten shillings; She Goats, eight pounds each; Goats flesh, eighteen
pence per pound; these last articles were dear, owing to the
scarcity; but on the whole not more than one third of the price they
bore here. European commodities were nearly at the same price. The
inhabitants amounted to nearly one thousand, about six hundred men,
and the remainder women and children: the births for these last five
years have been one hundred and ninety six, and the deaths one
hundred and forty two, forty of which were under two years of age. At
this time plenty reigned throughout the island, every barn was full
and several thousand pounds of fresh pork had been cured, and fifty
tons of salt provisions in store; so that it may now be stated that
the colony is fully and completely established. Governor King having
by unremitting exertions brought his little colony to this degree of
perfection; now turned his thoughts towards England, as the only
means of restoring his health, which had been greatly impaired; and
on the 23rd. of October, 1796, he embarked with his family on board
the Britannia Transport for England; Mr Wentworth had arrived here in
the beginning of the year, having received an appointment in this
colony.</p>

<p><a name="s8"></a></p>

<h3>Chapter VIII.</h3>

<p>In the commencement of the year 1794 the colony was prodigiously
alarmed on account of the great scarcity of provisions--The public
store had never been in such a reduced state; a reduction of two
pounds of wheat per week, had taken place, and only one serving of
salt provisions left, which was only half a week's-allowance; after
that period, bread and water would be the only resource of the
greater part of the inhabitants; but fortunately on Saturday the 8th.
of March, when the doors of the store had been finally closed, and
the convicts had received their last ration of salt meat, the signal
for a sail was made--and a sail, a sail re-echoed from every part of
the settlement.</p>

<p>A ship had been contracted for, with Mr. Bampton, from India about
a year ago, the return of which was hourly expected; we had also
hopes of the Daedalus, from the North West Court of America--She had
left England with a cargo of provisions, and articles of traffic, and
joined Captain Vancoover at Nootka Sound.--After having delivered
what articles the Discovery and Chatham could at that time take on
board; she was dispatched to this port, with that part of her cargo
which was destined for us; and such stock as she might be able to
procure from the islands she might touch at in her passage; Captain
Vancoover requiring that she should join him again. On their passage
out, the agent of Transports, Mr. Hergist, was unfortunately killed,
with Mr. Gootch, an astronomer, who was going to join Captain
Vancoover, at Whahoo, one of the Sandwich islands.</p>

<p>These people are described by Mr. Mears, in his Voyages, as a
very--quiet inoffensive people, which description begat a confidence
in them, so that they went on shore unarmed; the savages no sooner
had them in their possession than they fell upon them, and most
inhumanly murdered them. An armed party was sent from the ship but
too late; for the two gentlemen were already massacred, and the
horrid cannibals were preparing to broil and eat them; however, they
drove them into the woods, and gathering the mangled limbs together,
buried them on the beach.</p>

<p>A boat with an officer was sent down the harbour, and returned in
the evening with the information that a ship under English colours
had stood a considerable way into the bay, but being headed by a
violent squall, she split her foretop sail, and was compelled again
to put to sea. It was certain that the ship must be a stranger; for
had any person on board had any knowledge of the harbour, they might
with great safety have run her into Spring Cove; the sea running very
high the officer could not board her without the most imminent
danger.</p>

<p>As it grew dark the gale encreased, and morning was anxiously
expected, but it produced us nothing but disappointment and
uncertainty; we saw no more of her on that day, but the wind veering
about to the great joy of every individual in the settlement, she
hove in sight again no Monday the 10th. about three o'Clock in the
afternoon, and at six she came safely to an anchor; as did the
Arthur, a small brig from Bengal.</p>

<p>This ship proved to be the William, from Cork, with a cargo of
beef and pork, but not an ounce of flour; though to make amends, she
brought several pair of millstones, and a machine for dressing flour
&amp; c. which to us was a valuable acquisition and the very day
after they were landed, Wilkinson's new mill was set to work; at
first it went rather heavily, but in a few days, with the labour of
nine men, ground a bushel of wheat in less than twenty minutes;
previous to this there was no mill in the colony; the military as
well as the convicts were obliged to make the best shift they could
to render it into flour.</p>

<p>The brig had on board a small quantity of beef and pork, some
sugar, rum, and coarse calicos--To our great surprise she brought no
news of Mr. Bampton; nor had there been an account of his arrival at
any of the ports in India. When he sailed from this place he
expressed his determination of attempting a passage between this
country and new Guinea. The navigation through this passage is
mentioned as the most dangerous ever performed by any navigator; it
had been passed by captain Blygh, and he was twenty days running
thro' the passage. One day coming to an anchor to avoid danger, the
Providence broke two of her anchors; and at last brought up near the
shore, when eight canoes daringly attacked her, and killed and
wounded several of her people--some of these canoes were seventy feet
long, and contained six and twenty persons. To the disappointment
which the colony sustained from the failure of the contracts already
mentioned, for cattle and provisions; these accounts alarmed every
one for Mr. Bampton's safety, and they feared that his ship had been
wrecked on some of those shoals with which the streights abound, and
that his officers and people had fallen a sacrifice to the
natives.</p>

<p>In consequence of these fortunate arrivals, full allowance of salt
meat was issued; and as soon as the cargoes were landed, the former
deficiencies of allowance were made up to every individual. On the
17th. the last of the wheat was served, a proper quantity being
reserved for seed, and on the next serving day, ten pounds of Indian
corn were substituted for the allowance of wheat; although it was not
yet ripe, and quite unfit to grind; the issuing it in this state was
a matter of necessity. Had the settlers returned the wheat which they
had received from government to sow their grounds last season, no
such necessity would have existed; and it was certainly their duty to
have stepped forward at this moment to assist the colony; but though
they all knew the anxiety that prevailed to preserve the seed wheat,
yet when applied to, they all pleaded that they had not sufficient to
sow their grounds for the present season--This plea was well known to
be without the least shadow of truth; In consequence, the governor
ordered all those whose time of being victualled had expired, to be
struck off the list, and left to provide for themselves, a punishment
which they richly deserved--some of them had been permitted to
receive their rations for more than a year after their EIGHTEEN
MONTHS had expired--the term specified by government.</p>

<p>The distresses of the colony did not seem to make any amendment in
the morals of the convicts. Gambling still prevailed among them to
its fullest extent. One of the overseers, very much addicted to this
ruinous passion, had given great offence to some of the prisoners,
whereupon they formed a plan to rob him the first time he was
observed to be favoured by fortune. He was accordingly surrounded one
evening when at play, and having won a hazard of twenty five dollars,
they rushed upon him as he was gathering up the stake, and secured
the whole. He was fortunate enough to seize one of them with ten of
the dollars in his hand, but lost the remainder. The offender was one
who some time since had been reprieved at the foot of the gallows; he
instantly received a severe corporal punishment, and the overseer,
Mc. Koy, a sharp reprimand; in extenuation, he confessed that gaming
had been his profession for many years, and that had it not been for
this vice he should never have visited this country in the degrading
situation of a convict.</p>

<p>In the month of April the Daedalus returned from Nootka, by her we
learnt that Captain Vancoover had been to Whahoo, and that three of
the natives had been delivered to him by the chief of the island, for
the purpose of being sacrificed to the manes of Mr. Gootch and
Lieutenant Hergist. The poor devils, asert remaining some time on
board the Discovery, were taken one by one into a canoe, and put to
death along--side the ship, by one of the chiefs, with a pistol; the
effects of which equally astonished the executioner and the
spectators.</p>

<p>One of the natives of Port Jackson, who had taken the name of
Collins, had conceived a friendship for Lieut. Hanson, and had made
the voyage with him. On his return to Sydney he found his wife in the
possession of another, a very fine young fellow, called by us Wyatt,
`The news of Collins' return and his being cloathed like us, drew
many of his countrymen about him, and his rival among the rest; they
surveyed each other with contemptuous sullenness, while the poor wife
appeared greatly terrified; undetermined which to claim as her
protector, suspecting that she should be the sufferer whether she was
to belong to her former or her present husband. The point was soon
determined--they shivered a spear together, and Wyatt, who was
wounded in the contest, was obliged to yield up the lady to her
former lord, who, after having asserted his right by the force of
arms, appeared indifferent about the reward, and was seen soon after
traversing the country in quest of another wife.</p>

<p>Some of the natives perceiving that we were desirous of other
fresh water rivers besides the Hawksbury, assured us that at a small
distance from Botany Bay there was a large river which ran into the
sea. Accordingly two of the soldiers who could be depended on, were
sent from the South shore of Botany Bay, well armed; with provisions
for a week.--A young man, a native, went with them as a guide; he
professed a thorough knowledge of the country, and named the place
where the fresh water was to be found; however, after a ramble of six
days they returned it appeared that he had soon walked beyond his
knowledge, and trusted to the soldiers to bring him back. Having
penetrated about twenty miles to the Southward of Botany Bay they
came to a pretty deep bay, which they went round; but discovered no
traces of fresh water. The native evinced no disappointment, but
returned as cheerfully and as well pleased as if he had led them to
the banks of the finest river in the world. An Irish attorney, a
convict, about this time planned an excursion of a different nature;
which was to seize one of the long boats, and in her endeavour to
find his way to Batavia. There were about a dozen concerned, and they
had procured a quantity of provisions; casks, sails, and many other
necessary articles were provided, and when the discovery was made
were found in the the house of the principal. As there were no seamen
among them, it was very lucky that they were prevented from putting
to sea; as during the night they were to sail, it blew a violent gale
of wind, and they must all have inevitably gone to the bottom. All
that government had to regret in these desertions was the loss of the
boats; for the colony would not sustain any injury from the evasion
of a few malcontents, who were too idle to labour, and constantly
promulgating their own seditious opinions among the other
convicts.</p>

<p>Wilkinson the mill-wright was drowned in a pond which he ventured
into after a duck he had shot, and getting entangled among the weeds,
disappeared, though he was an expert swimmer, and there were several
settlers by, who had been with him on the party, but could give him
no assistance.</p>

<p>This unfortunate man was brought out in the Neptune as a convict,
and had worked undistinguished among his fellow prisoners near three
years, before it was discovered that he possessed any mechanical
talents; nor very probably would they ever have been known, had they
not been called forth by a desire of rivalling a mill-wright, of the
name of Thorpe, who had been sent out by government.</p>

<p>He accordingly, having gained permission, set about a mill, the
principal wheel of which was fifteen feet in diameter, and was worked
by two men. This attempt being in direct opposition to the government
mill--wright, consequently he could derive no assistance from his
knowledge and abilities; and he had not only to contend with his
opinions but of all those whom he could prejudice against him. The
most laborious work, of cutting and preparing the timber, was
performed by his fellow prisoners, who voluntarily gave him their
labour. It took him upwards of three months before it was offered for
trial, when it proved defective, owing to the timber not being
properly seasoned; however the projector was found to possess great
merit, and had the whole been conctructed on a larger scale it would
no doubt have answered his most sanguine expectations. Perceiving
what were the defects of his first essay, he undertook to make one on
an improved plan, which he was prevented from completing by his
untimely death.</p>

<p>Some daring villains, returning evil for good, broke into the
house of the Reverend Mr. Johnston, and robbed him of various
articles to a very considerable amount: his servants were suspected
(and no doubt justly) of being accessary, as the part they entered
was the store room, and only known to those about the house. Several
people were taken up, and some of the articles found in the woods,
but those who committed the robbery had the address to elude a
discovery. Another daring burglary was committed in a house occupied
by Mr. Kent, agent for the convicts, he had secured the door with a
strong padlock, and after sun-set had gone out to spend the evening.
About nine o'clock word was brought him that his house had been
broken open; on going home he found that the staple had been wrenched
off, and a large chest, a load for four men, had been carried away.
It contained a large quantity of wearing apparel; money, bills,
letters, &amp; c. and although the robbery could not have been
perpetrated more than an hour or two, no traces of it could be found,
although a great number of people spent the greater part of the night
in searching after them; the chest and a very small part of its
contents was found the next morning. A highway robbery was also
committed about the same time on the person of an American
Supercargo. He was attacked in the dusk of the evening by two men,
close by the barracks; as they struck him they seized hold of his
watch, and with a violent jerk tore away the seals; the watch falling
on the ground, and the place being too public for them to stay to
look for it, they decamped with the seals only.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding every precaution, the horrid vice of gaming (the
parent of these enormities) still prevailed, from the address and
management with which it was carried on.--The persons of the
peace--officers were known to them, and that they might not be
detected in the fact, one of the party, each in their turn, was
stationed to look out, and give the alarm.</p>

<p>In the second year of the settlement, it was reported that a man
was found murdered in one of the coves, a short distance from the
settlement; a general muster of the convicts thereupon took place,
but no person was absent except Caesar, a black fellow, who had
absconded a few days before, from the service of one of the officers,
and taken to the woods with some provisions, an iron pot and a
musket. Robberies being very frequent after Caesar's flight, parties
were sent after him who at length with some difficulty brought him
in. He was reputed the hardest working man in the country; his body
was muscular, and well calculated for hard labour; but in his
intellects he was not far removed from the brute creation; his
appetite was so ravenous that he could devour the full ration of
three days in one; to pamper this appetite he was compelled to steal
from others;--and this he did at every opportunity, without even
caring for the consequences; indeed he was so indifferent about being
punished with death, that he used to declare if they should scrag him
he would quiz them all, and show them some gig at the nubbing-cheat,
before he was turned off. The governor did not think him a proper
object to make an example of, therefore ordered that he should be
kept at work in fetters; however, he contrived to free himself from
them, and several times got off to the woods, but was generally soon
taken, and a severe flogging was always the result; and which he
always treated with the utmost contempt. In one of his excursions, he
quarrelled with and killed one of the natives called Pemulwy, who had
some time before wounded Collins, a great favourite with the
colonists; he requested his friends to take him to the hospital, and
when he was brought thither, it was found that a barbed spear had
been driven into his loins, close to the vertebrae of the back, and
was so firmly fixed that all the efforts of the Surgeons to remove it
with their instruments were in-effectual. Finding that he could not
be relieved by art, he determined to trust to their general Physician
and Surgeon, Nature, and he did not trust in vain; for some weeks he
was seen walking about with the spear unmoved, even after the wound
had suppurated, but at last after many fruitless efforts, his wife
Warreweer, succeeded, and drew it out with her teeth, after which he
quickly recovered.</p>

<p>The many robberies that were nightly committed, rendered it
expedient to put a stop to an evil so destructive of the happiness
and comfort of the industrious inhabitants, Caesar was still in the
woods, with several other vagabonds, all of whom were armed, and as
the savage had declared that he would never suffer himself to be
taken alive, it became absolutely necessary to secure such a
desperado, at all events. A proclamation was accordingly issued,
promising to whomsoever should bring him in, with his arms, a reward
of five gallons of spirits; and those who were indulged with
ammunition by the officers, were informed that if they should be
discovered in supplying the plunderers and run aways with any part of
it, they would be deemed accomplices in the robberies, and punished
accordingly.</p>

<p>This proclamation had not the desired effect, Black Caesar
continued to elude all his pursuers; and scarcely a day past but
complaints of robberies were preferred against him. In short every
theft that was committed was ascribed to him; a cask of pork was
stolen from the mill-house, the upper part of which was accessible;
the centinels who had charge of the building were tried and
acquitted, and the theft was laid upon Caesar, or some of the
vagabonds in the woods, the number of whom at this time amounted to
near a dozen.</p>

<p>This ruffian continued his lawless and predatory reign till the
15th. of February 1796, when he was shot by one Wimbow. This man and
another, allured by the reward, had been some time in search of him;
having found his haunt, a cavern, the mouth of which was covered with
short thick brush wood, which rendered it almost imperceptible; they
dogged him, and saw him enter it in the dusk of the evening; they hid
themselves near it all night. In the morning, when he turned out of
his den, he looked round, and seeing his danger, presented his piece;
ere he could pull the trigger, Wimbow fired and shot him--he was
taken to the house of Rose, the settler, at Liberty Plains, where he
died in a few hours--Thus was the colony at length rescued from the
depredations of a ruffian, whom no indulgence could reclaim, nor
severity intimidate.</p>

<h3>Chapter IX.</h3>

<p>About the middle of July 1794 arrived the Fancy, Snow, from
Bombay, with a part of the provisions contracted for with Captain
Bampton, who had arrived at Bombay after a tedious voyage of near
seven months. Mr. Thomas Dell, formerly chief mate of the Shah
Hormuzear, commanded this vessel; from him we were informed of the
following particulars of that disastrous voyage. The Shah Hormuzear,
in company with the Chesterfield, sailed from Norfolk Island on the
27th. of May 1793--On the First of July they fell in with an island
which they called Tate's Island.--Captain Hill, of the New South
Wales Corps, with Mr. Carter, had taken their passage to Europe in
this ship--Mr. Shaw, chief mate of the Chesterfield, with a boat's
crew went on shore for fresh provisions; they purposed staying all
night on the Island to barter for emu feathers. They had scarce
landed when it came on to blow, and the ship was driven considerably
to leeward of the bay.</p>

<p>The natives received the gentlemen very kindly, and appeared
highly gratified with the presents which they severally made them. It
was now proposed that Mr. Carter, Mr. Shaw and Ascott--the convict
whose activity preserved the Sirius from being destroyed by Fire, the
night she went on shore at Norfolk Island--should proceed to the top
of a high point of land which was at some distance; and that Captain
Hill should stay by the boat, with her crew; four seamen belonging to
the Chesterfield.</p>

<p>The party proceeding in-land had taken the precaution of arming
themselves. Nothing particular occurred during their walk, though
some trifling circumstances induced Ascott to suspect that the
Natives meditated some mischievous design against them; this idea he
imparted to his companions, who scouted his apprehensions. On their
return from the hill, their designs became more apparent, and the
savages seemed only deterred from committing violence on them by the
activity of Ascott, who frequently presented his musket at them to
keep them off, but notwithstanding his activity and vigilance they at
length made their attack. They first attempted to make themselves
master of Ascott's gun, finding him the most likely to annoy them;
directly after which Mr. Carter, who was the foremost of the party,
suddenly exclaimed "My God, My God! they have murdered me." Ascott,
who still retained his gun, instantly fired, on which the Natives
left them and fled into the bushes. Ascott now came to the spot where
he saw a most dreadful spectacle; Mr. Carter lying bleeding on the
ground, and Mr. Shaw with a large wound on his throat under the left
jaw. They were however able to rise and proceed down to the boat. On
their arrival at the beach they called out to their companions to
fire; but to their extreme horror they perceived Captain Hill and one
of the seamen lying dead on the sand, cut and mangled in the most
barbarous manner. Two others of the seamen they saw floating on the
water, with their throats cut from ear to ear,--the fourth sailor
they found dead in the boat, mangled in the same shocking manner.
With much difficulty these unhappy people got into their boat, and,
cutting her grapnel, pulled off from this treacherous Island. While
they were getting out of the bay, they perceived the natives dragging
the bodies of Captain Hill and the seamen from the beach towards some
large fires, which they supposed were prepared for the occasion;
yelling and howling at the same time dismally.</p>

<p>These wretched survivors of their companions, having seen from the
top of the hill, whither their ill fated curiosity had led them, a
large sand bank, not far from the island, determined to run under the
lee of it, as they very reasonably expected that boats would be sent
from the ship in search of them. They experienced very little ease or
rest that night, and when day light appeared found that they had
drifted nearly out of sight of the island, and to leeward of the sand
bank.</p>

<p>Finding it was impossible to reach the bank, they determined by
the advice of Shaw, the only seaman among them, to run direct for
Timor, the wind being very luckily fair for that settlement. On
examining what was left in the boat, they found a few of the trifles
which they had taken to barter with the natives, and Ascott's
great-coat, but neither compass, provisions, nor water. They however
pushed on to the westward, trusting to that providence for their
relief, which had delivered them from the treacherous cannibals at
Tate's Island.</p>

<p>In this forlorn and destitute condition, weakened by the loss of
blood, with scarce strength to manage the boat; their sufferings
became almost too much for human nature to sustain before they
reached a place of safety.</p>

<p>They left the island on the third of July; on the seventh two
small birds dropped into the boat which they instantly devoured, and
were considerably revived by this providential relief; on the next
day they had the land on both sides of them, they passed through
these streights, and continued their course to the westward. All that
could be done with their wounds was to open them from time to time
and cleanse them with salt water; on the eleventh they saw land a
head of them, and in the afternoon pushed their boat into a small
bay. Here they found the natives apparently very hospitable, giving
them roasted Yams and fresh water, they also gave them to understand
that Timor was still to the southward of them. Not considering
themselves in perfect safety they again embarked; they had not gone
far from the land when they perceived that they were chaced by a
large Proa, which they escaped by standing over a reef which the
Indians did not chuse to encounter. At day break on the 13th. they
saw a point of land, but not being able to weather it, they ran into
a small bay, where the natives received them, crying out "Bligh,
Bligh." Here they landed, were hospitably entertained, and freed from
the horror of perishing by famine.</p>

<p>This place was called by the natives Sarrett, and was distinct
from Timor land, which was the first they refreshed at. They found
also that there was another small island to the Northward, called by
them Fardatte, but which is commonly called in charts, Tanabor, where
a Proa comes yearly from Banda to trade, and which they expected in
about seven or right months.</p>

<p>On the twenty-fifth of June Mr. Carter's wound was entirely
healed, after having had thirteen pieces of the fractured skull taken
out: but he did not long survive his cure,--he caught a fever on the
seventeenth of November, and died on the tenth of December, much
regretted by his two fellow sufferers. Mr. Shaw and Ascot waited, in
anxious expectation, the arrival of the trading Proa from Banda,
which, to their great joy, entered the harbour on the twelfth of
March.</p>

<p>For Banda they sailed on the tenth of April, and arrived there on
the first of May, where they were received with the greatest
hospitality by the governor, who supplied them with every necessary
that they wanted, and provided them with a passage on board an
Indiaman bound to Batavia, where they landed on the tenth of
October.</p>

<p>To return to the Ships; the boats had but scarcely landed, when it
came on to blow, and increased to a gale, so that the ships were
driven several leagues to leeward of the bay in which they landed;
and it was three days before they could send any boats in search of
them--Mr. Dell, and a party well armed, search'd in vain for them;
and burned several huts of the natives--At a place where there had
been a fire they had incontestible proofs that their friends had
fallen sacrifices to the inhuman cruelty of the natives--three human
hands, their great coats with the buttons cut off; a tinder-box, a
lanthorn, a tomahawk, and other articles from the boat were also
found. They rowed entirely round the island, searching in vain for
their boat; they endeavoured to make some of the natives prisoners
but without effect; they, however, made them understand by signs that
they had murdered all who were in the boat, except two, who got away
with her--he was therefore obliged to return on board with the
meancholy account.</p>

<p>The island is described as abounding with sweet potatoes, bananas,
plantains, bamboo, cocoa trees, and mangroves; the natives stout, and
from five feet eight inches to six feet two in height; their colour
dark, and their language harsh and disagreeable. Their weapons are
spears, lances of hard black wood, and clubs about four feet in
length. They live in huts, resembling a haycock, with a pole driven
through the middle, formed of long grass and the leaves of the cocoa
tree; and many contain six or eight persons each: they are enclosed
with a strong piece of bamboo. In a corner of some of the huts were
perceived a wooden image, intended to represent a man; in others the
figure of a bird, very rudely carved, daubed with red ochre, and
curiously decorated with the feathers of the emu. Over these images
were suspended, from the roof, several strings of human hands, each
string having five or six hands on it. In some they found small piles
of human skulls; and in one, in which there was a larger pile than in
any other that they had visited; they observed some gum burning
before a wooden image. The island was supposed to be about fifteen
miles in circumference, in Longitude one hundred and forty two
degrees fifty nine minutes East of Greenwich.--The Shah Hormuzear did
not arrive at Timor until the eleventh of September, having been
detained in the straits by a most difficult and dangerous
navigation.</p>

<h3>Chapter X.</h3>

<p>The rogues who had broken into Mr. Kent's house had the audacity
to send him a letter in miserable verse, containing some accusations
against Bevan, who was at present in confinement for a felony, and a
woman who they supposed had given information of the people that
broke into the clergyman's store-room, of which they acknowledged
themselves to have been the perpetrators; the letter was accompanied
with a pocket book belonging to Mr. Kent with some memorandums, but
not, one of the bills that were in it were ever recovered.</p>

<p>This daring proceeding, and the frequency of their nightly
depredations obliged every person to be on their guard and to keep a
strict look-out, 'till at length three convicts were apprehended on
suspicion of house--breaking, and were accordingly brought to
trial--John Bevan, was acquitted for want of evidence, the other two
John Fleming, and Archibald Macdonald were capitally convicted; they
had broken into a soldier's hut, and were said to have been concerned
in robbing Mr. Johnstone. They were executed on the third day after
the trial.</p>

<p>In the month of August 1794, a party of half a dozen of us set out
in search of stragglers, of which there were a great number in the
woods, and took provisions for a week's excursion, after proceeding a
few miles inland we came to a ridge of mountains, very difficult of
ascent, and when at the top our prospect was bounded by another ridge
with an intermediate valley of about a mile across; in this valley we
took up our first nights lodging in a sort of hut which had been the
occasional shelter of some of the hunters tribe; we kindled a fire
and kept watch by turns till day-break, when we proceeded on our
journey, and were not a little surprised when we had ascended the
second ridge, to find another still before us at about the same
distance, in short we passed seventeen or eighteen of these ridges in
the same manner; at last we despaired of penetrating beyond the
mountains and determined on returning, having been according to
computation sixty miles from the settlement, and twenty miles farther
in the country than any person had yet ventured.</p>

<p>The summit of these rocks are iron stone, large fragments of which
lay scattered in the valleys, in which were ponds of water with a
reddish tinge,--the soil on the ascent was tolerably good and
afforded shelter for large herds of the red Kangaroo.--The valleys
bore visible signs of being frequently visited by high winds or
hurricanes, and were strewed by trunks of trees: we saw but few of
the natives who fled at our approach, and seemed to prefer the
enjoyment of rocks and woods to any intercourse with us: we returned
to Paramatta after a most toilsome journey of nine days, and without
obtaining the least satisfaction in our researches.</p>

<p>The Irish prisoners were now again become very troublesome; and
several of them missing muster, it was instantly rumoured that they
had formed a plan to seize the Cumberland, a large decked-boat, which
had lately sailed with provisions for the settlers at the Hawksbury
river. Some went so far as to say that she was already taken just
without the point of the harbour. Notice was immediately dispatched
over land, to the settlement on the river to put the people in the
boat on their guard against a surprize; and for them to return to
Port Jackson the instant that her cargo was delivered. An armed long
boat was also sent to protect her in her passage back.</p>

<p>A few days relieved us from suspence with regard to the
Cumberland, as all the reports were without any foundation; and were
most probably fabricated to conceal a different scheme which, while
every one's attention was taken up with the fate of the Cumberland,
they actually put in execution.</p>

<p>Some of these Hibernian gentry stole a six oared boat, belonging
to Lieutenant Mc Arthur, with which they got clear of the harbour
undiscovered; but some days after she was found at Botany Bay.--The
people threatned resistance, but soon took to the woods, leaving the
boat with all the things they had prepared for their voyage. They
soon appeared, at the farms about Sydney, for plunder, but one of
them being fired at and wounded, the rest thought it would be most
prudent to surrender themselves which they accordingly did. They
confessed that they never meant to return, but wanted to go to Broken
bay, which they thought they had reached when they arrived at Botany
Bay, being entirely ignorant of its situation or whether it lay to
the northward, or the southward. The wounded man died the next day in
the hospital, and his companions after a severe flogging, were sent
to their respective gangs to labour with an Iron on each of their
legs.</p>

<p>About this time a public granary at Paramatta was burnt down, but
whether owing to incendiaries, or accident was never known, the loss
was very considerable, near three thousand bushels of wheat, and a
quantity of stock belonging to individuals also perished in the
flames.</p>

<p>The natives about the Hawksbury now began to quarrel with the
settlers, and took every opportunity of pil-fearing from them;
becoming more bold from not meeting with a check, half a dozen of
them stole unawares upon one of the settlers, wounded him and his
servant and got them in their power before they could procure any
assistance. The servant was so severely hurt with spears and clubs
that his life was endangered,--encouraged by this first essay, they a
few days after in a stronger party attacked the huts while the
settlers were in their grounds at work and was carrying off all their
cloaths, provisions, and whatever they could lay their hands on, the
alarm being given, the sufferers collected what arms they could, and
attacked the murderers in a body, and killed seven or eight of them
on the spot.</p>

<p>It was generally supposed that the settlers had drawn these evils
upon themselves by their own misconduct: there was not a doubt but
that many natives had been wantonly fired upon; and whenever they
could get any of their children into their possession would detain
them, notwithstanding the earnest entreaties of their parents to
return them.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1794 warrants of emancipation passed the great
seal of the settlement, in behalf of Robert Sidaway, who received an
unconditional pardon, in consideration of his diligence, good
conduct, and strict integrity in his employment for several years, as
the public baker of the settlement; and William Leach, who was
permitted to quit the country, provided he did not return to England
till the term of his transportation was expired. Eight were permitted
to list in the New South Wales Corps, and James Harris, James
Ruffler, and Richard Partridge, who were all transported for life,
received a pardon, or (according to their own term) were made free on
the ground, which enabled them to become settlers, as were also
William Joyce, Benjamin Carver, and William Waring.</p>

<p>Two female natives, the sisters of Banalang and his fellow
traveller, having applied to the Lieutenant Governor to defend them
from the insults and cruelties they frequently experienced from their
countrymen in the absence of their protectors; were sent on board the
Daedalus to be taken to Norfolk Island, where they would spend their
time in peace and retirement, under the protection of Captain King,
till the return of their brothers.</p>

<p>John Bevan, who has been several times made mention of, was tried
on the first of October, for breaking open the house of William
Fielder, a settler at Sydney, and being caught in the fact, was fully
convicted, and received sentence of death; and at nine in the morning
of the sixth he was executed. The night previous to this execution, a
murder was committed at Parramatta by one Hill, a convict, on the
body of Simon Burns a free settler. It appeared on the trial, which
lasted five hours that Hill, a butcher by trade, had lived in a state
of continued animosity with the deceased, taking every opportunity of
abusing and quarrelling with him,--they had been out drinking in
company all Sunday;--a woman who lived with Hill coming in, words
arose between them, and Hill rising to strike her, she ran out of the
house to avoid a beating;--the deceased interfering was stabbed by
Hill to the heart; he lived a very few minutes, and had but just
strength to declare in the presence of several witnesses, that the
butcher had killed him. The prisoner attempted to establish an alibi,
but the fact was clearly proved against him, and he was sentenced to
die, and his body to be dissected, which was accordingly performed on
the 16th.</p>

<p>A very serious complaint was made by the natives (through the
medium of some who lived at Sydney, and could speak English
tolerably) against the Settlers at the Hawkesbury, which corroborated
the opinion before stated. It was now asserted, that some of them had
seized a native boy, and, tying him hand and foot, had dragged him
several times over a fire, till his back was dreadfully burnt; after
which they threw him into the river, where they shot at, and killed
him. A strict investigation of this complaint immediately took place,
when it came out, that a boy had been actually shot by them when he
was in the water, but that they had considered him as a spy, detached
from a large body of the natives, who had assembled with an intention
of falling on them; and that he was returning to them with an account
of their weakness, there being only one musket among several farms.
These assertions being uncontradicted, they were admitted as truths;
but it was conjectured by many only to be a fabrication, invented to
cover the true circumstance,--that a boy had been cruelly and
wantonly murdered by them.</p>

<p>An action at civil law was brought by Joyce, the convict who had
lately received his freedom, against Thomas Davenny, a superintendant
of convicts at Toongabbe, when the defendant availed himself of a
misnomer; the plea being admitted, the plaintiff was nonsuited, and
before the next court assembled, the parties compromised the
business.</p>

<p><a name="s11"></a></p>

<h3>Chapter XI.</h3>

<p>On the 25th of October, Messrs Muir; Palmer, Skirving, and
Margorott, four gentlemen, arrived in the Surprise transport. They
had been tried in Scotland for sedition, were convicted, and
transported to this country. They were each allowed a small neat
house and garden, with servants to wait on them.</p>

<p>Mr. Muir was tried before the High Court of Justiciary in
Edinburgh, on the 20th of August, 1793. He was accused of exciting,
at different meetings, denominated Societies of Reform, by means of
seditious speeches and harangues, a spirit of disaffection against
the King and Government--of producing and reading aloud "An Address
from the United Irishmen in Dublin, to the Delegates for promoting a
Reform in Scotland;" and of circulating and distributing such
seditious writings. To these charges Mr. Muir pleaded Not Guilty. He
said, he had nothing to observe on the relevancy; he would trust
himself to the Jury. He had given in a written defence, in which he
declared the libel to be false, and that he would prove that he had
all along supported the constitution. Being asked if he had any other
defence; he said, he rested upon his own written defence. He had
uniformly advised the people to pursue legal and constitutional
measures, as well as to read all works written upon the great
national question of reform. The Jury being named, Mr. Muir objected
to every one of them; he said, that as the gentlemen were all
subscribers of the Goldsmiths' Hall Association, and had offered a
reward for discovering those who circulated what they were pleased to
term seditious publications, they had already prejudged him, and were
therefore improper persons to pass upon his assize. The
Solicitor--General, in reply, said, their Lordships were equally
precluded, as both they, and every friend to the constitution, had
condemned the writings of Paine.--After examining the witnesses in
behalf of the prosecution, and the prisoner, the Lord Justice Clerk
summed up the evidence, and after commenting in very strong language
on the different parts of it, left the Jury to draw their own
conclusions; who bringing in their verdict guilty, the Court
sentenced him to be transported beyond the seas, to such place as his
Majesty, with the advice of his Privy Council, should judge proper,
for the space of fourteen years.--Mr. Muir observed, that though some
in the Court might think the sentence too lenient, and others too
severe, yet had he been taken from the bar to the scaffold, he would
have met his fate with equal coolness, so convinced was he of the
justice of his cause.--Mr. Palmer, who was a Clergyman, was tried at
Perth, found guilty of writing a seditious hand-bill, and his
sentence was seven years transportation. Messrs. Margarot and
Skirving were tried for the same practices, and were sentenced to
fourteen years each.</p>

<p>By this ship we heard that his Excellency was on his passage, and
might be very soon expected. As soon as the store ships were cleared,
a general distribution of slops took place among the convicts; to the
men, a jacket, waistcoat; shirt, hat, and a pair of breeches; and to
the women, one petticoat, one shift, one pair of stockings, one cap,
one neck kerchief, one hat, and one jacket, made of raven duck. A
distinction was made with respect to the overseers and watchmen, who
received a coat instead of a jacket, duck trowsers instead of
breeches, and one pair of shoes.</p>

<p>Several seamen belonging to a ship bound to the North-west coast
of America, preferring the pleasures which they met with on shore in
the society of the women, and the free circulation of grog, to
proceeding on their voyage, left their ship some days previous to her
sailing. Application being made the Lieutenant-Governor, orders were
issued out to apprehend them; they were also given to understand,
that if they remained behind they would be severely punished, and
kept to hard labour; but the settlements now had become so extensive,
that runaways and vagrants never failed of finding employment in the
remote parts, more particularly at the river.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the year, a farm of five and twenty acres of
ground was sold by public auction for thirteen pounds; four acres
were planted with Indian corn, and half an acre with potatoes; there
was besides a tolerable hut on the premises. This farm was the
property of Samuel Crane, a soldier, who received his death by a tree
falling on him, which he was felling.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-Governor Grose embarked for England in the Daedalus, on
the 15th of December, with several gentlemen of the colony, and some
convicts, whose terms had expired. The command now was vested in
Captain William Paterson, senior officer in the colony, and he took
the prescribed oaths accordingly.</p>

<p>Many of the convicts' terms were now expired; numbers also, by
their good conduct, had obtained their emancipation, and were at
liberty to work for themselves: the officers and settlers had also a
considerable number in their employ, so that the public agriculture
was nearly at a stand. Captain Paterson, therefore, caused a general
muster to take place, and upwards of fifty people were found without
any employment, whose labour still belonged to the public; most of
these were laid hold of, and sent to Parramatta and Toongabbe, with a
large gang of labourers, to prepare the public grounds for wheat for
the ensuing season. They began their work on the 2nd, of January, New
Year's Day being always kept as a holiday.</p>

<p>It was now determined to station some military force at the
Hawkesbury settlement, as well to preserve good order and regulation
among the settlers, as to defend them against the natives;
accordingly a schooner was dispatched with an officer and a guard;
they had also a mill, and provisions for the settlers.</p>

<p>A convict, on entering his hut, was bit on the foot by a black
snake; an immediate swelling took place up to his hip, and a large
tumour in the groin. Mr. Thompson, the surgeon, reduced all the
swellings, by frequently bathing the parts with oil, and fortunately
saved both the man's life and the limb also. Before the settlement
was cleared from the wood, snakes and other reptiles were by no means
so frequently seen as since; by clearing and opening the woods they
were not destroyed by fire, but now they were often seen basking in
the foot-paths at mid-day, particularly after a shower of rain.</p>

<p>The principal labour performed in January was preparing the ground
for wheat. The Indian corn looked remarkably well; it was now
ripening, and the Hawkesbury settlers supposed that they should have
between thirty and forty thousand bushels of that grain raised among
themselves. Allured by the civil treatment they experienced, several
native boys had taken up their quarters among the settlers in the
several districts, and became extremely useful; thay laboured
cheerfully in the fields, and performed more of that kind of labour
in a few hours, than a convict would in a whole day.</p>

<p>The store-house on the Hawkesbury being finished, the stores from
the schooner were landed, and put under the care of Baker, the
settler; several of the officers had come round with the schooner,
with a view of selecting eligible spots for farms; on their return,
they spoke in very high terms of the crops of corn which they saw
growing there--the generality of the farms that had been in wheat,
producing from thirty-six to forty bushels an acre; that a bushel was
sufficient to sow an acre; and that, if sown as early as April, the
ground would produce a second harvest. Their gardens are abundantly
stocked with vegetable.</p>

<p>A wild young fellow, named Wilson, whose term of servitude had
expired, preferred the mode of living among the natives, to earning
his livelihood by the sweat of his brow. This person acquainted the
settlers that the natives had threatened to put some of them to
death: which caution made them vigilant and on their guard However,
they attacked and wounded two of them.</p>

<p>The tribe with which Wilson associated had given him the name of
Bunboe; as he was of a thoughtless, dissipated disposition, and his
sole view of herding with them was merely to prevent his being
obliged to work for his living, no good consequence was supposed
could accrue from his conduct; and it was not improbable: but that,
at some future period, he might assist them in their deprecations on
the settlers.</p>

<p>The Deputy Surveyor-General, Mr. Grimes, having received orders to
take the schooner, as soon as she had delivered her cargo, to Port
Stephens; for the purpose of taking a regular survey of that harbour;
this Wilson, or Bunboe, being a useful fellow on such occasions,
having a slight smattering of the native tongue, was prevailed on to
go with him. On their arrival at Port Stephens they found two
fresh-water branches; they did not run far up the river, but
terminated in a swamp not far from the beach. Mr. Grimes describes
the land on each side to be low and sandy, and found nothing which
could render a second visit necessary. The natives were far from
being friendly; they appeared rather a taller and stouter race than
those about this settlement, and their language entirely different.
Their canoes and huts were considerably larger than those we had seen
here, but their weapons were the same. They were welcomed on shore
with a dance, joined hand in hand round a tree, probably to express
their unanimity; but one of them making signs for Mr. Grimes to
follow him into the wood, which he had no sooner entered than he
poised a spear, and was on the point of throwing it, when Wilson, who
had watched his motions, levelled a double barrelled gun at him, and
fired; he instantly dropped, and it was thought he was wounded, but
he presently jumped up and prepared a second time to throw the spear,
when Wilson gave him the fire he had in reserve, which took effect,
and he was seen to rise no more. Mr. Grimes now made the best of his
way to the boat, which he reached without further molestation.</p>

<p>The 17th of March St. Patrick found many votaries in the
settlement, and the late arrivals from the Cape had made brandy very
plentiful;--the libations to the Saint were proportionably liberal;
so that riot and debauchery, for the space of four and twenty hours,
were the order of the day.</p>

<p>A few days after the feast of St. Patrick, having some business at
Sydney, and passing the brick fields, I saw, at the lower end of the
second field, one of the native women in close conference with a
young man; an amorous scene ensued, which was soon interrupted by the
appearance of a third person, who proved to be the lord and master of
the lady, who lay panting in the embraces of another. She instantly
took to flight, and escaped for the time, but the lover was not so
fortunate, for the enraged husband, being much more powerful than his
antagonist, literally beat him to death, before we could arrive at
the spot to his rescue. The friends of the deceased called Goruey to
an account for the murder, and the affair being conducted with more
regard to punctilio than justice, he came off with a slight wound in
his thigh.</p>

<p>Amongst various other burglaries, the house of Mr. Muir was broken
into, and nearly all that gentleman's property stolen; some articles
were laid in his way the next day, but he remained a very
considerable loser by the visit. The private stock yards were
frequently attacked, but a pretty sharp look out being generally
kept, they seldom met with much success in those attempts. One fellow
played off a trick that he thought would go down with the hungry; he
stole a very fine greyhound, and, instead of keeping him to hunt,
killed him secretly, and sold the flesh to different people for
kangaroo, at nine-pence per pound, but being detected, he received a
most exemplary punishment,--a just reward for his villainy.</p>

<p>A criminal court having been assembled on the 20th of May, Mary
Pawson was tried for the crime of arson. On the trial it appeared
that the prisoner bore a most implacable hatred to the wife of the
owner of the house that was burnt, but there was no evidence that
directly led to convict her of having set the house on fire. She was
accordingly acquitted; but the settlers adjoining their farm,
disliking such a character in their neighbourhood, obliged the
husband, who was an honest man, and had nothing against him but his
wife, to sell a very good farm, and go to a more remote and less
advantageous situation. At the same time, James Barry, a notorious
offender, was tried for attempting to break into a settler's house at
the Ponds, with an intent to steal; the proof was too clear to admit
of his escape. He was sentenced to receive a thousand lashes.</p>

<p>Bunboe, directly after his return from Port Stephens, went off to
the natives at the river. Another vagabond like himself, Knight,
thinking there must be much pleasure in the roving life which Wilson
led, determined to go off with him; they had not been gone long when
they both returned into the town, accompanied by some of their
companions. On the following day it appeared that this visit was for
the purpose of forcing a wife from among the women of this district,
agreeably to the custom of the country. They accordingly selected two
girls, the eldest not twelve years old, whom they seized, and,
assisted by their friends, were hurrying off with them. The shrieks
of the children soon brought assistance, who rescued them, and took
their ravishers, who were severely punished; but though a strict
guard was kept over them, they soon found means to elude their
vigilance, and joined their former companions.</p>

<h3>Chapter XII.</h3>

<p>On the 20th of August, his Majesty's ship Providence, Captain
Broughton, arrived from England, with the agreeable intelligence that
they had left Governor Hunter, in the Reliance, at Rio Janeiro, and
that he might be hourly expected. The Providence had missed this
port, and was driven as far to the northward as Port Stephens, where,
to the great surprise of Captain Broughton, he found four runaways
from this settlement; they were so covered with filth, tanned by the
sun, and dried by the smoke, that they were absolutely taken for
natives. They were found to be Tarwood, Lee, Connoway, and Watson.
These men,--with Joseph Sutton, since dead,--in the night of the 26th
of September 1790, stole a small punt, with which they got down to
Sydney; they there exchanged the punt for a boat, with a mast and
sail, with which they got clear of the harbour. They had each taken
provisions for a week, their clothes, bed and bedding, their iron
pots, and several kitchen utensils. These desperate adventurers had
been universally supposed to have been swallowed up by the ocean, or
perished with hunger. They now told a melancholy tale of their
sufferings in the boat, and for many days after their arrival, had
crowds of both black and white people listening to the adventures
which befel them in Port Stephens, Having been hospitably received by
the savages, they fared as they did; but the change in their living
soon disagreed with them, and they were all taken ill, and
principally affected with swellings in the abdomen, but soon
recovered, except Sutton, who fell a victim. They gave the natives a
very high character for hospitality and kindness. Each of them had
arms given to them, with very curious ceremonies; wives also were
allotted them, and one or two had children. They were never required
to interfere in their wars, and were supplied by the natives with
fish, and other food, and really considered them as unfortunate
strangers, who had a claim to their protection. They said that the
natives appeared to worship them, telling them,--when they began to
understand each other,--that they were undoubtedly the ancestors of
some of them who had fallen in battle, and had returned from the sea
to visit them again; and one of them firmly believed that his father
was absolutely come back in the person of Lee, or Connoway, and took
them to the spot where his body had been burnt. On being told that
great numbers of people existed, far beyond their knowledge to
conceive, they instantly pronounced them to be the spirits of their
countrymen, which, after death, had migrated into other regions. It
appeared, when Mr. Grimes was there, that they were at some distance
inland; that they had heard of the schooner's being there, and were
acquainted with the man who was shot by Wilson, who had afterwards
recovered.</p>

<p>On the 7th of September, Governor Hunter arrived, but did not
assume the exercise of his authority until the 11th, when his
commission was publicly read by the Judge Advocate. His Excellency,
in a very pertinent speech, declared the expectations he had from
every one's conduct, touching with great delicacy on that of the
gentlemen who had newly arrived from Scotland, and who were present;
strongly urging the necessity of a general unanimity in support of
his Majesty's Government. He was afterwards sworn in by the Judge
Advocate, and a general act of oblivion extended throughout the
settlement, whereby Raymond, who was under sentence of death, was
pardoned, and several runaways returned to their labour.</p>

<p>The report of the general muster, made by order of Captain
Paterson, being laid before the Governor, he thought proper to make
some alterations in the assistance granted by Government to settlers,
and others, holding allotments of land. To the officers, cultivating
grounds, he continued the number they already had, viz. ten for
agriculture, and three for domestic purposes. To the settlers he
allowed five male convicts; to the superintendants, constables, and
store-keepers, four; the marine settlers, two; to settlers who had
been convicts, one; and to serjeants of the New South Wales corps,
one.</p>

<p>On the 5th of November, the Sovereign store-ship arrived from
England, in which was embarked Mr. Joseph Gerald, who was adjudged to
fourteen years transportation, for being a member of a seditious
club, or association called The British Convention, and for making
addresses of a seditious tendency to the members of the said
Convention. He arrived in a very weak and debilitated state of
health. He languished about four months in the last stage of a
consumption, and died on the 16th of March 1796. This gentleman was
born in the West Indies, where he inherited considerable property.
His first residence in England was under the roof of Doctor Parr,
with whom he remained a number of years. When he returned to the West
Indies he married a beautiful young lady, with a considerable
fortune; by her he had two sons, with whom he went over to England to
establish them at an academy, where they now are. Mrs. Gerald is
still living in the West Indies. Three days after, he was followed by
his companion, Mr. Skirving, who died of a dysentery. These gentlemen
were much regretted by the whole colony; their political opinions
never manifested themselves, and all their solicitude seemed to be to
evince themselves the friends of human nature.</p>

<p>On the 7th of November a criminal court was held, when the
following persons where tried:--Chinnery, a black, for robbing his
master; Samuel Smith, and Abraham Whitehouse, for house-breaking:
these were found guilty, and condemned to die. Two settlers and six
convicts, for an assault, with intent to ravish Marianne Wilkinson,
three of whom were found guilty, and sentenced as follows: The
principal to receive one thousand lashes; the others eight hundred
each. This was the second trial for this crime; but the witnesses
prevaricated so much in the first instance, that the offenders, for
that time, escaped punishment, which had encouraged several others to
commit the same unmanly attacks, in numbers, on a single woman. To
such a height was this infamous practice carried, that it obtained a
cant name, and the poor unfortunate objects of this brutality,--many
of whom, through shame, concealed the circumstance,--received a
nickname, expressive of the injuries they received.</p>

<p>Several contests, which happened at this time among the natives,
had brought many of the distant tribes down to Sydney, to be
spectators; some of whom observing the cattle in the colony, said
that they had seen many of the same kind in the woods. This
intelligence getting to the Governor, he ordered a more particular
enquiry to be made; and being satisfied as to the truth of the
report, and their track being clearly ascertained, his Excellency
determined to satisfy himself. He accordingly set off on the 27th of
November with a strong party; having travelled three days in a S.S.W.
direction from the settlement at Prospect Hill, he crossed Nepean
river, and, to his great surprise and satisfaction, he fell in with a
very fine herd of cattle, grazing in a rich luxuriant pasture. The
day was too far advanced to make an accurate survey of them, so he
halted for the night in a pleasant spot in the vicinity, expecting in
the morning to be gratified with a sight of the whole herd. A doubt
was started whether they were the progeny of those we had imported
from the Cape, or whether they were not of a longer standing; his
Excellency was therefore determined to satisfy their doubts, and
accordingly directed some of the party to endeavour to kill one of
the calves. This they were not able to effect; for, while lying in
wait to let the herd pass, which now consisted of upwards of
fourscore, they were furiously attacked by a young bull, which they
were obliged to kill in their own defence, This, however, answered
the purpose; for, as it was full grown, they had an opportunity of
satisfying their doubts respecting their identity, as being the
offspring of the cattle which were lost in June 1788. Being at this
time near forty miles from any of the settlements, a very small
quantity of the meat could be brought in; the remainder, to the great
regret of the party, was left to be devoured by wild dogs, &amp; c.
The country where they were found grazing was remarkably pleasant;
the group was richly covered with thick luxuriant grass; the trees
were thinly scattered, and free from underwood: several large plots
were embellished with ponds, covered with black swans and flocks of
ducks, the margins of which were beautifully fringed with variegated
shrubs, and the ground from these levels rose into hills of gradual
and easy ascent.</p>

<p>How these cattle came hither was easily accounted for. The two
bulls, and five cows, that strayed from the keeper in 1788, had
travelled, without interruption, in a western direction, until they
came to the banks of the river Nepean, where, finding the river
fordable, they arrived in a country well watered, and plentifully
supplied with rich pasture, from whence they had no inducement to
remove; and where they remained unmolested, as none of the natives
were found in their neighbourhood, and where they were likely to
remain, undisturbed securely to propagate their species. The
Governor, considering that it was of the greatest consequence to the
colony that their numbers should not be diminished, and that, if
permitted to continue thus in their wild state, they might hereafter,
like the cattle on the Spanish main, not only prove sufficient for
the consumption of the colony, but a source of commerce to the
inhabitants; he was therefore determined, as much as in his power, to
prevent any of them from being destroyed.</p>

<p>Bannalong, who returned with the Governor from England, on his
first arrival, conducted himself with a kind of hauteur and
superiority towards his sister and relations, but which was much
heightened towards his acquaintance and countrymen in general;--there
he was quite the man of consequence. He declared, with a magisterial
air, that he should no longer permit them to fight, and cut one
another's throats, as they had donet; that he should introduce peace
among them, and make them love each other. He desired, when they came
to see him at the Governor's, that they would be more cleanly in
their persons, and less brutal in their manners. He was much offended
at some little indelicacies which he observed in his sister, who came
in such haste to see him, with his little nephew at her back, that
she left all her parapharnalia behind her, and literally appeared in
her birth-day suit.</p>

<p>Bannalong had not travelled for nothing; on the contrary, he had
been an attentive observer of English manners, and particularly
conducted himself with great propriety at table. His dress was also
one of his primary concerns; and it was conjectured that he would not
very readily renounce the comforts of a civilized life, to resume the
precarious existence of a wandering savage. Immediately on his
arrival, he made enquiries after his wife Goroobarrooboolo, whom he
found cohabiting with Caruey. On presenting her with a smart gipsey
hat, and a rose--coloured petticoat and jacket, she made no scruple
of quitting her present lover, and returning to her quondam husband.
In a few days, however, she evinced the inconsistency of her nature;
for she was seen stripped of her finery, and walking totally
unincumbered of all kind of cloathing. Bannalong was also missing;
Caruey was sought after, but he was not in the settlement; a few days
developed the mystery, and we heard that he had been severely beaten
by Bannalong, who availed himself of some lessons which he had
acquired in England, and took his revenge, a-la Mendoza, to the great
annoyance of poor Caruey, who had much rather met him with the
weapons of the country, the club and the spear: However, he being
much younger and handsomer than the victor, the lady once more
changed her mind, and was resolved to follow the fortunes of Caruey.
Bannalong seemed perfectly satisfied with the beating he had given
his rival, and hinted that it was not worth his while to think about
the lady, but that he should look out and make a better choice.</p>

<p>Bannalong soon became weary of the restraint he was under at the
Governor's, and frequently absented himself, and went among his
former associates for days and weeks together; always taking care to
leave his cloaths behind him and to resume them when he re-appeared
before the Governor. He continued these savage excursions for about
three months, when a violent quarrel arose between him and his friend
Coalby; a combat ensued, in which he got so much the worst of it,
that he could not appear before the Governor till his wounds were
healed. He acquainted his Excellency of the misunderstanding, and
humbly requested that his clothes might be sent him, as also some
provisions, of which he was greatly in want.</p>

<p>On his return to the settlement, his countenance was much
disfigured; he had a wound on his mouth, which divided the upper lip,
and broke two of the teeth, which gave a disgusting appearance to his
face, and entirely altered his tone of voice. The source of his
quarrel with Coalby was as follows: Finding himself indifferently
received among the females, who did not much relish his European
attainments, and not being able to gain a partner to his mind by fair
means, he made an attack upon his friend's favourite, Booreea, in
which he was not only unsuccessful, but was punished for his breach
of friendship by Coalby, who sarcastically asked him if that conduct
was a specimen of English manners.</p>

<p>There being among the more decent class of prisoners, several who
were theatrically inclined, and being found to possess some merit,
the Governor acceded to the petition of Mr. Sparrow, for permission
to build a Theatre, which was accordingly completed on a very short
time, at the expence of about one hundred pounds sterling; and it was
opened, under his management, on Saturday the 16th of January, 1796,
with Dr. Young's tragedy of The Revenge, which was performed in a
much more respectable stile than could be expected. The house was
fitted up with some taste, and the dresses were by no means
despicable. In their license it was stated, that the slightest
impropriety would be noticed, and the indulgence now granted
immediately with-held. There was, however, more irregularity to be
apprehended from some of the audience than from the players. The
gallery was the largest part of the house, the nominal admission to
which was one shilling, the payment produced an evil which was not
foreseen, nor could well be prevented; for, in lieu of a shilling, as
much flour, wheat, or spirits, as the manager thought proper to
commute for the same, was often paid at the gallery door. It was
feared that this, like gaming, would furnish another inducement to
rob; and some of the most notorious of the convicts, ever on the
watch to exercise their talents for depredation, looked upon the
play-house as a grand desideratum, not by robbing the persons of the
audience of their purses or their watches, but by breaking into their
houses while the whole family were at the play; and this actually
happened on the second night of their performing.</p>

<p>This was not the first theatrical essay; on his Majesty's Birth
day, 1789, a party of the convicts performed the comedy of the
Recruiting Officer, in a hut fitted up for the purpose; but the then
infant state of the colony was unpropitious, and would not afford
sufficient leisure for the colonists to indulge in a regular series
of theatrical entertainments.</p>

<p>A soldier, of the name of Eades, much respected in the colony, in
collecting thatch to cover a hut, which he had just built for the
comfort of his family, overreaching himself, fell from a rock into
the river, and was unfortunately drowned, leaving a wife and four
children to bewail his loss; whereupon the players, with a liberality
which reflected great credit upon them, performed the tragedy of the
Fair Penitent, with a farce, for the benefit of the widow and
orphans. The house was crowded, and the receipts amounted to near
twenty pounds.</p>

<p>On the 18th of February, Mr. Muir found means to leave the colony,
on board the Otter, bound for the N. W. coast of America. He left
behind him a letter, in which he declared that he did not mean to
infringe the laws of his country, by withdrawing himself from the
colony, to return to any part of Great Britain, but that he should
endeavour to get to America, and there to practise at the bar as an
advocate, till his sentence should expire, when he should return to
his native country. Here he chiefly passed his time in literary
retirement, at a small pleasant house he had purchased, just without
the town.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the frequent attacks and depredations of the
natives in the neighbourhood of Hawkesbury River, and when it was
natural to suppose that self-preservation would have prompted the
settlers to unite for their mutual defence, they seldom or ever
evinced the smallest disposition to assist each other. This
disposition being reported to the Governor, he issued a public order,
directing that all people residing in the different settlements
should, on the first alarm, immediately repair to the assistance of
the persons attacked; and if it should be hereafter proved that any
person or persons withheld their assistance, upon any attack of the
natives, that they should be prosecuted, and punished accordingly. At
the same time, such as had fire-arms were strictly enjoined not to
fire at the natives on any account, but in their own defence, or that
of their neighbours. It had been intimated to the Governor, that the
two white men (Wilson and Knight) had been frequently seen with the
natives in their excursions, and were supposed to direct and assist
in the acts of hostility by which the settlers had lately suffered.
He therefore ordered them to be looked after, and apprehended as soon
as they were met with. These fellows were the occasion of the most
serious mischief, exhorting the natives not to fear us, and showing
them the inutility of our guns when once discharged, which soon
removed that terror fire arms were wont to occasion.</p>

<p>The crime of forgery was now introduced into the colony. A shop
being opened for the disposal of various articles imported in the
store--ships, &amp; c. and as orders on any of the officers, or
responsible people, were taken, the prisoners practised their
ingenuity, not only in counterfeiting dollars and rupees, but
absolutely forged drafts and notes. One forged note for ten guineas,
with the Commissary's name, was passed, but fortunately discovered.
The offenders were committed for trial, but not a stiver's worth of
the property was recovered.</p>

<p>In spite of every precaution that could be devised by Government,
robberies still continued to encrease. Captain Paterson's premises
were broken into, and a large property stolen from thence; a centinel
was stationed at the door, yet the thieves had the address to make a
hole in the wall at the back part of the building, through which they
conveyed the articles. Captain Townson's house was entered the
following night, and sixty pounds, in dollars and other property,
were taken away. His servants were suspected, as were Captain
Paterson's, but nothing could be proved upon them sufficient to
warrant their apprehension.</p>

<p>Street robberies were frequently committed. On the feast of St.
Patrick, two fellows, Matthew Farrell, and Richard Sutton (nick-named
the Newgate Bully,) had the audacity to a ault the night watch, on
being detected in the act of breaking into a house.</p>

<p>A criminal court being held in April, four prisoners were tried
for forgery, when James M'Carthy was capitally convicted, and
received sentence of death; the three others were acquitted. Other
prisoners were tried for plundering the stores, one of whom was found
guilty, viz. James Ashford, a lad, who had formerly been drummed out
of the military corps: He was sentenced to seven years hard labour at
Norfolk Island. A soldier was accused by an old man, a settler at the
river, of an unnatural crime, but was acquitted. Two people of the
stores were found guilty of stealing geese, the property of Mr.
Grimes, and sentenced to receive corporal punishment. Another, in the
same station, was sentenced to receive eight hundred lashes; and one
man, George Hyson, for an attempt to commit the abominable crime of
bestiality, was sentenced to stand in the pillory three times, an
hour each time, and receive 900 lashes.</p>

<p>Daily experience proved, that those people whose sentences had
expired were much greater evils than the other convicts. As no man
was at this time spared from the public works, the shortest absence
was noticed, and therefore we were well assured that the depredations
and thefts were the handyworks of the former gentry, and their
information was generally so accurate, that they never attempted a
house that was not an object of plunder; and wherever there was any
property, it was ten to one but they paid it a visit. It was
suspected that the domestics of the house must have aided and
assisted in these robberies, for the rogues always knew where to lay
their hands on the property, and it was observed that they never once
attempted the house of a poor individual.</p>

<p>There were also an amphibious kind of gentry, whose speculations
were not confined to Terra Firma; for few ships that entered the
harbour sailed from thence without receiving proofs of their address
and ingenuity. It behoved the officers of every ship to keep the
strictest guard over the people whom they permitted to come on board;
for it was very obvious that every ship was visited by certain
characters, to observe what kind of look-out they kept; many
instances of this kind occurred, although one might have supposed a
stranger would have been upon his guard, knowing what kind of people
they were going to admit as visitors. A large quantity of tobacco had
been stolen from the Bellona store-ship; half a barrel of gun-powder
out of the Britannia, at the very time the master was entertaining
some gentlemen from the settlement in the cabin. Mr. Page, the master
of the Hope, was robbed of several articles, and the buckles out of
his shoes, which were underneath his cot, wherein he lay asleep in
the cabin; and a bale of goods from the Experiment; with an infinity
of petty thefts of all descriptions.</p>

<p>In order to guard against this evil, it is necessary that masters
should attend to something like the following rules:--Never to permit
strangers to come on board without a certificate of leave; when on
board, to be careful not to suffer them to go below, nor to see where
any of the stores are stowed; never to permit a boat to come
along-side in the night, unless there should be an officer in her; in
that case, to make the boat push off, and lay upon her oars till his
business was finished, when they should be called along-side to take
him in. By these precautions, the greater part of these pilferings
might be prevented. The decks of the ships at present are thronged
with convicts, oftentimes of the most notorious characters in the
colony.</p>

<p>On the 4th of July, a seaman was shot at Sydney by a convict; and,
on the same day, John Fenlow, a settler at the river, shot his
servant. Fenlow and the convict were taken into custody, and were
ordered to be brought to immediate trial; but through the
carelessness of the jailor, Fenlow, though encumbered with heavy
irons, found means to make his escape from the cells, and was not
retaken for near a month, when some of the natives discovered him
lurking near his own habitation at the river, and giving information
thereof, he was apprehended, and properly secured.</p>

<p>A criminal court of judicature being assembled early in the month
of August, the following offenders were brought to trial:--Four
convicts, for a burglary in the house of William Miller, but who,
through a defect in the evidence, were acquitted. David Lloyd was
tried for the wilful murder of John Smith, a seaman; it appeared that
the seaman had gone to the house of Mr. Payne, the prisoner's master,
in a state of intoxication, for the purpose of taking away, from a
female convict-servant belonging to Mr. Payne, with whom the sailor
cohabited during their passage, some clothes which he had given her.
A riot, the natural consequence of such a proceeding, immediately
ensued; and the prisoner endeavoured to make it appear that he had
been compelled, in his own defence, to fire the pistol at the seaman.
The court admitted that the prisoner had not any malice against the
deceased, which was necessary to constitute the crime of murder; and
therefore found him guilty of manslaughter, and sentenced him to
receive six hundred lashes.--John Fenlow, for the wilful murder of
his servant, David Lane; this charge was fully proved, and the
prisoner received sentence of death. Farrell, who, with Sutton, the
Newgate Bully, assaulted the watch on St. Patrick's Day last, when
the latter received a wound on the temple, of which he languished and
died: the watchmen were now brought up to account for his death; this
they did to the satisfaction of the court, and were discharged. Four
vagabonds, who had repeatedly broken out of prison, and ran away from
the jail gang--a party, who, from being hardened and notorious
offenders, were kept at work in irons, and when the labour of the day
was over, were locked up in the prison till they returned to their
daily task--were tried as incorrigible rogues, and sentenced to three
years hard labour in Norfolk Island, which being so small, they could
not so easily elude the vigilance of the overseers. One man was tried
for a rape, but acquitted. Fenlow was tried on the Saturday, and
executed on the following Monday, and his body was delivered to the
surgeons for dissection. It could scarcely be supposed that curiosity
would have prevailed so strong, in a society composed as this is; for
it was no sooner signified by the surgeons that the body was ready
for inspection, than the hospital was crowded with men, women, and
children, to the number of several hundreds, none of whom seemed, in
the smallest degree, to betray any horror or concern at the dreadful
spectacle before them.</p>

<p>In consequence of these enormities, several judicious regulations
were made. All persons who had been struck off the stores, and of
course did not labour for the public, were ordered forthwith to
appear at Sydney, in order to their being mustered, and examined
relative to their respective terms of transportation; when
certificates were to be given to such as were regularly discharged
from the Commissary's books, and the settlers were directed not to
employ any but such as could produce this certificate. Frequent
visits were to be made by the magistrates, for the purpose of
settling such differences as might arise among the settlers and other
persons; and the Governor declared that he would himself inspect
their conduct from time to time, and severely punish those who held
his orders in contempt, by affording shelter and encouragement to the
thieves and vagabonds who were rambling up and down the country.</p>

<p>These regulations were made as public as possible; and there being
a printing-press in the settlement, under the management of one
Hughes, large bills of the proclamation were printed, and dispersed
throughout the different districts, that none might plead ignorance;
and the town of Sydney was soon filled with people from the
surrounding settlements, who came to the Judge-Advocate for
certificates of their having served their terms, agreeably to their
respective sentences. Among these were many who had been absent a
long time, and whose terms were yet unexpired; some who had escaped
from prison, and others who were for life, had changed their names,
in order to impose on the officers. By the activity of the overseers,
and a strict investigation of the necessary books and papers, they
were in general detected in the imposition, and were sent to hard
labour in the jail gang, which now encreased in numbers every day.
Two notorious offenders, Luke Normington and Richard Elliott, were
detected in robbing the Commissary's stock-yard. These were sent to
the jail-gangs; also one Sharpless, a convict, who, after marrying
the most deformed and ugly woman in the whole colony, took it into
his head to be jealous of her, and gave her so dreadful a beating,
that her life was in the utmost danger.</p>

<p>The colony now began to assume the appearance of being able to
supply itself with respect to the necessaries of life, there being
near six thousand acres of land in cultivation, and all the stores
abundantly filled. In the houses of individuals were to be found most
of the comforts, and not a few of the luxuries of life, for which we
were indebted to our intercourse with India; and our early years of
toil, famine, and difficulty, were now exchanged for an aera of
plenty, ease, and pleasure.</p>

<p>During this time, my domestic concerns improved imperceptibly, so
that my situation was equal, if not preferable, to most of the
settlers here; having a flock of sheep, consisting of thirty-eight,
with fourteen goats, a most excellent milch cow, half a dozen
breeding sows, and a very plentiful stock of poultry; and, to add to
the comforts of my situation, in the month of September, 1796, his
Excellency, Governor Hunter, was pleased to present me with an
absolute pardon, under the great seal of the colony, and appointed me
a principal superintendant of the district of Parramatta, with a
permanent salary of fifty pounds a year, in the room of Mr. Thomas
Clark, who was returning to England. Hitherto my situation had been
only provisional. The Governor was pleased to compliment me on the
"faithful discharge of my duty, the integrity and uniform uprightness
of my conduct, and my general behaviour during my whole residence in
the colony, which," he said, "perfectly obliterated every trace of my
former indiscretions." It was such a friend as this to whom I alluded
on a solemn occasion, previous to my leaving England;--this was the
"generous and powerful man" I so much needed in my youthful days, to
come forward and say, "Barrington, you have some abilities, which may
be of service to yourself and the public--I feel for your situation,
and will place you in a condition to try the sincerity of your
intentions; and as long as you act with diligence and integrity, you
shall not want for "countenance and relief." The above flattering
eulogiums of his excellency, Governor Hunter, the station I fill, and
the consideration and friendship I exprience from the most
respectable persons in the colony, prove that, in my address to Baron
Eyre, I was ingenuous and sincere.</p>

August            John Fenlow                  Ditto               Death

1. This was the first man that was punished with death; his confederates
were pardoned on condition of being transported to Norfolk Island.

2. Pardoned on condition of becoming the publick executioner of the colony.

3. The impostor, who pretended that he had discovered a gold mine; See part I.

4. This was a robbery of a most serious nature.--The safety of the
provisions was an object of the greatest consequence. One morning as
the commissary went to inspect the store, he found a key broken in the
lock that secured the principal door. On entering the storehouse he found
that it had been plundered of various articles. It was suggested that the
broken key might lead to the detection of the offenders,--a smith, to
whom it was sent, recognised his workmanship, and declared that he had
made it for one Hunt, a soldier. He was accordingly apprehended, but as
it was supposed there were several accomplices, he was admitted an
evidence for the crown. He accused six other soldiers of being concerned
in depredations on the stores for some months past: in liquors and
provisions to a large amount.--They had sworn by the most sacred
oaths to be faithful to each other; They had agreed that when either of
them should be placed centinel at the store, some of the gang, during the
night, were to let themselves into the store, and take away as much of the
stores as they could. When the patrol went his rounds to visit the store,
he found it in a state of apparent security, and the centinel careful and
attentive to his duty. Unfortunately for them, the night preceding the
discovery, one of the party intended while he was centinel to have paid a
visit to the provisions unknown to his associates. While he was in the act
of unlocking the door, he heard the patroll coming. In attempting to turn
the key again he over-shot the lock; being unable to extricate the key he
broke it short off, and the wards were found as before mentioned. On his
information the six soldiers were taken into custody, and the fact being
clearly proved, they were all found guilty, and executed.

5. This man appearing on his trial to be labouring under a mental
derangement he was accordingly acquitted. It was afterwards notorious
that he had artfully feigned madness, in order to screen himself from
punishment. He gained great credit among his companions for the
dexterity with which he play'd his part.--He was a notorious char&aacute;cter,
continually in one scrape or another; and was reprieved under the
gallows in England.

6. He was recommended by the court for mercy, and was transported to
Norfolk Island

7. She pleaded pregnancy, but undergoing an examination by a jury of
twelve of the discreetest women in the colony, they brought a verdict in
the negative, and she was executed pursuant to her sentence.

8. This man was reprieved upon condition of residing for life on Norfolk
Island.

9. Pardoned on account of his youth, being only sixteen.

10. Pardoned, being only fourteen.

11.  This was a most infamous transaction, six ruffians brutally attacking a
single woman.

12. Raynor was included in an act of grace, and received a pardon on the
arrival of governor Hunter.

13. Some favourable circumstances appearing in his behalf after the trial,
he was reprieved.

14. There were eight wretches tried for this brutal attack on one woman,
five of whom, the evidence being rather defective, escaped punishment.
The difficulty of bringing the people to give evidence against each other
was insurmountable, and by far the greater part of the acquittals were
occasioned by a wilful suppression of evidence.
Received a pardon on the condition of being transported to Norfolk
Island.

15. He was indicted for murder, but the court adjudged him guilty of
manslaughter only. Numberless trifling offences were daily committed, but it
would have been an endless task to have brough every one to trial; petty
offenders generally underwent a summary examination, and, if found
guilty, they were punished on the spot.
