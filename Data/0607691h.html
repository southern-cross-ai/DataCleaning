<h2><a name="1_WE_LAND_UPON_A_NEW_WORLD" id=
"WE_LAND_UPON_A_NEW_WORLD"></a>1. WE LAND UPON A NEW WORLD</h2>

<p>In writing the story of our adventures in the Moon I, Thomas
Stubbins, secretary to John Dolittle, M.D. (and son of Jacob Stubbins,
the cobbler of Puddleby-on-the-Marsh), find myself greatly puzzled. It
is not an easy task, remembering day by day and hour by hour those
crowded and exciting weeks. It is true I made many notes for the
Doctor, books full of them. But that information was nearly all of a
highly scientific kind. And I feel that I should tell the story here
not for the scientist so much as for the general reader. And it is in
that I am perplexed.</p>

<p>For the story could be told in many ways. People are so different in
what they want to know about a voyage. I had thought at one time that
Jip could help me; and after reading him some chapters as I had first
set them down I asked for his opinion. I discovered he was mostly
interested in whether we had seen any rats in the Moon. I found I could
not tell him. I didn't remember seeing any; and yet I am sure there
must have been some&mdash;or some sort of creature like a rat.</p>

<p>Then I asked Gub-Gub. And what he was chiefly concerned to hear was
the kind of vegetables we had fed on. (Dab-Dab snorted at me for my
pains and said I should have known better than to ask him.) I tried my
mother. She wanted to know how we had managed when our underwear wore
out&mdash;and a whole lot of other matters about our living conditions,
hardly any of which I could answer. Next I went to Matthew Mugg. And
the things he wanted to learn were worse than either my mother's or
Jip's: Were there any shops in the Moon? What were the dogs and cats
like? The good Cats'-meat-Man seemed to have imagined it a place not
very different from Puddleby or the East End of London.</p>

<p>No, trying to get at what most people wanted to read concerning the
Moon did not bring me much profit. I couldn't seem to tell them any of
the things they were most anxious to know. It reminded me of the first
time I had come to the Doctor's house, hoping to be hired as his
assistant, and dear old Polynesia the parrot had questioned me. "Are
you a good noticer?" she had asked. I had always thought I
was&mdash;pretty good, anyhow. But now I felt I had been a very poor
noticer. For it seemed I hadn't noticed any of the things I should have
done to make the story of our voyage interesting to the ordinary
public.</p>

<p>The trouble was of course <i>attention</i>. Human attention is like
butter: you can only spread it so thin and no thinner. If you try to
spread it over too many things at once you just don't remember them.
And certainly during all our waking hours upon the Moon there was so
much for our ears and eyes and minds to take in it is a wonder, I often
think, that any clear memories at all remain.</p>

<p>The one who could have been of most help to me in writing my
impressions of the Moon was Jamaro Bumblelily, the giant moth who
carried us there. But as he was nowhere near me when I set to work upon
this book I decided I had better not consider the particular wishes of
Jip, Gub-Gub, my mother, Matthew or any one else, but set the story
down in my own way. Clearly the tale must be in any case an imperfect,
incomplete one. And the only thing to do is to go forward with it, step
by step, to the best of my recollection, from where the great insect
hovered, with our beating hearts pressed close against his broad back,
over the near and glowing landscape of the Moon.</p>

<p>Any one could tell that the moth knew every detail of the country we
were landing in. Planing, circling and diving, he brought his
wide-winged body very deliberately down towards a little valley fenced
in with hills. The bottom of this, I saw as we drew nearer, was level,
sandy and dry.</p>

<p>The hills struck one at once as unusual. In fact all the mountains
as well (for much greater heights could presently be seen towering away
in the dim greenish light behind the nearer, lower ranges) had one
peculiarity. The tops seemed to be cut off and cup-like. The Doctor
afterwards explained to me that they were extinct volcanoes. Nearly all
these peaks had once belched fire and molten lava but were now cold and
dead. Some had been fretted and worn by winds and weather and time into
quite curious shapes; and yet others had been filled up or half buried
by drifting sand so that they had nearly lost the appearance of
volcanoes. I was reminded of "The Whispering Rocks" which we had seen
in Spidermonkey Island. And though this scene was different in many
things, no one who had ever looked upon a volcanic landscape before
could have mistaken it for anything else.</p>

<p>The little valley, long and narrow, which we were apparently making
for did not show many signs of life, vegetable or animal. But we were
not disturbed by that. At least the Doctor wasn't. He had seen a tree
and he was satisfied that before long he would find water, vegetation
and creatures.</p>

<p>At last when the moth had dropped within twenty feet of the ground
he spread his wings motionless and like a great kite gently touched the
sand, in hops at first, then ran a little, braced himself and came to a
standstill.</p>

<p><i>We had landed on the Moon!</i></p>

<p>By this time we had had a chance to get a little more used to the
new air. But before we made any attempt to "go ashore" the Doctor
thought it best to ask our gallant steed to stay where he was a while,
so that we could still further accustom ourselves to the new atmosphere
and conditions.</p>

<p>This request was willingly granted. Indeed, the poor insect himself,
I imagine, was glad enough to rest a while. From somewhere in his
packages John Dolittle produced an emergency ration of chocolate which
he had been saving up. All four of us munched in silence, too hungry
and too awed by our new surroundings to say a word.</p>

<p>The light changed unceasingly. It reminded me of the Northern
Lights, the Aurora Borealis. You would gaze at the mountains above you,
then turn away a moment, and on looking back find everything that had
been pink was now green, the shadows that had been violet were
rose.</p>

<p>Breathing was still kind of difficult. We were compelled for the
moment to keep the "moon-bells" handy. These were the great
orange-coloured flowers that the moth had brought down for us. It was
their perfume (or gas) that had enabled us to cross the airless belt
that lay between the Moon and the Earth. A fit of coughing was always
liable to come on if one left them too long. But already we felt that
we could in time get used to this new air and soon do without the bells
altogether.</p>

<p>The gravity too was very confusing. It required hardly any effort to
rise from a sitting position to a standing one. Walking was no effort
at all&mdash;for the muscles&mdash;but for the lungs it was another
question. The most extraordinary sensation was jumping. The least
little spring from the ankles sent you flying into the air in the most
fantastic fashion. If it had not been for this problem of breathing
properly (which the Doctor seemed to feel we should approach with great
caution on account of its possible effect on the heart) we would all
have given ourselves up to this most light-hearted feeling which took
possession of us. I remember, myself, singing songs&mdash;the melody
was somewhat indistinct on account of a large mouthful of
chocolate&mdash;and I was most anxious to get down off the moth's back
and go bounding away across the hills and valleys to explore this new
world.</p>

<p>But I realize now that John Dolittle was very wise in making us
wait. He issued orders (in the low whispers which we found necessary in
this new clear air) to each and all of us that for the present the
flowers were <i>not</i> to be left behind for a single moment.</p>

<p>They were cumbersome things to carry but we obeyed orders. No ladder
was needed now to descend by. The gentlest jump sent one flying off the
insect's back to the ground where you landed from a twenty-five-foot
drop with ease and comfort. Zip! The spring was made. And we were
wading in the sands of a new world.</p>

<h2><a name="2_THE_LAND_OF_COLOURS_AND_PERFUMES" id=
"THE_LAND_OF_COLOURS_AND_PERFUMES"></a>2. THE LAND OF COLOURS AND
PERFUMES</h2>

<p>We were after all, when you come to think of it, a very odd party,
this, which made the first landing on a new world. But in a great many
ways it was a peculiarly good combination. First of all, Polynesia: she
was the kind of bird which one always supposed would exist under any
conditions, drought, floods, fire or frost. I've no doubt that at that
time in my boyish way I exaggerated Polynesia's adaptability and
endurance. But even to this day I can never quite imagine any
circumstances in which that remarkable bird would perish. If she could
get a pinch of seed (of almost any kind) and a sip of water two or
three times a week she would not only carry on quite cheerfully but
would scarcely even remark upon the strange nature or scantiness of the
rations. Then Chee-Chee: he was not so easily provided for in the
matter of food. But he always seemed to be able to provide for himself
anything that was lacking. I have never known a better forager than
Chee-Chee. When every one was hungry he could go off into an entirely
new forest and just by smelling the wild fruits and nuts he could tell
if they were safe to eat. How he did this even John Dolittle could
never find out. Indeed Chee-Chee himself didn't know.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="002"></a><img
src="0607691h-images/002.png" width="500" height="496" alt=
"&quot;By smelling he could tell if they were safe to eat&quot;" title=
""> <span class="caption">"By smelling he could tell if they were safe

<p>Then myself: I had no scientific qualifications but I had learned
how to be a good secretary on natural history expeditions and I knew a
good deal about the Doctor's ways.</p>

<p>Finally there was the Doctor. No naturalist has ever gone afield to
grasp at the secrets of a new land with the qualities John Dolittle
possessed. He never claimed to know anything, beforehand, for certain.
He came to new problems with a childlike innocence which made it easy
for himself to learn and the others to teach.</p>

<p>Yes, it was a strange party we made up. Most scientists would have
laughed at us no doubt. Yet we had many things to recommend us that no
expedition ever carried before.</p>

<p>As usual the Doctor wasted no time in preliminaries. Most other
explorers would have begun by planting a flag and singing national
anthems. Not so with John Dolittle. As soon as he was sure that we were
all ready he gave the order to march. And without a word Chee-Chee and
I (with Polynesia who perched herself on my shoulder) fell in behind
him and started off.</p>

<p>I have never known a time when it was harder to shake loose the
feeling of living in a dream as those first few hours we spent on the
Moon. The knowledge that we were treading a new world never before
visited by Man, added to this extraordinary feeling caused by the
gravity, of lightness, of walking on air, made you want every minute to
have some one tell you that you were actually awake and in your right
senses. For this reason I kept constantly speaking to the Doctor or
Chee-Chee or Polynesia&mdash;even when I had nothing particular to say.
But the uncanny booming of my own voice every time I opened my lips and
spoke above the faintest whisper merely added to the dream-like effect
of the whole experience.</p>

<p>However, little by little, we grew accustomed to it. And certainly
there was no lack of new sights and impressions to occupy our minds.
Those strange and ever changing colours in the landscape were most
bewildering, throwing out your course and sense of direction entirely.
The Doctor had brought a small pocket compass with him. But on
consulting it, we saw that it was even more confused than we were. The
needle did nothing but whirl around in the craziest fashion and no
amount of steadying would persuade it to stay still.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="003"></a><img
src="0607691h-images/003.png" width="500" height="499" alt=
"&quot;The Doctor had brought a compass&quot;" title=""> <span class=
"caption">"The Doctor had brought a compass"</span></div>

<p>Giving that up, the Doctor determined to rely on his moon maps and
his own eyesight and bump of locality. He was heading towards where he
had seen that tree&mdash;which was at the end of one of the ranges. But
all the ranges in this section seemed very much alike. The maps did not
help us in this respect in the least. To our rear we could see certain
peaks which we thought we could identify on the charts. But ahead
nothing fitted in at all. This made us feel surer than ever that we
were moving toward the Moon's other side which earthly eyes had never
seen.</p>

<p>"It is likely enough, Stubbins," said the Doctor as we strode
lightly forward over loose sand which would ordinarily have been very
heavy going, "that it is <i>only</i> on the other side that water
exists. Which may partly be the reason why astronomers never believed
there was any here at all."</p>

<p>For my part I was so on the look-out for extraordinary sights that
it did not occur to me, till the Doctor spoke of it, that the
temperature was extremely mild and agreeable. One of the things that
John Dolittle had feared was that we should find a heat that was
unbearable or a cold that was worse than Arctic. But except for the
difficulty of the strange new quality of the air, no human could have
asked for a nicer climate. A gentle steady wind was blowing and the
temperature seemed to remain almost constantly the same.</p>

<p>We looked about everywhere for tracks. As yet we knew very little of
what animal life to expect. But the loose sand told nothing, not even
to Chee-Chee, who was a pretty experienced hand at picking up tracks of
the most unusual kind.</p>

<p>Of odours and scents there were plenty&mdash;most of them very
delightful flower perfumes which the wind brought to us from the other
side of the mountain ranges ahead. Occasionally a very disagreeable one
would come, mixed up with the pleasant scents. But none of them, except
that of the moon bells the moth had brought with us, could we
recognize.</p>

<p>On and on we went for miles, crossing ridge after ridge and still no
glimpse did we get of the Doctor's tree. Of course crossing the ranges
was not nearly as hard travelling as it would have been on Earth.
Jumping and bounding both upward and downward was extraordinarily easy.
Still, we had brought a good deal of baggage with us and all of us were
pretty heavy-laden; and after two and a half hours of travel we began
to feel a little discouraged. Polynesia then volunteered to fly ahead
and reconnoitre, but this the Doctor was loath to have her do. For some
reason he wanted us all to stick together for the present.</p>

"&quot;Jumping was extraordinarily easy&quot;" title=""> <span class=
"caption">"Jumping was extraordinarily easy"</span></div>

<p>However, after another half-hour of going he consented to let her
fly straight up so long as she remained in sight, to see if she could
spy out the tree's position from a greater height.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h2><a name="3_THIRST" id="THIRST"></a>3. THIRST!</h2>

<p>So we rested on our bundles a spell while Polynesia gave an
imitation of a soaring vulture and straight above our heads climbed and
climbed. At about a thousand feet she paused and circled. Then slowly
came down again. The Doctor, watching her, grew impatient at her speed.
I could not quite make out why he was so unwilling to have her away
from his side, but I asked no questions.</p>

<p>Yes, she had seen the tree, she told us, but it still seemed a long
way off. The Doctor wanted to know why she had taken so long in coming
down and she said she had been making sure of her bearings so that she
would be able to act as guide. Indeed, with the usual accuracy of
birds, she had a very clear idea of the direction we should take. And
we set off again, feeling more at ease and confident.</p>

<p>The truth of it was of course that seen from a great height, as the
tree had first appeared to us, the distance had seemed much less than
it actually was. Two more things helped to mislead us. One, that the
moon air, as we now discovered, made everything look nearer than it
actually was in spite of the soft dim light. And the other was that we
had supposed the tree to be one of ordinary earthly size and had made
an unconscious guess at its distance in keeping with a fair-sized oak
or elm. Whereas when we did actually reach it we found it to be
unimaginably huge.</p>

<p>I shall never forget that tree. It was our first experience of moon
life, <i>in</i> the Moon. Darkness was coming on when we finally halted
beneath it. When I say <i>darkness</i> I mean that strange kind of
twilight which was the nearest thing to night which we ever saw in the
Moon. The tree's height, I should say, would be at least three hundred
feet and the width of it across the trunk a good forty or fifty. Its
appearance in general was most uncanny. The whole design of it was
different from any tree I have ever seen. Yet there was no mistaking it
for anything else. It seemed&mdash;how shall I describe
it?&mdash;<i>alive</i>. Poor Chee-Chee was so scared of it his hair
just stood up on the nape of his neck and it was a long time before the
Doctor and I persuaded him to help us pitch camp beneath its
boughs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 496px;"><a name="005"></a><img
src="0607691h-images/005.png" width="496" height="500" alt=
"&quot;It was different from any tree I have ever seen&quot;" title="">
<span class="caption">"It was different from any tree I have ever
seen"</span></div>

<p>Indeed we were a very subdued party that prepared to spend its first
night on the Moon. No one knew just what it was that oppressed us but
we were all conscious of a definite feeling of disturbance. The wind
still blew&mdash;in that gentle, steady way that the moon winds always
blew. The light was clear enough to see outlines by, although most of
the night the Earth was invisible, and there was no reflection
whatever.</p>

<p>I remember how the Doctor, while we were unpacking and laying out
the rest of our chocolate ration for supper, kept glancing uneasily up
at those strange limbs of the tree overhead.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 495px;"><a name="006"></a><img
src="0607691h-images/006.png" width="495" height="500" alt=
"&quot;The Doctor kept glancing up uneasily&quot;" title=""> <span
class="caption">"The Doctor kept glancing up uneasily"</span></div>

<p>Of course it was the wind that was moving them&mdash;no doubt of
that at all. Yet the wind was so deadly regular and even. And the
movement of the boughs wasn't regular at all. That was the weird part
of it. It almost seemed as though the tree were doing some moving on
its own, like an animal chained by its feet in the ground. And still
you could never be sure&mdash;because, after all, the wind <i>was</i>
blowing all the time.</p>

<p>And besides, it moaned. Well, we knew trees moaned in the wind at
home. But this one did it differently&mdash;it didn't seem in keeping
with that regular even wind which we felt upon our faces.</p>

<p>I could see that even the worldly-wise practical Polynesia was
perplexed and upset. And it took a great deal to disturb her. Yet a
bird's senses towards trees and winds are much keener than a man's. I
kept hoping she would venture into the branches of the tree; but she
didn't. And as for Chee-Chee, also a natural denizen of the forest, no
power on earth, I felt sure, would persuade him to investigate the
mysteries of this strange specimen of a Vegetable Kingdom we were as
yet only distantly acquainted with.</p>

<p>After supper was despatched, the Doctor kept me busy for some hours
taking down notes. There was much to be recorded of this first day in a
new world. The temperature; the direction and force of the wind; the
time of our arrival&mdash;as near as it could be guessed; the air
pressure (he had brought along a small barometer among his instruments)
and many other things which, while they were dry stuff for the ordinary
mortal, were highly important for the scientist.</p>

<p>Often and often I have wished that I had one of those memories that
seem to be able to recall all impressions no matter how small and
unimportant. For instance, I have often wanted to remember exactly that
first awakening on the Moon. We had all been weary enough with
excitement and exercise, when we went to bed, to sleep soundly. All I
can remember of my waking up is spending at least ten minutes working
out where I was. And I doubt if I could have done it even then if I had
not finally realized that John Dolittle was awake ahead of me and
already pottering around among his instruments, taking readings.</p>

<p>The immediate business now on hand was food. There was literally
nothing for breakfast. The Doctor began to regret his hasty departure
from the moth. Indeed it was only now, many, many hours after we had
left him in our unceremonious haste to find the tree and explore the
new world, that we realized that we had not as yet seen any signs of
animal life. Still it seemed a long way to go back and consult him; and
it was by no means certain that he would still be there,</p>

<p>Just the same, we needed food, and food we were going to find.
Hastily we bundled together what things we had unpacked for the night's
camping. Which way to go? Clearly if we had here reached one tree,
there must be some direction in which others lay, where we could find
that water which the Doctor was so sure must exist. But we could scan
the horizon with staring eyes or telescope as much as we wished and not
another leaf of a tree could we see.</p>

<p>This time without waiting to be ordered Polynesia soared into the
air to do a little scouting.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="007"></a><img
src="0607691h-images/007.png" width="500" height="500" alt=
"&quot;Polynesia soared into the air&quot;" title=""> <span class=
"caption">"Polynesia soared into the air"</span></div>

<p>"Well," she said on her return, "I don't see any actual trees at
all. The beastly landscape is more like the Sahara Desert than any
scenery I've ever run into. But over there behind that higher range-the
one with the curious hat-shaped peak in the middle&mdash;you see the
one I mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Doctor. "I see. Go on."</p>

<p>"Well, behind that there is a dark horizon different from any other
quarter. I won't swear it is trees. But myself, I feel convinced that
there is something else there besides sand. We had better get moving.
It is no short walk."</p>

<p>Indeed it <i>was</i> no short walk. It came to be a forced march or
race between us and starvation. On starting out we had not foreseen
anything of the kind. Going off without breakfast was nothing after
all. Each one of us had done that before many a time. But as hour after
hour went by and still the landscape remained a desert of rolling
sand-dunes, hills and dead dry volcanoes, our spirits fell lower and
lower.</p>

<p>This was one of the times when I think I saw John Dolittle really at
his best. I know, although I had not questioned him, that he had
already been beset with anxiety over several matters on the first steps
of our march. Later he spoke of them to me: not at the time. And as
conditions grew worse, as hunger gnawed at our vitals and the most
terrible thirst parched our tongues&mdash;as strength and vitality
began to give way and mere walking became the most terrible hardship,
the Doctor grew cheerier and cheerier. He didn't crack dry jokes in an
irritating way either. But by some strange means he managed to keep the
whole party in good mood. If he told a funny story it was always at the
right time and set us all laughing at our troubles. In talking to him
afterwards about this I learned that he had, when a young man, been
employed on more than one exploration trip to keep the expedition in
good humour. It was, he said, the only way he could persuade the chief
to take him, since at that time he had no scientific training to
recommend him.</p>

<p>Anyway, I sincerely doubt whether our party would have held out if
it had not been for his sympathetic and cheering company. The agonies
of thirst were something new to me. Every step I thought must be my
last.</p>

<p>Finally at what seemed to be the end of our second day, I vaguely
heard Polynesia saying something about "Forests ahead!" I imagine I
must have been half delirious by then. I still staggered along, blindly
following the others. I know we <i>did</i> reach water because before I
fell and dozed away into a sort of half faint I remember Chee-Chee
trickling something marvellously cool between my lips out of a cup made
from a folded leaf.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h2><a name="4_CHEE-CHEE_THE_HERO" id="CHEE-CHEE_THE_HERO"></a>4.
CHEE-CHEE THE HERO</h2>

<p>When I awoke I felt very much ashamed of myself. What an explorer!
The Doctor was moving around already&mdash;and, of course, Chee-Chee
and Polynesia. John Dolittle came to my side immediately he saw I was
awake.</p>

<p>As though he knew the thoughts that were in my mind he at once
started to reprimand me for feeling ashamed of my performance. He
pointed out that after all Chee-Chee and Polynesia were accustomed to
travelling in hot dry climates and that so, for that matter, was he
himself.</p>

<p>"Taken all in all, Stubbins," said he, "your own performance has
been extremely good. You made the trip, the whole way, and only
collapsed when relief was in sight. No one could ask for more than
that. I have known many experienced explorers who couldn't have done
nearly as well. It was a hard lap&mdash;a devilish hard lap. You were
magnificent. Sit up and have some breakfast. Thank goodness, we've
reached food at last!"</p>

<p>Weak and frowsty, I sat up. Arranged immediately around me was a
collection of what I later learned were fruits. The reliable Chee-Chee,
scared though he might be of a moving tree or a whispering wind, had
served the whole party with that wonderful sense of his for scenting
out wild foodstuffs. Not one of the strange courses on the bill of fare
had I or the Doctor seen before. But if Chee-Chee said they were safe
we knew we need not fear.</p>

<p>Some of the fruits were as big as a large trunk; some as small as a
walnut. But, starving as we were, we just dived in and ate and ate and
ate. Water there was too, gathered in the shells of enormous nuts and
odd vessels made from twisted leaves. Never has a breakfast tasted so
marvellous as did that one of fruits which I could not name.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="009"></a><img
src="0607691h-images/009.png" width="500" height="498" alt=
"&quot;Some of the fruits were as big as a trunk&quot;" title=""> <span
class="caption">"Some of the fruits were as big as a

<p>Chee-Chee!&mdash;Poor little timid Chee-Chee, who conquered your own
fears and volunteered to go ahead of us alone, into the jungle to find
food when our strength was giving out. To the world you were just an
organ-grinder's monkey. But to us whom you saved from starvation, when
terror beset you at every step, you will for ever be ranked high in the
list of the great heroes of all time. Thank goodness we had you with
us! Our bones might to-day be mouldering in the sands of the Moon if it
had not been for your untaught science, your jungle skill&mdash;and,
above all, your courage that overcame your fear!</p>

<p>Well, to return: as I ate these strange fruits and sipped the water
that brought life back I gazed upward and saw before me a sort of
ridge. On its level top a vegetation, a kind of tangled forest,
flourished; and trailing down from this ridge were little outposts of
the Vegetable Kingdom, groups of bushes and single trees, that
scattered and dribbled away in several directions from the main mass.
Why and how that lone tree survived so far away we could never
satisfactorily explain. The nearest John Dolittle could come to it was
that some underground spring supplied it with enough water or moisture
to carry on. Yet there can be no doubt that to have reached such
enormous proportions it must have been there hundreds&mdash;perhaps
thousands&mdash;of years. Anyway, it is a good thing for us it
<i>was</i> there. If it had not been, as a pointer towards this
habitable quarter of the Moon&mdash;it is most likely our whole
expedition would have perished.</p>

<p>When the Doctor and I had finished our mysterious breakfast we
started to question Chee-Chee about the forest from which he had
produced the food we had eaten.</p>

<p>"I don't know how I did it," said Chee-Chee when we asked him. "I
just shut my eyes most of the time&mdash;terribly afraid. I passed
trees, plants, creepers, roots. I smelt&mdash;Goodness! I too was
hungry, remember. I smelt hard as I could. And soon of course I spotted
food, fruits. I climbed a tree&mdash;half the time with my eyes shut.
Then I see some monster, golly! What a jungle&mdash;different from any
monkey ever see before&mdash;Woolly, woolly!&mdash;Ooh, ooh! All the
same, nuts smell good. Catch a few. Chase down the tree. Run some more.
Smell again. Good!&mdash;Up another tree. Different fruit, good just
the same. Catch a few. Down again. Run home. On the way smell good
root. Same as ginger&mdash;only better. Dig a little. Keep eyes
shut&mdash;don't want to see monster. Catch a piece of root. Run all
the way home. Here I am. Finish!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="010"></a><img
src="0607691h-images/010.png" width="500" height="496" alt=
"&quot;'I climbed a tree'&quot;" title=""> <span class="caption">"'I

<p>Well, dear old Chee-Chee's story was descriptive of his own heroic
adventures but it did not give us much idea of the moon forest which we
were to explore. Nevertheless, rested and fit, we now felt much more
inclined to look into things ourselves.</p>

<p>Leaving what luggage we had brought with us from our original
landing point, we proceeded towards the line of trees at the summit of
the bluff, about four miles ahead of us. We now felt that we could find
our way back without much difficulty to the two last camps we had
established.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="011"></a><img
src="0607691h-images/011.png" width="500" height="498" alt=
"&quot;We approached the bluff on whose brow the vegetation flourished&quot;"
 title=""> <span class="caption">"We approached the bluff on whose brow
the vegetation flourished"</span></div>

<p>The going was about the same, loose sand&mdash;only that as we
approached the bluff we found the sand firmer to the tread.</p>

<p>On the way up the last lap towards the vegetation line we were out
of view of the top itself. Often the going was steep. All the way I had
the feeling that we were about to make new and great
discoveries&mdash;that for the first time we were to learn something
important about the true nature of the mysterious Moon.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h2><a name="5_ON_THE_PLATEAU" id="ON_THE_PLATEAU"></a>5. ON THE
PLATEAU</h2>

<p>Indeed our first close acquaintance with the forests of the Moon was
made in quite a dramatic manner. If it had been on a stage it could not
have been arranged better for effect. Suddenly as our heads topped the
bluff we saw a wall of jungle some mile or so ahead of us. It would
take a very long time to describe those trees in detail. It wasn't that
there were so many kinds but each one was so utterly different from any
tree we had seen on the Earth. And yet, curiously enough, they did
remind you of vegetable forms you had seen, but not of trees.</p>

<p>For instance, there was one whole section, several square miles in
extent apparently, that looked exactly like ferns. Another reminded me
of a certain flowering plant (I can't recall the name of it) which
grows a vast number of small blossoms on a flat surface at the top. The
stems are a curious whitish green. This moon tree was <i>exactly</i>
the same, only nearly a thousand times as big. The denseness of the
foliage (or flowering) at the top was so compact and solid that we
later found no rain could penetrate it. And for this reason the Doctor
and I gave it the name of the <i>Umbrella Tree</i>. But not one single
tree was there which was the same as any tree we had seen before. And
there were many, many more curious growths that dimly reminded you of
something, though you could not always say exactly what.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="012"></a><img
src="0607691h-images/012.png" width="500" height="499" alt=
"&quot;The Umbrella Tree&quot;" title=""> <span class="caption">"The
Umbrella Tree"</span></div>

<p>One odd thing that disturbed us quite a little was a strange sound.
Noises of any kind, no matter how faint, we already knew could travel
long distances on the Moon. As soon as we had gained the plateau on top
of the bluff we heard it. It was a musical sound. And yet not the sound
of a single instrument. It seemed almost as though there was a small
orchestra somewhere playing very, very softly. We were by this time
becoming accustomed to strange things. But I must confess that this
distant hidden music upset me quite a little, and so, I know, it did
the Doctor.</p>

<p>At the top of the bluff we rested to get our wind before we covered
the last mile up to the jungle itself. It was curious how clearly
marked and separated were those sections of the Moon's landscape. And
yet doubtless the smaller scale of all the geographical features of
this world, so much less in bulk than our own, could partly account for
that. In front of us a plateau stretched out, composed of hard sand,
level and smooth as a lake, bounded in front by the jungle and to the
rear of us by the cliff we had just scaled. I wondered as I looked
across at the forest what scenery began on the other side of the woods
and if it broke off in as sharp a change as it did here.</p>

<p>As the most important thing to attend to first was the establishment
of a water supply, Chee-Chee was asked to act as guide. The monkey set
out ahead of us to follow his own tracks which he had made last night.
This he had little difficulty in doing across the open plateau. But
when we reached the edge of the forest it was not so easy. Much of his
travelling here had been done by swinging through the trees. He always
felt safer so, he said, while explaining to us how he had been guided
to the water by the sense of smell. Again I realized how lucky we had
been to have him with us. No one but a monkey could have found his way
through that dense, dimly lit forest to water. He asked us to stay
behind a moment on the edge of the woods while he went forward to make
sure that he could retrace his steps. We sat down again and waited.</p>

<p>"Did you wake up at all during the night, Stubbins?" the Doctor
asked after a little.</p>

<p>"No," I said. "I was far too tired. Why?"</p>

<p>"Did you, Polynesia?" he asked, ignoring my question.</p>

<p>"Yes," said she, "I was awake several times."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="013"></a><img
src="0607691h-images/013.png" width="500" height="494" alt=
"&quot;'Yes,' said she, 'I was awake several times'&quot;" title="">
<span class="caption">"'Yes,' said she, 'I was awake several
times'"</span></div>

<p>"Did you hear or see anything&mdash;er&mdash;unusual?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said she. "I can't be absolutely certain. But I sort of felt
there was something moving around the camp keeping a watch on us.</p>

<p>"Humph!" muttered the Doctor. "So did I."</p>

<p>Then he relapsed into silence.</p>

<p>Another rather strange thing that struck me as I gazed over the
landscape while we waited for Chee-Chee to return was the appearance of
the horizon. The Moon's width being so much smaller than the Earth's,
the distance one could see was a great deal shorter. This did not apply
so much where the land was hilly or mountainous; but on the level, or
the nearly level it made a very striking difference. The
<i>roundness</i> of this world was much more easily felt and understood
than was that of the world we had left. On this plateau, for example,
you could only see seven or eight miles, it seemed, over the level
before the curve cut off your vision. And it gave quite a new character
even to the hills, where peaks showed behind other ranges, dropping
downward in a way that misled you entirely as to their actual
height.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="014"></a><img

"&quot;The roundness of this world was much more easily felt&quot;"
title=""> <span class="caption">"The roundness of this world was much
more easily felt"</span></div>

<p>Finally Chee-Chee came back to us and said he had successfully
retraced his steps to the water he had found the night before. He was
now prepared to lead us to it. He looked kind of scared and ill at
ease. The Doctor asked him the reason for this, but he didn't seem able
to give any.</p>

<p>"Everything's all right, Doctor," said he&mdash;"at least I suppose
it is. It was partly that&mdash;oh, I don't know&mdash;I can't quite
make out what it is they have asked you here for. I haven't actually
laid eyes on any animal life since we left the moth who brought us. Yet
I feel certain that there's lots of it here. It doesn't appear to want
to be seen. That's what puzzles me. On the Earth the animals were never
slow in coming forward when they were in need of your services."</p>

<p>"You bet they were not!" grunted Polynesia. "No one who ever saw
them clamouring around the surgery door could doubt that."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="015"></a><img
src="0607691h-images/015.png" width="500" height="493" alt=
"&quot;'You bet they were not!' grunted Polynesia&quot;" title="">
<span class="caption">"'You bet they were not!' grunted
Polynesia"</span></div>

<p>"Humph!" the Doctor muttered, "I've noticed it myself already. I
don't understand it quite&mdash;either. It almost looks as though there
were something about our arrival which they didn't like.... I
wonder.... Well, anyway, I wish the animal life here would get in touch
with us and let us know what it is all about. This state of things is,
to say the least&mdash;er&mdash;upsetting."</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h2><a name="6_THE_MOON_LAKE" id="THE_MOON_LAKE"></a>6. THE MOON
LAKE</h2>

<p>And so we went forward with Chee-Chee as guide to find the water.
Our actual entrance into that jungle was quite an experience and very
different from merely a distant view of it. The light outside was not
bright; inside the woods it was dimmer still. My only other experience
of jungle life had been in Spidermonkey Island. This was something like
the Spidermonkey forest and yet it was strikingly different.</p>

<p>From the appearance and size of that first tree we had reached, the
Doctor had guessed its age to be very, very great. Here the vegetable
life in general seemed to bear out that idea beyond all question. The
enormous trees with their gigantic trunks looked as though they had
been there since the beginning of time. And there was surprisingly
little decay&mdash;a few shed limbs and leaves. That was all. In unkept
earthly forests one saw dead trees everywhere, fallen to the ground or
caught half-way in the crotches of other trees, withered and dry. Not
so here. Every tree looked as though it had stood so and grown in peace
for centuries.</p>

<p>At length, after a good deal of arduous travel&mdash;the going for
the most part was made slow by the heaviest kind of undergrowth, with
vines and creepers as thick as your leg&mdash;we came to a sort of open
place in which lay a broad calm lake with a pleasant waterfall at one
end. The woods that surrounded it were most peculiar. They looked like
enormous asparagus. For many, many square miles their tremendous masts
rose, close together, in ranks. No creepers or vines had here been
given a chance to flourish. The enormous stalks had taken up all the
room and the nourishment of the crowded earth. The tapering tops,
hundreds of feet above our heads, looked good enough to eat. Yet I've
no doubt that if we had ever got up to them they would have been found
as hard as oaks.</p>

<p>The Doctor walked down to the clean sandy shore of the lake and
tried the water. Chee-Chee and I did the same. It was pure and clear
and quenching to the thirst. The lake must have been at least five
miles wide in the centre.</p>

<p>"I would like," said John Dolittle, "to explore this by boat. Do you
suppose, Chee-Chee, that we could find the makings of a canoe or a raft
anywhere?"</p>

<p>"I should think so," said the monkey. "Wait a minute and I will take
a look around and see."</p>

<p>So, with Chee-Chee in the lead, we proceeded along the shore in
search of materials for a boat. On account of that scarcity of dead or
dried wood which we had already noticed, our search did not at first
appear a very promising one. Nearly all the standing trees were pretty
heavy and full of sap. For our work of boat-building a light hatchet on
the Doctor's belt was the best tool we had. It looked sadly small
compared with the great timber that reared up from the shores of the
lake.</p>

<p>But after we had gone along about a mile I noticed Chee-Chee up
ahead stop and peer into the jungle. Then, after he had motioned to us
with his hand to hurry, he disappeared into the edge of the forest. On
coming up with him we found him stripping the creepers and moss off
some contrivance that lay just within the woods, not more than a
hundred yards from the water's edge.</p>

<p>We all fell to, helping him, without any idea of what it might be we
were uncovering. There seemed almost no end to it. It was a long
object, immeasurably long. To me it looked like a dead tree&mdash;the
first dead, lying tree we had seen.</p>

<p>"What do you think it is, Chee-Chee?" asked the Doctor.</p>

<p>"It's a boat," said the monkey in a firm and matter-of-fact voice.
"No doubt of it at all in my mind. It's a dug-out canoe. They used to
use them in Africa."</p>

<p>"But, Chee-Chee," cried John Dolittle, "look at the length! It's a
full-sized Asparagus Tree. We've uncovered a hundred feet of it already
and still there's more to come."</p>

<p>"I can't help that," said Chee-Chee. "It's a dug-out canoe just the
same. Crawl down with me here underneath it, Doctor, and I'll show you
the marks of tools and fire. It has been turned upside down."</p>

<p>With the monkey guiding him, the Doctor scrabbled down below the
queer object; and when he came forth there was a puzzled look on his
face.</p>

<p>"Well, they <i>might</i> be the marks of tools, Chee-Chee," he was
saying. "But then again they might not. The traces of fire are more
clear. But that could be accidental. If the tree burned down it could
very easily&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The natives in my part of Africa," Chee-Chee interrupted, "always
used fire to eat out the insides of their dug-out canoes. They built
little fires all along the tree, to hollow out the trunk so that they
could sit in it. The tools they used were very simple, just stone
scoops to chop out the charred wood with. I am sure this is a canoe,
Doctor. But it hasn't been used in a long time. See how the bow has
been shaped up into a point."</p>

<p>"I know," said the Doctor. "But the Asparagus Tree has a natural
point at one end anyhow."</p>

<p>"And, Chee-Chee," put in Polynesia, "who in the name of goodness
could ever handle such a craft? Why, look, the thing is as long as a
battleship!"</p>

<p>Then followed a half-hour's discussion, between the Doctor and
Polynesia on the one side and Chee-Chee on the other, as to whether the
find we had made was, or was not, a canoe. For me, I had no opinion. To
my eyes the object looked like an immensely long log, hollowed somewhat
on the one side, but whether by accident or design I could not
tell.</p>

<p>In any case it was certainly too heavy and cumbersome for us to use.
And presently I edged into the argument with the suggestion that we go
on further and find materials for a raft or boat we <i>could</i>
handle.</p>

<p>The Doctor seemed rather glad of this excuse to end a fruitless
controversy, and soon we moved on in search of something which would
enable us to explore the waters of the lake. A march of a mile further
along the shore brought us to woods that were not so heavy. Here the
immense asparagus forests gave way to a growth of smaller girth; and
the Doctor's hatchet soon felled enough poles for us to make a raft
from. We laced them together with thongs of bark and found them
sufficiently buoyant when launched to carry us and our small supply of
baggage with ease. Where the water was shallow we used a long pole to
punt with; and when we wished to explore greater depths we employed
sweeps, or oars, which we fashioned roughly with the hatchet.</p>

"&quot;We used a long pole to punt with&quot;" title=""> <span class=
"caption">"We used a long pole to punt with"</span></div>

<p>From the first moment we were afloat the Doctor kept me busy taking
notes for him. In the equipment he had brought with him there was a
fine-meshed landing net; and with it he searched along the shores for
signs of life in this moon lake, the first of its kind we had met
with.</p>

<p>"It is very important, Stubbins," said he, "to find out what fish we
have here. In evolution the fish life is a very important matter."</p>

<p>"What is <i>evolution</i>?" asked Chee-Chee.</p>

<p>I started out to explain it to him but was soon called upon by the
Doctor to make more notes&mdash;for which I was not sorry, as the task
turned out to be a long and heavy one. Polynesia, however, took it up
where I left off and made short work of it.</p>

<p>"Evolution, Chee-Chee," said she, "is the story of how Tommy got rid
of the tail you are carrying&mdash;because he didn't need it any
more&mdash;and the story of how you grew it and kept it because you
<i>did</i> need it.... <i>Evolution!</i> Proof!&mdash;Professors' talk.
A long word for a simple matter."</p>

<p>It turned out that our examination of the lake was neither exciting
nor profitable. We brought up all sorts of water-flies, many
larv&aelig; of perfectly tremendous size, but we found as yet no
fishes. The plant life&mdash;water plant I mean&mdash;was abundant.</p>

<p>"I think," said the Doctor, after we had poled ourselves around the
lake for several hours, "that there can be no doubt now that the
Vegetable Kingdom here is much more important than the Animal Kingdom.
And what there is of the Animal Kingdom seems to be mostly insect.
However, we will camp on the shore of this pleasant lake and perhaps we
shall see more later."</p>

<p>So we brought our raft to anchor at about the place from which we
had started out and pitched camp on a stretch of clean yellow sand.</p>

<p>I shall never forget that night. It was uncanny. None of us slept
well. All through the hours of darkness we heard things moving around
us. Enormous things. Yet never did we see them or find out what they
were. The four of us were nevertheless certain that all night we were
being watched. Even Polynesia was disturbed. There seemed no doubt that
there was plenty of animal life in the Moon, but that it did not as yet
want to show itself to us. The newness of our surroundings alone was
disturbing enough, without this very uncomfortable feeling that
something had made the moon folks distrustful of us.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h2><a name="7_TRACKS_OF_A_GIANT" id="TRACKS_OF_A_GIANT"></a>7. TRACKS
OF A GIANT</h2>

<p>Another thing which added to our sleeplessness that night was the
continuance of the mysterious music. But then so many strange things
contributed to our general mystification and vague feeling of anxiety
that it is hard to remember and distinguish them all.</p>

<p>The next morning after breakfasting on what remained of our fruits
we packed up and started off for further exploration. While the last of
the packing had been in progress Chee-Chee and Polynesia had gone ahead
to do a little advanced scouting for us. They formed an admirable team
for such work. Polynesia would fly above the forest and get
long-distance impressions from the air of what lay ahead while
Chee-Chee would examine the more lowly levels of the route to be
followed, from the trees and the ground.</p>

<p>The Doctor and I were just helping one another on with our packs
when Chee-Chee came rushing back to us in great excitement. His teeth
were chattering so he could hardly speak.</p>

<p>"What do you think, Doctor!" he stammered. "We've found tracks back
there. Tracks of a man! But so enormous! You've no idea. Come quick and
I'll show you."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 497px;"><a name="017"></a><img
src="0607691h-images/017.png" width="497" height="500" alt=
"&quot;'What do you think, Doctor?' he stammered&quot;" title=""> <span
class="caption">"'What do you think, Doctor?' he
stammered"</span></div>

<p>The Doctor looked up sharply at the scared and excited monkey,
pausing a moment as though about to question him. Then he seemed to
change his mind and turned once more to the business of taking up the
baggage. With loads hoisted we gave a last glance around the camping
ground to see if anything had been forgotten or left.</p>

<p>Our route did not lie directly across the lake, which mostly
sprawled away to the right of our line of march. But we had to make our
way partly around the lower end of it. Wondering what new chapter lay
ahead of us, we fell in behind Chee-Chee and in silence started off
along the shore.</p>

<p>After about half an hour's march we came to the mouth of a river
which ran into the upper end of the lake. Along the margin of this we
followed Chee-Chee for what seemed like another mile or so. Soon the
shores of the stream widened out and the woods fell back quite a
distance from the water's edge. The nature of the ground was still
clean firm sand. Presently we saw Polynesia's tiny figure ahead,
waiting for us.</p>

<p>When we drew up with her we saw that she was standing by an enormous
footprint. There was no doubt about its being a man's, clear in every
detail. It was the most gigantic thing I have ever seen, a barefoot
track fully four yards in length. There wasn't only one, either. Down
the shore the trail went on for a considerable distance; and the span
that the prints lay apart gave one some idea of the enormous stride of
the giant who had left this trail behind him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 495px;"><a name="018"></a><img
src="0607691h-images/018.png" width="495" height="500" alt=
"&quot;An enormous footprint&quot;" title=""> <span class="caption">"An
enormous footprint"</span></div>

<p>Questioning and alarmed, Chee-Chee and Polynesia gazed silently up
at the Doctor for an explanation.</p>

<p>"Humph!" he muttered after a while. "So Man is here, too. My
goodness, what a monster! Let us follow the trail."</p>

<p>Chee-Chee was undoubtedly scared of such a plan. It was clearly both
his and Polynesia's idea that the further we got away from the maker of
those tracks the better. I could see terror and fright in the eyes of
both of them. But neither made any objection; and in silence we plodded
along, following in the path of this strange human who must, it would
seem, be something out of a fairy tale.</p>

<p>But alas! It was not more than a mile further on that the footprints
turned into the woods where, on the mosses and leaves beneath the
trees, no traces had been left at all. Then we turned about and
followed the river quite a distance to see if the creature had come
back out on the sands again. But never a sign could we see. Chee-Chee
spent a good deal of time too at the Doctor's request trying to find
his path through the forest by any signs, such as broken limbs or marks
in the earth which he might have left behind. But not another trace
could we find. Deciding that he had merely come down to the stream to
get a drink, we gave up the pursuit and turned back to the line of our
original march.</p>

<p>Again I was thankful that I had company on that expedition. It was
certainly a most curious and extraordinary experience. None of us spoke
very much, but when we did it seemed that all of us had been thinking
the same things.</p>

<p>The woods grew more and more mysterious, and more and more
<i>alive</i>, as we went onward towards the other side of the Moon, the
side that earthly Man had never seen before. For one thing, the strange
music seemed to increase; and for another, there was more movement in
the limbs of the trees. Great branches that looked like arms, bunches
of small twigs that could have been hands, swung and moved and clawed
the air in the most uncanny fashion. And always that steady wind went
on blowing, even, regular and smooth.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="019"></a><img
src="0607691h-images/019.png" width="500" height="498" alt=
"&quot;There was more movement in the limbs of the trees&quot;" title=
""> <span class="caption">"There was more movement in the limbs of the
trees"</span></div>

<p>All of the forest was not gloomy, however. Much of it was
unbelievably beautiful. Acres of woods there were which presented
nothing but a gigantic sea of many-coloured blossoms, colours that
seemed like something out of a dream, indescribable, yet clear in one's
memory as a definite picture of something seen.</p>

<p>The Doctor as we went forward spoke very little; when he did it was
almost always on the same subject: "the absence of decay," as he put
it.</p>

<p>"I am utterly puzzled, Stubbins," said he, in one of his longer
outbursts when we were resting. "Why, there is hardly any leaf-mould at
all!"</p>

<p>"What difference would that make, Doctor?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well, that's what the trees live on, mostly, in our world," said
he. "The forest growth, I mean&mdash;the soil that is formed by dying
trees and rotting leaves&mdash;that is the nourishment that brings
forth the seedlings which finally grow into new trees. But here! Well,
of course there is <i>some</i> soil&mdash;and some shedding of leaves.
But I've hardly seen a dead tree since I've been in these woods. One
would almost think that there were some&mdash;er&mdash;balance. Some
<i>arrangement</i> of&mdash;er&mdash;well&mdash;I can't explain it....
It beats me entirely."</p>

<p>I did not, at the time, completely understand what he meant. And yet
it did seem as though every one of these giant plants that rose about
us led a life of peaceful growth, undisturbed by rot, by blight or by
disease.</p>

<p>Suddenly in our march we found ourselves at the end of the wooded
section. Hills and mountains again spread before us. They were not the
same as those we had first seen, however. These had vegetation, of a
kind, on them. Low shrubs and heath plants clothed this rolling land
with a dense growth&mdash;often very difficult to get through.</p>

<p>But still no sign of decay&mdash;little or no leaf-mould. The Doctor
now decided that perhaps part of the reason for this was the
seasons&mdash;or rather the lack of seasons. He said that we would
probably find that here there was no regular winter or summer. It was
an entirely new problem, so far as the struggle for existence was
concerned, such as we knew in our world.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h2><a name="8_THE_SINGING_TREES" id="THE_SINGING_TREES"></a>8. THE
SINGING TREES</h2>

<p>Into this new heath and hill country we travelled for miles. And
presently we arrived upon a rather curious thing. It was a sort of
basin high up and enclosed by hills or knolls. The strange part of it
was that here there were not only more tracks of the Giant Man, just as
we had seen lower down, but there were also unmistakable signs of
<i>fire</i>. In an enormous hollow ashes lay among the sands. The
Doctor was very interested in those ashes. He took some and added
chemicals to them and tested them in many ways. He confessed himself at
last entirely puzzled by their nature. But he said he nevertheless felt
quite sure we had stumbled on the scene of the smoke signalling we had
seen from Puddleby. Curiously long ago, it seemed, that time when
Too-Too, the owl, had insisted he saw smoke burst from the side of the
Moon. That was when the giant moth lay helpless in our garden. And
yet&mdash;how long was it? Only a few days!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 492px;"><a name="020"></a><img
src="0607691h-images/020.png" width="492" height="500" alt=
"&quot;It was a sort of basin&quot;" title=""> <span class=
"caption">"It was a sort of basin"</span></div>

<p>"It was from here, Stubbins," said the Doctor, "that the signals we
saw from the Earth were given out, I feel certain. This place, as you
see, is miles and miles across. But what was used to make an explosion
as large as the one we saw from my house I have no idea."</p>

<p>"But it was smoke we saw," said I, "not a flash."</p>

<p>"That's just it," he said. "Some curious material must have been
used that we have as yet no knowledge of. I thought that by testing the
ashes I could discover what it was. But I can't. However, we may yet
find out."</p>

<p>For two reasons the Doctor was anxious for the present not to get
too far from the forest section. (We did not know then, you see, that
there were other wooded areas beside this through which we had just
come.) One reason was that we had to keep in touch with our food supply
which consisted of the fruits and vegetables of the jungle. The other
was that John Dolittle was absorbed now in the study of this Vegetable
Kingdom which he felt sure had many surprises in store for the student
naturalist.</p>

<p>After a while we began to get over the feeling of uncanny
creepiness, which at the beginning had made us so uncomfortable. We
decided that our fears were mostly caused by the fact that these woods
and plants were so different from our own. There was no unfriendliness
in these forests after all, we assured ourselves&mdash;except that we
<i>were</i> being watched. That we knew&mdash;and that we were
beginning to get used to.</p>

<p>As soon as the Doctor had decided that we would set up our new
headquarters on the edge of the forest, and we had our camp properly
established, we began making excursions in all directions through the
jungle. And from then on I was again kept very busy taking notes of the
Doctor's experiments and studies.</p>

<p>One of the first discoveries we made in our study of the Moon's
Vegetable Kingdom was that there was practically no warfare going on
between it and the Animal Kingdom. In the world we had left we had been
accustomed to see the horses and other creatures eating up the grass in
great quantities and many further examples of the struggle that
continually goes on between the two. Here, on the other hand, the
animals (or, more strictly speaking, the insects, for there seemed as
yet hardly any traces of other animal species) and the vegetable life
seemed for the most part to help one another rather than to fight and
destroy. Indeed we found the whole system of Life on the Moon a
singularly peaceful business. I will speak of this again later on.</p>

<p>We spent three whole days in the investigation of the strange music
we had heard. You will remember that the Doctor, with his skill on the
flute, was naturally fond of music; and this curious thing we had met
with interested him a great deal. After several expeditions we found
patches of the jungle where we were able to see and hear the tree music
working at its best.</p>

<p>There was no doubt about it at all: The trees were making the sounds
and they were doing it <i>deliberately.</i> In the way that an
&AElig;olian harp works when set in the wind at the right angle, the
trees moved their branches to meet the wind so that certain notes would
be given out. The evening that the Doctor made this discovery of what
he called the <i>Singing Trees</i> he told me to mark down in the diary
of the expedition as a Red Letter Date. I shall never forget it. We had
been following the sound for hours, the Doctor carrying a tuning-fork
in his hand, ringing it every once in a while to make sure of the notes
we heard around us. Suddenly we came upon a little clearing about which
great giants of the forest stood in a circle. It was for all the world
like an orchestra. Spellbound, we stood and gazed up at them, as first
one and then another would turn a branch to the steady blowing wind and
a note would boom out upon the night, clear and sweet. Then a group,
three or four trees around the glade, would swing a limb and a chord
would strike the air, and go murmuring through the jungle. Fantastic
and crazy as it sounds, no one could have any doubt who heard and
watched that these trees were actually making sounds, which they
<i>wanted to make</i>, with the aid of the wind.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="021"></a><img
src="0607691h-images/021.png" width="500" height="499" alt=
"&quot;Spellbound, we gazed up at them&quot;" title=""> <span class=
"caption">"Spellbound, we gazed up at them"</span></div>

<p>Of course, as the Doctor remarked, unless the wind had always blown
steadily and evenly such a thing would have been impossible. John
Dolittle himself was most anxious to find out on what scale of music
they were working. To me, I must confess, it sounded just mildly
pleasant. There <i>was</i> a time: I could hear that. And some whole
phrases repeated once in a while, but not often. For the most part the
melody was wild, sad and strange. But even to my uneducated ear it was
beyond all question a quite clear effort at orchestration; there were
certainly treble voices and bass voices and the combination was sweet
and agreeable.</p>

<p>I was excited enough myself, but the Doctor was worked up to a pitch
of interest such as I have seldom seen in him.</p>

<p>"Why, Stubbins," said he, "do you realize what this
means?&mdash;It's terrific. If these trees can sing, a choir
understands one another and all that, <i>they must have a
language</i>.&mdash;They can talk! A language in the Vegetable Kingdom!
We must get after it. Who knows? I may yet learn it myself. Stubbins,
this is a great day!"</p>

<p>And so, as usual on such occasions, the good man's enthusiasm just
carried him away bodily. For days, often without food, often without
sleep, he pursued this new study. And at his heels I trotted with my
note book always ready&mdash;though, to be sure, he put in far more
work than I did because frequently when we got home he would go on
wrestling for hours over the notes or new apparatus he was building, by
which he hoped to learn the language of the trees.</p>

<p>You will remember that even before we left the Earth John Dolittle
had mentioned the possibility of the moon bells having some means of
communicating with one another. That they could move, within the limits
of their fixed position, had been fully established. To that we had
grown so used and accustomed that we no longer thought anything of it.
The Doctor had in fact wondered if this might possibly be a means of
conversation in itself&mdash;the movement of limbs and twigs and
leaves, something like a flag signal code. And for quite a long while
he sat watching certain trees and shrubs to see if they used this
method for talking between themselves.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h2><a name="9_THE_STUDY_OF_PLANT_LANGUAGES" id=
"THE_STUDY_OF_PLANT_LANGUAGES"></a>9. THE STUDY OF PLANT LANGUAGES</h2>

<p>About this time there was one person whom both the Doctor and I were
continually reminded of, and continually wishing for, and that was Long
Arrow, the Indian naturalist whom we had met in Spidermonkey Island. To
be sure, he had never admitted to the Doctor that he had had speech
with plant life. But his knowledge of botany and the natural history of
the Vegetable Kingdom was of such a curious kind we felt that here he
would have been of great help to us. Long Arrow, the son of Golden
Arrow, never booked a scientific note in his life. How would
he&mdash;when he was unable to write? Just the same he could tell you
why a certain coloured bee visited a certain coloured flower; why
<i>that</i> moth chose <i>that</i> shrub to lay its eggs in; why this
particular grub attacked the roots of this kind of water plant.</p>

<p>Often of an evening the Doctor and I would speak of him, wondering
where he was and what he was doing. When we sailed away from
Spidermonkey Island he was left behind. But that would not mean he
stayed there. A natural-born tramp who rejoiced in defying the elements
and the so-called laws of Nature, he could be looked for anywhere in
the two American continents.</p>

<p>And again, the Doctor would often refer to my parents. He evidently
had a very guilty feeling about them&mdash;despite the fact that it was
no fault of his that I had stowed away aboard the moth that brought us
here. A million and one things filled his mind these days, of course;
but whenever there was a let-down, a gap, in the stream of his
scientific inquiry, he would come back to the subject.</p>

<p>"Stubbins," he'd say, "you shouldn't have come.... Yes, yes, I know,
you did it for me. But Jacob, your father&mdash;and your mother
too&mdash;they must be fretting themselves sick about your
disappearance. And I am responsible.... Well, we can't do anything
about that now, I suppose. Let's get on with the work."</p>

<p>And then he'd plunge ahead into some new subject and the matter
would be dropped&mdash;till it bothered him again.</p>

<p>Throughout all our investigations of the Moon's Vegetable Kingdom we
could not get away from the idea that the animal life was still, for
some unknown reason, steering clear of us. By night, when we were
settling down to sleep, we'd often get the impression that huge moths,
butterflies or beetles were flying or crawling near us.</p>

<p>We made quite sure of this once or twice by jumping out of our beds
and seeing a giant shadow disappear into the gloom. Yet never could we
get near enough to distinguish what the creatures were before they
escaped beyond the range of sight. But that they had
come&mdash;whatever they were&mdash;to keep an eye on us seemed quite
certain. Also that all of them were winged. The Doctor had a theory
that the lighter gravity of the Moon had encouraged the development of
wings to a much greater extent than it had on the Earth.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 499px;"><a name="023"></a><img

"&quot;Seeing a giant shadow disappear into the gloom&quot;" title="">
<span class="caption">"Seeing a giant shadow disappear into the
gloom"</span></div>

<p>And again those tracks of the strange Giant Man. They were always
turning up in the most unexpected places; I believe that if the Doctor
had allowed Polynesia and Chee-Chee complete liberty to follow them
that the enormous Human would have been run down in a very short time.
But John Dolittle seemed still anxious to keep his family together. I
imagine that with his curiously good instinctive judgment he feared an
attempt to separate us. And in any case of course both Chee-Chee and
Polynesia were quite invaluable in a tight place. They were neither of
them heavy-weight fighters, it is true; but their usefulness as scouts
and guides was enormous. I have often heard John Dolittle say that he
would sooner have that monkey or the parrot Polynesia with him in
savage countries than he would the escort of a dozen regiments.</p>

<p>With some of our experimental work we wandered off long distances
into the heath lands to see what we could do with the gorgeous
flowering shrubs that thronged the rolling downs; and often we followed
the streams many miles to study the gigantic lilies that swayed their
stately heads over the sedgy banks.</p>

<p>And little by little our very arduous labours began to be
repaid.</p>

<p>I was quite astonished when I came to realize how well the Doctor
had prepared for this expedition. Shortly after he decided that he
would set to work on the investigation of this supposed language of the
plants he told me we would have to go back and fetch the remainder of
our baggage which we had left at the point of our first arrival.</p>

<p>So the following morning, bright and early, he, Chee-Chee and I set
out to retrace our steps. Polynesia was left behind. The Doctor told
none of us why he did this, but we decided afterwards that, as usual,
he knew what he was doing.</p>

<p>It was a long and hard trip. It took us a day and a half going there
and two days coming back with the load of baggage. At our original
landing-place we again found many tracks of the Giant Human, and other
strange marks on the sands about our baggage-dump which told us that
here too curious eyes had been trying to find out things without being
seen.</p>

<p>A closer examination of the tracks made by the Giant Human in these
parts where they were especially clear told the Doctor that his right
leg stride was considerably longer than his left. The mysterious Moon
Man evidently walked with a limp. But with such a stride he would
clearly be a very formidable creature anyway.</p>

<p>When we got back and started unpacking the bundles and boxes which
had been left behind, I saw, as I have already said, how well the
Doctor had prepared for his voyage. He seemed to have brought
everything that he could possibly need for the trip: hatchets, wire,
nails, files, a hand-saw, all the things we couldn't get on the Moon.
It was so different from his ordinary preparations for a
voyage&mdash;which hardly ever consisted of more than the little black
bag and the clothes he stood in.</p>

""> <span class="caption">"He seemed to have brought everything he

<p>As usual he rested only long enough to get a few mouthfuls of food
before he set to work. There seemed to be a dozen different apparatuses
he wanted to set up at once, some for the testing of sound, others for
vibrations, etc., etc. With the aid of a saw and an axe and a few other
tools, half a dozen small huts had sprung up in an hour around our
camp.</p>

<p>Laying aside for the present all worry on the score of why he had
been summoned to the Moon&mdash;of why the Animal Kingdom continued to
treat us with suspicion, of why the Giant Human so carefully kept out
of our way, the Doctor now plunged into the study of plant languages
heart and soul.</p>

<p>He was always happy so, working like a demon, snatching his meals
and his sleep here and there when he thought of such earthly matters.
It was a most exhausting time for the rest of us, keeping pace with
this firebrand of energy when he got on an interesting scent. And yet
it was well worth while too. In one and a half days he had established
the fact that the trees <i>did</i> converse with one another by means
of branch gestures. But that was only the first step. Copying and
practising, he rigged himself up like a tree and talked in the
glade&mdash;after a fashion&mdash;with these centuries-old denizens of
the jungle.</p>

<p>From that he learned still more&mdash;that language, of a kind, was
carried on by using other means&mdash;by scents given out, in a
definite way&mdash;short or long perfumes, like a regular Morse Code;
by the tones of wind-song when branches were set to the right angle to
produce certain notes; and many other odd strange means.</p>

<p>Every night, by bed-time, I was nearly dead from the strain and
effort of taking notes in those everlasting books, of which he seemed
to have brought an utterly inexhaustible supply.</p>

<p>Chee-Chee looked after the feeding of us&mdash;Thank
goodness!&mdash;or I fear we would easily have starved to death, if
overwork itself hadn't killed us. Every three hours the faithful little
monkey would come to us wherever we were at the moment with his messes
of strange vegetables and fruits and a supply of good clean drinking
water.</p>

<p>As official recorder of the Expedition (a job of which I was very
proud even if it was hard work) I had to book all the Doctor's
calculations as well as his natural history notes. I have already told
you something of temperature, air pressure, time and what not. A
further list of them would have included the calculation of distance
travelled. This was quite difficult. The Doctor had brought with him a
pedometer (that is a little instrument which when carried in the pocket
tells you from the number of strides made the miles walked). But in the
Moon, with the changed gravity, a pace was quite different from that
usual on the Earth. And what is more, it never stayed the same. When
the ground sloped downward it was natural to spring a step that quite
possibly measured six or seven feet&mdash;this with no out-of-the-way
effort at all. And even on the up grade one quite frequently used a
stride that was far greater than in ordinary walking.</p>

 title=""> <span class="caption">"It was natural to spring a step that

<p>It was about this time that the Doctor first spoke of making a tour
of the Moon. Magellan, you will remember, was the first to sail around
our world. And it was a very great feat. The Earth contains more water
area than land. The Moon, on the contrary, we soon saw, had more dry
land than water. There were no big oceans. Lakes and chains of lakes
were all the water area we saw. To complete a round trip of this world
would therefore be harder, even though it was shorter, than the voyage
that Magellan made.</p>

<p>It was on this account that the Doctor was so particular about my
booking a strict record of the miles we travelled. As to direction, we
had not as yet been so careful about maintaining a perfectly straight
line. Because it was by no means easy for one thing; and for another,
the subjects we wished to study, such as tree-music, tracks, water
supply, rock formation, etc., often led us off towards every quarter of
the compass. When I say the <i>compass</i> I mean something a little
different from the use of that word in earthly geography. As I have
told you, the magnetic compass which John Dolittle had brought with him
from Puddleby did not behave in a helpful manner at all. Something else
must be found to take its place.</p>

<p>John Dolittle, as usual, went after that problem too with much
energy. He was a very excellent mathematician, was the Doctor. And one
afternoon he sat down with a note book and the Nautical Almanac and
worked out tables which should tell him from the stars where he was and
in what direction he was going. It was curious, that strange sense of
comfort we drew from the stars. They, the heavenly bodies which from
the Earth seemed the remotest, most distant, unattainable and strangest
of objects, here suddenly became friendly; because, I suppose, they
were the only things that really stayed the same. The stars, as we saw
them from the Moon, were precisely as the stars we had seen from the
Earth. The fact that they were nearly all countless billions of miles
away made no difference. For us they were something that we had seen
before and knew.</p>

<p>It was while we were at work on devising some contrivance to take
the place of the compass that we made the discovery of the explosive
wood. The Doctor after trying many things by which he hoped to keep a
definite direction had suddenly said one day:</p>

<p>"Why, Stubbins, I have it.&mdash;The wind! It always blows
steady&mdash;and probably from precisely the same quarter&mdash;or at
all events with a regular calculable change most likely. Let us test it
and see."</p>

<p>So right away we set to work to make various wind-testing devices.
We rigged up weather-vanes from long streamers of light bark. And then
John Dolittle hit upon the idea of smoke.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="027"></a><img

"&quot;We rigged up weather vanes&quot;" title=""> <span class=
"caption">"We rigged up weather vanes"</span></div>

<p>"That is something," said he, "if we only place it properly, which
will warn us by smell if the wind changes. And in the meantime we can
carry on our studies of the Animal Kingdom and its languages." So
without further ado we set to work to build fires&mdash;or rather large
smoke smudges&mdash;which should tell us how reliable our wind would be
if depended on for a source of direction.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h2><a name="11_WE_PREPARE_TO_CIRCLE_THE_MOON" id=
"WE_PREPARE_TO_CIRCLE_THE_MOON"></a>11. WE PREPARE TO CIRCLE THE
MOON</h2>

<p>We went to a lot of trouble working out how we could best place
these fires so that they should give us the most satisfactory results.
First of all we decided with much care on the exact position where we
would build them. Mostly they were on bare knolls or shoulders, where
they couldn't spread to the underbrush and start a bush-fire. Then came
the question of fuel:&mdash;What would be the best wood to build them
of?</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 498px;"><a name="028"></a><img
src="0607691h-images/028.png" width="498" height="500" alt=
"&quot;Mostly they were on bare knolls&quot;" title=""> <span class=
"caption">"Mostly they were on bare knolls"</span></div>

<p>There were practically no dead trees, as I have said. The only thing
to do then was to cut some timber down and let it dry.</p>

<p>This we proceeded to do but did not get very far with it before the
Doctor suddenly had qualms of conscience. Trees that could talk could,
one would suppose, also <i>feel</i>. The thought was dreadful. We
hadn't even the courage to ask the trees about it&mdash;yet. So we fell
back upon gathering fallen twigs and small branches. This made the work
heavier still because, of course, we needed a great deal of fuel to
have fires big enough to see and smell for any distance.</p>

<p>After a good deal of discussion we decided that this was a thing
which couldn't be hurried. A great deal depended on its success. It was
a nuisance, truly, but we had just got to be patient. So we went back
into the jungle-lands and set to work on getting out various samples of
woods to try.</p>

<p>It took a longish time, for the Doctor and myself were the only ones
who could do this work. Chee-Chee tried to help by gathering twigs; but
the material we most needed was wood large enough to last a fair
time.</p>

<p>Well, we harvested several different kinds. Some wouldn't burn at
all when we tried them. Others, we found, were pretty fair burners, but
not smoky enough.</p>

<p>With about the fifth kind of wood, I think it was that we tested
out, we nearly had a serious accident. Fire seemed to be (outside of
the traces we had found of the smoke signal apparatus) a thing quite
unusual in the Moon. There were no traces of forest burnings anywhere,
so far as we had explored. It was therefore with a good deal of fear
and caution that we struck matches to test out our fuel.</p>

<p>About dusk one evening the Doctor set a match to a sort of fern wood
(something like a bamboo) and he narrowly escaped a bad burning. The
stuff flared up like gunpowder.</p>

<p>We took him off, Chee-Chee and I, and examined him. We found he had
suffered no serious injuries, though he had had a very close shave. His
hands were somewhat blistered and he told us what to get out of the
little black bag to relieve the inflammation.</p>

<p>We had all noticed that as the wood flared up it sent off dense
masses of white smoke. And for hours after the explosion clouds of
heavy fumes were still rolling round the hills near us.</p>

<p>When we had the Doctor patched up he told us he was sure that we had
stumbled by accident on the fuel that had been used for making the
smoke signals we had seen from Puddleby.</p>

<p>"But my goodness, Doctor," said I, "what an immense bonfire it must
have been to be visible all that distance!&mdash;Thousands of tons of
the stuff, surely, must have been piled together to make a smudge which
could be seen that far."</p>

<p>"And who could have made it?" put in Chee-Chee.</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence. Then Polynesia spoke the thought
that was in my mind&mdash;and I imagine in the Doctor's too.</p>

<p>"The man who made those torches," said she quietly, "could move an
awful lot of timber in one day, I'll warrant."</p>

<p>"You mean you think it was <i>he</i> who sent the signals?" asked
Chee-Chee, his funny little eyes staring wide open with
astonishment.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="029"></a><img
src="0607691h-images/029.png" width="500" height="499" alt=
"&quot;'You mean you think it was he who sent the signals?'&quot;"
title=""> <span class="caption">"'You mean you think it was he who sent
the signals?'"</span></div>

<p>"Why not?" said Polynesia. Then she lapsed into silent contemplation
and no further questioning from Chee-Chee could get a word out of
her.</p>

<p>"Well," said the monkey at last, "if he <i>did</i> send it that
would look as though he were responsible for the whole thing. It must
have been he who sent the moth down to us&mdash;who needed the Doctor's
assistance and presence here."</p>

<p>He looked towards John Dolittle for an answer to this suggestion.
But the Doctor, like Polynesia, didn't seem to have anything to
say.</p>

<p>Well, in spite of our little mishap, our wood tests with smoke were
extremely successful. We found that the wind as a direction-pointer
could certainly be relied on for three or four days at a time.</p>

<p>"Of course, Stubbins," said the Doctor, "we will have to test again
before we set off on our round trip. It may be that the breeze, while
blowing in one prevailing direction now, may change after a week or so.
Also we will have to watch it that the mountain ranges don't deflect
the wind's course and so lead us astray. But from what we have seen so
far, I feel pretty sure that we have here something to take the place
of the compass."</p>

<p>I made one or two attempts later, when Polynesia and Chee-Chee were
out of earshot, to discover what John Dolittle thought about this idea
that it had really been the Moon Man who had brought us here and not
the Animal Kingdom. I felt that possibly he might talk more freely to
me alone on the subject than he had been willing to with all of us
listening. But he was strangely untalkative.</p>

<p>"I don't know, Stubbins," said he, frowning, "I really don't know.
To tell the truth, my mind is not occupied with that problem
now&mdash;at all events, not as a matter for immediate decision. This
field of the lunar Vegetable Kingdom is something that could take up
the attention of a hundred naturalists for a year or two. I feel we
have only scratched the surface. As we go forward into the unknown
areas of the Moon's further side we are liable to make discoveries
of&mdash;well, er&mdash;who can tell? When the Moon Man and the Animal
Kingdom make up their minds that they want to get in touch with us, I
suppose we shall hear from them. In the meantime we have our work to
do&mdash;more than we can do.... Gracious, I wish I had a whole staff
with me!&mdash;Surveyors, cartographers, geologists and the rest. Think
of it! Here we are, messing our way along across a new world&mdash;and
we don't even know where we are! I think I have a vague idea of the
line we have followed. And I've tried to keep a sort of chart of our
march. But I should be making maps, Stubbins, real maps, showing all
the peaks, valleys, streams, lakes, plateaux and
everything.&mdash;Dear, dear! Well, we must do the best we can."</p>

<h2><a name="12_THE_VANITY_LILIES" id="THE_VANITY_LILIES"></a>12. THE
VANITY LILIES</h2>

<p>Of course on a globe larger than that of the Moon we could never
have done as well as we did. When you come to think of it, one man, a
boy, a monkey and a parrot, as a staff for the exploration of a whole
world, makes the expedition sound, to say the least, absurd.</p>

<p>We did not realize, any of us, when we started out from our first
landing that we were going to make a circular trip of the Moon's globe.
It just worked out that way. To begin with, we were expecting every
hour that some part of the Animal Kingdom would come forward into the
open. But it didn't. And still we went on. Then this language of the
trees and flowers came up and got the Doctor going on one of his
fever-heat investigations. That carried us still further. We always
took great care when departing from one district for an excursion of
any length to leave landmarks behind us, camps or dumps, so that we
could find our way back to food and shelter if we should get caught in
a tight place.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 491px;"><a name="031"></a><img
src="0607691h-images/031.png" width="491" height="500" alt=
"&quot;We always took care to leave landmarks behind us&quot;" title=
""> <span class="caption">"We always took care to leave landmarks
behind us"</span></div>

<p>In this sort of feeling our way forward Polynesia was most helpful.
The Doctor used to let her off regularly now to fly ahead of us and
bring back reports. That gave us some sort of idea of what we should
prepare for. Then in addition to that, the Doctor had brought with him
several small pocket surveying instruments with which he marked on his
chart roughly the points at which we changed course to any considerable
extent.</p>

<p>In the earlier stages of our trip we had felt we must keep in touch
with the first fruit section we had met with, in order to have a supply
of vegetables and fruits to rely on for food. But we soon discovered
from Polynesia's scouting reports, that other wooded sections lay ahead
of us. To these we sent Chee-Chee, the expert, to investigate. And when
he returned and told us that they contained even a better diet than
those further back, we had no hesitation in leaving her old haunts and
venturing still further into the mysteries of the Moon's Further
Side.</p>

<p>The Doctor's progress with the language of the trees and plants
seemed to improve with our penetration into the interior. Many times we
stopped and pitched camp for four or five days, while he set up some
new apparatus and struggled with fresh problems in plant language. It
seemed to grow easier and easier for him all the time. Certainly the
plant life became more elaborate and lively. By this we were all grown
more accustomed to strange things in the Vegetable Kingdom. And even to
my unscientific eyes it was quite evident that here the flowers and
bushes were communicating with one another with great freedom and in
many different ways.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 495px;"><a name="032"></a><img

"&quot;Certainly the plant life became more elaborate and lively&quot;"
title=""> <span class="caption">"Certainly the plant life became more

<p>I shall never forget our first meeting with the Vanity Lilies, as
the Doctor later came to call them. Great gaudy blooms they were, on
long slender stems that swayed and moved in groups like people
whispering and gossiping at a party. When we came in sight of them for
the first time, they were more or less motionless. But as we
approached, the movement among them increased as though they were
disturbed by, or interested in, our coming.</p>

<p>I think they were beyond all question the most beautiful flowers I
have ever seen. The wind, regular as ever, had not changed. But the
heads of these great masses of plants got so agitated as we drew near,
that the Doctor decided he would halt the expedition and
investigate,</p>

<p>We pitched camp as we called it&mdash;a very simple business in the
Moon, because we did not have to raise tents or build a fire. It was
really only a matter of unpacking, getting out the food to eat and the
bedding to sleep in.</p>

<p>We were pretty weary after a full day's march. Beyond the lily beds
(which lay in a sort of marsh) we could see a new jungle district with
more strange trees and flowering creepers.</p>

<p>After a short and silent supper, we lay down and pulled the covers
over us. The music of the forest grew louder as darkness increased. It
seemed almost as though the whole vegetable world was remarking on
these visitors who had invaded their home.</p>

<p>And then above the music of the woods we'd hear the drone of flying,
while we dropped off to sleep. Some of the giant insects were hovering
near, as usual, to keep an eye on these creatures from another
world.</p>

<p>I think that of all our experiences with the plant life of the Moon
that with the Vanity Lilies was perhaps the most peculiar and the most
thrilling. In about two days the Doctor had made extraordinary strides
in his study of this language. That, he explained to me, was due more
to the unusual intelligence of this species and its willingness to help
than to his own efforts. But of course if he had not already done
considerable work with the trees and bushes it is doubtful if the
lilies could have got in touch with him as quickly as they did.</p>

<p>By the end of the third day Chee-Chee, Polynesia and I were all
astonished to find that John Dolittle was actually able to carry on
conversation with these flowers. And this with the aid of very little
apparatus. He had now discovered that the Vanity Lilies spoke among
themselves largely by the movement of their blossoms. They used
different means of communication with species of plants and trees other
than their own&mdash;and also (we heard later) in talking with birds
and insects; but among themselves the swaying of the flower-heads was
the common method of speech.</p>

<p>The lilies, when seen in great banks, presented a very gorgeous and
wonderful appearance. The flowers would be, I should judge, about
eighteen inches across, trumpet-shaped and brilliantly coloured. The
background was a soft cream tone and on this great blotches of violet
and orange were grouped around a jet-black tongue in the centre. The
leaves were a deep olive green.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="033"></a><img
src="0607691h-images/033.png" width="500" height="500" alt=
"&quot;The flowers would be about eighteen inches across&quot;" title=
""> <span class="caption">"The flowers would be about eighteen inches
across"</span></div>

<p>But it was that extraordinary look of alive intelligence that was
the most uncanny thing about them. No one, no matter how little he knew
of natural history in general or of the Moon's Vegetable Kingdom, could
see those wonderful flowers without immediately being arrested by this
peculiar character. You felt at once that you were in the presence of
people rather than plants; and to talk with them, or to try to, seemed
the most natural thing in the world.</p>

<p>I filled up two of those numerous note books of the Doctor's on his
conversations with the Vanity Lilies. Often he came back to these
flowers later, when he wanted further information about the Moon's
Vegetable Kingdom. For as he explained to us, it was in this species
that Plant Life&mdash;so far at all events as it was known on either
the Moon or the Earth&mdash;had reached its highest point of
development.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h2><a name="13_THE_FLOWER_OF_MANY_SCENTS" id=
"THE_FLOWER_OF_MANY_SCENTS"></a>13. THE FLOWER OF MANY SCENTS</h2>

<p>Another peculiar thing that baffled us completely, when we first
came into the marshy regions of the Vanity Lily's home, was the variety
of scents which assailed our noses. For a mile or so around the
locality there was no other flower visible; the whole of the marsh
seemed to have been taken up by the lilies and nothing else intruded on
their domain. Yet at least half a dozen perfumes were distinct and
clear. At first we thought that perhaps the wind might be bringing us
scents from other plants either in the jungle or the flowering heath
lands. But the direction of the breeze was such that it could only come
over the sandy desert areas and was not likely to bring perfumes as
strong as this.</p>

<p>It was the Doctor who first hit upon the idea that possibly the lily
could give off more than one scent at will. He set to work to find out
right away. And it took no more than a couple of minutes to convince
him that it could. He said he was sorry he had not got Jip with him.
Jip's expert sense of smell would have been very useful here. But for
ordinary purposes it required nothing more delicate than an average
human's nose to tell that this flower, when John Dolittle had
communicated the idea to it, was clearly able to give out at least half
a dozen different smells as it wished.</p>

<p>The majority of these perfumes were extremely agreeable. But there
were one or two that nearly knocked you down. It was only after the
Doctor had asked the lilies about this gift of theirs that they sent
forth obnoxious ones in demonstrating all the scents that they could
give out. Chee-Chee just fainted away at the first sample. It was like
some deadly gas. It got into your eyes and made them run. The Doctor
and I only escaped suffocation by flight&mdash;carrying the body of the
unconscious monkey along with us.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="034"></a><img

"&quot;Chee-Chee just fainted away at the first sample&quot;" title="">
<span class="caption">"Chee-Chee just fainted away at the first

<p>The Vanity Lilies, seeing what distress they had caused, immediately
threw out the most soothing lovely scent I have ever smelled. Clearly
they were anxious to please us and cultivate our acquaintance. Indeed
it turned out later from their conversation with the Doctor (which I
took down word for word) that in spite of being a stationary part of
the Moon's landscape, they had heard of John Dolittle, the great
naturalist, and had been watching for his arrival many days. They were
in fact the first creatures in our experience of the Moon that made us
feel we were among friends.</p>

<p>I think I could not do better, in trying to give you an idea of the
Doctor's communication with the Vegetable Kingdom of the Moon, than to
set down from my diary, word for word, some parts of the conversation
between him and the Vanity Lilies as he translated them to me for
dictation at the time. Even so, there are many I am sure who will doubt
the truth of the whole idea: that a man could talk with the flowers.
But with them I am not so concerned. Any one who had followed John
Dolittle through the various stages of animal, fish, and insect
languages would not, I feel certain, find it very strange, when the
great man did at last come in touch with plant life of unusual
intelligence, that he should be able to converse with it.</p>

<p>On looking over my diary of those eventful days the scene of that
occasion comes up visibly before my eyes. It was about an hour before
dusk&mdash;that is the slight dimming of the pale daylight which
proceeded a half darkness, the nearest thing to real night we ever saw
on the Moon. The Doctor, as we left the camp, called back over his
shoulder to me to bring an extra note book along as he expected to make
a good deal of progress to-night. I armed myself therefore with three
extra books and followed him out.</p>

<p>Halting about twenty paces in front of the lily beds (we had camped
back several hundred yards from them after they had nearly suffocated
Chee-Chee) the Doctor squatted on the ground and began swaying his head
from side to side. Immediately the lilies began moving their heads in
answer, swinging, nodding, waving, and dipping.</p>

<p>"Are you ready, Stubbins?" asked John Dolittle.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="035"></a><img
src="0607691h-images/035.png" width="500" height="500" alt=
"&quot;'Are you ready, Stubbins?'&quot;" title=""> <span class=
"caption">"'Are you ready, Stubbins?'"</span></div>

<p>"Yes, Doctor," said I, making sure my pencil point would last a
while.</p>

<p>"Good," said he.&mdash;"Put it down":</p>

<p><i>The Doctor</i>&mdash;"Do you like this stationary life&mdash;I
mean, living in the same place all the time, unable to move?"</p>

<p><i>The Lilies</i>&mdash;(Several of them seemed to answer in
chorus)&mdash;"Why, yes&mdash;of course. Being stationary doesn't
bother us. We hear about all that is going on."</p>

<p><i>The Doctor</i>&mdash;"From whom, what, do you hear it?"</p>

<p><i>The Lilies</i>&mdash;"Well, the other plants, the bees, the
birds, bring us news of what is happening."</p>

<p><i>The Doctor</i>-"Oh, do you communicate with the bees and the
birds?"</p>

<p><i>The Lilies</i>-"Why, certainly, of course!"</p>

<p><i>The Doctor</i>&mdash;"Yet the bees and the birds are races
different from your own."</p>

<p><i>The Lilies</i>&mdash;"Quite true, but the bees come to us for
honey. And the birds come to sit among our leaves&mdash;especially the
warblers&mdash;and they sing and talk and tell us of what is happening
in the world. What more would you want?"</p>

<p><i>The Doctor</i>-"Oh, quite so, quite so. I didn't mean you should
be discontented. But don't you ever want to move, to travel?"</p>

<p><i>The Lilies</i>&mdash;"Good gracious, no! What's the use of all
this running about? After all, there's no place like
home&mdash;provided it's a good one. It's a pleasant life we
lead&mdash;and very safe. The folks who rush around are always having
accidents, breaking legs and so forth. Those troubles can't happen to
us. We sit still and watch the world go by. We chat sometimes among
ourselves and then there is always the gossip of the birds and the bees
to entertain us."</p>

<p><i>The Doctor</i>&mdash;"And you really understand the language of
the birds and bees!&mdash;You astonish me."</p>

<p><i>The Lilies</i>&mdash;"Oh, perfectly&mdash;and of the beetles and
moths too."</p>

<p>It was at about this point in our first recorded conversation that
we made the astonishing discovery that the Vanity Lilies could
<i>see</i>. The light, as I have told you, was always somewhat dim on
the Moon. The Doctor, while he was talking, suddenly decided he would
like a smoke. He asked the lilies if they objected to the fumes of
tobacco. They said they did not know because they had never had any
experience of it. So the Doctor said he would light his pipe and if
they did not like it he would stop.</p>

<p>So taking a box of matches from his pocket he struck a light. We had
not fully realized before how soft and gentle was the light of the Moon
until that match flared up. It is true that in testing our woods for
smoke fuel we had made much larger blazes. But then, I suppose we had
been more intent on the results of our experiments than on anything
else. Now, as we noticed the lilies suddenly draw back their heads and
turn aside from the flare, we saw that the extra illumination of a mere
match had made a big difference to the ordinary daylight they were

<h2><a name="14_MIRRORS_FOR_FLOWERS" id="MIRRORS_FOR_FLOWERS"></a>14.
MIRRORS FOR FLOWERS</h2>

<p>When the Doctor noticed how the lilies shrank away from the glow of
the matches he became greatly interested in this curious unexpected
effect that the extra light had had on them.</p>

<p>"Why, Stubbins," he whispered, "they could not have felt the heat.
We were too far away. If it is the glare that made them draw back it
must be that they have some organs so sensitive to light that quite
possibly <i>they can see!</i> I must find out about this."</p>

<p>Thereupon he began questioning the lilies again to discover how much
they could tell him of their sense of vision. He shot his hand out and
asked them if they knew what movement he had made. Every time (though
they had no idea of what he was trying to find out) they told him
precisely what he had done. Then going close to one large flower he
passed his hand all round it; and the blossom turned its head and faced
the moving hand all the way round the circle.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 499px;"><a name="037"></a><img

"&quot;He passed his hand all around it&quot;" title=""> <span class=
"caption">"He passed his hand all around it"</span></div>

<p>There was no doubt in our minds whatever, when we had finished our
experiments, that the Vanity Lilies could in their own way
see&mdash;though where the machinery called eyes was placed in their
anatomy we could not as yet discover.</p>

<p>The Doctor spent hours and days trying to solve this problem. But,
he told me, he met with very little success. For a while he was forced
to the conclusion (since he could not find in the flowers any eyes such
as we knew) that what he had taken for a sense of vision was only some
other sense, highly developed, which produced the same results as
seeing.</p>

<p>"After all, Stubbins," said he, "just because we ourselves only have
five senses, it doesn't follow that other creatures can't have more. It
has long been supposed that certain birds had a sixth sense. Still, the
way those flowers feel light, can tell colours, movement, and form,
makes it look very much as though they had found a way of
seeing&mdash;even if they haven't got eyes.... Humph! Yes, one might
quite possibly see with other things besides eyes."</p>

<p>Going through his baggage that night after our day's work was done,
the Doctor discovered among his papers an illustrated catalogue which
had somehow got packed by accident. John Dolittle, always a devoted
gardener, had catalogues sent to him from nearly every seed merchant
and nurseryman in England.</p>

<p>"Why, Stubbins!" he cried, turning over the pages of gorgeous
annuals in high glee&mdash;"Here's a chance; if those lilies can see we
can test them with this.&mdash;Pictures of flowers in colour!"</p>

<p>The next day he interviewed the Vanity Lilies with the catalogue and
his work was rewarded with very good results. Taking the brightly
coloured pictures of petunias, chrysanthemums and hollyhocks, he held
them in a good light before the faces of the lilies. Even Chee-Chee and
I could see at once that this caused quite a sensation. The great
trumpet-shaped blossoms swayed downwards and forwards on their slender
stems to get a closer view of the pages. Then they turned to one
another as though in critical conversation.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="038"></a><img
src="0607691h-images/038.png" width="500" height="500" alt=
"&quot;He held them before the lilies&quot;" title=""> <span class=
"caption">"He held them before the lilies"</span></div>

<p>Later the Doctor interpreted to me the comments they had made and I
booked them among the notes. They seemed most curious to know
<i>who</i> these flowers were. They spoke of them (or rather of their
species) in a peculiarly personal way. This was one of the first
occasions when we got some idea or glimpses of lunar <i>Vegetable
Society</i>, as the Doctor later came to call it. It almost seemed as
though these beautiful creatures were surprised, like human ladies, at
the portraits displayed and wanted to know all about these foreign
beauties and the lives they led.</p>

<p>This interest in personal appearance on the part of the lilies was,
as a matter of fact, what originally led the Doctor to call their
species the Vanity Lily. In their own strange tongue they questioned
him for hours and hours about these outlandish flowers whose pictures
he had shown them. They seemed very disappointed when he told them the
actual size of most earthly flowers. But they seemed a little pleased
that their sisters of the other world could not at least compete with
them in that. They were also much mystified when John Dolittle
explained to them that with us no flowers or plants (so far as was
known) had communicated with Man, birds, or any other members of the
Animal Kingdom.</p>

<p>Questioning them further on this point of personal appearance, the
Doctor was quite astonished to find to what an extent it occupied their
attention. He found that they always tried to get nearer water so that
they could see their own reflections in the surface. They got terribly
upset if some bee or bird came along and disturbed the pollen powder on
their gorgeous petals or set awry the angle of their pistils.</p>

<p>The Doctor talked to various groups and individuals; and in the
course of his investigations he came across several plants who, while
they had begun their peaceful lives close to a nice pool or stream
which they could use as a mirror, had sadly watched while the water had
dried up and left nothing but sun-baked clay for them to look into.</p>

<p>So then and there John Dolittle halted his questioning of the Vanity
Lilies for a spell while he set to work to provide these unfortunates,
whose natural mirrors had dried up, with something in which they could
see themselves.</p>

<p>We had no regular looking-glasses of course, beyond the Doctor's own
shaving mirror, which he could not very well part with. But from the
provisions we dug out various caps and bottoms of preserved fruits and
sardine tins. These we polished with clay and rigged up on sticks so
that the lilies could see themselves in them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="039"></a><img

"&quot;These we rigged up on sticks&quot;" title=""> <span class=
"caption">"These we rigged up on sticks"</span></div>

<p>"It is a fact, Stubbins," said the Doctor, "that the natural
tendency is always to grow the way you want to grow. These flowers have
a definite conscious idea of what they consider beautiful and what they
consider ugly. These contrivances we have given them, poor though they
are, will therefore have a decided effect on their evolution."</p>

<p>That is one of the pictures from our adventures in the Moon which
always stands out in my memory: the Vanity Lilies, happy in the
possession of their new mirrors, turning their heads this way and that
to see how their pollen-covered petals glowed in the soft light,
swaying with the wind, comparing, whispering and gossiping.</p>

<p>I truly believe that if other events had not interfered, the Doctor
would have been occupied quite contentedly with his study of these very
advanced plants for months. And there was certainly a great deal to be
learned from them. They told him for instance of another species of
lily that he later came to call the <i>Poison Lily</i> or <i>Vampire
Lily</i>. This flower liked to have plenty of room and it obtained it
by sending out deadly scents (much more serious in their effects than
those unpleasant ones which the Vanities used) and nothing round about
it could exist for long.</p>

<p>Following the directions given by the Vanity Lilies we finally ran
some of these plants down and actually conversed with them&mdash;though
we were in continual fear that they would be displeased with us and
might any moment send out their poisonous gases to destroy us.</p>

<p>From still other plants which the Vanities directed us to the Doctor
learned a great deal about what he called "methods of propagating."
Certain bushes, for example, could crowd out weeds and other shrubs by
increasing the speed of their growth at will and by spreading their
seed abroad several times a year.</p>

<p>In our wanderings, looking for these latter plants, we came across
great fields of the "moon bells" flourishing and growing under natural
conditions. And very gorgeous indeed they looked, acres and acres of
brilliant orange. The air was full of their invigorating perfume. The
Doctor wondered if we would see anything of our giant moth near these
parts. But though we hung about for several hours we saw very few signs
of insect life.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h2><a name="15_MAKING_NEW_CLOTHES" id="MAKING_NEW_CLOTHES"></a>15.
MAKING NEW CLOTHES</h2>

<p>"I don't understand it at all," John Dolittle muttered. "What reason
at least can the moth who brought us here have for keeping out of our
way?"</p>

<p>"His reasons may not be his own," murmured Polynesia.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked the Doctor.</p>

<p>"Well," said she, "others may be keeping him&mdash;and the rest,
away from us."</p>

<p>"You mean the Moon Man?" said John Dolittle.</p>

<p>But to this Polynesia made no reply and the subject was dropped.</p>

<p>"That isn't the thing that's bothering me so much," said
Chee-Chee.</p>

<p>There was a pause. And before he went on I know that all of us were
quite sure what was in his mind.</p>

<p>"It's our getting back home," he said at last. "Getting here was
done for us by these moon folks&mdash;for whatever reason they had. But
we'd stand a mighty poor chance of ever reaching the Earth again if
they're going to stand off and leave us to ourselves to get back."</p>

<p>Another short spell of silence&mdash;during which we all did a
little serious and gloomy thinking.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," said the Doctor, "come, come! Don't let's bother about
the stiles till we reach them. After all we don't know for certain that
these&mdash;er&mdash;whoever it is&mdash;are definitely unfriendly to
us. They may have reasons of their own for working slowly. You must
remember that we are just as strange and outlandish to them as they and
their whole world are to us. We mustn't let any idea of that kind
become a nightmare. We have only been here, let's see, not much over
two weeks. It is a pleasant land and there is lots to be learned. The
Vegetable Kingdom is clearly well disposed towards us. And if we give
them time I'm sure that the&mdash;er&mdash;others will be too, in the
end."</p>

<p>Another matter which came up about this time was the effect of moon
food on ourselves. Polynesia was the first to remark upon it.</p>

<p>"Tommy," said she one day, "you seem to be getting enormously
tall&mdash;and fat, aren't you?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 498px;"><a name="040"></a><img
src="0607691h-images/040.png" width="498" height="500" alt=
"&quot;'Tommy, you seem to be getting enormously tall'&quot;" title="">
<span class="caption">"'Tommy, you seem to be getting enormously
tall'"</span></div>

<p>"Er&mdash;am I?" said I. "Well, I <i>had</i> noticed my belt seemed
a bit tight. But I thought it was just ordinary growing."</p>

<p>"And the Doctor too," the parrot went on. "I'll swear he's
bigger&mdash;unless my eyesight is getting queer."</p>

<p>"Well, we can soon prove that," said John Dolittle. "I know my
height exactly&mdash;five feet two and a half. I have a two-foot rule
in the baggage. I'll measure myself against a tree right away."</p>

<p>When the Doctor had accomplished this he was astonished to find that
his height had increased some three inches since he had been on the
Moon. Of what my own had been before I landed, I was not so sure; but
measurement made it too a good deal more than I had thought it. And as
to my waist line, there was no doubt that it had grown enormously. Even
Chee-Chee, when we came to look at him, seemed larger and heavier.
Polynesia was of course so small that it would need an enormous
increase in her figure to make difference enough to see.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 493px;"><a name="041"></a><img

"&quot;His height had increased some three inches&quot;" title="">
<span class="caption">"His height had increased some three
inches"</span></div>

<p>But there was no question at all that the rest of us had grown
considerably since we had been here.</p>

<p>"Well," said the Doctor, "I suppose it is reasonable enough. All the
vegetable and insect world here is tremendously much larger than
corresponding species in our own world. Whatever helped them to
grow&mdash;climate, food, atmosphere, air-pressure, etc.&mdash;should
make us do the same. There is a great deal in this for the
investigation of biologists and physiologists. I suppose the long
seasons&mdash;or almost no seasons at all, you might say&mdash;and the
other things which contribute to the long life of the animal and
vegetable species would lengthen our lives to hundreds of years, if we
lived here continually. You know when I was talking to the Vampire
Lilies the other day they told me that even cut flowers&mdash;which
with them would mean of course only blossoms that were broken off by
the wind or accident&mdash;live perfectly fresh for weeks and even
months&mdash;provided they get a little moisture. That accounts for the
moon bells which the moth brought down with him lasting so well in
Puddleby. No, we've got to regard this climate as something entirely
different from the Earth's. There is no end to the surprises it may
spring on us yet. Oh, well, I suppose we will shrink back to our
ordinary size when we return home. Still I hope we don't grow too
gigantic. My waistcoat feels most uncomfortably tight already. It's
funny we didn't notice it earlier. But, goodness knows, we have had
enough to keep our attention occupied."</p>

<p>It had been indeed this absorbing interest in all the new things
that the Moon presented to our eyes that had prevented us from noticing
our own changed condition. The following few days, however, our growth
went forward at such an amazing pace that I began seriously to worry
about it. My clothes were literally splitting and the Doctor's also.
Finally, taking counsel on the matter, we proceeded to look into what
means this world offered of making new ones.</p>

<p>Luckily the Doctor, while he knew nothing about tailoring, did know
something about the natural history of those plants and materials that
supply clothes and textile fabrics for Man.</p>

<p>"Let me see," said he one afternoon when we had decided that almost
everything we wore had become too small to be kept any longer: "Cotton
is out of the question. The spinning would take too long, even if we
had any, to say nothing of the weaving. Linen? No, likewise.&mdash;I
haven't seen anything that looked like a flax plant. About all that
remains is root fibre, though heaven help us if we have to wear that
kind of material next our skins! Well, we must investigate and see what
we can find."</p>

<p>With the aid of Chee-Chee we searched the woods. It took us several
days to discover anything suitable, but finally we did. It was an
odd-looking swamp tree whose leaves were wide and soft. We found that
when these were dried in the proper way they kept a certain pliability
without becoming stiff or brittle. And yet they were tough enough to be
sewn without tearing. Chee-Chee and Polynesia supplied us with the
thread we needed. This they obtained from certain vine
tendrils&mdash;very fine&mdash;which they shredded and twisted into
yarn. Then one evening we set to work and cut out our new suits.</p>

<p>"Better make them large enough," said the Doctor, waving a pair of
scissors over our rock work-table, "Goodness only knows how soon we'll
outgrow them."</p>

<p>We had a lot of fun at one another's expense when at length the
suits were completed and we tried them on.</p>

<p>"We look like a family of Robinson Crusoes," said John Dolittle. "No
matter: they will serve our purpose. Any port in a storm."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 492px;"><a name="042"></a><img

"&quot;'We look like a family of Robinson Crusoes'&quot;" title="">
<span class="caption">"'We look like a family of Robinson
Crusoes'"</span></div>

<p>For underwear we cut up all we had and made one garment out of two
or three. We were afraid as yet to try our new tailoring next the skin.
Luckily we only had to provide for a very mild climate.</p>

<p>"Now what about footwear?" said I when I had my coat and trousers
on. "My shoes are all split across the top."</p>

<p>"That part is easy," said Chee-Chee. "I know a tree in the jungle
which I found when hunting for fruits. The bark strips off easily and
you can cut it into sandals that will last quite a while. The only hard
part will be plaiting thongs strong enough to keep them in place on
your feet."</p>

<p>He guided us to the tree he had spoken of and we soon had outfitted
ourselves with footgear which would last us at least a week.</p>

<p>"Good!" said the Doctor. "Now we need not worry about clothes for a
while anyway, and can give our attention to more serious matters."</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h2><a name="16_MONKEY_MEMORIES_OF_THE_MOON" id=
"MONKEY_MEMORIES_OF_THE_MOON"></a>16. MONKEY MEMORIES OF THE MOON</h2>

<p>It was when we were on our way to visit still another new kind of
plant that the subject of the Moon's early history came up again in
conversation. The Doctor had heard of a "whispering vine" which used,
as a method of conversation, the rattling or whispering of its
leaves.</p>

<p>"Do you remember, Chee-Chee," the Doctor asked, "if your grandmother
ever spoke, in her stories of very ancient times, of any peculiar or
extraordinary plants or trees?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so, Doctor," he replied. "My grandmother in her talks
of the Time Before There Was a Moon kept pretty much to animals and
people. She hardly ever mentioned the trees or vegetable world, except
to say of this country or that, that it was heavily wooded, or bare and
desert. Why?"</p>

<p>"Well, of course in my mind there is no doubt that the Moon was once
a part of the Earth, as many scientists believe. And if so I am
wondering why we do not see more plants and trees of our own home kinds
here."</p>

<p>"Well, but we have, Doctor," said Polynesia. "How about the
Asparagus Forests?"</p>

<p>"Quite so," said the Doctor. "There have been many that reminded one
of earthly species in their shapes, even if they have grown into giants
here. But this speech among plants and trees&mdash;and other evidences
of social advance and development in the Vegetable Kingdom&mdash;is
something so established and accepted here I am all the time wondering
if something like it had not started on the Earth long ago&mdash;say in
the Days Before There Was a Moon. And it was merely because our
naturalists were not quick enough to&mdash;er&mdash;catch on to it,
that we supposed there was no means of communication among flowers and
trees."</p>

<p>"Let me think," said Chee-Chee, and he held his forehead tightly
with both hands.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="043"></a><img

"&quot;'Let me think,' said Chee-Chee&quot;" title=""> <span class=
"caption">"'Let me think,' said Chee-Chee"</span></div>

<p>"No," he said after a while, "I don't recall my grandmother's
speaking of things like that at all. I remember in her story of Otho
Bludge, the prehistoric artist, that she told us about certain woods he
used to make handles for his flint chisels and other tools and
household implements. She described the wood, for instance, that he
used to make bowls out of for carrying water in. But she never spoke of
trees and plants that could talk."</p>

<p>It was about midday and we had halted for lunch on our excursion in
search of the Whispering Vines we had been told of. We were not more
than two or three hours' walk from our old base camp. But that, with
the speed so easy in moon marching, means a much greater distance than
it does on the Earth. From this camp where the Doctor had set up his
apparatus for his special botanical studies, we had now for nearly a
week been making daily expeditions in search of the various new species
that the Vanity Lilies had described for us. But we always got back
before nightfall. Well, this noon the Doctor was leaning back, munching
a large piece of yellow yam&mdash;a vegetable we got from the edges of
the jungle and which we had found so nourishing we had made it almost
our chief article of diet.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 491px;"><a name="044"></a><img

"&quot;Leaning back, munching a piece of yellow yam&quot;" title="">
<span class="caption">"Leaning back, munching a piece of yellow

<p>"Tell me, Chee-Chee," said he: "what was the end of that story about
Otho Bludge the prehistoric artist? It was a most fascinating
tale."</p>

<p>"Well, I think I have told you," said Chee-Chee, "pretty nearly all
there was to tell. In the Days Before There Was a Moon, as Grandmother
always began, Otho Bludge was a man alone, a man apart. Making pictures
on horn and bone with a stone knife, that was his hobby. His great
ambition was to make a picture of Man. But there was no one to draw
from, for Otho Bludge was a man alone. One day, when he wished aloud
for some one to make a picture from, he saw this beautiful
girl&mdash;Pippiteepa was her name&mdash;kneeling on a rock waiting for
him to make a portrait of her. He made it&mdash;the best work he ever
did, carved into the flat of a reindeer's antler. About her right ankle
she wore a string of blue stone beads. When the picture was finished
she started to disappear again into the mountains' evening mist, as
mysteriously as she had come. Otho called to her to stay. She was the
only human being he had ever seen besides his own image in the pools.
He wanted her company, poor Otho Bludge, the carver of horn, the man
apart. But even as she passed into the twilight for ever she cried out
to him that she could not stay&mdash;for she was of the Fairy Folk and
not of his kin. He rushed to the rock where she had knelt; but all he
found was the string of blue stone beads which she had worn about her
ankle. Otho, broken-hearted, took them and bound them on his own wrist
where he wore them night and day, hoping always that she would come
back.</p>

<p>"There is nothing more. We youngsters used to pester my grandmother
for a continuance of the tale. It seemed so sad, so unsatisfying, an
ending. But the old lady insisted that that <i>was</i> the end. Not
long after apparently Otho Bludge, the carver of horn and the man
apart, just disappeared, completely, as though the Earth had swallowed
him up."</p>

<p>"Humph!" muttered the Doctor. "Have you any idea when?"</p>

<p>"No," said the monkey. "You see, even my grandmother's ideas of time
and place in these stories she told us were very hazy. She had only had
them handed down to her by her parents and grandparents, just as she
passed them on to us. But I am pretty sure it was around the time of
the Great Flood. Grandmother used to divide her stories into two
periods: those belonging to the Days Before There Was a Moon and those
that happened after. The name of Otho Bludge the artist only came into
those before."</p>

<p>"I see," said the Doctor thoughtfully. "But tell me: can you recall
anything your grandmother said about the time of the change&mdash;I
mean, when the one period left off and the other began?"</p>

<p>"Not a very great deal," said Chee-Chee. "It was the same when we
questioned her about the Flood. That that event had taken place, there
was no doubt; but, except for a few details, very little seemed to have
been handed down as to how it came about, or of what was going on on
the Earth at the time, or immediately after it. I imagine they were
both great catastrophes&mdash;perhaps both came together&mdash;and such
confusion fell upon all creatures that they were far too busy to take
notes, and too scattered afterwards to keep a very clear picture in
their minds. But I do remember that my grandmother said the first night
when the Moon appeared in the sky some of our monkey ancestors saw a
group of men kneeling on a mountain-top worshipping it. They had always
been sun-worshippers and were now offering up prayers to the Moon also,
saying it must be the Sun's Wife,"</p>

<p>"But," asked the Doctor, "did not Man know that the Moon must have
flown off from the Earth?"</p>

<p>"That is not very clear," said Chee-Chee. "We often questioned my
grandmother on this point. But there were certainly some awful big gaps
in her information. It was like a history put together from odd bits
that had been seen from different sides of the Earth and filled in by
gossip and hearsay generations after. It seems that to begin with the
confusion was terrible. Darkness covered the Earth, the noise of a
terrible explosion followed and there was great loss of life. Then the
sea rushed into the hole that had been made, causing more havoc and
destruction still. Man and beast slunk into caves for shelter or ran
wild across the mountains, or just lay down and covered their eyes to
shut out the dreadful vision. From what Monkey History has to relate,
none lived who had actually seen the thing take place. But that I have
always doubted. And much later there was a regular war among mankind
when human society had pulled itself together again sufficiently to get
back to something like the old order."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="045"></a><img

"&quot;A terrible explosion followed&quot;" title=""> <span class=
"caption">"A terrible explosion followed"</span></div>

<p>"What was the war about?" asked the Doctor.</p>

<p>"Well, by that time," said Chee-Chee, "Man had multiplied
considerably and there were big cities everywhere. The war was over the
question: Was the Moon a goddess, or was she not? The old
sun-worshippers said she was the wife or daughter of the Sun and was
therefore entitled to adoration. Those who said the Moon had flown off
from the flanks of the Earth had given up worshipping the Sun. They
held that if the Earth had the power to shoot off another world like
that, that <i>it</i> should be adored, as the Mother Earth from which
we got everything, and not the Sun. They said it showed the Earth was
the centre of all things, since the Sun had never shot off children.
Then there were others who said that the Sun and the new Earth should
be adored as gods&mdash;and yet others that wanted all three, Sun and
Earth and Moon, to form a great triangle of Almighty Power. The war was
a terrible one, men killing one another in thousands&mdash;greatly to
the astonishment of the Monkey People. For to us it did not seem that
any of the various parties really <i>knew</i> anything for certain
about the whole business."</p>

<p>"Dear, dear," the Doctor muttered as Chee-Chee ended. "The first
religious strife-the first of so many. What a pity!&mdash;Just as
though it mattered to any one what his neighbour believed so long as he
himself led a sincere and useful life and was happy!"</p>

<p>This expedition on the trail of the Whispering Vines proved to be
one of the most fruitful and satisfactory of all our excursions.</p>

<p>When we finally arrived at the home of this species, we found it a
very beautiful place. It was a rocky gulch hard by the jungle, where a
dense curtain of creepers hung down into a sort of pocket precipice
with a spring-fed pool at the bottom. In such a place you could imagine
fairies dancing in the dusk, wild beasts of the forest sheltering, or
outlaws making their headquarters.</p>

<p>With a squawk Polynesia flew up and settled in the hanging tendrils
that draped the rock wall. Instantly we saw a general wave of movement
go through the vines and a whispering noise broke out which could be
plainly heard by any ears. Evidently the vines were somewhat disturbed
at this invasion by a bird they did not know. Polynesia, a little upset
herself, flew back to us at once.</p>

<p>"Shiver my timbers!" said she in a disgruntled mutter. "This country
would give a body the creeps. Those vines actually moved and squirmed
like snakes when I took a hold of them."</p>

<p>"They are not used to you, Polynesia," laughed the Doctor. "You
probably scared them to death. Let us see if we can get into
conversation with them."</p>

<p>Here the Doctor's experience with the Singing Trees came in very
helpfully. I noticed as I watched him go to work with what small
apparatus he had brought with him that he now seemed much surer of how
to begin. And it was indeed a surprisingly short time before he was
actually in conversation with them, as though he had almost been
talking with them all his life.</p>

<p>Presently he turned to me and spoke almost the thought that was in
my mind.</p>

<p>"Stubbins," he said, "the ease with which these plants answer me
would almost make me think <i>they have spoken with a man before!</i>
Look, I can actually make responses with the lips, like ordinary human
speech."</p>

<p>He dropped the little contrivance he held in his hands and hissing
softly through his teeth he gave out a sort of whispered cadence. It
was a curious combination between some one humming a tune and hissing a
conversational sentence.</p>

<p>Usually it had taken John Dolittle some hours, occasionally some
days, to establish a communication with these strange almost human moon
trees good enough to exchange ideas with them. But both Chee-Chee and I
grunted with astonishment at the way they instantly responded to his
whispered speech. Swinging their leafy tendrils around to meet the
breeze at a certain angle, they instantly gave back a humming, hissing
message that might have been a repetition of that made by the Doctor
himself.</p>

<p>"They say they are glad to see us, Stubbins," he jerked out over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Why, Doctor," I said, "this is marvellous! You got results right
away. I never saw anything like it."</p>

<p>"They have spoken with a man before," he repeated. "Not a doubt of
it. I can tell by the way they&mdash;Good gracious, what's this?"</p>

<p>He turned and found Chee-Chee tugging at his left sleeve. I have
never seen the poor monkey so overcome with fright. He stuttered and
jibbered but no intelligible sounds came through his chattering
teeth.</p>

<p>"Why, Chee-Chee!" said the Doctor. "What is it?&mdash;What's
wrong?"</p>

<p>"Look!"&mdash;was all he finally managed to gulp.</p>

<p>He pointed down to the margin of the pond lying at the foot of the
cliff. We had scaled up to a shelf of rock to get nearer to the vines
for convenience. Where the monkey now pointed there was clearly visible
in the yellow sand of the pool's beach two enormous footprints such as
we had seen by the shores of the lake.</p>

<p>"<i>The Moon Man!</i>" the Doctor whispered.&mdash;"Well, I was sure
of it&mdash;that these vines had spoken with a man before. I
wonder&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sh!" Polynesia interrupted. "Don't let them see you looking. But
when you get a chance glance up towards the left-hand shoulder of the
gulch."</p>

<p>Both the Doctor and I behaved as though we were proceeding with our
business of conversing with the vines. Then pretending I was scratching
my ear I looked up in the direction the parrot had indicated. There I
saw several birds. They were trying to keep themselves hidden among the
leaves. But there was no doubt that they were there on the watch.</p>

<span class="caption">"There was no doubt that they were on the

<p>As we turned back to our work an enormous shadow passed over us,
shutting off the light of the sun. We looked up, fearing as any one
would, some attack or danger from the air. Slowly a giant moth of the
same kind that had brought us to this mysterious world sailed across
the heavens and disappeared.</p>

<p>A general silence fell over us all that must have lasted a good
three minutes.</p>

<p>"Well," said the Doctor at length, "if this means that the Animal
Kingdom has decided finally to make our acquaintance, so much the
better. Those are the first birds we have seen&mdash;and that was the
first insect&mdash;since our moth left us. Curious, to find the bird
life so much smaller than the insect. However, I suppose they will let
us know more when they are ready. Meantime we have plenty to do here.
Have you a note book, Stubbins?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Doctor," said I. "I'm quite prepared whenever you are."</p>

<p>Thereupon the Doctor proceeded with his conversation with the
Whispering Vines and fired off questions and answers so fast that I was
kept more than busy booking what he said.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 499px;"><a name="048"></a><img

"&quot;Proceeded with his conversation with the vines&quot;" title="">
<span class="caption">"Proceeded with his conversation with the

<p>It was indeed, as I have told you, by far the most satisfactory
inquiry we had made into the life of the Moon, animal or vegetable, up
to that time. Because while these vines had not the almost human
appearance of the Vanity Lilies, they did seem to be in far closer
touch with the general life of the Moon. The Doctor asked them about
this warfare which we had heard of from the last plants we had
visited&mdash;the struggle that occurred when one species of plant
wished for more room and had to push away its intruding neighbours. And
it was then for the first time we heard about the Council.</p>

<p>"Oh," said they, "you mustn't get the idea that one species of plant
is allowed to make war for its own benefit regardless of the lives or
rights of others. Oh, dear, no! We folk of the Moon have long since got
past that. There was a day when we had constant strife, species against
species, plants against plants, birds against insects, and so on. But
not any more."</p>

<p>"Well, how do you manage?" asked the Doctor, "when two different
species want the same thing?"</p>

<p>"It's all arranged by the Council," said the vines.</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;excuse me," said the Doctor. "I don't quite understand.
What council?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see," said the vines, "some hundreds of years
ago&mdash;that is, of course, well within the memory of most of us,
we&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Excuse me again," the Doctor interrupted. "Do you mean that most of
the plants and insects and birds here have been living several
centuries already?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly," said the Whispering Vines. "Some, of course, are
older than others. But here on the Moon we consider a plant or a bird
or a moth quite young if he has seen no more than two hundred years.
And there are several trees, and a few members of the Animal Kingdom
too, whose memories go back to over a thousand years."</p>

<p>"You don't say!" murmured the Doctor. "I realized, of course, that
your lives were much longer than ours on the Earth. But I had no idea
you went as far back as that. Goodness me!&mdash;Well, please go
on."</p>

<p>"In the old days, then, before we instituted the Council," the vines
continued, "there was a terrible lot of waste and slaughter. They tell
of one time when a species of big lizard overran the whole Moon. They
grew so enormous that they ate up almost all the green stuff there was.
No tree or bush or plant got a chance to bring itself to seeding-time
because as soon as it put out a leaf it was gobbled up by those hungry
brutes. Then the rest of us got together to see what we could do."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="049"></a><img
src="0607691h-images/049.png" width="500" height="500" alt=
"&quot;A species of big lizard overran the Moon&quot;" title=""> <span
class="caption">"A species of big lizard overran the Moon"</span></div>

<p>"Er&mdash;pardon," said the Doctor. "But how do you mean, got
together? You plants could not move, could you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said the vines. "We couldn't move, But we could
communicate with the rest&mdash;take part in conferences, as it were,
by means of messengers&mdash;birds and insects, you know."</p>

<p>"How long ago was that?" asked the Doctor.&mdash;"I mean, for how
long has the animal and vegetable world here been able to communicate
with one another?"</p>

<p>"Precisely," said the vines, "we can't tell you. Of course, some
sort of communication goes back a perfectly enormous long way, some
hundreds of thousands of years. But it was not always as good as it is
now. It has been improving all the time. Nowadays it would be
impossible for anything of any importance at all to happen in our
corner of the Moon without its being passed along through plants and
trees and insects and birds to every other corner of our globe within a
few moments. For instance, we have known almost every movement you and
your party have made since you landed in our world."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" muttered the Doctor. "I had no idea. However, please
proceed."</p>

<p>"Of course," they went on, "it was not always so. But after the
institution of the Council communication and co-operation became much
better and continued to grow until it reached its present stage."</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h2><a name="18_THE_PRESIDENT" id="THE_PRESIDENT"></a>18. THE
PRESIDENT</h2>

<p>The Whispering Vines then went on to tell the Doctor in greater
detail of that institution which they had vaguely spoken of already,
"The Council." This was apparently a committee or general government
made up of members from both the Animal and Vegetable Kingdoms. Its
main purpose was to regulate life on the Moon in such a way that there
should be no more warfare. For example, if a certain kind of shrub
wanted more room for expansion, and the territory it wished to take
over was already occupied by, we'll say, bullrushes, it was not allowed
to thrust out its neighbour without first submitting the case to the
Council. Or if a certain kind of butterfly wished to feed upon the
honey of some flower and was interfered with by a species of bee or
beetle, again the argument had to be put to the vote of this
all-powerful committee before any action could be taken.</p>

<p>This information explained a great deal which had heretofore puzzled
us.</p>

<p>"You see, Stubbins," said the Doctor, "the great size of almost all
life here, the development of intelligence in plant forms, and much
more besides, could not possibly have come about if this regulation had
not been in force. Our world could learn a lot from the Moon,
Stubbins&mdash;the Moon, its own child whom it presumes to despise! We
have no balancing or real protection of life. With us it is, and has
always been, 'dog eat dog.'"</p>

<p>The Doctor shook his head and gazed off into space to where the
globe of our mother Earth glowed dimly. Just so had I often seen the
Moon from Puddleby by daylight.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="050"></a><img
src="0607691h-images/050.png" width="500" height="498" alt=
"&quot;Where the globe of the Earth glowed dimly&quot;" title=""> <span
class="caption">"Where the globe of the Earth glowed
dimly"</span></div>

<p>"Yes," he repeated, his manner becoming of a sudden deeply serious,
"our world that thinks itself so far advanced has not the wisdom, the
foresight, Stubbins, which we have seen here. Fighting, gighting,
fighting, always fighting!&mdash;So it goes on down there with us....
The 'survival of the fittest'! ... I've spent my whole life trying to
help the animal, the so-called lower, forms of life. I don't mean I am
complaining. Far from it. I've had a very good time getting in touch
with the beasts and winning their friendship. If I had my life over
again I'd do just the same thing. But often, so often, I have felt that
in the end it was bound to be a losing game. It is this thing here,
this Council of Life&mdash;of life adjustment&mdash;that could have
saved the day and brought happiness to all."</p>

<p>"Yes, Doctor," said I, "but listen: compared with our world, they
have no animal life here at all, so far as we've seen. Only insets and
birds. They've no lions or tigers who have to hunt for deer and wild
goats to get a living, have they?"</p>

<p>"True, Stubbins&mdash;probably true," said he. "But don't forget
that that same warfare of species against species goes on in the Insect
Kingdom as well as among the larger carnivora. In another million years
from now some scientist may show that the war going on between Man and
the House Fly to-day is the most important thing in current
history.&mdash;And besides, who shall say what kind of a creature the
tiger was before he took to a diet of meat?"</p>

<p>John Dolittle then turned back to the vines and asked some further
questions. These were mostly about the Council; how it worked; of what
it was composed; how often it met, etc. And the answers that they gave
filled out a picture which we had already half guessed and half seen of
Life on the Moon.</p>

<p>When I come to describe it I find myself wishing that I were a great
poet, or at all events a great writer. For this moon-world was indeed a
land of wondrous rest. Trees that sang; flowers that could see;
butterflies and bees that conversed with one another and with the
plants on which they fed, watched over by a parent council that guarded
the interests of great and small, strong and weak, alike&mdash;the
whole community presented a world of peace, goodwill and happiness
which no words of mine could convey a fair idea of.</p>

<p>"One thing I don't quite understand," said the Doctor to the vines,
"is how you manage about seeding. Don't some of the plants throw down
too much seed and bring forth a larger crop than is desirable?"</p>

<p>"That," said the Whispering Vines, "is taken care of by the birds.
They have orders to eat up all the seed except a certain quantity for
each species of plant."</p>

<p>"Humph!" said the Doctor. "I hope I have not upset things for the
Council. I did a little experimental planting myself when I first
arrived here. I had brought several kinds of seed with me from the
Earth and I wanted to see how they would do in this climate. So far,
however, the seeds have not come up at all."</p>

<p>The vines swayed slightly with a rustling sound that might easily
have been a titter of amusement.</p>

<p>"You have forgotten, Doctor," said they, "that news travels fast in
the Moon. Your gardening experiments were seen and immediately reported
to the Council. And after you had gone back to your camp every single
seed that you had planted was carefully dug up by long-billed birds and
destroyed. The Council is awfully particular about seeds. It has to be.
If we got overrun by any plant, weed or shrub, all of our peaceful
balance would be upset and goodness knows what might happen. Why, the
President&mdash;"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="051"></a><img

"&quot;Every single seed was carefully dug up by long-billed birds&quot;"
 title=""> <span class="caption">"Every single seed was carefully dug
up by long-billed birds"</span></div>

<p>The particular vines which were doing the talking were three large
ones that hung close by the Doctor's shoulder. In a very sudden and
curious manner they had broken off in the middle of what they were
saying like a person who had let something slip out in conversation
which had been better left unsaid. Instantly a tremendous excitement
was visible throughout all the creepers that hung around the gulch. You
never saw such swaying, writhing, twisting and agitation. With squawks
of alarm a number of brightly coloured birds fluttered out of the
curtain of leaves and flew away over the rocky shoulders above our
heads.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?&mdash;What has happened, Doctor?" I asked as
still more birds left the concealment of the creepers and disappeared
in the distance.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 498px;"><a name="052"></a><img
src="0607691h-images/052.png" width="498" height="500" alt=
"&quot;Still more birds left the concealment of the creepers&quot;"
title=""> <span class="caption">"Still more birds left the concealment
of the creepers"</span></div>

<p>"I've no idea, Stubbins," said he. "Some one has said a little too
much, I fancy. Tell me," he asked, turning to the vines again: "Who is
the President?"</p>

<p>"The president of the Council," they replied after a pause.</p>

<p>"Yes, that I understand," said the Doctor. "But what, who, is
he?"</p>

<p>For a little there was no answer, while the excitement and agitation
broke out with renewed confusion among the long tendrils that draped
the rocky alcove. Evidently some warnings and remarks were being
exchanged which we were not to understand.</p>

<p>At last the original vines which had acted as spokesmen in the
conversation addressed John Dolittle again.</p>

<p>"We are sorry," they said, "but we have our orders. Certain things
we have been forbidden to tell you."</p>

<p>"Who forbade you?" asked the Doctor.</p>

<p>But from then on not a single word would they answer. The Doctor
made several attempts to get them talking again but without success.
Finally we were compelled to give it up and return to camp&mdash;which
we reached very late.</p>

<p>"I think," said Polynesia, as the Doctor, Chee-Chee and I set about
preparing the vegetarian supper, "that we sort of upset Society in the
Moon this afternoon. Gracious, I never saw such a land in my
life!&mdash;And I've seen a few. I suppose that by now every bumble bee
and weed on the whole globe is talking about the Whispering Vines and
the slip they made in mentioning the President. <i>President!</i>
Shiver my timbers! You'd think he were St. Peter himself! What are they
making such a mystery about, I'd like to know?"</p>

<p>"We'll probably learn pretty soon now," said the Doctor, cutting
into a huge melon-like fruit. "I have a feeling that they won't think
it worth while to hold aloof from us much longer.&mdash;I hope not
anyway."</p>

<p>"Me too," said Chee-Chee. "Frankly, this secrecy is beginning to get
under my skin. I'd like to feel assured that we are going to be given a
passage back to Puddleby. For a while, anyway, I've had enough of
adventure."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, don't worry," said the Doctor. "I still feel convinced
that we'll be taken care of. Whoever it was that got us up here did so
with some good intention. When I have done what it is that's wanted of
me, arrangements will be made for putting us back on the Earth, never
fear."</p>

<p>"Humph!" grunted Polynesia, who was cracking nuts on a limb above
our heads. "I hope you're right. I'm none too sure, myself&mdash;No,
none too sure."</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h2><a name="19_THE_MOON_MAN" id="THE_MOON_MAN"></a>19. THE MOON
MAN</h2>

<p>That night was, I think, the most disturbed one that we spent in the
whole course of our stay on the Moon. Not one of us slept soundly or
continuously. For one thing, our growth had proceeded at an alarming
and prodigious rate; and what bedding we had (we slept in that mild
climate with the blankets under us instead of over us) had become
absurdly short and insufficient for our new figures. Knees and elbows
spilled over the sides and got dreadfully sore on the hard earth. But
besides that discomfort, we were again conscious throughout the whole
night of mysterious noises and presences. Every one of us seemed to be
uneasy in his mind. I remember waking up one time and hearing the
Doctor, Chee-Chee and Polynesia all talking in their sleep at the same
time.</p>

<p>Hollow-eyed and unrested we finally, at daybreak, crawled out of our
various roosts and turned silently to the business of getting
breakfast. That veteran campaigner Polynesia was the first to pull
herself together. She came back from examining the ground about the
camp with a very serious look on her old face.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 495px;"><a name="053"></a><img
src="0607691h-images/053.png" width="495" height="500" alt=
"&quot;With a very serious look on her old face&quot;" title=""> <span
class="caption">"With a very serious look on her old face"</span></div>

<p>"Well," said she, "if there's any one in the Moon who <i>hasn't</i>
been messing round our bunks while we slept I'd like to know who it
is."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked the Doctor. "Anything unusual?"</p>

<p>"Come and see," said the parrot, and led the way out into the
clearing that surrounded our bunks and baggage.</p>

<p>Well, we were accustomed to finding tracks around our home, but this
which Polynesia showed us was certainly something quite out of the
ordinary. For a belt of a hundred yards or more about our headquarters
the earth and sand and mud was a mass of footprints. Strange insect
tracks, the marks of enormous birds, and&mdash;most evident of
all&mdash;numberless prints of that gigantic human foot which we had
seen before.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut!" said the Doctor peevishly. "They don't do us any harm
anyway. What does it matter if they come and look at us in our sleep?
I'm not greatly interested, Polynesia. Let us take breakfast. A few
extra tracks don't make much difference."</p>

<p>We sat down and started the meal.</p>

<p>But John Dolittle's prophecy that the Animal Kingdom would not delay
much longer in getting in touch with us was surprisingly and suddenly
fulfilled. I had a piece of yam smeared with honey half-way to my mouth
when I became conscious of an enormous shadow soaring over me. I looked
up and there was the giant moth who had brought us from Puddleby; I
could hardly believe my eyes. With a graceful sweep of his gigantic
wings he settled down beside me&mdash;a battleship beside a
mouse&mdash;as though such exact and accurate landings were no more
than a part of the ordinary day's work.</p>

<p>We had no time to remark on the moth's arrival before two or three
more of the same kind suddenly swept up from nowhere, fanned the dust
all over us with their giant wings and settled down beside their
brother.</p>

<p>Next, various birds appeared. Some species among these we had
already seen in the vines. But there were many we had not: enormous
storks, geese, swans and several others. Half of them seemed little
bigger than their own kind on the Earth. But others were unbelievably
large and were coloured and shaped somewhat differently&mdash;though
you could nearly always tell to what family they belonged.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 496px;"><a name="054"></a><img
src="0607691h-images/054.png" width="496" height="500" alt=
"&quot;Others were unbelievably large&quot;" title=""> <span class=
"caption">"Others were unbelievably large"</span></div>

<p>Again more than one of us opened his mouth to say something and then
closed it as some new and stranger arrival made its appearance and
joined the gathering. The bees were the next. I remembered then seeing
different kinds on the Earth, though I had never made a study of them.
Here they all came trooping, magnified into great terrible-looking
monsters out of a dream: the big black bumble bee, the little yellow
bumble bee, the common honey bee, the bright green, fast-flying,
slender bee. And with them came all their cousins and relatives, though
there never seemed to be more than two or three specimens of each
kind.</p>

<p>I could see that poor Chee-Chee was simply scared out of his wits.
And little wonder! Insects of this size gathering silently about one
were surely enough to appal the stoutest heart. Yet to me they were not
entirely terrible. Perhaps I was merely taking my cue from the Doctor
who was clearly more interested than alarmed. But besides that, the
manner of the creatures did not appear unfriendly. Serious and orderly,
they seemed to be gathering according to a set plan; and I felt sure
that very soon something was going to happen which would explain it
all.</p>

<p>And sure enough, a few moments later, when the ground about our camp
was literally one solid mass of giant insects and birds, we heard a
tread. Usually a footfall in the open air makes little or no sound at
all&mdash;though it must not be forgotten that we had found that sound
of any kind travelled much more readily on the Moon than on the Earth.
But this was something quite peculiar. Actually it shook the ground
under us in a way that might have meant an earthquake. Yet somehow one
<i>knew</i> it was a tread.</p>

<p>Chee-Chee ran to the Doctor and hid under his coat. Polynesia never
moved, just sat there on her tree-branch, looking rather peeved and
impatient but evidently interested. I followed the direction of her
gaze with my own eyes, for I knew that her instinct was always a good
guide. I found that she was watching the woods that surrounded the
clearing where we had established our camp. Her beady little eyes were
fixed immovably on a V-shaped cleft in the horizon of trees away to my
left.</p>

<p>It is curious how in those important moments I always seemed to keep
an eye on old Polynesia. I don't mean to say that I did not follow the
Doctor and stand ready to take his orders. But whenever anything
unusual or puzzling like this came up, especially a case where animals
were concerned, it was my impulse to keep an eye on the old parrot to
see how she was taking it.</p>

<p>Now I saw her cocking her head on one side&mdash;in a quite
characteristic pose&mdash;looking upward towards the cleft in the
forest wall. She was muttering something beneath her breath (probably
in Swedish, her favourite swearing language), but I could not make out
more than a low peevish murmur. Presently, watching with her, I thought
I saw the trees sway. Then something large and round seemed to come in
view above them in the cleft.</p>

<p>It was now growing dusk. It had taken, we suddenly realized, a whole
day for the creatures to gather; and in our absorbed interest we had
not missed our meals. One could not be certain of his vision, I noticed
the Doctor suddenly half rise, spilling poor old Chee-Chee out upon the
ground. The big round thing above the tree-tops grew bigger and higher;
it swayed gently as it came forward and with it the forest swayed also,
as grass moves when a cat stalks through it.</p>

<p>Any minute I was expecting the Doctor to say something. The creature
approaching, whatever&mdash;whoever&mdash;it was, must clearly be so
monstrous that everything we had met with on the Moon so far would
dwindle into insignificance in comparison.</p>

<p>And still old Polynesia sat motionless on her limb muttering and
spluttering like a fire-cracker on a damp night.</p>

<p>Very soon we could hear other sounds from the oncoming creature
besides his earth-shaking footfall. Giant trees snapped and crackled
beneath his tread like twigs under a mortal's foot. I confess that an
ominous terror clutched at my heart too now. I could sympathize with
poor Chee-Chee's timidity. Oddly enough though at this, the most
terrifying moment in all our experience on the Moon, the monkey did not
try to conceal himself. He was standing beside the Doctor fascinatedly
watching the great shadow towering above the trees.</p>

<p>Onward, nearer, came the lumbering figure. Soon there was no
mistaking its shape. It had cleared the woods now. The gathered insects
and waiting birds were making way for it. Suddenly we realized that it
was towering over us, quite near, its long arms hanging at its sides.
<i>It was human</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 499px;"><a name="055"></a><img
src="0607691h-images/055.png" width="499" height="500" alt=
"&quot;It was human!&quot;" title=""> <span class="caption">"It was
human!"</span></div>

<p>We had seen the Moon Man at last!</p>

<p>"Well, for pity's sake!" squawked Polynesia, breaking the awed
silence. "You may be a frightfully important person here. But my
goodness! It has taken you an awfully long time to come and call on
us!"</p>

<p>Serious as the occasion was in all conscience, Polynesia's remarks,
continued in an uninterrupted stream of annoyed criticism, finally gave
me the giggles. And after I once got started I couldn't have kept a
straight face if I had been promised a fortune.</p>

<p>The dusk had now settled down over the strange assembly. Starlight
glowed weirdly in the eyes of the moths and birds that stood about us,
like a lamp's flame reflected in the eyes of a cat. As I made another
effort to stifle my silly titters I saw John Dolittle, the size of his
figure looking perfectly absurd in comparison with the Moon Man's, rise
to meet the giant who had come to visit us.</p>

<p>"I am glad to meet you&mdash;at last," said he in dignified
well-bred English. A curious grunt of incomprehension was all that met
his civility.</p>

<p>Then seeing that the Moon Man evidently did not follow his language,
John Dolittle set to work to find some tongue that would be
understandable to him. I suppose there never was, and probably never
will be, any one who had the command of languages that the Doctor had.
One by one he ran through most of the earthly human tongues that are
used to-day or have been preserved from the past. None of them had the
slightest effect upon the Moon Man. Turning to animal languages
however, the Doctor met with slightly better results. A word here and
there seemed to be understood.</p>

<p>But it was when John Dolittle fell back on the languages of the
Insect and Vegetable Kingdoms that the Moon Man at last began to wake
up and show interest. With fixed gaze Chee-Chee, Polynesia and I
watched the two figures as they wrestled with the problems of common
speech. Minute after minute went by, hour after hour. Finally the
Doctor made a signal to me behind his back and I knew that now he was
really ready. I picked up my note book and pencil from the ground.</p>

<p>As I laid back a page in preparation for dictation there came a
strange cry from Chee-Chee.</p>

<p>"Look!&mdash;<i>The right wrist</i>!&mdash;Look!"</p>

<p>We peered through the twilight.... Yes, there <i>was</i> something
around the giant's wrist, but so tight that it was almost buried in the
flesh. The Doctor touched it gently. But before he could say anything
Chee-Chee's voice broke out again, his words cutting the stillness in a
curious, hoarse, sharp whisper.</p>

<p>"<i>The blue stone beads!</i>&mdash;Don't you see them?... They
don't fit him any more since he's grown a giant. But he's Otho Bludge
the artist. That's the bracelet he got from Pippiteepa the grandmother
of the Fairies!:&mdash;It is he, Doctor, Otho Bludge, who was blown off
the Earth in the <i>Days Before There Was a Moon!</i>"</p>

<h2><a name="20_THE_DOCTOR_AND_THE_GIANT" id=
"THE_DOCTOR_AND_THE_GIANT"></a>20. THE DOCTOR AND THE GIANT</h2>

<p>"All right, Chee-Chee, all right," said the Doctor hurriedly. "Wait
now. We'll see what we can find out. Don't get excited."</p>

<p>In spite of the Doctor's reassuring words, I could see that he
himself was by this time quite a little agitated. And for that no one
could blame him. After weeks in this weird world where naught but
extraordinary things came up day after day we had been constantly
wondering when we'd see the strange Human whose traces and influence
were everywhere so evident. Now at last he had appeared.</p>

<p>I gazed up at the gigantic figure rearing away into the skies above
our heads. With one of his feet he could easily have crushed the lot of
us like so many cockroaches. Yet he, with the rest of the gathering,
seemed not unfriendly to us, if a bit puzzled by our size. As for John
Dolittle, he may have been a little upset by Chee-Chee's announcement,
but he certainly wasn't scared. He at once set to work to get into
touch with this strange creature who had called on us. And, as was
usual with his experiments of this kind, the other side seemed more
than willing to help.</p>

<p>The giant wore very little clothes. A garment somewhat similar to
our own, made from the flexible bark and leaves we had discovered in
the forest, covered his middle from the arm-pits down to the lower
thighs. His hair was long and shaggy, falling almost to his shoulders.
The Doctor measured up to a line somewhere near his ankle-bone.
Apparently realizing that it was difficult for John Dolittle to talk
with him at that range, the giant made a movement with his hand and at
once the insects nearest to us rose and crawled away. In the space thus
cleared the man-monster sat down to converse with his visitors from the
Earth.</p>

<p>It was curious that after this I too no longer feared the enormous
creature who looked like something from a fairy-tale or a nightmare.
Stretching down a tremendous hand, he lifted the Doctor, as though he
had been a doll, and set him upon his bare knee. From this
height&mdash;at least thirty feet above my head&mdash;John Dolittle
clambered still further up the giant's frame till he stood upon his
shoulder.</p>

<p>Here he apparently had much greater success in making himself
understood than he had had lower down. By standing on tip-toe he could
just reach the Moon Man's ear. Presently descending to the knee again,
he began calling to me.</p>

<p>"Stubbins&mdash;I say, Stubbins! Have you got a notebook handy?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="057"></a><img
src="0607691h-images/057.png" width="500" height="498" alt=
"&quot;'Stubbins!&mdash;I say, Stubbins!'&quot;" title=""> <span class=
"caption">"'Stubbins!&mdash;I say, Stubbins!'"</span></div>

<p>"Yes, Doctor. In my pocket. Do you want me to take dictation?"</p>

<p>"Please," he shouted back&mdash;for all the world like a foreman
yelling orders from a high building. "Get this down. I have hardly
established communication yet, but I want you to book some preliminary
notes. Are you ready?"</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the Doctor in his enthusiasm had misjudged how
easy he'd find it to converse with the Moon Man. For a good hour I
stood waiting with my pencil poised and no words for dictation were
handed down. Finally the Doctor called to me that he would have to
delay matters a little till he got in close touch with our giant
visitor.</p>

<p>"Humph!" grunted Polynesia. "I don't see why he bothers. I never saw
such an unattractive enormous brute.&mdash;Doesn't look as though he
had the wits of a caterpillar anyway. And to think that it was this
great lump of unintelligent mutton that has kept the Doctor&mdash;John
Dolittle, M.D.&mdash;and the rest of us, hanging about till it suited
him to call on us!&mdash;After sending for us, mind you! That's the
part that rattles me!"</p>

<p>"Oh, but goodness!" muttered Chee-Chee, peering up at the towering
figure in the dusk. "Think&mdash;<i>think</i> how old he is! That man
was living when the Moon separated from the Earth&mdash;thousands,
maybe millions, of years ago! Golly, what an age!"</p>

<p>"Yes: he's old enough to know better," snapped the
parrot&mdash;"better manners anyway. Just because he's fat and
overgrown is no reason why he should treat his guests with such
outrageous rudeness."</p>

<p>"Oh, but come now, Polynesia," I said, "we must not forget that this
is a human being who has been separated from his own kind for centuries
and centuries. And even such civilization as he knew on the Earth, way
back in those Stone Age days, was not, I imagine, anything to boast of.
Pretty crude, I'll bet it was, the world then. The wonder is, to my way
of thinking, that he has any mind at all&mdash;with no other humans to
mingle with through all that countless time. I'm not surprised that
John Dolittle finds it difficult to talk with him."</p>

<p>"Oh, well now, Tommy Stubbins," said she, "that may sound all very
scientific and high-falutin. But just the same there's no denying that
this overgrown booby was the one who got us up here. And the least he
could have done was to see that we were properly received and cared
for&mdash;instead of letting us fish for ourselves with no one to guide
us or to put us on to the ropes. Very poor hospitality, I call it."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="058"></a><img

"&quot;'Very poor hospitality, I call it'&quot;" title=""> <span class=
"caption">"'Very poor hospitality, I call it'"</span></div>

<p>"You seem to forget, Polynesia," I said mildly, "that in spite of
our small size, we may have seemed&mdash;as the Doctor said&mdash;quite
as fearful to him and his world as he and his have been to
us&mdash;even if he did arrange to get us here. Did you notice that he
limped?"</p>

<p>"I did," said she, tossing her head. "He dragged his left foot after
him with an odd gait. Pshaw! I'll bet that's what he got the Doctor up
here for&mdash;rheumatism or a splinter in his toe. Still, what I
<i>don't</i> understand is how he heard of John Dolittle, famous though
he is, with no communication between his world and ours."</p>

<p>It was very interesting to me to watch the Doctor trying to talk
with the Moon Man. I could not make the wildest guess at what sort of
language it could be that they would finally hit upon. After all that
time of separation from his fellows, how much could this strange
creature remember of a mother tongue?</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, I did not find out that evening at all. The
Doctor kept at his experiments, in his usual way, entirely forgetful of
time or anything else. After I had watched for a while Chee-Chee's head
nodding sleepily I finally dozed off myself.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 496px;"><a name="059"></a><img

"&quot;I watched Chee-Chee's head nodding sleepily&quot;" title="">
<span class="caption">"I watched Chee-Chee's head nodding

<p>When I awoke it was daylight. The Doctor was still engaged with the
giant in his struggles to understand and be understood. However, I
could see at once that he was encouraged. I shouted up to him that it
was breakfast-time. He heard, nodded back to me and then apparently
asked the giant to join us at our meal. I was surprised and delighted
to see with what ease he managed to convey this idea to our big friend.
For the Moon Man at once sat him down upon the ground near our
tarpaulin which served as a table-cloth and gazed critically over the
foodstuffs laid out. We offered him some of our famous yellow yam. At
this he shook his head vigorously. Then with signs and grunts he
proceeded to explain something to John Dolittle.</p>

<p>"He tells me, Stubbins," said the Doctor presently, "that the yellow
yam is the principal cause of rapid growth. Everything in this world,
it seems, tends towards size; but this particular food is the worst. He
advises us to drop it&mdash;unless we want to grow as big as he is. He
has been trying to get back to our size, apparently, for ever so
long."</p>

<p>"Try him with some of the melon, Doctor," said Chee-Chee.</p>

<p>This, when offered to the Moon Man, was accepted gladly; and for a
little we all munched in silence.</p>

<p>"How are you getting on with his language, Doctor?" I asked
presently.</p>

<p>"Oh, so so," he grumbled. "It's odd&mdash;awfully strange. At first
I supposed it would be something like most human languages, a variation
of vocal sounds. And I tried for hours to get in touch with him along
those lines. But it was only a few vague far-off memories that I could
bring out. I was, of course, particularly interested to link up a
connection with some earthly language. Finally I went on to the
languages of the insects and the plants and found that he spoke all
dialects, in both, perfectly. On the whole I am awfully pleased with my
experiments. Even if I cannot link him up with some of our own dead
languages, at least his superior knowledge of the insect and vegetable
tongues will be of great value to me."</p>

<p>"Has he said anything so far about why he got you up here?" asked
Polynesia.</p>

<p>"Not as yet," said the Doctor. "But we've only just begun, you know.
All in good time, Polynesia, all in good time."</p>

<h2><a name="21_HOW_OTHO_BLUDGE_CAME_TO_THE_MOON" id=
"HOW_OTHO_BLUDGE_CAME_TO_THE_MOON"></a>21. HOW OTHO BLUDGE CAME TO THE
MOON</h2>

<p>The Doctor's warning to the parrot that perhaps we were just as
terrifying to the Moon Man (in spite of his size) as he and his world
were to us, proved to be quite true. After breakfast was over and I got
out the usual note book for dictation it soon appeared that this giant,
the dread President of the Council, was the mildest creature living. He
let us crawl all over him and seemed quite pleased that we took so much
interest in him. This did not appear to surprise the Doctor, who from
the start had regarded him as a friend. But to Chee-Chee and myself,
who had thought that he might gobble us up at any moment, it was, to
say the least, a great relief. I will not set down here in detail that
first talk between the Moon Man and the Doctor. It was very long and
went into a great many matters of languages and natural history that
might not be of great interest to the general reader. But here and
there in my report of that conversation I may dictate it word for word,
where such a course may seem necessary to give a clear picture of the
ideas exchanged. For it was certainly an interview of great
importance.</p>

<p>The Doctor began by questioning the giant on the history that
Chee-Chee had told us as it had been handed down to him by his
grandmother. Here the Moon Man's memory seemed very vague; but when
prompted with details from the Monkeys' History, he occasionally
responded and more than once agreed with the Doctor's statements or
corrected them with a good deal of certainty and firmness.</p>

<p>I think I ought perhaps to say something here about the Moon Man's
face. In the pale daylight of a lunar dawn it looked clever and
intelligent enough, but not nearly so old as one would have expected.
It is indeed hard to describe that face. It wasn't brutish and yet it
had in it something quite foreign to the average human countenance as
seen on the Earth. I imagine that his being separated from human kind
for so long may have accounted for this. Beyond question it was an
animal-like countenance and yet it was entirely free from anything like
ferocity. If one could imagine a kindly animal who had used all his
faculties in the furtherance of helpful and charitable ends one would
have the nearest possible idea of the face of the Moon Man, as I saw it
clearly for the first time when he took breakfast with us that
morning.</p>

<p>In the strange tongues of insects and plants John Dolittle fired off
question after question at our giant guest. Yes, he admitted, he
probably was Otho Bludge, the prehistoric artist. This
bracelet?&mdash;Yes, he wore it because some one... And then his memory
failed him.... What some one?... Well anyway he remembered that it had
first been worn by a woman before he had it. What matter, after all? It
was long ago, terribly long. Was there anything else that we would like
to know?</p>

<p>There was a question I myself wanted to ask. The night before, in my
wanderings with Chee-Chee over the giant's huge body, I had discovered
a disc or plate hanging to his belt. In the dusk then I had not been
able to make out what it was. But this morning I got a better view of
it: the most exquisite picture of a girl kneeling with a bow and arrow
in her hands, carved upon a plate of reindeer horn. I asked the Doctor
did he not want to question the Moon Man about it. We all guessed, of
course, from Chee-Chee's story, what it was. But I thought it might
prompt the giant's memory to things out of the past that would be of
value to the Doctor. I even whispered to John Dolittle that the giant
might be persuaded to give it to us or barter it for something. Even I
knew enough about museum relics to realize its tremendous value.</p>

<p>The Doctor indeed did speak of it to him. The giant raised it from
his belt, where it hung by a slender thong of bark and gazed at it a
while. A spark of recollection lit up his eyes for a moment Then, with
a pathetic fumbling sort of gesture, he pressed it to his heart a
moment while that odd fuddled look came over his countenance once more.
The Doctor and I, I think, both felt we had been rather tactless and
did not touch upon the subject again.</p>

<p>I have often been since&mdash;though I certainly was not at the
time&mdash;amused at the way the Doctor took charge of the situation
and raced all over this enormous creature as though he were some new
kind of specimen to be labelled and docketed for a natural history
museum. Yet he did it in such a way as not to give the slightest
offence.</p>

<p>"Yes. Very good," said he. "We have now established you as Otho
Bludge, the Stone Age artist, who was blown off the Earth when the Moon
set herself up in the sky. But how about this Council? I understand you
are president of it and can control its workings. Is that so?"</p>

<p>The great giant swung his enormous head round and regarded for a
moment the pigmy figure of the Doctor standing, just then, on his
forearm.</p>

<p>"The Council?" said he dreamily. "Oh, ah, yes, to be sure, the
Council.... Well, we had to establish that, you know. At one time it
was nothing but war&mdash;war, war all the time. We saw that if we did
not arrange a balance we would have an awful mess. Too many seeds.
Plants spread like everything. Birds laid too many eggs. Bees swarmed
too often. Terrible!&mdash;You've seen that down there on the Earth, I
imagine, have you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, to be sure," said the Doctor. "Go on, please."</p>

<p>"Well, there isn't much more to that. We just made sure, by means of
the Council, that there should be <i>no more warfare</i>"</p>

<p>"Humph!" the Doctor grunted. "But tell me: how is it you yourself
have lived so long? No one knows how many years ago it is that the Moon
broke away from the Earth. And your age, compared with the life of Man
in our world, must be something staggering."</p>

<p>"Well, of course," said the Moon Man, "just how I got here is
something that I have never been able to explain completely, even to
myself. But why bother? Here I am. What recollections I have of that
time are awfully hazy. Let me see: when I came to myself I could hardly
breathe. I remember that. The air&mdash;everything&mdash;was so
different. But I was determined to survive. That, I think, is what must
have saved me. I was <i>determined</i> to survive. This piece of land,
I recollect, when it stopped swirling, was pretty barren. But it had
the remnants of trees and plants which it had brought with it from the
Earth. I lived on roots and all manner of stuff to begin with. Many a
time I thought that I would have to perish. But I
didn't&mdash;<i>because I was determined to survive</i>. And in the end
I did. After a while plants began to grow; insects, which had come with
the plants, flourished. Birds the same way&mdash;they, like me, were
determined to survive. A new world was formed. Years after I realized
that I was the one to steer and guide its destiny since I had&mdash;at
that time anyway&mdash;more intelligence than the other forms of life.
I saw what this fighting of kind against kind must lead to. So I formed
the Council. Since then&mdash;oh, dear, how long ago!&mdash;vegetable
and animal species have come to&mdash;Well, you see it here.... That's
all. It's quite simple."</p>

"&quot;I lived on roots&quot;" title=""> <span class="caption">"I lived

<p>"Yes, yes," said the Doctor hurriedly. "I quite understand
that&mdash;the necessities that led you to establish the
Council.&mdash;And an exceedingly fine thing it is, in my opinion. We
will come back to that later. In the meantime I am greatly puzzled as
to how you came to hear of me&mdash;with no communication between your
world and ours. Your moth came to Puddleby and asked me to accompany
him back here. It was you who sent him, I presume?"</p>

<p>"Well, it was I and the Council who sent him," the Moon Man
corrected. "As for the ways in which your reputation reached us,
communication is, as you say, very rare between the two worlds. But it
does occur once in a long while. Some disturbance takes place in your
globe that throws particles so high that they get beyond the influence
of earth gravity and come under the influence of our gravity. Then they
are drawn to the Moon and stay here. I remember,' many centuries ago, a
great whirlwind or some other form of rumpus in your world occurred
which tossed shrubs and stones to such a height that they lost touch
with the Earth altogether and finally landed here. And a great nuisance
they were too. The shrubs seeded and spread like wildfire before we
realized they had arrived and we had a terrible time getting them under
control."</p>

<p>"That is most interesting," said the Doctor, glancing in my
direction, as he translated, to make sure I got the notes down in my
book. "But please tell me of the occasion by which you first learned of
me and decided you wanted me up here."</p>

<p>"That," said the Moon Man, "came about through something which was,
I imagine, a volcanic eruption. From what I can make out, one of your
big mountains down there suddenly blew its head off, after remaining
quiet and peaceful for many years. It was an enormous and terribly
powerful explosion and tons of earth and trees and stuff were fired off
into space. Some of this material that started away in the direction of
the Moon finally came within the influence of our attraction and was
drawn to us. And, as you doubtless know, when earth or plants are shot
away some animal life nearly always goes with it. In this case a bird,
a kingfisher, in fact, who was building her nest in the banks of a
mountain lake, was carried off. Several pieces of the earth landed on
the Moon. Some, striking land, were smashed to dust and any animal life
they carried&mdash;mostly insect of course&mdash;was destroyed. But the
piece on which the kingfisher travelled fell into one of our
lakes."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="061"></a><img

"&quot;The piece fell into one of our lakes&quot;" title=""> <span
class="caption">"The piece fell into one of our lakes"</span></div>

<p>It was an astounding story and yet I believe it true. For how else
could the Doctor's fame have reached the Moon? Of course any but a
water bird would have been drowned because apparently the mass plunged
down fifty feet below the surface, but the kingfisher at once came up
and flew off for the shore. It was a marvel that she was alive. I
imagine her trip through the dead belt had been made at such tremendous
speed that she managed to escape suffocation without the artificial
breathing devices which we had been compelled to use.</p>

HEARD OF DOCTOR DOLITTLE</h2>

<p>The bird the Moon Man had spoken of (it seems he had since been
elected to the Council) was presently brought forward and introduced to
the Doctor. He gave us some valuable information about his trip to the
Moon and how he had since adapted himself to new conditions.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="062"></a><img

"&quot;The bird was introduced to the Doctor&quot;" title=""> <span
class="caption">"The bird was introduced to the Doctor"</span></div>

<p>He admitted it was he who had told the Moon Folk about John Dolittle
and his wonderful skill in treating sicknesses, of his great reputation
among the birds, beasts and fishes of the Earth.</p>

<p>It was through this introduction also that we learned that the
gathering about us was nothing less than a full assembly of the Council
itself&mdash;with the exception, of course, of the Vegetable Kingdom,
who could not come. That community was however represented by different
creatures from the Insect and Bird Worlds who were there to see to it
that its interests were properly looked after.</p>

<p>This was evidently a big day for the Moon People. After our
interview with the kingfisher we could see that arguments were going on
between different groups and parties all over the place. At times it
looked like a political meeting of the rowdiest kind. These discussions
the Doctor finally put down quite firmly by demanding of the Moon Man
in a loud voice the reason for his being summoned here.</p>

<p>"After all," said he when some measure of quiet had been restored,
"you must realize that I am a very busy man. I appreciate it as a great
honour that I have been asked to come here. But I have duties and
obligations to perform on the Earth which I have left. I presume that
you asked me here for some special purpose. Won't you please let me
know what it is?"</p>

<p>A silent pause spread over the chattering assembly. I glanced round
the queer audience of birds and bugs who squatted, listening. The
Doctor, quite apart from his demand for attention, had evidently
touched upon a ticklish subject. Even the Moon Man himself seemed
somewhat ill at ease.</p>

<p>"Well," he said at last, "the truth is we were sorely in need of a
good physician. I myself have been plagued by a bad pain in the foot.
And then many of the bigger insects&mdash;the grasshoppers
especially&mdash;have been in very poor health now for some time. From
what the kingfisher told me, I felt you were the only one who could
help us&mdash;that you&mdash;er&mdash;perhaps wouldn't mind if we got
you up here where your skill was so sorely needed. Tell me now: you
were not put out by the confidence we placed in you? We had no one in
our own world who could help us. Therefore we agreed, in a special
meeting of the Council, to send down and try to get you."</p>

<p>The Doctor made no reply.</p>

<p>"You must realize," the Moon Man went on, his voice dropping to a
still more apologetic tone, "that this moth we sent took his life in
his hand. We cast lots among the larger birds, moths, butterflies and
other insects. It had to be one of our larger kinds. It was a long
trip, requiring enormous staying power...."</p>

<p>The Moon Man spread out his giant hands in protest&mdash;a gesture
very suggestive of the other world from which he originally came. The
Doctor hastened to reassure him.</p>

<p>"Why, of course, of course," said he. "I&mdash;we&mdash;were most
glad to come. In spite of the fact that I am always terribly busy down
there, this was something so new and promising in natural history I
laid every interest aside in my eagerness to get here. With the moth
you sent the difficulty of language did not permit me to make the
preparations I would have liked. But pray do not think that I have
regretted coming. I would not have missed this experience for worlds.
It is true I could have wished that you had seen your way to getting in
touch with us sooner. But there&mdash;I imagine you too have your
difficulties. I suppose you must be kept pretty busy."</p>

<p>"Busy?" said the Moon Man blankly. "Oh, no. I'm not busy. Life is
very quiet and pleasant here.&mdash;Sometimes too quiet, we think. A
session with the Council every now and then and a general inspection of
the globe every so often: that is all I have to bother with. The reason
I didn't come and see you sooner, to be quite honest, was because I was
a bit scared. It was something so new, having human folks visit you
from another world. There was no telling what you might turn out to
be&mdash;what you might do. For another thing, I expected you to be
alone. For weeks past I have had the birds and insects&mdash;and the
plants too&mdash;send me reports of your movements and character. You
see, I had relied solely on the statements of a kingfisher. No matter
how kind and helpful you had been to the creatures of your own world,
it did not follow that you would be the same way inclined towards the
Moon Folk. I am sorry if I did not appear properly hospitable. But you
must make allowances. It&mdash;it was all so&mdash;so new."</p>

""> <span class="caption">"I had the birds bring me reports of your

<p>"Oh, quite, quite," said the Doctor, again most anxious to make his
host feel at ease. "Say no more, please, of that. I understand
perfectly. There are a few points, however, on which I would like to
have some light thrown. For one thing, we thought we saw smoke on the
Moon, from Puddleby, shortly after your moth arrived. Can you tell us
anything about that?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course," said the Moon Man quickly. "I did that. We were
quite worried about the moth. As I told you, we felt kind of guilty
about the risky job we had given him. It was Jamaro who finally drew
the marked card in the lottery."</p>

<p>"Jamaro!" muttered the Doctor, slightly
bewildered&mdash;"Lottery?&mdash;I&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The lottery to decide who should go," the Moon Man explained. "I
told you: we drew lots. Jamaro Bumblelily was the moth who drew the
ticket which gave the task to him."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see," said the Doctor&mdash;"Jamaro. Yes, yes. You give your
insects names in this land. Very natural and proper of course, where
they are so large and take such an important part in the life and
government of the community. You can no doubt tell all these insects
one from another, even when they belong to the same species?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said the Moon Man. "We have, I suppose, several
hundreds of thousands of bees in the Moon. But I know each one by his
first name, as well as his swarm, or family, name. Anyhow, to continue:
it was then Jamaro Bumblelily who drew the ticket that gave him the job
of going to the Earth after you. He was very sportsmanlike and never
grumbled a bit. But we were naturally anxious. It is true that
creatures had come, at rare intervals, from the Earth to our world. But
so far none had gone from us to the Earth. We had only the vaguest idea
of what your world would be like&mdash;from the descriptions of the
kingfisher. And even in getting those we had been greatly handicapped
by language. It had only been after days and weeks of work that we had
been able to understand one another in the roughest way. So we had
arranged with Jamaro Bumblelily that as soon as he landed he was to try
and find some way to signal us to let us know he was all right. And we
were to signal back to him. It seems he made a bad landing and lay
helpless in your garden for some days. For a long while we waited in
great anxiety. We feared he must have perished in his heroic exploit.
Then we thought that maybe if we signalled to him he would be
encouraged and know that we were still expecting his return. So we set
off the smoke smudge."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Doctor. "I saw it, even if Jamaro didn't. But tell
me: how did you manage to raise such an enormous smudge? It must have
been as big as a mountain."</p>

<p>"True," said the Moon Man. "For twenty days before Jamaro's
departure I and most of the larger birds and insects had gathered the
Jing-jing bark from the forest."</p>

<p>"Gathered the <i>what</i>?" asked the Doctor.</p>

<p>"The Jing-jing bark," the Moon Man repeated. "It is a highly
explosive bark from a certain tree we have here."</p>

<p>"But how did you light it?" asked the Doctor.</p>

<p>"By friction," said the Moon Man&mdash;"drilling a hard-wood stick
into a soft-wood log. We had tons and tons of the bark piled in a
barren rocky valley where it would be safe from firing the bush or
jungle. We are always terrified of bush-fires here&mdash;our world is
not large, you know. I set the pile off with a live ember which I
carried on a slate. Then I sprang back behind a rock bluff to defend my
eyes. The explosion was terrific and the smoke kept us all coughing for
days before it finally cleared away."</p>

"THE_MAN_WHO_MADE_HIMSELF_A_KING"></a>23. THE MAN WHO MADE HIMSELF A
KING</h2>

<p>We were frequently reminded during this long conversation (it lasted
over a full day and a half) that the strange crowd about us was the
great Council itself. Questions every now and then were hurled at the
Moon Man from the dimness of the rear. He was continually turning his
head as messages and inquiries were carried across to him from mouth to
mouth. Sometimes without consulting the Doctor further he would answer
them himself in queer sounds and signs. It was quite evident that the
Council was determined to keep in touch with any negotiations that were
going on.</p>

<p>As for John Dolittle, there was so much that he wanted to find out
it looked&mdash;in spite of his hurry to get back to the Earth&mdash;as
though his queries would never end&mdash;which, in a first meeting
between two worlds, is not after all to be wondered at.</p>

<p>"Can you remember," he asked, "when you first felt the Moon
steadying herself, how you got accustomed to the new conditions? We had
on our arrival a perfectly terrible time, you know. Different air,
different gravity, different hearing and the rest. Tell me: how did you
manage?"</p>

<p>Frowning, the Moon Man passed his gigantic hand across his brow.</p>

<p>"Really&mdash;it's so long ago," he muttered. "As I told you, I
nearly died, many times. Getting enough food to stay alive on kept me
busy the first few months, Then when I was sure that that problem was
solved I began to watch. Soon I saw that the birds and insects were
faced with the same difficulties as I was. I searched the Moon globe
from end to end. There were no others of my own kind here. I was the
only man. I needed company badly. 'All right,' I said, 'I'll study the
Insect and Bird Kingdoms.' The birds adapted themselves much quicker
than I did to the new conditions. I soon found that they, being in the
same boat as myself, were only too glad to co-operate with me in
anything that would contribute to our common good. Of course I was
careful to kill nothing. For one thing I had no desire to; and for
another I realized that if, on such a little globe, I started to make
enemies, I could not last long. From the beginning I had done my best
to live and let live. With no other human to talk with I can't tell you
how terribly, desperately lonely I felt. Then I decided I'd try to
learn the language of the birds. Clearly they had a language. No one
could listen to their warblings and not see that. For years I worked at
it&mdash;often terribly discouraged at my poor progress.
Finally&mdash;don't ask me when&mdash;I got to the point where I could
whistle short conversations with them. Then came the insects&mdash;the
birds helped me in that too. Then the plant languages. The bees started
me. They knew all the dialects. And ... well ..."</p>

"&quot;I could whistle short conversations&quot;" title=""> <span
class="caption">"I could whistle short conversations"</span></div>

<p>"Go on," said the Doctor. The tone of his voice was calm and quiet,
but I could see that he was deeply, intensely interested.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me," sighed the Moon Man, almost petulantly, "my memory,
you know, for dates as far back as that, is awfully poor. To-day it
seems as though I had talked Heron and Geranium all my life. But just
when it was, actually, that I reached the point where I could converse
freely with the insects and plants, I couldn't give you the vaguest
idea. I do know that it took me far, far longer to get in touch with
the vegetable forms of life than it did with either the insects or the
birds. I am afraid that our keeping count of time throughout has been
pretty sketchy&mdash;certainly in our earlier history anyway. But then
you must remember we were occupied with a great number of far more
serious tasks. Recently&mdash;the last thousand years or so&mdash;we
have been making an effort to keep a history and we can show you, I
think, a pretty good record of most of the more important events within
that time. The trouble is that nearly all of the dates you want are
earlier than that."</p>

<p>"Well, never mind," said the Doctor. "We are getting on very well
under the circumstances. I would like very much to see that record you
speak of and will ask you to show it to me, if you will be so good,
later."</p>

<p>He then entered into a long examination of the Moon Man (carefully
avoiding all dates, periods and references to time) on a whole host of
subjects. The majority of them were concerned with insect and plant
evolution and he kept a strict eye on me to see that all questions and
replies were jotted down in the note book. Gracious! What an unending
list it seemed to my tired mind! How had the Moon Man first realized
that the plants were anxious to talk and co-operate with him? What had
led him to believe that the bees were in communication with the flowers
they fed on? Which fruits and vegetables had he found were good for
human food and how had he discovered their nutritious qualities without
poisoning himself? etc., etc., etc. It went on for hours. I got most of
it down, with very few mistakes, I think. But I know I was more than
half asleep during the last hours of the interview.</p>

<p>The only trouble with most of it was this same old bugbear of time.
After all these ages of living without human company the poor giant's
mind had got to the point where it simply didn't <i>use</i> time. Even
in this record of the last thousand years, which he had proudly told us
was properly dated, we found, when he showed it to us, that an error of
a century more or less meant very little.</p>

<p>This history had been carved in pictures and signs on the face of a
wide flat rock. The workmanship of Otho the prehistoric artist showed
up here to great advantage. While the carvings were not by any means to
be compared with his masterpiece of the kneeling girl, they
nevertheless had a dash and beauty of design that would arrest the
attention of almost any one.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 488px;"><a name="066"></a><img

"&quot;This history had been carved in pictures on the face of a rock&quot;"
 title=""> <span class="caption">"This history had been carved in
pictures on the face of a rock"</span></div>

<p>Nevertheless, despite the errors of time, both in his recollections
and his graven history, we got down the best booking that we could in
the circumstances. And with all its slips and gaps it was a most
thrilling and exciting document. It was the story of a new world's
evolution; of how a man, suddenly transported into space with nothing
but what his two hands held at the moment of the catastrophe, had made
himself the kindly monarch of a kingdom&mdash;a kingdom more wondrous
than the wildest imaginings of the mortals he had left behind. For he
was indeed a king, even if he called himself no more than the President
of the Council. And what hardships and terrible difficulties he had
overcome in doing it, only we could realize&mdash;we, who had come here
with advantages and aids which he had never known.</p>

<p>Finally a lull did come in this long, long conversation between the
Doctor and the Moon Man. And while I lay back and stretched my right
hand, cramped from constant writing, Polynesia gave vent to a great
deal which she had evidently had on her mind for some time.</p>

<p>"Well," she grunted, lifting her eyebrows, "what did I tell you,
Tommy? Rheumatism! That's what the Doctor has come all this way
for&mdash;<i>rheumatism!</i> I wouldn't mind it so much in the case of
the Moon Man himself. Because he certainly is a man in a hundred. But
<i>grasshoppers!</i> Think of it!&mdash;Think of bringing John
Dolittle, M.D., billions of miles" (Polynesia's ideas on geographical
measurement were a bit sketchy) "just to wait on a bunch of
grasshoppers! I&mdash;"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="067"></a><img

"&quot;'But grasshoppers!'&quot;" title=""> <span class="caption">"'But
grasshoppers!'"</span></div>

<p>But the remainder of her indignant speech got mixed up with some of
her favourite Swedish swear words and the result was something that no
one could make head or tail of.</p>

<p>Very soon this pause in the conversation between the Doctor and the
Moon Man was filled up by a great deal of talking among the Council.
Every member of that important parliament apparently wanted to know
exactly what had been said and decided on and what new
measures&mdash;if any&mdash;were to be put in force. We could see that
the poor President was being kept very busy.</p>

<p>At length the Doctor turned once more to the giant and said:</p>

<p>"Well now, when would it be convenient for you and the insect
patients to be examined? I shall be most happy to do everything
possible for you all, but you must realize that I would like to get
back to the Earth as soon as I conveniently can."</p>

<p>Before answering the Moon Man proceeded to consult his Council
behind him. And, to judge from the length of the discussions that
followed, he was meeting with quite a little criticism in whatever
plans he was proposing. But finally he managed to quiet them; and
addressing John Dolittle once more, he said:</p>

<p>"Thank you. If it will not inconvenience you, we will come to-morrow
and have you minister to us. You have been very kind to come at all. I
hope we will not seem too large an undertaking for you. At least, since
you have approved of our system and government here, you will have the
satisfaction of knowing that you are assisting us in a time of great
need."</p>

<p>"Why, of course, of course," said the Doctor at once. "I shall be
only too glad. That is what I am for, after all. I am a doctor, you
know, a physician&mdash;even if I have become a naturalist in my later
years. At what hour will you be ready for me?"</p>

<p>"At dawn," said the Moon Man. Even in these modern days ideas of
time on the Moon seemed strangely simple. "We will wait on you at
sunrise. Till then, pleasant dreams and good rest!"</p>

OPENS HIS SURGERY ON THE MOON</h2>

<p>Even the garrulous Polynesia was too tired to talk much more that
night. For all of us it had been a long and steady session, that
interview, tense with excitement. The Moon Man and his Council had
barely departed before every one of us was dozing off without a change
of clothes or a bite to eat. I am sure that nothing on Earth&mdash;or
Moon&mdash;could have disturbed our slumbers.</p>

<p>The daylight was just beginning to show when we were awakened. I am
not certain who was the first to arouse himself (probably John
Dolittle), but I do know that I was the first to get up.</p>

<p>What a strange sight! In the dim light hundreds, perhaps thousands,
of gigantic insects, all invalids, stood about our camp staring at the
tiny human physician who had come so far to cure their ailments. Some
of these creatures we had not so far seen and never even suspected
their presence on the Moon: caterpillars as long as a village street
with gout in a dozen feet; immense beetles suffering from an affliction
of the eyes; grasshoppers as tall as a three-storey house with crude
bandages on their gawky joints; enormous birds with a wing held
painfully in an odd position. The Doctor's home had become once more a
clinic; and all the halt and lame of Moon Society had gathered at his
door.</p>

"&quot;Grasshoppers with crude bandages on their gawky joints&quot;"
title=""> <span class="caption">"Grasshoppers with crude bandages on
their gawky joints"</span></div>

<p>The great man, when I finally roused him, swallowed two or three
gulps of melon, washed them down with a draft of honey and water, took
off his coat and set to work.</p>

<p>Of course the poor little black bag, which had done such yeoman
service for many years in many lands, was not equal to a demand like
this. The first thing to run out was the supply of bandages. Chee-Chee
and I tore up blankets and shirts to make more. Then the embrocation
became exhausted; next the iodine and the rest of the antiseptics. But
in his botanical studies of the trees and plants of this world the
Doctor had observed and experimented with several things which he had
found helpful in rheumatic conditions and other medical uses. Chee-Chee
and Polynesia were despatched at once to find the herbs and roots and
leaves that he wanted.</p>

<p>For hours and hours he worked like a slave. It seemed as though the
end of the line of patients would never be reached. But finally he did
get the last of them fixed up and despatched. It was only then he
realized that the Moon Man had let all the other sufferers come forward
ahead of himself. Dusk was coming on. The Doctor peered round the great
space about our camp. It was empty, save for a giant figure that
squatted silent, motionless and alone, by the forest's edge.</p>

<p>"My goodness!" muttered the Doctor. "I had entirely forgotten him.
And he never uttered a word. Well, no one can say he is selfish. That,
I fancy, is why he rules here. I must see what is the matter with him
at once."</p>

<p>John Dolittle hurried across the open space and questioned the
giant. An enormous left leg was stretched out for his examination. Like
a fly, the Doctor travelled rapidly up and down it, pinching and
squeezing and testing here and there.</p>

<p>"More gout," he said at last with definite decision. "A bad enough
case too. Now listen, Otho Bludge."</p>

<p>Then he lectured his big friend for a long time. Mostly it seemed
about diet, but there was a great deal concerning anatomy, exercise,
dropsy, and <i>starch</i> in it too.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 497px;"><a name="069"></a><img

"&quot;Then he lectured his big friend&quot;" title=""> <span class=
"caption">"Then he lectured his big friend"</span></div>

<p>At the end of it the Moon Man seemed quite a little impressed, much
happier in his mind and a great deal more lively and hopeful. Finally,
after thanking the Doctor at great length, he departed, while the
ground shook again beneath his limping tread.</p>

<p>Once more we were all fagged out and desperately sleepy.</p>

<p>"Well," said the Doctor as he arranged his one remaining blanket on
his bed, "I think that's about all we can do. To-morrow&mdash;or maybe
the next day&mdash;we will, if all goes well, start back for
Puddleby."</p>

<p>"<i>Sh!</i>" whispered Polynesia. "There's some one listening. I'm
sure&mdash;over there behind those trees."</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw!" said the Doctor. "No one could hear us at that
range."</p>

<p>"Don't forget how sound travels on the Moon," warned the parrot.</p>

<p>"But my goodness!" said the Doctor. "They <i>know</i> we've got to
go some time. We can't stay here for ever. Didn't I tell the President
himself I had jobs to attend to on the Earth? If I felt they needed me
badly enough I wouldn't mind staying quite a while yet. But there's
Stubbins here. He came away without even telling his parents where he
was going or how long it might be before he returned. I don't know what
Jacob Stubbins may be thinking, or his good wife. Probably worried to
death. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sh!&mdash;<i>Sh!</i>&mdash;Will you be quiet?" whispered Polynesia
again. "Didn't you hear that? I tell you there's some one
listening&mdash;or I'm a Double Dutchman. Pipe down, for pity's sake.
There are ears all round us. Go to sleep!"</p>

<p>We all took the old parrot's advice&mdash;only too willingly. And
very soon every one of us was snoring.</p>

<p>This time we did not awaken early. We had no jobs to attend to and
we took advantage of a chance to snooze away as long as we wished.</p>

<p>It was nearly midday again when we finally got stirring. We were in
need of water for breakfast. Getting the water had always been
Chee-Chee's job. This morning, however, the Doctor wanted him to hunt
up a further supply of medicinal plants for his surgical work. I
volunteered therefore to act as water-carrier.</p>

<p>With several vessels which we had made from gourds I started out for
the forests.</p>

<p>I had once or twice performed this same office of emergency
water-carrier before. I was therefore able on reaching the edge of the
jungle to make straight for the place where we usually got our
supplies.</p>

<p>I hadn't gone very far before Polynesia overtook me.</p>

<p>"Watch out, Tommy!" said she, in a mysterious whisper as she settled
on my shoulder.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 499px;"><a name="070"></a><img
src="0607691h-images/070.png" width="499" height="500" alt=
"&quot;Watch out, Tommy!&quot;" title=""> <span class="caption">"Watch
out, Tommy!"</span></div>

<p>"Why?" I asked. "Is anything amiss?"</p>

<p>"I don't quite know," said she. "But I'm uneasy and I wanted to warn
you. Listen: that whole crowd that came to be doctored yesterday, you
know? Well, not one of them has shown up again since. Why?"</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>"Well," said I presently, "I don't see any particular reason why
they should. They got their medicine, their treatment. Why should they
pester the Doctor further? It's a jolly good thing that some patients
leave him alone after they are treated, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"True, true," said she. "Just the same their all staying away the
next day looks fishy to me. They didn't <i>all</i> get treated. There's
something in it. I feel it in my bones. And besides, I can't find the
Moon Man himself. I've been hunting everywhere for him. He too has gone
into hiding again, just the same as they all did when we first arrived
here.... Well, look out! That's all. I must go back now. But keep your
eyes open, Tommy. Good luck!"</p>

<p>I couldn't make head or tail of the parrot's warning and, greatly
puzzled, I proceeded on my way to the pool to fill my water-pots.</p>

<p>There I found the Moon Man. It was a strange and sudden meeting. I
had no warning of his presence till I was actually standing in the
water filling the gourds. Then a movement of one of his feet revealed
his immense form squatting in the concealment of the dense jungle. He
rose to his feet as soon as he saw that I perceived him.</p>

<p>His expression was not unfriendly&mdash;just as usual, a kindly,
calm half-smile. Yet I felt at once uneasy and a little terrified. Lame
as he was, his speed and size made escape by running out of the
question. He did not understand my language, nor I his. It was a lonely
spot, deep in the woods. No cry for help would be likely to reach the
Doctor's ears.</p>

<p>I was not left long in doubt as to his intentions. Stretching out
his immense right hand, he lifted me out of the water as though I were
a specimen of some flower he wanted for a collection. Then with
enormous strides he carried me away through the forest. One step of his
was half-an-hour's journey for me. And yet it seemed as though he put
his feet down very softly, presumably in order that his usual
thunderous tread should not be heard&mdash;or felt&mdash;by others.</p>

<p>At length he stopped. He had reached a wide clearing. Jamaro
Bumblelily, the same moth that had brought us from the Earth, was
waiting. The Moon Man set me down upon the giant insect's back. I heard
the low rumble of his voice as he gave some final orders. I had been
kidnapped.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h2><a name="25_PUDDLEBY_ONCE_MORE" id="PUDDLEBY_ONCE_MORE"></a>25.
PUDDLEBY ONCE MORE</h2>

<p>Never have I felt so utterly helpless in my life. While he spoke
with the moth the giant held me down with his huge hand upon the
insect's back. A cry, I thought, might still be worth attempting. I
opened my mouth and bawled as hard as I could. Instantly the Moon Man's
thumb came round and covered my face. He ceased speaking.</p>

<p>Soon I could feel from the stirring of the insect's legs that he was
getting ready to fly. The Doctor could not reach me now in time even if
he had heard my cry. The giant removed his hand and left me free as the
moth broke into a run. On either side of me the great wings spread out,
acres-wide, to breast the air. In one last mad effort I raced over the
left wing and took a flying leap. I landed at the giant's waistline and
clung for all I was worth, still yelling lustily for the Doctor. The
Moon Man picked me off and set me back upon the moth. But as my hold at
his waist was wrenched loose something ripped and came away in my hand.
It was the masterpiece, the horn picture of Pippiteepa. In his anxiety
to put me aboard Jamaro again, who was now racing over the ground at a
terrible speed, he never noticed that I carried his treasure with
me.</p>

<p>Nor indeed was I vastly concerned with it at the moment. My mind
only contained one thought: I was being taken away from the Doctor.
Apparently I was to be carried off alone and set back upon the Earth.
As the moth's speed increased still further I heard a fluttering near
my right ear. I turned my head. And there, thank goodness, was
Polynesia flying along like a swallow! In a torrent of words she poured
out her message. For once in her life she was too pressed for time to
swear.</p>

<p>"Tommy!&mdash;They know the Doctor is worried about your staying
away from your parents. I told him to be careful last night. They
heard. They're afraid if you stay he'll want to leave too, to get you
back. And&mdash;"</p>

<p>The moth's feet had left the ground and his nose was tilted upward
to clear the tops of the trees that bordered the open space. The
powerful rush of air, so familiar to me from my first voyage of this
kind, was already beginning&mdash;and growing all the time. Flapping
and beating, Polynesia put on her best speed and for a while longer
managed to stay level with my giant airship.</p>

<p>"Don't worry, Tommy," she screeched. "I had an inkling of what the
Moon Man had up his sleeve, though I couldn't find out where he was
hiding. And I warned the Doctor. He gave me this last message for you
in case they should try to ship you out: Look after the old lame horse
in the stable. Give an eyes to the fruit trees. <i>And don't worry!</i>
He'll find a way down all right, he says. Watch out for the second
smoke signal." (Polynesia's voice was growing faint and she was already
dropping behind.) ... "Good-bye and good luck!"</p>

<p>I tried to shout an answer; but the rushing air stopped my breath
and made me gasp. "Good-bye and good luck!"&mdash;It was the last I
heard from the Moon.</p>

<p>I lowered myself down among the deep fur to avoid the pressure of
the tearing wind. My groping hands touched something strange. It was
the moon bells. The giant in sending me down to the Earth had thought
of the needs of the human. I grabbed one of the big flowers and held it
handy to plunge my face in. Bad times were coming, I knew when we must
cross the Dead Belt. There was nothing more I could do for the present.
I would lie still and take it easy till I reached Puddleby and the
little house with the big garden.</p>

<p>Well, for the most part my journey back was not very different from
out first voyage. If it was lonelier for me than had been the trip with
the Doctor, I, at all events, had the comfort this time of knowing from
experience that the journey <i>could</i> be performed by a human with
safety.</p>

<p>But dear me, what a sad trip it was! In addition to my loneliness I
had a terrible feeling of guilt. I was leaving the Doctor
behind&mdash;the Doctor who had never abandoned me nor any friend in
need. True, it was not my fault, as I assured myself over and over
again. Yet I couldn't quite get rid of the idea that if I had only been
a little more resourceful or quicker-witted this would not have
happened. And how, <i>how</i> was I going to face Dab-Dab, Jip and the
rest of them with the news that John Dolittle had been left in the
Moon?</p>

<p>The journey seemed endlessly long. Some fruit also had been
provided, I found, by the Moon Man; but as soon as we approached the
Dead Belt I felt too seasick to eat and remained so for the rest of the
voyage.</p>

<p>At last the motion abated enough to let me sit up and take
observations. We were quite close to the Earth. I could see it shining
cheerfully in the sun and the sight of it warmed my heart. I had not
realized till then how homesick I had been for weeks past.</p>

<p>The moth landed me on Salisbury Plain. While not familiar with the
district, I knew the spire of Salisbury Cathedral from pictures. And
the sight of it across this flat characteristic country told me where I
was. Apparently it was very early morning, though I had no idea of the
exact hour.</p>

<p>The heavier air and gravity of the Earth took a good deal of getting
used to after the very different conditions of the Moon. Feeling like
nothing so much as a ton-weight of misery, I clambered down from the
moth's back and took stock of my surroundings.</p>

<p>Morning mists were rolling and breaking over this flat piece of my
native Earth. From higher up it had seemed so sunny and homelike and
friendly. Down here on closer acquaintance it didn't seem attractive at
all.</p>

<p>Presently when the mists broke a little, I saw, not far off, a road.
A man was walking along it. A farm labourer, no doubt, going to his
work. How small he seemed! Perhaps he was a dwarf. With a sudden
longing for human company, I decided to speak to him. I lunged heavily
forward (the trial of the disturbing journey and the unfamiliar balance
of earth gravity together made me reel like a drunken man) and when I
had come within twenty paces I hailed him. The results were astonishing
to say the least. He turned at the sound of my voice. His face went
white as a sheet. Then he bolted like a rabbit and was gone into the
mist.</p>

<p>I stood in the road down which he had disappeared. And suddenly it
came over me what I was and how I must have looked. I had not measured
myself recently on the Moon, but I did so soon after my return to the
Earth. My height was nine feet nine inches and my waist measurement
fifty-one inches and a half. I was dressed in a home-made suit of bark
and leaves. My shoes and leggings were made of root-fibre and my hair
was long enough to touch my shoulders.</p>

<p>No wonder the poor farm hand suddenly confronted by such an
apparition on the wilds of Salisbury Plain had bolted! Suddenly I
thought of Jamaro Bumblelily again. I would try to give him a message
for the Doctor. If the moth could not understand me, I'd write
something for him to carry back. I set out in search. But I never saw
him again. Whether the mists misled me in direction or whether he had
already departed moonwards again I never found out.</p>

<p>So, here I was, a giant dressed like a scarecrow, no money in my
pockets&mdash;no earthly possessions beyond a piece of reindeer horn,
with a prehistoric picture carved on it. And then I realized, of
course, that the farm labourer's reception of me would be what I would
meet with everywhere. It was a long way from Salisbury to Puddleby,
that I knew. I must have coach-fare; I must have food.</p>

<p>I tramped along the road a while thinking. I came in sight of a
farm-house. The appetizing smell of frying bacon reached me. I was
terribly hungry. It was worth trying. I strode up to the door and
knocked gently. A woman opened it. She gave one scream at sight of me
and slammed the door in my face. A moment later a man threw open a
window and levelled a shot-gun at me.</p>

<p>"Get off the place," he snarled&mdash;"Quick! Or I'll blow your ugly
head off."</p>

<p>More miserable than ever I wandered on down the road. What was to
become of me? There was no one to whom I could tell the truth. For who
would believe my story? But I must get to Puddleby. I admitted I was
not particularly keen to do that&mdash;to face the Dolittle household
with the news. And yet I must. Even without the Doctor's last message
about the old horse and the fruit trees, and the rest, it was my
job&mdash;to do my best to take his place while he was away. And then
my parents&mdash;poor folk! I fear I had forgotten them in my misery.
And would even they recognize me now?</p>

<p>Then of a sudden I came upon a caravan of gipsies. They were camped
in a thicket of gorse by the side of the road and I had not seen them
as I approached.</p>

<p>They too were cooking breakfast and more savoury smells tantalized
my empty stomach. It is rather strange that the gipsies were the only
people I met who were not afraid of me. They all came out of the wagons
and gathered about me gaping; but they were interested, not scared.
Soon I was invited to sit down and eat. The head of the party, an old
man, told me they were going on to a county fair and would be glad to
have me come with them.</p>

<p>I agreed with thanks. Any sort of friendship which would save me
from an outcast lot was something to be jumped at. I found out later
that the old gipsy's idea was to hire me off (at a commission) to a
circus as a giant.</p>

<p>But as a matter of fact, that lot also I was glad to accept when the
time came. I had to have money. I could not appear in Puddleby like a
scarecrow. I needed clothes, I needed coach-fare, and I needed food to
live on.</p>

<p>The circus proprietor&mdash;when I was introduced by my friend the
gipsy&mdash;turned out to be quite a decent fellow. He wanted to book
me up for a year's engagement. But I, of course, refused. He suggested
six months. Still I shook my head. My own idea was the shortest
possible length of time which would earn me enough money to get back to
Puddleby looking decent. I guessed from the circus man's eagerness that
he wanted me in his show at almost any cost and for almost any length
of time. Finally after much argument we agreed upon a month.</p>

<p>Then came the question of clothes. At this point I was very
cautious. He at first wanted me to keep my hair long and wear little
more than a loin-cloth. I was to be a "Missing Link from Mars" or
something of the sort. I told him I didn't want to be anything of the
kind (though his notion was much nearer to the truth than he knew). His
next idea for me was "The Giant Cowboy from the Pampas." For this I was
to wear an enormous sun-hat, woolly trousers, pistols galore, and spurs
with rowels like saucers. That didn't appeal to me either very much as
a Sunday suit to show to Puddleby.</p>

<p>Finally, as I realized more fully how keen the showman was to have
me, I thought I would try to arrange my own terms.</p>

<p>"Look here, Sir," I said: "I have no desire to appear something I am
not. I am a scientist, an explorer, returned from foreign parts. My
great growth is a result of the climates I have been through and the
diet I have had to live on. I will not deceive the public by
masquerading as a Missing Link or Western Cowboy. Give me a decent suit
of black such as a man of learning would wear. And I will guarantee to
tell your audiences tales of travel&mdash;true tales&mdash;such as they
have never imagined in their wildest dreams. But I will not sign on for
more than a month. That is my last word. Is it a bargain?"</p>

<p>Well, it was. He finally agreed to all my terms. My wages were to be
three shillings a day. My clothes were to be my own property when I had
concluded my engagement. I was to have a bed and a wagon to myself. My
hours for public appearance were strictly laid down and the rest of my
time was to be my own.</p>

<p>It was not hard work. I went on show from ten to twelve in the
morning, from three to five in the afternoon, and from eight to ten at
night. A tailor was produced who fitted my enormous frame with a
decent-looking suit. A barber was summoned to cut my hair. During my
show hours I signed my autograph to pictures of myself which the circus
proprietor had printed in great numbers. They were sold at threepence
apiece. Twice a day I told the gaping crowds of holiday folk the story
of my travels. But I never spoke of the Moon. I called it just a
"foreign land"&mdash;which indeed was true enough.</p>

<p>At last the day of my release came. My contract was ended, and with
three pounds fifteen shillings in my pocket, and a good suit of clothes
upon my back, I was free to go where I wished. I took the first coach
in the direction of Puddleby. Of course many changes had to be made and
I was compelled to stop the night at one point before I could make
connections for my native town.</p>

<p>On the way, because of my great size, I was stared and gaped at by
all who saw me. But I did not mind it so much now. I knew that at least
I was not a terrifying sight.</p>

<p>On reaching Puddleby at last, I decided I would call on my parents
first, before I went to the Doctor's house. This may have been just a
putting off of the evil hour. But anyway, I had the good excuse that I
should put an end to my parents' anxiety.</p>

<p>I found them just the same as they had always been&mdash;very glad
to see me, eager for news of where I had gone and what I had done. I
was astonished, however, that they had taken my unannounced departure
so calmly&mdash;that is, I <i>was</i> astonished until it came out
that, having heard that the Doctor also had mysteriously disappeared,
they had not been nearly so worried as they might have been. Such was
their faith in the great man, like the confidence that all placed in
him. If <i>he</i> had gone and taken me with him, then everything was
surely all right.</p>

<p>I was glad too that they recognized me despite my unnatural size.
Indeed, I think they took a sort of pride in that I had, like
C&aelig;sar, "grown so great." We sat in front of the fire and I told
them all of our adventures as well as I could remember them.</p>

<p>It seemed strange that they, simple people though they were,
accepted my preposterous story of a journey to the Moon with no vestige
of doubt or disbelief. I feared there were no other humans in the
world&mdash;outside of Matthew Mugg, who would so receive my statement.
They asked me when I expected the Doctor's return. I told them what
Polynesia had said of the second smoke signal by which John Dolittle
planned to notify me of his departure from the Moon. But I had to admit
I felt none too sure of his escape from a land where his services were
so urgently demanded. Then when I almost broke down, accusing myself of
abandoning the Doctor, they both comforted me with assurances that I
could not have done more than I had.</p>

<p>Finally my mother insisted that I stay the night at their house and
not attempt to notify the Dolittle household until the morrow. I was
clearly overtired and worn out, she said. So, still willing to put off
the evil hour, I persuaded myself that I <i>was</i> tired and turned
in.</p>

<p>The next day I sought out Matthew Mugg, the Cats'-meat-Man. I merely
wanted his support when I should present myself at "the little house
with the big garden." But it took me two hours to answer all the
questions he fired at me about the Moon and our voyage.</p>

<p>At last I did get to the Doctor's house. My hand had hardly touched
the gate-latch before I was surrounded by them all. Too-Too the
vigilant sentinel had probably been on duty ever since we left and one
hoot from him brought the whole family into the front garden like a
fire alarm. A thousand exclamations and remarks about my increased
growth and changed appearance filled the air. But there never was a
doubt in their minds as to who I was.</p>

<p>And then suddenly a strange silence fell over them all when they saw
that I had returned alone. Surrounded by them I entered the house and
went to the kitchen. And there by the fireside, where the great man
himself has so often sat and told us tales, I related the whole story
of our visit to the Moon.</p>

<p>At the end they were nearly all in tears, Gub-Gub howling out
loud.</p>

<p>"We'll never see him again!" he wailed. "They'll never let him go.
Oh, Tommy, how <i>could</i> you have left him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, be quiet!" snapped Jip. "He couldn't help it. He was kidnapped.
Didn't he tell you? Don't worry. We'll watch for the smoke signal. John
Dolittle will come back to us, never fear. Remember he has Polynesia
with him."</p>

<p>"Aye!" squeaked the white mouse. "She'll find a way."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> am not worried," sniffed Dab-Dab, brushing away her tears
with one wing, and swatting some flies off the bread-board with the
other. "But it's sort of lonely here without him."</p>

<p>"Tut-tut!" grunted Too-Too. "Of course he'll come back!"</p>

<p>There was a tapping at the window.</p>

<p>"Cheapside," said Dab-Dab. "Let him in, Tommy."</p>

<p>I lifted the sash and the cockney sparrow fluttered in and took his
place upon the kitchen table, where he fell to picking up what
bread-crumbs had been left after the housekeeper's careful "clearing
away." Too-Too told him the situation in a couple of sentences.</p>

<p>"Why, bless my heart!" said the sparrow. "Why all these long faces?
John Dolittle stuck in the Moon!&mdash;Preposterous
notion!&mdash;<i>Pre</i>-posterous, I tell you. You couldn't get that
man stuck nowhere. My word, Dab-Dab! When you clear away you don't
leave much fodder behind, do you? Any mice what live in your 'ouse
shouldn't 'ave no difficulty keepin' their figures."</p>

<p>Well, it was done. And I was glad to be back in the old house. I
knew it was only a question of time before I would regain a normal size
on a normal diet. Meanwhile here I would not have to see anyone I did
not want to.</p>

<p>And so I settled down to pruning the fruit-trees, caring for the
comfort of the old horse in the stable and generally trying to take the
Doctor's place as best I could. And night after night as the year wore
on Jip, Too-Too and I would sit out, two at a time, while the Moon was
visible, to watch for the smoke signal. Often when we returned to the
house with the daylight, discouraged and unhappy, Jip would rub his
head against my leg and say:</p>

<p>"Don't worry, Tommy. He'll come back. Remember he has Polynesia with
him. Between them they will find a way."</p>
