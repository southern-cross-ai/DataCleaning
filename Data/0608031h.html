<p class="first">THE clank of the sour sentinels on the turrets,
the gusty uproar of the Spring winds, were not heard by those who
reveled in the cellar of Godfrey de Courtenay's castle; and the
noise these revelers made was bottled up deafeningly within the
massive walls.</p>

<p>A sputtering candle lighted those rugged walls, damp and
uninviting, flanked with wattled casks and hogsheads over which
stretched a veil of dusty cobwebs. From one barrel the head had
been knocked out, and leathern drinking-jacks were immersed again
and again in the foamy tide, in hands that grew increasingly
unsteady.</p>

<p>Agnes, one of the serving wenches, had stolen the massive iron
key to the cellar from the girdle of the steward; and rendered
daring by the absence of their master, a small but far from
select group were making merry with characteristic heedlessness
of the morrow.</p>

<p>Agnes, seated on the knee of the varlet Peter, beat erratic
time with a jack to a ribald song both were bawling in different
tunes and keys. The ale slopped over the rim of the wobbling jack
and down Peter's collar, a circumstance he was beyond
noticing.</p>

<p>The other wench, fat Marge, rolled on her bench and slapped
her ample thighs in uproarious appreciation of a spicy tale just
told by Giles Hobson. This individual might have been the lord of
the castle from his manner, instead of a vagabond rapscallion
tossed by every wind of adversity. Tilted back on a barrel,
booted feet propped on another, he loosened the belt that girdled
his capacious belly in its worn leather jerkin, and plunged his
muzzle once more into the frothing ale.</p>

<p>"Giles, by Saint Withold his beard," quoth Marge, "madder
rogue never wore steel. The very ravens that pick your bones on
the gibbet tree will burst their sides a-laughing. I hail
ye&mdash;prince of all bawdy liars!"</p>

<p>She flourished a huge pewter pot and drained it as stoutly as
any man in the realm.</p>

<p>At this moment another reveler, returning from an errand, came
into the scene. The door at the head of the stairs admitted a
wobbly figure in close-fitting velvet. Through the briefly opened
door sounded noises of the night&mdash;slap of hangings somewhere
in the house, sucking and flapping in the wind that whipped
through the crevices; a faint disgruntled hail from a watchman on
a tower. A gust of wind whooped down the stair and set the candle
to dancing.</p>

<p>Guillaume, the page, shoved the door shut and made his way
with groggy care down the rude stone steps. He was not so drunk
as the others, simply because, what of his extreme youth, he
lacked their capacity for fermented liquor.</p>

<p>"What's the time, boy?" demanded Peter.</p>

<p>"Long past midnight," the page answered, groping unsteadily
for the open cask. "The whole castle is asleep, save for the
watchmen. But I heard a clatter of hoofs through the wind and
rain; methinks 'tis Sir Godfrey returning."</p>

<p>"Let him return and be damned!" shouted Giles, slapping
Marge's fat haunch resoundingly. "He may be lord of the keep, but
at present we are keepers of the cellar! More ale! Agnes, you
little slut, another song!"</p>

<p>"Nay, more tales!" clamored Marge. "Our mistress's brother,
Sir Guiscard de Chastillon, has told grand tales of Holy Land and
the infidels, but by Saint Dunstan, Giles' lies outshine the
knight's truths!"</p>

<p>"Slander not a&mdash;hic!&mdash;holy man as has been on
pilgrimage and Crusade," hiccuped Peter. "Sir Guiscard has seen
Jerusalem and foughten beside the King of Palestine&mdash;how
many years?"</p>

<p>"Ten year come May Day, since he sailed to Holy Land," said
Agnes. "Lady Eleanor had not seen him in all that time, till he
rode up to the gate yesterday morn. Her husband, Sir Godfrey,
never has seen him."</p>

<p>"And wouldn't know him?" mused Giles; "nor Sir Guiscard
him?"</p>

<p>He blinked, raking a broad hand through his sandy mop. He was
drunker than even he realized. The world spun like a top and his
head seemed to be dancing dizzily on his shoulders. Out of the
fumes of ale and a vagrant spirit, a madcap idea was born.</p>

<p>A roar of laughter burst gustily from Giles' lips. He reeled
upright, spilling his jack in Marge's lap and bringing a burst of
rare profanity from her. He smote a barrelhead with his open
hand, strangling with mirth.</p>

<p>"Good lack!" squawked Agnes. "Are you daft, man?"</p>

<p>"A jest!" The roof reverberated to his bull's bellow. "Oh,
Saint Withold, a jest! Sir Guiscard knows not his brother-in-law,
and Sir Godfrey is now at the gate. Hark ye!"</p>

<p>Four heads, bobbing erratically, inclined toward him as he
whispered as if the rude walls might hear. An instant's bleary
silence was followed by boisterous guffaws. They were in the mood
to follow the maddest course suggested to them. Only Guillaume
felt some misgivings, but he was swept away by the alcoholic
fervor of his companions.</p>

<p>"Oh, a devil's own jest!" cried Marge, planting a loud, moist
kiss on Giles' ruddy cheek. "On, rogues, to the sport!"</p>

<p><i>"En avant!"</i> bellowed Giles, drawing his sword and
waving it unsteadily, and the five weaved up the stairs,
stumbling, blundering, and lurching against one another. They
kicked open the door, and shortly were running erratically up the
wide hall, giving tongue like a pack of hounds.</p>

<p>The castles of the Twelfth Century, fortresses rather than
mere dwellings, were built for defense, not comfort.</p>

<p>The hall through which the drunken band was hallooing was
broad, lofty, windy, strewn with rushes, now but faintly lighted
by the dying embers in a great ill-ventilated fireplace. Rude,
sail-like hangings along the walls rippled in the wind that found
its way through. Hounds, sleeping under the great table, woke
yelping as they were trodden on by blundering feet, and added
their clamor to the din.</p>

<p>This din roused Sir Guiscard de Chastillon from dreams of Acre
and the sun-drenched plains of Palestine. He bounded up, sword in
hand, supposing himself to be beset by Saracen raiders, then
realized where he was. But events seemed to be afoot. A medley of
shouts and shrieks clamored outside his door, and on the stout
oak panels boomed a rain of blows that bade fair to burst the
portal inward. The knight heard his name called loudly and
urgently.</p>

<p>Putting aside his trembling squire, he ran to the door and
cast it open. Sir Guiscard was a tall gaunt man, with a great
beak of a nose and cold grey eyes. Even in his shirt he was a
formidable figure. He blinked ferociously at the group limned
dimly in the glow from the coals at the other end of the hall.
There seemed to be women, children, a fat man with a sword.</p>

<p>This fat man was bawling: "Succor, Sir Guiscard, succor! The
castle is forced, and we are all dead men! The robbers of Horsham
Wood are within the hall itself!"</p>

<br>

castle is forced.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>Sir Guiscard heard the unmistakable tramp of mailed feet, saw
vague figures coming into the hall&mdash;figures on whose steel
the faint light gleamed redly. Still mazed by slumber, but
ferocious, he went into furious action.</p>

<p>Sir Godfrey de Courtenay, returning to his keep after many
hours of riding through foul weather, anticipated only rest and
ease in his own castle. Having vented his irritation by roundly
cursing the sleepy grooms who shambled up to attend his horses,
and were too bemused to tell him of his guest, he dismissed his
men-at-arms and strode into the donjon, followed by his squires
and the gentlemen of his retinue. Scarcely had he entered when
the devil's own bedlam burst loose in the hall. He heard a wild
stampede of feet, crash of overturned benches, baying of dogs,
and an uproar of strident voices, over which one bull-like bellow
triumphed.</p>

<p>Swearing amazedly, he ran up the hall, followed by his
knights, when a ravening maniac, naked but for a shirt, burst on
him, sword in hand, howling like a werewolf.</p>

<p>Sparks flew from Sir Godfrey's basinet beneath the madman's
furious strokes, and the lord of the castle almost succumbed to
the ferocity of that onslaught before he could draw his own
sword. He fell back, bellowing for his men-at-arms. But the
madman was yelling louder than he, and from all sides swarmed
other lunatics in shirts who assailed Sir Godfrey's dumfounded
gentlemen with howling frenzy.</p>

<p>The castle was in an uproar&mdash;lights flashing up, dogs
howling, women screaming, men cursing, and over all the clash of
steel and the stamp of mailed feet.</p>

<p>The conspirators, sobered by what they had raised, scattered
in all directions, seeking hiding-places&mdash;all except Giles
Hobson. His state of intoxication was too magnificent to be
perturbed by any such trivial scene. He admired his handiwork for
a space; then, finding swords flashing too close to his head for
comfort, withdrew, and following some instinct, departed for a
hiding-place known to him of old. There he found with gentle
satisfaction that he had all the time retained a cobwebbed bottle
in his hand. This he emptied, and its contents, coupled with what
had already found its way down his gullet, plunged him into
extinction for an amazing period. Tranquilly he snored under the
straw, while events took place above and around him, and matters
moved not slowly.</p>


<p><br>
THERE in the straw Friar Ambrose found him just
as dusk was falling after a harassed and harrying day. The friar,
ruddy and well paunched, shook the unpenitent one into bleary
wakefulness.</p>

<p>"The saints defend us!" said Ambrose. "Up to your old tricks
again! I thought to find you here. They have been searching the
castle all day for you; they searched these stables, too. Well
that you were hidden beneath a very mountain of hay."</p>

<p>"They do me too much honor," yawned Giles. "Why should they
search for me?"</p>

<p>The friar lifted his hands in pious horror.</p>

<p>"Saint Denis is my refuge against Sathanas and his works! Is
it not known how you were the ringleader in that madcap prank
last night that pitted poor Sir Guiscard against his sister's
husband?"</p>

<p>"Saint Dunstan!" quoth Giles, expectorating dryly. "How I
thirst! Were any slain?"</p>

<p>"No, by the providence of God. But there is many a broken
crown and bruised rib this day. Sir Godfrey nigh fell at the
first onset, for Sir Guiscard is a woundy swordsman. But our lord
being in full armor, he presently dealt Sir Guiscard a shrewd cut
over the pate, whereby blood did flow in streams, and Sir
Guiscard blasphemed in a manner shocking to hear. What had then
chanced, God only knows, but Lady Eleanor, awakened by the noise,
ran forth in her shift, and seeing her husband and her brother at
swords' points, she ran between them and bespoke them in words
not to be repeated. Verily, a flailing tongue hath our mistress
when her wrath is stirred.</p>

<p>"So understanding was reached, and a leech was fetched for Sir
Guiscard and such of the henchmen as had suffered scathe. Then
followed much discussion, and Sir Guiscard had recognized you as
one of those who banged on his door. Then Guillaume was
discovered hiding, as from a guilty conscience, and he confessed
all, putting the blame on you. Ah me, such a day as it has
been!</p>

<p>"Poor Peter in the stocks since dawn, and all the villeins and
serving-wenches and villagers gathered to clod him&mdash;they but
just now left off, and a sorry sight he is, with nose a-bleeding,
face skinned, an eye closed, and broken eggs in his hair and
dripping over his features. Poor Peter!</p>

<p>"And as for Agnes, Marge and Guillaume, they have had whipping
enough to content them all a lifetime. It would be hard to say
which of them has the sorest posterior. But it is you, Giles, the
masters wish. Sir Guiscard swears that only your life will
anyways content him."</p>

<p>"Hmmmm," ruminated Giles. He rose unsteadily, brushed the
straw from his garments, hitched up his belt and stuck his
disreputable bonnet on his head at a cocky angle.</p>

<p>The friar watched him gloomily. "Peter stocked, Guillaume
birched, Marge and Agnes whipped&mdash;what should be your
punishment?"</p>

<p>"Methinks I'll do penance by a long pilgrimage," said
Giles.</p>

<p>"You'll never get through the gates," predicted Ambrose.</p>

<p>"True," sighed Giles. "A friar may pass at will, where an
honest man is halted by suspicion and prejudice. As further
penance, lend me your robe."</p>

<p>"My robe?" exclaimed the friar. "You are a fool&mdash;"</p>

<p>A heavy fist <i>clunked</i> against his fat jaw, and he
collapsed with a whistling sigh.</p>

<p>A few minutes later a lout in the outer ward, taking aim with
a rotten egg at the dilapidated figure in the stocks, checked his
arm as a robed and hooded shape emerged from the stables and
crossed the open space with slow steps. The shoulders drooped as
from a weight of weariness, the head was bent forward; so much
so, in fact, that the features were hidden by the hood.</p>

<p>"The lout doffed his shabby cap and made a clumsy leg.</p>

<p>"God go wi' 'ee, good faither," he said.</p>

<p>"<i>Pax vobiscum</i>, my son," came the answer, low and
muffled from the depths of the hood.</p>

<p>The lout shook his head sympathetically as the robed figure
moved on, unhindered, in the direction of the postern gate.</p>

<p>"Poor Friar Ambrose," quoth the lout. "He takes the sin o' the
world so much to heart; there 'ee go, fair bowed down by the
wickedness o' men."</p>

<p>He sighed, and again took aim at the glum countenance that
glowered above the stocks.</p>

<p><br>
THROUGH the blue glitter of the Mediterranean wallowed a
merchant galley, clumsy, broad in the beam. Her square sail hung
limp on her one thick mast. The oarsmen, sitting on the benches
which flanked the waist deck on either side, tugged at the long
oars, bending forward and heaving back in machine-like unison.
Sweat stood out on their sun-burnt skin, their muscles rolled
evenly. From the interior of the hull came a chatter of voices,
the complaint of animals, a reek as of barnyards and stables.
This scent was observable some distance to leeward. To the south
the blue waters spread out like molten sapphire. To the north,
the gleaming sweep was broken by an island that reared up white
cliffs crowned with dark green. Dignity, cleanliness and serenity
reigned over all, except where that smelly, ungainly tub lurched
through the foaming water, by sound and scent advertising the
presence of man.</p>

<p>Below the waist-deck passengers, squatted among bundles, were
cooking food over small braziers. Smoke mingled with a reek of
sweat and garlic. Horses, penned in a narrow space, whinnied
wretchedly. Sheep, pigs and chickens added their aroma to the
smells.</p>

<p>Presently, amidst the babble below decks, a new sound floated
up to the people above&mdash;members of the crew, and the
wealtheir passengers who shared the <i>patrono's</i> cabin. The
voice of the <i>patrono</i> came to them, strident with
annoyance, answered by a loud rough voice with an alien
accent.</p>

<p>The Venetian captain, prodding among the butts and bales of
the cargo, had discovered a stowaway&mdash;a fat, sandy-haired
man in worn leather, snoring bibulously among the barrels.</p>

<p>Ensued an impassioned oratory in lurid Italian, the burden of
which at last focused in a demand that the stranger pay for his
passage.</p>

<p>"Pay?" echoed that individual, running thick fingers through
unkempt locks. "What should I pay with, Thin-shanks? Where am I?
What ship is this? Where are we going?"</p>

<p>"This is the <i>San Stefano,</i> bound for Cyprus from
Palermo."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," muttered the stowaway. "I remember. I came aboard
at Palermo&mdash;lay down beside a wine cask between the
bales&mdash;"</p>

<p>The <i>patrono</i> hastily inspected the cask and shrieked
with new passion.</p>

<p>"Dog! You've drunk it all!"</p>

<p>"How long have we been at sea?" demanded the intruder.</p>

<p>"Long enough to be out of sight of land," snarled the other.
"Pig, how can a man lie drunk so long&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No wonder my belly's empty," muttered the other. "I've lain
among the bales, and when I woke, I'd drink till I fell asleep
again. Hmmm!"</p>

<p>"Money!" clamored the Italian. "Bezants for your fare!"</p>

<p>"Bezants!" snorted the other. "I haven't a penny to my
name."</p>

<p>"Then overboard you go," grimly promised the <i>patrono.</i>
"There's no room for beggars aboard the <i>San Stefano</i>."</p>

<p>That struck a spark. The stranger gave vent to a warlike snort
and tugged at his sword.</p>

<p>"Throw me overboard into all that water? Not while Giles
Hobson can wield blade. A freeborn Englishman is as good as any
velvet-breeched Italian. Call your bullies and watch me bleed
them!"</p>

<p>From the deck came a loud call, strident with sudden fright.
"Galleys off the starboard bow! Saracens!"</p>

<p>A howl burst from the <i>patrono's</i> lips and his face went
ashy. Abandoning the dispute at hand, he wheeled and rushed up on
deck. Giles Hobson followed and gaped about him at the anxious
brown faces of the rowers, the frightened countenances of the
passengers&mdash;Latin priests, merchants and pilgrims. Following
their gaze, he saw three long low galleys shooting across the
blue expanse toward them. They were still some distance away, but
the people on the <i>San Stefano</i> could hear the faint clash
of cymbals, see the banners stream out from the mast heads. The
oars dipped into the blue water, came up shining silver.</p>

<p>"Put her about and steer for the island!" yelled the
<i>patrono</i>. "If we can reach it, we may hide and save our
lives. The galley is lost&mdash;and all the cargo! Saints defend
me!" He wept and wrung his hands, less from fear than from
disappointed avarice.</p>

<p>The <i>San Stefano</i> wallowed cumbrously about and waddled
hurriedly toward the white cliffs jutting in the sunlight. The
slim galleys came up, shooting through the waves like water
snakes. The space of dancing blue between the <i>San Stefano</i>
and the cliffs narrowed, but more swiftly narrowed the space
between the merchant and the raiders. Arrows began to arch
through the air and patter on the deck. One struck and quivered
near Giles Hobson's boot, and he gave back as if from a serpent.
The fat Englishman mopped perspiration from his brow. His mouth
was dry, his head throbbed, his belly heaved. Suddenly he was
violently seasick.</p>

<p>The oarsmen bent their backs, gasped, heaved mightily, seeming
almost to jerk the awkward craft out of the water. Arrows, no
longer arching, raked the deck. A man howled; another sank down
without a word. An oarsman flinched from a shaft through his
shoulder, and faltered in his stroke. Panic-stricken, the rowers
began to lose rhythm. The <i>San Stefano</i> lost headway and
rolled more wildly, and the passengers sent up a wail. From the
raiders came yells of exultation. They separated in a fan-shaped
formation meant to envelop the doomed galley.</p>

<p>On the merchant's deck the priests were shriving and
absolving.</p>

<p>"Holy Saints grant me&mdash;" gasped a gaunt Pisan, kneeling
on the boards&mdash;convulsively he clasped the feathered shaft
that suddenly vibrated in his breast, then slumped sidewise and
lay still.</p>

<p>An arrow thumped into the rail over which Giles Hobson hung,
quivered near his elbow. He paid no heed. A hand was laid on his
shoulder. Gagging, he turned his head, lifted a green face to
look into the troubled eyes of a priest.</p>

<p>"My son, this may be the hour of death; confess your sins and
I will shrive you."</p>

<p>"The only one I can think of," gasped Giles miserably, "is
that I mauled a priest and stole his robe to flee England
in."</p>

<p>"Alas, my son," the priest began, then cringed back with a low
moan. He seemed to bow to Giles; his head inclining still
further, he sank to the deck. From a dark welling spot on his
side jutted a Saracen arrow.</p>

<p>Giles gaped about him; on either hand a long slim galley was
sweeping in to lay the <i>San Stefano</i> aboard. Even as he
looked, the third galley, the one in the middle of the triangular
formation, rammed the merchant ship with a deafening splintering
of timber. The steel beak cut through the bulwarks, rending apart
the stern cabin. The concussion rolled men off their feet.
Others, caught and crushed in the collision, died howling
awfully. The other raiders ground alongside, and their steel-shod
prows sheared through the banks of oars, twisting the shafts out
of the oarsmen's hands, crushing the ribs of the wielders.</p>

<p>The grappling hooks bit into the bulwarks, and over the rail
came dark naked men with scimitars in their hands, their eyes
blazing. They were met by a dazed remnant who fought back
desperately.</p>

<p>Giles Hobson fumbled out his sword, strode groggily forward. A
dark shape flashed at him out of the melee. He got a dazed
impression of glittering eyes, and a curved blade hissing down.
He caught the stroke on his sword, staggering from the
spark-showering impact. Braced on wide straddling legs, he drove
his sword into the pirate's belly. Blood and entrails gushed
forth, and the dying corsair dragged his slayer to the deck with
him in his throes.</p>

<p>Feet booted and bare stamped on Giles Hobson as he strove to
rise. A curved dagger hooked at his kidneys, caught in his
leather jerkin and ripped the garment from hem to collar. He
rose, shaking the tatters from him. A dusky hand locked in his
ragged shirt, a mace hovered over his head. With a frantic jerk,
Giles pitched backward, to a sound of rending cloth, leaving the
torn shirt in his captor's hand. The mace met empty air as it
descended, and the wielder went to his knees from the wasted
blow. Giles fled along the blood-washed deck, twisting and
ducking to avoid struggling knots of fighters.</p>

<p>A handful of defenders huddled in the door of the forecastle.
The rest of the galley was in the hands of the triumphant
Saracens. They swarmed over the deck, down into the waist. The
animals squealed piteously as their throats were cut. Other
screams marked the end of the women and children dragged from
their hiding-places among the cargo.</p>

<p>In the door of the forecastle the bloodstained survivors
parried and thrust with notched swords. The pirates hemmed them
in, yelping mockingly, thrusting forward their pikes, drawing
back, springing in to hack and slash.</p>

<p>Giles sprang for the rail, intending to dive and swim for the
island. A quick step behind him warned him in time to wheel and
duck a scimitar. It was wielded by a stout man of medium height,
resplendent in silvered chain-mail and chased helmet, crested
with egret plumes.</p>

<p>Sweat misted the fat Englishman's sight; his wind was short;
his belly heaved, his legs trembled. The Moslem cut at his head.
Giles parried, struck back. His blade clanged against the chief's
mail. Something like a white-hot brand seared his temple, and he
was blinded by a rush of blood. Dropping his sword, he pitched
head-first against the Saracen, bearing him to the deck. The
Moslem writhed and cursed, but Giles' thick arms clamped
desperately about him.</p>

</div>
<br>

<p>Suddenly a wild shout went up. There was a rush of feet across
the deck. Men began to leap over the rail, to cast loose the
boarding-irons. Giles' captive yelled stridently, and men raced
across the deck toward him. Giles released him, ran like a bulky
cat along the bulwarks, and scrambled up over the roof of the
shattered poop cabin. None heeded him. Men naked but for
<i>tarboushes</i> hauled the mailed chieftain to his feet and
rushed him across the deck while he raged and blasphemed,
evidently wishing to continue the contest. The Saracens were
leaping into their own galleys and pushing away. And Giles,
crouching on the splintered cabin roof, saw the reason.</p>

<p>Around the western promontory of the island they had been
trying to reach, came a squadron of great red <i>dromonds,</i>
with battle-castles rearing at prow and stern. Helmets and
spearheads glittered in the sun. Trumpets blared, drums boomed.
From each masthead streamed a long banner bearing the emblem of
the Cross.</p>

<p>From the survivors aboard the <i>San Stefano</i> rose a shout
of joy. The galleys were racing southward. The nearest
<i>dromond</i> swung ponderously alongside, and brown faces
framed in steel looked over the rail.</p>

<p>"Ahoy, there!" rang a stern-voiced command. "You are sinking;
stand by to come aboard."</p>

<p>Giles Hobson started violently at that voice. He gaped up at
the battle-castle towering above the <i>San Stefano.</i> A
helmeted head bent over the bulwark, a pair of cold grey eyes met
his. He saw a great beak of a nose, a scar seaming the face from
the ear down the rim of the jaw.</p>

<p>Recognition was mutual. A year had not dulled Sir Guiscard de
Chastillon's resentment.</p>

<p>"So!" The yell rang bloodthirstily in Giles Hobson's ears. "At
last I have found you, rogue&mdash;"</p>

<p>Giles wheeled, kicked off his boots, ran to the edge of the
roof. He left it in a long dive, shot into the blue water with a
tremendous splash. His head bobbed to the surface, and he struck
out for the distant cliffs in long pawing strokes.</p>

<p>A mutter of surprize rose from the <i>dromond,</i> but Sir
Guiscard smiled sourly.</p>

<p>"A bow, varlet," he commanded.</p>

<p>It was placed in his hands. He nocked the arrow, waited until
Giles' dripping head appeared again in a shallow trough between
the waves. The bowstring twanged, the arrow flashed through the
sunlight like a silver beam. Giles Hobson threw up his arms and
disappeared. Nor did Sir Guiscard see him rise again, though the
knight watched the waters for some time.</p>

<p><br>
TO Shawar, vizier of Egypt, in his palace in el-Fustat, came a
gorgeously robed eunuch who, with many abased supplications, as
the due of the most powerful man in the caliphate, announced:
"The Emir Asad ed din Shirkuh, lord of Emesa and Rahba, general
of the armies of Nour ed din, Sultan of Damascus, has returned
from the ships of el Ghazi with a Nazarene captive, and desires
audience."</p>

<p>A nod of acquiescence was the vizier's only sign, but his slim
white fingers twitched at his jewel-encrusted white
girdle&mdash;sure evidence of mental unrest.</p>

<p>Shawar was an Arab, a slim, handsome figure, with the keen
dark eyes of his race. He wore the silken robes and pearl-sewn
turban of his office as if he had been born to them&mdash;instead
of to the black felt tents from which his sagacity had lifted
him.</p>

<p>The Emir Shirkuh entered like a storm, booming forth his
salutations in a voice more fitted for the camp than for the
council chamber. He was a powerfully built man of medium height,
with a face like a hawk's. His <i>khalat</i> was of watered silk,
worked with gold thread, but like his voice, his hard body seemed
more fitted for the harness of war than the garments of peace.
Middle age had dulled none of the restless fire in his dark
eyes.</p>

<p>With him was a man whose sandy hair and wide blue eyes
contrasted incongruously with the voluminous bag trousers, silken
<i>khalat</i> and turned-up slippers which adorned him.</p>

<p>"I trust that Allah granted you fortune upon the sea, <i>ya
khawand</i>?" courteously inquired the vizier.</p>

<p>"Of a sort," admitted Shirkuh, casting himself down on the
cushions. "We fared far, Allah knows, and at first my guts were
like to gush out of my mouth with the galloping of the ship,
which went up and down like a foundered camel. But later Allah
willed that the sickness should pass."</p>

<p>"We sank a few wretched pilgrims' galleys and sent to Hell the
infidels therein&mdash;which was good, but the loot was wretched
stuff. But look ye, lord vizier, did you ever see a Caphar like
to this man?"</p>

<br>

"But look ye, lord vizier, did you ever see a Caphar like
to this man?"</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>The man returned the vizier's searching stare with wide
guileless eyes.</p>

<p>"Such as he I have seen among the Franks of Jerusalem," Shawar
decided.</p>

<p>Shirkuh grunted and began to munch grapes with scant ceremony,
tossing a bunch to his captive.</p>

<p>"Near a certain island we sighted a galley," he said, between
mouthfuls, "and we ran upon it and put the folk to the sword.
Most of them were miserable fighters, but this man cut his way
clear and would have sprung overboard had I not intercepted him.
By Allah, he proved himself strong as a bull! My ribs are yet
bruised from his hug.</p>

<p>"But in the midst of the melee up galloped a herd of ships
full of Christian warriors, bound&mdash;as we later
learned&mdash;for Ascalon; Frankish adventurers seeking their
fortune in Palestine. We put the spurs to our galleys, and as I
looked back I saw the man I had been fighting leap overboard and
swim toward the cliffs. A knight on a Nazarene ship shot an arrow
at him and he sank, to his death, I supposed.</p>

<p>"Our water butts were nearly empty. We did not run far. As
soon as the Frankish ships were out of sight over the skyline, we
beat back to the island for fresh water. And we found, fainting
on the beach, a fat, naked, red-haired man whom I recognized as
he whom I had fought. The arrow had not touched him; he had dived
deep and swum far under the water. But he had bled much from a
cut I had given him on the head, and was nigh dead from
exhaustion.</p>

<p>"Because he had fought me well, I took him into my cabin and
revived him, and in the days that followed he learned to speak
the speech we of Islam hold with the accursed Nazarenes. He told
me that he was a bastard son of the king of England, and that
enemies had driven him from his father's court, and were hunting
him over the world. He swore the king his father would pay a
mighty ransom for him, so I make you a present of him. For me,
the pleasure of the cruise is enough. To you shall go the ransom
the <i>malik</i> of England pays for his son. He is a merry
companion who can tell a tale, quaff a flagon, and sing a song as
well as any man I have ever known."</p>

<p>Shawar scanned Giles Hobson with new interest. In that
rubicund countenance he failed to find any evidence of royal
parentage, but reflected that few Franks showed royal lineage in
their features: ruddy, freckled, light-haired, the western lords
looked much alike to the Arab.</p>

<p>He turned his attention again to Shirkuh, who was of more
importance than any wandering Frank, royal or common. The old
war-dog, with shocking lack of formality, was humming a Kurdish
war song under his breath as he poured a goblet of Shiraz
wine&mdash;the Shiite rulers of Egypt were no stricter in their
morals than were their Mameluke successors.</p>

<p>Apparently Shirkuh had no thought in the world except to
satisfy his thirst, but Shawar wondered what craft was revolving
behind that bluff exterior. In another man Shawar would have
despised the Emir's restless vitality as an indication of an
inferior mentality. But the Kurdish right-hand man of Nour ed din
was no fool. The vizier wondered if Shirkuh had embarked on that
wild-goose chase with el Ghazi's corsairs merely because his
restless energy would not let him be quiet, even during a visit
to the caliph's court, or if there was a deeper meaning behind
his voyaging. Shawar always looked for hidden motives, even in
trivial things. He had reached his position by ignoring no
possibility of intrigue. Moreover, events were stirring in the
womb of Destiny in that early spring of 1167 A.D.</p>

<p>Shawar thought of Dirgham's bones rotting in a ditch near the
chapel of Sitta Nefisa, and he smiled and said: "A thousand
thanks for your gifts, my lord. In return a jade goblet filled
with pearls shall be carried to your chamber. Let this exchange
of gifts symbolize the everlasting endurance of our
friendship."</p>

<p>"Allah fill thy mouth with gold, lord," boomed Shirkuh,
rising; "I go to drink wine with my officers, and tell them lies
of my voyagings. Tomorrow I ride for Damascus. Allah be with
thee!"</p>

<p>"And with thee, <i>ya khawand</i>."</p>

<p>After the Kurd's springy footfalls had ceased to rustle the
thick carpets of the halls, Shawar motioned Giles to sit beside
him on the cushions.</p>

<p>"What of your ransom?" he asked, in the Norman French he had
learned through contact with the Crusaders.</p>

<p>"The king my father will fill this chamber with gold,"
promptly answered Giles. "His enemies have told him I was dead.
Great will be the joy of the old man to learn the truth."</p>

<p>So saying, Giles retired behind a wine goblet and racked his
brain for bigger and better lies. He had spun this fantasy for
Shirkuh, thinking to make himself sound too valuable to be
killed. Later&mdash;well, Giles lived for today, with little
thought of the morrow.</p>

<p>Shawar watched, in some fascination, the rapid disappearance
of the goblet's contents down his prisoner's gullet.</p>

<p>"You drink like a French baron," commented the Arab.</p>

<p>"I am the prince of all topers," answered Giles
modestly&mdash;and with more truth than was contained in most of
his boastings.</p>

<p>"Shirkuh, too, loves wine," went on the vizier. "You drank
with him?"</p>

<p>"A little. He wouldn't get drunk, lest we sight a Christian
ship. But we emptied a few flagons. A little wine loosens his
tongue."</p>

<p>Shawar's narrow dark head snapped up; that was news to
him.</p>

<p>"He talked? Of what?"</p>

<p>"Of his ambitions."</p>

<p>"And what are they?" Shawar held his breath.</p>

<p>"To be Caliph of Egypt," answered Giles, exaggerating the
Kurd's actual words, as was his habit. Shirkuh had talked wildly,
though rather incoherently.</p>

<p>"Did he mention me?" demanded the vizier.</p>

<p>"He said he held you in the hollow of his hand," said Giles,
truthfully, for a wonder.</p>

<p>Shawar fell silent; somewhere in the palace a lute twanged and
a black girl lifted a weird whining song of the South. Fountains
splashed silverly, and there was a flutter of pigeons' wings.</p>

<p>"If I send emissaries to Jerusalem his spies will tell him,"
murmured Shawar to himself. "If I slay or constrain him, Nour ed
din will consider it cause for war."</p>

<p>He lifted his head and stared at Giles Hobson.</p>

<p>"You call yourself king of topers; can you best the Emir
Shirkuh in a drinking-bout?"</p>

<p>"In the palace of the king, my father," said Giles, "in one
night I drank fifty barons under the table, the least of which
was a mightier toper than Shirkuh."</p>

<p>"Would you win your freedom without ransom?"</p>

<p>"Aye, by Saint Withold!"</p>

<p>"You can scarcely know much of Eastern politics, being but
newly come into these parts. But Egypt is the keystone of the
arch of empire. It is coveted by Amalric, king of Jerusalem, and
Nour ed din, sultan of Damascus. Ibn Ruzzik, and after him
Dirgham, and after him, I, have played one against the other. By
Shirkuh's aid I overthrew Dirgham; by Amalric's aid, I drove out
Shirkuh. It is a perilous game, for I can trust neither.</p>

<p>"Nour ed din is cautious. Shirkuh is the man to fear. I think
he came here professing friendship in order to spy me out, to
lull my suspicions. Even now his army may be moving on Egypt.</p>

<p>"If he boasted to you of his ambitions and power, it is a sure
sign that he feels secure in his plots. It is necessary that I
render him helpless for a few hours; yet I dare not do him harm
without true knowledge of whether his hosts are actually on the
march. So this is your part."</p>

<p>Giles understood and a broad grin lit his ruddy face, and he
licked his lips sensuously.</p>

<p>Shawar clapped his hands and gave orders, and presently, at
request, Shirkuh entered, carrying his silk-girdled belly before
him like an emperor of India.</p>

<p>"Our royal guest," purred Shawar, "has spoken of his prowess
with the wine-cup. Shall we allow a Caphar to go home and boast
among his people that he sat above the Faithful in anything? Who
is more capable of humbling his pride than the Mountain
Lion?"</p>

<p>"A drinking-bout?" Shirkuh's laugh was gusty as a sea blast.
"By the beard of Muhammad, it likes me well! Come, Giles ibn
Malik, let us to the quaffing!"</p>

<p>A procession began, of slaves bearing golden vessels brimming
with sparkling nectar...</p>

<p>During his captivity on el Ghazi's galley, Giles had become
accustomed to the heady wine of the East. But his blood was
boiling in his veins, his head was singing, and the gold-barred
chamber was revolving to his dizzy gaze before Shirkuh, his voice
trailing off in the midst of an incoherent song, slumped sidewise
on his cushions, the gold beaker tumbling from his fingers.</p>

<p>Shawar leaped into frantic activity. At his clap Sudanese
slaves entered, naked giants with gold earrings and silk
loinclouts.</p>

<p>"Carry him into the alcove and lay him on a divan," he
ordered. "Lord Giles, can you ride?"</p>

<p>Giles rose, reeling like a ship in a high wind.</p>

<p>"I'll hold to the mane," he hiccuped. "But why should I
ride?"</p>

<p>"To bear my message to Amalric," snapped Shawar. "Here it is,
sealed in a silken packet, telling him that Shirkuh means to
conquer Egypt, and offering him payment in return for aid.
Amalric distrusts me, but he will listen to one of the royal
blood of his own race, who tells him of Shirkuh's boasts."</p>

<p>"Aye," muttered Giles groggily, "royal blood; my grandfather
was a horse-boy in the royal stables."</p>

<p>"What did you say?" demanded Shawar, not understanding, then
went on before Giles could answer. "Shirkuh has played into our
hands. He will lie senseless for hours, and while he lies there,
you will be riding for Palestine. He will not ride for Damascus
tomorrow; he will be sick of overdrunkenness. I dared not
imprison him, or even drug his wine. I dare make no move until I
reach an agreement with Amalric. But Shirkuh is safe for the time
being, and you will reach Amalric before he reaches Nour ed din.
Haste!"</p>

<p><br>
IN the courtyard outside sounded the clink of harness, the
impatient stamp of horses. Voices blurred in swift whispers.
Footfalls faded away through the halls. Alone in the alcove,
Shirkuh unexpectedly sat upright. He shook his head violently,
buffeted it with his hands as if to clear away the clinging
cobwebs. He reeled up, catching at the arras for support. But his
beard bristled in an exultant grin. He seemed bursting with a
triumphant whoop he could scarcely restrain. Stumblingly he made
his way to a gold-barred window. Under his massive hands the thin
gold rods twisted and buckled. He tumbled through, pitching
headfirst to the ground in the midst of a great rose bush.
Oblivious of bruises and scratches, he rose, careening like a
ship on a tack, and oriented himself. He was in a broad garden;
all about him waved great white blossoms; a breeze shook the palm
leaves, and the moon was rising.</p>

<p>None halted him as he scaled the wall, though thieves skulking
in the shadows eyed his rich garments avidly as he lurched
through the deserted streets.</p>

<p>By devious ways he came to his own quarters and kicked his
slaves awake.</p>

<p>"Horses, Allah curse you!" His voice crackled with
exultation.</p>

<p>Ali, his captain of horse, came from the shadows.</p>

<p>"What now, lord?"</p>

<p>"The desert and Syria beyond!" roared Shirkuh, dealing him a
terrific buffet on the back. "Shawar has swallowed the bait!
Allah, how drunk I am! The world reels&mdash;but the stars are
mine!</p>

<p>"That bastard Giles rides to Amalric&mdash;I heard Shawar give
him his instructions as I lay in feigned slumber. We have forced
the vizier's hand! Now Nour ed din will not hesitate, when his
spies bring him news from Jerusalem of the marching of the iron
men! I fumed in the caliph's court, checkmated at every turn by
Shawar, seeking a way. I went into the galleys of the corsairs to
cool my brain, and Allah gave into my hands a red-haired tool! I
filled the lord Giles full of 'drunken' boastings, hoping he
would repeat them to Shawar, and that Shawar would take fright
and send for Amalric&mdash;which would force our overly cautious
sultan to act. Now follow marching and war and the glutting of
ambition. But let us ride, in the devil's name!"</p>

<p>A few minutes later the Emir and his small retinue were
clattering through the shadowy streets, past gardens that slept,
a riot of color under the moon, lapping six-storied palaces that
were dreams of pink marble and lapis lazuli and gold.</p>

<p>At a small, secluded gate, a single sentry bawled a challenge
and lifted his pike.</p>

<p>"Dog!" Shirkuh reined his steed back on its haunches and hung
over the Egyptian like a silk-clad cloud of death. "It is
Shirkuh, your master's guest!"</p>

<p>"But my orders are to allow none to pass without written
order, signed and sealed by the vizier," protested the soldier.
"What shall I say to Shawar&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You will say naught," prophesied Shirkuh. "The dead speak
not."</p>

<p>His scimitar gleamed and fell, and the soldier crumpled, cut
through helmet and head.</p>

<br>

</div>
<br>

<p>"Open the gate, Ali," laughed Shirkuh. "It is Fate that rides
tonight&mdash;Fate and Destiny!"</p>

<p>In a cloud of moon-bathed dust they whirled out of the gate
and over the plain. On the rocky shoulder of Mukattam, Shirkuh
drew rein to gaze back over the city, which lay like a legendary
dream under the moonlight, a waste of masonry and stone and
marble, splendor and squalor merging in the moonlight,
magnificence blent with ruin. To the south the dome of Imam Esh
Shafi'y shone beneath the moon; to the north loomed up the
gigantic pile of the Castle of El Kahira, its walls carved
blackly out of the white moonlight. Between them lay the remains
and ruins of three capitals of Egypt; palaces with their mortar
yet undried reared beside crumbling walls haunted only by
bats.</p>

<p>Shirkuh laughed, and yelled with pure joy. His horse reared
and his scimitar glittered in the air.</p>

<p>"A bride in cloth-of-gold! Await my coming, oh Egypt, for when
I come again, it will be with spears and horsemen, to seize ye in
my hands!"</p>

<p><br>
ALLAH willed it that Amalric, king of Jerusalem, should be in
Darum, personally attending to the fortifying of that small
desert outpost, when the envoys from Egypt rode through the
gates. A restless, alert and wary king was Amalric, bred to war
and intrigue.</p>

<p>In the castle hall the Egyptian emissaries salaamed before him
like corn bending before a wind, and Giles Hobson, grotesque in
his dusty silks and white turban, louted awkwardly and presented
the sealed packet of Shawar.</p>

<p>Amalric took it with his own hands and read it, striding
absently up and down the hall, a gold-maned lion, stately, yet
dangerously supple.</p>

<p>"What talk is this of royal bastards?" he demanded suddenly,
staring at Giles, who was nervous but not embarrassed.</p>

<p>"A lie to cozen the paynim, your majesty," admitted the
Englishman, secure in his belief that the Egyptians did not
understand Norman French. "I am no illegitimate of the blood,
only the honest-born younger son of a baron of the Scottish
marches."</p>

<p>Giles did not care to be kicked into the scullery with the
rest of the varlets. The nearer the purple, the richer the
pickings. It seemed safe to assume that the king of Jerusalem was
not over-familiar with the nobility of the Scottish border.</p>

<p>"I have seen many a younger son who lacked coat-armor, war-cry
and wealth, but was none the less worthy," said Amalric. "You
shall not go unrewarded. Messer Giles, know you the import of
this message?"</p>

<p>"The wazeer Shawar spoke to me at some length," admitted
Giles.</p>

<p>"The ultimate fate of Outremer hangs in the balance," said
Amalric. "If the same man holds both Egypt and Syria, we are
caught in the jaws of the vise. Better for Shawar to rule in
Egypt, than Nour ed din. We march for Cairo. Would you accompany
the host?"</p>

<p>"In sooth, lord," began Giles, "it has been a wearisome
time&mdash;"</p>

<p>"True," broke in Amalric. "'Twere better that you ride on to
Acre and rest from your travels. I will give you a letter for the
lord commanding there. Sir Guiscard de Chastillon will give you
service&mdash;"</p>

<p>Giles started violently.</p>

<p>"Nay, Lord," he said hurriedly, "duty calls, and what are
weary limbs and an empty belly beside duty? Let me go with you
and do my devoir in Egypt!"</p>

<p>"Your spirit likes me well, Messer Giles," said Amalric with
an approving smile. "Would that all the foreigners who come
adventuring in Outremer were like you."</p>

<p>"And they were," quietly murmured an immobile-faced Egyptian
to his mate, "not all the wine-vats of Palestine would suffice.
We will tell a tale to the vizier concerning this liar."</p>

<p>But lies or not, in the grey dawn of a young spring day, the
iron men of Outremer rode southward, with the great banner
billowing over their helmeted heads, and their spear-points
coldly glinting in the dim light.</p>

<p>There were not many; the strength of the Crusading kingdoms
lay in the quality, not the quantity, of their defenders. Three
hundred and seventy-five knights took the road to Egypt: nobles
of Jerusalem, barons whose castles guarded the eastern marches,
Knights of Saint John in their white surcoats, grim Templars,
adventurers from beyond the sea, their skins yet ruddy from the
cold sun of the north.</p>

<p>With them rode a swarm of Turcoples, Christianized Turks, wiry
men on lean ponies. After the horsemen lumbered the wagons,
attended by the rag-and-tag camp followers, the servants,
ragamuffins and trolls that tag after any host. With shining,
steel-sheathed, banner-crowned van, and rear trailing out into
picturesque squalor, the army of Jerusalem moved across the
land.</p>

<p>The dunes of the Jifar knew again the tramp of shod horses,
the clink of mail. The iron men were riding again the old road of
war, the road their fathers had ridden so oft before them.</p>

<p>Yet when at last the Nile broke the monotony of the level
land, winding like a serpent feathered with green palms, they
heard the strident clamor of cymbals and <i>nakirs,</i> and saw
egret feathers moving among gay-striped pavilions that bore the
colors of Islam. Shirkuh had reached the Nile before them, with
seven thousand horsemen.</p>

<p>Mobility was always an advantage possessed by the Moslems. It
took time to gather the cumbrous Frankish host, time to move
it.</p>

<p>Riding like a man possessed, the Mountain Lion had reached Nor
ed din, told his tale, and then, with scarcely a pause, had raced
southward again with the troops he had held in readiness since
the first Egyptian campaign. The thought of Amalric in Egypt had
sufficed to stir Nour ed din to action. If the Crusaders made
themselves masters of the Nile, it meant the eventual doom of
Islam.</p>

<p>Shirkuh's was the dynamic vitality of the nomad. Across the
desert by Wadi el Ghizlan he had driven his riders until even the
tough Seljuks reeled in their saddles. Into the teeth of a
roaring sandstorm he had plunged, fighting like a madman for each
mile, each second of time. He had crossed the Nile at Atfih, and
now his riders were regaining their breath, while Shirkuh watched
the eastern skyline for the moving forest of lances that would
mark the coming of Amalric.</p>

<p>The king of Jerusalem dared not attempt a crossing in the
teeth of his enemies; Shirkuh was in the same case. Without
pitching camp, the Franks moved northward along the river bank.
The iron men rode slowly, scanning the sullen stream for a
possible crossing.</p>

<p>The Moslems broke camp and took up the march, keeping pace
with the Franks. The <i>fellaheen,</i> peeking from their mud
huts, were amazed by the sight of two hosts moving slowly in the
same direction without hostile demonstration, with the river
between.</p>

<p>So they came at last into sight of the towers of El
Kahira.</p>

<p>The Franks pitched their camp close to the shores of Birket el
Habash, near the gardens of el Fustat, whose six-storied houses
reared their flat roofs among oceans of palms and waving
blossoms. Across the river Shirkuh encamped at Gizeh, in the
shadow of the scornful colossus reared by cryptic monarchs
forgotten before his ancestors were born.</p>

<p>Matters fell at a deadlock. Shirkuh, for all his impetuosity,
had the patience of the Kurd, imponderable as the mountains which
bred him. He was content to play a waiting game, with the broad
river between him and the terrible swords of the Europeans.</p>

<p><br>
SHAWAR waited on Amalric with pomp and parade and the clamor
of <i>nakirs,</i> and he found the lion as wary as he was
indomitable. Two hundred thousand <i>dinars</i> and the caliph's
hand on the bargain, that was the price he demanded for Egypt.
And Shawar knew he must pay. Egypt slumbered as she had slumbered
for a thousand years, inert alike under the heel of Macedonian,
Roman, Arab, Turk or Fatimid. The <i>fellah</i> toiled in his
field, and scarcely knew to whom he paid his taxes. There was no
land of Egypt: it was a myth, a cloak for a despot. Shawar was
Egypt; Egypt was Shawar; the price of Egypt was the price of
Shawar's head.</p>

<p>So the Frankish ambassadors went to the hall of the
caliph.</p>

<p>Mystery ever shrouded the person of the Incarnation of Divine
Reason. The spiritual center of the Shiite creed moved in a maze
of mystic inscrutability, his veil of supernatural awe increasing
as his political power was usurped by plotting viziers. No Frank
had ever seen the caliph of Egypt.</p>

<p>Hugh of Caesarea and Geoffrey Fulcher, Master of the Templars,
were chosen for the mission, blunt war-dogs, grim as their own
swords. A group of mailed horsemen accompanied them.</p>

<p>They rode through the flowering gardens of el Fustat, past the
chapel of Sitta Nefisa where Dirgham had died under the hands of
the mob; through winding streets which covered the ruins of el
Askar and el Katai; past the Mosque of Ibn Tulun, and the Lake of
the Elephant, into the teeming streets of El Mansuriya, the
quarter of the Sudanese, where weird native citterns twanged in
the houses, and swaggering black men, gaudy in silk and gold,
stared childishly at the grim horsemen.</p>

<p>At the Gate Zuweyla the riders halted, and the Master of the
Temple and the lord of Caesarea rode on, attended by only one
man&mdash;Giles Hobson. The fat Englishman wore good leather and
chain-mail, and a sword at his thigh, though the portly arch of
his belly somewhat detracted from his war-like appearance. Little
thought was being taken in those perilous times of royal bastards
or younger sons; but Giles had won the approval of Hugh of
Caesarea, who loved a good tale and a bawdy song.</p>

<p>At Zuweyla gate Shawar met them with pomp and pageantry and
escorted them through the bazaars and the Turkish quarter where
hawk-like men from beyond the Oxus stared and silently spat. For
the first time, Franks in armor were riding through the streets
of El Kahira.</p>

<p>At the gates of the Great East Palace the ambassadors gave up
their swords, and followed the vizier through dim tapestry-hung
corridors and gold arched doors where tongueless Sudanese stood
like images of black silence, sword in hand. They crossed an open
court bordered by fretted arcades supported by marble columns;
their iron-clad feet rang on mosaic paving. Fountains jetted
their silver sheen into the air, peacocks spread their iridescent
plumage, parrots fluttered on gold threads. In broad halls jewels
glittered for eyes of birds wrought of silver or gold. So they
came at last to the vast audience room, with its ceiling of
carved ebony and ivory. Courtiers in silks and jewels knelt
facing a broad curtain heavy with gold and sewn with pearls that
gleamed against its satin darkness like stars in a midnight
sky.</p>

<p>Shawar prostrated himself thrice to the carpeted floor. The
curtains were swept apart, and the wondering Franks gazed on the
gold throne, where, in robes of white silk, sat al Adhid, Caliph
of Egypt.</p>

<p>They saw a slender youth, dark almost to negroid, whose hands
lay limp, whose eyes seemed already shadowed by ultimate sleep. A
deadly weariness clung about him, and he listened to the
representations of his vizier as one who heeds a tale too often
told.</p>

<p>But a flash of awakening came to him when Shawar suggested,
with extremest delicacy, that the Franks wished his hand upon the
pact. A visible shudder passed through the room. Al Adhid
hesitated, then extended his gloved hand. Sir Hugh's voice boomed
through the breathless hall.</p>

<p>"Lord, the good faith of princes is naked; troth is not
clothed."</p>

<p>All about came a hissing intake of breath. But the Caliph
smiled, as at the whims of a barbarian, and stripping the glove
from his hand, laid his slender fingers in the bear-like paw of
the Crusader.</p>

<p>All this Giles Hobson observed from his discreet position in
the background. All eyes were centered on the group clustered
about the golden throne. From near his shoulder a soft hiss
reached Giles' ear. Its feminine note brought him quickly about,
forgetful of kings and caliphs. A heavy tapestry was drawn
slightly aside, and in the sweet-smelling gloom, a slender white
hand waved invitingly. Another scent made itself evident, a
luring perfume, subtle yet unmistakable.</p>

<p>Giles turned silently and pulled aside the tapestry, straining
his eyes in the semidarkness. There was an alcove behind the
hangings, and a narrow corridor meandering away. Before him stood
a figure whose vagueness did not conceal its lissomeness. A pair
of eyes glowed and sparkled at him, and his head swam with the
power of that diabolical perfume.</p>

<p>He let the tapestry fall behind him. Through the hangings the
voices in the throne room came vague and muffled.</p>

<p>The woman spoke not; her little feet made no sound on the
thickly carpeted floor over which he stumbled. She invited, yet
retreated; she beckoned, yet she withheld herself. Only when,
baffled, he broke into earnest profanity, she admonished him with
a finger to her lips and a warning: "Sssssh!"</p>

She invited, yet retreated...</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>"Devil take you, wench!" he swore, stopping short. "I'll
follow you no more. What manner of game is this, anyway? If you
don't want to deal with me, why did you wave at me? Why do you
beckon and then run away? I'm going back to the audience hall and
may the dogs bite your&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait!" The voice was liquid sweet.</p>

<p>She glided close to him, laying her hands on his shoulders.
What light there was in the winding tapestried corridor was
behind her, outlining her supple figure through her filmy
garments. Her flesh shone like dim ivory in the purple gloom.</p>

<p>"I could love you," she whispered.</p>

<p>"Well, what detains you?" he demanded uneasily.</p>

<p>"Not here; follow me." She glided out of his groping arms and
drifted ahead of him, a lithely swaying ghost among the velvet
hangings.</p>

<p>He followed, burning with impatience and questing not at all
for the reason of the whole affair, until she came out into an
octagonal chamber, almost as dimly lighted as had been the
corridor. As he pushed after her, a hanging slid over the opening
behind him. He gave it no heed. Where he was he neither knew nor
cared. All that was important to him was the supple figure that
posed shamelessly before him, veilless, naked arms uplifted and
slender fingers intertwined behind her nape over which fell a
mass of hair that was like black burnished foam.</p>

<p>He stood struck dumb with her beauty. She was like no other
woman he had ever seen; the difference was not only in her dark
eyes, her dusky tresses, her long kohl-tinted lashes, or the warm
ivory of her roundly slender limbs. It was in every glance, each
movement, each posture, that made voluptuousness an art. Here was
a woman cultured in the arts of pleasure, a dream to madden any
lover of the fleshpots of life. The English, French and Venetian
women he had nuzzled seemed slow, stolid, frigid beside this
vibrant image of sensuality. A favorite of the Caliph! The
implication of the realization sent the blood pounding
suffocatingly through his veins. He panted for breath.</p>

<p>"Am I not fair?" Her breath, scented with the perfume that
sweetened her body, fanned his face. The soft tendrils of her
hair brushed against his cheek. He groped for her, but she eluded
him with disconcerting ease. "What will you do for me?"</p>

<p>"Anything!" he swore ardently, and with more sincerity than he
usually voiced the vow.</p>

<p>His hand closed on her wrist and he dragged her to him; his
other arm bent about her waist, and the feel of her resilient
flesh made him drunk. He pawed for her lips with his, but she
bent supplely backward, twisting her head this way and that,
resisting him with unexpected strength; the lithe pantherish
strength of a dancing-girl. Yet even while she resisted him, she
did not repulse him.</p>

<p>"Nay," she laughed, and her laughter was the gurgle of a
silver fountain; "first there is a price!"</p>

<p>"Name it, for the love of the Devil!" he gasped. "Am I a
frozen saint? I can not resist you forever!" He had released her
wrist and was pawing at her shoulder straps.</p>

<p>Suddenly she ceased to struggle; throwing both arms about his
thick neck, she looked into his eyes. The depths of hers, dark
and mysterious, seemed to drown him; he shuddered as a wave of
something akin to fear swept over him.</p>

<p>"You are high in the council of the Franks!" she breathed. "We
know you disclosed to Shawar that you are a son of the English
king. You came with Amalric's ambassadors. You know his plans.
Tell what I wish to know, and I am yours! What is Amalric's next
move?"</p>

<p>"He will build a bridge of boats and cross the Nile to attack
Shirkuh by night," answered Giles without hesitation.</p>

<p>Instantly she laughed, with mockery and indescribable malice,
struck him in the face, twisted free, sprang back, and cried out
sharply. The next moment the shadows were alive with rushing
figures as from the tapestries leaped naked black giants.</p>

<p>Giles wasted no time in futile gestures toward his empty belt.
As great dusky hands fell on him, his massive fist smashed
against bone, and the Negro dropped with a fractured jaw.
Springing over him, Giles scudded across the room with unexpected
agility. But to his dismay he saw that the doorways were hidden
by the tapestries. He groped frantically among the hangings; then
a brawny arm hooked throttlingly about his throat from behind,
and he felt himself dragged backward and off his feet. Other
hands snatched at him, woolly heads bobbed about him, white
eyeballs and teeth glimmered in the semi-darkness. He lashed out
savagely with his foot and caught a big black in the belly,
curling him up in agony on the floor. A thumb felt for his eye
and he mangled it between his teeth, bringing a whimper of pain
from the owner. But a dozen pairs of hands lifted him, smiting
and kicking. He heard a grating, sliding noise, felt himself
swung up violently and hurled downward&mdash;a black opening in
the floor rushed up to meet him. An ear-splitting yell burst from
him, and then he was rushing headlong down a walled shaft, up
which sounded the sucking and bubbling of racing water.</p>

<p>He hit with a tremendous splash and felt himself swept
irresistibly onward. The well was wide at the bottom. He had
fallen near one side of it, and was being carried toward the
other in which, he had light enough to see as he rose blowing and
snorting above the surface, another black orifice gaped. Then he
was thrown with stunning force against the edge of that opening,
his legs and hips were sucked through but his frantic fingers,
slipping from the mossy stone lip, encountered something and
clung on. Looking wildly up, he saw, framed high above him in the
dim light, a cluster of woolly heads rimming the mouth of the
well. Then abruptly all light was shut out as the trap was
replaced, and Giles was conscious only of utter blackness and the
rustle and swirl of the racing water that dragged relentlessly at
him.</p>

<p>This, Giles knew, was the well into which were thrown foes of
the Caliph. He wondered how many ambitious generals, plotting
viziers, rebellious nobles and importunate <i>harim</i> favorites
had gone whirling through that black hole to come into the light
of day again only floating as carrion on the bosom of the Nile.
It was evident that the well had been sunk into an underground
flow of water that rushed into the river, perhaps miles away.</p>

<p>Clinging there by his fingernails in the dank rushing
blackness, Giles Hobson was so frozen with horror that it did not
even occur to him to call on the various saints he ordinarily
blasphemed. He merely hung on to the irregularly round, slippery
object his hands had found, frantic with fear of being torn away
and whirled down that black slimy tunnel, feeling his arms and
fingers growing numb with the strain, and slipping gradually but
steadily from their hold.</p>

<p>His last ounce of breath went from him in a wild cry of
despair, and&mdash;miracle of miracles&mdash;it was answered.
Light flooded the shaft, a light dim and gray, yet in such
contrast with the former blackness that it momentarily dazzled
him. Someone was shouting, but the words were unintelligible
amidst the rush of the black waters. He tried to shout back, but
he could only gurgle. Then, mad with fear lest the trap should
shut again, he achieved an inhuman screech that almost burst his
throat.</p>

<p>Shaking the water from his eyes and craning his head backward,
he saw a human head and shoulders blocked in the open trap far
above him. A rope was dangling down toward him. It swayed before
his eyes, but he dared not let go long enough to seize it. In
desperation, he mouthed for it, gripped it with his teeth, then
let go and snatched, even as he was sucked into the black hole.
His numbed fingers slipped along the rope. Tears of fear and
helplessness rolled down his face. But his jaws were locked
desperately on the strands, and his corded neck muscles resisted
the terrific strain.</p>

<p>Whoever was on the other end of the rope was hauling like a
team of oxen. Giles felt himself ripped bodily from the clutch of
the torrent. As his feet swung clear, he saw, in the dim light,
that to which he had been clinging: a human skull, wedged somehow
in a crevice of the slimy rock.</p>

<p>He was drawn rapidly up, revolving like a pendant. His numbed
hands clawed stiffly at the rope, his teeth seemed to be tearing
from their sockets. His jaw muscles were knots of agony, his neck
felt as if it were being racked.</p>

<p>Just as human endurance reached its limit, he saw the lip of
the trap slip past him, and he was dumped on the floor at its
brink.</p>

<p>He groveled in agony, unable to unlock his jaws from about the
hemp. Someone was massaging the cramped muscles with skilful
fingers, and at last they relaxed with a stream of blood from the
tortured gums. A goblet of wine was pressed to his lips and he
gulped it loudly, the liquid slopping over and spilling on his
slime-smeared mail. Someone was tugging at it, as if fearing lest
he injure himself by guzzling, but he clung on with both hands
until the beaker was empty. Then only he released it, and with a
loud gasping sigh of relief, looked up into the face of Shawar.
Behind the vizier were several giant Sudani, of the same type as
those who had been responsible for Giles' predicament.</p>

<p>"We missed you from the audience hall," said Shawar. "Sir Hugh
roared treachery, until a eunuch said he saw you follow a woman
slave off down a corridor. Then the lord Hugh laughed and said
you were up to your old tricks, and rode away with the lord
Geoffrey. But I knew the peril you ran in dallying with a woman
in the Caliph's palace; so I searched for you, and a slave told
me he had heard a frightful yell in this chamber. I came, and
entered just as a black was replacing the carpet above the trap.
He sought to flee, and died without speaking." The vizier
indicated a sprawling form that lay near, head lolling on
half-severed neck. "How came you in this state?"</p>

<p>"A woman lured me here," answered Giles, "and set blackamoors
upon me, threatening me with the well unless I revealed Amalric's
plans."</p>

<p>"What did you tell her?" The vizier's eyes burned so intently
on Giles that the fat man shuddered slightly and hitched himself
further away from the yet open trap.</p>

<p>"I told them nothing! Who am I to know the king's plans,
anyway? Then they dumped me into that cursed hole, though I
fought like a lion and maimed a score of the rogues. Had I but
had my trusty sword&mdash;"</p>

<p>At a nod from Shawar the trap was closed, the rug drawn over
it. Giles breathed a sigh of relief. Slaves dragged the corpse
away.</p>

<p>The vizier touched Giles' arm and led the way through a
corridor concealed by the hangings.</p>

<p>"I will send an escort with you to the Frankish camp. There
are spies of Shirkuh in this palace, and others who love him not,
yet hate me. Describe me this woman&mdash;the eunuch saw only her
hand."</p>

<p>Giles groped for adjectives, then shook his head.</p>

<p>"Her hair was black, her eyes moonfire, her body
alabaster."</p>

<p>"A description that would fit a thousand women of the Caliph,"
said the vizier. "No matter; get you gone, for the night wanes
and Allah only knows what morn will bring."</p>

<p><br>
THE night was indeed late as Giles Hobson rode into the
Frankish camp surrounded by Turkish <i>memluks</i> with drawn
sabres. But a light burned in Amalric's pavilion, which the wary
monarch preferred to the palace offered him by Shawar; and
thither Giles went, confident of admittance as a teller of lusty
tales who had won the king's friendship.</p>

<p>Amalric and his barons were bent above a map as the fat man
entered, and they were too engrossed to notice his entry, or his
bedraggled appearance.</p>

<p>"Shawar will furnish us men and boats," the king was saying;
"they will fashion the bridge, and we will make the attempt by
night&mdash;"</p>

<p>An explosive grunt escaped Giles' lips, as if he had been hit
in the belly.</p>

<p>"What, Sir Giles the Fat!" exclaimed Amalric, looking up; "are
you but now returned from your adventuring in Cairo? You are
fortunate still to have head on your shoulders. Eh&mdash;what
ails you, that you sweat and grow pale? Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"I have taken an emetic," mumbled Giles over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Beyond the light of the pavilion he broke into a stumbling
run. A tethered horse started and snorted at him. He caught the
rein, grasped the saddle peak; then, with one foot in the
stirrup, he halted. Awhile he meditated; then at last, wiping
cold sweat beads from his face, he returned with slow and
dragging steps to the king's tent.</p>

<p>He entered unceremoniously and spoke forthwith: "Lord, is it
your plan to throw a bridge of boats across the Nile?"</p>

<p>"Aye, so it is," declared Amalric.</p>

<p>Giles uttered a loud groan and sank down on a bench, his head
in his hands. "I am too young to die!" he lamented. "Yet I must
speak, though my reward be a sword in the belly. This night
Shirkuh's spies trapped me into speaking like a fool. I told them
the first lie that came into my head&mdash;and Saint Withold
defend me, I spoke the truth unwittingly. I told them you meant
to build a bridge of boats!"</p>

<p>A shocked silence reigned. Geoffrey Fulcher dashed down his
cup in a spasm of anger. "Death to the fat fool!" he swore,
rising.</p>

<p>"Nay!" Amalric smiled suddenly. He stroked his golden beard.
"Our foe will be expecting the bridge, now. Good enough. Hark
ye!"</p>

<p>And as he spoke, grim smiles grew on the lips of the barons,
and Giles Hobson began to grin and thrust out his belly, as if
his fault had been virtue, craftily devised.</p>

<p><br>
ALL night the Saracen host had stood at arms; on the opposite
bank fires blazed, reflected from the rounded walls and burnished
roofs of el Fustat. Trumpets mingled with the clang of steel. The
Emir Shirkuh, riding up and down the bank along which his mailed
hawks were ranged, glanced toward the eastern sky, just tinged
with dawn. A wind blew out of the desert.</p>

<p>There had been fighting along the river the day before, and
all through the night drums had rumbled and trumpets blared their
threat. All day Egyptians and naked Sudani had toiled to span the
dusky flood with boats chained together, end to end. Thrice they
had pushed toward the western bank, under the cover of their
archers in the barges, only to falter and shrink back before the
clouds of Turkish arrows. Once the end of the boat bridge had
almost touched the shore, and the helmeted riders had spurred
their horses into the water to slash at the shaven heads of the
workers. Skirkuh had expected an onslaught of the knights across
the frail span, but it had not come. The men in the boats had
again fallen back, leaving their dead floating in the muddily
churning wash.</p>

<p>Shirkuh decided that the Franks were lurking behind walls,
saving themselves for a supreme effort, when their allies should
have completed the bridge. The opposite bank was clustered with
swarms of naked figures, and the Kurd expected to see them begin
the futile task once more.</p>

<p>As dawn whitened the desert, there came a rider who rode like
the wind, sword in hand, turban unbound, blood dripping from his
beard.</p>

<p>"Woe to Islam!" he cried. "The Franks have crossed the
river!"</p>

<p>Panic swept the Moslem camp; men jerked their steeds from the
river bank, staring wildly northward. Only Shirkuh's bull-like
voice kept them from flinging away their swords and bolting.</p>

<p>The Emir's profanity was frightful. He had been fooled and
tricked. While the Egyptians held his attention with their
useless labor, Amalric and the iron men had marched northward,
crossed the prongs of the Delta in ships, and were now hastening
vengefully southward. The Emir's spies had had neither time nor
opportunity to reach him. Shawar had seen to that.</p>

<p>The Mountain Lion dared not await attack in this unsheltered
spot. Before the sun was well up, the Turkish host was on the
march; behind them the rising light shone on spear-points that
gleamed in a rising cloud of dust.</p>

<p>This dust irked Giles Hobson, riding behind Amalric and his
councilors. The fat Englishman was thirsty; dust settled greyly
on his mail; gnats bit him, sweat got into his eyes, and the sun,
as it rose, beat mercilessly on his basinet; so he hung it on his
saddle peak and pushed back his linked coif, daring sunstroke. On
either side of him leather creaked and worn mail clinked. Giles
thought of the ale-pots of England, and cursed the man whose hate
had driven him around the world.</p>

<p>And so they hunted the Mountain Lion up the valley of the
Nile, until they came to el Baban, The Gates, and found the
Saracen host drawn up for battle in the gut of the low sandy
hills.</p>

<p>Word came back along the ranks, putting new fervor into the
knights. The clatter of leather and steel seemed imbued with new
meaning. Giles put on his helmet and rising in his stirrups,
looked over the iron-clad shoulders in front of him.</p>

<p>To the left were the irrigated fields on the edge of which the
host was riding. To the right was the desert. Ahead of them the
terrain was broken by the hills. On these hills and in the
shallow valleys between, bristled the banners of the Turks, and
their <i>nakirs</i> blared. A mass of the host was drawn up in
the plain between the Franks and the hills.</p>

<p>The Christians had halted: three hundred and seventy-five
knights, plus half a dozen more who had ridden all the way from
Acre and reached the host only an hour before, with their
retainers. Behind them, moving with the baggage, their allies
halted in straggling lines: a thousand Turcoples, and some five
thousand Egyptians, whose gaudy garments outshone their
courage.</p>

<p>"Let us ride forward and smite those on the plain," urged one
of the foreign knights, newly come to the East.</p>

<p>Amalric scanned the closely massed ranks and shook his head.
He glanced at the banners that floated among the spears on the
slopes on either flank where the kettledrums clamored.</p>

<p>"That is the banner of Saladin in the center," he said.
"Shirkuh's house troops are on yonder hill. If the center
expected to stand, the Emir would be there. No, messers, I think
it is their wish to lure us into a charge. We will wait their
attack, under cover of the Turcoples' bows. Let them come to us;
they are in a hostile land, and must push the war."</p>

<p>The rank and file had not heard his words. He lifted his hand,
and thinking it preceded an order to charge, the forest of lances
quivered and sank in rest. Amalric, realizing the mistake, rose
in his stirrups to shout his command to fall back, but before he
could speak, Giles' horse, restive, shouldered that of the knight
next to him. This knight, one of those who had joined the host
less than an hour before, turned irritably; Giles looked into a
lean beaked face, seamed by a livid scar.</p>

<p>"Ha!" Instinctively the ogre caught at his sword.</p>

<p>Giles' action was also instinctive. Everything else was swept
out of his mind at the sight of that dread visage which had
haunted his dreams for more than a year. With a yelp he sank his
spurs into his horse's belly. The beast neighed shrilly and
leaped, blundering against Amalric's warhorse. That high-strung
beast reared and plunged, got the bit between its teeth, broke
from the ranks and thundered out across the plain.</p>

<p>Bewildered, seeing their king apparently charging the Saracen
host single-handed, the men of the Cross gave tongue and followed
him. The plain shook as the great horses stampeded across it, and
the spears of the iron-clad riders crashed splinteringly against
the shields of their enemies.</p>

<p>The movement was so sudden it almost swept the Moslems off
their feet. They had not expected a charge so instantly to follow
the coming up of the Christians. But the allies of the knights
were struck by confusion. No orders had been given, no
arrangement made for battle. The whole host was disordered by
that premature onslaught. The Turcoples and Egyptians wavered
uncertainly, drawing up about the baggage wagons.</p>

<p>The whole first rank of the Saracen center went down, and over
their mangled bodies rode the knights of Jerusalem, swinging
their great swords. An instant the Turkish ranks held; then they
began to fall back in good order, marshaled by their commander, a
slender, dark, self-contained young officer, Salah ed din,
Shirkuh's nephew.</p>

<p>The Christians followed. Amalric, cursing his mischance, made
the best of a bad bargain, and so well he plied his trade that
the harried Turks cried out on Allah and turned their horses'
heads from him.</p>

<p>Back into the gut of the hills the Saracens retired, and
turning there, under cover of slope and cliff, darkened the air
with their shafts. The headlong force of the knights' charge was
broken in the uneven ground, but the iron men came on grimly,
bending their helmeted heads to the rain.</p>

<p>Then on the flanks, kettledrums roared into fresh clamor. The
riders of the right wing, led by Shirkuh, swept down the slopes
and struck the horde which clustered loosely about the baggage
train. That charge swept the unwarlike Egyptians off the field in
headlong flight. The left wing began to close in to take the
knights on the flank, driving before it the troops of the
Turcoples. Amalric, hearing the kettledrums behind and on either
side of him as well as in front, gave the order to fall back,
before they were completely hemmed in.</p>

<p>To Giles Hobson it seemed the end of the world. He was
deafened by the clang of swords and the shouts. He seemed
surrounded by an ocean of surging steel and billowing dust
clouds. He parried blindly and smote blindly, hardly knowing
whether his blade cut flesh or empty air. Out of the defiles
horsemen were moving, chanting exultantly. A cry of
<i>"Yala-l-Islam!"</i> rose above the thunder&mdash;Saladin's
war-cry, that was in later years to ring around the world. The
Saracen center was coming into the battle again.</p>

<p>Abruptly the press slackened, broke; the plain was filled with
flying figures. A strident ululation cut the din. The Turcoples'
shafts had stayed the Saracens' left wing just long enough to
allow the knights to retreat through the closing jaws of the
vise. But Amalric, retreating slowly, was cut off with a handful
of knights. The Turks swirled about him, screaming in exultation,
slashing and smiting with mad abandon. In the dust and confusion
the ranks of the iron men fell back, unaware of the fate of their
king.</p>

<p>Giles Hobson, riding through the field like a man in a daze,
came face to face with Guiscard de Chastillon.</p>

<p>"Dog!" croaked the knight. "We are doomed, but I'll send you
to Hell ahead of me!"</p>

<p>His sword went up, but Giles leaned from his saddle and caught
his arm. The fat man's eyes were bloodshot; he licked his
dust-stained lips. There was blood on his sword, and his helmet
was dinted.</p>

<p>"Your selfish hate and my cowardice has cost Amalric the field
this day," Giles croaked. "There he fights for his life; let us
redeem ourselves as best we may."</p>

<p>Some of the glare faded from de Chastillon's eyes; he twisted
about, stared at the plumed heads that surged and eddied about a
cluster of iron helmets; and he nodded his steel-clad head.</p>

<p>They rode together into the melee. Their swords hissed and
crackled on mail and bone. Amalric was down, pinned under his
dying horse. Around him whirled the eddy of battle, where his
knights were dying under a sea of hacking blades.</p>

<p>Giles fell rather than jumped from his saddle, gripped the
dazed king and dragged him clear. The fat Englishman's muscles
cracked under the strain, a groan escaped his lips. A Seljuk
leaned from the saddle, slashed at Amalric's unhelmeted head.
Giles bent his head, took the blow on his own crown; his knees
sagged and sparks flashed before his eyes. Guiscard de Chastillon
rose in his stirrups, swinging his sword with both hands. The
blade crunched through mail, gritted through bone. The Seljuk
dropped, shorn through the spine. Giles braced his legs, heaved
the king up, slung him over his saddle.</p>

<p>"Save the king!" Giles did not recognize that croak as his own
voice.</p>

<p>Geoffrey Fulcher loomed through the crush, dealing great
strokes. He seized the rein of Giles' steed; half a dozen
reeling, blood-dripping knights closed about the frantic horse
and its stunned burden. Nerved to desperation they hacked their
way clear. The Seljuks swirled in behind them to be met by
Guiscard de Chastillon's flailing blade.</p>

<p>The waves of wild horsemen and flying blades broke on him.
Saddles were emptied and blood spurted. Giles rose from the
red-splashed ground among the lashing hoofs. He ran in among the
horses, stabbing at bellies and thighs. A sword stroke knocked
off his helmet. His blade snapped under a Seljuk's ribs.</p>

<p>Guiscard's horse screamed awfully and sank to the earth. His
grim rider rose, spurting blood at every joint of his armor. Feet
braced wide on the blood-soaked earth, he wielded his great sword
until the steel wave washed over him and he was hidden from view
by waving plumes and rearing steeds.</p>

<p>Giles ran at a heron-feathered chief, gripped his leg with his
naked hands. Blows rained on his coif, bringing fire-shot
darkness, but he hung grimly on. He wrenched the Turk from his
saddle, fell with him, groping for his throat. Hoofs pounded
about him, a steed shouldered against him, knocking him rolling
in the dust. He clambered painfully to his feet, shaking the
blood and sweat from his eyes. Dead men and dead horses lay
heaped in a ghastly pile about him.</p>

<p>A familiar voice reached his dulled ears. He saw Shirkuh
sitting his white horse, gazing down at him. The Mountain Lion's
beard bristled in a grin.</p>

<p>"You have saved Amalric," said he, indicating a group of
riders in the distance, closing in with the retreating host; the
Saracens were not pressing the pursuit too closely. The iron men
were falling back in good order. They were defeated, not broken.
The Turks were content to allow them to retire unmolested.</p>

<p>"You are a hero, Giles ibn Malik," said Shirkuh.</p>

<p>Giles sank down on a dead horse and dropped his head in his
hands. The marrow of his legs seemed turned to water, and he was
shaken with a desire to weep.</p>

<p>"I am neither a hero nor the son of a king," said Giles. "Slay
me and be done with it."</p>

<p>"Who spoke of slaying?" demanded Shirkuh. "I have just won an
empire in this battle, and I would quaff a goblet in token of it.
Slay you? By Allah, I would not harm a hair of such a stout
fighter and noble toper. You shall come and drink with me in
celebration of a kingdom won when I ride into El Kahira in
triumph."</p>
