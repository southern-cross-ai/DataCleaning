<h2><a id="samarcand1" name="samarcand1">CHAPTER 1</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE ROAR of battle had died away; the sun hung
like a ball of crimson gold on the western hills. Across the
trampled field of battle no squadrons thundered, no war-cry
reverberated. Only the shrieks of the wounded and the moans of the
dying rose to the circling vultures whose black wings swept closer
and closer until they brushed the pallid faces in their flight.</p>

<p>On his rangy stallion, in a hillside thicket, Ak Boga the Tatar
watched, as he had watched since dawn, when the mailed hosts of the
Franks, with their forest of lances and flaming pennons, had moved
out on the plains of Nicopolis to meet the grim hordes of
Bayazid.</p>

<p>Ak Boga, watching their battle array, had chk-chk'd his teeth in
surprize and disapproval as he saw the glittering squadrons of
mounted knights draw out in front of the compact masses of stalwart
infantry, and lead the advance. They were the flower of
Europe&mdash;cavaliers of Austria, Germany, France and Italy; but
Ak Boga shook his head.</p>

<p>He had seen the knights charge with a thunderous roar that shook
the heavens, had seen them smite the outriders of Bayazid like a
withering blast and sweep up the long slope in the teeth of a
raking fire from the Turkish archers at the crest. He had seen them
cut down the archers like ripe corn, and launch their whole power
against the oncoming spahis, the Turkish light cavalry. And he had
seen the spahis buckle and break and scatter like spray before a
storm, the light-armed riders flinging aside their lances and
spurring like mad out of the melee. But Ak Boga had looked back,
where, far behind, the sturdy Hungarian pikemen toiled, seeking to
keep within supporting distance of the headlong cavaliers.</p>

<p>He had seen the Frankish horsemen sweep on, reckless of their
horses' strength as of their own lives, and cross the ridge. From
his vantage-point Ak Boga could see both sides of that ridge and he
knew that there lay the main power of the Turkish
army&mdash;sixty-five thousand strong&mdash;the janizaries, the
terrible Ottoman infantry, supported by the heavy cavalry, tall men
in strong armor, bearing spears and powerful bows.</p>

<p>And now the Franks realized, what Ak Boga had known, that the
real battle lay before them; and their horses were weary, their
lances broken, their throats choked with dust and thirst.</p>

<p>Ak Boga had seen them waver and look back for the Hungarian
infantry; but it was out of sight over the ridge, and in
desperation the knights hurled themselves on the massed enemy,
striving to break the ranks by sheer ferocity. That charge never
reached the grim lines. Instead a storm of arrows broke the
Christian front, and this time, on exhausted horses, there was no
riding against it. The whole first rank went down, horses and men
pincushioned, and in that red shambles their comrades behind them
stumbled and fell headlong. And then the janizaries charged with a
deep-toned roar of "Allah!" that was like the thunder of deep
surf.</p>

<p>All this Ak Boga had seen; had seen, too, the inglorious flight
of some of the knights, the ferocious resistance of others. On
foot, leaguered and outnumbered, they fought with sword and ax,
falling one by one, while the tide of battle flowed around them on
either side and the blood-drunken Turks fell upon the infantry
which had just toiled into sight over the ridge.</p>

<p>There, too, was disaster. Flying knights thundered through the
ranks of the Wallachians, and these broke and retired in ragged
disorder. The Hungarians and Bavarians received the brunt of the
Turkish onslaught, staggered and fell back stubbornly, contesting
every foot, but unable to check the victorious flood of Moslem
fury.</p>

<p>And now, as Ak Boga scanned the field, he no longer saw the
serried lines of the pikemen and ax-fighters. They had fought their
way back over the ridge and were in full, though ordered, retreat,
and the Turks had come back to loot the dead and mutilate the
dying. Such knights as had not fallen or broken away in flight, had
flung down the hopeless sword and surrendered. Among the trees on
the farther side of the vale, the main Turkish host was clustered,
and even Ak Boga shivered a trifle at the screams which rose where
Bayazid's swordsmen were butchering the captives. Nearer at hand
ran ghoulish figures, swift and furtive, pausing briefly over each
heap of corpses; here and there gaunt dervishes with foam on their
beards and madness in their eyes plied their knives on writhing
victims who screamed for death.</p>

<p>"Erlik!" muttered Ak Boga. "They boasted that they could hold up
the sky on their lances, were it to fall, and lo, the sky has
fallen and their host is meat for the ravens!"</p>

<p>He reined his horse away through the thicket; there might be
good plunder among the plumed and corseleted dead, but Ak Boga had
come hither on a mission which was yet to be completed. But even as
he emerged from the thicket, he saw a prize no Tatar could
forego&mdash;a tall Turkish steed with an ornate high-peaked
Turkish saddle came racing by. Ak Boga spurred quickly forward and
caught the flying, silver-worked rein. Then, leading the restive
charger, he trotted swiftly down the slope away from the
battlefield.</p>

<p>Suddenly he reined in among a clump of stunted trees. The
hurricane of strife, slaughter and pursuit had cast its spray on
this side of the ridge. Before him Ak Boga saw a tall, richly clad
knight grunting and cursing as he sought to hobble along using his
broken lance as a crutch. His helmet was gone, revealing a blond
head and a florid choleric face. Not far away lay a dead horse, an
arrow protruding from its ribs.</p>

<p>As Ak Boga watched, the big knight stumbled and fell with a
scorching oath. Then from the bushes came a man such as Ak Boga had
never seen before, even among the Franks. This man was taller than
Ak Boga, who was a big man, and his stride was like that of a gaunt
gray wolf. He was bareheaded, a tousled shock of tawny hair topping
a sinister scarred face, burnt dark by the sun, and his eyes were
cold as gray icy steel. The great sword he trailed was crimson to
the hilt, his rusty scale-mail shirt hacked and rent, the kilt
beneath it torn and slashed. His right arm was stained to the
elbow, and blood dripped sluggishly from a deep gash in his left
forearm.</p>

<p>"Devil take all!" growled the crippled knight in Norman French,
which Ak Boga understood; "this is the end of the world!"</p>

<p>"Only the end of a horde of fools," the tall Frank's voice was
hard and cold, like the rasp of a sword in its scabbard.</p>

<p>The lame man swore again. "Stand not there like a blockhead,
fool! Catch me a horse! My damnable steed caught a shaft in its
cursed hide, and though I spurred it until the blood spurted over
my heels, it fell at last, and I think, broke my ankle."</p>

<p>The tall one dropped his sword-point to the earth and stared at
the other somberly.</p>

<p>"You give commands as though you sat in your own fief of Saxony,
Lord Baron Frederik! But for you and divers other fools, we had
cracked Bayazid like a nut this day."</p>

<p>"Dog!" roared the baron, his intolerant face purpling; "this
insolence to me? I'll have you flayed alive!"</p>

<p>"Who but you cried down the Elector in council?" snarled the
other, his eyes glittering dangerously. "Who called Sigismund of
Hungary a fool because he urged that the lord allow him to lead the
assault with his infantry? And who but you had the ear of that
young fool High Constable of France, Philip of Artois, so that in
the end he led the charge that ruined us all, nor would wait on the
ridge for support from the Hungarians? And now you, who turned tail
quicker than any when you saw what your folly had done, you bid me
fetch you a horse!"</p>

<p>"Aye, and quickly, you Scottish dog!" screamed the baron,
convulsed with fury. "You shall answer for this&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll answer here," growled the Scotsman, his manner changing
murderously. "You have heaped insults on me since we first sighted
the Danube. If I'm to die, I'll settle one score first!"</p>

<p>"Traitor!" bellowed the baron, whitening, scrambling up on his
knee and reaching for his sword. But even as he did so, the
Scotsman struck, with an oath, and the baron's roar was cut short
in a ghastly gurgle as the great blade sheared through
shoulder-bone, ribs and spine, casting the mangled corpse limply
upon the blood-soaked earth.</p>

<p>"Well struck, warrior!" At the sound of the guttural voice the
slayer wheeled like a great wolf, wrenching free the sword. For a
tense moment the two eyed each other, the swordsman standing above
his victim, a brooding somber figure terrible with potentialities
of blood and slaughter, the Tatar sitting his high-peaked saddle
like a carven image.</p>

<p>"I am no Turk," said Ak Boga. "You have no quarrel with me. See,
my scimitar is in its sheath. I have need of a man like
you&mdash;strong as a bear, swift as a wolf, cruel as a falcon. I
can bring you to much you desire."</p>

<p>"I desire only vengeance on the head of Bayazid," rumbled the
Scotsman.</p>

<p>The dark eyes of the Tatar glittered.</p>

<p>"Then come with me. For my lord is the sworn enemy of the
Turk."</p>

<p>"Who is your lord?" asked the Scotsman suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Men call him the Lame," answered Ak Boga. "Timour, the Servant
of God, by the favor of Allah, Amir of Tatary."</p>

<p>The Scotsman turned his head in the direction of the distant
shrieks which told that the massacre was still continuing, and
stood for an instant like a great bronze statue. Then he sheathed
his sword with a savage rasp of steel.</p>

<p>"I will go," he said briefly.</p>

<p>The Tatar grinned with pleasure, and leaning forward, gave into
his hands the reins of the Turkish horse. The Frank swung into the
saddle and glanced inquiringly at Ak Boga. The Tatar motioned with
his helmeted head and reined away down the slope. They touched in
the spurs and cantered swiftly away into the gathering twilight,
while behind them the shrieks of dire agony still rose to the
shivering stars which peered palely out, as if frightened by man's
slaughter of man.</p>

<h2><a id="samarcand2" name="samarcand2">CHAPTER 2</a>
</h2>

<p class="verse">"Had we twa been upon the green.<br>
And never an eye to see.<br>
I wad hae had you, flesh and fell;<br>
But your sword shall gae wi' me."<br>
&mdash;<i>The Ballad of Otterbourne</i>.</p>
<br>

<p class="first">AGAIN the sun was sinking, this time over a
desert, etching the spires and minarets of a blue city. Ak Boga
drew rein on the crest of a rise and sat motionless for a moment,
sighing deeply as he drank in the familiar sight, whose wonder
never faded.</p>

<p>"Samarcand," said Ak Boga.</p>

<p>"We have ridden far," answered his companion. Ak Boga smiled.
The Tatar's garments were dusty, his mail tarnished, his face
somewhat drawn, though his eyes still twinkled. The Scotsman's
strongly chiseled features had not altered.</p>

<p>"You are of steel, bogatyr," said Ak Boga. "The road we have
traveled would have wearied a courier of Genghis Khan. And by
Erlik, I, who was bred in the saddle, am the wearier of the
twain!"</p>

<p>The Scotsman gazed unspeaking at the distant spires, remembering
the days and nights of apparently endless riding, when he had slept
swaying in the saddle, and all the sounds of the universe had died
down to the thunder of hoofs. He had followed Ak Boga
unquestioning: through hostile hills where they avoided trails and
cut through the blind wilderness, over mountains where the chill
winds cut like a sword-edge, into stretches of steppes and
desert.</p>

<p>He had not questioned when Ak Boga's relaxing vigilance told him
that they were out of hostile country, and when the Tatar began to
stop at wayside posts where tall dark men in iron helmets brought
fresh steeds. Even then there was no slacking of the headlong pace:
a swift guzzling of wine and snatching of food; occasionally a
brief interlude of sleep, on a heap of hides and cloaks; then again
the drum of racing hoofs. The Frank knew that Ak Boga was bearing
the news of the battle to his mysterious lord, and he wondered at
the distance they had covered between the first post where saddled
steeds awaited them and the blue spires that marked their journey's
end. Wide-flung indeed were the boundaries of the lord called
Timour the Lame.</p>

<p>They had covered that vast expanse of country in a time the
Frank would have sworn impossible. He felt now the grinding wear of
that terrible ride, but he gave no outward sign. The city shimmered
to his gaze, mingling with the blue of the distance, so that it
seemed part of the horizon, a city of illusion and enchantment.
Blue: the Tatars lived in a wide magnificent land, lavish with
color schemes, and the prevailing motif was blue. In the spires and
domes of Samarcand were mirrored the hues of the skies, the far
mountains and the dreaming lakes.</p>

<p>"You have seen lands and seas no Frank has beheld," said Ak
Boga, "and rivers and towns and caravan trails. Now you shall gaze
upon the glory of Samarcand, which the lord Timour found a town of
dried brick and has made a metropolis of blue stone and ivory and
marble and silver filigree."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
The two descended into the plain and threaded their way between
converging lines of camel-caravans and mule-trains whose robed
drivers shouted incessantly, all bound for the Turquoise Gates,
laden with spices, silks, jewels, and slaves, the goods and gauds
of India and Cathay, of Persia and Arabia and Egypt.</p>

<p>"All the East rides the road to Samarcand," said Ak Boga.</p>

<p>They passed through the wide gilt-inlaid gates where the tall
spearmen shouted boisterous greetings to Ak Boga, who yelled back,
rolling in his saddle and smiting his mailed thigh with the joy of
homecoming.</p>

<p>They rode through the wide winding streets, past palace and
market and mosque, and bazaars thronged with the people of a
hundred tribes and races, bartering, disputing, shouting.</p>

<p>The Scotsman saw hawk-faced Arabs, lean apprehensive Syrians,
fat fawning Jews, turbaned Indians, languid Persians, ragged
swaggering but suspicious Afghans, and more unfamiliar forms;
figures from the mysterious reaches of the north, and the far east;
stocky Mongols with broad inscrutable faces and the rolling gait of
an existence spent in the saddle; slant-eyed Cathayans in robes of
watered silk; tall quarrelsome Vigurs; round-faced Kipchaks;
narrow-eyed Kirghiz; a score of races whose existence the West did
not guess. All the Orient flowed in a broad river through the gates
of Samarcand.</p>

<p>The Frank's wonder grew; the cities of the West were hovels
compared to this. Past academies, libraries and pleasure-pavilions
they rode, and Ak Boga turned into a wide gateway, guarded by
silver lions. There they gave their steeds into the hands of
silk-sashed grooms, and walked along a winding avenue paved with
marble and lined with slim green trees.</p>

<p>The Scotsman, looking between the slender trunks, saw shimmering
expanses of roses, cherry trees and waving exotic blossoms unknown
to him, where fountains jetted arches of silver spray. So they came
to the palace, gleaming blue and gold in the sunlight, passed
between tall marble columns and entered the chambers with their
gilt-worked arched doorways, and walls decorated with delicate
paintings of Persian and Cathayan artists, and the gold tissue and
silver work of Indian artistry.</p>

<p>Ak Boga did not halt in the great reception room with its
slender carven columns and frieze-work of gold and turquoise, but
continued until he came to the fretted gold-adorned arch of a door
which opened into a small blue-domed chamber that looked out
through gold-barred windows into a series of broad, shaded,
marble-paved galleries. There silk-robed courtiers took their
weapons, and grasping their arms, led them between files of giant
black mutes in silken loincloths, who held two-handed scimitars
upon their shoulders, and into the chamber, where the courtiers
released their arms and fell back, salaaming deeply. Ak Boga knelt
before the figure on the silken divan, but the Scotsman stood
grimly erect, nor was obeisance required of him. Some of the
simplicity of Genghis Khan's court still lingered in the courts of
these descendants of the nomads.</p>

<p>The Scotsman looked closely at the man on the divan; this, then,
was the mysterious Tamerlane, who was already becoming a mythical
figure in Western lore. He saw a man as tall as himself, gaunt but
heavy-boned, with a wide sweep of shoulders and the Tatar's
characteristic depth of chest. His face was not as dark as Ak
Boga's, nor did his black magnetic eyes slant; and he did not sit
cross-legged as a Mongol sits. There was power in every line of his
figure, in his clean-cut features, in the crisp black hair and
beard, untouched with gray despite his sixty-one years. There was
something of the Turk in his appearance, thought the Scotsman, but
the dominant note was the lean wolfish hardness that suggested the
nomad. He was closer to the basic Turanian rootstock than was the
Turk; nearer to the wolfish, wandering Mongols who were his
ancestors.</p>

<p>"Speak, Ak Boga," said the Amir in a deep powerful voice.
"Ravens have flown westward, but there has come no word."</p>

<p>"We rode before the word, my lord," answered the warrior. "The
news is at our heels, traveling swift on the caravan roads. Soon
the couriers, and after them the traders and the merchants, will
bring to you the news that a great battle has been fought in the
west; that Bayazid has broken the hosts of the Christians, and the
wolves howl over the corpses of the kings of Frankistan."</p>

<p>"And who stands beside you?" asked Timour, resting his chin on
his hand and fixing his deep somber eyes on the Scotsman.</p>

<p>"A chief of the Franks who escaped the slaughter," answered Ak
Boga. "Single-handed he cut his way through the melee, and in his
flight paused to slay a Frankish lord who had put shame upon him
aforetime. He has no fear and his thews are steel. By Allah, we
passed through the land outracing the wind to bring thee news of
the war, and this Frank is less weary than I, who learned to ride
ere I learned to walk."</p>

<p>"Why do you bring him to me?"</p>

<p>"It was my thought that he would make a mighty warrior for thee,
my lord."</p>

<p>"In all the world," mused Timour, "there are scarce half a dozen
men whose judgment I trust. Thou art one of those," he added
briefly, and Ak Boga, who had flushed darkly in embarrassment,
grinned delightedly.</p>

<p>"Can he understand me?" asked Timour.</p>

<p>"He speaks Turki, my lord."</p>

<p>"How are you named, oh Frank?" queried the Amir. "And what is
your rank?"</p>

<p>"I am called Donald MacDeesa," answered the Scotsman. "I come
from the country of Scotland, beyond Frankistan. I have no rank,
either in my own land or in the army I followed. I live by my wits
and the edge of my claymore."</p>

<p>"Why do you ride to me?"</p>

<p>"Ak Boga told me it was the road to vengeance."</p>

<p>"Against whom?"</p>

<p>"Bayazid the Sultan of the Turks, whom men name the
Thunderer."</p>

<p>Timour dropped his head on his mighty breast for a space and in
the silence MacDeesa heard the silvery tinkle of a fountain in an
outer court and the musical voice of a Persian poet singing to a
lute.</p>

<p>Then the great Tatar lifted his lion's head and spoke
quietly.</p>

<p>"Sit ye with Ak Boga upon this divan close at my hand," said he.
"I will instruct you how to trap a gray wolf."</p>

<p>As Donald did so, he unconsciously lifted a hand to his face, as
if he felt the sting of a blow eleven years old. Irrelevantly his
mind reverted to another king and another, ruder court, and in the
swift instant that elapsed as he took his seat close to the Amir,
glanced fleetingly along the bitter trail of his life.</p>

<p>Young Lord Douglas, most powerful of all the Scottish barons,
was headstrong and impetuous, and like most Norman lords, choleric
when he fancied himself crossed. But he should not have struck the
lean young Highlander who had come down into the border country
seeking fame and plunder in the train of the lords of the
marches.</p>

<p>Douglas was accustomed to using both riding-whip and fists
freely on his pages and esquires, and promptly forgetting both the
blow and the cause; and they, being also Normans and accustomed to
the tempers of their lords, likewise forgot. But Donald MacDeesa
was no Norman; he was a Gael, and Gaelic ideas of honor and insult
differ from Norman ideas as the wild uplands of the North differ
from the fertile plains of the Lowlands. The chief of Donald's clan
could not have struck him with impunity, and for a Southron to so
venture&mdash;hate entered the young Highlander's blood like a
black river and filled his dreams with crimson nightmares.</p>

<p>Douglas forgot the blow too quickly to regret it. But Donald's
was the vengeful heart of those wild folk who keep the fires of
feud flaming for centuries and carry grudges to the grave. Donald
was as fully Celtic as his savage Dalriadian ancestors who carved
out the kingdom of Alba with their swords.</p>

<p>But he hid his hate and bided his time, and it came in a
hurricane of border war. Robert Bruce lay in his tomb, and his
heart, stilled forever, lay somewhere in Spain beneath the body of
Black Douglas, who had failed in the pilgrimage which was to place
the heart of his king before the Holy Sepulcher. The great king's
grandson, Robert II, had little love for storm and stress; he
desired peace with England and he feared the great family of
Douglas.</p>

<p>But despite his protests, war spread flaming wings along the
border and the Scottish lords rode joyfully on the foray. But
before the Douglas marched, a quiet and subtle man came to Donald
MacDeesa's tent and spoke briefly and to the point.</p>

<p>"Knowing that the aforesaid lord hath put despite upon thee, I
whispered thy name softly to him that sendeth me, and sooth, it is
well known that this same bloody lord doth continually embroil the
kingdoms and stir up wrath and woe between the sovereigns&mdash;"
he said in part, and he plainly spoke the word, "Protection."</p>

<p>Donald made no answer and the quiet person smiled and left the
young Highlander sitting with his chin on his fist, staring grimly
at the floor of his tent.</p>

<p>Thereafter Lord Douglas marched right gleefully with his
retainers into the border country and "burned the dales of Tyne,
and part of Bambroughshire, and three good towers on Reidswire
fells, he left them all on fire," and spread wrath and woe
generally among the border English, so that King Richard sent notes
of bitter reproach to King Robert, who bit his nails with rage, but
waited patiently for news he expected to hear.</p>

<p>Then after an indecisive skirmish at Newcastle, Douglas encamped
in a place called Otterbourne, and there Lord Percy, hot with
wrath, came suddenly upon him in the night, and in the confused
melee which ensued, called by the Scottish the Battle of
Otterbourne and by the English Chevy Chase, Lord Douglas fell. The
English swore he was slain by Lord Percy, who neither confirmed nor
denied it, not knowing himself what men he had slain in the
confusion and darkness.</p>

<p>But a wounded man babbled of a Highland plaid, before he died,
and an ax wielded by no English hand. Men came to Donald and
questioned him hardly, but he snarled at them like a wolf, and the
king, after piously burning many candles for Douglas' soul in
public, and thanking God for the baron's demise in the privacy of
his chamber, announced that "we have heard of this persecution of a
loyal subject and it being plain in our mind that this youth is
innocent as ourselves in this matter we hereby warn all men against
further hounding of him at pain of death."</p>

<p>So the king's protection saved Donald's life, but men muttered
in their teeth and ostracized him. Sullen and embittered, he
withdrew to himself and brooded in a hut alone, till one night
there came news of the king's sudden abdication and retirement into
a monastery. The stress of a monarch's life in those stormy times
was too much for the monkish sovereign. Close on the heels of the
news came men with drawn daggers to Donald's hut, but they found
the cage empty. The hawk had flown, and though they followed his
trail with reddened spurs, they found only a steed that had fallen
dead at the seashore, and saw only a white sail dwindling in the
growing dawn.</p>

<p>Donald went to the Continent because, with the Lowlands barred
to him, there was nowhere else to go; in the Highlands he had too
many blood-feuds; and across the border the English had already
made a noose for him. That was in 1389. Seven years of fighting and
intriguing in European wars and plots. And when Constantinople
cried out before the irresistible onslaught of Bayazid, and men
pawned their lands to launch a new Crusade, the Highland swordsman
had joined the tide that swept eastward to its doom.</p>

<p>Seven years&mdash;and a far cry from the border marches to the
blue-domed palaces of fabulous Samarcand, reclining on a silken
divan as he listened to the measured words which flowed in a
tranquil monotone from the lips of the lord of Tatary.</p>

<br>

<h2><a id="samarcand3" name="samarcand3">CHAPTER 3</a>

<p class="verse">"If thou'rt the lord of this castle,<br>
Sae well it pleases me:<br>
For, ere I cross the border fells.<br>
The tane of us shall dee."<br>
&mdash;<i>Battle of Otterbourne.</i></p>
<br>

<p class="first">TIME flowed on as it does whether men live or die.
The bodies rotted on the plains of Nicopolis, and Bayazid, drunk
with power, trampled the scepters of the world. The Greeks, the
Serbs and the Hungarians he ground beneath his iron legions, and
into his spreading empire he molded the captive races. He laved his
limbs in wild debauchery, the frenzy of which astounded even his
tough vassals.</p>

<p>The women of the world flowed whimpering between his iron
fingers and he hammered the golden crowns of kings to shoe his
war-steed. Constantinople reeled beneath his strokes, and Europe
licked her wounds like a crippled wolf, held at bay on the
defensive.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the misty mazes of the East moved his arch-foe
Timour, and to him Bayazid sent missives of threat and mockery. No
response was forthcoming, but word came along the caravans of a
mighty marching and a great war in the south; of the plumed helmets
of India scattered and flying before the Tatar spears. Little heed
gave Bayazid; India was little more real to him than it was to the
Pope of Rome. His eyes were turned westward toward the Caphar
cities. "I will harrow Frankistan with steel and flame," he said.
"Their sultans shall draw my chariots and the bats lair in the
palaces of the infidels."</p>

<p>Then in the early spring of 1402 there came to him, in an inner
court of his pleasure-palace at Brusa, where he lolled guzzling the
forbidden wine and watching the antics of naked dancing girls,
certain of his emirs, bringing a tall Frank whose grim scarred
visage was darkened by the suns of far deserts.</p>

<p>"This Caphar dog rode into the camp of the janizaries as a
madman rides, on a foam-covered steed," said they, "saying he
sought Bayazid. Shall we flay him before thee, or tear him between
wild horses?"</p>

<p>"Dog," said the Sultan, drinking deeply and setting down the
goblet with a satisfied sigh, "you have found Bayazid. Speak, ere I
set you howling on a stake."</p>

<p>"Is this fit welcome for one who has ridden far to serve you?"
retorted the Frank in a harsh unshaken voice. "I am Donald MacDeesa
and among your janizaries there is no man who can stand up against
me in sword-play, and among your barrel-bellied wrestlers there is
no man whose back I can not break."</p>

<p>The Sultan tugged his black beard and grinned.</p>

<p>"Would thou wert not an infidel," said he, "for I love a man
with a bold tongue. Speak on, oh Rustum! What other accomplishments
are thine, mirror of modesty?"</p>

<p>The Highlander grinned like a wolf.</p>

<p>"I can break the back of a Tatar and roll the head of a Khan in
the dust."</p>

<p>Bayazid stiffened, subtly changing, his giant frame charged with
dynamic power and menace; for behind all his roistering and
bellowing conceit was the keenest brain west of the Oxus.</p>

<p>"What folly is this?" he rumbled. "What means this riddle?"</p>

<p>"I speak no riddle," snapped the Gael. "I have no more love for
you than you for me. But more I hate Timour-il-leng who has cast
dung in my face."</p>

<p>"You come to me from that half-pagan dog?"</p>

<p>"Aye. I was his man. I rode beside him and cut down his foes. I
climbed city walls in the teeth of the arrows and broke the ranks
of mailed spearmen. And when the honors and gifts were distributed
among the emirs, what was given me? The gall of mockery and the
wormwood of insult. 'Ask thy dog-sultans of Frankistan for gifts,
Caphar,' said Timour&mdash;may the worms devour him&mdash;and the
emirs roared with laughter. As God is my witness, I will wipe out
that laughter in the crash of falling walls and the roar of
flames!"</p>

<p>Donald's menacing voice reverberated through the chamber and his
eyes were cold and cruel. Bayazid pulled his beard for a space and
said, "And you come to me for vengeance? Shall I war against the
Lame One because of the spite of a wandering Caphar vagabond?"</p>

<p>"You <i>will</i> war against him, or he against you," answered
MacDeesa. "When Timour wrote asking that you lend no aid to his
foes, Kara Yussef the Turkoman, and Ahmed, Sultan of Bagdad, you
answered him with words not to be borne, and sent horsemen to
stiffen their ranks against him. Now the Turkomans are broken,
Bagdad has been looted and Damascus lies in smoking ruins. Timour
has broken your allies and he will not forget the despite you put
upon him."</p>

<p>"Close have you been to the Lame One to know all this," muttered
Bayazid, his glittering eyes narrowing with suspicion. "Why should
I trust a Frank? By Allah, I deal with them by the sword! As I
dealt with those fools at Nicopolis!"</p>

<p>A fierce uncontrollable flame leaped up for a fleeting instant
in the Highlander's eyes, but the dark face showed no sign of
emotion.</p>

<p>"Know this, Turk," he answered with an oath, "I can show you how
to break Timour's back."</p>

<p>"Dog!" roared the Sultan, his gray eyes blazing, "think you I
need the aid of a nameless rogue to conquer the Tatar?"</p>

<p>Donald laughed in his face, a hard mirthless laugh that was not
pleasant.</p>

<p>"Timour will crack you like a walnut," said he deliberately.
"Have you seen the Tatars in war array? Have you seen their arrows
darkening the sky as they loosed, a hundred thousand as one? Have
you seen their horsemen flying before the wind as they charged home
and the desert shook beneath their hoofs? Have you seen the array
of their elephants, with towers on their backs, whence archers send
shafts in black clouds and the fire that burns flesh and leather
alike pours forth?"</p>

<p>"All this I have heard," answered the Sultan, not particularly
impressed.</p>

<p>"But you have not seen," returned the Highlander; he drew back
his tunic sleeve and displayed a scar on his iron-thewed arm. "An
Indian tulwar kissed me there, before Delhi. I rode with the emirs
when the whole world seemed to shake with the thunder of combat. I
saw Timour trick the Sultan of Hindustan and draw him from the
lofty walls as a serpent is drawn from its lair. By God, the plumed
Rajputs fell like ripened grain before us!</p>

<p>"Of Delhi Timour left a pile of deserted ruins, and without the
broken walls he built a pyramid of a hundred thousand skulls. You
would say I lied were I to tell you how many days the Khyber Pass
was thronged with the glittering hosts of warriors and captives
returning along the road to Samarcand. The mountains shook with
their tread and the wild Afghans came down in hordes to place their
heads beneath Timour's heel&mdash;as he will grind <i>thy</i> head
underfoot, Bayazid!"</p>

<p>"This to me, dog?" yelled the Sultan. "I will fry you in
oil!"</p>

<p>"Aye, prove your power over Timour by slaying the dog he
mocked," answered MacDeesa bitterly. "You kings are all alike in
fear and folly."</p>

<p>Bayazid gaped at him. "By Allah!" he said, "thou'rt mad to speak
thus to the Thunderer. Bide in my court until I learn whether thou
be rogue, fool, or madman. If spy, not in a day or three days will
I slay thee, but for a full week shalt thou howl for death."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
So Donald abode in the court of the Thunderer, under suspicion, and
soon there came a brief but peremptory note from Timour, asking
that "the thief of a Christian who hath taken refuge in the Ottoman
court" be given up for just punishment. Whereat Bayazid, scenting
an opportunity to further insult his rival, twisted his black beard
gleefully between his fingers and grinned like a hyena as he
dictated a reply:</p>

<p class="letter">"Know, thou crippled dog, that the Osmanli are
not in the habit of conceding to the insolent demands of pagan
foes. Be at ease while thou mayest, oh lame dog, for soon I will
take thy kingdom for an offal-heap and thy favorite wives for my
concubines."</p>

<p>No further missives came from Timour. Bayazid drew Donald into
wild revels, plied him with strong drink and even as he roared and
roistered, he keenly watched the Highlander. But even his
suspicions grew blunter when at his drunkest Donald spoke no word
that might hint he was other than he seemed. He breathed the name
of Timour only with curses. Bayazid discounted the value of his aid
against the Tatars, but contemplated putting him to use, as Ottoman
sultans always employed foreigners for confidants and guardsmen,
knowing their own race too well. Under close, subtle scrutiny the
Gael indifferently moved, drinking all but the Sultan onto the
floor in the wild drinking-bouts and bearing himself with a
reckless valor that earned the respect of the hard-bitten Turks, in
forays against the Byzantines.</p>

<p>Playing Genoese against Venetian, Bayazid lay about the walls of
Constantinople. His preparations were made: Constantinople, and
after that, Europe; the fate of Christendom wavered in the balance,
there before the walls of the ancient city of the East. And the
wretched Greeks, worn and starved, had already drawn up a
capitulation, when word came flying out of the East, a dusty,
bloodstained courier on a staggering horse. Out of the East, sudden
as a desert-storm, the Tatars had swept, and Sivas, Bayazid's
border city, had fallen.</p>

<p>That night the shuddering people on the walls of Constantinople
saw torches and cressets tossing and moving through the Turkish
camp, gleaming on dark hawk-faces and polished armor, but the
expected attack did not come, and dawn revealed a great flotilla of
boats moving in a steady double stream back and forth across the
Bosphorus, bearing the mailed warriors into Asia. The Thunderer's
eyes were at last turned eastward.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="samarcand4" name="samarcand4">CHAPTER 4</a>
</h2>

<p class="verse">"The deer runs wild on hill and dale.<br>
The birds fly wild from tree to tree;<br>
But there is neither bread nor kale.<br>
To fend my men and me."<br>
&mdash;Battle of <i>Otterbourne.</i></p>
<br>

<p class="first">"HERE we will camp," said Bayazid, shifting his
giant body in the gold-crusted saddle. He glanced back at the long
lines of his army, winding beyond sight over the distant hills:
over 200,000 fighting men; grim janizaries, spahis glittering in
plumes and silver mail, heavy cavalry in silk and steel; and his
allies and alien subjects, Greek and Wallachian pikemen, the twenty
thousand horsemen of King Peter Lazarus of Serbia, mailed from
crown to heel; there were troops of Tatars, too, who had wandered
into Asia Minor and been ground into the Ottoman empire with the
rest&mdash;stocky Kalmucks, who had been on the point of mutiny at
the beginning of the march, but had been quieted by a harangue from
Donald MacDeesa, in their own tongue.</p>

<p>For weeks the Turkish host had moved eastward on the Sivas road,
expecting to encounter the Tatars at any point. They had passed
Angora, where the Sultan had established his base-camp; they had
crossed the river Halys, or Kizil Irmak, and now were marching
through the hill country that lies in the bend of that river which,
rising east of Sivas, sweeps southward in a vast half-circle before
it bends, west of Kirshehr, northward to the Black Sea.</p>

<p>"Here we camp," repeated Bayazid; "Sivas lies some sixty-five
miles to the east. We will send scouts into the city."</p>

<p>"They will find it deserted," predicted Donald, riding at
Bayazid's side, and the Sultan scoffed, "Oh gem of wisdom, will the
Lame One flee so quickly?"</p>

<p>"He will not flee," answered the Gael. "Remember he can move his
host far more quickly than you can. He will take to the hills and
fall suddenly upon us when you least expect it."</p>

<p>Bayazid snorted his contempt. "Is he a magician, to flit among
the hills with a horde of 150,000 men? Bah! I tell you, he will
come along the Sivas road to join battle, and we will crack him
like a nutshell."</p>

<p>So the Turkish host went into camp and fortified the hills, and
there they waited with growing wrath and impatience for a week.
Bayazid's scouts returned with the news that only a handful of
Tatars held Sivas. The Sultan roared with rage and
bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Fools, have ye passed the Tatars on the road?"</p>

<p>"Nay, by Allah," swore the riders, "they vanished in the night
like ghosts, none can say whither. And we have combed the hills
between this spot and the city."</p>

<p>"Timour has fled back to his desert," said Peter Lazarus, and
Donald laughed.</p>

<p>"When rivers run uphill, Timour will flee," said he; "he lurks
somewhere in the hills to the south."</p>

<p>Bayazid had never taken other men's advice, for he had found
long ago that his own wit was superior. But now he was puzzled. He
had never before fought the desert riders whose secret of victory
was mobility and who passed through the land like blown clouds.
Then his outriders brought in word that bodies of mounted men had
been seen moving parallel to the Turkish right wing.</p>

<p>MacDeesa laughed like a jackal barking. "Now Timour sweeps upon
us from the south, as I predicted."</p>

<p>Bayazid drew up his lines and waited for the assault, but it did
not come and his scouts reported that the riders had passed on and
disappeared. Bewildered for the first time in his career, and mad
to come to grips with his illusive foe, Bayazid struck camp and on
a forced march reached the Halys river in two days, where he
expected to find Timour drawn up to dispute his passage. No Tatar
was to be seen. The Sultan cursed in his black beard; were these
eastern devils ghosts, to vanish in thin air?</p>

<p>He sent riders across the river and they came flying back,
splashing recklessly through the shallow water. They had seen the
Tatar rear guard. Timour had eluded the whole Turkish army, and was
even now marching on Angora! Frothing, Bayazid turned on
MacDeesa.</p>

<p>"Dog, what have you to say now?"</p>

<p>"What would you?" the Highlander stood his ground boldly. "You
have none but yourself to blame, if Timour has outwitted you. Have
you harkened to me in aught, good or bad? I told you Timour would
not await your coming, nor did he. I told you he would leave the
city and go into the southern hills. And he did. I told you he
would fall upon us suddenly, and therein I was mistaken. I did not
guess that he would cross the river and elude us. But all else I
warned you of has come to pass."</p>

<p>Bayazid grudgingly admitted the truth of the Frank's words, but
he was mad with fury. Else he had never sought to overtake the
swift-moving horde before it reached Angora.</p>

<p>He flung his columns across the river and started on the track
of the Tatars. Timour had crossed the river near Sivas, and moving
around the outer bend, eluded the Turks on the other side. And now
Bayazid followed his road, which swung outward from the river, into
the plains where there was little water&mdash;and no food, after
the horde had swept through with torch and blade.</p>

<p>The Turks marched over a fire-blackened, slaughter-reddened
waste. Timour covered the ground in three days, over which
Bayazid's columns staggered in a week of forced marching; a hundred
miles through the burning, desolated plain, strewn with bare hills
that made marching a hell. As the strength of the army lay in its
infantry, the cavalry was forced to set its pace with the
foot-soldiers, and all stumbled wearily through the clouds of
stinging dust that rose from beneath the sore, shuffling feet.
Under a burning summer sun they plodded grimly along, suffering
fiercely from hunger and thirst.</p>

<p>So they came at last to the plain of Angora, and saw the Tatars
installed in the camp they had left, besieging the city. And a roar
of desperation went up from the thirst-maddened Turks. Timour had
changed the course of the little river which ran through Angora, so
that now it ran behind the Tatar lines; the only way to reach it
was straight through the desert hordes. The springs and wells of
the countryside had been polluted or damaged. For an instant
Bayazid sat silent in his saddle, gazing from the Tatar camp to his
own long straggling lines, and the marks of suffering and vain
wrath in the drawn faces of his warriors. A strange fear tugged at
his heart, so unfamiliar he did not recognize the emotion. Victory
had always been his; could it ever be otherwise?</p>

<h2><a id="samarcand5" name="samarcand5">CHAPTER 5</a>
</h2>

<p class="verse">"What's yon that follows at my side?&mdash;<br>
The foe that ye must fight, my lord,&mdash;<br>
That hirples swift as I can ride?&mdash;<br>
The shadow of the night, my lord."<br>
&mdash;<i>Kipling.</i></p>
<br>

<p class="first">ON THAT still summer morning the battle-lines
stood ready for the death-grip. The Turks were drawn up in a long
crescent, whose tips overlapped the Tatar wings, one of which
touched the river and the other an entrenched hill fifteen miles
away across the plain.</p>

<p>"Never in all my life have I sought another's advice in war,"
said Bayazid, "but you rode with Timour six years. Will he come to
me?"</p>

<p>Donald shook his head. "You outnumber his host. He will never
fling his riders against the solid ranks of your janizaries. He
will stand afar off and overwhelm you with flights of arrows. You
must go to him."</p>

<p>"Can I charge his horse with my infantry?" snarled Bayazid. "Yet
you speak wise words. I must hurl my horse against his&mdash;and
Allah knows his is the better cavalry."</p>

<p>"His right wing is the weaker," said Donald, a sinister light
burning in his eyes. "Mass your strongest horsemen on your left
wing, charge and shatter that part of the Tatar host; then let your
left wing close in, assailing the main battle of the Amir on the
flank, while your janizaries advance from the front. Before the
charge the spahis on your right wing may make a feint at the lines,
to draw Timour's attention."</p>

<p>Bayazid looked silently at the Gael. Donald had suffered as much
as the rest on that fearful march. His mail was white with dust,
his lips blackened, his throat caked with thirst.</p>

<p>"So let it be," said Bayazid. "Prince Suleiman shall command the
left wing, with the Serbian horse and my own heavy cavalry,
supported by the Kalmucks. We will stake all on one charge!"</p>

<p>And so they took up their positions, and no one noticed a
flat-faced Kalmuck steal out of the Turkish lines and ride for
Timour's camp, flogging his stocky pony like mad. On the left wing
was massed the powerful Serbian cavalry and the Turkish heavy
horse, with the bow-armed Kalmucks behind. At the head of these
rode Donald, for they had clamored for the Frank to lead them
against their kin.</p>

<p>Bayazid did not intend to match bow-fire with the Tatars, but to
drive home a charge that would shatter Timour's lines before the
Amir could further outmaneuver him. The Turkish right wing
consisted of the spahis; the center of the janizaries and Serbian
foot with Peter Lazarus, under the personal command of the
Sultan.</p>

<p>Timour had no infantry. He sat with his bodyguard on a hillock
behind the lines. Nur ad-Din commanded the right wing of the riders
of high Asia, Ak Boga the left, Prince Muhammad the center. With
the center were the elephants in their leather trappings, with
their battle-towers and archers. Their awesome trumpeting was the
only sound along the widespread steel-clad Tatar lines as the Turks
came on with a thunder of cymbals and kettle-drums.</p>

<p>Like a thunderbolt Suleiman launched his squadrons at the Tatar
right wing. They ran full into a terrible blast of arrows, but
grimly they swept on, and the Tatar ranks reeled to the shock.
Suleiman, cutting a heron-plumed chieftain out of his saddle,
shouted in exultation, but even as he did so, behind him rose a
guttural roar, "<i>Ghar! ghar! ghar!</i> Smite, brothers, for the
lord Timour!"</p>

<p>With a sob of rage he turned and saw his horsemen going down in
windrows beneath the arrows of the Kalmucks. And in his ear he
heard Donald MacDeesa laughing like a madman.</p>

<p>"Traitor!" screamed the Turk. "This is your work&mdash;"</p>

<p>The claymore flashed in the sun and Prince Suleiman rolled
headless from his saddle.</p>

<p>"One stroke for Nicopolis!" yelled the maddened Highlander.
"Drive home your shafts, dog-brothers!"</p>

<p>The stocky Kalmucks yelped like wolves in reply, wheeling away
to avoid the scimitars of the desperate Turks, and driving their
deadly arrows into the milling ranks at close range. They had
endured much from their masters; now was the hour of reckoning. And
now the Tatar right wing drove home with a roar; and caught before
and behind, the Turkish cavalry buckled and crumpled, whole troops
breaking away in headlong flight. At one stroke had been swept away
Bayazid's chance to crush his enemy's formation.</p>

<p>As the charge had begun, the Turkish right wing had advanced
with a great blare of trumpets and roll of drums, and in the midst
of its feint, had been caught by the sudden unexpected charge of
the Tatar left. Ak Boga had swept through the light spahis, and
losing his head momentarily in the lust of slaughter, he drove them
flying before him until pursued and pursuers vanished over the
slopes in the distance.</p>

<p>Timour sent Prince Muhammad with a reserve squadron to support
the left wing and bring it back, while Nur ad-Din, sweeping aside
the remnants of Bayazid's cavalry, swung in a pivot-like movement
and thundered against the locked ranks of the janizaries. They held
like a wall of iron, and Ak Boga, galloping back from his pursuit
of the spahis, smote them on the other flank.</p>

<p>And now Timour himself mounted his war-steed, and the center
rolled like an iron wave against the staggering Turks. And now the
real death-grip came to be.</p>

<p>Charge after charge crashed on those serried ranks, surging on
and rolling back like onsweeping and receding waves. In clouds of
fire-shot dust the janizaries stood unshaken, thrusting with
reddened spears, smiting with dripping ax and notched scimitar. The
wild riders swept in like blasting whirlwinds, raking the ranks
with the storms of their arrows as they drew and loosed too swiftly
for the eye to follow, rushing headlong into the press, screaming
and hacking like madmen as their scimitars sheared through buckler,
helmet and skull. And the Turks beat them back, overthrowing horse
and rider; hacked them down and trampled them under, treading their
own dead under foot to close the ranks, until both hosts trod on a
carpet of the slain and the hoofs of the Tatar steeds splashed
blood at every leap.</p>

<p>Repeated charges tore the Turkish host apart at last, and all
over the plain the fight raged on, where clumps of spearmen stood
back to back, slaying and dying beneath the arrows and scimitars of
the riders from the steppes. Through the clouds of rising dust
stalked the elephants trumpeting like Doom, while the archers on
their backs rained down blasts of arrows and sheets of fire that
withered men in their mail like burnt grain.</p>

<p>All day Bayazid had fought grimly on foot at the head of his
men. At his side fell King Peter, pierced by a score of arrows.
With a thousand of his janizaries the Sultan held the highest hill
upon the plain, and through the blazing hell of that long afternoon
he held it still, while his men died beside him. In a hurricane of
splintering spears, lashing axes and ripping scimitars, the
Sultan's warriors held the victorious Tatars to a gasping deadlock.
And then Donald MacDeesa, on foot, eyes glaring like a mad dog's,
rushed headlong through the melee and smote the Sultan with such
hate-driven fury that the crested helmet shattered beneath the
claymore's whistling edge and Bayazid fell like a dead man. And
over the weary groups of bloodstained defenders rolled the dark
tide, and the kettle drums of the Tatars thundered victory.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="samarcand6" name="samarcand6">CHAPTER 6</a>
</h2>

<p class="verse">"The searing glory which hath shone<br>
Amid the jewels of my throne.<br>
Halo of Hell! and with a pain<br>
Not Hell shall make me fear again."<br>
&mdash;Poe: Tamerlane.</p>
<br>

<p class="first">THE POWER of the Osmanli was broken, the heads of
the emirs heaped before Timour's tent. But the Tatars swept on; at
the heels of the flying Turks they burst into Brusa, Bayazid's
capital, sweeping the streets with sword and flame. Like a
whirlwind they came and like a whirlwind they went, laden with
treasures of the palace and the women of the vanished Sultan's
seraglio.</p>

<p>Riding back to the Tatar camp beside Nur ad-Din and Ak Boga,
Donald MacDeesa learned that Bayazid lived. The stroke which had
felled him had only stunned, and the Turk was captive to the Amir
he had mocked. MacDeesa cursed; the Gael was dusty and stained with
hard riding and harder fighting; dried blood darkened his mail and
clotted his scabbard mouth. A red-soaked scarf was bound about his
thigh as a rude bandage; his eyes were bloodshot, his thin lips
frozen in a snarl of battle-fury.</p>

<p>"By God, I had not thought a bullock could survive that blow. Is
he to be crucified&mdash;as he swore to deal with Timour thus?"</p>

<p>"Timour gave him good welcome and will do him no hurt," answered
the courtier who brought the news. "The Sultan will sit at the
feast."</p>

<p>Ak Boga shook his head, for he was merciful except in the rush
of battle, but in Donald's ears were ringing the screams of the
butchered captives at Nicopolis, and he laughed shortly&mdash;a
laugh that was not pleasant to hear.</p>

<p>To the fierce heart of the Sultan, death was easier than sitting
a captive at the feast which always followed a Tatar victory.
Bayazid sat like a grim image, neither speaking nor seeming to hear
the crash of the kettle-drums, the roar of barbaric revelry. On his
head was the jeweled turban of sovereignty, in his hand the
gem-starred scepter of his vanished empire.</p>

<p>He did not touch the great golden goblet before him. Many and
many a time had he exulted over the agony of the vanquished, with
much less mercy than was now shown him; now the unfamiliar bite of
defeat left him frozen.</p>

<p>He stared at the beauties of his seraglio, who, according to
Tatar custom, tremblingly served their new masters: black-haired
Jewesses with slumberous, heavy-lidded eyes; lithe tawny
Circassians and golden-haired Russians; dark-eyed Greek girls and
Turkish women with figures like Juno&mdash;all naked as the day
they were born, under the burning eyes of the Tatar lords.</p>

<p>He had sworn to ravish Timour's wives&mdash;the Sultan writhed
as he saw the Despina, sister of Peter Lazarus and his favorite,
nude like the rest, kneel and in quivering fear offer Timour a
goblet of wine. The Tatar absently wove his fingers in her golden
locks and Bayazid shuddered as if those fingers were locked in his
own heart.</p>

<p>And he saw Donald MacDeesa sitting next to Timour, his stained
dusty garments contrasting strangely with the silk-and-gold
splendor of the Tatar lords&mdash;his savage eyes ablaze, his dark
face wilder and more passionate than ever as he ate like a ravenous
wolf and drained goblet after goblet of stinging wine. And
Bayazid's iron control snapped. With a roar that struck the clamor
dumb, the Thunderer lurched upright, breaking the heavy scepter
like a twig between his hands and dashing the fragments to the
floor.</p>

<p>All eyes turned toward him and some of the Tatars stepped
quickly between him and their Amir, who only looked at him
impassively.</p>

<p>"Dog and spawn of a dog!" roared Bayazid. "You came to me as one
in need and I sheltered you! The curse of all traitors rest on your
black heart!"</p>

<p>MacDeesa heaved up, scattered goblets and bowls.</p>

<p>"Traitors?" he yelled. "Is six years so long you forget the
headless corpses that molder at Nicopolis? Have you forgotten the
ten thousand captives you slew there, naked and with their hands
bound? I fought you there with steel; and since I have fought you
with guile! Fool, from the hour you marched from Brusa, you were
doomed! It was I who spoke softly to the Kalmucks, who hated you;
so they were content and seemed willing to serve you. With them I
communicated with Timour from the time we first left
Angora&mdash;sending riders forth secretly or feigning to hunt for
antelopes.</p>

<p>"Through me, Timour tricked you&mdash;even put into your head
the plan of your battle! I caught you in a web of truths, knowing
that you would follow your own course, regardless of what I or any
one else said. I told you but two lies&mdash;when I said I sought
revenge on Timour, and when I said the Amir would bide in the hills
and fall upon us. Before battle joined I knew what Timour wished,
and by my advice led you into a trap. So Timour, who had drawn out
the plan you thought part yours and part mine, knew beforehand
every move you would make. But in the end, it hinged on me, for it
was I who turned the Kalmucks against you, and their arrows in the
backs of your horsemen which tipped the scales when the battle hung
in the balance.</p>

<p>"I paid high for my vengeance, Turk! I played my part under the
eyes of your spies, in your court, every instant, even when my head
was reeling with wine. I fought for you against the Greeks and took
wounds. In the wilderness beyond the Halys I suffered with the
rest. And I would have gone through greater hells to bring you to
the dust!"</p>

<p>"Serve well your master as you have served me, traitor,"
retorted the Sultan. "In the end, Timour-il-leng, you will rue the
day you took this adder into your naked hands. Aye, may each of you
bring the other down to death!"</p>

<p>"Be at ease, Bayazid," said Timour impassively. "What is
written, is written."</p>

<p>"Aye!" answered the Turk with a terrible laugh. "And it is not
written that the Thunderer should live a buffoon for a crippled
dog! Lame One, Bayazid gives you&mdash;hail and farewell!"</p>

<p>And before any could stay him, the Sultan snatched a
carving-knife from a table and plunged it to the hilt in his
throat. A moment he reeled like a mighty tree, spurting blood, and
then crashed thunderously down. All noise was hushed as the
multitude stood aghast. A pitiful cry rang out as the young Despina
ran forward, and dropping to her knees, drew the lion's head of her
grim lord to her naked bosom, sobbing convulsively. But Timour
stroked his beard measuredly and half-abstractedly. And Donald
MacDeesa, seating himself, took up a great goblet that glowed
crimson in the torchlight, and drank deeply.</p>

<h2><a id="samarcand7" name="samarcand7">CHAPTER 7</a>
</h2>

<p class="verse">"Hath not the same fierce heirdom given<br>
Rome to the Caesar&mdash;this to me?"<br>
&mdash;Poe: Tamerlane.</p>
<br>

<p class="first">TO UNDERSTAND the relationship of Donald MacDeesa
to Timour, it is necessary to go back to that day, six years
before, when in the turquoise-domed palace at Samarcand the Amir
planned the overthrow of the Ottoman.</p>

<p>When other men looked days ahead, Timour looked years; and five
years passed before he was ready to move against the Turk, and let
Donald ride to Brusa ahead of a carefully trained pursuit. Five
years of fierce fighting in the mountain snows and the desert dust,
through which Timour moved like a mythical giant, and hard as he
drove his chiefs, he drove the Highlander harder. It was as if he
studied MacDeesa with the impersonally cruel eyes of a scientist,
wringing every ounce of accomplishment from him, seeking to find
the limit of man's endurance and valor&mdash;the final
breaking-point. He did not find it.</p>

<p>The Gael was too utterly reckless to be trusted with hosts and
armies. But in raids and forays, in the storming of cities, and in
charges of battle, in any action requiring personal valor and
prowess, the Highlander was all but invincible. He was a typical
fighting-man of European wars, where tactics and strategy meant
little and ferocious hand-to-hand fighting much, and where battles
were decided by the physical prowess of the champions. In tricking
the Turk, he had but followed the instructions given him by
Timour.</p>

<p>There was scant love lost between the Gael and the Amir, to whom
Donald was but a ferocious barbarian from the outlands of
Frankistan. Timour never showered gifts and honors on Donald, as he
did upon his Moslem chiefs. But the grim Gael scorned these gauds,
seeming to derive his only pleasures from hard fighting and hard
drinking. He ignored the formal reverence paid the Amir by his
subjects, and in his cups dared beard the somber Tatar to his face,
so that the people caught their breath.</p>

<p>"He is a wolf I unleash on my foes," said Timour on one occasion
to his lords.</p>

<p>"He is a two-edged blade that might cut the wielder," ventured
one of them.</p>

<p>"Not so long as the blade is forever smiting my enemies,"
answered Timour.</p>

<p>After Angora, Timour gave Donald command of the Kalmucks, who
accompanied their kin back into high Asia, and a swarm of restless,
turbulent Vigurs. That was his reward: a wider range and a greater
capacity for grinding toil and heart-bursting warfare. But Donald
made no comment; he worked his slayers into fighting shape, and
experimented with various types of saddles and armor, with
firelocks&mdash;finding them much inferior in actual execution to
the bows of the Tatars&mdash;and with the latest type of firearm,
the cumbrous wheel-lock pistols used by the Arabs a century before
they made their appearance in Europe.</p>

<p>Timour hurled Donald against his foes as a man hurls a javelin,
little caring whether the weapon be broken or not. The Gael's
horsemen would come back bloodstained, dusty and weary, their armor
hacked to shreds, their swords notched and blunted, but always with
the heads of Timour's foes swinging at their high saddle-peaks.
Their savagery, and Donald's own wild ferocity and superhuman
strength, brought them repeatedly out of seemingly hopeless
positions. And Donald's wild-beast vitality caused him again and
again to recover from ghastly wounds, until the iron-thewed Tatars
marveled at him.</p>

<p>As the years passed, Donald, always aloof and taciturn, withdrew
more and more to himself. When not riding on campaigns, he sat
alone in brooding silence in the taverns, or stalked dangerously
through the streets, hand on his great sword, while the people
slunk softly from in front of him. He had one friend, Ak Boga; but
one interest outside of war and carnage. On a raid into Persia, a
slim white wisp of a girl had run screaming across the path of the
charging squadron and his men had seen Donald bend down and sweep
her up into his saddle with one mighty hand. The girl was Zuleika,
a Persian dancer.</p>

<p>Donald had a house in Samarcand, and a handful of servants, but
only this one girl. She was comely, sensual and giddy. She adored
her master in her way, and feared him with a very ecstasy of fear,
but was not above secret amours with young soldiers when MacDeesa
was away on the wars.</p>

<p>Like most Persian women of her caste, she had a capacity for
petty intrigue and an inability for keeping her small nose out of
affairs which were none of her business. She became a tale-bearer
for Shadi Mulkh, the Persian paramour of Khalil, Timour's weak
grandson, and thereby indirectly changed the destiny of the world.
She was greedy, vain and an outrageous liar, but her hands were
soft as drifting snow-flakes when she dressed the wounds of sword
and spear on Donald's iron body. He never beat or cursed her, and
though he never caressed or wooed her with gentle words as other
men might, it was well known that he treasured her above all
worldly possessions and honors.</p>

<p>Timour was growing old; he had played with the world as a man
plays with a chessboard, using kings and armies for pawns. As a
young chief without wealth or power, he had overthrown his Mongol
masters, and mastered them in his turn. Tribe after tribe, race
after race, kingdom after kingdom he had broken and molded into his
growing empire, which stretched from the Gobi to the Mediterranean,
from Moscow to Delhi&mdash;the mightiest empire the world ever
knew.</p>

<p>He had opened the doors of the South and East, and through them
flowed the wealth of the earth. He had saved Europe from an Asiatic
invasion, when he checked the tide of Turkish conquest&mdash;a fact
of which he neither knew nor cared. He had built cities and he had
destroyed cities. He had made the desert blossom like a garden, and
he had turned flowering lands into desert. At his command pyramids
of skulls had reared up, and lives flowed out like rivers. His
helmeted warlords were exalted above the multitudes and nations
cried out in vain beneath his grinding heel, like lost women crying
in the mountains at night.</p>

<p>Now he looked eastward, where the purple empire of Cathay
dreamed away the centuries. Perhaps, with the waning of life's
tide, it was the old sleeping home-calling of his race; perhaps he
remembered the ancient heroic khans, his ancestors, who had ridden
southward out of the barren Gobi into the purple kingdoms.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
The Grand Vizier shook his head, as he played at chess with his
imperial master. He was old and weary, and he dared speak his mind
even to Timour.</p>

<p>"My lord, of what avail these endless wars? You have already
subjugated more nations than Genghis Khan or Alexander. Rest in the
peace of your conquests and complete the work you have begun in
Samarcand. Build more stately palaces. Bring here the philosophers,
the artists, the poets of the world&mdash;"</p>

<p>Timour shrugged his massive shoulders.</p>

<p>"Philosophy and poetry and architecture are good enough in their
way, but they are mist and smoke to conquest, for it is on the red
splendor of conquest that all these things rest."</p>

<p>The Vizier played with the ivory pawns, shaking his hoary
head.</p>

<p>"My lord, you are like two men&mdash;one a builder, the other a
destroyer."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I destroy so that I may build on the ruins of my
destruction," the Amir answered. "I have never sought to reason out
this matter. I only know that I am a conqueror before I am a
builder, and conquest is my life's blood."</p>

<p>"But what reason to overthrow this great weak bulk of Cathay?"
protested the Vizier. "It will mean but more slaughter, with which
you have already crimsoned the earth&mdash;more woe and misery,
with helpless people dying like sheep beneath the sword."</p>

<p>Timour shook his head, half-absently. "What are their lives?
They die anyway, and their existence is full of misery. I will draw
a band of iron about the heart of Tatary. With this Eastern
conquest I will strengthen my throne, and kings of my dynasty shall
rule the world for ten thousand years. All the roads of the world
shall lead to Samarcand, and there shall be gathered the wonder and
mystery and glory of the world&mdash;colleges and libraries and
stately mosques&mdash;marble domes and sapphire towers and
turquoise minarets. But first I shall carry out my
destiny&mdash;and that is Conquest!"</p>

<p>"But winter draws on," urged the Vizier. "At least wait until
spring."</p>

<p>Timour shook his head, unspeaking. He knew he was old; even his
iron frame was showing signs of decay. And sometimes in his sleep
he heard the singing of Aljai the Dark-eyed, the bride of his
youth, dead for more than forty years. So through the Blue City ran
the word, and men left their lovemaking and their wine-bibbing,
strung their bows, looked to their harness and took up again the
worn old road of conquest.</p>

<p>Timour and his chiefs took with them many of their wives and
servants, for the Amir intended to halt at Otrar, his border city,
and from thence strike into Cathay when the snows melted in the
spring. Such of his lords as remained rode with him&mdash;war took
a heavy toll of Timour's hawks.</p>

<p>As usual Donald MacDeesa and his turbulent rogues led the
advance. The Gael was glad to take the road after months of
idleness, but he brought Zuleika with him. The years were growing
more bitter for the giant Highlander, an outlander among alien
races. His wild horsemen worshipped him in their savage way, but he
was an alien among them, after all, and they could never understand
his inmost thoughts. Ak Boga with his twinkling eyes and jovial
laughter had been more like the men Donald had known in his youth,
but Ak Boga was dead, his great heart stilled forever by the stroke
of an Arab scimitar, and in his growing loneliness Donald more and
more sought solace in the Persian girl, who could never understand
his strange wayward heart, but who somehow partly filled an aching
void in his soul. Through the long lonely nights his hands sought
her slim form with a dim formless unquiet hunger even she could
dimly sense.</p>

<p>In a strange silence Timour rode out of Samarcand at the head of
his long glittering columns and the people did not cheer as of old.
With bowed heads and hearts crowded with emotions they could not
define, they watched the last conqueror ride forth, and then turned
again to their petty lives and commonplace, dreary tasks, with a
vague instinctive sense that something terrible and splendid and
awesome had gone out of their lives forever.</p>

<p>In the teeth of the rising winter the hosts moved, not with the
speed of other times when they passed through the land like
windblown clouds. They were two hundred thousand strong and they
bore with them herds of spare horses, wagons of supplies and great
tent-pavilions.</p>

<p>Beyond the pass men call the Gates of Timour, snow fell, and
into the teeth of the blizzard the army toiled doggedly. At last it
became apparent that even Tatars could not march in such weather,
and Prince Khalil went into winter quarters in that strange town
called the Stone City, but Timour plunged on with his own troops.
Ice lay three feet deep on the Syr when they crossed, and in the
hill-country beyond the going became fiercer, and horses and camels
stumbled through the drifts, the wagons lurching and rocking. But
the will of Timour drove them grimly onward, and at last they came
upon the plain and saw the spires of Otrar gleaming through the
whirling snow-wrack.</p>

<p>Timour installed himself and his nobles in the palace, and his
warriors went thankfully into winter quarters. But he sent for
Donald MacDeesa.</p>

<p>"Ordushar lies in our road," said Timour. "Take two thousand men
and storm that city that our road be clear to Cathay with the
coming of spring."</p>

<p>When a man casts a javelin he little cares if it splinter on the
mark. Timour would not have sent his valued emirs and chosen
warriors on this, the maddest quest he had yet given even Donald.
But the Gael cared not; he was more than ready to ride on any
adventure which might drown the dim bitter dreams that gnawed
deeper and deeper at his heart.</p>

<p>At the age of forty MacDeesa's iron frame was unweakened, his
ferocious valor undimmed. But at times he felt old in his heart.
His thoughts turned more and more back over the black and crimson
pattern of his life with its violence and treachery and savagery;
its woe and waste and stark futility. He slept fitfully and seemed
to hear half-forgotten voices crying in the night. Sometimes it
seemed the keening of Highland pipes skirled through the howling
winds.</p>

<p>He roused his wolves, who gaped at the command but obeyed
without comment, and rode out of Otrar in a roaring blizzard. It
was a venture of the damned.</p>

<p>In the palace of Otrar, Timour drowsed on his divan over his
maps and charts, and listened drowsily to the everlasting disputes
between the women of his household. The intrigues and jealousies of
the Samarcand palaces reached to isolated Otrar. They buzzed about
him, wearying him to death with their petty spite.</p>

<p>As age stole on the iron Amir, the women looked eagerly to his
naming of a successor&mdash;his queen Sarai Mulkh Khanum; Khan
Zade, wife of his dead son Jahangir. Against the queen's claim for
her son&mdash; and Timour's&mdash;Shah Ruhk, was opposed the
intrigue of Khan Zade for her son, Prince Khalil, whom the
courtesan Shadi Mulkh wrapped about her pink finger.</p>

<p>The Amir had brought Shadi Mulkh with him to Otrar, much against
Khalil's will. The Prince was growing restless in the bleak Stone
City and hints reached Timour of discord and threats of
insubordination. Sarai Khanum came to the Amir, a gaunt weary
woman, grown old in wars and grief.</p>

<p>"The Persian girl sends secret messages to Prince Khalil,
stirring him up to deeds of folly," said the Great Lady. "You are
far from Samarcand. Were Khalil to march thither before
you&mdash;there are always fools ready to revolt, even against the
Lord of Lords."</p>

<p>"At another time," said Timour wearily, "I would have her
strangled. But Khalil in his folly would rise against me, and a
revolt at this time, however quickly put down, would upset all my
plans. Have her confined and closely guarded, so that she can send
no more messages."</p>

<p>"This I have already done," replied Sarai Khanum grimly, "but
she is clever and manages to get messages out of the palace by
means of the Persian girl of the Caphar, lord Donald."</p>

<p>"Fetch this girl," ordered Timour, laying aside his maps with a
sigh.</p>

<p>They dragged Zuleika before the Amir, who looked somberly upon
her as she groveled whimpering at his feet, and with a weary
gesture, sealed her doom&mdash;and immediately forgot her, as a
king forgets the fly he has crushed.</p>

<p>They dragged the girl screaming from the imperial presence and
hurled her upon her knees in a hall which had no windows and only
bolted doors. Groveling on her knees she wailed frantically for
Donald and screamed for mercy, until terror froze her voice in her
pulsing throat, and through a mist of horror she saw the stark
half-naked figure and the mask-like face of the grim executioner
advancing, knife in hand...</p>

<p>Zuleika was neither brave nor admirable. She neither lived with
dignity nor met her fate with courage. She was cowardly, immoral
and foolish. But even a fly loves life, and a worm would cry out
under the heel that crushed it. And perhaps, in the grim
inscrutable books of Fate, even an emperor may not forever trample
insects with impunity.</p>

<h2><a id="samarcand8" name="samarcand8">CHAPTER 8</a>
</h2>

<p class="verse">"But I have dreamed a dreary dream.<br>
Beyond the Vale of Skye;<br>
I saw a dead man win a fight.<br>
And I think that man was I."<br>
&mdash;Battle of Otterbourne.</p>
<br>

<p class="first">AND AT ORDUSHAR the siege dragged on. In the
freezing winds that swept down the pass, driving snow in blinding,
biting blasts, the stocky Kalmucks and the lean Vigurs strove and
suffered and died in bitter anguish.</p>

<p>They set scaling-ladders against the walls and struggled upward,
and the defenders, suffering no less, speared them, hurled down
boulders that crushed the mailed figures like beetles, and thrust
the ladders from the walls so that they crashed down, bearing death
to men below. Ordushar was actually but a stronghold of the Jat
Mongols, set sheer in the pass and flanked by towering cliffs.</p>

<p>Donald's wolves hacked at the frozen ground with frost-bitten
raw hands which scarce could hold the picks, striving to sink a
mine under the walls. They pecked at the towers while molten lead
and weighted javelins fell in a rain upon them; driving their
spear-points between the stones, tearing out pieces of masonry with
their naked hands. With stupendous toil they had constructed
makeshift siege-engines from felled trees and the leather of their
harness and woven hair from the manes and tails of their
warhorses.</p>

<p>The rams battered vainly at the massive stones, the ballistas
groaned as they launched tree-trunks and boulders against the
towers or over the walls. Along the parapets the attackers fought
with the defenders, until their bleeding hands froze to spear-shaft
and sword-hilt, and the skin came away in great raw strips. And
always, with superhuman fury rising above their agony, the
defenders hurled back the attack.</p>

<p>A storming-tower was built and rolled up to the walls, and from
the battlements the men of Ordushar poured a drenching torrent of
naphtha that sent it up in flame and burnt the men in it,
shriveling them in their armor like beetles in a fire. Snow and
sleet fell in blinding flurries, freezing to sheets of ice. Dead
men froze stiffly where they fell, and wounded men died in their
sleeping-furs. There was no rest, no surcease from agony. Days and
nights merged into a hell of pain. Donald's men, with tears of
suffering frozen on their faces, beat frenziedly against the frosty
stone walls, fought with raw hands gripping broken weapons, and
died cursing the gods that created them.</p>

<p>The misery inside the city was no less, for there was no more
food. At night Donald's warriors heard the wailing of the starving
people in the streets. At last in desperation the men of Ordushar
cut the throats of their women and children and sallied forth, and
the haggard Tatars fell on them weeping with the madness of rage
and woe, and in a welter of battle that crimsoned the frozen snow,
drove them back through the city gates. And the struggle went
hideously on.</p>

<p>Donald used up the last wood in the vicinity to erect another
storming-tower higher than the city wall. After that there was no
more wood for the fires. He himself stood at the uplifted bridge
which was to be lowered to rest on the parapets. He had not spared
himself. Day and night he had toiled beside his men, suffering as
they had suffered. The tower was rolled to the wall in a hail of
arrows that slew half the warriors who had not found shelter behind
the thick bulwark. A crude cannon bellowed from the walls, but the
clumsy round shot whistled over their heads. The naphtha and Greek
fire of the Jats was exhausted. In the teeth of the singing shafts
the bridge was dropped.</p>

<p>Drawing his claymore, Donald strode out upon it. Arrows broke on
his corselet and glanced from his helmet. Firelocks flashed and
bellowed in his face but he strode on unhurt. Lean armored men with
eyes like mad dogs' swarmed upon the parapet, seeking to dislodge
the bridge, to hack it asunder. Among them Donald sprang, his
claymore whistling. The great blade sheared through mail-mesh,
flesh and bone, and the struggling clump fell apart.</p>

<p>Donald staggered on the edge of the wall as a heavy ax crashed
on his shield, and he struck back, cleaving the wielder's spine.
The Gael recovered his balance, tossing away his riven shield. His
wolves were swarming over the bridge behind him, hurling the
defenders from the parapet, cutting them down. Into a swirl of
battle Donald strode, swinging his heavy blade. He thought
fleetingly of Zuleika, as men in the madness of battle will think
of irrelevant things, and it was as if the thought of her had hurt
him fiercely under the heart. But it was a spear that had girded
through his mail, and Donald struck back savagely; the claymore
splintered in his hand and he leaned against the parapet, his face
briefly contorted. Around him swept the tides of slaughter as the
pent-up fury of his warriors, maddened by the long weeks of
suffering, burst all bounds.</p>

<h2><a id="samarcand9" name="samarcand9">CHAPTER 9</a>

<p class="verse">"While the red flashing of the light<br>
From clouds that hung, like banners, o'er.<br>
Appeared to my half-closing eye<br>
The pageantry of monarchy."<br>
&mdash;Poe: Tamerlane.</p>
<br>

<p class="first">TO TIMOUR on his throne in the palace of Otrar
came the Grand Vizier.</p>

<p>"The survivors of the men sent to the Pass of Ordushar are
returning, my lord. The city in the mountains is no more. They bear
the lord Donald on a litter, and he is dying."</p>

<p>They brought the litter into Timour's presence, weary, dull-eyed
men, with raw wounds tied up with blood-crusted rags, their
garments and mail in tatters. They flung before the Amir's feet the
golden-scaled corselets of chiefs, and chests of jewels and robes
of silk and silver braid; the loot of Ordushar where men had
starved among riches. And they set the litter down before
Timour.</p>

<p>The Amir looked at the form of Donald. The Highlander was pale,
but his sinister face showed no hint of weakness in that wild
spirit, his cold eyes gleamed unquenched.</p>

<p>"The road to Cathay is clear," said Donald, speaking with
difficulty. "Ordushar lies in smoking ruins. I have carried out
your last command."</p>

<p>Timour nodded, his eyes seeming to gaze through and beyond the
Highlander. What was a dying man on a litter to the Amir, who had
seen so many die? His mind was on the road to Cathay and the purple
kingdoms beyond. The javelin had shattered at last, but its final
cast had opened the imperial path. Timour's dark eyes burned with
strange depths and leaping shadows, as the old fire stole through
his blood. Conquest! Outside the winds howled, as if trumpeting the
roar of nakars, the clash of cymbals, the deep-throated chant of
victory.</p>

<p>"Send Zuleika to me," the dying man muttered. Timour did not
reply; he scarcely heard, sitting lost in thunderous visions. He
had already forgotten Zuleika and her fate. What was one death in
the awesome and terrible scheme of empire.</p>

<p>"Zuleika, where is Zuleika?" the Gael repeated, moving
restlessly on his litter. Timour shook himself slightly and lifted
his head, remembering.</p>

<p>"I had her put to death," he answered quietly. "It was
necessary."</p>

<p>"Necessary!" Donald strove to rear upright, his eyes terrible,
but fell back, gagging, and spat out a mouthful of crimson. "You
bloody dog, she was mine!"</p>

<p>"Yours or another's," Timour rejoined absently, his mind far
away. "What is a woman in the plan of imperial destinies?"</p>

<p>For answer Donald plucked a pistol from among his robes and
fired point-blank. Timour started and swayed on his throne, and the
courtiers cried out, paralyzed with horror.</p>

<p>Through the drifting smoke they saw that Donald lay dead on the
litter, his thin lips frozen in a grim smile. Timour sat crumpled
on his throne, one hand gripping his breast; through those fingers
blood oozed darkly. With his free hand he waved back his
nobles.</p>

<p>"Enough; it is finished. To every man comes the end of the road.
Let Pir Muhammad reign in my stead, and let him strengthen the
lines of the empire I have reared with my hands."</p>

<p>A rack of agony twisted his features. "Allah, that this should
be the end of empire!"</p>

<p>It was a fierce cry of anguish from his inmost soul. "That I,
who have trodden upon kingdoms and humbled sultans, come to my doom
because of a cringing trull and a Caphar renegade!"</p>

<p>His helpless chiefs saw his mighty hands clench like iron as he
held death at bay by the sheer power of his unconquered will. The
fatalism of his accepted creed had never found resting-place in his
instinctively pagan soul; he was a fighter to the red end.</p>

<p>"Let not my people know that Timour died by the hand of a
Caphar," he spoke with growing difficulty. "Let not the chronicles
of the ages blazon the name of a wolf that slew an emperor. Ah God,
that a bit of dust and metal can dash the Conqueror of the World
into the dark! Write, scribe, that this day, by the hand of no man,
but by the will of Allah, died Timour, Servant of God."</p>

<p>The chiefs stood about in dazed silence, while the pallid scribe
took up parchment and wrote with a shaking hand. Timour's somber
eyes were fixed on Donald's still features that seemed to give back
his stare, as the dead on the litter faced the dying on the throne.
And before the scratching of the quill had ceased, Timour's lion
head had sunk upon his mighty chest. And without the wind howled a
dirge, drifting the snow higher and higher about the walls of
Otrar, even as the sands of oblivion drifted already about the
crumbling empire of Timour, the Last Conqueror, Lord of the
World.</p>
