<h2><a id="belshazzar1" name="belshazzar1">CHAPTER I</a>
</h2>

<p style="text-indent:0">ONCE it was called Eski-Hissar, the Old
Castle, for it was very ancient even when the first Seljuks swept
out of the east, and not even the Arabs, who rebuilt that crumbling
pile in the days of Abu Bekr, knew what hands reared those massive
bastions among the frowning foothills of the Taurus. Now, since the
old keep had become a bandit's hold, men called it Bab-el-Shaitan,
the Gate of the Devil, and with good reason.</p>

<p>That night there was feasting in the great hall. Heavy tables
loaded with wine pitchers and jugs, and huge platters of food,
stood flanked by crude benches for such as ate in that manner,
while on the floor large cushions received the reclining forms of
others. Trembling slaves hastened about, filling goblets from
wineskins and bearing great joints of roasted meat and loaves of
bread.</p>

<p>Here luxury and nakedness met, the riches of degenerate
civilizations and the stark savagery of utter barbarism. Men clad
in stenching sheepskins lolled on silken cushions, exquisitely
brocaded, and guzzled from solid golden goblets, fragile as the
stem of a desert flower. They wiped their bearded lips and hairy
hands on velvet tapestries worthy of a shah's palace.</p>

<p>All the races of western Asia met here. Here were slim, lethal
Persians, dangerous-eyed Turks in mail shirts, lean Arabs, tall
ragged Kurds, Lurs and Armenians in sweaty sheepskins, fiercely
mustached Circassians, even a few Georgians, with hawk-faces and
devilish tempers.</p>

<p>Among them was one who stood out boldly from all the rest. He
sat at a table drinking wine from a huge goblet, and the eyes of
the others strayed to him continually. Among these tall sons of the
desert and mountains his height did not seem particularly great,
though it was above six feet. But the breadth and thickness of him
were gigantic. His shoulders were broader, his limbs more massive
than any other warrior there.</p>

<p>His mail coif was thrown back, revealing a lion-like head and a
great corded throat. Though browned by the sun, his face was not as
dark as those about him and his eyes were a volcanic blue, which
smoldered continually as if from inner fires of wrath. Square-cut
black hair like a lion's mane crowned a low, broad forehead.</p>

<p>He ate and drank apparently oblivious to the questioning glances
flung toward him. Not that any had as yet challenged his right to
feast in Bab-el- Shaitan, for this was a lair open to all refugees
and outlaws. And this Frank was Cormac FitzGeoffrey, outlawed and
hunted by his own race. The ex-Crusader was armed in close-meshed
chain mail from head to foot. A heavy sword hung at his hip, and
his kite-shaped shield with the grinning skull wrought in the
center lay with his heavy vizorless helmet, on the bench beside
him. There was no hypocrisy of etiquette in Bab-el-Shaitan. Its
occupants went armed to the teeth at all times and no one
questioned another's right to sit down to meat with his sword at
hand.</p>

<p>Cormac, as he ate, scanned his fellow-feasters openly. Truly
Bab-el- Shaitan was a lair of the spawn of Hell, the last retreat
of men so desperate and bestial that the rest of the world had cast
them out in horror. Cormac was no stranger to savage men; in his
native Ireland he had sat among barbaric figures in the gatherings
of chiefs and reavers in the hills. But the wild- beast appearance
and utter inhumanness of some of these men impressed even the
fierce Irish warrior.</p>

<p>There, for instance, was a Lur, hairy as an ape, tearing at a
half-raw joint of meat with yellow fangs like a wolf's. Kadra
Muhammad, the fellow's name was, and Cormac wondered briefly if
such a creature could have a human soul. Or that shaggy Kurd beside
him, whose lip, twisted back by a sword scar into a permanent
snarl, bared a tooth like a boar's tusk. Surely no divine spark of
soul-dust animated these men, but the merciless and soulless spirit
of the grim land that bred them. Eyes, wild and cruel as the eyes
of wolves, glared through lank strands of tangled hair, hairy hands
unconsciously gripped the hilts of knives even while the owners
gorged and guzzled.</p>

<p>Cormac glanced from the rank and file to scrutinize the leaders
of the band&mdash;those whom superior wit or war-skill had placed
high in the confidence of their terrible chief, Skol Abdhur, the
Butcher. Not one but had a whole volume of black and bloody history
behind him. There was that slim Persian, whose tone was so silky,
whose eyes were so deadly, and whose small, shapely head was that
of a human panther&mdash;Nadir Tous, once an emir high in the favor
of the Shah of Kharesmia. And that Seljuk Turk, with his silvered
mail shirt, peaked helmet and jewel-hilted scimitar&mdash;Kai Shah;
he had ridden at Saladin's side in high honor once, and it was said
that the scar which showed white in the angle of his jaw had been
made by the sword of Richard the Lion-hearted in that great battle
before the walls of Joppa. And that wiry, tall, eagle-faced Arab,
Yussef el Mekru&mdash;he had been a great sheikh once in Yemen and
had even led a revolt against the Sultan himself.</p>

<p>But at the head of the table at which Cormac sat was one whose
history for strangeness and vivid fantasy dimmed them all. Tisolino
di Strozza, trader, captain of Venice's warships, Crusader, pirate,
outlaw&mdash;what a red trail the man had followed to his present
casteless condition! Di Strozza was tall and thin and saturnine in
appearance, with a hook-nosed, thin-nostriled face of distinctly
predatory aspect. His armor, now worn and tarnished, was of costly
Venetian make, and the hilt of his long narrow sword had once been
set with gems. He was a man of restless soul, thought Cormac, as he
watched the Venetian's dark eyes dart continually from point to
point, and the lean hand repeatedly lifted to twist the ends of the
thin mustache.</p>

<p>Cormac's gaze wandered to the other chiefs&mdash;wild reavers,
born to the red trade of pillage and murder, whose pasts were black
enough, but lacked the varied flavor of the other four. He knew
these by sight or reputation&mdash;Kojar Mirza, a brawny Kurd;
Shalmar Khor, a tall swaggering Circassian; and Jusus Zehor, a
renegade Georgian who wore half a dozen knifes in his girdle.</p>

<p>There was one not known to him, a warrior who apparently had no
standing among the bandits, yet who carried himself with the
assurance born of prowess. He was of a type rare in the
Taurus&mdash;a stocky, strongly built man whose head would come no
higher than Cormac's shoulder. Even as he ate, he wore a helmet
with a lacquered leather drop, and Cormac caught the glint of mail
beneath his sheepskins; through his girdle was thrust a short
wide-bladed sword, not curved as much as the Moslem scimitars. His
powerful bowed legs, as well as the slanting black eyes set in an
inscrutable brown face, betrayed the Mongol.</p>

<p>He, like Cormac, was a newcomer; riding from the east he had
arrived at Bab-el-Shaitan that night at the same time that the
Irish warrior had ridden in from the south. His name, as given in
guttural Turki, was Toghrul Khan.</p>

<p>A slave whose scarred face and fear-dulled eyes told of the
brutality of his masters, tremblingly filled Cormac's goblet. He
started and flinched as a sudden scream faintly knifed the din; it
came from somewhere above, and none of the feasters paid any
attention. The Norman-Gael wondered at the absence of women-slaves.
Skol Abdhur's name was a terror in that part of Asia and many
caravans felt the weight of his fury. Many women had been stolen
from raided villages and camel-trains, yet now there were
apparently only men in Bab-el- Shaitan. This, to Cormac, held a
sinister implication. He recalled dark tales, whispered under the
breath, relating to the cryptic inhumanness of the robber
chief&mdash;mysterious hints of foul rites in black caverns, of
naked white victims writhing on hideously ancient altars, of
blood-chilling sacrifices beneath the midnight moon. But that cry
had been no woman's scream.</p>

<p>Kai Shah was close to di Strozza's shoulder, talking very
rapidly in a guarded tone. Cormac saw that Nadir Tous was only
pretending to be absorbed in his wine cup; the Persian's eyes,
burning with intensity, were fixed on the two who whispered at the
head of the table. Cormac, alert to intrigue and counter- plot, had
already decided that there were factions in Bab-el-Shaitan. He had
noticed that di Strozza, Kai Shah, a lean Syrian scribe named Musa
bin Daoud, and the wolfish Lur, Kadra Muhammad, stayed close to
each other, while Nadir Tous had his own following among the lesser
bandits, wild ruffians, mostly Persians and Armenians, and Kojar
Mirza was surrounded by a number of even wilder mountain Kurds. The
manner of the Venetian and Nadir Tous toward each other was of a
wary courtesy that seemed to mask suspicion, while the Kurdish
chief wore an aspect of truculent defiance toward both.</p>

<p>As these thoughts passed through Cormac's mind, an incongruous
figure appeared on the landing of the broad stairs. It was Jacob,
Skol Abdhur's majordomo&mdash;a short, very fat Jew attired in
gaudy and costly robes which had once decked a Syrian harem master.
All eyes turned toward him, for it was evident he had brought word
from his master&mdash;not often did Skol Abdhur, wary as a hunted
wolf, join his pack at their feasts.</p>

<p>"The great prince, Skol Abdhur," announced Jacob in pompous and
sonorous accents, "would grant audience to the Nazarene who rode in
at dusk&mdash;the lord Cormac FitzGeoffrey."</p>

<p>The Norman finished his goblet at draft and rose deliberately,
taking up his shield and helmet.</p>

<p>"And what of me, Yahouda?" It was the guttural voice of the
Mongol. "Has the great prince no word for Toghrul Khan, who has
ridden far and hard to join his horde? Has he said naught of an
audience with me?"</p>

<p>The Jew scowled. "Lord Skol said naught of any Tartar," he
answered shortly. "Wait until he sends for you, as he will
do&mdash;if it so pleases him."</p>

<p>The answer was as much an insult to the haughty pagan as would
have been a slap in the face. He half-made to rise then sank back,
his face, schooled to iron control, showing little of his rage. But
his serpent-like eyes glittering devilishly, took in not only the
Jew but Cormac as well, and the Norman knew that he himself was
included in Toghrul Khan's black anger. Mongol pride and Mongol
wrath are beyond the ken of the Western mind, but Cormac knew that
in his humiliation, the nomad hated him as much as he hated
Jacob.</p>

<p>But Cormac could count his friends on his fingers and his
personal enemies by the scores. A few more foes made little
difference and he paid no heed to Toghrul Khan as he followed the
Jew up the broad stairs, and along a winding corridor to a heavy,
metal-braced door before which stood, like an image carven of black
basalt, a huge naked Nubian who held a two-handed scimitar whose
five-foot blade was a foot wide at the tip.</p>

<p>Jacob made a sign to the Nubian, but Cormac saw that the Jew was
trembling and apprehensive.</p>

<p>"In God's name," Jacob whispered to the Norman, "speak him
softly; Skol is in a devilish temper tonight. Only a little while
ago he tore out the eyeball of a slave with his hands."</p>

<p>"That was that scream I heard then," grunted Cormac. "Well,
don't stand there chattering; tell that black beast to open the
door before I knock it down."</p>

<p>Jacob blenched; but it was no idle threat. It was not the
Norman-Gael's nature to wait meekly at the door of any man&mdash;he
who had been cup- companion to King Richard. The majordomo spoke
swiftly to the mute, who swung the door open. Cormac pushed past
his guide and strode across the threshold.</p>

<p>And for the first time he looked on Skol Abdhur the Butcher,
whose deeds of blood had already made him a semi-mythical figure.
The Norman saw a bizarre giant reclining on a silken divan, in the
midst of a room hung and furnished like a king's. Erect, Skol would
have towered half a head taller than Cormac, and though a huge
belly marred the symmetry of his figure, he was still an image of
physical prowess. His short, naturally black beard had been stained
to a bluish tint; his wide black eyes blazed with a curious wayward
look not altogether sane at times.</p>

<p>He was clad in cloth-of-gold slippers whose toes turned up
extravagantly, in voluminous Persian trousers of rare silk, and a
wide green silken sash, heavy with golden scales, was wrapt about
his waist. Above this he wore a sleeveless jacket, richly brocaded,
open in front, but beneath this his huge torso was naked. His
blue-black hair, held by a gemmed circlet of gold, fell to his
shoulders, and his fingers were gleaming with jewels, while his
bare arms were weighted with heavy gem-crusted armlets. Women's
earrings adorned his ears.</p>

<p>Altogether his appearance was of such fantastic barbarism as to
inspire in Cormac an amazement which in an ordinary man would have
been a feeling of utmost horror. The apparent savagery of the
giant, together with his fantastic finery which heightened rather
than lessened the terror of his appearance, lent Skol Abdhur an
aspect which set him outside the pale of ordinary humanity. The
effect of an ordinary man, so garbed, would have been merely
ludicrous; in the robber chieftain it was one of horror.</p>

<p>Yet as Jacob salaamed to the floor in a very frenzy of
obeisance, he was not sure that Skol looked any more formidable
than the mail-clad Frank with his aspect of dynamic and terrible
strength directed by a tigerish nature.</p>

<p>"The lord Cormac FitzGeoffrey, oh mighty prince," proclaimed
Jacob, while Cormac stood like an iron image not deigning even to
incline his lion-like head.</p>

<p>"Yes, fool, I can see that," Skol's voice was deep and resonant.
"Take yourself hence before I crop your ears. And see that those
fools downstairs have plenty of wine."</p>

<p>From the stumbling haste with which Jacob obeyed, Cormac knew
the threat of cropping ears was no empty one. Now his eyes wandered
to a shocking and pitiful figure&mdash;the slave standing behind
Skol's divan ready to pour wine for his grim master. The wretch was
trembling in every limb as a wounded horse quivers, and the reason
was apparent&mdash;a ghastly gaping socket from which the eye had
been ruthlessly ripped. Blood still oozed from the rim to join the
stains which blotched the twisted face and spotted the silken
garments. Pitiful finery! Skol dressed his miserable slaves in
apparel rich merchants might envy. And the wretch stood shivering
in agony, yet not daring to move from his tracks, though with the
pain-misted half-sight remaining him, he could scarcely see to fill
the gem-crusted goblet Skol lifted.</p>

<p>"Come and sit on the divan with me, Cormac," hailed Skol. "I
would speak to you. Dog! Fill the lord Frank's goblet, and haste,
lest I take your other eye."</p>

<p>"I drink no more this night," growled Cormac, thrusting aside
the goblet Skol held out to him. "And send that slave away. He'll
spill wine on you in his blindness."</p>

<p>Skol stared at Cormac a moment and then with a sudden laugh
waved the pain-sick slave toward the door. The man went hastily,
whimpering in agony.</p>

<p>"See," said Skol, "I humor your whim. But it was not necessary.
I would have wrung his neck after we had talked, so he could not
repeat our words."</p>

<p>Cormac shrugged his shoulders. Little use to try to explain to
Skol that it was pity for the slave and not desire for secrecy that
prompted him to have the man dismissed.</p>

<p>"What think you of my kingdom, Bab-el-Shaitan?" asked Skol
suddenly.</p>

<p>"It would be hard to take," answered the Norman.</p>

<p>Skol laughed wildly and emptied his goblet.</p>

<p>"So the Seljuks have found," he hiccupped. "I took it years ago
by a trick from the Turk who held it. Before the Turks came the
Arabs held it and before them&mdash;the devil knows. It is
old&mdash;the foundations were built in the long ago by Iskander
Akbar&mdash;Alexander the Great. Then centuries later came the
Roumi&mdash;the Romans&mdash;who added to it. Parthians, Persians,
Kurds, Arabs, Turks&mdash;all have shed blood on its walls. Now it
is mine, and while I live, mine it shall remain! I know its
secrets&mdash;and its secrets," he cast the Frank a sly and wicked
glance full of sinister meaning, "are more than most men
reckon&mdash;even those fools Nadir Tous and di Strozza, who would
cut my throat if they dared."</p>

<p>"How do you hold supremacy over these wolves?" asked Cormac
bluntly.</p>

<p>Skol laughed and drank once more.</p>

<p>"I have something each wishes. They hate each other; I play them
against one another. I hold the key to the plot. They do not trust
each other enough to move against me. I am Skol Abdhur! Men are
puppets to dance on my strings. And women"&mdash;a vagrant and
curious glint stole into his eyes&mdash;"women are food for the
gods," he said strangely.</p>

<p>"Many men serve me," said Skol Abdhur, "emirs and generals and
chiefs, as you saw. How came they here to Bab-el-Shaitan where the
world ends?
Ambition&mdash;intrigues&mdash;women&mdash;jealousy&mdash;hatred&mdash;now
they serve the Butcher. And what brought you here, my brother? That
you are an outlaw I know&mdash;that your life is forfeit to your
people because you slew a certain emir of the Franks, one Count
Conrad von Gonler. But only when hope is dead do men ride to
Bab-el-Shaitan. There are cycles within cycles, outlaws beyond the
pale of outlawry, and Bab-el-Shaitan is the end of the world."</p>

<p>"Well," growled Cormac, "one man can not raid the caravans. My
friend Sir Rupert de Vaile, Seneschal of Antioch, is captive to the
Turkish chief Ali Bahadur, and the Turk refuses to ransom him for
the gold that has been offered. You ride far, and fall on the
caravans that bring the treasures of Hind and Cathay. With you I
may find some treasure so rare that the Turk will accept it as a
ransom. If not, with my share of the loot I will hire enough bold
rogues to rescue Sir Rupert."</p>

<p>Skol shrugged his shoulders. "Franks are mad," said he, "but
whatever the reason, I am glad you rode hither. I have heard you
are faithful to the lord you follow, and I need such a man. Just
now I trust no one but Abdullah, the black mute that guards my
chamber."</p>

<p>It was evident to Cormac that Skol was fast becoming drunk.
Suddenly he laughed wildly.</p>

<p>"You asked me how I hold my wolves in leash? Not one but would
slit my throat. But look&mdash;so far I trust you I will show you
why they do not!"</p>

<p>He reached into his girdle and drew forth a huge jewel which
sparkled like a tiny lake of blood in his great palm. Even Cormac's
eyes narrowed at the sight.</p>

<p>"Satan!" he muttered. "That can be naught but the ruby
called&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Blood of Belshazzar!" exclaimed Skol Abdhur. "Aye, the gem
Cyrus the Persian ripped from the sword-gashed bosom of the great
king on that red night when Babylon fell! It is the most ancient
and costly gem in the world. Ten thousand pieces of heavy gold
could not buy it.</p>

<p>"Hark, Frank," again Skol drained a goblet, "I will tell you the
tale of the Blood of Belshazzar. See you how strangely it is
carved?"</p>

<p>He held it up and the light flashed redly from its many facets.
Cormac shook his head, puzzled.</p>

<p>The carving was strange indeed, corresponding to nothing he had
ever seen, east or west. It seemed that the ancient carver had
followed some plan entirely unknown and apart from that of modern
lapidary art. It was basically <i>different</i> with a difference
Cormac could not define.</p>

<p>"No mortal cut that stone!" said Skol, "but the djinn of the
sea! For once in the long, long ago, in the very dawn of
happenings, the great king, even Belshazzar, went from his palace
on pleasure bent and coming to the Green Sea&mdash;the Persian
Gulf&mdash;went thereon in a royal galley, golden- prowed and rowed
by a hundred slaves. Now there was one Naka, a diver of pearls, who
desiring greatly to honor his king, begged the royal permission to
seek the ocean bottom for rare pearls for the king, and Belshazzar
granting his wish, Naka dived. Inspired by the glory of the king,
he went far beyond the depth of divers, and after a time floated to
the surface, grasping in his hand a ruby of rare beauty&mdash;aye,
this very gem.</p>

<p>"Then the king and his lords, gazing on its strange carvings,
were amazed, and Naka, nigh to death because of the great depth to
which he had gone, gasped out a strange tale of a silent,
seaweed-festooned city of marble and lapis lazuli far below the
surface of the sea, and of a monstrous mummied king on a jade
throne from whose dead taloned hand Naka had wrested the ruby. And
then the blood burst from the diver's mouth and ears and he
died.</p>

<p>"Then Belshazzar's lords entreated him to throw the gem back
into the sea, for it was evident that it was the treasure of the
djinn of the sea, but the king was as one mad, gazing into the
crimson deeps of the ruby, and he shook his head.</p>

<p>"And lo, soon evil came upon him, for the Persians broke his
kingdom, and Cyrus, looting the dying monarch, wrested from his
bosom the great ruby which seemed so gory in the light of the
burning palace that the soldiers shouted: 'Lo, it is the heart's
blood of Belshazzar!' And so men came to call the gem the Blood of
Belshazzar.</p>

<p>"Blood followed its course. When Cyrus fell on the Jaxartes,
Queen Tomyris seized the jewel and for a time it gleamed on the
naked bosom of the Scythian queen. But she was despoiled of it by a
rebel general; in a battle against the Persians he fell and it went
into the hands of Cambyses, who carried it with him into Egypt,
where a priest of Bast stole it. A Numidian mercenary murdered him
for it, and by devious ways it came back to Persia once more. It
gleamed on Xerxes' crown when he watched his army destroyed at
Salamis.</p>

<p>"Alexander took it from the corpse of Darius and on the
Macedonian's corselet its gleams lighted the road to India. A
chance sword blow struck it from his breastplate in a battle on the
Indus and for centuries the Blood of Belshazzar was lost to sight.
Somewhere far to the east, we know, its gleams shone on a road of
blood and rapine, and men slew men and dishonored women for it. For
it, as of old, women gave up their virtue, men their lives and
kings their crowns.</p>

<p>"But at last its road turned to the west once more, and I took
it from the body of a Turkoman chief I slew in a raid far to the
east. How he came by it, I do not know. But now it is mine!"</p>

<p>Skol was drunk; his eyes blazed with inhuman passion; more and
more he seemed like some foul bird of prey.</p>

<p>"It is my balance of power! Men come to me from palace and
hovel, each hoping to have the Blood of Belshazzar for his own. I
play them against each other. If one should slay me for it, the
others would instantly cut him to pieces to gain it. They distrust
each other too much to combine against me. And who would share the
gem with another?"</p>

<p>He poured himself wine with an unsteady hand.</p>

<p>"I am Skol the Butcher!" he boasted, "a prince in my own right!
I am powerful and crafty beyond the knowledge of common men. For I
am the most feared chieftain in all the Taurus, I who was dirt
beneath men's feet, the disowned and despised son of a renegade
Persian noble and a Circassian slave- girl.</p>

<p>"Bah&mdash;these fools who plot against me&mdash;the Venetian,
Kai Shah, Musa bin Daoud and Kadra Muhammad&mdash;over against them
I play Nadir Tous, that polished cutthroat, and Kojar Mirza. The
Persian and the Kurd hate me and they hate di Strozza, but they
hate each other even more. And Shalmar Khor hates them all."</p>

<p>"And what of Seosamh el Mekru?" Cormac could not twist his
Norman-Celtic tongue to the Arabic of Joseph.</p>

<p>"Who knows what is in an Arab's mind?" growled Skol. "But you
may be certain he is a jackal for loot, like all his kind, and will
watch which way the feather falls, to join the stronger
side&mdash;and then betray the winners.</p>

<p>"But I care not!" the robber roared suddenly. "I am Skol the
Butcher! Deep in the deeps of the Blood have I seen misty,
monstrous shapes and read dark secrets! Aye&mdash;in my sleep I
hear the whispers of that dead, half- human king from whom Naka the
diver tore the jewel so long ago. Blood! That is a drink the ruby
craves! Blood follows it; blood is drawn to it! Not the head of
Cyrus did Queen Tomyris plunge into a vessel of warm blood as the
legends say, but the gem she took from the dead king! He who wears
it must quench its thirst or it will drink his own blood! Aye, the
heart's flow of kings and queens have gone into its crimson
shadow!</p>

<p>"And I have quenched its thirst! There are secrets of
Bab-el-Shaitan none knows but I&mdash;and Abdullah whose withered
tongue can never speak of the sights he has looked upon, the
shrieks his ears have heard in the blackness below the castle when
midnight holds the mountains breathless. For I have broken into
secret corridors, sealed up by the Arabs who rebuilt the hold, and
unknown to the Turks who followed them."</p>

<p>He checked himself as if he had said too much. But the crimson
dreams began to weave again their pattern of insanity.</p>

<p>"You have wondered why you see no women here? Yet hundreds of
fair girls have passed through the portals of Bab-el-Shaitan. Where
are they now? Ha ha ha!" the giant's sudden roar of ghastly
laughter thundered in the room.</p>

<p>"Many went to quench the ruby's thirst," said Skol, reaching for
the wine jug, "or to become the brides of the Dead, the concubines
of ancient demons of the mountains and deserts, who take fair girls
only in death throes. Some I or my warriors merely wearied of, and
they were flung to the vultures."</p>

<p>Cormac sat, chin on mailed fist, his dark brows lowering in
disgust.</p>

<p>"Ha!" laughed the robber. "You do not laugh&mdash;are you
thin-skinned, lord Frank? I have heard you spoken of as a desperate
man. Wait until you have ridden with me for a few moons! Not for
nothing am I named the Butcher! I have built a pyramid of skulls in
my day! I have severed the necks of old men and old women, I have
dashed out the brains of babes, I have ripped up women, I have
burned children alive and sat them by scores on pointed stakes!
Pour me wine, Frank."</p>

<p>"Pour your own damned wine," growled Cormac, his lip writhing
back dangerously.</p>

<p>"That would cost another man his head," said Skol, reaching for
his goblet. "You are rude of speech to your host and the man you
have ridden so far to serve. Take care&mdash;rouse me not." Again
he laughed his horrible laughter.</p>

<p>"These walls have re-echoed to screams of direst agony!" his
eyes began to burn with a reckless and maddened light. "With these
hands have I disemboweled men, torn out the tongues of children and
ripped out the eyeballs of girls&mdash;thus!"</p>

<p>With a shriek of crazed laughter his huge hand shot at Cormac's
face. With an oath the Norman caught the giant's wrist and bones
creaked in that iron grip. Twisting the arm viciously down and
aside with a force that nearly tore it from its socket, Cormac
flung Skol back on the divan.</p>

<p>"Save your whims for your slaves, you drunken fool," the Norman
rasped.</p>

<p>Skol sprawled on the divan, grinning like an idiotic ogre and
trying to work his fingers which Cormac's savage grasp had numbed.
The Norman rose and strode from the chamber in fierce disgust; his
last backward glance showed Skol fumbling with the wine jug, with
one hand still grasping the Blood of Belshazzar, which cast a
sinister light all over the room.</p>

<p>The door shut behind Cormac and the Nubian cast him a sidelong,
suspicious glance. The Norman shouted impatiently for Jacob, and
the Jew bobbed up suddenly and apprehensively. His face cleared
when Cormac brusquely demanded to be shown his chamber. As he
tramped along the bare, torch-lighted corridors, Cormac heard
sounds of revelry still going on below. Knives would be going
before morning, reflected Cormac, and some would not see the rising
of the sun. Yet the noises were neither as loud nor as varied as
they had been when he left the banquet hall; no doubt many were
already senseless from strong drink.</p>

<p>Jacob turned aside and opened a heavy door, his torch revealing
a small cell-like room, bare of hangings, with a sort of bunk on
one side; there was a single window, heavily barred, and but one
door. The Jew thrust the torch into a niche of the wall.</p>

<p>"Was the lord Skol pleased with you, my lord?" he asked
nervously.</p>

<p>Cormac cursed. "I rode over a hundred miles to join the most
powerful raider in the Taurus, and I find only a wine-bibbing,
drunken fool, fit only to howl bloody boasts and blasphemies to the
roof."</p>

<p>"Be careful, for God's sake, sir," Jacob shook from head to
foot. "These walls have ears! The great prince has these strange
moods, but he is a mighty fighter and a crafty man for all that. Do
not judge him in his drunkenness. Did&mdash;did&mdash;did he speak
aught of me?"</p>

<p>"Aye," answered Cormac at random, a whimsical grim humor
striking him. "He said you only served him in hopes of stealing his
ruby some day."</p>

<p>Jacob gasped as if Cormac had hit him in the belly and the
sudden pallor of his face told the Norman his chance shot had gone
home. The majordomo ducked out of the room like a scared rabbit and
it was in somewhat better humor that his tormentor turned to
retire.</p>

<p>Looking out the window, Cormac glanced down into the courtyard
where the animals were kept, at the stables wherein he had seen
that his great black stallion had been placed. Satisfied that the
steed was well sheltered for the night, he lay down on the bunk in
full armor, with his shield, helmet and sword beside him, as he was
wont to sleep in strange holds. He had barred the door from within,
but he put little trust in bolts and bars.</p>
<br>
<br>

<h2><a id="belshazzar2" name="belshazzar2">CHAPTER II</a>
</h2>

<p style="text-indent:0">CORMAC had been asleep less than an hour
when a sudden sound brought him wide awake and alert. It was
utterly dark in the chamber; even his keen eyes could make out
nothing, but someone or something was moving on him in the
darkness. He thought of the evil reputation of Bab-el-Shaitan and a
momentary shiver shook him&mdash;not of fear but of superstitious
revulsion.</p>

<p>Then his practical mind asserted itself. It was that fool
Toghrul Khan who had slipped into his chamber to cleanse his
strange nomadic honor by murdering the man who had been given
priority over him. Cormac cautiously drew his legs about and lifted
his body until he was sitting on the side of the bunk. At the
rattle of his mail, the stealthy sounds ceased, but the Norman
could visualize Toghrul Khan's slant eyes glittering snake-like in
the dark. Doubtless he had already slit the throat of Jacob the
Jew.</p>

<p>As quietly as possible, Cormac eased the heavy sword from its
scabbard. Then as the sinister sounds recommenced, he tensed
himself, made a swift estimate of location, and leaped like a huge
tiger, smiting blindly and terribly in the dark. He had judged
correctly. He felt the sword strike solidly, crunching through
flesh and bone, and a body fell heavily in the darkness.</p>

<p>Feeling for flint and steel, he struck fire to tinder and
lighted the torch, then turning to the crumpled shape in the center
of the room, he halted in amazement. The man who lay there in a
widening pool of crimson was tall, powerfully built and hairy as an
ape&mdash;Kadra Muhammad. The Lur's scimitar was in his scabbard,
but a wicked dagger lay by his right hand.</p>

<p>"He had no quarrel with me," growled Cormac, puzzled.
"What&mdash;" He stopped again. The door was still bolted from
within, but in what had been a blank wall to the casual gaze, a
black opening gaped&mdash;a secret doorway through which Kadra
Muhammad had come. Cormac closed it and with sudden purpose pulled
his coif in place and donned his helmet. Then taking up his shield,
he opened the door and strode forth into the torch-lighted
corridor. All was silence, broken only by the tramp of his
iron-clad feet on the bare flags. The sounds of revelry had ceased
and a ghostly stillness hung over Bab-el- Shaitan.</p>

<p>In a few minutes he stood before the door of Skol Abdhur's
chamber and saw there what he had half-expected. The Nubian
Abdullah lay before the threshold, disemboweled, and his woolly
head half severed from his body. Cormac thrust open the door; the
candles still burned. On the floor, in the blood- soaked ruins of
the torn divan lay the gashed and naked body of Skol Abdhur the
Butcher. The corpse was slashed and hacked horribly, but it was
evident to Cormac that Skol had died in drunken sleep with no
chance to fight for his life. It was some obscure hysteria or
frantic hatred that had led his slayer or slayers to so disfigure
his dead body. His garments lay near him; they had been ripped to
shreds. The Norman-Celt smiled grimply to himself, nodding. smiled
grimly, nodding.</p>

<p>"So the Blood of Belshazzar drank your life at last, Skol," said
he.</p>

<p>Turning toward the doorway he again scanned the body of the
Nubian.</p>

<p>"More than one slew these men," he muttered, "and the Nubian
gave scathe to one, at least."</p>

<p>The black still gripped his great scimitar, and the edge was
nicked and bloodstained.</p>

<p>At that moment a quick rattle of steps sounded on the flags and
the affrighted face of Jacob peered in at the door. His eyes flared
wide and he opened his mouth to the widest extent to give vent to
an ear-piercing screech.</p>

<p>"Shut up, you fool," snarled Cormac disgusted, but Jacob
gibbered wildly.</p>

<p>"Spare my life, most noble lord! I will not tell anyone that you
slew Skol&mdash;I swear&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be quiet, Jew," growled Cormac. "I did not slay Skol and I will
not harm you."</p>

<p>This somewhat reassured Jacob, whose eyes narrowed with sudden
avarice.</p>

<p>"Have you found the gem?" he chattered, running into the
chamber. "Swift, let us search for it and begone&mdash;I should not
have shrieked but I feared the noble lord would slay me&mdash;yet
perchance it was not heard&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was heard," growled the Norman. "And here are the
warriors."</p>

<p>The tramp of many hurried feet was heard and a second later the
door was thronged with bearded faces. Cormac noted the men blinked
and gaped like owls, more like men roused from deep sleep than
drunken men. Bleary-eyed, they gripped their weapons and ogled, a
ragged, bemused horde. Jacob shrank back, trying to flatten himself
against the wall, while Cormac faced them, bloodstained sword still
in his hand.</p>

<p>"Allah!" ejaculated a Kurd, rubbing his eyes. "The Frank and the
Jew have murdered Skol!"</p>

<p>"A lie," growled Cormac menacingly. "I know not who slew this
drunkard."</p>

<p>Tisolino di Strozza came into the chamber, followed by the other
chiefs. Cormac saw Nadir Tous, Kojar Mirza, Shalmar Khor, Yussef el
Mekru and Justus Zenor. Toghrul Khan, Kai Shah and Musa bin Daoud
were nowhere in evidence, and where Kadra Muhammad was, the Norman
well knew.</p>

<p>"The jewel!" exclaimed an Armenian excitedly. "Let us look for
the gem!"</p>

<p>"Be quiet, fool," snapped Nadir Tous, a light of baffled fury
growing in his eyes. "Skol has been stripped; be sure who slew him
took the gem."</p>

<p>All eyes turned toward Cormac.</p>

<p>"Skol was a hard master," said Tisolino. "Give us the jewel,
lord Cormac, and you may go your way in peace."</p>

<p>Cormac swore angrily; had not, he thought, even as he replied,
the Venetian's eyes widened when they first fell on him?</p>

<p>"I have not your cursed jewel; Skol was dead when I came to his
room."</p>

<p>"Aye," jeered Kojar Mirza, "and blood still wet on your blade."
He pointed accusingly at the weapon in Cormac's hand, whose blue
steel, traced with Norse runes, was stained a dull red.</p>

<p>"That is the blood of Kadra Muhammad," growled Cormac, "who
stole into my cell to slay me and whose corpse now lies there."</p>

<p>His eyes were fixed with fierce intensity on di Strozza's face
but the Venetian's expression altered not a whit.</p>

<p>"I will go to the chamber and see if he speaks truth," said di
Strozza, and Nadir Tous smiled a deadly smile.</p>

<p>"You will remain here," said the Persian, and his ruffians
closed menacingly around the tall Venetian. "Go you, Selim." And
one of his men went grumbling. Di Strozza shot a swift glance of
terrible hatred and suppressed wrath at Nadir Tous, then stood
imperturbably; but Cormac knew that the Venetian was wild to escape
from that room.</p>

<p>"There have been strange things done tonight in Bab-el-Shaitan,"
growled Shalmar Khor. "Where are Kai Shah and the Syrian&mdash;and
that pagan from Tartary? And who drugged the wine?"</p>

<p>"Aye!" exclaimed Nadir Tous, "who drugged the wine which sent us
all into the sleep from which we but a few moments ago awakened?
And how is it that you, di Strozza, were awake when the rest of us
slept?"</p>

<p>"I have told you, I drank the wine and fell asleep like the rest
of you," answered the Venetian coldly. "I awoke a few moments
earlier, that is all, and was going to my chamber when the horde of
you came along."</p>

<p>"Mayhap," answered Nadir Tous, "but we had to put a scimitar
edge to your throat before you would come with us."</p>

<p>"Why did you wish to come to Skol's chamber anyway?" countered
di Strozza.</p>

<p>"Why," answered the Persian, "when we awoke and realized we had
been drugged, Shalmar Khor suggested that we go to Skol's chamber
and see if he had flown with the jewel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You lie!" exclaimed the Circassian. "That was Kojar Mirza who
said that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why this delay and argument!" cried Kojar Mirza. "We know this
Frank was the last to be admitted to Skol this night. There is
blood on his blade&mdash;we found him standing above the slain! Cut
him down!"</p>

<p>And drawing his scimitar he stepped forward, his warriors
surging in behind him. Cormac placed his back to the wall and
braced his feet to meet the charge. But it did not come; the tense
figure of the giant Norman-Gael was so fraught with brooding
menace, the eyes glaring so terribly above the skull- adorned
shield, that even the wild Kurd faltered and hesitated, though a
score of men thronged the room and many more than that number
swarmed in the corridor outside. And as he wavered the Persian
Selim elbowed his way through the band, shouting: "The Frank spoke
truth! Kadra Muhammad lies dead in the lord Cormac's chamber!"</p>

<p>"That proves nothing," said the Venetian quietly. "He might have
slain Skol after he slew the Lur."</p>

<p>An uneasy and bristling silence reigned for an instant. Cormac
noted that now Skol lay dead, the different factions made no
attempt to conceal their differences. Nadir Tous, Kojar Mirza and
Shalmar Khor stood apart from each other and their followers
bunched behind them in glaring, weapon-thumbing groups. Yussef el
Mekru and Justus Zehor stood aside, looking undecided; only di
Strozza seemed oblivious to this cleavage of the robber band.</p>

<p>The Venetian was about to say more, when another figure
shouldered men aside and strode in. It was the Seljuk, Kai Shah,
and Cormac noted that he lacked his mail shirt and that his
garments were different from those he had worn earlier in the
night. More, his left arm was bandaged and bound close to his chest
and his dark face was somewhat pale.</p>

<p>At the sight of him di Strozza's calm for the first time
deserted him; he started violently.</p>

<p>"Where is Musa bin Daoud?" he exclaimed, and the Turk echoed him
angrily.</p>

<p>"Aye! Where is Musa bin Daoud?"</p>

<p>"I left him with you!" cried di Strozza fiercely, while the
others gaped, not understanding this byplay.</p>

<p>"But you planned with him to elude me," accused the Seljuk.</p>

<p>"You are mad!" shouted di Strozza, losing his self-control
entirely.</p>

<p>"Mad?" snarled the Turk. "I have been searching for the dog
through the dark corridors. If you and he are acting in good faith,
why did you not return to the chamber, when you went forth to meet
Kadra Muhammad whom we heard coming along the corridor? When you
came not back I stepped to the door to peer out for you, and when I
turned back, Musa had darted through some secret opening like a
rat&mdash;"</p>

<p>Di Strozza almost frothed at the mouth. "You fool!" he screamed,
"keep silent!"</p>

<p>"I will see you in Gehennum and all our throats cut before I let
you cozen me!" roared the Turk, ripping out his scimitar. "What
have you done with Musa?"</p>

<p>"You fool of Hell," raved di Strozza, "I have been in this
chamber ever since I left you! You knew that Syrian dog would play
us false if he got the opportunity and&mdash;"</p>

<p>And at that instant when the air was already supercharged with
tension, a terrified slave rushed in at a blind, stumbling run, to
fall gibbering at di Strozza's feet.</p>

<p>"The gods!" he howled. "The black gods! Aie! The cavern under
the floors and the djinn in the rock!"</p>

<p>"What are you yammering about, dog?" roared the Venetian,
knocking the slave to the floor with an open-handed blow.</p>

<p>"I found the forbidden door open," screeched the fellow. "A
stair goes down&mdash;it leads into a fearful cavern with a
terrible altar on which frown gigantic demons&mdash;and at the foot
of the stairs&mdash;the lord Musa&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What!" di Strozza's eyes blazed and he shook the slave as a dog
shakes a rat.</p>

<p>"Dead!" gasped the wretch between chattering teeth.</p>

<p>Cursing terribly, di Strozza knocked men aside in his rush to
the door; with a vengeful howl Kai Shah pelted after him, slashing
right and left to clear a way. Men gave back from his flashing
blade, howling as the keen edge slit their skins. The Venetian and
his erstwhile comrade ran down the corridor, di Strozza dragging
the screaming slave after him, and the rest of the pack gave tongue
in rage and bewilderment and took after them. Cormac swore in
amazement and followed, determined to see the mad game through.</p>

<p>Down winding corridors di Strozza led the pack, down broad
stairs, until he came to a huge iron door that now swung open. Here
the horde hesitated.</p>

<p>"This is in truth the forbidden door," muttered an Armenian.
"The brand is on my back that Skol put there merely because I
lingered too long before it once."</p>

<p>"Aye," agreed a Persian. "It leads into places once sealed up by
the Arabs long ago. None but Skol ever passed through that
door&mdash;he and the Nubian and the captives who came not forth.
It is a haunt of devils."</p>

<p>Di Strozza snarled in disgust and strode through the doorway. He
had snatched a torch as he ran and he held this high in one hand.
Broad steps showed, leading downward, and cut out of solid rock.
They were on the lower floor of the castle; these steps led into
the bowels of the earth. As di Strozza strode down, dragging the
howling, naked slave, the high-held torch lighting the black stone
steps and casting long shadows into the darkness before them, the
Venetian looked like a demon dragging a soul into Hell.</p>

<p>Kai Shah was close behind him with his drawn scimitar, with
Nadir Tous and Kojar Mirza crowding him close. The ragged crew had,
with unaccustomed courtesy, drawn back to let the lord Cormac
through and now they followed, uneasily and casting apprehensive
glances to all sides.</p>

<p>Many carried torches, and as their light flowed into the depths
below a medley of affrighted yells went up. From the darkness huge
evil eyes glimmered and titanic shapes loomed vaguely in the gloom.
The mob wavered, ready to stampede, but di Strozza strode stolidly
downward and the pack called on Allah and followed. Now the light
showed a huge cavern in the center of which stood a black and
utterly abhorrent altar, hideously stained, and flanked with
grinning skulls laid out in strangely systematic lines. The
horrific figures were disclosed to be huge images, carved from the
solid rock of the cavern walls, strange, bestial, gigantic gods,
whose huge eyes of some glassy substance caught the torchlight.</p>

<p>The Celtic blood in Cormac sent a shiver down his spine.
Alexander built the foundations of this fortress? Bah&mdash;no
Grecian ever carved such gods as these. No; an aura of unspeakable
antiquity brooded over this grim cavern, as if the forbidden door
were a mystic threshold over which the adventurer stepped into an
elder world. No wonder mad dreams were here bred in the frenzied
brain of Skol Abdhur. These gods were grim vestiges of an older,
darker race than Roman or Hellene&mdash;a people long faded into
the gloom of antiquity. Phrygians&mdash;Lydians&mdash;Hittites? Or
some still more ancient, more abysmal people?</p>

<p>The age of Alexander was as dawn before these ancient figures,
yet doubtless he bowed to these gods, as he bowed to many gods
before his maddened brain made himself a deity.</p>

<p>At the foot of the stairs lay a crumpled shape&mdash;Musa bin
Daoud. His face was twisted in horror. A medley of shouts went up:
"The djinn have taken the Syrian! Let us begone! This is an evil
place!"</p>

<p>"Be silent, you fools!" roared Nadir Tous. "A mortal blade slew
Musa&mdash;see, he has been slashed through the breast and his
bones are broken. See how he lies. Someone slew him and flung him
down the stairs&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Persian's voice trailed off, as his gaze followed his own
pointing fingers. Musa's left arm was outstretched and his fingers
had been hacked away.</p>

<p>"He held something in that hand," whispered Nadir Tous. "So hard
he gripped it that his slayer was forced to cut off his fingers to
obtain it&mdash;"</p>

<p>Men thrust torches into niches on the wall and crowded nearer,
their superstitious fears forgotten.</p>

<p>"Aye!" exclaimed Cormac, having pieced together some of the bits
of the puzzle in his mind. "It was the gem! Musa and Kai Shah and
di Strozza killed Skol, and Musa had the gem. There was blood on
Abdullah's sword and Kai Shah has a broken arm&mdash;shattered by
the sweep of the Nubian's great scimitar. Whoever slew Musa has the
gem."</p>

<p>Di Strozza screamed like a wounded panther. He shook the
wretched slave.</p>

<p>"Dog, have you the gem?"</p>

<p>The slave began a frenzied denial, but his voice broke in a
ghastly gurgle as di Strozza, in a very fit of madness, jerked his
sword edge across the wretch's throat and flung the blood-spurting
body from him. The Venetian whirled on Kai Shah.</p>

<p>"You slew Musa!" he screamed. "He was with you last! You have
the gem!"</p>

<p>"You lie!" exclaimed the Turk, his dark face an ashy pallor.
"You slew him yourself&mdash;"</p>

<p>His words ended in a gasp as di Strozza, foaming at the mouth
and all sanity gone from his eyes, ran his sword straight through
the Turk's body. Kai Shah swayed like a sapling in the wind; then
as di Strozza withdrew the blade, the Seljuk hacked through the
Venetian's temple, and as Kai Shah reeled, dying on his feet but
clinging to life with the tenacity of the Turk, Nadir Tous leaped
like a panther and beneath his flashing scimitar Kai Shah dropped
dead across the dead Venetian.</p>

<p>Forgetting all else in his lust for the gem, Nadir Tous bent
over his victim, tearing at his garments&mdash;bent further as if
in a deep salaam and sank down on the dead men, his own skull split
to the teeth by Kojar Mirza's stroke. The Kurd bent to search the
Turk, but straightened swiftly to meet the attack of Shalmar Khor.
In an instant the scene was one of ravening madness, where men
hacked and slew and died blindly. The flickering torches lit the
scene, and Cormac, backing away toward the stairs, swore amazedly.
He had seen men go mad before, but this exceeded anything he had
ever witnessed.</p>

<p>Kojar Mirza slew Selim and wounded a Circassian, but Shalmar
Khor slashed through his arm-muscles, Justus Zehor ran in and
stabbed the Kurd in the ribs, and Kojar Mirza went down, snapping
like a dying wolf, to be hacked to pieces.</p>

<p>Justus Zehor and Yussef el Mekru seemed to have taken sides at
last; the Georgian had thrown in his lot with Shalmar Khor, while
the Arab rallied to him the Kurds and Turks. But besides these
loosely knit bands of rivals, various warriors, mainly the Persians
of Nadir Tous, raged through the strife, foaming at the mouth and
striking all impartially. In an instant a dozen men were down,
dying and trampled by the living. Justus Zehor fought with a long
knife in each hand and he wrought red havoc before he sank, skull
cleft, throat slashed and belly ripped up.</p>

<p>Even while they fought, the warriors had managed to tear to
shreds the clothing of Kai Shah and di Strozza. Finding naught
there, they howled like wolves and fell to their deadly work with
new frenzy. A madness was on them; each time a man fell, others
seized him, ripping his garments apart in search for the gem,
slashing at each other as they did so.</p>

<p>Cormac saw Jacob trying to steal to the stairs, and even as the
Norman decided to withdraw himself, a thought came to the brain of
Yussef el Mekru. Arab-like, the Yemenite had fought more coolly
than the others, and perhaps he had, even in the frenzy of combat,
decided on his own interests. Possibly, seeing that all the leaders
were down except Shalmar Khor, he decided it would be best to
reunite the band, if possible, and it could be best done by
directing their attention against a common foe. Perhaps he honestly
thought that since the gem had not been found, Cormac had it. At
any rate, the Sheikh suddenly tore away and pointing a lean arm
toward the giant figure at the foot of the stairs, screamed:</p>

<p><i>"Allahu akbar!"</i>
</p>

<p>It was good Moslem psychology. There was an instant of
bewildered pause in the battle, then a bloodthirsty howl went up
and from a tangled battle of rival factions, the brawl became
instantly a charge of a solid compact body that rushed wild-eyed on
Cormac howling: "Slay the Caphar!"</p>

<p>Cormac snarled in disgusted irritation. He should have
anticipated that. No time to escape now; he braced himself and met
the charge. A Kurd, rushing in headlong, was impaled on the
Norman's long blade, and a giant Circassian, hurling his full
weight on the kite-shaped shield, rebounded as from an iron tower.
Cormac thundered his battle cry, <i>"Cloigeand abu,"</i> (Gaelic:
"The skull to victory.") in a deep-toned roar that drowned the
howls of the Moslems; he freed his blade and swung the heavy weapon
in a crashing arc. Swords shivered to singing sparks and the
warriors gave back. They plunged on again as Yussef el Mekru lashed
them with burning words. A big Armenian broke his sword on Cormac's
helmet and went down with his skull split. A Turk slashed at the
Norman's face and howled as his wrist was caught on the Norse
sword, and the hand flew from it.</p>

<p>Cormac's defense was his armor, the unshakable immovability of
his stance, and his crashing blows. Head bent, eyes glaring above
the rim of his shield, he made scant effort to parry or avoid
blows. He took them on his helmet or his shield and struck back
with thunderous power. Now Shalmar Khor smote full on his helmet
with every ounce of his great rangy body behind the blow, and the
scimitar bit through the steel cap, notching on the coif links
beneath. It was a blow that might have felled an ox, yet Cormac,
though half- stunned, stood like a man of iron and struck back with
all the power of arm and shoulders. The Circassian flung up his
round buckler but it availed not. Cormac's heavy sword sheared
through the buckler, severed the arm that held it and crashed full
on the Circassian's helmet, shattering both steel cap and the skull
beneath.</p>

<p>But fired by fanatical fury as well as greed, the Moslems
pressed in. They got behind him. Cormac staggered as a heavy weight
landed full on his shoulders. A Kurd had stolen up the stairs and
leaped from them full on to the Frank's back. Now he clung like an
ape, slavering curses and hacking wildly at Cormac's neck with his
long knife.</p>

<p>The Norman's sword was wedged deep in a split breastbone and he
struggled fiercely to free it. His hood was saving him so far from
the knife strokes of the man on his back, but men were hacking at
him from all sides and Yussef el Mekru, foam on his beard, was
rushing upon him. Cormac drove his shield upward, catching a
frothing Moslem under the chin with the rim and shattering his
jawbone, and almost at the same instant the Norman bent his
helmeted head forward and jerked it back with all the strength of
his mighty neck, and the back of his helmet crushed the face of the
Kurd on his back. Cormac felt the clutching arms relax; his sword
was free, but a Lur was clinging to his right arm&mdash;they hemmed
him in so he could not step back, and Yussef el Mekru was hacking
at his face and throat. He set his teeth and lifted his sword-arm,
swinging the clinging Lur clear of the floor. Yussef's scimitar
rasped on his bent helmet&mdash;his hauberk&mdash;his coif
links&mdash;the Arab's swordplay was like the flickering of light
and in a moment it was inevitable that the flaming blade would sink
home. And still the Lur clung, ape-like, to Cormac's mighty
arm.</p>

<p>Something whispered across the Norman's shoulder and thudded
solidly. Yussef el Mekru gasped and swayed, clawing at the thick
shaft that protruded from his heavy beard. Blood burst from his
parted lips and he fell dying. The man clinging to Cormac's arm
jerked convulsively and fell away. The press slackened. Cormac,
panting, stepped back and gained the stairs. A glance upward showed
him Toghrul Khan standing on the landing bending a heavy bow. The
Norman hesitated; at that range the Mongol could drive a shaft
through his mail.</p>

<p>"Haste, <i>bogatyr</i>," came the nomad's gutturals. "Up the
stairs!"</p>

<p>At that instant Jacob started running fleetly for the darkness
beyond the flickering torches; three steps he took before the bow
twanged. The Jew screamed and went down as though struck by a
giant's hand; the shaft had struck between his fat shoulders and
gone clear through him.</p>

<p>Cormac was backing warily up the stairs, facing his foes who
clustered at the foot of the steps, dazed and uncertain. Toghrul
Khan crouched on the landing, beady eyes a-glitter, shaft on
string, and men hesitated. But one dared&mdash;a tall Turkoman with
the eyes of a mad dog. Whether greed for the gem he thought Cormac
carried, or fanatical hate sent him leaping into the teeth of sword
and arrow, he sprang howling up the stairs, lifting high a heavy
iron-braced shield. Toghrul Khan loosed, but the shaft glanced from
the metal work, and Cormac, bracing his legs again, struck downward
with all his power. Sparks flashed as the down-crashing sword
shattered the shield and dashed the onrushing Turkoman headlong to
lie stunned and bloodied at the foot of the stairs.</p>

<p>Then as the warriors fingered their weapons undecidedly, Cormac
gained the landing, and Norman and Mongol backed together out of
the door which Toghrul Khan slammed behind them. A wild medley of
wolfish yells burst out from below and the Mongol, slamming a heavy
bolt in place, growled: "Swiftly, <i>bogatyr</i>! It will be some
minutes before those dog-brothers can batter down the door. Let us
begone!"</p>

<p>He led the way at a swift run along a corridor, through a series
of chambers, and flung open a barred door. Cormac saw that they had
come into the courtyard, flooded now by the gray light of dawn. A
man stood near, holding two horses&mdash;the great black stallion
of Cormac's and the Mongol's wiry roan. Leaning close Cormac saw
that the man's face was bandaged so that only one eye showed.</p>

<p>"Haste," Toghrul Khan was urging. "The slave saddled my mount,
but yours he could not saddle because of the savagery of the beast.
The serf is to go with us."</p>

<p>Cormac made haste to comply; then swinging into the saddle he
gave the fellow a hand and the slave sprang up behind him. The
strangely assorted companions thundered across the courtyard just
as raging figures burst through the doorway through which they had
come.</p>

<p>"No sentries at the gates this night," grunted the Mongol.</p>

<p>They pulled up at the wide gates and the slave sprang down to
open them. He swung the portals wide, took a single step toward the
black stallion and went down, dead before he struck the ground. A
crossbow bolt had shattered his skull, and Cormac, wheeling with a
curse, saw a Moslem kneeling on one of the bastions, aiming his
weapon. Even as he looked, Toghrul Khan rose in his stirrups, drew
a shaft to the head and loosed. The Moslem dropped his arbalest and
pitched headlong from the battlement.</p>

<p>With a fierce yell the Mongol wheeled away and charged through
the gates, Cormac close at his heels. Behind them sounded a wild
and wolfish babble as the warriors rushed about the courtyard,
seeking to find and saddle mounts.</p>
<br>
<br>

<h2><a id="belshazzar3" name="belshazzar3">CHAPTER III</a>
</h2>

<p style="text-indent:0">"LOOK!" The companions had covered some
miles of wild gorges and treacherous slopes, without hearing any
sound of pursuit. Toghrul Khan pointed back. The sun had risen in
the east, but behind them a red glow rivaled the sun.</p>

<p>"The Gate of Erlik burns," said the Mongol. "They will not hunt
us, those dog-brothers. They stopped to loot the castle and fight
one another; some fool has set the hold on fire."</p>

<p>"There is much I do not understand," said Cormac slowly. "Let us
sift truth from lies. That di Strozza, Kai Shah and Musa killed
Skol is evident, also that they sent Kadra Muhammad to slay
me&mdash;why, I know not. But I do not understand what Kai Shah
meant by saying that they heard Kadra Muhammad coming down the
corridor, and that di Strozza went forth to meet him, for surely at
that moment Kadra Muhammad lay dead on my chamber floor. And I
believe that both Kai Shah and the Venetian spoke truth when they
denied slaying Musa."</p>

<p>"Aye," acknowledged the Mongol. "Harken, lord Frank: scarcely
had you gone up to Skol's chamber last night, when Musa the scribe
left the banquet hall and soon returned with slaves who bore a
great bowl of spiced wine&mdash;prepared in the Syrian way, said
the scribe, and the steaming scent of it was pleasant.</p>

<p>"But I noted that neither he nor Kadra Muhammad drank of it, and
when Kai Shah and di Strozza plunged in their goblets, they only
pretended to drink. So when I raised my goblet to my lips, I
sniffed long and secretly and smelled therein a very rare
drug&mdash;aye, one I had thought was known only to the magicians
of Cathay. It makes deep sleep and Musa must have obtained a small
quantity in some raid on a caravan from the East. So I did not
drink of the wine, but all the others drank saving those I have
mentioned, and soon men began to grow drowsy, though the drug acted
slowly, being weak in that it was distributed among so many.</p>

<p>"Soon I went to my chamber which a slave showed me, and
squatting on my bunk, devised a plan of vengeance in my mind, for
because that dog of a Jew put shame upon me before the lords, hot
anger burned in my heart so that I could not sleep. Soon I heard
one staggering past my door as a drunkard staggers, but this one
whined like a dog in pain. I went forth and found a slave whose
eye, he said, his master had torn out. I have some knowledge of
wounds, so I cleansed and bandaged his empty socket, easing his
pain, for which he would have kissed my feet.</p>

<p>"Then I bethought me of the insult which had been put upon me,
and desired the slave to show me where slept the fat hog, Jacob. He
did so, and marking the chamber in my mind, I turned again and went
with the slave into the courtyard where the beasts were kept. None
hindered us, for all were in the feasting-hall and their din was
growing lesser swiftly. In the stables I found four swift horses,
ready saddled&mdash;the mounts of di Strozza and his comrades. And
the slave told me, furthermore, that there were no guards at the
gates that night&mdash;di Strozza had bidden all to feast in the
great hall. So I bade the slave saddle my steed and have it ready,
and also your black stallion which I coveted.</p>

<p>"Then I returned into the castle and heard no sound; all those
who had drunk of the wine slept in the sleep of the drug. I mounted
to the upper corridors, even to Jacob's chamber, but when I entered
to slit his fat throat, he was not sleeping there. I think he was
guzzling wine with the slaves in some lower part of the castle.</p>

<p>"I went along the corridors searching for him, and suddenly saw
ahead of me a chamber door partly open, through which shone light,
and I heard the voice of the Venetian speak: 'Kadra Muhammad is
approaching; I will bid him hasten.'</p>

<p>"I did not desire to meet these men, so I turned quickly down a
side corridor, hearing di Strozza call the name of Kadra Muhammad
softly and as if puzzled. Then he came swiftly down the corridor,
as if to see whose footfalls it was he heard, and I went hurriedly
before him, crossing the landing of a wide stair which led up from
the feasting-hall, and entered another corridor where I halted in
the shadows and watched.</p>

<p>"Di Strozza came to the landing and paused, like a man
bewildered, and at that moment an outcry went up from below. The
Venetian turned to escape but the waking drunkards had seen him.
Just as I had thought, the drug was too weak to keep them sleeping
long, and now they realized they had been drugged and stormed
bewilderedly up the stairs and laid hold on di Strozza, accusing
him of many things and making him accompany them to Skol's chamber.
Me they did not spy.</p>

<p>"Still seeking Jacob, I went swiftly down the corridor at random
and coming onto a narrow stairway, came at last to the ground floor
and a dark tunnel-like corridor which ran past a most strange door.
And then sounded quick footsteps and as I drew back in the shadows,
there came one in panting haste&mdash;the Syrian Musa, who gripped
a scimitar in his right hand and something hidden in his left.</p>

<p>"He fumbled with the door until it opened; then lifting his
head, he saw me and crying out wildly he slashed at me with his
scimitar. Erlik! I had no quarrel with the man, but he was as one
maddened by fear. I struck with the naked steel, and he, being
close to the landing inside the door, pitched headlong down the
stairs.</p>

<p>"Then I was desirous of learning what he held so tightly in his
left hand, so I followed him down the stairs. Erlik! That was an
evil place, dark and full of glaring eyes and strange shadows. The
hair on my head stood up but I gripped my steel, calling on the
Lords of Darkness and the high places. Musa's dead hand still
gripped what he held so firmly that I was forced to cut off the
fingers. Then I went back up the stairs and out the same way by
which we later escaped from the castle, and found the slave ready
with my mount, but unable to saddle yours.</p>

<p>"I was loath to depart without avenging my insult, and as I
lingered I heard the clash of steel within the hold. And I stole
back and came to the forbidden stair again while the fighting was
fiercest below. All were assailing you, and though my heart was hot
against you, because you had been given preference over me, I
warmed to your valor. Aye, you are a hero, <i>bogatyr</i>!"</p>

<p>"Then it was thus, apparently," mused the Frank, "di Strozza and
his comrades had it well planned out&mdash;they drugged the wine,
called the guards from the walls, and had their horses ready for
swift flight. As I had not drunk the drugged wine, they sent the
Lur to slay me. The other three killed Skol and in the fight Kai
Shah was wounded&mdash;Musa took the gem doubtless because neither
Kai Shah nor the Venetian would trust it to the other.</p>

<p>"After the murder, they must have retired into a chamber to
bandage Kai Shah's arm, and while there they heard you coming along
the corridor and thought it the Lur. Then when di Strozza followed
he was seized by the waking bandits, as you say&mdash;no wonder he
was wild to be gone from Skol's chamber! And meanwhile Musa gave
Kai Shah the slip somehow, meaning to have the gem for himself. But
what of the gem?"</p>

<p>"Look!" the nomad held out his hand in which a sinister crimson
glow throbbed and pulsed like a living thing in the early sun.</p>

<p>"The Blood of Belshazzar," said Toghrul Khan. "Greed for this
slew Skol and fear born of this evil thing slew Musa; for, escaping
from his comrades, he thought the hand of all men against him and
attacked me, when he could have gone on unmolested. Did he think to
remain hidden in the cavern until he could slip away, or does some
tunnel admit to outer air?</p>

<p>"Well, this red stone is evil&mdash;one can not eat it or drink
it or clothe himself with it, or use it as a weapon, yet many men
have died for it. Look&mdash;I will cast it away." The Mongol
turned to fling the gem over the verge of the dizzy precipice past
which they were riding. Cormac caught his arm.</p>

<p>"Nay&mdash;if you do not want it, let me have it."</p>

<p>"Willingly," but the Mongol frowned. "My brother would wear the
gaud?"</p>

<p>Cormac laughed shortly and Toghrul Khan smiled.</p>

<p>"I understand; you will buy favor from your sultan."</p>

<p>"Bah!" Cormac growled, "I buy favor with my sword. No." He
grinned, well pleased. "This trinket will pay the ransom of Sir
Rupert de Vaile to the chief who now holds him captive."</p>
