<h2><a id="tiberias1" name="tiberias1">CHAPTER 1</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE BATTLE in the meadowlands of the Euphrates was
over, but not the slaughter. On that bloody field where the Caliph
of Bagdad and his Turkish allies had broken the onrushing power of
Doubeys ibn Sadaka of Hilla and the desert, the steel-clad bodies
lay strewn like the drift of a storm. The great canal men called
the Nile, which connected the Euphrates with the distant Tigris,
was choked with the bodies of the tribesmen, and survivors were
panting in flight toward the white walls of Hilla which shimmered
in the distance above the placid waters of the nearer river.</p>

<p>Behind them the mailed hawks, the Seljuks, rode down the
fleeing, cutting the fugitives from their saddles. The glittering
dream of the Arab emir had ended in a storm of blood and steel, and
his spurs struck blood as he rode for the distant river.</p>

<p>Yet at one spot in the littered field the fight still swirled
and eddied, where the emir's favorite son, Achmet, a slender lad of
seventeen or eighteen, stood at bay with one companion. The mailed
riders swooped in, struck and reined back, yelling in baffled rage
before the lashing of the great sword in this man's hands.</p>

<p>His was a figure alien and incongruous, his red mane contrasting
with the black locks about him no less than his dusty gray mail
contrasted with the plumed burnished headpieces and silvered
hauberks of the slayers. He was tall and powerful, with a wolfish
hardness of limbs and frame that his mail could not conceal. His
dark, scarred face was moody, his blue eyes cold and hard as the
blue steel whereof Rhineland gnomes forge swords for heroes in
northern forests.</p>

<p>Little of softness had there been in John Norwald's life. Son of
a house ruined by the Norman conquest, this descendant of feudal
thanes had only memories of wattle-thatched huts and the hard life
of a man-at-arms, serving for poor hire barons he hated.</p>

<p>Born in north England, the ancient Danelagh, long settled by
blue-eyed vikings, his blood was neither Saxon nor Norman, but
Danish, and the grim unbreakable strength of the blue North was
his. From each stroke of life that felled him, he rose fiercer and
more unrelenting. He had not found existence easier in his long
drift East which led him into the service of Sir William de
Montserrat, seneschal of a castle on the frontier beyond
Jordan.</p>

<p>In all his thirty years, John Norwald remembered but one kindly
act, one deed of mercy; wherefore he now faced a whole host,
desperate fury nerving his iron arms.</p>

<p>It had been Achmet's first raid, whereby his riders had trapped
de Montserrat and a handful of retainers. The boy had not shrunk
from the swordplay, but the savagery that butchers fallen foes was
not his. Writhing in the bloody dust, stunned and half-dead, John
Norwald had dimly seen the lifted scimitar thrust aside by a
slender arm, and the face of the youth bending above him, the dark
eyes filled with tears of pity.</p>

<p>Too gentle for the age and his manner of life, Achmet had made
his astounded warriors take up the wounded Frank and bring him with
them. And in the weeks that passed while Norwald's wounds healed,
he lay in Achmet's tent by an oasis of the Asad tribes, tended by
the lad's own <i>hakim</i>. When he could ride again, Achmet had
brought him to Hilla. Doubeys ibn Sadaka always tried to humor his
son's whims, and now, though muttering pious horror in his beard,
he granted Norwald his life. Nor did he regret it, for in the grim
Englishman he found a fighting-man worth any three of his own
hawks.</p>

<p>John Norwald felt no tugging of loyalty toward de Montserrat,
who had fled out of the ambush leaving him in the hands of the
Moslems, nor toward the race at whose hands he had had only hard
knocks all his life. Among the Arabs he found an environment
congenial to his moody, ferocious nature, and he plunged into the
turmoil of desert feuds, forays and border wars as if he had been
born under a Bedouin black felt tent instead of a Yorkshire
thatch.</p>

<p>Now, with the failure of ibn Sadaka's thrust at Bagdad and
sovereignty, the Englishman found himself once more hemmed in by
chanting foes, mad with the tang of blood. About him and his
youthful comrade swirled the wild riders of Mosul; the mailed hawks
of Wasit and Bassorah, whose lord, Zenghi Imad ed din, had that day
out-maneuvered ibn Sadaka and slashed his shining host to
pieces.</p>

<p>On foot among the bodies of their warriors, their backs to a
wall of dead horses and men, Achmet and John Norwald beat back the
onslaught. A heron-feathered emir reined in his Turkoman steed,
yelling his war-cry, his house-troops swirling in behind him.</p>

<p>"Back, boy; leave him to me!" grunted the Englishman, thrusting
Achmet behind him. The slashing scimitar struck blue sparks from
his basinet and his great sword dashed the Seljuk dead from his
saddle. Bestriding the chieftain's body, the giant Frank lashed up
at the shrieking swordsmen who spurred in, leaning from their
saddles to swing their blades. The curved sabers shivered on his
shield and armor, and his long sword crashed through bucklers,
breastplates, and helmets, cleaving flesh and splintering bones,
littering corpses at his iron-sheathed feet. Panting and howling
the survivors reined back.</p>

<p>Then a roaring voice made them glance quickly about, and they
fell back as a tall, strongly built horseman rode through them and
drew rein before the grim Frank and his slender companion. John
Norwald for the first time stood face to face with Zenghi esh
Shami, Imad ed din, governor of Wasit and warden of Basorah, whom
men called the Lion of Tiberias, because of his exploits at the
siege of Tiberias.</p>

<p>The Englishman noted the breadth of the mighty steel-clad
shoulders, the grip of the powerful hands on rein and sword-hilt;
the blazing magnetic blue eyes, setting off the ruthless lines of
the dark face. Under the thin black lines of the mustaches the wide
lips smiled, but it was the merciless grin of the hunting
panther.</p>

<p>Zenghi spoke and there was at the back of his powerful voice a
hint of mockery or gargantuan mirth that rose above wrath and
slaughter.</p>

<p>"Who are these paladins that they stand among their prey like
tigers in their den, and none is found to go against them? Is it
Rustem whose heel is on the necks of my emirs&mdash;or only a
renegade Nazarene? And the other, by Allah, unless I am mad, it is
the cub of the desert wolf! Are you not Achmet ibn Doubeys?"</p>

<p>It was Achmet who answered; for Norwald maintained a grim
silence, watching the Turk through slit eyes, fingers locked on his
bloody hilt.</p>

<p>"It is so, Zenghi esh Shami," answered the youth proudly, "and
this is my brother at arms, John Norwald. Bid your wolves ride on,
oh prince. Many of them have fallen. More shall fall before their
steel tastes our hearts."</p>

<p>Zenghi shrugged his mighty shoulders, in the grip of the mocking
devil that lurks at the heart of all the sons of high Asia.</p>

<p>"Lay down your weapons, wolf-cub and Frank. I swear by the honor
of my clan, no sword shall touch you."</p>

<p>"I trust him not," growled John Norwald. "Let him come a pace
nearer and I'll take him to Hell with us."</p>

<p>"Nay," answered Achmet. "The prince keeps his word. Lay down
your sword, my brother. We have done all men might do. My father
the emir will ransom us."</p>

<p>He tossed down his scimitar with a boyish sigh of unashamed
relief, and Norwald grudgingly laid down his broadsword.</p>

<p>"I had rather sheathe it in his body," he growled.</p>

<p>Achmet turned to the conqueror and spread his hands.</p>

<p>"Oh, Zenghi&mdash;" he began, when the Turk made a quick
gesture, and the two prisoners found themselves seized and their
hands bound behind them with thongs that cut the flesh.</p>

<p>"There is no need of that, prince," protested Achmet. "We have
given ourselves into your hands. Bid your men loose us. We will not
seek to escape."</p>

<p>"Be silent, cub!" snapped Zenghi. The Turk's eyes still danced
with dangerous laughter, but his face was dark with passion. He
reined nearer.</p>

<p>"No sword shall touch you, young dog," he said deliberately.
"Such was my word, and I keep my oaths. No blade shall come near
you, yet the vultures shall pluck your bones tonight. Your dog-sire
escaped me, but you shall not escape, and when men tell him of your
end, he will tear his locks in anguish."</p>

<p>Achmet, held in the grip of the powerful soldiers, looked up,
paling, but answered without a quaver of fear.</p>

<p>"Are you then a breaker of oaths, Turk?"</p>

<p>"I break no oath," answered the lord of Wasit. "A whip is not a
sword."</p>

<p>His hand came up, gripping a terrible Turkoman scourge, to the
seven rawhide thongs of which bits of lead were fastened. Leaning
from his saddle as he struck, he brought those metal-weighted
thongs down across the boy's face with terrible force. Blood
spurted and one of Achmet's eyes was half torn from its socket.
Held helpless, the boy could not evade the blows Zenghi rained upon
him. But not a whimper escaped him, though his features turned to a
bloody, raw, ghastly and eyeless ruin beneath the ripping strokes
that shredded the flesh and splintered the bones beneath. Only at
last a low animal-like moaning drooled from his mangled lips as he
hung senseless and dying in the hands of his captors.</p>

<p>Without a cry or a word John Norwald watched, while the heart in
his breast shriveled and froze and turned to ice that naught could
touch or thaw or break. Something died in his soul and in its place
rose an elemental spirit unquenchable as frozen fire and bitter as
hoar-frost.</p>

<p>The deed was done. The mangled broken horror that had been
Prince Achmet ibn Doubeys was cast carelessly on a heap of dead, a
touch of life still pulsing through the tortured limbs. On the
crimson mask of his features fell the shadow of vulture wings in
the sunset. Zenghi threw aside the dripping scourge and turned to
the silent Frank. But when he met the burning eyes of his captive,
the smile faded from the prince's lips and the taunts died
unspoken. In those cold, terrible eyes the Turk read hate beyond
common conception&mdash;a monstrous, burning, almost tangible
thing, drawn up from the lower pits of Hell, not to be dimmed by
time or suffering.</p>

<p>The Turk shivered as from a cold unseen wind. Then he regained
his composure. "I give you life, infidel," said Zenghi, "because of
my oath. You have seen something of my power. Remember it in the
long dreary years when you shall regret my mercy, and howl for
death. And know that as I serve you, I will serve all Christendom.
I have come into Outremer and left their castles desolate; I have
ridden eastward with the heads of their chiefs swinging at my
saddle. I will come again, not as a raider but as a conqueror. I
will sweep their hosts into the sea. Frankistan shall howl for her
dead kings, and my horses shall stamp in the citadels of the
infidel; for on this field I set my feet on the glittering stairs
that lead to empire."</p>

<p>"This is my only word to you, Zenghi, dog of Tiberias," answered
the Frank in a voice he did not himself recognize. "In a year, or
ten years, or twenty years, I will come again to you, to pay this
debt."</p>

<p>"Thus spake the trapped wolf to the hunter," answered Zenghi,
and turning to the memluks who held Norwald, he said, "Place him
among the unransomed captives. Take him to Bassorah and see that he
is sold as a galley-slave. He is strong and may live for four or
five years."</p>

<p>The sun was setting in crimson, gloomy and sinister for the
fugitives who staggered toward the distant towers of Hilla that the
setting sun tinted in blood. But the land was as one flooded with
the scarlet glory of imperial pageantry to the Caliph who stood on
a hillock, lifting his voice to Allah who had once more vindicated
the dominance of his chosen viceroy, and saved the sacred City of
Peace from violation.</p>

<p>"Verily, verily, a young lion has risen in Islam, to be as a
sword and shield to the Faithful, to revive the power of Muhammad,
and to confound the infidels!"</p>

<h2><a id="tiberias2" name="tiberias2">CHAPTER 2</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">PRINCE ZENGHI was the son of a slave, which was no
great handicap in that day, when the Seljuk emperors, like the
Ottomans after them, ruled through slave generals and satraps. His
father, Ak Sunkur, had held high posts under the sultan Melik Shah,
and as a young boy Zenghi had been taken under the special guidance
of that war-hawk Kerbogha of Mosul.</p>

<p>The young eagle was not a Seljuk; his sires were Turks from
beyond the Oxus, of that people which men later called Tatars. Men
of this blood were rapidly becoming the dominant factor in western
Asia, as the empire of the Seljuks, who had enslaved and trained
them in the art of ruling, began to crumble. Emirs were stirring
restlessly under the relaxing yoke of the sultans. The Seljuks were
reaping the yield of the seeds of the feudal system they had sown,
and among the jealous sons of Melik Shah there was none strong
enough to rebuild the crumbling lines.</p>

<p>So far the fiefs, held by feudal vassals of the sultans, were at
least nominally loyal to the royal masters, but already there was
beginning the slow swirling upheaval that ultimately reared
kingdoms on the ruins of the old empire. The driving impetus of one
man advanced this movement more than anything else&mdash;the vital
dynamic power of Zenghi esh Shami&mdash;Zenghi the Syrian, so
called because of his exploits against the Crusaders in Syria.
Popular legendry has passed him by, to exalt Saladin who followed
and overshadowed him; yet he was the forerunner of the great Moslem
heroes who were to shatter the Crusading kingdoms, and but for him
the shining deeds of Saladin might never have come to pass.</p>

<p>In the dim and misty pageantry of phantoms that move shadow-like
through those crimson years, one figure stands out clear and
bold-etched&mdash;a figure on a rearing black stallion, the black
silken cloak flowing from his mailed shoulders, the dripping
scimitar in his hand. He is Zenghi, son of the pagan nomads, the
first of a glittering line of magnificent conquerors before whom
the iron men of Christendom reeled&mdash;Nur-ad-din, Saladin,
Baibars, Kalawun, Bayazid&mdash;aye, and Subotai, Genghis Khan,
Hulagu, Tamerlane, and Suleiman the Great.</p>

<p>In 1124 the fall of Tyre to the Crusaders marked the high tide
of Frankish power in Asia. Thereafter the hammer-strokes of Islam
fell on a waning sovereignty. At the time of the battle of the
Euphrates the kingdom of Outremer extended from Edessa in the north
to Ascalon in the south, a distance of some five hundred miles. Yet
it was in few places more than fifty miles broad, from east to
west, and walled Moslem towns were within a day's ride of Christian
keeps. Such a condition could not exist forever. That it existed as
long as it did was owing partly to the indomitable valor of the
cross-wearers, and partly to the lack of a strong leader among the
Moslems.</p>

<p>In Zenghi such a leader was found. When he broke ibn Sadaka he
was thirty-eight years of age, and had held his fief of Wasit but a
year. Thirty-six was the minimum age at which the sultans allowed a
man to hold a governorship, and most notables were much older when
they were so honored than was Zenghi. But the honor only whetted
his ambition.</p>

<p>The same sun that shone mercilessly on John Norwald, stumbling
along in chains on the road that led to the galley's bench, gleamed
on Zenghi's gilded mail as he rode north to enter the service of
the sultan Muhammad at Hamadhan. His boast that his feet were set
on the stairs of fame was no idle one. All orthodox Islam vied in
honoring him.</p>

<p>To the Franks who had felt his talons in Syria, came faint
tidings of that battle beside the Nile canal, and they heard other
word of his growing power. There came tidings of a dispute between
sultan and Caliph, and of Zenghi turning against his former master,
riding into Bagdad with the banners of Muhammad. Honors rained like
stars on his turban, sang the Arab minstrels. Warden of Bagdad,
governor of Irak, prince of el Jezira, Atabeg of Mosul&mdash;on up
the glittering stairs of power rode Zenghi, while the Franks
ignored the tidings from the East with the perverse blindness of
their race&mdash;until Hell burst along their borders and the roar
of the Lion shook their towers.</p>

<p>Outposts and castles went up in flames, and Christian throats
felt the knife edge, Christian necks the yoke of slavery. Outside
the walls of doomed Athalib, Baldwin, king of Jerusalem, saw his
picked chivalry swept broken and flying into the desert. Again at
Barin the Lion drove Baldwin and his Damascene allies headlong in
flight, and when the Emperor of Byzantium himself, John Comnene,
moved against the victorious Turk, he found himself chasing a
desert wind that turned unexpectedly and slaughtered his
stragglers, and harried his lines until life was a burden and a
stone about his royal neck.</p>

<p>John Comnene decided that his Moslem neighbors were no more to
be despised than his barbaric Frankish allies, and before he sailed
away from the Syrian coast he held secret parleys with Zenghi that
bore crimson fruit in later years. His going left the Turk free to
move against his eternal enemies, the Franks. His objective was
Edessa, northernmost stronghold of the Christians, and one of the
most powerful of their cities. But like a crafty swordsman he
blinded his foes by feints and gestures.</p>

<p>Outremer reeled before his blows. The land was filled with the
chanting of the riders, the twang of bows, and the whine of swords.
Zenghi's hawks swept through the land and their horses hoofs
spattered blood on the standards of kings. Walled castles toppled
in flame, sword-hacked corpses strewed the valleys, dark hands
knotted in the yellow tresses of screaming women, and the lords of
the Franks cried out in wrath and pain. Up the glittering stairs of
empire rode Zenghi on his black stallion, his scimitar dripping in
his hand, stars jeweling his turban.</p>

<p>And while he swept the land like a storm, and hurled down barons
to make drinking-cups of their skulls and stables of their palaces,
the galley-slaves, whispering to one another in their eternal
darkness where the oars clacked everlastingly and the lap of the
waves was a symphony of slow madness, spoke of a red-haired giant
who never spoke, and whom neither labor, nor starvation, nor the
dripping lash, nor the drag of the bitter years could break.</p>

<p>The years passed, glittering, star-strewn, gilt-spangled years
to the rider in the shining saddle, to the lord in the golden-domed
palace; black, silent, bitter years in the creaking, reeking,
rat-haunted darkness of the galleys.</p>

<br>

<h2><a id="tiberias3" name="tiberias3">CHAPTER 3</a>
</h2>

<p class="poem" style="margin-left:22%">"He rides on the wind with
the stars in his hair;<br>
Like Death falls his shadow on castles and towns;<br>
And the kings of the Caphars cry out in despair.<br>
For the hoofs of his stallion have trampled their crowns."</p>

<p>THUS SANG a wandering Arab minstrel in the tavern of a little
outpost village which stood on the ancient&mdash;and now
little-traveled&mdash;road from Antioch to Aleppo. The village was
a cluster of mud huts huddling about a castle-crowned hill. The
population was mongrel&mdash;Syrians, Arabs, mixed breeds with
Frankish blood in their veins.</p>

<p>Tonight a representative group was gathered in the
inn&mdash;native laborers from the fields; a lean Arab herdsman or
two; French men-at-arms in worn leather and rusty mail, from the
castle on the hill; a pilgrim wandered off his route to the holy
places of the south; the ragged minstrel.</p>

<p>Two figures held the attention of casual lookers-on. They sat on
opposite sides of a rudely carved table, eating meat and drinking
wine, and they were evidently strangers to each other, since no
word passed between them, though each glanced surreptitiously at
the other from time to time.</p>

<p>Both were tall, hard limbed and broad shouldered, but there the
resemblance ended. One was clean-shaven, with a hawk-like predatory
face from which keen blue eyes gleamed coldly. His burnished helmet
lay on the bench beside him with the kite-shaped shield, and his
mail coif was pushed back, revealing a mass of red-gold hair. His
armor gleamed with gilt-work and silver chasing, and the hilt of
his broadsword sparkled with jewels.</p>

<p>The man opposite him seemed drab by comparison, with his dusty
gray chain mail and worn sword-hilt untouched by any gleam of gem
or gold. His square-cut tawny mane was matched by a short beard
which masked the strong lines of jaw and chin.</p>

<p>The minstrel finished his song with an exultant clash of the
strings, and eyed his audience half in insolence, half in
uneasiness.</p>

<p>"And thus, masters," he intoned, one eye on possible alms, the
other on the door. "Zenghi, prince of Wasit, brought his memluks up
the Tigris on boats to aid the sultan Muhammad who lay encamped
about the walls of Bagdad. Then, when the Caliph saw the banners of
Zenghi, he said, 'Lo, now is come up against me the young lion who
overthrew ibn Sadaka for me; open the gates, friends, and throw
yourselves on his mercy, for there is none found to stand before
him.' And it was done, and the sultan gave to Zenghi all the land
of el Jezira.</p>

<p>"Gold and power flowed through his fingers. Mosul, his capital,
which he found a waste of ruins, he made to bloom as roses blossom
by an oasis. Kings trembled before him but the poor rejoiced, for
he shielded them from the sword. His servants looked on him as upon
God. Of him it is told that he gave a slave a husk to hold, and not
for a year did he ask for it. Then when he demanded it, lo, the man
gave it into his hands, wrapped in a napkin, and for his diligence
Zenghi gave him command of a castle. For though the Atabeg is a
hard master, yet he is just to True Believers."</p>

<p>The knight in the gleaming mail flung the minstrel a coin.</p>

<p>"Well sung, pagan!" he cried in a harsh voice that sounded the
Norman-French words strangely. "Know you the song of the sack of
Edessa?"</p>

<p>"Aye, my lord," smirked the minstrel, "and with the favor of
your lordships I will essay it."</p>

<p>"Your head shall roll on the floor first," spoke the other
knight suddenly in a voice deep and somber with menace. "It is
enough that you praise the dog Zenghi in our teeth. No man sings of
his butcheries at Edessa, beneath a Christian roof in my
presence."</p>

<p>The minstrel blenched and gave back, for the cold gray eyes of
the Frank were grim. The knight in the ornate mail looked at the
speaker curiously, no resentment in his reckless dancing eyes.</p>

<p>"You speak as one to whom the subject is a sore one, friend,"
said he.</p>

<p>The other fixed his somber stare on his questioner, but made no
reply save a slight shrug of his mighty mailed shoulders as he
continued his meal.</p>

<p>"Come," persisted the stranger, "I meant no offense. I am newly
come to these parts&mdash;I am Sir Roger d'Ibelin, vassal to the
king of Jerusalem. I have fought Zenghi in the south, when Baldwin
and Anar of Damascus made alliance against him, and I only wished
to hear the details of the taking of Edessa. By God, there were few
Christians who escaped to bear the tale."</p>

<p>"I crave pardon for my seeming discourtesy," returned the other.
"I am Miles du Courcey, in the service of the prince of Antioch. I
was in Edessa when it fell.</p>

<p>"Zenghi came up from Mosul and laid waste the Diyar Bekr, taking
town after town from the Seljuks. Count Joscelin de Courtenay was
dead, and the rule was in the hands of that sluggard, Joscelin II.
In the late fall of the year Zenghi laid siege to Amid, and the
count bestirred himself&mdash;but only to march away to Turbessel
with all his household.</p>

<p>"We were left at Edessa with the town in charge of fat Armenian
merchants who gripped their moneybags and trembled in fear of
Zenghi, unable to overcome their swinish avarice enough to pay the
mongrel mercenaries Joscelin had left to defend the city.</p>

<p>"Well, as anyone might know, Zenghi left Amid and marched
against us as soon as word reached him that the poor fool Joscelin
had departed. He reared his siege engines over against the walls,
and day and night hurled assaults against the gates and towers,
which had never fallen had we had the proper force to man them.</p>

<p>"But to give them their due, our wretched mercenaries did well.
There was no rest or ease for any of us; day and night the
ballistas creaked, stones and beams crashed against the towers,
arrows blinded the sky in their whistling clouds, and Zenghi's
chanting devils swarmed up the walls.</p>

<p>We beat them back until our swords were broken, our mail hung in
bloody tatters, and our arms were dead with weariness. For a month
we kept Zenghi at bay, waiting for Count Joscelin, but he never
came.</p>

<p>"It was on the morning of December 23rd that the rams and
engines made a great breach in the outer wall, and the Moslems came
through like a river bursting through a dam. The defenders died
like flies along the broken ramparts, but human power could not
stem that tide. The memluks rode into the streets and the battle
became a massacre. The Turkish sword knew no mercy. Priests died at
their altars, women in their courtyards, children at their play.
Bodies choked the streets, the gutters ran crimson, and through it
all rode Zenghi on his black stallion like a phantom of Death."</p>

<p>"Yet you escaped?"</p>

<p>The cold gray eyes became more somber.</p>

<p>"I had a small band of men-at-arms. When I was dashed senseless
from my saddle by a Turkish mace, they took me up and rode for the
western gate. Most of them died in the winding streets, but the
survivors brought me to safety. When I recovered my senses the city
lay far behind me.</p>

<p>"But I rode back." The speaker seemed to have forgotten his
audience. His eyes were distant, withdrawn; his bearded chin rested
on his mailed fist; he seemed to be speaking to himself. "Aye, I
had ridden into the teeth of Hell itself. But I met a servant,
fallen death-stricken among the straggling fugitives, and ere he
died he told me that she whom I sought was dead&mdash; struck down
by a memluk's scimitar."</p>

<p>Shaking his iron-clad shoulders he roused himself as from a
bitter revelry. His eyes grew cold and hard again; the harsh timbre
re-entered his voice.</p>

<p>"Two years have seen a great change in Edessa I hear. Zenghi
rebuilt the walls and has made it one of his strongest holds. Our
hold on the land is crumbling and tearing away. With a little aid,
Zenghi will surge over Outremer and obliterate all vestiges of
Christendom."</p>

<p>"That aid may come from the north," muttered a bearded
man-at-arms. "I was in the train of the barons who marched with
John Comnene when Zenghi outmaneuvered him. The emperor has no love
for us."</p>

<p>"Bah! He is at least a Christian," laughed the man who called
himself d'Ibelin, running his restless fingers through his
clustering golden locks.</p>

<p>Du Courcey's cold eyes narrowed suddenly as they rested on a
heavy golden ring of curious design on the other's finger, but he
said nothing.</p>

<p>Heedless of the intensity of the Norman's stare, d'Ibelin rose
and tossed a coin on the table to pay his reckoning. With a
careless word of farewell to the idlers he rose and strode out of
the inn with a clanking of armor. The men inside heard him shouting
impatiently for his horse. And Sir Miles du Courcey rose, took up
shield and helmet, and followed.</p>

<p>The man known as d'Ibelin had covered perhaps a half-mile, and
the castle on the hill was but a faint bulk behind him, gemmed by a
few points of light, when a drum of hoofs made him wheel with a
guttural oath that was not French. In the dim starlight he made out
the form of his recent inn companion, and he laid hand on his
jeweled hilt. Du Courcey drew up beside him and spoke to the grimly
silent figure.</p>

<p>"Antioch lies the other way, good sir. Perhaps you have taken
the wrong road by mischance. Three hours' ride in this direction
will bring you into Saracen territory."</p>

<p>"Friend," retorted the other, "I have not asked your advice
concerning my road. Whether I go east or west is scarcely your
affair."</p>

<p>"As vassal to the prince of Antioch it is my affair to inquire
into suspicious actions within his domain. When I see a man
traveling under false pretenses, with a Saracen ring on his finger,
riding by night toward the border, it seems suspicious enough for
me to make inquiries."</p>

<p>"I can explain my actions if I see fit," bruskly answered
d'Ibelin, "but these insulting accusations I will answer at the
sword's point. What mean you by false pretensions?"</p>

<p>"You are not Roger d'Ibelin. You are not even a Frenchman."</p>

<p>"No?" a sneer rasped in the other's voice as he slipped his
sword from its sheath.</p>

<p>"No. I have been to Constantinople, and seen the northern
mercenaries who serve the Greek emperor. I can not forget your hawk
face. You are John Comnene's spy&mdash;Wulfgar Edric's son, a
captain in the Varangian Guard."</p>

<p>A wild beast snarl burst from the masquerader's lips and his
horse screamed and leaped convulsively as he struck in the spurs,
throwing all his frame behind his sword arm as the beast plunged.
But du Courcey was too seasoned a fighter to be caught so easily.
With a wrench of his rein he brought his steed round, rearing. The
Varangian's frantic horse plunged past, and the whistling sword
struck fire from the Norman's lifted shield. With a furious yell
the fierce Norman wheeled again to the assault, and the horses
reared together while the swords of their riders hissed, circled in
flashing arcs, and fell with ringing clash on mail-links or
shield.</p>

<p>The men fought in grim silence, save for the panting of
straining effort, but the clangor of their swords awoke the still
night and sparks flew as from a blacksmith's anvil. Then with a
deafening crash a broadsword shattered a helmet and splintered the
skull within. There followed a loud clash of armor as the loser
fell heavily from his saddle. A riderless horse galloped away, and
the conqueror, shaking the sweat from his eyes, dismounted and bent
above the motionless steel-clad figure.</p>

<h2><a id="tiberias4" name="tiberias4">CHAPTER 4</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">ON THE ROAD that leads south from Edessa to Rakka,
the Moslem host lay encamped, the lines of gay-colored pavilions
spread out in the plains. It was a leisurely march, with wagons,
luxurious equipment, and whole households with women and slaves.
After two years in Edessa the Atabeg of Mosul was returning to his
capital by the way of Rakka. Fires glimmered in the gathering dusk
where the first stars were peeping; lutes twanged and voices were
lifted in song and laughter about the cooking pots.</p>

<p>Before Zenghi, playing at chess with his friend and chronicler,
the Arab Ousama of Sheyzar, came the eunuch Yaruktash, who salaamed
low and in his squeaky voice intoned, "Oh, Lion of Islam, an emir
of the infidels desires audience with thee&mdash;the captain of the
Greeks who is called Wulfgar Edric's son. The chief Il-Ghazi and
his memluks came upon him, riding alone, and would have slain him
but he threw up his arm and on his hand they saw the ring thou
gavest the emperor as a secret sign for his messengers."</p>

<p>Zenghi tugged his gray-shot black beard and grinned, well
pleased.</p>

<p>"Let him be brought before me." The slave bowed and
withdrew.</p>

<p>To Ousama, Zenghi said, "Allah, what dogs are these Christians,
who betray and cut one another's throats for the promise of gold or
land!"</p>

<p>"Is it well to trust such a man?" queried Ousama. "If he will
betray his kind, he will surely betray you if he may."</p>

<p>"May I eat pork if I trust him," retorted Zenghi, moving a
chessman with a jeweled finger. "As I move this pawn I will move
the dog-emperor of the Greeks. With his aid I will crack the kings
of Outremer like nutshells. I have promised him their seaports, and
he will keep his promises until he thinks his prizes are in his
hands. Ha! Not towns but the sword-edge I will give him. What we
take together shall be mine, nor will that suffice me. By Allah,
not Mesopotamia, nor Syria, nor all Asia Minor is enough! I will
cross the Hellespont! I will ride my stallion through the palaces
on the Golden Horn! Frankistan herself shall tremble before
me!"</p>

<p>The impact of his voice was like that of a harsh-throated
trumpet, almost stunning the hearers with its dynamic intensity.
His eyes blazed, his fingers knotted like iron on the
chessboard.</p>

<p>"You are old, Zenghi," warned the cautious Arab. "You have done
much. Is there no limit to your ambitions?"</p>

<p>"Aye!" laughed the Turk. "The horn of the moon and the points of
the stars! Old? Eleven years older than thyself, and younger in
spirit than thou wert ever. My thews are steel, my heart is fire,
my wits keener even than on the day I broke ibn Sadaka beside the
Nile and set my feet on the shining stairs of glory! Peace, here
comes the Frank."</p>

<p>A small boy of about eight years of age, sitting cross-legged on
a cushion near the edge of the dais whereon lay Zenghi's divan, had
been staring up in rapt adoration. His fine brown eyes sparkled as
Zenghi spoke of his ambition, and his small frame quivered with
excitement, as if his soul had taken fire from the Turk's wild
words. Now he looked at the entrance of the pavilion with the
others, as the memluks entered with the visitor between them, his
scabbard empty. They had taken his weapons outside the royal
tent.</p>

<p>The memluks fell back and ranged themselves on either side of
the dais, leaving the Frank in an open space before their master.
Zenghi's keen eyes swept over the tall form in its glittering
gold-worked mail, took in the clean-shaven face with its cold eyes,
and rested on the Koran-inscribed ring on the man's finger.</p>

<p>"My master, the emperor of Byzantium," said the Frank in Turki,
"sends thee greeting, oh Zenghi, Lion of Islam."</p>

<p>As he spoke he took in the details of the impressive figure,
clad in steel, silk and gold, before him; the strong dark face, the
powerful frame which, despite the years, betokened steel-spring
muscles and unquenchable vitality; above all the Atabeg's eyes,
gleaming with unperishable youth and innate fierceness.</p>

<p>"And what said thy master, oh Wulfgar?" asked the Turk.</p>

<p>"He sends thee this letter," answered the Frank, drawing forth a
packet and proffering it to Yaruktash, who in turn, and on his
knees, delivered it to Zenghi. The Atabeg perused the parchment,
signed in the Emperor's unmistakable hand and sealed with the royal
Byzantine seal. Zenghi never dealt with underlings, but always with
the highest power of friends or foes.</p>

<p>"The seals have been broken," said the Turk, fixing his piercing
eyes on the inscrutable countenance of the Frank. "Thou hast
read?"</p>

<p>"Aye. I was pursued by men of the prince of Antioch, and fearing
lest I be seized and searched, I opened the missive and read it, so
that if I were forced to destroy it lest it fall into enemy hands,
I could repeat the message to thee by word of mouth."</p>

<p>"Let me hear, then, if thy memory be equal to thy discretion,"
commanded the Atabeg.</p>

<p>"As thou wilt. My master says to thee, 'Concerning that which
hath passed between us, I must have better proof of thy good faith.
Wherefore do thou send me by this messenger, who, though unknown to
thee, is a man to be trusted, full details of thy desires and good
proof of the aid thou hast promised us in the proposed movement
against Antioch. Before I put to sea I must know that thou art
ready to move by land, and there must be binding oaths between us.'
And the missive is signed with the emperor's own hand."</p>

<p>The Turk nodded; a mirthful devil danced in his blue eyes.</p>

<p>"They are his very words. Blessed is the monarch who boasts such
a vassal. Sit ye upon that heap of cushions; meat and drink shall
be brought to you."</p>

<p>Calling Yaruktash, Zenghi whispered in his ear. The eunuch
started, stared, and then salaamed and hastened from the pavilion.
Slaves brought food and the forbidden wine in golden vessels, and
the Frank broke his fast with unfeigned relish. Zenghi watched him
inscrutably and the glittering memluks stood like statues of
burnished steel.</p>

<p>"You came first to Edessa?" asked the Atabeg.</p>

<p>"Nay. When I left my ship at Antioch I set forth for Edessa, but
I had scarce crossed the border when a band of wandering Arabs,
recognizing your ring, told me you were on the march for Rakka,
thence to Mosul. So I turned aside and rode to cut your line of
march, and my way being made clear for me by virtue of the ring
which all your subjects know, I was at last met by the chief
Il-Ghazi who escorted me thither."</p>

<p>Zenghi nodded his leonine head slowly.</p>

<p>"Mosul calls me. I go back to my capital to gather my hawks, to
brace my lines. When I return I will sweep the Franks into the sea
with the aid of&mdash;thy master.</p>

<p>"But I forget the courtesy due a guest. This is the prince
Ousama of Sheyzar, and this child is the son of my friend
Nejm-ed-din, who saved my army and my life when I fled from Karaja
the Cup-bearer&mdash;one of the few foes who ever saw my back. His
father dwells at Baalbekk, which I gave him to rule, but I have
taken Yusef with me to look on Mosul. Verily, he is more to me than
my own sons. I have named him Salah-ed-din, and he shall be a thorn
in the flesh of Christendom."</p>

<p>At this instant Yaruktash entered and whispered in Zenghi's ear,
and the Atabeg nodded.</p>

<p>As the eunuch withdrew, Zenghi turned to the Frank. The Turk's
manner had changed subtly. His lids drooped over his glittering
eyes and a faint hint of mockery curled his bearded lips.</p>

<p>"I would show you one whose countenance you know of old," said
he.</p>

<p>The Frank looked up in surprize.</p>

<p>"Have I a friend in the hosts of Mosul?"</p>

<p>"You shall see!" Zenghi clapped his hands, and Yaruktash,
appearing at the door of the pavilion grasping a slender white
wrist, dragged the owner into view and cast her from him so that
she fell to the carpet almost at the Frank's feet. With a terrible
cry he started up, his face deathly.</p>

<p>"Ellen! My God! Alive!"</p>

<p>"Miles!" she echoed his cry, struggling to her knees. In a mist
of stupefaction he saw her white arms outstretched, her pale face
framed in the golden hair which fell over the white shoulders the
scanty <i>harim</i> garb left bare. Forgetting all else he fell to
his knees beside her, gathering her into his arms.</p>

<p>"Ellen! Ellen de Tremont! I had scoured the world for you and
hacked a path through the legions of Hell itself&mdash;but they
said you were dead. Musa, before he died at my feet, swore he saw
you lying in your blood among the corpses of your servants in your
courtyard."</p>

<p>"Would God it had been so!" she sobbed, her golden head against
his steel-clad breast. "But when they cut down my servants I fell
among the bodies in a swoon, and their blood stained my garments;
so men thought me dead. It was Zenghi himself who found me alive,
and took me&mdash;" She hid her face in her hands.</p>

<p>"And so, Sir Miles du Courcey," broke in the sardonic voice of
the Turk, "you have found a friend among the Mosuli! Fool! My
senses are keener than a whetted sword. Think you I did not know
you, despite your clean-shaven face? I saw you too often on the
ramparts of Edessa, hewing down my memluks. I knew you as soon as
you entered. What have you done with the real messenger?"</p>

<p>Grimly Miles disengaged himself from the girl's clinging arms
and rose, facing the Atabeg. Zenghi likewise rose, quick and lithe
as a great panther, and drew his scimitar, while from all sides the
heron-feathered memluks began to edge in silently. Miles' hand fell
away from his empty scabbard and his eyes rested for an instant on
something close to his feet&mdash;a curved knife, used for carving
fruit, and lying there forgotten, half-hidden under a cushion.</p>

<p>"Wulfgar Edric's son lies dead among the trees on the Antioch
road," said Miles grimly. "I shaved off my beard and took his armor
and the ring the dog bore."</p>

<p>"The better to spy on me," quoth Zenghi.</p>

<p>"Aye." There was no fear in Miles du Courcey. "I wished to learn
the details of the plot you hatched with John Comnene, and to
obtain proofs of his treachery and your ambitions to show to the
lords of Outremer."</p>

<p>"I deduced as much," smiled Zenghi. "I knew you, as I said. But
I wished you to betray yourself fully; hence the girl, who has
spoken your name with weeping many times in the years of her
captivity."</p>

<p>"It was an unworthy gesture and one in keeping with your
character," said Miles somberly. "Yet I thank you for allowing me
to see her once more, and to know that she is alive whom I thought
long dead."</p>

<p>"I have done her great honor," answered Zenghi laughing. "She
has been in my <i>harim</i> for two years."</p>

<p>Miles' grim eyes only grew more somber, but the great veins
swelled almost to bursting along his temples. At his feet the girl
covered her face with her white hands and wept silently. The boy on
the cushion looked about uncertainly, not understanding. Ousama's
fine eyes were touched with pity. But Zenghi grinned broadly. Such
scenes were like wine to the Turk, shaking inwardly with the
gargantuan laughter of his breed.</p>

<p>"You shall bless me for my bounty, Sir Miles," said Zenghi. "For
my kingly generosity you shall give praise. Lo, the girl is yours!
When I tear you between four wild horses tomorrow, she shall
accompany you to Hell on a pointed stake&mdash;ha!"</p>

<p>Like a striking cobra Miles du Courcey had moved. Snatching the
knife from beneath the cushion he leaped&mdash;not at the guarded
Atabeg on the divan, but at the child on the edge of the dais.
Before any could stop him, he caught up the boy Saladin with one
hand, and with the other pressed the curved edge to his throat.</p>

<p>"Back, dogs!" His voice cracked with mad triumph. "Back, or I
send this heathen spawn to Hell!"</p>

<p>Zenghi, his face livid, yelled a frenzied order, and the memluks
fell back. Then while the Atabeg stood trembling and uncertain, at
a loss for the first and only time of his whole wild career, du
Courcey backed toward the door, holding his captive, who neither
cried out nor struggled. The contemplative brown eyes showed no
fear, only a fatalistic resignation of a philosophy beyond the
owner's years.</p>

<p>"To me, Ellen!" snapped the Norman, his somber despair changed
to dynamic action. "Out of the door behind me&mdash;back dogs, I
say!"</p>

<p>Out of the pavilion he backed, and the memluks who ran up, sword
in hand, stopped short as they saw the imminent peril of their
lord's favorite. Du Courcey knew that the success of his action
depended on speed. The surprize and boldness of his move had taken
Zenghi off guard, that was all. A group of horses stood near by,
saddled and bridled, always ready for the Atabeg's whim, and du
Courcey reached them with a single long stride, the grooms falling
back from his threat.</p>

<p>"Into a saddle, Ellen!" he snapped, and the girl, who had
followed him like one in a daze, reacting mechanically to his
orders, swung herself up on the nearest mount. Quickly he followed
suit and cut the tethers that held their mounts. A bellow from
inside the tent told him Zenghi's momentarily scattered wits were
working again, and he dropped the child unhurt into the sand. His
usefulness was past, as a hostage. Zenghi, taken by surprize, had
instinctively followed the promptings of his unusual affection for
the child, but Miles knew that with his ruthless reason dominating
him again, the Atabeg would not allow even that affection to stand
in the way of their recapture.</p>

<p>The Norman wheeled away, drawing Ellen's steed with him, trying
to shield her with his own body from the arrows which were already
whistling about them. Shoulder to shoulder they raced across the
wide open space in front of the royal pavilion, burst through a
ring of fires, floundered for an instant among tent-pegs, cords and
scurrying yelling figures, then struck the open desert flying and
heard the clamor die out behind them.</p>

<p>It was dark, clouds flying across the sky and drowning the
stars. With the clatter of hoofs behind them, Miles reined aside
from the road that led westward, and turned into the trackless
desert. Behind them the hoof-beats faded westward. The pursuers had
taken the old caravan road, supposing the fugitives to be ahead of
them.</p>

<p>"What now, Miles?" Ellen was riding alongside, and clinging to
his iron-sheathed arm as if she feared he might fade suddenly from
her sight.</p>

<p>"If we ride straight for the border they will have us before
dawn," he answered. "But I know this land as well as they&mdash;I
have ridden all over it of old in foray and war with the counts of
Edessa; so I know that Jabar Kal'at lies within our reach to the
southwest. The commander of Jabar is a nephew of Muin-ed-din Anar,
who is the real ruler of Damascus, and who, as perhaps you know,
has made a pact with the Christians against Zenghi, his old rival.
If we can reach Jabar, the commander will give us shelter and food,
and fresh horses and an escort to the border."</p>

<p>The girl bowed her head in acquiescence. She was still like one
dazed. The light of hope burned too feebly in her soul to sting her
with new pangs. Perhaps in her captivity she had absorbed some of
the fatalism of her masters. Miles looked at her, drooping in the
saddle, humble and silent, and thought of the picture he retained
of a saucy, laughing beauty, vibrant with vitality and mirth. And
he cursed Zenghi and his works with sick fury. So through the night
they rode, the broken woman and the embittered man, handiworks of
the Lion who dealt in swords and souls and human hearts, and whose
victims, living and dead, filled the land like a blight of sorrow,
agony and despair.</p>

<p>All night they pressed forward as fast as they dared, listening
for sounds that would tell them the pursuers had found their trail,
and in the dawn, which lit the helmets of swift-following horsemen,
they saw the towers of Jabar rising above the mirroring waters of
the Euphrates. It was a strong keep, guarded with a moat that
encircled it, connecting with the river at either end.</p>

<p>At their hail the commander of the castle appeared on the wall,
and a few words sufficed to cause the drawbridge to be lowered. It
was not a moment too soon. As they clattered across the bridge, the
drum of hoofs was in their ears, and as they passed through the
gates, arrows fell in a shower about them.</p>

<p>The leader of the pursuers reined his rearing steed and called
arrogantly to the commander on the tower.</p>

<p>"Oh man, give up these fugitives, lest thy blood quench the
embers of thy keep!"</p>

<p>"Am I then a dog that you speak to me thus?" queried the Seljuk,
clutching his beard in passion. "Begone, or my archers will feather
thy carcass with fifty shafts."</p>

<p>For answer the memluk laughed jeeringly and pointed to the
desert. The commander paled. Far away the sun glinted on a moving
ocean of steel. His practiced eye told him that a whole army was on
the march.</p>

<p>"Zenghi has turned from his march to hunt down a pair of fleeing
jackals," called the memluk mockingly. "Great honor he has done
them, marching hard on their spoor all night. Send them out, oh
fool, and my master will ride on in peace."</p>

<p>"Let it be as Allah wills," said the Seljuk, recovering his
poise. "But the friends of my uncle have thrown themselves into my
hands, and may shame rest on me and mine if I give them to the
butcher."</p>

<p>Nor did he alter his resolution when Zenghi himself, his face
dark with passion as the cloak that flowed from his steel-clad
shoulders, sat his stallion beneath the towers and called:</p>

<p>"Oh man, by receiving mine enemy thou hast forfeited thy castle
and thy life. Yet I will be merciful. Send out those who fled and I
will allow thee to march out unharmed with thy women and retainers.
Persist in this madness and I will burn thee like a rat in thy
castle."</p>

<p>"Let it be as Allah wills," repeated the Seljuk philosophically,
and in an undertone spoke quietly to a crouching archer, "Drive
quickly a shaft through yon dog."</p>

<p>The arrow glanced harmlessly from Zenghi's breastplate and the
Atabeg galloped out of range with a shout of mocking laughter. Now
began the siege of Jabar Kal'at, unsung and unglorified, yet in the
course of which the dice of Fate were cast.</p>

<p>Zenghi's riders laid waste the surrounding countryside and drew
a cordon about the castle through which no courier could steal to
ride for aid. While the emir of Damascus and the lords of Outremer
remained in ignorance of what was taking place beyond the
Euphrates, their ally waged his unequal battle.</p>

<p>By nightfall the wagons and siege engines came up, and Zenghi
set to his task with the skill of long practice. The Turkish
sappers dammed up the moat at the upper end, despite the arrows of
the defenders, and filled up the drained ditch with earth and
stone. Under cover of darkness they sank mines beneath the towers.
Zenghi's ballistas creaked and crashed and huge rocks knocked men
off the walls like tenpins or smashed through the roof of the
towers. His rams gnawed and pounded at the walls, his archers plied
the turrets with their arrows everlastingly, and on scaling-ladders
and storming-towers his memluks moved unceasingly to the onset.
Food waned in the castle's larders; the heaps of dead grew larger,
the rooms became full of wounded men, groaning and writhing.</p>

<p>But the Seljuk commander did not falter on the path his feet had
taken. He knew that he could not now buy safety from Zenghi, even
by giving up his guests; to his credit, he never even considered
giving them up. Du Courcey knew this, and though no word of the
matter was spoken between them, the commander had evidence of the
Norman's fierce gratitude. Miles showed his appreciation in
actions, not words&mdash;in the fighting on the walls, in the
slaughter in the gates, in the long night-watches on the towers;
with whirring sword-strokes that clove bucklers and peaked helmets,
that cleft spines and severed necks and limbs and shattered skulls;
by the casting down of scaling-ladders when the clinging Turks
howled as they crashed to their death, and their comrades cried out
at the terrible strength in the Frank's naked hands. But the rams
crunched, the arrows sang, the steel tides surged on again and
again, and the haggard defenders dropped one by one until only a
skeleton force held the crumbling walls of Jabar Kal'at.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="tiberias5" name="tiberias5">CHAPTER 5</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">IN HIS PAVILION little more than a bowshot from
the beleaguered walls, Zenghi played chess with Ousama. The madness
of the day had given way to the brooding silence of night, broken
only by the distant cries of wounded men in delirium.</p>

<p>"Men are my pawns, friend," said the Atabeg. "I turn adversity
into triumph. I had long sought an excuse to attack Jabar Kal'at,
which will make a strong outpost against the Franks once I have
taken it and repaired the dents I have made, and filled it with my
memluks.</p>

<p>I knew my captives would ride hither; that is why I broke camp
and took up the march before my scouts found their tracks. It was
their logical refuge. I will have the castle and the Franks, which
last is most vital. Were the Caphars to learn now of my intrigue
with the emperor, my plans might well come to naught. But they will
not know until I strike. Du Courcey will never bear news to them.
If he does not fall with the castle, I will tear him between wild
horses as I promised, and the infidel girl shall watch, sitting on
a pointed stake."</p>

<p>"Is there no mercy in your soul, Zenghi?" protested the
Arab.</p>

<p>"Has life shown mercy to me save what I wrung forth by the
sword?" exclaimed Zenghi, his eyes blazing in a momentary upheaval
of his passionate spirit. "A man must smite or be
smitten&mdash;slay or be slain. Men are wolves, and I am but the
strongest wolf of the pack. Because they fear me, men crawl and
kiss my sandals. Fear is the only emotion by which they may be
touched."</p>

<p>"You are a pagan at heart, Zenghi," sighed Ousama.</p>

<p>"It may be," answered the Turk with a shrug of his shoulders.
"Had I been born beyond the Oxus and bowed to yellow Erlik as did
my grandsire, I had been no less Zenghi the Lion.</p>

<p>"I have spilled rivers of gore for the glory of Allah, but I
have never asked mercy or favor of Him. What care the gods if a man
lives or dies? Let me live deep, let me know the sting of wine in
my palate, the wind in my face, the glitter of royal pageantry, the
bright madness of slaughter&mdash;let me burn and sting and tingle
with the madness of life and living, and I quest not whether
Muhammad's paradise, or Erlik's frozen hell, or the blackness of
empty oblivion lies beyond."</p>

<p>As if to give point to his words, he poured himself a goblet of
wine and looked interrogatively at Ousama. The Arab, who had
shuddered at Zenghi's blasphemous words, drew back in pious horror.
The Atabeg emptied the goblet, smacking his lips loudly in relish,
Tatar-fashion.</p>

<p>"I think Jabar Kal'at will fall tomorrow," he said. "Who has
stood against me? Count them, Ousama&mdash;there was ibn Sadaka,
and the Caliph, and the Seljuk Timurtash, and the sultan Dawud, and
the king of Jerusalem, and the count of Edessa. Man after man, city
after city, army after army, I broke them and brushed them from my
path."</p>

<p>"You have waded through a sea of blood," said Ousama. "You have
filled the slave-markets with Frankish girls, and the deserts with
the bones of Frankish warriors. Nor have you spared your rivals
among the Moslems."</p>

<p>"They stood in the way of my destiny," laughed the Turk, "and
that destiny is to be sultan of Asia! As I will be. I have welded
the swords of Irak, el Jezira, Syria and Roum, into a single blade.
Now with the aid of the Greeks, all Hell can not save the
Nazarenes. Slaughter? Men have seen naught; wait until I ride into
Antioch and Jerusalem, sword in hand!"</p>

<p>"Your heart is steel," said the Arab. "Yet I have seen one touch
of tenderness in you&mdash;your affection for Nejm-ed-din's son,
Yusef. Is there a like touch of repentance in you? Of all your
deeds, is there none you regret?"</p>

<p>Zenghi played with a pawn in silence, and his face darkened.</p>

<p>"Aye," he said slowly. "It was long ago, when I broke ibn Sadaka
beside the lower reaches of this very river. He had a son, Achmet,
a girl-faced boy. I beat him to death with my riding-scourge. It is
the one deed I could wish undone. Sometimes I dream of it."</p>

<p>Then with an abrupt "Enough!" he thrust aside the board,
scattering the chessmen. "I would sleep," said he, and throwing
himself on his cushion-heaped divan, he was instantly locked in
slumber. Ousama went quietly from the tent, passing between the
four giant memluks in gilded mail who stood with wide-tipped
scimitars at the pavilion door.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
In the castle of Jabar, the Seljuk commander held counsel with Sir
Miles du Courcey. "My brother, for us the end of the road has come.
The walls are crumbling, the towers leaning to their fall. Shall we
not fire the castle, cut the throats of our women and children, and
go forth to die like men in the dawn?"</p>

<p>Sir Miles shook his head. "Let us hold the walls for one more
day. In a dream I saw the banners of Damascus and of Antioch
marching to our aid."</p>

<p>He lied in a desperate attempt to bolster up the fatalistic
Seljuk. Each followed the instinct of his kind, and Miles was to
cling with teeth and nails to the last vestige of life until the
bitter end. The Seljuk bowed his head.</p>

<p>"If Allah wills, we will hold the walls for another day."</p>

<p>Miles thought of Ellen, into whose manner something of the old
vibrant spirit was beginning to steal faintly again, and in the
blackness of his despair no light gleamed from earth or heaven. The
finding of her had stung to life a heart long frozen; now in death
he must lose her again. With the taste of bitter ashes in his mouth
he bent his shoulders anew to the burden of life.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
In his tent Zenghi moved restlessly. Alert as a panther, even in
sleep, his instinct told him that someone was moving stealthily
near him. He woke and sat up glaring. The fat eunuch Yaruktash
halted suddenly, the wine jug halfway to his lips. He had thought
Zenghi lay helplessly drunk when he stole into the tent to filch
the liquor he loved. Zenghi snarled like a wolf, his familiar devil
rising in his brain.</p>

<p>"Dog! Am I a fat merchant that you steal into my tent to guzzle
my wine? Begone! Tomorrow I will see to you!"</p>

<p>Cold sweat beaded Yaruktash's sleek hide as he fled from the
royal pavilion. His fat flesh quivered with agonized anticipation
of the sharp stake which would undoubtedly be his portion. In a day
of cruel masters, Zenghi's name was a byword of horror among slaves
and servitors.</p>

<p>One of the memluks outside the tent caught Yaruktash's arm and
growled, "Why flee you, gelding?"</p>

<p>A great flare of light rose in the eunuch's brain, so that he
gasped at its grandeur and audacity. Why remain here to be impaled,
when the whole desert was open before him, and here were men who
would protect him in his flight?</p>

<p>"Our lord discovered me drinking his wine," he gasped. "He
threatens me with torture and death."</p>

<p>The memluks laughed appreciatively, their crude humor touched by
the eunuch's fright. Then they started convulsively as Yaruktash
added, "You too are doomed. I heard him curse you for not keeping
better watch, and allowing his slaves to steal his wine."</p>

<p>The fact that they had never been told to bar the eunuch from
the royal pavilion meant nothing to the memluks, their wits frozen
with sudden fear. They stood dumbly, incapable of coherent thought,
their minds like empty jugs ready to be filled with the eunuch's
guile. A few whispered words and they slunk away like shadows on
Yaruktash's heels, leaving the pavilion unguarded.</p>

<p>The night waned. Midnight hovered and was gone. The moon sank
below the desert hills in a welter of blood. From dreams of
imperial pageantry Zenghi again awoke, to stare bewilderedly about
the dim-lit pavilion. Without, all was silence that seemed suddenly
tense and sinister. The prince lay in the midst of ten thousand
armed men; yet he felt suddenly apart and alone, as if he were the
last man left alive on a dead world. Then he saw that he was not
alone. Looking somberly down on him stood a strange and alien
figure.</p>

<p>It was a man, whose rags did not hide his gaunt limbs, at which
Zenghi stared appalled. They were gnarled like the twisted branches
of ancient oaks, knotted with masses of muscle and thews, each of
which stood out distinct, like iron cables. There was no soft flesh
to lend symmetry or to mask the raw savagery of sheer power. Only
years of incredible labor could have produced this terrible
monument of muscular over-development.</p>

<p>White hair hung about the great shoulders, a white beard fell
upon the mighty breast. His terrible arms were folded, and he stood
motionless as a statue looking down upon the stupefied Turk. His
features were gaunt and deep-lined, as if cut by some mad artist's
chisel from bitter, frozen rock.</p>

<p>"Avaunt!" gasped Zenghi, momentarily a pagan of the steppes.
"Spirit of evil&mdash;ghost of the desert&mdash;demon of the
hills&mdash;I fear you not!"</p>

<p>"Well may you speak of ghosts, Turk!" The deep hollow voice woke
dim memories in Zenghi's brain. "I am the ghost of a man dead
twenty years, come up from darkness deeper than the darkness of
Hell. Have you forgotten my promise, Prince Zenghi?"</p>

<p>"Who are you?" demanded the Turk.</p>

<p>"I am John Norwald."</p>

<p>"The Frank who rode with ibn Sadaka? Impossible!" ejaculated the
Atabeg. "Twenty-three years ago I doomed him to the rower's bench.
What galley-slave could live so long?"</p>

<p>"I lived," retorted the other. "Where others died like flies, I
lived. The lash that scarred my back in a thousand overlying
patterns could not kill me, nor starvation, nor storm, nor
pestilence, nor battle.</p>

<p>The years have been long, Zenghi esh Shami, and the darkness
deep and full of mocking voices and haunting faces. Look at my
hair, Zenghi&mdash;white as hoar-frost, though I am eight years
younger than yourself. Look at these monstrous talons that were
hands, these knotted limbs&mdash;they have driven the weighted oars
for many a thousand leagues through storm and calm.</p>

<p>Yet I lived, Zenghi, even when my flesh cried out to end the
long agony. When I fainted on the oar, it was not ripping lash that
roused me to life anew, but the hate that would not let me die.
That hate has kept the soul in my tortured body for twenty-three
years, dog of Tiberias. In the galleys I lost my youth, my hope, my
manhood, my soul, my faith and my God. But my hate burned on, a
flame that nothing could quench.</p>

<p>"Twenty years at the oars, Zenghi! Three years ago the galley in
which I then toiled crashed on the reefs off the coast of India.
All died but me, who, knowing my hour had come, burst my chains
with the strength and madness of a giant, and gained the shore. My
feet are yet unsteady from the shackles and the galley-bench,
Zenghi, though my arms are strong beyond the belief of man. I have
been on the road from India for three years. But the road ends
here."</p>

<p>For the first time in his life Zenghi knew fear that froze his
tongue to his palate and turned the marrow in his bones to ice.</p>

<p>"Ho, guards!" he roared. "To me, dogs!"</p>

<p>"Call louder, Zenghi!" said Norwald in his hollow resounding
voice. "They hear thee not. Through thy sleeping host I passed like
the Angel of Death, and none saw me. Thy tent stood unguarded. Lo,
mine enemy, thou art delivered into my hand, and thine hour has
come!"</p>

<p>With the ferocity of desperation Zenghi leaped from his
cushions, whipping out a dagger, but like a great gaunt tiger the
Englishman was upon him, crushing him back on the divan. The Turk
struck blindly, felt the blade sink deep into the other's side;
then as he wrenched the weapon free to strike again, he felt an
iron grip on his wrist, and the Frank's right hand locked on his
throat, choking his cry.</p>

<p>As he felt the inhuman strength of his attacker, blind panic
swept the Atabeg. The fingers on his wrist did not feel like human
bone and flesh and sinew. They were like the steel jaws of a vise
that crushed through flesh and muscle. Over the inexorable fingers
that sank into his bull-throat, blood trickled from skin torn like
rotten cloth. Mad with the torture of strangulation, Zenghi tore at
the wrist with his free hand, but he might have been wrenching at a
steel bar welded to his throat. The massed muscles of Norwald's
left arm knotted with effort, and with a sickening snap Zenghi's
wrist bones gave way. The dagger fell from his nerveless hand, and
instantly Norwald caught it up and sank the point into the Atabeg's
breast.</p>

<p>The Turk released the arm that prisoned his throat, and caught
the knife-wrist, but all his desperate strength could not stay the
inexorable thrust. Slowly, slowly, Norwald drove home the keen
point, while the Turk writhed in soundless agony. Approaching
through the mists which veiled his glazing sight, Zenghi saw a
face, raw, torn and bleeding. And then the dagger-point found his
heart and visions and life ended together.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Ousama, unable to sleep, approached the Atabeg's tent, wondering at
the absence of the guardsmen. He stopped short, an uncanny fear
prickling the short hairs at the back of his neck, as a form came
from the pavilion. He made out a tall white-bearded man, clad in
rags. The Arab stretched forth a hand timidly, but dared not touch
the apparition. He saw that the figure's hand was pressed against
its left side, and blood oozed darkly from between the fingers.</p>

<p>"Where go you, old man?" stammered the Arab, involuntarily
stepping back as the white-bearded stranger fixed weird blazing
eyes upon him.</p>

<p>"I go back to the void which gave me birth," answered the figure
in a deep ghostly voice, and as the Arab stared in bewilderment,
the stranger passed on with slow, certain, unwavering steps, to
vanish in the darkness.</p>

<p>Ousama ran into Zenghi's tent&mdash;to halt aghast at sight of
the Atabeg's body lying stark among the torn silks and bloodstained
cushions of the royal divan.</p>

<p>"Alas for kingly ambitions and high visions!" exclaimed the
Arab. "Death is a black horse that may halt in the night by any
tent, and life is more unstable than the foam on the sea! Woe for
Islam, for her keenest sword is broken! Now may Christendom
rejoice, for the Lion that roared against her lies lifeless!"</p>

<p>Like wildfire ran through the camp the word of the Atabeg's
death, and like chaff blown on the winds his followers scattered,
looting the camp as they fled. The power that had welded them
together was broken, and it was every man for himself, and the
plunder to the strong.</p>

<p>The haggard defenders on the walls, lifting their notched stumps
of blades for the last death-grapple, gaped as they saw the
confusion in the camp, the running to and fro, the brawling, the
looting and shouting, and at last the scattering over the plain of
emirs and retainers alike. These hawks lived by the sword, and they
had no time for the dead, however regal. They turned their steeds
aside to seek a new lord, in a race for the strongest.</p>

<p>Stunned by the miracle, not yet understanding the cast of Fate
that had saved Jabar Kal'at and Outremer, Miles du Courcey stood
with Ellen and their Seljuk friend, staring down on a silent and
abandoned camp, where the torn deserted tent flapped idly in the
morning breeze above the bloodstained body that had been the Lion
of Tiberias.</p>
