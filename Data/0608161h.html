<h3>Chapter I UNDERWORLD ELECTIONS</h3>

<p>"You're wanted on the phone, Mr. Ricco. Long distance calling from New York
City."</p>

<p>The big, scar-faced man in a flashy bathing suit turned with a scowl of
annoyance on the pier where he sat sunning himself over the clear blue waters
of Lake Arrowhead.</p>

<p>"Okay, bud," he growled. Getting up, he followed the white-jacketed
attendant past other lolling guests of the quiet Adirondack summer resort to a
chrome-studded, modernistic bath-house. Here, in the indicated private booth,
he lifted a waiting receiver.</p>

<p>"Yeah?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"This 'Scars' Ricco?" came a voice, at once coarse and yet seeming to hold
an acrid, mocking tone.</p>

<p>"Yeah, go ahead!"</p>

<p>"I'm a pal of yours, Scars. Got a little tip for you. Somethin' about what's
been doin' here in N.Y. while you're tannin' that beef of yours&mdash;somethin'
about your mob."</p>

<p>Ricco scowled. But a crafty light showed in his eyes. "Mob?" he echoed
naively. "I don't know what you're talking about."</p>

<p>"Cut the stall, Ricco. Just get this! Your mob's taken a powder on you!
They've all sold out to Monk Gorman&mdash;every one of 'em!"</p>

<p>Ricco's fleshy body stiffened. The diagonal scar on his cheek suddenly stood
out, livid. His voice roared.</p>

<p>"Monk Gorman? Why that cheap, nickel-dipping punk ain't got enough dough to
buy out&mdash;" He broke off, seemed with an effort to steady himself. The scar went
dull again as he gave a harsh laugh. "Well, now cut the kiddin'. Who're you and
what do you want? You're talkin' to a busy man."</p>

<p>Unheeding this, the voice resumed, "Thought I'd get a rise outa you, Scars.
I'm a pal of yours. And listen&mdash;"</p>

<p>When Ricco hung up, his scar was livid again. Eyes blazing, he stormed out
of the bath-house&mdash;only to burst in again, to grab his clothes.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later the stucco, gabled Arrowhead Hotel lost one of its
best-paying guests&mdash;Scars Ricco, a guest who had been no trouble, kept to his
own business, tipped generously. The answer to a management's prayer.</p>

<p>With luggage piled in the rumble seat of his canary-yellow Packard roadster,
Ricco drove down the graveled road, out of the rustic gate, and onto the
highway for New York.</p>

<p>The big roadster gathered speed as it hurled along with muffler open. It
took a long hill, then shot along a level but curved road where white fencing
and signposts warned of a sharp, steep embankment. Ricco, his scar livid,
hunched over the wheel, mouthing oaths in tune to his fierce thoughts. Before
repeal he had controlled the biggest bootleg racket in New York. And he was
still a big shot! He still knew how to hold a mob together and&mdash;He broke off
from his thoughts with a sudden exclamation of alarm. A shadowy shape had
closed in swiftly, overtaking him under cover of his exhaust and was now
crowding him toward the precipice. He had no time to distinguish it; it was
like some Juggernaut bearing down on him.</p>

<p>Ricco's foot left the gas-pedal of his canary roadster. His hand tugged at
the wheel. If he felt terror, his throat had no time to express it. For in the
next instant there was a brief but jarring impact, the scrape of tortured
fenders. There was a kaleidoscopic impression before Ricco's eyes of white
fence-posts swinging towards him, parting crazily, flying to both sides.</p>

<p>The careening roadster crashed through the fence, toppled over the
embankment. It rolled and rolled, while glass broke and metal snapped
groaningly. With a resounding crash the car struck the jagged, stony foot of
the cliff-like embankment. Debris mushroomed up, settled&mdash;</p>

<p>A pall of dreadful silence remained over the wreck.</p>

<p>In the twisted, broken mass which a moment ago had been a sleek yellow
roadster, Scars Ricco sprawled, dead, with broken steering wheel crushed
horribly against his ribs, blood drooling from his parted lips.</p>

<p>Above, on the highway to New York, that lunging shadow, a heavy, dark sedan,
was shrinking speedily down the macadam, leaving the grim, broken fence far
behind.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>At Saratoga, the fifth race was well under way. Dutch Kaltz, comfortably
settled in a grand tier box, grinned as he watched, his rubicund face wrinkled
in satisfied folds around his Havana cigar.</p>

<p>The horses&mdash;thrilling blurs of flying hoofs and huddled jockeys&mdash;were coming
around to the last stretch.</p>

<p>"Boy, oh boy, whatta race!" chortled Dutch Kaltz, his thick lips caressing
the cigar. He turned to his companion, a bored-looking, faded blonde in a
flashy green dress. She was stifling a wearied yawn.</p>

<p>"Listen, baby!" he said to her. "If 'Hot Foot' brings home the bacon, I'll
get you that new mink coat for the winter."</p>

<p>The blonde came out of her trance with a snap that brought her to the very
rail where she promptly shouted with the enthusiasm of a true turf-lover,
<i>"Come on,</i> Hot Foot! Come on home&mdash;come on, Hot Foot!"</p>

<p>As the horses went into the finish stretch, an usher leaned over the box and
slipped a note to Dutch Kaltz.</p>

<p>Annoyed, Kaltz opened it hastily. The cigar dropped from his suddenly gaping
mouth. His eyes bulged at the bold, scrawled words:</p>

<p><i>Your mob's run out to Monk Gorman. Someone's backing him with dough. Better
take this tip from a pal and get busy.</i></p>

<p>Kaltz's rubicund face looked like a bloated moon. With a snarled oath, he
leaped to his feet. Without a word of explanation to his companion, he began
moving his shoulder-padded frame toward the exit of the box.</p>

<p>Simultaneously the crowd in the grandstand went wild with cheers. The human
din drowned out all other sound. The blonde swept from her chair, yelling
joyously as she turned.</p>

<p>"Hot Foot's in, Dutch!" she cried. "Oh Sugar, I can just see myself in
that&mdash;"</p>

<p>She broke off as she saw Dutch Kaltz's vacated chair. Her eyes flashed with
sudden anger across the box, to the exit gate. Then she screamed shrilly,
wildly.</p>

<p>The rubicund figure of Dutch Kaltz lay slumped on the floor just beneath the
exit. Blood lay in a pool around it. There was a blood-fringed hole in the
front of Kaltz's sport coat where the single high-calibred slug had entered,
and done its ghastly work. Dutch Kaltz had seen&mdash;and run&mdash;his last race.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Indian summer had come to New York City. The night was close and warm. The
sky, dull and starless, reflected the bright lights of Manhattan in a vague,
ruddy glow.</p>

<p>On a desolate, deserted side street on the lower west side stood a big brick
garage which looked as if it had not done business for some time. Its
slide-doors were closed, the glass panes covered up so that only dull chinks of
light showed through.</p>

<p>But inside, there was sinister life. A crowd of men stood, smoking
cigarettes, in various attitudes of attention. The light from naked electric
bulbs starkly revealed their hard, coarse-featured faces, their shifty,
ever-alert eyes.</p>

<p>"Okay, boys&mdash;the whole job's been done! An' without a hitch!"</p>

<p>The harsh voice rasped out in the confines of the garage, the voice of a
burly, swart-faced man in a sport-belted slicker. Monk Gorman stood facing the
crowd, his hand nestled smugly in a pocket which showed the protecting bulge of
an automatic.</p>

<p>"You ain't workin', any of you, for your old bosses&mdash;because they just ain't
going to be around any more!" he went on triumphantly. "All four of them are
washed up, see. Kaltz! Ricco! Flowers Gorsh! And Big Boy Rinaldi!"</p>

<p>There was a grim but awed silence. Thugs who, until this night, had worked
for one of those four big king-pins of New York City's underworld, looked
impressed rather than regretful. In the unfeeling underworld there was little
personal sentiment, especially when money flowed freely.</p>

<p>A broken-nosed man spoke then, with a self-important laugh. "Boy, did I
finish Dutch in style! Nobody even heard that silenced gat when I clipped him
from the aisle soon as he blew up over that note."</p>

<p>A pallid-faced, long-jawed thug put in, "Hell, Gus, you shoulda seen me
sideswipe Ricco over that cliff&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cut it, you mugs!" the big man in the slicker snapped out angrily. Again he
addressed the hard-faced gathering.</p>

<p>"Them four babies all got just what was comin' to 'em, see? An' the same
goes for anyone else who thinks he's big shot now! Why? Because you're workin'
for a guy, bigger than any of these punks ever were! A right guy who won't keep
you warmin' park benches while he goes off on vacations! They'll be dough, an'
plenty of it! They'll be dough enough to buy the whole damn town! From now on
we all got one boss&mdash;and we're doin' whatever he tells us, see?"</p>

<p>Eager eyes were fixed on the speaker.</p>

<p>Eager voices rose from the vast interior of the garage.</p>

<p>"Where's th' Big Shot, Monk?"</p>

<p>"Let's meet 'im! Th' dough you jes' passed out from him is like old
times!"</p>

<p>"Is he comin' here, Monk?"</p>

<p>"Whadda we do next?"</p>

<p>Monk Gorman again held up his hand for silence.</p>

<p>"I've already told you guys that th' big shot's been&mdash;well, he's been
sending me orders from where he's been hiding out. Yeah, he's coming to take
personal charge tonight&mdash;about eleven, when the <i>Charlemagne</i> docks. But
he ain't coming to this dump."</p>

<p>He paused and indicated the five bullet-riddled bodies which lay in a
huddled heap in one corner.</p>

<p>"We've jes' finished our first job for him when we cleaned out Rinaldi's
garage here, but we gotta scram. We got one more job to do, and then, if we do
it right, we meet th' new Big Shot in person."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II MURDER BY APPOINTMENT</h3>

<p>Eleven p.m. the clock over the passenger gateway showed the time.</p>

<p>The huge, newly constructed pier on the Hudson River was jammed with people
meeting the late docking S.S. <i>Charlemagne</i> which was nine hours ahead of
its schedule. Private cars and taxis pulled up in turn outside the vast
concrete and steel structure which was three city blocks in length.</p>

<p>In a rather small but handsomely finished office room of the big pier
building which towered above cobblestoned Twelfth Avenue and the newly-built
express highway which flowed north along the western edge of Manhattan,
Inspector Thomas Gregg, chief of the Bureau of Detectives, spoke to seven
elderly men.</p>

<p>"Without disrespect to you, gentlemen," he said gruffly, "I must say this
sounds juvenile and screwy to me. The idea of a super-criminal staging a
come-back after twenty years is ridiculous on the face of it. And there were no
super-criminals twenty years ago. Why, I had one devil of a time even getting
reports from the mid-west on this&mdash;er&mdash;Albert Millett. And look at the picture
I got from Arizona&mdash;a smooth-faced kid with buck teeth. It's so faded you can
scarcely decipher it."</p>

<p>"Inspector Gregg, you are making a grave mistake in taking this matter so
lightly," said Carl Fenwick, the theatrical producer, in a solemn voice. "We
were all young then, some younger than others, and photography was bad. You
didn't know Al Millett. We did."</p>

<p>A sort of psychic shiver seemed to ripple around the group of seven at his
words. Even Inspector Gregg felt it, and the hackles wanted to rise on his
thick, red neck. This made the chief detective mad. He fairly scowled around
the group which half-encircled him.</p>

<p>Seven elderly, influential, wealthy, distinguished men. He told them off
mentally. Now that he thought of it, this was the first time Gregg had ever
been in close contact with any of these prominent men&mdash;the very first time he
had even heard of them appearing publicly together.</p>

<p>Clyde Dickson, gaunt-faced, with dark and brooding eyes, an unusually thick
shock of grey hair on his oddly pointed head, was huddled deep in a leather
armchair. He was the owner of the highly successful Palladium Club&mdash;one of New
York's most luxurious night spots.</p>

<p>Stocky, broad of beam, heavy-jowled, but visibly short of legs despite their
massiveness, Bernard J. Andrews leaned on a beautifully carved cane as rugged
as himself as he stood there. Andrews was the president of a nationally known
radio station.</p>

<p>Paul Corbin, owner and operator of a small chain of exclusive night clubs
and cocktail bars, stood next. Corbin was small, slender, with an effeminate
sort of face out of which looked large, tragic eyes which, in themselves, were
beautiful. He wore loosely tailored tweeds which almost looked too bulky, too
mannish for him.</p>

<p>John Gifford, massive-chested and craggy of features, with arms that were a
trifle abnormal in length, sat beside Dickson and spoke to him in deep
whispers. Gifford was a well-known operator of a huge amusement park at Coney
Island and the designer of the breath-taking Leap-for-Life rocket ride.</p>

<p>Gordon Drake, a well known figure in the motion picture industry, stood
looking out the window. Drake was the most handsomely proportioned man present.
At fifty, his body was still classical in its lines. But he marred the sweep of
his fine figure by wearing a light opera cape about his shoulders. And he
always wore gloves.</p>

<p>Kenneth Meade, a renowned restaurateur, gaunt of feature and spare of frame,
attired in evening clothes for his appearance at Milady's Salon, his newest and
finest restaurant, was tapping on the desk and frowning anxiously.</p>

<p>Fenwick, the seventh man, was a tall, cadaverous individual clad in severe
black and wearing a high, stiff collar which gave him a clerical air. Had he
been funny instead of lugubrious, he could have walked right out on the stage
in any one of his productions as the stage parson.</p>

<p>All of these men were prominent and respected. There was nothing
particularly odd about them individually. But, together, they exerted a queer
effect upon the inspector that was almost weird. It was an intangible feeling.
Perhaps it was due to the fact that these men were noted for living so utterly
alone. None of them were married. Their private lives were simple, retiring,
exclusive. No two of them lived together, except the Marcy brothers, who had
not arrived for this meeting.</p>

<p>Baffled, the inspector shook his head and scowled.</p>

<p>"All right, all right," he said. "Let's go over it again. This Al Millett was
guilty of several minor crimes some twenty-odd years ago. The worst we can find
is that train robbery in Utah, and he served a sentence for that. He called
himself 'The Fang,' theatrically leaving a tiger tooth as a marker on the
scenes of his depredations.</p>

<p>"The penitentiary sentence must have taken the starch out of him. He
abandoned crime upon his release to become a showman. He joined Crowley and
Buckill, the then-famous circus. That was the hey-day of circus business. They
puffed him up as the 'Fang,' the man with the terrible and bloody history and
the criminal mind which, if loosed, could wreck the country. And all he did was
ride wild horses, shoot blank pistols, and generally exhibit himself as the
madman from the gory West.</p>

<p>"That, gentlemen, may have gone over big in those days, but no hick town in
the whole United States would give that sort of side-show attraction a second
glance today.</p>

<p>"And, as for this Al Millett, the police of this day and time have never
even heard of him. I am positive that you are needlessly alarmed over this
twenty-year-old bugaboo&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you don't understand!" broke in Gordon Drake, whirling about at the
window. "We've explained that Millett disappeared suddenly just twenty years
ago&mdash;right after his wife died. He blamed us for her death because we wouldn't
back him in a venture of his own. He disappeared utterly, after swearing
vengeance on us, individually and collectively. And, once a year, on the
anniversary of his wife's death&mdash;for the past three years&mdash;he's been sending us
grotesque warnings of hate and disaster. We showed them to you. They came from
different parts of the world."</p>

<p>"We tried to trace these messages, but we couldn't," John Gifford spoke in
his deep voice. "We thought at first like you are thinking now, but time has
changed us. And this time we received this message which promises death to us,
one at a time. We would have been foolish not to come to the police for
aid."</p>

<p>Inspector Gregg picked up one of the seven copies of identical messages from
"The Fang," and read it again.</p>

<p>In block-printed letters of red on black parchment paper, the words stared
up at him.</p>

<p>MY TIME FOR REVENGE DRAWS NEAR AT LAST ON THIS TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF
BURNOOSE'S DEATH. WHEN THE <i>CHARLEMAGNE</i> DOCKS IN NEW YORK NEXT TRIP YOU SHALL
FEEL THE FANG OF DOOM. ONE BY ONE NINE MEN SHALL DIE&mdash;IF I MAY CALL YOU MEN.
WHO SHALL GO FIRST? I INVITE YUH TO MY DEBARKATION.</p>

<p>Inspector Gregg cleared his throat and glanced swiftly around the circle. He
was surprised to find all seven men watching him in nervous intensity.</p>

<p>"This is theatrical hokum," he snorted. "It stinks of melodrama. I'm amazed
that you let such a crank letter disturb you. And whoever heard of murder by
appointment?"</p>

<p>"Inspector Gregg," said Carl Fenwick in a sepulchral voice, "please bear in
mind that this Al Millett was a far more desperate and depraved character than
you are giving him credit for, and that he hates the nine of us with a
vindictiveness that fairly seethes in its intensity."</p>

<p>"It's too bad the Marcy brothers aren't here to talk to you, Inspector
Gregg," added Paul Corbin in his queer, husky voice. "They knew Millett more
intimately, and can give you fuller details."</p>

<p>"Anyway, we've increased the police guard for the <i>Charlemagne's</i>
docking, and I have a cordon of plainclothes men on hand to apprehend this
Millett guy for questioning and investigation. And you are here to point him out
to us. So we'll pull his 'fangs' before he can even sink 'em in a piece of pie
at the Automat."</p>

<p><i>"If</i> we point him out," observed Kenneth Meade in his stilted, slow,
hoarse manner of speech. "He may be in hiding&mdash;a stowaway. Perhaps he's changed
his appearance&mdash;other men have. He was fiendishly clever with disguise. I
wish&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Marcy brothers!" ejaculated Gordon Drake from the window. "I see their
car just pulling up. They're not getting out, of course."</p>

<p>"Why should they?" commented John Gifford quickly. "The boat's docking. We'd
better get out of here ourselves."</p>

<p>"We'll see what the Marcys say, first," decided Inspector Gregg, leading the
way swiftly out to the parking lanes, the others following him more slowly.</p>

<p>The Marcy car, resplendent with glittering nickel and liveried chauffeur,
was parked in a little cleared space back from the front lines, as if shrinking
from publicity.</p>

<p>In the rear seat, two brothers with faces startlingly similar, save that
Benjamin wore a mustache, while Lyle was clean-shaven, looked out at the
approaching detective. Famous as theatre owners, they shrank from
notoriety.</p>

<p>"Well?" Benjamin Marcy's mustache bristled at the converging group, although
his piercing eyes had the same brooding, world-weary, yet anxious look that all
these worried men seemed to have. "You don't expect us to get out and jam into
that crowd, do you? I'm tired."</p>

<p>"Just tell me in few words what you can about this guy Millett," Gregg spoke
swiftly.</p>

<p>As one, the two brothers leaned forward.</p>

<p>"Al Millett must be a madman," Lyle Marcy stated, his lean face darkening.
"We were all in the show business together many years ago.</p>

<p>"Millett got terribly angry when we wouldn't pool our money and back him in
a crazy wild-west show of his own. His wife died, and he disappeared, after
threatening us with revenge. As for his coming back now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We don't believe it!" Benjamin Marcy broke in fiercely. "This whole thing
is somebody's idea of a bad joke."</p>

<p>"Whose?" demanded Andrews, panting from his laborious exertions to arrive at
the car in a group with the others, leaning heavily on his cane.</p>

<p>"You Marcys know you're as worried about this thing as any of the rest of
us."</p>

<p>"The only thing I'm worried about is the publicity," denied Benjamin Marcy
savagely. "Lyle and I hate publicity!"</p>

<p>The sound of a hoarse, bass siren shook the air around them. Growing
commotion at the docks warned them.</p>

<p>"Come on, you men, and take your positions on the second level," cried
Gregg. "All passengers disembark there. You can't miss your man, if he comes
ashore."</p>

<p>Leaving the grimly waiting Marcy brothers, the group made its way to the
spacious second level where alphabetical partitions awaited tourists and
luggage.</p>

<p>Pulleys creaked, winches groaned, and the huge liner came gently to rest. In
a moment the gangways came sliding down, and people were pouring along them
like ants. A pair of plainclothes officers stood by at each exit, watching for
the chief inspector's signal. Gregg watched the faces of his companions who
went to their appointed stations, staring nervously all along the side of the
great ship and up and down the gangways.</p>

<p>Nothing happened. The stream of passengers dwindled, died away. And no alarm
had been given.</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen," grunted Inspector Gregg a bit peevishly an hour later.
"After all your hullabaloo, your Nemesis doesn't seem to have even got off the
boat. If you can wait another hour, I'll have the ship inspected from stem to
stern to make sure your man is not aboard."</p>

<p>"Please," whispered Meade in his odd articulation. "We must be certain."</p>

<p>"Where's Andrews?" demanded Drake suddenly. "He's supposed to be watching
the D to G section."</p>

<p>"There he is," Gregg pointed. "Guess he just went down to the washroom for a
moment. You haven't seen this building until you tour it. It is conveniently
arranged so that everything is accessible from almost any part of building or
grounds. Well-engineered construction. Well, let's go on board and&mdash;"</p>

<p>The sudden wail of a police ambulance beat upon their eardrums and rose in a
sharp crescendo of sound. Police whistles shrilled. Somewhere a woman screamed.
A uniformed officer dashed up to Inspector Gregg and began murmuring in his
ear. At once Gregg stiffened. He motioned brusquely for the policeman to lead
the way. As they followed, very white of face, the seven elderly men who had
been responsible for him being here tonight fell in line as he passed their
posts, and streamed along after him.</p>

<p>Down in the parking area the night had turned into bedlam. Red-faced
patrolmen were forming lines to keep back the surging crowd and divert traffic.
Screaming sirens announced the arrival of radio and squad cars. Frantic terror
clutched at the hearts of the men following the chief detective as they
realized the direction they were heading.</p>

<p>The Marcy limousine, still in an area of shadows, but no longer avoiding
publicity, was before them. The car itself was harshly outlined now in the
concentrated glare of police hand torches. The first thing of significance that
caught Inspector Gregg's eye was the liveried chauffeur, lolling over his
wheel. The back of his skull was a bloody ruin, bashed in by some blunt
instrument.</p>

<p>The inspector's eyes went to the rear of the car. He braced himself for this
look. The uniformed man had told him what he would find. Even so, hardened to
crime as he was, he recoiled. His usually placid face went grey, eyes widening
in a shock of horror and revulsion.</p>

<p>Benjamin and Lyle Marcy were still together in the back seat, but they had
slumped down. Where their abdomens should have been, there was a gaping hole in
each corpse, in the back of which the very spinal columns were exposed. Blood
and viscera splattered and fouled the seat, the sides, and the floor of the
tonneau.</p>

<p>The faces of the two brothers were frozen in grimaces of agonized horror.
Their sightless, staring eyes seemed still to be looking at the hideous, brutal
death monster that had struck them down. A very bad joke, indeed, Messrs.
Marcy!</p>

<p>Paul Corbin had pushed forward behind the chief detective. He saw, and a
shrill, high-pitched scream left his lips.</p>

<p>"God!" he shrieked. "The Fang! He's killed the Marcys. We told you,
Inspector Gregg&mdash;but you wouldn't believe&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Get a grip on yourself, man!" snapped Gregg curtly. "We'll see about this.
There's been murder, yes; but shut up about this Fang business if you don't
want publicity. You're as jittery as a woman."</p>

<p>He turned to the police captain near at hand. "Okay, Donaldson, boil it down
for me&mdash;quick!"</p>

<p>"Very little, inspector," was the grimly terse answer. "No sound, nobody
seen approaching or leaving the car because all eyes were on the docking
<i>Charlemagne</i>. A late-arriving taxi driver noticed the slumped body of the
chauffeur, took one look, and yelled for help. We are holding him for
questioning. Rather weird, sir."</p>

<p>"Check," nodded Gregg. "I'll say it's weird. No clues?"</p>

<p>"Only this, sir," said the captain, and he held out a large saber tooth&mdash;a
tiger fang. "I found this in the front seat by the chauffeur."</p>

<p>As he stared, Gregg's color drained out of his cheeks. Was it possible,
after all, that Al Millett had come back after a lapse of twenty years to
avenge himself for a fancied wrong?</p>

<p>His eyes went to the big, lighted liner with her rakishly slanted funnels
still smoking at her berth. His men had watched every egress from that vessel.
Seven anxious and determined men had gazed carefully at each disembarking
passenger. After forewarning his victims, had some fantastic, theatrically
inclined madman eluded all detection and slipped ashore to commit his first
murder?</p>

<p>"All right, Donaldson," Gregg spoke. "You're in charge. Get pics, prints,
suspects&mdash;everything you can. I'll go over it with you later. As for you seven
gentlemen, I think, perhaps, you'd better go&mdash;"</p>

<p>A cop from a prowl car dashed up.</p>

<p>"Inspector," he saluted hurriedly, "there's been a near-riot at the Marcy
Gold Slipper. Monk Gorman at the head of a big mob pulled a hijack stunt right
under the noses of the theater crowds. Captain Waltham is over there hollering
for you."</p>

<p>Marcy Gold Slipper! The finest, newest playhouse the Marcy brothers had
built. And Monk Gorman&mdash;Monk Gorman, a muscle-man of no outstanding
intelligence&mdash;had headed a successful robbery there! Robbery at their own
theater while the Marcys themselves got murdered here! It didn't make sense,
didn't tie in with the story of the nine alarmed men at all.</p>

<p>"On second thought," Gregg said to the white-lipped and shivering men behind
him&mdash;towering figures in the entertainment world, but frightened children
beside him now&mdash;"you men had better go home and stay there until you hear from
me again. As soon as I look into both of these crimes closely, I'll get in
touch with each of you. I'll furnish a police escort to see you home, a guard
to stay all night, if you wish."</p>

<p>Paul Corbin, the excitable, laughed hysterically. He was assisted away by
two uniformed officers. His wild cry came back over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"We'll need the whole police force to guard us now, Inspector Gregg," he
shouted sobbingly. "For whoever heard of murder by appointment?"</p>

<h3>Chapter III ENTER THE PHANTOM</h3>

<p>The towering, midtown <i>Clarion</i> Building, which housed the city's
leading newspaper reared high in the night mists. Its windows glowed with
lights; from its lower floors came the pounding of rotary presses&mdash;giving
evidence that here activity went on perpetually, day and night.</p>

<p>It was well after midnight when a large but unobtrusive Cadillac sedan swung
around the corner, its lights dim. It slowed near the chrome and glass doors
which were the imposing front entrance of the <i>Clarion</i> Building.</p>

<p>Four slouch-hatted men peered from the open front and rear windows of the
sedan. Their hat brims, snapped low, obscured their hard, brutal faces.</p>

<p>"Stop right here, Tony." A broken-nosed man leaned forward from the rear to
tap a pallid, nervous driver.</p>

<p>"Okay, Gus!" Tony applied the brakes, but even when he had the car stopped
at the curb, he kept the engine purring. "Hope this ain't gonna take
long&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't be so jittery! This is a cinch!" Gus was leaning from the window,
eyes covering the pavement. Every time a pedestrian neared the front doors of
the building, especially when some hurrying newsman or other person connected
with the paper entered those doors, Gus tensed a little, hand darting to his
armpit holster. "Be ready, guys&mdash;we gotta pull this job smooth!"</p>

<p>"Say, who we gonna smoke?" the hatchet-faced man next to Gus demanded now.
"This is the <i>Clarion's</i> joint, ain't it? Seems to me I heard somethin'
special about this place&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You sure did, Choppy!" the fourth man, in the front, spoke through a gash
of a mouth from which a cigarette dangled to bob with his words. "Hell, the
<i>Clarion's</i> the rag that acts the contact for that bird called <i>the
Phantom!"</i></p>

<p>A strange awed dread followed the pronunciation of that sobriquet&mdash;a dread
which seemed instantly to course through his companions, like a wave. Hate, the
hate born of utter fear, gleamed from their eyes.</p>

<p>The Phantom! Throughout the underworld of the entire nation, that name had
become a byword of fear. The Phantom, lone Nemesis of Crime, a living, elusive
scourge who personified the antidote to crime!</p>

<p>"The Phantom!" Tony cried, hoarsely now. "Say, Gus&mdash;is <i>that</i> who we're
waitin' for?"</p>

<p>Gus quickly shook his head. "Take it easy, guys! The Big Shot ain't
interested in anyone unless he sticks his nose into this&mdash;which he won't if
he's got brains! They say the Phantom made things pretty tough for us, sendin'
so many of us up the river&mdash;but this boss is one guy he can't buck! Naw, we
ain't after that slippery bird. We're just doin' a job on a punk named Eddie
Collins, who draws them funnies you see in the papers."</p>

<p>"Funnies? You mean comic cartoons?" the gash-mouthed man said in surprise.
"Hell, what do we want to bump a guy who draws <i>them</i> for?"</p>

<p>"Maybe the Big Shot don't like his funny pitchers, Pete," Tony put in, with
sardonic mirth.</p>

<p>"You don't know how right you are!" Gus chortled, a purposeful look in his
eyes. "But you just follow my lead&mdash;I'm runnin' this job. 'Course I'd rather be
with Monk and the rest&mdash;they got another big heist job. The boss certainly
knows how to get things movin' fast&mdash;why, he's only taken over the mobs last
night, and we've done more than we did in years for our old big shots! The
coppers'll never keep up with us now! Hell, there was hundreds of 'em down at
that pier when the boat landed, and right under their noses&mdash;" he paused, as if
realizing he was getting loquacious.</p>

<p>But the others broke in eagerly now. "You was there, Gus. Did you see
him?"</p>

<p>The broken-nosed Gus swelled instinctively with a sense of importance.
"Sure," his voice was unconvincingly casual. "Sure I seen him."</p>

<p>"What'd he look like, Gus? What kinda guy was he?"</p>

<p>"Well now&mdash;he was kinda muffled up in a coat. Couldn't spot his mug. But I
seen his work&mdash;and that was enough! What he done to them two brothers, all by
himself&mdash;" Despite himself he gave a shudder. "Don't know how the hell he done
it. I'd sure hate to be on the wrong side o' that guy, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Abruptly he broke off, body tensing, hand snaking from his armpit holster. A
taxi had just pulled to the curb, ahead of the parked sedan. Out of it leaped a
figure, turning in the gloom as the cab rolled on its way.</p>

<p>The figure strode down the pavement towards the <i>Clarion</i> entrance.
Light from a street-lamp revealed him in the next instant. A stocky young man,
hardly more than a grown kid&mdash;he was walking hurriedly, carrying a flat
envelope under one arm.</p>

<p>"It's the Collins guy all right!" Gus spoke quick, low. "Okay, Tony! Step up
that motor&mdash;he's comin' by! Me an' Pete'll use the rods."</p>

<p>Oblivious, the youth on the pavement walked on&mdash;coming diagonally abreast of
the sedan in the next instant as two automatics trained their beads directly on
his hurrying figure.</p>

<p>"Okay, Tony!"</p>

<p>The purring motor of the Cadillac rose abruptly to a vibrating clamor as
Tony's foot jammed down the accelerator. The two guns leveled from the front
and rear windows. Flame leaped livid in the night from their jerking
muzzles!</p>

<p>The motor almost drowned completely the quick reports, so they were not
heard by any passing motorists.</p>

<p>The four shots flamed in swift succession.</p>

<p>As if grabbed by some unseen giant hand in the dark, the youth on the
pavement stopped in his tracks. His stocky frame whirled completely around. His
hands clutched at his chest&mdash;and through his clawing fingers blood spurted
darkly.</p>

<p>Slowly, his knees buckled. He dropped on them. In contrast to the darkness,
his face showed white, agonized as it turned towards the roaring but immobile
sedan.</p>

<p>Then a choking cry as of defiance came from the youngster. He still clutched
the manila envelope&mdash;and some miracle of purpose seemed to spur his riddled
body into motion again. Crablike, half-crawling in the gloom, he was moving
forward.</p>

<p>The broken-nosed Gus saw that movement, gave vent to a livid oath. He yanked
the rear door of the Cadillac open, his eyes peering up and down the street. It
was dark, deserted. He leaped out, gun in hand. Pete and hatchet-faced Choppy
followed.</p>

<p>Simultaneously the riddled youth, evidently seeing them coming, was
suddenly, miraculously on wabbly legs&mdash;running, darting like a wild, wounded
animal, instinctively trying to lose himself from his hunters.</p>

<p>Clutching the envelope he actually reached the corner, rounding the building
as the others gained in their pursuit. They did not fire now&mdash;for their quarry
was only a vague blur in the almost opaque gloom caused by the shadowy side of
the building, near a railed areaway.</p>

<p>In that gloom, Gus, Pete, and Choppy closed in. Their hands groped. There
was the sound of a scuffle&mdash;the ripping of paper&mdash;confusion.</p>

<p>The three gangsters became accustomed enough to the dark to regain vision.
They found themselves in a tangle.</p>

<p>Gus cursed. "He went over the rail! He can't get far with them slugs in
him&mdash;an' I don't know if we got all we want! Come on, guys, we gotta find
him!"</p>

<p>They climbed over the rail, dropping into the lower areaway. Groping in the
gloom, guns still in hand.</p>

<p>And at that same instant, Eddie Collins, youthful cartoonist, was swaying
against the cage of a freight elevator which was speeding upwards inside the
building. He heard his own blood dripping to the floor of the ascending lift.
Torpor was dragging at his agonized body. Yet, like some stubborn spark, a
fierce determination was keeping him alive and active.</p>

<p>Floors went by in a blur, painfully slow. Up through the building the
elevator ascended. Then it stopped of its own accord, on the top floor, up in
the tower.</p>

<p>Collins pulled his coat about his chest as if hoping to stem the flow of his
own blood. He groaned with the effort of opening the gate, staggered out
through a corridor, thence through swing service doors.</p>

<p>Somehow he found the frosted-glass doors he sought. He pushed into a
lighted, well-appointed anteroom. He pushed on through, reached another door,
marked private.</p>

<p>Eddie Collins grabbed the door handle&mdash;burst into the huge, private office
whose French windows looked high over the Manhattan night.</p>

<p>At his rude entry, two men jerked up startled, surprised heads.</p>

<p>Frank Havens, elderly, rugged-faced owner of the <i>Clarion</i> and a string
of other equally powerful papers throughout the nation, rose to his feet from
the big desk where he had been sitting, proof-sheets bearing gruesome
murder-news before him.</p>

<p>Richard Curtis Van Loan, wealthy young idler and man-about-town, who was
here as Mr. Havens's friend and guest, lifted his bored, world-wearied grey
eyes in questioning annoyance. Seated in a comfortable chair, Van Loan was
puffing idly at a cigarette, his immaculately dress-trousered legs crossed.</p>

<p>Then, before anyone could speak, the bored Richard Curtis Van Loan suddenly
leaped from his chair. His grey eyes lost their ennui, became sharp slits. It
was he who saw the oozing, crimson trickle coming from beneath Collins's coat
and dripping soundlessly to the soft carpet.</p>

<p>Collins's body swayed giddily as Van Loan leaped forward. The latter's
strong arms reached out, caught the young cartoonist even as the youth went
limp, collapsing.</p>

<p>"This man's been shot!" Van Loan said, his customary drawl sharp now.</p>

<p>Havens's momentary annoyance turned to quick alarm. The publisher grabbed an
inter-office phone, called a downstairs office secretary, ordering that a doctor
be summoned. Then he went over to where Van Loan had carried the riddled youth
to a lounge and placed him on it.</p>

<p>"Collins!" he cried, all concern now. "What happened? Who&mdash;?"</p>

<p>The eyes of Eddie Collins, already going dull, flickered. His lips moved. A
sighing rattle made the words which came from his throat difficult to hear.</p>

<p>"Envelope&mdash;" he gasped. "Envelope! Gangsters&mdash;probably still down in areaway
cellar looking for me. Freight elevator&mdash;They got it&mdash;from me&mdash;but they aren't
sure&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Got what, Collins? What do you mean?" Havens spoke with fierce bafflement.
"How could you&mdash;a comic strip man&mdash;be mixed up with thugs, with shooting!"</p>

<p>"Envelope tells," Collins repeated. "Big case&mdash;Mr. Havens. I was doing it
for a feature&mdash;when murder story broke. Bringing it for&mdash;the Phantom&mdash;now."</p>

<p>Even in his agony, he pronounced that name with reverent awe.</p>

<p>Havens stiffened. The publisher's eyes flashed to his worldly young friend,
Richard Curtis Van Loan. And he got a fresh shock of surprise.</p>

<p>For Van Loan had suddenly gone into a whirl of swift action! He had peeled
off his dress coat. In his hands was a flat leather kit, which was snapped
open, to reveal a mirror and an array of tubes and jars.</p>

<p>Again Collins's gasping voice interrupted. "Case&mdash;for Phantom! God, if only
you could&mdash;get him now, Mr. Havens." He sobbed. "Envelope&mdash;thugs got it&mdash;"</p>

<p>Havens administered to the riddled man as best he could while Van Loan
worked away on his queer little kit.</p>

<p>When the publisher turned toward Van Loan, his jaw gaped.</p>

<p>Van, standing close, eyes darting from the man on the lounge to his own
mirror, was still dabbing his face with a special charcoal. In seconds his
handsome, world-weary features had almost completely vanished! In their place
had grown another visage&mdash;the face of Eddie Collins!</p>

<p>It was not a semblance that could stand close inspection under bright light,
being more an impressionistic sort of job, the likeness cleverly created by a
few lines, by shading. Nor did Van Loan take any more precious time adding to
it.</p>

<p>"Give me Collins's coat, Frank&mdash;quickly! It ought to be enough!"</p>

<p>Van Loan pulled on the coat and assumed a stoop. Though he was tall, he
seemed by his posture to look even more like the bullet-riddled cartoonist.</p>

<p>So swiftly had he made the transformation that now, before the dying Collins
saw what was happening, his own "double" was darting out of the office in a
swift blur of motion which concealed both the incongruity of his dress, and his
makeshift disguise.</p>

<p>Collins hadn't seen any of this. Nor had Collins dreamed that Richard Curtis
Van Loan, the rich playboy he had seen so many times, was actually the
mysterious and amazing sleuth whose fearsome name he had breathed, whose
services he had demanded&mdash;<i>the Phantom Detective</i> whose perilous exploits
in the dark byways of the underworld were known by the police the world
over.</p>

<p>Only Frank Havens knew that Van Loan was the Phantom; only Havens knew how
this seemingly bored young millionaire really gave his energies and lifeblood
to the most exacting and dangerous task on earth&mdash;the tracking down of baffling
and ruthless criminals.</p>

<p>Even to Havens, the Phantom was always a source of surprise and wonder. His
quick-working brain was too fast to follow: his quick changes in disguise left
the publisher gasping&mdash;as they had left him now.</p>

<p>Yet Van had acted with logic while acting with speed. Snatches of barely
coherent speech from Eddie Collins had registered themselves indelibly on his
mind: Freight elevator&mdash;thugs&mdash;still looking for Collins&mdash;</p>

<p>The Phantom scarcely knew Collins, only vaguely remembered seeing the
youthful cartoonist around the <i>Clarion</i> Building. Certainly he had no
idea what this was all about. As a matter of fact, his mind had been on other
matters&mdash;on a bizarre, double murder which Frank Havens had called him down to
discuss. But when Collins had come in, riddled&mdash;bringing crime flagrantly to
this very building&mdash;Van had promptly dropped all other thoughts.</p>

<p>The Phantom reached the freight elevator, with its blood-stained floor, in
the next instant. His lithe body pushed into the car&mdash;his long arm slammed the
gate shut and started the elevator down. He reached into his pocket, into which
he had transferred a fully loaded blue-steel Colt .45 automatic, U.S. Army,
M-1911&mdash;the favorite weapon of the Phantom.</p>

<p>Musty odors of the cellar rose to engulf the slow-descending cage. The
Phantom tensed, adopting again the pose of Eddie Collins. His hand was on his
gun, his thumb snapping back the safety catch. He knew he was deliberately
playing with Death in his risky scheme.</p>

<p>The cellar loomed, dim and empty. Nobody in here. He hurried across it on
soft-soled feet, eyes alert. Reaching the door of the areaway, he opened it
softly. Night breeze, still carrying the heat of the Indian summer, met
him.</p>

<p>He was out in the areaway like a drifting shadow. In the gloom his keen
eyes, which had the cat-like gift of piercing darkness, glanced about. No one
here. A surge of disappointment, a sense of anticlimax, narrowed his eyes.
Despite his swiftness, had he been too long in coming?</p>

<p>He vaulted over the rail then, to the street. Cautiously, again emulating
Collins&mdash;even staggering a little now&mdash;he moved down the block. The nearest
street-lamp flecked his face. He caught a blur of movement and he dropped to
the pavement like a deflating sack. Dropped as his every nerve combined in
sixth sense to flash the warning to his alert brain!</p>

<p>Two guns flamed livid out of the dark, their reports shattering the quiet
side street off Broadway. Bullets whined over the prone Phantom as he hugged
the sidewalk. They ricocheted inches away, chipping the paving.</p>

<p>"Got him this time, Gus?"</p>

<p>"Better make sure!"</p>

<p>Van rolled as he heard the coarse voices. He saw three slouch-hatted figures
charging from another dark doorway of the building, where they had been
prowling.</p>

<p>His Colt snaked out. Eyes grim, he fired even as he rolled into position&mdash;a
blind, snap shot at the charging trio.</p>

<p>One of the three, a gash-mouthed man, recoiled with a scream of pain. His
hand clawed at his shoulder, blood spurting through the wound.</p>

<p>The other two also recoiled, amazed by the counter-attack. The broken-nosed
man in their lead stared at the Phantom, who even now was leaping to his
feet.</p>

<p>Madly he fired his automatic&mdash;fired as a suddenly panic-stricken man would
fire.</p>

<p>Van ducked sideways, out of the lamp-light. The bullets went so far wide he
didn't hear them. Not only was the man's apparent confusion spoiling his
aim&mdash;in his left hand he was busily clutching a manila envelope! The Phantom
grimly raised his Colt again. He drew a careful bead on the man with the
envelope.</p>

<p>"Beat it, guys!" the third man was yelling. "The shootin's been heard&mdash;The
cops're comin'!"</p>

<p><i>Crack!</i></p>

<p>It was Van's Colt that blazed in that split-second.</p>

<p>A hoarse cry burst from the broken-nosed thug. As if it suddenly burned him,
he dropped the envelope. It fluttered to the pavement. The Phantom's well-aimed
shot had creased his wrist&mdash;making his pained muscles release their grip.</p>

<p>Across Broadway now two bluecoats came into view&mdash;a traffic and a beat cop,
blowing their whistles, reaching with free hands for guns. The scream of a
prowl-car added to the clamor.</p>

<p>Van hurled forward. The broken-nosed thug, nursing his wrist with his mouth,
hesitated. Then, leaving the envelope, dashed on around the corner.</p>

<p>The Phantom scooped the envelope up without stopping in his pace. Rounding
the corner, he saw the trio piling into a dark Cadillac sedan which started
rolling from the curb in the next split-second, gears grinding raucously. Van
leaped after it, then ducked.</p>

<p>Glass in the rear window shattered as a gun smashed its muzzle through. A
fusillade of lead came from the departing car as it careened around the next
block, swiftly disappearing. An oncoming green prowl-car sped in pursuit.</p>

<p>The Phantom, already grimly certain the gang car had had enough of a start
to make a safe getaway, whirled back toward the <i>Clarion</i> Building,
envelope in hand. He moved so swiftly that the police did not see him.</p>

<p>Again he used the freight elevator, riding back to the tower. The Phantom
had struck again and disappeared.</p>

<h3>Chapter IV GARGOYLE CLUE</h3>

<p>Van Loan entered the private office. He saw Frank Havens standing, eyes
filled with deep pain. A grave-faced man he recognized as the <i>Clarion's</i> doctor
was turning away from the lounge where Eddie Collins lay very still, a glassy
look in his eyes.</p>

<p>The doctor shook his head. Then started as he saw the dead man's double in
the doorway.</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed, Doctor," said Van in Collins's voice. "The Phantom&mdash;not a
ghost. Will you leave us, please?"</p>

<p>The physician left and Van quickly shut the door. He glanced at Collins.
"Too bad, Frank&mdash;he seemed a plucky kid," his voice came hushed.</p>

<p>Havens spoke huskily. "I can't understand it, Van! Collins was just a comic
strip man, a hard ambitious worker. Why he should be murdered like this&mdash;" He
broke off then, with new concern. "But you, Van! What have you been doing? Did
you see his murderers?"</p>

<p>"I did, and drew a little blood," Van returned grimly, as he substituted
Collins's coat for his own. His long arm scooped up Havens's phone.
Matter-of-factly, he put in a call to the police. "My deception worked for a
moment. The gangsters were lurking, thinking Collins was hidden somewhere down
there. The police are after them now. I guess they'll be coming up here any
minute. Before they come, let's see what we can make of this envelope."</p>

<p>Quickly he took it to Havens's desk. Its flap was loose. Evidently hands had
already been rummaging in it. For a moment the Phantom thought, with a pang of
disappointment, that it was empty. Then he drew out its only contents&mdash;a single
torn piece of white paper. Black pen&mdash;sketching and lettering showed on it.</p>

<p>"Seems to be some sort of cartooning!" Van observed. "Collins's work,
apparently."</p>

<p>He spread it on the desk, and Havens came over to peer at it with him. The
first thing that met their eyes was a bizarre ink-sketch. It showed a skull, a
lurid death's head, and beneath it a playing card&mdash;a joker.</p>

<p>Letters printed underneath read: <i>"Impossible but true is the Gargoyle
Club, which sometimes meets secretly at&mdash;"</i></p>

<p>Here the paper was torn, the rest of the sentence missing.</p>

<p>"Gargoyle Club?" Havens read aloud. "What can <i>that</i> be? And that joker
and skull?"</p>

<p>The publisher broke off, the blood suddenly draining from his face. For now
his eyes had fallen on three other ink sketches which comprised the remainder
of the torn cartoon.</p>

<p>One of the three was torn, not clearly distinguishable. But the other two
were full and clear. Two faces, both similar, save that one bristled with a
mustache while the other was clean-shaven, stared up at them.</p>

<p>With one accord the eyes of Havens and Van Loan went from that cartoon to
the wet front-page proof-sheet on Havens's desk.</p>

<p>There, in a photograph this time, those two same faces stared out of the
front page, beneath the bold black headline:</p>

<p>TWO SHOWMEN BRUTALLY MURDERED</p>

<p>"Good grief!" Havens gasped, his face white now. "The Marcy brothers!
Collins drew them here! That's the sensational case I was trying to persuade
you to tackle, Van! The case involving all those big men of the amusement
world&mdash;the nine who told the police of this criminal, Al Millett, the Fang&mdash;who
apparently came to America on the <i>Charlemagne</i> tonight&mdash;last night. It's
nearly morning."</p>

<p>Van's eyes narrowed to slits. His keen mind had absorbed the facts of the
strange case. The shake-up of four mobs preceding the landing of the ship&mdash;the
newly organized mob of four dead leaders suddenly cutting loose&mdash;the police
baffled by a terrific outbreak of crime and violence. And now&mdash;this!</p>

<p>"It seems this case had landed on us personally, Frank," he said grimly.
"It's reached out and hit the <i>Clarion</i>! But look here. The murder was
just a few hours ago, correct? And until now these men involved had not come
forward into the limelight."</p>

<p>"That's right! And for some reason, Collins drew a picture&mdash;maybe he hoped
it would break into the news section&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's the point, Frank," Van said slowly. "Collins did <i>not</i> just
draw this picture. Or even last night! The ink on it indicates clearly that
it's at least a week or so old!"</p>

<p>"But, Van!" Havens protested. "That means Collins must have known something
of the Marcys before anyone dreamed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Precisely. Can you suggest any way he might have worked on such a
tack?"</p>

<p>"I can't even hazard a guess, Van. Collins stuck to his cartooning in the
comic strip. True, I remember his saying something about changing his line&mdash;but
as for this drawing, with its skull and joker, and that stuff about the
Gargoyle Club&mdash;" Confused, his grim eyes went to the lounge&mdash;as if bitterly
wishing for the death-sealed lips of Eddie Collins to speak the secret that
they could never now reveal.</p>

<p>Van, meanwhile, looked at the third and torn face on the cartoon. Only the
top of the head and the eyes showed.</p>

<p>"Look here, Frank. Something queer about this picture."</p>

<p>Havens, looking, noticed a blackish protrusion on top of the head, as though
the cartoonist's pen had slipped. "An ink-blot probably," he said. "Makes it
look as if something is sticking in the head there. Funny&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off, stiffening, as heavy feet sounded at the office door. Van Loan
swiftly took a black silk domino from his pocket and slipped it on over his
Collins make-up.</p>

<p>A bluecoat, followed by two men in plainclothes, entered. One of the latter
spoke, eyes instantly going with recognition to the publisher.</p>

<p>"There's been some shooting in the street, Mr. Havens. Was that why you
called Police Head&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped short as his eyes glimpsed the prone, inert body of Collins. That
was his first surprise. His second came as he and the other two policemen saw
the domino-masked Phantom, who now stepped forward, eyes gleaming through his
mask-holes.</p>

<p>"It's all right, gentlemen. I called. I'm the Phantom&mdash;already on the case."
As he spoke his palm flipped open.</p>

<p>The two detectives and the bluecoat stared in awe at the scintillating
sparkle which was revealed. A sparkle of matchless diamond chips, forming the
design of a domino mask against a badge of platinum.</p>

<p>The emblem of the Phantom! An emblem which every law-enforcement agent
throughout the nation had been taught to respect.</p>

<p>Van gave crisp commands. "You can take over here. Conduct the usual
investigation. Call Homicide and the Medical Examiner. This man is Edward
Collins, who worked for Mr. Havens and&mdash;"</p>

<p>The shrill buzz of the inter-office telephone interrupted. Havens quickly
snapped the key, picking up the instrument. "Hello&mdash;yes?" He turned. "Is one of
you men Lieutenant Donovan? Patrolman downstairs is asking for you."</p>

<p>The larger of the two detectives grabbed the instrument with a gruff,
"Thanks."</p>

<p>"Yes?" he said. <i>"What's that?</i> Okay&mdash;be right down!"</p>

<p>He whirled from the phone, his face beefy with excitement. "Radio flash!
Signal 30! There's a stick-up at the Palladium Club!"</p>

<p>Van tensed even as Havens looked momentarily bewildered. In his social life,
as a night-club habitue, he knew about the Palladium, the most popular of
hot-spots. But his keen retentive mind was telling him something else.</p>

<p>"That's Clyde Dickson's club, Frank!" he crisped. "Dickson&mdash;one of the nine
men involved in this case!"</p>

<p>He whirled on the detectives. "You two men stay here! Officer, you come with
us. Is there a cruiser downstairs?"</p>

<p>The detectives nodded.</p>

<p>"All right, Mr. Havens and I will use it!"</p>

<p>It was the regular express elevator which took the Phantom, Havens, and the
bluecoat down to the street level. Hurriedly they ran out to the curb. Two
prowl-cars were pulling away, sirens screaming. The cruiser, a small sedan,
stood purring, a police driver impatiently shifting at its wheel, the radio
blaring repeatedly: "Signal 30! All cars in Division 1&mdash;"</p>

<p>The bluecoat with Van explained. And it was unnecessary for the Phantom
again to display his badge. An instant later, with Van and Havens in the rear,
the cruiser sped screaming through the night, headed up Broadway.</p>

<p>As it approached the fifties, the scream of other sirens became audible
ahead. The cruiser tore around Fifty-Second Street&mdash;agleam at this late hour
with its line of nightclubs, all going full tilt.</p>

<p>The cruiser squealed on its tires, as it came before the vast neon sign:
"Palladium Club." Prowl-cars here were banked two deep&mdash;but some were speeding
off, hell-bent. From within the club came sounds of pandemonium.</p>

<p>"Better stay here awhile, Frank!" Van crisped, as he leaped from the
cruiser.</p>

<p>The Phantom, together with police who were still rushing into the club,
hurried through its palatial entrance.</p>

<p>Many times, as Richard Van Loan, bored socialite, he had gone into this
lavish club. He knew its interior well. Yet as he rushed in now, he scarcely
recognized it.</p>

<p>The well-appointed hall of the club looked as if a cyclone had struck it.
Though wall lights illumined the place, the huge chandelier which had furnished
the main light was shattered where it hung.</p>

<p>On the dance floor, tables and chairs were overturned. The band dais was a
confusion of tumbled instruments, overturned music stands. Above, swinging
crazily and incongruously, was a brilliant-studded but empty trapeze on
ropes.</p>

<p>Van identified it at once; he remembered that the main attraction of this
club was an aerial artiste&mdash;a young girl known only as "Queen Stella" who
furnished a new thrill to jaded society crowds with her acrobatics.</p>

<p>All this Van's eyes took in with a swift comprehensive glance. Then his gaze
went across the floor. He saw a huddling, terrified mass of people. Women in
low-cut gowns; men in faultless dress suits. All jabbering with that hysterical
excitement that comes after a crisis.</p>

<p>"My jewels&mdash;they took my jewels!" he heard a woman shrieking.</p>

<p>"They got away with my wallet, damn them!" a man cursed.</p>

<p>Police were listening sympathetically. Other police were scurrying about the
floor, taking command of the exclusive club. Some Van saw at exit doors,
shaking their heads.</p>

<p>The Phantom realized, even as Frank Havens now came up behind him, that he
had come just after the end of the stick-up. The mobsters had obviously cleared
out.</p>

<p>"Since we are here, let's look around," said the Phantom. "Where is
Dickson?"</p>

<p>No one had seen the club owner since the excitement began.</p>

<p>Frank Havens saw the Phantom hurl suddenly forward&mdash;running toward Dickson's
office.</p>

<p>Van's dash carried him to a rear door, so well shadowed behind drapes that
as yet the police had not noticed it.</p>

<p>The door was closed. But as the Phantom neared it, sounds behind it grew
louder. And then not only Van, but several nearby policemen, stiffened&mdash;eyes
going wide.</p>

<p>From behind the closed door came a sudden, hoarse scream! A scream which
rose, in blood-curdling agony and terror!</p>

<p>"You!" the scream came. "It's you! No!" Shrill now it rose, in a high,
quavering pitch. "Don't&mdash;Oh, God&mdash;<i>don't</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>Even as the Phantom yanked at the locked door, that agonized cry broke off
with horrible abruptness. There was a ghastly thud&mdash;a shatter as of glass.</p>

<p>Eyes slitted in their mask-holes, the Phantom whirled to the men behind him.
"Give me a hand!" he crisped. "Get this door open!"</p>

<h3>Chapter V THE FANG STRIKES AGAIN</h3>

<p>Brawny bluecoats promptly charged that door. Wood splintered with the
successive impacts of their big shoulders. The door burst from its lock. The
Phantom, gun whipping out, was the first to leap into the room, police
following at his heels.</p>

<p>In one swift comprehensive glance, Van's eyes took in the scene. Three
sights stood out at once. A safe, its door open and still swinging, its
interior bare and gaping; a broken window, looking out into black gloom;
and&mdash;on the floor&mdash;a prone heap, lying terribly still.</p>

<p>The Phantom rushed to the broken window. Outside was an alleyway, but it led
to a high, dead-end wall. His keen eyes told him that no one was there,
although as he backed away, policemen climbed through the window with
flashlights and guns to investigate.</p>

<p>Van darted back through the room. He found two more doors. One, unlocked,
gave upon the street in front of the night club with its milling confused
throngs. The other seemed to lead to the orchestra dais. He turned back to the
corpse.</p>

<p>Gasped, sickened exclamations rose as patrolmen and detectives looked down
at the inert heap on the floor. Looking up, the Phantom saw the rugged face of
Frank Havens. He had never seen the publisher so pale, so fraught with lines of
utter horror and shock. Havens's eyes, stark and wide, were fixed in awful
fascination on that inert heap.</p>

<p>The Phantom studied the body closely. His first brief glance had already
determined that the man was Clyde Dickson, wealthy, gaunt owner of this club;
and that Dickson was as dead as any man could be.</p>

<p>The corpse was sprawled on its back. The eyes stared up, sightless and
glazed. The gaunt features of Clyde Dickson looked unreal, as if they were some
frozen snapshot of a face caught in a moment of unutterable agony and terror.
Beneath the disheveled mop of hair on the night club owner lay a small wet pool
of crimson blood.</p>

<p>No bullet had killed Clyde Dickson. No knife had stabbed him. The Phantom
saw now why the police were looking down sickened, and why, especially, Frank
Havens was staring in such an uncanny, horrified manner.</p>

<p><i>For something dark and long was protruding from the top of the dead man's
skull!</i></p>

<p>Van's own nerves went cold. His hand instinctively touched his pocket, where
the torn drawing of the hapless Eddie Collins crackled. Incredibly, weirdly, a
portion of that drawing had become accurately simulated by the corpse in this
room! That one, torn face, with something blackish protruding from the
head&mdash;something Havens had called an ink-stain!</p>

<p>Grim-eyed, the Phantom stepped forward, bent down. He saw the protruding
thing for what it was. A broken length of iron crowbar. A crowbar, large and
thick, had been driven somehow through the skull of Clyde Dickson&mdash;through
scalp and bone, into the brains beneath!</p>

<p>"Good God!" Havens started to gasp in horror. The Phantom's mask flashed up
blackly; through its holes his eyes darted a tacit command to the publisher.
Havens quickly turned away, silent.</p>

<p>"Say, in all my time I never saw anything like this!" It was a square-jawed
captain of detectives who spoke now, hoarsely. "Hell, we heard him being
killed&mdash;but how could anyone drive a bar like that through a man's skull, all
in seconds too! And what devil&mdash;"</p>

<p>Even as he voiced the chill question, the Phantom, eyes sharpening anew,
quietly pointed to the floor, to a spot about a foot away from that gruesome,
crowbar-riven head.</p>

<p>A small object lay there, hideously familiar to the police, though Van
himself looked at it for the first time.</p>

<p><i>It was a white saber tooth!</i></p>

<p>"The Fang!" Several police voices chorused in grim unison. "The Fang
again!"</p>

<p>Twice in one night, since the arrival of the <i>Charlemagne</i>, an
elusive, diabolical murderer had struck&mdash;struck under the very noses of the
police, leaving his flaunting mark of death! And his second crime outdid the
first in sheer, bloody mutilation!</p>

<p>The detective captain bawled out, in fierce rage: "This Fang can't be far
away, damn him! We've got his description! We must get him!"</p>

<p>His eyes swiveled to the broken window then, for, as if to answer his words,
wearied bluecoats were climbing back in, shaking their heads. "No one in that
dead-end alley," one reported. "And no one but a human fly could climb that
wall."</p>

<p>"Or a human devil!" the captain added.</p>

<p>Van's voice, cool despite his inner tension, came like a sane note in the
raw-nerved agitation. "The breaking window might well have been a bit of
decoying," he suggested. "The criminal might have gone out that door to the
street to mingle with the crowd. Or he might have re-entered the night club,
using that other door concealed by the orchestra dais."</p>

<p>This sent the police hunting in new directions. Some went out to the street;
others hurried into the night club proper, where the patrons and employees,
here since the big holdup, still stood, huddled and frightened.</p>

<p>The Homicide Squad arrived in the next seconds, faces already wearied from
the work of the first murder. The City Medical Examiner came with Inspector
Gregg, detective chieftain, whose own placid face was now looking dull grey,
his eyes bloodshot and haggard.</p>

<p>"So you're in the case, Phantom!" The inspector, after grimly viewing the
corpse, faced the man in the domino mask. "Maybe you can help us out&mdash;though
really this case seems open-and-shut. If only we can get our hands on Al
Millett!" He swore harshly. "I've been getting headaches from reports from
every precinct, and a lot of well-meaning cranks as well. Every Tom, Dick, and
Harry has been taken for Millett&mdash;but the right man is still loose, running the
big mob organized tonight. He seems to be getting a crazy revenge by robbing
and killing in this mad way!"</p>

<p>Shaken, he glanced again towards the corpse. The Medical Examiner was
kneeling over the dead man now, his face pale despite his familiar
acquaintanceship with death. "Well, Doc?"</p>

<p>The examiner raised baffled eyes.</p>

<p>"Beats me!" he confessed, crisply. "The Marcy brothers case was bad
enough&mdash;obviously killed with some sort of ax. But a crowbar&mdash;I never saw it
used this way in a murder! Can't see how a man could be strong enough to smash
it through the cranium!"</p>

<p>The Phantom spoke a quiet question. "Do you think the crowbar was driven in
with one blow, Doctor?"</p>

<p>The doctor shook his head. "Can't tell how it was driven in, Phantom. The
whole upper cranium is shattered; there was a bad internal hemorrhage."</p>

<p>Van turned to the inspector. "Can you offer any possible reason,
inspector&mdash;from what those men told you at the pier&mdash;for the murderer killing
in this fashion?"</p>

<p>The inspector wiped sick perspiration from his brow. "They claimed Millett
had a grudge against them because they once refused to back him in a show. And
that he had a criminal mind which ran amuck. That ballyhoo he used in his
exhibitions twenty years ago, must be true&mdash;that he's a born criminal, a
killer."</p>

<p>Van nodded, his eyes thoughtful as he listened to these theories.</p>

<p>Then, as fingerprint men and other experts of the Homicide took possession
of the room, the Phantom, Havens, and the inspector strode out into the night
club proper.</p>

<p>Here, other detectives had garnered a wealth of evidence from the frightened
patrons and employees, who had not been informed of the murder so close at
hand. They gave the inspector their reports.</p>

<p>The holdup itself had been quite orthodox. It had been led by a big man in a
slicker with a tommy gun&mdash;a man identified by the police as Monk Gorman. The
gangsters had shot out the chandelier and escaped through windows and doors
when sirens sounded, someone having managed to summon the police.</p>

<p>No one had seen anybody go into the rear office, or out of it. The murder
had apparently been an aftermath of the robbery in which jewels and money
running into thousands, according to the claims of the victims, had been
filched.</p>

<p>There was one queer element about the holdup, however. No one had seen the
actual entrance of the gangsters. The reason was that all had been watching the
girl on the trapeze.</p>

<p>Their eyes had literally been magnetized by that act, for at the moment the
girl had been performing a daring somersault. Her grip on the trapeze had
faltered, and it seemed she would fall.</p>

<p>Van's sharp eyes studied the dangling, studded trapeze he had noticed when
he first entered.</p>

<p>"That was Queen Stella," the Phantom said aloud to the inspector. "The most
remarkable aerialist of today, and rather a mystery herself. I wonder if she
really faltered, or whether that wasn't just a clever part of her act."</p>

<p>The inspector had already quizzed the workers here. No one had seen Queen
Stella since she was on the trapeze.</p>

<p>The inspector's eyes were narrowed. "Begins to look as if she sneaked out on
us. And you say that losing her grip stuff might have been part of her act?
Damned convenient if it was&mdash;it got everyone's eye when the holdup men came
in."</p>

<p>The patrons of the night club were beginning to protest their detention.
Presently one of them, a tall, dress-suited man, strode angrily forward to
confront the inspector. Van's eyes went to him keenly. Tall, swarthy, with a
short, but wide-spreading beard of black, bristly hair, he had a foreign
aspect. His eyes were sharp and hard.</p>

<p>"May I ask permission to leave at once?" His English was flawless, the
too-clear English which a well-educated foreigner speaks. "This detention is
most distressing to me. To be robbed is enough."</p>

<p>The inspector eyed him in distaste. "Who are you?"</p>

<p>The man made a stiff little bow. "I am Count Karnov, formerly of the Russian
Court&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh!" The inspector's smile was slightly depreciating, for ex-Russian
counts, genuine and bogus, were all too prevalent on Broadway. "Well, I'm
sorry, Count. We can't make any exceptions. Been in this country long?" he
added, casually.</p>

<p>"Just long enough to learn," Count Karnov replied angrily, "that your
customs are rather embarrassing."</p>

<p>Beard bristling, he bowed himself back to the other huddled guests.</p>

<p>The inspector sighed. "Guess I'll have to release 'em all soon now. Can't
hold them all night&mdash;and we want to get the body out. We'll check up on them
all as a matter of routine. What do you think, Phantom?"</p>

<p>"I think it's safe to let them go. But I'd keep tabs on Count Karnov if I
were you."</p>

<p>The inspector cursed grimly. "Don't worry. We'll find out about him all
right."</p>

<p>Minutes later the big night club was emptying. The patrons filed out like a
mass of frightened sheep herded by bluecoat shepherds. The employees went home
wearily.</p>

<p>Last to leave&mdash;only the Phantom, the police, and Havens remaining&mdash;was the
gruesome, crowbar-riven corpse of Clyde Dickson. The body was carried out in a
plain wicker basket, by two morgue attendants&mdash;carried humbly from the
sumptuous club Clyde Dickson had owned.</p>

<p>Soon after, the detectives who still scoured the murder office emerged. They
had found no significant clues&mdash;no prints save Dickson's own.</p>

<p>But the Phantom, though he fully trusted the efficiency of the police, was
not satisfied with their reports. It was possible that with his own leads,
leads known only to himself and Frank Havens, he might find something they had
dismissed as insignificant.</p>

<p>Accompanied by Havens, Van stepped into the murder room. There was a single
desk, full of papers which the detectives had obviously gone through.
Nevertheless, Van proceeded to go through them again.</p>

<p>"Van!" Havens spoke freely now, as once more they were alone. "What do you
make of all this? That cartoon of Collins has been haunting me ever since this
murder! Why, Collins seemed to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;prophesy this crowbar killing?" Van broke in, grimly, as he continued his
search. "It almost seems so, doesn't it, Frank? Yes, Collins certainly was on
to something vital to this whole devilish mystery. That's why I've got to see
this case through to a finish, Frank." He spoke with gripping determination.
"Collins took us in deep waters&mdash;and it's a case of sink or swim!"</p>

<p>"I can't make head or tail of it!" Havens confessed, baffled. "That weird
story about Al Millett&mdash;the criminal of twenty years ago coming back and
killing, robbing! It sounds mad!"</p>

<p>"It sounds theatrical," Van replied, his keen analytical mind showing its
work now. "There's showmanship in these murders, if nothing else. The leaving
of the fang&mdash;the sensational pulling of the crime right under the noses of the
police. A devilish showman, this 'Fang.' And yet there must be a reason, Frank.
The well-planned robberies, the organization of the gang by perfectly orthodox
underworld tactics, shows cold-blooded planning! And something tells me that
even the murder methods thus far used were based on sound, logical reason
too."</p>

<p>"Reason!" Havens protested. "To rip the sides of two men out with an ax! To
drive a crowbar through another man's skull! What reason could there be except
what the men told the inspector&mdash;that Millett's mind is fiendishly warped, that
he's been nursing a grudge and is now taking it out with homicidal fury."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," Van conceded. "Yet, somehow I'm not satisfied with that
explanation. Frank, I want you to check up&mdash;in your news files and other
sources&mdash;on all the men involved in this. See if you can bring anything to
light."</p>

<p>He shook his head, still going through papers on the desk. "One thing else
strikes me as strange. When I was trying to break into this room, I heard
Dickson&mdash;I'm sure it was he&mdash;shriek out 'You! It's you!' in obvious recognition
of the criminal."</p>

<p>"That isn't strange," Havens protested. "He simply recognized Al
Millett."</p>

<p>"Yet, Frank, he sounded surprised&mdash;as well as terrified. Was he surprised to
see Millett, knowing Millett was in town and at large? At any rate, did his
recognition bring on his own murder?"</p>

<p>He broke off his grim musings as his fingers now thumbed through a small,
frayed memorandum book he had found in Dickson's desk.</p>

<p>Its leather cover was peeling, worn at the edges. On its frayed pages, the
Phantom saw scrawled names and addresses in faded ink, all of them business
firms, mostly connected with entertainment. He thumbed on through the book.
Suddenly, he paused at a fresh page&mdash;his eyes sharpening visibly in the holes
of the domino mask.</p>

<p>"Look at this, Frank."</p>

<p>Havens looked. He saw what seemed at first a faint smudge of ink and
alongside of it was an address, a number in the West Forties.</p>

<p>The faded ink showed it, too, had been jotted down long ago.</p>

<p>But Havens adjusted a pair of reading glasses and studied the item carefully
under Van Loan's urging. He gave an exclamation. The smudge was a definite
pattern, a clover-like outline.</p>

<p>"It's a design, Van! A sort of shamrock&mdash;no, not that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Think of a deck of cards, Frank."</p>

<p>Havens eyes lighted with amazement. "Of course! It's the symbol for a club card!
A card! And on that torn cartoon of Collins's there's a card, too: a joker
under a skull. Do you think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think this symbol can be read as a word," Van's own voice held a gripping
eagerness now. "What we have then is: Club, followed by an address." His body
straightened now, eyes gleaming. "Club! And I've a hunch it might be the
Gargoyle Club also mentioned in Collins's cartoon! It's pretty late&mdash;but I'm
going there at once!"</p>

<p>Frank Havens wanted to go along, but Van, sensing danger now, feeling that
the time had come to work undercover, insisted upon setting out alone. Turning
over what evidence he had to Havens, and leaving instructions for Havens to
check up on the men involved, also to try to obtain the murder-crowbar after
the Medical Examiner finished his autopsy&mdash;the Phantom strode out of the
Palladium Club.</p>

<p>A small but powerful coupe was already awaiting him at the side-street curb.
Havens had phoned his chauffeur to speed that car here.</p>

<p>The Phantom moved like a shadow through the crowds that milled out here,
keeping his mask low so the darkness virtually concealed it. Quickly, he slid
into the coupe, stepped on the starter. The motor hummed.</p>

<p>The Phantom whirled in the seat in sudden alarm. Something whizzed in
through the window of the car, falling upon his lap!</p>

<p>Grim-eyed, he now picked up the object that had been tossed in so
surreptitiously. It was a note, wrapped around a small spoon from the
Palladium. Delicate fine handwriting showed under the dashboard lights.</p>

<p>Phantom:</p>

<p><i>Anything you do will be a waste of time until you see me. If you really want
to know of Al Millett, be at the corner of Bethune and Varick Streets tomorrow
at six p.m. Come alone, or it will be useless. I knew you from your mask&mdash;</i><br>
<br>
<i>Queen Stella.</i></p>

<p>Queen Stella! The missing girl aerialist who had been drawing all eyes when
the holdup began!</p>

<p>Van's eyes again went out to the crowd, looking for the girl. At that
instant a taxi pulled up to the curb. The Phantom saw a tall man with a cane
climbing stiffly into it; caught a brief glimpse of a heavy-jowled pale face.
The taxi-door slammed, the cab shot off around a corner, at a breathless
speed.</p>

<p>But the Phantom had recognized its passenger. That man was Bernard J.
Andrews, the big radio station owner! One of the men who had come to Inspector
Gregg with the story of Al Millett! What was he doing, lurking around the night
club where the Fang had struck a second time?</p>

<p>The Phantom's own car hurled from the curb even with these thoughts. He
drove rapidly around the corner, onto Broadway, scanning the still-heavy night
traffic. Andrews's cab was lost in a maze of other cabs.</p>

<p>Nor did he try to find it now. He also shoved away the note signed with the
name of Queen Stella, his eyes grim. Anything he did, the note said, would be a
waste of time until tomorrow.</p>

<p>He smiled to himself as he set out for the address he had picked up in
Dickson's office: the address marked only with the symbol of the club-suit from
a deck of cards.</p>

<h3>Chapter VI THE GARGOYLE CLUB</h3>

<p>Night was finally in its small, dying hours. Eerie tendrils of mist seeped
down the street east of Sixth Avenue, cooling the deserted pavements which
slowly relinquished the Indian summer heat of the previous day.</p>

<p>The side street had a lonely aspect. Yet, close by, was plenty of life and
activity. From Sixth Avenue came sounds that drowned out the occasional rumble
of the elevated trains&mdash;sounds of drilling and pumping&mdash;now and then the dull
boom of a blast. A subway line was under construction, being rushed with three
eight-hour shifts every twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>But the side street here was aloof from the clamor. At the moment, there was
no visible sign of anyone on the entire block. Yet someone was there.</p>

<p>Blending with the shadows of the dark building fronts, yet moving hurriedly
along the street, stole the Phantom. He had left his coupe parked on another
street.</p>

<p>His keen eyes glanced at each passing house number. And then they found that
which they sought, and his lithe body slowed in its pace. This building made a
strange contrast to the tall, modern office skyscrapers that rose like canyon
walls on either side of the street. It was small, squat, of ancient brownstone,
and was squeezed between two of the skyscrapers, as if it had defiantly refused
to heed the march of time&mdash;had stubbornly remained when its neighbors had been
torn down to make way for architectural progress.</p>

<p>From every appearance it was a tenantless house. Though no For Sale signs
hung on it, its windows were partially boarded, a few others showing broken
age-begrimed panes. Its door, too, had boards over it.</p>

<p>The Phantom felt a sense of disappointment. This was the address, marked by
the symbol of a club, which he had found in Dickson's ancient book. And from
the looks of it, the place was long since fallen into disuse, as defunct as the
rest of the addresses in that book.</p>

<p>The Phantom glanced up and down the block. It was empty, deserted. Moving to
the worn stoop of the dilapidated house, he ascended the stone stairs, came to
the boarded door. The boards, he saw now, were nailed to the door behind them,
a hole cut through where the key-hole of the lock showed.</p>

<p>The Phantom's interest quickened. That key-hole looked new. Again he glanced
up and down the street, eyes darting through his mask-holes. No one in
sight.</p>

<p>From a pocket he now took out a slender piece of wire. It looked quite
ordinary. Actually it was of specially tempered steel, malleable, yet always
able to recover its original shape. Into the key-hole the Phantom inserted the
wire. His deft fingers manipulated it. No burglar could have been more swift
and expert at picking that lock.</p>

<p>In just a moment, with scarcely a sound, the Phantom had the lock picked.
Cautiously he swung the big boarded door on its hinges, slipped into the house,
closing the door softly behind him.</p>

<p>The gloom that met him at first seemed opaque. A musty odor clogged his
sensitive nostrils. He moved cautiously, on his soft-soled shoes, eyes
gradually accustoming themselves to the darkness.</p>

<p>The ancient interior of the house slowly came into view. Gaping doorways, a
rickety flight of stairs. The whole place seemed desolate and dead, a decayed
relic of the past. Once, no doubt, it had been a fashionable house&mdash;its ornate
fixings indicated that. But now it was only an archaic shell, and as he groped
his way through it, the desolate emptiness of it seemed to engulf the Phantom
like a weird, evil spell.</p>

<p>He felt as if he had stepped out of all modern civilization and progress
into a world that no longer existed, a world that could only hold ghosts of the
past.</p>

<p>Ghosts! Certainly the <i>Phantom</i> could laugh at the idea of ghosts! Yet,
even with the thought, a slight, scurrying sound came to his ears. He dismissed
it quickly, with a little shiver. Rats, no doubt.</p>

<p>Then, all at once, he heard another sound. His lithe body jerked rigid.</p>

<p>As if welling up vaguely from some invisible source there came a sound of
voices.</p>

<p>Nerves taut, the Phantom listened with ears acutely tuned, trying to reckon
their direction. But they came only as vague murmurings, and Van half-wondered
if his imagination was not playing tricks on him.</p>

<p>He moved about. Again came that ghostly murmur. But this time his ears told
him it had come from above. The stairs, he had already seen, were covered with
fully half an inch of undisturbed dust! Nevertheless, the Phantom ascended
them, his soft-soles treading lightly on their creaking wood.</p>

<p>He reached the second and top floor of the house. A musty hall, again gaping
rooms whose dirt-grimed windows hid the city outside, shutting this ghastly
place off from civilization. Certainly, the floor was absolutely vacant,
empty.</p>

<p>Yet, at that very instant, the voices sounded again closer now. He caught a
snatch of words&mdash;</p>

<p><i>"I'll see you in hell first!"</i></p>

<p>The speech came like a single, crackling explosion, then as instantly
subsided, so that again Van couldn't be sure he had really heard them. Yet his
every nerve told him something devilish was going on in this house.</p>

<p>The sound had come from close by, from the very top of the stair landing
here. Yet there was no room here, just a wall, outside of which must be the
street. He bent to the wall, fingers groping in the darkness&mdash;for he still
dared show no light.</p>

<p>Suddenly his fingers touched metal, a small grille of oblong shape. In a
flash he realized that it was one of the old-fashioned type of
heat-grilles.</p>

<p>A slight draft came through it, but no light. Swiftly Van Loan comprehended.
Those grilles made excellent sound conductors. The voices had come up between
the walls from below.</p>

<p>Van moved again to the stairs, descended them. He came to the ground floor
once more. His eyes, straining in the gloom, saw the side of the staircase now,
saw how far outwards it extended. He hurried to it, Colt .45 whipping out,
thumb snapping down the safety catch so that the weapon was ready for use.</p>

<p>He could hear nothing now, but his left hand groped along the wall of the
staircase. A hunch had grown within him as he noticed the strange paneling
here.</p>

<p>In the very next instant, near some coping, his hand was arrested by a small
metal catch. With his other hand coming forward with his gun, the Phantom
pressed that catch.</p>

<p>There was a click&mdash;a hissing swish.</p>

<p>Bright light momentarily dazzled the Phantom as it came flooding out toward
him, grotesquely illumining the ancient, dusty hallway, throwing weird
shadows.</p>

<p>Gun leveled, eyes slitted in the holes of his black domino mask, the Phantom
hurled his body through the revealed doorway and to one side.</p>

<p>A large, strange chamber was before him. It was empty.</p>

<p>He was certain even before his eyes located a grille near the ceiling that
this was where the voices had come from. But there was no one in the room! Had
those voices come from invisible ghosts?</p>

<p>His eyes took in the chamber. Oak-paneled walls, windowless&mdash;a luxurious and
well-kept room, pleasantly illumined by modern indirect lighting. An amazing
contrast to the rest of the dilapidated house.</p>

<p>There was a table in the center of the room, a long oak table with several
chairs around it. Two were pulled out from the rest, indicating that they might
have been hastily vacated.</p>

<p>The Phantom's eyes went wider. He had come through the secret doorway to
this room. He was sure it hadn't been used by anyone since his arrival in the
house. Had those voices been imaginary then? Or was there another exit?</p>

<p>His eyes were drawn hypnotically to one wall and a chill shock went through
him, tightening his every nerve.</p>

<p>Leering at him from that wall was a human skull. Beneath it, pinned to form
a pattern with it, was a playing card&mdash;a joker! The strange symbol he had found
in that torn cartoon by Eddie Collins!</p>

<p>He moved back to the table. Nothing on it. If only there were some clue as
to who had been in here. He stiffened anew. There <i>was</i> something on the
table. Or, rather, in the table's oak surface. A bronze plaque was inlaid at
the head. Van bent over it.</p>

<p>Nine names were inscribed in that plaque, well known names that seemed to
leap out like letters of blood before his eyes! Nine names he had heard at the
very outset of this strange case.</p>

<p>Benjamin Marcy<br>
Lyle Marcy<br>
Gordon Drake<br>
Bernard J. Andrews<br>
Carl Fenwick<br>
Clyde Dickson<br>
Paul Corbin<br>
Kenneth Meade<br>
John Gifford</p>

<p>The mighty moguls of the amusement world, three of whom had just been
killed! Here, in this room, under the symbol of the skull and joker, they
apparently had held secret meetings. For what reason&mdash;if they had no past to
hide, no secret?</p>

<p>Grim-eyed now, realizing that he had come to some vital core of the mystery
if he could but interpret it, the Phantom proceeded to examine the secret
room.</p>

<p>He found something else that caught his attention. On another wall, near the
secret panel he had entered, had hung what had evidently been a large placard
of some sort. Now just a corner of it remained, frayed and dusty. Printing, in
an archaic type long since gone out of use, revealed three letters:</p>

<p><i>kil</i></p>

<p>The unfinished word seemed to blend with that leering skull across the room,
and if ever Van felt the presence of menace, of death itself, he felt it at the
very instant he gazed at that strange, mutilated sign.</p>

<p>At that instant the sixth sense which the Phantom possessed leaped once more
to the fore. Certainly he had not heard the slight, cautious sound behind his
back. He hadn't expected it, because he had already surveyed the entire room,
and now he was facing the secret door through which he himself had come.</p>

<p>Only when his muscles were already whirling his body, his hand whipping up
his gun, did he feel the draft of air from behind him, a draft which told him
some other door must have opened. But even as he whirled, eyes sharp, the
lights of the room went out!</p>

<p>The windowless chamber was plunged into Stygian darkness. The Phantom,
though he could see nothing, was acutely aware of a shape charging toward him!
His whole body braced. But, despite his forewarning of it, the Phantom was
almost bowled completely over by the savage ferocity of the body which hurled
against his own, knocking his gun from his fist. Hands reached for his throat,
hands that were like vises of steel. In the darkness he struggled with his
powerful antagonist, tugging at the hands which had closed on his wind-pipe and
were choking the breath from his lungs.</p>

<p>Rallying his strength, the Phantom was matching his adversary with the
strength and skill of self-defense he had practiced arduously. Something struck
Van's back as his antagonist momentarily forced him against the wall. A
light-switch, he was certain!</p>

<p>Gathering strength, he twisted his antagonist around. One hand had released
the awful, choking pressure on his throat&mdash;he could breathe again. He gave a
yank, freeing momentarily his left hand. Fiercely, he reached for the switch.
Light would reveal that face. More than anything else, that was what Van wanted
to see.</p>

<p>But even as his groping fingers touched the switch a sudden, rasping shout
broke from his still-unseen attacker.</p>

<p><i>"Men! Over here! He's the Phantom!"</i></p>

<p>Almost simultaneously, Van heard a heavy rush of feet from the secret door
he himself had entered. With a curse of alarm, he whirled as his antagonist now
jerked away.</p>

<p>Now his eyes were able to discern several shadowy figures, groping for him.
Rough hands reached out, grabbing at him. The Phantom struck out blindly with
his own powerful fists, but there were too many for him now. Blows cuffed him.
He heard an awful, swishing sound&mdash;the sound of a heavy black-jack arcing
viciously through the air. His very brain seemed to explode, causing myriad
colors to dance before his eyes.</p>

<p>Stunned, he fought to keep consciousness while hands frisked him in the
dark&mdash;frisked him but failed to find one item that, by a secret legerdemain on
Van's part, always defied ordinary search&mdash;the diamond-studded platinum badge
of the Phantom!</p>

<p>In the next moment the lights went on. Blinking, the Phantom again took in
the strange chamber.</p>

<p>There were five slouch-hatted men in the room. Three of them, yanking him to
his feet and covering him with guns, he recognized at once as the thugs who had
attacked him when he had posed as Collins. There was the broken-nosed thug
called Gus with tape on his wrist which had been wounded. There was the
hatchet-faced gunman, and the pallid one.</p>

<p>One more slouch-hatted figure was a stranger. The fifth, standing at the
light switch, was a burly man in a sport-belted slicker. Van's eyes narrowed
with swift recognition. Monk Gorman!</p>

<p>But where was the man who had originally attacked the Phantom single-handed,
then given orders to this gang? Van was sure he was not one of these thugs.</p>

<p>As this thought flashed through the Phantom's mind, the big man in the
slicker came striding over.</p>

<p>"So you're the Phantom," he sneered, glaring with hate at the masked man who
had awed the underworld. "Well, this time you bucked something too big for you,
pal."</p>

<p>Gus snarled then. "Say Monk&mdash;why waste time?" Despite his taped wrist he
leveled his automatic toward Van, eyes alight with murder. "Let me give him a
belly-full o' slugs, will ya, Monk? Hell, he's probably the guy who potted my
wrist and wounded Pete when he got that envelope&mdash;"</p>

<p>Van stiffened as the automatic pointed its black muzzle towards him. Though
his strength was not yet returned, he did not intend to die without a
struggle.</p>

<p>"Hold it, hold it!" Monk commanded, pushing Gus aside. "We ain't doin'
anythin' in here! Just one thing before we get goin' with this Phantom bird,
let's have a good look at him!"</p>

<p>Van, menaced by guns, unarmed, did not try to make resistance, even though
he saw Monk's intent!</p>

<p>Deliberately now, with evil satisfaction in his bead-like eyes, Monk's
paw-like hand reached forward. It seized the edge of the domino mask. A savage
rip&mdash;and the mask came off.</p>

<p>But it did not reveal the face of Richard Curtis Van Loan, a face that would
have shown through the scant disguise of Eddie Collins. Before he had come to
this building, Van, with keen precaution, had put on a new and strong
make-up&mdash;a disguise which altered his features into those of a hard-looking man
of indeterminate age.</p>

<p>"So that's what you really look like, Phantom?" Monk seemed disappointed, as
if he expected to see some super-being. "Hell! I never seen your puss before.
All right, we'll get goin'! Tony, bring that over!"</p>

<p>The pallid-faced thug came forward with a length of stout cord. In a matter
of seconds the Phantom was bound hand and foot, arms pinioned behind him. His
mouth was taped.</p>

<p>Monk barked a fresh order. They picked the bound Phantom up and started
toward the secret panel.</p>

<p>"No, not that way, Choppy!" Monk rapped. "Might be coppers out front, an'
I'm hot!" He moved to the opposite wall, where he pressed a catch.</p>

<p>Another secret panel, in that wall, slid open. The Phantom was carried
through it into a dark, tunnel-like passage. The panel was closed behind as
Monk followed.</p>

<p>A long journey through the dark passage which descended slightly and then
rose. The faintly cool air of the misty outdoors engulfed the Phantom. He
realized they had emerged on the next block downtown from the house. The
passage, evidently some old drainage duct, afforded a direct route from the
secret room to the street, leading out through the cellar of another house.</p>

<p>But who had been the man who cried: "I'll see you in hell first"? Who had
been the powerful brute who had attacked Van Loan in the dark? Was the Phantom
going to learn the answers to these questions?</p>

<h3>Chapter VII A NARROW ESCAPE</h3>

<p>Carried to a large sedan, the captive Phantom was tossed like a sack into
the rear. Tony leaped into the front seat, got the motor going. Another thug
slid alongside him. Monk, Gus, and the hatchet-faced man named Choppy climbed
in roughly over Van's half-doubled figure, trampling him brutally down to the
floorboards.</p>

<p>"Where we takin' this Phantom bird, Monk?" the broken-nosed Gus demanded, a
note of awe in his tones. "Gonna take him to the new 'chateau' so the Boss
can&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut up!" Monk snarled. "Tony, drive like I told you."</p>

<p>The Phantom, gathering strength to struggle as best he could against his
bonds, relaxed, grim hope in his heart as the sedan rolled on. Helpless and
bound though he was, he wished they would take him to that unknown destination,
to the lair of the Fang!</p>

<p>And then the sedan rolled to a stop.</p>

<p>All this time, on the sides of the avenue, below the elevated, Van had been
aware of the noisy clamor of the subway excavating. Now the din had reached a
climax. The car had turned a little way into another dim side street. Monk
alone climbed out.</p>

<p>He was gone several minutes. Then, hurriedly, his slouch-hatted head again
poked into the car.</p>

<p>"Okay, guys! Bring him out. Follow me and be careful! If there's any
trouble, use your rods!"</p>

<p>Again the Phantom was lifted bodily. Out of the car the four others took
him, and trotted with him along the quiet street.</p>

<p>Bright arc-lights appeared on the avenue, where drills and compressors
shattered the final hours of the night. There was a deep excavation, extending
to a vacant lot here. Workmen swarmed in it. A huge derrick was steaming and
straining in the center.</p>

<p>With a boldness that astonished the bound Phantom, his captors carried him
down an incline into that excavation. Monk was signaling them on.</p>

<p>The workmen were all preoccupied, watching the derrick, whose great arm was
lifting a dark, massive burden.</p>

<p>"Here&mdash;put him here! Hurry!"</p>

<p>They dragged the Phantom over rough, uneven, rocky ground. Suddenly, he was
dropped violently. His bound body banged against the slanting surface of a
heavy, sand-covered rock. Stunned again, his every bone shaken, he could not
move.</p>

<p>As they dropped him, all five thugs scurried away like hasty fleeing
rats.</p>

<p>Van, twisting up his head, saw&mdash;</p>

<p>The derrick arm was lowering. Its shadow was right above him. He saw the
massive burden it was bringing down. A huge net of steel!</p>

<p>It was right on top of him, coming like a huge blanket. Somewhere to the
right the workmen were guiding it by long ropes. They did not see him here in
the gloom, nor could he shout to them with the tape over his mouth!</p>

<p>Down came the steel net. The Phantom braced his body, flattening as best he
could against the rock, as his last effort to roll out of the way of the great
expanse of net proved futile.</p>

<p>Then it was on him. Its crushing weight knocked the breath anew from his
lungs. Steel links and cables bruised through his clothes, dug into his flesh.
It was lucky he was not crushed to death.</p>

<p>Lucky? Even as the steel net flattened over him and the rock now, and the
derrick swung away with empty jaws Van knew that he had not escaped death. This
was but a grim preparation for it!</p>

<p>A vague figure out in the gloom, evidently a foreman, was yelling, "Clear
away, men! This is gonna be a whopper!"</p>

<p>Simultaneously Van's eyes, jerking to one side, caught a faint outline of
electric wires, going into the rock close beside him. There were two other
rocks nearby, also covered with nets.</p>

<p>His blood chilled as he comprehended the diabolical intention of the
murderous Monk Gorman. Instead of taking him to the "chateau," they had planned
a ghastly doom for him! These three rocks were loaded with dynamite. They were
about to be blasted. The nets that covered them were to keep the explosion as
confined as possible, so the shattered rock would not erupt all over the
place.</p>

<p>Three rocks to be blasted! And on the center one, pinned down by that steel
net, lay the Phantom. In a moment now he would be blown to bits, his body torn
beyond all means of identification! It was a devilishly clever means of getting
rid of him, of removing him from the bizarre murder case without leaving a
tangible clue.</p>

<p>"Come on, men, hurry up!" the foreman was shouting. Obviously he stood at
the hand-detonator, ready to send the current through the wires to the
fulminate caps packed in the dynamite. "Clear away, I say!"</p>

<p>Van had spent precious seconds trying to shout, but it was useless. The
adhesive remained tight over his lips. Now, knowing that only seconds remained,
he fought to keep calm in the face of the ghastly predicament!</p>

<p>In that swift moment, his muscles strained tentatively, feeling for any
place where the pressure was not impossibly heavy. His left arm behind him was
partially protected by the hollow of his back.</p>

<p>The Phantom had made a thorough study of escapes. He had analyzed the
escapes of the late Houdini, until he had mastered similar tricks. Now he
applied every bit of knowledge he could summon to this crisis.</p>

<p>His wrist twisted, muscles flexing and unflexing in his forearm.</p>

<p>"All clear?" The foreman was shouting.</p>

<p>The words spurred the Phantom's efforts. He gave a sudden peculiar jerk,
with all his strength. His arm, with rope still clinging to it, came free.</p>

<p>Just one arm, his left, to work with at all&mdash;and the blast about to go off!
But the Phantom had already gauged his one possible chance of escape from
death.</p>

<p>The electric feed wires! With all his strength he pushed his arm out from
behind him, his body heaving against the steel net, managing to push it upwards
just a trifle, though the effort made every muscle groan in protest.</p>

<p>He couldn't see the foreman. Yet, as if his intuition had eyes, he could
envision the man even now stooping to push the plunger.</p>

<p>An inch more! With one last effort he made it. His fingers seized both wires
and yanked.</p>

<p>Br-r-rooooom!</p>

<p>The whole world seemed to detonate about his ears, leaving him deaf! Smoke
and fire leaped about him. He felt the rock shiver under his spine.</p>

<p>But his rock had not been blasted! The two other rocks had disintegrated,
gone up in that net-stifled upheaval! The wires to this rock, which he had
ripped in that last split second from the fuse-caps, had not carried the
current to the fatal dynamite sticks. A moment later cautious workmen appeared
above Van's net carrying lanterns and coming to see why the dynamite had failed
to detonate. Their cries of amazed surprise and alarm faintly sounded in Van's
pained ears as their lamps revealed the pinned figure under the net.</p>

<p>They had to use the derrick to remove the heavy expanse of steel. Hands
helped Van to his feet. Voices shouted questions at him. Someone ran to summon
an ambulance.</p>

<p>But the Phantom was not there when the ambulance came. Bruised and shaken,
he had paused only to recapture his lost wind, his ebbed strength.</p>

<p>Then, so quickly that the workmen were left gasping, he whirled from the
group, darted across the gloom of the excavation, and disappeared in the misty
dawn which was just breaking over the city.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>"Yes, Frank, the criminal was at that Gargoyle Club or I miss my guess. And
he knew I was the Phantom."</p>

<p>Morning sunlight slanted warmly through the French windows of Havens's
office in the <i>Clarion</i> Building, as the Phantom, refreshed by clean
clothes, medical treatment at the hands of his valet, and nourishment, sat
beside the publisher's desk.</p>

<p>Havens's face showed the deep-lined strain of a sleepless night, mingled
with the relief at seeing the Phantom safe and sound.</p>

<p>"The police went to that club, as you call it, as soon as you phoned, Van,"
he reported. "They found the secret room. But the name plaque you mentioned
wasn't there; nor was that torn sign on the wall."</p>

<p>Van's eyes were grim. "Evidently they were removed by the criminal. Guess he
attacked me because I saw them. I wonder what&mdash;" He broke off with a shrug, lit
a cigarette thoughtfully. "Any other developments, Frank?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The police have been checking up on all the people present in the
Palladium Club during that holdup. One of them, that man who called himself
Count Karnov, seems to interest them. As far as they can make out, he arrived
only recently in this country&mdash;and he's been moving fast from hotel to hotel.
They're trying to check up on him. Queen Stella is still missing. And nothing
known about her identity, either."</p>

<p>Van smiled grimly. He did not tell Havens about the note he had in his
pocket, signed by the trapeze artist's sobriquet. He had left that note in the
coupe when he had gone to the Gargoyle Club. Later, after his hectic adventure,
he had found the coupe intact. But he kept the note to himself now, aware that
it might still be a false lead, a red herring which might confuse the trail.
But the memory of the wording of it&mdash;<i>"Anything you try to do will be a waste of
time&mdash;"</i> brought a queer thrill to the Phantom. His visit to that strange house
of the secret room had been far indeed from a waste of time.</p>

<p>"About this Al Millett, Frank," he spoke aloud. "Is it true he used to give
some of his exhibitions for a circus&mdash;Crowley and Buckle's once-famous
circus?"</p>

<p>"Yes, among other road shows. Why, Van?"</p>

<p>"I want you to get me all the data you can on that circus, Frank," the
Phantom demanded without replying to the question. "Everything that might carry
any information. I take it, you've already got some data on the men
involved?"</p>

<p>Havens nodded. "A slew of stuff&mdash;I'm having it assembled. But I'm afraid it
won't be of much value, Van. Those men have all been in the amusement business
a long time. And as far as their careers go back publicly, there is nothing
dark or hidden about them. Yet," he added, frowning thoughtfully, "they have
one thing in common&mdash;their shunning of publicity. All are bachelors, living
alone&mdash;except the murdered Marcys, who lived together. None of them seems to
have any living relatives."</p>

<p>Van drew a puff of smoke, thinking as Havens spoke, of that mysterious room
at the Gargoyle Club, the name plaque, those two voices&mdash;one heavy, and the
other dry.</p>

<p>"If there are no relatives, who are the heirs of the estates of the murdered
men?" he asked, interested.</p>

<p>"Their moneys are willed to charities, Van, institutions for the
infirm&mdash;reputable places needing endowments. No one gains by their deaths
except these institutions. Dickson and the Marcy brothers had practically all
their wealth in their show places. But these are to be sold, the proceeds to be
used in the settlement of their wills."</p>

<p>The publisher shook his head, sighed. "So you see, there isn't much to go by
there. And I still can't see how Eddie Collins drew practically Dickson's
murder before it happened." Grimly, his eyes went to the now empty lounge where
the youthful cartoonist had died the night before.</p>

<p>"You looked through Collins's office stuff here? Checked up?" Van
demanded.</p>

<p>"Yes. We found some scraps of comic cartoons&mdash;nothing much there. But I did
find some peculiar scribblings, Van. They scarcely seem to make sense. I have
them here."</p>

<p>He handed Van Loan some small pages, on which was bold handwriting. Van
looked through them. His brows arched in surprise.</p>

<p><i>Bee doesn't die by sting&mdash;Red Sea is red as blood&mdash;</i></p>

<p>Van looked up, his eyes sharp, his mind racing.</p>

<p>"What is it, Van?" Havens demanded, noting the Phantom's absorption. "Do you
see something there? It isn't, perhaps, some sort of code?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't think so," Van replied slowly. And slowly a light began to
shine in his eyes. His voice was gripping now. "Frank&mdash;I'm beginning to see
something! Something which is still without any definite pattern&mdash;but it's
there&mdash;if only I can get a few more leads to it! And I'm pretty sure I know how
Collins got mixed up in this!"</p>

<p>Havens stared at him, wide-eyed, accustomed though he was to the Phantom's
often-amazing conclusions. "Van, what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you as soon as I'm a little more sure," Van returned. "And&mdash;" He
broke off as the inter-office buzzer sounded.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, Mr. Havens," the pleasant voice of the editor's secretary came
from the speaker. "A Mr. Carl Fenwick wishes to see you. Says it is very
urgent."</p>

<p>"Fenwick!" Havens repeated, glancing at Van Loan and observing his quick
nod. "Send him in, please."</p>

<p>Van Loan swiftly turned up his collar and snapped a new domino over his
face. Glancing swiftly around to be sure there were no traces of Richard Van
Loan, he turned to study the newcomer.</p>

<p>Carl Fenwick, the man who looked almost like a clergyman because of his
high, straight collar, came in with a nervous stride. His mild face was pale,
fraught with agitation. His troubled eyes at first did not see the masked
Phantom. "Mr. Havens," Fenwick said tensely. "Sorry if I've disturbed you. But
I understand you can contact the man known as the Phantom! And&mdash;" He broke off,
starting, as his glance now took in the domino-masked figure.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;I beg your pardon!" Fenwick stammered. "Are you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Van nodded grimly. "Yes, I'm the Phantom."</p>

<p>Fenwick gave a dry, mirthless, rather shaky laugh. "How&mdash;how fortunate,
finding you here."</p>

<p>The Phantom said nothing to this; but inwardly he wondered if Fenwick meant
those words. Was Fenwick surprised to see the Phantom alive? Had he perhaps
come here to see if he <i>were</i> alive? Van had not forgotten that murderous
attack in the secret room.</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down, Mr. Fenwick?" Havens invited now.</p>

<p>Fenwick nodded his thanks, took one of the comfortable chairs. He seemed to
await a question from the Phantom. Van deliberately made none, coolly lighting
another cigarette. He had already decided on his course of action: Carl Fenwick
would have to take the initiative.</p>

<p>Fenwick tugged a little at his high collar. A moment of silence filled the
room. Havens had already become a silent spectator, waiting at his desk. Then
Fenwick leaned towards the Phantom. "I had to come to you, Phantom," he said, a
haunting light in his eyes. His words came in a sudden rush, like a pent-up dam
released. "I had heard, through the police, you were interested in this case.
We went to the police, and they didn't help us. Now I'm coming to you. The
others might not approve of it, but there's something I'm going to tell
you."</p>

<p>Havens stiffened, scenting news. The Phantom remained cool, his eyes alone
betraying his interest through the mask. Then he spoke dryly. "You mean," he
said, "that you and others actually did do a real wrong to Millett."</p>

<p>Fenwick gasped and winced.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no," he protested. "What we told Inspector Gregg was the truth. We
simply refused to back Al Millett in a show of his own. As a result, he went
broke. His wife died, and he disappeared. But there's more to the story.
Millett and his wife had a child&mdash;a girl child who disappeared with Millett
after the death of his wife."</p>

<p>The Phantom did not appear shocked or profoundly affected by this bit of
information. He studied the theatrical producer thoughtfully for a moment.
Then: "Very interesting, Mr. Fenwick," he said. "But just how, may I ask, does
this item of personal history bear on this case?"</p>

<p>Fenwick tugged uncomfortably at his collar. "I&mdash;I don't know," he faltered.
"I thought you ought to be told everything. Andrews, particularly, was opposed
to my saying anything."</p>

<p>Van Loan remained thoughtful. Andrews was the radio company man, the chap
the Phantom had seen walking away from the Palladium Club late last night after
the murder of Dickson.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Fenwick," Van Loan acknowledged gravely. "I will remember
what you have said."</p>

<p>The theatrical man, after a word of effusive thanks that the Phantom was on
the case, took his leave.</p>

<p>"Well, Van?" The publisher asked. "What do you make of Fenwick's story?"</p>

<p>"Very little," Van admitted. "I believe him&mdash;certainly. But I still think
there is a great deal more to this whole mess than any of them have told.
Perhaps a talk with Bernard J. Andrews would be enlightening. Call Inspector
Gregg on your private wire, Frank, and see where we can find the man right now.
Gregg should know."</p>

<p>Havens quickly got the chief of detectives on the phone. His conversation
with the inspector was brief. Turning back to the expectant Phantom, he
exploded a bombshell.</p>

<p>"Van, Andrews has disappeared! He apparently slipped away from his home
during the night. No signs of violence. He's just gone. There's an alarm out
for him right now."</p>

<p>The Phantom stood erect. "Good-by, Frank. That means I've plenty of work to
do. Get that information together for me and send it over to the lab as soon as
you can."</p>

<p>And he was gone.</p>

<h3>Chapter VIII QUEEN STELLA AGAIN</h3>

<p>Located in an old loft building was a queer business belonging to an
eccentric recluse who went by the name of Dr. Bendix.</p>

<p>Neither the police nor the impoverished inhabitants of the lower East Side
dreamed that, in the midst of the city's most squalid tenement section, there
existed perhaps the finest and most fully equipped private crime-laboratory in
the world.</p>

<p>The mysterious Dr. Bendix stood in that gleaming laboratory now, over a
table full of retorts and test tubes.</p>

<p>Alone, he wore no mask or disguise. And friends of Richard Curtis Van Loan,
the socialite, would have been amazed to see him hard at work here, in a
stained smock, a cigarette dangling from his lips. That Richard Van Loan was
"Dr. Bendix," that this was just another role of the Phantom, was a secret
known only to Frank Havens.</p>

<p>Strange objects lay on the work-table before the Phantom. A broken iron
crowbar. Two saber teeth. They had been sent here by Havens, who had obtained
them from the Medical Examiner and the police department.</p>

<p>With a pair of tongs, Van heated the crowbar over the blue-white flame of a
Bunsen burner. He dipped it, hissing, into a container of chemicals. His
analysis was long and thorough. An analysis to get the blood of Clyde Dickson
from the crowbar. To test the effect of the blood's oxygen content on the
iron.</p>

<p>When at last he had finished, he had reached some strange conclusions. The
crowbar was old&mdash;very many years old. Even the break in it did not look new.
Why had the criminal who called himself the Fang taken an old, broken crowbar
as a murder weapon? Van's eyes gleamed.</p>

<p>Of the Marcy brothers, whose sides had been ripped and mutilated, Van had no
evidence of any weapon, but he had read the full, and baffled, autopsy
report.</p>

<p>He gave his attention next to the saber teeth. He decided, by comparison
with zoological books he had, that they were really the teeth of tigers. They
could have been bought in any store selling trinkets of this sort.</p>

<p>The Phantom now moved from the work-table to a flat-topped desk. Here were
the sheaves of newspaper clippings and other reports on the men involved in the
case. Smoking thoughtfully, Van went through them.</p>

<p>The names of all the living men, with their corresponding dossiers, passed
like a parade before the Phantom: Bernard J. Andrews, missing radio man&mdash;Gordon
Drake&mdash;Carl Fenwick&mdash;Paul Corbin, night-club owner&mdash;John Gifford, amusement
park manager.</p>

<p>The reports confirmed what Havens had already told him. But Havens had, in
response to Van's request, sent one additional piece of information. Through
his influence he had learned, from various law-firms, of the wills of all the
rest of the men.</p>

<p>And like the murder victims, all of them were leaving their wealth to
charities! Where the first victims had their money tied up in businesses that
had to be liquidated, the rest had most of their fortune in sound Wall Street
investments and in cash deposits.</p>

<p>It did not seem surprising. None had relatives, so it could be understood
that they were leaving their wealth to public institutions. But it certainly
seemed to offset any mercenary motive for their murder. They could have been
robbed without being killed.</p>

<p>The Phantom rose, paced, brooding on his thoughts. It wasn't money that tied
these men together. There was some bond which that mysterious club indicated.
It didn't seem to be any dark or shady deed of the past. What, then?
<i>What?</i></p>

<p>Again that vague germ of light was in his brain. But it defied definition.
Could the bond merely be a mutual fear of Al Millett&mdash;the Fang? No, for openly
they had gone to the police confessing to such a bond while they had been
darkly secretive about the Gargoyle Club. It was queer, the feeling Van had,
the intangible feeling that as yet the right answer had not been found.</p>

<p>The Gargoyle Club&mdash;Van stopped on that thought, memory coming to him. He
moved to a telephone, put in a call to the Department of Buildings. He asked
for an official of high standing.</p>

<p>"This is Mr. Frank Havens," he said in the next moment, simulating perfectly
the voice of the publisher who had given him full license to use this identity
over the phone. "I called you before, if you remember, for a favor. Did you
find out about the ownership of that old building on Forty-Fifth Street, near
Sixth?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Havens," came the official's polite voice. "It belongs to a
corporation&mdash;the Star Corporation. A Mr. John Gifford is president."</p>

<p>Gifford! The amusement park owner.</p>

<p>"That's a good piece of real estate, isn't it?" Van asked
conversationally.</p>

<p>"Good indeed! You know how values have sky-rocketed in that section since
Rockefeller Center was put up near there."</p>

<p>"Funny they don't develop the property."</p>

<p>"Yes, isn't it? I understand, too, they've had several juicy offers for it,
but they refuse to sell."</p>

<p>When Van hung up, his eyes were keen, hard. Again he resumed his pacing. The
ring of a bell at the end of the room brought him out of his musings. He waited
a full moment, then went down the stairs to a foyer of the old loft. A package
was waiting there, a big bundle of papers. Van knew that Havens's trusted
office boy had delivered them, rung the bell, and quickly departed. His face
eager, he carried the stuff upstairs, undid it on a table. It was the data he
had been waiting for on the once famous Crowley and Buckill's circus.</p>

<p>Frank Havens, with his usual dependability, must have scoured the town to
get such a mass of stuff. Some of the papers were frayed and decaying&mdash;their
print archaic. In his preliminary examination, Van Loan pulled out of the stack
an old three-sheet show bill.</p>

<p>He read the entire poster with careful attention.</p>

<p>Crowley &amp; Buckill</p>

<p>Free Parade!</p>

<p><i>BAND OF 30 PIECES!</i></p>

<p>PLAYING HERE</p>

<p>There was a blank space for a dated streamer. But Van Loan's eyes went back
to the first line&mdash;to the word "Buckill." With his hand he blocked off three
letters&mdash;kil&mdash;and he knew what placard had been torn from the wall at the
Gargoyle Club.</p>

<p>He spent the entire afternoon going through the stack of yellow and aging
papers. He found individual posters on Al Millett's billing which described the
fellow as a terror on wheels&mdash;followed by a thirty-piece band. There were
single sheets on Signorina Beatrice, on the side shows, on the freak museum, on
the animal tent, and so on. In their day Crowley and Buckill, like the Barnum
who had preceded them, had been exploiting showmen. Van heaved a regretful
sigh. This was like a trip back to childhood, to the sawdust paradise of the
circus of yesteryear.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Dusk.</p>

<p>A tumble-down, desolate street near the Hudson River water-front. Just a few
buildings and vacant lots. One lamp-post, its light having just gone on, was
casting a dull glow in the thickening gloom.</p>

<p>The Phantom deliberately avoided that light.</p>

<p>In the shadows against the old buildings, he moved toward the corner of
Bethune Street, domino mask once more on his face. His eyes were tense and
alert; his right hand, which seemed to hang idly at the wrist, was ready to
reach for his gun.</p>

<p>He was obeying the instructions in the note signed by the missing aerialist
"Queen Stella." For there was a possibility the lead might prove bona-fide. He
could not afford to pass it up.</p>

<p>The street, he saw, was empty. But it was not yet quite six&mdash;the hour of the
rendezvous. Van neared the corner, saw that it formed the angles of an empty
lot full of refuse-cans, garbage, wrecked autos.</p>

<p>It was then that a tension began to come over his nerves. A sense of
danger.</p>

<p>He paused in the shadows, hesitating to step to the corner, where he would
not only be revealed by the street-lamp, but also, with that open lot there,
would be unshielded by any buildings. It was too perfect for a rub-out to suit
the Phantom.</p>

<p>From where he stood, his eyes searched across the lot. Nothing in that
refuse, he was sure. A slight movement that startled him proved to be a
prowling alley cat.</p>

<p>Then his eyes went across the lot, to the rear of a dilapidated old
building. It looked vacant, broken windowed. Because he was looking for it, he
saw it then!</p>

<p>A broken lower window, something glinting over its sill&mdash;a round, dark
muzzle! A gun ready to aim&mdash;and blast!</p>

<p>He sucked in a sharp breath, realizing that only his prescience had stopped
him from walking out into the open before that waiting muzzle.</p>

<p>Then his eyes went to slits in their mask-holes. Grim purpose tightened his
lips. He changed from the quarry to the hunter.</p>

<p>It was still a few minutes short of six.</p>

<p>The Phantom turned and went swiftly back from the corner. He slipped
completely around the block, staying under cover, drifting like a dark mist to
the front of that house on the next block.</p>

<p>Vacancy signs hung on it.</p>

<p>Half the front was torn down.</p>

<p>The brick walls were jagged and wrecked.</p>

<p>No one was in front of the house. There were no cars. No doorways where an
ambusher could lurk unseen.</p>

<p>The Phantom approached the gaping front door of the house as stealthily as a
cat.</p>

<p>The only sound he made was the slight click when his thumb pressed back the
safety-catch on his Colt .45.</p>

<p>Like a wraith, he stole into the house. It was so ripped apart that he could
see its emptiness. Toward the rear he saw that one door, on a single hinge,
stood ajar. The Phantom peered in cautiously.</p>

<p>There in the twilight gloom a slouch-hatted figure crouched at that broken
window over an automatic rifle which, Van saw by its extra coiled drum, had
been converted into a machine gun.</p>

<p>From the portion of his sharp profile which the Phantom could see, Van knew
that the would-be sniper was the hatchet-faced thug called Choppy.</p>

<p>The Phantom's slitted eyes narrowed in their purpose. He would get the truth
from that felon in there, find out how this ambush had been pre-arranged. And
why?</p>

<p>Cautiously, he moved the door. Then his breath sucked in. Despite his
caution, the door creaked on its single hinge. There was nothing for it save to
push on boldly in. He did so, whipping up his pistol.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, Choppy started. As he turned, his husky voice spoke:</p>

<p>"That you, Monk? That Phantom bird hasn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off in mid-sentence, hatchet-face blanching. For now he saw the
domino-masked face coming toward him.</p>

<p>Coming like a grim Nemesis which every outlaw dreaded and secretly
feared.</p>

<p>With a snarl of frightened rage, the thug snatched up the automatic
rifle.</p>

<p>Desperation gave him almost superhuman speed. The barrel, sawed off in
front, swung around and loomed blackly toward Van.</p>

<p>Crack!</p>

<p>It was the deep bark of the Phantom's Colt that shattered the empty,
half-wrecked house. Van fired as he would at a desperate, dangerous beast.</p>

<p>The thug named Choppy seemed to freeze like a stone statue. Then the gun
slanted crazily, clattered to the floor. And Choppy slowly slumped down after
it, the life gone from his glazing eyes as he sprawled in a heap.</p>

<p>Grim-eyed, the Phantom moved forward. He glanced through the window. No one
in sight. The shot evidently had not been heard&mdash;the rumble of trucks on West
Street was enough to drown out more than one gun.</p>

<p>He looked down at the dead thug. He felt no sympathy for the felon, but he
was sorry he had been forced to kill. Now his mind worked swiftly, to adjust to
the grim situation. A glance at his wrist-watch showed it was just short of six
o'clock. Outside the night was gathering.</p>

<p>Choppy had thought Van was Monk, the gang-leader, coming in here. Obviously
he expected Monk, or others of the gang. But Van doubted that this old house
could be the "chateau" the gunmen had mentioned last night. It was not a good
hideout. It was only an ambush. Yet, perhaps any moment now, other gangsters
would show up.</p>

<p>A grim decision came to Van then. It was six o'clock, and the fact that
Queen Stella had not shown up made him feel the whole thing had been a trick to
get him here.</p>

<p>He had turned the tables. Dared he go one step further, a step that might
actually enable him to get directly on the trail of the criminal he sought?</p>

<p>His thoughts rapidly turned into swift action. He dragged the corpse of
Choppy across the floor. It was still light enough to see, and he got more
illumination when, once more, he drew out his flat make-up kit, snapped open
the mirrored lid.</p>

<p>The corpse became his model, a model he now set out to reproduce on his own
face with all his skill at disguise. Long, carefully drawn shadows gave his
cheeks the hollows which made them look narrow and hatchet-like. A tiny bit of
spring wire pinched his nostrils together, making them sharp and pointed like
those of the thug. A cream-dye, rubbed into his hair, gave it Choppy's mousy
color.</p>

<p>He took Choppy's clothes then, got into them. The blood-stain on the coat
was small; he covered it with some more make-up. The clothes were tight, but he
managed to pull them on, managed to put Choppy's slouch hat over his own
head.</p>

<p>Hiding the corpse was his next problem. He solved it quickly. In the
interior of the house, he found a corner piled with refuse. Minutes more, and
he had Choppy's body screened behind it, hidden safely enough for the time
being.</p>

<p>Again he slipped back to the rear room and peered out the window. His lips
clamped back a sudden surprised exclamation.</p>

<p>Across the lot, under the lamp at the corner, apparently waiting, stood the
slender figure of a girl! The aerialist had come to the rendezvous after
all.</p>

<p>Van's mind raced. Was she actually intended as the bait for the trap, or was
she innocent? In which case the gangsters must have learned of her rendezvous
with the Phantom, and tried to turn it to their advantage.</p>

<p>In any event, the Phantom could not throw away this opportunity to meet the
girl who had been missing since that murder at the Palladium Club.</p>

<p>Reaching a quick decision, he pulled his slouch hat a little lower, slipped
out of the house the way he had come in. Again he circled the block warily,
once more approaching the corner where the lamp-light cast its aura.</p>

<p>The girl was standing there, looking up and down the street anxiously. She
wore a thin white summer coat, a halo hat. There was grace in every line of her
slender body. But there was tension, too. Her white-gloved hands tugged at her
purse.</p>

<p>The Phantom moved, unseen by her, until he was at the very fringe of the
lighted corner&mdash;in the shadow of the last building there.</p>

<p>Then, low and soft, in a voice that was noncommittal, he called, "Queen
Stella!"</p>

<h3>Chapter IX "CHOPPY" INVESTIGATES</h3>

<p>Starting, the girl whirled. Her delicately featured, oval face showed
whitely beneath auburn hair. For a moment she was confused, frightened.</p>

<p>Then she saw the vague figure standing in the gloom.</p>

<p>She stepped closer. But Van kept his slouch-hatted head down so she could
not see him clearly.</p>

<p>"You came&mdash;" she almost questioned in a taut voice. It was impossible to
tell from her tone whether she was grateful or not. But evidently she assumed
he was the Phantom, for her words rushed on:</p>

<p>"You must not try to detain me. There is one thing I must tell you. It's
about Al Millett&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes?" he prompted as she hesitated, his voice non-committal.</p>

<p>Her words came out passionately now; "Al Millett is not the fiend the police
think! He was just a good actor&mdash;that's all! A charlatan, call him!"</p>

<p>Van's eyes narrowed. How did this girl&mdash;who could not be more than in her
early twenties&mdash;talk so surely about Al Millett? And her voice was desperate,
pleading, he noticed.</p>

<p>"You must believe me," she almost sobbed. "You must not hunt him down like a
rat."</p>

<p>As she spoke she was shaking her purse, a white purse that gleamed in the
light. It might have been purely nervousness, but on the other hand&mdash;"You and
the police are wasting time seeking Al Millett. He isn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Phantom moved with the speed of lightning!</p>

<p>He had felt, rather than heard, the stealthy steps on the pavement. Now he
saw dark shadowy figures, saw automatics whipping up toward his own figure.</p>

<p>Instantly he leaped past the girl, directly into the light of the
street-lamp which shone upon his made-up face!</p>

<p>He knew that at that instant he was closer to death than he had ever been
before. He knew that if his disguise were imperfect, if there were any
flaw&mdash;Behind him now he heard the click-click of running high heels. The
girl&mdash;running away! But he had no time for her now. Those revolvers were
leveled right at him.</p>

<p>Then, "Hold it, guys! Hell, it's Choppy!" snarled the voice of Monk
Gorman.</p>

<p>Van now turned around in feigned surprise which hid his relief. He saw the
big, slickered gang leader coming forward with lowering gun. Saw the
broken-nosed Gus, the pallid-faced Tony, and one other capped thug.</p>

<p>"Sure, it's me!" he answered, simulating perfectly the husky voice of
Choppy, though he had heard it but briefly. "Who the hell did you think I
was?"</p>

<p>The girl had vanished now. She was nowhere in sight.</p>

<p>Monk Gorman cursed. "What the devil you doin' out here, Choppy? Your orders
was to wait in the house, so when that Phantom guy came&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Choppy was talkin' to the dame!" Gus put in.</p>

<p>"Sure, I was," Van returned. He knew he was on delicate, perilous ground
now. For he still couldn't tell whether the girl had deliberately signaled
these gunmen or not. "She stopped me and begun to talk. I'd come out&mdash;to see
why the Phantom guy hadn't showed up," he said, with clever ambiguity.</p>

<p>"Okay, okay, forget it!" growled Monk Gorman. "So th' Phantom didn't fall
for th' dame's gag, eh?"</p>

<p>"Maybe that blast really got him last night," Gus suggested.</p>

<p>"Nix!" Monk growled. "The boss said he's still alive."</p>

<p>Van's eyes narrowed imperceptibly. How could this "Boss" of theirs be sure
that he was alive?</p>

<p>"Well, come on guys. No sense waitin' around&mdash;and cops might show." Monk
Gorman gestured impatiently with his gun. "Jes' as well come, too, Choppy."</p>

<p>Choppy followed the rest obediently. He was grateful that they did not go
back to the house. Either Gorman had forgotten or cared nothing about leaving
Choppy's automatic rifle there.</p>

<p>The mob leader led the way hurriedly around a corner to the same dark sedan
which had been used for Van's kidnaping the night before.</p>

<p>Once more the Phantom rode in that car, this time as a member of the gang,
seated in the rear between Monk and Gus.</p>

<p>The ride proved a long one. The car worked eastward across the city as the
night gathered. Again it rolled openly through traffic. Once it passed right by
a police radio prowl-car&mdash;and Monk huddled back, gripping his gun. But the
bluecoats did not suspect the sedan.</p>

<p>Van was silent&mdash;not risking any questions, lest he betray the fact he was an
impostor. A grim hope sustained him as he played this perilous masquerade. If
only it led him where he surmised it should.</p>

<p>The mists of another waterfront slowly engulfed the rolling car. The East
River, this time. Up onto the ramp of the Queensborough Bridge. There was still
no conversation, the gunmen evidently feeling tense while in traffic. The car
followed the bridge traffic into Queens, and onto Vernon Boulevard.</p>

<p>Northward Tony now drove at a rapid clip through the deepening night. As the
road grew more lonely, Monk Gorman sighed, leaned forward.</p>

<p>"We'll be plenty early tonight," he gruffed. "An' we ain't bringin' such
good news. You sure you didn't see that Phantom guy, Choppy?"</p>

<p>"I tole you," retorted the man they thought was Choppy. "I was watchin' for
him, all set to let him have it. Hell, you don't think I'd let that bird go if
I got a chance to plug him, do ya?" Convincing underworld hatred of the Phantom
threaded his tone.</p>

<p>"I guess you wouldn't." Gorman laughed evilly. "Not since the Boss fixed up
that special medicine for crossers&mdash;<i>the Ladle!"</i></p>

<p>As he pronounced those last words, Van saw the other thugs shudder
perceptibly.</p>

<p>"<i>The Ladle</i> sure is a tough rap!" the broken-nosed Gus put in. "Maybe it
wouldn't work in winter, but now&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tony gave a nervous laugh from the front seat:</p>

<p>"The Boss musta been in a hot country all right to think o' that one!"</p>

<p>Van made a pretense of joining their mingled awe and dread. What, he
wondered, was this thing they called <i>the Ladle</i>? Why did they mention the "Boss"
as having been in a hot country?</p>

<p>The gunmen fell silent again as lights and buildings loomed ahead. The sedan
was rolling into Astoria. It passed on to the outskirts on to a road now where
huge shed-like buildings, some of them having as many glass panes as
greenhouses, reared in the night.</p>

<p>Motion picture studios! Here the big companies produced their small
percentage of eastern-made pictures. Van's eyes narrowed in his disguised face.
Gordon Drake owned some of those studios, he knew.</p>

<p>They passed the last of the line of sheds, rolled on a full mile more. And
then, well-isolated from all the rest, another studio loomed. And here the car
slowed.</p>

<p>This studio bore little resemblance to the modern structures they had
passed. It looked small and old, deserted&mdash;with cracks in its many glass
panes.</p>

<p>Obviously a relic of bygone days of the old silent movies which were thrown
together hurriedly and cheaply, their casts composed of actors who were ashamed
to be associated with the new show medium.</p>

<p>Even the grounds where it stood were deserted and isolated. The sedan turned
into a side road and came to a stop before the dark building. In the gloom, Van
saw other shadowy cars on the grounds.</p>

<p>"Okay, guys!" Gorman directed. "End of th' line."</p>

<p>The Phantom, his pulses throbbing, piled out of the car with the rest and
followed Gorman to a boarded-up door. The leader gave a sharp rap, a timed
signal and gruff challenge issued from within.</p>

<p>"Open up!" Monk growled.</p>

<p>The barrier opened. Past a shadowy, capped man who was evidently on guard,
Monk led his companions. Through gloom, thence through another doorway, into
the vast interior of the studio.</p>

<p>To Van's astonishment, there were lights here&mdash;a dim but ample illumination
coming from bulbs strung on wires. His heart tightened with inner excitement.
These lights were cleverly hidden despite the glass-paned building. For the
glass was painted on the inside so it would be opaque. The paint looked fresh,
recent.</p>

<p>Devilishly clever! From the outside this studio looked deserted, empty and
dark. But inside it could teem with life.</p>

<p>The hum of many gruff, coarse voices filled the place. Standing or seated on
packing boxes and other bits of equipment were a whole crowd of men, all of
whom bore&mdash;in their manner, guise, or voice&mdash;the stamp of the underworld.</p>

<p>The Fang's gang! Assembled here, and members still coming in! Van recognized
some of them. He saw the gash-mouthed man whose name was Pete, and whose
shoulder was in a sling&mdash;Van had wounded him in that fight when he had posed as
Eddie Collins. He saw others whom he recognized only by memory of rogue's
gallery pictures.</p>

<p>Here in this old studio were gathered the co-ordinated mobsters of four
former leaders who had been killed, their power usurped! The most powerful mob
of desperadoes ever organized under one leadership! It was amazing.</p>

<p>They were all in attitudes of leisure. Some played cards, others smoked,
others bent over a crap game. Van, still with Monk's crowd, walked into the
midst of this devilish gathering, feeling like a man who has entered a den of
beasts!</p>

<p>Inwardly, he prayed that his disguise was good enough to pass him by them
all. That no one would suspect that he wasn't the real Choppy.</p>

<p>His eyes took in the strange surroundings. Piles of old sets in corners.
Tarpaulin-covered shapes here and there on the floor. Part of the old
equipment, presumably.</p>

<p>Monk swaggered through the gathering as voices greeted him.</p>

<p>"Okay, men, okay!" came his salutary reply. "We gotta wait here now, maybe
some time. Meanwhile, let's see if we got everything ship-shape. Spike!"</p>

<p>A thug came forward.</p>

<p>"What'd you do with the bundle?" Monk asked, and Van saw the big man pale
strangely.</p>

<p>"It's over there in the corner. I was afraid to get rid of it, Monk&mdash;until I
got definite orders. Maybe somebody would find&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Okay. But hell, we don't want it around here. Well, leave it go."</p>

<p>Van had followed the speech closely, as well as the thug's pointing
finger.</p>

<p>"Hey, Choppy&mdash;wanna come in?" one of the crap-shooters suddenly jerked up
with the question.</p>

<p>"Naw," Van answered. Crap-shooting was something no two men did alike. He
couldn't risk impersonating Choppy at rolling the dice. "Count me out tonight.
I'm feelin' kinda low cause I didn't spot that Phantom guy."</p>

<p>"Well, can you beat that? First time Choppy ever dodged a crap game!" one of
the others put in. And Van tensed. He must be careful, extremely careful.</p>

<p>Discreetly, he withdrew from the players. Moving unobtrusively, he threaded
his way through the studio. He knew where he wanted to go, but he was taking
his time getting there, making sure to attract no suspicion or attention.</p>

<p>Slowly, cautiously, he worked his way towards the corner of the studio to
which the thug named Spike had pointed. As yet he saw nothing there but old
refuse.</p>

<p>The atmosphere, he could feel now was getting tenser as the night deepened.
There was a sense of expectancy among these thugs that made Van determined to
stay here, to see this thing through. He had abandoned the idea of getting out
while he still might manage it to call the police to surround the lair. For
that would not catch the criminal he really sought.</p>

<p>Finally he drew close to that shadowy corner. He glanced around. No one
looking this way. Monk had gone off to speak to others of the mob.</p>

<p>The Phantom moved swiftly, for a moment he was out of the role of Choppy,
using his own lithe speed. The shadows of the corner engulfed him. His eyes
darted around as he moved.</p>

<p>Suddenly his foot collided with something heavy, lumpy. He glanced down.
There was a burlap bundle at his feet. It was not very large, yet Van felt a
premonitory chill as he glanced at it. Something ugly and sinister about that
bundle! He remembered Monk's paling face.</p>

<p>The Phantom stooped. His hands reached the burlap. He had to roll the bundle
to get the covering off, so he gave a quick jerk. Then his blood went cold, as
two bloody, gruesome shapes tumbled out of the wrapping.</p>

<p>A pair of human legs!</p>

<p>Legs hacked off above the knee, hideously amputated&mdash;with severed bone,
bloody arteries and tendons showing raw and ghastly. But what filled the
Phantom with a sense of horrified revulsion was the size of those legs.</p>

<p>They were small&mdash;spindly! The legs of a child!</p>

<p>For a moment all Van's conception of the case was thrown into a turmoil. Was
this some new kind of crime of the devilish murderer who called himself the
Fang? Was it possible that he had killed a helpless child?</p>

<p>Somewhere in the studio a bell clanged sharply.</p>

<p>It brought Van up rigid, made him whirl in alarm. Quick relief came as he
saw that no eyes were turned in his direction. All were looking the other way,
toward the other end of the studio.</p>

<p>Monk's voice rose then. "Get your places, everybody! Hurry! Choppy! Where
the hell's Choppy?"</p>

<h3>Chapter X KLIEG LIGHTS</h3>

<p>Just like that! Caught here at this moment, the Phantom knew suspicion would
fasten upon him.</p>

<p>His mind raced. Then, deliberately, he raised his voice "Okay, okay, I'm
comin'!"</p>

<p>But his voice did not seem to come from where he was hastily rewrapping the
burlap around the gruesome, spindly legs. Instead, it seemed to come vaguely
from the crowd of thugs. Ventriloquism was an art the Phantom had mastered
along with all other arts of mimicry and disguise.</p>

<p>Quickly thrusting the gruesome bundle wrapped back into the shadows, he
darted along the wall and came out in the center of the studio, presenting
himself to Monk Gorman all in a breathless second.</p>

<p>"You stay by me," Monk ordered. "You gotta report on th' Phantom guy." As he
spoke, others were busily removing the tarpaulin from the shapes Van had
assumed to be old equipment. Black metal showed&mdash;a glimmer of glass. Then, a
sudden hiss&mdash;and Van recoiled, his eyes suddenly blinded, dazzled.</p>

<p>A dozen super-powerful arc lights had suddenly gone on simultaneously.
Kliegs! The modern, blazing lights of the movies! These were the shapes which
the tarpaulins had hidden.</p>

<p>Their blinding flood blotted out the mild glow of other lights as though
they had not been. Their heat permeated the studio almost like a blast.</p>

<p>The entire mob was thrown into vivid clearness, every face showing clear.
Van felt trepidation about his make-up. He was glad he had spent some time
putting on the disguise. For it must withstand that glare!</p>

<p>Monk seated himself on a packing case. Van followed suit. All others settled
down facing the array of lights which, the Phantom saw, were grouped so that
they came from one general direction&mdash;the opposite end of the studio. Blinking,
the thugs must expose themselves to the full torture of the glare which was
like a solid wall, beyond and behind which no human eye could possibly see.</p>

<p>As all voices ceased talking, and a hush fell over the assemblage, Van
sensed a presence behind that wall of glaring light. An evil presence which
intruded itself here in this strange studio hideout, making its horror felt
even by the hardened crooks. Abruptly the silence was broken. A voice rang out
from beyond the lights, a rasping, blighting voice: "This meeting is now in
order! No one is to leave his place unless told to do so!"</p>

<p>Van listened carefully to the rasped tones, as his companions stiffened in
mingled awe and dread. The Phantom could not identify the voice as any he had
heard. He strained his eyes futilely to penetrate beyond the glare. Did he see
a vague shape in that gloom beyond them? He could not tell&mdash;for the shape
blurred into myriad dancing colors as his eyeballs ached from the sheer
attempt.</p>

<p>"So far," the voice spoke again, "I have few complaints to make. You have
proved yourself an obedient and efficient mob! Your former leaders must have
trained you well! But they were small fry! You are working for a real Big Shot
now! Already you have seen the returns! But that is what you, in your parlance,
call chicken-feed! I have news for you tonight, good news!"</p>

<p>The men in the glaring light leaned forward with tense eagerness. Van's own
eyes were narrowed now. His hand was close to the pocket where he had
substituted Choppy's automatic pistol for his own.</p>

<p>He knew that the man who stood hidden behind that battery of light was
indeed the criminal he sought, the brain behind this ghastly trail of death and
robbery! But the criminal was well protected from any possible attack. Those
lights made him an impossible target. He could see every face, every move,
without being seen himself!</p>

<p>"I have news!" the voice rasped out. "Tomorrow the police of New York will
see a robbery unparalleled! A robbery of millions&mdash;millions, which I shall
share with you all! It is for this that I have prepared you, for this I have
gathered you into one great mob!"</p>

<p>There was a tense, eager intake of breaths. Van's own lips tightened. A
robbery! A climax to the crimes&mdash;tomorrow!</p>

<p>Monk suddenly rose now, spoke gruffly. "Listen, Boss! I'm in charge of it,
ain't I? Have you changed your plans? Or are you gonna take care o' things at
the office of that feller Drake?"</p>

<p>Even as Van pricked up his ears at the name, the voice of the master
criminal snarled out with sudden menace that made Monk recoil. "That will do,
Monk! I'll give you the proper orders at the right time."</p>

<p>Gordon Drake, the movie producer. And this was a studio! Why was the
criminal so quick to suppress that name? Why had Monk mentioned it in
connection with the robbery?</p>

<p>These questions raced through Van's mind while he listened. "Sometimes,
Monk," the voice came like a purr now, "you are too impulsive! Perhaps Ricco,
or one of those others, would have made a better lieutenant!"</p>

<p>"No, Boss!" Monk trembled. "Hell&mdash;I just sorta got excited, thinkin' of all
that dough!"</p>

<p>"Very well. But be careful. Remember&mdash;<i>the Ladle</i> awaits bunglers as
well as traitors!"</p>

<p>Again, this time from the criminal leader, came that peculiar name. And men
shifted. Van saw several eyes glance upwards, towards the high ceiling. He saw
nothing there but the cross-beams of a gallery and roof.</p>

<p>"I am impatient enough with you. You didn't get the Phantom tonight, did
you?"</p>

<p>It was a statement rather than a question. The devilish Boss
knew&mdash;somehow!</p>

<p>Monk spoke quickly, defensively. "He didn't show up, Boss. Only the dame
showed. At least that's what Choppy says," he was quick to shift the blame. "He
was talkin' to the dame when we come by to pick him up.</p>

<p>"Choppy!" Van's heart tightened as the criminal rasped out the name. "Step
up front and let me have some words with you!"</p>

<p>The Phantom did not risk hesitation.</p>

<p>Rising, knowing that all eyes were on him, he strode forward before the
gathering.</p>

<p>"Closer! I want to see you!"</p>

<p>Still Van dared not hesitate. He walked closer&mdash;until the array of lights
met him, the heat of them engulfed him.</p>

<p>He felt sweat pop out beneath his make-up. Now he saw a dim, shadowy shape
beyond the lights. But he could distinguish nothing. He could feel eyes probing
him, scrutinizing him.</p>

<p>"Well, Choppy? Why did you talk to the girl?"</p>

<p>"It was like this, Boss," Van replied in the voice of Choppy. He told the
same story he had told Gorman&mdash;that when the Phantom hadn't shown up he had
gone out to look, the girl had accosted him, started talking to him, that he
was trying to pump her when Monk startled her away.</p>

<p>"What did she say? Who did she think you were?" came the cross-examination
from the gloom.</p>

<p>Van took the cue he read in that question. "She seemed to think I was the
Phantom guy," he said, realizing how perilous was the implication of the words.
"It was kinda dark, an'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;" There was a pause. Then, to Van's tense relief: "All right, Choppy."
And Van turned to go from that hot glare which was searing his very flesh.</p>

<p>"Just a moment," the voice called him back, and he had to remain. "I want
you to keep in mind, Choppy, and all the rest of you&mdash;that we must get the
Phantom!" Hate threaded the rasping tones now. "He alone stands in my way,
dares to cross my trail! He must be destroyed. Destroyed and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Abruptly, the voice broke off. Simultaneously, Van's heart stopped in its
very beat! His every nerve flashed the frightful warning to his brain!</p>

<p>He felt it then! Something was oozing down his face, wet and sticky! Melting
make-up!</p>

<p>The make-up of Choppy's features was changing, blurring and lengthening
under the arch criminal's eyes. The Klieg lights! Van had not thought their
heat was quite so strong! But they had done this deadly work!</p>

<p>There was a roar like that of a beast from the astounded leader.</p>

<p>The Phantom dropped to the floor, and began rolling to one side as a flash
of flame leaped, just visible, from behind the lights. A flash of flame, and
another!</p>

<p>He heard the bullets whine over his head, heard yells from the rest of the
gang. He got out his own gun, whipped it around, fired two shots in the general
direction whence those flashes had showed. But the uninterrupted roaring of
that snarling voice told him he had missed.</p>

<p>"Grab him, you fools! He's an impostor! Hey, Rube!"</p>

<p>Van tried for another shot, this time in the direction of the voice, but,
like a pack of sudden charging wolves, a score of thugs were upon him!</p>

<p>They, too, saw the running make-up now, and understood. For a moment Van
thought they would tear him apart. Their feet kicked him so that his aching
body doubled; their fists crashed to his sticky face, their revolvers swung
like clubs at him. Disarmed, stunned, still blinded by the glare of lights, he
could not resist capture.</p>

<p>He was yanked toward the front lights again. Monk's big paw, holding a
handkerchief, was swabbing at his face. But the make-up, though smeared, was
indelible enough to keep his real features covered&mdash;his only boon in this
moment of trapped helplessness.</p>

<p>"So you thought to spy on us, did you?" the voice rasped out savagely. "I
can guess who you are. You're the Phantom! What have you done to Choppy?"</p>

<p>Van neither denied nor affirmed anything. He was silent, inwardly fighting
against a surge of despair. Those lights had betrayed him, and he had been
neatly trapped!</p>

<p>"You won't talk? You'll regret that; you'll be raving for mercy!" came the
savage voice. "Dawn is almost come, and the weather promises fair!" Van
wondered at this poetic digression. "Whatever you may have learned here,
Phantom, will never leave your lips!"</p>

<p>Van thought of what little he had learned. There was to be a robbery of
tremendous magnitude. There was something connected with Gordon Drake's office.
And there was&mdash;in a corner of this studio&mdash;the most jarring bizarre note in
this whole mystery. A wrapped pair of childlike legs!</p>

<p>"Take him," the unseen criminal roared then, "to <i>the Ladle</i>!"</p>

<p>"Come on, guys!" Monk took up the command, in savage delight.</p>

<h3>Chapter XI A TRICK WITH MIRRORS</h3>

<p>Helpless, the Phantom was dragged across the glare-lit floor of the studio,
to one side, where there was a flight of ascending stairs.</p>

<p>The gangsters took him up to that gallery above. Then still further upwards,
ascending a narrow steep stairs. The fresh air of outdoors suddenly smote the
Phantom. He saw the sky above, the stars fading in the first grey flush of
dawn.</p>

<p>They had taken him to the roof of the studio&mdash;to what seemed to be a huge
pit in the otherwise slanted, glass-paned roof. At the edge of this sunken pit
was a small, open-fronted shed. In it Van caught a momentary glimpse of
gleaming levers.</p>

<p>He was lowered to this platform above the pit. Kept there by menacing guns
and rough hands. He shifted his gaze to the pit itself.</p>

<p>Within the pit was a huge, globular affair. It had a peculiar sheen,
reflecting off every trace of light, so that it seemed like an immense bowl of
scintillating jewels, something like the mirror-set globes that twirled under
the beam of a spot-light to reflect dots of light on a dance floor.</p>

<p>The Phantom knew at once what this was. That bowl was made of a collection
of reflectors, the powerful concentrating reflectors used in motion picture
making. It was a sun mirror of sinister and diabolical design.</p>

<p>Monk was talking to the broken-nosed Gus. "You'll stick here, Gus, an' take
care o' this! You know how to move them levers! It's set now, by the Boss
himself, for sunrise. You make the first change at six-thirty, an' every
fifteen minutes after that. Here, I'm givin' you my watch&mdash;it keeps right
time!"</p>

<p>Van, still twisting his head amid his captors, saw Monk handing over a large
gold watch&mdash;saw Gus taking it.</p>

<p>At that moment, the Phantom noticed that his captors were momentarily
relaxed.</p>

<p>Their eyes were on Monk and Gus.</p>

<p>A wave of grim desperation fired the Phantom's muscles with a sudden surge
of strength. With a gritted oath, he leaped to his feet, his lithe body hurling
upward in the very midst of his captors!</p>

<p>His feet crashed out before him like a ball of iron. It caught the heavy
beefy face of the nearest thug and sent him sprawling. Before others could
recover from their surprise, the Phantom hurled across the platform&mdash;against
the broken-nosed Gus!</p>

<p>Gus snarled an oath. The rest, drawing their guns, dared not fire for fear
of hitting their companions. Van's hand snaked down at Gus's wrists, one of
which was still taped. He pushed Gus toward the shed while the latter wrestled
furiously.</p>

<p>Even then the others closed in, raising revolver butts like vicious clubs.
But the Phantom still fought with Gus in the faint, dim light of the open shed.
His right hand was busy at Monk's watch while his left held Gus in a crushing
head-lock.</p>

<p>A second more&mdash;give him a second more!</p>

<p>Myriad stars danced before his eyes as a gun-butt smashed against his skull.
Hands, like talons, tore him away from the cursing, frightened Gus. The rain of
blows left little consciousness in his body.</p>

<p>The next thing he knew, he was being taken down into that glittering,
reflector-lined bowl. It swayed under gangster feet. In its very center was a
metal shaft which rose vertically out of the base of the bowl like the stamen
of a flower.</p>

<p>To this the Phantom was bound with steel wire! It seared through his
clothes, through his very flesh.</p>

<p>He knew that he was trapped, was in the worst predicament that ever had
overtaken him! Yet, even as the gangsters climbed out, leaving him here, there
was a hope in his heart, even though it was a feeble hope.</p>

<p>"Okay, Gus! We gotta go," came Monk's voice. A moment later the big man's
coarse face appeared, over the rim of the bowl. "So long, Phantom!" he gloated
mockingly. "You'll be yellin' your head off soon enough! An' no one'll hear
you! You may be a tough bird, but you'll jes' be a fried egg now. Sorry I can't
wait to hear you sizzle."</p>

<p>The coarse face withdrew. There was a receding tramp of feet as the gang
filed down from the roof. Only the broken-nosed Gus remained. He paced the
platform above Van, glancing down now and then, first at the captive and then
at his borrowed watch.</p>

<p>The Phantom had already begun to struggle carefully against his bonds. Thus
far no bonds, or rope or wire, had ever been strong enough to hold him. He knew
he could get out of these, but it would take time&mdash;too much time, he
feared.</p>

<p>For now the sky was growing lighter. Dawn was on hand. And the wires were
still searing deep into his flesh.</p>

<p>He heard sounds of motors-cars starting, gears shifting. He knew that the
meeting was breaking up below. The mob was leaving to perpetrate that gigantic
robbery while he remained here, helpless. The criminal leader, the murderer
whom the police sought as Al Millett, the Fang, would be taking his secret
departure while the Phantom was powerless to prevent him.</p>

<p>Going loose again, to commit more crimes! A murderer who had killed two men
by brutally ripping out their sides, braining a third with a cudgel, leaving a
fourth corpse with a broken crowbar in his skull and&mdash;Van thought of those
childlike, spindly legs, and revulsion sickened him.</p>

<p>Gus swaggered above the rim of the Phantom's open-air prison, complete
monarch of this domain by virtue of the departure of all the rest. He watched
the sky eagerly.</p>

<p>The Phantom, struggling against the wire bonds at every opportunity, also
watched the sky.</p>

<p>Slowly it began to redden in the East. The red turned to gold. The sun rose,
bursting into slow but brilliant life. The bowl in which the Phantom stood
bound glowed dazzlingly then in prismatic splendor. The rays of the sun hit the
reflectors&mdash;and one and all, they awoke to life and magnified the rays,
concentrated them upon the Phantom.</p>

<p>Even though the sun was as yet not in its full power, those intensified
beams immediately seared through Van's clothes, began to warm, then blister his
flesh! Sweat oozed down his face, down his body, in rivulets.
<i>The Ladle</i>&mdash;diabolic invention of a devilish criminal&mdash;was beginning its fatal, ghastly
work!</p>

<p>Van, with his knowledge of science had calculated that work on first glimpse
of the device. It was simple&mdash;fiendishly simple. The bowl was so arranged that,
by a mechanism, it could be turned with the moving sun at timed intervals, the
levers in the shed motivating the turning. And each new angle would be
calculated to cause the sunlight gathered by its concave-mirror walls to focus
on the Phantom's bound body!</p>

<p>Van Loan understood now why the crooks had mentioned the likelihood of the
Boss having come from a "hot country." They were right; he had come from
Hell.</p>

<p>Even now the blinding, concentrated heat was growing. It was eddying upon
the Phantom in waves. His eyes were unable to meet it, his flesh seemed to coil
and wither. His sweat was drying now. And the wires that still held him were
also growing unbearably hot!</p>

<p>To yell was futile&mdash;else he would not have been left ungagged. He must
conserve his strength; he must keep cool. He had used his most consummate skill
and science while wrestling with Gus. Had he miscalculated?</p>

<p>"Well, Phantom? How's the weather down there now?" The mocking tones of Gus
floated down to him. Through his already heat-swollen eyes he saw the
broken-nosed thug through a red haze. "At six-thirty I'll give you a little
swing."</p>

<p>The Phantom worked desperately at his bonds. With the heat blaze that
enveloped him growing ever hotter, he could not long withstand it. Death would
be a matter of perhaps a half hour of such exposure&mdash;a long half-hour of
torture, of blistering flesh, of blinded eyes! For the sun was shining at him
through so many magnifying glasses; the bowl was hot as blazing fire.</p>

<p>He struggled coolly, systematically&mdash;knowing well that it would take him
more than thirty minutes to get out of this wire. As it was, he knew he could
not retain consciousness for many more minutes. His very stoicism was rebelling
against the agony of the heat which had not yet begun to do its real
damage.</p>

<p>Tropical death in Astoria! It seemed an ironical joke&mdash;a crazy paradox. Yet,
it was coming if he had made an error. He gritted his teeth. He would know
shortly, at least. And then, when he really felt his face beginning to blister,
Gus's voice chortled again.</p>

<p>"Six-thirty&mdash;an' Monk's watch is always right!"</p>

<p>Gus's footsteps banged on the wooden platform beyond the rim. He went into
the shed to the levers. There came a sound of meshing cogs, the hum of
electricity. <i>The Ladle</i> began moving like a huge swing. And at that
moment Van clung to the one hope that sustained him.</p>

<p>He waited breathlessly for the effect of the moving bowl. Timed properly, it
would only bring the sun's shifting rays hotter upon him. But improperly timed,
it would be out of focus.</p>

<p>His heart soared! The blaze of light that was meant to destroy him shifted
just a little to one side of his bound body, as the wabbling bowl went still.
Those rays were no longer directly upon him, though the bowl itself was still a
fiery furnace.</p>

<p>Would Gus see this? Would his coarse faculties be shrewd enough to
comprehend the truth? This had been the whole purpose of that desperate scuffle
with Gus. Knowing he could not make any real break at that moment for liberty,
he had managed to do the one thing that was now reprieving him temporarily.</p>

<p>He had managed deftly, while keeping Gus's attention distracted by the
struggle, to reset Monk's watch&mdash;setting it forward by about eight minutes.
Eight minutes, enough to upset this device which was as mathematical as a
moving sundial. Gus had not been told what time the sun began its work. He had
been told only to start working the lever at six-thirty and make an adjustment
every fifteen minutes thereafter.</p>

<p>Hence the sun was now thrown off. Its blazing concentration point, unless
Gus suspected, would stay where it was, to one side of the Phantom. And Van, no
longer in the direct glare, began to recover his strength; his remarkable
stamina quickly generating new energy.</p>

<p>Gus's head appeared again above the rim. He peered down, blinking. The
brilliant reflectors defied detection of the actual concentration point.</p>

<p>Lest he look closer, Van now did the thing which his stoicism had repressed
when he was in real agony. He opened his dry mouth, began to groan, to yell, to
shout in cries of pain.</p>

<p>A cruel, mocking laugh rose above him. "Boy, oh boy, wish the gang was
here!" Gus chortled. "They'd like this&mdash;seein' how the Phantom can't really
take it after all! How he's just as human as the rest of us! Cripes! I wish I
had a pair o' smoked glasses."</p>

<p>He turned away, chortling.</p>

<p>Van again worked at the wires, worked until another fifteen minutes had
passed. Which he knew when again the bowl tilted and the motor hummed. Once
more the sun-glare of concentration remained fixed to one side of his body.</p>

<p>And then one arm came wresting out of the wires. The wrist caught, the wire
cutting into it excruciatingly. Van let the pain of it out in another
deliberate yell. He twisted the wrist, deftly, carefully at the same time.</p>

<p>It came free. One arm free was all the Phantom needed. The rest was a matter
of seconds.</p>

<p>The wires slid jerkily off his lithe body. He moved from the shaft, moved to
the sloping side of the bowl just beneath the platform. When he tried to touch
it, the heat of the mirrors seared his hands. He tore some of his own borrowed
clothing off to use as protection.</p>

<p>There was purchase in the interstices between the reflectors, and he began
to climb, the heat beating against his body. A little further now&mdash;almost to
the rim&mdash;</p>

<p>A yell of enraged alarm greeted him. Gus, turning on the platform, had seen!
With a snarl the thug leaped forward, gun whipping out. At the same instant,
the Phantom's body literally catapulted over the rim, over and forward!</p>

<p>Leaping with all his strength, Van Loan caught the thug's gun arm as the
frenzied man was taking aim! Instantly the two were struggling in a fierce
conflict on the platform! Struggling against the very rail of the platform,
beyond which the high studio roof inclined with its opaque panes of glass.</p>

<p>Gus, who was powerfully built, was fighting like a frightened beast ...
realizing he was up against the scourge of the underworld, a man he had twice
seen make miraculous escapes from certain death. Snarling, he pushed Van with
his whole body against the wooden rail.</p>

<p>It splintered, opening a gap. The Phantom's feet pulled him up as he swayed
perilously. Then, both his hands caught the thug who was lurching against him.
The thing he next did was instinctive.</p>

<p>A jiu jitsu hold, and Gus, heavy though he was, went flying through the air
over the Phantom's head. Screaming, the thug landed on the slanted glass roof.
The panes shattered, but the metal framework held. Gus fell forward from the
impetus, his body rolling, rolling. Grim-eyed, Van saw it reach the roof's
edge. Saw it topple off and go hurtling down through fully sixty feet of space,
to the stone paving below. There was a ghastly thud. The body, a tiny heap down
there, lay still The Phantom swore grimly. Gus, alive, might have told him
where that big robbery was to take place. But again he had had no chance to
take one of this desperate mob alive.</p>

<p>He walked tiredly to the roof entrance, into the studio, downward through
its interior.</p>

<p>The place was empty. Even that burlap-wrapped bundle&mdash;and all other evidence
was gone. The only thing left to do was to find where the big robbery was to
be, and to prevent it if possible.</p>

<p>He stood, swaying, exhausted and dizzied from his ghastly experience. For a
moment he felt too tired to go on&mdash;tired enough to drop right here. But then,
remembering Monk Gorman's reference to Gordon Drake, his body straightened; a
purposeful gleam leaped once more into his sun-dazzled eyes. He sprinted from
the building.</p>

<h3>Chapter XII THE ARMORED TRUCK JOB</h3>

<p>Morning activity to the average New Yorker, seemed the same as it did any
other sunny morning&mdash;the usual bustle of traffic and scurrying workers.</p>

<p>But actually there was a difference. All over the city police patrols had
been doubled. Extra prowl-cars were sweeping through every precinct. Squads of
detectives, men who usually waited at station houses for their calls, were out
on the streets, keen-eyed and alert.</p>

<p>For the police had received a tip from that Nemesis of Crime, the Phantom.
Somewhere a big robbery was about to break! And, while they scoured the
streets, Richard Curtis Van Loan himself stood, grim and expectant, in a closet
in the empty office of Gordon Drake, motion picture producer.</p>

<p>Again the Phantom was masked, the domino covering the features of a slightly
vacant-faced young Englishman in tweeds. He had slipped into this towering
office building before it had opened. His pliable bit of wire had picked the
lock of Gordon Drake's office. He was waiting for that which was supposed to
break at Drake's office.</p>

<p>Van had come to New York from the abandoned studio in Astoria in a car. He
had stopped off at his own penthouse apartment on Park Avenue for a shower,
shave, breakfast, and fresh change of clothes. He was little the worse for his
grueling experience&mdash;though his face was red with sunburn, under his
make-up.</p>

<p>At his apartment, Van had phoned Inspector Gregg, and then called the New
York Academy of Medicine, which had someone on duty night and day. He had
requested a service of them, a service that required them to canvass, by their
own swift means of communication, doctors throughout an entire nation!</p>

<p>"If you get any answers&mdash;kindly hold them for me," Van had finished. He had
identified himself as the Phantom in that call, explaining that the evidence
was vital to his case.</p>

<p>From Inspector Gregg he had learned of the progress of the case. The police
were still investigating the mysterious Count Karnov. They were still rounding
up any persons remotely resembling the Fang's description. Bernard J. Andrews
was still missing. Also, Queen Stella.</p>

<p>Van had taken these facts, then given his instructions to the police.</p>

<p>Now, cramped in the closet of Drake's sumptuous office, he waited
patiently.</p>

<p>Presently, as the morning sun slanted wider through the office windows, Van
heard a key in the lock. He pulled the closet door to a chink, through which he
could still command a view.</p>

<p>The frosted-glass door opened. Gordon Drake, the heavy-set movie producer,
strode in alone. He took off his cap stiffly, but left on his cape-like
topcoat.</p>

<p>He glanced about the office. Then, scowling, he began to pace back and forth
as if waiting. Van remained motionless in the closet.</p>

<p>Came a knock on the door. "Come," growled Drake, as though he expected
it.</p>

<p>Into the room strode two more of the men involved in the Fang case, men Van
recognized as Drake pronounced their names.</p>

<p>"Hello, Corbin&mdash;good morning, Meade!"</p>

<p>Paul Corbin, slender and effeminate night-club owner. Kenneth Meade, the
eccentric restaurateur who wore a long, tight buttoned coat and articulated
with difficulty.</p>

<p>Somehow, seeing the three of them together, Van sensed again that queer
feeling all the men involved gave everybody&mdash;something strange, intangible,
they had in common.</p>

<p>The three stood looking at each other. It was Corbin who spoke. The little
man seemed agitated.</p>

<p>"Drake, are you going to give your consent to this foolish plan!" he asked
in his high voice.</p>

<p>Drake shrugged. "It's out of my hands," came his reply. "I don't care a
hoot, to tell you the truth."</p>

<p>Meade shifted his heavy-coated frame. "I told Corbin he is on the wrong
track," he said in a hard labored voice.</p>

<p>"All right!" Corbin shrilled. He waved an angry hand at them. "You're going
to regret this, both of you. Mark my words!" Despite its shrillness, there was
menace in his tones. "You all think you're clever&mdash;but you're fools, see!
Fools!"</p>

<p>He whirled angrily, started for the door.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" Drake demanded. "What are you up to now, Corbin?"</p>

<p>Carbon's eyes blazed with a light that seemed almost fanatical to the
watching Phantom.</p>

<p>"I'm going out to prove," he said, as if too impulsive to weigh his words,
"that the police can still be fools, as well as you! That vast amount of
money&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off and stalked through the door. Meade started uncertainly after
him.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Meade," Drake said dryly. "There's really nothing we can do now.
The Gargoyles must trust each other. Corbin can do nothing."</p>

<p>The closet door swung open, revealing a masked man with leveled
automatic.</p>

<p>"But there's a great deal that I can do," Van's voice clipped, cold as the
steel of his own Colt automatic. "Do not move, gentlemen, if you value your
lives!"</p>

<p>Drake and Meade recoiled, violently startled.</p>

<p>"The Phantom!" exclaimed Drake, face paling.</p>

<p>"Right," snapped Van Loan. "I'll talk with you men later. Just now I've an
engagement with Mr. Corbin. Remain quietly here, if you value your lives."</p>

<p>He heard an elevator door closing even then. Corbin going down! Leaving the
two speechless and immobile, he darted out of the office and sprinted for the
elevator bank. He was not followed.</p>

<p>As he reached the elevator doors, pressing the down button, the Phantom took
off his mask. To his satisfaction, an express elevator stopped for him in the
next instant.</p>

<p>"Go straight down, buddy," he directed the operator.</p>

<p>"But I&mdash;" the capped man's protests ceased at the sight of the bill extended
towards him. The elevator didn't even make its express stops.</p>

<p>As it reached the main floor, its doors sliding open, Van saw that the other
elevator which had preceded it more slowly was just coming to a stop. The
slender figure of Corbin, hatless, walked hurriedly through the foyer and out
the main glass doors. Behind him walked a pleasant looking but vacant-faced
Englishman.</p>

<p>Van Loan saw Corbin climb into a small, expensive roadster. The motor
started with a hasty grind of the self-starter. The car slid from the curb,
quickly gathered speed as it headed across town.</p>

<p>Van hurried down the pavement, climbed into the coupe which he had left
parked there. It was a coupe he had borrowed from the Police Department&mdash;one
with special equipment with which the police were recently experimenting.</p>

<p>The Phantom's eyes flashed through the windshield even as he got the coupe
going. Corbin's car was shrinking across the next intersection. Van stepped on
the gas, maneuvered the coupe deftly through traffic, and when he was not far
behind the roadster, he settled down grimly to the trail.</p>

<p>Across town his quarry led him, then onto Broadway, headed down-town. Corbin
drove faster now, almost recklessly in the morning traffic. Once he passed a
red light. Van passed it, too.</p>

<p>Broadway narrowed as the two cars finally reached its lower extremities,
coming into the financial district with its tall skyscrapers and narrow,
canyon-like streets. The roadster swung east, went onto Broad Street. It turned
south again. Then, so suddenly that Van scarcely had time to follow suit, the
roadster skidded to an abrupt stop.</p>

<p>It had stopped almost opposite a square stone building on the corner&mdash;a
prominent bank which had its own truck entrance.</p>

<p>Out of that entrance now, a green-turreted armored truck was rolling,
obviously leaving the bank on some errand. The truck turned onto Broad
Street.</p>

<p>Van was still pressing down his own brake pedal, eyes on Corbin's roadster
which had stopped almost in front of the truck. And now, astonishingly,
Corbin's slender figure leaned out of its open door. Corbin was waving at the
armored truck&mdash;commanding it to stop.</p>

<p>In the next instant, even as a chill premonition flashed through Van,
several things happened at once, all with the breathless rapidity of a
speeded-up motion picture.</p>

<p>The armored truck slowed momentarily. Its green turret swung warningly. Two
sedans, a Buick and a Cadillac, suddenly curved clear across the street from
the other side, their gears meshing. From two angles they converged towards the
armored truck, which Corbin's car had already partially blocked.</p>

<p>The Phantom's foot left the brake pedal, going to the accelerator. His hand
was on the gear-shift, his eyes tense and grim. He sent the coupe hurtling
forward.</p>

<p>Above his engine he heard a spurt of fire. It came from the turret of the
armored truck. A repeating rifle&mdash;shooting warningly.</p>

<p>The Cadillac sedan suddenly swung straight in then, to one side of the green
truck. Van gave a cry. He saw something dark and heavy come hurtling out of the
Cadillac's rear window, arc through the air and&mdash;A most deafening explosion
shattered the morning air! A great blinding sheet of flame which quickly turned
into smoke blotted out the entire armored truck from view.</p>

<p>The Phantom felt his coupe shiver with that reverberating concussion which
shook his very teeth. The shatter-proof windshield in front of him became a
mass of spider-webs. He heard screams as the explosion died&mdash;saw people on the
pavement who had been hurled several feet, some of them badly hurt.</p>

<p>He was still driving the shaken coupe towards the scene. The billowing smoke
was just dissipating. He caught a glimpse of the armored truck&mdash;and his heart
chilled. The heavy vehicle was overturned, its wheels kicking around like some
wounded animal's. Its armor plate was dented, broken.</p>

<p>Slouch-hatted figures were leaping upon it like human vultures. Van saw a
big, slicker-clad form amid them. Monk Gorman! He saw them jerking open the
shattered door of the armored truck.</p>

<p>As he continued to drive towards the scene, eyes grim as death, his hand
moved to the dashboard of his coupe where there was an unusual array of dials.
He turned a switch. He yanked out a microphone hanging by its wire to the dash.
Driving with one hand, he spoke into the microphone in crisp tones: "Calling
all cars&mdash;1st Division!" he bit out. "All cars&mdash;Signal 30! Signal 30! Armored
car hold-up in progress at Broad Street and Fourth Street. Signal 30!"</p>

<p>He knew that his every word went through the powerful transmission set in
this car. Tuned to the short-wavelength of every prowl-car in the city, it went
out through the ether from the antenna atop Van's coupe. For this car was one
of the only two cars in the Department that could send out radio calls even as
the Voice at Headquarters sent them out.</p>

<p>Now the Phantom was at the scene. He saw the slouch-hatted mobsters
snatching bags and packages out of the armored truck, working with speed and
efficiency. In mere seconds they had evidently taken their loot&mdash;were scurrying
back to the two waiting sedans, ignoring the damaged roadster of Corbin and the
coupe of Van Loan.</p>

<p>The Cadillac started in the next instant. It swung away, bearing off its
part of the loot.</p>

<p>The Phantom dropped the microphone, took the wheel in both hands, his lips a
tight line of fierce purpose. He sent the little coupe careening around the
scene in a spurt of speed to head them off&mdash;at least delay them!</p>

<p>The Cadillac was gathering speed. The Phantom pushed his accelerator to the
floorboard. The coupe arced past the Cadillac, then diagonaled in on the big,
fleeing car.</p>

<p>A tommy gun began its snarling chatter. Van heard bullets pelt like hail
against the coupe's sides. One slug whined through the open window past his
face. He glanced to one side and back&mdash;saw Monk's coarse features in the rear
open window of the Cadillac behind the gibbering tommy.</p>

<p>The Cadillac, heavier and larger than the coupe, tried to threaten it out of
the way with heavy iron fenders. Van swerved out. The Cadillac started to pass
him. He saw it would get away.</p>

<p>He pulled his wheel hard around, his lithe body bracing simultaneously as he
floor-boarded his accelerator. Like a startled deer, the coupe leaped into the
side of the heavy Cadillac at an angle he thought should enable it to take the
crash without completely telescoping.</p>

<p>There was a frightful impact of metal against metal. The coupe shivered,
shaking every bone in the Phantom's body. Water spurted from the radiator,
steamily. Then, with a shrieking of tortured metal, the coupe was dragged
sideways. The Cadillac, locked by its running board with the coupe's fenders,
tried desperately to pull the lighter car with it.</p>

<p>Monk's face leaned out&mdash;murderous, livid, Van ducked as he saw the tommy
swinging to hose down the police car. Then, even as he thought the tommy would
blast his stanch little coupe to ribbons, he saw Monk and the others start to
abandon the Cadillac like frightened rats.</p>

<p>Only then did he hear the scream of sirens, scores of sirens, filling the
already noise-shattered street. Police cars! Green coupes! Hurtling dark
cruisers! Coming from two directions, turning in from every side street!
Blockading the whole vicinity!</p>

<p>The Phantom's radio call had brought a response. Those cars had been waiting
for just such a signal. "Signal 30&mdash;come quickly with drawn guns!"</p>

<p>Van leaped out of his wrecked, tangled coupe. The street was full of fresh
sounds of gunfire now. Police positives roared. Smoke curled insidiously in the
sun. Flame flashed. And thugs from both bandit cars were going down, riddled
bodies hurling, bloody, to the street.</p>

<p>It was over by the time the Phantom limped out of his wreck. Grim-jawed cops
were sheathing their guns. Others were trying to gather the bundles of
currency, the bags, which were strewn amid the dead and in the two sedans. And
other policemen began pulling out what was left of the men of the armored truck
crew. Two had apparently died from the explosion; a third had been riddled by
the gangsters. The fourth and fifth were badly maimed and unconscious.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>"Well, we got a good part of the mob, anyway&mdash;even if Monk Gorman and two
other of his men escaped!"</p>

<p>Five minutes later, in the ornate office of the bank, Inspector Gregg, who
had also answered the radio call, spoke these words as he mopped his placid but
heavy face with a handkerchief. "And from the looks of it, Phantom, you enabled
us to save a large portion of the swag! How much did you say, Mister?"</p>

<p>This to the shaken, grey-haired president of the bank who was stacking piles
of currency and bonds, some of them stained with blood, on his desk.</p>

<p>"Over two million dollars here." He announced the staggering sum, then shook
his head. "The audacity of those thieves! It's lucky the money was saved.
Certainly the bonding company would think there was something queer about the
truck being robbed at our very doors! They'd say we didn't give it proper
protection&mdash;or that there was some sort of inside work."</p>

<p>The Phantom having identified himself in his present disguise to the chief
of detectives, glanced across the office. In a chair, attended by two
policemen, sat Paul Corbin. The man's face was cut, and he seemed dazed, but he
had refused ambulance attention.</p>

<p>"You say the original sum was almost three million," the Phantom then spoke
to the bank president. "Isn't it unusual to send out such a sum? And on the
face of it, don't you think you should tell us who authorized it, and where it
was to go?"</p>

<p>The bank president hesitated. Then he made a gesture as if laying cards on
the table. "The securities and money belonged to the Star Corporation," he
announced. "They were being shipped to one of its authorized officers over in
Brooklyn."</p>

<p>Van's eyes narrowed. The Star Corporation! The corporation which owned the
building of the Gargoyle Club! He turned to the dazed Corbin.</p>

<p>"Well, Corbin, do you feel ready yet to offer an explanation?" he asked
crisply.</p>

<p>"Explanation?" Corbin echoed. "What for? What have I done?"</p>

<p>"Why did you rush down here, and wave that armored truck to stop?"</p>

<p>The inspector, to whom this was news, turned with an exclamation. "What's
that? He stopped the truck?"</p>

<p>Corbin was on his feet then, shakily.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I tried to stop this fool move! And I'll tell you why!" he cried, a
wild note in his voice. "Some of that money, a good part of it, belongs to
<i>me!</i> And I didn't want it taken out of the vaults here! The others
wouldn't listen to me. I told them it was dangerous. I told them that Gifford
was making a stupid, blundering move&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gifford?" the inspector echoed, while Van showed no surprise, remembering
that John Gifford, amusement park owner, was president of the Star
Corporation.</p>

<p>"Yes, Gifford! He sent the order. He was going to store our securities in
his new big vault at Coney Island. The others refused to interfere! They said
Gifford had the best business brain&mdash;if he made a move like this he must know
it was the only move!"</p>

<p>Van turned with tacit inquiry to the bank president. Slowly that official
nodded. "Yes, the order was authorized by John Gifford," he said.</p>

<p>The inspector's brow screwed into deep lines. "That's funny. Gifford
ordering the movement of a lot of dough when he knows this Al Millett is on the
loose with his gang, plundering and robbing all the men involved!"</p>

<p>The Phantom nodded. "I think," he suggested, "that it might pay to have an
interview with Mr. Gifford about now."</p>

<h3>Chapter XIII THE FANG CLAIMS ANOTHER VICTIM</h3>

<p>Driving rapidly, the Phantom sat beside the inspector in the latter's
shield-fronted limousine a few minutes later as they headed into Brooklyn, and
onto the highway to Coney Island to interview Gifford.</p>

<p>They had allowed Paul Corbin, still shaken and dazed, to go home from the
bank, intending to grill him plenty a bit later.</p>

<p>With screaming siren giving it a clear road, the inspector's car made the
trip to Coney Island in record time. Nevertheless it was well past noon when
the maze of Ferris wheels, scenic railway tracks, carousels, and other
amusement machines in which millions found thrills and pleasure loomed before
the inspector's car, then engulfed it on Surf Avenue.</p>

<p>Gifford's Park was doing only a modest business now, at the tail end of the
season. Most of the attractions were closed, although others were just opening
up. Uniformed attendants guided the inspector's car to a small, but massive
concrete building&mdash;Gifford's new offices and vault.</p>

<p>Getting out of the limousine, the Phantom and the inspector strode in. A man
was pacing the office floor&mdash;agitated, worried looking. It was not Gifford! It
was Carl Fenwick.</p>

<p>The clerical looking producer looked up with startled eyes which widened
quickly at sight of Van Loan's innocuous face.</p>

<p>"Police?" he breathed. "Here?"</p>

<p>"Yes. What brought you out here, Mr. Fenwick?" Van asked casually.</p>

<p>"Gifford phoned for me to come!" Fenwick answered. "Said he had some news to
tell me. I'm waiting for him now."</p>

<p>"He isn't here?" the inspector demanded.</p>

<p>"He was here. Just said 'hello' to me, then bolted out in a hurry&mdash;said he
had to attend to something, and for me to wait."</p>

<p>The Phantom's eyes were suddenly tense. "When was that?"</p>

<p>"About three minutes ago, perhaps even less."</p>

<p>The inspector scowled. "That was just about the time we were coming into the
Park! Wonder if he got word we were here?"</p>

<p>The Phantom, who had already considered that possibility, hurried to the
door, out onto the Park grounds. The tension was still in his eyes; a strange
apprehension was tightening around his heart.</p>

<p>He crisped a question at a special Park policeman standing on the pavement.
The latter replied, "Yes, I saw Mr. Gifford. He went over that way&mdash;toward the
Leap-for-Life."</p>

<p>He pointed toward the maze of spiraling tracks of the big rocket railway
designed by the owner. It had evidently just started running. Two streamlined
cars, half-filled with patrons, were beginning the ascent on one side, being
dragged by the moving cable up the incline.</p>

<p>The Phantom quickened his fast stride, the somewhat confused inspector at
his heels. They hurried toward the gigantic, futuristic railway.</p>

<p>At that instant, above the faint clatter of the climbing cars, there sounded
a hoarse cry! A cry of terror&mdash;a feeble but blood-curdling sound drifting from
far above!</p>

<p>Galvanized by the sound, the Phantom catapulted forward, his eyes darting
upwards. Through the lattice-like, open trackwork, just in the middle of the arc of
the first long and steepest hill of the railway, he glimpsed a vague, dark
bulk!</p>

<p>The Phantom jerked his head back, crisped out with fierce haste, "Get them
to turn off the power! Hurry, before those cars reach the top of the hill!"</p>

<p>He did not wait to see his command carried out. Never before had he moved
with more lightning rapidity. He leaped for a ladder&mdash;one of the many ascending
the framework of the tracks. The Phantom scrambled up like a monkey.</p>

<p>In seconds he was nearing the top. Simultaneously, his ears told him the
cable had stopped moving. The power had been shut off. But then&mdash;His heart went
chill!</p>

<p>On top of the long steep incline, he heard a rumble, a clattering rumble
which grew rapidly louder. One of those cars had reached the hill crest before
the power had been turned off. It was going over that crest! Like a rocket, it
was coasting down the hill, hurtling earthward with its passengers!</p>

<p>The Phantom spurred his body up with a terrific lunge, climbed over the open
track-work. He glanced up the converging rails of the steep ascent, saw the car
coming down now, swaying and rocking with its roaring speed!</p>

<p>In the center of the tracks before him writhing weakly, huddled the
corpulent figure of John Gifford.</p>

<p>He was not bound, seeming merely to have been stunned, and thus unable to
move.</p>

<p>"Gifford!" Van yelled above the roaring, downcoming rocket car.
"Gifford!"</p>

<p>Gifford raised his head, stirring a little clumsily, but remaining on the
track. The Phantom got his footing on a tie, caught hold of a metal strut, and
leaned out over the track as he saw the car growing huge&mdash;coming on like a
juggernaut! A juggernaut that threatened to mangle and kill both Gifford and
him&mdash;and perhaps wreck and kill its own passengers as well!</p>

<p>He swooped down in that instant, got the man by the collar and heaved.
Despite his corpulent appearance, Gifford proved such a surprisingly light
burden, that Van nearly jerked him over the outside of the track-edge.</p>

<p>He recovered his balance and held Gifford against the framework just as the
massive car whizzed by like a rocket.</p>

<p>Then, hands of park workers who had come up the ladder reached out. They got
Gifford down and the Phantom lowered himself over the edge.</p>

<p>One of his hands was skinned where the rushing car had lightly touched
it.</p>

<p>Fenwick and the inspector were on hand below when the dazed Gifford was
brought down. He stood, shaken and pale, looking confusedly at the masked
Phantom.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you saved my life, sir," he gasped weakly. "I couldn't move!" Stark
terror was growing in his eyes. "I was called out by phone&mdash;told there was some
trouble under the scenic track. I went there&mdash;and never knew what hit me! The
next thing I knew I was on the track and the car was coming down."</p>

<p>The inspector, listening, dispatched policemen who had arrived at the scene
to search the grounds. "It's the Fang again or I miss my guess!" he cursed.
"Lord, will he never end this reign of terror?"</p>

<p>Fenwick, standing by white-faced, blurted out. "If only <i>you</i> would end
it! Gifford, why wouldn't you and the others&mdash;"</p>

<p>Gifford jerked up his head fiercely. "No! Drake was right. I wanted to see
you about that, Fenwick!" He seemed now to have made an almost remarkable
recovery; his voice was strong now&mdash;the dominant voice of a hard-fisted,
successful business man. "I took certain measures to protect our
interests."</p>

<p>"If you mean that you ordered three million dollars shipped to you in an
armored car," Van put in sharply, "those measures were not sufficient. We've
just come from the attempted hijacking of that fortune!"</p>

<p>"What?" Both Gifford and Fenwick stared with bulging, horrified eyes,
chorusing the exclamation in unison.</p>

<p>Then Fenwick almost screamed, "You ordered out that truck! Damn you,
Gifford, you had no right&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait!" Gifford put in. His voice shook now with a horror that seemed
greater than he had shown before. "I didn't give such an order!" he cried. "I
was considering it&mdash;but I didn't give it! That's what I wanted to talk about. I
was merely going to have the bank put an extra guard on the money&mdash;God!
<i>Someone forged my name to that order!</i> No wonder they tried to kill me!
To cover up&mdash;"</p>

<p>The inspector spoke grimly. "This Al Millett did go in for some forging," he
said slowly. "I wonder&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Phantom, too, was wondering. There was something strangely pat about
Gifford's alibi. At the same time, Van felt a sense as of anticlimax. As if,
despite the hectic rescue he had just made, his nerves had been braced for
something that hadn't happened, yet which he felt was still in the air.</p>

<p>He turned to Gifford, started to frame more questions. At that instant an
attendant came running from the concrete office building.</p>

<p>"Inspector! Call from your Headquarters! Urgent!"</p>

<p>The inspector's heavy frame charged across the ground. The Phantom, nerves
going tense again, followed.</p>

<p>A waiting hand-set phone was ready for the inspector. He scooped it up.
"Inspector Gregg talking. What?" An invisible spring seemed to straighten his
whole body. "Okay&mdash;okay&mdash;"</p>

<p>He slammed down the instrument, whirled to the Phantom, who knew even before
the inspector spoke that the climax he had missed had come after all.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the inspector's shaken voice rang out like a knell.</p>

<p>"Kenneth Meade has just been murdered!" he announced. "Let's go!"</p>

<p>Leaving Fenwick and Gifford at the amusement park, guarded by uniformed
police, the Phantom and Inspector Gregg sped back to Manhattan. The inspector's
car rolled up Seventh Avenue and came to a stop before a huge restaurant
facade&mdash;Milady's Salon.</p>

<p>Prowl-cars, cruisers, and riot squad trucks were already at the scene. The
police were herding back a crushing mob&mdash;roping them off. The restaurant was
empty of patrons&mdash;it functioned only at night.</p>

<p>The inspector and the Phantom strode through gaps in the saluting bluecoats,
entered the premises. They found men with cameras already at work, the Homicide
Squad busy at the scene.</p>

<p>Threading their way through tables piled with napkins but unset, they came
to a spot at one end of the floor where the knot of detectives was thickest,
and where the stocky Medical Examiner was at work.</p>

<p>Kenneth Meade, restaurateur, was sprawled with arms and legs rigidly
outstretched. He lay on his back, but his body had a half-doubled aspect. His
face was contorted in a grimace of agony, the lips horribly bluish, the
sightless eyes protruding from their sockets as if they must pop out.</p>

<p>The clothes of the dead man had been ripped from his upper torso, exposing
his neck and chest nakedly. In the naked flesh, in the lower part of the neck,
just under his Adam's apple, was a hideous gash&mdash;a deep cut from which blood
still slowly oozed.</p>

<p>"What is it, Doc?" the inspector demanded hoarsely. "Was he stabbed in the
neck?"</p>

<p>The doctor rose slowly. If ever a man looked shaken, thrown entirely out of
his professional equilibrium, this stocky city medical examiner did. "Yes, he
was stabbed, but that didn't kill him," he said in a small, dazed voice.
"The gash you see missed the trachea and went directly into the <i>esophagus</i>&mdash;the canal which takes food to the stomach. A man will live with such a
wound."</p>

<p>"Then what&mdash;?" the inspector demanded, bewildered. The Phantom said nothing
as he noted the rigid aspect of the corpse.</p>

<p>"Poison!" the doctor pronounced then, his voice shaking. "Bichloride of
mercury, from the symptoms. Poison which was fed to Meade through that gash in
his esophagus&mdash;which carried it to his stomach!" He shook his head. "This is a
death unparalleled in all my career as a doctor. Evidently the criminal decided
he wanted to poison Meade&mdash;but why he put it through a gash in the esophagus
instead of through the mouth, I can't understand."</p>

<p>Sickened, the inspector turned away from the gruesome sight. Turned away
only to stare with fresh horror at the tiny but familiar object a homicide
officer now held out to him on a handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Found this next to the body, inspector," he said.</p>

<p>The inspector's eyes blazed. "I thought so! The Fang again! The same
saber-tooth guy! At least he couldn't have been at Coney Island this afternoon
to put Gifford on the track! He's making a laughing stock of us! With our whole
department after him, he still goes right on, killing, plundering&mdash;He's getting
in my hair."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be too sure of that, inspector," observed Van Loan thoughtfully.
"Meade could have been wounded, poisoned, and left unconscious to die slowly
while the Fang went out to do other devilment. Just because Meade has just died
doesn't mean the crime was just committed. It could have happened any time
since I left him in Drake's office this morning."</p>

<p>A sudden commotion interrupted the conversation. Into the restaurant came a
group of plainclothes men, dragging a struggling figure in their midst.</p>

<p>Van's eyes went sharp. The figure was the bearded, saturnine Count Karnov,
the mysterious foreigner who had been at the Palladium the other night!</p>

<p>"We found this bird sneakin' around outside!" one of the detectives said.
"And I think we found something on him that might answer a lot of
questions!"</p>

<p>Karnov scowled, still struggling silently. The detective handed a paper to
the inspector. "This was in his pocket, sir! Take a look. And get ready for a
shock!"</p>

<p>The Phantom was at the inspector's shoulder as the latter lifted the paper.
It was torn. There was a hasty scrawl in ink across it.</p>

<p>Even the Phantom gasped as he read it.</p>

<p><i>&mdash;so I've decided to send you a last warning.<br>&mdash;Al.</i></p>

<p>"Did you write this?" the inspector's voice was sharp as a knife as he faced
the Count belligerently.</p>

<p>Karnov's dark eyes glowered.</p>

<p>"I refuse to answer any questions," he said in his flawless English.</p>

<p>"Oh, you do?" the inspector's hulk looked ominously menacing. "Well, do you
deny that you're Al Millett?"</p>

<p>At the mention of that name, Karnov gave a perceptible start. He smiled
then&mdash;a nasty, venomous smile. "You'll have a difficult time proving that,
inspector." But there was desperation in his eyes.</p>

<p>The Phantom, with his keen knowledge of psychology, could see that the man
wanted to get away quickly. Those glowering eyes were looking about furtively,
like those of a trapped animal who would take the first possible loophole of
escape.</p>

<p>"I'd like to really see the face you've got under that beard!" the inspector
grated now. "Wait until we get you down to Headquarters! I think we'll have the
end of these crimes!"</p>

<p>Karnov wet his lips, but was still silent. Van's mind was racing now. He
moved across the floor. In the center of the big restaurant stood an immense
porcelain vase, its top, about three feet above the floor, gaped dark and
empty.</p>

<p>Van looked at the vase. It signified more than a vase to him. It was here
for a purpose, a common thing in prominent European restaurants.</p>

<p>The Phantom picked up a napkin idly from a table. "I think I'd like to ask
Count Karnov a few questions," he smiled. "Bring him here, please."</p>

<p>The detectives pushed the prisoner, whose eyes now were fixed darkly on the
Phantom, across the floor. They stood back, a confident circle surrounding the
man.</p>

<p>Van, standing at the vase, spoke carefully. "You're in a pretty tough spot,
Karnov, as we say in police parlance." He dropped the napkin idly into the
vase. It disappeared completely in the gaping interior. "The evidence is
stacked pretty strongly against you. The police have ways of making men talk,
when they get them down to Headquarters. So&mdash;"</p>

<p>A sudden, animal-like cry of desperation burst from Count Karnov's lips. He
dived head first into the huge vase. So swiftly did he move that his guards
were taken unawares. The inspector and others rushed to the vase while Van Loan
stood quietly by.</p>

<p>"Come out of there, Karnov," rapped Gregg. "You fool, what good will that
move do you?"</p>

<p>He broke off, face going bewildered, eyes filling with uncanny incredulity
as he reached into the depths of the vase. "Why, he's gone! He's not in there
at all! There's no bottom to this damned thing!"</p>

<p>The Phantom smiled and spoke. "I wanted him to think he was escaping,
inspector. You carry on here. I'll find him all right." He whirled and hurried
out of the premises. Out on the street Van slipped past the police-lined front
of the restaurant, around the corner on which it stood, to the side of it. He
was not surprised to glimpse a furtive figure crawling from a cellar exit of
the building. The disheveled but desperate figure of Count Karnov!</p>

<p>No police were watching this side of the restaurant at the moment. When
Karnov's eyes darted around furtively, the Phantom's lithe shape quickly
flattened against the building. Count Karnov turned, dashed the opposite way up
the block, running on legs obviously guided by sheer desperation.</p>

<p>The Phantom, slipping out, followed him.</p>

<p>On Sixth Avenue, Karnov hailed a taxi, leaped into it, slamming the door.
The cab turned around, sped uptown. The Phantom hailed another taxi. He
displayed a bill to the driver.</p>

<p>"Follow that cab!" he commanded. "But keep well behind it."</p>

<h3>Chapter XIV TRAPPED IN THE PENTHOUSE</h3>

<p>Affably the cabby nodded. Like most cabbies, he knew that kind of work. The
trail did not prove difficult to follow, though it was a devious one.</p>

<p>It led uptown, through the oasis-like green of Central Park, out through
Seventy-Second, thence over to West End Avenue.</p>

<p>The afternoon was already lengthening into dusk when Karnov's taxi came to a
stop, in the upper eighties. The Phantom's cab stopped at a discreet distance
behind. Van leaned forward. He saw the figure of Count Karnov alight to the
curb, pay off his driver, then stride beneath the canopy of a towering
apartment building.</p>

<p>Swiftly, Van paid off his own cabby and moved to the canopy of the
apartment. Karnov's figure had already disappeared into the building.</p>

<p>The Phantom pushed in through the glass-paned doors. His alert eyes flashed
around a large, ornate foyer. Three elevators stood with gates open, but a
smaller bronze door was closed. From behind it the Phantom's keen ears heard
the sound of mechanical motion. A private elevator in such a building
invariably led to a penthouse.</p>

<p>That was where the desperate Count Karnov was apparently going.</p>

<p>The Phantom paused a moment in a manner which befitted his vacuous
expression before he walked into one of the regular elevators&mdash;first glancing
up at the last number on the indicator.</p>

<p>"Twenty-eight," he said to the operator, as the gates slid smoothly shut and
the car began its swift ascent.</p>

<p>The elevator took him to the top floor of the apartment. He sauntered out,
in a leisurely manner. But as soon as the gates had closed behind him, his
leisure dropped away like a cloak. Moving swiftly, he found the fire-stairs,
and ascended to the penthouse floor. As he climbed, he slipped on his domino
mask.</p>

<p>Emerging on a landing, a skylight overhead showing the gathering twilight,
he saw the closed bronzed door of the private elevator, the door opposite to
the only apartment up here.</p>

<p>He slipped to it on soundless feet. He put his face close to it, listened.
He heard a vague sound within. Then a voice. He could only catch a few words,
but those were enough to sharpen the gleam in his eyes.</p>

<p>"&mdash;a transatlantic call&mdash;to London, England&mdash;reverse the
charges&mdash;hurry&mdash;"</p>

<p>Karnov's voice!</p>

<p>A tight, grim smile flecked Van's lips. The pieces of this mighty, bloody
puzzle were clicking into place; he knew that he was close now to the end of
the gruesome trail. But many threads were still loose, many questions still to
answer.</p>

<p>The penthouse lock was difficult, especially difficult to open without
sound. His wire twisted, curved, wriggled in and out, as his deft hand guided
it.</p>

<p>At last it clicked. The Phantom turned the handle slowly. Cautiously, he
pushed the door open. Its well-oiled hinges made no sound. Wraith-like, he
slipped into the apartment. A wide stucco-walled hall, deep in unlit twilight
gloom, engulfed his stealthy figure. His keen eyes flashed down the hall. Two
doors, one on either side of the wall opposite the entrance door. Which?</p>

<p>A sharp ring of a telephone answered his question in the next second. He
heard a quick, leaping step in the phone room. Karnov's voice was speaking.</p>

<p>"Hello? Yes&mdash;my party? Yes, I'm holding on&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Phantom moved to the door, peered in, cautiously. The room was in gloom,
no lights having been lit. Twilight showed outside a single open window that
evidently was flush, on this side, with the building&mdash;a sheer drop into space.
The room itself, a living room, looked strangely feminine in its appearance.
Soft, silky covered furniture. And a faint perfumed scent.</p>

<p>At a taboret to one side, Count Karnov crouched over a white-enameled
telephone. His voice came again in its flawless English.</p>

<p>"Hello&mdash;This is Karnov!" Anger threaded that voice now. "Listen to me! I
have reached the end of my rope! I intend to leave this country at once." He
laughed harshly. "Oh, I got enough money. I have done as much of my work as I
could&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Phantom, his ears taking in every word, had slipped into the room behind
Count Karnov.</p>

<p>Like a panther, the Phantom leaped! His right hand closed on Karnov's hand
holding the telephone. His left hand stifled the amazed out-cry on the Count's
lips.</p>

<p>He twisted the phone out of Karnov's fingers, managed to place the
instrument down&mdash;still out of its cradle.</p>

<p>His right hand, now free, doubled into a balled fist. It did not move far;
but it moved with timed precision and judgment. The blow landed on the Count's
bristle-bearded jaw. The foreigner staggered backwards, his mouth open now and
unhampered, but only an expelling sigh coming from it. He slumped in the
shadowy gloom of the far wall.</p>

<p>The Phantom, deciding he was out for the time being, did not delay another
instant. He grabbed up the phone. Immediately an angry voice came to his
ears.</p>

<p>"Are you there, Karnov? Confound you! Why don't you answer?"</p>

<p>Van felt a thrill in that hectic moment. He was listening to a voice that
was coming from three thousand miles&mdash;across the Atlantic Ocean&mdash;from
England.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am here," Van said into the mouthpiece, speaking in the flawless
voice of Count Karnov. "Listen to me. You have read, doubtless, the newspapers.
The detective called the Phantom is working upon this case. He is ready,
almost, to bring it to a close!" Though he spoke in Karnov's voice, his words
rang with grim sincerity now, for they were true words. "He needs but one more
proof! You must act swiftly if you wish to save yourself! I have already told
you what I am going to do! But you must make a sacrifice!"</p>

<p>"Karnov!" the English-accented voice rose harshly. "What do you mean? What
do you dare to&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"You must come to America, to New York, at once!" Van went on. "Take now the
fastest boat! One perhaps with a mail-service plane&mdash;charter it if you can!
That will bring you in the more swiftly!"</p>

<p>"Karnov, are you mad? Are you trying to make me put my head into a noose?
Here I am, safe with a perfect alibi&mdash;" As if realizing he had said too much
over the public wire, the speaker broke off with a gasp. "You are mad!" he
finished weakly.</p>

<p>"I warn you for your own good. It is a matter of life and death," Van said,
with difficulty keeping the voice of Karnov. "The Phantom will get to you,
regardless&mdash;" He went on speaking, rapidly, persuasively.</p>

<p>He heard a movement behind him then. He jerked back his head quickly,
expecting to see Karnov getting to his feet. His eyes went wide then, as he
stifled a surprised exclamation. Karnov was not in the twilight room at all! He
had vanished! And instead&mdash;</p>

<p>"Put down that telephone!" came a steady, low feminine voice.</p>

<p>In the doorway of the room stood the slender, white-faced figure of the
missing Queen Stella! A small but deadly automatic gleamed dully in her
hand.</p>

<p>Her eyes gleaming with a determined light, the girl aerialist advanced
towards the telephone as she spoke.</p>

<p>The Phantom spoke three hurried words more into the mouthpiece in that split
second. "Get here quick!" Then he banged the phone down in its cradle, and
leaped upright, whirling toward the girl. He saw her finger tighten on the
trigger&mdash;and his body sprang as if from a catapult.</p>

<p>His long right arm snaked out, catching the gun as flame spat from it,
twisting it so the bullet was deflected to one side. Simultaneously he saw the
girl's eyes widen with horror and astonishment, realized she was staring in the
gloom at his domino mask.</p>

<p>A cry of relief came to her lips, but even as she opened her mouth to speak,
there was a rush of heavy feet from the hall. Like a flood, slouch-hatted
figures burst into the room with leveled guns!</p>

<p>The remainder of the Fang's mob! Led by the slicker-clad Monk Gorman!</p>

<p>The girl screamed. Van grabbed her by the arm, half flung her across the
room, where she dropped under the window. He still had the automatic he had
twisted out of her hand. He pivoted, swinging it upon the charging mob of
gunmen and jerking the trigger.</p>

<p>Crack! A thug dropped in his tracks&mdash;a pimply-faced man whose life blood
spurted from his chest as he fell. Monk Gorman, moving rapidly despite his
size, reached the light switch.</p>

<p>The room became dazzling with the sudden flood of illumination. Before the
blinking Van could fire again, the thugs were upon him. There were enough of
them to make resistance futile. He was pummeled, cuffed, kicked, by
hate-glaring felons of the underworld!</p>

<p>Stunned, he was pushed back across the floor. As he fought to keep his
balance, he heard a faint moan beside him. Queen Stella standing there, all
blood drained from her face.</p>

<p>Both of them, unarmed, were facing a line of thugs who stood between them
and the door. Guns were leveling at the two captives. Monk, in their center,
holding the deadliest weapon of all, a blue-steel tommy gun, at which he had
already proved himself adept!</p>

<p>"Well, well!" he chortled above its barrel. "This time we really got you
where we want you, Phantom! Got you lined up, an' you, too, Sister!" His evil
eyes swiveled to the girl.</p>

<p>Outside in the hall, beyond the closed door of this room, sounded a step.
Another person had entered the apartment, was walking down that hall!</p>

<p>The steps came forward decisively, entered the room next to the living room
where all were listening breathlessly.</p>

<p>The connecting door opened just a few inches. Blackness only showed from
within. But once more, as he had felt in that ghastly studio at Astoria, Van
was aware in every nerve of a blighting evil Presence!</p>

<p>The menace he knew as the Fang had followed to this penthouse apartment,
trapping him there. The next instant a familiar, rasping voice sounded from
that chinked door.</p>

<p>"So, Mr. Phantom, you have crossed my trail again!" A diabolical chortle
rose from the darkness beyond the ajar door. "We have caught two birds, as it
were! One who is just a foolish young woman. The other devilishly clever&mdash;and
of many lives, it seems. I suppose, if I were to have Monk remove your silly
domino, I would see the features of Al Millett this time. Bah! Your childish
disguises weary me. But your escapes annoy me. This time I'll watch you die
with my own eyes!"</p>

<p>Van was silent, eyes fixed on the door. The girl stood just behind him at
the window, pale, yet with a certain defiance on her delicate, oval face. From
her lips came a low whisper which barely reached the Phantom's ears.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," she murmured. "I didn't know it was you. I sent Karnov for the
police while you were talking over the phone. I thought you were the Fang. And
all I've done was to help trap you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Van broke in quickly. "I know, Miss Millett," he said simply, sympathy and
understanding in his tone.</p>

<p>"What are you saying, Phantom?" came the evil voice from the other room
where the terrible genius behind this whole bloody reign of crime stood in
darkness. "You speak? You had better finish swiftly. The boys are waiting."</p>

<p>Which was unpleasantly true. Monk's blue-steel tommy gun was raised, ready.
The other thugs formed a line of dark, hungry automatic muzzles. The Phantom
remained stoically silent. He was thinking furiously.</p>

<p>"Come, come," mocked the arch criminal. "Do you not wish to talk before you
die? It is a boon I grant you&mdash;both of you. You aren't gagged. You seem to know
so much, to be so astute. Talk your way out of this impasse, Mr. Phantom."</p>

<p>"You fiend!" exclaimed the girl vehemently. "You inhuman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Steady," counseled the Phantom, flashing a glance at her.</p>

<p>She fell silent. And Van Loan's eyes continued to rove swiftly about the
room. If it were not for the girl, he might have found some means of escape.
But at the first move, even if he managed to win clear, those guns would blast,
and the girl would die. And it was very essential now that this girl did not
die. If only he could stall until the police came!</p>

<p>The window! A sheer drop, with nothing but flimsy ledges to hold to. It
would take an acrobat&mdash;Into his mind flashed the swinging trapeze at the
Palladium Club. He reached in that moment the most desperate decision of his
career.</p>

<p>He glanced quickly at the girl and then let his gaze dart toward the open
window behind her.</p>

<p>"Dare you?" he whispered tersely out of the corner of his mouth.</p>

<p>She understood instantly. Her eyes widened, sparkled.</p>

<p>"Yes," she formed with her lips.</p>

<p>"So you won't talk, eh?" grated the voice from the other room, mockingly
imitating a third-grade detective. "Well, too bad you won't live to file this
case&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait!" said Van Loan sharply. "I'll talk."</p>

<p>"I'm listening," agreed the unseen man amiably. "What have you to say?"</p>

<p>"This!" shot out the Phantom, without warning hurling himself down and
sideways straight at the waiting line of gangsters.</p>

<p>Before they could react, before they could train their weapons upon him, he
was tangled against the legs of three of them. With a mighty sweep, he gathered
legs and all within reach to himself, and brought the amazed thugs to the floor
in a mad scramble with him.</p>

<p>"Sit down on him!" barked the vindictive voice of the hidden leader. "Fools!
The girl! Grab her!"</p>

<p>But it was too late. Like a sleek jungle cat, Queen Stella had swung herself
up into the window at the Phantom's first move, and out into the nothingness of
space. Guns roared futilely, hot lead smacking into the window frame,
shattering the upper sash, and drumming out into the open air.</p>

<p>Monk Gorman and two of his muscle men yanked the Phantom savagely to his
feet, while others darted over to the window and gawked out into the night,
seeing nothing but the myriad winking lights of New York skyscrapers.</p>

<p>"Gawd! She's gone, Chief!" gasped one. "She did a Brodie!"</p>

<p>"Her body'll attract attention, Boss!" shouted Gorman. "We better finish
this guy an' lam."</p>

<p>"Wait!" snarled the leader. "This building is recessed. She didn't fall to
the street. We'll have time. I want you to search this place."</p>

<p>"Anyway, this guy ain't gonna die like that," grunted Monk Gorman viciously,
and he crashed the muzzle of his tommy gun against the head of the Phantom.</p>

<p>The world exploded for Van Loan, and he went out like a light. Went out,
crumpling to the floor, just as the entrance door of the apartment crashed back
against the wall, and the charging rush of heavy feet surged like a wave into
the penthouse.</p>

<p>"Th' cops!" howled a panic-stricken thug. "Scram, everybody!"</p>

<p>"You can't scram," snarled the unseen leader. "Fight it out, you scum!
You're trapped and done for if you don't!"</p>

<p>Pandemonium reigned. Through the hallway door came the charge of bluecoats.
Guns barked their snarls of defiance. Smoke filled the room with the reek of
cordite. Men bowled over like ten-pins, screaming in agony. Gangsters and
policemen in one mad carnage of hell!</p>

<p>The end was inevitable. Monk Gorman, his machine gun chattering like an
enraged ape, took a slug over the heart just as his stream of leaden hail cut
an officer almost in two. His gun went silent as he grunted once and dropped to
the floor, his career of crime over forever. The remnants of four mobs had met
their Waterloo.</p>

<p>The police were busily mopping up when Queen Stella and Count Karnov pushed
their way in. The girl uttered a cry of alarm at sight of the Phantom on the
floor, and rushed to his side. He was already stirring, conscious again as she
raised his head.</p>

<p>A plainclothes detective rushed in from the recently darkened room and
reported to Inspector Gregg who was in charge of this raid, having been found
at Milady's Salon by the frenzied Karnov.</p>

<p>"Inspector," he babbled, "there was a murdered man in that bedroom as I went
through a minute ago&mdash;lying on the floor in the dark with his neck broken. I
saw it! Head twisted nastily to one side, tongue hanging out. I went on to the
kitchen with the harness bulls to make sure everything was mopped up, and then
I came back to examine the corpse&mdash;and it was gone!"</p>

<p>"You're nuts, O'Brien," snapped Inspector Gregg curtly. "If&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Phantom pushed away Queen Stella's fluttering hands and staggered erect.
He reeled his dizzy way into the room in question. It was empty!</p>

<p>He came back to the living room doorway, catching on to the casing for
support. A bitter smile twisted his mouth beneath his awry mask.</p>

<p>"On the contrary, inspector," he said wearily, "O'Brien is not nuts."</p>

<p>"Then, maybe I am," growled Gregg acidly. "I found out, too late, about that
tricky vase at the restaurant. It's rigged up like lots of those European
places&mdash;a blind for a clothes chute to the cellar for soiled napkins and
tablecloths."</p>

<p>Had he not been so intensely disappointed, Van Loan could have laughed.</p>

<p>"I know," he articulated wearily. "But this dead man with the broken neck
was a better trick. That was no dead man. <i>He was the master criminal!</i>
And we've let him get away!"</p>

<h3>Chapter XV THE PHANTOM SPEAKS</h3>

<p>Five days later the big room on the third floor of Police Headquarters on
Centre Street held a queer group of people. Besides the commissioner, Inspector
Gregg, and half a dozen uniformed officers, there were numerous visitors.</p>

<p>Frank Havens, the publisher, was there at the desk with a mass of papers
before him. Seated in a semi-circle facing the desk were four well-known
figures of the amusement world&mdash;Paul Corbin, Gordon Drake, John Gifford, and
Carl Fenwick.</p>

<p>"I don't understand," said Paul Corbin nervously, "why we are all gathered
here like this. We've been waiting half an hour. And for what?" He seemed more
womanish than ever in his pettish annoyance.</p>

<p>Gordon Drake clasped his gloved hands stiffly, a tolerant smile about his
handsome lips. "Contain yourself, my dear Corbin," he advised.</p>

<p>"Nobody's been killed during the past five days, anyhow. That's
something."</p>

<p>John Gifford merely grunted. His big frame seemed more huddled than usual,
his craggy, gnarled features more grotesque than ever.</p>

<p>Fenwick said nothing. He merely tapped on the arms of his chair, tugged at
his high collar, tweaked at his ear, and went back to his drumming.</p>

<p>Inspector Gregg shuffled through some papers at his own desk, scowled at his
assorted company, and squinted at the calm and composed publisher of the
<i>Clarion.</i></p>

<p>"I'm getting a bit impatient, myself," he said gruffly. "The Phantom asked
for this meeting, promising to break this Fang case for us today. And he isn't
even here. What's the answer, Mr. Havens?"</p>

<p>The grey-haired publisher smiled as he looked up from the papers he was
carefully arranging.</p>

<p>"I can't explain, inspector," he admitted frankly. "All I can tell you is
that the Phantom has promised to meet us here and surprise us. And he never
breaks a promise. As for these papers, he'll have to tell us exactly what they
mean."</p>

<p>An orderly came in and spoke to the police commissioner. The latter cleared
his throat and glanced around the group. Then "Send him in," he said.</p>

<p>All eyes turned to the door as the orderly went out. In an instant another
figure appeared on the threshold. And four men gasped in amazement. A young man
with buck teeth, thick lips, and attired in the quaint garb of the first decade
of the twentieth century looked over the company, smiled, and came forward.</p>

<p>"Hello, Gordon, Carl, Paul, John," he greeted. "You remember me?"</p>

<p>Paul Corbin half-rose out of his chair with a stifled scream.</p>

<p>"Al Millett!" he choked, eyes bulging in terror.</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool!" growled John Gifford. "Al Millett looks as old as we do
today."</p>

<p>"True," smiled Gordon Drake. "This is the ghost of Al Millett of yesterday.
Hello, Al."</p>

<p>"This is crazy!" snorted Fenwick, tugging at his collar.</p>

<p>Inspector Gregg was on his feet, hesitating in pardonable uncertainty.</p>

<p>"You are all correct and all wrong, gentlemen," smiled the newcomer,
approaching the desk and taking up a position beside the publisher and the pile
of papers. "I am neither Al Millett, nor the bloody criminal called the Fang.
This was just a screwy idea of my own. A great many people know me as&mdash;the
Phantom. I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, but I had to meet a boat&mdash;a
different one from the <i>Charlemagne.</i> Allow me to present the real Albert
Millett!"</p>

<p>At his words, almost before the various gasps of surprise died away, another
man crossed the threshold, a middle-aged man on whose arm came the aerialist
known as Queen Stella.</p>

<p>The newcomer, a pleasant-faced man with greying hair and thick lips about
which there were deep lines, came forward hesitantly and bowed stiffly in
English fashion.</p>

<p>For a full moment there was a stunned silence. Then Inspector Gregg started
forward with a growl.</p>

<p>"Wait, please!" crisped the Phantom. "Albert Millett, where have you been
for the past twenty years?"</p>

<p>"I have been in the wine business in London," answered Millett. "I was a
fool as a young man out West, and, after my wife died, I went away with my
daughter to start life anew. This is my daughter, Estella Millett. She has been
in America for more than a year. She inherited her mother's ability as an
aerialist, and that has become her chosen calling."</p>

<p>"When, Mr. Millett, did you arrive in America?" inquired the Phantom, making
no effort to conceal the fact that this was a rehearsed inquiry.</p>

<p>"I set foot on my native land for the first time in twenty years just an
hour ago when the <i>Queen Mary</i> docked," replied Millett in a firm
voice.</p>

<p>"You can establish this fact?" went on the Phantom coolly.</p>

<p>"Without question. I left England but four days ago."</p>

<p>"Then you couldn't possibly have landed from the <i>Charlemagne</i> a week
ago in New York?"</p>

<p>"I could not, sir."</p>

<p>"Then you could not be this fiendish murderer who has terrorized New York
for the past week under the name of the Fang?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly not!" said Millett emphatically.</p>

<p>"Then this," cut in Inspector Gregg succinctly, "shoots our case all to
hell, and we're back where we started from. I thought you were going to break
it, Phantom."</p>

<p>"I'll have to go into it methodically," answered the Phantom. "I'll try to
be brief, inspector. By the way, Count Karnov&mdash;as you have already
ascertained&mdash;is Mr. Millett's representative in the United States. He is
exactly what he purports to be, and no more. As for breaking the Fang case&mdash;let
me explain that Mr. Havens and I have had to dig back into a lot of ancient
history. For one thing, the Academy of Medicine had to canvass a great part of
the United States for us in search of certain knowledge. We have dug up a
number of interesting family skeletons.</p>

<p>"First, I might touch on the once famous circus of Crowley and Buckill
wherewith Al Millett got his bad exploitation as a fanged monster. There are
handbills and circus posters here that will interest you, Inspector Gregg. But
the private life of Al Millett has little bearing on this case. He was just a
red herring dragged across this trail. The real criminal is not Millett, nor
his daughter, nor Karnov, nor anybody imported into this country. He is one of
the very men, inspector, who came to you with that wild tale about the
Fang."</p>

<p>The inspector gasped. "You mean that yarn was made out of whole cloth? One
of them was the maniac? Andrews! By God, it is Andrews! The missing man!"</p>

<p>"Not so fast, inspector," the Phantom calmed him. "I'll tell you. But
first&mdash;" He turned toward the tense and alert four tycoons of the entertainment
world. "&mdash;before I can clear up the matter, I must ask your permission,
gentlemen, to reveal jealously guarded secrets of your intimate life. It pains
me to embarrass you, but the truth will have to come out. You know what I refer
to&mdash;the Gargoyle Club."</p>

<p>All four men winced. Paul Corbin, unaccountably, began to sob. Gifford
seemed to shrink in his chair, growing more crag-like than ever. Fenwick turned
deadly pale. Gordon Drake was the first to recover. He laughed bitterly and
stood erect, stretching his manly figure to its full, symmetric height.</p>

<p>"After all," he said wearily, "why not? Nature made us what we are. It's
nothing to be personally ashamed of."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the Phantom softly. "I respect you, Mr. Drake. These
brutal and revolting murders, each different, were not the haphazard affairs
that you may think, Inspector Gregg&mdash;Commissioner. They were perfectly logical
when one knows the reason. Had they continued, they would have woven the same
grotesque pattern of startling individuality. For instance, Drake&mdash;had he been
killed&mdash;would have been found with his arms amputated at the shoulders. Paul
Corbin's body would have been split in half.</p>

<p>"Gifford would have been horribly mangled&mdash;as he so nearly was by his own
Leap-for-Life railway. And Carl Fenwick&mdash;<i>would have been found with a broken
neck!"</i></p>

<p>At these last emphatic words, Fenwick leaped to his feet with a strangled
cry. In a flash Van Loan had him covered with a pistol, his face set in hard,
uncompromising lines which almost revealed the clean-cut contour of the face of
Richard Van Loan.</p>

<p>"Hold it, Fenwick!" he said, cold steel in his voice. "Take him, Inspector
Gregg! He is your man!"</p>

<p>The inspector, though dumbfounded, was a good policeman. Without question he
leaped forward and snapped a pair of manacles about the theatrical producer's
wrists. Two uniformed officers converged on the accused man and gripped his
arms. Fenwick wilted.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but just what does this all mean?" demanded the confused
commissioner.</p>

<p>"Just this, sir," answered the Phantom. "Nine men, today wealthy and famous,
were once freaks in the show of Crowley and Buckill. In those days when hokum
was king, these genuine freaks were featured attractions. They laid the
foundations of their own fortunes while they made Crowley and Buckill rich.</p>

<p>"The Marcy brothers were Siamese twins, joined together by a cartilage and a
spinal structure. An operation might have severed them, but both were afraid to
chance it. When they retired from circus life they became recluses, exhibiting
themselves only behind a double desk or in their limousine. They were always
together, of course, hampered by their natal tie, but remarkable business men
for all of that."</p>

<p>Van Loan drew a breath and continued.</p>

<p>"Clyde Dickson was a different sort of oddity. He was not born with his
affliction. As a young man on a construction job a flying crowbar was driven
into his skull. By some queer accident it didn't kill him. So it was sawed off
and left in his head. There is another case of this nature on record at the
Harvard Medical School. They have the skull of a man whose name was Gage. He
was injured like Dickson, and lived to die normally at an old age.</p>

<p>"I have the record here of Dickson's case, the report of the son of the
doctor who waited on him. That was why Dickson wore a mop of long hair over the
protuberance from his skull.</p>

<p>"Meade, the fourth man to die, was another extraordinary case. At some time
in his early life he developed a stricture of his esophagus which prevented him
from taking food. He was operated on, an artificial opening was made at the
front of his throat, and he lived. He exhibited this second mouth as a freak in
the circus.</p>

<p>"Andrews has not run away. He is dead. His case is one where his torso
developed normally, but his legs from the hips down atrophied as a child. I saw
those severed legs in that abandoned studio out in Astoria. He wore special
braces and used a cane, if you will remember.</p>

<p>"You see, each murder had to be different in order to obliterate the fact
that the victims were abnormal or subnormal. Gifford would have been mutilated
because he is a hunch-back. I found that out when I saved him from his own
rocket car. He was phenomenally light; his padded clothes partially hiding his
deformity and giving him a portly appearance.</p>

<p>"Paul Corbin is half man and half woman, a genuine hermaphrodite. Gordon
Drake was born without any forearms, the upper arms ending in stubs about the
elbow, stubs that he learned to handle so dexterously that he was one of the
most interesting attractions of the circus."</p>

<p>"I did better with them than I ever have with these artificial arms,"
admitted Drake ruefully.</p>

<p>"Fenwick was another queer experiment of nature," went on the Phantom. "One
vertebra in his neck is missing. Instead, he has a section of limber cartilage.
He is able to dislocate his neck and assume the appearance of a man with a
broken neck at will. That is why he always wears a high, stiff collar.</p>

<p>"And that completes our group of unusual men, men so bizarre that they felt
they had no place in normal life. So they remained banded together, forming a
little club of their own which they called the Gargoyle Club and where they
could be at ease and at rest, where nobody stared or commented on the infirmity
or deformity of another."</p>

<p>"But why did Fenwick go berserk?" demanded Gregg.</p>

<p>"All their holdings were pooled," explained the Phantom. "All their wealth
was in a holding corporation which was licensed under the name of the Star
Corporation. They supported charitable institutions for afflicted persons. Upon
their several deaths, the estate was to go into such endowments.</p>

<p>"But Fenwick was the exception. Instead of pitying others, he was intensely
bitter&mdash;and he was the least afflicted of the lot. Since he couldn't inherit
from the others, he undertook to murder and rob them.</p>

<p>"The thwarted armored truck holdup would have been his sweetest haul. He
must have planned his bloody crimes for years. I doubt if he knew Al Millett
was still alive until Dickson gave Estella Millett a job at the Palladium Club.
And that only intensified matters, because Fenwick was a disappointed suitor
for the hand of Estella's mother.</p>

<p>"I think I was about the last person to hear Andrews's voice. I surprised
Fenwick with him at the Gargoyle Club the night he was killed, and when I so
nearly was. And, gentlemen, I think that about winds up the most bizarre case I
have ever had the pleasure of assisting the Homicide Bureau with. We all owe a
great deal of thanks to Mr. Frank Havens for his painstaking research and
finding of old records."</p>

<p>"Which reminds me of one thing," spoke up the publisher. "How did my
cartoonist, Collins, get mixed up in this business?"</p>

<p>"That was an unfortunate accident," said the Phantom. "He was a very
inquisitive and aggressive young chap. He was acquainted with Estella Millett,
who knew of these men from her father. One night in an unguarded moment, she
let something slip about fact being stranger than fiction. She mentioned the
names of Dickson and Marcy, and that was all Collins needed. He ferreted out
enough to seal his own doom.</p>

<p>"What puzzled me for a long time was how the leader of the crime gang always
knew I escaped from his death traps before he should have known. That was the
first clue which led to Fenwick. Fenwick kept in touch with the Phantom through
Mr. Havens, and that smartness was finally instrumental in bringing about his
downfall."</p>

<p>Carl Fenwick raised his head and stared at the Phantom with hate-glazed
eyes. Then, uttering a mad cry of bafflement, he tore free from the laxly
guarding officers and rushed straight toward the nearest window. Heedless of
the shouts behind him, he dove head first through the glass.</p>

<p>When those with sufficient hardihood gained the window and looked down, they
saw uniformed police running to surround the ghastly remains of the most
horrible Gargoyle.</p>

<p>By an irony of fate, Carl Fenwick had actually broken his neck in his
fall.</p>

<p>"I am truly sorry for you all," said the Phantom wearily. "I only hope you
who are left are able to pick up your lives and go on bravely from here. As for
me&mdash;" His broad shoulders drooped with fatigue. "&mdash;I think I'll retire to the
shades and sleep for a week."</p>

<p>They watched him depart in awed silence. Only Frank Havens knew the full
extent of the suffering the Phantom had borne, and his heart swelled at the
thought of the man who had dedicated his wealth and his life to protect and
safeguard his fellow men from crime while the careless world little suspected
that the rich idler, Richard Curtis Van Loan, was the Phantom who troubled the
dreams of criminals.</p>
