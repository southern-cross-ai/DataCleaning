<h2><a id="ch1" name="ch1">CHAPTER I. NIGHT WINGS</a></h2>

<p class="first">"DIKAR," Marilee said, low-voiced.</p>

<p>"Of all the day between sunrise and sunrise, I am most happy
in this quiet hour just before bedtime." Lying on the grass
beside him, the warmth of her love enfolded Dikar like the warmth
of the fire behind them and the scent of her in his nostrils was
sweet and clean as the breath of the woods that enclosed the
wide, long clearing. "I am so happy that I'm afraid," Marilee
went on. "Something out there in the night hates to see me so
happy."</p>

<p>Dikar's great paw tightened on the slim, small hand of his
mate, but he said nothing. "I'm afraid," Marilee's gray eyes
widened, "that someday it will take you away from me, and leave
me all empty."</p>

<p>Dikar's high forehead was deeply lined with thought, his lips
pressed tightly together within his blond, silken beard. From the
logs on the Fire Stone the crackling flames leaped high, reaching
always for the leafy canopy a giant oak held above them, never
quite touching it. The ruddy light of the flames filled the
clearing, from the long Boys' House on one side to the Girls'
House on the other, from the Fire Stone at this end to the table
and benches under the pole-upheld roof of the eating place at the
other. The light played on the brown, strong limbs of the Boys of
the Bunch, on the slender bodies of the Girls, as they walked
slowly or lay, like Dikar and Marilee, in pairs on the grass,
murmuring.</p>

<p>Over the clearing the purple-black Mountain hung, and the
forest enclosed the clearing with night. The forest was silent
with its own queer silence that is made up of countless little
noises; the piping of insects, the chirp of nesting birds, the
scurry of small beasts in the brush, the babble of streamlets
hurrying to leap over the edge of the Drop.</p>

<p>Dikar thought of the Drop, of how its high wall of riven rock
completely circled the Mountain, so barren of foothold that no
living thing could hope to scale it unaided. He thought of the
tumbled stones below the Drop, stones big as the Boys' House and
bigger, and of how the water of the streamlets foamed white and
angry between the stones, and of how beneath stones and water
slept the Old Ones who brought the Bunch to the Mountain in the
Long-Ago Time of Fear that none of the Bunch remembered clearly,
most not at all.</p>

<p>"Dikar!" As Marilee's head rolled to him, a gap formed in the
rippling mantle of her soft, brown hair and a round, naked
shoulder peeped through. "You won't let it take you away from me,
will you? Will you, Dikar?"</p>

<p>Beyond the tumbled stones, as far as Dikar could see from the
topmost bough of the tallest tree on top of the Mountain,
stretched the Far Land where they lived from whom the Old Ones
had hidden the Bunch on this Mountain.</p>

<p>"Why don't you answer me, Dikar?" There was sharpness in
Marilee's voice. "Don't you hear me? Dikar! What are you thinking
about?"</p>

<p>Dikar smiled slowly, his blue eyes finding Marilee. "I am Boss
of the Bunch, Marilee," he rumbled. "And I've a lot to think
about. You know that."</p>

<p>"Yes," she whispered. "I know. But sometimes you could think
about me."</p>

<p>"I do. Always." Dikar loosed his hand from Marilee's and,
sliding it under her supple waist, drew her close to his great
body. "Whatever else I think about, I am always thinking about
you too." The trouble within him was a little eased as he looked
into her bright and lovely face. "Do I have to tell you
that?"</p>

<p>"No," she murmured, nesting warm against him. "You don't have
to tell me." She sighed with contentment. Her eyelids drooped
drowsily, but Dikar's remained open as his gaze returned to the
Boys and the Girls in the clearing.</p>

<p>All the Boys had grown in the long years since the Old Ones
brought them here, their cheeks and chins fuzzed, their flat
muscles banding torsos naked save for small aprons of green twigs
split and plaited. Slim the Girls had grown, slim as the white
birches in the woods, and graceful as the fawns that bedded in
the forest.</p>

<p>Their loose hair fell rippling and silken to their ankles but
as they moved Dikar glimpsed lean flanks, firm thighs brushed by
short skirts woven from reeds, ever-deepening breasts hidden by
circlets woven of leaves for the unmated, of gay flowers for each
who had taken a Boy as mate.</p>

<p>Near the middle of the clearing three or four of the younger
Boys knelt, playing with small, round stones the game called
aggies. They were beardless as yet, their faces rashed with small
pimples, and as they argued about the game their voices were now
deep as Dikar's own, now broke into thin squeals.</p>

<p>Abruptly their chatter hushed, and then one of them was on his
feet, was running towards where Dikar lay. He was Jimlane, thin-
faced, puny, but keenest-eared of all the Bunch.</p>

<p>Dikar put Marilee out of his arms and was rising when Jimlane
got to him. "I hear one, Dikar!" the kid gasped. "It's far away,
but I hear it."</p>

<p>"Shut up, everybody!" the Boss called aloud. "Listen."</p>

<p>There was no sound in the clearing, save for the crackle of
the fire. For a long time Dikar heard no sound except the crackle
of the flames behind him, the tiny noises from the woods. And
then there was another sound, so faint that he was not quite
certain he heard it. In the star-prickled sky, it was a buzz like
the buzz of a bee although no bee flies at night.</p>

<p>"There!" Jimlane pointed. Where he pointed a star moved, a
sparkle of light like a star. "See it?"</p>

<p>"I see it," Dikar said, quietly. Then, more loudly but just as
calmly. "Out the fire, Bunch. Quick."</p>

<p>They came running toward him, the Boys and the Girls, and past
him into the edge of the woods and then out again, and now each
had in his hands a birch bark bucket of earth. Marilee snatched a
burning stick from the fire and darted with it into the woods,
and the others threw earth on the fire, till the flames flickered
and were gone, and the clearing was dark as the forest.</p>

<p>Dikar stared into the sky.</p>

<p>The buzzing was louder now, and nearer. The dot of light came
nearer and nearer, moving among the stars, and about it the stars
blotted out, and shone again behind it, and now Dikar could make
out a black shape in the sky.</p>

<p>"In the houses, Bunch," he ordered, and he heard swift
movement in the darkness, the padding of many feet. He was alone,
standing under the canopy of the great oak, with the hot smell of
burned wood in his nostrils and of baking earth.</p>

<p>The noise in the sky was no longer a buzz but a great roaring
and the black shape was very distinct now; its spread wings, its
long body, the yellow light at its very tip. Like a bird, it was,
but larger than any bird. Its wings lay flat and without motion,
like a soaring bird's, but no bird soared so long without wing
flap, no bird soared so straight. It was a plane and there were
men in it, and it was flying straight toward the Mountain. At the
height it flew, it would just clear the tall tree that stood on
the tip of the Mountain.</p>

<p>The roar of the plane beat at Dikar. The plane was almost
overhead now and Dikar was afraid.</p>

<p>Dikar was afraid as he was in the dream that so often came to
him in his sleep, dream of the dark Time of Fear when he was a
very little boy called Dick Carr, and the sky over the city would
fill with screaming of sirens, and he would run hand in hand with
his mother to crouch in the subway, the ground heaving and
rolling under their feet. A dream it was, but also a memory so
vague Dikar could not be sure which was memory, which dream. But
this was no dream, this rattling thunder that clubbed at him out
of the sky.</p>

<p>"It will go by," he said to himself. "They always go by."</p>

<br>

<p class="first">EVERY once in awhile a plane would fly over the
Mountain. At the first sound of it the Bunch would hide&mdash;if
at night, first outing the fire. The Bunch knew, not quite
knowing how, what the planes were, but they were not afraid of
the planes. They hid from them because it was one of the musts
the Old Ones had left, and the musts of the Old Ones must be
obeyed.</p>

<p>No more than the rest of the Bunch Dikar had been afraid of
the planes until the day not long ago when he had gone down into
the Far Land from which they came.</p>

<p>Dikar had gone far and wide that day, a shadow flitting
through the fields and the woods, a silent shadow none saw; but
who had seen white men and women huddled within fences of thorn-
covered wire, had seen them beaten by yellow men till the blood
ran. He had seen a thing, dried and gray, swing from a tall pole
at the end of a rope, and the rags that fluttered about the thing
had told him it once had been a man. He had seen white men and
women working, thin and sunken-eyed and so weak they could hardly
stand; when they fell, had seen them lashed to work again by men
dressed in green, men with yellow faces.</p>

<p>Dikar had seen many terrible things that day, and he had
learned how terrible they were who ruled the Far Land that had
seemed so pleasant from his perch on the Mountain's tallest
tree.</p>

<p>It was they who rode in the planes, and Dikar knew what it
would mean to the Bunch if they found out the Bunch lived on the
Mountain, and this was why Dikar was afraid when there was a roar
in the sky and a plane flew overhead. But this plane was now
hidden from Dikar by the oak's canopy, and the roar in the sky
was lessening.</p>

<p>"It's gone by," he said to himself, "like they always&mdash;"
The roar in the sky was loud again, the plane, lower now was
again blotting out the stars&mdash;A white light blazed in the
sky, a great white light like the sun! It floated down, making
the woods green, filling the clearing with brightness!</p>

<p>Terror was ice in Dikar's veins.</p>

<p>This too was out of his dream, a white light floating down out
of the sky, a noise like hundreds of sticks rattling along a
hundred fences, screams and crashes, the screams of kids who were
fleeing a destroyed city, the crashes of the trucks in which they
fled. The truck in which was eight-year-old Dick Carr, in which
were Mary Lee and the other kids who now were the Bunch, rocking
to a halt on a tree-roofed side road. The two Old Ones stiff with
terror on the front seat of the truck...</p>

<p>That white light floating down, showed only an empty clearing,
weather-grayed houses about which there was no sign of life. The
light was fading. The black plane was turning again to its
course, was blotting the stars no longer, itself was blotted by
the purple-dark Mountain. The roar in the sky became the buzz of
a monstrous bee. Dikar wiped cold sweat from his forehead with
the edge of his hand.</p>

<p>From the plane, held high by the tall forest and steep slope,
they had seen nothing of life in the blaze of their white light
and they had flown away. But why had they turned back? Why had
they lit the clearing with their white light? Always before the
planes had flown straight on, over the Mountain.</p>

<p>The bee-buzz in the sky faded to nothingness. The shrilling of
insects in the woods began again. Dikar cupped hands about his
mouth and called, "Come out. Come out wherever you are."</p>

<p>Forms began to come out of the doors of the houses. Dikar
turned to face the woods. "Come out, Marilee," he called through
his cupped hands. "M-a-a-arilee."</p>

<p>His shout rolled away into the purple-dark woods, seeking the
cave where Marilee hid with the burning stick that must light the
fire again, as was her job when a plane came in the night. "M-a-
a-rilee." Behind Dikar the Bunch chattered, but no light from
Marilee's flaming stick moved among the black tree trunks.</p>

<p>"Ma-a-rilee," Dikar called again, sending his shout into the
whispering night of the woods. The woods sent his shout back to
him. "Ma-arilee," hollow and mocking, and that was all the answer
that came to his shout.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch2" name="ch2">CHAPTER II. TO FIGHT NO-FAIR</a></h2>

<p class="first">BREATH pulled in between Dikar's teeth and he
was lunging past the oak's enormous bole, plunging into the dark
woods. Earth was cold and wet to the soles of his feet. Cold,
wet-earth smell was in his nostrils and the green smell of the
woods and the smell of mouldering leaves and of the pale things
that overnight grew among the leaves. Faintly in his nostrils,
too, was the sharp tang of smoke, and that could only be from the
stick Marilee had carried off to the cave.</p>

<p>Even to Dikar's eyes, keen as they were, there was no light
here, but he moved swiftly, never stumbling, avoiding tree trunks
and bushes with the sure deftness of the small woods creatures,
no more aware than they how he did so. The ground lifted under
his feet, and then there was no longer ground under his feet but
rock.</p>

<p>Dikar stopped, sensing walls about him, a roof above him, and
so knowing he was in the cave he sought. "Marilee," he called
into the sightless blackness. "Marilee. Where are you?"</p>

<p>No answer came. But in his nostrils the smoke-tang he'd
followed was sharp, so Dikar knew that Marilee had been here. In
his nostrils was the warm, sweet smell of his mate, so that Dikar
knew she was still here, somewhere in this blackness-filled
cave.</p>

<p>He started moving again, slowly, groping with his feet in the
dark. And his feet found her, found her form outstretched on the
cave's rocky floor, unmoving even when his feet thudded against
her.</p>

<p>"Marilee!" Dikar choked and went to his knees beside Marilee,
gathered her into his arms.</p>

<p>She stirred in his arms! "Dikar." Breath gusted from Dikar's
great chest at that uncertain murmur, breath he did not know till
now had been caught in his chest, "Oh, Dikar."</p>

<p>"What happened to you, Marilee? What&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;Someone sprang on me from behind, just as I reached
the cave and hit me! Dikar! The fire stick! Where&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Not here. Or if here, gone out. No. Not here. Even if gone
out its smell would be stronger&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The fire, Dikar!" Sudden terror in Marilee's voice, of life
without fire, of food without fire to cook, of winter without
fire to warm. She was out of his arms and on her feet. "I've lost
the fire, Dikar."</p>

<p>Dikar whirled out of the cave, was running through the woods,
Marilee at his side. They burst out of the woods into the
clearing and Dikar was shouting, "Get the dirt off the fire logs,
everybody. Quick."</p>

<p>Dikar went on without stopping, darting to the door of the
Boys' House, into it. He lifted an axe from its pegs on the wall,
was out in the open again, was running toward where the Bunch
were scooping earth off the piled logs on the Fire Stone.</p>

<p>He shoved through the Boys and Girls, made out, by the dim
light of the stars, a log they had uncovered, black, lifeless.
His axe swept up, smashed down.</p>

<p><i>Chunk!</i></p>

<p>The log split open. Red' sparks flew, stinging Dikar's legs.
He did not feel them. He was staring at the redness from which
they had flown, the glowing red heart of the log that still had
life in it, the life of the fire, the life of the Bunch. "Dry
leaves," he commanded. "Bring dry leaves. Quick! Bring dry twigs.
Billthomas! Halcross! Build up the fire. Fredalton! Take this axe
and split up one of those logs into little sticks."</p>

<p>Dikar watched Billthomas put dry leaves on the glowing
redness, watched the leaves take flame from the log's heart.
Watched Halross feed little dry twigs to the leaves and the twigs
catch flame from the leaves, and the sticks from the twigs. The
fire grew again on the Fire Stone, and the light of the fire grew
again in the clearing, but Dikar's forehead was deep-lined and
his eyes were no longer blue, and in the darkness of them was a
red light that did not come from the fire.</p>

<p>Dikar's eyes moved over the red-lit faces of the Bunch that
stood about the Fire Stone watching the fire grow again; and his
eyes seemed to ask a question of each face and pass on. They came
to one face, and stayed on it, Dikar's brow-lines deepening.</p>

<p>That face was chunk-jawed, black-stubbled, the eyes too small,
too closely set, but what held Dikar's gaze was the odd, leering
grin that sat on the thick lips.</p>

<p>Tomball had had little to grin about since the day Dikar had
returned from the Far Land and ended Tomball's short time as
Boss, forcing him to confess to the Bunch how he had tricked his
way to being Boss in place of Dikar. Why, then, was he grinning
now?</p>

<p>"Do you think it was <i>he</i> who hit me?" Marilee whispered
in Dikar's ear, "and ran away with the fire stick?"</p>

<p>"Who else of the Bunch would do a thing like that?"</p>

<p>"But why should he, Dikar? He's smart enough to know that if
we lost the fire it would be as bad for him as for the rest of
us."</p>

<p>"That's what I don't&mdash;Wait! I've got a hunch. Look. Walk
along with me like we were just talking about nothing important.
Laugh a little, you know, and hold on to my arm."</p>

<p>Marilee's fingers were cold on Dikar's arm, but her laugh
rippled like a little stream running over pebbles in its bed.
They walked slowly away from the fire reached the shadowy edge of
the woods, were closed around by the forest darkness.</p>

<p>"Now!" Dikar said, and he was flitting through the forest
night, Marilee a silent shadow behind him. It was like her to
stay close behind, like her to ask no questions as he ran through
the woods to the cave again.</p>

<p>At the cave-mouth Dikar stopped a moment, sniffing the air.
"Yes," he said, more to himself than to Marilee. "I can still
smell the smoke of the fire-stick. The wet night air holds smells
a long time." Then he was moving again, following the sharp tang
of smoke in the air, following it away from the cave and away
from the clearing.</p>

<p>The scent-trail led him downhill. Soon the laugh of a
streamlet came to his ears and then Dikar pushed through tangling
bushes and came out into starlight on the edge of the brook that
he heard. The smoke smell was very strong here&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look, Marilee!" Dikar pointed to a black something at, his
feet, half in, half out of the water. "Here is your fire stick."
He squatted to it.</p>

<p>"He brought it here to put it in the water," Marilee said,
squatting beside him.</p>

<p>"No," Dikar answered, his voice a growl deep in his chest.
"No. He slipped on a wet stone and fell, and the water outed it.
See. Here are the marks of his knees on the bank. But he brought
it here because this was the nearest open place in the woods, the
nearest place where its light could be seen from the sky."</p>

<p>"From the sky? Dikar! What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean that I know now why the plane turned back." Even in
the dimness Marilee could see that Dikar's face was hard and
still, his lips tight and gray. "If he hadn't slipped and dropped
the stick in the water, so that they were not sure they'd
seen&mdash;" Dikar stood up. "Come," he said, grimly.</p>

<p>When they came again into the clearing, it was filled once
more with the wavering light of the fire and everything was as it
had been before Jimlane had heard the plane. Dikar paused beside
the Fire Stone, stood there straddle-legged and glowering, a
muscle twitching in his cheek.</p>

<p>Marilee laid finger tips on Dikar's arm. "There's Tomball,"
she whispered. "Talking to Bessalton down there near the eating
place."</p>

<p>Dikar's gaze moved to where she had said. Bessalton was Boss
of the Girls and tallest of them, her cloak of hair black as
deepest night, her legs long and slender, her hips wide. Tomball
was heavy-built beside her, bulging arms hanging loose almost to
his knees, great chest black-matted, his belly black with matted
hair. Black-haired was Tomball, and squat. He was strongest of
the Bunch, and there was shrewdness in him too, a shrewdness
Dikar already had learned to fear.</p>

<p>The little muscle twitched in Dikar's cheek. "Marilee," he
said, low-toned. "Find Jimlane and Billthomas, and tell them to
come to me first chance they can without anyone seeing them."</p>

<p>She slipped away. Dikar watched her, slim and lovely, the
fire's red light caressing her, and there was pain in his arms
and his chest, sweet pain of the knowing that she was his.</p>

<p>Tomball too watched Marilee, small eyes following her, thick
lips a little parted. Seeing this Dikar felt a tightness in his
neck and across the back of his shoulders. His hands closed into
fists. If he wasn't Boss of the Bunch!</p>

<p>Dikar's hands opened and lifted, cupping around his mouth. "Ho
Bunch!" he called through his cupped hands.</p>

<p>The talk in the clearing stopped, and the strollers turned to
him. "Bedtime, Bunch," Dikar shouted. "A good sleep and happy
dreams to you all."</p>

<p>"A good sleep to you, Dikar!" they cried to him, but Tomball
did not cry Dikar a good sleep as he went toward the Boys' House
with the others of the mateless Boys, while the mateless Girls
went toward the Girls' House, and the mated pairs went hand in
hand past the end of the eating place and into the dark woods
behind. Dikar saw Marilee waiting for him by the eating place,
but he did not go to her till Steveland and Halross, pimply-faced
youngsters whose turn it was to stay awake the night and watch
the fire, had taken their places on the smooth bench-rock near
the Fire Stone.</p>

<p>"Be sure that one of you stays always awake," he told them.
"Be sure to listen always for the sound of a plane in the sky. If
you hear one wake the Bunch right away to out the fire."</p>

<p>"Yes, Dikar," Steveland said, his blue eyes wide. "We get you.
A good sleep, Dikar."</p>

<p>"A quiet night to you both," Dikar said and went to join
Marilee and go with her to the little house in the woods behind
the eating place that, when they took each other for mates, he
had built from logs to be theirs and theirs alone.</p>

<p>"Dikar," Marilee said, her eyes puzzled in the ruddy dusk that
sifted through to her from the fire. "Why didn't you tell the
Bunch about Tomball's hitting me and taking the fire stick to
where the plane could see it? Why didn't you punish him for
it?"</p>

<p>"Would it be fair, Marilee, to say to the Bunch that it was
Tomball, when we do not know that it was? Would it be fair to
punish him for doing it, when we do not know that he did it?"</p>

<p>"But we <i>do</i> know!"</p>

<p>"No, Marilee. We do not. You saw nothing and I saw nothing
that would make us sure it was him. Or did you see
something&mdash;something you have not told me?"</p>

<p>She stopped, Dikar stopped, looking at her face on which the
dim red light fell leaving the rest of her in shadow, thinking
how lovely her face was, the red light tangled in the cloudy
softness of her hair, her gray eyes grave and thoughtful, her
small mouth puckered.</p>

<p>"No-o," Marilee breathed at last. "No, I saw nothing that
would make me sure it was Tomball. But I am sure, and you are
sure, because we know that Tomball is the only one of the Bunch
who would do a thing like that. Look, Dikar. Tomball wants to be
Boss, and if he cannot be Boss of the Bunch he would destroy the
Bunch, and he would stop at nothing to do it. You know all that
as well as I do."</p>

<p>Sadness came into Dikar's face, and trouble in his eyes. "Yes,
Marilee, I know that as well as you do. Tomball has always wanted
to be Boss, and when he couldn't get to be Boss by fighting fair
he fought no fair, and now that he knows he can't get to be Boss
by fighting either fair or no fair, he would destroy the Bunch
rather than have me or anyone but him be Boss. But it would not
be right for me to fight him any other way than fair."</p>

<p>"Why, Dikar? If Tomball wants to destroy the Bunch, it seems
to me it would be right for you to fight him any way you can,
fair or no fair. Why isn't it?"</p>

<p>The lines were back in Dikar's forehead. Very clearly he knew
the answer to what Marilee asked, but it was very hard to think
of how to say it in words. "Look, Marilee," he cried. "When we
were littler we played lots of games, and we always picked
someone for umpire to see that everybody played according to the
rules of the game, because if there were no rules there would be
no game. Remember?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Dikar. I remember."</p>

<p>"Now sometimes the umpire himself would be no fair, letting
one side break the rules. And then the other side would break the
rules too, and pretty soon the game would bust up because with
all the rules broken there was no game any more. Right?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But I don't see&mdash;"</p>

<p>His gesture stopped her.</p>

<p>"You will in a minute. Look. The life of the Bunch is no game,
but it is lived according to rules, because if there were no
rules, if every one of the Bunch did just as he or she wanted to,
all the time, there would be no Bunch. Now, I don't think you or
anybody else would say that if we hadn't lived all these years as
a Bunch; sharing what we had, sharing the work, each doing what
he can do best, all helping one another; any but the strongest of
us would be alive and happy today. Would you?"</p>

<p>"No. We are all alive and happy after the long years here on
the Mountain because we have helped each other."</p>

<p>"And played fair with each other. You call me Boss and obey
me, but you really obey the rules the Old Ones left us and the
rules the Bunch has made for themselves, and all I am is an
umpire to see that everybody obeys the rules, to see that
everybody plays fair. Now, suppose I played no fair myself.
Suppose, whenever I felt like it, I broke the rules. What would
happen?"</p>

<p>She answered slowly:</p>

<p>"Everybody else would break the rules too. I see. Because if
the umpire is no fair, all the ones playing the game feel it's
all right to be no fair too."</p>

<p>"Exactly. And pretty soon there would be no rules any more,
and the Bunch would bust up. If Tomball is trying to destroy the
Bunch, I've got to fight him. But if I fight him no fair, that
will destroy the Bunch, sooner or later, much more surely than
anything Tomball could do, or anything they who live in the Far
Land can do. Now do you understand, Marilee?"</p>

<p>"I understand," Marilee said. And then she cried, "But you've
got to do something, Dikar! You can't let him&mdash;" She stopped
short, twisted to a noise in the brush behind her. "Dikar!
There's somebody&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Dikar thrust her behind him. "Who's there?" he demanded, his
neck thickening. "Who is it?"</p>

<p>Shadows moved in the shadows of the brush, where the red light
from the fire could not reach.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch3" name="ch3">CHAPTER III. THE GUN ON THE ROOF</a></h2>

<p class="first">"WHO'S there?" Dikar cried again, and then the
shadows were coming out into the light, and they were Jimlane and
Billthomas.</p>

<p>"Marilee told us you wanted us," Jimlane said. "We waited till
everyone was asleep in the Boys' House."</p>

<p>"Did anyone see you come here?"</p>

<p>"No. They were all asleep."</p>

<p>"All right," Dikar said. "Listen, Jimlane and Billthomas. I
have a job for you, but I am not going to order you to do it. I'm
going to ask you to."</p>

<p>"We'll do it, Dikar," Billthomas said. He was shorter than
Jimlane, yellow-haired, blue-eyed, his skin as smooth as any of
the Girls', his movements as graceful. "We'll do anything you ask
us."</p>

<p>"Anything at all," Jimlane agreed.</p>

<p>"Wait, youngsters," Dikar warned, "You may not be so ready to
promise that when you hear what it is. I hate asking you to do
it, but it needs to be done, for the good of the Bunch. It won't
be easy. You may be hurt doing it, you may even be killed. Nobody
but Marilee and me will know that you're doing it."</p>

<p>Two pairs of bright eyes were fixed on his face. "If it's for
the Bunch, we'll do it," Jimlane said. "Whatever it is. Tell us
what you want us to do, Dikar."</p>

<p>"Before I tell you, you must promise, cross your hearts and
hope to die, that you will say nothing about it to anyone.
Whether you will do it or not, you will always keep silent."</p>

<p>"Cross my heart and hope to die," Billthomas said solemnly. "I
will say nothing." Jimlane said the same and then the two spat
over their left shoulders to show that they could never take back
what they had said.</p>

<p>"Now listen," Dikar said when they had done that. "The job is
to watch Tomball, by day and by night. You sleep in the Boys'
House with him, and I'll always make sure to put you on the same
jobs with him, so that part ought to be easy.</p>

<p>"If he slips off any time, day or night, by himself, I want
you to follow him without his knowing it. Do you think you can do
that?"</p>

<p>"We once followed a deer all day," Jimlane said, "All over the
Mountain, and it never knew we was anywheres near."</p>

<p>"I know that," Dikar nodded. "And that's why I picked you to
ask first to do this job. I also know you two are champeens of
the Bunch at shooting with bonarrers, an' that's another part of
the job."</p>

<p>The eyes of the youngsters widened, but they said nothing.</p>

<p>Dikar went on. "Keep your bonarrers near you all the time, and
if Tomball does go off by himself, take 'em along. If you see him
start to make a fire where it can be seen from the sky, or from
the kind of woods that will make a smoke go up through the tops
of the trees, shoot him in the legs, right away, and out the
fire. If he starts to go out of the woods to the edge of the
Drop, in the daytime when they who live in the Far Land might see
him, shoot him in the legs and drag him back. Stop him if he does
anything else that might show Them that someone lives here on the
Mountain. Do you get me?"</p>

<p>"We get you, Dikar." Billthomas looked puzzled. "But all those
things are Must-Nots of the Old Ones. Why do we need to shoot him
to stop him from doing them? If he tries to, the Old Ones would
wake from their sleep under the rocks at the bottom of the Drop
and strike him down. He wouldn't dare to do 'em, and if he tried,
the Old Ones wouldn't let him."</p>

<p>"Look, Billthomas." Dikar put his hand on the kid's shoulder.
"Do you remember the time when the Bunch stoned me away from the
clearing and made Tomball Boss?"</p>

<p>"And you came back with a little gun that made a noise and
killed our fawn, and you made the Bunch listen to you while you
proved why we shouldn't have stoned you away. And then you threw
the gun up on the roof of the Boys' House and fought Tomball who
should be Boss, and licked him. Sure I remember."</p>

<p>"Well, between the time I was stoned away and the time I came
back, I went to the edge of the Drop, and I climbed down the Drop
to the rocks under which the Old Ones sleep. That is the most
terrible of all the Must-Nots of the Old Ones, but they didn't
wake from their sleep, and they didn't strike me down. Nothing
happened to me. I went into the Far Land, and I came back, and
the Old Ones did nothing to me."</p>

<p>"You went into the Far Land," Jimlane repeated in awed tones.
"Dikar! Did you see <i>Them?"</i></p>

<p>"I saw Them, Jimlane, an' I saw many things that made me know
how very terrible it would be if they found out the Bunch lives
on the Mountain. But the Old Ones did nothin' to stop me. The Old
Ones sleep under the rocks, Jimlane, an' under the water that
foams over the rocks, an' they cannot awaken to stop Tomball from
lettin' Them who live in the Far Land know that the Bunch is here
on the Mountain."</p>

<p>"But Dikar!" Billthomas broke out. "Tomball wouldn't do
anythin' like that!"</p>

<p>"I hope not," Dikar answered slowly. "Honest Injun, I hope
that he wouldn't. But I must be sure, an' I'm askin' you two to
help me be sure&mdash;No wait," he said as he saw their mouths
start to open. "Before you answer I want you to remember how
strong Tomball is, an' how he said he would kill you, Jimlane,
that time when you wanted to tell the Bunch why they were wrong
in stonin' me away, an' how afraid of him you were, that time. I
want you youngsters to think of that before you say that you will
do this job."</p>

<p>"I've thought about it, Dikar." Jimlane stood very straight in
the firelight. "I won't say I'm not afraid of Tomball, but afraid
or not, I will watch him, an' I will do my best to stop him from
doin' anythin' that will hurt the Bunch."</p>

<p>"Me too, Dikar," Billthomas said his voice clear and steady,
his eyes steady as Dikar's own. "I am afraid of Tomball, but I
will do this job the best I can."</p>

<p>"Good kids," Dikar said. Something had him by the throat, so
that it was hard to say it, and he could not answer when the Boys
wished him and Marilee a good sleep and slipped away, their naked
young bodies ruddy one moment in the firelight, then merged with
the noiseless dark.</p>

<p>"Oh Dikar," Marilee's soft voice said in his ear. "They're so
young. Are you right in what you are doin'?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," Dikar sighed. "I don't know, Marilee." And
then he said, "It is a hard job to be Boss of the Bunch. A
dreadful hard job."</p>

<br>

<p class="first">HER hand reached up to his cheek, her cool
fingers touched it, lightly, "A hard job, Dikar," she said
softly. "But it is night, an' just past these bushes is our
little house, an' there you are not Boss of the Bunch but my
mate..."</p>

<p>He drew her close to him, her softness close against the
hardness of his body. He looked into her eyes, and then his head
sank and his lips found hers.</p>

<p>A little later they knelt by their bed of pine boughs covered
with a white blanket of rabbit fur. "Now I lay me down to sleep,"
they said together. "An, should I die before I wake..."</p>

<p>What was it like to die, Dikar wondered. He had seen death, of
course, a deer killed by his arrow, a squirrel stiff and glazed-
eyed under last year's leaves. What was it like to lie stiff like
that, never seeing again the flaming colors of the sunrise, the
shimmer of sunlight on water, never feeling again the coolness of
the wind on one's skin, the warm touch of the rain? "God bless
the Bunch," he said, along with Marilee. "God bless
Marilee..."</p>

<p>Marilee rose but Dikar stayed on his knees. He heard the
piping of the insects outside the little house, the peep of the
nesting birds, the whisper of the trees. They were trying to tell
him something, but he could not quite make out what it was.</p>

<p>"Poor Dikar," Marilee said. "You're so tired you've fallen
asleep on your knees."</p>

<p>"No," Dikar said, rising, nor could he sleep, even with
Marilee in his arms, their cover of rabbit-fur warm over him.
Something was troubling him. Something that he must do, and he
could not think what it was.</p>

<p>He lay wide-eyed, watching the open door of the little house
grow pale with the light of the moon that was rising over the
Mountain, watching the leaf shadows dance in the pale moonlight.
With the moon a wind rose in the forest and the rustle of the
treetops was louder, and bough-tips tapped on the roof&mdash;</p>

<p>The roof! That was it! Billthomas had spoken of the little gun
Dikar had taken from one of Them down in the Far Land, a black
faced one, and had thrown up on the roof of the Boys' House and
forgotten. Dikar had seen what that small thing could do, and
Tomball had seen what it could do. Dikar must get it. Now.
Tonight. Get it and hide it...</p>

<p>Marilee stirred in her sleep as Dikar slowly took his arms
from about her. She muttered something, but she did not awaken.
Dikar stole, more silent than the shadows, through the woods,
reached a tree whose boughs overhung the Boys' House, swung
himself up into those boughs and from them to the roof of Boys'
House.</p>

<p>The moonlight was bright on that roof, every crack in its gray
boards, every mark of them, distinct. There were faded, dried
leaves on it, broken twigs...</p>

<p>But no gun.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch4" name="ch4">CHAPTER IV. THE SOUND OF GUNFIRE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE sun struck brightness through Dikar's
eyelids and though the night had held very little sleep for him,
he was instantly awake. He flung out his arm to waken
Marilee&mdash;found only the fur of the bed-covering!</p>

<p>He rolled over. She wasn't there beside him. She wasn't
anywhere in the little house. Dikar was on his feet, his eyes
wide, his heart bumping his ribs. The door of the house darkened
and Marilee stood there.</p>

<p>"Marilee!" Dikar exclaimed. "I thought&mdash;What's the
matter?" She had hold of the doorpost, as if to hold herself up
by it. There was green under the bronze of her skin and her
forehead was wet with sweat. "Marilee!" Dikar made the single
long stride that took him to her. "What's wrong with you?"</p>

<p>"Wrong?" Her eyes refused to meet his. "Nothin', Dikar." She
laughed, but it was not the merry tinkle that her laugh always
was. "Listen, sleepyhead. The Boys are already on their way to
the bathing pool." Gay shouts, the threshing of many bodies
through the brush, came to him. "Go quick, or they'll be through
before you have rubbed the sand from your eyes."</p>

<p>"Marilee." Dikar's hand was on her shoulder. "What&mdash;?"
She jerked free of his hold, faced him, her lips tight and
white.</p>

<p>"Go, you fool!" she yelled at him and thrust past him into the
house, threw herself on the bed. "Let me alone."</p>

<p>Dikar stared at her, unbelieving. Never before had she yelled
at him in anger, never before had her morning smile failed him.
She lay face down, unmoving.</p>

<p>"Marilee," Dikar named her. "If I've done somethin' to make
you angry at me, I ask your pardon, but what have I done?"</p>

<p>"Nothin'." He could hardly hear her. "You have done nothin',"
she sobbed. "But please go, Dikar. Please leave me alone."</p>

<p>Dikar turned slowly away, heard his name called from outside.
"Comin'," he answered red-bearded Johnstone, who called from the
little house where he lived with Annjordan, "Last one in the
bathing pool's a yellow belly."</p>

<p>They ran through the dew-sprinkled greenery, downhill to where
a stream leaped from a ledge into a shining pool that foamed with
the flashing limbs, the brown torsos of the Boys of the
Bunch.</p>

<p>Dikar dived low into the icy water, swam to the opposite bank,
stood up, shaking his head to clear his sight, the shining drops
spattering about him. He saw Tomball, squat and shaggy under the
foaming waterfall, saw Jimlane swimming nearby. Dikar dived
again, swam under water to where the drooping, slender boughs of
a willow dipped into the pool and made a screen behind which he
came up unseen.</p>

<p>The Boys' House was empty when Dikar went into it by the door
away from the clearing. He darted to Tomball's bed, lifted the
coverings from it, pressed hands on grass-filled bag under them.
There was no hard lump inside the bag. He looked under the
cot&mdash;a darkening of the light straightened him, whipped him
around.</p>

<p>Tomball stood spraddle-legged just inside the open door from
the woods. His hands were stretching a bow taut, and laid across
the bow was a stone-pointed hunting arrow that could kill a
deer&mdash;or a Boy.</p>

<p>"Got you," Tomball grunted, his eyes, small and red, hating
Dikar. "This is Fredalton's bonarrer. Nobody saw me leave the
bathing pool just like nobody except me saw you, an' I'll be back
there before they find you." The head of the arrow was pulled
back to the curve of the bow's wood. Dikar's muscles tightened to
dodge the arrow, but he knew he could not hope&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Whang!</i> </p>

<p>Tomball's arrow was broken in two parts, was clattering to the
floor! Dikar threw himself headlong down the length of the Boys'
House, tripped over the bow that Tomball had flung in his path.
Thrust at the floor to get up and saw another arrow quivering in
the wall toward the clearing, saw Tomball dive out of the door
toward the woods, got to that door only in time to see Tomball
vanish in the brush.</p>

<p>Dikar shook his head to clear it of its stunned surprise that
he was still alive, that Tomball's arrow had broken at the exact
moment it was loosed at him.</p>

<p>"Dikar!" Billthomas, slender brown body wet-shining, face
gray-white, was suddenly there in front of him. "He didn't hurt
you?" There was a bow in his one hand, the other reached out to
Dikar. "He didn't&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"No, Billthomas," Dikar said, guessing now the meaning of that
second arrow. "Thanks to you." His voice was steady enough, but
inside him he was shaking, knowing suddenly how close he had been
to death. "That was as fine a shot as ever was made on the
Mountain."</p>

<p>Billthomas' blue eyes shone with the praise. "It was nothin',
Dikar. The sun was on Tomball's bonarrer through the other door,
makin' it a good mark, an' I was only ten paces away. Any of the
Boys could have hit it."</p>

<p>"How did you come here, just in time?"</p>

<p>"Carlberger ducked Jimlane," Billthomas answered. "While he
was under Tomball got to shore. I saw him from the other end of
the pool an' I followed, I stopped to pick up my bonarrer where
I'd hidden it near by, like you told us to last night. That let
Tomball get out of sight, but I tracked him. When I got to the
edge of the woods he was already in here, was pullin' tight his
bow. But why're we wastin' time? I'll call the Bunch to hunt him
down&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No!" Dikar commanded. "No, Billthomas. I will not have the
Bunch know that one of them has tried to kill an other. For then
there will be only two things left for the Bunch to do. Either
they must stone him from the clearing; an' that will make certain
of his hate for the Bunch, with no hope that he will ever change;
or they must kill him, which is worse. That the Bunch shall kill
one of themselves coldly and with thought before, is more
dreadful than that Tomball should have tried to kill me, excited
an' angry."</p>

<p>"But, Dikar&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"But nothin'! This is a thing I will take care of myself, in
my own way, an' it will remain a secret between you an' me. You
will not call the Bunch." Dikar said sharply, his eyes
commanding. "You will call Jimlane only. The two of you must
track Tomball an' keep him always in sight, but you will not let
him know you are around unless he does one of the things I talked
about last night, or unless he tries again to hurt one of the
Bunch. If that should happen, stop him, but hurt him as little as
you can help, an' tell me about it. Get me?"</p>

<p>"I get you, Dikar."</p>

<p>"Then call Jimlane, an' get busy."</p>

<p>"Yes, Dikar." Billthomas was gone into the woods and Dikar
heard the trill of a lark from where Billthomas had vanished,
three times, and from far off he heard the answering three trills
of a lark, and he knew that Billthomas had called Jimlane, and
that there would not be a moment from now on that Tomball would
not be under the eyes of the two youngsters. But Dikar's forehead
was furrowed and his heart heavy within him as he turned to pluck
Billthomas' arrow from the wall and the pieces of Tomball's arrow
from the floor, and went out into the woods to hide them.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">IT was queer, he thought, how he had talked to
Billthomas the way he did just now, without thinking about what
he was going to say beforehand. It was as if someone else had
talked with his voice, someone much wiser than he was.</p>

<p>It was queer, too, how he knew now that what he had said was
the right thing to say. How he knew now, sure as that his name
was Dikar, that what he was doing was the best thing for the
Bunch.</p>

<p>And for Tomball too. After what had happened Tomball would
stay away from the Bunch, afraid of what Dikar would do if he
came back. The youngsters would be watching him, but Tomball
wouldn't know that. He would think he was alone on the Mountain,
and he would learn what it meant to be alone, as Dikar had, and
he would learn what it meant to be one of the Bunch and have a
place in its life.</p>

<p>After awhile Dikar would send Tomball word by Jimlane or
Billthomas that he need not be afraid to come back, and when he
did come back he would be ready to take his place in the life of
the Bunch, and he would give Dikar and the Bunch no more
trouble.</p>

<p>That was what Dikar hoped would happen.</p>

<p>The Boys came back, shouting and happy, from their morning
swim in their bathing pool, and the Girls came back to the
clearing from their pool on the other side of the clearing, and
they all ate breakfast at the long table of the eating place.</p>

<p>Marilee came to sit beside Dikar when breakfast was all on the
table. Dikar looked sharply at her, but her color was all right
now, her eyes bright again. She didn't say anything about what
had happened in the morning, and Dikar didn't say anything about
it, only too glad to forget about it and to let her forget.</p>

<p>It was Steveland who first said something about Tomball and
Jimlane and Billthomas not being there. Across the table so that
all could hear, Dikar told him that he had sent them on a special
job on the other side of the Mountain, a job that might take them
three or four days, and that they would not come back till it was
finished.</p>

<p>Before anyone could ask what the job was, Dikar started
telling what everybody was to do that day, although he usually
didn't do that till after breakfast.</p>

<p>There was a lot to do, because it was time to start getting
ready for the winter.</p>

<p>Dikar sent some of the Bunch to hunt for deer whose meat would
be dried over the fire, and whose skins the Girls would make into
clothing against the cold days to come. He sent some to pick
berries that would be cooked with the sugar that they'd gotten
from the maple trees in the spring, and others to search for
honey in hollow bee-trees, and he set some to stopping up cracks
in the walls of the houses with mud.</p>

<p>He himself took four of the older Boys, Johnstone and Danhall
and Henfield and Bengreen, up near the top of the Mountain, to
where some big trees had been blown down by a storm last year, to
cut them up into logs for the fire now that they were dried out
and would burn well and without smoke.</p>

<p>When they went to the Boys' House to get their axes, Danhall
said that it would be a good idea for them to take their
bonarrers along too, in case they happened to see a deer or some
squirrels, and Dikar agreed. They hung their quivers of arrows on
low bushes, and rested their bows against the bushes, and set to
work.</p>

<p>It was shady and cool where they worked, and <i>the kerchunk-
kerchunk of</i> their axes was a pleasant sound. Soon Dikar had
almost forgotten what had happened last night and this morning,
and the day seemed no different from all the other days on the
Mountain. He liked the way the flying chips shone bright yellow
against the dark green of the moss and the almost black brown of
the ground, and he liked the way little spots of sunlight
filtered through the leaves high overhead and danced on the
ground. He liked the smell of new-cut wood in his nostrils, and
the smell of damp earth and of last year's leaves, and the sweet
smell of the breeze that was like the scent of Marilee's
breath.</p>

<p>It was grand to feel the swell of his muscles, their smooth
swell in his arms and across his back, to feel the <i>chunk</i>
of his axe into a great tree-trunk, to feel the wood break apart
under his strength; grandest of all to feel the touch of the
other sweaty shoulders against his own as together the five would
yank and haul at a hewn log.</p>

<p>Marilee and Annjordan, Johnstone's mate, brought lunch up to
the choppers&mdash;cooked rabbit meat and dandelion greens and
blackberries big as the end of Dikar's thumb. Dikar and Marilee
sat a little apart from the rest, eating their lunch, washing it
down with icy water brought from a nearby stream in a cup of
birch bark.</p>

<p>"Dikar," Marilee murmured. "I have often wondered about the
Drop." Her finger touched a little blue flower that grew out of
the moss by her knee, but she didn't quite seem to know she
touched it. "It goes all around the Mountain, an' it's so high
an' steep. We were very little, Dikar, when the Old Ones brought
us here. How did they climb the Drop with us?"</p>

<p>"They didn't." Dikar recalled his dream, recalled the memory
that gave form to his dream. "The Drop didn't go all around the
Mountain then. A sort of narrow hill slanted up to the top of the
Drop, left by men who had been cutting away rock from the
Mountain, the same men who built the houses in the clearing an'
left cots here, an' these axes an' all the other tools we use. A
road ran on top of that narrow hill, an' the Old Ones brought us
up that road."</p>

<p>"What became of the hill an' the road?"</p>

<p>"The Old Ones hid us on the Mountain from the terrible hordes
who came out of the East an' across the continent from the West
an' up from the South," (Dikar was repeating words a Voice had
said in his dream). "But some of them came to the foot of the
Mountain, so the Old Ones brought the narrow hill down, on them
and on themselves," he told Marilee what his dream had helped him
to remember. "That is why there is no road to the top of the
Drop, an' why the Old Ones sleep under the rocks, down there
below the Drop."</p>

<p>"I know you went down there once, Dikar, but you never told me
how you got down there, nor how you got up again."</p>

<p>"I plaited a rope of vines, Marilee, as long as the Drop is
high. One night I tied the rope's end to a tree an' let it down
where a stream leaps out an' down, so that the rope hangs behind
the white curtain of the stream an' cannot be seen from below. I
climbed down the rope, an' by it I climbed up again the next
night, havin' seen what they have made of the Far Land that looks
so green an' pleasant from the top of our Mountain."</p>

<p>"You climbed down a rope of vines!" Marilee's hand went to the
flowery circlet that covered her breast. "You might have been
killed, Dikar!"</p>

<p>Dikar nodded. "Yes, I might have been killed, an' I didn't
care much whether I was or not. I'd been stoned from the Bunch,
remember, an' you had cried me no fair. Have some more of these
berries, Marilee. They are swell."</p>

<p>"No. You have them." Marilee fed them to Dikar, placing them
one by one between his lips. Then they were finished. Dikar lay
back, and Marilee lay by his side, quiet and drowsy, and Dikar
was dreamily content.</p>

<p>Marilee stirred. "Dikar. Does the rope still hang behind the
stream where it leaps down?"</p>

<p>Dikar sat up, pounding his knee with his fist. "Jeeze! It
does! I did not lift it when I came back to the Mountain, an'
I've forgotten it since. I must do that. Tonight I must do it, as
soon as it is dark enough that I cannot be seen from below when I
go to the edge of the Drop. Do not let me forget."</p>

<p>"I sure will not," Marilee answered. And then, with that
curiosity Dikar had noticed all the Girls had so much more than
the Boys, she asked, "Just where is the rope?"</p>

<p>Dikar looked about him, thinking how he could tell her. He
knew every inch of the Mountain as well as he knew the lines on
his palm. "That's funny," he laughed suddenly. "That brook,
there, is the very one at whose end the rope hangs. By following
it down the Mountain you would get to it. But look," he went on,
rising, "the sun no longer strikes straight down through the
treetops, an' much as I hate to send you away, it is time for
work again."</p>

<p>"Yes, Dikar," Marilee sighed, reaching a hand for him to take
hold of and lift her by. "Time for work." As she came up she
swung close to him, and her arms went around his neck and her
lips pressed against his, and they were flame on Dikar's lips,
burning flame in his veins. "Oh, Dikar," Marilee sobbed. "I hate
not to be with you."</p>

<p>"It is only for a little while," Dikar murmured. "Only till
night." He held her away from him, drinking her in with his
eyes.</p>

<p>"What are you goin' to do till night, Marilee?" he asked. "I
like to know what you do, all the time, because that way I can
think myself with you, an' am not so lonely for you when we are
apart."</p>

<p>"That's sweet, Dikar," Marilee smiled, touching Dikar's cheek
with her fingertips. "I shall be somewhere in the woods.
Bessalton wants me to hunt for a certain kind of grass that is
best for sewin' with. Think of me a lot, Dikar," she said, and
Annjordan called her, and she was gone.</p>

<p>Dikar and the rest set to work again. Marilee's lips still
burned on Dikar's, and the touch of Marilee's fingertips lingered
on his cheek, and he would not wipe the sweat from his face lest
he wipe that touch from it too.</p>

<p>The <i>kerchunk-kerchunk</i> of the axes ran loud and long
through the woods, and the pile of cut logs grew slowly but
steadily. The beams of sunlight striking down from the leafy roof
of the forest slanted more and more, and the shadows lengthened.
At last Dikar rested.</p>

<p>"Enough for today, fellows," he said. "Tomorrow we'll&mdash;"
The words caught in his throat. He'd heard a sound from far down
the Mountain, a sound that should not be in the woods.</p>

<p>The sound came again, very far off, but Dikar knew what it
was. He'd heard it down in the Far Land, and once, only once, on
the Mountain. That time he'd made the sound himself, shooting the
little gun out of the great oak that canopied the Fire Stone.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch5" name="ch5">CHAPTER V. OVER THE DROP</a></h2>

<p class="first">"COME, fellows," Dikar snapped, springing to the
bush where hung his bow and arrows, snatching them up. "Quick."
He was off through the woods, running down toward along the bank
of the stream because there it was clearest of bushes and trees.
The other four ran after him.</p>

<p>Long the time seemed, endless, that Dikar ran thus through
familiar woods suddenly grown strange and fearful. Dreadful the
thoughts that Dikar thought as he ran. Who had shot off a gun on
the Mountain? Had that plane, last night, seen something to tell
those who rode it that someone lived here? Had they climbed the
Mountain, the men dressed in green that he'd seen in the Far
Land, the men with yellow faces and black who were so brutishly
cruel?</p>

<p>Never had Dikar run so fast. The others could not keep up with
him, so fast he ran, but still he saw nothing but the flicking
shadows of the woods and the glinting sun on the stream beside
which he ran. The stream was rushing faster now, was hurrying to
throw itself over the Drop, just ahead&mdash;</p>

<p>Dikar dug heels to stop himself. Something in the
water&mdash;Jimlane! Jimlane lay face down in the water, very
still, and the water that swirled away from the still, small body
was pink and dreadful. Jimlane lay in the water, but on the bank
of the stream lay Billthomas, limp as an arrowed deer, his side
red and terrible with blood.</p>

<p>Dikar dropped to his knees beside Billthomas, and inside him
Dikar was cold, cold as ice. "My fault," he heard himself groan.
"I set you to watch Tomball, an' Tomball had the gun hid in the
woods, an' he got it an' shot you. My fault, Billthomas."</p>

<p>Dikar touched Billthomas, and Billthomas moved under Dikar's
hand, Billthomas' eyes opened and stared up into Dikar's face,
unseeing. Then they smiled. A faint smile touched Billthomas'
gray lips and they moved, but Dikar could not hear what they
said.</p>

<p>"What?" Dikar's voice was hoarse, strange to him. "What,
Billthomas?" He bent, got his ear near Billthomas' lips.</p>

<p>"What are you tryin' to tell me?"</p>

<p>"Tomball&mdash;" the faint whisper came. "Went&mdash;over
Drop&mdash;Took&mdash;Marilee&mdash;with him..." The whisper
faded, Billthomas' eyes closed.</p>

<p>"What?" Dikar yelled. "What was that about Marilee?
Billthomas! Did you say Marilee&mdash;?" But he saw that
Billthomas did not hear him.</p>

<p>Shouts, exclamations, above him told Dikar the Boys had
meanwhile come up. "Jumped over the Drop!" someone exclaimed.
"They must be smashed on the rocks&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," something shrieked inside Dikar's head. "Not Marilee!"
and he was on his feet, was twisting toward the edge of the
Drop.</p>

<p>The stream rushed away from Jimlane's still body, rushed down
to the end of the woods. Not five paces away it leaped
out&mdash;up from where it leaped slanted a thick rope of plaited
vines to the great trunk of the last tree of all and it was wound
round and round that trunk, tight-fastened.</p>

<p>Tomball and Marilee had not jumped over the Drop&mdash;!</p>

<p>Somehow Dikar was at the edge of the Drop, careless whether
from below they saw him or not. Dikar was looking down, his eyes
burning.</p>

<p>Down and down fell the white spume of the stream, down and
down fell the awful wall of the Drop, gray-shadowed. Far, far
below, the stream smashed itself on a great, jagged rock and
joined the waters that brawled white and angry among huge rocks
that might have been tumbled there by some unimaginable giants at
play.</p>

<p>For a wide space from the foot of the Drop the ground was
covered by the great rocks, and that space was made somehow
fearful by the shadow of the Mountain that lay on it, but beyond
it the sun still lay on a green forest that stretched away to the
Far Land.</p>

<p>Dikar's staring eyes found the edge of that forest, found two
figures, small as the dolls the Girls used to make out of rags
when first the Bunch came to the Mountain. Two figures clambered
over the rocks, nearing the edge of the forest, and the one
behind was chunky, black-haired, and the one ahead was brown with
her mantle of brown hair!</p>

<p>Till now Dikar had clung to a hope that he had not understood
Billthomas rightly, that Billthomas had been mistaken, but now
that hope was ended. A terrible rage flared up in Dikar, a rage
hotter than the heart of the fire on the Fire Stone. He snatched
an arrow from the quiver hung on his shoulder, fitted it to his
bow.</p>

<p>"This was why she asked me how I climbed down the Drop," ran
searing through his mind. "She planned it this mornin' with
Tomball. This mornin' she stole from our bed to seek Tomball an'
warn him I'd set the kids to watch him, an' they planned then to
kill the youngsters as soon as they'd found out how to flee from
the Mountain, together."</p>

<p>He had Tomball on the angle of his arrowhead. The muscles in
his arms swelled, the bow grew taut. Careful, now. Careful. The
distance was great. He must not miss.</p>

<p>He might miss Tomball and hit Marilee.</p>

<p>What matter? She was as much to blame as he.</p>

<p>Dikar couldn't! His fingers wouldn't open on the bowstring,
wouldn't loose the arrow that might bury itself in the flesh of
Marilee.</p>

<p>But he must! Not because they fled him. Not even because they
had killed Billthomas, and Jimlane. Because even if they didn't
want to, the men in green would make them tell where they'd come
from, make them tell about the Bunch. That thought opened Dikar's
fingers.</p>

<p><i>Whang!</i> </p>

<p>Dikar's arrow flew straight and fast and true&mdash;far out
over the rocks it veered, was no longer a live and deadly dart,
was a dead stick tumbling aimlessly down, a plaything of the
wind.</p>

<p>Another arrow lay ready across Dikar's bow, but he did not
loose it. No use. They were too far&mdash;Marilee reached the
woods, and Tomball. The woods swallowed them. They were making
their way through those woods to Them&mdash;</p>

<p>Dikar turned to voices behind him, saw Danhall and Henfield,
Johnstone and Bengreen, huddled just within the edge of the
woods, pale-faced, mouths agape, eyes wide and dark. "Johnstone,"
Dikar snapped, banging his bow over his shoulder. "Take over as
Boss. Take care of Billthomas an' Jimlane. I'm goin' down."</p>

<p>"You dare not," Danhill gasped. "Dikar, you dare not. The Old
Ones will strike you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Damn the Old Ones," Dikar snarled and was in the stream, had
hands on the rope. He was lowering himself over the edge of the
Drop. His legs caught around the vine-rope.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">THE water battered Dikar. The water filled
Dikar's mouth and his eyes and his nose, so that he could not see
nor breathe nor hear anything but the roar of the waters. The
water had a hundred clubs that pounded Dikar, bruised him.
Suddenly the water was only a stinging cold spray on Dikar's
naked skin, and he was swinging free between the wet-black face
of the Drop and the roar of the stream as it fell, and he was
climbing down the rope of plaited vines.</p>

<p>This was as it had been that other time Dikar had climbed down
this rope of plaited vines, but that time it had been night and
once he had gotten through that first rush of waters it had been
black-dark. Bad enough it had been to climb down into dizzy dark,
but now there was light, and Dikar could see how the Drop came
down from nothingness above and went straight down to nothingness
below.</p>

<p>He could look down, endlessly down the swinging frail thread
of the rope, down to where the jagged points of rock waited for
him if he fell, and the stream smashed itself on the rocks as
Dikar would smash if he fell.</p>

<p>From the rocks, so far below, there reached up hands that
Dikar could not see, and they pulled at him, pulled him down to
the rocks, his climbing too slow for them. Dikar wanted to let go
of the rope, wild the desire was in him to let go and fall, fast
and faster, down to those gray painted rocks.</p>

<p>Dikar was sick, sick with the terror that he would let go and
with the wanting to let go. Suddenly his arms and his legs were
without strength to move. He clung to the rope, unmoving, knowing
that in the next moment, the very next, he would no longer have
even the strength to hang on. "Dikar!" His name came through the
mists that swirled around him. "Go on, Dikar. Go on." Dikar
looked up to the voice, and he saw that it came not from far
above, as it ought, but from the rope itself, from Danhall,
hanging on the rope not far above him.</p>

<p>Down through the seething waters at the top of the rope,
Bengreen climbed, the water streaming from him! They were
following Dikar down. Danhall and Bengreen were following him
where he went, in spite of their fear of the Old Ones, in spite
of their fear of what might await them down below the Mountain.
He was their leader, and they followed him&mdash;</p>

<p>Strength was back in Dikar's legs and his arms and he was
climbing down again, but he kept his eyes on the wall of the Drop
and did not look down. And at last his feet found rock beneath
him and Danhall was beside him, and Bengreen; and then Henfield
dropped off the rope.</p>

<p>"We wouldn't let Johnstone come," Danhall said, squeezing
water from his brown beard, "because you said he should be Boss.
What do we do next, Dikar?"</p>

<p>Dikar looked across the waste of tumbled rock to where Tomball
and Marilee had been swallowed by the woods. "We go after 'em an'
bring 'em back," he said through tight lips, "or we don't go back
ourselves. Come on."</p>

<p>They climbed across the stony space, slipping and falling.
When they reached the woods, that seemed no different from their
own woods, it was easy at first to follow the trail of those they
followed, by the small growth they had trodden down, by twigs
bent with their passage. Marilee and Tomball had gone carelessly,
not knowing they would be followed.</p>

<p>The shadow of the Mountain lengthened with the fast-dropping
sun, and it grew dim about the four who hunted a Boy and a Girl.
The green faded out of the bushes about them, the brown out of
the tree trunks. All color grayed in the dimness, and suddenly
there were no marks by which the four could tell which ways
Marilee and Tomball had passed.</p>

<p>They cast around, their keen eyes searching each depression in
the mossy floor of the woods, the way each tiny leaf hung on the
brush, but they could find no sign of where Tomball and Marilee
had gone, no sign that they'd ever been farther than where a twig
pressed into the last mark of Tomball's foot.</p>

<p>The four Boys from the Mountain came together again, and
huddled close, and they became aware that the graying air was
chill against their skin, and the forest seemed strangely hushed
about them.</p>

<p>"I don't like it here," Henfield said, and it seemed right
that he spoke low-toned, as though someone were near to overhear
what he said, someone or some thing no one could see. "There's
somethin' wrong about these woods. They're too&mdash;too quiet."
He was yellow-haired as Dikar, his chin fuzzed with what would
soon be a beard like Dikar's. "The birds are still, an' the
insects, an' I've not seen or heard a rabbit or a squirrel, or
anythin' livin'."</p>

<p>"I don't get it." Bengreen was the shortest of the four, his
face sharp, his eyes black and deep as a forest pool at night. "I
don't get it at all. It's like&mdash;like Tomball an' Marilee got
this far an' then&mdash;an' then <i>were not.</i>"</p>

<p>"The Old Ones!" Henfield's voice was thin and piercing, louder
it would be a scream. "The Old Ones have taken 'em an' they'll
take us. We're lost! Dikar, we're dead an' worse than dead!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch6" name="ch6">CHAPTER VI. DEATH IN THE WOODS</a></h2>

<p class="first">A CHILL struck deep into Dikar as he heard
Henfield's cry. All his life, all his life that was real to him
and not a dream of Long-Ago, Dikar had believed that anyone who
broke a Must-Not of the Old Ones would meet with a punishment the
more awful because none knew what it was. By climbing down the
Drop Marilee and Tomball had broken the most fearful of those
Must-Nots.</p>

<p>Dikar recalled that he was the first of the Bunch to have
broken that Must-Not, and that he had not been punished. "The Old
Ones sleep under the rocks," he snapped, angrily because of the
tremble of fear that had not yet left him. "They're not in these
woods an' there is nothin' else here that could have taken
Tomball an' Marilee without leavin' a sign. Stop talkin'
foolishness an' use your eyes, an' you will find some sign of
what took 'em, or of which way they went."</p>

<p>"Maybe," Danhall grunted. "Maybe <i>you</i> can, Dikar, seein'
you're so smart."</p>

<p>"Maybe I can," Dikar answered. "Wait here, an' I'll try." He
turned from them, moved to a big tree near which they were
standing, ran up into its top as swiftly and easily as any
squirrel. Thick boughs made steps for Dikar's feet, leaves
rustled against his face, stroked his body, and then his head
came out through the roof of the tree into a sunlight strangely
ruddy.</p>

<p>The top of the forest stretched away from Dikar, a strange,
bright green in that light, and solid seeming. About as far from
him as from the clearing to the edge of the Drop, the forest
ended and past its end the ground rose in a hill that was neither
green nor stone&mdash;gray like any other ground Dikar remembered
ever seeing, but a pale yellow that seemed to be striped.</p>

<p>Up through this yellow ground a wide brown stripe curved to
the top of the hill, where, sharp-lined against the darkening
sky, was a house not as long as the Boys' House but higher, its
roof curiously shaped. Midway up the front of the house another
roof stuck out, and the outer edge of this was post-propped like
the roof of the eating place.</p>

<p>Just above this smaller roof, a row of windows flashed red as
though there was fire within, but no smoke rose from the house,
so Dikar knew this could not be.</p>

<p>Dikar's eyes came back to the leafy canopy of the woods. A low
exclamation guttered in his throat. All that green stretch swayed
a little with the wind, but, quarter way between him and the edge
of the forest a tree swayed <i>against</i> the wind, and then
another, just beyond, did the same.</p>

<p>Dikar marked the direction in which the trees moved so
strangely, and dropped down to the waiting Boys. "Found 'em!" he
cried. "They've taken to the treetops. They're goin' that way."
Dikar threw out his arm to show.</p>

<p>"Come on then," Bengreen cried.</p>

<p>"Not in such a hurry," Dikar checked him. "They don't know we
follow 'em, an' they'll be goin' slow, not sure of what is ahead.
We can take time to think, an' we must, for remember Tomball has
the gun an' can kill us, one by one, before we get near enough to
him to bring him down with our arrows."</p>

<p>"What then, Dikar?"</p>

<p>Dikar told them the plan that had come into his head, and, as
he had ordered, they spread out wide either side of the path
Tomball and Marilee traveled, wide of each other because that way
there was less chance of making noise to warn Tomball. Then they
moved in the direction those they hunted moved, swift and
soundless as when they hunted a deer downwind.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">NOW that Dikar was alone he needed no longer to
pretend to be unafraid. These woods were fear-filled, as Danhall
had sensed, but not for the reason Danhall had named. The Old
Ones did not prowl them, nor were there any other strange beings
in them that could make a Boy vanish.</p>

<p>The dread that lay heavy here was the dread that lay over all
this Far Land, of Them who were more cruel than any beast, of
their fists and whips and guns and the fearful things they did to
the people who once had lived peacefully in this land.</p>

<p>There was no longer an endless, rolling thunder in the sky,
such as Dikar remembered from his dream of the Long-Ago, but in
the sky was a dark, dark cloud, unseen but very real, that laid
over all the land, over the forests and the fields and the
cities, a night of the soul that had lasted long, too long.</p>

<p>Only on the Mountain had there been any light, this long time,
any hope of a tomorrow. Dikar was thinking of his dream, as he
ran naked and silent through the woods, was thinking of the Voice
he had heard in his dream, the Voice that had spoken to the
mothers who, with their very littlest children and the very
oldest of the men, were the last ones left in the last city
untaken by the hordes, the city there no longer had been any hope
of saving from them.</p>

<p><i>"This is the dusk of our day,"</i> the Voice had said,
<i>"of the America we lived for, and die for. If there is to be
any hope of a tomorrow, it must rest with these little children
in an attempt to save whom you are about to sacrifice yourselves.
If they perish, America shall have perished. If by some chance
they survive, then, in some tomorrow we cannot foresee, America
will live again and democracy, liberty, freedom, shall reconquer
the green and pleasant fields that tonight lie
devastated."</i></p>

<p>The little children of whom that Voice had spoken, all of them
who survived the flight from the city, had grown now to be the
Bunch on the Mountain. And now, when almost they were ready for
their task of bringing that tomorrow to these once green and
pleasant fields, two of them swung through the treetops to betray
them to their enemies, and destroy them.</p>

<p>It was of this that Dikar thought as he ran through the woods.
Had Tomball been only his own enemy, only one who had taken his
mate from him, if Marilee had been only the mate who was false to
him, Dikar would have sent Danhall and Henfield and Bengreen back
to the Mountain and pursued them alone. But it was the enemies of
the Bunch he hunted, the enemies of an America, love for which,
though he had never known it, was part of Dikar's blood, part of
his breath, part of his soul.</p>

<p>And so Dikar came to the edge of the forest and fell to his
hands and knees and crawled a little way out into the high,
yellow grasses that striped with yellow the hill beyond the
forest, and lay there waiting.</p>

<p>Somewhere in these grasses, Dikar knew, along the front of the
woods, lay the three others, their eyes on the tops of the trees,
on the green brush that met the grasses, arrows fitted to their
bows, as his was. For this was his plan.</p>

<p>When Tomball and Marilee came to the edge of the woods, and
came out into the open, the nearest Boy would shoot them down at
once, before they were seen, before Tomball had a chance to use
his gun. That they would come into the open, Dikar did not
question. Had not Tomball tried, last night, to show the flame of
the fire stick to the plane? Tomball was not afraid of Them.
Tomball had come down to the Far Land to look for Them.</p>

<p>If only it did not get too dark to see Tomball, and Marilee,
before they came out of the woods. The sun no longer lay on the
grasses here. It just touched the roof of the house, there on top
of the hill, soon would leave that too.</p>

<p>The sun no longer lay on the grasses, here where Dikar hid,
but the hot smell of the sun was in his nostrils, and the ground
was still warm with it. The ground was warmer than the ground on
the Mountain ever got, it was warm as the body of Marilee when
Marilee lay against Dikar's body, and the scent of the grasses
was like the scent of Marilee's breath.</p>

<p>A lump rose in Dikar's throat. He was waiting here for
Marilee, waiting to send an arrow into her slim, brown body. As
so many times he had waited hidden in the forest to kill a deer,
he was waiting to kill Marilee.</p>

<p>In that very instant that her lips lay on his, burning,
Marilee had been thinking how she would find Tomball, how she
would tell him of the rope that hung over the edge of the Drop!
With her arms about Dikar, she had planned how to help Tomball
kill Jimlane and Billthomas!</p>

<p>If ever anyone deserved to be killed, it was Marilee!</p>

<p>The ache in Dikar's breast was not an ache but a terrible,
tearing pain&mdash;his muscles tightened. His head lifted, his
lips tight-pressed within his beard, his nostrils flaring, ears
and eyes straining.</p>

<p>Dikar started to ease, tensed again. No, that rustle in the
treetops was not made by the wind. It came nearer. Nearer.
Something brown, moving, showed among the leaves. Vanished. An'
arm it had been, of this Dikar was sure, though he could not be
sure whether it was Marilee's or Tomball's. They had come
straight to him. He it was who must kill Tomball. Who must kill
Marilee.</p>

<p>The pain within Dikar was as if someone had plunged an arrow
into his vitals, was twisting it&mdash;</p>

<p>Dikar saw a form, crawling out on a thick bough. It was
screened by the leaves at first, then Dikar saw black hair, a
thick-lipped face. Tomball! Peering out of the tree with narrowed
eyes. Dikar leaped erect, his bow taut&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Whang!</i> </p>

<p>A feather quivered where Tomball's eye had been. Tomball,
sprawling, black-shaggy, tumbled out of the tree, thudded into
the brush beneath. A scream, a Girl's scream, came out of the
tree and Dikar had another arrow laid across his bow, was
tautening his bowstring once more. Shadowy in the treetop he
could see Marilee. Marilee's voice came out from among the
leaves. "Dikar!"</p>

<p>Marilee was out now, where Dikar could see her plain. Erect on
the bough where Tomball had been, she held to an upper bough with
one hand, stretched the other out to Dikar.</p>

<p>She was crying his name again. Her long hair was caught back
among the leaves out of which she'd come, and Dikar could see her
satin body, her lovely body he had held in his arms. His eyes
fastened on the flowery circlet over Marilee's left breast. He
would shoot her there&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dikar! What are you doing, Dikar? You're not going to&mdash;"
Marilee's cry was checked by the arrow that was in her side,
caught by its head in her flesh. She swayed, started to fall.
Dikar's shot had gone wrong!</p>

<p>Dikar hadn't shot at all. <i>His</i> arrow was still across
his tautened bow! Marilee fell! She caught the tree's lowermost
bough with blind hands, hung from them, red streaking her side
from where the arrow was caught in it. Someone else had shot her
with that arrow. One of the other Boys. Marilee's left hand
dropped from the bough by which she hung. The right hand let go
and she fell&mdash;</p>

<p>Into Dikar's arms, somehow he was under the tree in time to
catch her. Her weight crashed him down into the brush, but he
fell sitting, with Marilee in his arms.</p>

<p>"Dikar." Her lips were white, her nostrils flaring. "You
killed Tomball." There was pain in her brown eyes, but they were
shining. "I'm glad. He was awful. I saw him shoot Jimlane and
Billthomas, an' then he turned the gun on me&mdash;said he'd
shoot me if I didn't go with him. He had the gun an' Jimlane's
bonarrer, an' he'd found the rope long ago. First I was going to
let him&mdash;kill me&mdash;but then I went with him, hoping to
get a chance to take the gun away from him an' shoot him
before&mdash;before&mdash;he told Them&mdash;"</p>

<p>Marilee's voice, strong at first, faded away. Her head rolled
sidewise to Dikar's shoulder, lay there. She lay limp in Dikar's
arms, as so often she'd lain asleep. But she wasn't asleep now.
She was&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dikar!" Danhall was standing above them. "I was too far away
to hear what she was saying." Dikar hadn't heard anyone come up,
but Danhall and the other two were there. "I shot her. I couldn't
hear what she was sayin' to you, thought you were holdin' your
arrow because you couldn't get a clear aim at her. I could, so I
shot her. Can you forgive me, Dikar? Can you&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Forgive you, Danhall?" The words fell like stones from
Dikar's lips. "You didn't know&mdash;Sure, I forgive you for
killin' Marilee."</p>

<p>"Killin' her!" Bengreen exclaimed. "Bunk! She's not killed.
Look at the way she's bleedin'. I've killed too many deer not to
know bleedin' stops when one's dead. She's alive, you nuts, but
she won't be alive long if you keep on sittin' there, holdin' her
like a ninny an' lettin' her bleed."</p>

<p>"Not dead," Dikar whispered, staring down at the redness that
welled out of Marilee's side and ran down over his thighs. "She's
not&mdash;"</p>

<p>He could think again, could move again. He lifted Marilee
across his arms, laid her gently down on a bed of soft moss near
the foot of the tree out of which Danhall had shot her, knelt
again.</p>

<p>"Find me some of those leaves that stop bleedin'," he threw
over his shoulder. "Quick." He saw now that the arrow had gone
deep in Marilee's side, but its point had hit bone and so it had
not gone in far enough to kill her, not even far enough for its
barbs to be held except by a little skin. Dikar pulled the arrow
out, flung it away. Blood spurted and he put his hands down on
the wound, pressed.</p>

<p><i>"Lift han's up, you fella!"</i> a new voice ordered, hoarse
and terrible. "Hurry befoh you get one big lot lead in you."</p>

<p>Dikar's hands were red with Marilee's blood, but the bleeding
had stopped and if he lifted them it would start again. He turned
his head to say so, saw a great long gun pointing from out in the
light, saw the black hands that held the gun, and the man against
whose shoulder the hands held the gun.</p>

<p>The man stood straddle-legged out in the yellow field. He was
dressed in dark green, and the little round things that held the
green together were yellow bright in the fading light. His black
face was flat-nosed and shiny, animal like. His thick, purplish
lips snarled like those of a wildcat, just before it pounces on
its prey.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch7" name="ch7">CHAPTER VII. REFUGE</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE brush rustled, a little way from Dikar,
where Bengreen and Danhall and Henfield had been looking for the
leaves Dikar needed. "Come out you fella," the black man ordered.
His big eyes, that had too much white in them, moved back and
forth a little and his long gun moved back and forth. "Come out
fom dere."</p>

<p>Dikar's heart bumped his ribs. Neither eyes nor gun were
moving quite to where he was. The black man hadn't seen him! The
black man was out there in the light but Dikar, bent down behind
the tall brush that marked off the field and the woods, was in
the deep shadow of the woods and so the man with the gun hadn't
seen Dikar at all.</p>

<p>Arms above his head, Bengreen came out in the field, and
Henfield and Danhall came out beside him. "Stop dere," the man
said, and the look on his black face, gaping at them, was funny.
"Wat kind fella you are?" the black gasped. "W'ere your
clo'es?"</p>

<p>"What clothes?" Bengreen asked, grinning. "This ain't winter,
is it?" Dikar looked down at his hands. They were red with
Marilee's blood but she wasn't bleeding any more. If he took his
hands away she would start bleeding again, and she would die.</p>

<p>"You one fella tink you smart, huh?" Dikar heard the black
man's hoarse voice, but Dikar was remembering what he had seen
men like him do to white women, that dreadful day when he had
been in this Far Land before. Better for Marilee to die than
that. "But Jubal smarter," he heard. "Jubal know you 'scape from
one fella jail camp an' take all clo'es off so if you get killed
nobody know wat guards you pay to let you 'scape. See? No use try
fool Jubal. You tell Jubal were you come from, so Jubal get
rewahd, an' Jubal make fings easier foh you."</p>

<p>Dikar took his hands away from the wound in Marilee's side. "A
good sleep to you, Marilee," he whispered. "A good night. I'll be
with you soon."</p>

<p>"W'ere you come from?" Jubal asked again, slow and hoarse, and
there was something in his voice that made Dikar shiver. A gust
of wind brought the smell of Jubal to Dikar, and that was worse
than his voice.</p>

<p>Dikar pulled an arrow from his quiver, looked around for his
bow. "If we told you,"&mdash;the grin was still in Bengreen's
voice&mdash;"you would know as much as we do." Dikar remembered
that his bow was out there in the field, dropped there when he
jumped to catch Marilee. The arrow was no good without the
bow.</p>

<p>"W'at you gonna know after Jubal blow you to little pieces
wit' dis gun? Don't fink Jubal, no do it. T'ree more dead
'Merican make no diff'rence, Jubal kill plenty already."</p>

<p>"Go ahead. Blow us to pieces an' see if we care. I dare you,
an' double&mdash;" Dikar didn't hear the rest of what Bengreen
was saying because Dikar had slithered silent as a snake, behind
the great trunk of the tree. And now he was erect, was leaping
high to the tree's lowermost bough, was lying motionless along
that bough while all about him was the rustle of leaves, loud and
terrifying.</p>

<p>"W'at dat," he heard Jubal's shout. "W'at dat in de tree?" All
of Dikar, inside him, pulled together, waiting for the thunder of
Jubal's gun, waiting for Jubal's lead to tear through him, but he
managed to make a sound through his rounded mouth, the <i>"koooo-
hooo"</i> of an owl.</p>

<p>"Nothin' but an owl, Jubal," Danball laughed. "Ain't you
ashamed, bein' scared by an owl?"</p>

<p>Dikar slid along the bough, slowly, very slowly, very
carefully, and now the tree's leaves made no more sound than as
if the wind were blowing through them.</p>

<p>"Jubal no scared," the black's voice came up to him. "Jubal
not scared of not'in', but you better be big fella scared of
Jubal. You tell were you come from, befoh Jubal count five or
Jubal shoot. One on end, with yella hair, first. All right.
One&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dikar could see them now, through the leaves, the three Boys
from the Mountain standing in a line, their arms over their
heads, brown and naked except for their little aprons, Jubal,
spraddle-legged, black and huge, his eyes small now, and red, his
long gun butted against his green shoulder and pointing straight
at Henfield.</p>

<p>"Two&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Boys were under the tip of the tree boughs, but Jubal was
farther out in the field, seven paces at least. Dikar slid
further out along the swaying bough.</p>

<p>"Three&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dikar was almost to the end of the bough, and it was bending
with his weight. If Jubal looked up now, he would see Dikar,
couldn't help but see him.</p>

<p>"Four&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dikar, gathering his legs under him, saw cords stand out on
the back of the black hand whose finger was curled around the
little thing on the gun that, pulled, would shoot it off. Jubal
was going to say five now, and then&mdash;</p>

<p>"No," Henfield screamed. "Don't shoot. Don't shoot me. I'll
tell. We're from&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dikar leaped, the whip of the bough added to the lash of his
muscles sending him out, far out over the heads of the Boys. He
hurtled down, straight down on top of Jubal, pounding the black
down. Thunder deafened Dikar but his hand slashed down, the arrow
clenched in it, lifted and slashed down again on the heaving,
screaming thing beneath him, and warm wetness spurted over
Dikar's hand and that which was beneath him heaved no longer.</p>

<p>Dikar was on his feet, and the Boys were around him, jabbering
words he could not get. Dikar saw Henfield's face, eyes still
wide, mouth still agape. Dikar's hand lashed out, slapped, open-
palmed, across Henfield's cheek.</p>

<p>"You yellow-belly," Dikar heard himself say. "You lousy
yellow-belly," and then he was striding, stiff-legged, back to
Marilee, was once more kneeling beside her.</p>

<p>Marilee lay on the green moss, terribly still and terribly
white except where the blood was scarlet on her side and browning
at the edges. Browning! The blood flowed no more out of Marilee's
wound. She'd stopped bleeding&mdash;</p>

<p>But Dikar saw the pale nostrils flutter, and he breathed
again. Her wound, he saw, had closed of itself. That was why
she'd stopped bleeding. The wound wasn't bad, Dikar saw now. Many
of the Bunch had been hurt lots worse and none had died...</p>

<p>"Here's your bow, Dikar," Bengreen said, bending to him, "An'
Jubal's gun." Dikar looked up.</p>

<p>"You keep the gun," he said, "an' take the Boys back to the
Mountain. Go in the tops of the trees, that way you'll leave no
trail. It will be night very soon now, an' you have a good chance
to get back without their bein' able to follow you."</p>

<p>"To follow us!" Bengreen exclaimed. "What about you? What
about Marilee?"</p>

<p>"Marilee can't be carried through the treetops," Dikar sat
back on his haunches, "without openin' her wound, an' so she will
surely bleed to death on the way. If we make somethin' on which
to carry her along the ground, we will make so many signs that we
would lead them straight to the Mountain. So Marilee must stay
here. I will stay with her, but I promise you that if they come,
they will not find either of us alive. Now go, Boys. The quicker
you start, the better your chances. Go."</p>

<p>Bengreen shook his head. "No, Dikar. We do not go without you
an' Marilee. But you are right about leavin' a trail to the
Mountain if we carry her, so we must stay here with you. I must
stay, I should say. I have no right to speak for the others."</p>

<p>"You speak also for me, Bengreen," Danhall said. "I do not go
back to the Bunch without you an' Dikar and Marilee."</p>

<p>"I speak for myself." Henfield stood straight in the forest
shadows that had grown so dark that he too, seemed a shadow.
"Dikar! You slapped my face. You called me a yellow-belly. Did
you have a gun pointin' at you? Did you bear a voice count, 'One,
two, three, four,' very slow, an' know that when it counted
'five,' you would die?"</p>

<p>"No, Henfield."</p>

<p>"Then what right did you have to slap my face an' call me a
yellow-belly?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I had no right, Henfield. I suppose I was no
fair."</p>

<p>"You had no right, Dikar, but you were right to call me that.
I was a yellow-belly, but I am not, an' never will be again. I
looked death in the face, an' I did not die, an' I never again
will be afraid to die. Dikar, will you let me stay with you an'
Bengreen an' Danhall an' Marilee? Because I want to. I want to
very much."</p>

<p>Dikar lifted to his feet, put his arm around Henfield's
shoulder, and smiled. "You are no yellow-belly," he said, very
quietly. "But I will not let you stay, an' I will not let
Bengreen or Danhall stay. The Bunch needs you three, an' you can
do nothin' by stayin' here. I am still your Boss, Boys, an' I
order you to go, an' it is for the good of the Bunch that I order
you&mdash;" Dikar whirled to a rustle in the brush, saw that a
formless shape blotched the fading yellow of the field beyond,
saw that Bengreen and Danhall had their bows lifted, arrows
across them.</p>

<p>"Don't shoot them things off at me," the shape said, its voice
thin as a Girl's but higher-pitched and very tired sounding. "Not
that I got much to live for, but I'm a friend, and I came to help
you."</p>

<p>"Don't shoot, Boys," Dikar said, and moved nearer, peering. He
made out that it was a woman who stood waiting for him, her dress
gray and shapeless about her thin, bent frame, the skin of her
face stretched tight over the bones beneath, her hands like
birds' claws, her hair brown as Marilee's, but drab and
lifeless.</p>

<p>"You are white," he said. "You are not one of them." In one of
her hands was something Dikar could not make out.</p>

<p>"No," the woman laughed, and the sound of her laugh sent a
chill through Dikar. "No. I'm not one of them. My name's Martha
Dawson and I was born in that house on the hill, and my father
was born there, and his father before him. But who and what I am
doesn't matter, and it's better for me not to know who you are. I
can see that you must have escaped from one of their
concentration camps, and I came down to warn you to get away
quick, before the patrol comes along to change the guard here,
and finds you."</p>

<p>"I can't go away," Dikar said. "My Marilee is hurt too bad to
be taken away."</p>

<p>"Your who?" Martha Dawson looked in the direction Dikar had
motioned. "Oh. The Girl who fell out of the tree. I heard her
scream and I looked out of the window and saw you catch her." She
was bending over Marilee. "She <i>is</i> hurt bad, isn't she? She
must have been cut by a stone when she fell. Oh, the poor
thing."</p>

<p>The woman went down on her knees, putting what she carried
down on the ground. "So pretty too, and her hair's long. I never
seen&mdash;Why, she has no clothes on, only this queer grass
skirt. You all must have been hiding in the woods a long time.
Yes, I can see that you were. You look too well fed to have been
living on the scraps they give us. Your wife has lost an awful
lot of blood. She is your wife, isn't she?"</p>

<p>"My&mdash;" Dikar checked himself. He'd remembered what "wife"
meant. It was the same as mate. "Yes. She is my wife."</p>

<p>"I thought so when you called her <i>'my</i> Marilee.' Well,
don't you worry about her. I saw the way you fought the soldier
and I thought one of you might be hurt, so I brought some stuff
along. I'll just put a plaster on this cut to hold it together,
and then you can carry her up to the house and I'll fix her up
right."</p>

<p>"Carry her&mdash;!" The way Martha Dawson's hands were working
at Marilee's side, Dikar knew that she could heal her,
but&mdash;"But won't They find her there? Won't that get you into
trouble with Them?"</p>

<p>"I've had trouble enough. A little more won't hurt. Besides, I
don't think They'll find her, or you neither, unless they search
a lot harder than they have already&mdash;Oh!" She rocked back on
her heels, her eyes widening. "But they will. They'll find that
soldier dead in the field and they'll know I couldn't have killed
him but they'll be sure I know who did it."</p>

<p>"We can hide Jubal in the woods."</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"No. That won't do. They'll see the blood all around here, and
they'll find him, never fear, them blacks is like Indians. Oh
goodness. I don't know what to do."</p>

<p>"I do," Dikar exclaimed. "Look, Martha Dawson. One of us
wanted to give us away to them an' we had to kill him." By the
calm way the woman had acted when she saw how bad hurt Marilee
was he knew he could tell her that without her getting excited.
"We'll fix things so it will look like he shot Jubal with an
arrow, an' that Jubal killed him with his gun before he
died."</p>

<p>"Good!" The woman nodded. "That will do it. But you better
carry your wife up the hill while your friends are fixing things.
We'll go up by the road, the way I came down, so as not to leave
more tracks than can be helped."</p>

<br>

<p class="first">DIKAR told the others what to do and then he
picked Marilee up in his arms, and went to the road, Martha
Dawson beside him, went up the road toward where the house was a
pale glimmer in the deep dusk that now had come down over the
hill and the fields. Just as they reached the house, Dikar heard
a shot, and he knew that Tomball had no face any longer, knew
that Bengreen was laying the long gun back in Jubal's dead hands,
and that Danhall and Henfield were wiping out as much as they
could of the marks that would show there had been more there than
just Jubal and Tomball.</p>

<p>Martha Dawson opened a door for Dikar, and he went into
darkness that smelled a little like the eating place on the
Mountain. The door closed behind him, and he felt a hand on his
arm.</p>

<p>"Bring her upstairs," the woman said. "This way."</p>

<p>Dikar didn't know what she meant, but he went the way her hand
guided him. His toes struck wood, and he half stumbled. "Come
on," the woman said, tugging at his arm.</p>

<p>"But there's somethin' in the way here. I can't go any
further."</p>

<p>"Something? Oh dear Lord! Don't you know what stairs are?"</p>

<p>"Stairs?"</p>

<p>"Wait. I'll strike a match." Dikar stood stock-still,
listening to the sound of her going away from him. He didn't like
this place. He was afraid of it. It was too closed in. He could
hardly breathe. The woman was coming back, and there was a
strange, scratching sound and then there was a little flame
growing on the end of a tiny piece of wood in her hand, and her
other hand was cupped over it, and she was looking at Dikar as if
she'd never seen a Boy before.</p>

<p>"Don't know what stairs are," she said again. "Well, I
never&mdash;! Look. There they are in front of you." Dikar looked
and he saw a kind of hill built out of wood. "Hurry and take her
up, before someone comes."</p>

<p>Dikar climbed up what Martha Dawson called stairs, and came to
a level place, and they went along the level place, and came to
more stairs that he climbed. At the top of these stairs they came
into a big room whose roof was high in the middle but slanted
down low towards the sides, so that there were hardly any walls
at all except in one place where the wall was made higher to make
space for a little window.</p>

<p>Dikar stood still, Marilee nestled in his arms, and looked
around him. By the light of another match Martha Dawson held he
saw that the room was full of tables and little benches, and
boxes, and a lot of things Dikar had never seen before, all old-
looking and dirty and piled every which way on top of one
another, right up to the roof. So full was the room that Dikar
couldn't see where he was to put Marilee.</p>

<p>"Wait," the woman said and went past Dikar to a box that stood
on end in the middle of the pile's front, a black box almost as
big as she was. She knocked on this in a funny way.</p>

<p>The box moved&mdash;not the box but the side that was all
Dikar could see of it. The side swung out on one up-and-down
edge, like a door, and inside the box was a tall man with a thin
white face and gray hair. The man was stooped over, and his eyes,
deep-sunk in his face, glittered in the matchlight like the eyes
of animals glitter in the night-blackened woods.</p>

<p>The man saw Dikar. His lips pulled away from his teeth and his
hand came up, and in his hand was a little gun that aimed right
at Dikar.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch8" name="ch8">CHAPTER VIII. SEARCH</a></h2>

<p class="first">"IT'S all right, John," Martha Dawson said.
"They're all right. They escaped from a concentration camp, and
this young man's wife is bad hurt and I've promised to hide her
here with you."</p>

<p>The man John peered past Martha Dawson, looking more closely
at Dikar. "From a camp?" His voice was deep, much deeper than
Dikar thought could come from so thin a chest, and it was a very
tired voice. The woman moved so that the match light from inside
her cupped hand fell on Dikar. "Aye, I see now. I could only see
a black shape in the dark, and I thought that I had been
betrayed, and that they had forced you to show Them where I
was."</p>

<p>"Never!" Martha Dawson cried out, and then. "Who would betray
you, John? Who would tell them you are here?"</p>

<p>John looked at her, and Dikar saw that there were deep lines
in his face, lines of pain, and that his lips were gray. "I've
just had bad news, Martha. They raided zee-seven this morning, so
suddenly there was no chance to blow it up, and they took Ed
Stone alive. But we're keeping our friends standing. Bring her in
here, my friend," he said to Dikar, moving back into his box.
"Bring her in."</p>

<p>John's voice came out of blackness inside the box, but
something in that voice told Dikar he need not be afraid of him,
nor of anything in the blackness, and he went into the box
carrying Marilee. Martha Dawson's match went out, and Dikar
stopped short, the blackness thumbing his eyes.</p>

<p>Martha Dawson pushed against Dikar's back, and he got moving
again, and the other side of the box wasn't there, as he'd
expected, but he went right on into a feel of bigger space. He
heard sound of door-closing behind him, felt a hand on his arm
stopping him, and then there was light.</p>

<p>The light came from a shining thing that hung by a wire over
Dikar's head, and Dikar saw that he'd gone right through the box
into a room hidden behind the pile.</p>

<p>"Lay her there," John said, pointing to a bed that stood
against one side of the room. "It's clean and comfortable, I
assure you."</p>

<p>Dikar put Marilee down on the bed, and Martha Dawson was
beside the bed. Her hand took hold of Marilee's wrist and she
seemed to be listening for something, and then she smiled and
said, "Her pulse is strong." She put her hand on Marilee's
forehead, and said, "She has no fever at all."</p>

<p>Dikar didn't know what the words meant, but he knew that
Martha Dawson meant that Marilee would be all right, and breath
hissed from between his teeth. "Martha," John said. "You'd better
go down and make some hot water to wash her with, and bring it up
with the iodine and bandages. You ought to have light on down
there anyway, or our sweet guardian might start wondering what
you're up to."</p>

<p>Martha (the man called her that, Dikar noticed, instead of the
longer Martha Dawson) looked queerly at John. "Our guardian won't
notice anything," she said. "He's dead. This young man killed
him."</p>

<p>"Ah," John nodded. "That means trouble, of course. Well, we
can only hope and pray as we've done all along. Go on, my
dear."</p>

<p>He moved, and there was darkness again. Dikar heard the
boxdoor open and shut. The light came back, and Dikar was peering
around the room, so much in it strange to him.</p>

<p>There was the bed on which Marilee lay and a little table in
the middle of the room, and a little bench with a back. The wall
of the room in which was the door was covered with things Dikar
vaguely recalled were named "books." The roof slanted down to the
wall opposite this, and this was low except for a narrow space
where it was built higher to make space for a window, but the
window was covered over with a gay-colored, thick rug so that
Dikar couldn't see them.</p>

<p>But it was at the fourth wall at which Dikar stared longest. A
narrow table along the full width of this. Under the table were a
lot of small black boxes, and on top of it was a jumble of wires
and black boards standing up and lying down, and round things
marked with little white lines, and a lot of shining things like
what hung from the ceiling and made light in the room. In the
middle of the wall above the table was something that Dikar
recognized.</p>

<p>It was from a thing like it that the Voice in Dikar's dream
had come, the Voice that had spoken about the dusk that had come
to America, and the tomorrow that might never be. Dikar
remembered the name of this thing, and said it aloud.</p>

<p>"A radio," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes," John said. "And now you know that you're in one of the
stations of the Secret Net." His hands went wide. "The oldest of
them, my friend. Five years I've operated it from here, five long
years since I escaped from a concentration camp and in all the
five years I have not seen the sun. In those five years I have
had from that loud speaker"&mdash;he pointed to the thing on the
wall that Dikar had recognized&mdash;"news of the unearthing of
hundreds of our stations, news of the death of hundreds of our
co-workers. Time and time again that speaker has brought me word
that we were almost ready to rise against the invaders, and time
and time again it has brought me word that they had found our
leaders and hung them, and that all the work was to be done over
again.</p>

<p>"Yes," John said. "This is the oldest of the stations, now
that at last Ed Stone's gone, and I am the luckiest of the agents
of the Secret Net, but tonight, my friend, I somehow have a
feeling that my luck has run out. Perhaps that is only because I
am tired and hungry, for Martha dares not bring me food until
dark. They do not, I know, suspect that I am here, but they know
I am alive, somewhere, and always they keep a sentry, out there
in the woods, watching my wife and waiting for me to contact
her." He smiled, and his smile was bitter. "That is why they have
permitted her so long to live on here, unmolested. But I must
hear your story. I thought that the prison camps were now too
well guarded for anyone to escape from them. How did you and your
wife manage it? What camp do you come from?"</p>

<p>Dikar shook his head. "We come from no camp. I don't even know
what you mean by that word, camp."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you don't&mdash;! You're American, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Dikar said. "We are American." He knew, without just
knowing how, that he could talk to this man freely and that it
was important that he talk to him. "We come from the Mountain,
off there beyond those woods."</p>

<p>And then Dikar went on to tell John about the Bunch, and about
how they came to live on the Mountain, and about their life
there.</p>

<p>John listened without interrupting, except to ask a low-toned
question or two, when Dikar stopped, and soon after Dikar started
talking, Martha came in and listened too, while she tended
Marilee. Dikar told about his dream, and how he had come down
into this Far Land and seen what went on here, and how he had
gone back to the Mountain.</p>

<p>"I knew then that somehow, sometime, I must lead the Bunch
down off the Mountain and try to take back this land for
America," he came near the end of his story. "But I could not
think how we few could do anything against the black and yellow
men when you who are so many could do nothin' against them.
Perhaps you can tell me, John?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can," John said, his eyes shining. "I must think.
But you did come down again to us, Dikar." (Dikar had told them
his name.) "And without any plans. Why did you do that?"</p>

<p>Dikar told him about Tomball, and what Tomball had done, and
how Tomball died.</p>

<p>"There you are," John turned to Martha. "There's the innate
depravity of human nature for you. Here are these youngsters who
were isolated from the world when the oldest of them was only
eight, who grew up together in such an ideal communion as man has
not known since Eden, and yet a renegade turns up among them who
would sacrifice them all because his personal ambitions were
thwarted. Doesn't that make you despair, my dear?"</p>

<p>"No!" Martha answered, her hands still busy with Marilee. "No,
John. Because if Dikar's story has in it one black-souled
renegade, it also has in it forty who have worked for one another
and lived for one another, sweetly and unselfishly, from
childhood to young man&mdash;and womanhood. Because it has in it
courage and loyalty and self-sacrifice and love that was not
taught out of books. Despair, John? No. Dikar's story gives me
new hope, new courage."</p>

<p>John moved to Martha, where she knelt by Marilee's bedside,
and laid his hand on her head. "I'm wrong, Martha. You are wiser
than I. Far wiser&mdash;" Just then Marilee stirred, and her eyes
opened.</p>

<p>"Dikar," she whispered. Then, fright in her voice:
<i>"Dikar!"</i></p>

<p>Dikar leaped to her. "It's all right, Marilee. Everything is
all right. We've found fr&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush," John broke in. "Quiet. Listen." At once the room was
throbbing with silence.</p>

<p>Into that silence, well-muffled, came the sound of men's
voices, shouts. "The patrol's here," John said low-voiced.
"They're looking for the sentry you killed. You'd better get
downstairs quick, Martha. They might come to ask you about
him."</p>

<p>Martha was on her feet, her face set, her hands trembling.
John's arm went around her, and he was holding her close to him.
He was saying something Dikar could not quite make out, and then
they were apart and Martha was going toward the door, straight,
trembling no longer. The light went out, and the door opened and
closed.</p>

<p>"Let's take a look outside," Dikar heard John say, and he
heard him moving in the darkness. Then there was pale light in
the darkness, starlight breaking the blackness of a wall, John's
hand blotching it as it held aside that which hung over the
window.</p>

<p>Dikar darted across the floor and was pressed against John,
looking out.</p>

<p>Just below was the smaller roof Dikar had seen from the woods,
and below that, yellow light lay on the ground. Down at the
bottom of the hill, bright lights danced in the yellow grass and
on the brush and trees at the edge of the woods. Black against
these lights were the forms of men, and it was from these men
that the shouting came.</p>

<p>"Look," John whispered, "there in the wheat." Dikar saw the
black shape of his finger pointing, and looked in the direction
the finger pointed.</p>

<p>Where the finger pointed, in the middle of the field, was one
man who did not move. The arm held a light, and the light was on
his face, and Dikar could see that the face was round and yellow.
The mouth of that face was a straight, thin line and the eyes
were slanted slits in the yellow skin, and there was a look on
the face that made Dikar afraid.</p>

<p>"That's Captain Li Logo," John said. "He's provost for this
district. He's shrewd as a fox and cruel as a tiger. It's hard
luck that he had to come along with the patrol, on this night of
all nights."</p>

<p>Dikar felt Marilee press against him from behind. "Go back to
bed, sweet," he said. "You'll hurt yourself more."</p>

<p>"I'm all right, Dikar," Marilee whispered. "I feel fine. And I
want to see too."</p>

<p>A louder shout came through the window. "They found the body,"
John said quietly but, pressed against him, Dikar could feel that
now he was trembling.</p>

<p>The lights moved together, clustering at one place just at the
edge of the woods. Captain Logo went down to where the lights
clustered, and the babble of shouts from there stopped, and all
Dikar could hear was a single high-pitched voice.</p>

<p>"I'll open the window," John said, "if you'll let me get at
it." Dikar and Marilee moved back a little.</p>

<p>"Are you sure you're feelin' all right?" Dikar whispered under
cover of a scraping noise in front of them.</p>

<p>"Sure. The woman gave me something to drink, before I quite
woke up, and it's made me all warm inside, and strong again."</p>

<p>Cold wind came in on them, and the sounds from outside were
louder, the sound of that single high-pitched voice, but Dikar
could not understand what it said. Then there was another shout,
hoarse like Jubal's, and a light showed within the edge of the
woods, and Captain Logo went in there.</p>

<p>"They've found Tomball," Dikar said. "We'll soon know if we've
fooled them."</p>

<p>Logo's high voice stopped the shouting again. The other shapes
were separating. They were running back and forth in what John
had called wheat, their lights shining on the yellow grass, and
on their black faces. They were all dressed in green, like Jubal,
and had queer round things on their heads, and they all had long
guns like Jubal's.</p>

<p>"There are seven of them," Marilee said. "I counted."</p>

<p>One of the lights stopped, suddenly, and the one that carried
it bent low, and straightened again, and as a shout came from him
Dikar saw what the light shone on.</p>

<p>"Jeeze!" he grunted. "It's my bow. I forgot all about it.
There was one by Tomball, so now they know there was at least one
more of us."</p>

<p>Captain Logo came to the black who had found Dikar's bow, and
he looked at it, and then he put his hand to his mouth, and there
was shrill sound from him. The blacks all came running to him,
and clustered about him a minute, and then they were all running
up the hill toward the house, their long guns in their hands,
slanted across the front of them, their lights out.</p>

<p>"That's torn it," John said, low-toned. "They're coming to
search the house, and they're certain to find this hideout. My
premonition was right. My luck has run out. Well," he said,
pushing back from the window. "There's only one thing left to
do."</p>

<p>"What?" Dikar asked.</p>

<p>"To let them get inside," came the answer in John's tired
voice, "and then push a button on this radio table, a button that
will blow the house and everyone in it to pieces. If you kids are
afraid to die, you can get out by this window and surrender, but
I wouldn't advise it. No," he sighed. "I would not advise you to
surrender to them."</p>

<p>"Wait," Dikar said. "Maybe&mdash;" He was still looking out
and down. They had reached the house, and had stopped in front of
it, and Li Logo was saying something to the black men he bossed,
was waving his arms around. "Maybe something will happen to save
us yet. Maybe they'll go away without searching the house."</p>

<p>"Not Logo," John answered. "Not when he's on the scent of
something. But I'll wait as long as I dare."</p>

<p>Down below, the black men were separating. One moved a little
away from the house and stood in the field, his gun in his two
hands, looking watchfully around him. Two went one way, one
another, and disappeared around the corners of the house.</p>

<p>"They're going to watch," Marilee whispered, "on all sides to
see that nobody gets away."</p>

<p>An owl hooted, somewhere in the dark. The three blacks left
went with Logo under the little roof that stuck out from the
front of the house, and there was the sound of knocking from down
there. The sound of knocking was in the room! Dikar whirled
around.</p>

<p>"It's all right," John said. "I've just turned on the speaker
system&mdash;something that lets me hear everything that happens
downstairs&mdash;" He checked as another voice came into the
room. It was Martha's voice.</p>

<p>"What shall I do, John?" she asked, very quietly.</p>

<p>"Let them in, dear, as we always planned," John answered her,
just as quietly. "And&mdash;Martha. I'll meet you&mdash;on the
Other Side."</p>

<p>"On the Other Side, John dear," Martha's voice came through
the knocking.</p>

<p>There was the sound of footsteps going across the floor. There
was a rattle, and the sound of knocking stopped, and Dikar heard
a door open.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Missee Dawson," he heard Captain Logo's voice,
very gentle, very smooth. "So sorry I must bother you, but I wish
to come in with my men. You have no objections, of course."</p>

<p>"Of course I have objections, but they won't do me any good,
will they?"</p>

<p>"Sorry, no. So very sorry." Feet trampled, many feet. Then,
"Well, Missee Dawson. Where is he?"</p>

<p>"'He'? I don't understand."</p>

<p>"You understand quite well. One of my men was murdered, down
there in your field, some time today. He got one of the
assassins, but there was another. That other is your husband,
come home at last. I want him."</p>

<p>"Go ahead and look for him, if you think he's here. Search the
house."</p>

<p>"I do not wish to bother. You will call him to surrender."</p>

<p>"I will not."</p>

<p>"I think you will, Missee Dawson," and then there was a scream
in Dikar's ears, a scream loud and shrill and very dreadful. "So
sorry," Captain Logo hissed. "So very sorry."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch9" name="ch9">CHAPTER IX. TOMORROW WILL COME</a></h2>

<p class="first">DIKAR heard that from the sill of the window on
which he was crouched Marilee's hand was pulling John's hand away
from the button on the radio table. "Shut the talkin' thing off."
Dikar heard her whisper, as he'd told her to, and while she was
telling John the rest of what Dikar had told her to, Dikar
dropped to the little roof below. He crouched out there, looking
down to where, quite suddenly, quite silently, the black who
watched the front of the house had crumpled into the wheat.</p>

<p><i>"Hooo&mdash;"</i> the hoot of an owl came from his lips,
and <i>"Hoooo&mdash;"</i> came an answer from near the still,
black heap in the wheat. What little sound Dikar made jumping
from the roof to the ground was covered by Martha's screams
inside the house. The yellow light from the house's windows
glimmered on the naked brown skin of Henfield, lifting up out of
the wheat to meet Dikar.</p>

<p>"There were four outside," Dikar whispered.</p>

<p>"We got 'em all," the answer came. "I took two an' Bengreen
an' Danhall each took one." Two other shadowy forms rose out of
the wheat beside them. "What next, Dikar?"</p>

<p>Dikar hooted twice, then whispered his plan. "Give me your
bonarrer, Danhall," he finished. "I'm a better shot than you." He
took them, turned to the open door of the house, where Martha's
screams had stopped.</p>

<p>The door was wide and Dikar could see everybody in the room
inside. One of the blacks had hold of Martha. The top part of her
clothes were torn and a knife in Li Logo's hand was red-tipped,
and now Martha's flesh was bleeding, but Martha and Logo and the
blacks were looking at the stairs that came down out of the roof
of the room, at the gray-haired man who stood halfway down the
stairs, hands behind his back, tall and straight and proud.</p>

<p>One of the blacks held Martha and the other two pointed their
long guns at John, but it was Logo who spoke to John, what he
said coming clear and distinct to Dikar. "Ah, John Dawson,"
Captain Logo said in that soft, thin voice of his. "I thought
your wife's screams would bring you out of your hole."</p>

<p>Once more Dikar hooted, and in the same instant he loosed the
arrow, and the twang of his bow was joined by the twang of two
other bows in his ears. Inside the house the three blacks
crumpled to the floor, an arrow in each of their backs, and
John's hand came out from behind his back and the little gun in
it flashed fire, and Captain Li Logo was down on top of one of
his blacks, but his head was lifted, his eyes looking hate at
John.</p>

<p>"So sorry," John Dawson said. "So very sorry, Captain Li
Logo," and his little gun flashed fire again, and Li Logo's head
fell down, and he was as dead as the men he had bossed for the
last time.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">THE cool, green-smelling dark of the woods
closed around the five from the Mountain, and around John Dawson
and Martha. The Bunch would have wondered, could they have seen,
what strange, heavy loads they were that the Boys and John
carried, and they would have wondered at the light without fire
that came to life in the hand of Marilee as she followed behind
Martha and the men, smoothing out such signs of their passage
through the woods as she could.</p>

<p>"Eight rifles, nine revolvers, and all the stuff necessary to
rebuild my wireless," John chuckled. "Quite a beginning for what
we'll need to bring <i>tomorrow</i> to America, as you put it.
But you did a good job with your bows and arrows, you four."</p>

<p>The pallid, gaunt man seemed now to have found a new vitality;
he walked with the step of a young man, and the memory of horror
no longer lived in his eyes.</p>

<p>"We did only our best," Dikar muttered, looking back uneasily.
"Martha said their blacks are good trackers. Is that right,
John?"</p>

<p>Thunder blotted out the start of John Dawson's answer, a great
clap of thunder from where they'd just come, and back there the
sky was lit with red light. And then the sky was black again, and
the thunder had ended, and John was chuckling.</p>

<p>"Yes. Dikar," he said. "Their blacks are good trackers, but I
doubt very much that they will be tracking us. Now you know why I
had you carry all the corpses into the house. It was already
mined, as you know, and I set a time-fuse before we left, and all
that anyone will ever find back there will be a big, charred hole
in the ground and a mass of fragments too small to be identified.
It isn't the first station of the Secret Net that has been blown
up during a raid, and not the first in which everyone, prisoners
and raiders, have perished. That is what they will think happened
there, and they will not bother to look for Martha and me, nor
will they ever know you and your friends were there."</p>

<p>"Ah," Dikar said, and felt eased. There was yet a long way to
go to the Mountain, and there was still all these people and all
these things to be gotten to the top of the Drop, and the load on
his shoulders was heavy, but when he thought of what they would
do with the load, of all the plans John and he would make, the
load and his heart were light as the feathers of a bird.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">THE sun struck brightness through Dikar's
eyelids and woke him, and though the night had held very little
sleep, he was instantly awake. He flung out his arm to waken
Marilee found nothingness&mdash;remembered that he had given his
place in the bed in his little house to Martha Dawson, was back
again, for this night, in the Boys' House.</p>

<p>Dikar leaped from his cot, and all around him the flashing
brown bodies of the Boys of the Bunch leaped from theirs, and
there were shouts of welcome to him, but Dikar ran out of the
house and through the woods toward his little house, and Marilee.
He went quietly when he neared the little house, and stood in the
doorway peering in, and then his heart bumped his ribs as he saw
that only Martha was inside on the bed.</p>

<p>"Where's Marilee?" Dikar demanded. "Where's my Marilee?"</p>

<p>Martha smiled at him. "Come in," she said. "Come in, son, I
want to give you a little piece of advice."</p>

<p>Dikar went in, wondering, and squatted on the floor by the
bed. Martha's fleshless hand reached out and took his, and she
said, very softly, "Listen son. Don't bother your Marilee
mornings. And be very gentle with her, very tender."</p>

<p>"I am," he said. "I try always to be."</p>

<p>"I know," Martha answered. "But try harder now. Don't mind it
if she is irritable with you, and unreasonable, and angry over
trifles."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Dikar cried. "What are you talkin'
about?"</p>

<p>He had drawn taut now, staring at her and fear had come
suddenly into his eyes.</p>

<p>"Go ask her," Martha said. "She is the one to tell you what I
mean, though I had to tell her, myself, this morning. You
children," she said, and there was a wetness in her eyes. "You
precious infants. Go, Dikar, I hear her outside."</p>

<p>Dikar rose and he went out again, and Marilee was coming
toward him out of the bushes, and her face was greenish as it had
been the morning before, but her eyes were shining. "Dikar!" she
cried, lifting her arms wide to him, and Dikar ran to her. "Oh,
Dikar. I have something to tell you."</p>

<p>And then Dikar was holding Marilee close, close to him, and
she was whispering something in his ears, and his heart leaped
within him and in his veins his blood ran laughing and glad as
the streams that laugh down the Mountain.</p>

<p>But after a while Dikar sobered, and his face was grave, his
voice solemn. "Now indeed, Marilee," Dikar said, "I must work
hard for the day when I shall lead the Bunch down from the
Mountain to an America retaken for freedom and liberty. For you
an' I, Marilee, were the children of a dark yesterday, but ours
must be the child of a bright an' shinin' tomorrow."</p>
