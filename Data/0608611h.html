<h2><a id="gent1" name="gent1">1. STRIPED SHIRTS AND BUSTED
HEARTS</a>
</h2>

<p style="text-indent:0">IF Joel Braxton hadn't drawed a knife
whilst I was beating his head agen a spruce log, I reckon I
wouldn't of had that quarrel with Glory McGraw, and things might of
turned out different to what they did. Pap's always said the
Braxtons was no-account folks, and I allow he's right. First thing
I knowed Jim Garfield hollered: "Look out, Breck, the yaller
hound's got a knife!" Then I felt a kind of sting and looked down
and seen Joel had cut a big gash in my buckskin shirt and scratched
my hide trying to get at my innards.</p>

<p>I let go of his ears and taken the knife away from him and
throwed it into a blackjack thicket, and throwed him after it. They
warn't no use in him belly-aching like he done just because they
happened to be a tree in his way. I dunno how he expects to get
throwed into a blackjack thicket without getting some hide knocked
off.</p>

<p>But I am a good-natured man, and I was a easy-going youngster,
even then. I paid no heed to Joel's bloodthirsty threats whilst his
brother and Jim Garfield and the others was pulling him out of the
bresh and dousing him in the creek to wash the blood off. I got
onto my mule Alexander and headed for Old Man McGraw's cabin where
I was started to when I let myself be beguiled into stopping with
them idjits.</p>

<p>The McGraws is the only folks on Bear Creek besides the
Reynoldses and the Braxtons which ain't no kin to me one way or
another, and I'd been sweet on Glory McGraw ever since I was big
enough to wear britches. She was the tallest, finest, purtiest gal
in the Humbolt Mountains, which is covering considerable territory.
They warn't a gal on Bear Creek, not even my own sisters, which
could swing a axe like her, or fry a b'ar steak as tasty, or make
hominy as good, and they warn't nobody, man nor woman, which could
outrun her, less'n it was me.</p>

<p>As I come up the trail that led up to the McGraw cabin, I seen
her, just scooping a pail of water out of the creek. The cabin was
just out of sight on the other side of a clump of alders. She
turned around and seen me, and stood there with the pail dripping
in her hand, and her sleeves rolled up, and her arms and throat and
bare feet was as white as anything you ever seen, and her eyes was
the same color as the sky, and her hair looked like gold dust when
the sun hit it.</p>

<p>I taken off my coonskin cap, and said: "Good mornin', Glory,
how're you-all this mornin'?"</p>

<p>"Joe got kicked right severe by pap's sorrel mare yesterday,"
she says. "Just knocked some hide off, though. Outside of that
we're all doin' fine. Air you glued to that mule?"</p>

<p>"No'm," I says, and clumb down, and says: "Lemme tote yore pail,
Glory."</p>

<p>She started to hand it to me, and then she frowned and p'inted
at my shirt, and says: "You been fightin' agen."</p>

<p>"Nobody but Joel Braxton," I said. "'Twarn't nothin'. He said
moskeeters in the Injun Territory was bigger'n what they be in
Texas."</p>

<p>"What you know about it?" says she. "You ain't never been to
Texas."</p>

<p>"Well, he ain't never been to the Injun Territory neither," I
said. "'Taint the moskeeters. It's the principle of the thing. My
folks all come from Texas, and no Braxton can slander the State
around me."</p>

<p>"You fight too much," she said. "Who licked?"</p>

<p>"Why, me, of course," I said. "I always do, don't I?"</p>

<p>This harmless statement seemed to irritate her.</p>

<p>"I reckon you think nobody on Bear Creek can lick you," she
sneered.</p>

<p>"Well," I says truthfully, "nobody ain't, up to
now&mdash;outside of pap."</p>

<p>"You ain't never fit none of my brothers," she snapped.</p>

<p>"That's why," I said. "I've took quite a lot of sass offa them
ganglin' mavericks jest because they was yore brothers and I didn't
want to hurt 'em."</p>

<p>Gals is funny about some things. She got mad and jerked the pail
out of my hand, and says: "Oh, is that so? Well, lemme tell you
right now, Breckinridge Elkins, the littlest one of my brothers can
lick you like a balky hoss, and if you ever lay a finger on one of
'em, I'll fix you! And furthermore and besides, they's a gent up to
the cabin right now which could pull his shootin' iron and decorate
yore whole carcass with lead polka-dots whilst you was fumblin' for
yore old cap-and-ball pistol!"</p>

<p>"I don't claim to be no gunfighter," I says mildly. "But I bet
he cain't sling iron fast as my cousin Jack Gordon."</p>

<p>"You and yore cousins!" says she plenty scornful. "This feller
is sech a gent as you never drempt existed! He's a cowpuncher from
the Wild River Country, and he's ridin' through to Chawed Ear and
he stopped at our cabin for dinner. If you could see him, you
wouldn't never brag no more. You with that old mule and them
moccasins and buckskin clothes!"</p>

<p>"Well, gosh, Glory!" I says plumb bewildered. "What's the matter
with buckskin? I like it better'n homespun."</p>

<p>"Hah!" sneered she. "You oughta see Mr. Snake River Wilkinson!
He ain't wearin' neither buckskins nor homespun. Store-bought
clothes! I never seen such elegance. Star top boots, and
gold-mounted spurs! And a red neckcloth&mdash;he said silk. I
dunno. I never seen nothin' like it before. And a shirt all red and
green and yaller and beautiful! And a white Stetson hat! And a
pearl- handled six-shooter! And the finest hoss and riggin's
<i>you</i> ever seen, you big dummox!"</p>

<p>"Aw, well, gosh!" I said, getting irritated. "If this here
Mister Wilkinson is so blame gorgeous, whyn't you marry him?"</p>

<p>I ought not to said it. Her eyes flashed blue sparks.</p>

<p>"I will!" she gritted. "You think a fine gentleman like him
wouldn't marry me, hey? I'll show you! I'll marry him right
now!"</p>

<p>And impulsively shattering her water bucket over my head she
turned and run up the trail.</p>

<p>"Glory, wait!" I hollered, but by the time I got the water out
of my eyes and the oak splinters out of my hair she was gone.</p>

<p>Alexander was gone too. He taken off down the creek when Glory
started yelling at me, because he was a smart mule in his dumb way,
and could tell when thunder-showers was brewing. I run him for a
mile before I caught him, and then I got onto him and headed for
the McGraw cabin agen. Glory was mad enough to do anything she
thought would worry me, and they warn't nothing would worry me
more'n for her to marry some dern cowpuncher from the river
country. She was plumb wrong when she thought I thought he wouldn't
have her. Any man which would pass up a chance to get hitched with
Glory McGraw would be a dern fool, I don't care what color his
shirt was.</p>

<p>My heart sunk into my moccasins as I approached the alder clump
where we'd had our row. I figgered she'd stretched things a little
talking about Mr. Wilkinson's elegance, because whoever heard of a
shirt with three colors into it, or gold-mounted spurs? Still, he
was bound to be rich and wonderful from what she said, and what
chance did I have? All the clothes I had was what I had on, and I
hadn't never even seen a store-bought shirt, much less owned one. I
didn't know whether to fall down in the trail and have a good bawl,
or go get my rifle-gun and lay for Mr. Wilkinson.</p>

<p>Then, jest as I got back to where I'd saw Glory last, here she
come again, running like a scairt deer, with her eyes all wide and
her mouth open.</p>

<p>"Breckinridge!" she panted. "Oh, Breckinridge! I've played hell
now!"</p>

<p>"What you mean?" I said.</p>

<p>"Well," says she, "that there cowpuncher Mister Wilkinson had
been castin' eyes at me ever since he arriv at our cabin, but I
hadn't give him no encouragement. But you made me so mad awhile
ago, I went back to the cabin, and I marched right up to him, and I
says: 'Mister Wilkinson, did you ever think about gittin' married?'
He grabbed me by the hand and he says, says he: 'Gal, I been
thinkin' about it ever since I seen you choppin' wood outside the
cabin as I rode by. Fact is, that's why I stopped here.' I was so
plumb flabbergasted I didn't know what to say, and the first thing
I knowed, him and pap was makin' arrangements for the weddin'!"</p>

<p>"Aw, gosh!" I said.</p>

<p>She started wringing her hands.</p>

<p>"I don't want to marry Mister Wilkinson!" she hollered. "I don't
love him! He turnt my head with his elegant manners and striped
shirt! What'll I do? Pap's sot on me marryin' the feller!"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll put a stop to that," I says. "No dem cowcountry dude
can come into the Humbolts and steal my gal. Air they all up to the
cabin now?"</p>

<p>"They're arguin' about the weddin' gift," says Glory. "Pap
thinks Mister Wilkinson oughta give him a hundred dollars. Mister
Wilkinson offered him his Winchester instead of the cash. Be
keerful, Breckinridge! Pap don't like you much, and Mister
Wilkinson has got a awful mean eye, and his scabbard-end tied to
his laig."</p>

<p>"I'll be plumb diplomatic," I promised, and got onto my mule
Alexander and reched down and lifted Glory on behind me, and we
rode up the path till we come to within maybe a hundred foot of the
cabin door. I seen a fine white hoss tied in front of the cabin,
and the saddle and bridle was the most elegant I ever seen. The
silverwork shone when the sun hit it. We got off and I tied
Alexander, and Glory hid behind a white oak. She warn't scairt of
nobody but her old man, but he shore had her number.</p>

<p>"Be keerful, Breckinridge," she begged. "Don't make pap or
Mister Wilkinson mad. Be tactful and meek."</p>

<p>So I said I would, and went up to the door. I could hear Miz
McGraw and the other gals cooking dinner in the back room, and I
could hear Old Man McGraw talking loud in the front room.</p>

<p>"'Taint enough!" says he. "I oughta have the Winchester and ten
dollars. I tell you, Wilkinson, it's cheap enough for a gal like
Glory! It plumb busts my heart strings to let her go, and nothin'
but greenbacks is goin' to soothe the sting!"</p>

<p>"The Winchester and five bucks," says a hard voice which I
reckoned was Mister Wilkinson. "It's a prime gun, I tell you. Ain't
another'n like it in these mountains."</p>

<p>"Well," begun Old Man McGraw in a covetous voice, and jest then
I come in through the door, ducking my head to keep from knocking
it agen the lintel-log.</p>

<p>Old Man McGraw was setting there, tugging at his black beard,
and them long gangling boys of his'n, Joe and Bill and John, was
there gawking as usual, and there on a bench nigh the empty
fireplace sot Mister Wilkinson in all his glory. I batted my eyes.
I never seen such splendor in all my born days. Glory had told the
truth about everything: the white Stetson with the fancy leather
band, and the boots and gold-mounted spurs, and the shirt. The
shirt nigh knocked my eyes out. I hadn't never dreamed nothing
could be so beautiful&mdash;all big broad stripes of red and yaller
and green! I seen his gun, too, a pearl-handled Colt .45 in a black
leather scabbard which was wore plumb smooth and the end tied down
to his laig with a rawhide thong. I could tell he hadn't never wore
a glove on his right hand, neither, by the brownness of it. He had
the hardest, blackest eyes I ever seen. They looked right through
me.</p>

<p>I was very embarrassed, being quite young then, but I pulled
myself together and says very polite: "Howdy, Mister McGraw."</p>

<p>"Who's this young grizzly?" demanded Mister Wilkinson
suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Git out of here, Elkins," requested Old Man McGraw angrily.
"We're talkin' over private business. You git!"</p>

<p>"I know what kind of business you-all are talkin' over," I
retorted, getting irritated. But I remembered Glory said be
diplomatic, so I said: "I come here to tell you the weddin's off!
Glory ain't goin' to marry Mister Wilkinson. She's goin' to marry
me, and anybody which comes between us had better be able to rassle
cougars and whup grizzlies bare-handed!"</p>

<p>"Why, you&mdash;" begun Mister Wilkinson in a blood-thirsty
voice, as he riz onto his feet like a painter fixing to go into
action.</p>

<p>"Git outa here!" bellered Old Man McGraw jumping up and grabbing
the iron poker. "What I does with my datter ain't none of yore
business! Mister Wilkinson here is makin' me a present of his prime
Winchester and five dollars in hard money! What could <i>you</i>
offer me, you mountain of beef and ignorance?"</p>

<p>"A bust in the snoot, you old tightwad," I replied heatedly, but
still remembering to be diplomatic. They warn't no use in offending
him, and I was determined to talk quiet and tranquil, in spite of
his insults. So I said: "A man which would sell his datter for five
dollars and a gun ought to be et alive by the buzzards! You try to
marry Glory to Mister Wilkinson and see what happens to you, sudden
and onpleasant!"</p>

<p>"Why, you&mdash;!" says Old Man McGraw, swinging up his poker.
"I'll bust yore fool skull like a egg!"</p>

<p>"Lemme handle him," snarled Mister Wilkinson. "Git outa the way
and gimme a clean shot at him. Lissen here, you jack-eared
mountain-mule, air you goin' out of here perpendicular, or does you
prefer to go horizontal?"</p>

<p>"Open the ball whenever you feels lucky, you stripe-bellied
polecat!" I retorted courteously, and he give a snarl and went for
his gun, but I got mine out first and shot it out of his hand along
with one of his fingers before he could pull his trigger.</p>

<p>He give a howl and staggered back agen the wall, glaring wildly
at me, and at the blood dripping off his hand, and I stuck my old
cap-and-ball .44 back in the scabbard and said: "You may be
accounted a fast gunslinger down in the low country, but yo're
tolerable slow on the draw to be foolin' around Bear Creek. You
better go on home now, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was at this moment that Old Man McGraw hit me over the head
with his poker. He swung it with both hands as hard as he could,
and if I hadn't had on my coonskin cap I bet it would have skint my
head some. As it was it knocked me to my knees, me being off-guard
that way, and his three boys run in and started beating me with
chairs and benches and a table laig. Well, I didn't want to hurt
none of Glory's kin, but I had bit my tongue when the old man hit
me with his poker, and that always did irritate me. Anyway, I seen
they warn't no use arguing with them fool boys. They was out for
blood&mdash;mine, to be exact.</p>

<p>So I riz up and taken Joe by the neck and crotch and throwed him
through a winder as gentle as I could, but I forgot about the
hickory-wood bars which was nailed acrost it to keep the bears out.
He took 'em along with him, and that was how he got skint up like
he did. I heard Glory let out a scream outside, and would have
hollered out to let her know I was all right and for her not to
worry about me, but just as I opened my mouth to do it, John jammed
the butt-end of a table laig into it.</p>

<p>Sech treatment would try the patience of a saint, still and all
I didn't really intend to hit John as hard as I did. How was I to
know a tap like I give him would knock him through the door and
dislocate his jawbone?</p>

<p>Old Man McGraw was dancing around trying to get another whack at
me with his bent poker without hitting Bill which was hammering me
over the head with a chair, but Mister Wilkinson warn't taking no
part in the fray. He was backed up agen a wall with a wild look on
his face. I reckon he warn't used to Bear Creek squabbles.</p>

<p>I taken the chair away from Bill and busted it over his head
jest to kinda cool him off a little, and jest then Old Man McGraw
made another swipe at me with his poker, but I ducked and grabbed
him, and Bill stooped over to pick up a bowie knife which had fell
out of somebody's boot. His back was towards me so I planted my
moccasin in the seat of his britches with considerable force and he
shot head-first through the door with a despairing howl. Somebody
else screamed too, that sounded like Glory. I didn't know at the
time that she was running up to the door and was knocked down by
Bill as he catapulted into the yard.</p>

<p>I couldn't see what was going on outside, and Old Man McGraw was
chawing my thumb and feeling for my eye, so I throwed him after
John and Bill, and he's a liar when he said I aimed him at that
rain-barrel a-purpose. I didn't even know they was one there till I
heard the crash as his head went through the staves.</p>

<p>I turned around to have some more words with Mister Wilkinson,
but he jumped through the winder I'd throwed Joe through, and when
I tried to foller him, I couldn't get my shoulders through. So I
run out at the door and Glory met me just as I hit the yard and she
give me a slap in the face that sounded like a beaver hitting a mud
bank with his tail.</p>

<p>"Why, Glory!" I says, dumbfounded, because her blue eyes was
blazing, and her yaller hair was nigh standing on end. She was so
mad she was crying and that's the first time I ever knowed she
<i>could</i> cry. "What's the matter? What've <i>I</i> did?"</p>

<p>"What have you did?" she raged, doing a kind of a war-dance on
her bare feet. "You outlaw! You murderer! You jack-eared son of a
spotted tail skunk! Look what you done!" She p'inted at her old man
dazedly pulling his head out of the rooins of the rain-barrel, and
her brothers laying around the yard in various positions, bleeding
freely and groaning loudly. "You tried to murder my family!" says
she, shaking her fists under my nose. "You throwed Bill onto me on
purpose!"</p>

<p>"I didn't neither!" I exclaimed, shocked and scandalized. "You
know I wouldn't hurt a hair of yore head, Glory! Why, all I done, I
done it for you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You didn't have to mutilate my pap and my brothers!" she wept
furiously. Ain't that just like a gal? What could I done but what I
did? She hollered: "If you really loved me you wouldn't of hurt
'em! You jest done it for meanness! I told you to be ca'm and
gentle! Whyn't you do it? Shet up! Don't talk to me! Well, whyn't
you say somethin'? Ain't you got no tongue?"</p>

<p>"I handled 'em easy as I could!" I roared, badgered beyond
endurance. "It warn't my fault. If they'd had any sense, they
wouldn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't you dare slander my folks!" she yelped. "What you done to
Mister Wilkinson?"</p>

<p>The aforesaid gent jest then come limping around the corner of
the cabin, and started for his hoss, and Glory run to him and
grabbed his arm, and said: "If you still want to marry me,
stranger, it's a go! I'll ride off with you right now!"</p>

<p>He looked at me and shuddered, and jerked his arm away.</p>

<p>"Do I look like a dern fool?" he inquired with some heat. "I
advises you to marry that young grizzly there, for the sake of
public safety, if nothin' else! Marry you when <i>he</i> wants you?
No, thank you! I'm leavin' a valuable finger as a sooverneer of my
sojourn, but I figger it's a cheap price! After watchin' that human
tornado in action, I calculate a finger ain't nothin' to bother
about! <i>Adios!</i> If I ever come within a hundred miles of Bear
Creek again it'll be because I've gone plumb loco!"</p>

<p>And with that he forked his critter and took off up the trail
like the devil was after him.</p>

<p>"Now look what you done!" wept Glory. "Now he won't never marry
me!"</p>

<p>"But I thought you didn't want to marry him!" I says, plumb
bewildered.</p>

<p>She turned on me like a catamount.</p>

<p>"I didn't!" she shrieked. "I wouldn't marry him if he was the
last man on earth! But I demands the right to say yes or no for
myself! I don't aim to be bossed around by no hillbilly on a mangy
mule!"</p>

<p>"Alexander ain't mangy," I said. "Besides, I warn't, tryin' to
boss you around, Glory. I war just fixin' it so yore pap wouldn't
make you marry Mister Wilkinson. Bein' as we aims to marry
ourselves&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who said we aimed to?" she hollered. "Me marry you, after you
beat up my pap and my brothers like you done? You think yo're the
best man on Bear Creek! Ha! You with yore buckskin britches and old
cap-and-ball pistol and coonskin cap! Me marry you? Git on yore
mangy mule and git before I takes a shotgun to you!"</p>

<p>"All right!" I roared, getting mad at last. "All right, if
that's the way you want to ack! You ain't the only gal in these
mountains! They's plenty of gals which would be glad to have me
callin' on 'em."</p>

<p>"Who, for a instance?" she sneered.</p>

<p>"Ellen Reynolds, for instance!" I bellered. "That's who!"</p>

<p>"All right!" says she, trembling with rage. "Go and spark that
stuck-up hussy on yore mangy mule with yore old moccasins and
cap-and-ball gun! See if I care!"</p>

<p>"I aim to!" I assured her bitterly. "And I won't be on no mule,
neither. I'll be on the best hoss in the Humbolts, and I'll have me
some boots onto my feet, and a silver mounted saddle and bridle,
and a pistol that shoots store- bought ca'tridges, too! You wait
and see!"</p>

<p>"Where you think you'll git 'em?" she sneered.</p>

<p>"Well, I will!" I bellered, seeing red. "You said I thought I
was the best man on Bear Creek! Well, by golly, I am, and I aim to
prove it! I'm glad you gimme the gate! If you hadn't I'd of married
you and settled down in a cabin up the creek somewheres and never
done nothin' nor seen nothin' nor been nothin' but yore husband!
Now I'm goin' to plumb bust this State wide open from one end to
the other'n, and folks is goin' to know about me all over
everywheres!"</p>

<p>"Heh! heh! heh!" she laughed bitterly.</p>

<p>"I'll show you!" I promised her wrathfully, as I forked my mule,
and headed down the trail with her laughter ringing in my ears. I
kicked Alexander most vicious in the ribs, and he give a bray of
astonishment and lit a shuck for home. A instant later the alder
clump hid the McGraw cabin from view and Glory McGraw and my
boyhood dreams was out of sight behind me.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="gent2" name="gent2">2. MOUNTAIN MAN</a>
</h2>

<p style="text-indent:0">"I'LL show her!" I promised the world at
large, as I rode through the bresh as hard as Alexander could run.
"I'll go out into the world and make a name for myself, by golly!
She'll see. Whoa, Alexander!"</p>

<p>Because I'd jest seen a bee-tree I'd located the day before. My
busted heart needed something to soothe it, and I figgered fame and
fortune could wait a little whilst I drowned my woes in honey.</p>

<p>I was up to my ears in this beverage when I heard my old man
calling: "Breckinridge! Oh, Breckinridge! Whar air you? I see you
now. You don't need to climb that tree. I ain't goin' to larrup
you."</p>

<p>He come up and said: "Breckinridge, ain't that a bee settin'
onto yore ear?"</p>

<p>I reched up, and sure enough, it was. Come to think about it, I
had felt kind of like something was stinging me somewheres.</p>

<p>"I swan, Breckinridge," says pap, "I never seen a hide like
yore'n not even amongst the Elkinses. Lissen to me now: old Buffalo
Rogers jest come through on his way back from Tomahawk, and the
postmaster there said they was a letter for me, from Mississippi.
He wouldn't give it to nobody but me or some of my folks. I dunno
who'd be writin' me from Mississippi; last time I was there was
when I was fightin' the Yankees. But anyway, that letter is got to
be got. Me and yore maw have decided yo're to go git it."</p>

<p>"Clean to Tomahawk?" I said. "Gee whiz, Pap!"</p>

<p>"Well," he says, combing his beard with his fingers, "yo're
growed in size, if not in years. It's time you seen somethin' of
the world. You ain't never been more'n thirty miles away from the
cabin you was born in. Yore brother Garfield ain't able to go on
account of that b'ar he tangled with, and Buckner is busy skinnin'
the b'ar. You been to whar the trail goin' to Tomahawk passes. All
you got to do is foller it and turn to the right whar it forks. The
left goes on to Perdition."</p>

<p>"Great!" I says. "This is whar I begins to see the world!" And I
added to myself: "This is whar I begins to show Glory McGraw I'm a
man of importance, by golly!"</p>

<p class="cpb">* * *</p>

<p>Well, next morning before good daylight I was off, riding my
mule Alexander, with a dollar pap gimme stuck in the bottom of my
pistol scabbard. Pap rode with me a few miles and give me
advice.</p>

<p>"Be keerful how you spend that dollar I give you," he said.
"Don't gamble. Drink in reason. Half a gallon of corn juice is
enough for any man. Don't be techy&mdash;but don't forgit that yore
pap was once the rough-and- tumble champeen of Gonzales County,
Texas. And whilst yo're feelin' for the other feller's eye, don't
be keerless and let him chaw yore ear off. And don't resist no
officer."</p>

<p>"What's them, Pap?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Down in the settlements," he explained, "they has men which
their job is to keep the peace. I don't take no stock in law
myself, but them city folks is different from us. You do what they
says, and if they says give up yore gun, even, why you up and do
it!"</p>

<p>I was shocked, and meditated a while, and then says: "How can I
tell which is them?"</p>

<p>"They'll have a silver star stuck onto their shirt," he says, so
I said I'd do like he told me. He then reined around and went back
up the mountains, and I rode on down the path.</p>

<p>Well, I camped late that night where the path come out onto the
Tomahawk trail, and the next morning I rode on down the trail,
feeling like I was a long way from home. It was purty hot, and I
hadn't went far till I passed a stream and decided I'd take a swim.
So I tied Alexander to a cottonwood, and hung my buckskins close
by, but I taken my gun belt with my cap-and-ball .44 and hung it on
a willer limb reching out over the water. They was thick bushes all
around the stream.</p>

<p>Well, I div deep, and as I come up, I had a feeling like
somebody had hit me over the head with a club. I looked up, and
there was a Injun holding on to a limb with one hand and leaning
out over the water with a club in the other hand.</p>

<p>He yelled and swung at me again, but I div, and he missed, and I
come up right under the limb where my gun was hung. I reched up and
grabbed it and let <i>bam</i> at him just as he dived into the
bushes, and he let out a squall and grabbed the seat of his pants.
Next minute I heard a horse running, and glimpsed him tearing away
through the bresh on a pinto mustang, setting his hoss like it was
a red-hot stove, and dern him, he had my clothes in one hand! I was
so upsot by this that I missed him clean, and jumping out, I
charged through the bushes and saplings, but he was already out of
sight. I knowed it warn't likely he was with a war-party&mdash;just
a dern thieving Piute&mdash;but what a fix I was in! He'd even
stole my moccasins.</p>

<p>I couldn't go home, in that shape, without the letter, and admit
I missed a Injun twice. Pap would larrup the tar out of me. And if
I went on, what if I met some women, in the valley settlements? I
don't reckon they ever was a young'un half as bashful as what I was
in them days. Cold sweat busted out all over me. I thought, here I
started out to see the world and show Glory McGraw I was a man
among men, and here I am with no more clothes than a jackrabbit. At
last, in desperation, I buckled on my belt and started down the
trail towards Tomahawk. I was about ready to commit murder to get
me some pants.</p>

<p>I was glad the Injun didn't steal Alexander, but the going was
so rough I had to walk and lead him, because I kept to the thick
bresh alongside the trail. He had a tough time getting through the
bushes, and the thorns scratched him so he hollered, and ever' now
and then I had to lift him over jagged rocks. It was tough on
Alexander, but I was too bashful to travel in the open trail
without no clothes on.</p>

<p>After I'd gone maybe a mile I heard somebody in the trail ahead
of me, and peeking through the bushes, I seen a most pecooliar
sight. It was a man on foot, going the same direction as me, and he
had on what I instinctly guessed was city clothes. They warn't
buckskin nor homespun, nor yet like the duds Mister Wilkinson had
on, but they were very beautiful, with big checks and stripes all
over 'em. He had on a round hat with a narrer brim, and shoes like
I hadn't never seen before, being neither boots nor moccasins. He
was dusty, and he cussed considerable as he limped along. Ahead of
him I seen the trail made a hoss-shoe bend, so I cut straight
across and got ahead of him, and as he come along, I come out of
the bresh and throwed down on him with my cap-and- ball.</p>

<p>He throwed up his hands and hollered: "Don't shoot!"</p>

<p>"I don't want to, mister," I said, "but I got to have
clothes!"</p>

<p>He shook his head like he couldn't believe I was so, and he
said: "You ain't the color of a Injun, but&mdash;what kind of
people live in these hills, anyway?"</p>

<p>"Most of 'em's Democrats," I said. "But I ain't got no time to
talk politics. You climb out of them riggin's."</p>

<p>"My God!" he wailed. "My horse threw me off and ran away, and
I've bin walkin' for hours, expecting to get scalped by Injuns any
minute, and now a naked lunatic on a mule demands my clothes! It's
too dern much!"</p>

<p>"I cain't argy, mister," I said; "somebody's liable to come up
the trail any minute. Hustle!" So saying I shot his hat off to
encourage him.</p>

<p>He give a howl and shucked his duds in a hurry.</p>

<p>"My underclothes, too?" he demanded, shivering though it was
very hot.</p>

<p>"Is that what them things is?" I demanded, shocked. "I never
heard of a man wearin' such womanish things. The country is goin'
to the dogs, just like pap says. You better git goin'. Take my
mule. When I git to where I can git some regular clothes, we'll
swap back."</p>

<p>He clumb onto Alexander kind of dubious, and says to me,
despairful: "Will you tell me one thing&mdash;how do I get to
Tomahawk?"</p>

<p>"Take the next turn to the right," I said, "and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jest then Alexander turned his head and seen them underclothes
on his back, and he give a loud and ringing bray and sot sail down
the trail at full speed with the stranger hanging on with both
hands. Before they was out of sight they come to where the trail
forked, and Alexander taken the left branch instead of the right,
and vanished amongst the ridges.</p>

<p>I put on the clothes, and they scratched my hide something
fierce. I thinks, well, I got store-bought clothes quicker'n I
hoped to. But I didn't think much of 'em. The coat split down the
back, and the pants was too short, but the shoes was the wust; they
pinched all over. I throwed away the socks, having never wore none,
but put on what was left of the hat.</p>

<p>I went on down the trail, and taken the right-hand fork, and in
a mile or so I come out on a flat, and heard hosses running. The
next thing a mob of men on hosses bust into view. One of 'em
yelled: "There he is!" and they all come for me full tilt.
Instantly I decided that the stranger had got to Tomahawk after
all, somehow, and had sot his friends onto me for stealing his
clothes.</p>

<p>So I left the trail and took out across the sage grass, and they
all charged after me, yelling stop. Well, them dern shoes pinched
my feet so bad I couldn't make much speed, so after I had run maybe
a quarter of a mile I perceived that the hosses were beginning to
gain on me. So I wheeled with my cap-and-ball in my hand, but I was
going so fast, when I turned, them dern shoes slipped and I went
over backwards into a cactus bed just as I pulled the trigger. So I
only knocked the hat off of the first hossman. He yelled and pulled
up his hoss, right over me nearly, and as I drawed another bead on
him, I seen he had a bright shiny star onto his shirt. I dropped my
gun and stuck up my hands.</p>

<p>They swarmed around me&mdash;cowboys, from their looks. The man
with the star got off his hoss and picked up my gun and cussed.</p>

<p>"What did you lead us this chase through this heat and shoot at
me for?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I didn't know you was a officer," I said.</p>

<p>"Hell, McVey," said one of 'em, "you know how jumpy tenderfeet
is. Likely he thought we was Santry's outlaws. Where's yore
hoss?"</p>

<p>"I ain't got none," I said.</p>

<p>"Got away from you, hey?" said McVey. "Well, climb up behind
Kirby here, and let's git goin'."</p>

<p>To my surprise, the sheriff stuck my gun back in the scabbard,
and so I clumb up behind Kirby, and away we went. Kirby kept
telling me not to fall off, and it made me mad, but I said nothing.
After an hour or so we come to a bunch of houses they said was
Tomahawk. I got panicky when I seen all them houses, and would have
jumped down and run for the mountains, only I knowed they'd catch
me, with them dern pinchy shoes on.</p>

<p>I hadn't never seen such houses before. They was made out of
boards, mostly, and some was two stories high. To the north-west
and west the hills riz up a few hundred yards from the backs of the
houses, and on the other sides there was plains, with bresh and
timber on them.</p>

<p>"You boys ride into town and tell the folks that the shebang
starts soon," said McVey. "Me and Kirby and Richards will take him
to the ring."</p>

<p>I could see people milling around in the streets, and I never
had no idee they was that many folks in the world. The sheriff and
the other two fellers rode around the north end of the town and
stopped at a old barn and told me to get off. So I did, and we went
in and they had a kind of room fixed up in there with benches and a
lot of towels and water buckets, and the sheriff said: "This ain't
much of a dressin' room, but it'll have to do. Us boys don't know
much about this game, but we'll second you as good as we can. One
thing&mdash;the other feller ain't got no manager nor seconds
neither. How do you feel?"</p>

<p>"Fine," I said, "but I'm kind of hungry."</p>

<p>"Go git him somethin', Richards," said the sheriff.</p>

<p>"I didn't think they et just before a bout," said Richards.</p>

<p>"Aw, I reckon he knows what he's doin'," said McVey. "Gwan."</p>

<p>So Richards pulled out, and the sheriff and Kirby walked around
me like I was a prize bull, and felt my muscles, and the sheriff
said: "By golly, if size means anything, our dough is as good as in
our britches right now!"</p>

<p>I pulled my dollar out of my scabbard and said I would pay for
my keep, and they haw-hawed and slapped me on the back and said I
was a great joker. Then Richards come back with a platter of grub,
with a lot of men wearing boots and guns and whiskers, and they
stomped in and gawped at me, and McVey said: "Look him over, boys!
Tomahawk stands or falls with him today!"</p>

<p>They started walking around me like him and Kirby done, and I
was embarrassed and et three or four pounds of beef and a quart of
mashed pertaters, and a big hunk of white bread, and drunk about a
gallon of water, because I was purty thirsty. Then they all gaped
like they was surprised about something, and one of 'em said: "How
come he didn't arrive on the stagecoach yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Well," said the sheriff, "the driver told me he was so drunk
they left him at Bisney, and come on with his luggage, which is
over there in the corner. They got a hoss and left it there with
instructions for him to ride on to Tomahawk as soon as he sobered
up. Me and the boys got nervous today when he didn't show up, so we
went out lookin' for him, and met him hoofin' it down the
trail."</p>

<p>"I bet them Perdition <i>hombres</i> starts somethin'," said
Kirby. "Ain't a one of 'em showed up yet. They're settin' over at
Perdition soakin' up bad licker and broodin' on their wrongs. They
shore wanted this show staged over there. They claimed that since
Tomahawk was furnishin' one-half of the attraction, and Gunstock
the other half, the razee ought to be throwed at Perdition."</p>

<p>"Nothin' to it," said McVey. "It laid between Tomahawk and
Gunstock, and we throwed a coin and won it. If Perdition wants
trouble she can git it. Is the boys r'arin' to go?"</p>

<p>"Is they!" says Richards. "Every bar in Tomahawk is crowded with
<i>hombres</i> full of licker and civic pride. They're bettin'
their shirts, and they has been nine fights already. Everybody in
Gunstock's here."</p>

<p>"Well, le's git goin'," says McVey, getting nervous. "The
quicker it's over, the less blood there's likely to be spilt."</p>

<p>The first thing I knowed, they had laid hold of me and was
pulling my clothes off, so it dawned on me that I must be under
arrest for stealing that stranger's clothes. Kirby dug into the
baggage which was in one corner of the stall, and dragged out a
funny looking pair of pants; I know now they was white silk. I put
'em on because I didn't have nothing else to put on, and they
fitted me like my skin. Richards tied a American flag around my
waist, and they put some spiked shoes onto my feet.</p>

<p>I let 'em do like they wanted to, remembering what pap said
about not resisting no officer. Whilst so employed I begun to hear
a noise outside, like a lot of people whooping and cheering. Purty
soon in come a skinny old gink with whiskers and two guns on, and
he hollered: "Lissen here, Mac, dern it, a big shipment of gold is
down there waitin' to be took off by the evenin' stage, and the
whole blame town is deserted on account of this dern foolishness.
Suppose Comanche Santry and his gang gits wind of it?"</p>

<p>"Well," said McVey, "I'll send Kirby here to help you guard
it."</p>

<p>"You will like hell," says Kirby. "I'll resign as deputy first.
I got every cent of my dough on this scrap, and I aim to see
it."</p>

<p>"Well, send somebody!" says the old codger. "I got enough to do
runnin' my store, and the stage stand, and the post office,
without&mdash;"</p>

<p>He left, mumbling in his whiskers, and I said: "Who's that?"</p>

<p>"Aw," said Kirby, "that's old man Brenton that runs the store
down at the other end of town, on the east side of the street. The
post office is in there, too."</p>

<p>"I got to see him," I says. "There's a letter&mdash;"</p>

<p>Just then another man come surging in and hollered: "Hey, is
yore man ready? Folks is gittin' impatient!"</p>

<p>"All right," says McVey, throwing over me a thing he called a
bathrobe. Him and Kirby and Richards picked up towels and buckets
and things, and we went out the oppersite door from what we come
in, and they was a big crowd of people there, and they whooped and
shot off their pistols. I would have bolted back into the barn,
only they grabbed me and said it was all right. We pushed through
the crowd, and I never seen so many boots and pistols in my life,
and we come to a square corral made out of four posts sot in the
ground, and ropes stretched between. They called this a ring and
told me to get in. I done so, and they had turf packed down so the
ground was level as a floor and hard and solid. They told me to set
down on a stool in one corner, and I did, and wrapped my robe
around me like a Injun.</p>

<p>Then everybody yelled, and some men, from Gunstock, McVey said,
clumb through the ropes on the other side. One of 'em was dressed
like I was, and I never seen such a funny-looking human. His ears
looked like cabbages, and his nose was plumb flat, and his head was
shaved and looked right smart like a bullet. He sot down in a
oppersite corner.</p>

<p>Then a feller got up and waved his arms, and hollered: "Gents,
you all know the occasion of this here suspicious event. Mister Bat
O'Tool, happenin' to be passin' through Gunstock, consented to
fight anybody which would meet him. Tomahawk riz to the occasion by
sendin' all the way to Denver to procure the services of Mister
Bruiser McGoorty, formerly of San Francisco!"</p>

<p>He p'inted at me, and everybody cheered and shot off their
pistols, and I was embarrassed and bust out in a cold sweat.</p>

<p>"This fight," said the feller, "will be fit accordin' to London
Prize Ring Rules, same as in a champeenship go. Bare fists, round
ends when one of 'em's knocked down or throwed down. Fight lasts
till one or t'other ain't able to come up to the scratch when
time's called. I, Yucca Blaine, have been selected as referee
because, bein' from Chawed Ear, I got no prejudices either way. Air
you all ready? Time!"</p>

<p>McVey hauled me off my stool and pulled off my bathrobe and
pushed me out into the ring. I nearly died with embarrassment, but
I seen the feller they called O'Tool didn't have on no more clothes
than me. He approached and held out his hand like he wanted to
shake hands, so I held out mine. We shook hands, and then without
no warning he hit me a awful lick on the jaw with his left. It was
like being kicked by a mule. The first part of me which hit the
turf was the back of my head. O'Tool stalked back to his corner,
and the Gunstock boys was dancing and hugging each other, and the
Tomahawk fellers was growling in their whiskers and fumbling with
their guns and bowie knives.</p>

<p>McVey and his deperties rushed into the ring before I could get
up and dragged me to my corner and begun pouring water on me.</p>

<p>"Air you hurt much?" yelled McVey.</p>

<p>"How can a man's fist hurt anybody?" I ast. "I wouldn't of fell
down, only I was caught off-guard. I didn't know he was goin' to
hit me. I never played no game like this here'n before."</p>

<p>McVey dropped the towel he was beating me in the face with, and
turned pale. "Ain't you Bruiser McGoorty of San Francisco?" he
hollered.</p>

<p>"Naw," I said. "I'm Breckinridge Elkins, from up in the Humbolt
Mountains. I come here to git a letter for pap."</p>

<p>"But the stagecoach driver described them clothes&mdash;" he
begun wildly.</p>

<p>"A Injun stole my clothes," I explained, "so I taken some off'n
a stranger. Maybe that was Mister McGoorty."</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" ast Kirby, coming up with another bucket of
water. "Time's about ready to be called."</p>

<p>"We're sunk!" bawled McVey. "This ain't McGoorty! This is a
derned hillbilly which murdered McGoorty and stole his
clothes!"</p>

<p>"We're rooint!" exclaimed Richards, aghast. "Everybody's bet
their dough without even seein' our man, they was that full of
trust and civic pride. We cain't call it off now. Tomahawk is
rooint! What'll we do?"</p>

<p>"He's goin' to git in there and fight his derndest," said McVey,
pulling his gun and jamming it into my back. "We'll hang him after
the fight."</p>

<p>"But he cain't box!" wailed Richards.</p>

<p>"No matter," said McVey; "the fair name of our town is at stake;
Tomahawk promised to supply a fighter to fight O'Tool,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh!" I said, suddenly seeing light. "This here is a fight then,
ain't it?"</p>

<p>McVey give a low moan, and Kirby reched for his gun, but just
then the referee hollered time, and I jumped up and run at O'Tool.
If a fight was all they wanted, I was satisfied. All that talk
about rules, and the yelling of the crowd and all had had me so
confused I hadn't knowed what it was all about. I hit at O'Tool and
he ducked and hit me in the belly and on the nose and in the eye
and on the ear. The blood spurted, and the crowd hollered, and he
looked plumb dumbfounded and gritted betwixt his teeth: "Are you
human? Why don't you fall?"</p>

<p>I spit out a mouthful of blood and got my hands on him and
started chawing his ear, and he squalled like a catamount. Yucca
run in and tried to pull me loose and I give him a slap under the
ear and he turned a somersault into the ropes.</p>

<p>"Yore man's fightin' foul!" he squalled, and Kirby said: "Yo're
crazy! Do you see this gun? You holler 'foul' just once more, and
it'll go off!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile O'Tool had broke loose from me and caved in his
knuckles on my jaw, and I come for him again, because I was
beginning to lose my temper. He gasped: "If you want to make an
alley-fight out of it, all right. I wasn't raised in Five Points
for nothing!" He then rammed his knee into my groin, and groped for
my eye, but I got his thumb in my teeth and begun masticating it,
and the way he howled was a caution.</p>

<p>By this time the crowd was crazy, and I throwed O'Tool and begun
to stomp him, when somebody let bang at me from the crowd and the
bullet cut my silk belt and my pants started to fall down.</p>

<p>I grabbed 'em with both hands, and O'Tool riz up and rushed at
me, bloody and bellering, and I didn't dare let go my pants to
defend myself. I whirled and bent over and lashed out backwards
with my right heel like a mule, and I caught him under the chin. He
done a cartwheel in the air, his head hit the turf, and he bounced
on over and landed on his back with his knees hooked over the lower
rope. There warn't no question about him being out. The only
question was, was he dead?</p>

<p>A roar of "Foul!" went up from the Gunstock men, and guns
bristled all around the ring.</p>

<p>The Tomahawk men was cheering and yelling that I'd won fair and
square, and the Gunstock men was cussing and threatening me, when
somebody hollered: "Leave it to the referee!"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Kirby. "He knows our man won fair, and if he don't
say so, I'll blow his head off!"</p>

<p>"That's a lie!" bellered a Gunstock man. "He knows it war a
foul, and if he says it warn't, I'll kyarve his gizzard with this
here bowie knife!"</p>

<p>At them words Yucca fainted, and then a clatter of hoofs sounded
above the din, and out of the timber that hid the trail from the
east a gang of hossmen rode at a run. Everybody yelled: "Look out,
here comes them Perdition illegitimates!"</p>

<p>Instantly a hundred guns covered 'em, and McVey demanded: "Come
ye in peace or in war?"</p>

<p>"We come to unmask a fraud!" roared a big man with a red
bandanner around his neck. "McGoorty, come forth!"</p>

<p>A familiar figger, now dressed in cowboy togs, pushed forward on
my mule. "There he is!" this figger yelled, p'inting a accusing
finger at me. "That's the desperado that robbed me! Them's my
tights he's got on!"</p>

<p>"What is this?" roared the crowd.</p>

<p>"A cussed fake!" bellered the man with the red bandanner. "This
here is Bruiser McGoorty!"</p>

<p>"Then who's he?" somebody bawled, p'inting at me.</p>

<p>"I'm Breckinridge Elkins and I can lick any man here!" I roared,
getting mad. I brandished my fists in defiance, but my britches
started sliding down again, so I had to shut up and grab 'em.</p>

<p>"Aha!" the man with the red bandanner howled like a hyener. "He
admits it! I dunno what the idee is, but these Tomahawk polecats
has double-crossed somebody! I trusts that you jackasses from
Gunstock realizes the blackness and hellishness of their hearts!
This man McGoorty rode into Perdition a few hours ago in his
unmentionables, astraddle of that there mule, and told us how he'd
been held up and robbed and put on the wrong road. You skunks was
too proud to stage this fight in Perdition, but we ain't the men to
see justice scorned with impunity! We brought McGoorty here to show
you that you was bein' gypped by Tomahawk! That man ain't no prize
fighter; he's a highway robber!"</p>

<p>"These Tomahawk coyotes has framed us!" squalled a Gunstock man,
going for his gun.</p>

<p>"Yo're a liar!" roared Richards, bending a .45 barrel over his
head.</p>

<p>The next instant guns was crashing, knives was gleaming, and men
was yelling blue murder. The Gunstock braves turned frothing on the
Tomahawk warriors, and the men from Perdition, yelping with glee,
pulled their guns, and begun fanning the crowd indiscriminately,
which give back their fire. McGoorty give a howl and fell down on
Alexander's neck, gripping around it with both arms, and Alexander
departed in a cloud of dust and gun-smoke.</p>

<p>I grabbed my gunbelt, which McVey had hung over the post in my
corner, and I headed for cover, holding onto my britches whilst the
bullets hummed around me as thick as bees. I wanted to take to the
bresh, but I remembered that blamed letter, so I headed for town.
Behind me there riz a roar of banging guns and yelling men. Jest as
I got to the backs of the row of buildings which lined the street,
I run head on into something soft. It was McGoorty, trying to
escape on Alexander. He had hold of jest one rein, and Alexander,
evidently having rounded one end of the town, was traveling in a
circle and heading back where he started from.</p>

<p>I was going so fast I couldn't stop, and I run right over
Alexander and all three of us went down in a heap. I jumped up,
afeared Alexander was kilt or crippled, but he scrambled up
snorting and trembling, and then McGoorty weaved up, making funny
noises. I poked my cap-and-ball into his belly.</p>

<p>"Off with them pants!" I hollered.</p>

<p>"My God!" he screamed. "<i>Again?</i> This is getting to be a
habit!"</p>

<p>"Hustle!" I bellered. "You can have these scandals I got on
now."</p>

<p>He shucked his britches and grabbed them tights and run like he
was afeared I'd want his underwear too. I jerked on the pants,
forked Alexander and headed for the south end of town. I kept
behind the houses, though the town seemed to be deserted, and purty
soon I come to the store where Kirby had told me old man Brenton
kept the post office. Guns was barking there, and across the street
I seen men ducking in and out behind a old shack, and shooting.</p>

<p>I tied Alexander to a corner of the store and went in the back
door. Up in the front part I seen old man Brenton kneeling behind
some barrels with a .45-90, and he was shooting at the fellers in
the shack acrost the street. Every now and then a slug would hum
through the door and comb his whiskers, and he would cuss worse'n
pap did that time he sot down in a b'ar trap.</p>

<p>I went up to him and tapped him on the shoulder and he give a
squall and flopped over and let go <i>bam!</i> right in my face and
singed off my eyebrows. And the fellers acrost the street hollered
and started shooting at both of us.</p>

<p>I'd grabbed the barrel of his Winchester, and he was cussing and
jerking at it with one hand and feeling in his boot for a knife
with the other'n, and I said: "Mister Brenton, if you ain't too
busy, I wish you'd gimme that there letter which come for pap."</p>

<p>"Don't never come up behind me like that again!" he squalled. "I
thought you was one of them dern outlaws! Look out! Duck, you blame
fool!"</p>

<p>I let go of his gun, and he taken a shot at a head which was
aiming around the corner of the shack, and the head let out a
squall and disappeared.</p>

<p>"Who is them fellers?" I ast.</p>

<p>"Comanche Santry and his bunch, from up in the hills," snarled
old man Brenton, jerking the lever of his Winchester. "They come
after that gold. A hell of a sheriff McVey is; never sent me
nobody. And them fools over at the ring are makin' so much noise
they'll never hear the shootin' over here. Look out, here they
come!"</p>

<p>Six or seven men rushed out from behind the shack and run acrost
the street, shooting as they come. I seen I'd never get my letter
as long as all this fighting was going on, so I unslung my old
cap-and-ball and let <i>bam</i> at them three times, and three of
them outlaws fell acrost each other in the street, and the rest
turned around and run back behind the shack.</p>

<p>"Good work, boy!" yelled old man Brenton. "If I ever&mdash;oh,
Judas Iscariot, we're blowed up now!"</p>

<p>Something was pushed around the corner of the shack and come
rolling down towards us, the shack being on higher ground than what
the store was. It was a keg, with a burning fuse which whirled as
the keg revolved and looked like a wheel of fire.</p>

<p>"What's in that there kaig?" I ast.</p>

<p>"Blastin' powder!" screamed old man Brenton, scrambling up.
"Run, you dern fool! It's comin' right into the door!"</p>

<p>He was so scairt he forgot all about the fellers acrost the
street, and one of 'em caught him in the thigh with a buffalo
rifle, and he plunked down again, howling blue murder. I stepped
over him to the door&mdash;that's when I got that slug in my
hip&mdash;and the keg hit my laigs and stopped, so I picked it up
and heaved it back acrost the street. It hadn't no more'n hit the
shack when <i>bam!</i> it exploded and the shack went up in smoke.
When it stopped raining pieces of wood and metal, they warn't no
sign to show any outlaws had ever hid behind where that shack had
been.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't believe it if I hadn't saw it myself," old man
Brenton moaned faintly.</p>

<p>"Air you hurt bad, Mister Brenton?" I ast.</p>

<p>"I'm dyin'," he groaned.</p>

<p>"Well, before you die, Mister Brenton," I says, "would you mind
givin' me that there letter for pap?"</p>

<p>"What's yore pap's name?" he ast.</p>

<p>"Roarin' Bill Elkins, of Bear Creek," I said.</p>

<p>He warn't as bad hurt as he thought. He reched up and got hold
of a leather bag and fumbled in it and pulled out a envelope. "I
remember tellin' old Buffalo Rogers I had a letter for Bill
Elkins," he said, fingering it over. Then he said: "Hey, wait! This
ain't for yore pap. My sight is gittin' bad. I read it wrong the
first time. This here is for Bill <i>Elston</i> that lives between
here and Perdition."</p>

<p>I want to spike a rumor which says I tried to murder old man
Brenton and tore down his store for spite. I've done told how he
got his laig broke, and the rest was accidental. When I realized
that I had went through all that embarrassment for nothing, I was
so mad and disgusted I turned and run out of the back door, and I
forgot to open the door and that's how it got tore off the
hinges.</p>

<p>I then jumped onto Alexander and forgot to ontie him loose from
the store. I kicked him in the ribs, and he bolted and tore loose
that corner of the building and that's how come the roof to fall
in. Old man Brenton inside was scairt and started yelling bloody
murder, and about that time a mob of men come up to investigate the
explosion which had stopped the three-cornered battle between
Perdition, Tomahawk and Gunstock, and they thought I was the cause
of everything, and they all started shooting at me as I rode
off.</p>

<p>Then was when I got that charge of buckshot in my back.</p>

<p>I went out of Tomahawk and up the hill trail so fast I bet me
and Alexander looked like a streak; and I says to myself it looks
like making a name for myself in the world is going to be tougher
than I thought, because it's evident that civilization is full of
snares for a boy which ain't reched his full growth and
strength.</p>

<br>

<h2><a id="gent3" name="gent3">3. MEET CAP'N KIDD</a>
</h2>

<p style="text-indent:0">I DIDN'T pull up Alexander till I was
plumb out of sight of Tomahawk. Then I slowed down and taken stock
of myself, and my spirits was right down in my spiked shoes which
still had some of Mister O'Tool's hide stuck onto the spikes. Here
I'd started forth into the world to show Glory McGraw what a he-
bearcat I was, and now look at me. Here I was without even no
clothes but them derned spiked shoes which pinched my feet, and a
pair of britches some cow- puncher had wore the seat out of and
patched with buckskin. I still had my gunbelt and the dollar pap
gimme, but no place to spend it. I likewise had a goodly amount of
lead under my hide.</p>

<p>"By golly!" I says, shaking my fists at the universe at large.
"I ain't goin' to go back to Bear Creek like this, and have Glory
McGraw laughin' at me! I'll head for the Wild River settlements and
git me a job punchin' cows till I got money enough to buy me
store-bought boots and a hoss!"</p>

<p>I then pulled out my bowie knife which was in a scabbard on my
gunbelt, and started digging the slug out of my hip, and the
buckshot out of my back. Them buckshot was kinda hard to get to,
but I done it. I hadn't never held a job of punching cows, but I'd
had plenty experience roping wild bulls up in the Humbolts. Them
bulls wanders off the lower ranges into the mountains and grows
most amazing big and mean. Me and Alexander had had plenty
experience with them, and I had me a lariat which would hold any
steer that ever bellered. It was still tied to my saddle, and I was
glad none of them cowpunchers hadn't stole it. Maybe they didn't
know it was a lariat. I'd made it myself, especial, and used it to
rope them bulls and also cougars and grizzlies which infests the
Humbolts. It was made out of buffalo hide, ninety foot long and
half again as thick and heavy as the average lariat, and the honda
was a half-pound chunk of iron beat into shape with a sledge
hammer. I reckoned I was qualified for a <i>vaquero</i> even if I
didn't have no cowboy clothes and was riding a mule.</p>

<p>So I headed acrost the mountains for the cowcountry. They warn't
no trail the way I taken, but I knowed the direction Wild River lay
in, and that was enough for me. I knowed if I kept going that way
I'd hit it after awhile. Meanwhile, they was plenty of grass in the
draws and along the creeks to keep Alexander fat and sleek, and
plenty of squirrels and rabbits for me to knock over with rocks. I
camped that night away up in the high ranges and cooked me nine or
ten squirrels over a fire and et 'em, and while that warn't much of
a supper for a appertite like mine, still I figgered next day I'd
stumble onto a b'ar or maybe a steer which had wandered offa the
ranges.</p>

<p class="cpb">* * *</p>

<p>Next morning before sunup I was on Alexander and moving on,
without no breakfast, because it looked like they warn't no rabbits
nor nothing near abouts, and I rode all morning without sighting
nothing. It was a high range, and nothing alive there but a buzzard
I seen onst, but late in the afternoon I crossed a backbone and
come down into a whopping big plateau about the size of a county,
with springs and streams and grass growing stirrup-high along 'em,
and clumps of cottonwood, and spruce, and pine thick up on the
hillsides. They was canyons and cliffs, and mountains along the
rim, and altogether it was as fine a country as I ever seen, but it
didn't look like nobody lived there, and for all I know I was the
first white man that ever come into it. But they was more soon, as
I'll relate.</p>

<p>Well, I noticed something funny as I come down the ridge that
separated the bare hills from the plateau. First I met a wildcat.
He come lipping along at a right smart clip, and he didn't stop. He
just gimme a wicked look sidewise and kept right on up the slope.
Next thing I met a lobo wolf, and after that I counted nine more
wolves, and they was all heading west, up the slopes. Then
Alexander give a snort and started trembling, and a cougar slid out
of a blackjack thicket and snarled at us over his shoulder as he
went past at a long lope. All them varmints was heading for the dry
bare country I'd just left, and I wondered why they was leaving a
good range like this one to go into that dern no-account
country.</p>

<p>It worried Alexander too, because he smelt of the air and brayed
kind of plaintively. I pulled him up and smelt the air too, because
critters run like that before a forest fire, but I couldn't smell
no smoke, nor see none. So I rode on down the slopes and started
across the flats, and as I went I seen more bobcats, and wolves,
and painters, and they was all heading west, and they warn't
lingering none, neither. They warn't no doubt that them critters
was pulling their freight because they was scairt of something, and
it warn't humans, because they didn't 'pear to be scairt of me a
mite. They just swerved around me and kept trailing. After I'd gone
a few miles I met a herd of wild hosses, with the stallion herding
'em. He was a big mean-looking cuss, but he looked scairt as bad as
any of the critters I'd saw.</p>

<p>The sun was getting low, and I was getting awful hungry as I
come into a open spot with a creek on one side running through
clumps of willers and cottonwoods, and on the other side I could
see some big cliffs looming up over the tops of the trees. And
whilst I was hesitating, wondering if I ought to keep looking for
eatable critters, or try to worry along on a wildcat or a wolf, a
big grizzly come lumbering out of a clump of spruces and headed
west. When he seen me and Alexander he stopped and snarled like he
was mad about something, and then the first thing I knowed he was
charging us. So I pulled my .44 and shot him through the head, and
got off and onsaddled Alexander and turnt him loose in grass
stirrup-high, and skun the b'ar. Then I cut me off some steaks and
started a fire and begun reducing my appertite. That warn't no
small job, because I hadn't had nothing to eat since the night
before.</p>

<p>Well, while I was eating I heard hosses and looked up and seen
six men riding towards me from the east. One was as big as me, but
the other ones warn't but about six foot tall apiece. They was
cowpunchers, by their look, and the biggest man was dressed plumb
as elegant as Mister Wilkinson was, only his shirt was jest only
one color. But he had on fancy boots and a white Stetson and a
ivory-butted Colt, and what looked like the butt of a sawed-off
shotgun jutted out of his saddle-scabbard. He was dark and had
awful mean eyes, and a jaw which it looked like he could bite the
spokes out of a wagon wheel if he wanted to.</p>

<p>He started talking to me in Piute, but before I could say
anything, one of the others said: "Aw, that ain't no Injun,
Donovan, his eyes ain't the right color."</p>

<p>"I see that, now," says Donovan. "But I shore thought he was a
Injun when I first rode up and seen them old ragged britches and
his sunburnt hide. Who the devil air you?"</p>

<p>"I'm Breckinridge Elkins, from Bear Creek," I says, awed by his
magnificence.</p>

<p>"Well," says he, "I'm Wild Bill Donovan, which name is heard
with fear and tremblin' from Powder River to the Rio Grande. Just
now I'm lookin' for a wild stallion. Have you seen sech?"</p>

<p>"I seen a bay stallion headin' west with his herd," I said.</p>

<p>"'Twarn't him," says Donovan. "This here one's a pinto, the
biggest, meanest hoss in the world. He come down from the Humbolts
when he was a colt, but he's roamed the West from Border to Border.
He's so mean he ain't never got him a herd of his own. He takes
mares away from other stallions, and then drifts on alone just for
pure cussedness. When he comes into a country all other varmints
takes to the tall timber."</p>

<p>"You mean the wolves and painters and b'ars I seen headin' for
the high ridges was runnin' away from this here stallion?" I
says.</p>

<p>"Exactly," says Donovan. "He crossed the eastern ridge sometime
durin' the night, and the critters that was wise high-tailed it. We
warn't far behind him; we come over the ridge a few hours ago, but
we lost his trail somewhere on this side."</p>

<p>"You chasin' him?" I ast.</p>

<p>"Ha!" snarled Donovan with a kind of vicious laugh. "The man
don't live what can chase Cap'n Kidd! We're just follerin' him. We
been follerin' him for five hundred miles, keepin' outa sight, and
hopin' to catch him off guard or somethin'. We got to have some
kind of a big advantage before we closes in, or even shows
ourselves. We're right fond of life! That devil has kilt more men
than any other ten hosses on this continent."</p>

<p>"What you call him?" I says.</p>

<p>"Cap'n Kidd," says Donovan. "Cap'n Kidd was a big pirate long
time ago. This here hoss is like him in lots of ways, particularly
in regard to morals. But I'll git him, if I have to foller him to
the Gulf and back. Wild Bill Donovan always gits what he wants, be
it money, woman, or hoss! Now lissen here, you range-country hobo:
we're a-siftin' north from here, to see if we cain't pick up Cap'n
Kidd's sign. If you see a pinto stallion bigger'n you ever dreamed
a hoss could be, or come onto his tracks, you drop whatever yo're
doin' and pull out and look for us, and tell me about it. You keep
lookin' till you find us, too. If you don't you'll regret it, you
hear me?"</p>

<p>"Yessir," I said. "Did you gents come through the Wild River
country?"</p>

<p>"Maybe we did and maybe we didn't," he says with haughty
grandeur. "What business is that of yore'n, I'd like to know?"</p>

<p>"Not any," I says. "But I was aimin' to go there and see if I
could git me a job punchin' cows."</p>

<p>At that he throwed back his head and laughed long and loud, and
all the other fellers laughed too, and I was embarrassed.</p>

<p>"You git a job punchin' cows?" roared Donovan. "With them
britches and shoes, and not even no shirt, and that there
ignorant-lookin' mule I see gobblin' grass over by the creek? Haw!
haw! haw! haw! You better stay up here in the mountains whar you
belong and live on roots and nuts and jackrabbits like the other
Piutes, red or white! Any self-respectin' rancher would take a
shotgun to you if you was to ast him for a job. Haw! haw! haw!" he
says, and rode off still laughing.</p>

<p>I was that embarrassed I bust out into a sweat. Alexander was a
good mule, but he did look kind of funny in the face. But he was
the only critter I'd ever found which could carry my weight very
many miles without giving plumb out. He was awful strong and tough,
even if he was kind of dumb and pot-bellied. I begun to get kind of
mad, but Donovan and his men was already gone, and the stars was
beginning to blink out. So I cooked me some more b'ar steaks and et
'em, and the land sounded awful still, not a wolf howling nor a
cougar squalling. They was all west of the ridge. This critter
Cap'n Kidd sure had the country to hisself, as far as the
meat-eating critters was consarned.</p>

<p>I hobbled Alexander close by and fixed me a bed with some boughs
and his saddle blanket, and went to sleep. I was woke up shortly
after midnight by Alexander trying to get in bed with me.</p>

<p>I sot up in irritation and prepared to bust him in the snoot,
when I heard what had scairt him. I never heard such a noise. My
hair stood straight up. It was a stallion neighing, but I never
heard no hoss critter neigh like that. I bet you could of heard it
for fifteen miles. It sounded like a combination of a wild hoss
neighing, a rip saw going through a oak log full of knots, and a
hungry cougar screeching. I thought it come from somewhere within a
mile of the camp, but I warn't sure. Alexander was shivering and
whimpering he was that scairt, and stepping all over me as he tried
to huddle down amongst the branches and hide his head under my
shoulder. I shoved him away, but he insisted on staying as close to
me as he could, and when I woke up again next morning he was
sleeping with his head on my belly.</p>

<p>But he must of forgot about the neigh he heard, or thought it
was jest a bad dream or something, because as soon as I taken the
hobbles off of him he started cropping grass and wandered off
amongst the thickets in his pudding-head way.</p>

<p>I cooked me some more b'ar steaks, and wondered if I ought to go
and try to find Mister Donovan and tell him about hearing the
stallion neigh, but I figgered he'd heard it. Anybody that was
within a day's ride ought to of heard it. Anyway, I seen no reason
why I should run errands for Donovan.</p>

<p>I hadn't got through eating when I heard Alexander give a
horrified bray, and he come lickety-split out of a grove of trees
and made for the camp, and behind him come the biggest hoss I ever
seen in my life. Alexander looked like a pot-bellied bull pup
beside of him. He was painted&mdash;black and white&mdash;and he
r'ared up with his long mane flying agen the sunrise, and give a
scornful neigh that nigh busted my ear-drums, and turned around and
sa'ntered back towards the grove, cropping grass as he went, like
he thunk so little of Alexander he wouldn't even bother to chase
him.</p>

<p>Alexander come blundering into camp, blubbering and hollering,
and run over the fire and scattered it every which away, and then
tripped hisself over the saddle which was laying nearby, and fell
on his neck braying like he figgered his life was in danger.</p>

<p>I catched him and throwed the saddle and bridle onto him, and by
that time Cap'n Kidd was out of sight on the other side of the
thicket. I onwound my lariat and headed in that direction. I
figgered not even Cap'n Kidd could break that lariat. Alexander
didn't want to go; he sot back on his haunches and brayed fit to
deefen you, but I spoke to him sternly, and it seemed to convince
him that he better face the stallion than me, so he moved out, kind
of reluctantly.</p>

<p>We went past the grove and seen Cap'n Kidd cropping grass in the
patch of rolling prairie just beyond, so I rode towards him,
swinging my lariat. He looked up and snorted kinda threateningly,
and he had the meanest eye I ever seen in man or beast; but he
didn't move, just stood there looking contemptuous, so I throwed my
rope and piled the loop right around his neck, and Alexander sot
back on his haunches.</p>

<p>Well, it was about like roping a roaring hurricane. The instant
he felt that rope Cap'n Kidd give a convulsive start, and made one
mighty lunge for freedom. The lariat held, but the girths didn't.
They held jest long enough for Alexander to get jerked head over
heels, and naturally I went along with him. But right in the middle
of the somesault we taken, both girths snapped.</p>

<p>Me and the saddle and Alexander landed all in a tangle, but
Cap'n Kidd jerked the saddle from amongst us, because I had my rope
tied fast to the horn, Texas-style, and Alexander got loose from me
by the simple process of kicking me vi'lently in the ear. He also
stepped on my face when he jumped up, and the next instant he was
high-tailing it through the bresh in the general direction of Bear
Creek. As I learned later he didn't stop till he run into pap's
cabin and tried to hide under my brother John's bunk.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Cap'n Kidd had throwed the loop offa his head and come
for me with his mouth wide open, his ears laid back and his teeth
and eyes flashing. I didn't want to shoot him, so I riz up and run
for the trees. But he was coming like a tornado, and I seen he was
going to run me down before I could get to a tree big enough to
climb, so I grabbed me a sapling about as thick as my laig and tore
it up by the roots, and turned around and busted him over the head
with it, just as he started to r'ar up to come down on me with his
front hoofs.</p>

<p>Pieces of roots and bark and wood flew every which a way, and
Cap'n Kidd grunted and batted his eyes and went back onto his
haunches. It was a right smart lick. If I'd ever hit Alexander that
hard it would have busted his skull like a egg&mdash;and Alexander
had a awful thick skull, even for a mule.</p>

<p>Whilst Cap'n Kidd was shaking the bark and stars out of his
eyes, I run to a big oak and clumb it. He come after me instantly,
and chawed chunks out of the tree as big as washtubs, and kicked
most of the bark off as high up as he could rech, but it was a good
substantial tree, and it held. He then tried to climb it, which
amazed me most remarkable, but he didn't do much good at that. So
he give up with a snort of disgust and trotted off.</p>

<p>I waited till he was out of sight, and then I clumb down and got
my rope and saddle, and started follering him. I knowed there
warn't no use trying to catch Alexander with the lead he had. I
figgered he'd get back to Bear Creek safe. And Cap'n Kidd was the
critter I wanted now. The minute I lammed him with that tree and he
didn't fall, I knowed he was the hoss for me&mdash;a hoss which
could carry my weight all day without giving out, and likewise full
of spirit. I says to myself I rides him or the buzzards picks my
bones.</p>

<p>I snuck from tree to tree, and presently seen Cap'n Kidd
swaggering along and eating grass, and biting the tops off of young
sapling, and occasionally tearing down a good sized tree to get the
leaves off. Sometimes he'd neigh like a steamboat whistle, and let
his heels fly in all directions just out of pure cussedness. When
he done this the air was full of flying bark and dirt and rocks
till it looked like he was in the middle of a twisting cyclone. I
never seen such a critter in my life. He was as full of pizen and
rambunctiousness as a drunk Apache on the warpath.</p>

<p>I thought at first I'd rope him and tie the other end of the
rope to a big tree, but I was a-feared he'd chawed the lariat
apart. Then I seen something that changed my mind. We was close to
the rocky cliffs which jutted up above the trees, and Cap'n Kidd
was passing a canyon mouth that looked like a big knife cut. He
looked in and snorted, like he hoped they was a mountain lion
hiding in there, but they warn't, so he went on. The wind was
blowing from him towards me and he didn't smell me.</p>

<p>After he was out of sight amongst the trees I come out of cover
and looked into the cleft. It was kinda like a short blind canyon.
It warn't but about thirty foot wide at the mouth, but it widened
quick till it made a kind of bowl a hundred yards acrost, and then
narrowed to a crack again. Rock walls five hundred foot high was on
all sides except at the mouth.</p>

<p>"And here," says I to myself, "is a ready-made corral!"</p>

<p>Then I lay to and started to build a wall to close the mouth of
the canyon. Later on I heard that a scientific expedition (whatever
the hell that might be) was all excited over finding evidences of a
ancient race up in the mountains. They said they found a wall that
could of been built only by giants. They was crazy; that there was
the wall I built for Cap'n Kidd.</p>

<p>I knowed it would have to be high and solid if I didn't want
Cap'n Kidd to jump it or knock it down. They was plenty of boulders
laying at the foot of the cliffs which had weathered off, and I
didn't use a single rock which weighed less'n three hundred pounds,
and most of 'em was a lot heavier than that. It taken me most all
morning, but when I quit I had me a wall higher'n the average man
could reach, and so thick and heavy I knowed it would hold even
Cap'n Kidd.</p>

<p>I left a narrer gap in it, and piled some boulders close to it
on the outside, ready to shove 'em into the gap. Then I stood
outside the wall and squalled like a cougar. They ain't even a
cougar hisself can tell the difference when I squalls like one.
Purty soon I heard Cap'n Kidd give his war- neigh off yonder, and
then they was a thunder of hoofs and a snapping and crackling of
bresh, and he come busting into the open with his ears laid back
and his teeth bare and his eyes as red as a Comanche's war-paint.
He sure hated cougars. But he didn't seem to like me much neither.
When he seen me he give a roar of rage, and come for me
lickety-split. I run through the gap and hugged the wall inside,
and he come thundering after me going so fast he run clean across
the bowl before he checked hisself. Before he could get back to the
gap I'd run outside and was piling rocks in it. I had a good big
one about the size of a fat hawg and I jammed it in the gap first
and piled t'others on top of it.</p>

<p>Cap'n Kidd arriv at the gap all hoofs and teeth and fury, but it
was already filled too high for him to jump and too solid for him
to tear down. He done his best, but all he done was to knock some
chunks offa the rocks with his heels. He sure was mad. He was the
maddest hoss I ever seen, and when I got up on the wall and he seen
me, he nearly busted with rage.</p>

<p>He went tearing around the bowl, kicking up dust and neighing
like a steamboat on the rampage, and then he come back and tried to
kick the wall down again. When he turned to gallop off I jumped
offa the wall and landed square on his back, but before I could so
much as grab his mane he throwed me clean over the wall and I
landed in a cluster of boulders and cactus and skun my shin. This
made me mad so I got the lariat and the saddle and clumb back on
the wall and roped him, but he jerked the rope out of my hand
before I could get any kind of a purchase, and went bucking and
pitching around all over the bowl trying to get shet of the rope.
So purty soon he pitched right into the cliff- wall and he lammed
it so hard with his hind hoofs that a whole section of overhanging
rock was jolted loose and hit him right between the ears. That was
too much even for Cap'n Kidd.</p>

<p>It knocked him down and stunned him, and I jumped down into the
bowl and before he could come to I had my saddle onto him, and a
hackamore I'd fixed out of a piece of my lariat. I'd also mended
the girths with pieces of the lariat, too, before I built the
wall.</p>

<p>Well, when Cap'n Kidd recovered his senses and riz up, snorting
and war-like, I was on his back. He stood still for a instant like
he was trying to figger out jest what the hell was the matter, and
then he turned his head and seen me on his back. The next instant I
felt like I was astraddle of a ring-tailed cyclone.</p>

<p>I dunno what all he done. He done so many things all at onst I
couldn't keep track. I clawed leather. The man which could have
stayed onto him without clawing leather ain't born yet, or else
he's a cussed liar. Sometimes my feet was in the stirrups and
sometimes they warn't, and sometimes they was in the wrong
stirrups. I cain't figger out how that could be, but it was so.
Part of the time I was in the saddle and part of the time I was
behind it on his rump, or on his neck in front of it. He kept
reching back trying to snap my laig and onst he got my thigh
between his teeth and would ondoubtedly of tore the muscle out if I
hadn't shook him loose by beating him over the head with my
fist.</p>

<p>One instant he'd have his head betwixt his feet and I'd be
setting on a hump so high in the air I'd get dizzy, and the next
thing he'd come down stiff- laiged and I could feel my spine
telescoping. He changed ends so fast I got sick at my stummick and
he nigh unjointed my neck with his sunfishing. I calls it
sunfishing because it was more like that than anything. He
occasionally rolled over and over on the ground, too, which was
very uncomfortable for me, but I hung on, because I was afeared if
I let go I'd never get on him again. I also knowed that if he ever
shaken me loose I'd had to shoot him to keep him from stomping my
guts out. So I stuck, though I'll admit that they is few sensations
more onpleasant than having a hoss as big as Cap'n Kidd roll on you
nine or ten times.</p>

<p>He tried to scrape me off agen the walls, too, but all he done
was scrape off some hide and most of my pants, though it was when
he lurched agen that outjut of rock that I got them ribs cracked, I
reckon.</p>

<p>He looked like he was able to go on forever, and aimed to, but I
hadn't never met nothing which could outlast me, and I stayed with
him, even after I started bleeding at the nose and mouth and ears,
and got blind, and then all to onst he was standing stock still in
the middle of the bowl, with his tongue hanging out about three
foot, and his sweat-soaked sides heaving, and the sun was just
setting over the mountains. He'd bucked nearly all afternoon!</p>

<p>But he was licked. I knowed it and he knowed it. I shaken the
stars and sweat and blood out of my eyes and dismounted by the
simple process of pulling my feet out of the stirrups and falling
off. I laid there for maybe a hour, and was most amazing sick, but
so was Cap'n Kidd. When I was able to stand on my feet I taken the
saddle and the hackamore off and he didn't kick me nor nothing. He
jest made a half-hearted attempt to bite me but all he done was to
bite the buckle offa my gunbelt. They was a little spring back in
the cleft where the bowl narrered in the cliff, and plenty of
grass, so I figgered he'd be all right when he was able to stop
blowing and panting long enough to eat and drink.</p>

<p>I made a fire outside the bowl and cooked me what was left of
the b'ar meat, and then I lay down on the ground and slept till
sunup.</p>

<p>When I riz up and seen how late it was, I jumped up and run and
looked over the wall, and there was Cap'n Kidd mowing the grass
down as ca'm as you please. He give me a mean look, but didn't say
nothing. I was so eager to see if he was going to let me ride him
without no more foolishness that I didn't stop for breakfast, nor
to fix the buckle onto my gunbelt. I left it hanging on a spruce
limb, and clumb into the bowl. Cap'n Kidd laid back his ears but
didn't do nothing as I approached outside of making a swipe at me
with his left hoof. I dodged and give him a good hearty kick in the
belly and he grunted and doubled up, and I clapped the saddle on
him. He showed his teeth at that, but he let me cinch it up, and
put on the hackamore, and when I got on him he didn't pitch but
about ten jumps and make but one snap at my laig.</p>

<p>Well, I was plumb tickled as you can imagine. I clumb down and
opened the gap in the wall and led him out, and when he found he
was outside the bowl he bolted and dragged me for a hundred yards
before I managed to get the rope around a tree. After I tied him up
though, he didn't try to bust loose.</p>

<p>I started back towards the tree where I left my gunbelt when I
heard hosses running, and the next thing I knowed Donovan and his
five men busted into the open and pulled up with their mouths wide
open. Cap'n Kidd snorted warlike when he seen 'em, but didn't cut
up no other way.</p>

<p>"Blast my soul!" says Donovan. "Can I believe my eyes? If there
ain't Cap'n Kidd hisself, saddled and tied to that tree! Did
<i>you</i> do that?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," I said.</p>

<p>He looked me over and said: "I believes it. You looked like you
been through a sausage-grinder. Air you still alive?"</p>

<p>"My ribs is kind of sore," I said.</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;!" says Donovan. "To think that a blame
half-naked hillbilly should do what the best hossmen of the West
has attempted in vain! I don't aim to stand for it! I knows my
rights! That there is my hoss by rights! I've trailed him nigh a
thousand miles, and combed this cussed plateau in a circle. He's my
hoss!"</p>

<p>"He ain't, nuther," I says. "He come from the Humbolts original,
jest like me. You said so yoreself. Anyway, I caught him and broke
him, and he's mine."</p>

<p>"He's right, Bill," one of the men says to Donovan.</p>

<p>"You shet up!" roared Donovan. "What Wild Bill Donovan wants, he
gits!"</p>

<p>I reched for my gun and then remembered in despair that it was
hanging on a limb a hundred yards away. Donovan covered me with the
sawed-off shotgun he jerked out of his saddle-holster as he swung
down.</p>

<p>"Stand where you be," he advised me. "I ought to shoot you for
not comin' and tellin' me when you seen the hoss, but after all
you've saved me the trouble of breakin' him in."</p>

<p>"So yo're a hoss-thief!" I said wrathfully.</p>

<p>"You be keerful what you calls me!" he roared. "I ain't no hoss
thief. We gambles for that hoss. Set down!"</p>

<p>I sot and he sot on his heels in front of me, with his sawed-off
still covering me. If it'd been a pistol I would of took it away
from him and shoved the barrel down his throat. But I was quite
young in them days and bashful about shotguns. The others squatted
around us, and Donovan says: "Smoky, haul out yore deck&mdash;the
special one. Smoky deals, hillbilly, and the high hand wins the
hoss."</p>

<p>"I'm puttin' up my hoss, it looks like," I says fiercely. "What
<i>you</i> puttin' up?"</p>

<p>"My Stetson hat!" says he. "Haw! haw! haw!"</p>

<p>"Haw! haw! haw!" chortles the other hoss-thieves.</p>

<p>Smoky started dealing and I said: "Hey! Yo're dealin' Donovan's
hand offa the bottom of the deck!"</p>

<p>"Shet up!" roared Donovan, poking me in the belly with his
shotgun. "You be keerful how you slings them insults around! This
here is a fair and square game, and I just happen to be lucky. Can
you beat four aces?"</p>

<p>"How you know you got four aces?" I says fiercely. "You ain't
looked at yore hand yet."</p>

<p>"Oh," says he, and picked it up and spread it out on the grass,
and they was four aces and a king. "By golly!" says he. "I shore
called that shot right!"</p>

<p>"Remarkable foresight!" I said bitterly, throwing down my hand
which was a three, five and seven of hearts, a ten of clubs and a
jack of diamonds.</p>

<p>"Then I wins!" gloated Donovan, jumping up. I riz too, quick and
sudden, but Donovan had me covered with that cussed shotgun.</p>

<p>"Git on that hoss and ride him over to our camp, Red," says
Donovan, to a big red-headed <i>hombre</i> which was shorter than
him but jest about as big. "See if he's properly broke. I wants to
keep my eye on this hillbilly myself."</p>

<p>So Red went over to Cap'n Kidd which stood there saying nothing,
and my heart sunk right down to the tops of my spiked shoes. Red
ontied him and clumb on him and Cap'n Kidd didn't so much as snap
at him. Red says: "Git goin', cuss you!" Cap'n Kidd turnt his head
and looked at Red and then he opened his mouth like a alligator and
started laughing. I never seen a hoss laugh before, but now I know
what they mean by a hoss-laugh. Cap'n Kidd didn't neigh nor nicker.
He jest laughed. He laughed till the acorns come rattling down outa
the trees and the echoes rolled through the cliffs like thunder.
And then he reched his head around and grabbed Red's laig and
dragged him out of the saddle, and held him upside down with guns
and things spilling out of his scabbards and pockets, and Red
yelling blue murder. Cap'n Kidd shaken him till he looked like a
rag and swung him around his head three or four times, and then let
go and throwed him clean through a alder thicket.</p>

<p>Them fellers all stood gaping, and Donovan had forgot about me,
so I grabbed the shotgun away from him and hit him under the ear
with my left fist and he bit the dust. I then swung the gun on the
others and roared: "Onbuckle them gunbelts, cuss ye!" They was
bashfuller about buckshot at close range than I was. They didn't
argy. Them four gunbelts was on the grass before I stopped
yelling.</p>

<p>"All right," I said. "Now go catch Cap'n Kidd."</p>

<p>Because he had gone over to where their hosses was tied and was
chawing and kicking the tar out of them and they was hollering
something fierce.</p>

<p>"He'll kill us!" squalled the men.</p>

<p>"Well, what of it?" I snarled. "Gwan!"</p>

<p>So they made a desperate foray onto Cap'n Kidd and the way he
kicked 'em in the belly and bit the seat out of their britches was
beautiful to behold. But whilst he was stomping them I come up and
grabbed his hackamore and when he seen who it was he stopped
fighting, so I tied him to a tree away from the other hosses. Then
I throwed Donovan's shotgun onto the men and made 'em get up and
come over to where Donovan was laying, and they was a bruised and
battered gang. The way they taken on you'd of thought somebody had
mistreated 'em.</p>

<p>I made 'em take Donovan's gunbelt offa him and about that time
he come to and sot up, muttering something about a tree falling on
him.</p>

<p>"Don't you remember me?" I says. "I'm Breckinridge Elkins."</p>

<p>"It all comes back," he muttered. "We gambled for Cap'n
Kidd."</p>

<p>"Yeah," I says, "and you won, so now we gambles for him again.
You sot the stakes before. This time I sets 'em. I matches these
here britches I got on agen Cap'n Kidd, and yore saddle, bridle,
gunbelt, pistol, pants, shirt, boots, spurs and Stetson."</p>

<p>"Robbery!" he bellered. "Yo're a cussed bandit!"</p>

<p>"Shet up," I says, poking him in the midriff with his shotgun.
"Squat! The rest of you, too."</p>

<p>"Ain't you goin' to let us do somethin' for Red?" they said. Red
was laying on the other side of the thicket Cap'n Kidd had throwed
him through, groaning loud and fervent.</p>

<p>"Let him lay for a spell," I says. "If he's dyin' they ain't
nothin' we can do for him, and if he ain't, he'll keep till this
game's over. Deal, Smoky, and deal from the top of the deck this
time."</p>

<p>So Smoky dealed in fear and trembling, and I says to Donovan:
"What you got?"</p>

<p>"A royal flush of diamonds, by God!" he says. "You cain't beat
that!"</p>

<p>"A royal flush of hearts'll beat it, won't it, Smoky?" I says,
and Smoky says: "Yuh&mdash;yuh&mdash;yeah! Yeah! Oh, yeah!"</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "I ain't looked at my hand yet, but I bet that's
jest what I got. What you think?" I says, p'inting the shotgun at
Donovan's upper teeth. "Don't you reckon I've got a royal flush in
hearts?"</p>

<p>"It wouldn't surprise me a bit," says Donovan, turning pale.</p>

<p>"Then everybody's satisfied and they ain't no use in me showin'
my hand," I says, throwing the cards back into the pack. "Shed them
duds!"</p>

<p>He shed 'em without a word, and I let 'em take up Red, which had
seven busted ribs, a dislocated arm and a busted laig, and they
kinda folded him acrost his saddle and tied him in place. Then they
pulled out without saying a word or looking back. They all looked
purty wilted, and Donovan particularly looked very pecooliar in the
blanket he had wrapped around his middle. If he'd had a feather in
his hair he'd of made a lovely Piute, as I told him. But he didn't
seem to appreciate the remark. Some men just naturally ain't got no
sense of humor.</p>

<p>They headed east, and as soon as they was out of sight, I put
the saddle and bridle I'd won onto Cap'n Kidd and getting the bit
in his mouth was about like rassling a mountain tornado. But I done
it, and then I put on the riggins I'd won. The boots was too small
and the shirt fit a mite too snug in the shoulders, but I sure felt
elegant, nevertheless, and stalked up and down admiring myself and
wishing Glory McGraw could see me then.</p>

<p>I cached my old saddle, belt and pistol in a holler tree, aiming
to send my younger brother Bill back after 'em. He could have 'em,
along with Alexander. I was going back to Bear Creek in style, by
golly!</p>

<p>With a joyful whoop I swung onto Cap'n Kidd, headed him west and
tickled his flanks with my spurs&mdash;them trappers in the
mountains which later reported having seen a blue streak traveling
westwardly so fast they didn't have time to tell what it was, and
was laughed at and accused of being drunk, was did a injustice.
What they seen was me and Cap'n Kidd going to Bear Creek. He run
fifty miles before he even pulled up for breath.</p>

<p>I ain't going to tell how long it took Cap'n Kidd to cover the
distance to Bear Creek. Nobody wouldn't believe me. But as I come
up the trail a few miles from my home cabin, I heard a hoss
galloping and Glory McGraw bust into view. She looked pale and
scairt, and when she seen me she give a kind of a holler and pulled
up her hoss so quick it went back onto its haunches.</p>

<p>"Breckinridge!" she gasped. "I jest heard from yore folks that
yore mule come home without you, and I was just startin' out to
look for&mdash;oh!" says she, noticing my hoss and elegant riggings
for the first time. She kind of froze up, and said stiffly: "Well,
<i>Mister</i> Elkins, I see yo're back home again."</p>

<p>"And you sees me rigged up in store-bought clothes and ridin'
the best hoss in the Humbolts, too, I reckon," I said. "I hope
you'll excuse me, <i>Miss</i> McGraw. I'm callin' on Ellen Reynolds
as soon as I've let my folks know I'm home safe. Good day!"</p>

<p>"Don't let me detain you!" she flared, but after I'd rode on
past she hollered: "Breckinridge Elkins, I hate you!"</p>

<p>"I know that," I said bitterly, "they warn't no use in tellin'
me again&mdash;"</p>

<p>But she was gone, riding lickety-split off through the woods
towards her home-cabin and I rode on for mine, thinking to myself
what curious critters gals was anyway.</p>

<h2><a id="gent4" name="gent4">4. GUNS OF THE MOUNTAINS</a>
</h2>

<p style="text-indent:0">THINGS run purty smooth for maybe a month
after I got back to Bear Creek. Folks come from miles around to see
Cap'n Kidd and hear me tell about licking Wild Bill Donovan, and
them fancy clothes sure had a pleasing effeck on Ellen Reynolds.
The only flies in the 'intment was Joel Braxton's brother Jim,
Ellen's old man, and my Uncle Garfield Elkins; but of him anon as
the French says.</p>

<p>Old Man Braxton didn't like me much, but I had learnt my lesson
in dealing with Old Man McGraw. I taken no foolishness offa him,
and Ellen warn't nigh as sensitive about it as Glory had been. But
I warn't sure about Jim Braxton. I discouraged him from calling on
Ellen, and I done it purty vi'lent, but I warn't sure he warn't
sneaking around and sparking her on the sly, and I couldn't tell
just what she thought about him. But I was making progress, when
the third fly fell into the 'intment.</p>

<p>Pap's Uncle Garfield Elkins come up from Texas to visit us.</p>

<p>That was bad enough by itself, but between Grizzly Run and
Chawed Ear the stage got held up by some masked bandits, and Uncle
Garfield, never being able to forget that he was a gunfighting fool
thirty or forty years ago, pulled his old cap-and-ball instead of
reching for the clouds like he was advised to. For some reason,
instead of blowing out his light, they merely busted him over the
head with a .45 barrel, and when he come to he was rattling on his
way towards Chawed Ear with the other passengers, minus his money
and watch.</p>

<p>It was his watch what caused the trouble. That there timepiece
had been his grandpap's, back in Kentucky, and Uncle Garfield sot
more store by it than he did all his kin folks.</p>

<p>When he arriv onto Bear Creek he imejitly let into howling his
woes to the stars like a wolf with the belly-ache. And from then on
we heered nothing but that watch. I'd saw it and thunk very little
of it. It was big as my fist, and wound up with a key which Uncle
Garfield was always losing and looking for. But it was solid gold,
and he called it a hairloom, whatever them things is. And he nigh
driv the family crazy.</p>

<p>"A passle of big hulks like you-all settin' around and lettin' a
old man git robbed of all his property," he would say bitterly.
"When <i>I</i> was a young buck, if'n <i>my</i> uncle had been
abused that way, I'd of took the trail and never slept nor et till
I brung back his watch and the sculp of the skunk which hived it.
Men now days&mdash;" And so on and so on, till I felt like
drownding the old jassack in a barrel of corn licker.</p>

<p>Finally pap says to me, combing his beard with his fingers;
"Breckinridge," says he, "I've endured Uncle Garfield's
belly-achin' all I aim to. I wants you to go look for his cussed
watch, and don't come back without it."</p>

<p>"How'm I goin' to know where to look?" I protested. "The feller
which got it may be in Californy or Mexico by now."</p>

<p>"I realizes the difficulties," says pap. "But warn't you eager
for farin's which would make you a name in the world?"</p>

<p>"They is times for everything," I said. "Right now I'm
interested in sparkin' a gal, which I ain't willin' to leave for no
wild goose chase."</p>

<p>"Well," says pap, "I've done made up our mind. If Uncle Garfield
knows somebody is out lookin' for his cussed timepiece, maybe he'll
give the rest of us some peace. You git goin', and if you cain't
find that watch, don't come back till after Uncle Garfield has went
home."</p>

<p>"How long does he aim to stay?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"Well," says pap, "Uncle Garfield's visits generally last a
year, at least."</p>

<p>At this I bust into earnest profanity.</p>

<p>I says: "I got to stay away from home a <i>year?</i> Dang it,
Pap, Jim Braxton'll steal Ellen Reynolds away from me whilst I'm
gone. I been courtin' that gal till I'm ready to fall dead. I done
licked her old man three times, and now, jest when I got her goin',
you tells me I got to up and leave her for a year with that dern
Jim Braxton to have no competition with."</p>

<p>"You got to choose between Ellen Reynolds and yore own flesh and
blood," says pap. "I'm derned if I'll listen to Uncle Garfield's
squawks any longer. You make yore own choice&mdash;but if you don't
choose to do what I asks you to, I'll fill yore hide with buckshot
every time I see you from now on."</p>

<p>Well, the result was that I was presently riding morosely away
from home and Ellen Reynolds, and in the general direction of where
Uncle Garfield's blasted watch might possibly be.</p>

<p>I rode by the Braxton cabin with the intention of dropping Jim a
warning about his actions whilst I was gone, but I didn't see his
saddle on the corral fence, so I knowed he warn't there. So I
issued a general defiance to the family by slinging a .45 slug
through the winder which knocked a corn cob pipe outa old man
Braxton's mouth. That soothed me a little, but I knowed very well
that Jim would make a bee-line for the Reynolds cabin the second I
was out of sight. I could just see him gorging on Ellen's b'ar meat
and honey, and bragging on hisself. I hoped Ellen would notice the
difference between a loud- mouthed boaster like him, and a quiet
modest young man like me, which never bragged, though admittedly
the biggest man and the best fighter in the Humbolts.</p>

<p>I hoped to meet Jim somewhere in the woods as I rode down the
trail, because I was intending to do something to kinda impede his
courting whilst I was gone, like breaking his laig or something,
but luck wasn't with me.</p>

<p>I headed in the general direction of Chawed Ear, and a few days
later seen me riding in gloomy grandeur through a country quite
some distance from Ellen Reynolds. Nobody'd been able to tell me
anything in Chawed Ear, so I thought I might as well comb the
country between there and Grizzly Run. Probably wouldn't never find
them dern bandits anyway.</p>

<p>Pap always said my curiosity would be the ruination of me some
day, but I never could listen to guns popping up in the mountains
without wanting to find out who was killing who. So that morning,
when I heard the rifles talking off amongst the trees, I turned
Cap'n Kidd aside and left the trail and rode in the direction of
the noise.</p>

<p>A dim path wound up through the big boulders and bushes, and the
shooting kept getting louder. Purty soon I come out into a glade,
and just as I did, <i>bam!</i> somebody let go at me from the bresh
and a .45-70 slug cut both my bridle reins nearly in half. I
instantly returned the shot with my .45, getting jest a glimpse of
something in the bresh, and a man let out a squall and jumped out
into the open, wringing his hands. My bullet had hit the lock of
his Winchester and mighty nigh jarred his hands offa him.</p>

<p>"Cease that ungodly noise," I said sternly, p'inting my .45 at
his bay-winder, "and explain how come you waylays innercent
travellers."</p>

<p>He quit working his fingers and moaning, and he said: "I thought
you was Joel Cairn, the outlaw. Yo're about his size."</p>

<p>"Well, I ain't," I said. "I'm Breckinridge Elkins, from Bear
Creek. I was jest ridin' over to find out what all the shootin' was
about."</p>

<p>The guns was banging in the trees behind the feller, and
somebody yelled what was the matter.</p>

<p>"Ain't nothin' the matter," he hollered back. "Just a
misunderstandin'." And he says to me: "I'm glad to see you, Elkins.
We need a man like you. I'm Sheriff Dick Hopkins, from Grizzly
Run."</p>

<p>"Where at's yore star?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"I lost it in the bresh," he said. "Me and my deputies have been
chasin' Tarantula Bixby and his gang for a day and a night, and we
got 'em cornered over there in a old deserted cabin in a holler.
The boys is shootin' at 'em now. I heered you comin' up the trail
and snuck over to see who it was. Just as I said, I thought you was
Cairn. Come on with me. You can help us."</p>

<p>"I ain't no deperty," I said. "I got nothin' against Tranchler
Bixby."</p>

<p>"Well, you want to uphold the law, don't you?" he said.</p>

<p>"Naw," I said.</p>

<p>"Well, gee whiz!" he wailed. "If you ain't a hell of a citizen!
The country's goin' to the dogs. What chance has a honest man
got?"</p>

<p>"Aw, shet up," I said. "I'll go over and see the fun,
anyhow."</p>

<p>So he picked up his gun, and I tied Cap'n Kidd, and follered the
sheriff through the trees till we come to some rocks, and there was
four men laying behind them rocks and shooting down into a hollow.
The hill sloped away mighty steep into a small basin that was jest
like a bowl, with a rim of slopes all around. In the middle, of
this bowl they was a cabin and puffs of smoke was coming from the
cracks between the logs.</p>

<p>The men behind the rocks looked at me in surprise, and one of
'em said: "What the hell?"</p>

<p>The sheriff scowled at them and said, "Boys, this here is Breck
Elkins. I done already told him about us bein' a posse from Grizzly
Run, and about how we got Tarantula Bixby and two of his cutthroats
trapped in that there cabin."</p>

<p>One of the deputies bust into a loud guffaw and Hopkins glared
at him and said: "What <i>you</i> laughin' about, you spotted
hyener?"</p>

<p>"I swallered my terbaccer and that allus gives me the
hystericals," mumbled the deputy, looking the other way.</p>

<p>"Hold up yore right hand, Elkins," requested Hopkins, so I done
so, wondering what for, and he said: "Does you swear to tell the
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, e pluribus unum,
anno dominecker, to wit in status quo?"</p>

<p>"What the hell are you talkin' about?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"Them which God has j'ined asunder let no man put together,"
said Hopkins. "Whatever you say will be used agen you and the Lord
have mercy on yore soul. That means yo're a deputy. I just swore
you in."</p>

<p>"Go set on a prickly pear," I snorted disgustedly. "Go catch
yore own thieves. And don't look at me like that. I might bend a
gun over yore skull."</p>

<p>"But Elkins," pleaded Hopkins, "with yore help we can catch them
rats easy. All you got to do is lay up here behind this big rock
and shoot at the cabin and keep 'em occupied till we can sneak
around and rush 'em from the rear. See, the bresh comes down purty
close to the foot of the slope on the other side, and gives us
cover. We can do it easy, with somebody keepin' their attention
over here. I'll give you part of the reward."</p>

<p>"I don't want no derned blood-money," I said, backing away, "And
besides&mdash;<i>ow!</i>"</p>

<p>I'd absent-mindedly backed out from behind the big rock where
I'd been standing, and a .30-30 slug burned its way acrost the seat
of my britches.</p>

<p>"Dern them murderers!" I bellered, seeing red. "Gimme a rifle!
I'll learn 'em to shoot a man behind his back! Gwan, and git 'em
from behind whilst I attracts their attention with a serenade of
hot lead!"</p>

<p>"Good boy!" says Hopkins. "You'll git plenty for this!"</p>

<p>It sounded like somebody was snickering to theirselves as they
snuck away, but I give no heed. I squinted cautiously around the
big boulder and begun sniping at the cabin. All I could see to
shoot at was the puffs of smoke which marked the cracks they was
shooting through, but from the cussing and yelling which begun to
float up from the shack, I must of throwed some lead mighty close
to them.</p>

<p>They kept shooting back, and the bullets splashed and buzzed on
the rocks, and I kept looking at the further slope for some sign of
Sheriff Hopkins and the posse. But all I heard was a sound of
hosses galloping away towards the west. I wondered who it was, and
I kept expecting the posse to rush down the oppersite slope and
take them desperadoes in the rear, and whilst I was craning my neck
around a corner of the boulder&mdash;<i>whang!</i> A bullet smashed
into the rock a few inches from my face and a sliver of stone taken
a notch out of my ear. I don't know of nothing that makes me
madder'n getting shot in the ear.</p>

<p>I seen red and didn't even shoot back. A ordinary rifle was too
paltry to satisfy me. Suddenly I realized that the big boulder in
front of me was jest poised on the slope, its underside partly
embedded in the earth. I throwed down my rifle and bent my knees
and spread my arms and gripped it.</p>

<p>I shook the sweat and blood outa my eyes, and bellered so them
in the hollow could hear me: "I'm givin' you-all a chance to
surrender! Come out with yore hands up!"</p>

<p>They give loud and sarcastic jeers, and I yelled: "All right,
you ring-tailed jackasses! If you gits squashed like a pancake,
it's yore own fault. <i>Here she comes!</i>"</p>

<p>And I heaved with all I had. The veins stood out onto my
temples, and my feet sunk into the ground, but the earth bulged and
cracked all around the big rock, rivulets of dirt begun to trickle
down, and the big boulder groaned, give way and lurched over.</p>

<p>A dumbfounded yell riz from the cabin. I lept behind a bush, but
the outlaws was too surprised to shoot at me. That enormous boulder
was tumbling down the hill, crushing bushes flat and gathering
speed as it rolled. And the cabin was right in its path.</p>

<p>Wild yells bust the air, the door was throwed vi'lently open,
and a man hove into view. Jest as he started out of the door I let
<i>bam</i> at him and he howled and ducked back jest like anybody
will when a .45-90 slug knocks their hat off. The next instant that
thundering boulder hit the cabin. <i>Smash!</i> It knocked it
sidewise like a ten pin and caved in the wall, and the whole
structure collapsed in a cloud of dust and bark and splinters.</p>

<p>I run down the slope, and from the yells which issued from under
the ruins, I knowed they warn't all kilt.</p>

<p>"Does you-all surrender?" I roared.</p>

<p>"Yes, dern it!" they squalled. "Git us out from under this
landslide!"</p>

<p>"Throw out yore guns," I ordered.</p>

<p>"How in hell can we throw anything?" they hollered wrathfully.
"We're pinned down by a ton of rocks and boards and we're bein'
squoze to death. Help, murder!"</p>

<p>"Aw, shet up," I said. "You all don't hear <i>me</i> carryin' on
in no such hysterical way, does you?"</p>

<p>Well, they moaned and complained, and I sot to work dragging the
ruins offa them, which warn't no great task. Purty soon I seen a
booted laig and I laid hold of it and dragged out the critter it
was fastened to, and he looked more done up than what my brother
Buckner did that time he rassled a mountain lion for a bet. I taken
his pistol out of his belt, and laid him down on the ground and got
the others out. They was three, altogether, and I taken their arms
and laid 'em out in a row.</p>

<p>Their clothes was nearly tore off, and they was bruised and
scratched and had splinters in their hair, but they warn't hurt
permanent. They sot up and felt of theirselves, and one of 'em
said: "This here's the first earthquake I ever seen in this
country."</p>

<p>"'Twarn't no earthquake," said another'n. "It was a
avalanche."</p>

<p>"Lissen here, Joe Partland," said the first'n, grinding his
teeth. "I says it was a earthquake, and I ain't the man to be
called a liar&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you ain't, hey?" says the other'n, bristling up. "Well,
lemme tell you somethin', Frank Jackson&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This ain't no time for sech argyments," I admonished 'em
sternly. "As for that there rock, I rolled that at you-all
myself."</p>

<p>They gaped at me, and one of 'em says: "Who are you?" he says,
mopping the blood offa his ear.</p>

<p>"Never mind that," I says. "You see this here Winchester? Well,
you-all set still and rest yorselves. Soon as the sheriff gits here
I'm goin' to hand you over to him."</p>

<p>His mouth fell open. "Sheriff?" he said, dumb-like. "What
sheriff?"</p>

<p>"Dick Hopkins, from Grizzly Run," I said.</p>

<p>"Why, you demed fool!" he screamed, scrambling up.</p>

<p>"Set down!" I roared, shoving my rifle barrel at him, and he
sank back, all white and shaking. He couldn't hardly talk.</p>

<p>"Lissen to me!" he gasped. "<i>I'm</i> Dick Hopkins! <i>I'm</i>
sheriff of Grizzly Run! These men are my deputies."</p>

<p>"Yeah?" I said sarcastically. "And who was the fellers shootin'
at you from the bresh?"</p>

<p>"Tarantula Bixby and his gang," he says. "We was follerin' 'em
when they jumped us, and bein' outnumbered and surprised, we taken
cover in that old hut. They robbed the Grizzly Run bank day before
yesterday. And now they'll be gittin' further away every minute!
Oh, Judas J. Iscariot! Of all the dumb, bone- headed
jackasses&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Heh! heh! heh!" I said cynically. "You must think I ain't got
no sense. If yo're the sheriff, where at's yore star?"</p>

<p>"It was on my suspenders," he said despairingly. "When you
hauled me out by the laig my suspenders caught on somethin' and
tore off. If you'll lemme look amongst them rooins&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You set still," I commanded. "You cain't fool me. Yo're
Tranchler Bixby yoreself. Sheriff Hopkins told me so. Him and the
posse'll be here directly. Set still and shet up."</p>

<p>We stayed there, and the feller which claimed to be the sheriff
moaned and pulled his hair and shed a few tears, and the other
fellers tried to convince me they was deputies till I got tired of
their gab and told 'em to shet up or I'd bend my Winchester over
their heads. I wondered why Hopkins and them didn't come, and I
begun to get nervous, and all to onst the feller which said he was
the sheriff give a yell that startled me so I jumped and nearly
shot him. He had something in his hand and was waving it
around.</p>

<p>"See here?" he hollered so loud his voice cracked. "I found it!
It must of fell down into my shirt when my suspenders busted! Look
at it, you derned mountain grizzly!"</p>

<p>I looked and my flesh crawled. It was a shiny silver star.</p>

<p>"Hopkins said he lost his'n," I said weakly. "Maybe you found it
in the bresh."</p>

<p>"You know better!" he bellered. "Yo're one of Bixby's men. You
was left here to hold us whilst Tarantula and the rest made their
gitaway. You'll git ninety years for this!"</p>

<p>I turned cold all over as I remembered them hosses I heard
galloping. I'd been fooled! This <i>was</i> the sheriff! That
pot-bellied thug which shot at me had been Bixby hisself! And
whilst I held up the real sheriff and his posse, them outlaws was
riding out of the country! I was the prize sucker.</p>

<p>"You better gimme that gun and surrender," opined Hopkins.
"Maybe if you do they won't hang you."</p>

<p>"Set still!" I snarled. "I'm the biggest fool that ever
straddled a mustang, but even idjits has their feelin's. Pap said
never resist a officer, but this here is a special case. You ain't
goin' to put me behind no bars, jest because I made a mistake. I'm
goin' up that there slope, but I'll be watchin' you. I've throwed
yore guns over there in the bresh. If anybody makes a move towards
'em, I'll shove a harp right into his hand."</p>

<p>They set up a chant of hate as I backed away, but they sot
still. I went up the slope backwards till I hit the rim, and then I
turned and ducked into the bresh and run. I heard 'em cussing
something awful down in the hollow, but I didn't pause. I come to
where I'd left Cap'n Kidd and forked him and pulled out, being
thankful them outlaws had been in too big a hurry to steal him. But
I doubt if he'd a-let 'em. I throwed away the rifle they give me
and headed west.</p>

<p>I aimed to cross Thunder River at Ghost Canyon, and head into
the wild mountain region beyond there. I figgered I could dodge a
posse indefinite onst I got there. I let Cap'n Kidd out into a long
lope, cussing my reins which had been notched deep by Bixby's
bullet. I didn't have time to fix 'em, and Cap'n Kidd was a
iron-jawed outlaw.</p>

<p>He was sweating plenty when I finally hove in sight of the place
I was heading for. As I topped the canyon's crest before I dipped
down to the crossing, I looked back. They was a high notch in the
hills a few miles behind me, and as I looked three hossmen was
etched in that notch, lined agen the sky behind 'em. I cussed free
and fervent. Why hadn't I had sense enough to know Hopkins and his
men was bound to have hosses tied somewheres near? They got their
mounts and follered me, figgering I'd aim for the country beyond
Thunder River. It was about the only place I could go.</p>

<p>Not wanting no running fight with no sheriff's posse, I raced
recklessly down the sloping canyon wall, busted out of the
bushes&mdash;and stopped short. Thunder River was on the
rampage&mdash;bank-full in the narrow channel and boiling and
foaming. Been a cloud-bust somewhere away up on the head, and the
hoss warn't never foaled which could swum it. Not even Cap'n Kidd,
though he snorted warlike and was game to try it.</p>

<p>They wasn't but one thing to do, and I done it. I wheeled Cap'n
Kidd and headed up the canyon. Five miles up the river they was
another crossing, with a bridge&mdash;if it hadn't been washed
away. Like as not it had been, with the luck I was having. A nice
pickle Uncle Garfield's cussed watch had got me in, I reflected
bitterly. Jest when I was all sot to squelch Glory McGraw onst and
for all by marrying Ellen Reynolds, here I was throwed into
circumstances which made me a fugitive from justice. I could just
imagine Glory laughing at me, and it nigh locoed me.</p>

<p>I was so absorbed in these thoughts I paid little attention to
my imejit surroundings, but all of a sudden I heard a noise ahead,
above the roar of the river and the thunder of Cap'n Kidd's hoofs
on the rocky canyon floor. We was approaching a bend in the gorge
where a low ridge run out from the canyon wall, and beyond that
ridge I heard guns banging. I heaved back on the reins&mdash;and
both of 'em snapped in two!</p>

<p>Cap'n Kidd instantly clamped his teeth on the bit and bolted,
like he always does when he gits the chance. He headed straight for
the bushes at the end of the ridge, and I leaned forward and tried
to get hold of the bit rings with my fingers. But all I done was
swerve him from his course. Instead of follering the canyon bed on
around the end of the ridge, he went right over the rise, which
sloped on that side. It didn't slope on t'other side; it fell away
abrupt. I had a fleeting glimpse of five men crouching amongst the
bushes on the canyon floor with guns in their hands. They looked
up&mdash;and Cap'n Kidd braced his laigs and slid to a halt at the
lip of the blow bluff, and simultaneous bogged his head and throwed
me heels over head down amongst 'em.</p>

<p>My boot heel landed on somebody's head, and the spur knocked him
cold and blame near sculped him. That partly bust my fall, and it
was further cushioned by another feller which I lit on in a setting
position, and which taken no further interest in the proceedings.
But the other three fell on me with loud brutal yells, and I reched
for my .45 and found to my humiliation that it had fell out of my
scabbard when I was throwed.</p>

<p>So I riz up with a rock in my hand and bounced it offa the head
of a feller which was fixing to shoot me, and he dropped his pistol
and fell on top of it. At this juncture one of the survivors put a
buffalo gun to his shoulder and sighted, then evidently fearing he
would hit his companion which was carving at me on the other side
with a bowie knife, he reversed it and run in swinging it like a
club.</p>

<p>The man with the knife got in a slash across my ribs and I then
hit him on the chin which was how his jawbone got broke in four
places. Meanwhile the other'n swung at me with his rifle, but
missed my head and broke the stock off across my shoulder.
Irritated at his persistency in trying to brain me with the barrel,
I laid hands on him and throwed him head-on agen the bluff, which
is when he got his fractured skull and concussion of the brain, I
reckon.</p>

<p>I then shaken the sweat outa my eyes, and glaring down,
rekernized the remains as Bixby and his gang. I might have knew
they'd head for the wild country across the river, same as me. Only
place they could go.</p>

<p>Just then, however, a clump of bushes parted, nigh, the river
bank, and a big black-bearded man riz up from behind a dead hoss.
He had a six-shooter in his hand and he approached me
cautiously.</p>

<p>"Who're you?" he demanded suspiciously. "Whar'd you come
from?"</p>

<p>"I'm Breckinridge Elkins," I answered, wringing the blood outa
my shirt. "What is this here business, anyway?"</p>

<p>"I was settin' here peaceable waitin' for the river to go down
so I could cross," he says, "when up rode these yeggs and started
shootin'. I'm a honest citizen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yo're a liar," I said with my usual diplomacy. "Yo're Joel
Cairn, the wust outlaw in these hills. I seen yore picher in the
post office at Chawed Ear."</p>

<p>With that he p'inted his .45 at me and his beard bristled like
the whiskers of a old timber wolf.</p>

<p>"So you know me, hey?" he said. "Well, what you goin' to do
about it, hey? Want to colleck the reward money, hey?"</p>

<p>"Naw, I don't," I says. "I'm a outlaw myself, now. I just run
foul of the law account of these skunks. They's a posse right
behind me."</p>

<p>"They is?" he snarled. "Why'nt you say so? Here, le's catch
these fellers' hosses and light out. Cheapskates! They claims I
double-crossed 'em in the matter of a stagecoach hold-up we pulled
together recent. I been avoidin' 'em 'cause I'm a peaceful man by
nater, but they rode onto me onexpected awhile ago. They shot down
my hoss first crack; we been tradin' lead for more'n a hour,
without doin' much damage, but they'd got me eventually, I reckon.
Come on. We'll pull out together.</p>

<p>"No, we won't," I said. "I'm a outlaw by force of circumstances,
but I ain't no murderin' bandit."</p>

<p>"Purty particular of yore comperny, ain'tcha?" he sneered.
"Well, anyway, help me catch me a hoss. Yore's is still up thar on
that bluff. The day's still young&mdash;"</p>

<p>He pulled out a big gold watch and looked at it; it was one
which wound with a key.</p>

<p>I jumped like I was shot. "Where'd you git that watch?" I
hollered.</p>

<p>He jerked up his head kinda startled, and said: "My grandpap
gimme it. Why?"</p>

<p>"You're a liar!" I bellered. "You taken that off'n my Uncle
Garfield. <i>Gimme that watch!</i>"</p>

<p>"Air you crazy?" he yelled, going white under his whiskers. I
plunged for him, seeing red, and he let <i>bang!</i> and I got it
in the left thigh. Before he could shoot again I was on top of him
and knocked the gun up. It banged but the bullet went singing up
over the bluff and Cap'n Kidd squealed with rage and started
changing ends. The pistol flew outa Cairn's hand and he hit hit me
vi'lently on the nose which made me see stars. So I hit him in the
belly and he grunted and doubled up; and come up with a knife out
of his boot which he cut me acrost the boozum with, also in the arm
and shoulder and kicked me in the groin. So I swung him clear of
the ground and throwed him down headfirst and jumped on him with
both boots. And that settled his hash.</p>

<p>I picked up the watch where it had fell, and staggered over to
the cliff, spurting blood at every step like a stuck hawg.</p>

<p>"At last my search is at a end!" I panted. "I can go back to
Ellen Reynolds who patiently awaits the return of her
hero&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was at this instant that Cap'n Kidd, which had been stung by
Cairn's wild shot and was trying to buck off his saddle, bucked
hisself off the bluff. He fell on me...</p>

<p class="cpb">* * *</p>

<p>The first thing I heard was bells ringing, and then they turned
to hosses galloping. I sot up and wiped off the blood which was
running into my eyes from where Cap'n Kidd's left hind shoe had
split my sculp. And I seen Sheriff Hopkins, Jackson and Partland
come tearing around the ridge. I tried to get up and run, but my
right laig wouldn't work. I reched for my gun and it still wasn't
there. I was trapped.</p>

<p>"Look there!" yelled Hopkins, plumb wild-eyed. "That's Bixby on
the ground&mdash;and all his gang! And ye gods, there's Joel Cairn!
What is this, anyway? It looks like a battle-field! What's that
settin' there? He's so bloody I cain't rekernize him!"</p>

<p>"It's the hillbilly!" yelped Jackson. "Don't move or I'll
shoot'cha!"</p>

<p>"I already been shot," I snarled. "Gwan&mdash;do yore wust. Fate
is agen me."</p>

<p>They dismounted and stared in awe.</p>

<p>"Count the dead, boys," said Hopkins in a still, small
voice.</p>

<p>"Aw," said Partland, "ain't none of 'em dead, but they'll never
be the same men again. Look! Bixby's comin' to! Who done this,
Bixby?"</p>

<p>Bixby cast a wabbly eye about till he spied me, and then he
moaned and shrivelled up. "He tried to sculp me!" he wailed. "He
ain't human!"</p>

<p>They all looked at me, and all taken their hats off.</p>

<p>"Elkins," says Hopkins in a tone of reverence, "I see it all
now. They fooled you into thinkin' they was the posse and we was
the outlaws, didn't they? And when you realized the truth, you
hunted 'em down, didn't you? And cleaned 'em out single-handed, and
Joel Cairn, too, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Well," I said groggily, "the truth is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We understand," Hopkins soothed. "You mountain men is all
modest. Hey, boys, tie up them outlaws whilst I look at Elkins'
wounds."</p>

<p>"If you'll catch my hoss," I said, "I got to be ridin'
back&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gee whiz, man!" he said, "you ain't in no shape to ride a hoss!
Do you know you got five busted ribs and a fractured arm, and one
laig broke and a bullet in the other'n, to say nothin' of bein'
slashed to ribbons? We'll rig up a litter for you. What's that you
got in yore good hand?"</p>

<p>I suddenly remembered Uncle Garfield's watch which I'd kept
clutched in a death grip. I stared at what I held in my hand; and I
fell back with a low moan. All I had in my hand was a bunch of
busted metal and broken wheels and springs, bent and smashed plumb
beyond recognition.</p>

<p>"Grab him!" yelled Hopkins. "He's fainted!"</p>

<p>"Plant me under a pine tree, boys," I murmured weakly. "Just
kyarve onto my tombstone: 'He fit a good fight but Fate dealt him
the joker.'"</p>

<p class="cpb">* * *</p>

<p>A few days later a melancholy procession wound its way up the
trail to Bear Creek. I was being toted on a litter. I told 'em I
wanted to see Ellen Reynolds before I died, and to show Uncle
Garfield the rooins of the watch so he'd know I done my duty as I
seen it.</p>

<p>When we'd got to within a few miles of my home cabin, who should
meet us but Jim Braxton, which tried to conceal his pleasure when I
told him in a weak voice that I was a dying man. He was all dressed
up in new buckskins and his exuberance was plumb disgustful to a
man in my condition.</p>

<p>"Too bad," says he. "Too bad, Breckinridge. I hoped to meet you,
but not like this, of course. Yore pap told me to tell you about
yore Uncle Garfield's watch if I seen you. He thought I might run
into you on my way to Chawed Ear to git a licence&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hey?" I said, pricking up my ears.</p>

<p>"Yeah, me and Ellen Reynolds is goin' to git married," he says.
"Well, as I started to say, seems like one of them bandits which
robbed the stage was a feller whose dad was a friend of yore Uncle
Garfield's back in Texas. He rekernized the name in the watch and
sent it back, and it got here the day after you left&mdash;"</p>

<p>They say it was jealousy which made me rise up on my litter and
fracture Jim Braxton's jawbone. I denies that. I stoops to no sech
petty practices. What impelled me was family conventions. I
couldn't hit Uncle Garfield; I had to hit somebody; and Jim Braxton
jest happened to be the only man in rech.</p>

<h2><a id="gent5" name="gent5">5. A GENT FROM BEAR CREEK</a>
</h2>

<p style="text-indent:0">"YOU," says my sister Ouachita, p'inting a
accusing finger at me, "ought a be shot for the way you treat Glory
McGraw!"</p>

<p>"Don't mention that gal's name to me," I says bitterly. "I don't
want to hear nothin' about her. Don't talk to me about
her&mdash;why you think I ain't treated her right?"</p>

<p>"Well," says Ouachita, "after they brung you back from Chawed
Ear lookin' like you'd been through a sorghum mill, Glory come
right over when she heered you was hurt. And what did you do when
she come through the door?"</p>

<p>"I didn't do nothin'," I says. "What'd I do?"</p>

<p>"You turnt over towards the wall," says Ouachita, "and you says,
says you: 'Git that woman outa here; she's come to t'ant me in my
helpless condition!'"</p>

<p>"Well, she did!" I said fiercely.</p>

<p>"She didn't!" says Ouachita. "When she heered you say them
words, she turnt pale, and she turnt around and walked outa the
cabin with her head up in the air, not sayin' a word. And she ain't
been back since."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't want her to," I says. "She come over here jest to
gloat on my misery."</p>

<p>"I don't believe no such," says Ouachita. "First thing she says,
was: 'Is Breckinridge hurt bad?' And she didn't say it in no
gloatin' way. She come over here to help you, I bet, and you talked
to her like that! You ought to be ashamed."</p>

<p>"You mind yore own business," I advised her, and got up and got
outa the cabin to get some peace and quiet.</p>

<p>I went towards the creek aiming to do a little fishing. My laig
had knit proper and quick, and that had been the only thing which
had kept me laid up. On my way to the creek I got to thinking over
what Ouachita had said, and I thought, well, maybe I was a mite
hasty. Maybe Glory did repent of her treatment of me when I was
laying wounded. Maybe I ought not to of spoke so bitterly.</p>

<p>I thought, it's no more'n my neighborly duty to go over and
thank Glory for coming over to see me, and tell her I didn't mean
what I said. I'd tell her I was delirious and thought it was Ellen
Reynolds. After all, I was a man with a great, big, generous,
forgiving heart, and if forgiving Glory McGraw was going to
brighten her life, why, I warn't one to begrudge it. So I headed
for the McGraw cabin&mdash;a trail I hadn't took since the day I
shot up Mister Wilkinson.</p>

<p>I went afoot because I wanted to give my laig plenty of exercise
now it was healed. And I hadn't gone more'n halfway when I met the
gal I was looking for. She was riding her bay mare, and we met face
to face right spang in the middle of the trail. I taken off my
Stetson and says: "Howdy, Glory. You warn't by any chance headin'
for my cabin?"</p>

<p>"And why should I be headin' for yore cabin, Mister Elkins?" she
said as stiff and cold as a frozen bowie knife.</p>

<p>"Well," I said, kinda abashed, "well&mdash;uh&mdash;that is,
Glory, I jest want to thank you for droppin' in to see about me
when I was laid up, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I didn't," she snapped. "I jest come to borrer some salt. I
didn't even know you'd been hurt."</p>

<p>"What you want to talk like that for, Glory?" I protested. "I
didn't aim to hurt yore feelin's. Fact is, I war delirious, and
thought you was somebody else&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ellen Reynolds, maybe?" says she sneeringly. "Or was she
already there, holdin' yore hand? Oh, no! I'd plumb forgot! She was
gittin' married to Jim Braxton about that time! Too bad,
Breckinridge! But cheer up! Ellen's got a little sister which'll be
growed up in a few years. Maybe you can git her&mdash;if some
Braxton don't beat you to her."</p>

<p>"To hell with the Braxtons and the Reynolds too!" I roared,
seeing red again. "And you can go along with 'em, far's I'm
consarned! I was right! Ouachita's a fool, sayin' you was sorry for
me. You jest come over there to gloat over me when I was laid
up!"</p>

<p>"I didn't!" she says, in a changed voice.</p>

<p>"You did, too!" I says bitterly. "You go yore way and I'll go
mine. You think I cain't git me no woman, just because you and
Ellen Reynolds turned me down. Well, you-all ain't the only women
they is! I ain't goin' to marry no gal on Bear Creek! I'm goin' to
git me a town-gal!"</p>

<p>"A town-gal wouldn't look at a hillbilly like you!" she
sneered.</p>

<p>"Oh, is that so?" I bellered, convulsively jerking some saplings
up by the roots in my agitation. "Well, lemme tell you somethin',
<i>Miss</i> McGraw, I'm pullin' out right now, this very day, for
the settlements, where purty gals is thick as flies in watermelon
time, and I aim to bring back the purtiest one of the whole
kaboodle! You wait and see!"</p>

<p>And I went storming away from there so blind mad that I fell
into the creek before I knowed it, and made a most amazing splash.
I thought I heard Glory call me to come back, jest before I fell,
but I was so mad I didn't pay no attention. I'd had about all the
badgering I could stand for one day. I clumb out on t'other side,
dripping like a muskrat, and headed for the tall timber. I could
hear her laughing behind me, and she must of been kinda hysterical,
because it sounded like she was crying instead of laughing, but I
didn't stop to see. All I wanted was to put plenty of distance
between me and Glory McGraw, and I headed for home as fast as I
could laig it.</p>

<p>It was my fullest intention to saddle Cap'n Kidd and pull out
for Chawed Ear or somewheres as quick as I could. I meant what I
said about getting me a town-gal. But right then I was fogging
head-on into the cussedest mix-up I'd ever saw, up to that time,
and didn't know it. I didn't even get a inkling of it when I almost
stumbled over a couple of figures locked in mortal combat on the
bank of the creek.</p>

<p>I was surprised when I seen who it was. The folks on Bear Creek
ain't exactly what you'd call peaceable by nature, but Erath Elkins
and his brother- in-law Joel Gordon had always got along well
together, even when they was full of corn juice. But there they
was, so tangled up they couldn't use their bowies to no advantage,
and their cussin' was scandalous to hear.</p>

<p>Remonstrances being useless, I kicked their knives out of their
hands and throwed 'em bodily into the creek. That broke their holds
and they come swarming out with blood-thirsty shrieks and dripping
whiskers, and attacked me. Seeing they was too blind mad to have
any sense, I bashed their heads together till they was too dizzy to
do anything but holler.</p>

<p>"Is this any way for relatives to ack?" I ast disgustedly.</p>

<p>"Lemme at him!" howled Joel, gnashing his teeth whilst blood
streamed down his whiskers. "He's broke three of my fangs and I'll
have his life!"</p>

<p>"Stand aside, Breckinridge!" raved Erath. "No man can chaw a ear
offa me and live to tell the tale."</p>

<p>"Aw, shet up," I snorted. "Ca'm down, before I sees is yore fool
heads harder'n this." I brandished a large fist under their noses
and they subsided sulkily. "What's all this about?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"I jest discovered my brother-in-law is a thief," said Joel
bitterly. At that Erath give a howl and a vi'lent plunge to get at
his relative, but I kind of pushed him backwards, and he fell over
a willer stump.</p>

<p>"The facks is, Breckinridge," says Joel, "me and this here
polecat found a buckskin poke full of gold nuggets in a holler oak
over on Apache Ridge yesterday, right nigh the place whar yore
brother Garfield fit them seven wildcats last year. We didn't know
whether somebody in these parts had jest hid it thar for
safe-keepin', or whether some old prospector had left it thar a
long time ago and maybe got sculped by the Injuns and never come
back to git it. We agreed to leave it alone for a month, and if it
was still thar when we come back, we'd feel purty shore that the
original owner was dead, and we'd split the gold between us. Well,
last night I got to worryin' lest somebody'd find it which warn't
as honest as me, so this mornin' I thought I better go see if it
was still thar..."</p>

<p>At this p'int Erath laughed bitterly.</p>

<p>Joel glared at him ominously and continued: "Well, no sooner I
hove in sight of the holler tree than this skunk let go at me from
the bresh with a rifle-gun&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's a lie!" yelped Erath. "It war jest the other way
around!"</p>

<p>"Not bein' armed, Breckinridge," Joel said with dignity, "and
realizin' that this coyote was tryin' to murder me so he could
claim all the gold, I laigged it for home and my weppin's. And
presently I sighted him sprintin' through the bresh after me."</p>

<p>Erath begun to foam slightly at the mouth. "I warn't chasin'
you!" he howled. "I war goin' home after my rifle-gun."</p>

<p>"What's yore story, Erath?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Last night I drempt somebody had stole the gold," he answered
sullenly. "This mornin' I went to see if it was safe. Jest as I got
to the tree, this murderer begun shootin' at me with a Winchester.
I run for my life, and by some chance I finally run right into him.
Likely he thought he'd hived me and was comin' for the sculp."</p>

<p>"Did either one of you see t'other'n shoot at you?" I ast.</p>

<p>"How could I, with him hid in the bresh?" snapped Joel. "But who
else could it been?"</p>

<p>"I didn't have to see him," growled Erath. "I felt the wind of
his lead."</p>

<p>"But each one of you says he didn't have no rifle," I said.</p>

<p>"He's a cussed liar," they accused simultaneous, and would have
fell onto each other tooth and nail if they could have got past my
bulk. "I'm convinced they'd been a mistake," I said. "Git home and
cool off."</p>

<p>"Yo're too big for me to lick, Breckinridge," said Erath. "But I
warn you, if you cain't prove to me that it warn't Joel which tried
to murder me, I ain't goin' to rest nor sleep nor eat till I've
nailed his mangy sculp to the highest pine on Apache Ridge."</p>

<p>"That goes for me, too," says Joel, grinding his teeth. "I'm
declarin' truce till tomorrer mornin'. If Breckinridge cain't show
me by then that you didn't shoot at me, either my wife or yore'n'll
be a widder before midnight."</p>

<p>So saying they stalked off in oppersite directions, whilst I
stared helplessly after 'em, slightly dazed at the responsibility
which had been dumped onto me. That's the drawback of being the
biggest man in yore settlement. All the relatives piles their
trouble onto you. Here it was up to me to stop what looked like the
beginnings of a regular family feud which was bound to reduce the
population awful. I couldn't go sparking me no town-gal with all
this hell brewing.</p>

<p>The more I thought of the gold them idjits had found, the more I
felt like I ought to go and take a look at it myself, so I went
back to the corral and saddled Cap'n Kidd and lit out for Apache
Ridge. From the remarks they'd let fall whilst cussing each other,
I had a purty good idee where the holler oak was at, and sure
enough I found it without much trouble. I tied Cap'n Kidd and clumb
up onto the trunk till I reched the holler. And then as I was
craning my neck to look in, I heard a voice say: "Another dern
thief!"</p>

<p>I looked around and seen Uncle Jeppard Grimes p'inting a gun at
me.</p>

<p>"Bear Creek is goin' to hell," says Uncle Jeppard. "First it was
Erath and Joel, and now it's you. I aim to throw a bullet through
yore hind laig jest to teach you a little honesty. Hold still
whilst I draws my bead."</p>

<p>With that he started sighting along the barrel of his
Winchester, and I says: "You better save yore lead for that Injun
over there."</p>

<p>Him being a old Injun fighter he jest naturally jerked his head
around quick, and I pulled my .45 and shot the rifle out of his
hands. I jumped down and put my foot on it, and he pulled a knife
out of his leggin', and I taken it away from him and shaken him
till he was so addled when I let him go he run in a circle and fell
down cussing something terrible.</p>

<p>"Is everybody on Bear Creek gone crazy?" I demanded. "Cain't a
man look into a holler tree without gittin' assassinated?"</p>

<p>"You was after my gold!" swore Uncle Jeppard.</p>

<p>"So it's yore gold, hey?" I said. "Well, a holler tree ain't no
bank."</p>

<p>"I know it," he growled, combing the pine-needles out of his
whiskers. "When I come here early this mornin' to see if it was
safe, like I frequent does, I seen right off somebody'd been
handlin' it. Whilst I was meditatin' over this, I seen Joel Gordon
sneakin' towards the tree. I fired a shot acrost his bows in
warnin' and he run off. But a few minutes later here come Erath
Elkins slitherin' through the pines. I was mad by this time, so I
combed his whiskers with a chunk of lead and <i>he</i> high-tailed
it. And now, by golly, here you come&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You shet up!" I roared. "Don't you accuse me of wantin' yore
blame gold. I jest wanted to see if it was safe, and so did Joel
and Erath. If them men was thieves, they'd have took it when they
found it yesterday. Where'd you git it, anyway?"</p>

<p>"I panned it, up in the hills," he said sullenly. "I ain't had
time to take it to Chawed Ear and git it changed into cash money. I
figgered this here tree was as good a place as any. But I done put
it elsewhar now."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "you got to go tell Erath and Joel it war you
which shot at 'em, so they won't kill each other. They'll be mad at
you, but I'll restrain 'em, with a hickery club, if necessary."</p>

<p>"All right," he said. "I'm sorry I misjedged you, Breckinridge.
Jest to show I trusts you, I'll show you whar I hid it after I
taken it outa the tree."</p>

<p>He led me through the trees till he come to a big rock jutting
out from the side of a cliff, and p'inted at a smaller rock wedged
beneath it.</p>

<p>"I pulled out that there rock," he said, "and dug a hole and
stuck the poke in. Look!"</p>

<p>He heaved the rock out and bent down. And then he went straight
up in the air with a yell that made me jump and pull my gun with
cold sweat busting out all over me.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" I demanded. "Air you snake-bit!"</p>

<p>"Yeah, by human snakes!" he hollered. "<i>It's gone!</i> I been
robbed!"</p>

<p>I looked and seen the impressions the wrinkles in the buckskin
poke had made in the soft earth. But there warn't nothing there
now.</p>

<p>Uncle Jeppard was doing a scalp dance with a gun in one hand and
a bowie knife in the other'n. "I'll fringe my leggin's with their
mangy sculps! I'll pickle their hearts in a barr'l of brine! I'll
feed their gizzards to my houn' dawgs!" he yelled.</p>

<p>"Whose gizzards?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Whose, you idjit?" he howled. "Joe Gordon and Erath Elkins,
dern it! They didn't run off. They snuck back and seen me move the
gold! War-paint and rattlesnakes! I've kilt better men than them
for less'n half that much!"</p>

<p>"Aw," I said, "t'ain't possible they stole yore gold&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then whar is it?" he demanded bitterly. "Who else knowed about
it?"</p>

<p>"Look here!" I said, p'inting to a belt of soft loam nigh the
rocks. "There's a hoss's tracks."</p>

<p>"Well, what of it?" he demanded. "Maybe they had hosses tied in
the bresh."</p>

<p>"Aw, no," I said. "Look how the calks is sot. They ain't no
hosses on Bear Creek shod like that. These is the tracks of a
stranger&mdash;I bet the feller I seen ride past my cabin jest
about daybreak. A black-whiskered man with one ear missin'. That
hard ground by the big rock don't show where he got off and stomped
around, but the man which rode this hoss stole yore gold, I'll bet
my guns."</p>

<p>"I ain't convinced," says Uncle Jeppard. "I'm goin' home and ile
my rifle-gun, and then I'm goin' to go over and kill Joel and
Erath."</p>

<p>"Now you lissen," I said forcibly, taking hold of the front of
his buckskin shirt and h'isting him off the ground by way of
emphasis, "I know what a stubborn old jassack you are, Uncle
Jeppard, but this time you got to lissen to reason, or I'll forgit
myself to the extent of kickin' the seat out of yore britches. I'm
goin' to foller this feller and take yore gold away from him,
because I know it war him that stole it. And don't you dare to kill
nobody till I git back."</p>

<p>"I'll give you till tomorrer mornin'," he compromised. "I won't
pull a trigger till then. But," said Uncle Jeppard waxing poetical,
"if my gold ain't in my hands by the time the mornin' sun h'ists
itself over the shinin' peaks of the Jackass Mountains, the
buzzards will rassle their hash on the carcasses of Joel Gordon and
Erath Elkins."</p>

<p>I went away from there, and mounted Cap'n Kidd and headed west
on the stranger's trail. A hell of a chance <i>I</i> had to go
sparking a town-gal, with my lunatickal relatives thirsting for
each other's gore.</p>

<p>It was still tolerably early in the morning, and one of them
long summer days ahead of me. They warn't a hoss in the Humbolts
which could equal Cap'n Kidd for endurance. I've rode him a hundred
miles between sundown and sunup. But the hoss the stranger was
riding must have been some chunk of hoss-meat hisself, and of
course he had a long start of me. The day wore on, and still I
hadn't come up with my man. I'd covered a lot of distance and was
getting into country I warn't familiar with, but I didn't have no
trouble follering his trail, and finally, late in the evening, I
come out on a narrer dusty path where the calk-marks of his hoss's
shoes was very plain.</p>

<p>The sun sunk lower and my hopes dwindled. Even if I got the
thief and got the gold, it'd be a awful push to get back to Bear
Creek in time to prevent mayhem. But I urged on Cap'n Kidd, and
presently we come out into a road, and the tracks I was follering
merged with a lot of others. I went on, expecting to come to some
settlement, and wondering jest where I was.</p>

<p>Jest at sundown I rounded a bend in the road and I seen
something hanging to a tree, and it was a man. They was another man
in the act of pinning something to the corpse's shirt, and when he
heard me he wheeled and jerked his gun&mdash;the man, I mean, not
the corpse. He was a mean looking cuss, but he warn't Black
Whiskers. Seeing I made no hostile motion, he put up his gun and
grinned.</p>

<p>"That feller's still kickin'?" I said.</p>

<p>"We just strung him up," he said. "The other boys has rode back
to town, but I stayed to put this warnin' on his buzzum. Can you
read?"</p>

<p>"No," I said.</p>

<p>"Well," says he, "this here paper says: 'Warnin' to all outlaws
and specially them on Grizzly Mountain&mdash;Keep away from
Wampum.'"</p>

<p>"How far's Wampum from here?" I ast.</p>

<p>"Half a mile down the road," he said. "I'm Al Jackson, one of
Bill Ormond's deputies. We aim to clean up Wampum. This is one of
them outlaws which has denned up on Grizzly Mountain."</p>

<p>Before I could say anything more, I heard somebody breathing
quick and gaspy, and they was a patter of bare feet in the bresh,
and a kid gal about fourteen years old bust into the road.</p>

<p>"You've killed Uncle Joab!" she shrieked. "You murderers! A boy
told me they was fixin' to hang him! I run as fast as I
could&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Git away from that corpse!" roared Jackson, hitting at her with
his quirt.</p>

<p>"You stop that!" I ordered. "Don't you hit that young 'un."</p>

<p>"Oh, please, Mister!" she wept, wringing her hands. "You ain't
one of Ormond's men. Please help me! He ain't dead&mdash;I seen him
move!"</p>

<p>Waiting for no more I spurred alongside the body and drawed my
knife.</p>

<p>"Don't you cut that rope!" squawked the deputy, jerking his gun.
So I hit him under the jaw and knocked him out of his saddle and
into the bresh beside the road where he lay groaning. I then cut
the rope and eased the hanged man down onto my saddle and got the
noose offa his neck. He was purple in the face and his eyes was
closed and his tongue lolled out, but he still had some life in
him. Evidently they didn't drop him, but jest hauled him up to
strangle to death.</p>

<p>I laid him on the ground and worked over him till some of his
life begun to come back to him, but I knowed he ought to have
medical attention, so I said: "Where's the nearest doctor?"</p>

<p>"Doc Richards in Wampum," whimpered the kid. "But if we take him
there Ormond'll git him again. Won't you please take him home?"</p>

<p>"Where you-all live?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"We been livin' in a cabin on Grizzly Mountain every since
Ormond run us out of Wampum," she whimpered.</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "I'm goin' to put yore uncle onto Cap'n Kidd and
you can set behind the saddle and help hold him on, and tell me
which way to go."</p>

<p>I done this and Cap'n Kidd didn't like it none, but after I
busted him between the ears with the butt of my six-shooter he
subsided and come along sulkily as I led him. As we went I seen
that deputy Jackson drag hisself out of the bresh and go limping
down the road holding onto his jaw.</p>

<p>I was losing a awful lot of time, but I couldn't leave this
feller to die, even if he was a outlaw, because probably the little
gal didn't have nobody else to take care of her but him.</p>

<p>It was well after dark when we come up a narrer trail that wound
up a thickly timbered mountain side, and purty soon somebody in a
thicket ahead of us hollered: "Halt whar you be or I'll shoot!"</p>

<p>"Don't shoot, Jim!" called the gal. "This is Betty, and we're
bringin' Uncle Joab home."</p>

<p>A tall hard-looking young feller stepped out into the open,
p'inting his Winchester at me. He cussed when he seen our load.</p>

<p>"He ain't dead," I said. "But we oughta git him to his
cabin."</p>

<p>So Jim led the way through the thickets till we come into a
clearing where they was a cabin and a woman come running out and
screamed like a catamount when she seen Joab. Me and Jim lifted him
off and toted him in and laid him on a bunk, and the women begun to
work over him, and I went out to my hoss, because I was in a hurry
to get gone. Jim follered me.</p>

<p>"This is the kind of stuff we've been havin' ever since Ormond
come to Wampum," he says bitterly. "We been livin' up here like
rats, afeared to stir in the open. I warned Joab agen slippin' down
into the village to-day, but he was sot on it, and wouldn't let
none of the boys go with him. Said he'd sneak in and git what he
wanted and sneak out again."</p>

<p>"Well," I says, "what's yore business ain't none of mine. But
this here life is hard lines on the women and chillern."</p>

<p>"You must be a friend of Joab's," he said. "He sent a man east
some days ago, but we was afraid one of Ormond's men trailed him
and killed him. But maybe he got through. Air you the man Joab sent
for?"</p>

<p>"Meanin' am I some gunman come in to clean up the town?" I
snorted. "Naw, I ain't. I never seen this feller Joab before."</p>

<p>"Well," says Jim, "cutting him down like you done has already
got you in bad with Ormond. Whyn't you help us run them fellers out
of the country? They's still a good many of us in these hills, even
if we have been run out of Wampum. This hangin' is the last straw.
I'll round up the boys tonight, and we'll have a show-down with
Ormond's men. We're outnumbered, and we been licked bad onst
before, but we'll try it again. Why don't you throw in with
us?"</p>

<p>"Lissen," I says, climbing into the saddle, "jest because I cut
down a outlaw ain't no sign I'm ready to be one myself. I done it
jest because I couldn't stand to see the little gal take on so.
Anyway, I'm lookin' for a feller with black whiskers and one ear
missin' which rides a roan with a big Lazy-A brand."</p>

<p>Jim fell back from me and lifted his rifle. "You better ride on,
then," he said sombrely. "I'm obleeged to you for what you've
did&mdash;but a friend of Wolf Ashley cain't be no friend of
our'n."</p>

<p>I give him a snort of defiance and rode off down the mountains
and headed for Wampum, because it was reasonable to suppose that
maybe I'd find Black Whiskers there.</p>

<p>Wampum warn't much of a town, but they was one big saloon and
gambling hall where sounds of hilarity was coming from, and not
many people on the streets and them which was mostly went in a
hurry. I stopped one of them and ast him where a doctor lived, and
he p'inted out a house where he said Doc Richards lived, so I rode
up to the door and hollered, and somebody inside said: "What do you
want? I got you covered."</p>

<p>"Air you Doc Richards?" I said, and he said: "Yes, keep your
hands away from your belt or I'll salivate you."</p>

<p>"This is a nice, friendly town!" I snorted. "I ain't figgerin'
on doin' you no harm. They's a man up in the hills which needs yore
attention."</p>

<p>At that the door opened and a man with red whiskers and a
shotgun stuck his head out and said: "Who do you mean?"</p>

<p>"They call him Joab," I said. "He's on Grizzly Mountain."</p>

<p>"Hmmmmm!" said Doc Richards, looking at me very sharp where I
sot Cap'n Kidd in the starlight. "I set a man's jaw tonight, and he
had a good deal to say about a certain party who cut down a man
that was hanged. If you happen to be that party, my advice to you
is to hit the trail before Ormond catches you."</p>

<p>"I'm hungry and thirsty and I'm lookin' for a man," I said. "I
aim to leave Wampum when I'm good and ready."</p>

<p>"I never argue with a man as big as you," said Doc Richards.
"I'll ride to Grizzly Mountain as quick as I can get my horse
saddled. If I never see you alive again, which is very probable,
I'll always remember you as the biggest man I ever saw, and the
biggest fool. Good night!"</p>

<p>I thought the folks in Wampum is the queerest acting I ever
seen. I taken Cap'n Kidd to the barn which served as a livery
stable and seen that he was properly fixed in a stall to hisself,
as far away from the other hosses as I could get him, because I
knowed if he got to 'em he'd chaw the ears off 'em. The barn didn't
look strong enough to hold him, but I told the livery stable man to
keep him occupied with fodder, and to run for me if he got
rambunctious. Then I went into the big saloon which was called the
Golden Eagle. I was low in my spirits because I seemed to have lost
Black Whiskers' trail entirely, and even if I found him in Wampum,
which I hoped, I never could make it back to Bear Creek by sunup.
But I hoped to recover that derned gold yet, and get back in time
to save a few lives, anyway.</p>

<p>They was a lot of tough looking fellers in the Golden Eagle
drinking and gambling and talking loud and cussing, and they all
stopped their noise as I come in, and looked at me very fishy. But
I give 'em no heed and went up to the bar, and purty soon they
kinda forgot about me, and the racket started up again.</p>

<p>Whilst I was drinking me a few fingers of whisky, somebody
shouldered up to me and said: "Hey!" I turnt around and seen a big,
broad-built man with a black beard and blood-shot eyes and a
pot-belly and two guns on.</p>

<p>I says: "Well?"</p>

<p>"Who air you?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Who air you?" I come back at him.</p>

<p>"I'm Bill Ormond, sheriff of Wampum," he says. "That's who!" And
he showed me a star onto his shirt.</p>

<p>"Oh," I says. "Well, I'm Breckinridge Elkins, from Bear
Creek."</p>

<p>I noticed a kind of quiet come over the place, and fellers was
laying down their glasses and their billiard sticks, and hitching
up their belts and kinda gathering around me. Ormond scowled and
combed his beard with his fingers, and rocked on his heels and
said: "I got to 'rest you!"</p>

<p>I sot down my glass quick and he jumped back and hollered:
"Don't you dast pull no gun on the law!" And they was a kind of
movement amongst the men around me.</p>

<p>"What you arrestin' me for?" I demanded. "I ain't busted no
law."</p>

<p>"You assaulted one of my deperties," he said, and then I seen
that feller Jackson standing behind the sheriff with his jaw all
bandaged up. He couldn't work his chin to talk. All he could do was
p'int his finger at me and shake his fists.</p>

<p>"You likewise cut down a outlaw we had just hunged," says
Ormond. "Yo're under arrest!"</p>

<p>"But I'm lookin' for a man!" I protested. "I ain't got time to
be arrested!"</p>

<p>"You should of thunk about that when you busted the law," opined
Ormond. "Gimme yore gun and come along peaceable."</p>

<p>A dozen men had their hands on their guns, but it warn't that
which made me give in. Pap had always told me not to resist no
officer of the law. It was kind of instinctive for me to hand over
my gun to this feller with the star on his shirt. Somehow it didn't
seem right, but I was kind of bewildered and my thoughts was
addled. I ain't one of these fast thinking sharps. So I jest done
what pap always told me to do.</p>

<p>Ormond taken me down the street a-ways, with a whole bunch of
men follering us, and stopped at a log building with barred winders
which was next to a board shack. A man come out of this shack with
a big bunch of keys, and Ormond said he was the jailer. So they put
me in the log jail and Ormond went off with everybody but the
jailer, who sot down on the step outside his shack and rolled
hisself a cigaret.</p>

<p>They warn't no light in the jail, but I found the bunk and tried
to lay down on it, but it warn't built for a man six and a half
foot tall. I sot down on it and at last realized what a infernal
mess I was in. Here I ought to be hunting Black Whiskers and
getting the gold to take back to Bear Creek and save the lives of a
swarm of my kin-folks, but instead of that I was in jail, and no
way of getting out without killing a officer of the law. With
daybreak Joel and Erath would be at each others' throats, and Uncle
Jeppard would be gunning for both of 'em. It was too much to hope
that the other relatives would let them three fight it out amongst
theirselves. I never seen sech a clan for buttin' into each others'
business. The guns would be talking all up and down Bear Creek, and
the population would be decreasing with every volley. I thunk about
it till I got dizzy and then the jailer stuck his head up to the
winder and said if I'd give him five dollars he'd go get me
something to eat.</p>

<p>I had five dollars I won in a poker game a few days before and I
give it to him, and he went off and was gone quite a spell, and at
last he come back and give me a ham sandwich. I ast him was that
all he could get for five dollars, and he said grub was awful high
in Wampum. I et the sandwich with one bite, and he said if I'd give
him some more money he'd get me another sandwich. But I didn't have
no more and told him so.</p>

<p>"What!" he said, breathing licker fumes in my face through the
winder bars. "No money? And you expect us to feed you for nothin'?"
So he cussed me, and went off, and purty soon the sheriff come and
looked in at me, and said: "What's this I hear about you not havin'
no money?"</p>

<p>"I ain't got none left," I said, and he cussed something
fierce.</p>

<p>"How you expeck to pay yore fine?" he demanded. "You think you
can lay up in our jail and eat us out of house and home? What kind
of a critter are you, anyway?"</p>

<p>Just then the jailer chipped in and said somebody told him I had
a hoss down at the livery stable.</p>

<p>"Good," said the sheriff. "We'll sell his hoss for his
fine."</p>

<p>"You won't neither," I says, beginning to get mad. "You try to
sell Cap'n Kidd, and I'll forgit what pap told me about
law-officers, and take you plumb apart."</p>

<p>I riz up and glared at him through the winder, and he fell back
and put his hand on his gun. But jest about that time I seen a man
going into the Golden Eagle which was in easy sight of the jail,
and lit up so the light streamed out into the street. I give a yell
that made Ormond jump about a foot. It was Black Whiskers!</p>

<p>"Arrest that man, Sheriff!" I hollered. "He's a thief!"</p>

<p>Ormond whirled and looked, and then he said: "Air you plumb
crazy? That's Wolf Ashley, my deperty."</p>

<p>"I don't give a dern," I said. "He stole a poke of gold from my
Uncle Jeppard Grimes up in the Humbolts, and I've trailed him clean
from Bear Creek. Do yore duty and arrest him."</p>

<p>"You shet up!" roared Ormond. "You cain't tell me my business! I
ain't goin' to arrest my best gunman&mdash;my star deperty, I mean.
What you mean tryin' to start trouble this way? One more yap outa
you and I'll throwa chunk of lead through you."</p>

<p>And he turned around and stalked off muttering: "Poke of gold,
huh? Holdin' out on me, is he? I'll see about that!"</p>

<p>"I sot down and held my head in bewilderment. What kind of a
sheriff was this which wouldn't arrest a derned thief? My thoughts
run in circles till my wits was addled. The jailer had gone off and
I wondered if he had went to sell Cap'n Kidd. I wondered what was
going on back on Bear Creek, and I shivered to think what would
bust loose at daybreak. And here I was in jail, with them fellers
fixing to sell my hoss, whilst that dern thief swaggered around at
large. I looked helplessly out a the winder.</p>

<p>It was getting late, but the Golden Eagle was going full blast.
I could hear the music blaring away, and the fellers yipping and
shooting their pistols in the air, and their boot heels stomping on
the board walk. I felt like busting down and bawling, and then I
begun to get mad. I get mad slow, generally, and before I was plumb
mad, I heard a noise at the winder.</p>

<p>I seen a pale face staring in at me, and a couple of small white
hands on the bars.</p>

<p>"Mister!" a voice whispered. "Oh, Mister!"</p>

<p>I stepped over and looked out and it was the kid gal Betty.</p>

<p>"What you doin' here, gal?" I ast.</p>

<p>"Doc Richards said you was in Wampum," she whispered. "He said
he was afraid Ormond would do for you because you helped us, so I
slipped away on his hoss and rode here as hard as I could. Jim was
out tryin' to round up the boys for a last stand, and Aunt Rachel
and the other women was busy with Uncle Joab. They wasn't nobody
but me to come, but I had to! You saved Uncle Joab, and I don't
care if Jim does say yo're a outlaw because yo're a friend of Wolf
Ashley. Oh, I wish't I wasn't jest a gal! I wisht I could shoot a
gun, so's I could kill Bill Ormond!"</p>

<p>"That ain't no way for a gal to talk," I says. "Leave the
killin' to the men. But I appreciates you goin' to all this
trouble. I got some kid sisters myself&mdash;in fact I got seven or
eight, as near as I remember. Don't you worry none about me. Lots
of men gits throwed in jail."</p>

<p>"But that ain't it!" she wept, wringing her hands. "I listened
outside the winder of the back room in the Golden Eagle and heard
Ormond and Ashley talkin' about you. I dunno what you wanted with
Ashley when you ast Jim about him, but he ain't yo're friend.
Ormond accused him of stealin' a poke of gold and holdin' out on
him, and Ashley said it was a lie. Then Ormond said you told him
about it, and he said he'd give Ashley till midnight to perjuice
that gold, and if he didn't Wampum would be too small for both of
'em."</p>

<p>"Then he went out to the bar, and I heered Ashley talkin' to a
pal of his'n, and Ashley said he'd have to raise some gold somehow,
or Ormond would have him killed, but that he was goin' to fix
<i>you,</i> Mister, for lyin' about him. Mister, Ashley and his
bunch air over in the back of the Golden Eagle right now plottin'
to bust into jail before daylight and hang you!"</p>

<p>"Aw," I says, "the sheriff wouldn't let 'em do that."</p>

<p>"But Ormond ain't the sheriff!" she cried. "Him and his gunmen
come into Wampum and killed all the people that tried to oppose
him, or run 'em up into the hills. They got us penned up there like
rats, nigh starvin' and afeared to come to town. Uncle Joab come
into Wampum this mornin' to git some salt, and you seen what they
done to him. <i>He's</i> the real sheriff. Ormond is jest a bloody
outlaw. Him and his gang is usin' Wampum for a hang-out whilst they
rob and steal and kill all over the country."</p>

<p>"Then that's what yore friend Jim meant," I said slowly. "And
me, like a dumb damn' fool, I thought him and Joab and the rest of
you-all was jest outlaws, like that fake deperty said."</p>

<p>"Ormond took Uncle Joab's badge and called hisself the sheriff
to fool strangers," she whimpered. "What honest people is left in
Wampum air afeared to say anything. Him and his gunmen air rulin'
this whole part of the country. Uncle Joab sent a man east to git
us some help in the settlements on Buffalo River, but none never
come, and from what I overheard tonight, I believe Wolf Ashley
follered him and killed him over east of the Humbolts somewheres.
What air we goin' to do?" she sobbed.</p>

<p>"Git on Doc Richards' hoss and ride for Grizzly Mountain," I
said. "When you git there, tell the Doc to light a shuck for
Wampum, because there's goin' to be plenty of work for him time he
gits here."</p>

<p>"But what about you?" she cried. "I cain't go off and leave you
to git hanged!"</p>

<p>"Don't worry about me, gal," I said. "I'm Breckinridge Elkins of
the Humbolt Mountains, and I'm preparin' for to shake my mane!
Hustle!"</p>

<p>I reckon something about me convinced her, because she glided
away into the shadders, whimpering, and presently I heard the clack
of hoss' hoofs dwindling in the distance. I then riz and laid hold
of the winder bars and tore' em out by the roots. Then I sunk my
fingers into the sill log and tore it out, and three or four more
along with it, and the wall give way and the roof fell down on me,
but I shaken aside the rooins and heaved up out of the wreckage
like a b'ar out of a deadfall.</p>

<p>About this time the jailer come running up, and when he seen
what I had did he was so surprised he forgot to shoot with his
pistol. So I taken it away from him and knocked down the door of
his shack with him and left him laying in its rooins.</p>

<p>I then strode up the street towards the Golden Eagle and here
come a feller galloping down the street, and who should it be but
that derned fake deputy, Jackson. He couldn't holler with his
bandaged jaw, but when he seen me he jerked loose his lariat and
piled it around my neck, and sot spurs to his cayuse aiming for to
drag me to death. But I seen he had his rope tied fast to his horn,
Texas style, so I laid hold onto it with both hands and braced my
laigs, and when the hoss got to the end of the rope, the girths
busted and the hoss went out from under the saddle, and Jackson
come down on his head in the street and laid still.</p>

<p>I throwed the rope off my neck and went onto the Golden Eagle
with the jailer's .45 in my scabbard. I looked in and seen the same
crowd there, and Ormond r'ared back at the bar with his belly stuck
out, roaring and bragging.</p>

<p>I stepped in and hollered: "Look this way, Bill Ormond, and pull
iron, you dirty thief!"</p>

<p>He wheeled, paled, and went for his gun, and I slammed six
bullets into him before he could hit the floor. I then throwed the
empty gun at the dazed crowd and give one deafening roar and tore
into 'em like a mountain cyclone. They begun to holler and surge
onto me and I throwed 'em and knocked 'em right and left like ten
pins. Some was knocked over the bar and some under the tables and
some I knocked down stacks of beer kegs with. I ripped the roulette
wheel loose and mowed down a whole row of 'em with it, and I
throwed a billiard table through the mirror behind the bar jest for
good measure. Three or four fellers got pinned under it and yelled
bloody murder.</p>

<p>Meanwhile they was hacking at me with bowies and hitting me with
chairs and brass knuckles and trying to shoot me, but all they done
with their guns was shoot each other because they was so many they
got in each other's way, and the other things just made me madder.
I laid hands on as many as I could hug at onst, and the thud of
their heads banging together was music to me. I also done good work
heaving 'em head-on agen the walls, and I further slammed several
of 'em heartily agen the floor and busted all the tables with their
carcasses. In the melee the whole bar collapsed, and the shelves
behind the bar fell down when I slang a feller into 'em, and
bottles rained all over the floor. One of the lamps also fell off
the ceiling which was beginning to crack and cave in, and everybody
begun to yell: "Fire!" and run out through the doors and jump out
the winders.</p>

<p>In a second I was alone in the blazing building except for them
which was past running. I'd started for a door myself when I seen a
buckskin pouch on the floor along with a lot of other belongings
which had fell out of men's pockets as they will when the men gets
swung by the feet and smashed agen the wall.</p>

<p>I picked it up and jerked the tie-string, and a trickle of gold
dust spilt into my hand. I begun to look on the floor for Ashley,
but he warn't there. But he was watching me from outside, because I
looked and seen him jest as he let <i>bam</i> at me with a .45 from
the back room which warn't on fire much yet. I plunged after him,
ignoring his next slug which took me in the shoulder, and then I
grabbed him and taken the gun away from him. He pulled a bowie and
tried to stab me in the groin, but only sliced my thigh, so I
throwed him the full length of the room and he hit the wall so hard
his head went through the boards.</p>

<p>Meantime the main part of the saloon was burning so I couldn't
go out that way. I started to go out the back door of the room I
was in, but got a glimpse of some fellers which was crouching jest
outside the door waiting to shoot me as I come out. So I knocked
out a section of the wall on another side of the room, and about
that time the roof fell in so loud them fellers didn't hear me
coming, so I fell on 'em from the rear and beat their heads
together till the blood ran out of their ears, and stomped 'em and
taken their shotguns away from 'em.</p>

<p>Then I was aware that people was shooting at me in the light of
the burning saloon, and I seen that a bunch was ganged up on the
other side of the street, so I begun to loose my shotguns into the
thick of them, and they broke and run yelling blue murder.</p>

<p>And as they went out one side of the town, another gang rushed
in from the other, yelling and shooting, and I snapped a empty
shell at 'em before one yelled: "Don't shoot, Elkins! We're
friends!" And I seen it was Jim and Doc Richards, and a lot of
other fellers I hadn't never seen before then.</p>

<p>They went tearing after Ormond's gang, whooping and yelling, and
the way them outlaws took to the tall timber was a caution. They
warn't no fight left in 'em at all.</p>

<p>Jim pulled up, and looked at the wreckage of the jail, and the
remnants of the Golden Eagle, and he shook his head like he
couldn't believe it.</p>

<p>"We was on our way to make a last effort to take the town back
from that gang," says he. "Betty met us as we come down the trail
and told us you was a friend and a honest man. We hoped to git here
in time to save you from gittin' hanged." Again he shaken his head
with a kind of bewildered look. Then he says "Oh, say, I'd about
forgot. On our way here we run onto a man on the road who said he
was lookin' for you. Not knowin' who he was, we roped him and brung
him along with us. Bring the prisoner, boys!"</p>

<p>They brung him, tied to his saddle, and it was Jack Gordon,
Joel's youngest brother and the fastest gunslinger on Bear
Creek.</p>

<p>"What you doin' houndin' me?" I demanded bitterly. "Has the feud
begun already and has Joel sot you on <i>my</i> trail? Well, I got
what I come after, and I'm headin' back for Bear Creek. I cain't
git there by daylight, but maybe I'll git there in time to keep
everybody from gittin' kilt. Here's Uncle Jeppard's cussed gold!"
And I waved the poke in front of him.</p>

<p>"But that cain't be it!" says he. "I been trailin' you all the
way from Bear Creek, tryin' to catch you and tell you the gold had
been found! Uncle Jeppard and Joel and Erath got together and
everything was explained and is all right. Where'd you git that
gold?"</p>

<p>"I dunno whether Ashley's pals got it together so he could give
it to Ormond and not git kilt for holdin' out on his boss, or
what," I says. "But I know the owner ain't got no more use for it
now, and probably stole it in the first place. I'm givin' this gold
to Betty," I says. "She shore deserves a reward. And giving it to
her makes me feel like maybe <i>some</i> good come outa this wild
goose chase, after all."</p>

<p>Jim looked around at the ruins of the outlaw hangout, and
murmured something I didn't catch. I says to Jack: "You said Uncle
Jeppard's gold was found. Where was it, anyway?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Jack, "little General William Harrison Grimes,
Joash Grimes's youngest boy, he seen his grand-pap put the gold
under the rock, and he got it out to play with it. He was usin' the
nuggets for slugs in his nigger-shooter," Jack said, "and it's
plumb cute the way he pops a rattlesnake with 'em. What did you
say?"</p>

<p>"Nothin'," I said between my teeth. "Nothin' that'd be fit to
repeat, anyway."</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "if you've had yore fun, I reckon yo're ready
to start back to Bear Creek with me."</p>

<p>"<i>I reckon I ain't</i>," I said. "I'm goin' to 'tend to my own
private affairs for a change. I told Glory McGraw early this
mornin' I was goin' to git me a town-gal, and by golly, I meant it.
Gwan on back to Bear Creek, and if you see Glory, tell her I'm
headin' for Chawed Ear where the purty gals is as thick as honey
bees around a apple tree."</p>

<br>

<h2><a id="gent6" name="gent6">6. THE FEUD BUSTER</a>
</h2>

<p style="text-indent:0">I PULLED out of Wampum before sunup. The
folks, wanted me to stay and be a deputy sheriff, but I taken a
good look at the female population and seen that the only single
woman in town was a Piute squaw. So I headed acrost the mountains
for Chawed Ear, swinging wide to avoid coming anywheres nigh to the
Humbolts. I didn't want to chance running into Glory McGraw before
I had me a town-gal.</p>

<p>But I didn't get to Chawed Ear nigh as soon as I'd figgered to.
As I passed through the hills along the head-waters of Mustang
River, I run into a camp of cowpunchers from the Triple L which was
up there rounding up strays. The foreman needed some hands, and I
happened to think maybe I'd cut a better figger before the Chawed
Ear belles if'n I had some money in my pocket, so I taken on with
them. After he seen me and Cap'n Kidd do one day's work the foreman
'lowed that they warn't no use in hiring the six or seven other men
he aimed; he said I filled the bill perfect.</p>

<p>So I worked with 'em three weeks, and then collected my pay and
pulled for Chawed Ear.</p>

<p>I was all primed for the purty settlement-gals, little suspected
the jamboree I was riding into blind, the echoes of which ain't yet
quit circulating through the mountain country. And that reminds me
to remark that I'm sick and tired of the slanders which has been
noised abroad about that there affair, and if they don't stop, I'll
liable to lose my temper, and anybody in the Humbolts can tell you
when I loses my temper the effect on the population is wuss'n fire,
earthquake and cyclone.</p>

<p>First-off, it's a lie that I rode a hundred miles to mix into a
feud which wasn't none of my business. I never heard of the
Warren-Barlow war before I come into the Mezquital country. I hear
tell the Barlows is talking about suing me for destroying their
property. Well, they ought to build their cabins solider if they
don't want 'em tore down. And they're all liars when they says the
Warrens hired me to exterminate 'em at five dollars a sculp. I
don't believe even a Warren would pay five dollars for one of their
mangy sculps. Anyway, I don't fight for hire for nobody, and the
Warrens needn't belly-ache about me turnin' on 'em and trying to
massacre the entire clan. All I wanted to do was kind of disable
'em so they couldn't interfere with my business. And my business,
from first to last, was defending the family honor. If I had to
wipe up the earth with a couple of feuding clans whilst so doing, I
cain't help it. Folks which is particular of their hides ought to
stay out of the way of tornadoes, wild bulls, devastating torrents
and a insulted Elkins.</p>

<p>This is the way it was: I was dry and hot and thirsty when I hit
Chawed Ear, so I went into a saloon and had me a few drinks. Then I
was going out and start looking for a gal, when I spied a friendly
game of kyards going on between a hoss-thief and three
train-robbers, and I decided I'd set in for a hand or so. And
whilst we was playing, who should come in but Uncle Jeppard Grimes.
I should of knew my day was spoilt the minute he hove in sight.
Dern near all the calamities which takes place in southern Nevada
can be traced back to that old lobo. He's got a ingrown disposition
and a natural talent for pestering his feller man. Specially his
relatives.</p>

<p>He didn't say a word about that wild goose chase I went on to
get back the gold I thought Wolf Ashley had stole from him. He come
over and scowled down on me like I was the missing lynx or
something, and purty soon, jest as I was all sot to make a killing,
he says: "How can you set there so free and keerless, with four
aces into yore hand, when yore family name is bein'
besmirched?"</p>

<p>I flang down my hand in annoyance, and said: "Now look what you
done! What you mean blattin' out information of sech a private
nature? What you talkin' about, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Well," he says, "durin' the time you been away from home
roisterin' and wastin' yore substance in riotous livin'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I been punchin' cows!" I said fiercely. "And before that I was
chasin' a man to git back the gold I thought he'd stole from you. I
ain't squandered nothin' nowheres. Shet up and tell me whatever
yo're a-talkin' about."</p>

<p>"Well," says he, "whilst you been gone young Dick Blanton of
Grizzly Run has been courtin' yore sister Elinor, and the family's
been expectin' 'em to set the day, any time now. But now I hear
he's been braggin' all over Grizzly Run about how he done jilted
her. Air you goin' to set there and let yore sister become the
laughin' stock of the country? When I was a young man&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When you was a young man Dan'l Boone warn't whelped yet!" I
bellered, so mad I included him and everybody else in my
irritation. They ain't nothing upsets me like injustice done to
some of my close kin. "Git out of my way! I'm headin' for Grizzly
Run&mdash;what <i>you</i> grinnin' at, you spotted hyener?" This
last was addressed to the hoss-thief in which I seemed to detect
signs of amusement.</p>

<p>"I warn't grinnin'," he said.</p>

<p>"So I'm a liar, I reckon!" I said, impulsively shattering a
demi-john over his head, and he fell under the table hollering
bloody murder, and all the fellers drinking at the bar abandoned
their licker and stampeded for the street hollering: "Take cover,
boys! Breckinridge Elkins is on the rampage!"</p>

<p>So I kicked all the slats out of the bar to relieve my feelings,
and stormed out of the saloon and forked Cap'n Kidd. Even he seen
it was no time to take liberties with me; he didn't pitch but seven
jumps, and then he settled down to a dead run, and we headed for
Grizzly Run.</p>

<p>Everything kind of floated in a red haze all the way, but them
folks which claims I tried to murder' em in cold blood on the road
between Chawed Ear and Grizzly Run is jest narrer-minded and
super-sensitive. The reason I shot off everybody's hats that I met
was jest to kind of ca'm my nerves, because I was afeared if I
didn't cool off some by the time I hit Grizzly Run I might hurt
somebody. I'm that mild-mannered and retiring by nature that I
wouldn't willing hurt man, beast, nor Injun unless maddened beyond
all endurance.</p>

<p>That's why I acted with so much self-possession and dignity when
I got to Grizzly Run and entered the saloon where Dick Blanton
generally hung out.</p>

<p>"Where's Dick Blanton?" I demanded, and everybody must of been
nervous, because when I boomed out they all jumped and looked
around, and the bartender dropped a glass and turned pale.</p>

<p>"Well," I hollered, beginning to lose patience. "Where is the
coyote?"</p>

<p>"G-gimme time, will ya?" stuttered the bar-keep.
"I&mdash;uh&mdash;he&mdash;uh&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Evadin' the question, hey?" I said, kicking the foot-rail
loose. "Friend of his'n, hey? Tryin' to pertect him, hey?" I was so
overcome by this perfidy that I lunged for him and he ducked down
behind the bar and I crashed into it bodily with all my lunge and
weight, and it collapsed on top of him, and all the customers run
out of the saloon hollering: "Help, murder, Elkins is killin' the
bartender!"</p>

<p>That individual stuck his head up from amongst the rooins of the
bar and begged: "For God's sake, lemme alone! Blanton headed south
for the Mezquital Mountains yesterday."</p>

<p>I throwed down the chair I was fixing to bust all the ceiling
lamps with, and run out and jumped on Cap'n Kidd and headed south,
whilst behind me folks emerged from their cyclone cellars and sent
a rider up in the hills to tell the sheriff and his deputies they
could come on back now.</p>

<p>I knowed where the Mezquitals was, though I hadn't never been
there. I crossed the Californy line about sundown, and shortly
after dark I seen Mezquital Peak looming ahead of me. Having ca'med
down somewhat, I decided to stop and rest Cap'n Kidd. He warn't
tired, because that hoss has got alligator blood in his veins, but
I knowed I might have to trail Blanton clean to The Angels, and
they warn't no use in running Cap'n Kidd's laigs off on the first
lap of the chase.</p>

<p>It warn't a very thick settled country I'd come into, very
mountainous and thick timbered, but purty soon I come to a cabin
beside the trail and I pulled up and hollered: "Hello!"</p>

<p>The candle inside was instantly blowed out, and somebody pushed
a rifle barrel through the winder and bawled: "Who be you?"</p>

<p>"I'm Breckinridge Elkins from Bear Creek, Nevada," I said. "I'd
like to stay all night, and git some feed for my hoss."</p>

<p>"Stand still," warned the voice. "We can see you agen the stars,
and they's four rifle-guns a-kiverin' you."</p>

<p>"Well, make up yore minds," I said, because I could could hear
'em discussin' me. I reckon they thought they was whispering. One
of 'em said: "Aw, he cain't be a Barlow. Ain't none of 'em that
big." T'other'n said: "Well, maybe he's a derned gunfighter they've
sent for to help 'em. Old Jake's nephew's been up in Nevady."</p>

<p>"Le's let him in," says a third. "We can mighty quick tell what
he is."</p>

<p>So one of 'em come out and 'lowed it would be all right for me
to stay the night, and he showed me a corral to put Cap'n Kidd in,
and hauled out some hay for him.</p>

<p>"We got to be keerful," he said. "We got lots of enemies in
these hills."</p>

<p>We went into the cabin, and they lit the candle again, and sot
some corn pone and sow-belly and beans on the table and a jug of
corn licker. They was four men, and they said their names was
Warren&mdash;George, Ezra, Elisha, and Joshua, and they was
brothers. I'd always heard tell the Mezquital country was famed for
big men, but these fellers warn't so big&mdash;not much over six
foot high apiece. On Bear Creek they'd been considered kind of puny
and undersized, so to speak.</p>

<p>They warn't very talkative. Mostly they sot with their rifles
acrost their knees and looked at me without no expression onto
their faces, but that didn't stop me from eating a hearty supper,
and would of et a lot more only the grub give out; and I hoped they
had more licker somewheres else because I was purty dry. When I
turned up the jug to take a snort it was brim-full, but before I'd
more'n dampened my gullet the dern thing was plumb empty.</p>

<p>When I got through I went over and sot down on a raw-hide
bottomed chair in front of the fire-place where they warn't no fire
because it was summer time, and they said: "What's yore business,
stranger?"</p>

<p>"Well," I said, not knowing I was going to get the surprise of
my life, "I'm lookin' for a feller named Dick Blanton&mdash;"</p>

<p>By golly, the words warn't clean out of my mouth when they was
four men onto my neck like catamounts!</p>

<p>"He's a spy!" they hollered. "He's a cussed Barlow! Shoot him!
Stab him! Hit him on the head!"</p>

<p>All of which they was endeavoring to do with such passion they
was getting in each other's way, and it was only his over-eagerness
which caused George to miss me with his bowie and sink it into the
table instead, but Joshua busted a chair over my head and Elisha
would of shot me if I hadn't jerked back my head so he jest singed
my eyebrows. This lack of hospitality so irritated me that I riz up
amongst 'em like a b'ar with a pack of wolves hanging onto him, and
commenced committing mayhem on my hosts, because I seen right off
they was critters which couldn't be persuaded to respect a guest no
other way.</p>

<p>Well, the dust of battle hadn't settled, the casualities was
groaning all over the place, and I was jest relighting the candle
when I heard a hoss galloping up the trail from the south. I
wheeled and drawed my guns as it stopped before the cabin. But I
didn't shoot, because the next instant they was a bare-footed gal
standing in the door. When she seen the rooins she let out a
screech like a catamount.</p>

<p>"You've kilt 'em!" she screamed. "You murderer!"</p>

<p>"Aw, I ain't, neither," I said. "They ain't hurt much&mdash;jest
a few cracked ribs and dislocated shoulders and busted laigs and
sech-like trifles. Joshua's ear'll grow back on all right, if you
take a few stitches into it."</p>

<p>"You cussed Barlow!" she squalled, jumping up and down with the
hystericals. "I'll kill you! You damned Barlow!"</p>

<p>"I ain't no Barlow, dern it," I said. "I'm Breckinridge Elkins,
of Bear Creek. I ain't never even heard of no Barlows."</p>

<p>At that George stopped his groaning long enough to snarl: "If
you ain't a friend of the Barlows, how come you askin' for Dick
Blanton? He's one of 'em."</p>

<p>"He jilted my sister!" I roared. "I aim to drag him back and
make him marry her."</p>

<p>"Well, it was all a mistake," groaned George. "But the damage is
done now."</p>

<p>"It's wuss'n you think," said the gal fiercely. "The Warrens has
all forted theirselves over at pap's cabin, and they sent me to git
you boys. We got to make a stand. The Barlows is gatherin' over to
Jake Barlow's cabin, and they aims to make a foray onto us tonight.
We was outnumbered to begin with, and now here's our best fightin'
men laid out! Our goose is cooked plumb to hell!"</p>

<p>"Lift me onto my hoss," moaned George. "I cain't walk, but I can
still shoot." He tried to rise up, and fell back cussing and
groaning.</p>

<p>"You got to help us!" said the gal desperately, turning to me.
"You done laid out our four best fightin' men, and you owes it to
us. It's yore duty! Anyway, you says Dick Blanton's yore
enemy&mdash;well, he's Jake Barlow's nephew, and he come back here
to help 'em clean out us Warrens. He's over to Jake's cabin right
now. My brother Bill snuck over and spied on 'em, and he says every
fightin' man of the clan is gatherin' there. All we can do is hold
the fort, and you got to come help us hold it! Yo're nigh as big as
all four of these boys put together."</p>

<p>Well, I figgered I owed the Warrens something, so, after setting
some bones and bandaging some wounds and abrasions of which they
was a goodly lot, I saddled Cap'n Kidd and we sot out.</p>

<p>As we rode along she said: "That there is the biggest, wildest,
meanest-lookin' critter I ever seen. Is he actually a hoss, or some
kind of a varmint?"</p>

<p>"He's a hoss," I said. "But he's got painter's blood and a
shark's disposition. What's this here feud about?"</p>

<p>"I dunno," she said. "It's been goin' on so long everybody's
done forgot what started it. Somebody accused somebody else of
stealin' a cow, I think. What's the difference?"</p>

<p>"They ain't none," I assured her. "If folks wants to have feuds
it's their own business."</p>

<p>We was follering a winding path, and purty soon we heard dogs
barking and about that time the gal turned aside and got off her
hoss, and showed me a pen hid in the bresh. It was full of
hosses.</p>

<p>"We keep our mounts here so's the Barlows ain't so likely to
find 'em and run 'em off," she said, and she turnt her hoss into
the pen, and I put Cap'n Kidd in, but I tied him over in one corner
by hisself&mdash;otherwise he would of started fighting all the
other hosses and kicked the fence down.</p>

<p>Then we went on along the path and the dogs barked louder and
purty soon we come to a big two-story cabin which had heavy
board-shutters over the winders. They was jest a dim streak of
candle light come through the cracks. It was dark, because the moon
hadn't come up. We stopped in the shadders of the trees, and the
gal whistled like a whippoorwill three times, and somebody answered
from up on the roof. A door opened a crack in a room which didn't
have no light at all, and somebody said: "That you, Elizerbeth? Air
the boys with you?"</p>

<p>"It's me," says she, starting towards the door. "But the boys
ain't with me."</p>

<p>Then all to onst he throwed open the door and hollered: "Run,
gal! They's a grizzly b'ar standin' up on his hind laigs right
behind you!"</p>

<p>"Aw, that ain't no b'ar," says she. "That there's Breckinridge
Elkins, from up in Nevady. He's goin' to help us fight the
Barlows."</p>

<p>We went on into a room where they was a candle on the table, and
they was nine or ten men there and thirty-odd women and chillern.
They all looked kinda pale and scairt, and the men was loaded down
with pistols and Winchesters.</p>

<p>They all looked at me kind of dumb-like, and the old man kept
staring at me like he warn't any too sure he hadn't let a grizzly
in the house, after all. He mumbled something about making a
natural mistake, in the dark, and turnt to the gal, and demanded:
"Whar's the boys I sent you after?"</p>

<p>And she says: "This gent mussed 'em up so's they ain't fitten
for to fight. Now, don't git rambunctious, Pap. It war jest a
honest mistake all around. He's our friend, and he's gunnin' for
Dick Blanton."</p>

<p>"Ha! Dick Blanton!" snarled one of the men, lifting his
Winchester. "Jest lemme line my sights on him! I'll cook his
goose!"</p>

<p>"You won't, neither," I said. "He's got to go back to Bear Creek
and marry my sister Elinor. Well," I says, "what's the
campaign?"</p>

<p>"I don't figger they'll git here till well after midnight," said
Old Man Warren. "All we can do is wait for 'em."</p>

<p>"You means you all sets here and waits till they comes and lays
siege?" I says.</p>

<p>"What else?" says he. "Lissen here, young man, don't start
tellin' me how to conduck a feud. I growed up in this here'n. It
war in full swing when I was born, and I done spent my whole life
carryin' it on."</p>

<p>"That's jest it," I snorted. "You lets these dern wars drag on
for generations. Up in the Humbolts we bring sech things to a quick
conclusion. Mighty nigh everybody up there come from Texas,
original, and we fights our feuds Texas style, which is short and
sweet&mdash;a feud which lasts ten years in Texas is a humdinger.
We winds 'em up quick and in style. Where-at is this here cabin
where the Barlows is gatherin'?"</p>

<p>"'Bout three mile over the ridge," says a young feller they
called Bill.</p>

<p>"How many is they?" I ast.</p>

<p>"I counted seventeen," says he.</p>

<p>"Jest a fair-sized mouthful for a Elkins," I said. "Bill, you
guide me to that there cabin. The rest of you can come or stay, it
don't make no difference to me."</p>

<p>Well, they started jawing with each other then. Some was for
going and some for staying. Some wanted to go with me, and try to
take the Barlows by surprise, but the others said it couldn't be
done&mdash;they'd git ambushed theirselves, and the only sensible
thing to be did was to stay forted and wait for the Barlows to
come. They given me no more heed&mdash;jest sot there and
augered.</p>

<p>But that was all right with me. Right in the middle of the
dispute, when it looked like maybe the Warrens would get to
fighting among theirselves and finish each other before the Barlows
could get there, I lit out with the boy Bill, which seemed to have
considerable sense for a Warren.</p>

<p>He got him a hoss out of the hidden corral, and I got Cap'n
Kidd, which was a good thing. He'd somehow got a mule by the neck,
and the critter was almost at its last gasp when I rescued it. Then
me and Bill lit out.</p>

<p>We follered winding paths over thick-timbered mountainsides till
at last we come to a clearing and they was a cabin there, with
light and profanity pouring out of the winders. We'd been hearing
the last mentioned for half a mile before we sighted the cabin.</p>

<p>We left our hosses back in the woods a ways, and snuck up on
foot and stopped amongst the trees back of the cabin.</p>

<p>"They're in there tankin' up on corn licker to whet their
appertites for Warren blood!" whispered Bill, all in a shiver.
"Lissen to 'em! Them fellers ain't hardly human! What you goin' to
do? They got a man standin' guard out in front of the door at the
other end of the cabin. You see they ain't no doors nor winders at
the back. They's winders on each side, but if we try to rush it
from the front or either side, they'll see us and fill us full of
lead before we could git in a shot. Look! The moon's comin' up.
They'll be startin' on their raid before long."</p>

<p>I'll admit that cabin looked like it was going to be harder to
storm than I'd figgered. I hadn't had no idee in mind when I sot
out for the place. All I wanted was to get in amongst them
Barlows&mdash;I does my best fighting at close quarters. But at the
moment I couldn't think of no way that wouldn't get me shot up. Of
course I could jest rush the cabin, but the thought of seventeen
Winchesters blazing away at me from close range was a little stiff
even for me, though I was game to try it, if they warn't no other
way.</p>

<p>Whilst I was studying over the matter, all to onst the hosses
tied out in front of the cabin snorted, and back up in the hills
something went <i>Oooaaaw- w-w!</i> And a idee hit me.</p>

<p>"Git back in the woods and wait for me," I told Bill, as I
headed for the thicket where we'd left the hosses.</p>

<p>I rode up in the hills towards where the howl had come from, and
purty soon I lit and throwed Cap'n Kidd's reins over his head, and
walked on into the deep bresh, from time to time giving a long
squall like a cougar. They ain't a catamount in the world can tell
the difference when a Bear Creek man imitates one. After awhile one
answered, from a ledge jest a few hundred feet away.</p>

<p>I went to the ledge and clumb up on it, and there was a small
cave behind it, and a big mountain lion in there. He give a grunt
of surprise when he seen I was a human, and made a swipe at me, but
I give him a bat on the head with my fist, and whilst he was still
dizzy I grabbed him by the scruff of the neck and hauled him out of
the cave and lugged him down to where I left my hoss.</p>

<p>Cap'n Kidd snorted when he seen the cougar and wanted to kick
his brains out, but I give him a good kick in the stummick hisself,
which is the only kind of reasoning Cap'n Kidd understands, and got
on him and headed for the Barlow hangout.</p>

<p>I can think of a lot more pleasant jobs than totin' a
full-growed mountain lion down a thick-timbered mountainside on the
back of a iron-jawed outlaw at midnight. I had the cat by the back
of the neck with one hand, so hard he couldn't squall, and I held
him out at arm's length as far from me and the hoss as I could, but
every now and then he'd twist around so he could claw Cap'n Kidd
with his hind laigs, and when this would happen Cap'n Kidd would
squall with rage and start bucking all over the place. Sometimes he
would buck the derned cougar onto me, and pulling him loose from my
hide was wuss'll pulling cockle-burrs out of a cow's tail.</p>

<p>But presently I arriv close behind the cabin. I whistled like a
whippoorwill for Bill, but he didn't answer and warn't nowheres to
be seen, so I decided he'd got scairt and pulled out for home. But
that was all right with me. I'd come to fight the Barlows, and I
aimed to fight 'em, with or without assistance. Bill would jest of
been in the way.</p>

<p>I got off in the trees back of the cabin and throwed the reins
over Cap'n Kidd's head, and went up to the back of the cabin on
foot, walking soft and easy. The moon was well up, by now, and what
wind they was, was blowing towards me, which pleased me, because I
didn't want the hosses tied out in front to scent the cat and start
cutting up before I was ready.</p>

<p>The fellers inside was still cussing and talking loud as I
approached one of the winders on the side, and one hollered out:
"Come on! Le's git started! I craves Warren gore!" And about that
time I give the cougar a heave and throwed him through the
winder.</p>

<p>He let out a awful squall as he hit, and the fellers in the
cabin hollered louder'n he did. Instantly a most awful bustle broke
loose in there and of all the whooping and bellering and shooting I
ever heard, and the lion squalling amongst it all, and clothes and
hides tearing so you could hear it all over the clearing, and the
hosses busting loose and tearing out through the bresh.</p>

<p>As soon as I hove the cat I run around to the door and a man was
standing there with his mouth open, too surprised at the racket to
do anything. So I taken his rifle away from him and broke the stock
off on his head, and stood there at the door with the barrel
intending to brain them Barlows as they run out. I was plumb
certain they <i>would</i> run out, because I have noticed that the
average man is funny that way, and hates to be shet up in a cabin
with a mad cougar as bad as the cougar would hate to be shet up in
a cabin with a infuriated settler of Bear Creek.</p>

<p>But them scoundrels fooled me. 'Pears like they had a secret
door in the back wall, and whilst I was waiting for them to storm
out through the front door and get their skulls cracked, they
knocked the secret door open and went piling out that way.</p>

<p>By the time I realized what was happening and run around to the
other end of the cabin, they was all out and streaking for the
trees, yelling blue murder, with their clothes all tore to shreds
and them bleeding like stuck hawgs.</p>

<p>That there catamount sure improved the shining hours whilst he
was corralled with them Barlows. He come out after 'em with his
mouth full of the seats of their britches, and when he seen me he
give a kind of despairing yelp and taken out up the mountain with
his tail betwixt his laigs like the devil was after him with a
red-hot branding iron.</p>

<p>I taken after the Barlows, sot on scuttling at least a few of
'em, and I was on the p'int of letting <i>bam</i> at 'em with my
six-shooters as they run, when, jest as they reched the trees, all
the Warren men riz out of the bresh and fell on 'em with piercing
howls.</p>

<p>That fray was kind of pecooliar. I don't remember a single shot
being fired. The Barlows had all dropped their guns in their
flight, and the Warrens seemed bent on wiping out their wrongs with
their bare fists and gun butts. For a few seconds they was a hell
of a scramble&mdash;men cussing and howling and bellering, and
rifle-stocks cracking over heads, and the bresh crashing underfoot,
and then before I could get into it, the Barlows broke every which-
way and took out through the woods like jack-rabbits squalling
Jedgment Day.</p>

<p>Old Man Warren come prancing out of the bresh waving his
Winchester and his beard flying in the moonlight and he hollered:
"The sins of the wicked shall return onto 'em! Elkins, we have hit
a powerful lick for righteousness this here night!"</p>

<p>"Where'd you all come from?" I ast. "I thought you was still
back in yore cabin chawin' the rag."</p>

<p>"Well," he says, "after you pulled out we decided to trail along
and see how you come out with whatever you planned. As we come
through the woods expectin' to git ambushed every second, we met
Bill here who told us he believed you had a idee of circumventin'
them devils, though he didn't know what it war. So we come on and
hid ourselves at the aidge of the trees to see what'd happen. I see
we been too timid in our dealin's with these heathens. We been
lettin' 'em force the fightin' too long. You was right. A good
offence is the best defence."</p>

<p>"We didn't kill any of the varmints, wuss luck, but we give 'em
a prime lickin'. Hey, look there!" he hollered. "The boys has
caught one of the critters! Lug him into the cabin, boys!"</p>

<p>They done so, and by the time me and the old man got there, they
had the candles lit, and a rope around the Barlow's neck and one
end throwed on a rafter.</p>

<p>That cabin was a sight, all littered with broke guns and
splintered chairs and tables, and pieces of clothes and strips of
hide. It looked jest about like a cabin ought to look where they
has jest been a fight between seventeen polecats and a mountain
lion. It was a dirt floor, and some of the poles which helped hold
up the roof was splintered, so most of the weight was resting on a
big post in the centre of the hut.</p>

<p>All the Warrens was crowding around their prisoner, and when I
looked over their heads and seen the feller's pale face in the
light of the candle I give a yell: "Dick Blanton!"</p>

<p>"So it is!" said Old Man Warren, rubbing his hands with glee.
"So it is! Well, young feller, you got any last words to
orate?"</p>

<p>"Naw," said Blanton sullenly. "But if it hadn't been for that
derned lion spilin' our plans we'd of had you derned Warrens like
so much pork. I never heard of a cougar jumpin' through a winder
before."</p>

<p>"That there cougar didn't jump," I said, shouldering through the
mob. "He was hev. I done the heavin'."</p>

<p>His mouth fell open and he looked at me like he'd saw the ghost
of Sitting Bull. "Breckinridge Elkins!" says he. "I'm cooked now,
for sure!"</p>

<p>"I'll say you air!" gritted the feller who'd yearned to shoot
Blanton earlier in the night. "What we waitin' for? Le's string him
up."</p>

<p>"Hold on," I said. "You all cain't hang him. I'm goin' to take
him back to Bear Creek."</p>

<p>"You ain't neither," says Old Man Warren. "We're much obleeged
to you for the help you've give us tonight, but this here is the
first chance we've had to hang a Barlow in fifteen year, and we
aims to make the most of it. String him, boys!"</p>

<p>"Stop!" I roared, stepping for'ard.</p>

<p>In a second I was covered by seven rifles, whilst three men laid
hold of the rope and started to heave Blanton's feet off the floor.
Them seven Winchesters didn't stop me. I'd of taken them guns away
and wiped up the floor with them ongrateful mavericks, but I was
afeared Blanton might get hit in the wild shooting that was certain
to accompany it.</p>

<p>What I wanted to do was something which would put 'em all
horse-de-combat, as the French say, without getting Blanton killed.
So I laid hold on the center post and before they knowed what I was
doing, I tore it loose and broke it off, and the roof caved in and
the walls fell inwards on the roof.</p>

<p>In a second they warn't no cabin at all&mdash;jest a pile of
timber with the Warrens all underneath and screaming blue murder.
Of course I jest braced my laigs and when the roof fell my head
busted a hole through it, and the logs of the falling walls hit my
shoulders and glanced off, so when the dust settled I was standing
waist-deep amongst the rooins and nothing but a few scratches to
show for it.</p>

<p>The howls that riz from beneath the rooins was blood-curdling,
but I knowed nobody was hurt permanent because if they was they
wouldn't be able to howl like that. But I expect some of 'em would
of been hurt if my head and shoulders hadn't kind of broke the fall
of the roof and wall-logs.</p>

<p>I located Blanton by his voice, and pulled pieces of roof board
and logs off him until I came onto his laig, and I pulled him out
by it and laid him on the ground to get his wind back, because a
beam had fell acrost his stummick and when he tried to holler he
made the funniest noise I ever heard.</p>

<p>I then kind of rooted around amongst the debris and hauled Old
Man Warren out, and he seemed kind of dazed and kept talking about
earthquakes.</p>

<p>"You better git to work extricatin' yore misguided kin from
under them logs," I told him sternly. "After that there display of
ingratitude I got no sympathy for you. In fact, if I was a
short-tempered man I'd feel inclined to vi'lence. But bein' the
soul of kindness and generosity, I controls my emotions and merely
remarks that if I <i>wasn't</i> mild-mannered as a lamb, I'd hand
you a boot in the pants&mdash;like this!"</p>

<p>I showed him how I meant.</p>

<p><i>"Owww!"</i> wails he, sailing through the air and sticking
his nose to the hilt in the dirt.</p>

<p>"I'll have the law on you, you derned murderer!" he wept,
shaking his fists at me, and as I departed with my captive I could
hear him chanting a hymn of hate as he pulled logs off of his
bellering relatives.</p>

<p>Blanton was trying to say something, but I told him I warn't in
no mood for perlite conversation and the less he said the less
likely I was to lose my temper and tie his neck into a knot around
a blackjack. I was thinking how the last time I seen Glory McGraw I
told her I was faring forth to find me a town- gal, and now instead
of bringing a wife back to Bear Creek, I was bringing back a
brother-in-law. My relatives, I reflected bitterly, was sure
playing hell with my matrimonial plans. Looked like I warn't never
going to get started on my own affairs.</p>

<p>Cap'n Kidd made the hundred miles from the Mezquital Mountains
to Bear Creek by noon the next day, carrying double, and never
stopping to eat, sleep, nor drink. Them that don't believe that
kindly keep their mouths shet. I have already licked nineteen men
for acting like they didn't believe it.</p>

<p>I stalked into the cabin and throwed Dick Blanton down onto the
floor before Elinor which looked at him and me like she thought I
was crazy.</p>

<p>"What you finds attractive about this coyote," I said bitterly,
"is beyond the grasp of my dust-coated brain. But here he is, and
you can marry him right away."</p>

<p>She said: "Air you drunk or sunstruck? Marry that
good-for-nothin', whisky-swiggin', kyard-shootin' loafer? Why, it
ain't been a week since I run him out of the house with a
broom-handle."</p>

<p>"Then he didn't jilt you?" I gasped.</p>

<p>"Him jilt me?" she said. "I jilted him!"</p>

<p>I turned to Dick Blanton more in sorrer than in anger.</p>

<p>"Why," said I, "did you boast all over Grizzly Run about jiltin'
Elinor Elkins?"</p>

<p>"I didn't want folks to know she turned me down," he said
sullenly. "Us Blantons is proud. The only reason I ever thought
about marryin' her was I was ready to settle down on the farm pap
gave me, and I wanted to marry me a Elkins gal, so I wouldn't have
to go to the expense of hirin' a couple of hands and buyin' a span
of mules, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>They ain't no use in Dick Blanton threatening to have the law
onto me. He got off light to what he'd have got if pap and my
brothers hadn't all been off hunting. They've got terrible tempers.
But I was always too soft-hearted for my own good. In spite of Dick
Blanton's insults I held my temper. I didn't do nothing to him at
all, except escort him with dignity for five or six miles down the
Chawed Ear trail, kicking him in the seat of his britches.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="gent7" name="gent7">7. THE ROAD TO BEAR CREEK</a>
</h2>

<p style="text-indent:0">AS I come back up the trail after
escorting Dick Blanton down it, I got nervous as I approached the
p'int where the path that run from the McGraw cabin came out into
it. If they was anybody in the world right then I didn't want to
meet, it was Glory McGraw. I got past and hove a sigh of relief,
and jest as I done so, I heard a hoss, and looked back and she was
riding out of the path.</p>

<p>I taken to the bresh and to my rage she spurred her hoss and
come after me. She was on a fast cayuse, but I thought if I keep my
lead I'd be all right, because soon I'd be in the dense thickets
where she couldn't come a-hossback. I speeded up, because I'd had
about all of her rawhiding I could endure. And then, as I was
looking back over my shoulder, I run right smack into a low-
hanging oak limb and nearly knocked my brains out. When things
stopped spinning around me, I was setting on the ground, and Glory
McGraw was setting on her hoss looking down at me.</p>

<p>"Why, Breckinridge," she says mockingly. "Air in you scairt of
me? What you want to run from me for?"</p>

<p>"I warn't runnin' from you," I growled, glaring up at her. "I
didn't even know you was anywheres around. I seen one of pap's
steers sneakin' off in the bresh, and I was tryin' to head him. Now
you done scairt him away!"</p>

<p>I riz and breshed the dust offa my clothes with my I hat, and
she says: "I been hearin' a lot about you, Breckinridge. Seems like
yo're gittin' to be quite a famous man."</p>

<p>"Hmmmm!" I says, suspicious.</p>

<p>"But where, Breckinridge," she cooed, leaning over the saddle
horn towards me, "where is that there purty town-gal you was goin'
to bring back to Bear Creek as yore blushin' bride?"</p>

<p>"We ain't sot the day yet," I muttered, looking off.</p>

<p>"Is she purty, Breckinridge?" she pursued.</p>

<p>"Purty as a pitcher," I says. "They ain't a gal on Bear Creek
can hold a candle to her."</p>

<p>"Where's she live?" ast Glory.</p>

<p>"War Paint," I said, that being the first town that come into my
mind.</p>

<p>"What's her name, Breckinridge?" ast Glory, and I couldn't think
of a gal's name if I'd knowed I was going to be shot.</p>

<p>I stammered and floundered, and whilst I was trying my damndest
to think of <i>some</i> name to give her, she bust into
laughter.</p>

<p>"What a lover <i>you</i> be!" says she. "Cain't even remember
the name of the gal yo're goin' to marry&mdash;you <i>air</i> goin'
to marry her, ain't you, Breckinridge?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am!" I roared. "I <i>have</i> got a gal in War Paint!
I'm goin' to see her right now, soon as I can git back to my corral
and saddle my hoss! What d'you think of <i>that</i>, Miss
Smarty?"</p>

<p>"I think yo're the biggest liar on Bear Creek!" says she, with a
mocking laugh, and reined around and rode off whilst I stood in
helpless rage. "Give my regards to yore War Paint sweetheart,
Breckinridge!" she called back over her shoulder. "Soon as you
remember what her name is!"</p>

<p>I didn't say nothing. I was past talking. I was too full of
wishing that Glory McGraw was a man for jest about five minutes.
She was clean out of sight before I could even see straight, much
less talk or think reasonable. I give a maddened roar and ripped a
limb off a tree as big as a man's laig and started thrashing down
the bresh all around, whilst chawing the bark offa all the trees I
could rech, and by the time I had cooled off a little that thicket
looked like a cyclone had hit it. But I felt a little better and I
headed for home on the run, cussing a blue streak and the bobcats
and painters taken to the high ridges as I come.</p>

<p>I made for the corral, and as I come out into the clearing I
heard a beller like a mad bull up at the cabin, and seen my
brothers Buckner and Garfield and John and Bill run out of the
cabin and take to the woods, so I figgered pap must be having a
touch of the rheumatiz. It makes him remarkable peevish. But I went
on and saddled Cap'n Kidd. I was determined to make good on what I
told Glory. I didn't have no gal in War Paint, but by golly, I
aimed to, and this time I warn't to be turnt aside. I was heading
for War Paint, and I was going to get me a gal if I had to lick the
entire town.</p>

<p>Well, jest as I was leading Cap'n Kidd outa the corral, my
sister Brazoria come to the door of the cabin and hollered: "Oh,
Breckinridge! Come up to the shack! Pap wants you!"</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;!" says I. "What the hell now?"</p>

<p>I went up to the cabin and tied Cap'n Kidd and went in. At first
glance I seen pap had past the peevish stage and was having a
remorseful spell. Rheumatism effects him that way. But the remorse
is always for something that happened a long time ago. He didn't
seem a bit regretful for having busted a ox- yoke over brother
Garfield's head that morning.</p>

<p>He was laying on his b'ar-skin with a jug of corn licker at his
elbow, and he says: "Breckinridge, the sins of my youth is ridin'
my conscience heavy. When I was a young man I was free and keerless
in my habits, as numerous tombstones on the boundless prairies
testifies. I sometimes wonders if I warn't a trifle hasty in
shootin' some of the gents which disagreed with my principles.
Maybe I should of controlled my passion and jest chawed their ears
off.</p>

<p>"Take Uncle Esau Grimes, for instance." And then pap hove a sigh
like a bull, and said: "I ain't seen Uncle Esau for many years. Me
and him parted with harsh words and gun-smoke. I've often wondered
if he still holds a grudge agen me for plantin' that charge of
buckshot in his hind laig."</p>

<p>"What about Uncle Esau?" I said.</p>

<p>Pap perjuiced a letter and said: "He was brung to my mind by
this here letter which Jim Braxton fotched me from War Paint. It's
from my sister Elizabeth, back in Devilville, Arizona, whar Uncle
Esau lives. She says Uncle Esau is on his way to Californy, and is
due to pass through War Paint about the tenth&mdash;that's
tomorrer. She don't know whether he intends turnin' off to see me
or not, but suggests that I meet him at War Paint, and make peace
with him."</p>

<p>"Well?" I demanded, because from the way pap combed his beard
with his fingers and eyed me, I knowed he was aiming to call on me
to do something for him.</p>

<p>"Well," said pap, taking a long swig out of the jug, "I want you
to meet the stage tomorrer mornin' at War Paint, and invite Uncle
Esau to come up here and visit us. Don't take no for a answer.
Uncle Esau is as cranky as hell, and a pecooliar old duck, but I
think he'll like you. Specially if you keep yore mouth shet and
don't expose yore ignorance."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "for onst the job you've sot for me falls in
with my own plans. I was just fixin' to light out for War Paint.
But how'm I goin' to know Uncle Esau? I ain't never seen him."</p>

<p>"He ain't a big man," said pap. "Last time I seen him he had a
right smart growth of red whiskers. You bring him home regardless.
Don't pay no attention to his belly-achin'. He's awful suspicious
because he's got lots of enemies. He burnt plenty of powder in his
younger days, all the way from Texas to Californy. He war mixed up
in more feuds and range-wars than any man I ever knowed. He's
supposed to have considerable money hid away somewheres, but that
ain't got nothin' to do with us. I wouldn't take his blasted money
as a gift. All I want to do is talk to him, and git his forgiveness
for fillin' his hide with buckshot in a moment of youthful
passion.</p>

<p>"If he don't forgive me," says pap, taking another pull at his
jug, "I'll bend my .45 over his stubborn old skull. Git goin'."</p>

<p>So I hit out acrost the mountains, and the next morning found me
eating breakfast at the aidge of War Paint, with a old hunter and
trapper by the name of old Bill Polk which was camped there
temporary.</p>

<p>War Paint was a new town which had sprung up out of nothing on
account of a gold rush right recent, and old Bill was very
bitter.</p>

<p>"A hell of a come-off this is!" he snorted. "Clutterin' up the
scenery and scarin' the animals off with their fool houses and
claims. Last year I shot deer right whar that saloon yonder stands
now," he said, glaring at me like it was my fault.</p>

<p>I said nothing but chawed my venison which we was cooking over
his fire, and he said: "No good'll come of it, you mark my word.
These mountains won't be fit to live in. These camps draws scum
like a dead hoss draws buzzards. The outlaws is already ridin' in
from Arizona and Utah and Californy, besides the native ones.
Grizzly Hawkins and his thieves is hidin' up in the hills, and no
tellin' how many more'll come in. I'm glad they cotched Badger
Chisom and his gang after they robbed that bank at Gunstock. That's
one gang which won't bedevil us, becaze they're in jail. If
somebody'd jest kill Grizzly Hawkins, now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who's that gal?" I ejaculated suddenly, forgetting to eat in my
excitement.</p>

<p>"Who? Whar?" says old Bill, looking around. "Oh, that gal jest
goin' by the Golden Queen restaurant? Aw, that's Dolly Rixby, the
belle of the town."</p>

<p>"She's awful purty," I says.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> never seen a purtier," says he.</p>

<p>"I have, too," I says absent-mindedly. "Glory McGraw&mdash;"
Then I kind of woke up to what I was saying and flang my breakfast
into the fire in disgust. "Sure, she's the purtiest gal I ever
seen!" I snorted. "Ain't a gal in the Humbolts can hold a candle to
her. What you say her name was? Dolly Rixby? A right purty name,
too."</p>

<p>"You needn't start castin' sheep's eyes at her," he opined.
"They's a dozen young bucks sparkin' her already. I think Blink
Wiltshaw's the favorite to put his brand onto her, though. She
wouldn't look at a hillbilly like you."</p>

<p>"I might remove the competition," I suggested.</p>

<p>"You better not try no Bear Creek rough-stuff in War Paint,"
says he. "The town's jest reekin' with law and order. Why, I
actually hear they ups and puts you in jail if you shoots a man
within the city limits."</p>

<p>I was scandalized. Later I found out that was jest a slander
started by the citizens of Chawed Ear which was jealous of War
Paint, but at the time I was so upsot by this information I was
almost afeared to go into town for fear I'd get arrested.</p>

<p>"Where's Miss Rixby goin' with that bucket?" I ast him.</p>

<p>"She's takin' a bucket of beer to her old man which is workin' a
claim up the creek," says old Bill.</p>

<p>"Well, lissen," I says. "You git over there behind that thicket,
and when she comes by, make a noise like a Injun."</p>

<p>"What kind of damfoolishness is this?" he demanded. "You want me
to stampede the whole camp?"</p>

<p>"Don't make a loud noise," I said. "Jest make it loud enough for
her to hear."</p>

<p>"Air you crazy?" he ast.</p>

<p>"No, dern it!" I said fiercely, because she was coming along
stepping purty fast. "Git in there and do like I say. I'll rush up
from the other side and pertend to rescue her from the Injuns and
that'll make her like me. Gwan!"</p>

<p>"I mistrusts yo're a blasted fool," he grumbled. "But I'll do
it." He snuck into the thicket which she'd have to pass on the
other side, and I circled around so she wouldn't see me till I was
ready to rush out and I save her from being sculped. Well, I warn't
hardly in position when I heard a kind of mild war-whoop, and it
sounded jest like a Blackfoot, only not so loud. But imejitly there
come the crack of a pistol and another yell which warn't subdued
like the first. It was lusty and energetic. I run towards the
thicket, but before I could get into the open trail, old Bill come
piling out of the back side of the clump with his hands to the seat
of his britches.</p>

<p>"You planned this a-purpose, you snake in the grass!" he yelped.
"Git outa my way!"</p>

<p>"Why, Bill," I says. "What happened?"</p>

<p>"I bet you knowed she had a derringer in her stockin'," he
snarled as he run past me. "It's all yore fault! When I whooped,
she pulled it and shot into the bresh! Don't speak to me! I'm lucky
to be alive. I'll git even with you for this if it takes a hundred
years!"</p>

<p>He headed on into the deep bresh, and I run around the thicket
and seen Dolly Rixby peering into it with her gun smoking in her
hand. She looked up as I come onto the trail, and I taken off my
hat and said, perlite: "Howdy, miss; can I be of no assistance to
you?"</p>

<p>"I jest shot a Injun," she said. "I heard him holler. You might
go in there and git the sculp, if you don't mind. I'd like to have
it for a soovenir."</p>

<p>"I'll be glad to, miss," I says heartily. "I'll likewise cure
and tan it for you myself."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you!" she says, dimpling when she smiled. "It's a
pleasure to meet a real gent like you."</p>

<p>"The pleasure is all mine," I assured her, and went into the
bresh and stomped around a little, and then come out and says: "I'm
awful sorry, miss, but the critter ain't nowheres to be found. You
must of jest winged him. If you want me to I'll take his trail and
foller it till I catch up with him, though."</p>

<p>"Oh, I wouldn't think of puttin' you to no sech trouble," she
says much to my relief, because I was jest thinking that if she did
demand a sculp, the only thing I could do would be to catch old
Bill and sculp him, and I'd hate awful bad to have to do that.</p>

<p>But she looked me over with admiration in her eyes, and said:
"I'm Dolly Rixby. Who're you?"</p>

<p>"I knowed you the minute I seen you," I says. "The fame of yore
beauty has reched clean into the Humbolts. I'm Breckinridge
Elkins."</p>

<p>Her eyes kind of sparkled, and she said: "I've heard of you,
too! You broke Cap'n Kidd, and it was you that cleaned up
Wampum!"</p>

<p>"Yes'm," I says, and jest then I seen the stagecoach fogging it
down the road from the east, and I says: "Say, I got to meet that
there stage, but I'd like to call on you at yore convenience."</p>

<p>"Well," she says, "I'll be back at the cabin in about a hour.
What's the matter with then? I live about ten rods north of The Red
Rooster gamblin' hall."</p>

<p>"I'll be there," I promised, and she gimme a dimply smile and
went on down the trail with her old man's bucket of beer, and I
hustled back to where I left Cap'n Kidd. My head was in a whirl,
and my heart was pounding. And here, thinks I, is where I show
Glory McGraw what kind of stuff a Elkins is made of. Jest wait till
I ride back to Bear Creek with Dolly Rixby as my bride!</p>

<p>I rode into War Paint just as the stage pulled up at the stand,
which was also the post office and a saloon. They was three
passengers, and they warn't none of 'em tenderfeet. Two was big
hard-looking fellers, and t'other'n was a wiry oldish kind of a
bird with red whiskers, so I knowed right off it was Uncle Esau
Grimes. They was going into the saloon as I dismounted, the big men
first, and the older feller follering 'em. Thinks I, I'll start him
on his way to Bear Creek, and then I'll come back and start
sparking Dolly Rixby.</p>

<p>I touched him on the shoulder, and he whirled most amazing quick
with a gun in his hand, and he looked at me very suspicious, and
said: "What you want?"</p>

<p>"I'm Breckinridge Elkins," I said. "I want you to come with me.
I recognized you as soon as I seen you&mdash;"</p>

<p>I then got a awful surprise, but not as sudden as it would have
been if pap hadn't warned me that Uncle Esau was pecooliar. He
hollered: "Bill! Jim! Help!" And swung his six-shooter agen my head
with all his might.</p>

<p>The other two fellers whirled and their hands streaked for their
guns, so I knocked Uncle Esau flat to keep him from getting hit by
a stray slug, and shot one of 'em through the shoulder before he
could unlimber his artillery. T'other'n grazed my neck with a
bullet, so I perforated him in the arm and the hind laig and he
fell down acrost the other'n. I was careful not to shoot 'em in no
vital parts, because I seen they was friends of Uncle Esau; but
when guns is being drawn it ain't no time to argy or explain.</p>

<p>Men was hollering and running out of saloons, and I stooped and
started to lift Uncle Esau, who was kind of groggy because he'd hit
his head agen a hitching post. He was crawling around on his
all-fours cussing something terrible, and trying to find his gun
which he'd dropped. When I laid hold onto him he commenced biting
and kicking and hollering, and I said: "Don't ack like that, Uncle
Esau. Here comes a lot of fellers, and the sheriff may be here any
minute and 'rest me for shootin' them idjits. We got to git goin'.
Pap's waitin' for you, up on Bear Creek."</p>

<p>But he jest fit that much harder and hollered that much louder,
so I scooped him up bodily and jumped onto Cap'n Kidd and throwed
Uncle Esau face down acrost the saddle-bow, and headed for the
hills. A lot of men yelled at me to stop, and some of 'em started
shooting at me, but I give no heed.</p>

<p>I give Cap'n Kidd the rein and we went tearing down the road and
around the first bend, and I didn't even take time to change Uncle
Esau's position, because I didn't want to get arrested. A fat
chance I had of keeping my date with Dolly Rixby. I wonder if
anybody ever had sech cussed relatives as me.</p>

<p>Jest before we reched the p'int where the Bear Creek trail runs
into the road, I seen a man on the road ahead of me, and he must
have heard the shooting and Uncle Esau yelling because he whirled
his hoss and blocked the road. He was a wiry old cuss with grey
whiskers.</p>

<p>"Where you goin' with that man?" he yelled as I approached at a
thundering gait.</p>

<p>"None of yore business," I retorted. "Git outa my way."</p>

<p>"Help! Help!" hollered Uncle Esau. "I'm bein' kidnapped and
murdered!"</p>

<p>"Drop that man, you derned outlaw!" roared the stranger, suiting
his actions to his words.</p>

<p>Him and me drawed simultaneous, but my shot was a split-second
quicker'n his'n. His slug fanned my ear, but his hat flew off and
he pitched out of his saddle like he'd been hit with a hammer. I
seen a streak of red along his temple as I thundered past him.</p>

<p>"Let that larn you not to interfere in family affairs!" I
roared, and turned up the trail that switched off the road and up
into the mountains.</p>

<p>"Don't never yell like that," I said irritably to Uncle Esau.
"You like to got me shot. That feller thought I was a
criminal."</p>

<p>I didn't catch what he said, but I looked back and down over the
slopes and shoulders, and seen men boiling out of town full tilt,
and the sun glinted on six-shooters and rifles, so I urged on Cap'n
Kidd and we covered the next few miles at a fast clip.</p>

<p>Uncle Esau kept trying to talk, but he was bouncing up and down
so all I could understand was his cuss words, which was free and
fervent. At last he gasped: "For God's sake lemme git off this
cussed saddle-horn; it's rubbin' a hole in my belly."</p>

<p>So I pulled up and seen no sign of my pursuers, so I said: "All
right, you can ride in the saddle and I'll set on behind. I was
goin' to hire you a hoss at the livery stable, but we had to leave
so quick they warn't no time."</p>

<p>"Where you takin' me?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"To Bear Creek," I said. "Where you think?"</p>

<p>"I don't wanta go to Bear Creek," he said fiercely. "I
<i>ain't</i> goin' to Bear Creek."</p>

<p>"You are, too," I said. "Pap said not to take no for a answer.
I'm goin' to slide over behind the saddle, and you can set in
it."</p>

<p>So I pulled my feet outa the stirrups and moved over the cantle,
and he slid into the seat&mdash;and the first thing I knowed he had
a knife out of his boot and was trying to kyarve my gizzard.</p>

<p>Now I likes to humor my relatives, but they is a limit to
everything. I taken the knife away from him, but in the struggle,
me being handicapped by not wanting to hurt him, I lost hold of the
reins and Cap'n Kidd bolted and run for several miles through the
pines and bresh. What with me trying to grab the reins and keep
Uncle Esau from killing me at the same time, and neither one of us
in the stirrups, finally we both fell off, and if I hadn't managed
to catch hold of the bridle as I went off, we'd had a long walk
ahead of us.</p>

<p>I got Cap'n Kidd stopped, after being drug for about
seventy-five yards, and then I went back to where Uncle Esau was
laying on the ground trying to get his wind back, because I had
kind of fell on him.</p>

<p>"Is that any way to ack, tryin' to stick a knife in a man which
is doin' his best to make you comfortable?" I said reproachfully.
All he done was gasp, so I said: "Well, pap told me you was a
cranky old duck, so I reckon the only thing to do is to jest not
notice yore pecooliarities."</p>

<p>I looked around to get my bearings, because Cap'n Kidd had got
away off the trail. We was west of it, in very wild country, but I
seen a cabin off through the trees, and I said: "We'll go over
there and see can I buy or hire a hoss for you to ride. That'll be
more convenient for both of us."</p>

<p>I h'isted him back into the saddle, and he said kind of dizzily:
"This here's a free country. I don't have to go to Bear Creek if'n
I don't want to."</p>

<p>"Well," I said severely, "you oughta want to, after all the
trouble I've went to, comin' and invitin' you, and passin' up a
date with the purtiest gal in War Paint on account of you. Set
still now. I'm settin' on behind but I'm holdin' the reins."</p>

<p>"I'll have yore life for this," he promised blood-thirstily, but
I ignored it, because pap had said Uncle Esau was pecooliar.</p>

<p>Purty soon we hove up to the cabin I'd glimpsed through the
trees. Nobody was in sight, but I seen a hoss tied to a tree in
front of the cabin. I rode up to the door and knocked, but nobody
answered. But I seen smoke coming out of the chimney, so I decided
I'd go in.</p>

<p>I dismounted and lifted Uncle Esau off, because I seen from the
gleam in his eye that he was intending to run off on Cap'n Kidd if
I give him half a chance. I got a firm grip onto his collar,
because I was determined that he was going to visit us up on Bear
Creek if I had to tote him on my shoulder all the way, and I went
into the cabin with him.</p>

<p>They warn't nobody in there, though a big pot of beans was
simmering over some coals in the fireplace, and I seen some rifles
in racks on the wall and a belt with two pistols hanging on a
peg.</p>

<p>Then I heard somebody walking behind the cabin, and the back
door opened and there stood a big, black-whiskered man with a
bucket of water in his hand and a astonished glare on his face. He
didn't have no guns on.</p>

<p>"Who the hell are you?" he demanded, but Uncle Esau give a kind
of gurgle, and said: "Grizzly Hawkins!"</p>

<p>The big man jumped and glared at Uncle Esau, and then his black
whiskers bristled in a ferocious grin, and he said: "Oh, it's you,
is it? Who'd of thunk I'd ever meet you <i>here?</i>"</p>

<p>"Grizzly Hawkins, hey?" I said, realizing that I'd stumbled onto
the hideout of the wust outlaw in them mountains. "So you-all know
each other?"</p>

<p>"I'll say we do!" rumbled Hawkins, looking at Uncle Esau like a
wolf looks at a fat yearling.</p>

<p>"I'd heard you was from Arizona," I said, being naturally
tactful. "Looks to me like they's enough cow-thieves in these hills
already without outsiders buttin' in. But yore morals ain't none of
my business. I want to buy or hire or borrer a hoss for this here
gent to ride."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, you ain't!" said Grizzly. "You think I'm goin' to let a
fortune slip through my fingers like that? Tell you what I'll do,
though: I'll split with you. My gang had business over towards
Chawed Ear this mornin', but they're due back soon. Me and you will
work him over before they gits back, and we'll nab all the loot
ourselves."</p>

<p>"What you mean?" I ast. "My uncle and me is on our way to Bear
Creek&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aw, don't ack innercent with me!" he snorted disgustedly.
"Uncle! Hell! You think I'm a plumb fool? Cain't I see he's yore
prisoner, the way you got him by the neck? Think I don't know what
yo're up to? Be reasonable. Two can work this job better'n one. I
know lots of ways to make a man talk. I betcha if we kinda massage
his hinder parts with a red-hot brandin' iron he'll tell us quick
enough where the money is hid."</p>

<p>Uncle Esau turnt pale under his whiskers, and I said
indignantly: "Why, you low-lifed polecat! You got the crust to
pertend to think I'm kidnappin' my own uncle for his dough? I got a
good mind to shoot you."</p>

<p>"So yo're greedy, hey?" he snarled, showing his teeth. "Want all
the loot yoreself, hey? I'll show you!" And quick as a cat he swung
that water bucket over his head and let it go at me. I ducked and
it hit Uncle Esau in the head and stretched him out all drenched
with water, and Hawkins give a roar and dived for a .45-90 on the
wall. He wheeled with it and I shot it out of his hands. He then
come for me wild-eyed with a bowie out of his boot, and my next
cartridge snapped, and he was on top of me before I could cock my
gun again.</p>

<p>I dropped it and grappled with him, and we fit all over the
cabin and every now and then we would tromple on Uncle Esau which
was trying to crawl towards the door, and the way he would holler
was pitiful to hear.</p>

<p>Hawkins lost his knife in the melee, but he was as big as me,
and a bear-cat at rough-and-tumble. We would stand up and whale
away with both fists, and then clinch and roll around the floor,
biting and gouging and slugging, and onst we rolled clean over
Uncle Esau and kind of flattened him out like a pancake.</p>

<p>Finally Hawkins got hold of the table which he lifted like it
was a board and splintered over my head, and this made me mad, so I
grabbed the pot off the fire and hit him in the head with it, and
about a gallon of red-hot beans went down his back and he fell into
a corner so hard he jolted the shelves loose from the logs, and all
the guns fell off the walls.</p>

<p>He come up with a gun in his hand, but his eyes was so full of
blood and hot beans that he missed me the first shot, and before he
could shoot again I hit him on the chin so hard it fractured his
jaw bone and sprained both his ankles and laid him out cold.</p>

<p>Then I looked around for Uncle Esau, and he was gone and the
front door was open. I rushed out of the cabin and there he was
jest climbing aboard Cap'n Kidd. I hollered for him to wait, but he
kicked Cap'n Kidd in the ribs and went tearing off through the
trees. Only he didn't head north back towards War Paint. He was
p'inted south-east, in the general direction of Hideout Mountain. I
grabbed my gun up off the floor and lit out after him, though I
didn't have much hope of catching him. Grizzly's cayuse was a good
hoss, but he couldn't hold a candle to Cap'n Kidd.</p>

<p>I wouldn't have caught him, neither, if it hadn't been for Cap'n
Kidd's determination not to be rode by nobody but me. Uncle Esau
was a crack hossman to stay on as long as he did.</p>

<p>But finally Cap'n Kidd got tired of sech foolishness, and about
the time he crossed the trail we'd been follerin' when he first
bolted, he bogged his head and started busting hisself in two, with
his snoot rubbing the grass and his heels scraping the clouds offa
the sky.</p>

<p>I could see mountain peaks between Uncle Esau and the saddle,
and when Cap'n Kidd start sunfishing it looked like the wrath of
Jedgment Day, but somehow Uncle Esau managed to stay with him till
Cap'n Kidd plumb left the earth like he aimed to aviate from then
on, and Uncle Esau left the saddle with a shriek of despair and
sailed head-on into a blackjack thicket.</p>

<p>Cap'n Kidd give a snort of contempt and trotted off to a patch
of grass and started grazing, and I dismounted and went and
ontangled Uncle Esau from amongst the branches. His clothes was
tore and he was scratched so he looked like he'd been fighting with
a drove of wildcats, and he left a right smart bunch of his
whiskers amongst the bresh.</p>

<p>But he was full of pizen and hostility.</p>

<p>"I understand this here treatment," he said bitterly, like he
blamed me for Cap'n Kidd pitching him into the thicket, "but you'll
never git a penny. Nobody but me knows whar the dough is, and you
can pull my toe nails out by the roots before I tells you."</p>

<p>"I know you got money hid away," I said, deeply offended, "but I
don't want it."</p>

<p>He snorted skeptical and said sarcastic: "Then what're you
draggin' me over these cussed hills for?"</p>

<p>"'Cause pap wants to see you," I said. "But they ain't no use in
askin' me a lot of fool questions. Pap said for me to keep my mouth
shet."</p>

<p>I looked around for Grizzly's hoss, and seen he had wandered
off. He sure hadn't been trained proper.</p>

<p>"Now I got to go look for him," I said disgustedly. "Will you
stay here till I git back?"</p>

<p>"Sure," he said. "Sure. Go on and look for the hoss. I'll wait
here."</p>

<p>But I give him a searching look, and shook my head.</p>

<p>"I don't want to seem like I mistrusts you," I said, "but I see
a gleam in yore eye which makes me believe that you intends to run
off the minute my back's turned. I hate to do this, but I got to
bring you safe to Bear Creek; so I'll just kinda hawg-tie you with
my lariat till I git back."</p>

<p>Well, he put up a awful holler, but I was firm, and when I rode
off on Cap'n Kidd I was satisfied that he couldn't untie them knots
by hisself. I left him laying in the grass beside the trail, and
his language was painful to listen to.</p>

<p>That derned hoss had wandered farther'n I thought. He'd moved
north along the trail for a short way, and then turned off and
headed in a westerly direction, and after a while I heard hosses
galloping somewheres behind me, and I got nervous, thinking what if
Hawkins's gang had got back to their hangout and he'd told 'em
about us, and sent 'em after us, to capture pore Uncle Esau and
torture him to make him tell where his savings was hid. I wished
I'd had sense enough to shove Uncle Esau back in the thicket so he
wouldn't be seen by anybody riding along the trail, and I'd just
decided to let the hoss go and turn back, when I seen him grazing
amongst the trees ahead of me.</p>

<p>I caught him and headed back for the trail, aiming to hit it a
short piece north of where I'd left Uncle Esau, and before I got in
sight of it, I heard hosses and saddles creaking ahead of me.</p>

<p>I pulled up on the crest of a slope, and looked down onto the
trail, and there I seen a gang of men riding north, and they had
Uncle Esau amongst 'em. Two of the men was ridin' double, and they
had him on a hoss in the middle of 'em. They'd took the ropes off'n
him, but he didn't look happy. Instantly I realized that my
premonishuns was correct. The Hawkins gang had follered us, and now
pore Uncle Esau was in their clutches.</p>

<p>I let go of Hawkins's hoss and reched for my gun, but I didn't
dare fire for fear of hitting Uncle Esau, they was clustered so
clost about him. I reched up and tore a limb off a oak tree as big
as my arm, and I charged down the slope yelling: "I'll save you,
Uncle Esau!"</p>

<p>I come so sudden and onexpected them fellers didn't have time to
do nothing but holler before I hit 'em. Cap'n Kidd ploughed through
their hosses like a avalanche through saplings, and he was going so
hard I couldn't check him in time to keep him from knocking Uncle
Esau's hoss sprawling. Uncle Esau hit the turf with a shriek.</p>

<p>All around me men was yelling and surging and pulling guns and I
riz in my stirrups and laid about me right and left, and pieces of
bark and oak leaves and blood flew in showers and in a second the
ground was littered with writhing figgers, and the hollering and
cussing was awful to hear. Knives was flashing and pistols was
banging, but them outlaws' eyes was too full of bark and stars and
blood for them to aim, and right in the middle of the brawl, when
the guns was roaring and hosses was neighing and men yelling and my
oak-limb going <i>crack! crack! crack!</i> on their skulls, down
from the north swooped <i>another</i> gang, howling like
hyeners!</p>

<p>"There he is!" one of 'em yelled. "I see him crawlin' around
under them hosses! After him, boys! We got as much right to his
dough as anybody!"</p>

<p>The next minute they'd dashed in amongst us and embraced the
members of the other gang and started hammering 'em over the heads
with their pistols, and in a second there was the damndest
three-cornered war you ever seen, men fighting on the ground and on
the hosses, all mixed and tangled up, two gangs trying to
exterminate each other, and me whaling hell out of both of 'em.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Uncle Esau was on the ground under us, yelling bloody
murder and being stepped on by the hosses, but finally I cleared me
a space with a devastating sweep of my club, and leaned down and
scooped him up with one hand and hung him over my saddle horn and
started battering my way clear.</p>

<p>But a big feller which was one of the second gang come charging
through the melee yelling like a Injun, with blood running down his
face from a cut in his scalp. He snapped a empty ca'tridge at me,
and then leaned out from his saddle and grabbed Uncle Esau by the
foot.</p>

<p>"Leggo!" he howled. "He's my meat!"</p>

<p>"Release Uncle Esau before I does you a injury!" I roared,
trying to jerk Uncle Esau loose, but the outlaw hung on, and Uncle
Esau squalled like a catamount in a wolf-trap. So I lifted what was
left of my club and splintered it over the outlaw's head, and he
give up the ghost with a gurgle. I then wheeled Cap'n Kidd and rode
off like the wind. Them fellers was too busy fighting each other to
notice my flight. Somebody did let <i>bam</i> at me with a
Winchester, but all it done was to nick Uncle Esau's ear.</p>

<p>The sounds of carnage faded out behind us as I headed south
along the trail. Uncle Esau was belly-aching about something. I
never seen sech a cuss for finding fault, but I felt they was no
time to be lost, so I didn't slow up for some miles. Then I pulled
Cap'n Kidd down and said: "What did you say, Uncle Esau?"</p>

<p>"I'm a broken man!" he gasped. "Take my secret, and lemme go
back to the posse. All I want now is a good, safe prison term."</p>

<p>"What posse?" I ast, thinking he must be drunk, though I
couldn't figger where he could of got any booze.</p>

<p>"The posse you took me away from," he said. "Anything's better'n
bein' dragged through these hellish mountains by a homicidal
maneyack."</p>

<p>"Posse?" I gasped wildly. "But who was the second gang?"</p>

<p>"Grizzly Hawkins's outlaws," he said, and added bitterly: "Even
they'd be preferable to what I been goin' through. I give up. I
know when I'm licked. The dough's hid in a holler oak three miles
west of Gunstock."</p>

<p>I didn't pay no attention to his remarks, because my head was in
a whirl. A posse! Of course; the sheriff and his men had follered
us from War Paint, along the Bear Creek trail, and finding Uncle
Esau tied up, had thought he'd been kidnapped by a outlaw instead
of merely being invited to visit his relatives. Probably he was too
cussed ornery to tell 'em any different. I hadn't rescued him from
no bandits; I'd took him away from a posse which thought
<i>they</i> was rescuing him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Uncle Esau was clamoring: "Well, why'n't you lemme go?
I've told you whar the dough is. What else you want?"</p>

<p>"You got to go onto Bear Creek with me&mdash;" I begun; and
Uncle Esau give a shriek and went into a kind of convulsion, and
the first thing I knowed he'd twisted around and jerked my gun out
of its scabbard and let <i>bam!</i> right in my face so close it
singed my hair. I grabbed his wrist and Cap'n Kidd bolted like he
always does whenever he gets the chance.</p>

<p>"They's a limit to everything!" I roared. "A hell of a relative
you be, you old maneyack!"</p>

<p>We was tearing over slopes and ridges at breakneck speed and
fighting all over Cap'n Kidd's back&mdash;me to get the gun away
from him, and him to commit murder. "If you warn't kin to me, Uncle
Esau," I said wrathfully, "I'd plumb lose my temper!"</p>

<p>"What you keep callin' me that fool name for?" he yelled,
frothing at the mouth. "What you want to add insult to
injury&mdash;" Cap'n Kidd swerved sudden and Uncle Esau tumbled
over his neck. I had him by the shirt and tried to hold him on, but
the shirt tore. He hit the ground on his head and Cap'n Kidd run
right over him. I pulled up as quick as I could and hove a sigh of
relief to see how close to home I was.</p>

<p>"We're nearly there, Uncle Esau," I said, but he made no
comment. He was out cold.</p>

<p>A short time later I rode up to the cabin with my eccentric
relative slung over my saddle-bow, and I taken him off and stalked
into where pap was laying on his b'ar-skin, and slung my burden
down on the floor in disgust. "Well, here he is," I said.</p>

<p>Pap stared and said: "Who's this?"</p>

<p>"When you wipe the blood off," I said, "you'll find it's yore
Uncle Esau Grimes. And," I added bitterly, "the next time you wants
to invite him to visit us, you can do it yoreself. A more
ungrateful cuss I never seen. Pecooliar ain't no name for him; he's
as crazy as a locoed jackass."</p>

<p>"But <i>that</i> ain't Uncle Esau!" said pap.</p>

<p>"What you mean?" I said irritably. "I know most of his clothes
is tore off, and his face is kinda scratched and skint and stomped
outa shape, but you can see his whiskers is red, in spite of the
blood."</p>

<p>"Red whiskers turn grey, in time," said a voice, and I wheeled
and pulled my gun as a man loomed in the door.</p>

<p>It was the grey-whiskered old feller I'd traded shots with on
the edge of War Paint. He didn't go for his gun, but stood twisting
his moustache and glaring at me like I was a curiosity or
something.</p>

<p>"Uncle Esau!" said pap.</p>

<p>"What?" I hollered. "Air <i>you</i> Uncle Esau?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I am!" he snapped.</p>

<p>"But you warn't on the stagecoach&mdash;" I begun.</p>

<p>"Stagecoach!" he snorted, taking pap's jug and beginning to pour
licker down the man on the floor. "Them things is for wimmen and
childern. I travel hoss-back. I spent last night in War Paint, and
aimed to ride on up to Bear Creek this mornin'. In fact, Bill," he
addressed pap, "I was on the way here when this young maneyack
creased me." He indicated a bandage on his head.</p>

<p>"You mean Breckinridge shot you?" ejaculated pap.</p>

<p>"It seems to run in the family," grunted Uncle Esau.</p>

<p>"But who's this?" I hollered wildly, pointing at the man I'd
thought was Uncle Esau, and who was jest coming to.</p>

<p>"I'm Badger Chisom," he said, grabbing the jug with both hands.
"I demands to be pertected from this lunatick and turned over to
the sheriff."</p>

<p>"Him and Bill Reynolds and Jim Hopkins robbed a bank over at
Gunstock three weeks ago," said Uncle Esau; the real one, I mean.
"A posse captured them, but they'd hid the loot somewhere and
wouldn't say where. They escaped several days ago, and not only the
sheriffs was lookin' for 'em, but all the outlaw gangs too, to find
out where they'd hid their plunder. It was a awful big haul. They
must of figgered that escapin' out of the country by stagecoach
would be the last thing folks would expect 'em to do, and they
warn't known around War Paint.</p>

<p>"But I recognized Billy Reynolds when I went back to War Paint
to have my head dressed, after you shot me, Breckinridge. The
doctor was patchin' him and Hopkins up, too. I knowed Reynolds back
in Arizona. The sheriff and a posse lit out after you, and I
follered 'em when I'd got my head fixed. 'Course, I didn't know who
you was. I come up while the posse was fightin' with the Hawkins
gang, and with my help we corralled the whole bunch. Then I took up
yore trail again. Purty good day's work, wipin' out two of the wust
gangs in the West. One of Hawkins's men said Grizzly was laid up in
his cabin, and the posse was going to drop by for him."</p>

<p>"What you goin' to do about me?" clamored Chisom.</p>

<p>"Well," said pap, "we'll bandage you up good, and then I'll let
Breckinridge here take you back to War Paint&mdash;hey, what's the
matter with him?"</p>

<p>Badger Chisom had fainted.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="gent8" name="gent8">8. THE SCALP HUNTER</a>
</h2>

<p style="text-indent:0">MY return to War Paint with Badger Chisom
was plumb uneventful. He was awful nervous all the way and every
time I spoke to him he jumped and ducked like he expected to be
shot at, and he hove a distinct sigh of relief when the sheriff
taken charge of him. He said something like, "Safe at last, thank
God!" and seemed in a sweat to get into a good, strong cell.
Criminals is pecooliar people.</p>

<p>Well, to my surprise I found that I had become a kind of
personage in War Paint account of shooting Chisom's pards and
bringing him in. It warn't a narrer-minded town at all, like the
folks over to Chawed Ear had led me to believe. Things was free and
easy, big gambling games running all the time, bars open all day
and all night, and pistols popping every hour of the day. They had
a sheriff but he was a sensible man which didn't interfere with the
business of honest citizens. He 'lowed it was his job to see that
the town warn't overrun by thieving, murdering outlaws, not to go
butting into folks' affairs. He told me that if I had occasion to
shoot another gent he'd take it as a personal favor if I'd be
careful not to hit no innercent bystander by mistake, and when I
said I would, he said I was a credit to the community, and we had a
drink.</p>

<p>I was about half scairt to go see Dolly Rixby, but I screwed up
my courage by thinking of what Glory McGraw would say if I didn't
get me a gal soon, and called on her. She warn't as peeved as I
thought, though she did say: "Well, yo're a mite late, ain't you?
About two days, I believe! But better late than never, I
reckon."</p>

<p>She was broad-minded enough to understand my position, and we
got along fine. Well, we did after I persuaded them young bucks
which was mooning around her that I wasn't going to stand for no
claim-jumping. I had to be kind of subtle about this, because it
always made Dolly mad for me to disable any of her admirers. She
liked me, but she also seemed to like a lot of other fellers,
especially young Blink Wiltshaw, which was a good-looking young
miner. Sometimes I wondered whether Dolly's interest in me was
really for myself, or on account of the glory which was reflected
onto her by me calling on her regular. Because by this time I'd
made quite a name for myself around over the country, jest like I
told Glory McGraw I would. But it didn't make much difference to
me, as long as Dolly let me spark her, and I figgered that in a
little time more I'd have her roped and hawg-tied and branded, and
I drempt of the day when I'd take her back to Bear Creek and
interjuice her to everybody as my wife. I plumb gloated over how
Glory McGraw'd look then, and got to feeling kind of sorry for her,
and decided I wouldn't rub it in on her too raw. I'd jest be
dignified and tolerant, as become a man of my importance.</p>

<p>And then my money give out. Things had run remarkable smooth
since I come back to War Paint, and my luck had suited it. The
first night I was there I sot into a poker game in The Rebel
Captain saloon with ten dollars and run it up to five hundred
before I riz&mdash;more money than I'd ever knowed they was in the
world. I had a remarkable run of luck at gambling for maybe three
weeks, and lived high, wide and handsome, and spent money on Dolly
right and left. Then my streak broke, and the first thing I knowed,
I was busted.</p>

<p>Well, it taken money to live in a fast-stepping town like War
Paint, and go with a gal like Dolly Rixby, so I cast about for
something to do to get me some dough. About the time I was about
ready to start working somebody's claim for day-wages, I got wind
of a big jamboree which was going to be staged in Yavapai, a
cowcountry town about a hundred miles north of War Paint. They was
going to be hoss-races and roping and bull-dogging and I seen where
it was a good chance to pick up me some easy prize money. I knowed,
of course, that all them young bucks which I'd cut out could be
counted on to start shining up to Dolly the minute my back was
turnt, but I didn't look for no serious competition from them, and
Blink Wiltshaw had pulled out for Teton Gulch a week before. I
figgered he'd decided I was too much for him.</p>

<p>So I went and told Dolly that I was heading for Yavapai, and
urged her not to pine away in my absence, because I'd be back
before many days with plenty of dough. She 'lowed she could bear up
under it till I got back, so I kissed her heartily, and sallied
forth into the starlit evening where I got a onpleasant surprise. I
run into Blink Wiltshaw jest coming up onto the stoop. I was so
overcome by irritation that I started to sweep the street with him,
when Dolly come out and stopped me and made us shake hands. Blink
swore that he was going back to Teton Gulch next morning, and had
jest stopped by to say hello, so I was mollified and pulled out for
Yavapai without no more delay.</p>

<p class="cpb">* * *</p>

<p>Well, a couple of days later I pulled into Yavapai, which was
plumb full of wild cowboys and drunk Injuns, and everybody was full
of licker and rambunctiousness, so it taken 'em a whole day to get
things into shape enough and everybody sober enough to get the
races started. I started entering Cap'n Kidd in every race that was
run, me riding him, of course, and he won the first three races,
one after another, and everybody cussed something terrible, and
then the jedges said they'd have to bar me from entering any more
races. So I said all right I will now lick the jedges and they
turnt pale and gimme fifty dollars to agree not to run Cap'n Kidd
in any more of their races.</p>

<p>What with that, and the prizes, and betting on Cap'n Kidd
myself, I had about a thousand dollars, so I decided I wouldn't
stay for the roping and bull- dogging contests next day, but would
hustle back to War Paint. I'd been gone three days and was
beginning to worry about them young bucks which was sweet on Dolly.
I warn't scairt of 'em, but they warn't no use givin' 'em too much
chance.</p>

<p>But I thought I'd have a little hand of poker before I pulled
out, and that was a mistake. My luck warn't holding. When I ariz at
midnight I had exactly five dollars in my pants. But I thinks, to
hell with it; I ain't going to stay away from Dolly no longer.
Blink Wiltshaw might not have went back to Teton Gulch after all.
They is plenty of dough in the world, but not many gals like
Dolly.</p>

<p>So I headed back for War Paint without waiting for morning.
After all, I was five bucks to the good, and by playing clost to my
shirt I might run them up to several hundred, when I got back
amongst men whose style of play I knowed.</p>

<p>About the middle of the next morning I run head-on into a snag
on the path of progress in the shape of Tunk Willoughby.</p>

<p>And right here lemme say that I'm sick and tired of these lies
which is being circulated about me terrorizing the town of Grizzly
Claw. They is always more'n one side to anything. These folks which
is going around telling about me knocking the mayor of Grizzly Claw
down a flight of steps with a kitchen stove ain't yet added that
the mayor was trying to blast me with a sawed-off shotgun. If I was
a hot-headed man like some I know, I could easy lose my temper over
them there slanders, but being shy and retiring by nature, I keeps
my dignity and merely remarks that these gossipers is blamed liars
which I'll kick the ears off of if I catch 'em.</p>

<p>I didn't have no intention whatever of going to Grizzly Claw, in
the first place. It lay a way off my road.</p>

<p>But as I passed the place where the trail from Grizzly Claw
comes into the road that runs from War Paint to Yavapai, I seen
Tunk Willoughby setting on a log in the fork of the trails. I
knowed him at War Paint. Tunk ain't got no more sense'n the law
allows anyway, and now he looked plumb discouraged. He had a
mangled ear, a couple of black eyes, and a lump onto his head so
big his hat wouldn't fit. From time to time he spit out a
tooth.</p>

<p>I pulled up Cap'n Kidd and said: "What kind of a brawl have you
been into?"</p>

<p>"I been to Grizzly Claw," he said, jest like that explained it.
But I didn't get the drift, because I hadn't never been to Grizzly
Claw.</p>

<p>"That's the meanest town in these mountains," he says. "They
ain't got no real law there, but they got a feller which claims to
be a officer, and if you so much as spit, he says you busted a law
and has got to pay a fine. If you puts up a holler, the citizens
comes to his assistance. You see what happened to me. I never found
out jest what law I was supposed to have broke," Tunk said, "but it
must of been one they was particular fond of. I give 'em a good
fight as long as they confined theirselves to rocks and gun butts,
but when they interjuiced fence rails and wagon-tongues into the
fray, I give up the ghost."</p>

<p>"What you go there for, anyhow?" I ast.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, mopping off some dried blood, "I was lookin'
for you. Three days ago I met yore cousin Jack Gordon, and he told
me somethin' to tell you."</p>

<p>Him showing no signs of going on, I says: "Well, what was
it?"</p>

<p>"I cain't remember," he said. "That lammin' they give me in
Grizzly Claw has plumb addled my brains. Jack told me to tell you
to keep a sharp look-out for somebody, but I cain't remember who,
or why. But somebody had did somethin' awful to somebody on Bear
Creek&mdash;seems like it was yore Uncle Jeppard Grimes."</p>

<p>"But what did you go to Grizzly Claw for?" I demanded. "I warn't
there."</p>

<p>"I dunno," he said. "Seems like the feller which Jack wanted you
to git was from Grizzly Claw, or was supposed to go there, or
somethin'."</p>

<p>"A great help you be!" I said in disgust. "Here somebody has
went and wronged one of my kinfolks, maybe, and you forgits the
details. Try to remember the name of the feller, anyway. If I knew
who he was, I could lay him out, and then find out what he done
later on. Think, cain't you?"</p>

<p>"Did you ever have a wagon-tongue busted over yore head?" he
said. "I tell you, it's jest right recent that I remembered my own
name. It was all I could do to rekernize you jest now. If you'll
come back in a couple of days, maybe by then I'll remember what all
Jack told me."</p>

<p>I give a snort of disgust and turned off the road and headed up
the trail for Grizzly Claw. I thought maybe I could learn something
there. Anyway, it was up to me to try. Us Bear Creek folks may
fight amongst ourselves, but we stands for no stranger to impose on
anyone of us. Uncle Jeppard was about as old as the Humbolt
Mountains, and he'd fit Injuns for a living in his younger days. He
was still a tough old knot. Anybody that could do him a wrong and
get away with it sure wasn't no ordinary man, so it warn't no
wonder that word had been sent out for me to get on his trail. And
now I hadn't no idee who to look for, or why, jest because of Tunk
Willoughby's weak skull. I despise these here egg- headed
weaklings.</p>

<p>I arrove in Grizzly Claw late in the afternoon and went first to
the wagon-yard and seen that Cap'n Kidd was put in a good stall and
fed proper, and warned the feller there to keep away from him if he
didn't want his brains kicked out. Cap'n Kidd has got a disposition
like a shark and he don't like strangers. There was only five other
hosses in the wagon-yard, besides me and Cap'n Kidd&mdash;a pinto,
a bay, a piebald, and a couple of pack-hosses.</p>

<p>I then went back into the business part of the village, which
was one dusty street with stores and saloons on each side, and I
didn't pay much attention to the town, because I was trying to
figger out how I could go about trying to find out what I wanted to
know, and couldn't think of no questions to ask nobody about
nothing.</p>

<p>Well, I was approaching a saloon called the Apache Queen, and
was looking at the ground in meditation, when I seen a silver
dollar laying in the dust clost to a hitching rack. I immejitly
stooped down and picked it up, not noticing how clost it was to the
hind laigs of a mean-looking mule. When I stooped over he hauled
off and kicked me in the head. Then he let out a awful bray and
commenced jumping around holding up his hind hoof, and some men
come running out of the saloon, and one of 'em hollered: "He's
tryin' to kill my mule! Call the law!"</p>

<p>Quite a crowd gathered and the feller which owned the mule
hollered like a catamount. He was a mean-looking cuss with mournful
whiskers and a cock-eye. He yelled like somebody was stabbing him,
and I couldn't get in a word aidge-ways. Then a feller with a long
skinny neck and two guns come up and said: "I'm the sheriff. What's
goin' on here? Who is this giant? What's he did?"</p>

<p>The whiskered cuss hollered: "He kicked hisself in the head with
my mule and crippled the pore critter for life! I demands my
rights! He's got to pay me three hundred and fifty dollars for my
mule!"</p>

<p>"Aw, heck," I said, "that mule ain't hurt none; his laig's jest
kinda numbed. Anyway, I ain't got but six bucks, and whoever gets
them will take 'em offa my dead corpse." I then hitched my
six-shooters for'ards, and the crowd kinda fell away.</p>

<p>"I demands that you 'rest him!" howled Drooping-whiskers. "He
tried to 'ssassinate my mule!"</p>

<p>"You ain't got no star," I told the feller which said he was the
law. "You ain't goin' to arrest me."</p>

<p>"Does you dast resist arrest?" he says, fidgeting with his
belt.</p>

<p>"Who said anything about resistin' arrest?" I retorted. "All I
aim to do is see how far yore neck will stretch before it
breaks."</p>

<p>"Don't you dast lay hands onto a officer of the law!" he
squawked, backing away in a hurry.</p>

<p>I was tired of talking, and thirsty, so I merely give a snort
and turned away through the crowd towards a saloon pushing 'em
right and left out of my way. I seen 'em gang up in the street
behind me, talking low and mean, but I give no heed.</p>

<p>They warn't nobody in the saloon except the barman and a
gangling cowpuncher which had draped hisself over the bar. I
ordered whisky, and when I had drunk a few fingers of the rottenest
muck I believe I ever tasted, I give it up in disgust and throwed
the dollar on the bar which I had found, and was starting out when
the bartender hollered: "Hey!"</p>

<p>I turned around and said courteously: "Don't you yell at me like
that, you bat-eared buzzard! What you want?"</p>

<p>"This here dollar ain't no good!" says he, banging it on the
bar.</p>

<p>"Well, neither is yore whisky!" I snarled, because I was getting
mad. "So that makes us even!"</p>

<p>I am a long-suffering man, but it looked like everybody in
Grizzly Claw was out to gyp the stranger in their midst.</p>

<p>"You cain't run no blazer over me!" he hollered. "You gimme a
real dollar, or else&mdash;"</p>

<p>He ducked down behind the bar and come up with a shotgun so I
taken it away from him and bent the barrel double acrost my knee
and throwed it after him as he run out the back door hollering
help, murder.</p>

<p>The cowpuncher had picked up the dollar and bit on it, and then
he looked at me very sharp, and said: "Where did you get this?"</p>

<p>"I found it, if it's any of yore derned business," I snapped,
and strode out the door, and the minute I hit the street somebody
let <i>bam!</i> at me from behind a rain-barrel acrost the street
and shot my hat off. So I slammed a bullet back through the barrel
and the feller hollered and fell out in the open yelling blue
murder. It was the feller which called hisself the sheriff and he
was drilled through the hind laig. I noticed a lot of heads
sticking up over winder sills and around doors, so I roared: "Let
that be a warnin' to you Grizzly Claw coyotes! I'm Breckinridge
Elkins from Bear Creek up in the Humbolts, and I shoot better in my
sleep than most men does wide awake!"</p>

<p>I then lent emphasis to my remarks by punctuating a few
signboards and knocking out a few winder panes and everybody
hollered and ducked. So I shoved my guns back in their scabbards
and went into a restaurant. The citizens come out from their
hiding-places and carried off my victim, and he made more noise
over a broke laig than I thought was possible for a grown man.</p>

<p>They was some folks in the restaurant but they stampeded out the
back door as I come in at the front, all except the cook which
tried to take refuge somewheres else.</p>

<p>"Come outa there and fry me some bacon!" I commanded, kicking a
few slats out of the counter to add p'int to my request. It
disgusts me to see a grown man trying to hide under a stove. I am a
very patient and mild-mannered human, but Grizzly Claw was getting
under my hide. So the cook come out and fried me a mess of bacon
and ham and aigs and pertaters and sourdough bread and beans and
coffee, and I et three cans of cling peaches. Nobody come into the
restaurant whilst I was eating but I thought I heard somebody
sneaking around outside.</p>

<p>When I got through I ast the feller how much, and he told me,
and I planked down the cash, and he commenced to bite it. This lack
of faith in his feller humans so enraged me that I drawed my bowie
knife and said: "They is a limit to any man's patience! I been
insulted onst tonight and that's enough! You jest dast to say that
coin's phoney and I'll slice off yore whiskers plumb at the
roots!"</p>

<p>I brandished my bowie under his nose, and he hollered and
stampeded back into the stove and upsot it and fell over it, and
the coals went down the back of his shirt, so he riz up and run for
the creek yelling bloody murder. And that's how the story got
started that I tried to burn a cook alive, Injun- style, because he
fried my bacon too crisp. Matter of fact, I kept his shack from
catching fire and burning down, because I stomped out the coals
before they done no more than burn a big hole through the floor,
and I throwed the stove out the back door.</p>

<p>It ain't my fault if the mayor of Grizzly Claw was sneaking up
the back steps with a shotgun jest at that moment. Anyway, I hear
he was able to walk with a couple of crutches after a few
months.</p>

<p>I emerged suddenly from the front door, hearing a suspicious
noise, and I seen a feller crouching clost to a side winder peeking
through a hole in the wall. It was the cowboy I seen in the Apache
Queen. He whirled when I come out, but I had him covered.</p>

<p>"Air you spyin' on me?" I demanded. "'Cause if you
air&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no!" he says in a hurry. "I was jest leanin' up agen that
wall restin'."</p>

<p>"You Grizzly Claw folks is all crazy," I said disgustedly, and
looked around to see if anybody else tried to shoot me, but they
wam't nobody in sight, which was suspicious, but I give no heed. It
was dark by that time so I went to the wagon-yard, and they warn't
nobody there. I reckon the man which run it was off somewheres
drunk, because that seemed to be the main occupation of most of
them Grizzly Claw devils.</p>

<p>The only place for folks to sleep was a kind of double
log-cabin. That is, it had two rooms, but they warn't no door
between 'em; and in each room they wasn't nothing but a fireplace
and a bunk, and jest one outside door. I seen Cap'n Kidd was fixed
for the night, and then I went into the cabin and brought in my
saddle and bridle and saddle blanket because I didn't trust the
people thereabouts. I taken off my boots and hat and hung 'em on
the wall, and hung my guns and bowie on the end of the bunk, and
then spread my saddle-blanket on the bunk and laid down glumly.</p>

<p>I dunno why they don't build them dern things for ordinary sized
humans. A man six and a half foot tall like me can't never find one
comfortable for him. You'd think nobody but pigmies ever expected
to use one. I laid there and was disgusted at the bunk, and at
myself too, because I hadn't learnt who it was done something to
Uncle Jeppard, or what he done. It looked like I'd have to go clean
to Bear Creek to find out, and then maybe have to come clean back
to Grizzly Claw again to get the critter. By that time Dolly Rixby
would be plumb wore out of patience with me, and I wouldn't blame
her none.</p>

<p>Well, as I lay there contemplating, I heard a man come into the
wagon-yard, and purty soon I heard him come towards the cabin, but
I thought nothing of it. Then the door begun to open, and I riz up
with a gun in each hand and said: "Who's there? Make yoreself
knowed before I blasts you down!"</p>

<p>Whoever it was mumbled some excuse about being on the wrong
side, and the door closed. But the voice sounded kind of familiar,
and the feller didn't go into the other room. I heard his footsteps
sneaking off, and I riz and went to the door, and looked over
towards the row of stalls. So purty soon a man led the pinto out of
his stall, and swung aboard him and rode off. It was purty dark,
but if us folks on Bear Creek didn't have eyes like a hawk, we'd
never live to get grown. I seen it was the cowboy I'd seen in the
Apache Queen and outside the restaurant. Onst he got clear of the
wagon-yard, he slapped in the spurs and went racing through the
village like they was a red war-party on his trail. I could hear
the beat of his hoss's hoofs fading south down the rocky trail
after he was out of sight.</p>

<p>I knowed he must of follered me to the wagon-yard, but I
couldn't make no sense out of it, so I went and laid down on the
bunk again. I was jest about to go to sleep when I was woke by the
sounds of somebody coming into the other room of the cabin, and I
heard somebody strike a match. The bunk was built agen the
partition wall, so they was only a few feet from me, though with
the log wall betwixt us.</p>

<p>They was two of them, from the sounds of their talking.</p>

<p>"I tell you," one of them was saying, "I don't like his looks. I
don't believe he's what he pertends to be. We better take no
chances, and clear out. After all, we cain't stay here forever.
These people air beginning to git suspicious, and if they find out
for shore, they'll be demandin' a cut in the profits, to pertect
us. The stuff's all packed and ready to jump at a second's notice.
Let's run for it tonight. It's a wonder nobody ain't never stumbled
onto that hide-out before now."</p>

<p>"Aw," said the other'n, "these Grizzly Claw yaps don't do
nothin' but swill licker and gamble and think up swindles to work
on sech strangers as is unlucky enough to wander in here. They
don't never go into the hills southwest of the village whar our
cave is. Most of 'em don't even know there's a path past that big
rock to the west."</p>

<p>"Well, Bill," said t'other'n, "we've done purty well, countin'
that job up in the Bear Creek country."</p>

<p>At that I was wide awake and listening with both ears.</p>

<p>Bill laughed. "That was kind of funny, warn't it, Jim?" says
he.</p>

<p>"You ain't never told me the particulars," says Jim. "Did you
have any trouble?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Bill. "T'warn't to say easy. That old Jeppard
Grimes was a hard old nut. If all Injun fighters was like him, I
feel plumb sorry for the Injuns."</p>

<p>"If any of them Bear Creek devils ever catches you&mdash;" begun
Jim.</p>

<p>Bill laughed again.</p>

<p>"Them hillbillies never strays more'n ten miles from Bear
Creek," says he. "I had the sculp and was gone before they knowed
what was up. I've collected bounties for wolves and b'ars, but
that's the first time I ever got money for a human sculp!"</p>

<p>A icy chill run down my spine. Now I knowed what had happened to
pore old Uncle Jeppard! Scalped! After all the Injun sculps he'd
lifted! And them cold- blooded murderers could set there and talk
about it like it was the ears of a coyote or a rabbit!</p>

<p>"I told him he'd had the use of that there sculp long enough,"
Bill was saying. "A old cuss like him&mdash;"</p>

<p>I waited for no more. Everything was red around me. I didn't
stop for my boots, guns nor nothing. I was too crazy mad even to
know sech things existed. I riz up from that bunk and put my head
down and rammed that partition wall like a bull going through a
rail fence.</p>

<p>The dried mud poured out of the chinks and some of the logs give
way, and a howl went up from the other side.</p>

<p>"What's that?" hollered one, and t'other'n yelled: "Lookout!
It's a b'ar!"</p>

<p>I drawed back and rammed the wall again. It caved inwards and I
crashed headlong through it in a shower of dry mud and splinters,
and somebody shot at me and missed. They was a lighted lantern
setting on a hand-hewn table, and two men about six feet tall each
that hollered and let <i>bam</i> at me with their six-shooters. But
they was too dumbfounded to shoot straight. I gathered 'em to my
bosom and we went backwards over the table, taking it and the
lantern with us, and you ought to of heard them critters howl when
the burning ile splashed down their necks.</p>

<p>It was a dirt floor so nothing caught on fire, and we was
fighting in the dark, and they was hollering: "Help! Murder! We are
bein' 'sassinated! Ow! Release my ear!" And then one of 'em got his
boot heel wedged in my mouth, and whilst I was twisting it out with
one hand, the other'n tore out of his shirt which I was gripping
with t'other hand, and run out the door. I had hold of the other
feller's foot and commenced trying to twist it off, when he
wrenched his laig outa the boot, and took it on the run. When I
started to foller him I fell over the table in the dark and got all
tangled up in it.</p>

<p>I broke off a laig for a club and rushed to the door, and jest
as I got to it a whole mob of folks come surging into the
wagon-yard with torches and guns and dogs and a rope, and they
hollered: "There he is, the murderer, the outlaw, the
counterfeiter, the house-burner, the mule-killer!"</p>

<p>I seen the man that owned the mule, and the restaurant feller,
and the bar-keep, and a lot of others. They come roaring and
bellering up to the door, hollering: "Hang him! Hang him! String up
the murderer!" And they begun shooting at me, so I fell amongst 'em
with my table-laig and laid right and left till it busted. They was
packed so clost together I laid out three or four at a lick, and
they hollered something awful. The torches was all knocked down and
trompled out except them which was held by fellers which danced
around on the aidge of the mill, hollering: "Lay hold on him! Don't
be scairt of the big hillbilly! Shoot him! Knife him! Knock him in
the head!" The dogs having more sense than the men, they all run
off except one big mongrel that looked like a wolf, and he bit the
mob often'ern he did me.</p>

<p>They was a lot of wild shooting and men hollering: "Oh, I'm
shot! I'm kilt! I'm dyin'!" and some of them bullets burnt my hide
they come so clost, and the flashes singed my eye-lashes, and
somebody broke a knife agen my belt buckle. Then I seen the torches
was all gone except one, and my club was broke, so I bust right
through the mob, swinging right and left with my fists and stomping
on them that tried to drag me down. I got clear of everybody except
the man with the torch who was so excited he was jumping up and
down trying to shoot me without cocking his gun. That blame dog was
snapping at my heels, so I swung him by the tail and hit the man
over the head with him. They went down in a heap and the torch went
out, and the dog clamped onto the feller's ear, and he let out a
squall like a steam-whistle.</p>

<p>They was milling in the dark behind me, and I run straight to
Cap'n Kidd's stall and jumped on him bareback with nothing but a
hackamore on him. Jest as the mob located where I went, we come
storming out of the stall like a hurricane and knocked some of 'em
galley-west and run over some more, and headed for the gate.
Somebody shet the gate but Cap'n Kidd took it in his stride, and we
was gone into the darkness before they knowed what hit 'em.</p>

<p>Cap'n Kidd decided then was a good time to run away, like he
usually does, so he taken to the hills and run through bushes and
clumps of trees trying to scrape me off. When I finally pulled him
up we was maybe a mile south of the village, with Cap'n Kidd no
bridle nor saddle nor blanket, and me with no guns, knife, boots
nor hat. And what was wuss, them devils which sculped Uncle Jeppard
had got away from me, and I didn't know where to look for 'em.</p>

<p>I sot meditating whether to go back and fight the whole town of
Grizzly Claw for my boots and guns, or what to do, when all to onst
I remembered what Bill and Jim had said about a cave and a path
running to it. I thought I bet them fellers will go back and get
their hosses and pull out, jest like they was planning, and they
had stuff in the cave, so that's the place to look for 'em. I hoped
they hadn't already got the stuff, whatever it was, and gone.</p>

<p>I knowed where that rock was, because I'd saw it when I come
into town that afternoon&mdash;a big rock that jutted up above the
trees about a mile to the west of Grizzly Claw. So I started out
through the bresh, and before long I seen it looming up agen the
stars, and I made straight for it. Sure enough, they was a narrer
trail winding around the base and leading off to the southwest. I
follered it, and when I'd went nearly a mile, I come to a steep
mountainside, all clustered with bresh.</p>

<p>When I seen that I slipped off and led Cap'n Kidd off the trail
and tied him back amongst the trees. Then I crope up to the cave
which was purty well masked with bushes. I listened, but everything
was dark and still, but all to onst, away down the trail, I heard a
burst of shots, and what sounded like hosses running. Then
everything was still again, and I quick ducked into the cave, and
struck a match.</p>

<p>They was a narrer entrance that broadened out after a few feet,
and the cave run straight like a tunnel for maybe thirty steps,
about fifteen foot wide, and then it made a bend. After that it
widened out and got purty big&mdash;about fifty feet wide, and I
couldn't tell how far back into the mountain it run. To the left
the wall was very broken and notched with ledges, mighty nigh like
stair-steps, and when the match went out, away up above me I seen
some stars which meant that they was a cleft in the wall or roof
away up on the mountain somewheres.</p>

<p>Before the match went out, I seen a lot of junk over in a corner
covered up with a tarpaulin, and when I was fixing to strike
another match I heard men coming up the trail outside. So I quick
clumb up the broken wall and laid on a ledge about ten feet up and
listened.</p>

<p>From the sounds as they arriv at the cave mouth, I knowed it was
two men on foot, running hard and panting loud. They rushed into
the cave and made the turn, and I heard 'em fumbling around. Then a
light flared up and I seen a lantern being lit and hung up on a
spur of rock.</p>

<p>In the light I seen them two murderers, Bill and Jim, and they
looked plumb dilapidated. Bill didn't have no shirt on and the
other'n was wearing jest one boot and limped. Bill didn't have no
gun in his belt neither, and both was mauled and bruised, and
scratched, too, like they'd been running through briars.</p>

<p>"Look here," said Jim, holding his head which had a welt on it
which was likely made by my fist. "I ain't sartain in my mind as to
jest what all <i>has</i> happened. Somebody must of hit me with a
club some time tonight, and things is happened too fast for my
addled wits. Seems like we been fightin' and runnin' all night.
Listen, <i>was</i> we settin' in the wagon-yard shack talkin'
peaceable, and <i>did</i> a grizzly b'ar bust through the wall and
nigh slaughter us?"</p>

<p>"That's plumb correct," said Bill. "Only it warn't no b'ar. It
was some kind of a human critter&mdash;maybe a escaped maneyack. We
ought to of stopped for hosses&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I warn't thinkin' 'bout no hosses," broke in Jim. "When I found
myself outside that shack my only thought was to kiver ground, and
I done my best, considerin' that I'd lost a boot, and that critter
had nigh onhinged my hind laig. I'd lost you in the dark, so I made
for the cave knowin' you'd come there eventual, if you was still
alive, and it seemed like I was forever gittin' through the woods,
crippled like I was. I hadn't no more'n hit the path when you come
up it on the run."</p>

<p>"Well," says Bill, "as I went over the wagon-yard wall a lot of
people come whoopin' through the gate, and I thought they was after
us, but it must of been the feller we fit, because as I run I seen
him layin' into 'em right and left. After I'd got over my panic, I
went back after our hosses, but I run right into a gang of men on
hossback, and one of 'em was that derned feller which passed
hisself off as a cowboy. I didn't need no more. I taken out through
the woods as hard as I could pelt, and they hollered, 'There he
goes!' and hot-foot after me."</p>

<p>"And was them the fellers I shot at back down the trail?" ast
Jim.</p>

<p>"Yeah," says Bill. "I thought I'd shooken 'em off, but jest as I
seen you on the path, I heard hosses comin' behind us, so I
hollered to let 'em have it, and you did."</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't know who it was," said Jim. "I tell you, my
head's buzzin' like a circle-saw."</p>

<p>"Well," said Bill, "we stopped 'em and scattered 'em. I dunno if
you hit anybody in the dark, but they'll be mighty keerful about
comin' up the trail. Let's clear out."</p>

<p>"On foot?" says Jim. "And me with jest one boot?"</p>

<p>"How else?" says Bill. "We'll have to hoof it till we can steal
us some cayuses. We'll have to leave all this stuff here. We don't
dare go back to Grizzly Claw after our hosses. I <i>told</i> that
derned cowboy would do to watch. He ain't no cowpoke at all. He's a
blame detective."</p>

<p>"What's that?" broke in Jim.</p>

<p>"Hosses' hoofs!" exclaimed Bill, turning pale. "Here, blow out
that lantern! We'll climb the ledges and git out through the cleft,
and take out over the mountain whar they cain't foller with hosses,
and then&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was at that instant that I launched myself offa the ledge on
top of 'em. I landed with all my two hundred and ninety pounds
square on Jim's shoulders and when he hit the ground under me he
kind of spread out like a toad when you tromp on him. Bill give a
scream of astonishment and tore off a hunk of rock about the size
of a man's head and lammed me over the ear with it as I riz. This
irritated me, so I taken him by the neck, and also taken away a
knife which he was trying to hamstring me with, and begun sweeping
the floor with his carcass.</p>

<p>Presently I paused and kneeling on him, I strangled him till his
tongue lolled out, whilst hammering his head fervently agen the
rocky floor.</p>

<p>"You murderin' devil!" I gritted betwixt my teeth. "Before I
varnishes this here rock with yore brains, tell me why you taken my
Uncle Jeppard's sculp!"</p>

<p>"Let up!" he gurgled, being purple in the face where he warn't
bloody. "They was a dude travellin' through the country and
collectin' souvenirs, and he heard about that sculp and wanted it.
He hired me to go git it for him."</p>

<p>I was so shocked at that cold-bloodedness that I forgot what I
was doing and choked Bill nigh to death before I remembered to ease
up on him.</p>

<p>"Who was he?" I demanded. "Who is the skunk which hires old men
murdered so's he can colleck their sculps? My God, these Eastern
dudes is wuss'n Apaches! Hurry up and tell me, so I can finish
killin' you."</p>

<p>But he was unconscious; I'd squoze his neck too hard. I riz up
and looked around for some water or whisky or something to bring
him to so he could tell who hired him to sculp Uncle Jeppard,
before I twisted his head off, which was my earnest intention of
doing, when somebody said: "Han's up!"</p>

<p>I whirled and there at the crook of the cave stood that there
cowboy which had spied on me in Grizzly Claw, and ten other men.
They all had their Winchesters p'inted at me, and the cowboy had a
star on his buzum.</p>

<p>"Don't move!" he said. "I'm a Federal detective, and I'm
arrestin' you for manufactorin' counterfeit money!"</p>

<p>"What you mean?" I snarled, backing up to the wall.</p>

<p>"You know," he said, kicking the tarpaulin off the junk in the
corner. "Look here, men! All the stamps and dyes he used to make
phoney coins and bills! All packed up, ready to light out. I been
hangin' around Grizzly Claw for days, knowin' that whoever was
passin' this stuff made his, or their headquarters here somewheres.
Today I spotted that dollar you give the bar-keep, and I went
<i>pronto</i> for my men which was camped back in the hills a few
miles. I thought you was settled in the wagon-yard for the night,
but it seems you give us the slip. Put the cuffs on him, men!"</p>

<p>"No, you don't!" I snarled, bounding back. "Not till I've
finished these devils on the floor&mdash;and maybe not then! I
dunno what yo're talkin' about, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Here's a couple of corpses!" hollered one of the men. "He's
kilt a couple of fellers!"</p>

<p>One of them stooped over Bill, but he had recovered his senses,
and now he riz up on his elbows and give a howl. "Save me!" he
bellered. "I confesses! I'm a counterfeiter, and so is Jim there on
the floor! We surrenders, and you got to pertect us!"</p>

<p>"<i>Yo're</i> the counterfeiters?" ejaculated the detective,
took aback as it were. "Why, I was follerin' this giant! I seen him
pass fake money myself. We got to the wagon-yard awhile after he'd
run off, but we seen him duck in the woods not far from there, and
we been chasin' him. He shot at us down the trail while
ago&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That was us," said Bill. "It was me you was chasin'. If he was
passin' fake stuff, he musta found it somewheres. I tell you, we're
the men you're after, and you got to pertect us! I demands to be
put in the strongest jail in this state, which even this here devil
cain't bust into!"</p>

<p>"And he ain't no counterfeiter?" said the detective.</p>

<p>"He ain't nothin' but a man-eater," said Bill. "Arrest us and
take us outa his rech."</p>

<p>"<i>No!</i>" I roared, clean beside myself. "They belongs to me!
They sculped my uncle! Give 'em knives or guns or somethin', and
let us fight it out."</p>

<p>"Cain't do that," said the detective. "They're Federal
prisoners. If you got any charge agen 'em, they'll have to be
indicted in the proper form."</p>

<p>His men hauled 'em up and handcuffed 'em and started to lead 'em
out.</p>

<p>"Blast yore cussed souls!" I raved. "You low-down, mangy,
egg-suckin' coyotes! Does you mean to perteck a couple of dirty
sculpers? I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>I started for 'em and they all p'inted their Winchesters at
me.</p>

<p>"Keep back!" said the detective. "I'm grateful for you leadin'
us into this den, and layin' out these criminals for us, but I
don't hanker after no battle in a cave with a human grizzly like
you."</p>

<p>Well, what could I do? If I'd had my guns, or even my knife, I'd
of took a chance with the whole eleven men, officers or not, but
even I can't fight eleven .45-90's with my bare hands. I stood
speechless with rage whilst they filed out, and then I went for
Cap'n Kidd in a kind of a daze. I felt wuss'n a hoss-thief. Them
fellers would be put in the pen safe out of my rech, and Uncle
Jeppard's sculp was unavenged! It was awful. I felt like
bawling.</p>

<p>Time I got my hoss back onto the trail, the posse with their
prisoners was out of sight and hearing. I seen the only thing to do
was to go back to Grizzly Claw and get my outfit, and then foller
'em and try to take their prisoners away from 'em some way.</p>

<p>Well, the wagon-yard was dark and still. The wounded had been
carried away to have their injuries bandaged, and from the groaning
that was still coming from the shacks and cabins along the street,
the casualities had been plenteous. The citizens of Grizzly Claw
must have been shook up something terrible, because they hadn't
even stole my guns and saddle and things yet; everything was in the
cabin jest like I'd left 'em.</p>

<p>I put on my boots, hat and belt, saddled and bridled Cap'n Kidd
and sot out on the road I knowed the posse had took. But they had a
long start on me, and when daylight come I hadn't overtook 'em,
though I knowed they couldn't be far ahead of me. But I did meet
somebody else. It was Tunk Willoughby riding up the trail, and when
he seen me he grinned all over his battered features.</p>

<p>"Hey, Breck!" he hailed me. "After you left I sot on that there
log and thunk, and thunk, and I finally remembered what Jack Gordon
told me, and I started out to find you again and tell you. It was
this: he said to keep a close lookout for a feller from Grizzly
Claw named Bill Croghan, because he'd gypped yore Uncle Jeppard in
a deal."</p>

<p><i>"What?"</i> I said.</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Tunk. "He bought somethin' from Jeppard and paid
him in counterfeit money. Jeppard didn't know it was phoney till
after the feller had got plumb away," said Tunk, "and bein' as he
was too busy kyorin' some b'ar meat to go after him, he sent word
for you to git him."</p>

<p>"But the sculp&mdash;" I said wildly.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Tunk, "that was what Jeppard sold the feller. It was
the sculp Jeppard taken offa old Yeller Eagle, the Comanche
war-chief forty years ago, and been keepin' for a souvenear. Seems
like a Eastern dude heard about it and wanted to buy it, but this
Croghan feller must of kept the money he give him to git it with,
and give Jeppard phoney cash. So you see everything's all right,
even if I did forgit a little, and no harm did&mdash;"</p>

<p>And that's why Tunk Willoughby is going around saying I'm a
homicidal maneyack, and run him five miles down a mountain and
tried to kill him&mdash; which is a exaggeration, of course. I
wouldn't of kilt him if I could of caught him&mdash;which I
couldn't when he taken to the thick bresh. I would merely of raised
a few knots on his head and tied his hind laigs in a bow-knot
around his fool neck, and did a few other little things that might
of improved his memory.</p>

<h2><a id="gent9" name="gent9">9. CUPID FROM BEAR CREEK</a>
</h2>

<p style="text-indent:0">WHEN I reined my hoss towards War Paint
again, I didn't go back the way I'd come. I was so far off my route
that I knowed it would be nearer to go through the mountains by the
way of Teton Gulch than it would be to go clean back to the
Yavapai-War Paint road. So I headed out.</p>

<p>I aimed to pass right through Teton Gulch without stopping,
because I was in a hurry to get back to War Paint and Dolly Rixby,
but my thirst got the best of me, and I stopped in the camp. It was
one of them new mining towns that springs up overnight like
mushrooms. I was drinking me a dram at the bar of the Yaller Dawg
Saloon and Hotel, when the bar-keep says, after studying me a
spell, he says: "You must be Breckinridge Elkins, of Bear
Creek."</p>

<p>I give the matter due consideration, and 'lowed as how I
was.</p>

<p>"How come you knowed me?" I inquired suspiciously, because I
hadn't never been in Teton Gulch before, and he says: "Well, I've
heard tell of Breckinridge Elkins, and when I seen you, I figgered
you must be him, because I don't see how they can be two men in the
world that big. By the way, there's a friend of yore'n
upstairs&mdash;Blink Wiltshaw, from War Paint. I've heered him brag
about knowin' you personal. He's upstairs now, fourth door from the
stair-head, on the left."</p>

<p>So Blink had come back to Teton, after all. Well, that suited me
fine, so I thought I'd go up and pass the time of day with him, and
find out if he had any news from War Paint, which I'd been gone
from for about a week. A lot of things can happen in a week in a
fast-moving town like War Paint.</p>

<p>I went upstairs and knocked on the door, and <i>bam!</i> went a
gun inside and a .45 slug ripped through the door and taken a nick
out of my off- ear. Getting shot in the ear always did irritate me,
so without waiting for no more exhibitions of hospitality, I give
voice to my displeasure in a deafening beller and knocked the door
off'n its hinges and busted into the room over its rooins.</p>

<p>For a second I didn't see nobody, but then I heard a kind of
gurgle going on, and happened to remember that the door seemed kind
of squishy underfoot when I tromped over it, so I knowed that
whoever was in the room had got pinned under the door when I
knocked it down.</p>

<p>So I reched under it and got him by the collar and hauled him
out, and sure enough it was Blink Wiltshaw. He was limp as a
lariat, and glassy-eyed and pale, and was still trying to shoot me
with his six-shooter when I taken it away from him.</p>

<p>"What the hell's the matter with you?" I demanded sternly,
dangling him by the collar with one hand, whilst shaking him till
his teeth rattled. "Didn't Dolly make us shake hands? What you mean
by tryin' to 'sasserinate me through a hotel door?"</p>

<p>"Lemme down, Breck," he gasped. "I didn't know it was you. I
thought it was Rattlesnake Harrison comin' after my gold."</p>

<p>So I sot him down. He grabbed a jug of licker and taken him a
swig, and his hand shook so he spilt half of it down his neck.</p>

<p>"Well?" I demanded. "Ain't you goin' to offer me a snort, dern
it?"</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Breckinridge," he apolergized. "I'm so derned jumpy
I dunno what I'm doin'. You see them buckskin pokes?" says he,
p'inting at some bags on the bed. "Them is plumb full of nuggets. I
got a claim up the Gulch, and the day I got back from War Paint I
hit a regular bonanza. But it ain't doin' me no good."</p>

<p>"What you mean?" I ast.</p>

<p>"The mountains around Teton is full of outlaws," says he. "They
robs and murders every man which makes a strike. The stagecoach has
been stuck up so often nobody sends their dust out on it no more.
When a man makes a pile he sneaks out through the mountains at
night, with his gold on pack-mules. I aimed to do that last night.
But them outlaws has got spies all over the camp, and I know they
got me spotted. Rattlesnake Harrison's their chief, and he's a
ring- tailed he-devil. I been squattin' over this here gold with my
pistol in fear and tremblin', expectin' 'em to come right into camp
after me. I'm dern nigh loco!"</p>

<p>And he shivered and cussed kind of whimpery, and taken another
dram, and cocked his pistol and sot there shaking like he'd saw a
ghost or two.</p>

<p>"You got to help me, Breckinridge," he said desperately. "You
take this here gold out for me, willya? The outlaws don't know you.
<i>You</i> could hit the old Injun path south of the camp and
foller it to Hell-Wind Pass. The Chawed Ear-Wahpeton stage goes
there about sundown. You could put the gold on the stage there, and
they'd take it on to Wahpeton. Harrison wouldn't never think of
holdin' it up <i>after</i> it left Hell-Wind. They always holds it
up this side of the Pass."</p>

<p>"What I want to risk my neck for you for?" I demanded bitterly,
memories of Dolly Rixby rising up before me. "If you ain't got the
guts to tote out yore own gold&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Tain't altogether the gold, Breck," says he. "I'm tryin' to
git married, and&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>"Married?"</i> says I. "Here? In Teton Gulch? To a gal in
Teton Gulch?"</p>

<p>"Maried to a gal in Teton Gulch," he avowed. "I was aimin' to
git hitched tomorrer, but they ain't a preacher or a justice of the
peace in camp to tie the knot. But her uncle the Reverant Rembrandt
Brockton is a circuit rider, and he's due to pass through Hell-Wind
Pass on his way to Wahpeton today. I was aimin' to sneak out last
night, hide in the hills till the stage come through, and then put
the gold on it and bring Brother Rembrandt back with me. But
yesterday I learnt Harrison's spies was watchin' me, and I'm scairt
to go. Now Brother Rembrandt will go on to Wahpeton, not knowin'
he's needed here, and no tellin' when I'll be able to git
married&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold on," I said hurriedly, doing some quick thinking. I didn't
want this here wedding to fall through. The more Blink was married
to some gal in Teton, the less he could marry Dolly Rixby.</p>

<p>"Blink," I said, grasping his hand warmly, "never let it be said
that a Elkins ever turned down a friend in distress. I'll take yore
gold to Hell-Wind Pass and bring back Brother Rembrandt."</p>

<p>Blink fell onto my neck and wept with joy. "I'll never forgit
this, Breckinridge," says he, "and I bet you won't neither! My hoss
and pack-mule are in the stables behind the saloon."</p>

<p>"I don't need no pack-mule," I says. "Cap'n Kidd can pack the
dust easy."</p>

<p>Cap'n Kidd was getting fed out in the corral next to the hotel.
I went out there and got my saddle-bags, which is a lot bigger'n
most saddle-bags, because all my plunder has to be made to fit my
size. They're made outa three- ply elkskin, stitched with rawhide
thongs, and a wildcat couldn't claw his way out of 'em.</p>

<p>I noticed quite a bunch of men standing around the corral
looking at Cap'n Kidd, but thunk nothing of it, because he is a
hoss which naturally attracks attention. But whilst I was getting
my saddle-bags, a long lanky cuss with long yaller whiskers come up
and said, says he: "Is that yore hoss in the corral?"</p>

<p>I says: "If he ain't he ain't nobody's."</p>

<p>"Well, he looks a whole lot like a hoss that was stole off my
ranch six months ago," he said, and I seen ten or fifteen
hard-looking <i>hombres</i> gathering around me. I laid down my
saddle-bags sudden-like and reched for my guns, when it occurred to
me that if I had a fight there I might get arrested and it would
interfere with me bringing Brother Rembrandt in for the
wedding.</p>

<p>"If that there is yore hoss," I said, "you ought to be able to
lead him out of that there corral."</p>

<p>"Shore I can," he says with a oath. "And what's more, I
aim'ta."</p>

<p>"That's right, Jake," says another feller. "Stand up for yore
rights. Us boys is right behind you."</p>

<p>"Go ahead," I says. "If he's yore hoss, prove it. Go git
him!"</p>

<p>He looked at me suspiciously, but he taken up a rope and clumb
the fence and started towards Cap'n Kidd which was chawing on a
block of hay in the middle of the corral. Cap'n Kidd throwed up his
head and laid back his ears and showed his teeth, and Jake stopped
sudden and turned pale.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't believe that there <i>is</i> my hoss, after
all!" says he.</p>

<p>"Put that lasso on him!" I roared, pulling my right-hand gun.
"You say he's yore'n; I say he's mine. One of us is a liar and a
hoss-thief and I aim to prove which. Gwan, before I festoons yore
system with lead polka-dots!"</p>

<p>"He looked at me and he looked at Cap'n Kidd, and he turned
bright green all over. He looked again at my .45 which I now had
cocked and p'inted at his long neck, which his adam's apple was
going up and down like a monkey on a pole, and he begun to aidge
towards Cap'n Kidd again, holding the rope behind him and sticking
out one hand.</p>

<p>"Whoa, boy," he says, kind of shudderingly. "Whoa&mdash;good old
feller&mdash;nice hossie&mdash;whoa, boy&mdash;<i>ow!</i>"</p>

<p>He let out a awful howl as Cap'n Kidd made a snap and bit a
chunk out of his hide. He turned to run but Cap'n Kidd wheeled and
let fly both heels which catched Jake in the seat of the britches,
and his shriek of despair was horrible to hear as he went
head-first through the corral-fence into a hoss-trough on the other
side. From this he ariz dripping water, blood and profanity, and he
shook a quivering fist at me and croaked: "You derned murderer!
I'll have yore life for this!"</p>

<p>"I don't hold no conversation with hoss-thieves," I snorted, and
picked up my saddle-bags and stalked through the crowd which give
back in a hurry and take care to cuss under their breath when I
tromped on their fool toes.</p>

<p>I taken the saddle-bags up to Blink's room, and told him about
Jake, thinking he'd be amoosed, but he got a case of the aggers
again, and said: "That was one of Harrison's men! He aimed to take
yore hoss. It's a old trick, and honest folks don't dare interfere.
Now they got you spotted! What'll you do?"</p>

<p>"Time, tide and a Elkins waits for no man!" I snorted, dumping
the gold into the saddle-bags. "If that yaller-whiskered coyote
wants any trouble, he can git a bellyfull! Don't worry, yore gold
will be safe in my saddle-bags. It's as good as in the Wahpeton
stage right now. And by midnight I'll be back with Brother
Rembrandt Brockton to hitch you up with his niece."</p>

<p>"Don't yell so loud," begged Blink. "The cussed camp's full of
spies. Some of 'em may be downstairs right now, lissenin'."</p>

<p>"I warn't speakin' above a whisper," I said indignantly.</p>

<p>"That bull's beller may pass for a whisper on Bear Creek," says
he, wipin' off the sweat, "but I bet they can hear it from one end
of the Gulch to the other'n, at least."</p>

<p>It's a pitable sight to see a man with a case of the scairts. I
shook hands with him and left him pouring red licker down his
gullet like it was water, and I swung the saddle-bags over my
shoulder and went downstairs, and the bar-keep leaned over the bar
and whispered to me: "Look out for Jake Roman! He was in here a
minute ago, lookin' for trouble. He pulled out jest before you come
down, but he won't be forgittin' what yore hoss done to him."</p>

<p>"Not when he tries to set down, he won't," I agreed, and went
out to the corral, and they was a crowd of men watching Cap'n Kidd
eat his hay, and one of 'em seen me and hollered: "Hey, boys, here
comes the giant! He's goin' to saddle that man-eatin' monster! Hey,
Bill! Tell the boys at the bar."</p>

<p>And here come a whole passel of fellers running out of all the
saloons, and they lined the corral fence solid, and started laying
bets whether I'd get the saddle onto Cap'n Kidd, or get my brains
kicked out. I thought miners must all be crazy. They ought've
knowed I was able to saddle my own hoss.</p>

<p>Well, I saddled him and throwed on the saddle-bags and clumb
aboard, and he pitched about ten jumps like he always does when I
first fork him&mdash; 'twarn't nothing, but them miners hollered
like wild Injuns. And when he accidentally bucked hisself and me
through the fence and knocked down a section of it along with
fifteen men which was setting on the top rail, the way they howled
you'd of thought something terrible had happened. Me and Cap'n Kidd
don't bother about gates. We usually makes our own through whatever
happens to be in front of us. But them miners is a weakly breed. As
I rode out of town I seen the crowd dipping nine or ten of 'em into
a hoss-trough to bring 'em to, on account of Cap'n Kidd having
accidentally tromped on 'em.</p>

<p>Well, I rode out of the Gulch and up the ravine to the south and
come out into the high-timbered country, and hit the old Injun
trail Blink had told me about. It warn't traveled much. I didn't
meet nobody after I left the Gulch. I figgered to hit Hell-Wind
Pass at least a hour before sundown which would give me plenty of
time. Blink said the stage passed through there about sundown. I'd
have to bring back Brother Rembrandt on Cap'n Kidd, I reckoned, but
that there hoss can carry double and still out-run and out-last any
other hoss in the State of Nevada. I figgered on getting back to
Teton about midnight or maybe a little later.</p>

<p>After I'd went several miles I come to Apache Canyon, which was
a deep, narrer gorge, with a river at the bottom which went roaring
and foaming along betwixt rock walls a hundred and fifty feet high.
The old trail hit the rim at a place where the canyon warn't only
about seventy foot wide, and somebody had felled a whopping big
pine tree on one side so it fell acrost and made a foot- bridge,
where a man could walk acrost. They'd onst been a gold strike in
Apache Canyon, and a big camp there, but now it was plumb abandoned
and nobody lives anywheres near it.</p>

<p>I turned east and follered the rim for about half a mile. Here I
come into a old wagon road which was jest about growed up with
saplings now, but it run down into a ravine into the bed of the
canyon, and they was a bridge acrost the river which had been built
during the days of the gold rush. Most of it had done been washed
away by head-rises, but a man could still ride a hoss acrost what
was left. So I done so, and rode up a ravine on the other side, and
come out on high ground again.</p>

<p>I'd rode a few hundred yards past the mouth of the ravine when
somebody said: "Hey!" and I wheeled with both guns in my hands. Out
of the bresh sa'ntered a tall gent in a long frock tail coat and
broad-brimmed hat.</p>

<p>"Who air you and what the hell you mean by hollerin' 'Hey!' at
me?" I demanded courteously, p'inting my guns at him. A Elkins is
always perlite.</p>

<p>"I am the Reverant Rembrandt Brockton, my good man," says he. "I
am on my way to Teton Gulch to unite my niece and a young man of
that camp in the bonds of holy matrimony."</p>

<p>"The he&mdash;you don't say!" I says. "Afoot?"</p>

<p>"I alit from the stagecoach at&mdash;ah&mdash;Hades-Wind Pass,"
says he. "Some very agreeable cowboys happened to be awaiting the
stage there, and they offered to escort me to Teton."</p>

<p>"How come you knowed yore niece was wantin' to be united in
acrimony?" I ast.</p>

<p>"The cowpersons informed me that such was the case," says
he.</p>

<p>"Where-at are they now?" I next inquore.</p>

<p>"The mount with which they supplied me went lame a little while
ago," says he. "They left me here while they went to procure
another from a nearby ranch-house."</p>

<p>"I dunno who'd have a ranch anywheres around near here," I
muttered. "They ain't got much sense leavin' you here by yore high
lonesome."</p>

<p>"You mean to imply there is danger?" says he, blinking mildly at
me.</p>

<p>"These here mountains is lousy with outlaws which would as soon
kyarve a preacher's gullet as anybody's," I said, and then I
thought of something else. "Hey!" I says. "I thought the stage
didn't come through the Pass till sundown?"</p>

<p>"Such was the case," says he. "But the schedule has been
altered."</p>

<p>"Heck!" I says. "I was aimin' to put this here gold on it which
my saddle-bags is full of. Now I'll have to take it back to Teton
with me. Well, I'll bring it out tomorrer and catch the stage then.
Brother Rembrandt, I'm Breckinridge Elkins of Bear Creek, and I
come out here to meet you and escort you back to the Gulch, so's
you can unite yore niece and Blink Wiltshaw in the holy bounds of
alimony. Come on. We'll ride double."</p>

<p>"But I must await my cowboy friends!" he said. "Ah, here they
come now!"</p>

<p>I looked over to the east, and seen about fifteen men ride into
sight and move towards us. One was leading a hoss without no saddle
onto it.</p>

<p>"Ah, my good friends!" beamed Brother Rembrandt. "They have
procured a mount for me, even as they promised."</p>

<p>He hauled a saddle out of the bresh, and says: "Would you please
saddle my horse for me when they get here? I should be delighted to
hold your rifle while you did so."</p>

<p>I started to hand him my Winchester, when the snap of a twig
under a hoss's hoof made me whirl quick. A feller had jest rode out
of a thicket about a hundred yards south of me, and he was raising
a Winchester to his shoulder. I recognized him instantly. If us
Bear Creek folks didn't have eyes like a hawk, we'd never live to
get growed. It was Jake Roman!</p>

<p>Our Winchesters banged together. His lead fanned my ear and mine
knocked him end-ways out of his saddle.</p>

<p>"Cowboys, hell!" I roared. "Them's Harrison's outlaws! I'll save
you, Brother Rembrandt!"</p>

<p>I swooped him up with one arm and gouged Cap'n Kidd with the
spurs and he went from there like a thunderbolt with its tail on
fire. Them outlaws come on with wild yells. I ain't in the habit of
running from people, but I was afeared they might do the Reverant
harm if it come to a close fight, and if he stopped a chunk of
lead, Blink might not get to marry his niece, and might get
disgusted and go back to War Paint and start sparking Dolly Rixby
again.</p>

<p>I was heading for the canyon, aiming to make a stand in the
ravine if I had to, and them outlaws was killing their hosses
trying to get to the bend of the trail ahead of me, and cut me off.
Cap'n Kidd was running with his belly to the ground, but I'll admit
Brother Rembrandt warn't helping me much. He was laying acrost my
saddle with his arms and laigs waving wildly because I hadn't had
time to set him comfortable, and when the horn jobbed him in the
belly he uttered some words I wouldn't of expected to hear spoke by
a minister of the gospel.</p>

<p>Guns begun to crack and lead hummed past us, and Brother
Rembrandt twisted his head around and screamed: "Stop
that&mdash;shootin', you&mdash;sons of&mdash;! You'll hit me!"</p>

<p>I thought it was kind of selfish from Brother Rembrandt not to
mention me, too, but I said: "'Tain't no use to remonstrate with
them skunks, Reverant. They ain't got no respeck for a preacher
even."</p>

<p>But to my amazement, the shooting did stop, though them bandits
yelled louder'n ever and flogged their cayuses harder. But about
that time I seen they had me cut off from the lower canyon
crossing, so I wrenched Cap'n Kidd into the old Injun track and
headed straight for the canyon rim as hard as he could hammer, with
the bresh lashing and snapping around us, and slapping Brother
Rembrandt in the face when it whipped back. Them outlaws yelled and
wheeled in behind us, but Cap'n Kidd drawed away from them with
every stride, and the canyon rim loomed jest ahead of us.</p>

<p>"Pull up, you jack-eared son of Baliol!" howled Brother
Rembrandt. "You'll go over the edge!"</p>

<p>"Be at ease, Reverant," I reassured him. "We're goin' over the
log."</p>

<p>"Lord have mercy on my soul!" he squalled, and shet his eyes and
grabbed a stirrup leather with both hands, and then Cap'n Kidd went
over that log like thunder rolling on Jedgment Day.</p>

<p>I doubt if they is another hoss west of the Pecos, or east of it
either, which would bolt out onto a log foot-bridge acrost a canyon
a hundred and fifty foot deep like that, but they ain't nothing in
this world Cap'n Kidd's scairt of except maybe me. He didn't
slacken his speed none. He streaked acrost that log like it was a
quarter-track, with the bark and splinters flying from under his
hoofs, and if one foot had slipped a inch, it would of been Sally
bar the door. But he didn't slip, and we was over and on the other
side almost before you could catch yore breath.</p>

<p>"You can open yore eyes now, Brother Rembrandt," I said kindly,
but he didn't say nothing. He'd fainted. I shaken him to wake him
up, and in a flash he come to and give a shriek and grabbed my laig
like a b'ar trap. I reckon he thought we was still on the log. I
was trying to pry him loose when Cap'n Kidd chose that moment to
run under a low-hanging oak tree limb. That's his idee of a joke.
That there hoss has got a great sense of humor.</p>

<p>I looked up jest in time to see the limb coming, but not in time
to dodge it. It was as big around as my thigh, and it took me smack
acrost the wish-bone. We was going full-speed, and something had to
give way. It was the girths&mdash;both of 'em. Cap'n Kidd went out
from under me, and me and Brother Rembrandt and the saddle hit the
ground together.</p>

<p>I jumped up but Brother Rembrandt laid there going: "Wug wug
wug!" like water running out of a busted jug. And then I seen them
cussed outlaws had dismounted off of their hosses and was coming
acrost the bridge single file on foot, with their Winchesters in
their hands.</p>

<p>I didn't waste no time shooting them misguided idjits. I run to
the end of the foot-bridge, ignoring the slugs they slung at me. It
was purty pore shooting, because they warn't shore of their
footing, and didn't aim good. So I only got one bullet in the hind
laig and was creased three or four other unimportant
places&mdash;not enough to bother about.</p>

<p>I bent my knees and got hold of the end of the tree and heaved
up with it, and them outlaws hollered and fell along it like ten
pins, and dropped their Winchesters and grabbed holt of the log. I
given it a shake and shook some of 'em off like persimmons off a
limb after a frost, and then I swung the butt around clear of the
rim and let go, and it went down end over end into the river a
hundred and fifty feet below, with a dozen men still hanging onto
it and yelling blue murder.</p>

<p>A regular geyser of water splashed up when they hit, and the
last I seen of 'em they was all swirling down the river together in
a thrashing tangle of arms and laigs and heads.</p>

<p>I remembered Brother Rembrandt and run back to where he'd fell,
but he was already on his feet. He was kind of pale and wild-eyed
and his laigs kept bending under him, but he had hold of the
saddle-bags, and was trying to drag 'em into a thicket, mumbling
kind of dizzily to hisself.</p>

<p>"It's all right now, Brother Rembrandt," I said kindly. "Them
outlaws is all horse-de-combat now, as the French say. Blink's gold
is safe."</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;" says Brother Rembrandt, pulling two guns from
under his coat tails, and if I hadn't grabbed him, he would of
ondoubtedly shot me. We rassled around and I protested: "Hold on,
Brother Rembrandt! I ain't no outlaw. I'm yore friend, Breckinridge
Elkins. Don't you remember?"</p>

<p>His only reply was a promise to eat my heart without no
seasoning, and he then sunk his teeth into my ear and started to
chaw it off, whilst gouging for my eyes with both thumbs, and
spurring me severely in the hind laigs. I seen he was out of his
head from fright and the fall he got, so I said sorrerfully:
"Brother Rembrandt, I hates to do this. It hurts me more'n it does
you, but we cain't waste time like this. Blink is waitin' to git
married." And with a sigh I busted him over the head with the butt
of my six-shooter, and he fell over and twitched a few times and
then lay limp.</p>

<p>"Pore Brother Rembrandt," I sighed sadly. "All I hope is I ain't
addled yore brains so's you've forgot the weddin' ceremony."</p>

<p>So as not to have no more trouble with him when, and if, he come
to, I tied his arms and laigs with pieces of my lariat, and taken
his weppins which was most surprising arms for a circuit rider. His
pistols had the triggers out of 'em, and they was three notches on
the butt of one, and four on t'other'n. Moreover he had a bowie
knife in his boot, and a deck of marked kyards and a pair of loaded
dice in his hip-pocket. But that warn't none of my business.</p>

<p>About the time I finished tying him up, Cap'n Kidd come back to
see if he'd kilt me or jest crippled me for life. To show him I
could take a joke too, I give him a kick in the belly, and when he
could get his breath again, and ondouble hisself, I throwed the
saddle on him. I spliced the girths with the rest of my lariat, and
put Brother Rembrandt in the saddle and clumb on behind and we
headed for Teton Gulch.</p>

<p>After a hour or so Brother Rembrandt come to and says kind of
dizzily: "Was anybody saved from the typhoon?"</p>

<p>"Yo're all right, Brother Rembrandt," I assured him. "I'm takin'
you to Teton Gulch."</p>

<p>"I remember," he muttered. "It all comes back to me. Damn Jake
Roman! I thought it was a good idea, but it seems I was mistaken. I
thought we had an ordinary human being to deal with. I know when
I'm licked. I'll give you a thousand dollars to let me go."</p>

<p>"Take it easy, Brother Rembrandt," I soothed, seeing he was
still delirious. "We'll be to Teton in no time."</p>

<p>"I don't want to go to Teton!" he hollered.</p>

<p>"You got to," I told him. "You got to unite yore niece and Blink
Wiltshaw in the holy bums of parsimony."</p>

<p>"To hell with Blink Wiltshaw and my &mdash;&mdash; niece!" he
yelled.</p>

<p>"You ought to be ashamed usin' sech langwidge, and you a
minister of the gospel," I reproved him sternly. His reply would of
curled a Piute's hair.</p>

<p>I was so scandalized I made no reply. I was jest fixing to untie
him, so's he could ride more comfortable, but I thought if he was
that crazy, I better not. So I give no heed to his ravings which
growed more and more unbearable as we progressed. In all my born
days I never seen sech a preacher.</p>

<p>It was sure a relief to me to sight Teton at last. It was night
when we rode down the ravine into the Gulch, and the dance halls
and saloons was going full blast. I rode up behind the Yaller Dawg
Saloon and hauled Brother Rembrandt off with me and sot him onto
his feet, and he said, kind of despairingly: "For the last time,
listen to reason. I've got fifty thousand dollars cached up in the
hills. I'll give you every cent if you'll untie me."</p>

<p>"I don't want no money," I said. "All I want is for you to marry
yore niece and Blink Wiltshaw. I'll untie you then."</p>

<p>"All right," he said. "All right! But untie me now!"</p>

<p>I was jest fixing to do it, when the bar-keep come out with a
lantern, and he shone it on our faces and said in a startled tone:
"Who the hell is that with you, Elkins?"</p>

<p>"You wouldn't never suspect it from his langwidge," I says, "but
it's the Reverant Rembrandt Brockton."</p>

<p>"Are you crazy?" says the bar-keep. "That's Rattle snake
Harrison!"</p>

<p>"I give up," said my prisoner. "I'm Harrison. I'm licked. Lock
me up somewhere away from this lunatic!"</p>

<p>I was standing in a kind of daze, with my mouth open, but now I
woke up and bellered: "<i>What?</i> Yo're Harrison? I see it all
now! Jake Roman overheard me talkin' to Blink Wiltshaw, and rode
off and fixed it with you to fool me like you done, so's to git
Blink's gold! That's why you wanted to hold my Winchester whilst I
saddled yore cayuse."</p>

<p>"How'd you ever guess it?" he sneered. "We ought to have shot
you from ambush like I wanted to, but Jake wanted to catch you
alive and torture you to death account of your horse bitin' him.
The fool must have lost his head at the last minute and decided to
shoot you after all. If you hadn't recognized him we'd had you
surrounded and stuck up before you knew what was happening."</p>

<p>"But now the real preacher's gone on to Wahpeton!" I hollered.
"I got to foller him and bring him back&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, he's here," said one of the men which was gathering around
us. "He come in with his niece a hour ago on the stage from War
Paint."</p>

<p>"War Paint?" I howled, hit in the belly by a premonishun. I run
into the saloon, where they was a lot of people, and there was
Blink and a gal holding hands in front of a old man with a long
white beard, and he had a book in his hand, and the other'n lifted
in the air. He was saying: "&mdash;And I now pernounces you-all man
and wife. Them which God has j'ined togither let no snake-hunter
put asunder."</p>

<p><i>"Dolly!"</i> I yelled. Both of 'em jumped about four foot and
whirled, and Dolly jumped in front of Blink and spread her arms
like she was shooing chickens.</p>

<p>"Don't you tech him, Breckinridge!" she hollered. "I jest
married him and I don't aim for no Humbolt grizzly to spile
him!"</p>

<p>"But I don't <i>sabe</i> all this&mdash;" I said dizzily,
nervously fumbling with my guns which is a habit of mine when
upsot.</p>

<p>Everybody in the wedding party started ducking out of line, and
Blink said hurriedly: "It's this way, Breck. When I made my pile so
onexpectedly quick, I sent for Dolly to come and marry me, like
she'd promised that night, jest after you pulled out for Yavapai. I
<i>was</i> aimin' to take my gold out today, like I told you, so me
and Dolly could go to San Francisco on our honeymoon, but I learnt
Harrison's gang was watchin' me, jest like I told you. I wanted to
git my gold out, and I wanted to git you out of the way before
Dolly and her uncle got here on the War Paint stage, so I told you
that there lie about Brother Rembrandt bein' on the Wahpeton stage.
It was the only lie."</p>

<p>"You said you was marryin' a gal in Teton," I accused
fiercely.</p>

<p>"Well," says he, "I did marry her in Teton. You know, Breck,
all's fair in love and war."</p>

<p>"Now, now, boys," says Brother Rembrandt&mdash;the real one, I
mean. "The gal's married, yore rivalry is over, and they's no use
holdin' grudges. Shake hands and be friends."</p>

<p>"All right," I said heavily. No man can't say I ain't a good
loser. I was cut deep, but I concealed my busted heart.</p>

<p>Leastways I concealed it all I was able to. Them folks which
says I crippled Blink Wiltshaw with malice aforethought is liars
which I'll sweep the road with when I catches 'em. I didn't aim to
break his cussed arm when we shaken hands. It was jest the
convulsive start I give when I suddenly thought of what Glory
McGraw would say when she heard about this mess. And they ain't no
use in folks saying that what imejitly follered was done in revenge
for Dolly busting me in the head with that cuspidor. When I thought
of the rawhiding I'd likely get from Glory McGraw I kind of lost my
head and stampeded like a loco bull. When something got in my way I
removed it without stopping to see what it was. How was I to know
it was Dolly's Uncle Rembrandt which I absent-mindedly throwed
through a winder. And as for them fellers which claims they was
knocked down and trompled on, they ought to of got outa my way,
dern 'em.</p>

<p>As I headed down the trail on Cap'n Kidd I wondered if I ever
really loved Dolly, after all, because I was less upsot over her
marrying another feller than I was about what Glory McGraw would
say.</p>

<h2><a id="gent10" name="gent10">10. THE HAUNTED MOUNTAIN</a>
</h2>

<p style="text-indent:0">THEY say when a critter is mortally
wounded he generally heads for his den, so maybe that's why I
headed for Bear Creek when I rode out of Teton Gulch that night;
I'd had about as much civilization as I could stand for awhile.</p>

<p>But the closer I got to Bear Creek the more I thought about
Glory McGraw and I bust into profuse sweat every time I thought
about what she'd say to me, because I'd sent her word by one of the
Braxton boys that I aimed to bring Dolly Rixby to Bear Creek as Miz
Breckinridge Elkins.</p>

<p>I thought about this so much that when I cut the Chawed Ear road
I turned aside and headed up it. I'd met a feller a few miles back
which told me about a rodeo which was going to take place at Chawed
Ear, so I thought it was a good way to pick up some easy money
whilst avoiding Glory at the same time. But I forgot I had to pass
by the cabin of one of my relatives.</p>

<p>The reason I detests tarantulas, stinging lizards, and
hydrophobia skunks is because they reminds me so much of Aunt
Lavaca Grimes, which my Uncle Jacob Grimes married in a
absent-minded moment, when he was old enough to know better.</p>

<p>That there woman's voice plumb puts my teeth on aidge, and it
has the same effect on Cap'n Kidd, which don't otherwise shy at
nothing less'n a cyclone. So when she stuck her head out of her
cabin as I was riding by and yelled: "Breck-in-ri-i-idge!" Cap'n
Kidd jumped like he was shot, and then tried to buck me off.</p>

<p>"Stop tormentin' that pore animal and come here," commanded Aunt
Lavaca, whilst I was fighting for my life agen Cap'n Kidd's
spine-twisting sunfishing. "Always showin' off! I never see such a
inconsiderate, worthless, no- good&mdash;"</p>

<p>She kept on yapping away till I had wore him down and reined up
alongside the cabin-stoop, and said: "What you want, Aunt
Lavaca?"</p>

<p>She give me a scornful stare, and put her hands onto her hips
and glared at me like I was something she didn't like the smell
of.</p>

<p>"I want you to go git yore Uncle Jacob and bring him home," she
said at last. "He's off on one of his idjiotic prospectin' sprees
again. He snuck out before daylight with the bay mare and a pack
mule&mdash;I wisht I'd woke up and caught him. I'd of fixed him! If
you hustle you can catch him this side of Haunted Mountain Gap. You
bring him back if you have to lasso him and tie him to his saddle.
Old fool! Off huntin' gold when they's work to be did in the
alfalfa fields. Says he ain't no farmer. Huh! I 'low I'll make a
farmer outa him yet. You git goin'."</p>

<p>"But I ain't got time to go chasin' Uncle Jacob all over Haunted
Mountain," I protested. "I'm headin' for the rodeo over to Chawed
Ear. I'm goin' to winme a prize bull-doggin' some
steers&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bull-doggin'!" she snapped. "A fine ockerpashun! Gwan, you
worthless loafer! I ain't goin' to stand here all day argyin' with
a big ninny like you be. Of all the good-for-nothin', triflin',
lunk-headed&mdash;"</p>

<p>When Aunt Lavaca starts in like that you might as well travel.
She can talk steady for three days and nights without repeating
herself, with her voice getting louder and shriller all the time
till it nigh splits a body's ear drums. She was still yelling at me
as I rode up the trail towards Haunted Mountain Gap, and I could
hear her long after I couldn't see her no more.</p>

<p>Pore Uncle Jacob! He never had much luck prospecting, but
trailing around with a jackass is a lot better'n listening to Aunt
Lavaca. A jackass's voice is mild and soothing alongside of
her'n.</p>

<p>Some hours later I was climbing the long rise that led up to the
gap and I realized I had overtook the old coot when something went
<i>ping!</i> up on the slope, and my hat flew off. I quick reined
Cap'n Kidd behind a clump of bresh, and looked up towards the Gap,
and seen a pack-mule's rear end sticking out of a cluster of
boulders.</p>

<p>"You quit that shootin' at me, Uncle Jacob!" I roared.</p>

<p>"You stay whar you be," his voice come back rambunctious and
warlike. "I know Lavacky sent you after me, but I ain't goin' home.
I'm onto somethin' big at last, and I don't aim to be interfered
with."</p>

<p>"What you mean?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"Keep back or I'll ventilate you," he promised. "I'm goin' after
the Lost Haunted Mine."</p>

<p>"You been huntin' that thing for fifty years," I snorted.</p>

<p>"This time I finds it," he says. "I bought a map off'n a drunk
Mexican down to Perdition. One of his ancestors was a Injun which
helped pile up the rocks to hide the mouth of the cave whar it
is."</p>

<p>"Why didn't he go find it and git the gold?" I ast.</p>

<p>"He's scairt of ghosts," said Uncle Jacob. "All Mexes is awful
superstitious. This 'un'd ruther set and drink, anyhow. They's
millions in gold in that there mine. I'll shoot you before I'll go
home. Now will you go on back peacable, or will you throw in with
me? I might need you, in case the pack-mule plays out."</p>

<p>"I'll come with you," I said, impressed. "Maybe you have got
somethin', at that. Put up yore Winchester, I'm comin'."</p>

<p>He emerged from his rocks, a skinny, leathery old cuss, and he
said: "What about Lavacky? If you don't come back with me, she'll
foller us herself, she's that strong-minded."</p>

<p>"You can write, cain't you, Uncle Jacob?" I said, and he said,
"Yeah, I always carries me a pencil-stub in my saddle-bags.
Why?"</p>

<p>"We'll write her a note," I said. "Joe Hopkins always comes down
through the Gap onst a week on his way to Chawed Ear. He's due
through here today. We'll stick the note on a tree, where he'll see
it and take it to her."</p>

<p>So I tore a piece of wrapping paper off'n a can of tomatoes
Uncle Jacob had in his pack, and he got out his pencil stub, and
writ as I told him, as follers:</p>

<p class="letter">"Dere Ant Lavaca: I am takin uncle Jacob way up
in the mountins don't try to foler us it wont do no good gold is
what Im after. Breckinridge."</p>

<p>We folded it and I told Uncle Jacob to write on the outside:</p>

<p class="letter">"Dere Joe: pleeze take this here note to Miz
Lavaca Grimes on the Chawed Ear rode."</p>

<p>It was lucky Joe knowed how to read. I made Uncle Jacob read me
what he had writ to be sure he had got it right. Education is a
good thing in its place, but it never taken the place of common
hoss-sense.</p>

<p>But he had got it right for a wonder, so I stuck the note on a
spruce limb, and me and Uncle Jacob sot out for the higher ranges.
He started telling me all about the Lost Haunted Mine again, like
he'd already did about forty times before. Seems like they was onst
a old prospector which stumbled onto a cave about sixty years
before then, which the walls was solid gold and nuggets all over
the floor till a body couldn't walk, as big as mushmelons. But the
Injuns jumped him and run him out and he got lost and nearly
starved in the desert, and went crazy. When he come to a settlement
and finally got his mind back, he tried to lead a party back to it,
but never could find it. Uncle Jacob said the Injuns had took rocks
and bresh and hid the mouth of the cave so nobody could tell it was
there. I ast him how he knowed the Injuns done that, and he said it
was common knowledge. He said any fool ought a know that's jest
what they done.</p>

<p>"This here mine," says Uncle Jacob, "is located in a hidden
valley which lies away up amongst the high ranges. I ain't never
seen it, and I thought I'd explored these mountains plenty. Ain't
nobody more familiar with 'em than me, except old Joshua Braxton.
But it stands to reason that the cave is awful hard to find, or
somebody'd already found it. Accordin' to this here map, that lost
valley must lie jest beyond Wildcat Canyon. Ain't many white men
know whar that is, even. We're headin' there."</p>

<p>We had left the Gap far behind us, and was moving along the
slanting side of a sharp-angled crag whilst he was talking. As we
passed it we seen two figgers with hosses emerge from the other
side, heading in the same direction we was, so our trails
converged. Uncle Jacob glared and reched for his Winchester.</p>

<p>"Who's that?" he snarled.</p>

<p>"The big 'un's Bill Glanton," I said. "I never seen
t'other'n."</p>

<p>"And nobody else, outside of a freak show," growled Uncle
Jacob.</p>

<p>The other feller was a funny-looking little maverick, with laced
boots and a cork sun-helmet and big spectacles. He sot his hoss
like he thought it was a rocking-chair, and held his reins like he
was trying to fish with 'em. Glanton hailed us. He was from Texas,
original, and was rough in his speech and free with his weppins,
but me and him had always got along together very well.</p>

<p>"Where you-all goin'?" demanded Uncle Jacob.</p>

<p>"I am Professor Van Brock, of New York," said the tenderfoot,
whilst Bill was getting rid of his terbaccer wad. "I have employed
Mr. Glanton, here, to guide me up into the mountains. I am on the
track of a tribe of aborigines, which according to fairly well
substantiated rumor, have inhabited the haunted Mountains since
time immemorial."</p>

<p>"Lissen here, you four-eyed runt," said Uncle Jacob in wrath,
"air you givin' me the hoss-laugh?"</p>

<p>"I assure yon that equine levity is the furthest thing from my
thoughts," says Van Brock. "Whilst touring the country in the
interests of science, I heard the rumors to which I have referred.
In a village possessing the singular appellation of Chawed Ear, I
met an aged prospector who told me that he had seen one of the
aborigines, clad in the skin of a wild animal and armed with a
bludgeon. The wild man, he said, emitted a most peculiar and
piercing cry when sighted, and fled into the recesses of the hills.
I am confident that it is some survivor of a pre-Indian race, and I
am determined to investigate."</p>

<p>"They ain't no sech critter in these hills," snorted Uncle
Jacob. "I've roamed all over 'em for fifty year, and I ain't seen
no wild man."</p>

<p>"Well," says Glanton, "they's <i>somethin'</i> onnatural up
there, because I been hearin' some funny yarns myself. I never
thought I'd be huntin' wild men," he says, "but since that
hash-slinger in Perdition turned me down to elope with a travelin'
salesman, I welcomes the chance to lose myself in the mountains and
forgit the perfidy of women-kind. What you-all doin' up here?
Prospectin'?" he said, glancing at the tools on the mule.</p>

<p>"Not in earnest," said Uncle Jacob hurriedly. "We're jest
whilin' away our time. They ain't no gold in these mountains."</p>

<p>"Folks says that Lost Haunted Mine is up here somewheres," said
Glanton.</p>

<p>"A pack of lies," snorted Uncle Jacob, busting into a sweat.
"Ain't no sech mine. Well, Breckinridge, le's be shovin'. Got to
make Antelope Peak before sundown."</p>

<p>"I thought we was goin' to Wildcat Canyon," I says, and he give
me a awful glare, and said: "Yes, Breckinridge, that's right,
Antelope Peak, jest like you said. So long, gents."</p>

<p>"So long," says Glanton.</p>

<p>So we turned off the trail almost at right angles to our course,
me follering Uncle Jacob bewilderedly. When we was out of sight of
the others, he reined around again.</p>

<p>"When Nature give you the body of a giant, Breckinridge," he
said, "she plumb forgot to give you any brains to go along with
yore muscles. You want everybody to know what we're lookin' for,
and whar?"</p>

<p>"Aw," I said, "them fellers is jest lookin' for wild men."</p>

<p>"Wild men!" he snorted. "They don't have to go no further'n
Chawed Ear on payday night to find more wild men than they could
handle. I ain't swallerin' no sech tripe. Gold is what they're
after, I tell you. I seen Glanton talkin' to that Mex in Perdition
the day I bought that map from him. I believe they either got wind
of that mine, or know I got that map, or both."</p>

<p>"What you goin' to do?" I ast him.</p>

<p>"Head for Wildcat Canyon by another trail," he said.</p>

<p>So we done so and arriv there after night, him not willing to
stop till we got there. It was deep, with big high cliffs cut with
ravines and gulches here and there, and very wild in appearance. We
didn't descend into the canyon that night, but camped on a plateau
above it. Uncle Jacob 'lowed we'd begin exploring next morning. He
said they was lots of caves in the canyon, and he'd been in all of
'em. He said he hadn't never found nothing except b'ars and
painters and rattlesnakes, but he believed one of them caves went
on through into another hidden canyon, and that was where the gold
was at.</p>

<p class="cpb">* * *</p>

<p>Next morning I was awoke by Uncle Jacob shaking me, and his
whiskers was curling with rage.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" I demanded, setting up and pulling my
guns.</p>

<p>"They're here!" he squalled. "Dawgone it, I suspected 'em all
the time! Git up, you big lunk! Don't set there gawpin' with a gun
in each hand like a idjit! They're here, I tell you!"</p>

<p>"Who's here?" I ast.</p>

<p>"That dern tenderfoot and his cussed Texas gunfighter," snarled
Uncle Jacob. "I was up jest at daylight, and purty soon I seen a
wisp of smoke curlin' up from behind a big rock t'other side of the
flat. I snuck over there, and there was Glanton fryin' bacon, and
Van Brock was pertendin' to be lookin' at some flowers with a
magnifyin' glass&mdash;the blame fake. He ain't no perfessor. I bet
he's a derned crook. They're follerin' us. They aim to murder us
and take my map."</p>

<p>"Aw, Glanton wouldn't do that," I said, and Uncle Jacob said:
"You shet up! A man will do anything whar gold's consarned. Dang it
all, git up and do somethin'! Air you goin' to set there, you big
lummox, and let us git murdered in our sleep?"</p>

<p>That's the trouble of being the biggest man in yore clan; the
rest of the family always dumps all the onpleasant jobs onto yore
shoulders. I pulled on my boots and headed acrost the flat with
Uncle Jacob's war-songs ringing in my ears, and I didn't notice
whether he was bringing up the rear with his Winchester or not.</p>

<p>They was a scattering of trees on the flat, and about halfway
acrost a figger emerged from amongst it and headed my direction
with fire in his eye. It was Glanton.</p>

<p>"So, you big mountain grizzly," he greeted me rambunctiously,
"you was goin' to Antelope Peak, hey? Kinda got off the road,
didn't you? Oh, we're on to you, we air!"</p>

<p>"What you mean?" I demanded. He was acting like he was the one
which ought a feel righteously indignant instead of me.</p>

<p>"You know what I mean!" he says, frothing slightly at the mouth.
"I didn't believe it when Van Brock first said he suspicioned you,
even though you <i>hombres</i> did act funny yesterday when he met
you on the trail. But this momin' when I glimpsed yore fool Uncle
Jacob spyin' on our camp, and then seen him sneakin' off through
the bresh, I knowed Van Brock was right. Yo're after what we're
after, and you-all resorts to dirty, onderhanded tactics. Does you
deny yo're after the same thing we air?"</p>

<p>"Naw, I don't," I said. "Uncle Jacob's got more right to it than
you-all has. And when you says we uses onderhanded tricks, yo're a
liar."</p>

<p>"That settles it!" gnashed he. "Go for yore gun!"</p>

<p>"I don't want to perforate you," I growled.</p>

<p>"I ain't hankerin' to conclude yore mortal career," he admitted.
"But Haunted Mountain ain't big enough, for both of us. Take off
yore guns, and I'll maul the livin' daylights out you, big as you
be."</p>

<p>I unbuckled my gun-belt, and hung it on a limb, and he laid off
his'n, and hit me in the stummick and on the ear and in the nose,
and then he busted me in the jaw and knocked out a tooth. This made
me mad, so I taken him by the neck and throwed him agen the ground
so hard it jolted all the wind outa him. I then sot on him and
started banging his head agen a convenient boulder, and his cussing
was terrible to hear.</p>

<p>"If you-all had acted like white men," I gritted, "we'd of
<i>give</i> you a share in that there mine."</p>

<p>"What the hell air you talkin' about?" he gurgled, trying to
haul his bowie out of his boot which I had my knee on.</p>

<p>"The Lost Haunted Mine, what you think?" I snarled, getting a
fresh grip on his ears.</p>

<p>"Hold on!" he protested. "You mean you-all air jest lookin' for
gold? Is that on the level?"</p>

<p>I was so astonished I quit hammering his skull agen the
rock.</p>

<p>"Why, what else?" I demanded. "Ain't you-all follerin' us to
steal Uncle jacob's map which shows where at the mine is hid?"</p>

<p>"Git offa me!" he snorted disgustfully, taking advantage of my
surprise to push me off. "Hell!" says he, starting to knock the
dust offa his britches. "I might of knowed that tenderfoot was
wool-gatherin'. After we seen you-all yesterday, and he heard you
mention Wildcat Canyon, he told me he believed you was follerin'
us. He said that yarn about prospectin' was jest a blind. He said
he believed you was workin' for a rival scientific society to git
ahead of us and capture that there wild man yoreselves."</p>

<p>"What?" I said. "You mean that wild man yarn is straight
goods?"</p>

<p>"Far as we're consarned," said Bill. "Prospectors is been
tellin' some onusual stories about Wildcat Canyon. Well, I laughed
at him at first, but he kept on usin' so many .45 calibre words
that he got me to believin' it might be so. 'Cause, after all, here
was me guidin' a tenderfoot on the trail of a wild man, and they
warn't no reason to think that you and Jacob Grimes was any more
sensible than me.</p>

<p>"Then, this mornin' when I seen Jacob peekin' at me from the
bresh, I decided Van Brock must be right. You-all hadn't never went
to Antelope Peak. The more I thought it over, the more sartain I
was that you was follerin' us to steal our wild man, so I started
over to have a show-down."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "we've reched a understandin'. You don't want
our mine, and we sure don't want yore wild man. They's plenty of
them amongst my relatives on Bear Creek. Le's git Van Brock and lug
him over to our camp and explain things to him and my weak-minded
uncle."</p>

<p>"All right," said Glanton, buckling on his guns. "Hey, what's
that?"</p>

<p>From down in the canyon come a yell: "Help! Aid!
Assistance!"</p>

<p>"It's Van Brock!" yelped Glanton. "He's wandered down into the
canyon by hisself! Come on!"</p>

<p>Right nigh their camp they was a ravine leading down to the
floor of the canyon. We pelted down that at full speed and emerged
nigh the wall of the cliffs. They was the black mouth of a cave
showing nearby, in a kind of cleft, and jest outside this cleft Van
Brock was staggering around, yowling like a hound-dawg with his
tail caught in the door.</p>

<p>His cork helmet was laying on the ground all bashed outa shape,
and his specs was lying nigh it. He had a knot on his head as big
as a turnip and he was doing a kind of ghost-dance or something all
over the place.</p>

<p>He couldn't see very good without his specs, 'cause when he
sighted us he give a shriek and started legging it up the canyon,
seeming to think we was more enemies. Not wanting to indulge in no
sprinting in that heat, Bill shot a heel offa his boot, and that
brung him down squalling blue murder.</p>

<p>"Help!" he shrieked. "Mr. Glanton! Help! I am being attacked!
Help!"</p>

<p>"Aw, shet up," snorted Bill. "I'm Glanton. Yo're all right. Give
him his specs, Breck. Now, what's the matter?"</p>

<p>He put 'em on, gasping for breath, and staggered up, wild-eyed,
and p'inted at the cave, and hollered: "The wild man! I saw him, as
I descended into the canyon on a private exploring expedition! A
giant with a panther's skin about his waist, and a club in his
hand. When I sought to apprehend him he dealt me a murderous blow
with the bludgeon and fled into that cavern. He should be
arrested!"</p>

<p>I looked into the cave. It was too dark to see anything except
for a hoot-owl.</p>

<p>"He must of saw <i>somethin'</i>, Breck," said Glanton, hitching
his gun-harness. "<i>Somethin'</i> shore cracked him on the conk.
I've been hearin' some queer tales about this canyon, myself. Maybe
I better sling some lead in there&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, no!" broke in Van Brock. "We must capture him
alive!"</p>

<p>"What's goin' on here?" said a voice, and we turned to see Uncle
Jacob approaching with his Winchester in his hands.</p>

<p>"Everything's all right, Uncle Jacob," I said. "They don't want
yore mine. They're after the wild man, like they said, and we got
him cornered in that there cave."</p>

<p>"All right, huh?" he snorted. "I reckon you thinks it's all
right for you to waste yore time with sech dern foolishness when
you oughta be helpin' me look for my mine. A big help you be!"</p>

<p>"Where was you whilst I was argyin' with Bill here?" I
demanded.</p>

<p>"I knowed you could handle the situation, so I started explorin'
the canyon," he said. "Come on, we got work to do."</p>

<p>"But the wild man!" cried Van Brock. "Your nephew would be
invaluable in securing the specimen. Think of science! Think of
progress! Think of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Think of a striped skunk!" snorted Uncle Jacob. "Breckinridge,
air you comin'?"</p>

<p>"Aw, shet up," I said disgustedly. "You both make me tired. I'm
goin' in there and run that wild man out, and Bill, you shoot him
in the hind-laig as he comes out, so's we can catch him and tie him
up."</p>

<p>"But you left yore guns hangin' onto that limb up on the
plateau," objected Glanton.</p>

<p>"I don't need 'em," I said. "Didn't you hear Van Brock say we
was to catch him alive? If I started shootin' in the dark I might
rooin him."</p>

<p>"All right," says Bill, cocking his six-shooters. "Go ahead. I
figger yo're a match for any wild man that ever come down the
pike."</p>

<p>So I went into the cleft and entered the cave and it was dark as
all get-out. I groped my way along and discovered the main tunnel
split in two, so I taken the biggest one. It seemed to get darker
the further I went, and purty soon I bumped into something big and
hairy and it went "Wump!" and grabbed me.</p>

<p>Thinks I, it's the wild man, and he's on the war-path. So I
waded into him and he waded into me, and we tumbled around on the
rocky floor in the dark, biting and mauling and tearing. Bear Creek
is famed far and wide for its ring- tailed scrappers, and I don't
have to repeat I'm the fightin'est of 'em all, but that cussed wild
man sure give me my hands full. He was the biggest, hairiest
critter I ever laid hands on, and he had more teeth and talons than
I thought a human could possibly have. He chawed me with vigor and
enthusiasm, and he walzed up and down my frame free and hearty, and
swept the floor with me till I was groggy.</p>

<p>For a while I thought I was going to give up the ghost, and I
thought with despair of how humiliated my relatives on Bear Creek
would be to hear their champeen battler had been clawed to death by
a wild man in a cave.</p>

<p>This thought maddened me so I redoubled my onslaughts, and the
socks I give him ought to of laid out any man, wild or tame, to say
nothing of the pile- driver kicks in his belly, and butting him
with my head so he gasped. I got what felt like a ear in my mouth
and commenced chawing on it, and presently, what with this and
other mayhem I committed on him, he give a most inhuman squall and
bust away and went lickety-split for the outside world.</p>

<p>I riz up and staggered after him, hearing a wild chorus of yells
break forth, but no shots. I bust out into the open, bloody all
over, and my clothes hanging in tatters.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" I hollered. "Did you let him git away?"</p>

<p>"Who?" said Glanton, coming out from behind a boulder, whilst
Van Brock and Uncle Jacob dropped down out of a tree nearby.</p>

<p>"The wild man, damn it!" I roared.</p>

<p>"We ain't seen no wild man," said Glanton.</p>

<p>"Well, what was that thing I jest run outa the cave?" I
hollered.</p>

<p>"That was a grizzly b'ar," said Glanton.</p>

<p>"Yeah," sneered Uncle Jacob, "and that was Van Brock's 'wild
man'! And now, Breckinridge, if yo're through playin',
we'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no!" hollered Van Brock, jumping up and down. "It was
indubitably a human being which smote me and fled into the cavern.
Not a bear! It is still in there somewhere, unless there is another
exit to the cavern."</p>

<p>"Well, he ain't in there now," said Uncle Jacob, peering into
the mouth of the cave. "Not even a wild man would run into a
grizzly's cave, or if he did, he wouldn't stay
long&mdash;<i>ooomp!</i>"</p>

<p>A rock come whizzing out of the cave and hit Uncle Jacob in the
belly, and he doubled up on the ground.</p>

<p>"Aha!" I roared, knocking up Glanton's ready six-shooter. "I
know! They's two tunnels in there. He's in that smaller cave. I
went into the wrong one! Stay here, you-all, and gimme room! This
time I gits him!"</p>

<p>With that I rushed into the cave mouth again, disregarding some
more rocks which emerged, and plunged into the smaller opening. It
was dark as pitch, but I seemed to be running along a narrer
tunnel, and ahead of me I heard bare feet pattering on the rock. I
follered 'em at full lope, and presently seen a faint hint of
light. The next minute I rounded a turn and come out into a wide
place, which was lit by a shaft of light coming in through a cleft
in the wall, some yards up. In the light I seen a fantastic figger
climbing up on a ledge, trying to rech that cleft.</p>

<p>"Come down offa that!" I thundered, and give a leap and grabbed
the ledge by one hand and hung on, and reched for his laigs with
t'other hand. He give a squall as I grabbed his ankle and
splintered his club over my head. The force of the lick broke off
the lip of the rock ledge I was holding onto, and we crashed to the
floor together, because I didn't let loose of him. Fortunately, I
hit the rock floor headfirst which broke my fall and kept me from
fracturing any of my important limbs, and his head hit my jaw,
which rendered him unconscious.</p>

<p>I riz up and picked up my limp captive and carried him out into
the daylight where the others was waiting. I dumped him on the
ground and they stared at him like they couldn't believe it. He was
a ga'nt old cuss with whiskers about a foot long and matted hair,
and he had a mountain lion's hide tied around his waist.</p>

<p>"A white man!" enthused Van Brock, dancing up and down. "An
unmistakable Caucasian! This is stupendous! A pre-historic survivor
of a pre-Indian epoch! What an aid to anthropology! A wild man! A
veritable wild man!"</p>

<p>"Wild man, hell!" snorted Uncle Jacob. "That there's old Joshua
Braxton, which was trying to marry that old maid schoolteacher down
at Chawed Ear all last winter."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> was tryin' to marry her!" said Joshua bitterly,
setting up suddenly and glaring at all of us. "That there is good,
that there is! And me all the time fightin' for my life agen it.
Her and all her relations was tryin' to marry <i>her</i> to me.
They made my life a curse. They was finally all set to kidnap me
and marry me by force. That's why I come away off up here, and put
on this rig to scare folks away. All I crave is peace and quiet and
no dern women."</p>

<p>Van Brock begun to cry because they warn't no wild man, and
Uncle Jacob said: "Well, now that this dern foolishness is settled,
maybe I can git to somethin' important. Joshua, you know these
mountains even better'n I do. I want ya to help me find the Lost
Haunted Mine."</p>

<p>"There ain't no sech mine," said Joshua. "That old prospector
imagined all that stuff whilst he was wanderin' around over the
desert crazy."</p>

<p>"But I got a map I bought from a Mexican in Perdition!" hollered
Uncle Jacob.</p>

<p>"Lemme see that map," said Glanton. "Why, hell," he said, "that
there is a fake. I seen that Mexican drawin' it, and he said he was
goin' to try to sell it to some old jassack for the price of a
drunk."</p>

<p>Uncle Jacob sot down on a rock and pulled his whiskers. "My
dreams is bust. I'm goin' to go home to my wife," he said
weakly.</p>

<p>"You must be desperate if it's come to that," said old Joshua
acidly. "You better stay up here. If they ain't no gold, they ain't
no women to torment a body, neither."</p>

<p>"Women is a snare and a delusion," agreed Glanton. "Van Brock
can go back with these fellers. I'm stayin' with Joshua."</p>

<p>"You all oughta be ashamed talkin' about women that way," I
reproached 'em. "I've suffered from the fickleness of certain women
more'n either of you snake-hunters, but I ain't let it sour me on
the sex. What," I says, waxing oratorical, "in this lousy and
troubled world of six-shooters and centipedes, what, I asts
you-all, can compare to women's gentle sweetness&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There the scoundrel is!" screeched a familiar voice like a
rusty buzzsaw. "Don't let him git away! Shoot him if he tries to
run!"</p>

<p>We turned sudden. We'd been argying so loud amongst ourselves we
hadn't noticed a gang of folks coming down the ravine. There was
Aunt Lavaca and the sheriff of Chawed Ear with ten men, and they
all p'inted sawed-off shotguns at me.</p>

<p>"Don't git rough, Elkins," warned the sheriff nervously.
"They're loaded with buckshot and ten-penny nails. I knows yore
repertation and I takes no chances. I arrests you for the
kidnappin' of Jacob Grimes."</p>

<p>"Air you plumb crazy?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"Kidnappin'!" hollered Aunt Lavaca, waving a piece of paper.
"Abductin' yore pore old uncle! Aimin' to hold him for ransom! It's
all writ down over yore name right here on this here paper! Sayin'
yo're takin' Jacob away off into the mountains&mdash;warnin' me not
to try to foller! Same as threatenin' me! I never heered of sech
doin's! Soon as that good-for-nothin' Joe Hopkins brung me that
there imperdent letter, I went right after the sheriff... Joshua
Braxton, what <i>air</i> you doin' in them ondecent togs? My land,
I dunno what we're a-comin' to! Well, sheriff, what you standin'
there for like a ninny? Why'n't you put some handcuffs and chains
and shackles onto him? Air you scairt of the big lunkhead?"</p>

<p>"Aw, heck," I said. "This is all a mistake. I warn't threatenin'
nobody in that there letter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then where's Jacob?" she demanded. "Perjuice him imejitly,
or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He ducked into the cave," said Glanton.</p>

<p>I stuck my head in and roared: "Uncle Jacob! You come outa there
and explain before I come in after you!"</p>

<p>He snuck out looking meek and down-trodden, and I says: "You
tell these idjits that I ain't no kidnapper."</p>

<p>"That's right," he said. "I brung him along with me."</p>

<p>"Hell!" said the sheriff disgustedly. "Have we come all this way
on a wild goose chase? I should of knew better'n to lissen to a
woman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You shet yore fool mouth!" squalled Aunt Lavaca. "A fine
sheriff you be. Anyway&mdash;what was Breckinridge doin' up here
with you, Jacob?"</p>

<p>"He was helpin' me look for a mine, Lavacky," he said.</p>

<p>"<i>Helpin'</i> you?" she screeched. "Why, I sent him to fetch
you back! Breckinridge Elkins, I'll tell yore pap about this, you
big, lazy, good-for-nothin', low-down, ornery&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aw, SHET UP!" I roared, exasperated beyond endurance. I seldom
lets my voice go its full blast. Echoes rolled through the canyon
like thunder, the trees shook and pine cones fell like hail, and
rocks tumbled down the mountain sides. Aunt Lavaca staggered
backwards with a outraged squall.</p>

<p>"Jacob!" she hollered. "Air you goin' to 'low that ruffian to
use that there tone of voice to me? I demands that you flail the
livin' daylights outa the scoundrel right now!"</p>

<p>"Now, now, Lavacky," he started soothing her, and she give him a
clip under the ear that changed ends with him, and the sheriff and
his posse and Van Brock took out up the ravine like the devil was
after 'em.</p>

<p>Glanton bit hisself off a chaw of terbaccer and says to me, he
says: "Well, what was you fixin' to say about women's gentle
sweetness?"</p>

<p>"Nothin'," I snarled. "Come on, let's git goin'. I yearns to
find a more quiet and secluded spot than this here'n. I'm stayin'
with Joshua and you and the grizzly."</p>

<br>

<h2><a id="gent11" name="gent11">11. EDUCATE OR BUST</a>
</h2>

<p style="text-indent:0">ME and Bill Glanton and Joshua Braxton
stood on the canyon rim and listened to the orations of Aunt Lavaca
Grimes fading in the distance as she herded Uncle Jacob for the
home range.</p>

<p>"There," says Joshua sourly, "goes the most hen-pecked pore
critter in the Humbolts. For sech I has only pity and contempt.
He's that scairt of a woman he don't dast call his soul his
own."</p>

<p>"And what air we, I'd like to know?" says Glanton, slamming his
hat down on the ground. "What right has we to criticize Jacob, when
it's on account of women that we're hidin' in these cussed
mountains? Yo're here, Joshua, because yo're scairt of that old
maid schoolteacher. Breck's here because a gal in War Paint give
him the gate. And I'm here sourin' my life because a hash-slinger
done me wrong!"</p>

<p>"I'm tellin' you gents," says Bill, "no woman is goin' to rooin
my life! Lookin' at Jacob Grimes has teached me a lesson. I ain't
goin' to eat my heart out up here in the mountains in the company
of a soured old hermit and a love- lorn human grizzly. I'm goin' to
War Paint, and bust the bank at the Yaller Dawg's Tail gamblin'
hall, and then I'm goin' to head for San Francisco and a
high-heeled old time! The bright lights calls me, gents, and I
heeds the summons! You-all better take heart and return to yore
respective corrals."</p>

<p>"Not me," I says. "If I go back to Bear Creek without no gal,
Glory McGraw will rawhide the life outa me."</p>

<p>"As for me returnin' to Chawed Ear," snarls old Joshua, "whilst
that old she-mudhen is anywhere in the vicinity, I haunts the wilds
and solitudes, if it takes all the rest of my life. You 'tend to
yore own business, Bill Glanton."</p>

<p>"Oh, I forgot to tell you," says Bill. "So dern many things is
been happenin' I ain't had time to tell you. But that old maid
schoolteacher ain't to Chawed Ear no more. She pulled out for
Arizona three weeks ago."</p>

<p>"That's news!" says Joshua, straightening up and throwing away
his busted club. "Now I can return and take my place among
men&mdash;Hold on!" says he, reching for his club again. "Likely
they'll be gittin' some other old harridan to take her place! That
new-fangled schoolhouse they got at Chawed Ear is a curse and a
blight. We'll never be rid of female school-shooters. I better stay
up here, after all."</p>

<p>"Don't worry," says Bill. "I seen a pitcher of the gal that's
comin' to take Miss Stark's place, and I can assure you right now,
that a gal as young and purty as her wouldn't never try to sot her
brand on no old buzzard like you."</p>

<p>I come alive suddenly.</p>

<p>"Young and purty, you says?" I says.</p>

<p>"As a pitcher," he says. "First time I ever knowed a
schoolteacher could be less'n forty and have a face that didn't
look like the beginnin's of a long drought. She's due into Chawed
Ear tomorrer, on the stage from the East, and the whole town's
goin' to turn out to welcome her. The mayor aims to make a speech,
if he's sober enough, and they've got together a band to play."</p>

<p>"Damn foolishness!" snorted Joshua. "I don't take no stock in
eddication."</p>

<p>"I dunno," I said. "They's times when I wish I could read and
write."</p>

<p>"What would you read outside of the labels on whisky bottles?"
snorted old Joshua.</p>

<p>"Everybody ought to know how," I said defiantly. "We ain't never
had no school on Bear Creek."</p>

<p>"Funny how a purty face changes a man's views," says Bill. "I
remember onst Miss Stark ast you how you folks up on Bear Creek
would like for her to come up there and teach yore chillern, and
you taken one look at her face, and told her that it was agen the
principles of Bear Creek to have their peaceful innercence invaded
by the corruptin' influences of education, and the folks was all
banded together to resist sech corruption."</p>

<p>I ignored him and says: "It's my duty to Bear Creek to pervide
culture for the risin' generation. We ain't never had a school, but
by golly, we're goin' to, if I have to lick every old moss-back in
the Humbolts. I'll build the cabin for the schoolhouse myself."</p>

<p>"And where'll you git a teacher?" ast old Joshua. "This gal
that's comin' to teach at Chawed Ear is the only one in the county.
Chawed Ear ain't goin' to let you have her."</p>

<p>"Chawed Ear is, too," I says. "If they won't give her up
peaceful, I resorts to vi'lence. Bear Creek is goin' to have
education and culture, if I have to wade ankle-deep in gore to
pervide it. Come on, le's go! I'm r'arin' to start the ball for
arts and letters. Air you all with me?"</p>

<p>"Till hell freezes!" acclaimed Bill. "My shattered nerves needs
a little excitement, and I can always count on you to pervide sech.
How about it, Joshua?"</p>

<p>"Yo're both crazy," growls old Joshua. "But I've lived up here
eatin' nuts and wearin' a painter-hide till I ain't shore of my own
sanity. Anyway, I know the only way to disagree successfully with
Elkins is to kill him, and I got strong doubts of bein' able to do
that, even if I wanted to. Lead on! I'll do anything in reason to
keep eddication out of Chawed Ear. 'Tain't only my own feelin's in
regard to schoolteachers. It's the principle of the thing."</p>

<p>"Git yore clothes then," I said, "and le's hustle."</p>

<p>"This painter hide is all I got," he said.</p>

<p>"You cain't go down into the settlements in that garb," I
says.</p>

<p>"I can and will," says he. "I look about as civilized as you do,
with yore clothes all tore to rags account of that b'ar. I got a
hoss down in that canyon. I'll git him."</p>

<p>So Joshua got his hoss, and Glanton got his'n, and I got Cap'n
Kidd, and then the trouble started. Cap'n Kidd evidently thought
Joshua was some kind of a varmint, because every time Joshua come
near him he taken in after him and run him up a tree. And every
time Joshua tried to come down, Cap'n Kidd busted loose from me and
run him back up again.</p>

<p>I didn't get no help from Bill; all he done was laugh like a
spotted hyener, till Cap'n Kidd got irritated at them guffaws and
kicked him in the belly and knocked him clean through a clump of
spruces. Time I got him ontangled he looked about as disreputable
as what I did, because his clothes was tore most off of him. We
couldn't find his hat, neither, so I tore up what was left of my
shirt and he tied the pieces around his head like a Apache. We was
sure a wild-looking bunch.</p>

<p>But I was so disgusted thinking about how much time we was
wasting while all the time Bear Creek was wallering in ignorance,
so the next time Cap'n Kidd went for Joshua I took and busted him
betwixt the ears with my six-shooter, and that had some effect on
him.</p>

<p>So we sot out, with Joshua on a ga'nt old nag he rode bare-back
with a hackamore, and a club he toted not having no gun. I had Bill
to ride betwixt him and me, so's to keep that painter hide as far
from Cap'n Kidd as possible, but every time the wind shifted and
blowed the smell to him, Cap'n Kidd reched over and taken a bite at
Joshua, and sometimes he bit Bill's hoss instead, and sometimes he
bit Bill, and the langwidge Bill directed at that pore dumb animal
was shocking to hear.</p>

<p>But between rounds, as you might say, we progressed down the
trail, and early the next morning we come out onto the Chawed Ear
Road, some miles west of Chawed Ear. And there we met our first
human&mdash;a feller on a pinto mare, and when he seen us he give a
awful squall and took out down the road towards Chawed Ear like the
devil had him by the seat of the britches.</p>

<p>"Le's catch him and find out if the teacher's got there yet!" I
hollered, and we taken out after him, yelling for him to wait a
minute, but he spurred his hoss that much harder, and before we'd
gone any piece, hardly, Joshua's fool hoss jostled agen Cap'n Kidd,
which smelt that painter skin and got his bit betwixt his teeth and
run Joshua and his hoss three miles through the bresh before I
could stop him. Glanton follered us, and of, course, time we got
back to the road, the feller on the pinto mare was out of sight
long ago.</p>

<p>"So we headed for Chawed Ear, but everybody that lived along the
road had run into their cabins and bolted the doors, and they shot
at us through their winders as we rode by. Glanton said irritably,
after having his off-ear nicked by a buffalo rifle, he says: 'Dern
it, they must know we aim to steal their schoolteacher.'"</p>

<p>"Aw, they couldn't know that," I said. "I bet they is a war on
between Chawed Ear and War Paint."</p>

<p>"Well, what they shootin' at <i>me</i> for, then?" demanded old
Joshua. "I don't hang out at War Paint, like you fellers. I'm a
Chawed Ear man myself."</p>

<p>"I doubt if they rekernizes you with all them whiskers and that
rig you got on," I said. "Anyway&mdash;what's that?"</p>

<p>Ahead of us, away down the road, we seen a cloud of dust, and
here come a gang of men on hosses, waving their guns and
yelling.</p>

<p>"Well, whatever the reason is," says Glanton, "we better not
stop to find out! Them gents is out for blood!"</p>

<p>"Pull into the bresh," says I. "I'm goin' to Chawed Ear today in
spite of hell, high water, and all the gunmen they can raise!"</p>

<p>So we taken to the bresh, leaving a trail a blind man could of
follered, but we couldn't help it, and they lit into the bresh
after us, about forty or fifty of 'em, but we dodged and circled
and taken short cuts old Joshua knowed about, and when we emerged
into the town of Chawed Ear, our pursuers warn't nowheres in sight.
They warn't nobody in sight in the town, neither. All the doors was
closed and the shutters up on the cabins and saloons and stores and
everything. It was pecooliar.</p>

<p>As we rode into the clearing somebody let <i>bam</i> at us with
a shotgun from the nearest cabin, and the load combed old Joshua's
whiskers. This made me mad, and I rode at the cabin and pulled my
foot out'n the stirrup and kicked the door in, and while I was
doing this, the feller inside hollered and jumped out the winder,
and Glanton grabbed him by the neck and taken his gun away from
him. It was Esau Barlow, one of Chawed Ear's confirmed
citizens.</p>

<p>"What the hell does you Chawed Ear buzzards mean by this here
hostility?" roared Bill.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Glanton?" gasped Barlow, blinking his eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's me!" bellered Bill wrathfully. "Do I look like a
Injun?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;<i>ow!</i> I mean, I didn't know you in that there
turban," says Barlow. "Am I dreamin', or is that Joshua Braxton and
Breckinridge Elkins?"</p>

<p>"Shore it's us!" snorted Joshua. "Who you think?"</p>

<p>"Well," says Esau, rubbing his neck, "I didn't know!" He stole a
glance at Joshua's painter-hide and he batted his eyes again, and
kind of shaken his head like he warn't sure of hisself, even
then.</p>

<p>"Where is everybody?" Joshua demanded.</p>

<p>"Well," says Esau, "a little while ago Dick Lynch rode into town
with his hoss all of a lather, and swore he'd jest out-run the
wildest war-party that ever come down from the hills!</p>

<p>"'Boys,' says Dick, 'they ain't neither Injuns nor white men!
They're them cussed wild men that New York perfessor was talkin'
about! One of 'em's big as a grizzly b'ar, with no shirt on, and
he's ridin' a hoss bigger'n a bull moose. One of the others is as
ragged and ugly as him, but not so big, and wearin' a Apache
head-dress. T'other'n's got nothin' on but a painter's hide, and a
club, and his hair and whiskers falls to his shoulders! When they
seen me,' says Dick, 'they sot up the awfullest yells I ever heard
and come for me like so many wild Injuns. I fogged it for town,'
says Dick, 'warnin' everybody along the road to fort theirselves in
their cabins.'"</p>

<p>"Well," says Esau, "when he says that, sech men as was left in
town got their hosses and guns&mdash;except me which cain't ride
account of a risin' I got in a vital spot&mdash;and they taken out
up the road to meet the war-party before it got into town."</p>

<p>"Well, of all the cussed fools!" I snorted. "Lissen, where-at's
the new schoolteacher?"</p>

<p>"She ain't arriv yet," says he. "She's due on the next stage,
and the mayor and the band rode out to meet her at the Yaller Creek
crossin' and escort her into town in honor. They pulled out before
Dick Lynch brung news of the war- party."</p>

<p>"Well, come on!" I says to my warriors. "I aims to meet that
stage too!"</p>

<p>So we pulled out and fogged it down the road, and purty soon we
heard music blaring ahead of us, and men yipping and shooting off
their pistols like they does when they're celebrating, so we jedged
the stage had already arriv.</p>

<p>"What you goin' to do now?" ast Glanton, and about that time a
noise bust out behind us, and I looked back and seen that gang of
Chawed Ear maniacs which had been chasing us dusting down the road
after us, waving their Winchesters. I seen it warn't no use to try
to stop and argy with 'em. They'd fill us full of lead before we
could get clost enough to make 'em hear what we was saying. So I
hollered: "Come on! If they git her into town they'll fort
theirselves agen us, and we'll never git her! We'll have to take
her by force! Foller me!"</p>

<p>So we swept down the road and around the bend, and there was the
stagecoach coming up the road with the mayor riding alongside with
his hat in his hand, and a whisky bottle sticking out of each
saddle-bag and his hip pocket. He was orating at the top of his
voice to make hisself heard above the racket the band was making.
They was blowing horns of every kind, and banging drums, and
twanging on Jews harps, and the hosses was skittish and shying and
jumping. But we heard the mayor say: "&mdash;And so we welcomes
you, Miss Devon, to our peaceful little community, where life runs
smooth and tranquil, and men's souls is overflowing with milk and
honey&mdash;" And jest then we stormed around the the bend and come
tearing down on 'em with the mob right behind us yelling and
cussing and shooting free and fervent.</p>

<p>The next minute they was the damndest mix-up you ever seen, what
with the hosses bucking their riders off, and men yelling and
cussing, and the hosses hitched to the stage running away and
knocking the mayor off his hoss. We hit 'em like a cyclone and they
shot at us and hit us over the head with their derned music horns,
and right in the middle of the fray the mob behind us rounded the
bend and piled up amongst us before they could check theirselves,
and everybody was so confused they started fighting everybody else.
Old Joshua was laying right and left with his club, and Glanton was
beating the band over their heads with his six-shooter, and I was
trompling everybody in my rush for the stage.</p>

<p>Because the fool hosses had whirled around and started in the
general direction of the Atlantic Ocean, and neither the driver nor
the shotgun guard could stop 'em. But Cap'n Kidd overtook it in
maybe a dozen strides, and I left the saddle in a flying leap and
landed on it. The guard tried to shoot me with his shotgun so I
throwed it into a alder clump and he didn't let go of it quick
enough so he went along with it.</p>

<p>I then grabbed the reins out of the driver's hands and swung
them fool hosses around, and the stage kind of revolved on one
wheel for a dizzy instant and then settled down again and we headed
back up the road lickety-split and in a instant was right amongst
the melee that was going on around Bill and Joshua.</p>

<p>About that time I realized that the driver was trying to stab me
with a butcher knife, so I kind of tossed him off the stage, and
there ain't no sense in him going around saying he's going to have
me arrested account of him landing headfirst in the bass horn so it
take seven men to pull his head out of it. He ought to watch where
he falls, when he gets throwed off a stage going at a high run.</p>

<p>I feels, moreover, that the mayor is prone to carry petty
grudges, or he wouldn't be belly-aching about me accidentally
running over him with all four wheels. And it ain't my fault he was
stepped on by Cap'n Kidd, neither. Cap'n Kidd was jest follering
the stage, because he knowed I was on it. And it naturally
irritates any well-trained hoss to stumble over somebody, and
that's why Cap'n Kidd chawed the mayor's ear.</p>

<p>As for them fellers which happened to get knocked down and run
over by the stage, I didn't have nothing personal agen 'em. I was
jest rescuing Joshua and Bill which I seen was outnumbered about
twenty to one. I was doing them idjits a favor, if they only knowed
it, because in about another minute Bill would of started using the
front ends of his six-shooters instead of the butts, and the fight
would of turnt into a massacre. Glanton has got a awful temper.</p>

<p>Him and Joshua had laid out a remarkable number of the enemy,
but the battle was going agen 'em when I arriv on the field of
carnage. As the stage crashed through the mob I reched down and got
Joshua by the neck and pulled him out from under about fifteen men
which was beating him to death with their gun butts and pulling out
his whiskers, and I slung him up on top of the other luggage. About
that time we was rushing past the melee which Bill was the center
of, and I reched down and snared him as we went by, but three of
the men which had hold of him wouldn't let go, so I hauled all four
of 'em up into the stage. I then handled the team with one hand
whilst with the other'n I pulled them idjits loose from Bill like
pulling ticks off a cow's hide, and throwed 'em at the mob which
was chasing us.</p>

<p>Men and hosses piled up in a stack on the road which was further
complicated by Cap'n Kidd's actions as he come busting along after
the stage, and by the time we sighted Chawed Ear again, our enemies
was far behind us down the road.</p>

<p>We busted right through Chawed Ear in a fog of dust, and the
women and chillern which had ventured out of their cabins, squalled
and run back in again, though they warn't in no danger at all. But
Chawed Ear folks is pecooliar that way.</p>

<p>When we was out of sight of Chawed Ear on the road to War Paint
I give the lines to Bill and swung down on the side of the stage
and stuck my head in.</p>

<p>They was one of the purtiest gals I ever seen in there, all
huddled up in a corner as pale as she could be, and looking so
scairt I thought she was going to faint, which I'd heard Eastern
gals had a habit of doing.</p>

<p>"Oh, spare me!" she begged, clasping her hands in front of her.
"Please don't scalp me! I cannot speak your language, but if you
can understand English, please have mercy on me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be at ease, Miss Devon," I reassured her. "I ain't no Injun,
nor wild man neither. I'm a white man, and so is my friends here.
We wouldn't none of us hurt a flea. We're that refined and
tender-hearted you wouldn't believe it&mdash;" About that time a
wheel hit a stump and the stage jumped into the air and I bit my
tongue, and roared in some irritation: "Bill, you &mdash;&mdash;
son of a &mdash;&mdash; polecat! Stop them hosses before I comes up
there and breaks yore &mdash;&mdash; neck!"</p>

<p>"Try it and see what you git, you beefheaded lummox!" he
retorted, but he pulled the hosses to a stop, and I taken off my
hat and opened the stage door. Bill and Joshua clumb down and
peered over my shoulder.</p>

<p>"Miss Devon," I says, "I begs yore pardon for this here informal
welcome. But you sees before you a man whose heart bleeds for the
benighted state of his native community. I'm Breckinridge Elkins
from Bear Creek, where hearts is pure and motives is noble, but
education is weak.</p>

<p>"You sees before you," I says, "a man which has growed up in
ignorance. I cain't neither read nor write my own name. Joshua
here, in the painter-skin, he cain't neither, and neither can
Bill&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's a lie," says Bill. "I can read and&mdash;<i>oomp!</i>"
Because I'd kind of stuck my elbow in his stummick. I didn't want
Bill Glanton to spile the effeck of my speech.</p>

<p>"They is some excuse for men like us," I says. "When we was
cubs, schools was unknown in these mountains, and keepin' a
sculpin' knife from betwixt yore skull and yore hair was more
important than makin' marks onto a slate.</p>

<p>"But times has changed. I sees the young 'uns of my home range
growin' up in the same ignorance as me," I said, "and my heart
bleeds for 'em. They is no sech excuse for them as they was for me.
The Injuns has went, mostly, and a age of culture is due to be
ushered in.</p>

<p>"Miss Devon," I says, "will you please come up to Bear Creek and
be our schoolteacher?"</p>

<p>"Why," says she, bewilderedly, "I came West expecting to teach
school at a place called Chawed Ear, but I haven't signed any
contract&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How much was them snake-hunters goin' to pay you?" I ast.</p>

<p>"Ninety dollars a month," says she.</p>

<p>"We pays you a hundred on Bear Creek," I says. "Board and
lodgin' free."</p>

<p>"But what will the people of Chawed Ear say?" she said.</p>

<p>"Nothin'!" I says heartily. "I done arranged that. They got the
interests of Bear Creek so much at heart, that they wouldn't think
of interferin' with any arrangements I make. You couldn't drag 'em
up to Bear Creek with a team of oxen!"</p>

<p>"It seems all very strange and irregular," says she, "but I
suppose&mdash;"</p>

<p>So I says: "Good! Fine! Great! Then it's all settled. Le's
go!"</p>

<p>"Where?" she ast, grabbing hold of the stage as I clumb into the
seat.</p>

<p>"To War Paint, first," I says, "where I gits me some new clothes
and a good gentle hoss for you to ride&mdash;because nothin' on
wheels can git over the Bear Creek road&mdash;and then we heads for
home! Git up, hosses! Culture is on her way to the Humbolts!"</p>

<p class="cpb">* * *</p>

<p>Well, a few days later me and the schoolteacher was riding
sedately up the trail to Bear Creek, with a pack-mule carrying her
plunder, and you never seen nothing so elegant&mdash;store-bought
clothes and a hat with a feather into it, and slippers and
everything. She rode in a side-saddle I bought for her&mdash;the
first that ever come into the Humbolts. She was sure purty. My
heart beat in wild enthusiasm for education ever time I looked at
her.</p>

<p>I swung off the main trail so's to pass by the spring in the
creek where Glory McGraw filled her pail every morning and evening.
It was jest about time for her to be there, and sure enough she
was. She straightened when she heard the hosses, and started to say
something, and then her eyes got wide as she seen my elegant
companion, and her purty red mouth stayed open. I pulled up my hoss
and taken off my hat with a perlite sweep I learnt from a gambler
in War Paint, and I says: "Miss Devon, lemme interjuice you to Miss
Glory McGraw, the datter of one of Bear Creek's leadin' citizens.
Miss McGraw, this here is Miss Margaret Devon, from Boston,
Massachusetts, which is goin' to teach school here."</p>

<p>"How do you do?" says Miss Margaret, but Glory didn't say
nothing. She jest stood there, staring, and the pail fell outa her
hand and splashed into the creek.</p>

<p>"Allow me to pick up yore pail," I said, and started to lean
down from my saddle to get it, but she started like she was stung,
and said, in a voice which sounded kind of strained and onnatural:
"Don't tech it! Don't tech nothin' I own! Git away from me!"</p>

<p>"What a beautiful girl!" says Miss Margaret as we rode on. "But
how peculiarly she acted!"</p>

<p>But I said nothing, because I was telling myself, well, I reckon
I showed Glory McGraw something this time. I reckon she sees now
that I warn't lying when I said I'd bring a peach back to Bear
Creek with me. But somehow I warn't enjoying my triumph nigh as
much as I'd thought I would.</p>

<h2><a id="gent12" name="gent12">12. WAR ON BEAR CREEK</a>
</h2>

<p style="text-indent:0">PAP dug the nineteenth buckshot out of my
shoulder and said: "Pigs is more disturbin' to the peace of a
community than scandal, divorce, and corn- licker put together.
And," says pap, pausing to strop his bowie on my sculp where the
hair was all burnt off, "when the pig is a razorback hawg, and is
mixed up with a lady schoolteacher, a English tenderfoot, and a
passle of blood- thirsty relatives, the result is appallin' for a
peaceable man to behold. Hold still till Buckner gits yore ear
sewed back on."</p>

<p>Pap was right. I warn't to blame for nothing that happened.
Breaking Joe Gordon's laig was a mistake, and Erath Elkins is a
liar when he says I caved in them five ribs of his'n on purpose. If
Uncle Jeppard Grimes had been tending to his own business, he
wouldn't have got the seat of his britches filled with bird-shot,
and I don't figger it was my fault that cousin Bill Kirby's cabin
got burned down. And I don't take no blame for Jim Gordon's ear
which Jack Grimes shot off, neither. I figger everybody was more to
blame than I was, and I stand ready to wipe up the road with
anybody which disagrees with me.</p>

<p>But I'm getting ahead of myself. Lemme go back to the days when
culture first reared its head amongst the simple inhabitants of
Bear Creek.</p>

<p>Jest like I said, I was determined that education should be
committed on the rising generation, and I gathered the folks in a
clearing too far away for Miss Devon to be stampeded by the noise
of argyment and persuasion, and I sot forth my views. Opinions
differed vi'lently like they always does on Bear Creek, but when
the dust settled and the smoke drifted away, it was found that a
substantial majority of folks agreed to see things my way. Some was
awful sot agen it, and said no good would come of book larning, but
after I had swept the clearing with six or seven of them, they
allowed it might be a good thing after all, and agreed to let Miss
Margaret take a whack at uplifting the young 'uns.</p>

<p>Then they ast me how much money I'd promised her, and when I
said a hundred a month they sot up a howl that they wasn't that
much hard money seen on Bear Creek in a year's time. But I settled
that. I said each family would contribute whatever they was
able&mdash;coonskins, honey, b'ar hides, corn-licker, or what not,
and I'd pack the load into War Paint each month and turn it into
cash money. I added that I'd be more'n glad to call around each
month to make sure nobody failed to contribute.</p>

<p>Then we argyed over where to build the cabin for the
schoolhouse, and I wanted to build it between pap's cabin and the
corral, but he riz up and said he'd be dadgasted he'd have a
schoolhouse anywhere nigh his dwelling-house, with a passle of
yelling kids scaring off all the eatable varmints. He said if it
was built within a mile of his cabin it would be because they was
somebody on Bear Creek which had a quicker trigger finger and a
better shooting eye than what he did. So after some argyment in the
course of which five of Bear Creek's leading citizens was knocked
stiff, we decided to build the schoolhouse over nigh the settlement
on Apache Mountain. That was the thickest populated spot on Bear
Creek anyway. And Cousin Bill Kirby agreed to board her for his
part of contributing to her wages.</p>

<p>Well, it would of suited me better to had the schoolhouse built
closer to my home-cabin, and have Miss Margaret board with us, but
I was purty well satisfied, because this way I could see her any
time I wanted to. I done this every day, and she looked purtier
every time I seen her. The weeks went by, and everything was going
fine. I was calling on Miss Margaret every day, and she was
learning me how to read and write, though it was a mighty slow
process. But I was progressing a little in my education, and a
whole lot&mdash;I thought&mdash;in my love affair, when peace and
romance hit a snag in the shape of a razorback pig named Daniel
Webster.</p>

<p>It begun when that there tenderfoot come riding up the trail
from War Paint with Tunk Willoughby. Tunk ain't got no more sense
than the law allows, but he sure showed good jedgment that time,
because having delivered his charge to his destination, he didn't
tarry. He merely handed me a note, and p'inted dumbly at the
tenderfoot, whilst holding his hat reverently in his hand
meanwhile.</p>

<p>"What you mean by that there gesture?" I ast him rather
irritably, and he said: "I doffs my sombrero in respect to the
departed. Bringin' a specimen like that onto Bear Creek is jest
like heavin' a jackrabbit to a pack of starvin' loboes."</p>

<p>He hove a sigh and shook his head, and put his hat back on.
"Rassle a cat in pieces," he said.</p>

<p>"What the hell air you talkin' about?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"That's Latin," he said. "It means rest in peace."</p>

<p>And with that he dusted it down the trail and left me alone with
the tenderfoot which all the time was setting his cayuse and
looking at me like I was a curiosity or something.</p>

<p>I called for my sister Ouachita to come read that there note for
me, because she'd learnt how from Miss Margaret, so she did, and it
run as follers:</p>

<p class="letter">"Dere Breckinridge: This will interjuice Mr. J.
Pembroke Pemberton a English sportsman which I met in Frisco
recent. He was disapinted because he hadnt found no adventures in
America and was fixin to go to Aferker to shoot liuns and elerfants
but I perswaded him to come with me because I knowed he would find
more hell on Bear Creek in a week than he would find in a yere in
Aferker or any other place. But the very day we hit War Paint I run
into a old ackwaintance from Texas I will not speak no harm of the
ded but I wish the son of a buzzard had shot me somewheres besides
in my left laig which already had three slugs in it which I never
could get cut out. Anyway I am lade up and not able to come on to
Bear Creek with J. Pembroke Pemberton. I am dependin' on you to
show him some good bear huntin' and other excitement and pertect
him from yore relatives I know what a awful responsibility I am
puttin on you but I am askin this as yore friend, William Harrison
Glanton, Esqy."</p>

<p>I looked J. Pembroke over. He was a medium-sized young feller
and looked kinda soft in spots. He had yaller hair and very pink
cheeks like a gal; and he had on whip-cord britches and tan riding
boots which was the first I ever seen. And he had on a funny kinda
coat with pockets and a belt which he called a shooting jacket, and
a big hat like a mushroom made outa cork with a red ribbon around
it. And he had a pack-hoss loaded with all kinds of plunder, and
five or six different kinds of shotguns and rifles.</p>

<p>"So yo're J. Pembroke," I says, and he says: "Oh, rahther! And
you, no doubt, are the person Mr. Glanton described to me as
Breckinridge Elkins?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," I said. "Light and come in. We got b'ar meat and honey
for supper."</p>

<p>"I say," he says, climbing down. "Pardon me for being a bit
personal, old chap, but may I ask if your&mdash;ah&mdash;magnitude
of bodily stature is not a bit unique?"</p>

<p>"I dunno," I says, not having the slightest idee what he was
talking about. "I always votes a straight Democratic ticket,
myself."</p>

<p>He started to say something else, but jest then pap and my
brothers John and Bill and Jim and Buckner and Garfield come to the
door to see what the noise was about, and he turned pale and said
faintly: "I beg your pardon; giants seem to be the rule in these
parts."</p>

<p>"Pap says men ain't what they was when he was in his prime," I
said, "but we manage to git by."</p>

<p>Well, J. Pembroke laid into them b'ar steaks with a hearty will,
and when I told him we'd go after b'ar next day, he ast me how many
days travel it'd take till we got to the b'ar country.</p>

<p>"Heck!" I says. "You don't have to travel to git b'ar in these
parts. If you forgit to bolt yore door at night yo're liable to
find a grizzly sharin' yore bunk before mornin'. This here'n we're
eatin' was catched by my sister Elinor there whilst tryin' to rob
the pig-pen out behind the cabin last night."</p>

<p>"My word!" he says, looking at her pecooliarly. "And may I ask,
Miss Elkins, what calibre of firearm you used?"</p>

<p>"I knocked him in the head with a wagon spoke," she said, and he
shook his head to hisself and muttered: "Extraordinary!"</p>

<p>J. Pembroke slept in my bunk and I taken the floor that night;
and we was up at daylight and ready to start after the b'ar. Whilst
J. Pembroke was fussing over his guns, pap come out and pulled his
whiskers and shook his head and said: "That there is a perlite
young man, but I'm afeared he ain't as hale as he ought a be. I
jest give him a pull at my jug, and he didn't gulp but one good
snort and like to choked to death."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, buckling the cinches on Cap'n Kidd, "I've done
learnt not to jedge outsiders by the way they takes their licker on
Bear Creek. It takes a Bear Creek man to swig Bear Creek corn
juice."</p>

<p>"I hopes for the best," sighed pap. "But it's a dismal sight to
see a young man which cain't stand up to his licker. Whar you
takin' him?"</p>

<p>"Over towards Apache Mountain," I said. "Erath seen a exter big
grizzly over there day before yesterday."</p>

<p>"Hmmmmm!" says pap. "By a pecooliar coincidence the schoolhouse
is over on the side of Apache Mountain, ain't it,
Breckinridge?"</p>

<p>"Maybe it is and maybe it ain't," I replied with dignerty, and
rode off with J. Pembroke ignoring pap's sourcastic comment which
he hollered after me: "Maybe they is a connection betwixt
book-larnin' and b'ar-huntin', but who am I to say?"</p>

<p>J. Pembroke was a purty good rider, but he used a funny-looking
saddle without no horn nor cantle, and he had the derndest gun I
ever seen. It was a double-barrel rifle, and he said it was a
elerfant-gun. It was big enough to knock a hill down. He was
surprised I didn't tote no rifle and ast me what would I do if we
met a b'ar. I told him I was depending on him to shoot it, but I
said if it was necessary for me to go into action, my six-shooters
was plenty.</p>

<p>"My word!" says he. "You mean to say you can bring down a
grizzly with a shot from a pistol?"</p>

<p>"Not always," I said. "Sometimes I have to bust him over the
head with the barrel to finish him."</p>

<p>He didn't say nothing for a long time after that.</p>

<p>Well, we rode over on the lower slopes of Apache Mountain, and
tied the hosses in a holler and went through the bresh on foot.
That was a good place for b'ars, because they come there very
frequently looking for Uncle Jeppard Grimes' pigs which runs loose
all over the lower slopes of the mountain.</p>

<p>But jest like it always is when yo're looking for something
special, we didn't see a cussed b'ar.</p>

<p>The middle of the evening found us around on the side of the
mountain where they is a settlement of Kirbys and Grimeses and
Gordons. Half a dozen families has their cabins within a mile or so
of each other, and I dunno what in hell they want to crowd up
together that way for, it would plumb smother me, but pap says they
was always pecooliar that way.</p>

<p>We warn't in sight of the settlement, but the schoolhouse warn't
far off, and I said to J. Pembroke: "You wait here a spell, and
maybe a b'ar will come by. Miss Margaret Devon is teachin' me how
to read and write, and it's time for my lesson."</p>

<p>I left J. Pembroke setting on a log hugging his elerfant-gun,
and I strode through the bresh and come out at the upper end of the
run which the settlement was at the other'n, and school had jest
turned out and the chillern was going home, and Miss Margaret was
waiting for me in the log schoolhouse.</p>

<p>She was setting at her hand-made desk as I come in, ducking my
head so as not to bump it agen the top of the door and perlitely
taking off my Stetson. She looked kinda tired and discouraged, and
I said: "Has the young'uns been raisin' any hell today, Miss
Margaret?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she said. "They're very polite&mdash;in fact I've
noticed that Bear Creek people are always polite when they're not
killing each other. I've finally gotten used to the boys wearing
their pistols and bowie knives to school. But somehow it seems so
futile. This is all so terribly different from everything to which
I've always been accustomed. I get discouraged and feel like giving
it up."</p>

<p>"You'll git used to it," I consoled her. "It'll be a lot
different onst yo're married to some honest reliable young
man."</p>

<p>She give me a startled look and said: "Married to someone here
on Bear Creek?"</p>

<p>"Shore," I said, involuntarily expanding my chest. "Everybody is
jest wonderin' when you'll set the day. But le's git at my readin'
lesson. I done learnt the words you writ out for me yesterday."</p>

<p>But she warn't listenin', and she said: "Do you have any idea of
why Mr. Joel Grimes and Mr. Esau Gordon quit calling on me? Until a
few days ago one or the other was at Mr. Kirby's cabin where I
board almost every night."</p>

<p>"Now don't you worry none about them," I soothed her. "Joel'll
be about on crutches before the week's out, and Esau can already
walk without bein' helped. I always handles my relatives as easy as
possible."</p>

<p>"You fought with them?" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I jest convinced 'em you didn't want to be bothered with 'em,"
I reassured her. "I'm easy-goin', but I don't like
competition."</p>

<p>"Competition!" Her eyes flared wide open and she looked at me
like she hadn't never seen me before. "Do you mean that
you&mdash;that I&mdash;that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well," I said modestly, "everybody on Bear Creek is jest
wonderin' when yo're goin' to set the day for us to git hitched.
You see gals don't generally stay single very long in these
parts&mdash;hey, what's the matter?"</p>

<p>Because she was getting paler and paler like she'd et something
which didn't agree with her.</p>

<p>"Nothing," she said faintly. "You&mdash;you mean people are
expecting me to marry you?"</p>

<p>"Sure," I said.</p>

<p>She muttered something that sounded like "My God!" and licked
her lips with her tongue and looked at me like she was about ready
to faint. Well, it ain't every gal which has a chance to get
hitched to Breckinridge Elkins, so I didn't blame her for being
excited.</p>

<p>"You've been very kind to me, Breckinridge," she said feebly.
"But I&mdash;this is so sudden&mdash;so unexpected&mdash;I never
thought&mdash;I never <i>dreamed</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't want to rush you," I said. "Take yore time. Next week
will be soon enough. Anyway, I got to build us a cabin,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>Bang!</i> went a gun, too loud for a Winchester.</p>

<p>"Elkins!" It was J. Pembroke yelling for me up the slope.
"Elkins! Hurry!"</p>

<p>"Who's that?" she exclaimed, jumping to her feet like she was
working on a spring.</p>

<p>"Aw," I said in disgust, "it's a fool tenderfoot Bill Glanton
wished on me. I reckon a b'ar is got him by the neck. I'll go
see."</p>

<p>"I'll go with you!" she said, but from the way J. Pembroke was
yelling I figgered I better not waste no time getting to him, so I
couldn't wait for her, and she was some piece behind me when I
mounted the lap of the slope and met him running out from amongst
the trees. He was gibbering with excitement.</p>

<p>"I winged it!" he squawked. "I'm sure I winged the blighter! But
it ran in among the underbrush and I dared not follow it, for the
beast is most vicious when wounded. A friend of mine once wounded
one in South Africa, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A b'ar?" I ast.</p>

<p>"No, no!" he said. "A wild boar! The most vicious brute I have
ever seen! It ran into that brush there!"</p>

<p>"Aw, they ain't no wild boars in the Humbolts," I snorted. "You
wait here, I'll go see jest what you did shoot."</p>

<p>I seen some splashes of blood on the grass, so I knowed he'd
shot <i>something.</i> Well, I hadn't gone more'n a few hundred
feet and was jest out of sight of J. Pembroke when I run into Uncle
Jeppard Grimes.</p>

<p>Uncle Jeppard was one of the first white men to come into the
Humbolts, in case I ain't mentioned that before, and he wears
fringed buckskins and moccasins jest like he done fifty years ago.
He had a bowie knife in one hand and he waved something in the
other'n like a flag of revolt, and he was frothing at the
mouth.</p>

<p>"The derned murderer!" he shrieked. "You see this? That's the
proper tail of Dan'l Webster, the finest derned razorback boar
which ever trod the Humbolts! That danged tenderfoot of yore'n
tried to 'sassernate him! Shot his tail off, right spang up to the
hilt! I'll show him he cain't muterlate my animals like this! I'll
have his heart's blood!"</p>

<p>And he done a war-dance waving that pig-tail and his bowie and
cussing in American and Spanish and Apache Injun all at onst.</p>

<p>"You ca'm down, Uncle Jeppard," I said sternly. "He ain't got no
sense, and he thought Daniel Webster was a wild boar like they have
in Aferker and England and them foreign places. He didn't mean no
harm."</p>

<p>"No harm," said Uncle Jeppard fiercely. "And Dan'l Webster with
no more tail onto him than a jackrabbit!"</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "here's a five dollar gold piece to pay for the
dern hawg's tail, and you let J. Pembroke alone!"</p>

<p>"Gold cain't satisfy honor," he said bitterly, but nevertheless
grabbing the coin like a starving Kiowa grabbing a beefsteak. "I'll
let this here outrage pass for the time. But I'll be watchin' that
maneyack to see that he don't muterlate no more of my prize
livestock."</p>

<p>And so saying he went off muttering in his beard.</p>

<p>I went back to where I left J. Pembroke, and there he was
talking to Miss Margaret which had jest come up. She had more color
in her face than I'd saw recent.</p>

<p>"Fancy meeting a girl like you here!" J. Pembroke was
saying.</p>

<p>"No more surprising than meeting a man like you!" says she with
a kind of fluttery laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh, a sportsman wanders into all sorts of out-of-the-way
places," says he, and seeing they hadn't noticed me coming up, I
says: "Well, J. Pembroke, I didn't find yore wild boar, but I met
the owner."</p>

<p>He looked at me kinda blank, and said vaguely: "Wild boar?
<i>What</i> wild boar?"</p>

<p>"That 'un you shot the tail off of with that there fool elerfant
gun," I said. "Lissen: next time you see a hawg-critter you
remember there ain't no wild boars in the Humbolts. They is
critters called haverleeners in South Texas, but they ain't even
none of them in Nevada. So next time you see a hawg, jest reflect
that it's merely one of Uncle Jeppard Grimes' razorbacks and
refrain from shootin' at it."</p>

<p>"Oh, quite!" he agreed absently, and started talking to Miss
Margaret again.</p>

<p>So I picked up the elerfant gun which he'd absent-mindedly laid
down, and said: "Well, it's gittin' late. Let's go. We won't go
back to pap's cabin tonight, J. Pembroke. We'll stay at Uncle Saul
Garfield's cabin on t'other side of the Apache Mountain
settlement."</p>

<p>Like I said, them cabins was awful clost together. Uncle Saul's
cabin was below the settlement, but it warnt much over three
hundred yards from cousin Bill Kirby's cabin where Miss Margaret
boarded. The other cabins was on t'other side of Bill's, mostly,
strung out up the run and up and down the slopes.</p>

<p>I told J. Pembroke and Miss Margaret to walk on down to the
settlement whilst I went back and got the hosses.</p>

<p>They'd got to the settlement time I catched up with 'em, and
Miss Margaret had gone into the Kirby cabin, and I seen a light
spring up in her room. She had one, of them new-fangled ile lamps
she brung with her, the only one on Bear Creek. Taller candles and
pine chunks was good enough for us folks. And she'd hanged
rag-things over the winders which she called curtains. You never
seen nothing like it. I tell you she was that elegant you wouldn't
believe it.</p>

<p>We walked on towards Uncle Saul's, me leading the hosses, and
after awhile J. Pembroke says: "A wonderful creature!"</p>

<p>"You mean Dan'l Webster?" I ast.</p>

<p>"No!" he said. "No, no! I mean Miss Devon."</p>

<p>"She sure is," I said. "She'll make me a fine wife."</p>

<p>He whirled like I'd stabbed him and his face looked pale in the
dusk.</p>

<p>"You?" he said. "<i>You</i> a fine wife?"</p>

<p>"Well," I said bashfully, "she ain't sot the day yet, but I've
sure sot my heart on that gal."</p>

<p>"Oh!" he says. <i>"Oh!"</i> says he, like he had the toothache.
Then he said kinda hesitatingly: "Suppose&mdash;er, just suppose,
you know! Suppose a rival for her affections should appear? What
would you do?"</p>

<p>"You mean if some dirty, low-down son of a mangy skunk was to
try to steal my gal?" I said, whirling so sudden he staggered
backwards.</p>

<p><i>"Steal my gal?"</i> I roared, seeing red at the mere thought.
"Why, I'd&mdash;I'd&mdash;"</p>

<p>Words failing me I grabbed a big sapling and tore it up by the
roots and broke it acrost my knee and throwed the pieces clean
through a rail fence on the other side of the road.</p>

<p>"That there is a faint idee!" I said, panting with passion.</p>

<p>"That gives me a very vivid conception," he said faintly, and he
said nothing more till we reched the cabin and seen Uncle Saul
Garfield standing in the light of the door combing his black beard
with his fingers.</p>

<p class="cpb">* * *</p>

<p>Next morning J. Pembroke seemed like he'd kinda lost interest in
b'ars. He said all that walking he done over the slopes of Apache
Mountain had made his laig muscles sore. I never heard of sech a
thing, but nothing that gets the matter with these tenderfeet
surprises me much, they is sech a effemernate race, so I ast him
would he like to go fishing down the run and he said all right.</p>

<p>But we hadn't been fishing more'n a hour when he said he
believed he'd go back to Uncle Saul's cabin and take him a nap, and
he insisted on going alone, so I stayed where I was and catched me
a nice string of trout.</p>

<p>I went back to the cabin about noon, and ast Uncle Saul if J.
Pembroke had got his nap out.</p>

<p>"Why, heck," said Uncle Saul, "I ain't seen him since you and
him started down the run this mornin'. Wait a minute&mdash;yonder
he comes from the other direction."</p>

<p>Well, J. Pembroke didn't say where he'd been all morning, and I
didn't ast him, because a tenderfoot don't generally have no reason
for anything he does.</p>

<p>We et the trout I catched, and after dinner he perked up a right
smart and got his shotgun and said he'd like to hunt some wild
turkeys. I never heard of anybody hunting anything as big as a
turkey with a shotgun, but I didn't say nothing, because tenderfeet
is like that.</p>

<p>So we headed up the slopes of Apache Mountain, and I stopped by
the schoolhouse to tell Miss Margaret I probably wouldn't get back
in time to take my reading and writing lesson, and she said: "You
know, until I met your friend, Mr. Pembroke, I didn't realize what
a difference there was between men like him, and&mdash;well, like
the men on Bear Creek."</p>

<p>"I know," I said. "But don't hold it agen him. He means well. He
jest ain't got no sense. Everybody cain't be smart like me. As a
special favor to me, Miss Margaret, I'd like for you to be exter
nice to the poor sap, because he's a friend of my friend Bill
Glanton down to War Paint."</p>

<p>"I will, Breckinridge," she replied heartily, and I thanked her
and went away with my big manly heart pounding in my gigantic
bosom.</p>

<p>Me and J. Pembroke headed into the heavy timber, and we hadn't
went far till I was convinced that somebody was follering us. I
kept hearing twigs snapping, and onst I thought I seen a shadowy
figger duck behind a bush. But when I run back there, it was gone,
and no track to show in the pine needles. That sort of thing would
of made me nervous, anywheres else, because they is a goodly number
of people which would like to get a clean shot at my back from the
bresh, but I knowed none of them dast come after me in my own
territory. If anybody was trailing us it was bound to be one of my
relatives and to save my neck I couldn't think of no reason why
anyone of 'em would be gunning for me.</p>

<p>But I got tired of it, and left J. Pembroke in a small glade
whilst I snuck back to do some shaddering of my own. I aimed to
cast a big circle around the clearing and see could I find out who
it was, but I'd hardly got out of sight of J. Pembroke when I heard
a gun bang.</p>

<p>I turned to run back and here come J. Pembroke yelling: "I got
him! I got him! I winged the bally aborigine!"</p>

<p>He had his head down as he busted through the bresh and he run
into me in his excitement and hit me in the belly with his head so
hard he bounced back like a rubber ball and landed in a bush with
his riding boots brandishing wildly in the air.</p>

<p>"Assist me, Breckinridge!" he shrieked. "Extricate me! They will
be hot on our trail!"</p>

<p>"Who?" I demanded, hauling him out by the hind laig and setting
him on his feet.</p>

<p>"The Indians!" he hollered, jumping up and down and waving his
smoking shotgun frantically. "The bally redskins! I shot one of
them! I saw him sneaking through the bushes! I saw his legs! I knew
it was an Indian instantly because he had on moccasins instead of
boots! Listen! That's him now!"</p>

<p>"A Injun couldn't cuss like that," I said. "You've shot Uncle
Jeppard Grimes!"</p>

<p>Telling him to stay there, I run through the bresh, guided by
the maddened howls which riz horribly on the air, and busting
through some bushes I seen Uncle Jeppard rolling on the ground with
both hands clasped to the rear bosom of his buckskin britches which
was smoking freely. His langwidge was awful to hear.</p>

<p>"Air you in misery Uncle Jeppard?" I inquired solicitously. This
evoked another ear-splitting squall.</p>

<p>"I'm writhin' in my death-throes," he says in horrible accents,
"and you stands there and mocks my mortal agony! My own blood-kin!"
he says "&mdash;&mdash;!" says Uncle Jeppard with passion.</p>

<p>"Aw," I said, "that there bird-shot wouldn't hurt a flea. It
cain't be very deep under yore thick old hide. Lie on yore belly,
Uncle Jeppard," I says, stropping my bowie on my boot, "and I'll
dig out them shot for you."</p>

<p>"Don't tech me!" he said fiercely, painfully climbing onto his
feet. "Where's my rifle-gun? Gimme it! Now then, I demands that you
bring that British murderer here where I can git a clean lam at
him! The Grimes honor is besmirched and my new britches is rooint.
Nothin' but blood can wipe out the stain on the family honor!"</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "you didn't have no business sneakin' around
after us thataway&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here Uncle Jeppard give tongue to loud and painful shrieks.</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I?" he howled. "Ain't a man got no right to
perteck his own property? I war follerin' him to see that he didn't
shoot no more tails offa my hawgs. And now he shoots me in the same
place! He's a fiend in human form&mdash;a monster which stalks
ravelin' through these hills bustin' for the blood of the
innercent!"</p>

<p>"Aw, J. Pembroke thought you was a Injun," I said.</p>

<p>"He thought Dan'l Webster was a wild wart-hawg," gibbered Uncle
Jeppard. "He thought I was Geronimo. I reckon he'll massacre the
entire population of Bear Creek under a misapprehension, and you'll
uphold and defend him! When the cabins of yore kinfolks is
smoulderin' ashes, smothered in the blood of yore own relations, I
hope you'll be satisfied&mdash;bringin' a foreign assassin into a
peaceful community!"</p>

<p>Here Uncle Jeppard's emotions choked him, and he chawed his
whiskers and then yanked out the five-dollar gold piece I give him
for Daniel Webster's tail, and throwed it at me.</p>

<p>"Take back yore filthy lucre," he said bitterly. "The day of
retribution is nigh onto hand, Breckinridge Elkins, and the Lord of
battles shall jedge betwixt them which turns agen their kinsfolks
in their extremerties!"</p>

<p>"In their which?" I ast, but he merely snarled and went limping
off through the trees, calling back over his shoulder: "They is
still men on Bear Creek which will see jestice did for the aged and
helpless. I'll git that English murderer if it's the last thing I
do, and you'll be sorry you stood up for him, you big
lunkhead!"</p>

<p>I went back to where J. Pembroke was waiting bewilderedly, and
evidently still expecting a tribe of Injuns to bust out of the
bresh and sculp him, and I said in disgust: "Let's go home.
Tomorrer I'll take you so far away from Bear Creek you can shoot in
any direction without hittin' a prize razorback or a antiquated
gunman with a ingrown disposition. When Uncle Jeppard Grimes gits
mad enough to throw away money, it's time to ile the Winchesters
and strap yore scabbard-ends to yore laigs."</p>

<p>"Legs?" he said mistily. "But what about the Indians?"</p>

<p>"They warn't no Injun, gol-dern it!" I howled. "They ain't been
none on Bear Creek for four or five year. They&mdash;aw, hell! What
the hell! Come on. It's gittin' late. Next time you see somethin'
you don't understand, ast me before you shoot it. And remember, the
more ferocious and woolly it looks, the more likely it is to be a
leadin' citizen of Bear Creek."</p>

<p>It was dark when we approached Uncle Saul's cabin, and J.
Pembroke glanced back up the road, towards the settlement, and
said: "My word, is it a political rally? Look! A torchlight
parade!"</p>

<p>I looked, and said: "Quick! Git into the cabin and stay
there!"</p>

<p>He turned pale, but said: "If there is danger, I insist
on&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Insist all you dern please," I said, "but git in that house and
stay there. I'll handle this. Uncle Saul, see he gits in
there."</p>

<p>Uncle Saul is a man of few words. He taken a firm grip onto his
pipe stem and he grabbed J. Pembroke by the neck and the seat of
the britches and throwed him bodily into the cabin, and shet the
door and sot down on the stoop.</p>

<p>"They ain't no use in you gittin' mixed up in this, Uncle Saul,"
I said.</p>

<p>"You got yore faults, Breckinridge," he grunted. "You ain't got
much sense, but yo're my favorite sister's son&mdash;and I ain't
forgot that lame mule Jeppard traded me for a sound animal back in
'69. Let 'em come!"</p>

<p>They come all right, and surged up in front of the
cabin&mdash;Jeppard's boys Jack and Buck and Esau and Joash and
Polk County. And Erath Elkins, and a mob of Gordons and Buckners
and Polks, all more or less kin to me, except Joel Braxton who
wasn't kin to none of us, but didn't like me because he was sweet
on Miss Margaret. But Uncle Jeppard warn't with 'em. Some had
torches and Polk County Grimes had a rope with a noose in it.</p>

<p>"Where at air you-all goin' with that there lariat?" I ast them
sternly, planting my enormous bulk in their path.</p>

<p>"Perjuice the scoundrel!" commanded Polk County, waving his rope
around his head. "Bring out the foreign invader which shoots hawgs
and defenceless old men from the bresh!"</p>

<p>"What you aim to do?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"We aim to hang him!" they replied with hearty enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Uncle Saul knocked the ashes out of his pipe and stood up and
stretched his arms which looked like knotted oak limbs, and he
grinned in his black beard like a old timber wolf, and he says:
"Whar is dear cousin Jeppard to speak for hisself?"</p>

<p>"Uncle Jeppard was havin' the shot picked outa his hide when we
left," says Jim Gordon. "He'll be along directly. Breckinridge, we
don't want no trouble with you, but we aims to have that
Englishman."</p>

<p>"Well," I snorted, "you-all cain't. Bill Glanton is trustin' me
to return him whole of body and limb, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What you want to waste time in argyment for, Breckinridge?"
Uncle Saul reproved mildly. "Don't you know it's a plumb waste of
time to try to reason with the off-spring of a lame-mule
trader?"</p>

<p>"What would you sejest, old man?" sneeringly remarked Polk
County.</p>

<p>Uncle Saul beamed on him benevolently, and said gently: "I'd try
moral suasion&mdash;like this!" And he hit Polk County under the
jaw and knocked him clean acrost the yard into a rain barrel
amongst the rooins of which he reposed till he was rescued and
revived some hours later.</p>

<p>But they was no stopping Uncle Saul onst he took the war-path.
No sooner had he disposed of Polk County than he jumped seven foot
in the air, cracked his heels together three times, give the rebel
yell and come down with his arms around the necks of Esau Grimes
and Joel Braxton, and started mopping up the cabin yard with
'em.</p>

<p>That started the fight, and they is no scrap in the world where
mayhem is committed as free and fervent as in one of these here
family rukuses.</p>

<p>Polk County had hardly crashed into the rain-barrel when Jack
Grimes stuck a pistol in my face. I slapped it aside jest as he
fired and the bullet missed me and taken a ear offa Jim Gordon. I
was scairt Jack would hurt somebody if he kept on shooting reckless
that way, so I kinda rapped him with my left fist and how was I to
know it would dislocate his jaw? But Jim Gordon seemed to think I
was to blame about his ear, because he give a maddened howl and
jerked up his shotgun and let <i>bam</i> with both barrels. I
ducked jest in time to keep from getting my head blowed off, and
catched most of the double charge in my shoulder, whilst the rest
hived in the seat of Steve Kirby's britches. Being shot that way by
a relative was irritating, but I controlled my temper and merely
taken the gun away from Jim and splintered the stock over his
head.</p>

<p>In the meantime Joel Gordon and Buck Grimes had grabbed one of
my laigs apiece and was trying to rassle me to the earth, and Joash
Grimes was trying to hold down my right arm, and cousin Pecos
Buckner was beating me over the head from behind with a axe-handle,
and Erath Elkins was coming at me from the front with a bowie
knife. I reched down and got Buck Grimes by the neck with my left
hand, and I swung my right and hit Erath with it, but I had to lift
Joash clean off his feet and swing him around with the lick,
because he wouldn't let go, so I only knocked Erath through the
rail fence which was around Uncle Saul's garden.</p>

<p>About this time I found my left laig was free and discovered
that Buck Grimes was unconscious, so I let go of his neck and begun
to kick around with my left laig, and it ain't my fault if the spur
got tangled up in Uncle Jonathan Polk's whiskers and jerked most of
'em out by the roots. I shaken Joash off and taken the axe-handle
away from Pecos because I seen he was going to hurt somebody if he
kept on swinging it around so reckless, and I dunno why he blames
me because his skull got fractured when he hit that tree. He ought
a look where he falls when he gets throwed acrost a cabin yard. And
if Joel Gordon hadn't been so stubborn trying to gouge me he
wouldn't of got his laig broke neither.</p>

<p>I was handicapped by not wanting to kill any of my kinfolks, but
they was so mad they all wanted to kill me, so in spite of my
carefulness the casualties was increasing at a rate which would of
discouraged anybody but Bear Creek folks. But they are the
stubbornest people in the world. Three or four had got me around
the laigs again, refusing to be convinced that I couldn't be
throwed that way, and Erath Elkins, having pulled hisself out of
the rooins of the fence, come charging back with his bowie.</p>

<p>By this time I seen I'd have to use vi'lence in spite of myself,
so I grabbed Erath Elkins and squoze him with a grizzly-hug and
that was when he got them five ribs caved in, and he ain't spoke to
me since. I never seen sech a cuss for taking offence over
trifles.</p>

<p>For a matter of fact, if he hadn't been wrought up, he'd of
realized how kindly and kindredly I felt towards him, even in the
heat of battle. If I had dropped him underfoot he might of got
fatally tromped on, for I was kicking folks right and left. So I
carefully throwed Erath out of range of the melee, and he's a liar
when he says I aimed him at Ozark Grimes' pitchfork; I didn't even
see the cussed implement.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that somebody swung at me with a axe and
ripped a ear offa my head, and I begun to lose my temper. Four or
five other relatives was kicking and hitting and biting me all at
onst, and they is a limit even to my timid manners and mild nature.
I voiced my displeasure with a beller of wrath that shook the
leaves offa the trees, and lashed out with both fists, and my
misguided relatives fell all over the yard like persimmons after a
frost. I grabbed Joash Grimes by the ankles and begun to knock them
ill-advised idjits in the head with him, and the way he hollered
you'd of thought somebody was man- handling him. The yard was
beginning to look like a battlefield when the cabin door opened and
a deluge of b'iling water descended on us.</p>

<p>I got about a gallon down my neck, but paid very little
attention to it, however the others ceased hostilities and started
rolling on the ground and hollering and cussing, and Uncle Saul riz
up from amongst the rooins of Esau Grimes and Joel Braxton, and
bellered: "Woman! Whar air you at?"</p>

<p>Aunt Zavalla Garfield was standing in the doorway with a kettle
in her hand, and she said: "Will you idjits stop fightin'? The
Englishman's gone. He run out the back door when the fightin'
started, and saddled his nag and pulled out. Now will you born
fools stop, or will I give you another surge? Land save us! What's
that light?"</p>

<p>Somebody was yelling off towards the settlement, and I was aware
of a pecooliar glow which didn't come from sech torches as was
still burning. And here come Medina Kirby, one of Bill's gals,
yelping like a Comanche.</p>

<p>"Our cabin's burnin'!" she squalled. "A stray bullet went
through the winder and busted Miss Margaret's ile lamp!"</p>

<p>With a yell of dismay I abandoned the fray and headed for Bill's
cabin, follered by everybody which was able to foller me. They had
been several wild shots fired during the melee and one of 'em must
have hived in Miss Margaret's winder. The Kirbys had dragged most
of their belongings into the yard and some was toting water from
the creek, but the whole cabin was in a blaze by now.</p>

<p>"Where's Miss Margaret?" I roared.</p>

<p>"She must be still in there," shrilled Miz Kirby. "A beam fell
and wedged her door so we couldn't open it, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>I grabbed a blanket one of the gals had rescued and plunged it
into the rain barrel and run for Miss Margaret's room. They wasn't
but one door in it, which led into the main part of the cabin, and
was jammed like they said, and I knowed I couldn't never get my
shoulders through either winder, so I jest put down my head and
rammed the wall full force and knocked four or five logs outa place
and made a hole big enough to go through.</p>

<p>The room was so full of smoke I was nigh blinded but I made out
a figger fumbling at the winder on the other side. A flaming beam
fell outa the roof and broke acrost my head with a loud report and
about a bucketful of coals rolled down the back of my neck, but I
paid no heed.</p>

<p>I charged through the smoke, nearly fracturing my shin on a
bedstead or something, and enveloped the figger in the wet blanket
and swept it up in my arms. It kicked wildly and fought and though
its voice was muffled in the blanket I catched some words I never
would of thought Miss Margaret would use, but I figgered she was
hysterical. She seemed to be wearing spurs, too, because I felt 'em
every time she kicked.</p>

<p>By this time the room was a perfect blaze and the roof was
falling in and we'd both been roasted if I'd tried to get back to
the hole I'd knocked in the oppersite wall. So I lowered my head
and butted my way through the near wall, getting all my eyebrows
and hair burnt off in the process, and come staggering through the
rooins with my precious burden and fell into the arms of my
relatives which was thronged outside.</p>

<p>"I've saved her!" I panted. "Pull off the blanket! Yo're safe,
Miss Margaret!"</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;!" said Miss Margaret.</p>

<p>Uncle Saul groped under the blanket and said: "By golly, if this
is the schoolteacher she's growed a remarkable set of whiskers
since I seen her last!"</p>

<p>He yanked off the blanket&mdash;to reveal the bewhiskered
countenance of Uncle Jeppard Grimes!</p>

<p>"Hell's fire!" I bellered. "What <i>you</i> doin' here?"</p>

<p>"I was comin' to jine the lynchin', you blame fool!" he snarled.
"I seen Bill's cabin was afire so I clum in through the back winder
to save Miss Margaret. She was gone, but they was a note she'd
left. I was fixin' to climb out the winder when you grabbed me, you
cussed maneyack!"</p>

<p>"Gimme that note!" I bellered, grabbing it. "Medina! Come here
and read it for me."</p>

<p>That note run:</p>

<p class="letter">"Dear Breckinridge. I am sorry, but I can't stay
on Bear Creek any longer. It was tough enough anyway, but being
expected to marry you was the last straw. You've been very kind to
me, but it would be too much like marrying a grizzly bear. Please
forgive me. I am eloping with J. Pembroke Pemberton. We're going
out the back window to avoid any trouble, and ride away on his
horse. Give my love to the children. We are going to Europe on our
honeymoon. With love, Margaret Devon."</p>

<p>"Now what you got to say?" sneered Uncle Jeppard.</p>

<p>"Where's my hoss?" I yelled, going temporarily insane. "I'll
foller 'em! They cain't do me this way! I'll have his sculp if I
have to foller 'em to Europe or to hell! Git outa my way!"</p>

<p>Uncle Saul grabbed me as I plunged through the crowd.</p>

<p>"Now, now, Breckinridge," he expostulated, trying to brace his
laigs as he hung on and was dragged down the road. "You cain't do
nothin' to him. She done this of her own free will. She made her
choice, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Release go of me!" I roared, jerking loose. "I'm ridin' on
their trail, and the man don't live which can stop me! Life won't
be worth livin' when Glory McGraw hears about this, and I aim to
take it out on that Britisher's hide! Hell hath no fury like a
Elkins scorned! Git outa my way!"</p>

<h2><a id="gent13" name="gent13">13. WHEN BEAR CREEK CAME TO CHAWED
EAR</a>
</h2>

<p style="text-indent:0">I DUNNO how far I rode that night before
the red haze cleared out from around me so's I could even see where
I was. I knowed I was follering the trail to War Paint, but that
was about all. I knowed Miss Margaret and J. Pembroke would head
for War Paint, and I knowed Cap'n Kidd would run 'em down before
they could get there, no matter how much start they had. And I must
of rode for hours before I come to my senses.</p>

<p>It was like waking up from a bad dream. I pulled up on the crest
of a rise and looked ahead of me where the trail dipped down into
the holler and up over the next ridge. It was jest getting daylight
and everything looked kinda grey and still. I looked down in the
trail and seen the hoof prints of J. Pembroke's hoss fresh in the
dust, and knowed they couldn't be more'n three or four miles ahead
of me. I could run' em down within the next hour.</p>

<p>But thinks I, what the hell? Am I plumb locoed? The gal's got a
right to marry whoever she wants to, and if she's idjit enough to
choose him instead of me, why, 'tain't for me to stand in her way.
I wouldn't hurt a hair onto her head; yet here I been aiming to
hurt her the wust way I could, by shooting down her man right
before her eyes. I felt so ashamed of myself I wanted to
cuss&mdash;and so sorry for myself I wanted to bawl.</p>

<p>"Go with my blessin'," I said bitterly, shaking my fist in the
direction where they'd went, and then reined Cap'n Kidd around and
headed for Bear Creek. I warn't aiming to stay there and endure
Glory McGraw's rawhiding, but I had to get me some clothes. Mine
was burnt to rags, and I didn't have no hat, and the buckshot in my
shoulder was stinging me now and then.</p>

<p>A mile or so on the back-trail I crossed the road that runs from
Cougar Paw to Grizzly Run, and I was hungry and thirsty so I turnt
up it to the tavern which had been built recent on the crossing at
Mustang Creek.</p>

<p>The sun warn't up when I pulled at the hitch-rack and clumb off
and went in. The bartender give a holler and fell backwards into a
tub of water and empty beer bottles, and started yelling for help,
and I seen a man come to one of the doors which opened into the
bar, and look at me. They was something familiar about him, but I
couldn't place him for the instant.</p>

<p>"Shet up and git outa that tub," I told the bar-keep petulantly.
"It's me, and I want a drink."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Breckinridge," says he, hauling hisself onto his
feet. "I rekernize you now, but I'm a nervous man, and you got no
idee what a start you gimme when you come through that door jest
now, with yore hair and eye-lashes all burnt off, and most of yore
clothes, and yore hide all black with soot. What the
hell&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cease them personal remarks and gimme some whisky," I snarled,
being in no mood for airy repartee. "Likewise wake up the cook and
tell him to fry me some ham and aigs."</p>

<p>So he sot the bottle onto the bar and stuck his head into the
kitchen and hollered: "Break out a fresh ham and start bustin'
aigs. Breckinridge Elkins craves fodder!"</p>

<p>When he come back I said: "Who was that lookin' through that
door there while ago?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that?" says he. "Why, that was a man nigh as famous as what
you be&mdash;Wild Bill Donovan. You-all ever met?"</p>

<p>"I'll say we has," I grunted, pouring me a drink. "He tried to
take Cap'n Kidd away from me when I was a ignorant kid. I was
forced to whup him with my bare fists before he'd listen to
reason."</p>

<p>"He's the only man I ever seen which was as big as you," said
the bar-keep. "And at that he ain't quite as thick in the chest and
arms as you be. I'll call him in and you-all can chin about old
times."</p>

<p>"Save yore breath," I growled. "The thing I craves to do about
chins with that coyote is to bust his'n with a pistol butt."</p>

<p>This seemed to kinda intimidate the bartender. He got behind the
bar and started shining beer mugs whilst I et my breakfast in
gloomy grandeur, halting only long enough to yell for somebody to
feed Cap'n Kidd. Three or four menials went out to do it, and being
afeared to try to lead Cap'n Kidd to the trough, they filled it and
carried it to him, so only one of them got kicked in the belly.
It's awful hard for the average man to dodge Cap'n Kidd.</p>

<p>Well, I finished my breakfast whilst they was dipping the
stable-hand in a hoss-trough to bring him to, and I said to the
bar-keep, "I ain't got no money to pay for what me and Cap'n Kidd
et, but I'll be headin' for War Paint late this evenin' or tonight,
and when I git the money I'll send it to you. I'm broke right now,
but I ain't goin' to be broke long."</p>

<p>"All right," he said, eyeing my scorched skull in morbid
fascination. "You got no idee how pecoolier you look, Breckinridge,
with that there bald dome&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shet up!" I roared wrathfully. A Elkins is sensitive about his
personal appearance. "This here is merely a temporary inconvenience
which I cain't help. Lemme hear no more about it. I'll shoot the
next son of a polecat which calls attention to my singed
condition!"</p>

<p>I then tied a bandanner around my head and got on Cap'n Kidd and
pulled for home.</p>

<p>I arriv at pap's cabin about the middle of the afternoon and my
family rallied around to remove the buckshot from my hide and
repair other damages which had been did.</p>

<p>Maw made each one of my brothers lend me a garment, and she let
'em out to fit me.</p>

<p>"Though how much good it'll do you," said she, "I don't know. I
never seen any man so hard on his clothes as you be, in my life. If
it ain't fire it's bowie knives, and if it ain't bowie knives, it's
buckshot."</p>

<p>"Boys will be boys, maw," soothed pap. "Breckinridge is jest
full of life and high spirits, ain't you, Breckinridge?"</p>

<p>"From the whiff I got of his breath," snorted Elinor, "I'd say
they is no doubt about the spirits."</p>

<p>"Right now I'm full of gloom and vain regrets," I says bitterly.
"Culture is a flop on Bear Creek, and my confidence has been
betrayed. I have tooken a sarpent with a British accent to my bosom
and been bit. I stands knee-deep in the rooins of education and
romance. Bear Creek lapses back into ignorance and barbarism and
corn-licker, and I licks the wounds of unrequited love like a old
wolf after a tussle with a pack of hound dawgs!"</p>

<p>"What you goin' to do?" ast pap, impressed.</p>

<p>"I'm headin' for War Paint," I said gloomily. "I ain't goin' to
stay here and have the life rawhided outa me by Glory McGraw. It's
a wonder to me she ain't been over already to gloat over my
misery."</p>

<p>"You ain't got no money," says pap.</p>

<p>"I'll git me some," I said. "And I ain't particular how. I'm
going now. I ain't goin' to wait for Glory McGraw to descend onto
me with her derned sourcasm."</p>

<p>So I headed for War Paint as soon as I could wash the soot off
of me. I had a Stetson I borrowed from Garfield and I jammed it
down around my ears so my bald condition warn't evident, because I
was awful sensitive about it.</p>

<p>Sundown found me some miles from the place where the trail
crossed the Cougar Paw-Grizzly Run road, and jest before the sun
dipped I was hailed by a pecooliar-looking gent.</p>

<p>He was tall and gangling&mdash;tall as me, but didn't weigh
within a hundred pounds as much. His hands hung about three foot
out of his sleeves, and his neck with a big adam's apple riz out of
his collar like a crane's, and he had on a plug hat instead of a
Stetson, and a long-tailed coat. He moreover sot his hoss like it
was a see-saw, and his stirrups was so short his bony knees come up
almost level with his shoulders. He wore his pants laigs down over
his boots, and altogether he was the funniest-looking human I ever
seen. Cap'n Kidd give a disgusted snort when he seen him and wanted
to kick his bony old sorrel nag in the belly, but I wouldn't let
him.</p>

<p>"Air you," said this apparition, p'inting a accusing finger at
me, "air you Breckinridge Elkins, the bearcat of the Humbolts?"</p>

<p>"I'm Breckinridge Elkins," I replied suspiciously.</p>

<p>"I dedooced as much," he says ominously. "I have come a long
ways to meet you, Elkins. They can be only one sun in the sky, my
roarin' grizzly from the high ranges. They can be only one champeen
in the State of Nevada. I'm him!"</p>

<p>"Oh, be you?" I says, scenting battle afar. "Well, I feels the
same way about one sun and one champeen. You look a mite skinny and
gantlin' to be makin' sech big talk, but far be it from me to deny
you a tussle after you've come so far to git it. Light down from
yore hoss whilst I mangles yore frame with a free and joyful
spirit! They is nothin' I'll enjoy more'n uprootin' a few acres of
junipers with yore carcass and festoonin' the crags with yore
innards."</p>

<p>"You mistakes my meanin', my bloodthirsty friend," says he. "I
warn't referrin' to mortal combat. Far as I'm consarned, yo're
supreme in that line. Nay, nay, B. Elkins, esquire! Reserve yore
personal ferocity for the b'ars and knife-fighters of yore native
mountains. I challenges you in another department entirely.</p>

<p>"Look well, my bowie-wieldin' orang-outang of the high peaks.
Fame is shakin' her mane. I am Jugbelly Judkins, and my talent is
guzzlin'. From the live-oak grown coasts of the Gulf to the
sun-baked buttes of Montana," says he oratorical, "I ain't yet met
the gent I couldn't drink under the table betwixt sundown and
sunup. I have met the most celebrated topers of plain and mountain,
and they have all went down in inglorious and rum-soaked defeat.
Afar off I heard men speak of you, praisin' not only yore genius in
alterin' the features of yore feller man, but also laudin' yore
capacity for corn-licker. So I have come to cast the ga'ntlet at
yore feet, as it were."</p>

<p>"Oh," I says, "you wants a drinkin' match."</p>

<p>"'Wants' is a weak word, my murderous friend," says he. "I
demands it."</p>

<p>"Well, come on," I said. "Le's head for War Paint then. They'll
be plenty of gents there willin' to lay heavy bets&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To hell with filthy lucre!" snorted Jugbelly. "My mountainous
friend, I am an artist. I cares nothin' for money. My reputation is
what I upholds."</p>

<p>"Well, then," I said, "they's a tavern on Mustang
Creek&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let it rot," says he. "I scorns these vulgar displays in low
inns and cheap taverns, my enormous friend. I supplies the sinews
of war myself. Foller me!"</p>

<p>So he turnt his hoss off the trail, and I follered him through
the bresh for maybe a mile, till he come to a small cave in a bluff
with dense thickets all around. He reched into the cave and hauled
out a gallon jug of licker.</p>

<p>"I hid a goodly supply of the cup that cheers in that cave,"
says he. "This is a good secluded spot where nobody never comes. We
won't be interrupted here, my brawny but feeble-minded gorilla of
the high ridges!"</p>

<p>"But what're we bettin'?" I demanded. "I ain't got no money. I
was goin' down to War Paint and git me a job workin' somebody's
claim for day-wages till I got me a stake and built it up playin'
poker, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You wouldn't consider wagerin' that there gigantic hoss you
rides?" says he, eyeing me very sharp.</p>

<p>"Never in the world," I says with a oath.</p>

<p>"Very well," says he. "Let the bets go. We battles for honor and
glory alone! Let the carnage commence!"</p>

<p>So we started. First he'd take a gulp, and then me, and the jug
was empty about the fourth gulp I taken, so he dragged out
another'n, and we emptied it, and he hauled out another. They
didn't seem to be no limit to his supply. He must of brought it
there on a whole train of pack mules. I never seen a man drink like
that skinny cuss. I watched the liquor careful, but he lowered it
every time he taken a swig, so I knowed he warn't jest pertending.
His belly expanded enormous as we went along and he looked very
funny, with his skinny frame, and that there enormous belly bulging
out his shirt till the buttons flew off of his coat.</p>

<p>I ain't goin' to tell you how much we drunk, because you
wouldn't believe me. But by midnight the glade was covered with
empty jugs and Jugbelly's arms was so tired lifting 'em he couldn't
hardly move. But the moon and the glade and everything was dancing
around and around to me, and he warn't even staggerring. He looked
kind of pale and wan, and onst he says, in a awed voice: "I
wouldn't of believed it if I hadn't saw it myself!" But he kept on
drinking and so did I, because I couldn't believe a skinny maverick
like that could lick me, and his belly kept getting bigger and
bigger till I was scairt it was going to bust, and things kept
spinning around me faster than ever.</p>

<p>After awhile I heard him muttering to hisself, away off: "This
is the last jug, and if it don't fix him, nothin' will. By God, he
ain't human."</p>

<p>That didn't make no sense to me, but he passed me the jug and
said: "Air you capable, my gulf-bellied friend?"</p>

<p>"Gimme that jug!" I muttered, bracing my laigs and getting a
firm hold of myself. I taken a big gulp&mdash;and then I didn't
know nothing.</p>

<p>When I woke up the sun was high above the trees. Cap'n Kidd was
cropping grass nearby, but Jugbelly was gone. So was his hoss and
all the empty jugs. There warn't no sign to show he'd ever been
there, only the taste in my mouth which I cain't describe because I
am a gent and there is words no gent will stoop to use. I felt like
kicking myself in the pants. I was ashamed something terrible at
being beat by that skinny mutt. It was the first time I'd ever
drunk enough to lay me out. I don't believe in a man making a hawg
out of hisself, even in a good cause.</p>

<p>I saddled Cap'n Kidd and pulled out for War Paint, and stopped a
few rods away and drunk five or six gallons of water at a spring,
and felt a lot better. I started on again, but before I come to the
trail, I heard somebody bawling and pulled up, and there sot a
feller on a stump, crying like his heart would bust.</p>

<p>"What's the trouble?" I ast, and he blinked the tears out of his
eyes and looked up mournful and melancholy. He was a scrawny cuss
with over-sized whiskers.</p>

<p>"You beholds in me," says he sobfully, "a critter tossed on the
crooel tides of fate. Destiny has dealt my hand from the bottom of
the deck. Whoa is me!" says he, and wept bitterly.</p>

<p>"Buck up," I said. "Things might well be wuss. Dammit," I said,
waxing irritable, "stop that blubberin' and tell me what's the
matter. I'm Breckinridge Elkins. Maybe I can help you."</p>

<p>He swallered some sobs, and said: "You air a man of kind
impulses and a noble heart. My name is Japhet Jalatin. In my youth
I made a enemy of a wealthy, powerful and unscrupulous man. He
framed me and sent me to the pen for somethin' I never done. I
busted free and under a assumed name, I come West. By hard workin'
I accumulated a tidy sum which I aimed to send to my sorrowin' wife
and baby datters. But jest last night I learnt that I had been
rekernized and the bloodhounds of the law was on my trail. I have
got to skip to Mexico. My loved ones won't never git the dough.</p>

<p>"Oh," says he, "if they was only some one I could trust to leave
it with till I could write 'em a letter and tell 'em where it was
so they could send a trusted man after it! But I trust nobody. The
man I left it with might tell where he got it, and then the
bloodhounds of the law would be onto my trail again, houndin' me
day and night."</p>

<p>He looked at me desperate, and says: "Young man, you got a kind
and honest face. Won't <i>you</i> take this here money and hold it
for my wife, till she can come after it?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I'll do that," I said. He jumped up and run to his hoss
which was tied nearby, and hauled out a buckskin poke, and shoved
it into my hands.</p>

<p>"Keep it till my wife comes for it," says he. "And promise me
you won't never breathe a word of how you got it, except to
her!"</p>

<p>"A Elkins never broke his word in his life," I said. "Wild
hosses couldn't drag it outa me."</p>

<p>"Bless you, young man!" he cries, and grabbed my hand with both
of his'n and pumped it up and down like a pump-handle, and then
jumped on his hoss and fogged. I thought they is some curious
people in the world, as I stuffed the poke in my saddle-bags and
headed for War Paint again.</p>

<p>I thought I'd turn off to the Mustang Creek tavern and eat me
some breakfast, but I hadn't much more'n hit the trail I'd been
follerin' when I met Jugbelly, than I heard hosses behind me, and
somebody hollered: "Stop, in the name of the law!"</p>

<p>I turnt around and seen a gang of men riding towards me, from
the direction of Bear Creek, and there was the sheriff leading 'em,
and right beside him was pap and Uncle John Garfield and Uncle Bill
Buckner and Uncle Bearfield Gordon. A tenderfoot onst called them
four men the patriarchs of Bear Creek. I dunno what he meant, but
they generally decides argyments which has got beyond the public
control, as you might say. Behind them and the sheriff come about
thirty more men, most of which I rekernized as citizens of Chawed
Ear, and therefore definitely not my friends. Also, to my surprise,
I rekernized Wild Bill Donovan amongst 'em, with his thick black
hair falling down to his shoulders. They was four other
hard-looking strangers which rode clost beside him.</p>

<p>All the Chawed Ear men had sawed-off shotguns and that surprised
me, because that made it look like maybe they was coming to arrest
me, and I hadn't done nothing, except steal their schoolteacher,
several weeks before, and if they'd meant to arrest me for that,
they'd of tried it before now.</p>

<p>"There he is!" yelped the sheriff, p'inting at me. "Han's
up!"</p>

<p>"Don't be a damn' fool!" roared pap, knocking his shotgun out of
his hands as he started to raise it. "You want to git you and yore
cussed posse slaughtered? Come here, Breckinridge," he said, and I
rode up to them, some bewildered. I could see pap was worried. He
scowled and tugged at his beard. My uncles didn't have no more
expression onto their faces than so many red Injuns.</p>

<p>"What the hell's all this about?" I ast.</p>

<p>"Take off yore hat," ordered the sheriff.</p>

<p>"Look here, you long-legged son of a mangy skunk," I said
heatedly, "if yo're tryin' to rawhide me, lemme tell you right
now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Tain't a joke," growled pap. "Take off yore sombrero."</p>

<p>I done so bewilderedly, and instantly four men in the gang
started hollering: "That's him! That's the man! He had on a mask,
but when he taken his hat off, we seen the hair was all off his
head! That's shore him!"</p>

<p>"Elkins," said the sheriff, "I arrests you for the robbery of
the Chawed Ear stage!"</p>

<p>I convulsively went for my guns. It was jest a instinctive move
which I done without knowing it, but the sheriff hollered and
ducked, and the possemen throwed up their guns, and pap spurred in
between us.</p>

<p>"Put down them guns, everybody!" he roared, covering me with one
six-shooter and the posse with the other'n. "First man that pulls a
trigger, I'll salivate him!"</p>

<p>"I ain't aimin' to shoot nobody!" I bellered. "But what the hell
is this all about?"</p>

<p>"As if he didn't know!" sneered one of the posse. "Tryin' to ack
innercent! Heh heh heh&mdash;<i>glup!</i>"</p>

<p>Pap riz in his stirrups and smashed him over the head with his
right-hand six-shooter barrel, and he crumpled into the trail and
laid there with the blood oozing out of his sculp.</p>

<p>"Anybody else feel humorous?" roared pap, sweeping the posse
with a terrible eye. Evidently nobody did, so he turnt around and
says to me, and I seen drops of perspiration standing on his face
which warn't caused altogether by the heat. Says he: "Breckinridge,
early last night the Chawed Ear stage was stuck up and robbed a few
miles t'other side of Chawed Ear. The feller which done it not only
taken the passengers' money and watches and things, and the mail
sack, but he also shot the driver, old Jim Harrigan, jest out of
pure cussedness. Old Jim's layin' over in Chawed Ear now with a
bullet through his laig.</p>

<p>"These born fools thinks you done it! They was on Bear Creek
before daylight&mdash;the first time a posse ever dared to come
onto Bear Creek, and it was all me and yore uncles could do to keep
the boys from massacrein, 'em. Bear Creek was sure wrought up.
These mavericks," pap p'inted a finger of scorn at the four men
which had claimed to identify me, "was on the stage. You know Ned
Ashley, Chawed Ear's leadin' merchant. The others air strangers.
They say their names is Hurley, Jackson and Slade. They claim to
lost considerable money."</p>

<p>"We done that!" clamored Jackson. "I had a buckskin poke crammed
full of gold pieces the scoundrel taken. I tell you, that's the man
which done it!" He p'inted at me, and pap turnt to Ned Ashley, and
said: "Ned, what do you say?"</p>

<p>"Well, Bill," says Ashley reluctantly, "I hates to say it, but I
don't see who else it could of been. The robber was Breckinridge's
size, all right, and you know they ain't many men that big. He
warn't ridin' Cap'n Kidd, of course; he was ridin' a big bay mare.
He had on a mask, but as he rode off he taken off his hat, and we
all seen his head in the moonlight. The hair was all off of it,
jest like it is Breckinridge's. Not like he was naturally bald, but
like it had been burnt off or shaved off recent."</p>

<p>"Well," says the sheriff, "unless he can prove a alibi I'll have
to arrest him."</p>

<p>"Breckinridge," says pap, "whar was you last night?"</p>

<p>"I was layin' out in the woods drunk," I says.</p>

<p>I felt a aidge of doubt in the air.</p>

<p>"I didn't know you could drink enough to git drunk," says pap.
"It ain't like you, anyway. What made you? Was it thinkin' about
that gal?"</p>

<p>"Naw," I said. "I met a gent in a plug hat named Jugbelly
Judkins and he challenged me to a drinkin' match."</p>

<p>"Did you win?" ast pap anxiously.</p>

<p>"Naw!" I confessed in bitter shame. "I lost."</p>

<p>Pap muttered disgustedly in his beard, and the sheriff says:
"Can you perduice this Judkins <i>hombre?</i>"</p>

<p>"I dunno where he went," I said. "He'd pulled out when I woke
up."</p>

<p>"Very inconvenient, I says!" says Wild Bill Donovan, running his
fingers lovingly through his long black locks, and spitting.</p>

<p>"Who ast you yore opinion?" I snarled blood-thirstily. "What you
doin' in the Humbolts? Come back to try to git even for Cap'n
Kidd?"</p>

<p>"I forgot that trifle long ago," says he. "I holds no petty
grudge. I jest happened to be ridin' the road this side of Chawed
Ear when the posse come by and I come with 'em jest to see the
fun."</p>

<p>"You'll see more fun than you can tote home if you fool with
me," I promised.</p>

<p>"Enough of this," snorted pap. "Breckinridge, even I got to
admit yore alibi sounds kind of fishy. A critter named Jugbelly
with a plug hat! It sounds plumb crazy. Still and all, we'll look
for this cussed maverick, and if we find him and he establishes
whar you was last night, why&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He put my gold in his saddle-bags!" clamored Jackson. "I seen
him! That's the same saddle! Look in them bags and I bet you'll
find it!"</p>

<p>"Go ahead and look," I invited, and the sheriff went up to Cap'n
Kidd very gingerly, whilst I restrained Cap'n Kidd from kicking his
brains out. He run his hand in the bags and I'll never forget the
look on pap's face when the sheriff hauled out that buckskin poke
Japhet Jalatin had give me. I'd forgot all about it.</p>

<p>"How you explain <i>this</i>?" exclaimed the sheriff. I said
nothing. A Elkins never busts his word, not even if he hangs for
it.</p>

<p>"It's mine!" hollered Jackson. "You'll find my initials worked
onto it! J.J., for Judah Jackson."</p>

<p>"There they air," announced the sheriff. "J.J. That's for Judah
Jackson, all right."</p>

<p>"They don't stand for that!" I roared. "They stand for&mdash;"
Then I stopped. I couldn't tell him they stood for Japhet Jalatin
without breaking my word and giving away Japhet's secret.</p>

<p>"'Tain't his'n," I growled. "I didn't steal it from nobody."</p>

<p>"Then where'd you git it?" demanded the sheriff.</p>

<p>"None of yore business," I said sullenly.</p>

<p>Pap spurred forwards, and I seen beads of sweat on his face.</p>

<p>"Well, say somethin', damn it!" he roared. "Don't jest set
there! No Elkins was ever accused of thievin' before, but if you
done it, say so! I demands that you tells me whar you got that
gold! If you didn't take it off'n the stage, why don't you say
so?"</p>

<p>"I cain't tell you," I muttered.</p>

<p>"Hell's fire!" bellered pap. "Then you must of robbed that
stage! What a black shame onto Bear Creek this here is! But these
town-folks ain't goin' to haul you off to their cussed jail, even
if you did turn thief! Jest come out plain and tell me you done it,
and we'll lick the whole cussed posse if necessary!"</p>

<p>I seen my uncles behind him drawing in and cocking their
Winchesters, but I was too dizzy with the way things was happening
to think straight about anything.</p>

<p>"I never robbed the cussed stage!" I roared. "I cain't tell you
where I got that gold&mdash;but I didn't rob the gol-derned
stage."</p>

<p>"So yo're a liar as well as a thief!" says pap, drawing back
from me like I was a reptile. "To think it should come to this!
From this day onwards," he says, shaking his fist in my face, "you
ain't no son of mine! I disowns you! When they lets you out of the
pen, don't you come sneakin' back to Bear Creek! Us folks there is
rough and ready; we kyarves and shoots each other free and
frequent; but no Bear Creek man ever yet stole nor lied. I could
forgive the thievin', maybe, maybe even the shootin' of pore old
Jim Harrigan. But I cain't forgive a lie. Come on, boys."</p>

<p>And him and my uncles turnt around and rode back up the trail
towards Bear Creek with their eyes straight ahead of 'em and their
backs straight as ramrods. I glared after 'em wildly, feeling like
the world was falling to pieces. It war the first time in my life
I'd ever knowed Bear Creek folks to turn their backs on a Bear
Creek man.</p>

<p>"Well, come along," said the sheriff, and started to hand the
poke to Jackson, when I come alive. I warn't going to let Japhet
Jalatin's wife spend the rest of her life in poverty if I could
help it. I made one swoop and grabbed the poke out of his hand and
simultaneous drove in the spurs. Cap'n Kidd made one mighty lunge
and knocked Jackson and his hoss sprawling and went over them and
into the bresh whilst them fool posse-men was fumbling with their
guns. They was a lot of cussing and yelling behind me and some
shooting, but we was out of sight of them in a instant, and I went
crashing on till I hit a creek I knowed was there. I jumped off and
grabbed a big rock which was in the bed of the creek, with about
three foot of water around it&mdash;jest the top stuck out above
the water. I grabbed it and lifted it, and stuck the poke down
under it, and let the rock back down again. It was safe here.
Nobody'd ever suspect it was hid there, and it was a cinch nobody
was going to be lifting the rock jest for fun and find the gold
accidental. It weighed about as much as the average mule.</p>

<p>Cap'n Kidd bolted off through the woods as the posse come
crashing through the bresh, yelling like Injuns, and they throwed
down their shotguns on me as I clumb up the bank, dripping wet.</p>

<p>"Catch that hoss!" yelled the sheriff. "The gold's in the
saddle-bags!"</p>

<p>"You'll never catch that hoss," opined Wild Bill Donovan. "I
know him of old."</p>

<p>"Maybe Elkins is got the gold on him!" hollered Jackson. "Search
him!"</p>

<p>I didn't make no resistance as the sheriff taken my guns and
snapped a exter heavy pair of hand-cuffs onto my wrists. I was
still kind of numb from having pap and my uncles walk out on me
like that. All I'd been able to think of up to then was to hide the
gold, and when that was hid my brain wouldn't work no further.</p>

<p>"Elkins ain't got it on him!" snarled the sheriff, after
slapping my pockets. "Go after that hoss! Shoot him if you cain't
catch him."</p>

<p>"No use for that," I says. "It ain't in the saddle-bags. I hid
it where you won't never find it."</p>

<p>"Look in all the holler trees!" says Jackson, and added
viciously: "We might <i>make</i> him talk."</p>

<p>"Shet up," said the sheriff. "Anything <i>you</i> could do to
him would jest make him mad. He's actin' tame and gentle now. But
he's got a broodin' gleam in his eye. Le's git him in jail before
he gits a change of heart and starts remodellin' the landscape with
the posse's carcasses."</p>

<p>"I'm a broken man," I says mournfully. "My own clan has went
back on me, and I got no friends. Take me to jail if you wanta! All
places is dreary for a man whose kin has disown him."</p>

<p>So we went to Chawed Ear.</p>

<p>One of the fellers who was riding a big strong hoss lemme have
his'n, and the posse closed around me with their shotguns p'inting
at me, and we headed out.</p>

<p>It was after dark when we got to Chawed Ear, but everybody was
out in the streets to see the posse bring me in. They warn't no
friendly faces in that crowd. I'd been very onpopular in Chawed Ear
ever since I stole their schoolteacher. I looked for old Joshua
Braxton, but somebody said he was off on a prospecting trip.</p>

<p>They stopped at a log-hut clost to the jail, and some men was
jest getting through working onto it.</p>

<p>"That there," says the sheriff, "is yore private jail. We built
it special for you. As soon as word come last night that you'd
robbed the stage, I set fifteen men buildin' that jail, and they're
jest now gittin' through."</p>

<p>Well, I didn't think anybody could build anything in a night and
a day which could hold me, but I didn't have no thought of trying
to break out. I didn't have the heart. All I could think of was the
way pap and my uncles had rode off and left me disowned and
arrested.</p>

<p>I went in like he told me, and sot down on the bunk, and heard
'em barring the door on the outside. They was fellers holding
torches outside, and the light come in at the winder so I could see
it was a good strong jail. They was jest one room, with a door
towards the town and a winder in the other side. It had a floor
made out of logs, and the roof and walls was made out of heavy
logs, and they was a big log at each corner sot in concrete, which
was something new in them mountains, and the concrete wasn't dry
yet. The bars in the winder was thick as a man's wrist, and drove
clean through the sill and lintel logs and the ends clinched, and
chinks betwixt the logs was tamped in with concrete. The door was
made outa sawed planks four inches thick and braced with iron, and
the hinges was big iron pins working in heavy iron sockets, and
they was a big lock onto the door and three big bars made outa logs
sot in heavy iron brackets.</p>

<p>Everybody outside was jammed around the winder trying to look in
at me, but I put my head in my hands and paid no attention to 'em.
I was trying to think but everything kept going round and round.
Then the sheriff chased everybody away except them he told off to
stay there and guard the jail, and he put his head to the bars and
said: "Elkins, it'll go easier with you, maybe, if you'll tell us
where you hid that there gold."</p>

<p>"When I do," I said gloomily, "there'll be ice in hell thick
enough for the devil to skate on."</p>

<p>"All right," he snapped. "If you want to be stubborn. You'll git
twenty years for this, or I miss my guess."</p>

<p>"Gwan," I said, "and leave me to my misery. What's a prison term
to a man which has jest been disowned by his own blood-kin?"</p>

<p>He pulled back from the winder and I heard him say to somebody:
"It ain't no use. Them Bear Creek devils are the most uncivilized
white men I ever seen in my life. You cain't do nothin' with one of
'em. I'm goin' to send some men back to look for the gold around
that creek we found him climbin' out of. I got a idee he hid it in
a holler tree somewheres. He's that much like a b'ar. Likely he hid
it and then run and got in the creek jest to throw us off the
scent. Thought he'd make us think he hid it on t'other side of the
creek. I bet he hid it in a tree this side somewheres.</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to git some food and some sleep. I didn't git to bed
at all last night. You fellers watch him clost, and if folks git
too rambunctious around the jail, call me quick."</p>

<p>"Ain't nobody around the jail now," said a familiar voice.</p>

<p>"I know," says the sheriff. "They're back in town lickerin' up
at all the bars. But Elkins is got plenty of enemies here, and they
ain't no tellin' what might bust loose before mornin'."</p>

<p>I heard him leave, and then they was silence, except for some
men whispering off somewheres nearby but talking too low for me to
make out what they was saying. I could hear noises coming from the
town, snatches of singing, and a occasional yell, but no
pistol-shooting like they usually is. The jail was on the aidge of
town, and the winder looked in the other direction, acrost a narrer
clearing with thick woods bordering it.</p>

<p>Purty soon a man come and stuck his head up to the winder and I
seen by the starlight that it was Wild Bill Donovan.</p>

<p>"Well, Elkins," says he, "you think you've finally found a jail
which can hold you?"</p>

<p>"What you doin' hangin' around here?" I muttered.</p>

<p>He patted his shotgun and said: "Me and four of my friends has
been app'inted special guards. But I tell you what I'll do. I hate
to see a man down and out like you be, and booted out by his own
family and shore to do at least fifteen years in the pen. You tell
me where you hid that there gold, and give me Cap'n Kidd, and I'll
contrive to let you escape before mornin'. I got a fast hoss hid
out there in the thickets, right over yonder, see? You can fork
that hoss and be gone outa the country before the sheriff could
catch you. All you got to do is give me Cap'n Kidd, and that gold.
What you say?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't give you Cap'n Kidd," I said, "not if they was goin'
to hang me."</p>

<p>"Well," he sneered, "'tain't none too shore they ain't. They's
plenty of rope-law talk in town tonight. Folks are purty well
wrought up over you shootin' old Jim Harrigan."</p>

<p>"I didn't shoot him, damn yore soul!" I said.</p>

<p>"You'll have a hell of a time provin' it," says he, and turnt
around and walked around towards the other end of the jail with his
shotgun under his arm.</p>

<p>Well, I dunno how long I sot there with my head in my hands and
jest suffered. Noises from the town seemed dim and far off. I
didn't care if they come and lynched me before morning, I was that
low-spirited. I would of bawled if I could of worked up enough
energy, but I was too low for that even.</p>

<p>Then somebody says: "Breckinridge!" and I looked up and seen
Glory McGraw looking in at the winder with the rising moon behind
her.</p>

<p>"Go ahead and t'ant me," I said numbly. "Everything else has
happened to me. You might as well, too."</p>

<p>"I ain't goin' to t'ant you!" she said fiercely. "I come here to
help you, and I aim to, no matter what you says!"</p>

<p>"You better not let Donovan see you talkin' to me," I says.</p>

<p>"I done seen him," she said. "He didn't want to let me come to
the winder, but I told him I'd go to the sheriff for permission if
he didn't, so he said he'd let me talk ten minutes. Listen: did he
offer to help you escape if you'd do somethin' for him?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," I said. "Why?"</p>

<p>She ground her teeth slightly.</p>

<p>"I thought so!" says she. "The dirty rat! I come through the
woods, and snuck on foot the last few hundred feet to git a look at
the jail before I come out in the open. They's a hoss tied out
there in the thickets and a man hidin' behind a log right nigh it
with a sawed-off shotgun. Donovan's always hated you, ever since
you taken Cap'n Kidd away from him. He aimed to git you shot whilst
tryin' to escape. When I seen that ambush I jest figgered on
somethin' like that."</p>

<p>"How'd you git here?" I ast, seeing she seemed to really mean
what she said about helping me.</p>

<p>"I follered the posse and yore kinfolks when they came down from
Bear Creek," she said. "I kept to the bresh on my pony, and was
within hearin' when they stopped you on the trail. After everybody
had left I went and caught Cap'n Kidd, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> caught Cap'n Kidd!" I said in dumbfoundment.</p>

<p>"Certainly," says she. "Hosses has frequently got more sense
than men. He'd come back to the creek where he'd saw you last and
looked like he was plumb broken-hearted because he couldn't find
you. I turnt the pony loose and started him home, and I come on to
Chawed Ear on Cap'n Kidd."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm a saw-eared jackrabbit!" I said helplessly.</p>

<p>"Hosses knows who their friends is," says she. "Which is more'n
I can say for some men. Breckinridge, pull out of this! Tear this
blame jail apart and le's take to the hills! Cap'n Kidd's waitin'
out there behind that big clump of oaks. They'll never catch
you!"</p>

<p>"I ain't got the strength, Glory," I said helplessly. "My
strength has oozed out of me like licker out of a busted jug.
What's the use to bust jail, even if I could? I'm a marked man, and
a broken man. My own kin has throwed me down. I got no
friends."</p>

<p>"You have, too!" she said fiercely. "<i>I</i> ain't throwed you
down. I'm standin' by you till hell freezes!"</p>

<p>"But folks thinks I'm a thief and a liar!" I says, about ready
to weep.</p>

<p>"What I care what they thinks?" says she. "If you <i>was</i> all
them things, I'd still stand by you! But you ain't, and I know
it!"</p>

<p>For a second I couldn't see her because my sight got blurry, but
I groped and found her hand tense on the winder bar, and I said:
"Glory, I dunno what to say. I been a fool, and thought hard things
about you, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Forgit it," says she. "Listen: if you won't bust out of here,
we got to prove to them fools that you didn't rob that stage. And
we got to do it quick, because them strangers Hurley and Jackson
and Slade air in town circulatin' around through the bars and
stirrin' them fool Chawed Ear folks up to lynchin' you. A mob's
liable to come bustin' out of town any minute. Won't you tell me
where you got that there gold they found in yore saddle-bags?
<i>I</i> know you never stole it, but if you was to tell me, it
might help us."</p>

<p>I shaken my head helplessly.</p>

<p>"I cain't tell you," I said. "Not even you. I promised not to. A
Elkins cain't break his word."</p>

<p>"Ha!" says she. "Listen: did some stranger meet you and give you
that poke of gold to give to his starvin' wife and chillern, and
make you promise not to tell nobody where you got it, because his
life was in danger?"</p>

<p>"Why, how'd you know?" I exclaimed in amazement.</p>

<p>"So that <i>was</i> it!" she exclaimed, jumping up and down in
her excitement. "How'd I know? Because I know you, you big
bone-headed mush-hearted chump! Lissen: don't you see how they
worked you? This was a put-up job.</p>

<p>"Jugbelly got you off and made you drink so's you'd be outa the
way and couldn't prove no alibi. Then somebody that looked like you
robbed the stage and shot old man Harrigan in the laig jest to make
the crime wuss. Then this feller what's-his-name give you the money
so they'd find it onto you!"</p>

<p>"It looks sensible!" I said dizzily.</p>

<p>"It's bound to be!" says she. "Now all we got to do is find
Jugbelly and the feller which give you the gold, and the bay mare
the robber rode. But first we got to find a man which has got it in
for you enough to frame you like that."</p>

<p>"That's a big order," I says. "Nevada's full of gents which
would give their eye-teeth to do me a injury."</p>

<p>"A big man," she mused. "Big enough to be mistook for you, with
his head shaved, and ridin' a big bay mare. Hmmmmm! A man which
hates you enough to do anything to you, and is got sense enough to
frame somethin' like this!"</p>

<p>And jest then Wild Bill Donovan come around the corner of the
jail with his shotgun under his arm.</p>

<p>"You've talked to that jail-bird long enough, gal," he says.
"You better pull out. The noise is gettin' louder all the time in
town, and it wouldn't surprise me to see quite a bunch of folks
comin' to the jail before long&mdash;with a necktie for yore friend
there."</p>

<p>"And I bet you'll plumb risk yore life defendin' him," she
sneered.</p>

<p>He laughed and taken off his sombrero and run his fingers
through his thick black locks.</p>

<p>"I don't aim to git none of my valuable gore spilt over a
stagecoach robber," says he. "But I like yore looks, gal. Why you
want to waste yore time with a feller like that when they is a man
like me around, I dunno! His head looks like a peeled onion! The
hair won't never git no chance to grow out, neither, 'cause he's
goin' to git strung up before it has time. Whyn't you pick out a
handsome <i>hombre</i> like me, which has got a growth of hair as
is hair?"</p>

<p>"He got his hair burnt off tryin' to save a human life," says
she. "Somethin' that ain't been said of you, you big monkey!"</p>

<p>"Haw haw haw!" says he. "Ain't you got the spunk, though! That's
the way I like gals."</p>

<p>"You might not like me so much," says she suddenly, "if I told
you I'd found that big bay mare you rode last night!"</p>

<p>He started like he was shot and blurted out: "Yo're lyin'!
Nobody could find her where I hid her&mdash;"</p>

<p>He checked hisself sudden, but Glory give a yelp.</p>

<p>"<i>I thought so!</i> It was you!" And before he could stop her
she grabbed his black locks and yanked. And his sculp come off in
her hands and left his head as bare as what mine was!</p>

<p>"A wig jest like I thought!" she shrieked. "You robbed that
stage! You shaved yore head to look like Breckinridge&mdash;" He
grabbed her and clapped his hand over her mouth, and yelped: "Joe!
Tom! Buck!" And at the sight of Glory struggling in his grasp I
snapped them handcuffs like they was rotten cords and laid hold of
them winder bars and tore 'em out. The logs they was sot in split
like kindling wood and I come smashing through that winder like a
b'ar through a chicken coop. Donovan let go of Glory and grabbed up
his shotgun to blow my head off, but she grabbed the barrel and
throwed all her weight onto it, so he couldn't bring it to bear on
me, and my feet hit the ground jest as three of his pals come
surging around the corner of the jail.</p>

<p>They was so surprised to see me out, and going so fast they
couldn't stop and they run right into me and I gathered 'em to my
bosom and you ought to of heard the bones crack and snap. I jest
hugged the three of 'em together onst and then throwed 'em in all
direction like a b'ar ridding hisself of a pack of hounds. Two of
'em fractured their skulls agen the jail-house and t'other broke
his laig on a stump.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Donovan had let loose of his shotgun and run for the
woods and Glory scrambled up onto her feet with the shotgun and let
<i>bam</i> at him, but he was so far away by that time all she done
was sting his hide with the shot. But he hollered tremendous jest
the same. I started to run after him, but Glory grabbed me.</p>

<p>"He's headed for that hoss I told you about!" she panted. "Git
Cap'n Kidd! We'll have to be a-hoss-back if we catch him!"</p>

<p><i>Bang!</i> went a shotgun in the thickets, and Donovan's
maddened voice yelled: "Stop that, you cussed fool! This ain't
Elkins! It's me! The game's up! We got to shift!"</p>

<p>"Lemme ride with you!" hollered another voice, which I reckoned
was the feller Donovan had planted to shoot me if I agreed to try
to escape. "My hoss is on the other side of the jail!"</p>

<p>"Git off, blast you!" snarled Donovan. "This hoss won't carry
double!" <i>Wham!</i> I jedged he'd hit his pal over the head with
his six-shooter. "I owe you that for fillin' my hide with buckshot,
you blame fool!" Donovan roared as he went crashing off into the
bresh.</p>

<p>By this time we'd reched the oaks Cap'n Kidd was tied behind,
and I swung up into the saddle and Glory jumped up behind me.</p>

<p>"I'm goin' with you!" says she. "Don't argy! Git, goin'!"</p>

<p>I headed for the thickets Donovan had disappeared into, and jest
inside of 'em we seen a feller sprawled on the ground with a
shotgun in his hand and his sculp split open. Even in the midst of
my righteous wrath I had a instant of ca'm and serene joy as I
reflected that Donovan had got sprinkled with buckshot by the
feller who evidently mistook him for me. The deeds of the wicked
sure do return onto 'em.</p>

<p>Donovan had took straight out through the bresh, and left gaps
in the bushes a blind man could foller. We could hear his hoss
crashing through the timber ahead of us, and then purty soon the
smashing stopped but we could hear the hoofs lickety-split on hard
ground, so I knowed he'd come out into a path, and purty soon so
did we. Moonlight hit down into it, but it was winding so we
couldn't see very far ahead, but the hoof-drumming warn't pulling
away from us, and we knowed we was closing in onto him. He was
riding a fast critter but I knowed Cap'n Kidd would run it off its
fool laigs within the next mile.</p>

<p>Then we seen a small clearing ahead and a cabin in it with
candle-light coming through the winders, and Donovan busted out of
the trees and jumped off his hoss which bolted into the bresh.
Donovan run to the door and yelled: "Lemme in, you damn' fools! The
game's up and Elkins is right behind me!"</p>

<p>The door opened and he fell in onto his all-fours and yelled:
"Shet the door and bolt it! I don't believe even he can bust it
down!" And somebody else hollered: "Blow out the candles! There he
is at the aidge of the trees."</p>

<p>Guns begun to crack and bullets whizzed past me, so I backed
Cap'n Kidd back into cover and jumped off and picked up a big log
which warn't rotten yet, and run out of the clearing and made
towards the door. This surprised the men in the cabin, and only one
man shot at me and he hit the log. The next instant I hit the
door&mdash;or rather I hit the door with the log going full clip
and the door splintered and ripped offa the hinges and crashed
inwards, and three or four men got pinned under it and yelled
bloody murder.</p>

<p>I lunged into the cabin over the rooins of the door and the
candles was all out, but a little moonlight streamed in and showed
me three or four vague figgers before me. They was all shooting at
me but it was so dark in the cabin they couldn't see to aim good
and only nicked me in a few unimportant places. So I went for them
and got both arms full of human beings and started sweeping the
floor with 'em. I felt several fellers underfoot because they
hollered when I tromped on 'em, and every now and then I felt
somebody's head with my foot and give it a good rousing kick. I
didn't know who I had hold of because the cabin was so full of
gunpowder smoke by this time that the moon didn't do much good. But
none of the fellers was big enough to be Donovan, and them I
stomped on didn't holler like him, so I started clearing house by
heaving 'em one by one through the door, and each time I throwed
one they was a resounding <i>whack!</i> outside that I couldn't
figger out till I realized that Glory was standing outside with a
club and knocking each one in the head as he come out.</p>

<p>Then the next thing I knowed the cabin was empty, except for me
and a figger which was dodging back and forth in front of me trying
to get past me to the door. So I laid hands onto it and heaved it
up over my head and started to throw it through the door when it
hollered: "Quarter, my titanic friend, quarter! I surrenders and
demands to be treated as a prisoner of war!"</p>

<p><i>"Jugbelly Judkins!"</i> I says.</p>

<p>"The same," says he, "or what's left of him!"</p>

<p>"Come out here where I can talk to you!" I roared, and groped my
way out of the door with him. As I emerged I got a awful lick over
the head, and then Glory give a shriek like a stricken elk.</p>

<p>"Oh, Breckinridge!" she wailed. "I didn't know it war you!"</p>

<p>"Never mind!" I says, brandishing my victim before her. "I got
my alerbi right here by the neck! <i>Jugbelly Judkins</i>," I says
sternly, clapping him onto his feet and waving a enormous fist
under his snoot, "if you values yore immortal soul, speak up and
tell where I was all last night!"</p>

<p>"Drinkin' licker with me a mile off the Bear Creek trail," gasps
he, staring wildly about at the figgers which littered the ground
in front of the cabin. "I confesses all! Lead me to the bastile! My
sins has catched up with me. I'm a broken man. Yet I am but a tool
in the hands of a mastermind, same as these misguided sons of crime
which lays there&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One of 'em's tryin' to crawl off," quoth Glory, fetching the
aforesaid critter a clout on the back of the neck with her club. He
fell on his belly and howled in a familiar voice.</p>

<p>I started vi'lently and bent over to look close at him.</p>

<p>"Japhet Jalatin!" I hollered. "You cussed thief, you lied to me
about yore wife starvin'!"</p>

<p>"If he told you he had a wife it was a gross understatement,"
says Jugbelly. "He's got three that I know of, includin' a Piute
squaw, a Mexican woman, and a Chinee gal in San Francisco. But to
the best of my knowledge they're all fat and hearty."</p>

<p>"I have been took for a cleanin' proper," I roared, gnashing my
teeth. "I've been played for a sucker! My trustin' nature has been
tromped on! My faith in humanity is soured! Nothin' but blood can
wipe out this here infaminy!"</p>

<p>"Don't take it out on us," begged Japhet. "It war all Donovan's
idee."</p>

<p>"Where's he?" I yelled, glaring around.</p>

<p>"Knowin' his nature as I does," said Judkins, working his jaw to
see if it was broke in more'n one place, "I would sejest that he
snuck out the back door whilst the fightin' was goin' on, and is
now leggin' it for the corral he's got hid in the thicket behind
the cabin, where he secreted the bay mare he rode the night he held
up the stagecoach."</p>

<p>Glory pulled a pistol out of one of 'em's belt which he'd never
got a chance to use, and she says: "Go after him, Breck. I'll take
care of these coyotes!"</p>

<p>I taken one look at the groaning rooins on the ground, and
decided she could all right, so I whistled to Cap'n Kidd, and he
come, for a wonder. I forked him and headed for the thicket behind
the cabin and jest as I done so I seen Donovan streaking it out the
other side on a big bay mare. The moon made everything as bright as
day.</p>

<p>"Stop and fight like a man, you mangy polecat!" I thundered, but
he made no reply except to shoot at me with his six-shooter, and
seeing I ignored this, he spurred the mare which he was riding
bareback and headed for the high hills.</p>

<p>She was a good mare, but she didn't have a chance agen Cap'n
Kidd. We was only a few hundred feet behind and closing in fast
when Donovan busted out onto a bare ridge which overlooked a
valley. He looked back and seen I was going to ride him down within
the next hundred yards, and he jumped offa the mare and taken cover
behind a pine which stood by itself a short distance from the aidge
of the bresh. They warn't no bushes around it, and to rech him I'd
of had to cross a open space in the moonlight, and every time I
come out of the bresh he shot at me. So I kept in the aidge of the
bresh and unslung my lariat and roped the top of the pine, and sot
Cap'n Kid agen it with all his lungs and weight, and tore it up by
the roots.</p>

<p>When it fell and left Donovan without no cover he run for the
rim of the valley, but I jumped down and grabbed a rock about the
size of a man's head and throwed it at him, and hit him jest above
the knee on the hind laig. He hit the ground rolling and throwed
away both of his six-shooters and hollered: "Don't shoot! I
surrenders!"</p>

<p>I quiled my lariat and come up to where he was laying, and says:
"Cease that there disgustin' belly-achin'. You don't hear <i>me</i>
groanin' like that, do you?"</p>

<p>"Take me to a safe, comfortable jail," says he. "I'm a broken
man. My soul is full of remorse and my hide is full of buckshot. My
laig is broke and my spirit is crushed. Where'd you git the cannon
you shot me with?"</p>

<p>"'Twarn't no cannon," I said with dignity. "I throwed a rock at
you."</p>

<p>"But the tree fell!" he says wildly. "Don't tell me you didn't
do <i>that</i> with artillery!"</p>

<p>"I roped it and pulled it down," I said, and he give a loud
groan and sunk back on the ground, and I said: "Pardon me if I
seems to tie yore hands behind yore back and put you acrost Cap'n
Kidd. Likely they'll set yore laig at Chawed Ear if you remember to
remind 'em about it."</p>

<p>He said nothin' except to groan loud and lusty all the way back
to the cabin, and when we got there Glory had tied all them
scoundrels' hands behind 'em, and they'd all come to and was
groaning in chorus. I found a corral near the house full of their
hosses, so I saddled 'em and put them critters onto 'em, and tied
their laigs to their stirrups. Then I tied the hosses head to tail,
all except one I saved for Glory, and we headed for Chawed Ear.</p>

<p>"What you aimin' to do now, Breck?" she ast as we pulled
out.</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to take these critters back to Chawed Ear," I said
fiercely, "and make 'em make their spiel to the sheriff and the
folks. But my triumph is dust and ashes into my mouth, when I think
of the way my folks has did me."</p>

<p>There warn't nothing for her to say; she was a Bear Creek woman.
She knowed how Bear Creek folks felt.</p>

<p>"This here night's work," I said bitterly, "has learnt me who my
friends is&mdash;and ain't. If it warn't for you these thieves
would be laughin' up their sleeves at me whilst I rotted in
jail."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't never go back on you when you was in trouble,
Breck," she says, and I says: "I know that now. I had you all
wrong."</p>

<p>We was nearing the town with our groaning caravan strung out
behind us, when through the trees ahead of us, we seen a blaze of
torches in the clearing around the jail, and men on hosses, and a
dark mass of humanity swaying back and forth. Glory pulled up.</p>

<p>"It's the mob, Breck!" says she, with a catch in her throat.
"They'll never listen to you. They're crazy mad like mobs always
is. They'll shoot you down before you can tell 'em anything.
Wait&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I waits for nothin'," I said bitterly. "I takes these coyotes
in and crams them down the mob's throat! I makes them cussed fools
listen to my exoneration. And then I shakes the dust of the
Humbolts offa my boots and heads for foreign parts. When a man's
kin lets him down, it's time for him to travel."</p>

<p><i>"Look there!"</i> exclaimed Glory.</p>

<p>We had come out of the trees, and we stopped short at the aidge
of the clearing, in the shadder of some oaks.</p>

<p>The mob was there, all right, with torches and guns and
ropes&mdash; backed up agen the jail with their faces as pale as
dough and their knees plumb knocking together. And facing 'em, on
hosses, with guns in their hands, I seen pap and every fighting man
on Bear Creek! Some of 'em had torches, and they shone on the faces
of more Elkinses, Garfields, Gordons, Kirbys, Grimeses, Buckners,
and Polks than them Chawed Ear misfits ever seen together at one
time. Some of them men hadn't never been that far away from Bear
Creek before in their lives. But they was all there now. Bear Creek
had sure come to Chawed Ear.</p>

<p>"Whar is he, you mangy coyotes?" roared pap, brandishing his
rifle. "What you done with him? I war a fool and a dog, desertin'
my own flesh and blood to you polecats! I don't care if he's a
thief or a liar, or what! A Bear Creek man ain't made to rot in a
blasted town-folks jail! I come after him and I aim to take him
back, alive or dead! And if you've kilt him, I aim to burn Chawed
Ear to the ground and kill every able-bodied man in her! <i>Whar is
he, damn yore souls?</i>"</p>

<p>"I swear we don't know!" panted the sheriff, pale and shaking.
"When I heard the mob was formin' I come as quick as I could, and
got here by the time they did, but all we found was the jail winder
tore out like you see, and three men layin' senseless here and
another'n out there in the thicket. They was the guards, but they
ain't come to yet to tell us what happened. We was jest startin' to
look for Elkins when you come, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't look no farther!" I roared, riding into the torch-light.
"Here I be!"</p>

<p>"Breckinridge!" says pap. "Whar you been? Who's that with
you?"</p>

<p>"Some gents which has got a few words to say to the assemblage,"
I says, drawing my string of captives into the light of the
torches. Everybody gaped at 'em, and I says: "I interjuices you to
Mister Jugbelly Judkins. He's the slickest word-slingin' sharp I
ever seen, so I reckon it oughta be him which does the spielin'. He
ain't got on his plug hat jest now, but he ain't gagged. Speak yore
piece, Jugbelly."</p>

<p>"Honest confession is good for the soul," says he. "Lemme have
the attention of the crowd, whilst I talks myself right into the
penitentiary." You could of heard a pin drop when he commenced.</p>

<p>"Donovan had brooded a long time about failin' to take Cap'n
Kidd away from Elkins," says he. "He laid his plans careful and
long to git even with Elkins without no risk to hisself. This was a
job which taken plenty of caution and preparation. He got a gang of
versatile performers together&mdash;the cream of the illegal crop,
if I do say so myself.</p>

<p>"Most of us kept hid in that cabin back up in the hills, from
which Elkins recently routed us. From there he worked out over the
whole country&mdash;Donovan, I mean. One mornin' he run into Elkins
at the Mustang Creek tavern. He overheard Elkins say he was broke,
also that he was goin' back to Bear Creek and was aimin' to return
to War Paint late that evenin'. All this, and Elkins' singed sculp,
give him a idee how to work what he'd been plannin'.</p>

<p>"He sent me to meet Elkins and git him drunk and keep him out in
the hills all night. Then I was to disappear, so Elkins couldn't
prove no alibi. Whilst we was drinkin' up there, Donovan went and
robbed the stage. He had his head shaved so's to make him look like
Elkins, of course, and he shot old Jim Harrigan jest to inflame the
citizens.</p>

<p>"Hurley and Jackson and Slade was his men. The gold Jackson had
on him really belonged to Donovan. Donovan, as soon as he'd robbed
the stage, he give the gold to Jalatin who lit out for the place
where me and Elkins was boozin'. Then Donovan beat it for the cabin
and hid the bay mare and put on his wig to hide his shaved head,
and got on another hoss, and started sa'ntering along the Cougar
Paw-Grizzly Run road&mdash;knowin' a posse would soon be headin'
for Bear Creek.</p>

<p>"Which it was, as soon as the stage got in. Hurley and Jackson
and Slade swore they'd knowed Elkins in Yavapai, and rekernized him
as the man which robbed the stage. Ashley and Harrigan warn't ready
to say for sure, but thought the robber looked like him. But you
Chawed Ear gents know about that&mdash;as soon as you heard about
the robbery you started buildin' yore special jail, and sent a
posse to Bear Creek, along with Ashley and them three fakes that
claimed to of rekernized Elkins. On the way you met Donovan, jest
like he planned, and he jined you.</p>

<p>"But meanwhile, all the time, me and Elkins was engaged in
alcoholic combat, till he passed out, long after midnight. Then I
taken the jugs and hid 'em, and pulled out for the cabin to hide
till I could sneak outa the country. Jalatin got there jest as I
was leavin', and he waited till Elkins sobered up the next mornin',
and told him a sob story about havin' a wife in poverty, and give
him the gold to give to her, and made him promise not to tell
nobody where he got it. Donovan knowed the big grizzly wouldn't
bust his word, if it was to save his neck even.</p>

<p>"Well, as you all know, the posse didn't find Elkins on Bear
Creek. So they started out lookin' for him, with his pap and some
of his uncles, and met him jest comin' out into the trail from the
place where me and him had our famous boozin' bout. Imejitly Slade,
Hurley and Jackson begun yellin' he was the man, and they was
backed by Ashley which is a honest man but really thought Elkins
was the robber, when he seen that nude skull. Donovan planned to
git Elkins shot while attemptin' to escape. And the rest is now
history&mdash;war- history, I might say."</p>

<p>"Well spoke, Jugbelly," I says, dumping Donovan off my hoss at
the sheriff's feet. "That's the story, and you-all air stuck with
it. My part of the game's done did, and I washes my hands of
it."</p>

<p>"We done you a big injestice, Elkins," says the sheriff. "But
how was we to know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Forget it," I says, and then pap rode up. Us Bear Creek folks
don't talk much, but we says plenty in a few words.</p>

<p>"I was wrong, Breckinridge," he says gruffly, and that said
more'n most folks could mean in a long-winded speech. "For the
first time in my life," he says, "I admits I made a mistake. But,"
says he, "the only fly in the 'intment is the fack that a Elkins
was drunk off'n his feet by a specimen like that!" And he p'inted a
accusing finger at Jugbelly Judkins.</p>

<p>"I alone have come through the adventure with credit," admitted
Jugbelly modestly. "A triumph of mind over muscle, my law-shootin'
friends!"</p>

<p>"Mind, hell!" says Jalatin viciously. "That coyote didn't drink
none of that licker! He was a sleight-of-hand performer in a
vaudeville show when Donovan picked him up. He had a rubber
stummick inside his shirt and he poured the licker into that. He
couldn't outdrink Breckinridge Elkins if he was a whole
corporation, the derned thief!"</p>

<p>"I admits the charge," sighed Jugbelly. "I bows my head in
shame."</p>

<p>"Well," I says, "I've saw worse men than you, at that, and if
they's anything I can do, you'll git off light, you derned
wind-bag, you!"</p>

<p>"Thank you, my generous friend," says he, and pap reined his
hoss around and said: "You comin' home, Breckinridge?"</p>

<p>"Go ahead," I said. "I'll come on with Glory."</p>

<p>So pap and the men of Bear Creek turnt and headed up the trail,
riding single file, with their rifles gleaming in the flare of the
torches, and nobody saying nothing, jest saddles creaking and hoofs
clinking softly, like Bear Creek men generally ride.</p>

<p>And as they went the citizens of Chawed Ear hove a loud sigh of
relief, and grabbed Donovan and his gang with enthusiasm and lugged
'em off to the jail&mdash;the one I hadn't busted, I mean.</p>

<p>"And that," said Glory, throwing her club away, "is that. You
ain't goin' off to foreign parts now, be you, Breckinridge?"</p>

<p>"Naw," I said. "My misguided relatives has redeemed
theirselves."</p>

<p>We stood there a minute looking at each other, and she said:
"You&mdash; you ain't got nothin' to say to me, Breckinridge?"</p>

<p>"Why, sure I has," I responded. "I'm mighty much obliged for
what you done."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" she ast, gritting her teeth slightly.</p>

<p>"What else you want me to say?" I ast, puzzled. "Ain't I jest
thanked you? They was a time when I would of said more, and likely
made you mad, Glory, but knowin' how you feel towards me,
I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;!" says Glory, and before I knowed what she was
up to, she grabbed up a rock the size of a watermelon and busted it
over my head. I was so tooken by surprise I stumbled backwards and
fell sprawling and as I looked up at her, a great light bust onto
me.</p>

<p>"She loves me!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I been wonderin' how long it was goin' to take you to find
out!" says she.</p>

<p>"But what made you treat me like you done?" I demanded
presently. "I thought you plumb hated me!"</p>

<p>"You ought to of knowed better," says she, snuggling in my arms.
"You made me mad that time you licked pap and them fool brothers of
mine. I didn't mean most of them things I said. But you got mad and
said some things which made me madder, and after that I was too
proud to act any way but like I done. I never loved nobody but you,
but I wouldn't admit it as long as you was at the top of the
ladder, struttin' around with money in yore pocket, and goin' with
purty gals, and everybody eager to be friends with you. I was
lovin' you then so's it nearly busted me, but I wouldn't let on. I
wouldn't humble myself to no blamed man! But you seen how quick I
come to you when you needed a friend, you big lunkhead!"</p>

<p>"Then I'm glad all this happened," I says. "It made me see
things straight. I never loved no other gal but you. I was jest
tryin' to forgit you and make you jealous when I was goin' with
them other gals. I thought I'd lost you, and was jest tryin' to git
the next best. I know that now, and I admits it. I never seen a gal
which could come within a hundred miles of you in looks and nerve
and everything."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you've come to yore senses, Breckinridge," says
she.</p>

<p>I swung up on Cap'n Kidd and lifted her up before me, and the
sky was jest getting pink and the birds was beginning to cut loose
as we started up the road towards Bear Creek.</p>
