<p style="text-indent:0">SOME day, maybe, when I'm old and gray in
the whiskers, I'll have sense enough not to stop when I'm riding by
Uncle Shadrach Polk's cabin, and Aunt Tascosa Polk hollers at me.
Take the last time, for instance. I ought to of spurred Cap'n Kidd
into a high run when she stuck her head out'n the winder and
yelled: "Breck-in-ridge! Oh, Breck-inri-ddd-gggge!"</p>

<p>But I reckon pap's right when he says Nater gimme so much muscle
she didn't have no room left for brains. Anyway, I reined Cap'n
Kidd around, ignoring his playful efforts to bite the muscle out of
my left thigh, and I rode up to the stoop and taken off my coonskin
cap. I said: "Well, Aunt Tascosa, how air you all?"</p>

<p>"You may well ast how air we," she said bitterly. "How should a
pore weak woman be farin' with a critter like Shadrach for a
husband? It's a wonder I got a roof over my head, or so much as a
barr'l of b'ar meat put up for the winter. The place is goin' to
rack and rooin. Look at that there busted axe-handle, for a
instance. Is a pore weak female like me got to endure sech
abuse?"</p>

<p>"You don't mean to tell me Uncle Shadrach's been beatin' you
with that axe-handle?" I says, scandalized.</p>

<p>"No," says this pore weak female. "I busted it over his head a
week ago, and he's refused to mend it. It's licker is been
Shadrach's rooin. When he's sober he's a passable figger of a man,
as men go. But swiggin' blue rooin is brung him to shame an'
degradation."</p>

<p>"He looks fat and sassy," I says.</p>

<p>"Beauty ain't only skin-deep," she scowls. "Shadrach's like Dead
Sea fruit&mdash;fair and fat-bellied to look on, but ready to
dissolve in dust and whiskey fumes when prodded. Do you know whar
he is right now?" And she glared at me so accusingly that Cap'n
Kidd recoiled and turned pale.</p>

<p>"Naw," says I. "Whar?"</p>

<p>"He's over to the Apache Mountain settlement a-lappin' up
licker," she snarled. "Just a-rootin' and a-wallerin' in sin and
corn juice, riskin' his immortal soul and blowin' in the money he
got off'n his coon hides. I had him locked in the corn crib, aimin'
to plead with him and appeal to his better nater, but whilst I was
out behind the corral cuttin' me a hickory club to do the appealin'
with, he kicked the door loose and skun out. I know whar he's
headin'&mdash;to Joel Garfield's stillhouse, which is a abomination
in the sight of the Lord and oughta be burnt to the ground and the
ashes skwenched with the blood of the wicked. But I cain't stand
here listenin' to yore gab. I got hominy to make. What you mean
wastin' my time like this for? I got a good mind to tell yore pap
on you. You light a shuck for Apache Mountain and bring Shadrach
home."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" I said.</p>

<p>"Don't you give me no argyments, you imperdent scoundrel!" she
hollered. "I should think you'd be glad to help a pore, weak female
critter 'stead of wastin' yore time gamblin' and fightin', in such
dens of iniquity as War Paint. I want you to fix some way so's to
disgust Shadrach with drink for the rest of his nateral life, and
if you don't you'll hear from me, you good-for- nothin'
&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right!" I yelled. "<i>All right!</i> Anything for a little
peace! I'll git him and bring him home, and make a teetotaler outa
him if I have to strangle the old son of a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How dast you use sech langwidge in front of me?" she hollered.
"Ain't you got no respect for a lady? I'll be #4%*@?-!'d if I know
what the &amp;%$@* world's comin' to! Git outa here and don't show
yore homely mug around here again onless you git Shadrach off of
rum for good!"</p>

<p>Well, if Uncle Shadrach ever took a swig of rum in his life it
was because they warn't no good red corn whiskey within reach, but
I didn't try to argy with Aunt Tascosa. I lit out down the trail
feeling like I'd been tied up to a Apache stake with the whole
tribe sticking red-hot Spanish daggers into my hide. Aunt Tascosa
affects a man that way. I heard Cap'n Kidd heave a sigh of relief
plumb up from his belly, too, as we crossed a ridge and her distant
voice was drowned out by the soothing noises of a couple of bobcats
fighting with a timber wolf. I thought what ca'm and happy lives
them simple critters lived, without no Aunt Tascosa.</p>

<p>I rode on, forgetting my own troubles in feeling sorry for pore
Uncle Shadrach. They warn't a mean bone in his carcass. He was just
as good-natered and hearty a critter as you'd ever meet even in the
Humbolts. But his main object in life seemed to be to stow away all
the corn juice they is in the world.</p>

<p>As I rode along I racked my brain for a plan to break Uncle
Shadrach of this here habit. I like a dram myself, but in
moderation, never more'n a gallon or so at a time, unless it's a
special occasion. I don't believe in a man making a hawg out of
hisself, and anyway I was sick and tired running Uncle Shadrach
down and fetching him home from his sprees.</p>

<p>I thought so much about it on my way to Apache Mountain that I
got so sleepy I seen I was gitting into no state to ride Cap'n
Kidd. He got to looking back at me now and then, and I knowed if he
seen me dozing in the saddle he'd try his derndest to break my
neck. I was passing Cousin Bill Gordon's barn about that time, so I
thought I'd go in and take me a nap up in the hayloft, and maybe
I'd dream about a way to make a water-drinker out of Uncle Shadrach
or something.</p>

<p>I tied Cap'n Kidd and started into the barn, and what should I
see but Bill's three youngest boys engaged in daubing paint on
Uncle Jeppard Grimes' favorite jackass, Joshua.</p>

<p>"What air you all a-doin' to Joshua?" I demanded, and they
jumped back and looked guilty. Joshua was a critter which Uncle
Jeppard used for a pack- mule when he went prospecting. He got the
urge maybe every three or four year, and between times Joshua just
et and slept. He was the sleepin'est jackass I ever seen. He was
snoozing now, whilst them young idjits was working on him.</p>

<p>I seen what they was at. Bill had loaned a feller some money
which had a store down to War Paint, and the feller went broke, and
give Bill a lot of stuff outa the store for pay. They was a lot of
paint amongst it. Bill packed it home, though I dunno what he aimed
to do with it, because all the houses in the Humbolts was log
cabins which nobody ever painted, or if they did, they just
white-washed 'em. But anyway, he had it all stored in his barn, and
his boys was smearing it on Joshua.</p>

<p>He was the derndest sight you ever seen. They'd painted a big
stripe down his spine, like a Spanish mustang, only this stripe was
green instead of black, and more stripes curving over his ribs and
down under his belly, red, white and blue, and they'd painted his
ears green.</p>

<p>"What you all mean by sech doin's?" I ast. "Uncle Jeppard'll
plumb skin you all alive. He sets a lot of store by that there
jack."</p>

<p>"Aw, it's just funnin'," they said. "He won't know who done
it."</p>

<p>"You go scrub that paint off," I ordered 'em. "Joshua'll lick it
off and git pizened."</p>

<p>"It won't hurt him," they assured me. "He got in here yesterday
and et three cans of paint and a bucket of whitewash. That's what
give us the idee. He kin eat anything. Eatin'est jack you ever
seen."</p>

<p>"Heh, heh, heh!" snickered one of 'em. "He looks like a
drunkard's dream!"</p>

<p>Instantly a idee hit me.</p>

<p>"Gimme that jackass!" I exclaimed. "He's just what I need to
kyore Uncle Shadrach Polk of drinkin' licker. One glimpse of that
there jack in his present state and Uncle Shadrach'll think he's
got the delerious trimmin's and git so scairt he'll swear off
whiskey for life."</p>

<p>"If you aims to lead Joshua to Joel's stillhouse," they said,
"you'll be all day gittin' there. You cain't hustle Joshua."</p>

<p>"I ain't goin to lead him," I said. "You all hitch a couple of
mules to yore pa's spring wagon. I'll leave Cap'n Kidd here till I
git back."</p>

<p>"We'll put him in the corral behind the barn," they says. "Them
posts are set four foot deep in concrete and the fence is braced
with railroad iron, so maybe it'll hold him till you git back, if
you ain't gone too long."</p>

<p>When they got the mules hitched, I tied Joshua's laigs and laid
him in the wagon bed, where he went to sleep, and I climbed onto
the seat and lit out for Apache Mountain. I hadn't went far when I
run over a rock and woke Joshua up and he started braying and kept
it up till I stopped and give him a ear of corn to chew on. As I
started off again I seen Dick Grimes' youngest gal peeping at me
from the bresh, and when I called to her she run off. I hoped she
hadn't heard Joshua braying. I knowed she couldn't see him, laying
down in the wagon bed, but he had a very pecooliar bray and anybody
in the Humbolts could recognize him by it. I hoped she didn't know
I had Joshua, because she was the derndest tattletale in the Bear
Creek country, and Uncle Jeppard is such a cross-grained old cuss
you can't explain nothing to him. He was born with the notion that
the whole world was plotting agen him.</p>

<p>It hadn't been much more'n good daylight when I rode past Uncle
Shadrach's house, and I'd pushed Cap'n Kidd purty brisk from there;
the mules made good time, so it warn't noon yet when I come to
Apache Mountain. As I approached the settlement, which was a number
of cabins strung up and down a breshy run, I swung wide of the
wagon-road and took to the trails, because I didn't want nobody to
see me with Joshua. It was kind of tough going, because the trails
was mostly footpaths and not wide enough for the wagon, and I had
to stop and pull up saplings every few yards. I was scairt the
noise would wake up Joshua and he'd start braying again, but that
jackass could sleep through a bombardment, long as he warn't being
jolted personal.</p>

<p>I was purty close to the settlement when I had to git out of the
wagon and go ahead and break down some bresh so the wheels wouldn't
foul, and when I laid hold of it, a couple of figgers jumped up on
the other side. One was Cousin Buckner Kirby's gal Kit, and
t'other'n was young Harry Braxton from the other side of the
mountain, and no kin to none of us.</p>

<p>"Oh!" says Kit, kind of breathless.</p>

<p>"What you all doin' out here?" I scowled, fixing Harry with a
eye which made him shiver and fuss with his gun-belt. "Air yore
intentions honorable, Braxton?"</p>

<p>"I dunno what business it is of yore'n," said Kit bitterly.</p>

<p>"I makes it mine," I assured her. "If this young buck cain't
come sparkin' you at a respectable place and hour, why, I
figgers&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yore remarks is ignorant and insultin'," says Harry, sweating
profusely, but game. "I aims to make this here young lady my wife,
if it warn't for the toughest prospective father-in-law ever
blighted young love's sweet dream with a number twelve boot in the
seat of the pants."</p>

<p>"To put it in words of one syllable so's even you can
understand, Breckinridge," says Kit, "Harry wants to marry me, but
pap is too derned mean and stubborn to let us. He don't like the
Braxtons account of one of 'em skun him in a hoss-swap thirty years
ago."</p>

<p>"I don't love 'em myself," I grunted. "But go on."</p>

<p>"Well," she says, "after pap had kicked Harry out of the house
five or six times, and dusted his britches with birdshot on another
occasion, we kind of got the idee that he was prejudiced agen
Harry. So we has to take this here method of seein' each
other."</p>

<p>"Whyn't you all run off and git married anyway?" I ast.</p>

<p>Kit shivered. "We wouldn't dare try it. Pap might wake up and
catch us, and he'd shoot Harry. I taken a big chance sneakin' out
here today. Ma and the kids are all over visitin' a few days with
Aunt Ouachita, but pap wouldn't let me go for fear I'd meet Harry
over there. I snuck out here for a few minutes&mdash;pap thinks I'm
gatherin' greens for dinner&mdash;but if I don't hustle back he'll
come lookin' for me with a hickory gad."</p>

<p>"Aw, shucks," I said. "You all got to use yore brains like I do.
You leave it to me. I'll git yore old man out of the way for the
night, and give you a chance to skip."</p>

<p>"How'll you do that?" Kit ast skeptically.</p>

<p>"Never mind," I told her, not having the slightest idee how I
was going to do it. "I'll 'tend to that. You git yore things ready,
and you, Harry, you come along the road in a buckboard just about
moonrise, and Kit'll be waitin' for you. You all can git hitched
over to War Paint. Buckner won't do nothin' after yo're
hitched."</p>

<p>"Will you, shore enough?" says Harry, brightening up.</p>

<p>"Shore I will," I assured him. "Vamoose now, and git that
buckboard."</p>

<p>He hustled off, and I said to Kit: "Git in the wagon and ride to
the settlement with me. This time tomorrer you'll be a happy
married woman shore enough."</p>

<p>"I hope so," she said sad-like. "But I'm bettin' somethin' will
go wrong and pap'll catch us, and I'll eat my meals off the
mantel-board for the next week."</p>

<p>"Trust me," I assured her, as I helped her in the wagon.</p>

<p>She didn't seem much surprised when she looked down in the bed
and seen Joshua all tied up and painted and snoring his head off.
Humbolt folks expects me to do onusual things.</p>

<p>"You needn't look like you thought I was crazy," I says
irritably. "That critter is for Uncle Shadrach Polk."</p>

<p>"If Uncle Shadrach sees that thing," says she, "he'll think he's
seein' worse'n snakes."</p>

<p>"That's what I aim for him to think," I says. "Who's he stayin'
with?"</p>

<p>"Us," says she.</p>

<p>"Hum!" I says. "That there complicates things a little. Whar-at
does he sleep?"</p>

<p>"Upstairs," she says.</p>

<p>"Well," I says, "he won't interfere with our elopement none. You
git outa here and go on home, and don't let yore pap suspect
nothin'."</p>

<p>"I'd be likely to, wouldn't I?" says she, and clumb down and
pulled out.</p>

<p>I'd stopped in a thicket at the aidge of the settlement, and I
could see the roof of Cousin Buckner's house from where I was. I
could also hear Cousin Buckner bellering: "Kit! Kit! Whar air you?
I know you ain't in the garden. If I have to come huntin' you, I
'low I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aw, keep yore britches on," I heard Kit call. "I'm
a-comin'!"</p>

<p>I heard Cousin Buckner subside into grumblings and rumblings
like a grizzly talking to hisself. I figgered he was out on the
road which run past his house, but I couldn't see him and neither
he couldn't see me, nor nobody could which might happen to be
passing along the road. I onhitched the mules and tied 'em where
they could graze and git water, and I h'isted Joshua outa the
wagon, and taken the ropes offa his laigs and tied him to a tree,
and fed him and the mules with some corn I'd brung from Cousin Bill
Gordon's. Then I went through the bresh till I come to Joel
Garfield's stillhouse, which was maybe half a mile from there, up
the run. I didn't meet nobody.</p>

<p>Joel was by hisself in the stillhouse, for a wonder, but he was
making up for lack of trade by his own personal attention to his
stock.</p>

<p>"Ain't Uncle Shadrach Polk nowhere around?" I ast, and Joel
lowered a jug of white corn long enough to answer me.</p>

<p>"Naw," he says, "he ain't right now. He's likely still sleepin'
off the souse he was on last night. He didn't leave here till after
midnight," says Joel, with another pull at the jug, "and he was
takin' all sides of the road to onst. He'll pull in about the
middle of the afternoon and start in to fillin' his hide so full he
can just barely stagger back to Buckner Kirby's house by midnight
or past. I bet he has a fine old time navigatin' them stairs
Buckner's got into his house. I'd be afeared to tackle 'em myself,
even when I was sober. A pole ladder is all I want to git into a
loft with, but Buckner always did have high-falutin' idees. Lately
he's been argyin' with Uncle Shadrach to cut down on his
drinkin'&mdash;specially when he's full hisself."</p>

<p>"Speakin' of Cousin Buckner," I says, "has he been around for
his regular dram yet?"</p>

<p>"Not yet," says Joel. "He'll be in right after dinner, as
usual."</p>

<p>"He wouldn't if he knowed what I knowed," I opined, because I'd
thought up a way to git Cousin Buckner out of the way that night.
"He'd be headin' for Wolf Canyon fast as he could spraddle. I just
met Harry Braxton with a pack- mule headin' for there."</p>

<p>"You don't mean somebody's made a strike in Wolf Canyon?" says
Joel, pricking up his ears.</p>

<p>"You never heard nothin' like it," I assured him. "Alder Gulch
warn't nothin' to this."</p>

<p>"Hum!" says Joel, absent-mindedly pouring hisself a quart-size
tin cup full of corn juice.</p>

<p>"I'm a Injun if it ain't!" I says, and dranken me a dram and
went back to lay in the bresh and watch the Kirby house. I was well
pleased with myself, because I knowed what a wolf Cousin Buckner
was after gold. If anything could draw him away from home and his
daughter, it would be news of a big strike. I was willing to bet my
six-shooters against a prickly pear that as soon as Joel told him
the news, he'd light out for Wolf Canyon. More especially as he'd
think Harry Braxton was going there, too, and no chance of him
sneaking off with Kit whilst the old man was gone.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>After a while I seen Cousin Buckner leave the house and go down
the road towards the stillhouse, and purty soon Uncle Shadrach
emerged and headed the same way. Purty well satisfied with myself,
I went back to where I left Cousin Bill's wagon, and fried me five
or six pounds of venison I'd brung along for provisions and et it,
and drunk at the creek, and then laid down and slept for a few
hours.</p>

<p>It was right at sundown when I woke up. I went on foot through
the bresh till I come out behind Buckner's cow-pen and seen Kit
milking. I ast her if anybody was in the house.</p>

<p>"Nobody but me," she said. "And I'm out here. I ain't seen
neither pap nor Uncle Shadrach since they left right after dinner.
Can it be yore scheme is actually workin' out?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," I says. "Uncle Shadrach'll be swillin' at Joel's
stillhouse till past midnight, and yore pap is ondoubtedly on his
way towards Wolf Canyon. You git through with yore chores, and git
ready to skip. Don't have no light in yore room, though. It's just
likely yore pap told off one of his relatives to lay in the bresh
and watch the house&mdash;him bein' of a suspicious nater. We don't
want to have no bloodshed. When I hear Harry's buckboard I'll come
for you. And if you hear any pecooliar noises before he gits here,
don't think nothin' of it. It'll just be me luggin' Joshua
upstairs."</p>

<p>"That critter'll bray fit to wake the dead," says she.</p>

<p>"He won't, neither," I said. "He'll go to sleep and keep his
mouth shet. Uncle Shadrach won't suspect nothin' till he lights him
a candle to go to bed by. Or if he's too drunk to light a candle,
and just falls down on the bed in the dark, he'll wake up durin'
the night some time to git him a drink of water. He's bound to see
Joshua some time between midnight and mornin'. All I hope is the
shock won't prove fatal. You go git ready to skip now."</p>

<p>I went back to the wagon and cooked me some more venison, also
about a dozen aigs Kit had give me along with some corn pone and a
gallon of buttermilk. I managed to make a light snack out of them
morsels, and then, as soon as it was good and dark, I hitched up
the mules and loaded Joshua into the wagon and went slow and easy
down the road. I stopped behind the corral and tied the mules.</p>

<p>The house was dark and still. I toted Joshua into the house and
carried him upstairs. I heard Kit moving around in her room, but
they warn't nobody else in the house.</p>

<p>Cousin Buckner had regular stairs in his house like what they
have in big towns like War Paint and the like. Most folks in the
Bear Creek country just has a ladder going up through a trap-door,
and some said they would be a jedgment onto Buckner account of him
indulging in such vain and sinful luxury, but I got to admit that
packing a jackass up a flight of stairs was a lot easier than what
it would have been to lug him up a ladder.</p>

<p>Joshua didn't bray nor kick none. He didn't care what was
happening to him so long as he didn't have to do no work personal.
I onfastened his laigs and tied a rope around his neck and t'other
end to the foot of Uncle Shadrach's bunk, and give him a hat I
found on a pag to chaw on till he went to sleep, which I knowed
he'd do pronto.</p>

<p>I then went downstairs and heard Kit fussing around in her room,
but it warn't time for Harry, so I went back out behind the corral
and sot down and leaned my back agen the fence, and I reckon I must
of gone to sleep. Just associating with Joshua give a man the
habit. First thing I knowed I heard a buckboard rumbling over a
bridge up the draw, and knowed it was Harry coming in fear and
trembling to claim his bride. The moon warn't up yet but they was a
glow above the trees on the eastern ridges.</p>

<p>I jumped up and ran quick and easy to Kit's winder&mdash;I can
move light as a cougar in spite of my size&mdash;and I said: "Kit,
air you ready?"</p>

<p>"I'm ready!" she whispered, all of a tremble. "Don't talk so
loud!"</p>

<p>"They ain't nothin' to be scairt of," I soothed her, but lowered
my voice just to humor her. "Yore pap is in Wolf Canyon by this
time. Ain't nobody in the house but us. I been watchin' out by the
corral."</p>

<p>Kit sniffed.</p>

<p>"Warn't that you I heard come into the house while ago?" she
ast.</p>

<p>"You been dreamin'," I said. "Come on! That's Harry's buckboard
comin' up the road."</p>

<p>"Lemme get just a few more things together!" she whispered,
fumbling around in the dark. That's just like a woman. No matter
how much time they has aforehand, they always has something to do
at the last minute.</p>

<p>I waited by the winder and Harry druv on past the house a few
rods and tied the hoss and come back, walking light and soft, and
plenty pale in the starlight.</p>

<p>"Go on out the front door and meet him," I told her. "No,
wait!"</p>

<p>Because all to onst Harry had ducked back out of the road, and
he jumped over the fence and come to the winder where I was. He was
shaking like a leaf.</p>

<p>"Somebody comin' up the road afoot!" he says.</p>

<p>"It's pap!" gasped Kit. Her and Harry was shore scairt of the
old man. They hadn't said a word above a whisper you could never of
heard three yards away, and I was kinda suiting my voice to
their'n.</p>

<p>"Aw, it cain't be!" I said. "He's in Wolf Canyon. That's Uncle
Shadrach comin' home to sleep off his drunk, but he's back a lot
earlier'n what I figgered he would be. He ain't important, but we
don't want no delay. Here, Kit, gimme that bag. Now lemme lift you
outa the winder. So! Now you all skin out. I'm goin' to climb this
here tree whar I can see the fun. Git!"</p>

<p>They crope out the side-gate of the yard just as Uncle Shadrach
come in at the front gate, and he never seen 'em because the house
was between 'em. They went so soft and easy I thought if Cousin
Buckner had been in the house he wouldn't of woke up. They was
hustling down the road towards the buckboard as Uncle Shadrach was
coming up on the porch and going into the hall. I could hear him
climbing the stair. I could of seen him if they'd been a light in
the house, because I could look into a winder in his room and one
in the downstairs hall, too, from the tree where I was setting.</p>

<p>He got into his room about the time the young folks reached
their buckboard, and I seen a light flare up as he struck a match.
They warn't no hall upstairs. The stairs run right up to the door
of his room. He stood in the doorway and lit a candle on a shelf by
the door. I could see Joshua standing by the bunk with his head
down, asleep, and I reckon the light must of woke him up, because
he throwed up his head and give a loud and ringing bray. Uncle
Shadrach turned and seen Joshua and he let out a shriek and fell
backwards downstairs.</p>

<p>The candle-light streamed down into the hall, and I got the
shock of my life. Because as Uncle Shadrach went pitching down them
steps, yelling bloody murder, they sounded a bull's roar below, and
out of the room at the foot of the stair come prancing a huge
figger waving a shotgun in one hand and pulling on his britches
with the other'n. It was Cousin Buckner which I thought was safe in
Wolf Canyon! That'd been him which Kit heard come in and go to bed
awhile before!</p>

<p>"What's goin' on here?" he roared. "What you doin',
Shadrach?"</p>

<p>"Git outa my way!" screamed Uncle Shadrach. "I just seen the
devil in the form of a zebray jackass! Lemme outa here!"</p>

<p>He busted out of the house, and jumped the fence and went up the
road like a quarter-hoss, and Cousin Buckner run out behind him.
The moon was just comin' up, and Kit and Harry was just starting
down the road. When she seen her old man irrupt from the house, Kit
screeched like a scairt catamount, and Buckner heard her. He
whirled and seen the buckboard rattling down the road and he knowed
what was happening. He give a beller and let <i>bam</i> at 'em with
his shotgun, but it was too long a range.</p>

<p>"Whar's my hoss?" he roared, and started for the corral. I
knowed if he got astraddle of that derned long-laigged bay gelding
of his'n, he'd ride them pore infants down before they'd went ten
miles. I jumped down out of the tree and yelled: "Hey, there,
Cousin Buckner! Hey, Buck&mdash;"</p>

<p>He whirled and shot the tail offa my coonskin cap before he seen
who it was.</p>

<p>"What you mean jumpin' down on me like that?" he roared. "What
you doin' up that tree? Whar you come from?"</p>

<p>"Never-mind that," I said. "You want to catch Harry Braxton
before he gits away with yore gal, don't you? Don't stop to saddle
a hoss. I got a light wagon hitched up behind the corral. We can
run 'em down easy in that."</p>

<p>"Let's go!" he roared, and in no time at all we was off, him
standing up in the bed and cussing and waving his shotgun.</p>

<p>"I'll have his sculp!" he roared. "I'll pickle his heart and
feed it to my houn' dawgs! Cain't you go no faster?"</p>

<p>Them dern mules was a lot faster than I'd thought. I didn't dare
hold 'em back for fear Buckner would git suspicious, and the first
thing I knowed we was overhauling the buckboard foot by foot.
Harry's critters warn't much account, and Cousin Bill Gordon's
mules was laying their bellies to the ground.</p>

<p>I dunno what Kit thought when she looked back and seen us
tearing after 'em, but Harry must of thought I was betraying 'em,
otherwise he wouldn't of opened up on me with his six-shooter. But
all he done was to knock some splinters out of the wagon and nick
my shoulder. The old man would of returned the fire with his
shotgun but he was scairt he might hit Kit, and both vehicles was
bounding and bouncing along too fast and furious for careful
aiming.</p>

<p>All to onst we come to a place where the road forked, and Kit
and Harry taken the right-hand turn. I taken the left.</p>

<p>"Are you crazy, you blame fool?" roared Cousin Buckner. "Turn
back and take the other road!"</p>

<p>"I cain't!" I responded. "These mules is runnin' away!"</p>

<p>"Yo're a liar!" howled Cousin Buckner. "Quit pourin' leather
into them mules, you blasted #$%&amp;@*, and turn back! Turn back,
cuss you!" With that he started hammering me in the head with the
stock of his shotgun.</p>

<p>We was thundering along a road which run along the rim of a
sloping bluff, and when Buckner's shotgun went off accidentally the
mules really did git scairt and started running away, just about
the time I reached back to take the shotgun away from Cousin
Buckner. Being beat in the head with the butt was getting awful
monotonous, because he'd been doing nothing else for the past half
mile.</p>

<p>I yanked the gun out of his hand and just then the left hind
wheel hit a stump and the hind end of the wagon went straight up in
the air and the pole splintered. The mules run right out of the
harness and me and the wagon and Cousin Buckner went over the bluff
and down the slope in a whirling tangle of wheels and laigs and
heads and profanity.</p>

<p>We brung up against a tree at the bottom, and I throwed the
rooins off of me and riz, swearing fervently when I seen how much
money I'd have to pay Cousin Bill Gordon for his wagon. But Cousin
Buckner give me no time for meditation. He'd ontangled hisself from
a hind wheel and was doing a war-dance in the moonlight and
frothing at the mouth.</p>

<p>"You done that on purpose!" he raged. "You never aimed to ketch
them wretches! You taken the wrong road on purpose! You turned us
over on purpose! Now I'll never ketch the scoundrel which run away
with my datter&mdash;the pore, dumb, trustin' #$%&amp;f!@*
innercent!"</p>

<p>"Be ca'm, Cousin Buckner," I advised. "He'll make her a good
husband. They're well onto their way to War Paint and a happy
married life. Best thing you can do is forgive 'em and give 'em
yore blessin'."</p>

<p>"Well," he snarled, "you ain't neither my datter nor my
son-in-law. Here's my blessin' to you!"</p>

<p>It was a pore return for all the trouble I'd taken for him to
push me into a cactus bed and hit me with a rock the size of a
watermelon. However, I taken into consideration that he was
overwrought and not hisself, so I ignored his incivility and made
no retort whatever, outside of splintering a wagon spoke over his
head.</p>

<p>I then clumb the bluff, making no reply to his impassioned and
profane comments, and looked around for the mules. They hadn't run
far. I seen 'em grazing down the road, and I started after 'em,
when I heard horses galloping back up the road toward the
settlement, and around a turn in the road come Uncle Jeppard Grimes
with his whiskers streaming in the moonlight, and nine or ten of
his boys riding hard behind him.</p>

<p>"Thar he is!" he howled, impulsively discharging his six-shooter
at me. "Thar's the fiend in human form! Thar's the kidnaper of
helpless jassacks! Boys, do yore duty!"</p>

<p>They pulled up around me and started piling off their horses
with blood in their eyes and weppins in their hands.</p>

<p>"Hold on!" I says. "If it's Joshua you fools are
after&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He admits the crime!" howled Uncle Jeppard. "Is it Joshua, says
you! You know dern well it is! We been combin' the hills for you,
ever since my gran'datter brought me the news! What you done with
him, you scoundrel?"</p>

<p>"Aw," I said, "he's all right. I was just goin' to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He evades the question!" screamed Uncle Jeppard. "Git him,
boys!"</p>

<p>"I tell you he's all right!" I roared, but they give me no
chance to explain. Them Grimeses is all alike; you cain't tell 'em
nothing. You got to knock it into their fool heads. They descended
on me with fence rails and rocks and wagon spokes and loaded quirts
and gun stocks in a way which would of tried the patience of a
saint. I always try to be as patient with my erring relatives as I
can be. I merely taken their weppins away from 'em and kind of
pushed 'em back away from me, and if they'd looked where they fell
Jim and Joe and Erath wouldn't of fell down that bluff and broke
their arms and laigs and Bill wouldn't of fractured his skull agen
that tree.</p>

<p>I handled 'em easy as babies, and kept my temper in spite of
Uncle Jeppard dancing around on his hoss and yelling: "Lay into
him, boys! Don't be scairt of the big grizzly! He cain't hurt us!"
and shooting at me every time he thought he could shoot without
hitting one of his own offspring. He did puncture two or three of
'em, and then blamed me for it, the old jackass.</p>

<p>Nobody could of acted with more restraint than I did when Dick
Grimes broke the blade of his bowie knife off on my hip bone, and
the seven fractured ribs I give his brother Jacob was a mild
retaliation for chawing my ear like he done. But it was a
ill-advised impulse which prompted Esau Grimes to stab me in the
seat of the britches with a pitchfork. There ain't nothing which
sours the milk of human kindness in a man's veins any more'n
getting pitchforked by a raging relative behind his back.</p>

<p>I give a beller which shook the acorns out of the oaks all up
and down the run, and whirled on Esau so quick it jerked the
pitchfork out of his hands and left it sticking in my hide. I
retched back and pulled it out and wrapped the handle around Esau's
neck, and then I taken him by the ankles and started remodeling the
landscape with him. I mowed down a sapling thicket with him, and
leveled a cactus bed with him, and swept the road with him, and
when his brothers tried to rescue him, I beat 'em over the head
with him till they was too groggy to do anything but run in
circles.</p>

<p>Uncle Jeppard come spurring at me, trying to knock me down with
his hoss and trample me, and Esau was so limp by this time he
warn't much good for a club no more, so I whirled him around my
head a few times and throwed him at Uncle Jeppard. Him and Uncle
Jeppard and the hoss all went down in a heap together, and from the
way Uncle Jeppard hollered you'd of thought somebody was trying to
injure him. It was plumb disgusting.</p>

<p>Five or six of his boys recovered enough to surge onto me then,
and I knocked 'em all down on top of him and Esau and the hoss, and
the hoss was trying to git up, and kicking around right and left,
and his hoofs was going <i>bam, bam, bam</i> on human heads, and
Uncle Jeppard was hollering so loud I got to thinking maybe he was
hurt or something. So I retched down in the heap and got him by the
whiskers and pulled him out from under the hoss and four or five of
his fool boys.</p>

<p>"Air you hurt, Uncle Jeppard?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"#$%&amp;@*!" responded Uncle Jeppard, rewarding my solicitude
by trying to stab me with his bowie knife. This ingratitude
irritated me, and I tossed him from me fretfully, and as he was
pulling hisself out of the prickley pear bed where he landed, he
suddenly give a louder scream than ever. Something come ambling up
the road and I seen it was that fool jackass Joshua, which had
evidently et his rope and left the house looking for more grub. He
looked like a four-laigged nightmare in the moonlight, but all
Uncle Jeppard noticed was the red paint on him.</p>

<p>"Halp! Murder!" howled Uncle Jeppard. "They've wounded him
mortally! He's bleedin' to death! Git a tourniquet, quick!"</p>

<p>With that they all deserted the fray, them which was able to
hobble, and run to grab Joshua and stanch his bleeding. But when he
seen all them Grimeses coming for him, Joshua got scairt and took
out through the bresh. They all pelted after him, and the last
thing I heard as they passed out of hearing was Uncle Jeppard
wailing: "Joshua! Stop, dern it! This here's yore friends! Pull up,
dang you! We wants to help you, you cussed fool!"</p>

<p>I turned to see what I could do for the casualties which lay
groaning in the road and at the foot of the bluff, but they said
unanamous they didn't want no help from a enemy&mdash;which they
meant me. They one and all promised to pickle my heart and eat it
as soon as they was able to git about on crutches, so I abandoned
my efforts and headed for the settlement.</p>

<p>The fighting had scairt the mules up the road a ways, but I
catched 'em and made a hackamore outa one of my galluses, and rode
one and led t'other'n, and lit out straight through the bresh for
Bear Creek. I'd had a belly-full of Apache Mountain. But I swung
past Joel's stillhouse to find out how come Cousin Buckner didn't
go to Wolf Canyon. When I got there the stillhouse was dark and the
door was shet, and they was a note on the door. I could read a
little by then, and I spelt it out. It said:</p>

<p class="letter">Gone to Wolf Canyon.&mdash;Joel Garfield.</p>

<p>That selfish polecat hadn't told Cousin Buckner nor nobody about
the strike. He'd got hisself a pack-mule and lit out for Wolf
Canyon hisself. A hell of a relative he was, maybe doing pore
Cousin Buckner out of a fortune, for all he knowed.</p>

<p>A mile from the settlement I met Jack Gordon coming from a dance
on t'other side of the mountain, and he said he seen Uncle Shadrach
Polk fogging down the trail on a mule he was riding bare-back
without no bridle, so I thought well, anyway my scheme for scairing
him out of a taste for licker worked. Jack said Uncle Shadrach
looked like he'd saw a herd of ha'nts.</p>

<p>It was about daylight when I stopped at Bill Gordon's ranch to
leave him his mules. I paid him for his wagon and also for the
damage Cap'n Kidd had did to his corral. Bill had to build a new
one, and Cap'n Kidd had also run his prize stallion offa the ranch,
an chawed the ears off of a longhorn bull, and busted into the barn
and gobbled up about ten dollars worth of oats. When I lit out for
Bear Creek again I warn't feeling in no benevolent mood, but,
thinks I, it's worth it if it's made a water-swigger outa Uncle
Shadrach.</p>

<p><br>
It was well along toward noon when I pulled up at the door and
called for Aunt Tascosa. Jedge my scandalized amazement when I was
greeted by a deluge of b'iling water from the winder and Aunt
Tascosa stuck her head out and says: "You buzzard in the form of a
human bein'! How you got the brass to come bulgin' around here? If
I warn't a lady I'd tell you just what I thought of you, you
$#*&amp;?@! Git, before I opens up on you with this here
shotgun!"</p>

<p>"Why, Aunt Tascosa, what you talkin' about?" I ast, combing the
hot water outa my hair with my fingers.</p>

<p>"You got the nerve to ast!" she sneered. "Didn't you promise me
you'd kyore Shadrach of drinkin' rum? Didn't you, hey? Well, come
in here and look at him! He arriv home about daylight on one of
Buckner Kirby's mules and it about ready to drop, and he's been
rasslin' every since with a jug he had hid. I cain't git no sense
out'n him."</p>

<p>I went in and Uncle Shadrach was setting by the back door and he
had hold of that there jug like a drownding man clutching a
straw-stack.</p>

<p>"I'm surprized at you, Uncle Shadrach," I said. "What in
the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shet the door, Breckinridge," he says. "They is more devils
onto the earth than is dreamed of in our philosophy. I've had a
narrer escape, Breckinridge! I let myself be beguiled by the
argyments of Buckner Kirby, a son of Baliol which is without
understandin'. He's been rasslin' with me to give up licker. Well,
yesterday I got so tired of his argyments I said I'd try it a
while, just to have some peace. I never taken a drink all day
yesterday, and Breckinridge, I give you my word when I started to
go to bed last night I seen a red, white and blue jackass with
green ears standin' at the foot of my bunk, just as plain as I sees
you now! It war the water that done it, Breckinridge," he says,
curling his fist lovingly around the handle of the jug. "Water's a
snare and a delusion. I drunk water all day yesterday, and look
what it done to me! I don't never want to see no water no more,
again."</p>

<p>"Well," I says, losing all patience, "you're a-goin' to, by
golly, if I can heave you from here to that hoss-trough in the
backyard."</p>

<p>I done it, and that's how come the rumor got started that I
tried to drown Uncle Shadrach Polk in a hoss-trough because he
refused to swear off licker. Aunt Tascosa was responsible for that
there slander, which was a pore way to repay me for all I'd did for
her. But people ain't got no gratitude.</p>
