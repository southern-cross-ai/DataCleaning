  <p style="text-indent:0">PAP dug the nineteenth buckshot out of my shoulder
  and said, "Pigs is more disturbin' to the peace of a community than scandal,
  divorce, and corn licker put together. And," says pap, pausing to strop his
  bowie on my scalp where the hair was all burnt off, "when the pig is a
  razorback hawg, and is mixed up with a lady schoolteacher, a English
  tenderfoot, and a passle of bloodthirsty relatives, the result is appallin'
  for a peaceable man to behold. Hold still till John gits yore ear sewed back
  on."</p>

  <p>Pap was right. I warn't to blame for what happened. Breaking Joel Gordon's
  laig was a mistake, and Erath Elkins is a liar when he says I caved in them
  five ribs of his'n plumb on purpose. If Uncle Jeppard Grimes had been tending
  to his own business he wouldn't have got the seat of his britches filled with
  bird-shot, and I don't figger it was my fault that cousin Bill Kirby's cabin
  got burned down. And I don't take no blame for Jim Gordon's ear which Jack
  Grimes shot off, neither. I figger everybody was more to blame than I was,
  and I stand ready to wipe up the earth with anybody which disagrees with
  me.</p>

  <p>But it was that derned razorback hawg of Uncle Jeppard Grimes' which
  started the whole mess.</p>

  <p>It begun when that there tenderfoot come riding up the trail with Tunk
  Willoughby, from War Paint. Tunk ain't got no more sense than the law allows,
  but he shore showed good jedgement that time, because having delivered his
  charge to his destination, he didn't tarry. He merely handed me a note, and
  p'inted dumbly at the tenderfoot, whilst holding his hat reverently in his
  hand meanwhile.</p>

  <p>"What you mean by that there gesture?" I ast him rather irritably, and he
  said: "I doffs my sombrero in respect to the departed. Bringin' a specimen
  like that onto Bear Creek is just like heavin' a jackrabbit to a pack of
  starvin' loboes."</p>

  <p>He hove a sigh and shook his head, and put his hat back on. "Rassle a cat
  in pieces," he says, gathering up the reins.</p>

  <p>"What the hell are you talkin' about?" I demanded.</p>

  <p>"That's Latin," he said. "It means rest in peace."</p>

  <p>And with that he dusted it down the trail and left me alone with the
  tenderfoot which all the time was setting his cayuse and looking at me like I
  was a curiosity or something.</p>

  <p>I called my sister Ouachita to come read that there note for me, which she
  did and it run as follows:</p>

  <p class="letter">Dere Breckinridge:<br>
  This will interjuice Mr. J. Pembroke Pemberton a English sportsman which I
  met in Frisco recent. He was disapinted because he hadn't found no adventures
  in America and was fixin to go to Aferker to shoot liuns and elerfants but I
  perswaded him to come with me because I knowed he would find more hell on
  Bear Creek in a week than he would find in a yere in Aferker or any other
  place. But the very day we hit War Paint I run into a old ackwaintance from
  Texas I will not speak no harm of the ded but I wish the son of a buzzard had
  shot me somewheres besides in my left laig which already had three slugs in
  it which I never could get cut out. Anyway I am lade up and not able to come
  on to Bear Creek with J. Pembroke Pemberton. I am dependin on you to show him
  some good bear huntin and other excitement and pertect him from yore
  relatives I know what a awful responsibility I am puttin on you but I am
  askin' this as yore frend.<br>
  &mdash;William Harrison Glanton. Esqy.</p>

  <p>I looked J. Pembroke over. He was a medium sized young feller and looked
  kinda soft in spots. He had yaller hair and very pink cheeks like a gal; and
  he had on whip-cord britches and tan riding boots which was the first I ever
  seen. And he had on a funny kinda coat with pockets and a belt which he
  called a shooting jacket, and a big hat like a mushroom made outa cork with a
  red ribbon around it. And he had a pack-horse loaded with all kinds of
  plunder, and four or five different kinds of shotguns and rifles.</p>

  <p>"So yo're J. Pembroke," I says, and he says, "Oh, rahther! And you, no
  doubt, are the person Mr. Glanton described to me, Breckinridge Elkins?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah," I said. "Light and come in. We got b'ar meat and honey for
  supper."</p>

  <p>"I say," he said, climbing down. "Pardon me for being a bit personal, old
  chap, but may I ask if your&mdash;ah&mdash;magnitude of bodily stature is not
  a bit unique?"</p>

  <p>"I dunno," I says, not having the slightest idee what he was talking
  about. "I always votes a straight Democratic ticket, myself."</p>

  <p>He started to say something else, but just then pap and my brothers John
  and Bill and Jim and Buckner and Garfield come to the door to see what the
  noise was about, and he turned pale and said faintly: "I beg your pardon;
  giants seem to be the rule in these parts."</p>

  <p>"Pap says men ain't what they was when he was in his prime," I said, "but
  we manage to git by."</p>

  <p>Well, J. Pembroke laid into them b'ar steaks with a hearty will, and when
  I told him we'd go after b'ar next day, he ast me how many days travel it'd
  take till we got to the b'ar country.</p>

  <p>"Heck!" I said. "You don't have to travel to git b'ar in these parts. If
  you forgit to bolt yore door at night yo're liable to find a grizzly sharin'
  yore bunk before mornin'. This here'n we're eatin' was ketched by my sister
  Ellen there whilst tryin' to rob the pig-pen out behind the cabin last
  night."</p>

  <p>"My word!" he says, looking at her peculiarly. "And may I ask, Miss
  Elkins, what caliber of firearm you used?"</p>

  <p>"I knocked him in the head with a wagon tongue," she said, and he shook
  his head to hisself and muttered: "Extraordinary!"</p>

  <p>J. Pembroke slept in my bunk and I took the floor that night; and we was
  up at daylight and ready to start after the b'ar. Whilst J. Pembroke was
  fussing over his guns, pap come out and pulled his whiskers and shook his
  head and said: "That there is a perlite young man, but I'm afeared he ain't
  as hale as he oughta be. I just give him a pull at my jug, and he didn't gulp
  but one good snort and like to choked to death."</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, buckling the cinches on Cap'n Kidd, "I've done learnt not
  to jedge outsiders by the way they takes their licker on Bear Creek. It takes
  a Bear Creek man to swig Bear Creek corn juice."</p>

  <p>"I hopes for the best," sighed pap. "But it's a dismal sight to see a
  young man which cain't stand up to his licker. Whar you takin' him?"</p>

  <p>"Over toward Apache Mountain," I said. "Erath seen a exter big grizzly
  over there day before yesterday."</p>

  <p>"Hmmmm!" says pap. "By pecooliar coincidence the schoolhouse is over on
  the side of Apache Mountain, ain't it, Breckinridge?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe it is and maybe it ain't," I replied with dignerty, and rode off
  with J. Pembroke ignoring pap's sourcastic comment which he hollered after
  me: "Maybe they is a connection between book-larnin' and b'ar-huntin', but
  who am I to say?"</p>

  <p>J. Pembroke was a purty good rider, but he used a funny looking saddle
  without no horn nor cantle, and he had the derndest gun I ever seen. It was a
  double-barrel rifle, and he said it was a elerfant-gun. It was big enough to
  knock a hill down. He was surprised I didn't tote no rifle and ast me what
  would I do if we met a b'ar. I told him I was depending on him to shoot it,
  but I said if it was necessary for me to go into action, my six-shooter was
  plenty.</p>

  <p>"My word!" says he. "You mean to say you can bring down a grizzly with a
  shot from a pistol?"</p>

  <p>"Not always," I said. "Sometimes I have to bust him over the head with the
  butt to finish him."</p>

  <p>He didn't say nothing for a long time after that.</p>

  <p>Well, we rode over on the lower slopes of Apache Mountain, and tied the
  horses in a holler and went through the bresh on foot. That was a good place
  for b'ars, because they come there very frequently looking for Uncle Jeppard
  Grimes' pigs which runs loose all over the lower slopes of the mountain.</p>

  <p>But just like it always is when yo're looking for something, we didn't see
  a cussed b'ar.</p>

  <p>The middle of the evening found us around on the south side of the
  mountain where they is a settlement of Kirbys and Grimeses and Gordons. Half
  a dozen families has their cabins within a mile of each other, and I dunno
  what in hell they want to crowd up together that way for, it would plumb
  smother me, but pap says they was always peculiar that way.</p>

  <p>We warn't in sight of the settlement, but the schoolhouse warn't far off,
  and I said to J. Pembroke: "You wait here a while and maybe a b'ar will come
  by. Miss Margaret Ashley is teachin' me how to read and write, and it's time
  for my lesson."</p>

  <p>I left J. Pembroke setting on a log hugging his elerfant-gun, and I strode
  through the bresh and come out at the upper end of the run which the
  settlement was at the other'n, and school had just turned out and the
  chillern was going home, and Miss Ashley was waiting for me in the log
  schoolhouse.</p>

  <p>That was the first school that was ever taught on Bear Creek, and she was
  the first teacher. Some of the folks was awful sot agen it at first, and said
  no good would come of book larning, but after I licked six or seven of them
  they allowed it might be a good thing after all, and agreed to let her take a
  whack at it.</p>

  <p>Miss Margaret was a awful purty gal and come from somewhere away back
  East. She was setting at her hand-made desk as I come in, ducking my head so
  as not to bump it agen the top of the door and perlitely taking off my
  coonskin cap. She looked kinda tired and discouraged, and I said: "Has the
  young'uns been raisin' any hell today, Miss Margaret?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," she said. "They're very polite&mdash;in fact I've noticed that
  Bear Creek people are always polite except when they're killing each other.
  I've finally gotten used to the boys wearing their bowie knives and pistols
  to school. But somehow it seems so futile. This is all so terribly different
  from everything to which I've always been accustomed. I get discouraged and
  feel like giving up."</p>

  <p>"You'll git used to it," I consoled her. "It'll be a lot different once
  yo're married to some honest reliable young man."</p>

  <p>She give me a startled look and said: "Married to someone here on Bear
  Creek?"</p>

  <p>"Shore," I said, involuntarily expanding my chest under my buckskin shirt.
  "Everybody is just wonderin' when you'll set the date. But le's git at the
  lesson. I done learnt the words you writ out for me yesterday."</p>

  <p>But she warn't listening, and she said: "Do you have any idea of why Mr.
  Joel Grimes and Mr. Esau Gordon quit calling on me? Until a few days ago one
  or the other was at Mr. Kirby's cabin where I board almost every night."</p>

  <p>"Now don't you worry none about them," I soothed her. "Joel'll be about on
  crutches before the week's out, and Esau can already walk without bein'
  helped. I always handles my relatives as easy as possible."</p>

  <p>"You fought with them?" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I just convinced 'em you didn't want to be bothered with 'em," I
  reassured her. "I'm easy-goin', but I don't like competition."</p>

  <p>"Competition!" Her eyes flared wide open and she looked at me like she
  never seen me before. "Do you mean, that you&mdash;that I&mdash;
  that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well," I said modestly, "everybody on Bear Creek is just wonderin' when
  you're goin' to set the day for us to git hitched. You see gals don't stay
  single very long in these parts, and&mdash;hey, what's the matter?"</p>

  <p>Because she was getting paler and paler like she'd et something which
  didn't agree with her.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," she said faintly. "You&mdash;you mean people are expecting me
  to marry you?"</p>

  <p>"Shore," I said.</p>

  <p>She muttered something that sounded like "My God!" and licked her lips
  with her tongue and looked at me like she was about ready to faint. Well, it
  ain't every gal which has a chance to get hitched to Breckinridge Elkins, so
  I didn't blame her for being excited.</p>

  <p>"You've been very kind to me, Breckinridge," she said feebly. "But I
  &mdash;this is so sudden&mdash;so unexpected&mdash;I never thought&mdash; I
  never <i>dreamed&mdash;"</i></p>

  <p>"I don't want to rush you," I said. "Take yore time. Next week will be
  soon enough. Anyway, I got to build us a cabin, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p><i>Bang!</i> went a gun, too loud for a Winchester.</p>

  <p>"Elkins!" It was J. Pembroke yelling for me up the slope. "Elkins!
  Hurry!"</p>

  <p>"Who's that?" she exclaimed, jumping to her feet like she was working on a
  spring.</p>

  <p>"Aw," I said in disgust, "it's a fool tenderfoot Bill Glanton wished on
  me. I reckon a b'ar is got him by the neck. I'll go see."</p>

  <p>"I'll go with you!" she said, but from the way Pembroke was yelling I
  figgered I better not waste no time getting to him, so I couldn't wait for
  her, and she was some piece behind me when I mounted the lap of the slope and
  met him running out from amongst the trees. He was gibbering with
  excitement.</p>

  <p>"I winged it!" he squawked. "I'm sure I winged the blighter! But it ran in
  among the underbrush and I dared not follow it, for the beast is most vicious
  when wounded. A friend of mine once wounded one in South Africa,
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A b'ar?" I ast.</p>

  <p>"No, no!" he said. "A wild boar! The most vicious brute I have ever seen!
  It ran into that brush there!"</p>

  <p>"Aw, they ain't no wild boars in the Humbolts," I snorted. "You wait here.
  I'll go see just what you did shoot."</p>

  <p>I seen some splashes of blood on the grass, so I knowed he'd shot
  <i>something.</i> Well, I hadn't gone more'n a few hunderd feet and was just
  out of sight of J. Pembroke when I run into Uncle Jeppard Grimes.</p>

  <p>Uncle Jeppard was one of the first white men to come into the Humbolts.
  He's as lean and hard as a pine-knot, and wears fringed buckskins and
  moccasins just like he done fifty years ago. He had a bowie knife in one hand
  and he waved something in the other'n like a flag of revolt, and he was
  frothing at the mouth.</p>

  <p>"The derned murderer!" he howled. "You see this? That's the tail of Daniel
  Webster, the finest derned razorback boar which ever trod the Humbolts! That
  danged tenderfoot of your'n tried to kill him! Shot his tail off, right spang
  up to the hilt! He cain't muterlate my animals like this! I'll have his
  heart's blood!"</p>

  <p>And he done a war-dance waving that pig-tail and his bowie and cussing in
  English and Spanish and Apache Injun an at once.</p>

  <p>"You ca'm down, Uncle Jeppard," I said sternly. "He ain't got no sense,
  and he thought Daniel Webster was a wild boar like they have in Aferker and
  England and them foreign places. He didn't mean no harm."</p>

  <p>"No harm!" said Uncle Jeppard fiercely. "And Daniel Webster with no more
  tail onto him than a jackrabbit!"</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, "here's a five dollar gold piece to pay for the dern
  hawg's tail, and you let J. Pembroke alone."</p>

  <p>"Gold cain't satisfy honor," he said bitterly, but nevertheless grabbing
  the coin like a starving man grabbing a beefsteak. "I'll let this outrage
  pass for the time. But I'll be watchin' that maneyack to see that he don't
  muterlate no more of my prize razorbacks."</p>

  <p>And so saying he went off muttering in his beard.</p>

  <p>I went back to where I left J. Pembroke, and there he was talking to Miss
  Margaret which had just come up. She had more color in her face than I'd saw
  recent.</p>

  <p>"Fancy meeting a girl like you here!" J. Pembroke was saying.</p>

  <p>"No more surprizing than meeting a man like you!" says she with a kind of
  fluttery laugh.</p>

  <p>"Oh, a sportsman wanders into all sorts of out-of-the-way places," says
  he, and seeing they hadn't noticed me coming up, I says: "Well, J. Pembroke,
  I didn't find yore wild boar, but I met the owner."</p>

  <p>He looked at me kinda blank, and said vaguely: "Wild boar? <i>What</i>wild
  boar?"</p>

  <p>"That-un you shot the tail off of with that there fool elerfant gun," I
  said. "Listen: next time you see a hawg-critter you remember there ain't no
  wild boars in the Humbolts. They is critters called haverleeners in South
  Texas, but they ain't even none of them in Nevada. So next time you see a
  hawg, just reflect that it's merely one of Uncle Jeppard Grimes' razorbacks
  and refrain from shootin' at it."</p>

  <p>"Oh, quite!" he agreed absently, and started talking to Miss Margaret
  again.</p>

  <p>So I picked up the elerfant gun which he'd absent-mindedly laid down, and
  said: "Well, it's gittin' late. Let's go. We won't go back to pap's cabin
  tonight, J. Pembroke. We'll stay at Uncle Saul Garfield's cabin on t'other
  side of the Apache Mountain settlement."</p>

  <p>As I said, them cabins was awful close together. Uncle Saul's cabin was
  below the settlement, but it warn't much over three hundred yards from cousin
  Bill Kirby's cabin where Miss Margaret boarded. The other cabins was on
  t'other side of Bill's, mostly, strung out up the run, and up and down the
  slopes.</p>

  <p>I told J. Pembroke and Miss Margaret to walk on down to the settlement
  whilst I went back and got the horses.</p>

  <p>They'd got to the settlement time I catched up with 'em, and Miss Margaret
  had gone into the Kirby cabin, and I seen a light spring up in her room. She
  had one of them new-fangled ile lamps she brung with her, the only one on
  Bear Creek. Candles and pine chunks was good enough for us folks. And she'd
  hanged rag things over the winders which she called curtains. You never seen
  nothing like it, I tell you she was that elegant you wouldn't believe it.</p>

  <p>We walked on toward Uncle Saul's, me leading the horses, and after a while
  J. Pembroke says: "A wonderful creature!"</p>

  <p>"You mean Daniel Webster?" I ast.</p>

  <p>"No!" he said. "No, no, I mean Miss Ashley."</p>

  <p>"She shore is," I said. "She'll make me a fine wife."</p>

  <p>He whirled like I'd stabbed him and his face looked pale in the dusk.</p>

  <p>"You?" he said, <i>"You</i> a wife?"</p>

  <p>"Well," I said bashfully, "she ain't sot the day yet, but I've shore sot
  my heart on that gal."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" he says, <i>"Oh!"</i> says he, like he had the toothache. Then he
  said kinda hesitatingly: "Suppose&mdash;er, just suppose, you know! Suppose a
  rival for her affections should appear? What would you do?"</p>

  <p>"You mean if some dirty, low-down son of a mangy skunk was to try to steal
  my gal?" I said, whirling so sudden he staggered backwards.</p>

  <p><i>"Steal my gal?"</i> I roared, seeing red at the mere thought. "Why,
  I'd&mdash;I'd&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Words failing me I wheeled and grabbed a good-sized sapling and tore it up
  by the roots and broke it acrost my knee and throwed the pieces clean through
  a rail fence on the other side of the road.</p>

  <p>"That there is a faint idee!" I said, panting with passion.</p>

  <p>"That gives me a very good conception," he said faintly, and he said
  nothing more till we reached the cabin and seen Uncle Saul Garfield standing
  in the light of the door combing his black beard with his fingers.</p>

  <p>Next morning J. Pembroke seemed like he'd kinda lost interest in b'ars. He
  said all that walking he done over the slopes of Apache Mountain had made his
  laig muscles sore. I never heard of such a thing, but nothing that gets the
  matter with these tenderfeet surprizes me much, they is such a effemernate
  race, so I ast him would he like to go fishing down the run and he said all
  right.</p>

  <p>But we hadn't been fishing more'n a hour when he said he believed he'd go
  back to Uncle Saul's cabin and take him a nap, and he insisted on going
  alone, so I stayed where I was and ketched me a nice string of trout.</p>

  <p>I went back to the cabin about noon, and ast Uncle Saul if J. Pembroke had
  got his nap out.</p>

  <p>"Why, heck," said Uncle Saul. "I ain't seen him since you and him started
  down the run this mornin'. Wait a minute&mdash;yonder he comes from the other
  direction."</p>

  <p>Well, J. Pembroke didn't say where he'd been all morning, and I didn't ast
  him, because a tenderfoot don't generally have no reason for anything he
  does.</p>

  <p>We et the trout I ketched, and after dinner he perked up a right smart and
  got his shotgun and said he'd like to hunt some wild turkeys. I never heard
  of anybody hunting anything as big as a turkey with a shotgun, but I didn't
  say nothing, because tenderfeet is like that.</p>

  <p>So we headed up the slopes of Apache Mountain, and I stopped by the
  schoolhouse to tell Miss Margaret I probably wouldn't get back in time to
  take my reading and writing lesson, and she said: "You know, until I met your
  friend, Mr. Pembroke, I didn't realize what a difference there was between
  men like him, and&mdash;well, like the men on Bear Creek."</p>

  <p>"I know," I said. "But don't hold it agen him. He means well. He just
  ain't got no sense. Everybody cain't be smart like me. As a special favor to
  me, Miss Margaret, I'd like for you to be exter nice to the poor sap, because
  he's a friend of my friend Bill Glanton down to War Paint."</p>

  <p>"I will, Breckinridge," she replied heartily, and I thanked her and went
  away with my big manly heart pounding in my gigantic bosom.</p>

  <p>Me and J. Pembroke headed into the heavy timber, and we hadn't went far
  till I was convinced that somebody was follering us. I kept hearing twigs
  snapping, and oncet I thought I seen a shadowy figger duck behind a bush. But
  when I run back there, it was gone, and no track to show in the pine needles.
  That sort of thing would of made me nervous, anywhere else, because they is a
  awful lot of people which would like to get a clean shot at my back from the
  bresh, but I knowed none of them dast come after me in my own territory. If
  anybody was trailing us it was bound to be one of my relatives and to save my
  neck I couldn't think of no reason why anyone of 'em would be gunning for
  me.</p>

  <p>But I got tired of it, and left J. Pembroke in a small glade while I snuck
  back to do some shaddering of my own. I aimed to cast a big circle around the
  opening and see could I find out who it was, but I'd hardly got out of sight
  of J. Pembroke when I heard a gun bang.</p>

  <p>I turned to run back and here come J. Pembroke yelling: "I got him! I got
  him! I winged the bally aborigine!"</p>

  <p>He had his head down as he busted through the bresh and he run into me in
  his excitement and hit me in the belly with his head so hard he bounced back
  like a rubber ball and landed in a bush with his riding boots brandishing
  wildly in the air.</p>

  <p>"Assist me, Breckinridge!" he shrieked. "Extricate me! They will be hot on
  our trail!"</p>

  <p>"Who?" I demanded, hauling him out by the hind laig and setting him on his
  feet.</p>

  <p>"The Indians!" he hollered, jumping up and down and waving his smoking
  shotgun frantically. "The bally redskins! I shot one of them! I saw him
  sneaking through the bushes! I saw his legs! I know it was an Indian because
  he had on moccasins instead of boots! Listen! That's him now!"</p>

  <p>"A Injun couldn't cuss like that," I said. "You've shot Uncle Jeppard
  Grimes!"</p>

  <p>Telling him to stay there, I run through the bresh, guided by the maddened
  howls which riz horribly on the air, and busting through some bushes I seen
  Uncle Jeppard rolling on the ground with both hands clasped to the rear bosom
  of his buckskin britches which was smoking freely. His langwidge was awful to
  hear.</p>

  <p>"Air you in misery, Uncle Jeppard?" I inquired solicitously. This evoked
  another ear-splitting squall.</p>

  <p>"I'm writhin' in my death-throes," he says in horrible accents, "and you
  stands there and mocks my mortal agony! My own blood-kin!" he says.
  "ae&amp;ae&amp;ae&amp;ae&amp;!" says Uncle Jeppard with passion.</p>

  <p>"Aw," I says, "that there bird-shot wouldn't hurt a flea. It cain't be
  very deep under yore thick old hide. Lie on yore belly, Uncle Jeppard," I
  said, stropping my bowie on my boot, "and I'll dig out them shot for
  you."</p>

  <p>"Don't tech me!" he said fiercely, painfully climbing onto his feet.
  "Where's my rifle-gun? Gimme it! Now then, I demands that you bring that
  English murderer here where I can git a clean lam at him! The Grimes honor is
  besmirched and my new britches is rooint. Nothin' but blood can wipe out the
  stain on the family honor!"</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, "you hadn't no business sneakin' around after us
  thataway&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Here Uncle Jeppard give tongue to loud and painful shrieks.</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't I?" he howled. "Ain't a man got no right to pertect his own
  property? I was follerin' him to see that he didn't shoot no more tails offa
  my hawgs. And now he shoots me in the same place! He's a fiend in human
  form&mdash;a monster which stalks ravelin' through these hills bustin' for
  the blood of the innercent!"</p>

  <p>"Aw, J. Pembroke thought you was a Injun," I said.</p>

  <p>"He thought Daniel Webster was a wild wart-hawg," gibbered Uncle Jeppard.
  "He thought I was Geronimo. I reckon he'll massacre the entire population of
  Bear Creek under a misapprehension, and you'll uphold and defend him! When
  the cabins of yore kinfolks is smolderin' ashes, smothered in the blood of
  yore own relatives, I hope you'll be satisfied&mdash;bringin' a foreign
  assassin into a peaceful community!"</p>

  <p>Here Uncle Jeppard's emotions choked him, and he chawed his whiskers and
  then yanked out the five-dollar gold piece I give him for Daniel Webster's
  tail, and throwed it at me.</p>

  <p>"Take back yore filthy lucre," he said bitterly. "The day of retribution
  is close onto hand, Breckinridge Elkins, and the Lord of battles shall jedge
  between them which turns agen their kinfolks in their extremerties!"</p>

  <p>"In their which?" I says, but he merely snarled and went limping off
  through the trees, calling back over his shoulder: "They is still men on Bear
  Creek which will see justice did for the aged and helpless. I'll git that
  English murderer if it's the last thing I do, and you'll be sorry you stood
  up for him, you big lunkhead!"</p>

  <p>I went back to where J. Pembroke was waiting bewilderedly, and evidently
  still expecting a tribe of Injuns to bust out of the bresh and sculp him, and
  I said in disgust: "Let's go home. Tomorrer I'll take you so far away from
  Bear Creek you can shoot in any direction without hittin' a prize razorback
  or a antiquated gunman with a ingrown disposition. When Uncle Jeppard Grimes
  gits mad enough to throw away money, it's time to ile the Winchesters and
  strap your scabbard-ends to yore laigs."</p>

  <p>"Legs?" he said mistily, "But what about the Indian?"</p>

  <p>"There warn't no Injun, gol-dern it!" I howled. "They ain't been any on
  Bear Creek for four or five year. They&mdash;aw, hell! What's the use? Come
  on. It's gittin' late. Next time you see somethin' you don't understand, ast
  me before you shoot it. And remember, the more ferocious and woolly it looks,
  the more likely it is to be a leadin' citizen of Bear Creek."</p>

  <p>It was dark when we approached Uncle Saul's cabin, and J. Pembroke glanced
  back up the road, toward the settlement, and said: "My word, is it a
  political rally? Look! A torchlight parade!"</p>

  <p>I looked, and I said: "Quick! Git into the cabin and stay there."</p>

  <p>He turned pale, and said: "If there is danger, I insist on&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Insist all you dern please," I said. "But git in that house and stay
  there. I'll handle this. Uncle Saul, see he gits in there."</p>

  <p>Uncle Saul is a man of few words. He taken a firm grip on his pipe stem
  and grabbed J. Pembroke by the neck and seat of the britches and throwed him
  bodily into the cabin, and shet the door, and sot down on the stoop.</p>

  <p>"They ain't no use in you gittin' mixed up in this, Uncle Saul," I
  said.</p>

  <p>"You got yore faults, Breckinridge," he grunted. "You ain't got much
  sense, but yo're my favorite sister's son&mdash;and I ain't forgot that lame
  mule Jeppard traded me for a sound animal back in '69. Let 'em come!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>They come all right, and surged up in front of the cabin&mdash; Jeppard's
  boys Jack and Buck and Esau and Joash and Polk County. And Erath Elkins, and
  a mob of Gordons and Buckners and Polks, all more or less kin to me, except
  Joe Braxton who wasn't kin to any of us, but didn't like me because he was
  sweet on Miss Margaret. But Uncle Jeppard warn't with 'em. Some had torches
  and Polk County Grimes had a rope with a noose in it.</p>

  <p>"Where-at air you all goin' with that there lariat?" I ast them sternly,
  planting my enormous bulk in their path.</p>

  <p>"Perjuice the scoundrel!" said Polk County, waving his rope around his
  head. "Bring out the foreign invader which shoots hawgs and defenseless old
  men from the bresh!"</p>

  <p>"What you aim to do?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>"We aim to hang him!" they replied with hearty enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>Uncle Saul knocked the ashes out of his pipe and stood up and stretched
  his arms which looked like knotted oak limbs, and he grinned in his black
  beard like a old timber wolf, and he says: "Whar is dear cousin Jeppard to
  speak for hisself?"</p>

  <p>"Uncle Jeppard was havin' the shot picked outa his hide when we left,"
  says Joel Gordon. "He'll be along directly. Breckinridge, we don't want no
  trouble with you, but we aims to have that Englishman."</p>

  <p>"Well," I snorted, "you all cain't. Bill Glanton is trustin' me to return
  him whole of body and limb, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What you want to waste time in argyment for, Breckinridge?" Uncle Saul
  reproved mildly. "Don't you know it's a plumb waste of time to try to reason
  with the off-spring of a lame-mule trader?"</p>

  <p>"What would you suggest, old man?" sneeringly remarked Polk County.</p>

  <p>Uncle Saul beamed on him benevolently, and said gently: "I'd try moral
  suasion&mdash;like this!" And he hit Polk County under the jaw and knocked
  him clean acrost the yard into a rain barrel amongst the ruins of which he
  reposed until he was rescued and revived some hours later.</p>

  <p>But they was no stopping Uncle Saul oncet he took the war-path. No sooner
  had he disposed of Polk County than he jumped seven foot into the air,
  cracked his heels together three times, give the rebel yell and come down
  with his arms around the necks of Esau Grimes and Joe Braxton, which he went
  to the earth with and starting mopping up the cabin yard with 'em.</p>

  <p>That started the fight, and they is no scrap in the world where mayhem is
  committed as free and fervent as in one of these here family rukuses.</p>

  <p>Polk County had hardly crashed into the rain barrel when Jack Grimes stuck
  a pistol in my face. I slapped it aside just as he fired and the bullet
  missed me and taken a ear offa Jim Gordon. I was scared Jack would hurt
  somebody if he kept on shooting reckless that way, so I kinda rapped him with
  my left fist and how was I to know it would dislocate his jaw. But Jim Gordon
  seemed to think I was to blame about his ear because he give a maddened howl
  and jerked up his shotgun and let <i>bam</i> with both barrels. I ducked just
  in time to keep from getting my head blowed off, and catched most of the
  double- charge in my shoulder, whilst the rest hived in the seat of Steve
  Kirby's britches. Being shot that way by a relative was irritating, but I
  controlled my temper and merely taken the gun away from Jim and splintered
  the stock over his head.</p>

  <p>In the meantime Joel Gordon and Buck Grimes had grabbed one of my laigs
  apiece and was trying to rassle me to the earth, and Joash Grimes was trying
  to hold down my right arm, and cousin Pecos Buckner was beating me over the
  head from behind with a ax-handle, and Erath Elkins was coming at me from the
  front with a bowie knife. I reached down and got Buck Grimes by the neck with
  my left hand, and I swung my right and hit Erath with it, but I had to lift
  Joash clean off his feet and swing him around with the lick, because he
  wouldn't let go, so I only knocked Erath through the rail fence which was
  around Uncle Saul's garden.</p>

  <p>About this time I found my left laig was free and discovered that Buck
  Grimes was unconscious, so I let go of his neck and begun to kick around with
  my left laig and it ain't my fault if the spur got tangled up in Uncle
  Jonathan Polk's whiskers and jerked most of 'em out by the roots. I shaken
  Joash off and taken the ax-handle away from Pecos because I seen he was going
  to hurt somebody if he kept on swinging it around so reckless, and I dunno
  why he blames me because his skull got fractured when he hit that tree. He
  oughta look where he falls when he gets throwed across a cabin yard. And if
  Joel Gordon hadn't been so stubborn trying to gouge me he wouldn't of got his
  laig broke neither.</p>

  <p>I was handicapped by not wanting to kill any of my kinfolks, but they was
  so mad they all wanted to kill me, so in spite of my carefulness the
  casualties was increasing at a rate which would of discouraged anybody but
  Bear Creek folks. But they are the stubbornnest people in the world. Three or
  four had got me around the laigs again, refusing to be convinced that I
  couldn't be throwed that way, and Erath Elkins, having pulled hisself out of
  the ruins of the fence, come charging back with his bowie.</p>

  <p>By this time I seen I'd have to use violence in spite of myself, so I
  grabbed Erath and squoze him with a grizzly-hug and that was when he got them
  five ribs caved in, and he ain't spoke to me since. I never seen such a cuss
  for taking offense over trifles.</p>

  <p>For a matter of fact, if he hadn't been so bodaciously riled up&mdash; if
  he had of kept his head like I did&mdash;he would have seen how kindly I felt
  toward him even in the fever of that there battle. If I had dropped him
  underfoot he might have been tromped on fatally for I was kicking folks right
  and left without caring where they fell. So I carefully flung Erath out of
  the range of that ruckus&mdash;and if he thinks I aimed him at Ozark Grimes
  and his pitchfork&mdash;well, I just never done it. It was Ozark's fault more
  than mine for toting that pitchfork, and it ought to be Ozark that Erath
  cusses when he starts to sit down these days.</p>

  <p>It was at this moment that somebody swung at me with a ax and ripped my
  ear nigh offa my head, and I begun to lose my temper. Four or five other
  relatives was kicking and hitting and biting at me all at oncet, and they is
  a limit even to my timid manners and mild nature. I voiced my displeasure
  with a beller of wrath, and lashed out with both fists, and my misguided
  relatives fell all over the yard like persimmons after a frost. I grabbed
  Joash Grimes by the ankles and begun to knock them ill-advised idjits in the
  head with him, and the way he hollered you'd of thought somebody was
  manhandling him. The yard was beginning to look like a battle-field when the
  cabin door opened and a deluge of b'iling water descended on us.</p>

  <p>I got about a gallon down my neck, but paid very little attention to it,
  however the others ceased hostilities and started rolling on the ground and
  hollering and cussing, and Uncle Saul riz up from amongst the ruins of Esau
  Grimes and Joe Braxton, and bellered: "Woman! What air you at?"</p>

  <p>Aunt Zavalla Garfield was standing in the doorway with a kettle in her
  hand, and she said: "Will you idjits stop fightin'? The Englishman's gone. He
  run out the back door when the fightin' started, saddled his nag and pulled
  out. Now will you born fools stop, or will I give you another deluge? Land
  save us! What's that light?"</p>

  <p>Somebody was yelling toward the settlement, and I was aware of a peculiar
  glow which didn't come from such torches as was still burning. And here come
  Medina Kirby, one of Bill's gals, yelping like a Comanche.</p>

  <p>"Our cabin's burnin'!" she squalled. "A stray bullet went through the
  winder and busted Miss Margaret's ile lamp!"</p>

  <p>With a yell of dismay I abandoned the fray and headed for Bill's cabin,
  follered by everybody which was able to foller me. They had been several wild
  shots fired during the melee and one of 'em must have hived in Miss
  Margaret's winder. The Kirbys had dragged most of their belongings into the
  yard and some was bringing water from the creek, but the whole cabin was in a
  blaze by now.</p>

  <p>"Whar's Miss Margaret?" I roared.</p>

  <p>"She must be still in there!" shrilled Miss Kirby. "A beam fell and wedged
  her door so we couldn't open it, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I grabbed a blanket one of the gals had rescued and plunged it into the
  rain barrel and run for Miss Margaret's room. They wasn't but one door in it,
  which led into the main part of the cabin, and was jammed like they said, and
  I knowed I couldn't never get my shoulders through either winder, so I just
  put down my head and rammed the wall full force and knocked four or five logs
  outa place and made a hole big enough to go through.</p>

  <p>The room was so full of smoke I was nigh blinded but I made out a figger
  fumbling at the winder on the other side. A flaming beam fell outa the roof
  and broke acrost my head with a loud report and about a bucketful of coals
  rolled down the back of my neck, but I paid no heed.</p>

  <p>I charged through the smoke, nearly fracturing my shin on a bedstead or
  something, and enveloped the figger in the wet blanket and swept it up in my
  arms. It kicked wildly and fought and though its voice was muffled in the
  blanket I ketched some words I never would of thought Miss Margaret would
  use, but I figgered she was hysterical. She seemed to be wearing spurs, too,
  because I felt 'em every time she kicked.</p>

  <p>By this time the room was a perfect blaze and the roof was falling in and
  we'd both been roasted if I'd tried to get back to the hole I knocked in the
  oppersite wall. So I lowered my head and butted my way through the near wall,
  getting all my eyebrows and hair burnt off in the process, and come
  staggering through the ruins with my precious burden and fell into the arms
  of my relatives which was thronged outside.</p>

  <p>"I've saved her!" I panted. "Pull off the blanket! Yo're safe, Miss
  Margaret!"</p>

  <p>"$ae&amp;ae&amp;ae&amp;ae$ae!" said Miss Margaret, and Uncle Saul groped
  under the blanket and said: "By golly, if this is the schoolteacher she's
  growed a remarkable set of whiskers since I seen her last!"</p>

  <p>He yanked off the blanket&mdash;to reveal the bewhiskered countenance of
  Uncle Jeppard Grimes!</p>

  <p>"Hell's fire!" I bellered. "What <i>you</i> doin' here?"</p>

  <p>"I was comin' to jine the lynchin', you blame fool!" he snarled. "I seen
  Bill's cabin was afire so I clumb in through the back winder to save Miss
  Margaret. She was gone, but they was a note she'd left. I was fixin' to climb
  out the winder when this maneyack grabbed me."</p>

  <p>"Gimme that note!" I bellered, grabbing it. "Medina! Come here and read it
  for me."</p>

  <p>That note run:</p>

  <p class="letter">Dear Breckinridge:<br>
  am sorry, but I can't stay on Bear Creek any longer. It was tough enough
  anyway, but being expected to marry you was the last straw. You've been very
  kind to me, but it would be too much like marrying a grizzly bear. Please
  forgive me. I am eloping with J. Pembroke Pemberton. We're going out the back
  window to avoid any trouble, and ride away on his horse. Give my love to the
  children. We are going to Europe on our honeymoon.<br>
  With love.<br>
  &mdash;Margaret Ashley.</p>

  <p>"Now what you got to say?" sneered Uncle Jeppard.</p>

  <p>"I'm a victim of foreign entanglements," I said dazedly. "I'm goin' to
  chaw Bill Glanton's ears off for saddlin' that critter on me. And then I'm
  goin' to lick me a Englishman if I have to go all the way to Californy to
  find one."</p>

  <p>Which same is now my aim, object and ambition. This Englishman took my
  girl and ruined my education, and filled my neck and spine with burns and
  bruises. A Elkins never forgets&mdash;and the next one that pokes his nose
into the
  Bear Creek country had better be a fighting fool or a powerful fast
  runner.</p>
