<p>The story that William Dampier was the first Englishman to set
foot upon the mainland of Australia may be true. But there is
sufficient evidence in existence to show that long before Dampier
doubled Cape L&eacute;v&ecirc;que in January, 1688, in the ship
<i>Cygnet</i>, of London, English ships had traversed Australian
waters and English seamen had charted islands lying close to the
shores of the continent.</p>

<p>Of these voyages perhaps that of Captain John Daniel is best
remembered, owing to the fact that Alexander Dalrymple has handed
down to us a copy of his chart. Captain Daniel first sighted
Wallabi Group, the northernmost of the three groups comprising
the Abrolhos. He named it. Dangerous Rocks. He also may have
bestowed the name of Maiden's Isle upon Rottnest Island, for it
is so called upon many an old map. His ship, the <i>New
London</i> (not simply the <i>London</i>, as her name is often
written), of six hundred tons, was freighted to Bantam in
January, 1681. She arrived off the coast of Western Australia in
the month of June, when Captain Daniel's printed journal
records:--</p>

<blockquote>"With the wind S.W. by W. steering by compass N.E. by
E. at 10 a.m. the water was discoloured. A man at the foretop saw
a breach rise ahead of us. We put our helm hard a starboard...and
weathered the N.W. end of it about a mile...The breach that we
first saw happened to be the northernmost of all, there being
several and by our computation [they] are 20 miles in length.
Within the breaches, several small white sandy islands were seen,
with some bushes on them. A very heavy sea broke against the
south part of these shoals. When close to them the mainland was
not seen."</blockquote>

<p>It is evident, therefore, that Daniel was aware of the
mainland's proximity. This was six years and a half before
Dampier reached the north-west coast.</p>

<p>At a still earlier date, however, English vessels had made
their appearance in these southern waters. On September 4, 1621,
the <i>Trial</i> (John Brooke, master) left Plymouth with a full
cargo and one hundred and forty-three men on board for Java. She
made slow progress towards the Cape of Good Hope, where she
obtained refreshment, leaving there on March 19, 1622. Two months
later she was wrecked on a ledge of rocks to the north-west of
the Australian continent, where many of her crew were drowned.
From that time the rocks on which she struck were placed in the
charts under the name of the "Tryal Rocks." Hitherto very little
information has been available relating to the events of this
voyage, but I have been fortunate in finding at the India Office
the original letter of Brooke to the owners of the <i>Trial</i>
narrating the loss of the ship, together with another written by
Thomas Bright, who had charge of the longboat in which a part of
the crew escaped from the doomed vessel.[*] These are of
considerable interest, for they throw new light on the fate of
the <i>Trial</i> and the circumstances in which Australia was
first sighted by Englishmen. The following extracts from the
above-mentioned documents seem therefore to be worthy of
record.</p>

<p>[*India Office Records, 0.C., Vol. ix., No. 1072; and 0.C.,
Vol. ix., No. 1070.]</p>

<p>Brooke writes:--</p>

<blockquote>"The 1st daye of Maye I sawe land being in. the
latitude of 22 degrees, which land had been formelie seen by the
Flemings and which laye in the cardes N.E. by N. and S.E. by S.
from the Straits of Sunda. This island is 18 leagues long and we
were all verie joyful at the sight thereof but finding 8 degrees
variation by our judgment and Captain Fitzharbert's Jurnall that
he went 10 leagues to the southwards of this Iland and being in
this variation pestered by N.E. and by E. [winds] and fell [in]
with the East end of Java..."</blockquote>

<p>The land Brooke refers to was doubtless the point of the
Australian mainland to the southward of North West Cape, in
latitude 22&deg; 42' S., known as Point Cloates. Owing to the
trend of the coast here and the elbow in its outline, seamen on
sighting it were unable to distinguish its true form or extent.
Brooke, like the Dutch captains who first saw it, believed that
it was an island.[*] He appears to have had on board a copy of
the Journal of Captain Humphrey Fitzherbert, who, in the ship
<i>Royal Exchange</i>, had voyaged to Java in 1620. We are told
in the records of this voyage that "on the advice of the Flemings
they sailed a more southerly course than any Englishman had gone
before, which proved very healthful to the men."[**] The <i>Royal
Exchange</i> therefore had preceded the <i>Trial</i> into these
waters, but in the accounts of Fitzherbert's voyage there is no
mention that he sighted any land in this locality.</p>

<p>[* The Dutch ship <i>Mauritius</i>, in 1618, was one of the
first to sight this land, and her commander called it. "een
eylant."]</p>

<p>[** *Extract of a letter from Launcelot Fenwicke to the E.I.
Company, India Office Records, 0.C., Vol. vii., No. 919.]</p>

<p>Brooke experienced a long delay after weathering North West
Cape. He continues:--</p>

<blockquote>"I take the opinion and counsell of my people when
the winds came faire but havinge contrarie winde betwene the N.
and the N.E. which held us from the 5th daye of Maie until the
24th of the same month, the great Iland with his 3 small Ilands
at the Easter end bearing S.E. 20 leagues of us[*]; the winde
veering to the S.E. and faire weather, we steered N.E. thinking
to fall [in] with the wester part of Java. The 25th daye at 11 of
the clocke in the night--faire weather and smoothe wetter--the
shipp strooke. I ran to the Poope and hove the leads. I found but
3 fadom wafter, 60 men being upon the deck, 5 of them would not
beleave that she strooke, I criinge to them to beare up and tacke
to the westward: they did ther beste but the rock being sharpe
the ship was presentlie full of watter. For the most part of
these rocks lie 2 fadom under watter. It struck my men in such a
mayze when I said...the ship strooke and they could see neyther
breach, land, rocks, chainge of watter nor signe of dainger,--the
ship sitting a good while after that I had hove the lead whilst I
had brought my sailes a backstaies. Before she strooke the second
strooke the winde began suddenly to freshe and blowe. I strooke
down my sailes and gott out my skiffe and bid them sound about
the shipp. They found sharp suncken rocks half a cable in length
astarne, noe ground. These rocks are steepe to, so I made all the
waye I could to gett out my long boate and by 2 of the clocke had
gotten her out, and hanged her in the tackles over the side. Soe
seeing the shipp full of watter and the winde to increase made
all the means I could to save...as maniee...as I could...The
boate put off at 4 in the morning and halfe an houer after the
fore part of the shipp fell in pieces! the men were saved in the
skiffe[**] and 36 in the long boate...I came awaie with my boate
for the Straights.[***] My boate [i.e. the long-boat] stood back
for the great Iland [presumably Barrow Island] which is 7 leagues
to the S.E. wards of the place where the shipp was cast
awaie."</blockquote>

<p>[* Barrow Island.]</p>

<p>[** Brooke himself was saved on board the skiff.]</p>

<p>[*** He probably passed through Bali Strait on his way to
Bantam.]</p>

<p>Brooke now gives a piece of information regarding a discovery
made by the long-boat which by reason of its early date ought to
provide a new starting-point for historians recording English
explorations of Australia. He says:--</p>

<blockquote>"...the boate found a little lowe Iland...I fell [in]
with the Easter end of Java the 8th daie of June 1622: at Bantam
the 21 ditto and at Jaccatra [Batavia] the 25th of the same
month. 1 had one barrecoe a water, 2 casses of bottles, 2 runlets
of aquavite, 40 li bread and for 4 Wes togeather so much raine
and sea that our skiffe was allwaies 1/3 full of watter. The
boate had 2 runlets wine, 6 barrecoes of watter, 2 casses of
bottles and 1 C [wt.] of bread."</blockquote>

<p>In describing the approach to the Tryal Rocks, he
remarks:--</p>

<blockquote>"This Iland lieth false in his Longitud 200 leagues
[sic.]...as also these suncken rockes as by my draught will
appear...A Dutch shipp the <i>Armes of Horne</i>[*] which came
some month after me fell [in] with the land...This remote
passidge the Dutch Generall doth not like, such over falles,
weeds and ripplins which I and this Dutchman have passed!...and
noe ground at 200 faudoms but in stormie weather in the night in
some places, the sea is all in a breach."</blockquote>

<p>[* The <i>Wapen Van Hoorn</i> sailed from the Texel on
December 22, 1621, and arrived at Batavia on July 22, 1622.]</p>

<p>The fortunes of those who left the ship in the longboat are
vividly described by Thomas Bright, who had charge of her. He
writes:--</p>

<blockquote>"May the 25th about X of the clock, night and fayre
weather...Lattitude 20&deg; 3'[*]...shipp...struck upon the rocks
as soon, or before any breach discovered; billidged her hould
full of watter in an instant...The long Boat with greatt
difficultie wee gott out [there] being 128 soules left to God's
mercye, whereof 36 [were] saved. Wee keeping till day some 1/4
mile or more from the shipp...the sea then so high, wee durst
not...adventure to them and for that wee [were] so slenderly
provided with provisions that [it was] impossible, without God's
great providence wee should aryve at our wished [for] port...Upon
sight of day wee espied a Iland bearing South East some five
leagues att most from us...By all likly hoods land could not be
farr by the fowle and weeds. ail that day drivinge from the Iland
and rocks, to which said Iland wee went; stayed thereon seaven
dayes for the freinge [freshing] of our boate and supplie of
watter (having when we left the shipp but one barrecoe full, the
reste emptie [there] being none but what the Lord sent per
rayne). Not any inhabitants thereon. Wee travelled over all the
land seeing nothing but Ilands, some small, some greatt, breaches
and shoules every way as farr as wee could see. Very dangerous on
the N.W. syde. To the S.S.W. of this Ile ther lyeth a great
Iland[**] neere nyne leagues off."</blockquote>

<p>[* Brooke gives the latitude as 20&deg; 10' S., and he so
reported it to the Dutch Governor-General when he arrived at
Jacatra.]</p>

<p>[* Presumably Barrow Island, to which Brooke has already drawn
attention in his letter.]</p>

<p>The men therefore spent a week on the "little lowe iland"
which Brooke has already told us his boat "found." He made two
"draughts" of the "rocks and Iland with their Latituds,
Longituds, variations, courses and distances" seen in the
vicinity, which were sent home by "first conveyance." Bright also
says he intended to "laye downe a full description of these
Ilands." Their charts evidently arrived safely in England, but do
not seem to have been preserved, and the situation of the rocks
whereon the <i>Trial</i> struck remained a secret for many years.
Both English and Dutch ships searched for them until many began
to doubt their existence, because the seamen who claimed to have
sightged them placed them in different latitudes. Dampier hoped
to find them. The Jane, frigate, in 1705, looked for them in
vain. 1n July, 1777, Captain Martin Foss, of the ship
<i>Fredensberg Castle</i>, reported that he had seen them. This
Danish account stated that they "bore E. distant 12 miles at noon
in lat. 20&deg; 40' S. meridian distance 23&deg; 45' E. from St.
Paul, and that "these rocks lie N.W. and. S.E. and extend in
length 24 miles, the centre of them appears...not higher out of
the water than a small vessel's hull: the extremes are clusters
of small broken rocks now and then appearing as the sea retires
and are about 4 miles from each extreme of the main rock."[*]</p>

<p>[* Captain Stokes afterwards recognised them by this
description, although he found that Foss' longitude "placed. them
13 degrees more to westward, near the position they have occupied
for years in the charts" (Stokes's "<i>Voyage in the Beagle</i>,"
Vol. ii., p. 209).]</p>

<p>Captain Wilson, in the <i>Vansittart</i> in 1789, was the next
who endeavoured to locate them, and began his search where they
had been placed by the Danish captain; but he did not find them,
and therefore concluded that if the rocks Captain Foss described
"were situated within these limits" it was, barely possible that
the ships <i>Lascelles</i>, <i>Carnatic</i>, and the
<i>Vansittart</i> "could have passed without seeing them." Once
again. the sea kept its secret, and, on hearing the result,
Horsburgh was led to remark: "We are still left in doubt whether
or not the Tryal Rocks...have any real existence." Geographers,
however, continued to place them on their maps, even after
sailors had given up the search as fruitless.</p>

<p>At last, in 1819, the voyage of the <i>Greyhound</i> on her
passage from China to Port Jackson re-opened the question, her
Commander declaring that he had met with a reef of rocks which
were the long-lost Tryal Rocks. In 1820, acting under orders from
the Admiralty, Lieutenant Phillip Parker King, in H.M.S.
<i>Mermaid</i>, made a minute survey of the different situations
where the rocks had been reported, and came to the conclusion
that the Monte Bello Islands exactly answered their description,
and he writes: "There remains no doubt in my mind but that Barrow
Island in 20&deg; 40' S., 115&deg; 27' E. and Trimouille Island
and the numerous reefs around them, are the identical Tryal
Rocks." Since King's day naval surveyors have found their exact
position. Admiralty Sailing Directions (1917) states: "Tryal
Rocks awash at high water are near the outer edge of the S.W.
part of Monte Bello Islands reef and 5 miles N. of the North
extreme of Barrow Island."</p>

<p>It is now difficult to realise that only seventeen years after Willem Jansz,
  in the Dutch ship <i>Duifken</i>,, had made what is known as "the first authentic
  discovery of Australia, thirty-six shipwrecked English seamen spent seven days
  almost within sight of the land which afterwards was proclaimed a British possession
  and became the home of so many of their race.</p>
