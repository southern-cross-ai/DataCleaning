<h2>H2, etc.</h2>

<h4>by</h4>

<h3>A.J. Alan</h3>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>I've got a cat. She's a black Persian&mdash;a shocking great
beast&mdash;and she weighs over fifteen pounds on our kitchen
scales, but she's awfully delicate. If she stays out too long in
the cold she gets bronchitis and has to be sat up with. So,
unless it's really hot weather, we reckon to get her indoors by
eleven o'clock.</p>

<p>Well, one night not long ago&mdash;it was after
eleven&mdash;in fact ten past twelve, and we were sort of
thinking of bed, when my wife said, "I wonder where Tibbins is."
Tibbins is, of course, our cat, and at that time in the evening
she ought, according to her schedule, to have been lying in a
heap with the dogs in front of the fire.</p>

<p>However, the dogs were there but she wasn't. No one remembered
having seen her last, so I made a tour of her usual haunts. She
wasn't in her basket by the coke stove down in the scullery,
where she generally takes her morning nap, neither was she in
hell. Hell is a place at the top of the house where the hot-water
cistern is. She often retires there in the afternoon. At all
events, I drew a complete blank, so we were finally forced to the
conclusion that she wasn't in the house at all, and my wife said,
"I'm afraid you'll have to go out and meow for her." So I went
out and meowed.</p>

<p>I searched our garden, but as she wasn't there I went through
the main garden. Perhaps I'd better explain that all the houses
in our road have their own gardens at the back, and these have
gates into what we call the main garden. This runs right along
behind them, and there's one of these main gardens to every eight
houses or so, but they are divided off from each other by the
side-turnings which run into our road.</p>

<p>I'm afraid it sounds rather complicated. However, our
particular main garden is about a hundred yards long and forty
yards wide, and it's quite big enough for a black cat to hide in,
as I found. I walked round every blooming bush in it and said,
"R-r-r-wow," or words to that effect, in what I considered to be
an ingratiating manner, but without any success, and I was just
going to chuck my hand in when I saw our Tibbins sitting on the
end wall. That is to say, the wall which divides the garden from
the road.</p>

<p>She let me sidle quite close, but just as I was going to grab
her she jumped down on the far side (the road side). Then she
skipped across the road and squeezed through the bars of the gate
into the next main garden. I said a few things and climbed over
the wall and followed her. Of course, I couldn't squeeze between
the bars of the gate so I had to scramble over the top. She very
kindly waited while I did this and then moved off just ahead. She
frolicked about with her tail in the air, as who should say,
"Isn't it fun our going for a walk like this in the moonlight?"
and I told her what fun I thought it was. I'd already torn my
dinner-jacket getting over the gate, but it's no good being
sarcastic to a cat.</p>

<p>She continued to lead me up the garden, darting from tree to
tree, until we got half-way along, and then she turned off to the
right and went into one of the private gardens. Luckily the gate
was open and I didn't have to climb over it. The house it
belonged to was all in darkness, of course, but when I got to the
middle of the lawn the lights suddenly came on in one of the
ground-floor rooms. It had a French window and the blinds were
up.</p>

<p>Well, this startled the cat and she let me pick her up, so
that was all right, but just as I was turning to come away a
little old man appeared at the window. He was so close that he
couldn't have helped seeing me if I'd moved, so I stood quite
still and held Tibbins up against my shirt front. He was a very
old man indeed, rather inclined to dodder, and he had on a dark
blue dressing-gown. He'd got something white hanging over his
arm, I couldn't quite see what it was, but it looked like a small
towel.</p>

<p>Anyway, he peered out for a bit and then he drew the bolts and
pushed the window open. He came and stood right outside, and I
thought, "He's bound to see me now," but he didn't seem to. After
a minute he wandered back into the room again, and sat down and
began writing a letter.</p>

<p>By the way, this wasn't exactly a sitting-room. It had more
the appearance of a workroom. I mean, there was a large deal
table which looked as if it was used for cutting out on, a
gas-ring for heating irons, and a sewing-machine, and things like
that.</p>

<p>I didn't wait to notice any more. While the old gentleman was
busy, me and my cat left.</p>

<p>When I got home my wife had gone to bed. I told her about my
adventures and what I'd seen and so on, and she said, "I wonder
which house it was." I couldn't tell the number from the back,
naturally, but I made a rough guess whereabouts it came and she
said, "Oh, then, I think I know the old man. He's usually out in
a bath-chair. He doesn't look quite right in his head and he's
got asthma or something." And I said, "Well, paddling about the
garden won't do his asthma any good. What had we better do?"</p>

<p>It was no use trying to telephone because we didn't know the
name of the people or their number in the road, so there was
obviously nothing for it but to go back and see what he was up to
and warn his family that he'd got loose.</p>

<p>You mustn't think that we spend our lives doing good deeds,
but we both came to the conclusion that it wouldn't be nice to go
past the house in a week's time and find a hearse at the
door.</p>

<p>At any rate, at perfectly enormous self-sacrifice I went back,
over all the walls and gates and what not, and once again fetched
up on this precious lawn. The windows had been pulled to but the
light was on and I could see in.</p>

<p>The old josser was still sitting at the table, only I couldn't
see his face. It was rather funny, he'd got himself up rather
like a member of the Ku Klux Klan. You know, you've seen pictures
of them. They wear a sort of tall white head-dress going up to a
point with two round holes cut out for the eyes. But what he'd
got on wasn't a proper head-dress, it was a pillow-case, and
there weren't any holes for the eyes.</p>

<p>I wondered for a moment what he was playing at until I noticed
that he'd taken the tube off the gas-ring and shoved it up into
the pillow-case. He'd buttoned his dressing-gown round it to keep
it from falling out.</p>

<p>I said, "Oh, that's it, is it?" and pulled the windows open
(they weren't fastened), and I went in and lugged the pillowcase
off his head and turned off the gas.</p>

<p>He wasn't at all dead, but he'd begun to turn grey&mdash;well,
a silvery colour, and I wouldn't have given much for him in
another ten minutes.</p>

<p>The only treatment that occurred to me was fresh air in large
quantities, so I rolled him up in the hearthrug and laid him down
outside the window. There was a note on the table addressed to
the coroner, and I wondered whether I ought to do anything with
it, but decided not to.</p>

<p>Next I went through to the bottom of the stairs and set about
rousing the house, and you've no idea what a job that was. If I
hadn't wanted them to hear me they'd have been yelling blue
murder out of the top windows for the last ten minutes. As it
was, I called out loudly several times without any one taking the
slightest notice.</p>

<p>I was even looking round for the dinner-gong when a door
opened somewhere upstairs and I heard whispering going on. It
went on for such a long time that I got annoyed. I said, "Will
some one please come down <i>at once</i> and not keep me standing
here all night." That had an effect. Two middle-aged females
appeared. Singularly nasty looking they were, and I loathe
boudoir caps at the best of times. They were evidently sisters; I
explained who I was and told them that an old gentleman had just
done his very best to make away with himself. They said, "Oh
dear, oh dear, that's father. How exasperating of him. He's
always doing it." And I said, "What are you talking about,
'always doing it,' it's not a thing people usually make a hobby
of." (We were out by the window by this time inspecting the
culprit.) And they said, "Well, you see, as a matter of fact,
it's like this. Father is very old and he suffers from
melancholia. Every now and then, when he gets an especially bad
fit, he tries to commit suicide like this. We can't stop him
because he simply won't be locked in his room. First of all he
creeps down here and writes a letter to the coroner" (they'd
apparently got several of them), "and then he goes through this
performance with the pillow-case and turns on the gas." I said,
"Yes, that's all very well, but why doesn't it work? I mean it
ought to kill him every time." And they said, "Oh, that's all
right, we've thought of that. We always turn the gas off at the
main before we go to bed." They had the nerve to tell me that
once or twice they'd actually watched through the keyhole and
seen it all happen. According to them there was just enough gas
left in the pipe to send him off to sleep, and at three or four
in the morning he'd wake up and crawl back to bed and forget all
about it.</p>

<p>Well, it isn't often that I can't think of anything adequate
to say, but I couldn't then. I've never in all my life been so
angry with two women at once. It was no use calling them the
names I wanted to call them because they wouldn't have
understood. I did remark on their unsuitability to be in charge
of any one, and I also threatened to run them in, though I don't
quite know what for, but it must be illegal to hazard one's
parents like that. Anyway, they got rather haughty. They said
there was no need for any one to interfere because they'd already
made arrangements to send their father to a home in Kent. I said,
"Mind you do," and the subject rather dropped. It was a little
difficult to know what to do for the best, because they wouldn't
hear of sending for a doctor, and I couldn't make them&mdash;you
can't, you know. Every moment I was expecting them to disapprove
my dictatorial attitude. The patient was recovering, but he still
looked as if he wanted fresh air, so we decided to give him a few
minutes more.</p>

<p>At the same time it wouldn't have done to let him catch his
death of cold, so we covered him up with some more rugs.</p>

<p>After that, by way of something to do, I put the india-rubber
tube back on to the gas-ring with the idea of boiling some water
for hot bottles. When I'd fixed it I just turned the tap on and
off to see if it was working, quite forgetting that there
oughtn't to be any gas. But there was&mdash;quite a lot. It came
out with no end of a hiss; and I said, "Oy, you seem to get a
better pressure in this house with the main turned off than we do
with it on," and I turned the tap on again. You could hear it all
over the room. Upon which one of the ugly sisters said to the
other, "Agatha, are you sure you turned it off last thing?" And
Agatha naturally was absolutely certain. She distinctly
remembered doing it. She began to tell us all her reasons for
remembering it so distinctly, but I said, "Why argue when we can
go and look?" So we went and looked, in the pantry, and, of
course, there it was&mdash;full on.</p>
