<h1><a name="c101" id="c101"><i>Ten Little
Legionaries</i></a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>At the Depôt at Sidi bel-Abbès, Sergeant-Major Suicide-Maker
was a devil, but at a little frontier outpost in the desert, he
was <i>the</i> devil, the increase in his degree being
commensurate with the increase in his opportunities. When the
Seventh Company of the First Battalion of the First Regiment of
the Foreign Legion of France, stationed at Aïnargoula in the
Sahara, learned that Lieutenant Roberte was in hospital with a
broken leg, it realized that, Captain d'Armentières being absent
with the Mule Company, chasing Touareg to the south, it would be
commanded for a space by Sergeant-Major Suicide-Maker--in other
words by The Devil.</p>
<p>Not only would it be commanded by him, it would be harried,
harassed, hounded, bullied, brow-beaten, and be-devilled; it
would be unable to call its soul its own and loth so to call its
body.</p>
<p>On realizing the ugly truth, the Seventh Company gasped
unanimously and then swore diversely in all the languages of
Europe and a few of those of Asia and Africa. It realized that it
was about to learn, as the Bucking Bronco remarked to his friend
John Bull (once Sir Montague Merline, of the Queen's African
Rifles), that it had been wrong in guessing it was already on the
ground-floor of hell. Or, if it had been there heretofore, it was
now about to have a taste of the cellars.</p>
<p>Sergeant-Major Suicide-Maker had lived well up to his
reputation, even under the revisional jurisdiction and faintly
restraining curb of Captain d'Armentières and then of Lieutenant
Roberte.</p>
<p>Each of these was a strong man and a just, and though anything
in the world but mild and indulgent, would not permit really
unbridled vicious tyranny such as the Sergeant-Major's
unsupervised, unhampered sway would be. Under their command, he
would always be limited to the surreptitious abuse of his very
considerable legitimate powers. With no one above him, the mind
shrank from contemplating the life of a Legionary in Aïnargoula,
and from conceiving this worthy as absolute monarch and arbitrary
autocrat.</p>
<p>The number of men undergoing <i>cellule</i> punishment would
be limited only by standing room in the cells--each a miniature
Black Hole of Calcutta with embellishments. The time spent in
drilling at the <i>pas gymnastique</i> <sup>1</sup> and, worse,
standing at "attention" in the hottest corner of the red-hot
barrack-yard would be only limited by the physical capacity of
the Legionaries to run and to stand at "attention." Never would
there be "<i>Rompez</i>" <sup>2</sup> until some one had been
carried to hospital, suffering from heat-stroke or collapse. The
alternatives to the maddening agony of life would be suicide,
desertion (and death from thirst or at the hands of the Arabs),
or revolt and the Penal Battalions--the one thing on earth worse
than Legion life in a desert station, under a half-mad bully
whose monomania was driving men to suicide. <i>Le Cafard,</i> the
desert madness of the Legion, was rampant and chronic. Ten
legionaries under the leadership of a Frenchman calling himself
Blondin, and who spoke perfect English and German, had formed a
secret society and hatched a plot. They were going to "remove"
Sergeant-Major Suicide-Maker and "go on pump," as the legionary
calls deserting.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><sup>1</sup> The "double" march. <sup>2</sup> Dismiss.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Blondin (a pretty, black-eyed, black-moustached Provençal, who
looked like a blue-jowled porcelain doll) was an educated man,
brilliantly clever, and of considerable personality and force of
character. Also he was a finished and heartless scoundrel. His
nine adherents were Ramon Diego, a grizzled Spaniard, a man of
tremendous physical strength and weak mind; Fritz Bauer, a Swiss,
also much stronger of muscle than of brain; a curious
Franco-Berber half-caste called Jean Kebir, who spoke perfect
Arabic and knew the Koran by heart <i>(Kebir</i> is Arabic for
"lion," and a lion Jean Kebir was, and Blondin had been very glad
indeed to win him over, as he would be an invaluable interpreter
and adviser in the journey Blondin meant to take); Jacques
Lejaune, a domineering, violent ruffian, a former
merchant-captain, who could steer by the stars and use a compass;
Fritz Schlantz, a wonderful marksman; Karl Anderssen, who had won
the <i>médaille</i> for bravery; Mohamed the Turk--just plain
Mohamed <i>(very</i> plain); Georges Grondin, the musician, who
was a fine cook; and finally the big Moorish negro, Hassan
Moghrabi, who understood camels and horses.</p>
<p>The Society had been larger, but Franz Joseph Meyr the
Austrian had killed Dimitropoulos the Greek, had deserted alone,
and been filleted by the Touareg. Also Alexandre Bac, late of
Montmartre, had hanged himself, and La Cigale had gone too
hopelessly mad.</p>
<p>It had been for a grief unto Monsieur Blondin that he could by
no means persuade old Jean Boule to join. On being sworn to
secrecy and "approached" on the subject, ce bon Jean had replied
that he did not desire to quit the Legion (<i>Bon sang de
Dieu!</i>), and, moreover, that if he went "on pump," his friends
les Légionnaires Rupert, 'Erbiggin, and le Bouckaing Bronceau
would go too--and he did not wish to drag them into so perilous a
venture as an attempt to reach the Moroccan coast across the
desert from Aïnargoula. Moreover, if he came to know anything of
the plot to kill the Sergeant-Major he would certainly warn him,
if it were to be a mere stab-in-the-back assassination affair,
some dark night. A fair fight is a different thing. If Blondin
met the Sergeant-Major alone, when both had their
sword-bayonets--that was a different matter. . . .</p>
<p>Monsieur Blondin sheered off, and decided that the less Jean
Boule knew of the matter, the better for the devoted Ten. . .
.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"Ten little Légionnaires<br>
Going 'on pump,'<br>
Got away safely<br>
And gave <i>les autres</i> the 'ump,"</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>sang Monsieur Blondin, who was very fond of airing his really
remarkable knowledge of colloquial English, British slang,
clichés, rhymes, and <i>guinguette</i> songs. Not for nothing had
he been a Crédit Lyonnais bank-clerk in London for six years.
Being a Provençal, he added a pronounced <i>galégeade</i> wit to
his <i>macabre</i> Legion-humour.</p>
<p>One terrible day the Sergeant-Major excelled himself--but it
was not, as it happened, one of the Ten who attempted to "remove"
him.</p>
<p>Having drilled the parade of "defaulters" almost to death, he
halted the unfortunate wretches with their faces to a red-hot
wall and their backs to the smiting sun, and kept them at
"attention" until Tou-tou Boil-the-Cat, an evil liver, collapsed
and fell. He was allowed to lie. When, with a crash, old
Tant-de-Soif went prone upon his face, paying his dues to
Alcohol, the Sergeant-Major gave the order to turn about, and
then to prepare to fire. When the line stood, with empty rifles
to the shoulder, as in the act of firing, he kept it in the
arduous strain of this attitude that he might award severe
punishment to the owner of the first rifle that began to quiver
or sink downward. As he did so, he lashed and goaded his victims
mercilessly and skilfully.</p>
<p>At last, the rifle of poor young Jean Brecque began to sway
and droop, and the Sergeant-Major concentrated upon the
half-fainting lad the virulent stream of his poisonous
vituperation. Having dealt with the subject of Jean, he began
upon that of Jean's mother, and with such horrible foulness of
insult that Jean, whose mother was his saint, sprang forward and
swung his rifle up to brain the cowardly brute with the butt. As
he bounded forward and sprang at the Sergeant-Major, that officer
coolly drew his automatic pistol and shot Jean between the
eyes.</p>
<p>Had Blondin acted then, his followers, and the bulk of the
parade, would have leapt from their places and clubbed the
Sergeant-Major to a jelly. But Monsieur Blondin knew that the
Sergeant-Major had seven more bullets in his automatic, also that
the first man who moved would get one of them, and suicide formed
no part of his programme.</p>
<p>"Not just anyhow and anywhere in the trunk, you will observe,
<i>scélérats,"</i> remarked the Suicide-Maker coolly, turning
Jean over with his foot, "but neatly in the centre of the face,
just between the eyes. My favourite spot. <i>Cessez le feu!
Attention! Par files de quatre. Pas gymnastique. . . .</i> <i>En
avant. . . . Marche!</i>" . . .</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The plan was that the Ten, stark naked--so as to avoid any
incriminating stains, rents, or other marks upon their
garments--should, bayonet in hand, await the passing of the
"Suicide-Maker" along a dark corridor that evening. Having dealt
with him quietly, but faithfully, they would dress, break out of
the post, and set their faces for Morocco at the <i>pas
gymnastique.</i></p>
<p>As for Monsieur Blondin, he was determined that this should be
no wretched abortive stroll into the desert, ending in
ignominious return and surrender for food and water; in capture
by <i>goums</i> <sup>1</sup> in search of the 25 franc reward for
the return of a dead or alive deserter; nor in torture and death
at the hands of the first party of nomad Arabs that should see
fit to fall upon them. Blondin had read the <i>Anabasis</i> of
one Xenophon, and an <i>Anabasis</i> to Maroc he intended to
achieve on the shoulders, metaphorically speaking, of the
faithful nine. Toward the setting sun would he lead them, across
the Plain of the Shott, through the country of the Beni Guil,
toward the Haut Atlas range, along the southern slopes to the
Adrar Ndren, and so to Marakesh and service with the Sultan, or
to escape by Mogador, Mazagan, or Dar-el-Beida. No more difficult
really than toward Algiers or Oran, and, whereas capture in that
direction was certain, safety, once in Morocco, was almost
equally sure. For trained European soldiers were worth their
weight in silver to the Sultan, and, in his service, might amass
their weight in gold. A Moorish villa (and a harem) surrounded by
fig-orchards, olive-fields, vineyards, palm-groves, and a
fragrant garden of pepper-trees, eucalyptus, walnut, almond,
oleander, orange and lemon, would suit Monsieur Blondin well. Oh,
but yes! And the Ouled-Naël dancing-girls, Circassian slaves,
Spanish beauties. . . .</p>
<p> </p>
<p><sup>1</sup> Arab gens d'armes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The first part of the plan failed, for <i>ce vieux sale
cochon</i> of a Jean Boule came along the corridor, struck a
match to light his cigarette, saw the crouching, staring, naked
Ten, and, being a mad Englishman and an accursed dog's-tail,
saved the life of the Sergeant-Major. That the Ten took no
vengeance upon Jean Boule was due to their lack of desire for
combat with the mighty <i>Americain,</i> le Bouckaing Bronceau,
and with those tough and determined fighters, les Légionnaires
Rupert and 'Erbiggin. All four were masters of <i>le boxe,</i>
and, if beaten, knew it not. . . .</p>
<p>The Ten went "on pump" with their wrongs unavenged, save that
Blondin stole the big automatic-pistol of the Sergeant-Major from
its nail on the wall of the orderly-room.</p>
<p>They took their Lebel rifles and bayonets, an accumulated
store of bread and biscuits, water, and, each man, such few
cartridges as he had been able to steal and secrete when on the
rifle-range, or marching with "sharp" ammunition.</p>
<p>Getting away was a matter of very small difficulty; it would
be staying away that would be the trouble. One by one, they went
over the wall of the fort, and hid in ditches, beneath culverts,
or behind cactus-bushes.</p>
<p>At the appointed rendezvous in the <i>village Négre,</i> the
Ten assembled, fell in, and marched off at the <i>pas
gymnastique,</i> Blondin at their head. After travelling for some
hours, with only a cigarette-space halt in every hour, and ere
the stars began to pale, Blondin gave the order "<i>Campez!</i>",
and the little company sank to the ground, cast off accoutrements
and capotes, removed boots, and fell asleep. Before dawn Blondin
woke them and made a brief speech. If they obeyed him implicitly
and faithfully, he would lead them to safety and prosperity; if
any man disobeyed him in the slightest particular, he would shoot
him dead. If he were to be their leader, as they wished, he must
have the promptest and most willing service and subordination
from all. There was a terrible time before them ere they win to
the Promised Land, but there was an infinitely worse one behind
them--so let all who hoped to attain safety and wealth look to it
that his least word be their law.</p>
<p>And the Ten Bad Men, desperate, unscrupulous, their hand
against every man's, knowing no restraint nor law but Expedience,
set forth on their all but hopeless venture, trusting ce cher
Blondin (who intended to clamber from this Slime-pit of Siddim on
their carcases, and had chosen them for their various utilities
to his purpose).</p>
<p>At dawn, Blondin leading, caught sight of a fire as he topped
a ridge, sank to earth, and was at once imitated by the
others.</p>
<p>He issued clear orders quickly, and the band skirmished toward
the fire, <i>en tirailleur,</i> in a manner that would have been
creditable to the Touareg themselves. It was a small Arab
<i>douar,</i> or encampment, of a few <i>felidj</i> (low
camel-hair tents), and a camel-enclosure. Blondin's shot, to kill
the camel-sentry and bring the Arabs running from their tents,
was followed by the steady, independent-firing which disposed of
these unfortunates.</p>
<p>His whistle was followed by the charge, which also disposed of
the remainder and the wounded, and left the Ten in possession of
camels, women, food, weapons, tents, Arab clothing, and money.
Fortune was favouring the brave! But the Ten were now Nine, for,
as they charged, the old sheikh, sick and weak though he was,
fired his long gun into the chest of Karl Anderssen at
point-blank range. . . .</p>
<p>An hour later the <i>djemels</i> were loaded up with what
Blondin decided to take, the women were killed, and the Nine were
again <i>en route</i> for Maroc, enhearted beyond words. There is
a great difference between marching and riding, between carrying
one's kit and being carried oneself, and between having a little
dry bread and having a fine stock of goat-flesh, rice, raisins,
barley, and dates when one is crossing the desert.</p>
<p>In addition to the <i>djemels,</i> the baggage-camels, there
were five <i>mehari</i> or swift riding-camels, and, on four of
these, Monsieur Blondin had mounted the four men he considered
most useful to his purposes--to wit, Jean Kebir, the Berber
half-caste who spoke perfect Arabic as well as the <i>sabir</i>
or lingua-franca of Northern Africa, and knew the Koran by heart;
Hassan Moghrabi, the Moorish negro, who understood camels and
horses; Mohamed the Turk, who also would look very convincing in
native dress; and Jacques Lejaune, who could use a compass and
steer by the stars, and who was a very brave and determined
scoundrel.</p>
<p>When allotting the <i>mehari</i> to these four, after choosing
the best for himself, Blondin, hand on pistol, had looked for any
signs of discontent from Ramon Diego, Fritz Bauer, Fritz
Schlantz, or Georges Grondin, and had found none. Also when he
ordered that each man should cut the throat of his own woman, and
Hassan Moghrabi should dispose of the three superfluous ones, no
man demurred. The Bad Men were the less disposed to refuse to
commit cold-blooded murder because the stories of the tortures
inflicted upon the stragglers and the wounded of the Legion are
horrible beyond words--though not more horrible than the
authentic photographs of the tortured remains of these carved and
jointed victims, that hang, as terrible warnings to deserters, in
every <i>chambrée</i> of the <i>casernes</i> of the Legion. They
killed these women at the word of Blondin--but they knew that the
women would not have been content with the mere killing of
<i>them,</i> had they fallen into the hands of this party of
Arabs.</p>
<p>As, clad in complete Arab dress, they rode away in high
spirits, le bon Monsieur Blondin sang in English, in his droll
way--</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"Ten little Légionnaires<br>
Charging all in line--<br>
A naughty Arab shot one<br>
And then--there were <i>Nine</i>."</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>The Nine rode the whole of that day and, at evening, Blondin
led them into a <i>wadi</i> or canyon, deep enough for
concealment and wide enough for comfort. Here they camped, lit
fires, and Georges Grondin made a right savoury stew of kid,
rice, raisins, barley, dates, and bread in an Arab
<i>couscouss</i> pot. The Nine slept the sleep of the just and,
in the morning, arose and called ce bon Blondin blessed. With
camels, food, cooking-pots, sleeping-rugs, tents, clothing, extra
weapons, and much other useful loot, hope sprang strong as well
as eternal in their more or less human breasts.</p>
<p>Blondin led them on that day until they had made another fifty
miles of westing, and halted at a little oasis where there was a
well, a <i>kuba</i> (or tomb of some marabout or other holy
person), and a small <i>fondouk</i> or caravan rest-house. Jean
Kebir having reconnoitred and declared the <i>fondouk</i> empty,
and the place safe, they watered their camels, occupied the
<i>fondouk,</i> and, after a pleasant evening and a good supper,
slept beneath its hospitable and verminous shelter--four of the
party being on sentry-go, for two hours each, throughout the
night.</p>
<p>At this place, the only human beings they encountered were a
horrible disintegrating lump of disease that hardly ranked as a
human being at all, and an ancient half-witted person who
appeared to combine the duties of verger and custodian of the
<i>kuba</i> with those of caretaker and host of the
<i>fondouk.</i> Him, Jean Kebir drove into the former building
with horrible threats. Fortunately for himself, the aged party
strictly conformed with the orders of Kebir, for Blondin had
given the Berber instructions to dispatch him forthwith to the
joys of Paradise if he were seen outside the tomb. Next day, as
the party jogged wearily along, Blondin heard an exclamation from
Jean Kebir and, turning, saw him rein in his <i>mehara</i> and
stare long and earnestly beneath his hand toward the furthermost
sand-hills of the southern horizon. On one of these, Blondin
could make out a speck. He raised his hand, and the little
cavalcade halted.</p>
<p>"What is it?" he asked of Kebir.</p>
<p>"A Targui scout," was the reply. "We shall be attacked by
Touareg--<i>now</i> if they are the stronger party, to-night in
any case--unless we reach some <i>ksar</i> <sup>1</sup> and take
refuge. . . . That might be more dangerous than waiting for the
Touareg, though."</p>
<p> </p>
<p><sup>1</sup> Fortified village.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"How do you know the man is a Targui?" asked Blondin.</p>
<p>"I do not know <i>how</i> I know, but I <i>do</i> know," was
the reply. "Who else would sit all day motionless on a
<i>mehara</i> on top of a sand-hill but a Targui? The Touareg
system is to camp in a likely place and keep their horses fresh
while a chain of slaves covers a wide area around them. In bush
country they sit up in trees, and in the desert they sit on
camels, as that fellow is doing. Directly they spot anything,
they rush off and warn their masters, who then gallop to the
attack on horseback if they are in overwhelming strength, or wait
until night if they are not."</p>
<p>Even as he spoke the watcher disappeared.</p>
<p>"Push on hard," ordered Blondin, and debated as to whether it
would be better for the <i>mehari</i>-mounted five to desert the
<i>djemel</i>-mounted four and escape, leaving them to their
fate, or to remain, a band of nine determined rifles. Union is
strength, and there is safety in numbers--so he decided that the
speed of the party should be that of the well-flogged
<i>djemels.</i></p>
<p>"Goad them on, <i>mes enfants,"</i> cried he to Diego, Bauer,
Schlantz, and Grondin. "I will never desert you--but you must put
your best leg foremost. We are nine, and they may be ninety or
nine hundred, these <i>sacrés chiens</i> of Touareg." An hour of
hard riding, another--with decreasing anxiety, and suddenly
Blondin's sharp, clear order:</p>
<p><i>"Halte! . . .</i> <i>Formez le carré! . . .</i>
<i>Attention pour les feux de salve!"</i> as, with incredible
rapidity, an avalanche of horsemen appeared over a ridge and bore
down upon them in a cloud of dust, with wild howls of "<i>Allah
Akbar!" . . .</i> "<i>Lah illah il Allah!"</i> and a rising
united chant. "<i>Ul-ul-ul-ul Ullah Akbar."</i></p>
<p>Swiftly the trained legionaries dismounted, knelt their camels
in a ring, took cover behind them, and, with loaded rifles,
awaited their leader's orders. Coolly Blondin estimated the
number of this band of The-Forgotten-of-God, the blue-clad,
Veiled Men of the desert. . . . Not more than twenty or thirty.
They would never have attacked had not their scout taken the
little caravan to be one of traders, some portion of a migrating
tribe, or, perchance, a little gang of smugglers, traders of the
Ouled-Ougouni or the Ouled-Sidi-Sheikhs, or possibly gun-running
Chambaa taking German rifles from Tripoli to Morocco--a rich
prey, indeed, if this were so. Each Chambi would fight like
Ibliss himself though, if Chambaa they were, for such are fiends
and devils, betrayers of hospitality, slayers of guests, defilers
of salt, spawn of Jehannum, who were the sons and fathers of
murderers and liars. Moreover, they would be doubly watchful,
suspicious, and resolute if they, French subjects, were smuggling
German guns across French territory into Morocco under the very
nose of the Bureau Arabe. . . . However, there were but nine of
them, in any case, so <i>Ul-ul-ul-ul-ul Ullah Akbar!</i></p>
<p>"Don't fire till I do--and then at the horses, and don't
miss," shouted Blondin.</p>
<p>The avalanche swept down, and lances were lowered, two-handed
swords raised, and guns and pistols presented--for the Touareg
fire from the saddle at full gallop.</p>
<p>Blondin waited.</p>
<p>Blondin fired. . . . The leading horse and rider crashed to
the ground and rolled like shot rabbits. Eight rifles spoke
almost simultaneously, and seven more men and horses spun in the
dust. At the second volley from the Nine, the Touaregs broke,
bent their horses outward from the centre of the line, and fled.
All save one, who either could not, or would not, check his
maddened horse. Him Blondin shot as his great sword split the
skull of Fritz Bauer, whose poor shooting, for which he was
notorious, had cost him his life.</p>
<p>"<i>Cessez le feu,"</i> cried Blondin, as one or two shots
were fired after the retreating Arabs. "They won't come back, so
don't waste cartridges. . . . See what hero can catch me a
horse."</p>
<p>As he coolly examined the ghastly wound of the dying Fritz
Bauer, he observed to the faithful Jean Kebir "<i>Habet!</i>" and
added--</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"Nine little Légionnaires--<br>
But one fired late<br>
When a Touareg cut at him--<br>
And so there were <i>Eight.</i>"</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>"<i>Eh bien, mon Capitaine?</i>" inquired Kebir.</p>
<p>"<i>N'importe, mon enfant!</i>" smiled Monsieur Blondin, and
turned his attention to the property and effects of the dying
man. . . .</p>
<p>"We shall hear more of these Forsaken-of-God before long,"
observed Jean Kebir when the eight were once more upon their
way.</p>
<p>They did. Just before sunset, as they were silhouetted against
the fiery sky in crossing a sand-hill ridge, there was a single
shot, and Georges Grondin, the cook, grunted, swayed, observed
"<i>Je suis bien touché,</i>" and fell from his camel.</p>
<p>Gazing round, Blondin saw no signs of the enemy. The plain was
empty of life--but there might be hundreds of foemen behind the
occasional aloes, palmettos, and Barbary cacti; crouching in the
<i>driss,</i> or the thickets of lentisks and arbutus and thuyas.
Decidedly a place to get out of. If a party of Touareg had
ambushed them there, they might empty every saddle without
showing a Targui nose. . . .</p>
<p>A ragged volley was fired from the right flank.</p>
<p>"Ride for your lives," he shouted, and set an excellent
example to the other seven.</p>
<p>"What of Grondin?" asked Kebir, bringing his <i>mehara</i>
alongside that of Blondin.</p>
<p>"Let the dead bury their dead," was the reply. (Evidently the
fool had not realized that the <i>raison d'être</i> of this
expedition was to get one, Jean Blondin, safe to Maroc!)</p>
<p>An hour or so later, in a kind of little natural fortress of
stones, boulders, and rocks, they encamped for the night, a sharp
watch being kept. But while Monsieur Blondin slept, Jean Kebir,
who was attached to Georges Grondin, partly on account of his
music and partly on account of his cookery, crept out, an hour or
so before dawn, and stole back along the track, in the direction
from which they had come.</p>
<p>He found his friend at dawn, still alive; but as he had been
neatly disembowelled and the abdominal cavity filled with salt
and sand and certain other things, he did not attempt to move
him. He embraced his cher Georges, bade him farewell, shot him,
and returned to the little camp.</p>
<p>As the cavalcade proceeded on its way, Monsieur Blondin,
stimulated by the brilliance and coolness of the glorious
morning, and by high hopes of escape, burst into song.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"Eight little Légionnaires<br>
Riding from 'ell to 'eaven,<br>
A wicked Targui shot one--<br>
And then there were <i>Seven,</i>"</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-indent: 0em;">improvised he. . . .</p>
<p>Various reasons, shortness of food and water being the most
urgent, made it desirable that they should reach and enter a
small <i>ksar</i> that day.</p>
<p>Towards evening, the Seven beheld what was either an oasis or
a mirage--a veritable eye-feast in any case, after hours of
burning desolate desert, the home only of the hornéd viper, the
lizard, and the scorpion.</p>
<p>It proved to be a small palm-forest, with wells,
irrigating-ditches, cultivation, pigeons, and inhabitants.
Cultivators were hoeing, blindfolded asses were wheeling round
and round <i>noria</i> wells, veiled women with red
<i>babooshes</i> on their feet bore brightly coloured water-vases
on their heads. Whitewashed houses came into view, and the cupola
of an adobe-walled <i>kuba.</i></p>
<p>Jean Kebir was sent on to reconnoitre and prospect, and to use
his judgment as to whether his six companions--good men and true,
under a pious vow of silence--might safely enter the oasis, and
encamp.</p>
<p>While they awaited his return, naked children came running
towards them clamouring for gifts. They found the riders dumb,
but eloquent of gesture--and the gestures discouraging.</p>
<p>Some women brought clothes and commenced to wash them in an
irrigation stream, on some flat stones by a bridge of palm
trunks. The six sat motionless on their camels.</p>
<p>A jet-black Haratin boy brought a huge basket of Barbary figs
and offered it--as a gift that should bring a reward. At a sign
from Blondin, Mohamed the Turk took it and threw the boy a
<i>mitkal.</i></p>
<p>"Salaam," said he.</p>
<p>"<i>Ya, Sidi, Salaam aleikoum,</i>" answered the boy, with a
flash of perfect teeth.</p>
<p>Blondin glared at Mohamed. Could not the son of a camel
remember that the party was dumb--pious men under a vow of
silence? It was their only chance of avoiding discovery and
exposure as accursed Roumis <sup>1</sup> when they were near the
habitations of men.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><sup>1</sup> Europeans.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A burst of music from tom-tom, derbukha, and raita broke the
heavy silence, and then a solo on the raita, the "Voice of the
Devil," the instrument of the provocative wicked note. Some one
was getting born, married, or buried, apparently.</p>
<p>Fritz Schlantz, staring open-mouthed at cyclamens, anemones,
asphodels, irises, lilies, and crocuses between a little cemetery
and a stream, was, for the moment, back in his Tyrolese village.
He shivered. . . .</p>
<p>Jean Kebir returned. He recommended camping on the far side of
the village at a spot he had selected. There were strangers,
heavily armed with yataghans, lances, horse-pistols, flissas, and
<i>moukalas</i> in the <i>fondouk.</i> In addition to the
flint-lock <i>moukalas</i> there were several repeating rifles.
They were all clad in <i>burnous</i> and <i>chechia,</i> and
appeared to be half-trader, half-brigand Arabs of the Tableland,
perhaps Ouled-Ougouni or possibly Aït-Jellal. Anyhow, the best
thing to do with them was to give them a wide berth.</p>
<p>The Seven passed through the oasis and, camping on the other
side, fed full upon the proceeds of Kebir's foraging and
shopping.</p>
<p>That night, Fritz Schlantz was seized with acute internal
pains, and was soon obviously and desperately ill.</p>
<p>"Cholera!" said Monsieur Blondin on being awakened by the
sufferer's cries and groans. "Saddle up and leave him."</p>
<p>Within the hour the little caravan had departed, Jacques
Lejaune steering by the stars. To keep up the spirits of his
followers Monsieur Blondin sang aloud.</p>
<p>First he sang--</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"Des marches d'Afrique<br>
J'en ai pleine le dos.<br>
On y va trop vite.<br>
On n'y boit que de l'eau.<br>
Des lauriers, des victoires,<br>
De ce songe illusoire<br>
Que l'on nomme 'la gloire,'<br>
J'en ai plein le dos,"</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-indent: 0em;">and then <i>Derrière
l'Hôtel-Dieu,</i> and <i>Père Dupanloup en chemin de fer.</i> In
a fine tenor voice, and with great feeling, he next rendered
<i>L'Amour m'a rendu fou,</i> and then, to a tune of his own
composition, sang in English--</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"Seven little Légionnaires<br>
Eating nice green figs,<br>
A greedy German ate too much--<br>
And then there were <i>Six."</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Day after day, and week after week, the legionaries pushed on,
sometimes starving, often thirsty, frequently hunted, sometimes
living like the proverbial <i>coq en pâte,</i> or, as Blondin
said, "Wee peegs in clover," after ambushing and looting a
caravan.</p>
<p>Between Amang and Illigh lie the bones of Jacques Lejaune, who
was shot by Blondin. As they passed out of the dark and gloomy
shade of a great cedar forest, there was a sudden roar, and a
lioness flung herself from a rock upon Lejaune's camel. Lejaune
was leading as the sun had set. Blondin, who was behind him,
fired quickly, and the bullet struck him in the spine and passed
out through his shattered breast-bone. He had been getting
"difficult" and too fond of giving himself airs on the strength
of his navigating ability, and, moreover, Monsieur Blondin had
learnt to steer by the stars, having located the polar star by
means of the Great Bear. Jean Kebir shot the lioness through the
head.</p>
<p>It was a sad "accident" but Blondin had evidently recovered
his spirits by morning, as he was singing again.</p>
<p>He sang--</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"Six little Légionnaires<br>
Still all live,<br>
But one grew indiscipliné--<br>
And then there were <i>Five</i>." . . .</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Distinctly of a <i>galégeade</i> wit and a <i>macabre</i>
humour was Monsieur Blondin, and even as his eye roamed over the
scrubby hill-sides and he thought fondly of the <i>mussugues,</i>
the cistus-scrub hillocks of his dear Provence, he calculated the
total sum of money now divided among the said Five, and reflected
that division, where money is concerned, is deplorable. Also, as
he gazed upon the tracts of thorn that recalled the
<i>argeras</i> of Hyères, he decided that, all things considered,
it would be as well for him to reach Marakesh alone. He
understood the principle of rarity-value, and knew that either
one of two newcomers would not fetch a quarter of the price of a
single newcomer to a war-harassed Sultan whose crying need was
European drill-sergeants and centurions.</p>
<p>Jean Blondin would rise to be a second Kaid McLeod, and would
amass vast wealth to boot. . . .</p>
<p>At Aït-Ashsba, bad luck overtook Ramon Diego. At the
<i>fondouk</i> he smote a burly negro of Sokoto who jostled him.
The negro, one of a band of departing wayfarers, was a master of
the art of <i>rabah,</i> the native version of <i>la</i>
s<i>avate,</i> and landed Ramon a most terrible kick beneath the
breast-bone. As he lay gasping and groaning for breath, the negro
whipped out his razor-edged yataghan and bent over the prostrate
man. Holding aloof, Blondin saw the negro spit on the back of
Ramon Diego's neck, and with his finger draw a line thereon.
Stepping swiftly back, the gigantic black then smote with all his
strength, and the head of Ramon Diego rolled through the doorway
and down the stony slope leading from the <i>fondouk.</i> As the
negro mounted his swift Filali camel, Blondin investigated the
contents of a leather bag which Ramon always wore at the girdle,
beneath his <i>haik.</i> On being told of the mishap, Jean Kebir
was all for pursuit and vengeance. This, Blondin vetoed sternly.
There were now only four of them, and henceforth they must walk
delicately and be <i>miskeen,</i> modest, humble men. Only four
now!</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"Five little Légionnaires,<br>
Each man worth a score;<br>
But a big nigger 'it one--<br>
And then there were <i>Four,</i>"</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-indent: 0em;">sang Monsieur Blondin.</p>
<p>But what a four! Jean Kebir, the genuine local article, more
or less; Hassan Moghrabi, near his native heath and well in the
picture; Mohamed the Turk, a genuine Mussulman, able to enter any
mosque or <i>kuba</i> and display his orthodoxy; and himself, a
pious man hooded to the eyes, under a vow of silence.</p>
<p>In due course, the Four reached the Adrar highlands, and
tasted of the hospitality of this grim spot, with its brigands'
<i>agadirs</i> or castles of stone. A band swooping down upon
them from an <i>agadir</i> (obviously of Ph&oelig;nician origin),
pursued them so closely and successfully, that Mohamed, the worst
mounted, bringing up the rear, was also brought to earth by a
lance-thrust through his back, and ended his career hanging by
the flesh of his thigh from a huge hook which protruded from the
wall above the door of the <i>agadir.</i></p>
<p>Though greatly incensed at the loss of the Turk's camel and
cash, Monsieur Blondin was soon able to sing again.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"Four little Légionnaires<br>
Out upon the spree,<br>
The Adrar robbers caught one--<br>
And soon there were <i>Three</i>," . . .</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-indent: 0em;">he chanted merrily.</p>
<p>As the Three watched some hideous Aïssa dervishes dancing on
glowing charcoal, skewering their limbs and cheeks and tongues,
eating fire, and otherwise demonstrating their virtue one night,
near Bouzen, a <i>djemel,</i> thrusting forth his head and
twisting his snaky neck, neatly removed the right knee-cap of
Hassan Moghrabi, and he was of no further use to Monsieur
Blondin. He was left behind, and died in a ditch some three days
later, of loss of blood, starvation, gangrene, and grief.</p>
<p>Clearly Jean Blondin was reserved for great things. Here were
the Ten reduced to Two, and of those two he was one--and intended
to be the only one when he was safe in Maroc. Singing blithely,
he declared that--</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"Three little Légionnaires<br>
Nearly travelled through,<br>
When a hungry camel ate one--<br>
And now there are but <i>Two</i>." . . .</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>On through the beautiful Adrar, past its forests of arbutus,
lentisk, thuya, figs, pines, and palmettos to its belt of olive
groves, walnut, and almond; on toward Djebel Tagharat, the Lord
of the Peaks, the Two-Headed. On through the Jibali country,
called the "Country of the Gun" by the Arabs, as it produces
little else for visitors, toward the Bled-el-Maghzen, the
"Government's Territory," experiencing many and strange
adventures and hair-breadth escapes. And, all the way, Jean Kebir
served his colleague and leader well, and often saved him by his
ready wit, knowledge of the country and the <i>sabir,</i> and his
good advice.</p>
<p>And in time they reached the gorge of Bab el Jebel, and rode
over a carpet of pimpernels, larkspur, gladioli, hyacinths,
crocuses, wasp-orchids, asphodels, cyclamens, irises and
musk-balsams; and Blondin realized that it was time for Jean
Kebir to die, if he were to ride to Marakesh alone and to inherit
the whole of what remained of the money looted in the
fifteen-hundred-mile journey, that was now within fifteen hours
of its end. . . .</p>
<p>He felt quite sad as he shot the sleeping Jean Kebir that
night, but by morning was able to sing--</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"Two little Légionnaires<br>
Travelling with the sun,<br>
Two was one too many--<br>
So now there is but <i>One,</i>"</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-indent: 0em;">and remarked to his camel,
"'<i>Finis coronat opus,</i>' <i>mon gars</i>." . . .</p>
<p>Even as he caught sight, upon the horizon, of the sea of palms
in which Marakesh is bathed, he was aware of a rush of yelling,
gun-firing, white-clad lunatics bearing down upon him. . . . A
Moorish <i>harka!</i> Was this a <i>lab-el-baroda,</i> a
powder-play game--or what? They couldn't be shooting at <i>him. .
. .</i> What was that Kebir had said? . . . "The Moors are the
natural enemies of the Arabs. We must soon get Moorish garb or
hide"--when . . . a bullet struck his camel and it sprawled
lumberingly to earth. Others threw up spouts of dust. Blondin
sprang to his feet and shouted. Curse the fools for thinking him
an Arab! <i>Oh, for the faithful Jean Kebir to shout to them in
the</i> sabir <i>lingua franca! . . .</i> A bullet struck him in
the chest. Another in the shoulder. He fell.</p>
<p>As the Moors gathered round to slice him in strips with
flissa, yataghan and sword, they found that their prey was
apparently expending his last breath in prayers and pæans to
Allah. He gasped:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"One little Légionnaire,<br>
To provide <i>le bon Dieu</i> fun,<br>
Was killed because he killed his friend--<br>
And now there is <i>None</i>." . . .</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>There was.</p>
<p>Decidedly of a <i>galégeade</i> wit and a <i>macabre</i>
humour to the very last--ce bon Jean Blondin.</p>
<p>"<i>Que voulez-vous? C'est la Légion!</i>" . . .</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c102" id="c102"><i>A La Ninon De
L'Enclos</i></a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>It was one of La Cigale's good days, and the poor
"Grasshopper" was comparatively sane. He was one of the most
remarkable men in the French Foreign Legion in that he was a
perfect soldier, though a perfect lunatic for about thirty days
in the month. When not a Grasshopper (or a Japanese lady, a Zulu,
an Esquimau dog or a Chinese mandarin) he was a cultured
gentleman of rare perception, understanding, and sympathy. He had
been an officer in the Belgian Corps of Guides, and military
attaché at various courts. . . .</p>
<p>From a neighbouring group talking to Madame la Cantinière, in
the canteen, came the words, clearly heard, "<i>Ah! Oui! Oui!
Dans la Rue des Tournelles</i>." . . .</p>
<p>"Now, why should the words 'Rue des Tournelles' bring me a
distinct vision of the Café Marsouins in Hanoï by the banks of
the Red River in Tonkin?" asked the Grasshopper a minute later,
in English.</p>
<p>"Can't tell you, Cigale; there is no such <i>rue</i> in
Hanoï," replied Jean Boule.</p>
<p>"No, <i>mon ancien,</i>" agreed the Grasshopper, "but there
was Fifi Fifinette's place. Aha! I have it!"</p>
<p>"Then give us a bit of it, Cocky," put in 'Erb (le Légionnaire
'Erbiggin--one, Herbert Higgins from Hoxton).</p>
<p>"Yep--down by the factory, near Madame Ti-Ka's joint, it
were," observed the Bucking Bronco.</p>
<p>"Aha! I have it. I remember me why the words 'Rue des
Tournelles' reminded me all suddenly of the Café Marsouins in
Hanoï," continued the Grasshopper. "It was there that I heard
from Old Dubeque the truth of the story of Ninon Dürlonnklau, who
was Fifi Fifinette's predecessor. She was a reincarnation of
Ninon de l'Enclos, and of course Ninon dwelt in the Rue des
Tournelles in Old Paris a few odd centuries back."</p>
<p>"Did they call the gal Neenong de Longclothes because she wore
tights, Ciggy?" inquired 'Erb.</p>
<p>"Put me wise to Neenong's little stunts before I hit it for
the downy," <sup>1</sup> requested the Bucking Bronco.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><sup>1</sup> Go to bed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Ninon de l'Enclos was a lady of the loveliest and frailest,"
said the Grasshopper. "Oh! but of a charm. <i>Ravissante!</i> She
was, in her time, the well-beloved of Richelieu, Captain St.
Etienne, the Marquis de Sevigné, Condé, Moissins, the Duc de
Navailles, Fontennelle, Des Yveteaux, the Marquis de Villarceaux,
St. Evrémonde, and the Abbé Chaulieu. On her eightieth birthday
she had a devout and impassioned lover. On her eighty-fifth
birthday the good Abbé wrote to her, 'Cupid has retreated into
the little wrinkles round your undimmed eyes.'". . .</p>
<p>"<i>Some</i> girl," opined the Bucking Bronco.</p>
<p>"And she lived in the Rue des Tournelles, and so the mention
of that street called the Café Marsouins of Hanoï in Tonkin to my
mind (for there did I hear the truth of the fate of Ninon
Dürlonnklau, the predecessor of Fifi Fifinette whom some of us
here knew). . . .</p>
<p>"And the chevalier de Villars, the son of Ninon de l'Enclos,
was her lover also, not knowing that Ninon was his mother, nor
she that de Villars was her son--until too late. Outside her door
a necromancer prophesied the death of de Villars to his face. An
hour later Ninon knew by a birth-mark that de Villars was her
son, and cried aloud, 'You are my son!' So he fulfilled the
prophecy of the necromancer. He drove his dagger through his
throat--just where this birth-mark was. What you call
<i>mole,</i> eh? . . . Shame and horror? No . . . Love. They who
loved Ninon de l'Enclos <i>loved.</i> Her arms or those of death.
No other place for a lover of Ninon. You Anglo-Saxons could
<i>never</i> understand. . . .</p>
<p>"And in Hanoï lived her reincarnation, Ninon Dürlonnklau,
supposed to be the daughter of one Dürlonnklau, a German of the
Legion, and of a perfect flower of a Lao woman. And, mind you,
<i>mes amis,</i> there is nothing in the human form more lovely
than a beautiful Lao girl from Upper Mekong.</p>
<p>"And <i>this</i> Ninon! Beautiful? Ah, my friends--there are
no words. Like yourselves, I seek not the bowers of lovers--but I
have the great love of beauty, and I have seen Ninon Dürlonnklau.
Would I might have seen Ninon de l'Enclos that I might judge if
she were one half so lovely and so fascinating. And when I first
beheld the Dürlonnklau she was no <i>jeune fille. . .</i> .</p>
<p>"She had been the well-beloved of governors, generals, and
officials and officers--and there had been catastrophes,
scandals, suicides . . . the usual <i>affaires</i>--before she
became the hostess of legionaries, marsouins,<sup>1</sup>
sailors. . . .</p>
<p> </p>
<p><sup>1</sup> Colonial infantry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"She had herself not wholly escaped the tragedy and grief that
followed in her train, for at the age of seventeen she had a son,
and that son was kidnapped when at the age that a babe takes the
strongest grip upon a mother's heart and love and life. . . . And
after a madness of grief and a long illness, she plunged the more
recklessly into the pursuit of that pleasure and joy that must
ever evade the children of pleasure, <i>les filles de
joie.</i>"</p>
<p>'Erb yawned cavernously.</p>
<p>"Got a gasper, Farver?" he inquired of John Bull.</p>
<p>The old soldier produced a small packet of vile black Algerian
cigarettes from his <i>képi,</i> without speaking.</p>
<p>"Quit it, Dub!" snapped the deeply interested Bucking Bronco.
"<i>Pro</i>duce silence, and then some, or beat it."
<sup>1</sup></p>
<p> </p>
<p><sup>1</sup> Go away.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Awright, Bucko," mocked the unabashed 'Erb, imitating the
American's nasal drawl and borrowing from his vocabulary. "You
ain't got no call ter git het up none, thataway. Don't yew git
locoed an rip-snort--'cos I guess I don' stand fer it, any."</p>
<p>"Stop it, 'Erb," said John Bull, and 'Erb stopped it. There
would be trouble between these two one hot day. . . .</p>
<p>"The Legion appropriated her to itself at last," continued the
Grasshopper, "and picketed her house. Marsouins, sailors,
<i>pékins</i> <sup>1</sup>--all ceased to visit her. It was more
than their lives were worth, and there were pitched battles when
whole <i>escouades</i> of <i>ces autres</i> tried to get in,
before it was clearly understood that Ninon belonged to the
Legion. And this was meat and drink to Ninon. She loved to be La
Reine de la Légion Étrangère. This was not Algiers, mark you, and
she had been born and bred in Hanoï. She had not that false
perspective that leads the women of the West to prefer those of
other Corps to the sons of La Légion. And there were one or two
moneyed men hiding in our ranks just then. She loved one for a
time and then another for a time, and frequently the previous one
would act rashly. Some took their last exercise in the Red River.
An unpleasant stream in which to drown.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><sup>1</sup> Civilians.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Then came out, in a new draft, young Villa, supposed to be of
Spanish extraction--but he knew no Spanish. I think he was the
handsomest young devil I have ever seen. He had coarse black hair
that is not of Europe, wild yellow eyes, and a curious, almost
gold complexion. He was a strange boy, and of a temperament
decidedly, and he loved flowers as some women do--especially
ylang-ylang, jasmine, magnolia, and those of sweet and sickly
perfume. He said they stirred his blood, and his prenatal
memories. . . .</p>
<p>"And one night old Dubeque took him to see La Belle
Dürlonnklau.</p>
<p>"As he told it to me I could see all that happened, for old
Dubeque had the gift of speech, imagination, and the instinct of
the drama. . . . Old Dubeque--the drunken, depraved scholar and
<i>gentilhomme.</i></p>
<p>"Outside her door a begging soothsayer whined to tell their
fortunes. It was the Annamite New Year, the Thêt, when the native
<i>must</i> get money somehow for his sacred jollifications. This
fellow stood making the humble <i>lai</i> or prolonged salaam,
and at once awoke the interest of young Villa, who tossed him a
piastre.</p>
<p>"Old Dubeque swears that, as he grabbed it, this <i>diseur de
bonne aventure,</i> a scoundrel of the Delta, said, 'Missieu
French he die to-night,' or words to that effect in
pigeon-French, and Villa rewarded the Job-like Annamite with a
kick. . . . They went in. . . .</p>
<p>"As they entered the big room where were the Mekong girls and
Madame Dürlonnklau, the boy suddenly stopped, started, stared,
and stood with open mouth gazing at La Belle Ninon. He had eyes
for no one else. She rose from her couch and came towards him,
her face lit up and exalted. She led him to her couch and they
talked. Love at first sight! <i>Love</i> had come to that
so-experienced woman; to that wild <i>farouche</i> boy. Later
they disappeared into an inner room. . . .</p>
<p>"Old Dubeque called for a bottle of wine, and drank with some
of the girls.</p>
<p>"He does not know how much later it was that the murmur of
voices in Madame's room ceased with a shriek of '<i>Mon
fils,</i>' a horrid, terrific scream, and the sound of a
fall.</p>
<p>"Old Dubeque was not so drunk but what this sobered him. He
entered the room.</p>
<p>"Young Villa had fulfilled the prophecy of the necromancer. He
had driven his bayonet through his throat--just where a large
birthmark was. What you call <i>mole,</i> eh? It was exposed when
his shirt-collar was undone. . . . Ninon Dürlonnklau lived long,
may be still alive--anyhow, I know she lived long--in a <i>maison
de santé.</i> Yes--a reincarnation. . . .</p>
<p>"That is of what the words <i>la Rue de Tournelles</i>

<h1><a name="c103" id="c103"><i>An Officer And--A
Liar</i></a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>Little Madame Gallais was always a trifle inclined to the
occult, to spiritualism, and to dabbling in the latest thing
psychic and metaphysical. At home, in Marseilles, she was a
prominent member and bright particular star of a <i>Cercle</i>
which was, in effect, a Psychical Research Society. She
complained that one of the drawbacks of accompanying her husband
on Colonial service was isolation from these so interesting
pursuits and people.</p>
<p>Successful and flourishing occultism needs an atmosphere, and
it is difficult for a solitary crier in the wilderness to create
one. However, Madame Gallais did her best. She could, and would,
talk to you of your subliminal self, your subconscious ego, your
true psyche, your astral body, and of planes. On planes she was
quite at home. She would ask gay and sportive
<i>sous-lieutenants,</i> fresh from the boulevards of Paris, as
to whether they were mediumistic, or able to achieve clairvoyant
trances. It is to be recorded that, at no dance, picnic,
garden-party, "fiv' o'clock," or dinner did she encounter a
French officer who confessed to being mediumistic or able to
achieve clairvoyant trances.</p>
<p>Nor was big, fat Adjudant-Major Gallais any better than the
other officers of the Legion and the <i>Infanterie de la
Marine</i> and the <i>Tirailleurs Tonkinois</i> who formed the
circle of Madame's acquaintance in Eastern exile. No--on the
contrary, he distinctly inclined to the materialistic, and
preferred red wines to blue-stockings--(not blue silk stockings,
<i>bien entendu).</i> For mediums and ghost-seers he had an
explosive and jeering laugh. For vegetarians he had a contempt
and pity that no words could express.</p>
<p>A teetotaller he regarded as he did a dancing dervish.</p>
<p>He had no use for ascetics and self-deniers, holding them mad
or impious.</p>
<p>No, it could not be said that Madame's husband was mediumistic
or able to achieve clairvoyant trances, nor that he was a tower
of strength and a present help to her in her efforts to create
the atmosphere which she so desired.</p>
<p>When implored to gaze with her into the crystal, he declared
that he saw things that brought the blush of modesty to the cheek
of Madame.</p>
<p>When begged to take a hand at "planchette" writing, he caused
the innocent instrument to write a naughty <i>guinguette</i>
rhyme, and to sign it Eugénie Yvette Gallais.</p>
<p>When besought to witness the wonders of some fortuneteller,
seer, astrologer or <i>yogi,</i> he put him to flight with
fearful grimaces and gesticulations.</p>
<p>And this was a great grief unto Madame, for she loved
astrologers and fortune-tellers in spite of all, or rather of
nothing. And yet <i>malgré</i> the fat Adjudant-Major's cynicism
and hardy scepticism, the very curious and undeniable fact
remained, that Madame had the power to influence his dreams. She
could, that is to say, make him dream of her, and could appear to
him in his dreams and give him messages. The Adjudant-Major
admitted as much, and thus there is no question as to the fact.
(Indeed, when Madame died in Marseilles many years later, he
announced the fact to us in Algeria, more than forty-eight hours
before he received confirmation of what he knew to be the truth
of his dream.)</p>
<p>Two people less alike than the gallant Adjudant-Major and his
wife you could not find. Perhaps that is why they loved each
other so devotedly.</p>
<p>"I wonder if my boy will be mediumistic," murmured little
Madame Gallais, as she hung fondly over the cot in which reposed
little Edouard André. "Oh, to be able to hold communion with him
when we are parted and I am in the spirit-world."</p>
<p>"Give the little <i>moutard</i> plenty of good meat," said the
big man. "We want <i>le petit Gingembre</i> to be a
heavyweight--a born and bred cuirassier." . . .</p>
<p>"<i>Mon ange,</i> do you see any reason why twin souls, united
in the bonds of purest love and closest relationship, should not
be able to communicate quite freely when far apart?" Madame
Gallais would reply.</p>
<p>"Save postage, in effect?" grinned the Adjudant-Major.</p>
<p>"I mean by medium of rappings, 'planchette,' dreams--if not by
actual appearance and communication in spirit guise?"</p>
<p>"Spirit guys?" queried the stronger and thicker vessel.</p>
<p>"Yes, my soul, spirit guise."</p>
<p>"Oh, ah, yes. . . . Better not let me catch the young devil in
spirit guise, or I'll teach him to stick to good wine and carry
it like a gentleman. . . . He must learn his limit. . . . How
soon do you think we could put him into neat little
riding-breeches? . . . Cavalry for him. . . . Not but what the
Legion is the finest regiment in the world. . . . Still
Cuirassiers for him."</p>
<p>"My Own! Let the poor sweet angel finish with his first
petticoats before we talk of riding-breeches. . . . And how,
pray, would the riding-breeches accord with his so-beautiful long
curls. They would not, <i>mon ange, n'est ce pas?</i>" . . .</p>
<p>"No--but surely the curls can be cut off in a very few
moments, can't they?" argued the Major, with the conscious
superiority of the logical sex.</p>
<p>But she, of the sex that needs no logic, only smiled and
replied that she would project herself into her son's dreams
every night of his life.</p>
<p>And in the fulness of time, Edouard André having arrived at
boy's estate, the curse of the Colonial came upon little Madame
Gallais, and she had to take her son home to France and leave him
there with her heart and her health and her happiness. She, in
her misery, could conceive of only one fate more
terrible--separation from her large, dull husband, whom she
adored for his strength, placidity, courage, adequacy, and, above
all, because he adored her. Separation from him would be death,
and she preferred the half-death of separation from <i>le petit
Gingembre.</i></p>
<p>She wrote daily to him on her return to Indo-China--printing
the words large and clear for his easier perusal and, at the end
of each weekly budget, she added a postscript asking him whether
he dreamed of mother often. She also wrote to her own mother by
every mail, each letter containing new and fresh suggestions for
his mental, moral, and physical welfare, in spite of the fact
that the urchin already received the entire devotion, care, and
love of the little household at Marseilles.</p>
<p>Their unceasing, ungrudging devotion, care and love, however,
did not prevent a gentle little breeze from springing up one
summer evening, from bulging the bedroom window-curtain across
the lighted gas-jet, and from acting as the first cause of poor
little Edouard André being burnt to death in his bed, before a
soul was aware that the tall, narrow house was on fire.</p>
<p>Big Adjudant-Major Gallais was in a terrible quandary and knew
not what to do. He had but little imagination, but he had a
mighty love for his wife--and she was going stark, staring mad
before his haggard eyes. . . . And, if she died, he was going to
take ship from Saigon and just disappear overboard one dark
night, quietly and decently, like a gentleman, with neither mess,
fuss, nor post-mortem <i>enquête.</i></p>
<p>But there was just a ghost of a chance, a shadow of a
hope--this "planchette" notion that had come to him suddenly in
the dreadful sleepless night of watching. . . . It could not make
things worse--and it might bring relief, the relief of tears. If
she could weep she could sleep. If she could sleep she could
live, perhaps--and the Major swallowed hard, coughed fiercely,
and scrubbed his bristly head violently with both big hands.</p>
<p>It would be a lying fraud and swindle; but what of that if it
might save her life and reason--and he was prepared to forge a
cheque, cheat at cards, or rob a blind Chinese beggar of his last
<i>sabuk,</i> to give her a minute's comfort, rest, and peace. .
. . For clearly she must weep or die, sleep or die, unless she
were to lose her reason--and while she was in an asylum he could
not take that quiet dive overboard so that they could all be
together again in the keeping and peace of <i>le bon Dieu. . .
.</i> Rather death than madness, a thousand times. . . . But if
she died and he took steps to follow her--was there not some talk
about suicides finding no place in Heaven?</p>
<p><i>Peste!</i> What absurdity! For surely <i>le bon Père</i>
had as much sense of fair-play and mercy as a battered old
soldier-man of La Légion? But it had not come to that yet. The
Legion does not surrender--and the Adjudant-Major of the First
Battalion of The Regiment had still a <i>ruse de guerre</i> to
try against the enemy. He would do his best with this
"planchette" swindle, and play it for what it was worth. While
there is life there is hope, and he had been in many a tight
place before, and fought his way out.</p>
<p>To think of Edouard André Lucien Gallais playing with
"planchette"! She had often begged him to join hands with her on
its ebony board, and to endeavour to "get into communication"
with the spirits of the departed--but he had always acted the
<i>farceur.</i></p>
<p>"Ask the sacred thing to tip us the next Grand Prix winner,"
he had said, or "But, yes--I would question the kind spirits as
to the address of the pretty girl I saw at the station
yesterday," and then he would cause the innocent machine to say
things most unspiritual. Well--now he would see what sort of
lying cheat he could make of himself. To lie is not
gentlemanly--but to save life and reason is. If to lie is to
blacken the soul--let the soul of Adjudant-Major Gallais be black
as the blackest <i>ibn Eblis,</i> if thereby an hour's peace
might descend upon the tortured soul of his wife. The good Lord
God would understand a gentleman--being one Himself.</p>
<p>And the Major, large, heavy, and slow-witted, entered his
wife's darkened room, and crept toward the bed whereon she lay,
dry-eyed, talking aloud and monotonously.</p>
<p>". . . To play such a trick on me! May Heaven reward those who
play tricks. Of course, it is a hoax--but why does not mother
cable back that there never was any fire at all, and that she
knows nothing about the telegram? . . . How could <i>le petit
Gingembre</i> be dead, when there he is, in the photo, smiling at
me so prettily, and looking so strong and well? What a fool I am!
Anyone can play tricks on me. People <i>do. . . .</i> I shall
tell my husband. He would never play a trick on me, nor allow
such a thing. . . . A trick! A hoax! . . . Of course, one can
judge nothing from the handwriting of a telegram. Anybody could
forge one. A letter would be so difficult to forge. . . . The
sender of that wicked cable said to himself, 'Madame Gallais
cannot pretend that the message does not come from her mother on
grounds of the handwriting being different from that of her
mother--because the writing is never that of the sender, but that
of the telegraph-clerk. She will be deceived and think that her
mother has really sent it.' . . . How unspeakably cruel and
wicked! No, a letter could not be forged, and that is why there
is no letter. Let them wait until my husband can get at them.
<i>Mon petit Gingembre!</i> And it is his birthday in a month. .
. . What shall I get for him? I cannot make up my mind. One
cannot get just what one wants out here, and if one sends the
money for something to be bought at Home, it is not the same
thing--it does not seem to the child as though his parents sent
it at all. How lucky I am to have mother to leave him to. She
simply worships him, and he couldn't have a happier time, nor
better treatment, if I were there myself. No--that's just it--the
happier a child is the less it needs you, and you wouldn't have
it unhappy so that it <i>did</i> want you. How the darling will .
. ." and then again rose the awful wailing cry as consciousness
of the terrible truth, the cruel loss, the horrible fate, and the
sensation of utter impotence of the bereaved, surged over the
wearied, failing brain. She must cry or die.</p>
<p>The Major sat beside her and gently patted her, in his dull
yearning to help, to relieve the dreadful agony, to do
something.</p>
<p>A gust of rebellious rage shook him, and he longed to fight
and to kill. Why was he smitten thus, and why was there no
tangible opponent at whom he could rush, and whom he could hew
and hack and slay? He rose to his feet, with clenched fists
uplifted and purpling face.</p>
<p>"Be calm," he said, and took a hold upon himself.</p>
<p>Useless to attempt to fight Fate or the Devil or whatever it
was that struck you from behind like this, stabbed you in the
back, turned life to dust and ashes. . . . He must grin and bear
it like a man. Like a man--and what of the woman?</p>
<p>"He's happy now, <i>petit,</i> our <i>petit Gingembre,</i>"
said the poor wretch.</p>
<p>"He's just a jolly little angel, having a fête-day of a time.
He's not weeping and unhappy. Not he, <i>peaudezébie!</i>"</p>
<p>"Burning!" screamed the woman. "My baby is burning! My
<i>petit Gingembre</i> is burning, and no one will help him. . .
. My baby is burning and Heaven looks on! Oh,
mother!--Annette!--Marie!--Grégoire! rush up to the bedroom! . .
. Quick--he is burning! The curtain is on fire. The blind has
caught. . . . The dressing-table is alight. . . . The blind has
fallen on the bed. His pillow is smouldering. He is suffocating.
The bed is on fire . . ." and scream followed heartrending
scream.</p>
<p>The stricken husband seized the woman's hands and kissed
them.</p>
<p>"No, <i>petit,</i> he never woke. He never felt anything. He
just passed away to <i>le bon Dieu</i> in his sleep, without pain
or fright, or anything. He just died in his sleep. There is no
pain at all about that sort of suffocation, you know," he
said.</p>
<p>"Oh, if I could but think so!" moaned the woman. "If I could
only for a moment think so! . . . Burning to death and screaming
for mother. . . . Edouard! Shoot me--shoot me! Or let me . .
."</p>
<p>"See, Beloved of my Soul," urged her husband, gently shaking
her. "I do solemnly swear that I know he was not hurt in the
least. He never woke. I happen to know it. I am not saying it to
comfort you. I <i>know</i> it."</p>
<p>"How could you know, Edouard? . . . Oh, my little baby, my
little son! Oh, wake me from this awful <i>cauchemar,</i>
Edouard. Say I am dreaming and am going to wake."</p>
<p>"The little chap's gone, darling, but he went easy, and he's
well out of this cursed world, anyhow. He'll never have suffering
and unhappiness. . . . And he had such a happy little life." . .
.</p>
<p>Then, for the first time in his career, the Major waxed
eloquent, and, for the first time in his life, lied fluently and
artistically. "I wonder if you'll believe me if I tell you how I
<i>know</i> he wasn't hurt," he continued. "It's the truth, you
know. I wouldn't lie to you, would I?"</p>
<p>"No, you wouldn't deceive me, and you haven't the wit if you
would," replied his wife.</p>
<p>"No, dearest, that's just it. I wouldn't and couldn't, as you
say. Well, look here, last night the little chap appeared to me.
<i>Le petit Gingembre</i> himself! Faith of a gentleman, he did.
. . . I may have been asleep, but he appeared to me as plain as
you are now. . . . As pretty, I mean," he corrected with a heavy,
anxious laugh and pat, peering into the drawn and disfigured face
to see if his words reached the distraught mind, "and he said,
'Father, I want to speak to mother, and she cannot hear because
she cries out and screams and sobs. It makes me so wretched that
I cannot bear it.'"</p>
<p>The man moistened parched lips with a leathery tongue.</p>
<p>"And he said, 'Tell her I was not hurt a little bit--not even
touched by the flames. I just slept on, and knew nothing. . . .
And I couldn't be happy, even in Heaven, while she grieves
so.'"</p>
<p>The woman turned to him.</p>
<p>"Edouard, you are lying to me--and I am grateful to you. It is
as terrible for you as for me," and she beat her forehead with
clenched fists.</p>
<p>"Eugénie!" cried her husband. "Do you call me a liar!
<i>Me?</i> Did I not give you my word of honour?"</p>
<p>"Aren't you lying, Edouard? <i>Aren't</i> you? . . . Don't
deceive me, Edouard André Gallais!" and she seized his wrist in a
grip that hurt him.</p>
<p>"I take my solemn oath I am not lying," lied the Major.
"Heaven smite me if I am. I swear I am speaking the absolute
truth. <i>Nom de nom de Dieu!</i> Would I lie to you?"</p>
<p>He must convince her while she had the sanity to understand
him. . . . "I believe you, Edouard. You are not deceiving me. Oh,
thank God! I humbly thank the good merciful Father. And it
was--it was--a real and actual communication, Edouard--and
vouchsafed to you, the scoffer at spirit communication."</p>
<p>"Yes, but that's not all, my Eugénie. The little chap said, 'I
cannot come to mother while she cries out and moans. Tell her to
talk with me by "planchette," you joining with her.' He did,"
lied the Major.</p>
<p>"Oh! Oh! Edouard! Quick! Where is it? . . . Oh, my baby!"
cried Madame Gallais, rising and rushing to a cabinet from which
she produced a heart-shaped ebony board some ten inches long and
six broad, having at the wide end two legs, an inch or so in
length terminating in two swivelled ivory wheels, and, at the
other end, a pencil of the same length as the legs.</p>
<p>Seating herself at her writing-table, she placed the
instrument on a large sheet of paper, while her husband brought a
chair to her side.</p>
<p>Both placed their hands lightly on the broad part of the board
and awaited results.</p>
<p>The pencil did not stir.</p>
<p>Minute after minute passed.</p>
<p>The Adjudant-Major was a cunning man of war, and he was using
all his cunning now.</p>
<p>The woman uttered a faint moan as the tenth minute ebbed
away.</p>
<p>"Patience, Sweetheart," said he. "It's worth a fair trial and
a little patience, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Patience!" was the scornful reply. "I'll sit here till I
die--or I'll hear from my boy. . . . You <i>didn't</i> lie to me,
Edouard?"</p>
<p>The pencil stirred--stirred, moved, and stopped.</p>
<p>The woman groaned.</p>
<p>The pencil stirred again. Then it moved--moved and wrote
rapidly, improving in pace and execution as the Major gained
practice in pushing it without giving the slightest impression of
using "undue influence."</p>
<p>His wife firmly and fanatically believed that the spirit of
her child was actually present and utilizing, through their
brains, the muscles of their arms, to convey to the paper the
message it could neither speak nor write itself.</p>
<p>Presently the pencil ceased to move, and, after another period
of patient waiting, the stricken mother took the paper from
beneath the instrument and read the "message" of the queer,
wavering writing, feeble, unpunctuated, and fantastic, but quite
legible, although conjoined.</p>
<p>"My Dearest Maman," it ran. "Why do you grieve so for me and
make me so unhappy? How can I be joyous when you are sad? Let me
be happy by being happy yourself. I cannot come to you while you
mourn. Be glad, and let me be glad and then you must be more
happy still, because I am happy. I never felt any pain at all. I
just awoke to find myself here, where all would be joy for me,
except for your grief. I have left a world of pain, to wait a
little while for you where we shall be together in perfect
happiness for ever. Let me be happy, dearest Maman, by being
resigned, and then happy, yourself. When you are at peace I can
come to you always in your dreams, and we can talk together. Give
me happiness at once, darling Mother. Please do. Your <i>Petit
Gingembre</i>". . . which was not a bad effort for an
unimaginative and dull-witted man.</p>
<p>He had his instant reward, for on finishing the reading of the
"message," Madame Gallais threw her arms round his neck and burst
into tears--the life-giving, reason-saving, blessed relief of
tears.</p>
<p>An hour later she slept, for the first time in five days,
holding her husband's big hand as he sat by her bed.</p>
<p>When she stirred and relinquished it, the next morning, the
Major arose and went out.</p>
<p>"What a sacred liar I am!" quoth he. "Garçon, bring me an
<i>apéritif."</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is notorious what a tangled web we weave when first we
practise to deceive. And Major Gallais practised hard. Two and
three and four times daily did he manufacture "messages" from the
dead child, and strive, with his heart in his mouth, to make the
successful cheat last until the first wild bitterness of his
wife's grief had worn off.</p>
<p>His hair went grey in the course of a month.</p>
<p>The mental strain of invention, the agony of rasping his own
cruel wound by this mockery--for he had loved <i>le petit
Gingembre</i> as much as the child's mother had done--and the
constant terror lest some unconvincing expression or some
unguarded pressure on the "planchette" should betray him, were
more exhausting and wearing than two campaigns against the
"pirates" of Yen Thé.</p>
<p>But still he had his reward, for his wife's sane grief, heavy
though it was and cruel, was a very different thing from the mad
abandonment and wild insanity of those dreadful days before he
had his great idea.</p>
<p>Many and frequent still were the dreadful throes of weeping
and rebellions against Fate--but "planchette" could always bring
distraction and comfort to the tortured mind, and the soothing
belief in real presence and a genuine communion.</p>
<p>But there was no anodyne for the man's bitter grief, and the
"planchette" became a hideous nightmare to him. Even his work was
no salvation to him, for though the <i>Adjudant-Major</i> is a
regimental staff officer, corresponding somewhat to our
Adjutant--(the "Adjudant" is a non-com. in the French army)--and
a very busy man, Gallais found that his routine duties were
performed mechanically, and by one side of his brain as it were,
while, undimmed, in the fore-front of his mind, blazed the
baleful glare of a vast "planchette," in the flames of which his
little son roasted and shrieked.</p>
<p>And still the daily tale of "messages" must be invented, and
daily grew a greater and more distressing burden and terror.</p>
<p>How much longer could he go on, day after day, and several
times a day, producing fresh communications, conversations,
messages, ideas? How much longer could he go on inventing
plausible and satisfactory answers to the questions that his wife
put to the "spirit" communicant? How could Adjudant-Major Gallais
of La Légion Étrangère describe Heaven and the environment,
conditions, habits, conduct and conversations of the inhabitants
of the Beyond? How much longer would he be able to use the jargon
of his wife's books on Occultism and Spiritualism, study them as
he might, without rousing her suspicions? The swindle could not
have lasted a day had she not been only too anxious to believe,
and only too ready to be deceived.</p>
<p>What would be the end of it all? What would his wife do if she
found out that he had cheated her? Would she ever forgive him?
Would she leave him? Would the shock of the disappointment kill
her? Would she ever believe him again?</p>
<p>What <i>could</i> the end of it be?</p>
<p>He must stick it out--for life, if need be--and he was not an
imaginative man.</p>
<p>What would be the end?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The end was--that she felt she must go home to France and see
her boy's grave, tend it, pray by it, and give such comfort as
she could to her poor mother, almost as much to be pitied as
herself.</p>
<p>Gallais encouraged the idea. The change would be good for her,
and he would be able to join her in a few months. Also this
terrible "planchette" strain would cease for him, and he might
recover his sleep and appetite. . . .</p>
<p>"To think that we shall be parted, this time to-morrow, my
dearest Edouard," wept Madame Gallais, as they sat side by side
in their bed-sitting-room, in the <i>Hôtel de la République</i>
at Saigon. "I on the sea and you on your way back alone. If
everything were not arranged, I would not go. Let us have a last
'planchette' with our son, and get to bed. We are having <i>petit
déjeuner</i> at five, you know."</p>
<p>The Major racked his brain for something to write, as Madame
went to her dressing-case for the little instrument (to the
Major, an instrument of torture)--racked his brain for something
he had not said before, and racked in vain. He grew hotter and
hotter and broke into a profuse perspiration as she seated
herself beside him. <i>Nom de nom de Dieu de Dieu de sort!</i>
What could he write? Why had his brain ceased to operate?</p>
<p><i>Nombril de Belzébuth!</i> Could he not make up one more lie
after carrying on for weeks--weeks during which his waking
hours--riding, drilling, marching along the muddy causeways
between the rice-fields, working in his office, inspecting,
eating, and drinking--had been devoted to hatching "messages,"
conversations, communications and lies, till he had lost health,
weight, sleep, and appetite. . . .</p>
<p>No. . . . He could not write a single word, for his mind was
absolutely blank.</p>
<p>Minutes passed.</p>
<p>Sweating, cursing, and praying, the unfortunate man sat in an
agony of misery, and could not write a single word.</p>
<p>Would not <i>le bon Dieu</i> help him? Just this one last
time? . . .</p>
<p>Minutes passed.</p>
<p>Not to have saved his life, not to have saved the life of his
wife, not to have brought back <i>le petit Gingembre,</i> could
the poor tortured wretch have written a single word. . . . What
would his wife do when she discovered the cheat--for if no words
came during the next minute or two he knew he must spring to his
feet, make full confession, and throw himself upon his wife's
mercy.</p>
<p>That or go mad.</p>
<p>What would she do? . . . Leave him for ever? . . . Spit upon
him and call him "Liar," "Cheat," and "Heartless, cruel
villain"?</p>
<p>Would the dreadful reaction and shock kill her?--deprive her
of reason?</p>
<p>Suddenly he perceived that, with hands which were acres in
extent, he was endeavouring to move a "planchette" the size of
Indo-China--a "planchette" that was red-hot and of which the fire
burnt into his brain. Its smoke and fumes were choking him; its
fierce white light was blinding him; the thing was killing
him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By the time, several weeks later, that little Madame Gallais
had nursed her husband back to sanity and consciousness, the
first bitterness of grief was past and she herself could play the
comforter.</p>
<p>"Oh, my Edouard," she wept upon his shoulder when first the
brain-fever left him and he knew her, "we have lost our little
Gingembre--but you have me, and, oh, my brave hero-husband, I
have you. I shall weep no more." . . .</p>
<p>"Planchette" stands on Madame's desk--but she does not use
it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c104" id="c104"><i>The Deserter</i></a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>As she stood on the deck beside her lover-husband and gazed
upon the thrillingly beautiful panorama of Marseilles, there was
assuredly no happier woman in the world. As he looked at the rapt
face and wide-opened glorious eyes of the lovely girl beside him
there can scarcely have been a man as happy.</p>
<p>They had been married in England a week earlier, were on their
way to his vast house and vaster estate in Australia, and had
come round by sea, instead of suffering the miseries of the
"special" across France (which saves a week to leave-expired
returning Anglo-Indians).</p>
<p>Happy! Her happiness was almost a pain. As a child she had
childishly adored him; and now he had returned from his
wanderings, after a decade of varied, strenuous life--to adore
her. Life was too impossibly, hopelessly wonderful and beautiful.
. . . He, who had been everywhere, done everything, been
everything--soldier, sailor, rancher, planter, prospector,
hunter, explorer--had come Home for a visit, and laid his heart
at the feet of a country mouse. Happy! His happiness frightened
him. After more than ten years of the roughest of roughing it, he
had "made good" (exceeding good), and on top of good fortune
incredible, had, to his wondering bewilderment, won the love of
the sweetest, noblest, fairest, and most utterly lovable and
desirable woman in the world. She whom he had left a child had
grown into his absolute ideal of Woman, and had been by some
miracle reserved for him.</p>
<p>And which would now know the greater joy in their travels--he
in showing her the fair places of the earth and telling her of
personal experiences therein, or she in being shown them by this
adored hero who had come to make her life a blessed dream of joy?
Not that the fair places of the earth were necessary to their
happiness. They could have spent a happy day in London on a wet
Sunday, or at the end of Southend pier on a Bank Holiday, or in a
prison-cell for that matter--for the mind of each to the other a
kingdom was.</p>
<p>"Would you like to go ashore? . . . 'Madame, will you walk and
talk with me,' in the <i>Cannebière?</i>" he asked.</p>
<p>"Of <i>course,</i> we must go ashore, Beloved Snail," was the
reply. "I have no idea what the <i>Cannebière</i> is--but," and
she hugged his arm and whispered, "you can always 'give me the
keys of Heaven,' and walk and talk with me There." (He was
"Beloved Snail" when he was a Bad Man and late for meals; "Bill"
when he was virtuous or forgiven.)</p>
<p>The ship being tied up, and a notice having guaranteed that
she would on no account untie before midnight, this foolish
couple, who utterly loved each other, walked down the gangway,
passed the old lady who sells balloons and the old gentleman who
sells deck-chairs, the young lady who sells glorious violets and
the young gentleman who sells un-glorious "field"-glasses;
through the echoing customs-shed and out to where, beside a
railway-line, specimens of the genus <i>cocher</i> lie in wait
for those who would drive to the boulevards and in hope for those
who know not that four francs is ample fare.</p>
<p>To the sights of Marseilles he took her, enjoying her
enjoyment as he had enjoyed few things in his life, and then in
the <i>Cannebière</i> dismissed the fiacre.</p>
<p>"In Rome you must roam like the Romans," he observed. "In
Marseilles you must sit on little chairs in front of a café and
see the World and his Wife (or Belle Amie) go by."</p>
<p>"Fancy sitting outside a public-house in Regent Street or the
Strand and watching Londoners go by!" said the girl. "Isn't it
extraordinary what a difference in habits and customs one finds
by travelling a few miles? Think of English officers sitting, in
uniform, on the pavement, like those are, and drinking in
public," . . . and she pointed to a group of French officers so
engaged. "Do let's go and sit near them," she added. "I have
never seen soldiers dressed in pale blue and silver, and all the
colours of the rainbow. . . . Aren't they pretty--dears!" . .
.</p>
<p>"Their uniforms look quaint to the insular eye, madam, I
admit," he replied, as he led the way to an unoccupied table near
the brilliant group, "but they are not toy soldiers by any means.
They all belong to regiments of the African Army Corps, the
Nineteenth, and there isn't a finer one on earth."</p>
<p>"Darling, you know <i>everything,"</i> smiled his wife. "Fancy
knowing a thing like that now! I wonder how many other Englishmen
know anything about this African Army and that it is the
Ninety-Ninth. Now <i>how</i> do you know?"</p>
<p>It was his turn to smile, and he did so somewhat wryly.</p>
<p>"What will you have?" he asked, as an aproned <i>garçon</i>
hovered around. "Coffee or <i>sirop</i> or--how would you like to
be devil-of-a-fellow and taste a sip of absinthe? . . . You'll
hate it."</p>
<p>"No, thank you, Bill-man. Is the syrup golden-syrup or
syrup-of-squills or what? No, I'll have some coffee and see if it
is."</p>
<p>"Is what?"</p>
<p>"Coffee." . . .</p>
<p>Meanwhile an elderly, grizzled officer, with a somewhat brutal
face, was staring hard and rudely at the unconscious couple. He
wore a dark blue tunic with red-tabbed and gold-braided collar
and cuffs, scarlet overalls, and a blue and red <i>képi.</i> So
prolonged was his unshifting gaze, so fierce his frown, and so
obvious his interest, that his companions noticed the fact.</p>
<p>"Is the old hog smitten with <i>la belle Anglaise,</i> I
wonder, or what?" murmured a handsome youth in the beautiful pale
blue uniform of the Chasseurs d'Afrique to an even more gorgeous
officer of Spahis.</p>
<p>"I have never known Legros take the faintest interest in
women," replied the other. "There will be a beastly <i>fracas</i>
if the husband glances this way. He'll promise Legros to <i>ponch
ees 'ead</i> if he thinks he's being rude--as he is."</p>
<p>Certainly the elderly and truculent-looking officer <i>was</i>
being rude, for not only was he staring with a hard, concentrated
glare, but he was leaning as far forward as he could, the better
to do it. Anyone--man, woman, or child--being conscious of this
deliberate, searching gaze, must resent it. It was that of a
gendarme, examining the face of a criminal and endeavouring to
"place" him and recollect the details of his last encounter with
him, or of a <i>juge d'instruction</i> examining a criminal in
that manner which does not find favour in England.</p>
<p>"It is as good as sitting in the stalls of a theatre, sitting
here and seeing all these varied types go by, isn't it, Bill?"
observed the girl. "Oh, <i>do</i> look at <i>that</i>--that boy
in brown velvet and a forked beard!"</p>
<p>"We are sitting in the Stalls of the Theatre of Life, my
child," was the sententious reply, but in reality they were
sitting nearer to the Pit.</p>
<p>The brutal-looking officer scratched the back of his neck
slowly up and down with the forefinger of his left hand, a sure
sign that he was wrestling with an elusive reminiscence. For a
moment he took his eyes from the face of the Englishman and
looked sideways at the pavement, cudgelling his brains,
ransacking the cells of his memory. With a muttered oath at
failure to recapture some piece of long-stored information, he
put his hand into the inside pocket of his tunic and produced a
tiny flat case. From this he took a pair of pince-nez and
adjusted them upon the bridge of his broad, short nose. From the
slowness and clumsiness of his movements it was evident that he
had only just taken to glasses, or else wore them very
seldom.</p>
<p>The latter was the case, as Lieutenant Legros considered
spectacles of any kind a most unmilitary and <i>pékinesque</i>
adjunct to uniform.</p>
<p>A quiet, gentlemanly-looking officer, a Captain, wearing a
similar uniform to that of Legros, observed the action.</p>
<p>"Evidently something interests our friend beyond ordinary," he
remarked, and followed the look that the elderly Lieutenant again
fixed upon the Englishman, whom the Captain now noticed for the
first time.</p>
<p>Sitting with his back to the road, and almost facing Legros,
he got a better view of the Englishman's features than did that
deeply interested officer, who, without reply, continued his
searching scrutiny. Evidently a person of great powers of
concentration. As his glance fell upon the young couple, the
Captain started slightly and then looked away.</p>
<p>"Who's for a stroll?" he remarked, half rising. But his
suggestion was not adopted, for glasses were charged, cigarettes
alight, the shade of the café and awning very agreeable, and the
sunshine hot without.</p>
<p>"Have an <i>apéritif</i> first, <i>mon ami,</i> and be
restful," said a Zouave officer, and tinkled the little
table-bell loudly.</p>
<p>The Englishman half-consciously turned toward the sound, and
looked away again without noticing the baleful, steady glare
fixed upon him through the glasses of the Lieutenant.</p>
<p>"<i>Dame!"</i> grunted that officer, and smote his brow in an
agony of exasperation at the failure of his memory. . . . Curse
it! Was he getting old? He had the fellow's name and the
circumstances of his case on the tip of his tongue, so to
speak--at the tips of his fingers, as it were--and he could not
say the word he was bursting to say; could not lay his twitching
mental fingers on the details. . . . He <i>knew. . . .</i> He was
right. . . . He would have it in a minute. . . .</p>
<p>A paper-boy passed the long front of the café and shouted some
wholly unintelligible word as he gazed over the serried ranks of
chairs and loungers.</p>
<p>"What does he say, Bill?" asked the girl. "It sounds like
<i>Barin.</i> How ill the poor lad looks! Fancy having to sell
papers for a living when you are starving and horribly ill, as he
obviously is," and as her hand stole to her charitable purse, she
gratefully thought of the utter security, peace, comfort, and
health of <i>her</i> life--now that Bill had linked it to his. .
. . What was the phrase? . . . Yes--she had "hitched her wagon to
a star"; her poor little homely wagon to the glorious and
brilliant star of her Bill's career. . . . The inquisitorial
Lieutenant used the paper-boy for the purposes of his tactics.
Rising, he made his way between the chairs and the groups of
<i>apéritif-drinking</i> citizens, to where the boy stood, bought
a paper, and returned by a route which brought him full
face-to-face with the Englishman. Recognition was instantaneous
and mutual. The brutal countenance of the elderly Lieutenant was
not improved by a sardonic smile and look of mean and petty
triumph as he thrust an outstretched index-finger in the
Englishman's face and harshly grunted.</p>
<p>"Henri Rrrobinson!" and then laughed a sneering, hideous
cackle.</p>
<p>Staring in utter bewilderment from the French officer to her
husband, the girl saw with horror that his jaw had dropped, his
mouth and eyes were gaping wide, and he had gone as white as a
sheet.</p>
<p>"Sergeant Legros!" he whispered.</p>
<p>"Lieutenant Legros," grunted the other.</p>
<p>What had happened? What in the name of the Merciful Father was
this? Was she dreaming? Her husband looked deathly. He seemed
paralysed with fright.</p>
<p>The Lieutenant half turned, and shouted to a couple of sombre
and mysterious-looking gens d'armes who had been standing for
some time on the little "island" under the big lamp-post in the
middle of the road. As they approached, the Englishman rose to
his feet.</p>
<p>"Listen, darling!" he hissed. "Get out of this quick--to the
ship. Take a <i>fiacre</i> and say '<i>P. and O. bateau</i>.'
I'll join you all right. They have . . ."</p>
<p>The Lieutenant put a heavy hand on his shoulder and swung him
round.</p>
<p>"Arrest this man," said he to the gens d'armes, "and take him
to Fort St. Jean. He is a deserter, one Henri Rrrobinson, from
the First Battalion of the Foreign Legion. Deserted from
Sidi-bel-Abbès eight years ago. But <i>I</i> knew the dog.
Aha!"</p>
<p>The group of officers whom Legros had just left, joined the
gathering crowd.</p>
<p>"Poor devil!" said Captain d'Armentières. He too had
recognized the <i>soi-disant</i> Henry Robinson. . . . "Poor
girl!" he added. "Poor little soul!" She looked like <i>une
nouvelle mariée</i> too. Of course Legros had only done his
duty--curse him. Curse him a thousand times for a blackguardly,
brutal ruffian. The girl was going to faint. . . . Her
wedding-ring looked brand-new. "If this is his wedding night,
he'll spend it in the <i>salle de police</i> of Fort St. Jean,"
he reflected. "If he is on his honeymoon, he'll spend it in the
<i>cellules</i> until the General Court-Martial at Oran gives him
a few years <i>rabiau</i> with the Zephyrs. If he survives that,
which is improbable, he will finish his five years of Legion
service. No--she won't see much of him during the next decade. .
. . Poor little soul!"</p>
<p>The gens d'armes duly arrested the deserter. He caught the eye
of the Captain.</p>
<p>"Captain d'Armentières," said he, "you are a French gentleman.
This lady is my wife. We have been married a week. I beg of you
to see her safe on board the P. and O. steamer <i>Maloja,</i>
which we have just left, for an hour's visit here."</p>
<p>"I will do so," said d'Armentières.</p>
<p>A fat and kindly Frenchman, who understood English, translated
for the benefit of the crowd. It became intensely sympathetic--at
least with the girl. The French, for some reason, imagine their
Foreign Legion to be composed of Germans, and the French do not
love Germans. . . . And then, having commended his wife to
d'Armentières (whom he had liked and admired in the past when he
had played the fool's prank of joining the Legion "for a lark"),
he thought rapidly and clearly. . . .</p>
<p>If they once got him inside Fort St. Jean (the clearing-house
for drafts and details going to, and coming from,
Algeria--recruits, convalescents, leave-expired, all sorts;
Legionaries, Zouaves, Turcos, Spahis, Tirailleurs) he was done.
In a short time he would be a convict, in military-convict dress,
enduring the living-death of existence in the Zephyrs, the
terrible Disciplinary Battalion, compared with whose lot that of
the British long-sentence convict at Dartmoor, Portland, or
Wormwood Scrubbs is a bed of roses in the lap of luxury. After
that--back to the Legion <i>if</i> he were alive to finish his
five years, of which there were four unexpired. And his
wife--stranded, without money, in Marseilles, unless
d'Armentières got her to the ship. And what would she do then--at
the end of the voyage? . . . God help them! . . . A few minutes
ago--happiness unspeakable, safety, security, peace, all life
before them. Now--in a few minutes he would be in gaol and his
adored, adoring wife a deserted, friendless stranger in a strange
land. . . . Would they <i>allow</i> d'Armentières to take her to
the ship? Would they want her to give evidence--put her in some
kind of prison until the Court-Martial sat? Suppose d'Armentières
had not been there, and she had been left to the tender mercies
of Legros--or utterly deserted, fainting on a café chair. . .
.</p>
<p>Well, things couldn't be much worse (or <i>could</i> they) if
he "resisted the police," assaulted the duly-appointed officers
of the law in the execution of their duty, and made a break for
liberty. No, things couldn't be worse. Neither he nor she would
survive the next ten years. And there was a <i>chance,</i> or the
ghost of a shadow of a chance. The deck of the <i>Maloja</i> was
English soil, and they could not lay a finger on him there. If
only she were safe on board, he'd make the attempt. There
<i>was</i> a chance--and he had always taken the sporting chance,
all his life. . . . And this vile cur of a Legros! He had many a
score to pay off to Sergeant Legros--the prize bully of the XIXth
Army Corps. Now <i>this!</i> If he could only have his hands at
the throat of Legros. As these thoughts flashed through his
brain, "May I say farewell to my wife and see her into a
<i>fiacre</i> with you, Captain d'Armentières?" he asked. He
appeared to be as cool as he was pale. The Captain was the senior
officer present.</p>
<p>"Yes," he said. "I will drive her as quickly as possible to
the ship," and willing hands helped the fainting girl into the
<i>fiacre. . . .</i> Was she dying? As she lost her hold and sank
into the bottomless depths of unconsciousness she was finally
aware that her husband winked at her violently. That wink, in a
face which was a pallid, tragic mask, was the most dreadful and
heartrending thing she had ever seen. Anyhow, it meant some kind
of reassurance which he could not put into words without
disclosing some plan to his captors. She fainted completely, in
the act of wondering whether this was merely that he was putting
a good face on it and pretending for her benefit, or whether he
really had a plan. Anyhow, she was to go to the ship--and, in any
case, she was dying of a broken heart. . . .</p>
<p>As he watched his wife driven rapidly away, the Englishman
formulated his plans.</p>
<p>He would delay as long as he could in order that his wife
might be on board the ship before he reached it, if ever he
did.</p>
<p>He would go quietly and willingly--but as slowly as
possible--while the road to Fort St. Jean was the road to the
ship. He would then break away from his pursuers and run for it.
He would show them what an old Oxford miler and International
Rugger forward could do in the way of running and dodging, and,
perchance, what sort of a fight an amateur champion heavy-weight
could put up.</p>
<p>But strategy first, strength and skill afterwards, for he was
playing a terrible game, with his wife's happiness at stake, not
to mention his own liberty. With a groan, he artistically smote
his knees together and sank to the ground. That would gain a
little time anyhow, and they'd hardly carry him to Fort St. Jean,
nor waste a cab-fare on the carcase of a Legionary.</p>
<p>He wasn't quite certain as to the nearest way from the
Cannebière to Fort St. Jean, but he remembered that it was down
by the waterfront. Yes, he could again see its quaint old tower,
like a lighthouse, and its drawbridged moat, as he closed his
eyes. Part of the way to it would be the way to the P. and O.
wharf at Mole C, or whatever it was, anyhow. Would they take him
by tram? That might complicate matters. If they were going to do
that, should he make his break for liberty at once, or on the
journey, or at the end of it? It would be comparatively easy to
make a dash before or after the tram-ride, but they'd surely
never let him escape them from a crowded tram. Would they
handcuff him? If so, that would settle it. He'd fight and run the
moment handcuffs were produced. You can't run in handcuffs,
although you think you can. Would they shoot? It would be Hell to
be winged in sight of the ship. Was the P. and O. wharf British
soil, as well as the ship?</p>
<p>Almost certainly not.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Legros kicked him in the ribs.</p>
<p>"Get up, <i>tricheur,</i>" he shouted. He was in his element,
and fairly gloated over his victim, who only groaned and
collapsed the more.</p>
<p>To those of the crowd who realized that he was an Englishman,
he was an object of pity; to those who concluded that, being a
Legionary, he was a German, he was merely an object of
interest.</p>
<p>The officers who had been sitting with Legros departed in some
disgust, and the crowd changed, eddied, and thinned. . . . Only a
sick man being attended to by a couple of gens d'armes!</p>
<p>These latter grew a little impatient. The sooner they could
dispose of this fine fellow the better, but they certainly
weren't going to march to Fort St. Jean at the request of a
Lieutenant of Legionaries. Let the army do its own dirty work.
They'd run him in all right to the nearest lock-up, and he could
be handed over to the military authorities, to be dealt with,
whenever they liked to fetch him. To the devil with all
Légionnaires, be they deserters or Lieutenants! "He had better be
taken to the police-station on a stretcher, mon Lieutenant,"
suggested one of them. "It would appear that he has fainted."</p>
<p>"Stretcher!" roared Legros, and spat. "Pah! That is not how we
deal with swine of Légionnaires who sham sick. Stretcher! Drag
him face downward by one toe at the tail of a dust-cart more
likely!"</p>
<p>Oho! Police-station, was it? Not Fort St. Jean immediately.
And where might the nearest police-station be, wondered the
prostrate Englishman. He must not let them get him there. The
boat would sail at midnight, whether he were on board or not--and
once the cell door closed on him it would not open till the
morning.</p>
<p>Perhaps he had better take his leave at once. Unless they went
in the direction of the docks for some part of the way it would
be a cruelly punishing run. . . . Just as bad for them though,
and he'd back himself against any of these beefy old birds for a
four-mile race. . . .</p>
<p>His wife must be half-way there by now--more, if d'Armentières
urged the <i>cocher,</i> as he would.</p>
<p>Was it likely that d'Armentières would collect a guard of gens
d'armes, dock police, soldiers, or customs officials at the wharf
gate or the ship's gangway, and lie in wait to see if he tried to
get on board? No--d'Armentières was not that sort.</p>
<p>(He was not, and when, later, Lieutenant Legros was reduced to
the rank of sergeant for what was practically the brutal murder
of a Legionary, Captain d'Armentières thought of this incident
and rejoiced.)</p>
<p>And if he did--let them stop him if they could. He'd break
through the scrum of them all right. Lay some of them out
too.</p>
<p>What was Legros saying? Urging the gens d'armes to boot him up
and lug him off by the scruff of his neck, eh?</p>
<p>He groaned again, sat up with difficulty, shakily and
painfully rose to his feet, then smote Legros a smashing blow
between the eyes, butted the gendarme who stood on his right, and
with a dodge, a jump, and a wriggle was away and running like a
hare.</p>
<p>To the end of his life he never forgot that race for life, and
for more than life. Scores of times he lived through it again in
terrible nightmares and suffered a thousand times more than he
did on the actual run itself. For then he was quite cool, steady,
and unafraid. He imagined himself to be running with the ball at
Blackheath or Richmond, threading his way through the hostile
fifteen, dodging, leaping, handing-off. But there were one or two
differences. In Rugger you may not drive your clenched fist with
all your might into the face of any man who springs at you. . . .
Nor do you run for miles over cobbles. . . .</p>
<p>It was really surprisingly easy. Once he had got clear and put
a few yards between himself and the uninjured gendarme, it was
even betting that he'd win--provided his wind held and he didn't
get the stitch, and that he did not slip and fall on the cursed
stones. For the folk behind he cared nothing, and with such in
front as grasped the situation in time to do something, he could
deal. Some he dodged, some he handed-off as at Rugger, and some
he hit. These last were slower to rise than those he handed-off,
or caused to fall by dodging them, as they sprang at him.</p>
<p>When he turned a sharp corner he was so well ahead of the
original pursuers that he was merely a man running, and that is
not in itself an indictable offence. Certainly people stopped and
stared at the sight of an obvious foreigner running at top speed,
but he might have a boat to catch, he might be pursuing a train
of thought or his lost youth and innocence. <i>Que
voulez-vous?</i> Besides, he might be English, and therefore
mad.</p>
<p>And then the blue-faced, panting gendarme would round the
corner at the head of such <i>gamins,</i> loafers, police agents,
and other citizens as saw fit to run on a hot afternoon.
Whereupon people in this sector of street would look after the
runaway and some run after him as well. So the pursuing crowd
continually changed, as some left it and others joined it, until
there remained of the old original firm scarcely any but the
distressed and labouring gendarme--who, at last, himself gave up,
reeled to the wall, and whooping and gasping for breath, prepared
to meet his Maker.</p>
<p>Before the poor man had decided that this event was not yet,
the Englishman had dashed round another corner and actually leapt
on to an electric tram in full flight toward the
<i>quais!</i></p>
<p>Ciel! How mad were these English! Fancy a man running like
that now, just to catch a tram. No, he would <i>not</i> go
inside; he preferred to stand on the platform, and stand there he
would.</p>
<p>He did, and anon, the tram having stopped at his polite
request to the conductor, he strolled on to the P. and O. wharf
and marched up the gangway of the good ship <i>Maloja.</i></p>
<p>A steward informed him that his wife were ill, 'aving been
brought aboard by a French gent and took to 'er cabing. She were
still lying down. . . .</p>
<p>She was, at that moment, very ill indeed, mentally and
physically.</p>
<p>But not for long, when his arms had assured her that they were
not those of a vision and a ghost. . . .</p>
<p>If you ever travel Home with them, you'll find they don't go
ashore at Marseilles. No, they don't like the place--prefer to
stay on board, even through the coaling.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c105" id="c105"><i>Five Minutes</i></a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>Le Légionnaire Jacques Bonhomme (as he called himself) was
dying, and Sergeant Baudré, in charge of the convoy of wounded,
proceeding from the nasty, messy fighting at Hu-Thuong to the
base hospital at Phulang-Thuong, kindly permitted a brief halt
that he might die in peace.</p>
<p>The good Sergeant Baudré could not accord more than an hour to
the Legionary for his dying arrangements, because he had been
instructed by his captain to get back as quickly as possible, and
Phulang-Thuong lies only twenty-four miles south of
Hu-Thuong.</p>
<p>Sergeant Baudré had other reasons also. For one, he was
apprehensive of attack by some wandering band of De Nam's
"pirates," and the outlaw brigands who served Monsieur De Nam,
mandarin of the deposed Emperor of Annam, Ham-Nghi, were men
whose courage and skill in fighting were only excelled by their
ingenuity and pitilessness in torturing such of their enemies as
fell into their hands. No, Sergeant Baudré had seen the remains
of some of the prisoners of these "Black Flags," and he shuddered
yet whenever he thought of them.</p>
<p>And what could he do, strung out over a mile, with a weak
escort of Tirailleurs Tonkinois to provide his point,
cover-point, and main body with the wounded, and an
<i>escouade</i> of Legionaries for his rearguard? The sooner he
got to Phulang-Thuong, the better. Returning, unhampered by the
wounded, he could take care of himself, and any band of "Black
Flags" who chose to attack him could do so. They should have a
taste of the fighting qualities of Sergeant Baudré and his
Legionaries. As it was--Sergeant Baudré shrugged his shoulders
and bade Legionary Jacques Bonhomme die and be done with it.</p>
<p>"I thank you, Sergeant," murmured the dying man. "May I speak
with le Légionnaire Jean Boule, if he is with the squad?"</p>
<p>The Sergeant grunted. He ran his eye along the halted column.
Would those Tirailleurs Tonkinois stand, if there were a sudden
rush of howling devils from the dense jungle on either side of
the track? And why should they be allowed to take their women
about with them everywhere, so that these should carry their kit
and accoutrements for them? Nobody carried Sergeant Baudré's
hundredweight of kit when he marched. Why should these Annamese
be pampered thus? Should he send the squad of Legionaries to the
head of the column when they advanced again? It would be just his
luck if the column was attacked in front while the Legionaries
were in the rear, or <i>vice versâ.</i></p>
<p>Sergeant Baudré strolled toward the rear. He would get the
opinion of "Jean Boule" in the course of a little apparently
aimless conversation. He had been an officer before he joined the
Legion, and these English knew all there is to know about
guerilla fighting. . . .</p>
<p>From his remarks and replies it was clear to the good Sergeant
that the Englishman considered that any attack would certainly
come from the rear.</p>
<p>"Without doubt," agreed Sergeant Baudré. "That is why I keep
the <i>escouade</i> as rearguard."</p>
<p>"By the way," he added, "Légionnaire Bonhomme wishes to say
'<i>Au 'voir</i>' to you. He is off in a few minutes. Go and tell
him to hurry up. We march again as soon as we have fed. He is the
first stretcher in front of the Tirailleurs' women."</p>
<p>Legionnaire John Bull hurried to the spot. He knew that poor
Jacques Bonhomme's number was up. It was a marvel how he had hung
on, horribly wounded as he was--shot, speared, and staked, all at
once, and all in the abdomen. He had been friendly with
Jacques--an educated man and once a gentleman.</p>
<p>A glance showed him that he was too late. The man was
delirious and semi-conscious. If he had any message or
commission, it would never be put into words now.</p>
<p>The Englishman sat on the ground beside the stretcher and took
the hand of the poor wretch. Possibly some sense of sympathy,
company, friendship, or support might penetrate to, and comfort,
the stricken soul.</p>
<p>After a while the over-bright eyes turned toward him.</p>
<p>"Any message, Jacques, <i>mon ami?</i>" he whispered, stroking
the hand he held.</p>
<p>But Jacques Bonhomme talked on in the monotonous way of the
fever-smitten, though with a strange consecutiveness. John Bull
listened carefully, in the hope that some name, rank, office, or
address might be mentioned and give a clue to relatives or the
undelivered message or last commission.</p>
<p>. . ."Only five minutes in each year! Morel tells me there are
five hundred and twenty-five thousand and six hundred minutes in
each year, and I believe him implicitly, for he is the finest
mathematical professor the Sorbonne ever had. I believe him
implicitly. He is no Classic, but he has good points and can do
wonderful things with figures. Wonderful feats! He knows all
about things like the Metric System, Decimals, and Vulgar
Fractions and similar things of which one hears but never
encounters. He can not only add up columns of francs and
centimes, such as are found in the bills which tradesmen are fond
of writing, even when they have received payment, but he can deal
with things like pounds, shillings, and pence; dollars and cents;
yen and sabuks; or rupees, annas, and pice, not only with
marvellous accuracy, but with incredible rapidity. This makes him
an invaluable travelling companion for a Classic who knows none
of these things--apart from the fact that he can also find out
the times of trains and steamers from railway and shipping
guides. It is wonderful to see him seize a book, scan it for a
moment, and then say unhesitatingly that a train will leave the
Gare de Lyon at a certain hour on a certain day, that it will
just catch a ship at Marseilles on the next day, and that this
ship will just catch another at Aden, so many days later, and
that this one will land you in Japan at a certain hour on a
certain day. And yet he is not a bit proud of these things--no
prouder than I am of my little metrical translation of the
Satires and Odes of Horace into Greek. And he thinks I travel
with him for the sake of his delightful company! A man who cannot
utter a hackneyed Latin quotation without some horrible false
quantity. Poor Morel! . . .</p>
<p>"And this piece of information as to the number of minutes in
a year is one of the most useful calculations he ever did on my
behalf, except the one he did in answer to my query as to how
many waking minutes there are--how many minutes in what one might
call an active or waking year. That is to say, counting only the
minutes when one is not asleep. He tells me there are three
hundred and seventy-two thousand and three hundred waking minutes
in the year for a man who averages seven hours sleep a day, or
rather night--for he never sleeps in the day. How he knows I
cannot tell, but I believe him absolutely, for he is as truthful
as he is clever. So now I know that if I subtract five from this
last appalling total I can tell how many minutes of the year I
spend in thinking of the other five. After arriving at an
aggravating variety of results, I again sought the good Morel's
help, and he assures me that, subtracting five from the last
total with which he furnished me, I have three hundred and
seventy-two thousand and two hundred and ninety-five minutes.</p>
<p>"Thus I can now tell you clearly, that I spend three hundred
and seventy-two thousand and two hundred and ninety-five minutes
of the year in thinking of the other five--the five I spend with
<i>Her. . . .</i></p>
<p>"That is my point--do you understand?</p>
<p>"But although these magnificent figures give me much
gratification, they cannot be taken as what Morel calls 'final,'
for though during the majority of those minutes I am thinking of
the other five consciously, I am only thinking of them
subconsciously during the remainder, when I am lecturing, writing
Greek hexameters, or reconstructing Greece and Rome for bored
students who care for none of these things so long as they pass
their absurd examinations--for we have not the spirit of study
any more in France, but only the letter, thanks to those same
examinations that prohibit thought, research, reading and culture
absolutely. Moreover, the figures are also what Morel calls
'vitiated,' by the fact that a vast number of my sleeping moments
are also given to dreaming of those five, and dreaming, as any
philosopher will tell you, is far better and finer than thinking.
Morel stoutly denies this--but that one would expect from so
uneducated and uncultured a man. What I want to know is whether
you think I might balance the waking moments when I can only
think of her subconsciously against the sleeping moments when I
am actually dreaming of her, and consider that the total of three
hundred and seventy-two thousand and two hundred and ninety-five
is approximately correct? The matter is of the first importance
to me. I hate figures, as a rule, for they give me a headache,
but in this one instance I want them correct. As I am so often
told that I must be more scientific, accurate, and exact, I have
tried to express myself mathematically and can do no better. To
me it seems that I might just as well have said, 'I spend all the
year in thinking of five minutes of it'--but I suppose some queer
child of the new generation of Frenchmen would at once point out
that I spend nearly a third of my time in sleeping, and much of
it in working. . . . My head is in a dreadful whirl and muddle
about it though. . . .</p>
<p>"Every year she goes to the tiny Breton village of Poldac for
one week. I suppose she feels that she must have one week's rest
and communion with her own soul if she is to live. On the first
day of every July she goes, and her train stops at Pennebecque
for five minutes. As you have guessed, I go to Pennebecque every
year for that five minutes. It is the longest stop that the train
makes. . . . And the setting of the scene is so wonderful, it is
worthy to frame such a picture. I would not see her in the dust
and noise and bustle of the Gare de l'Ouest, or at any ugly
little wayside station. Yes, I go to Pennebecque to see her for
five minutes every year. The only other train that passes through
that tiny place does so at night. So I arrive over-night and sit
on a seat and wait, almost too happy and exalted to breathe. . .
.</p>
<p>"I have sat on that seat, for the last night of June, for
seven years. And I have striven not to pray that the Marquis
might die. And yet would not he be better dead--the poor,
lolling-tongued, squint-eyed, half-witted Marquis? Think of that
marvel of beauty, grace, goodness, and wit, the Marquise de
Montheureux, making herself the nurse, the attendant, the keeper,
of a lunatic!</p>
<p>"Yes, but for that one week in the year she is never out of
his sight, night or day. If she but turns her back he weeps and
sobs aloud. She tends that great, slobbering, dribbling lout,
that mindless, soulless clod--no more sentient nor responsive
than a hippopotamus--as the most devoted of young mothers tends
and nurses her firstborn. . . .</p>
<p>"For one week in the year she lives her own life, and for five
minutes in the year I see her. For six months I do nothing but
look forward to that five minutes, and for six months again I do
nothing but look back upon it.</p>
<p>"The first time, she did not see me, or did not recognize me
as the man whom she had seen at the neighbouring chateau of the
de Grandcourts--where I was tutor to the young Comte.</p>
<p>"The second time I ventured to bow, having debated the matter
for a year, and she bowed and smiled, with the remark that only
the other day, the Comtesse de Grandcourt was speaking of me and
my good influence over the headstrong and rather wild boy who had
been in my charge.</p>
<p>"The next year she spoke to me and commented on the curious
coincidence of my being there again. She is of the real and true
<i>noblesse,</i> you see, and has the kind, gentle, and
unassuming manner of the genuine aristocrat. <i>Noblesse
oblige.</i> She was as sweetly, graciously kind to the village
curé, to her own servants, or to me as she was to de Grandcourt
himself. She was a noble, and her nobility was made patent by her
nobleness. It is your bourgeois 'noble' whose nobility has to be
advertised by gilt and plush and display and rudeness to
'inferiors.'</p>
<p>"The fourth year she did not remark on the 'coincidence' of my
presence at the station. She understood. And she accepted the
bunch of roses I took. Oh, the sleepless nights I passed in the
agony of that struggle to decide whether to take the roses!</p>
<p>"The year she did not come was rather terrible. I did not know
what an eternity could be covered by two years. The bellowing
calf of a Marquis was 'ill,' forsooth, and she never left his
bedside. . . . Curse him! Had he not even the sense and
understanding to see what he was making of her life, and to die
like a man?</p>
<p>"<i>Bon Dieu!</i> Surely <i>to die</i> is easy--it is living
that is so hard. But no--Monsieur le Marquis de Montheureux could
not die. He must go on living, even though he could not wash his
own face nor feed himself. . . .</p>
<p>"The sixth year she gave me so beautiful and kind and
understanding a smile! She knew that I lived but for that five
minutes. How I sang through the next twelve months! She knew. She
understood. She smiled at me. Why should I not love her? It did
neither her nor anyone else any harm, and it made my
life--well--glorious, and gave it all the fineness and fulness
that it possessed.</p>
<p>"For I simply did everything as though she were watching me,
and as though account were to be rendered to her instead of to
God. Was this an offence against <i>Le Bon Dieu?</i> . . .</p>
<p>"Sin? I dare to think for myself in religious matters. And I
say that what is absolutely good must be of God--and if it isn't,
I can't help it. And I lived as though she were watching me.</p>
<p>"The seventh year she gave me her hand. Had my heart been
other than strong I should have died. . . . For twelve months I
pondered the possibility of daring to put my lips to it, should
she give me her hand again. Whenever she encountered de
Grandcourt, he used to bow in the ancient grand manner, sweeping
the ground with his hat, as though it were a great
<i>mousquetaire</i> headdress, and as she swept him a mock
curtsey in return he could kiss her hand. Why should not I? No de
Grandcourt could honour her more nor love her as much. . . .</p>
<p>"That eighth year, I, poor fool, had determined that, if she
again gave me her hand, I would kiss it. What Emperor then could
have the pride and glory of the man who had kissed the hand of
the Marquise de Monthereux? Would I, Cæsar Maximilien Raoul de
Baillieul, then change with any king on earth?</p>
<p>"The day came, and I sat in the usual place, awaiting her, and
picturing her. She would wear, this year, a silken dust-cloak of
a lavender tint, and her glorious hair would be uncovered. One
hand would be bare, the other gloved in a shade of lavender. I
felt certain of these details.</p>
<p>"The train came at last, and yet all too soon. When she had
come and gone there would be twelve months to live through,
before I might see her again.</p>
<p>"I went to the window of the nearest first-class carriage.</p>
<p>"There she sat alone, and, as I approached, the beautiful slow
smile, to me the loveliest thing on earth, warmed her glorious
face.</p>
<p>"She was arrayed in lavender-coloured silk, her head was bare
and so was her hand. She extended it towards me. With heart
beating as though I had just run a race, I stepped to the
window--<i>and she was not.</i> The carriage was empty, and as I
clung to the handle, a little faint, her maid, dressed in deep
mourning, came to a neighbouring window and looked out. . . .</p>
<p>"Madame la Marquise had died of typhoid which had broken out
in Montheureux village. She would stay and work among her
stricken people. The Marquis had died within twenty-four hours.
No, not of the disease. Of grief. He had grasped that she was
dead, and that he would never see her again. The maid was on her
way to Poldec to arrange about Madame's cottage and property
there.</p>
<p>"It appears that I fell there as one dead and lay ill for
weeks.</p>
<p>"But no, I must not commit suicide or I might not enter the
Heaven where she is . . . the Heaven that our Wise Men decided
does not exist, when they turned God out of France. . . . But I
must crucify myself in some way or go mad. Physical pain and
strife and stress alone can save me.</p>
<p>"I shall enlist in the Foreign Legion. Perhaps I shall earn an
honourable death against the enemies of France.</p>
<p>"Oh, Rose of the World. Rosemonde, Rosemonde, Rosemonde--"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Finished?" quoth Sergeant Baudré, approaching. "Dump him in
that rice-mud. He'll be more useful dead than he ever was alive."
. . .</p>

<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c106" id="c106"><i>"Here are Ladies"</i></a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>A sluggish, oily river with mangrove-swamp banks; a terrible
September day with an atmosphere of superheated, poisonous steam;
and the two French gunboats, <i>Corail</i> and <i>Opale,</i>
carrying a detachment of the French Foreign Legion, part of an
expeditionary force entrusted with the task of teaching manners,
and an enhanced respect for Madame la République, to Behanzin,
King of Dahomey.</p>
<p>The Legionaries standing, squatting, and lying on the
painfully hot iron decks, were drenched in perspiration. The
light flannel active-service kits, served out to them at Porto
Novo, clung wetly to their bodies. From under the big ugly pith
helmets of dirty white, dirty white faces showed cadaverous and
wan. For a month they had forced their way through the West
African jungle, sometimes achieving as much as a mile an hour
through the sucking mud of a swamp; sometimes thrusting their
stifling, choking way through elephant grass eight to ten feet in
height; and again fighting through dense tangled bush with
chopper, <i>coupe-coupe,</i> and axe. They had travelled "light,"
with only rifle and bayonet and one hundred and fifty rounds of
ammunition, but even this lightness had been too heavy for some.
The more coffee and quinine for the rest! To give variety to the
sufferings of fatigue, fever, hunger, thirst, and dysentery, the
Dahomeyans frequently attacked in the numerical superiority of a
hundred to one. No mean opponents either, with their up-to-date
American rifles and batteries of Krupp guns for long range work,
and their spears and machetes for the charge.</p>
<p>As usual, the Legion was marking its trail with the generous
distribution of the graves of its sons.</p>
<p>And now the VIIth Company had left swamp and jungle for the
floating ovens <i>Corail</i> and <i>Opale.</i> Terrific heat, but
no sunshine; the "landscape" minatory, terrible; life, the acme
and essence of discomfort and misery. Even the Senegalese boatmen
seemed affected and depressed.</p>
<p>"Say, John! Is this-yer penny-steamboat trip fer the
saloobrity of our healths?" asked the Bucking Bronco, in a husky
voice, of his neighbour le Legionnaire Jean Boule or John Bull.
The old soldier wiped the sweat from his face with his
sleeve.</p>
<p>"I overheard Commandant Faraux telling Colonel Dodds that
there is a ford up here somewhere, and that it must be found and
seized," he answered wearily. "I expect we're looking for it
now."</p>
<p>"Well, <i>I</i> ain't got it. Search me!" said the American.
"I allow Ole Man Farrow's got another think comin' if he . .
."--a ragged crash of musketry from the bank a hundred yards
distant, and the ironwork of the <i>Opale</i> rang again under a
hail of bullets.</p>
<p>In ten seconds the Legionaries were lining the sandbagged
bulwarks with loaded rifles at the "ready."</p>
<p>"Oh, the fools--the silly bunch o' boobs!" murmured the
Bucking Bronco. "I allow thet's torn it! The pie-faced pikers hev
sure wafted the bloom off the little secret."</p>
<p>"Yes," agreed John Bull, "you'd have thought even Behanzin's
generals would have had the sense to lie low and not announce
themselves until we'd got our column fairly tied up in the middle
of the ford." . . .</p>
<p>The roar of Hotchkiss guns and Lebel rifles from the two boats
drowned his further remarks, as well as the irregular crashings
of the bursts of Dahomeyan musketry. . . .</p>
<p>The debarkation of the VIIth Company was unhindered, the ford
seized, and the safe passage of the Expeditionary Force
guaranteed, the Dahomeyans having retired.</p>
<p>"Waal!" remarked the Bucking Bronco to his friend as half the
VIIth Company moved off next morning, as Advance Guard. "Strike
me peculiar ef thet ain't the softest cinch I seen ever. Guess
Ole Man Behanzin ain't been to no West Point Academy. They say
his best men is women--an' I kin believe it!"</p>
<p>"Amazons," remarked Jean Boule. "I pray we don't come across
any. Fancy shooting at women."</p>
<p>"You smile your kind, fatherly smile at 'em, John, an' I allow
they'll come an' eat outer yer hand. . . . Are they really
fightin'<i>-gals,</i> with roof-garden hats an' shirt-waists, and
mittens on their pasterns? . . . Gee-whiz! Guess I'll take a few
prisoners an' walk with a proud tail!"</p>
<p>"They're women, all right," was the reply, "and I believe they
are as dangerous as dervishes--apart from any question of one's
not shooting to kill when they charge. . . . If all I've heard
about them is true, chivalry is apt to be a trifle costly."</p>
<p>"Waal, John, as Légionnaires, we ain't habituated to luxury
any, and can't afford naw then costly. Ef any black gal lays fer
me with an axe--it's a smackin' fer hers."</p>
<p>"Yes--but what are we going to do if an Amazon regiment opens
an accurate and steady fire on us with Winchester repeaters and
then charges with the bayonet?"</p>
<p>"Burn the trail for Dixie," grinned the American. "I guess
we'd hit the high places some, an' roll our tails for Home.
<i>Gee</i>-whillikins! Charged by gals!"</p>
<p>"That's all very well," grumbled the Englishman, "but the
Legion doesn't run, either from men or from women. If an Amazon
regiment charges us, we've <i>got</i> to fight. . . . It would be
ghastly."</p>
<p>Even as he spoke the deadly silent forest suddenly gave birth
to thousands of black shadows, all moving swiftly and
noiselessly, and from all directions, upon the tiny column of the
Advance Guard.</p>
<p>With one accord, at some signal, they halted, rested the butts
of their rifles on their thighs, fired, and then, howling like
devils, charged with great <i>élan,</i> led by a number of tall,
muscular women, handsome and finely made.</p>
<p>"<i>Gals!</i>" gasped the American, as the column
instinctively halted, faced outwards in two ranks, and poured
magazine fire into the dense masses of the charging savages.</p>
<p>"<i>Look</i> at her!" he cried, and pointed to a young woman,
who, bare to the waist, and wearing a fez cap, a short blue
cotton kilt, and a leather belt and cartridge-cases, came
bounding straight toward him. In her right hand she brandished a
thick-backed, heavy chopping-sword like a <i>coupe-coupe</i> or
machete, and in her left carried a bright new repeating-carbine.
Nothing could have been more dashing, courageous, and inspiring
than the leading of this Fury, as she rushed straight for the
levelled rifles of the Legionaries, waving her men on and yelling
mingled words of encouragement, threat, and taunt at them as she
strove to bring them to the consummation of the charge.</p>
<p>Her efforts were in vain, however. The Dahomeyan male warrior
is not of very heroic stuff, and does his best fighting in a
surprised camp, a broken square, or against a scattered line. His
<i>métier</i> is the ambush, the rush at dawn, the hacking and
hewing hundred-to-one fight in dense jungle where the foe cannot
form or charge, the tree-top sniping, the trampling flat of a
worn-out enemy by sheer weight of numbers.</p>
<p>Before the steady fire of an unbroken line he generally wilts
away, and vanishes shadow-like into the impenetrable depths of
his native jungle, to try another surprise, another ambush,
another dawn-rush of ten thousand men, at the next
opportunity.</p>
<p>As usual, beneath the accurate fire that mowed them down in
swathes, the Dahomeyans broke and fled, slowly followed by their
Amazon leaders, who shrilly cursed, and fiercely struck at, the
retiring faint-hearts.</p>
<p>Just as the "cease-fire" whistle blew, the woman who had been
charging at the Bucking Bronco and John Bull (and who had stood
screaming at her followers as they halted, faltered, and broke)
threw up her arms and fell.</p>
<p>"That weren't <i>me,</i>" quoth the Bucking Bronco, "an' I
hope it was a dod-gasted accident. She was some gal, that gal.
Let's have a look at her if we ain't agoin' to charge nor
nawthen."</p>
<p>The officer commanding the Advance Guard was certainly not
going to charge. He was only too thankful to have beaten off the
sudden and well-executed attack. How marvellously the brutes had
materialized from the apparently uninhabited forest, still silent
and gloomy as the tomb. But what <i>fools!</i> That force alone,
properly handled, and attacking while the column was in the
middle of the wide deep ford, might have told a very different
story.</p>
<p>"Bugler," called he, "blow the 'alarm' and the
'regimental-call' till your veins crack and your lungs burst. . .
. No--turn toward the river, <i>sot,</i> I want the main body to
hear. . . . Sergeant-Major, send two of the strongest running
back with this." . . .</p>
<p>They were the last words he spoke. The Amazons themselves were
charging this time--a whole regiment--and no regiment in this
world ever charged with greater dash, courage, violence, and
determination. Firing as they came, and utterly disregarding the
steady magazine-fire of the Legionaries, they swept down upon
them like an avalanche--like cavalry--and burst upon the little
line, through it, and over it, like a hailstorm across a
wheatfield.</p>
<p>Rushing at Captain Roux, one fired her Spencer carbine into
his chest, while another drove a spear into his abdomen. As he
fell, a third stooped and deliberately hacked off his head with
her chopping-knife. There was no question of "sparing women" as
these furies, each as big and strong and well-armed as any
Legionary, hacked, hewed, and thrust, or, kneeling a few yards
from their victims, gave them the contents of the magazines of
their carbines. . . .</p>
<p>While parrying the fierce thrusts of one stalwart virago, John
Bull, struck on the head from behind by two assailants at once,
fell to the ground, even as his eye had subconsciously taken in
and registered upon his brain a picture of his mighty friend
swinging his rifle round and round his head by the muzzle, the
butt describing a circle within which he stood unhurt as to his
body, though apparently shocked in mind, to judge from his roar
of "Scat! ye shameless jumpin' Jezebels!"</p>
<p>Without thought of defending himself, the bugler continuously
blew the "alarm" and the "regimental call" (in the hope that it
might carry back to the main body, which apparently had delayed
longer at the ford than had been expected) until he went down
with a bullet through his leg and another in his shoulder, two of
seven fired at him from a score paces distance by a young Amazon.
A minute later, the man rose to his knees and blew with almost
undiminished strength, until the same young woman riddled his
chest, at point-blank range, with another magazineful.</p>
<p>Recovering consciousness, John Bull saw a gigantic Amazon make
a dive at the knees of the Bucking Bronco, ducking beneath the
whirling rifle-butt. A moment later he was down, but, instead of
being hacked to pieces, was borne away, kicking and cursing, by a
dozen powerful women.</p>
<p>Knowing what that meant, he would rather have seen his friend
killed before his eyes. . . . As another wave of faintness swept
over him, he heard the distant strains of "Tiens! Voilà du
boudin"--the March of the Legion, and knew that the buglers of
the column were sending the encouraging notes ahead of their
straining bodies, as the remainder of the force hurried to the
rescue. Poor Bugler Langout's message had carried on the heavy
air, which seems to blanket the sound of rifle fire while
transmitting that of a whistle, bugle, or war-drum to a
surprising distance.</p>
<p>Heavy fire from the debouching troops saved the few survivors
of the Advance Guard--but it was not until the whole column had
fought a tough action in company squares, that the Amazons and
the rallied and reinforced Dahomeyans acknowledged defeat, for
that day at any rate, and disappeared shadow-like into the jungle
as suddenly as they had come.</p>
<p>John Bull and the assistant-surgeon decided that the butt-end
of a carbine had struck the former on the head, and that almost
simultaneously a chopping-sword had struck the butt of the
carbine while it was in contact with his skull, inasmuch as his
head bore no cut, there were splinters of wood in his hair, and a
carbine with a hacked stock lay beside him when he was picked up
and examined. He had nearly been handed over to the burial-party
instead of to the carriers, and, when he realized that the
Bucking Bronco had been carried off, he almost wished that this
had actually happened. Most horrible stories of the fate of
prisoners of the Dahomeyans were current throughout the
expeditionary force, though no proofs of their truth had yet
materialized.</p>
<p>When a list of the killed, wounded, and missing was made out,
it was found that the Sergeant-Major had disappeared also, and
one of the survivors remembered seeing him borne off in a surging
crowd of Amazons, "like a band of big black ants carrying off an
injured wasp," as he graphically described it.</p>
<p>That night John Bull, old Tant de Soif, the Grasshopper, Jan
Minnaerts, Black Gaspard, Achille Martel, and one or two more of
the <i>escouade</i> to which the Bucking Bronco belonged,
volunteered to go out as a scouring-party to reconnoitre for the
enemy, and, incidentally, to try to discover some traces of their
missing comrade and the <i>sous-officier.</i></p>
<p>"Let Jean Boule be in charge," said Lieutenant Roberte,
commanding the remnants of the VIIth Company, <i>vice</i> Captain
Roux, killed in action, "he has some sense, and can use the
stars. If you fall into the hands of the enemy, I shall punish
you severely--give you all a taste of the <i>crapaudine</i>
perhaps. <i>Bonne chance, mes enfants.</i>" . . .</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>"We must turn back, <i>mon ami,"</i> said Martel to John Bull
at last.</p>
<p>"But yes," agreed old Tant de Soif, "it is useless to throw
good meat after bad. . . . They have died their deaths by now--or
are being taken to the sacred city of Kana for sacrifice."</p>
<p>"I smell smoke," suddenly said the Grasshopper, wrinkling his
delicate nostrils. "<i>Nom de Dieu!</i>" he added, "<i>and</i>
burning flesh."</p>
<p>It soon became more than evident that he was right. Either
they were approaching the spot where flesh was being burnt, or a
faint breeze had sprung up and wafted the foul smell in their
direction.</p>
<p>Treading like Dahomeyans themselves, they turned from the
jungle track they had discovered, along another that lay plain in
the moonlight across a little open glade, and seemed to lead in
the direction of the smell. Thousands of bare feet must recently
have made the path--the feet of men hurrying along in single
file. . . .</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Although scarcely recognizable as a human being, the
Sergeant-Major, a huge stalwart Alsatian, was still alive.</p>
<p>Steel and fire had been used with remarkable skill, that so
much could have been done and the spark of life still kept in the
unspeakably tortured, defiled, and mangled body. A score of
Amazons were at work upon him.</p>
<p>The Bucking Bronco, stark naked, but apparently uninjured, was
bound to a young palm. Either he was merely awaiting his turn and
incidentally suffering the ghastly ordeal of seeing the tortures
of the Sergeant-Major and enduring the agonies of anticipation,
or else he was being reserved as an acceptable offering to King
Behanzin and a candidate for the wicker torture-baskets of the
sacrificial slaughter-house of Kana.</p>
<p>"A volley when I shout," whispered John Bull, "then a yell and
the bayonet."</p>
<p>A few seconds later he was killing women, driving his bayonet
into their bodies until the curved hilt struck with a thud. The
thuds gave him infinite pleasure--and then he was violently sick.
Surprised by the sudden volley, ignorant of the strength of their
assailants, and only partly armed, the Amazons broke and
scattered into the jungle. While John Bull, with shaking hands,
prised at the Bucking Bronco's bonds with his sword-bayonet, old
Tant de Soif put a merciful bullet into the brain of the
Sergeant-Major and then busied himself about collecting the
dismembered fragments of that unfortunate.</p>
<p>"For all the world like picking up an old woman's packages
when she has slipped up on a banana-skin," quoth he. He was a
quaint old gentleman, a <i>vieux moustache</i> who had seen many
queer things in his forty years of assorted service in the Line,
the Infanterie de la Marine, and the Legion.</p>
<p>"We daren't stay to bury him," said Martel; "they'll rally and
return in a minute."</p>
<p>As the little party retreated at the <i>pas gymnastique,</i>
the Bucking Bronco remarked to his friend, panting ahead of him,
"Say, John! I allow I'm a what-is-it
henceforth--an'-a-dern-sight-more. You know--a
Miss-Hog-you-beast."</p>
<p>"A <i>what?"</i></p>
<p>"A Miss-Hog-you-beast."</p>
<p>"Yes! What some people call a misogynist. I don't blame
you!"</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c107" id="c107"><i>The MacSnorrt</i></a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>The MacSnorrt was on the downward path, and had been for many
years. Physically, mentally, and morally he was deteriorating;
and as for the other aspects--social, financial, and worldly--he
had been Chief Engineer on a Cunarder, and he was now the
blackest of the black sheep of the VIIIth Company of the First
Battalion of the Legion. From sitting at meals with the
passengers in the First Saloon of a great liner, he had come to
sitting with assorted blackguards over their tin <i>gamelles</i>
of <i>soupe;</i> from drawing hundreds per annum, he had come to
drawing a half-penny per day; his brain was failing from lack of
use and excess of absinthe and mixed alcoholic filth, his superb
health and strength were undermined, and he was becoming a Bad
Man.</p>
<p>The history of his fall is told in one short word--Drink; and
drink had turned a fine, useful, and honourable man into a
degraded ruffian. The man who had thought of fame, wealth,
inventions, patents, knighthood--now thought of the successful
shikarring of the next drink, or the stealing of the wherewithal
to get it. Whether this poor soul were married and the father of
a family, I never knew, and did not care to ask, but it is quite
probable that he was. Such men usually are. Let us hope he was
not. Sober, he was a truculent, morose, and savage
ruffian--ashamed of his ashamedness, hating himself and everybody
else, dangerous and vile; a bad soldier till the fighting began,
and then worth two. Drunk, he was exceedingly amusing, and one
caught glimpses of the kindly, witty, and genial original.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The best of soldiers, be he <i>Maréchal</i> or <i>Soldat
deuxième classe,</i> as was the MacSnorrt, may be overcome by a
combination and alliance of foes, any one of whom he could defeat
alone.</p>
<p>As the MacSnorrt endeavoured to make clear to Captain
d'Armentières next day, it was merely the conjunction against him
of a good dinner, Haiphong, the stupeedity of the Annamese male
in wearing a chignon and a petticoat like a wumman,
<i>shum-shum,</i> sunstroke, and his own beautiful but ardent
disposition, that had been his undoing. With any one of these he
could have coped; by their unholy alliance he had been--he freely
admitted it--completely defeated.</p>
<p>Captain d'Armentières heard him with courtesy, and awarded him
eight days' <i>salle de police</i> and the <i>peloton de
chasse</i> with sympathy.</p>
<p>He had known of similar fortuitous concatenations of adverse
circumstance before in connection with le Legionnaire
MacSnorrt.</p>
<p>It was the Captain's <i>ordonnance,</i> one Jean Boule, who
had, luckily for that reveller, discovered the MacSnortt and
encompassed his capture by a strong picket.</p>
<p>Passing a pagoda one night, he had heard, uplifted in
monologue, a rich voice whose accents, or accent, he had heard
before, that of the MacSnorrt, the Bad Man of the VIIIth Company,
recently arrived in a draft from Sidibel-Abbès to reinforce the
VIIth after certain painful dealings with the Pavillons Noirs,
the "pirates" of the Yen Thé.</p>
<p>Mingled with, but far from subduing the vinous voice and
hiccups of the MacSnorrt, were the angry murmurings, quick
whispers, and the lisping and clicking voices of a native
Annamese and Chinese crowd.</p>
<p>Was the fool interfering with those so-tender "religious
susceptibilities," and intruding upon priests and their flock in
search of moral consolation and fortification? He had no business
in there at all.</p>
<p>Following the wall and rounding a corner, Jean Boule came to a
gate. Pushing it open gently, he looked in.</p>
<p>Reclining majestically upon the ground, his back against the
wall, was the MacSnorrt. In his vast left paw was a bottle of
<i>shum-shum,</i> the deadly, maddening spirit distilled from
rice. Clasped by his mighty right arm to his colossal bosom, the
MacSnorrt held--a <i>doi</i> or Sergeant of Tirailleurs
Tonkinois! <sup>1</sup></p>
<p> </p>
<p><sup>1</sup> Known as <i>Les Jeunes Filles</i> to the Legion,
by reason of their long hair.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The little man, his lacquered hat, with its red bonnet-strings
on one side, his cignon in grave disarray, looked even more like
a devil than was his normal wont, as he struggled violently to
escape from his degrading and undignified situation.</p>
<p>It was clear that, if the Annamese could get at his bayonet,
there would be a vacancy at the head of the clan of MacSnorrt and
at the tail of the VIIIth Company of the Legion.</p>
<p>"Lie ye still, lassie," adjured the gigantic Legionary, as his
captive struggled again vainly, for the great right arm was not
only round his waist, but round both his arms, and he could only
pick at the handle of his bayonet with ineffectual
finger-tips.</p>
<p>"Lie ye still, ye wee prood besom, or I'll e'en tak' ane o'
the ither lasses to ma boosom," threatened the MacSnorrt, but
softened the apparent harshness of the threat by a warm lingering
kiss upon the yellow cheek of the murderously savage soldier.</p>
<p>He then applied the <i>shum-shum</i> bottle to his lips,
poured a libation of the crude and poisonous spirit, and then
frankly explained to his captive that he had not selected "her"
from among the other "sonsie lassies" by reason of any superior
beauty, but simply because he liked her saucy fancy-dress--quite
like a <i>vivaandière,</i> and he had always had a tender spot in
his hearrt o' hearrts for a <i>vivaandière.</i></p>
<p>The enraged and half-demented Sergeant screamed to the little
crowd of priests, loafers, coolies and Haiphong citizens to knife
the foreign devil, or, taking his bayonet, to drive it in under
his ear. . . . The crowd allowed "I dare not" to wait upon "I
would"--for the moment.</p>
<p>"Aye! . . . Oo-aye! It's not Jock MacSnorrt that could reseest
the blaandishments o' onny little deevil o' a
<i>vivaandière,</i>" confessed the aged roué. . . . "It was for
the sake o' the <i>vivaandières</i> I joined the French airrmy,
ye'll ken--when I was an innocent slip o' a laddie. . . .
Romaantic! . . .</p>
<p>"Aye--an' they're mostly fat auld runts wi' twa chins," he
added, with a sudden fall to pessimism and confession of
disillusionment.</p>
<p>"'Tis the ruin o' the British Airrmy, ye'll ken," he confided
to the ugly crowd that gradually closed in around him, "that they
hae no <i>vivaandières</i> to comfort the puir laddies. . . . Hae
the Gorrdons onny <i>vivaandières,</i> I'll ask ye? The
Seaforrths? The Caamerons? The Heelan' Light Infantry? The Royal
Scots? . . . They hanna. It a' comes o' such matters being in the
han's o' the Southrons--the drunken an' lasceevious deils. Look

I'll tell ye a' aboot the warrst o' the lot--when I lossed ma

<p>"<i>Wull</i> ye bide quiet, ma bonnie wean? Or shall I send ye

<p>"Eh! maan, a naval engagement's graand. Watter everywheer! On

<p>"May a cat tread on your heart!" hissed the struggling <i>doi.
"</i>May dragons tear you! May the bellies of mudfish be your
grave! May you be cast on a Mountain of Knives." . . .</p>
<p>"What did ye say, lassie? <i>Why</i> do they want watter on

arrms, legs, noses, ears, toes, fingers--ye wouldna hae them

<p>"Bide ye quiet, <i>kuniang,</i> or ye won't be a
<i>kuniang</i> much longer, I'm thinkin'. Aye! Dozens o' gaallons
o' watter. Everywheer. Hoses playin' a' aboot the plaace. Pumps
squirrtin' it. Inches o' it on the decks. An' <i>blood!</i> Ma

<p>"Devils draw your entrails!" panted the writhing
<i>doi.</i></p>
<p>"Eh? Bullets, d'ye say? That's wheer ye're wrang, lassie. Na!
Na!--Eyes, arrms, legs, noses, ears, toes, fingers! Ye'd scarcely

An' a maan wull stoop to fish up a shell for the gun--an' what'll

<p>"Be the graves of your ancestors torn open by pariah dogs and
their bones devoured!" cursed the Sergeant, getting one arm free
at last.</p>
<p>"Bring up a shell, d'ye say, ma wean? More likely an eye or an
arrm or a leg, or a nose or an ear or a toe or a finger frae
beneath that fearfu' flood. . . . Oo-aye! Meelions o' gaallons o'

spare-parts o' the human forrm divine! Meelions o' gaallons o'
watter. Yarrds deep on the decks. They always hae it the like o'
that in a naval engagement. Aye--I seen hunnerds . . ." and the
<i>doi</i> had got at his bayonet at last. Then the <i>bonze</i>
struck heavy blows upon the big bell hanging near in its
bamboo-frame support, and the crowd closed in. If the <i>doi</i>
struck, they would hack and tear this foreign devil to
pieces.</p>
<p>With a w<i>eeeep</i> of steel on steel the bayonet cleared the
scabbard and the <i>doi</i> struck at his captor's throat as John
Bull sprang forward. But the sound of the drawing of the bayonet
had an extraordinary effect on the MacSnorrt--and it was with the
weapon held only in his left hand that the <i>doi</i> struck--and
missed. Seizing him by the throat with both huge hands the
Légionnaire scrambled to his feet and used him as a battering-ram
in his headlong roaring drive at the closing knife-drawing
crowd.</p>
<p>With a yell of "Ye doomed dirrty Jael!" he wrenched the
bayonet from the little Annamese and flung him headlong as the
crowd gave back.</p>
<p>John Bull sprang to his side, and the two in a whirling,
punching, struggling plunge fought their way to the gate, burst
through it--and were promptly arrested by the picket, opportunely
passing.</p>
<p>With these new enemies the MacSnorrt did further battle, until
a tap on the head from a Gras rifle in the skilful hands of
Sergeant Legros brought him to that state in which he was perhaps
best--unconsciousness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c108" id="c108"><i>"Belzébuth"</i></a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>We were heavy sportsmen (<i>à l'Anglaise</i>) at Bellevue at
that time. Not only did we lay out a race-course, but we imported
hounds and performed the <i>Chasse au renard.</i> We got up
point-to-point races and paper-chases. There were actually
Ladies' races, and some folk went so far as to talk about
pig-sticking.</p>
<p>"Of course, Madame Merlonorot will ride when she comes out to
Algeria?" asked Madame Paës.</p>
<p>"<i>Dieu!</i> Rather!" replied Colonel Merlonorot of the
Zouaves. "I am on the look-out for a good thing for her now. She
wants all the equine perfections embodied in one Arab pony. Won't
keep a string. . . . Too much bother. . . . Must have won a good
race or two, must have been hunted by a lady, must hack quietly
in both saddles, must trap, and be trusted to take no exception
to camels, Arab music, whirling dervishes, or fireworks. Also he
must make the promenade in the governess-cart upon occasion!
What?"</p>
<p>"It's a far cry from the race-course to the governess-cart,
isn't it?" inquired Madame Paës.</p>
<p>"Yes. But she'll expect me to produce all that in the next
month--and not to spend more than about three thousand francs! .
. . Let's know if you hear of anything that might meet most of
the requirements--and available within the month, will you, dear
Madame? Must be a racer, though--and that limits the field when
you're looking for a hack. . . . She's great on Ladies'
Point-to-Points, Hunt-races, <i>Chasse au renard,</i> and
everything you can do on a horse. She would play <i>le polo</i>
and would pursue the pig with a spear if I would consent!"</p>
<p>"I will remember, Colonel--and I have an idea. . . . Three
thousand francs for a pony that meets all the
specifications?"</p>
<p>"About that, and a thousand thanks. Must be young,
thoroughbred, and something to look at--and be vetted sound all
over, of course." . . .</p>
<p>Three thousand francs! It would mean Home this year instead of
next. Paris in Spring! It would mean avoiding the awful
prostrating heat of <i>la canicule</i> for the babies--neither of
them robust, both of them showing the signs of French babyhood
kept too long in Africa's forcing-house. It might mean life to
one or both of them, especially with the usual cholera, smallpox,
typhoid, and dysentery epidemics about, as they grew weaker. And
Guillaume needed his long-overdue leave badly. He was overworked,
run down, ill, and his temper--never very good--was getting
unbearable. Fancy having leave and being too poor to take it!
What a shame it was that the condition of the majority of married
junior officers of the XIXth Army Corps should be one of cruel
grinding poverty, pitiful shifts to keep up appearances, and a
weary, heart-breaking struggle to make ends meet. Well, one must
"drag the lengthening chain" and, having once clasped it on, must
take the consequences. One can't start life afresh in France at
thirty odd--and, well, one can always hope, or nearly always. And
one might win a prize in the Lottery. (Think of it! One's chief
hope for a brighter future, a chance of winning a prize in the
Lottery!) . . . Three thousand francs!</p>
<p>But young Belzébuth had never run a race in his life and never
taken part in the <i>Chasse au renard</i> nor the pursuit of the
spear-threatened pig, unless, perhaps, when he had had an English
master in Maroc. Still, he was a real picture, was rising seven,
sound as a bell, quiet as a mouse, and undoubtedly
thoroughbred.</p>
<p>He hacked in both saddles and was a fast and steady
trapper--and took the babies for an airing daily. Certainly he
had a turn of speed--and there was simply no tiring him.</p>
<p>He would take Guillaume (a very bad and nervous rider) for a
ride in the morning, and in the trap to the barracks after
breakfast. He would bring him home to lunch, and then take the
babies for their drive in the evening.</p>
<p>Sometimes he would finish up the day by taking the trap to a
distant villa when a dinner-party was toward. And when Guillaume
was away on man&oelig;uvres or marches, Madame Paës, horse-woman
born and bred, got her only riding.</p>
<p>Three thousand francs! And Guillaume had bought him for two
hundred francs when Lieutenant d'Amienville--who ought not to be
allowed to keep a pig or a pariah dog, much less a horse--went
away. Starved, neglected, and dying for want of work, Belzébuth
had looked a bad bargain at 200 fcs. A man ought not to go
unprosecuted who buys a horse and uses a motor-car, leaving the
horse to the mercy of a rascally <i>homard</i> who feeds it on
offal and never takes it out of the stall. Her heart had ached
when she had seen the staring coat, blear eye, and overgrown
hoofs of the walking skeleton that Lieutenant d'Amienville swore
had cost him, raw, a couple of thousand francs. She could have
hung her sun-hat on him in a dozen places. But she knew a good
horse when she saw one. Had not her father run his own horses at
Longchamps and Auteuil before he went bankrupt?</p>
<p>And, under her care, Belzébuth had soon changed into a picture
of bright, sleek, healthy happiness, and had served them
exceedingly well.</p>
<p>Could she make him worth three thousand francs before
Guillaume returned from man&oelig;uvres, sell him to Colonel
Merlonorot (her father's old comrade), and put the money into
Guillaume's hand, saying, "Book the passages for Marseilles
to-morrow, <i>mon ange.</i>"</p>
<p>Could she? For, the utmost screwing and scraping, the most
optimistic view of the saleable value of the few goods and
chattels, the estimating the cheapest and nastiest journey to
Paris--left a gaping chasm of a good thousand francs between hope
and realization of a holiday in La Ville Lumière. No, nothing
could bridge it--unless Belzébuth would fetch three thousand
francs instead of the three or four hundred they had expected.
Five hundred was the highest Guillaume had ever dreamed of--and
that was after a cheery dinner at some Mess and a little
champagne.</p>
<p>Even five hundred would be a profit of a hundred and fifty per
cent. she believed.</p>
<p>Yes--four hundred would be cent. per cent., and five would be
half as much again.</p>
<p>What would three thousand be on two hundred? Fifteen per
cent.? No, of course not. Fifteen hundred per cent.? It sounded
impossible.</p>
<p>And of course it was impossible.</p>
<p>Still--she would add five pounds of <i>avoine</i> daily to
Belzébuth's <i>blé</i> and <i>son,</i> and start training him
while Guillaume was away. She would join the club of the
<i>Chasse au renard</i> at once, and she would enter for the
Ladies' Race in the Desert Point-to-Point, which would be run
just three weeks hence at Bellevue.</p>
<p>But what a terrible plunge! A hundred francs to the
<i>cercle,</i> and Heaven alone knew what oats were fetching. Or
perhaps she could hunt three or four times only, and pay a small
donation or something? And she could certainly, avoid getting the
Beaune that Médecin-Major Parme had ordered her to take, since
she had had malarial fever, and use the money for oats. But what
a speculation! It is an ill-wind that blows no good at all--the
fever had reduced her weight, and she could ride at about seven
stone now.</p>
<p>But what would Guillaume say of the wasted money--if she
failed? Well, it wouldn't be all waste, for Belzébuth's value
would go up, in any case, if she hunted him well and he got a
place in the Point-to-Point.</p>
<p>The proverbs say that where there is a will there is a way,
and that Heaven helps those that help themselves.</p>
<p>She would simply <i>live</i> to sell Belzébuth to dear rich
old Colonel Merlonorot for three thousand francs, as a racer,
hunter, hack in both saddles, bright trapper, and confidential
nursery-pony! For the next month she would give mind, soul, and
body to winning the Desert Point-to-Point. . . .</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Belzébuth was taken for a long quiet ride next morning, and
for another in the evening, and his mistress personally
superintended his feed and toilet.</p>
<p>Next day he was introduced to a new and glorious place where
the going was beautiful and you went straight ahead between
railings, with plenty of room and no obstacles.</p>
<p>He took his furlong burst on the race-course at a good pace,
and improved daily at two, three, and four furlongs.</p>
<p>Madame Paës' notions of training were original, but based on
the sound principle, "Train for what you have to do by repeatedly
doing it--and work up gradually to the first doing."</p>
<p>After a week Belzébuth was doing his mile on the racecourse
and doing it uncommon well (as one or two observers noted). Also
he went down the lane of jumps cleverly and willingly,
beautifully schooled.</p>
<p>One morning, Colonel Merlonorot noticed Madame Paës at the
meet, on a very likely-looking bay Arab--good in the legs, well
ribbed up, high in the withers, and with a blood look about him.
("He liked the look of that beast. <i>Nom d'un pipe,</i> he
did!")</p>
<p>Madame Paës had not hunted since she had scrambled about with
the North Devons in Angleterre--a long-legged, long-haired Diana
of fourteen (at a Devonshire school) on a fat pony.</p>
<p>She was now a tiny, slim, pale, big-eyed Diana of
twenty-four--and as good as a jockey.</p>
<p>But she looked as though she had been too long in Exile (which
was exactly the case), and fitter for a deck-chair on a
homeward-bound liner than for a saddle in the hunting-field. . .
.</p>
<p>When would they get off? How would Belzébuth behave? Would he
belie his nursery mildness and go <i>fou</i> when it was a case
of full cry and all away? Would the unwonted oats and the rousing
on the race-course and over the jumps react unfavourably now for
the weak-backed, weary rider? He was certain to be
<i>méchant,</i> and might buck or bolt. Would trembling hands and
aching arms be unable to hold him? How her back ached, too! . . .
Dear old Belzébuth, be good! It's for the babies and Guillaume. .
. . God knew she'd sooner be in bed than in the midst of this gay
throng of strong and happy men and women, well-content,
well-clad, well-fed. . . .</p>
<p>Well-fed! A melancholy fact. Madame Paës, wife of a French
commissioned officer, was not well fed. A woman of the unselfish
sort does not buy costly tonic-foods, dainties, and wines, and
eat the money that is sorely needed for other things. For plain
food she had no appetite. To people who have been brought up in a
chateau atmosphere, an income--which to <i>ci-devant</i> dwellers
in Montmartre or the bourgeois suburbs is wealth--may be
degrading poverty.</p>
<p>The Paës had expenses which it was due to their honour and
proper pride to have--and which are not due to the honour and
proper pride of the bourgeoisie. . . . And these expenses and the
health of Guillaume and the babies came before food and clothes
for Madame Paës, in Madame Paës' opinion.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>A note of music from the clump of jungle that had swallowed up
the hounds. A crash of the grand wild music. A line! Hounds are
off and the first "run" is on.</p>
<p>Belzébuth commenced by a series of bounds, the outcome of a
high and joyous heart, good feeding, and good condition. He felt
a touch of the curb, arched his back in protest and went along at
a smart canter, a vision of dainty horse-flesh.</p>
<p>The jackal got into a vineyard, was put out again, and had to
make for open country.</p>
<p>It was fine going, and Madame Paës let Belzébuth go. He
went--and in five minutes the first rider behind the Master was
Madame Paës, and she was holding Belzébuth in, or he would have
passed the Master's big Syrian-Barb who was doing his possible
under Colonel de Longueville's fifteen stone.</p>
<p>When the end came, Madame Paës was in at the death, lengths
ahead of the second arrival, and minutes ahead of the field.
Belzébuth had hardly turned a hair, and the Master presented the
rider with the brush and a compliment. Madame Paës took her pony
home, the while the field jogged on to the next likely cactus
covert.</p>
<p>In another week Belzébuth was doing two kilometres on the
race-course, morning and evening.</p>
<p>At the next meet, a very long run (twenty-two kilometres, the
Master said) was finished by a field of four arriving thus: the
Master and Madame Paës together; Captain Dutoit of the Spahis,
seconds later; fourth man, Major Bruil of the Chasseurs
d'Afrique, minutes later. Rest nowhere--and strung out for miles.
Belzébuth had been held, while the other horses had been
spurred.</p>
<p>Belzébuth hunted twice more, and the hunt-correspondent of the
"Depêche Algérienne" singled him out for high praise.</p>
<p>Madame Paës dropped race-course practice and hunting, and let
him do exercise walks in the compound on one day, and a
point-to-point run on another.</p>
<p>Riding out alone to some scrubby, sandy jungle, she would
endeavour to estimate a two-kilometre distance, note a clump of
palms, a tree, a hut, a hillock, and other natural landmarks, and
then ride from one to the other at Belzébuth's best speed.</p>
<p>Once she had a narrow escape of settling the question of
Belzébuth's value, and all other values, finally. Emerging at a
furious gallop from a cactus-strewn area, in which pace could
only be maintained and disaster avoided by skilful "bending," she
came upon a beautiful smooth patch with a gentle rise ending
in--a <i>wadi</i> or gully, thirty feet deep and fifty wide. She
realized the fact in time to bring Belzébuth round in a curve
that missed the precipice by inches.</p>
<p>On the Wednesday before the Saturday on which the race would
be run, Madame Paës took Belzébuth out for his last training
gallop. In the middle of it she put him at a <i>terrasse,</i> a
"bund," or low earthen embankment, round what had once been a
cultivated field.</p>
<p>The three-foot banks Belzébuth preferred to clear. The
four-foot variety he liked to treat as on-and-offs--alighting on
the two-foot top and leaving it like a bird.</p>
<p>This particular bank was a delusion and a snare.</p>
<p>Though fair-seeming to the eye on Madame Paës' side of it, on
the other it was eroded, crumbling, beetling.</p>
<p>Belzébuth landed beautifully on the top--and horse and rider
went down in a cloud of dust and an avalanche of clods and
stones.</p>
<p>The horse turned a complete somersault across the woman.</p>
<p>But the flood that had caused the erosion had made some amends
by scooping a channel at the base of the undermined bank, and
instead of breaking every bone in Madame Paës' body and crushing
her chest, Belzébuth's weight forced her into this channel and
rested on its sides.</p>
<p>He arose and stood steady as a troop-horse.</p>
<p>His mistress lay still and white.</p>
<p>Soon she stirred, sat up--and straightened her tricorne hat.
Then, too shaken to stand, sick and faint, giddy and stunned, not
knowing whether she was seriously injured, she crawled to
Belzébuth and examined his knees.</p>
<p>"<i>Oh! Thank God!</i>" she whispered, on finding that,
instead of being broken as she had expected, they were
unmarked.</p>
<p>What did her own injuries matter so long as Belzébuth's knees
were right?</p>
<p>A blemish there--and two hundred francs was his price.</p>
<p>An hour later, Madame Paës, looking like death on a bay horse,
rode into the compound of her villa and went straight to bed.</p>
<p>Next day she could not move.</p>
<p>On the Friday she was better, but unable to get up.</p>
<p>On Saturday she would leave her bed and, if necessary, be
carried downstairs, driven to the starting-point, and lifted on
to Belzébuth.</p>
<p>Who could ride him for her at seven stone--and ride him as she
would? Nobody.</p>
<p>All Bellevue was <i>en route</i> for the scene of the famous
Bellevue Point-to-Point races, consisting of team-races for
horses, another for ponies, a handicap, and an open race for
quadrupeds of any size and bipeds of any weight.</p>
<p>Then came the Ladies' Point-to-Point, over two and a half
kilometres of fairly good course and a few jumps.</p>
<p>The ordinary course was a stiff one, and so arranged that a
really bold and resolute rider could shorten the distance on the
average man by taking <i>wadis,</i> and the other "places" that
discretion would ride round.</p>
<p>The Ladies' Course included nothing that gave the stout heart
and strong seat a marked advantage. So much the worse for Madame
Paës, who was out, not so much to win a race and glory, as to win
health and happiness, possibly life itself, for her children and
husband.</p>
<p>A large crowd, on horseback for the most part, surrounded the
tents (where the officers of the <i>Chasseurs d'Afrique</i> were
"At Home"), the starting-point, and neighbouring
winning-post.</p>
<p>Madame Paës lay in a long chair, with closed eyes--while the
men's four races were run--limp, relaxed, and weary to death.</p>
<p>Oh, for a cushion to put under her weak and aching back!--and
oh, for a <i>petit verre</i> of <i>eau de vie</i> to give her
heart and strength! But her idolized Guillaume (a prig of the
first water and petty domestic tyrant) did not "approve" of
alcohol for ladies. There were so many things of which Guillaume
did not "approve" for other people, though he appeared to approve
of most things for Guillaume.</p>
<p>At last! The bell for the Ladies' Point-to-Point, the most
popular and famous race in the Colony.</p>
<p>Madame Paës mounted Belzébuth and walked him to the
starting-point.</p>
<p>Nine competitors.</p>
<p>Colonel Lebrun's wife on the pride of the Chasseurs (but a
heavy, bumping, mouth-sawing rider who would spoil any horse's
chance).</p>
<p>Madame Maxin on a characterless, unreliable racer.</p>
<p>Little Angélique Dandin, on her brother's one and only
pony.</p>
<p>Madame Malherbe, cool, quiet, neat, and businesslike, on a
light and dainty black mare with slender legs but powerful
quarters.</p>
<p>Major Parme's wife on the best horse that her money could
buy--but a woman who thought far more of hat, habit, and figure
than of seat and hands.</p>
<p>Madame Deville, riding (astride) her husband's charger and
intending to win if spur and quirt would do it.</p>
<p>Colonel de Longueville's wife, a fine horsewoman, handsome,
smart, and clever, on the pick of her husband's racing-stable.
And a couple of quidnuncs.</p>
<p>A bad field to beat.</p>
<p>Betting was on Madame Maxin if her horse "behaved." If he
didn't, Madame de Longueville must win in a common canter.</p>
<p>Strangers liked the look of Madame Malherbe, but local wisdom
knew her mare couldn't live with the two other.</p>
<p>General Blanc, starter, drew the attention of the ladies to a
pair of red flags half a kilometre away, a pair of blue ones to
the right of these and half a kilometre from them, another pair
of red to the right of the "field," and a pair of white, at
present behind their backs and some three furlongs distant.</p>
<p>"You must pass between the red flags, then between the blue,
then the red, and lastly between the white, and finish here,"
said he. "There is nothing serious in the way of ditch or wall.
Pick your own route--and any competitor not passing between the
flags is, of course, disqualified."</p>
<p>A silly question from Madame Lebrun--politely answered.</p>
<p>All ready? . . . The flag falls.</p>
<p>Madame Paës thanked Heaven they were away at last.</p>
<p>A hundred yards from the starting-point is a brushwood jump
which must be taken--or a large patch of dense cactus-jungle
skirted to the left or right.</p>
<p>Should she try and take it first of all?</p>
<p>She hated jumping in company. Yes. A flick told Belzébuth he
might stretch himself for a bit, and he cleared the jump ten
lengths ahead of the next horse.</p>
<p>"<i>Nom de Dieu!</i> It's an 'outsider's year,'" said General
Blanc. "Bar accidents, that's the winner. Who is she?"</p>
<p>Madame Lebrun's horse--with a round dozen stone hanging on his
mouth--refused; the lady and the animal parted company, and the
subsequent proceedings interested them no more.</p>
<p>Madame Parme elected to skirt the jungle, and was out of the
race from that moment.</p>
<p>A quidnunc took alarm at the pace and pulled with all her
strength.</p>
<p>The virtueless and evil-reputed racer drew level with
Belzébuth, Madame Maxin spurring, and Madame de Longueville
passed both.</p>
<p>Madame Paës was holding Belzébuth in from the moment he had
cleared the first jump.</p>
<p>Madame Deville began flogging, like a jockey, in the first
quarter-mile of the race, and passed Madame de Longueville with a
spurt. Shortly after she took fifth place and kept it. . . .</p>
<p>Between the first flags passed Madame de Longueville with the
wicked racer at her girth and Belzébuth at her tail, Madame
Malherbe a dozen lengths behind, and Madame Deville thirty.</p>
<p>Angélique Dandin came later in the day, having lost her way.
Neither quidnunc continued her wild career to this point. . .
.</p>
<p>Gradually the distance between the leading three and the
following two lengthened--and, for a kilometre, Madame Paës,
Madame de Longueville, and Madame Maxin ran neck and neck.</p>
<p>Suddenly the bad-charactered racer took a line of his own,
missed the next flags by a few metres, and bolted into the
desert. At the second flags, Madame de Longueville led, Belzébuth
consenting--or rather, being made, to consent; Madame Malherbe,
creeping up, passed the flags three lengths behind, and Angélique
Dandin, catching Madame Deville, led her through, a score lengths
in rear. . . .</p>
<p>Madame Paës was filled with hope.</p>
<p>Should she let Belzébuth out yet? No, not till the last
flags--if she could live so long--if her heart would beat instead
of stabbing--if her brain would not reel so--if the blue mist
would clear from her eyes.</p>
<p>(Those who had climbed to points of vantage shouted that
Madame de Longueville would win in a walk--had led from the
start--was going strong--except for that dark horse which seemed
to manage to hang on. . . .)</p>
<p>A fairish jump ahead--should she pass Madame de Longueville?
No, let her take it first, and let Belzébuth save himself for the
three-furlong run home.</p>
<p>At the last flags Madame de Longueville led by twenty lengths,
Madame Paës second, Madame Malherbe third, Angélique Dandin a
neck behind, and Madame Deville, still flogging, a safe
fifth.</p>
<p>And then Madame Paës gave Belzébuth a sharp flick, raised her
bridle hand, and called to him.</p>
<p>The roar of applause and welcome to Madame de Longueville died
down with curious suddenness as Belzébuth sprang forward, passed
Madame de Longueville's lathered grey Arab as though he were
standing, forged rapidly and steadily ahead, and, finishing in a
quiet canter, won the race by a good furlong. Madame Paës reeled
in the saddle and fell heavily into the arms of Colonel
Merlonorot, who came forward to help her to dismount.</p>
<p>"Splendid! Splendid!" said he. "<i>Mon Dieu!</i> If I hadn't
just bought my wife a horse, I'd ask if that pony of yours is for
sale. You should run him at Longchamps!"</p>
<p>. . . "<i>If I hadn't just bought my wife a horse</i>". . .
what was he saying? "<i>If I hadn't just bought my wife a
horse,</i> I'd ask if that pony of yours is for sale." . . .</p>
<p>Then it was all for nothing--and money wasted!</p>
<p>Madame Paës fainted quietly and privately in a comfortable
chair at the back of the empty reception-tent of the Spahis.</p>
<p>Colonel Merlonorot drove her home in his uncomfortable high
dogcart--(quite <i>à l'Anglaise).</i></p>
<p>Just time to change and rest before Guillaume arrived. . .
.</p>
<p>He burst into her room, looking fagged, white, and weary--and
his greeting, after five weeks' absence, was--</p>
<p>"What on earth have you been doing with my horse? It's as lame
as a tree, and the <i>valet</i> has got its near fore in a bucket
of hot water. . . . It's a shame, I say. . . . The only horse I
have got, and you can't take a little care of it! What am I to do
to-morrow? I suppose it doesn't trouble <i>you</i> that I must
cycle to barracks in the sun? . . . <i>Peste! . . . Nom d'un
Nom!</i> . . ." and much more.</p>
<p>Poor Guillaume! He was so overworked and ill--but she wept
bitterly, and, lying awake all night, wished she were dead. But a
note was handed in at breakfast, next morning, from Colonel de
Longueville, which ran:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"DEAR MADAME,<br>
<br>
"I should like to offer my very hearty congratulations on your,
and your pony's performance yesterday, and to ask whether your
husband would take 4,000 fcs. for him.<br>
<br>
"I gave that for the pony that Belzébuth left standing
yesterday--so it's not a very brilliant offer. I should train him
for bigger things.<br>
<br>
"With my most distinguished regards and compliments,</blockquote>
<blockquote style="text-align:right;">"HENRI DE
LONGUEVILLE,  <br>
"Colonel."  </blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Madame Paës, being very weak and tired, wept again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c109" id="c109"><i>The Quest</i></a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Ex-</i>No. 32867, <i>Soldat première classe,</i> shuffled
out of the main gate of the barracks of the First Battalion of La
Legion Étrangère at Sidi-bel-Abbès for the last time, and without
a farewell glance at that hideous yellow building. He had once
been Geoffry Brabazon-Howard, Esquire, of St. James's Street and
the United Service Club, but no one would have thought it of the
stooping, decrepit creature in the ill-fitting blue suit of
ready-made (and very badly made) mufti, the tam-o'-shanter cap
and blue scarf, from the <i>fourrier-sergents</i> store. He
looked more like a Basque bear-leader whose bear has been
impounded, or an Italian organ-grinder who has had to pawn his
organ--save that the rather vacant eye in the leathern face was
grey and the hair, beneath the <i>beret,</i> of a Northern
fairness. A careful observer (such as a mother or wife, had he
had one to observe him) would have noticed that his hands shook
like those of an old man, that his eyes were heavy and
blood-shot, as though from sleeplessness, and that his legs did
not appear to be completely under control. A casual passer-by
might have supposed him to be slightly drunk, or recovering from
a drunken bout.</p>
<p>He had that day received his discharge from the Legion, his
bonus as holder of the <i>médaille</i> and <i>croix,</i> his
papers and travelling-warrant to any place in France, the
blessing of his Captain, and the cheery assurance of
Médecin-Major Parme that he was suffering from cerebro-spinal
sclerosis, and would gradually but surely develop into a
paralysed lunatic.</p>
<p>Certainly he felt very ill. He was in no great pain, and he
regretted the fact. He would far rather have felt the acutest
pain than the strange sensation that there was a semi-opaque veil
between himself and his fellow-men, that he lived quite alone and
unapproachable in a curious cloud, and that, although he slept
but little, he lived in a dream. He was also much distressed by
the feeling that his hands were as large and thick as
boxing-gloves, that his feet had soles of thick felt, and that he
had <i>fourmis</i> (pins-and-needles) in his legs. He would
gladly have exchanged the terrible feeling of weakness (and
imminent collapse) in the small of his back for any kind of pain.
And, above all things, he wanted <i>rest.</i> Not sleep! Heaven
forbid. Sleep was the portal of a Hell unnameable and
unimaginable, and the worst of it was that insomnia led to the
very same place, and one lived on the horns of a dilemma. If one
did things to keep oneself awake, they either lost their efficacy
and one slept (and fell into Hell) or one got insomnia (and
crawled there with racking, bursting head and eyes that burnt the
brain).</p>
<p>Rest! That was it. Well--he had done his five years in the
Legion and got his discharge. Why shouldn't he rest? He would
rest forthwith, before he set out upon his Quest, the last
undertaking of his life.</p>
<p>He sat down on the <i>pavé</i> in the shade of the Spahis'
barracks and leant against the wall. In five seconds he was
asleep.</p>
<p>Later, two gens d'armes passed. One turned back and kicked
him. "Get out of this," said he tersely.</p>
<p><i>Ex-</i>No. 32867 of the Premiere Legion Étrangère staggered
to his feet with what speed he might.</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon," said he in English. "I am afraid . . ."
and then he realized who and what and where he was.</p>
<p>Mechanically he walked back to barracks and made to enter the
great main gate. The sentry stopped him, and the Sergeant of the
Guard came up.</p>
<p>"By no means, verminous <i>pékin,"</i> <sup>1</sup> quoth
Sergeant Legros. "Is this a doss-house for every dirty tramp of a
broken-down <i>pékin</i> that chooses to enter and defile it?"
and he ordered the sentry to fling the thing out. "But that a
French bayonet must not be used as a stable-fork, I would . . ."
he began again, but <i>Ex-</i>No. 32867 perceived that this was
not the place of Rest, and shuffled away again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><sup>1</sup> <i>Pékin =</i> civilian.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sergeant Legros spat after him. If there was one thing he
hated more than a Legionary, it was a time-expired man, a vile
dog who had survived his treatment and escaped his clutches. . .
.</p>
<p><i>Ex-</i>No. 32867 passed along the barrack wall, his eyes
staring vaguely ahead. If he might not sit on the ground and
could not get back to his <i>chambrée</i> and cot, where could he
go for rest? He could not set forth upon his Quest until he had
rested. His back was too near the breaking-point, his knees too
weak, his feet too uncertain. There were seats in the gardens by
the Porte de Tlemçen, if he could get so far. But in the Place
Sadi Carnot he suddenly found that he had sat down. Well--he
would. . . . He fell asleep at once. . . .</p>
<p>The gendarme seemed very suspicious, but that is only natural
in a gendarme. Yes--the papers were apparently in order, but he
would do well to remember that the gendarme had his eye upon him.
He could go, this time--so, <i>Marche!</i>--and sit down no more
for a siesta in the middle of the road. . . .</p>
<p>Where was it he had been going for a rest? . . . A bright
idea--<i>Carmelita's!</i> She would let him rest, and, if not too
busy, would see that he did not fall asleep and go to Hell. . .
.</p>
<p>"Bon jour, mon ami!" cried Carmelita, as he entered the little
Café de la Légion. "Che cosa posse offrirve? Seet daown. What you
drink?"</p>
<p><i>Ex-</i>No. 32867 raised his <i>beret,</i> bowed, smiled,
and fell asleep across a table. Carmelita raised puzzled brows.
Drunk at this time of day? She pulled him backward on to the
wooden bench, untied his scarf, and, going to her room behind the
bar, returned with an old cushion which she thrust beneath his
head. He at once sat up, thanked her politely, and walked out of
the café.</p>
<p>"Eh! Madonna! These English," shrugged Carmelita, and resumed
her work. If one stopped to notice the eccentricities of every
half-witted Légionnaire, one might spend one's life at it. . .
.</p>
<p><i>Ex-</i>No. 32867 strolled slowly along to the
railway-station, showed his papers to the Sergeant of the Guard
on duty there, sat him down, and went to sleep. Five minutes
later he arose, approached the ticket-office, tried hard for a
minute to penetrate the half-opaque veil that hung between him
and his fellow-men, and then sat down beneath the <i>guichet</i>
and went to sleep. . . .</p>
<p>The station-master was doing his best to make it clear that he
hated filth, dust, dead leaves, stray pariah dogs, discharged
Legionaries, and similar kinds of offal to remain unswept from
the clean floor of his station.</p>
<p>The awakened man peered hard through the half-opaque veil that
hung between him and the great man, made a mighty effort of
concentration, and then said quite distinctly:</p>
<p>"I want a third single to Oran. I am starting on my Quest,
after waiting five years."</p>
<p>"Then wait another five hours, Mr. Discharged Legionary," said
the functionary, "and come again at 9.20 for your third single to
Oran--if you are not too drunk. Meanwhile, you cannot sleep here,
unless it is in the permanent-way with your ugly neck across a
rail."</p>
<p>The time-expired considered this.</p>
<p>"No, I go on a Quest," said he, and the station-master, with a
gesture of a spatulate thumb in the direction of the door,
indicated that the sooner the son of a camel commenced it the
better for all concerned.</p>
<p>He was an unsympathetic person--but then he was held
responsible when unconsidered trifles of Government property were
stolen from the station precincts. And it is well known that a
Legionary will steal the wall-paper from your wall while your
back is turned, cut it up small, and try to sell it back to you
as postage-stamps as soon as darkness sets in.</p>
<p><i>Ex-</i>No. 32867 got to his feet once more, marched
mechanically to barracks, was somewhat roughly handled by the
guard at the order of Sergeant Legros, and, having staunched the
bleeding from his nose, split lip, and cut cheek with the lining
of his <i>beret,</i> made his way to the Café de la Légion.
Entering, he bowed to Carmelita with a dignified flourish of his
pulpy <i>beret,</i> fell at full length on the floor, and went to
sleep.</p>
<p>"Queer, how differently drink takes different people," mused
Carmelita, as she again applied the cushion to supporting the
battered head--and yet she had hitherto known this Guillaume
Iyoné or Dhyoni (or William Jones!) of the IIIrd Company as a
soldier of the soberest and quietest. Quite like old Jean Boule
of the VIIth. Doubtless he had been "wetting his discharge
papers." Apparently he had done it to the point of drowning
them.</p>
<p>At <i>l'heure verte, l'heure de l'absinthe,</i> the café began
to fill, and for a time the sleeper was undisturbed by the <i>va
et vient</i> of Carmelita's customers. . . .</p>
<p>"'Ullo, Cocky!" remarked le Légionnaire 'Erbiggin ("'Erb"),
entering with his compatriots Rupert and John Bull, followed by
the Grasshopper and the Bucking Bronco. "Gorn to yer pore 'ed,
'as it? Come <i>hup</i>--an' 'ave s'more," and he sought to rouse
the sleeper.</p>
<p>"Strike me strange ef it 'ent thet <i>com</i>-patriot o'
yourn, John," said the Bucking Bronco. "Willie the Jones, o' the
IIIrd Company. . . . Guess he's got a hard cider jag. Didn't know
he ever fell off the water-cart any."</p>
<p>"William Jones" sat up.</p>
<p>"Really, I <i>beg</i> your pardon," he said. "I thought I . .
." and then peered through the heavy blanketing veil that was
daily thickening between him and his fellow-men.</p>
<p>"He's no more drunk than I am," said John Bull. . . . "I
suppose he's just discharged. I thought he was in hospital. . . .
Looks as though he ought to be, anyhow."</p>
<p>"I have rested, and I must begin my Quest," said "William
Jones," <i>Ex-</i>No. 32867. "I have a glorious Quest to
undertake, and I have little time. I . . ."</p>
<p>"Yus. <i>Ingk</i>quest's abaht your mark, Cocky," observed
'Erb. "Crowner's ingkquest."</p>
<p>"Help me up," added the sick man. "I must begin my Quest."</p>
<p>"<i>De sot homme, sot songe</i>," murmured La Cigale, shaking
his head mournfully. "I too have Quests, but they tangle and
jangle in my brain--and folk say I am mad or drunk. . . . Some
will say you are mad, <i>mon ami,</i> and some will say you are
drunk."</p>
<p>"Are you going to England?" asked John Bull, as he helped the
man to his feet.</p>
<p>"England? . . . England? . . . Oh, yes, I am going to England.
Where <i>should</i> I go? She lives in England," was the
reply.</p>
<p>"Have you friends?"</p>
<p>"She is my Friend. Of Friendship she is the Soul and the
Essence."</p>
<p>"<i>Chacun aime comme il est,"</i> remarked the Grasshopper.
"This is a gentleman," and added, "<i>Il n'y a guère de femme
assez habile pour connaître tout le mal qu'elle fait."</i></p>
<p>"I allow we oughter take him daown town to the railway deepôt
and see him on the cars," put in the Bucking Bronco. "Ef we don't
tote him thar an' tell him good-bye, it's the looney-house for
his. He'll set down in the bazaar and go as <i>maboul</i>
<sup>1</sup> as a <i>kief</i> <sup>2</sup> smoker." . . .</p>
<p> </p>
<p><sup>1</sup> Mad. <sup>2</sup> Hemp.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I was going to say we'd better see him off," agreed John
Bull. "If he gets to England, he'll have more chance than as a
discharged Legionary in Algiers--or France either. Wish we could
get an address from him. We could tie a label on him."</p>
<p>But they could not, and after the Bucking Bronco had procured
him food from Carmelita's "pie-foundry," as he termed her modest
<i>table d'hôte,</i> they took him to the station and, under the
cold eye of the Sergeant of the Guard at the platform gate, saw
him off. . . .</p>
<p>As one in a dream, as one seeing through a glass darkly and
beholding men as trees walking, <i>Ex-</i>No. 32867, William
Jones, <i>alias</i> Geoffry Brabazon-Howard, Esquire, made his
way to London. There is a providence that watches over children
and drunken men, and <i>Ex</i>-No. 32867 was as a compound of
both. He knew he was exceeding ill and quite abnormal in some
directions, such as never being <i>quite</i> certain as to
whether he was really doing and experiencing things, or was
dreaming; but what he did not realize was that, concurrently with
severe insomnia, he was liable at any moment to fall suddenly
asleep for a few minutes, wherever he might be, and whatever he
might be doing. He was aware that he had brief periods of
"abstraction," but was quite unaware that they were periods of
profound slumber. Unfortunately they only endured for a few
seconds or a few minutes, and, though serving to place him in
endless dangerous, ridiculous, and awkward situations, did not
amount to anything approaching a "living-wage" of sleep--rarely
to more than an hour in the twenty-four and generally to much
less.</p>
<p>At times he was, for a few hours perhaps, entirely normal, to
all appearances; and could talk, behave, and transact business in
such a way that no casual observer would be aware of anything
unusual in the man. He himself, however, when at his best, was
still aware of the isolating-medium in which he moved and lived
and had his being; the slowly thickening cloud, the imponderating
veil, that shut him in, and cut him off, with increasing
certainty and speed.</p>
<p>What would happen when he could no longer pierce and penetrate
this fog, or wall, of cloudy glass; this vast extinguisher of
sombre web, and could hold no communication with the outer
world?</p>
<p>Was he becoming an idiot before becoming a paralytic, and thus
having the gross presumption to reverse the order of things
foretold by Médecin-Major Parme?</p>
<p>On arrival at Charing Cross, he had strolled idly through the
streets of London, slept on a bench in Leicester Square; had
thought he was in the public gardens outside the Porte de Tlemçen
at Sidi-bel-Abbès, and hoped that the Legion's famous band would
come and play its sad music in that sad place; and, being "moved
on," had wandered away, dazed and bewildered, going on and on
until he reached Hammersmith. Here he found his way into one of
those Poor Man's Hotels, a Rowton House--vaguely under the
impression that it was some kind of barrack.</p>
<p>Here he had a glorious time of Rest, broken only by the
occasional misfortune of having a night's sleep, or rather a
nightmare in the unnameable Hell to keep out of which he exerted
all his failing faculties. And at the Hammersmith Rowton House he
became an object of the intensest interest to such of his
fellow-inhabitants of that abode of semi-starvation and hopeless
misery as were not too deeply engulfed in their own struggle with
despair and death to notice anything at all.</p>
<p>For "William Jones" began to blossom forth into a "toff," a
perfect dook, until it was the generally accepted theory that he
was a swell-mobsman just out of gaol, and now working the West
End in the correct garb of that locality.</p>
<p>Little by little the man had replaced his old clothes by new,
his <i>beret</i> by a correct hat, his scarf by the usual
neck-wear of an English gentleman, his <i>fourrier-sergent's</i>
suit of mufti by a Conduit Street creation, his rough boots by
the most modish of cloth-topped kid; and generally metamorphosed
William Jones, late of the Foreign Legion, into Geoffry
Brabazon-Howard, Esq., late of St. James's Street and the United
Service Club.</p>
<p>In one of his hours of mental clarity and vigour, he had
called at his bank and drawn the sum of ninety pounds, left at
current-account there when he disappeared into the Legion; and in
another such hour (and in his new clothes) had called at his
Club, seen the secretary, and arranged for the revival of his
lapsed membership.</p>
<p>It had taken both the bank-manager and the secretary some time
to recognize him, but they had done so eventually, and had been
shocked to think of what the man must have been through to have
changed as he had, and to look as he did.</p>
<p>He <i>had</i> been through a good deal. In addition to the
very real hardships of campaigning in the Sahara as a private of
the Legion, he had had black-water fever and dysentery, had been
wounded in the abdomen by an Arab lance, carried away by the
Arabs while unconscious from loss of blood from this wound, and
kept until he should recover consciousness and be eligible for
torture. (It is pointless to torture a practically dead person.)
The badness of his wound had saved his life, for by the time he
had sufficiently recovered to be interesting to his captors, they
were attacked and routed, and "William Jones" had been restored
to the bosom of his company only slightly tortured after all. The
shock to an enfeebled man, who was also suffering from a hideous
wound, had been considerable, however.</p>
<p>Thereafter, enteric had done little to improve his health, and
his resultant slowness and stupidity had earned him the special
attention of Sergeant-Major Suicide-Maker and Sergeant
Legros.</p>
<p>So there is little wonder that his banker and club-secretary
were shocked at the change in him, and wondered how many days or
weeks he had to live.</p>
<p>And to the secretary, who saw him almost daily, it was clear
that the poor chap was sometimes queer in the head too--and no
wonder, looking as awfully ill as he did.</p>
<p>For example, one day he would walk into the Club, sit down on
the Hall-Porter's stool, and go to sleep immediately!</p>
<p>Another day he would do the same thing on the stairs, or even
the front steps.</p>
<p>If he sat down in a smoking-room arm-chair and fell asleep, as
is a member's just and proper right, he would spring up if anyone
approached, say, "I really <i>beg</i> your pardon. I am afraid I
. . ." and walk straight out of the Club.</p>
<p>What would the worthy secretary have thought had he known that
Geoffry Brabazon-Howard, Esquire (once of the Black Lancers),
walked daily to the Club from the Hammersmith Rowton House in the
morning and back to that same retreat in the evening; and that
such food as he ate, was eaten in his cubicle there, or at a
coffee-stall? At a Rowton House one has the "use of the fire" in
the basement for one's cooking purposes, but Geoffry was a most
indifferent cook, and it is difficult to purchase really cookable
provisions on a sum of fourpence a day. For this was the amount
that he had decided upon as the irreducible minimum to be
expended on food if he were to keep up the strength required for
the daily journey to the West End and back. After paying for his
clothes and setting aside his club fees, he would have enough to
live on at this rate, until the London season and through it, if
he were very, very careful. He would have to renew some of his
clothing, perhaps, later on--boots, linen, ties--and there were
always incidental and unavoidable expenses. However, with great
care and a little luck, he could last to the end of the season
and pursue his Quest. And this great absorbing Quest, which had
made him expend his all in fine clothing, club membership, and
the appearance of being a "person of quality" and a gentleman of
means and leisure?</p>
<p>Merely to come face to face with, to meet on terms of
equality, to have just one encounter and conversation with--a
woman.</p>
<p>Before he died he must see, and speak to, Peggy once again--to
Lady Margaret Hillier--because of whom he had vanished into the
French Foreign Legion, and of whom he had thought daily and
nightly ever since.</p>
<p>He had had a thin time, he was near the end of his tether,
life held nothing for him, and he had no desire to prolong
it--but before he lay down for the last time he <i>would</i> see
Peggy again, hear her voice, feast his eyes on her beautiful
face, and his ears on the sound of her words and laughter, yea,
feast his very soul upon the banquet that it had dreamed of--and
then he would have no further use for clubs, fine clothes, a
penny chair in the Park, nor anything else.</p>
<p>The ass was quite mad, you perceive. . . .</p>
<p>Now one <i>can</i> live on fourpence a day, and for a very
long time too. If one starts in robust health and strength, one
can maintain an appearance of health and the power to work for a
quite surprising period. But if one is really very ill, on the
verge of a nervous collapse, and badly in need of a rest-cure
with special diet, tonic, and drugs--fourpence a day is not
enough.</p>
<p>They give you a surprisingly filling meal at certain
coffee-shops and cocoa-houses (like Pearce-and-Plenty or
Lockhart's) for fourpence, but one meatless meal per diem is not
enough. It is, on the whole, better to have two pennyworth at
dawn and two pennyworth at sunset, and a good drink of water at
midday. Better still is it, if you are really experienced in the
laying-out of money, to have a pennyworth at dawn, two pennyworth
at midday and a pennyworth at sunset. (You can go to bed with a
full stomach by supping on a quart of water.)</p>
<p>But Geoffry had not complete liberty in the matter. One cannot
go for a twopenny midday meal in a silk hat, faultless morning
coat buttoned over the white waistcoat of a blameless laundress,
and in patent cloth-topped boots. Geoffry was, by force of
circumstances, debarred this thrice-a-day system of feeding, and
was constrained to breakfast (in rags) at an early coffee-stall
and to dine at the same, in the same decrepit clothing, late at
night. After breakfast he would return to his cubicle, dress for
the Club, and creep forth, still in the early hours of the
morning. (One attracts attention if, in the broad light of naked
day, one issues from a Rowton House in the correct garb of Pall
Mall and Piccadilly.) At night he would undress, carefully fold
his immaculate clothes, don his rags, and sally forth to dine on
twopence. The coffee-stall keeper regarded him as a broken-down
torf and eke a balmy, but coffee-stall keepers are a race blasé
of freaks, social, moral, and mental.</p>
<p>Between these meals Geoffry Brabazon-Howard pursued his Quest.
He went to his Club and listened eagerly for "society" gossip,
and read "society" papers (of the kind that inform the public
when Lady Diana Blathers dines at the Fritz, and photographs her
inhaling the breath of an abortive animal, apparently a
bye-product of the dog-industry; announces the glad tidings that
Mrs. Bobbie Snobbie has returned to Town; or that the Earl of
Spunge was seen scratching his head in Bond Street yesterday).
Having sought in vain for news of Lady Margaret Hillier, he
slowly paraded the fashionable shopping thoroughfares, and then,
utterly weary, turned into the Park, selected an eligible site
for seeing the pedestrians, carriage-exercisers, and riders, and
sat for hours watching and waiting, hoping against hope--as he
thought. In point of fact he spent a great portion of this time
in dropping asleep and being awakened by nearly falling off the
chair. He was sometimes tempted to expend this chair-penny in
food, but restrained the base cravings of his lower nature. He
pictured himself arrayed in the correctest of dress, nonchalantly
seated on a Park chair, gaily observing the gyrations of the
giddy throng of fashionable human ephemeræ--suddenly seeing
Peggy, and rising, accosting her with graceful badinage, airy
flippancy, and casual interest. Peggy would laugh and talk
amusingly and lightly, he would beg her to come and lunch with
him at the Club, or take tea if such were the hour; he would
feast his eyes and ears and soul as he had promised himself--and
<i>then?</i>--then he would lay down his arms and cease to fight
this relentless Foe--sickness, disease, and death--that besieged
him day and night, and sought to prevent his walk to the Club,
sought to thwart the pursuit of his Quest. Having seen Peggy
again, heard her laugh and speak, looked into her hopelessly
perfect and wonderful eyes, he would surrender the fortress he no
longer wished to hold, and would permit the Enemy to
enter--trusting that <i>le bon Dieu, Le Bon Général,</i> would
see to it that, for a broken old soldier, death was annihilation,
peace, and rest. . . .</p>
<p>Daily he grew thinner, as a sick man living on fourpence a day
must, and frequently he would finger the sovereign that always
lay in his waistcoat pocket--ready for the day when Peggy should
lunch at the Club with him. It is not wholly easy to keep a
sovereign intact while you slowly starve and every fibre of your
being craves for tobacco, for brandy, for food--as you smell
choice Havanas in the Club smoking-room, see fat, healthy men
drinking their whiskies and brandies, and when you are violently
smitten by rich savours of food as you pass the door of the
dining-room.</p>
<p>The fragrance of coffee and eggs-and-bacon! The glimpse of
noble barons of beef on the sideboard! The sight of tea-and-toast
at four in the afternoon when you have had nothing since four in
the morning! But the sovereign remained intact. With that he and
Peggy could have an excellent lunch--without wine--and Peggy
never touched wine. . . .</p>
<p>He started to his feet.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>"I really <i>beg</i> your pardon! I am afraid I . . ." A
stranger had awakened him as he slept in a smoking-room
arm-chair. . . . He did not recollect how he came to do such a
thing when he should have been in the Park. . . . <i>What</i> was
the man saying--"Ill?"</p>
<p>"I was afraid you were ill. To tell the truth, I jolly well
thought you were dead for the moment. Let me drive you to my
doctor's. Splendid chap. Just going that way. . . . No--don't run
away."</p>
<p>"Most awfully kind," replied Geoffry, peering through the
veil, "but I'm <i>quite</i> all right. Just a bit tired, you
know. I am going to have a real Rest soon. . . . At present I
have a Quest."</p>
<p>The poor devil looked absolutely <i>starved,</i> thought
Colonel Doddington. Positively ghastly.</p>
<p>"Come and have some lunch with me," he said, "and let me tell
you about this doctor of mine, anyhow."</p>
<p>Geoffry flushed--though it was remarkable that there was
sufficient blood in so meagre a body and feeble a heart for the
purpose.</p>
<p><i>Lunch!</i> A four-course lunch in a beautiful room--silver,
crystal, fine napery, good service--perhaps wine, certainly
alcohol of some sort, and real coffee. . . .</p>
<p>It was a cruel temptation. But he put it from him. After all,
one was a gentleman, and a gentleman does not accept hospitality
which he cannot return, from a stranger.</p>
<p>"Awfully sorry--but I <i>must</i> go," he replied. "I'm
feeding out." He was--late that night, on twopence.</p>
<p>He fled, and outside mopped his brow. It <i>had</i> been a
terrible temptation and ordeal. For two pins he would go back and
have a brandy-and-soda at the cost of two days' food. No, he
dared not risk collapse--and two days' complete starvation would
probably mean collapse. Collapse meant expense too, and money was
time to him. The expenditure of more than fourpence a day would
shorten the time of his Quest. A day lost, was a chance lost. She
might pass through London at that very time, if he lay ill in the
Hammersmith Rowton House.</p>
<p>That night he had to take a 'bus home or lie down in the
street. Next day, dressing took so long and his walk to the Club
was so painful and slow, that he had to omit the Bond Street,
Regent Street, and Piccadilly walk, and go straight to the
Park.</p>
<p>There he had shocking luck. A zealous but clumsy policeman
rendered him First Aid to the Fainting with such violence that he
spoilt the collar and shirt-front that should have lasted another
two days. Why could not the worthy fool have left him to come out
of his faint alone? He went <i>into</i> it alone, all right. And
there was an accursed, gaping crowd. Nor could he give the
policeman two pennies, and so gave him nothing--which was very
distressing. A most unlucky day!</p>
<p>Well--the days of his Quest were numbered, and the number was
lessened.</p>
<p>Next day he found the Enemy very powerful and the tottering
fortress closely beset. He would be hard put to it to walk to the
Club--but come!--an old Legionary who had done his fifty
kilometres a day under a hundredweight kit, over loose sand, with
the thermometer at 120<sup>0</sup> in the shade; and who had
lived on a handful of rice-flour and a mouthful of selenitic
water in the Sahara--surely <i>he</i> was not going to shirk a
stroll from Hammersmith Broadway to Pall Mall and round the Town
to the Park?</p>
<p>He had got as far as Devonshire House, when a lady, who was
driving from the Berkeley Hotel, where she had been lunching, to
the Coburg Hotel, where she was to have tea with friends who were
taking her on to Ranelagh, suddenly saw him and thought she saw a
ghost. As her carriage crawled through the crush into Berkeley
Street it brought her within a yard of him.</p>
<p>She turned very pale and lay back on the cushions. Immediately
she sat upright again, and then leaned towards him. It
<i>could</i> not be! Not this poor wreck, this shattered
ruin--her splendid <i>Geoff</i>--the Geoff who had seemed to love
her, five years ago, and had suddenly dropped her, and so been
the cause of her marrying in haste and repenting in even greater
haste, to the day of her widowhood.</p>
<p><i>"Geoff!"</i> she said.</p>
<p>He raised his hat with a trembling hand and his face was
transfigured. . . . Was he dying on his feet, wondered the
woman.</p>
<p>"Get in, Geoff," she said, and the footman half-turned and
then jumped down.</p>
<p>Geoffry Brabazon-Howard, with a great and almost final effort,
stepped into the victoria.</p>
<p>"Will you come to lunch with me at . . ." he began, and then
burst into tears.</p>
<p>Later, it was the woman who wept, tears of joy and
thankfulness, after the agonizing suspense when the great
specialist staked his reputation on his plain verdict that the
man was not organically diseased. He was in a parlous state, no
doubt, practically dying of starvation and nervous
exhaustion--but nursing could save him.</p>
<p>Nursing did--the nursing of Lady Peggy Brabazon-Howard. . .

<h1><a name="c110" id="c110"><i>Moonshine</i></a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>La Cigale, the Mad "Grasshopper" of the VIIth Company, was
solemnly dancing by the light of the moon. He was a fine soldier
and a hopeless lunatic, and had once been a Belgian Officer
(Corps of Guides, the most aristocratic in the Belgian Army) and
military attaché at various Embassies. No one knew his story, not
even le Légionnaire Jean Boule, whom he loved and who, through
great suffering, had attained great understanding and
sympathy.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p> </p>
<p><sup>1</sup> <i>Vide</i> "The Wages of Virtue." John
Murray.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This same gentleman, accompanied by the Bucking Bronco,
Reginald Rupert, and 'Erb, was even now looking for him, knowing
that he was always worse at the period of full moon and apt to do
strange things.</p>
<p>They found him--solemnly dancing by the light of the moon--on
a patch of green turf by the palms of the oasis.</p>
<p>"Doin' a bloomin' fandango on the light fantastic toe--all on
'is little own!" observed 'Erb.</p>
<p>"Funny how the moon affects madmen," said Rupert.</p>
<p>"Yes," agreed John Bull. "Ancient idea too. <i>Luna</i> the
moon, <i>lunatic.</i> Evidently some connection."</p>
<p>"Shall we butt in an' put the kibosh on it?" asked the Bucking
Bronco.</p>
<p>"No," replied John Bull. "Let's settle down and have a smoke.
We'll see him to bed when he's tired of dancing. If he wearies
himself out there'll be more chance of some sleep for us. . . .
We can't leave him to himself to-night."</p>
<p>"Nope," agreed the Bucking Bronco. "Remember the night he went
<i>loco</i> once and for all? When the grasshopper jumped into
his <i>soupe."</i></p>
<p>"Yes; but it wasn't the locust in his <i>gamelle</i> that was
really the last straw. He'd have had permanent <i>cafard</i> from
that day, anyhow. . . . Look!--he's stopped." . . .</p>
<p>The Grasshopper, hearing voices, had ceased his posturing,
bowing, and dancing. Crouching low, he progressed toward the
shadow of the palms by long leaps.</p>
<p>"Hullo, <i>mon ami!</i>" cried John Bull; "come and have a
smoke."</p>
<p>"<i>She</i> always danced like that to the Chaste Huntress of
the skies when she showed mortals her full face," said La Cigale,
as he flung himself down by his friend.</p>
<p>"'Oo did?" queried 'Erb.</p>
<p>"Diane de Valheureux," was the reply. "That is why Delacroix
killed her. That Delacroix of the artillery."</p>
<p>"I could onnerstand 'im killin' 'er if she <i>sung,</i> but I
don' see wot 'e wanted to kill her for fer dancin'," observed
'Erb. "Too bloomin' pertickler, <i>I</i> calls it."</p>
<p>"He was jealous," replied La Cigale, as he pressed his thin
hands over his forehead and smouldering eyes.</p>
<p>"Diane was born at the full of the moon out in the beautiful
garden of her father's château. It was her mother's whim--a woman
of fire and moonbeams and wild fancies and poesies herself: Pan's
own daughter.</p>
<p>"And from the day she could walk, Diane must go out and dance
in the light of the full moon.</p>
<p>"I loved Diane. Also did Delacroix. He was mad for love of
her. I was sane for love of her, since my love showed me all
Beauty and Harmony and the utter worthlessness of the baubles
that men strive for.</p>
<p>"She loved me--I think. If she did not, certainly she loved no
one else. I understood, you see. And, on one evening, given by
God, she let me dance with her in the forest while Diana smiled
full-face from Heaven.</p>
<p>"And her parents gave her to Delacroix, who had great
possessions and a soul that values great possessions at their
untrue value. The soul of a pedlar--the base suspicious mind of a
ferret.</p>
<p>"After she was married--and broken-hearted--she still had one
joy. She could still dance with the fairies in a glade of the
forest at full moon. She <i>could,</i> do I say? She could not do
otherwise when Diana and Pan and the Old Gods called--this
night-born elf of night, moonlight, and the open sky and earth.
And, returning from her midnight dance with the fairies, by the
light of the Harvest Moon, she found that the husband whom she
had left snoring, sat glowering--awaiting her--his mind a
seething cesspool of foul suspicions.</p>
<p>"He killed her--of course. Such things as Fairy Dianes
<i>are</i> killed by such other things as Hog Delacroix. And my
heart broke. As your fine poet says, I think:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>'There came a mist and a blinding rain,<br>
And life was never the same again.'</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Never. Nor had I the satisfaction of dealing with Delacroix.
The brave soul fled and disappeared."</p>
<p>"You'll cop 'im yet, Ciggy," interrupted 'Erb. "Cheer up, Ole
Cock. We'll all lay fer 'im, an' do 'im in proper, one o' these
dark nights."</p>
<p>"I have settled accounts with him, now, I thank you,"
continued La Cigale. "I suddenly came face to face with him on
board the troopship <i>L'Orient</i> at Oran. It was when the
Legion sent drafts to Tonkin, to fight the Black Flags.</p>
<p>"I was on sentry, and looking up, as a man came along the
gangway, beheld the evil face of Delacroix!</p>
<p>"By the time I had recovered my wits, and realized that it was
he in the flesh, and not his ghost, he had passed on and was
swallowed up by the part of the ship devoted to officers.</p>
<p>"I saw no more of him until it was again my turn for sentry
duty. By this time we were at Port Said, and as desertion was
easy here--since a man had but to dive overboard and swim a few
yards or even rush down a gangway when we were coaling--all
sentries were given ball-cartridge and strict orders to shoot any
soldier attempting to leap overboard or make a burst for the
coal-wharf and British soil. (Once ashore, he must not be
touched, or there would be trouble with England--and he might,
with impunity, stand on the quay and deride us.)</p>
<p>"It was not likely that any of the French regulars would
desert--artillery, line, or <i>marsouins</i>--but there would
have been but few of the Legion who would not have made the
promenade ashore but for these precautions.</p>
<p>"And as I stood there--my loaded Lebel in my hands--who should
approach the head of the gangway over which I stood sentry, but
this Delacroix, this thing whose foul hands--the very hands there
before my eyes--had choked the life out of my Diane!</p>
<p>"Should I blow out his vile brains, or should I give myself
the joy unspeakable of plunging my bayonet into his carcase?</p>
<p>"Neither. Too brief a joy for me--too brief an agony for
him.</p>
<p>"As he passed, I held my hand with an effort that made me
pale.</p>
<p>"The third time I saw him was in the Indian Ocean as we headed
south for our next stopping-place, Singapore.</p>
<p>"He was leaning on the rail of the officers' promenade-deck,
smoking a cigar after his comfortable lunch. The deck was empty.
I ran lightly up the companion from our troop-deck, polluted the
promenade-deck with my presence, sprang at him, seized him from
behind, flung him overboard, and sprang after him with a cry of
'<i>Diane</i>'!</p>
<p>"I must watch him drown; I must shout that name in his ear as
he died. I must be with him at the last, and my hands must be at
the throat of the foul dog. Not mine to fling him overboard and
be clapped in irons while they threw him life-belts, and then
lowered boats!</p>
<p>"Swimming with powerful strokes to where he had struck the
water, I waited till he came up, and then seized him by the
throat and strove to choke the life out of him as he had done to
Diane. He struck at me wildly, and I thrust his head again
beneath the water. But, yes! with a shout of 'Diane!' I dragged
him below and swam downward as deeply as I could go. With
bursting lungs I swam upward again and gloated upon his purpling
face, and then--down, down, down, down, once more. . . .</p>
<p>"When they dragged me into the boat, I was senseless and he
was dead. I had swum with him for nearly an hour.</p>
<p>"When I recovered on board the ship, I was the hero of the
hour--the man who had sprung into the sea, without stopping to
divest himself of so much as his boots, to save an Officer. . .
.</p>
<p>"What am I saying? . . . I am sleepy. . . . Bon soir, mes
amis," and the Grasshopper rose and retired toward the tents.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"<i>Some</i> story!" remarked the Bucking Bronco, as the four
followed. "Wouldn't thet jar you! Sure it's the mos' interestin'
an' wonderfullest yarn I heerd him tell yet. Ain't it, John?"</p>
<p>"M--m . . . yes. . . . It is the more interesting and
wonderful," was the reply of John Bull, as he thoughtfully
flicked the ash from the end of his cigarette, "by reason of the
fact that I happen to know--that the Grasshopper cannot swim a
stroke."</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c111" id="c111"><i>The Coward of the
Legion</i></a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>Jean Jacques Dubonnet had distinguished himself that day, and
he lay on his bed that night and cried. His companion, old Jean
Boule, in that little hut of sticks and banana-leaves, had just
been congratulating him on the fact that he had almost certainly
won himself the <i>croix de guerre</i> or the <i>médaille
militaire</i> for his distinguished bravery. And he had burst
into tears, his body shaken with great rending sobs.</p>
<p>John Bull was not only a gentleman; he was a person of
understanding and sympathy, and he had suffered enough, and seen
enough of suffering, to feel neither surprise, disgust, nor
contempt.</p>
<p>"God! Oh, God! I am a coward. I am a branded coward!"
blubbered the big man on the creaking bed of boughs and
boxes.</p>
<p>Was this fever, reaction, drink, <i>le cafard,</i> or
what?</p>
<p>Certainly Dubonnet had played the man, and shown great
physical courage that day against the Sakalaves, the brave
Malagasy savages who have given Madame la République a good deal
of trouble and annoyance, and filled many a shallow grave with
the unconsidered carcases of <i>Marsouins</i> <sup>1</sup> and
Légionnaires in the red soil of Madagascar. As the decimated
Company had slowly fallen back from the ambush in the dense
plantations of the lovely Boueni palms, Lieutenant Roberte had
fallen, shot through the body by a plucky Sakalave who had
deliberately rested his prehistoric musket on his thigh and
discharged it at a dozen yards range, himself under heavy fire.
With insulting howls of "<i>Taim-poory, taim-poory</i>," half a
dozen of the enemy had sprung at the fallen man, when Dubonnet,
rushing from cover, had shot two in quick succession, bayoneted
two others, kicked violently in the face a fifth, who stooped
over the Lieutenant with a <i>coupe-coupe,</i> and then, swinging
his Lebel by the butt, had put up so good a fight that he had
driven the savages back and had then partly dragged and partly
carried his officer with him, to where the Company could rally,
re-form, and make their stand to await reinforcements. Undeniably
Dubonnet had risked his life to save that of his officer, and had
fought with very great courage and determination or he could
never have reached the rallying-place with an unconscious man,
when so many of his comrades could not reach it at all.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><sup>1</sup> Colonial Infantry (Infanterie de la Marine).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yet there he lay, weeping like a child, and calling upon his
Maker to ease his guilty bosom of the burden it had borne so
long--the knowledge that he was a "branded" coward.</p>
<p>It was terribly, cruelly hot in the tiny hut, and, to John
Bull, who arose from his camp-bed of packing-case boards, it
seemed even hotter outside, as he went to fetch the hollow bamboo
water-"bottle" which hung from the tree under which the hut was
built. Was it possible that the Madagascan moon gave out
heat-rays of its own, or reflected those of the sun as it did the
rays of light? It really seemed hotter in the moonlight than out
of it. . . . Carrying the bamboo water-receptacle, a cylinder as
tall as himself--really a pipe with one end sealed with gum, wax,
or clay, when a joint of the stem does not serve the purpose--the
Englishman passed in through the doorless doorway and delivered
an ultimatum.</p>
<p>"Whatever may be the trouble, <i>mon ami,</i> weeping will not
help it. Enough! . . . Sit up and tell me all about it, or I'll
wash you off that bed like the insect you're pretending to be. .
. . Now then--a drink or a drenching?"</p>
<p>"Give me a drink for the love of God!" said Dubonnet, sitting
up. "Absinthe, rum, cognac--anything," and he clutched at the
breast of his canvas shirt as though he feared it might open and
expose his breast.</p>
<p>"Yes. Good cold water," replied John Bull.</p>
<p>"Cold water!" mocked the other between sobs. "Cold Englishman!
<i>Cold water!</i>" and he bowed his head on his knees and
groaned and wept afresh.</p>
<p>The old soldier carefully poured water from the open end of
the great pipe into a <i>gamelle</i> and offered it to the other,
who drank feverishly. "Are you wounded in the chest, there?" he
asked.</p>
<p>This <i>cafard,</i> the madness that comes upon soldiers who
eat out their hearts in the monotony of exile and wear out their
stomachs and brains in the absinthe-shop, takes strange forms and
reduces its victims to queer plights. How should le Légionnaire
Jean Jacques Dubonnet, <i>Soldat première classe,</i> recommended
for decoration for bravery in the field, be a coward?</p>
<p>"Oh, merciful God--help me to bear it. I am a Coward--a
branded Coward!" wailed the huddled figure on the rickety,
groaning bed.</p>
<p>"See here, comrade," said John Bull, overcoming a certain
slight, but perceptible, repugnance, and placing an arm across
the bowed and quivering shoulders, "I am no talker, as you are
aware. If it would give you any relief to tell me all about
it--rest assured that no word of it will ever be repeated by me.
It may ease you. I may be able to help or comfort. Many
Légionnaires, some on their death-beds, have felt the better for
telling me of their troubles. . . . But do not think I want to
pry." . . .</p>
<p>Swiftly the wretched man turned, flung his arms about the
Englishman's neck, and kissed him.</p>
<p>John Bull forbore to shudder. (Heavens! How different is the
excellent French <i>poilu</i> from the British Tommy!) But if he
could bring peace and the healing, soothing sense of confession,
if not of anything approaching absolution, to this tortured soul,
the night would have been well spent--better spent than in sleep,
though he was very, very tired.</p>
<p>"I <i>will</i> tell you, <i>mon ami,</i> and will pray to you
then to give me comfort or a bullet in the temple. A little
accident as you clean your rifle! <i>I</i> cannot do it. I
<i>dare</i> not do it--and no bullet will touch me in battle--as
you have seen to-day. I live to die, and am too big a coward to
take my life. . . . I am a branded coward. . . . See! See!" and
he tore open the breast of his shirt. At once he closed it again,
and hugged himself.</p>
<p>"No, no! I will tell you first," he cried.</p>
<p>The madness of <i>le cafard,</i> no doubt. The man had only
recently been drafted to the VIIth Company from the depôt, and
had appeared a morose, surly, and unattractive person, friendless
and undesirous of friends. Accident had made him the
stable-companion of the Englishman in this little damp
fever-stricken hell in the reeking corner of the Betsimisarake
district, in which the remains of the Company were pinned. . .
.</p>
<p>The deplorable and deploring Dubonnet thrust his grimy fists
into his eyes and across the end of his amorphous nose, as, with
a sniff which militated against the romantic effect of the
declaration, he said, "I swear I loved her. I loved her madly. It
was my unfortunate and uncontrollable love that caused the
trouble in the first place. . . . But it was her fault too, mind
you! Why couldn't she have <i>told</i> me she had a husband, away
at Lyons, finishing his military service--a husband whom she had
not seen for six months, and whom she would not see for another
six? . . . Too late the fool confessed it--a month before he was
coming, and a couple of months before something else was coming!
And he famous, as I learned too late, for having all the jealous
hate of Hell in his heart, if she so much as looked at another
man. He, a porter of the Halles, notorious for his
quarrelsomeness and for his fearful strength and savage temper.
She hated him nearly as much as she feared him--and me, me she
loved to distraction. And I her. . . . Believe me, she was the
loveliest flower-seller in Paris--with a foot and ankle, an eye,
a figure, ravishing, I tell you . . . and he would break her neck
when he saw how she was and stab me to the heart. <i>She</i>
would never have told him it was I she loved, but those others
would--for dozens knew that she was my <i>amie,</i> and many in
my gang did not love me. I am not of those whom men love--but
women, ah!--and there were jealous ones in our <i>ruelle</i> who
would have gone far to see her beauty spoiled and my throat cut.
. . . It was all her fault, I say! Did she not deceive me in
hiding the fact that she had a husband? She deceived us all. But
when this <i>scélérat</i> should turn up from Lyons, and find her
at her pitch or in the flower-market, would any of them have held
their tongues? . . . Can you not see it? . . . The crowd at the
door, the screams as he entered and dragged her out into the
gutter by the hair, his foot on her throat . . . and,
afterwards--his knife at my breast. . . . Would any of the gang
have stood by me? No, they would have licked their chops and
goaded him on . . . and, oh God, I am a <i>coward. . . .</i> I
can fight when my blood is up and I have to struggle for my life.
. . . I can fight as one of a regiment, a company, a crowd, all
fighting side by side, each defending the other by fighting the
common foe. . . . I can take my part in a mêlée and I can do
deeds then that I do not know I have done till afterwards. . . .
I can fight when the tiger in me is aroused and has smelt
blood--but I am a <i>coward</i> if I am alone. I, alone, dare not
fight one man alone. . . . Were I being tracked alone through the
jungle here by but one of the six men I attacked to-day, my knees
would knock together and my legs would refuse to bear me up. I
should flee if they would carry me, flee shrieking, but they
would not bear me a hundred metres. They would collapse, and I
should lie shuddering with closed eyes, awaiting the blow. I can
hunt--with the pack--but I cannot be hunted. No. When our band
waylaid the greasy bourgeois as he lurched homeward from his
restaurant in the Place Pigalle or his Montmartre cabaret, I was
as good an <i>apache</i> as any in the gang, and struck my blow
with the best; but if it was a case of a row with the <i>agents
de police,</i> and we were being individually shadowed, my heart
turned to water, and I lay in bed for days. In a fair fight
between about equal numbers of anarchists and <i>apaches</i> on
the one hand, and <i>messieurs les agents</i> on the other, if it
came upon us suddenly as they raided our rookery, I could play a
brave man's part in the rush for the street; but I cannot be the
hunted one--I cannot fight alone with none on either side of me.
Oh God, I am a coward," and the wretch again buried his face in
his knees and wept and sobbed afresh.</p>
<p>A common, cowardly gutter-hooligan apparently; an
<i>apache,</i> a Paris street-wolf, and, like all wolves, braver
in the pack than when alone; but in John Bull's gaze there was
more of pity than anything. Suppose he, John Bull, had been born
in a foul corner of some filthy cellar beneath a Paris slum?
Would he have been so different? Was the <i>man</i> to blame, or
the Fate that gave him the ancestry and environment that had made
him precisely what he was?</p>
<p>"You will be called out before the battalion and decorated
with the cross or the <i>médaille, mon ami,</i> for your heroism
to-day. Put the past behind, and let your life re-date from the
day the Colonel pins the decoration on your breast. Begin afresh.
You will carry about with you always the visible sign and
recognition that you are a hero--there on your breast, I say." .
. .</p>
<p>With a shriek of "<i>What do I bear on my breast now?</i>" the
ex-<i>apache</i> tore open his shirt and exposed two strips of
strong linen sticking-plaster, each some ten inches long and two
inches wide, that lay stuck horizontally across his broad
chest.</p>
<p>What was this? Had he two ghastly gashes beneath the plaster?
Had all that he had been saying been merely the delirium of a
badly-wounded man? Seizing their ends, the <i>apache</i> tore
them violently from his skin, and, by the light of the little
lamp, John Bull saw, deeply branded, and most skilfully tattooed
in the ineradicable burns, the following words (in French):</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">J. J. DUBONNET</p>
<p align="center">LIAR AND COWARD</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Englishman recoiled in horror, and the other thought it
was in contempt.</p>
<p>"Where are your fine phrases <i>now?</i>" he snarled, with
concentrated bitterness. "'<i>You will carry about with you
always the visible sign and recognition that you are a
hero,</i>'" he mocked. "I do indeed! . . . Oh God, take it from
me. Let me sleep and wake to find it gone, and I will become a
monk and wear out my life in prayer," . . . and he threw himself
face-downward on the bed and tore the covering of his straw
pillow with his teeth.</p>
<p>"See, <i>mon ami,</i>" said John Bull, "the <i>médaille</i>
will be above that. It will be superimposed. It will bury that
beneath it. Let it bury it for ever. That is of the past--the
<i>médaille</i> is of to-day and the glorious future. That is
man's revenge--the cruel punishment and vengeance of an injured
brute. The <i>médaille</i> is man's reward--the glad recognition
of those who admire courage." . . .</p>
<p>"It is not the husband's work," growled Dubonnet. "He never
caught me. My own gang did that--my comrades--my <i>friends!</i>
Think of their loathing and contempt, their hatred and disgust,
that they could do that to a man and leave him to live. Think of
it! . . . And I dare not kill myself and meet <i>her.</i> I am a
coward. I fear Death himself, and I fear her reproachful eyes
still more. . . . I <i>am</i> a coward and I <i>am</i> a liar. I
broke my faith and word and trust to her--and I feared the death
that she welcomed because <i>I</i> was by her side to share it.
She drank the poison in her glass, threw herself into my arms,
and bade me drink mine and come with her to the Beyond, where no
brutal, hated husband could drag her from me to his own loathed
arms. . . . And I did not. I could not. She died in my arms with
those great reproachful eyes on mine, and whispered, 'Come with
me, my Beloved. I am afraid to go alone.' And when I would not,
she cursed me and died. And I let her go alone--I, who had
planned our double suicide, our glorious and romantic suicide in
each other's arms--that we might not have to part, might not have
to face her husband's wrath, might be together for all time,
though it were in hell. . . . Before she drank, she blessed me.
Before she died, she cursed me--and still I could not drink. . .
. And now I have not the courage to go on living, and I have not
the courage to take my life. . . . And they are going to brand me
as a hero, are they? . . . <i>That</i> on my coat and <i>this</i>
beneath it!" and peals of hysterical laughter rang out on the
still night.</p>
<p>"Yes--<i>that</i> on your coat," said the Englishman. "Does it
count for nothing? Let the one balance the other. Put the past
behind you and start afresh. . . . Can you bear pain? Physical
pain, I mean?"</p>
<p>"Is not all my life a pain?--did I not have to bear the pain
of being branded with a red-hot iron? What is physical pain
compared with what I bear night and day--remorse, self-loathing,
the fear of the discovery of <i>this</i> by my comrades? How much
longer will it be before some prying swine sees these strips and
refuses to believe they hide wounds--laughs at my tale of
attempted suicide in a fit of
<i>cafard--hara-kiri</i>--self-mutilation with a knife." . .
.</p>
<p>"Because, if you can face the pain, we can obliterate that. We
can remove the record of shame, and you can wear the record of
courage and duty without fear of discovery of the . . ."</p>
<p>"<i>What</i> do you say?" cried Dubonnet, as the words
penetrated his anguished and self-centred mind. "<i>What?</i>
Remove it? <i>How</i>--in the name of God?"</p>
<p>"Burn it out as it was burnt in," was the cool reply. "I will
do it for you if you ask me to. . . . The pain will be ghastly
and the mark hideous--but it will <i>be</i> a mark and nothing
else. Anyone seeing it will merely see that you have been
severely burnt--and they'll be about right."</p>
<p>Dubonnet sat up.</p>
<p>"You could and would do that?" he said.</p>
<p>"Yes. I should make a flat piece of iron red-hot and lay it
firmly across the writing. It would depend on you whether it were
successful or not, and would be a good test of nerve and courage.
Have it done--and make up your mind that cowardice and treachery
were burnt out with the words. Then start life afresh and win
another decoration." . . .</p>
<p>"There are anæsthetics," whimpered Dubonnet. "Chloroform." . .
.</p>
<p>"Not for Legionaries in Madagascar," was the reply. "Unless
you'd like to go to Médecin-Major Parme with your story and ask
him to operate, to oblige a young friend?"</p>
<p>Dubonnet shivered, and then spat. "<i>Médecin-Major
Parme!</i>" he growled.</p>
<p>"If you like to wait a few weeks or months or years, you may
have the opportunity and the money to buy chloroform," continued
the Englishman, "or the means for making local injections of
cocaine or something; but I suggest you make a kind of sacrament
of the business--have the damnable thing burnt out precisely as
it was burnt in, and as you clench your teeth on the bullet in
manly silence and soldierly stoicism, realize it is <i>the
past</i> that is being burnt also, and that the good fire is
burning out all that makes you hate yourself and hate life. Let
it be symbolic."</p>
<p>John Bull knew his man. He had met his type before. Too much
imagination; too little ballast; the material for a first-class
devil, or a first-class man; swayed and governed by his symbols,
shibboleths, and prejudices; the slave and victim of an <i>idée
fixe. . . .</i> If he could get him to undergo this ordeal, he
would emerge from it a new man--a saved man. An anæsthetic would
spoil the whole moral effect. If he would face the torture and
bear it, he would regard himself as a brave man, just as surely
as he now regarded himself as a coward. He would recover his
self-respect, and he would <i>be</i> brave because he believed
himself to be brave. It would literally be his regeneration and
salvation.</p>
<p>"It would hurt no more in the undoing than it did in the
doing," he continued.</p>
<p>The poor wretch shuddered.</p>
<p>"She had written a few words of farewell to one or two," he
said, "and told how we were going to die together, and when and
where. . . . Her mother and some others burst in and found me
with her body in my arms and my untasted poison beside me. . . .
I went mad. I raved. I denounced myself. A vile woman who had
once loved me, jeered at me and bade me drink my share and rid
the world of myself. . . . I could not. . . . My own gang bound
me on my bed, and one of them brought an old chisel and the half
of an iron pipe split lengthways. With the straight edge and the
semicircular one, they did their work. I was their prisoner
for--ah! <i>how</i> long? And then they tattooed the scars--not
satisfied with their handiwork as it was. . . . Before her
husband found me I had fled to the shelter of the Legion. . . . I
told the surgeon at Fort St. Jean that it was done by a rival
gang because I had pretended to join them and did not. He gave me
a roll of the sticking-plaster and advised me, for my comfort, to
hide my '<i>endossement</i>' as he brutally called it." . . .</p>
<p>"Well, now get rid of it," interrupted John Bull.</p>
<p>"The flat iron clamp, binding the corners of that
packing-case, would be the very thing. You are <i>not</i> a
coward. You proved that to-day. Prove it more highly to-night,
and, when they decorate you, let there be a still more honourable
decoration beneath--the scars of a great victory. . . . Come on."
. . .</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When old Jean Jacques Dubonnet fell, many years later, at
Verdun, the Colonel of his battalion, on hearing the news,
remarked, "I have lost my bravest soldier."</p>
<p>The marks of a terrible burn on his chest were almost
obliterated by German bullets and bayonets.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c112" id="c112"><i>Mahdev Rao</i></a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>The Legion's net is as wide as its meshes are close; and some
rare, as well as queer, fish find their way into it.</p>
<p>Possibly the rarest that it ever contained was a Mahratta
soldier who, during the Great War, found his way, always toward
the rising sun, across a hundred miles of African jungle, until
he reached the sea, and there, boarding a <i>dhow</i> at night,
was carried across hundreds of miles of ocean.</p>
<p>The crew of the <i>dhow</i> was an interesting one, among its
members being two French gentlemen, one an Intelligence Officer
and the other a kindly priest, formerly of Goa--neither of whom
was in anywise distinguishable from his sea-faring Arab
colleagues.</p>
<p>The <i>dhow,</i> of a humble, unobtrusive and diffident
disposition, had business at a lone coastal outpost where flies
the <i>Tricouleur,</i> and where sins and suffers a small
garrison, of Colonial Infantry and of the Legion. . . .</p>
<p>Here the said priest, whose fairish knowledge of the Marathi
tongue had enabled him to understand something of the soldier's
story, was glad to assist him to attain his highest ambition--to
fight against his personal and national enemies, once more.</p>
<p>As a trained soldier and a stout fellow he found favour in the
sight of the Commandant of the post, was duly enrolled as a
soldier of France, and eventually found himself precisely where
he desired to be. . . .</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Mahdev Rao Ramrao, son of Ramrao Krishnaji, was born in a
little mud-walled village that nestles above its rice-fields on
the slope of the Western Ghats, in the Deccan of India.</p>
<p>High up above the village, its outline clear-cut against the
sky, was the fort, "<i>Den of the Tiger</i>," from which Mahdev
Rao's forbears, led by Shivaji the Great, had swept down to harry
the plains, to plunder towns, and to fight the invading
Mussulman. . . .</p>
<p>As he toddled about the crooked streets of tiny mud-built
Nagaum, clutching the finger of his grandfather, Krishnaji Arjun,
the little fat Mahdev Rao, clad in an embroidered velvet cap and
a necklace, learned that he was a Pukka Bahadur, a mighty one,
the son, grandson, great-grandson, and general descendant of
soldiers, fierce fighting men--from the days of Shivaji the Great
three hundred years ago, to the days of Wellesley Sahib (who had
fought in those very parts), Nicholson Sahib, Outram Sahib (whose
Orderly, grandfather's own father had been), Havelock Sahib,
Roberts Sahib, even unto the days of the Great Lat-Sahib
Kitchener, the Elephant of War, whose shadow had destroyed the
<i>Hubshis</i> <sup>1</sup> and their prophet the Mahdi. . .
.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><sup>1</sup> "Woolly ones" (negroes).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And, as he grew up, Mahdev Rao understood that he was a
<i>Kshattria,</i> of the caste next to the Brahmins themselves;
that he was a cradle-ordained soldier, and that he had traditions
to reverence and maintain. So he developed into a fine proud
youth, self-respecting, ambitious, and religious beyond the
conception of the vast majority of Europeans.</p>
<p>In due course, the day came when, as his father, his
grandfather, and his great-grandfather had done, he sallied forth
from Nagaum, and tramped to the recruiting-depôt at Belara to
take service under the Sahibs as a Sepoy--to serve the King
Emperor as his father and grandfather had served the Queen, and
his other ancestors had served John Company or their own Rajah in
due season. His intention was to be faithful to his salt; his
ambition was to rise to be a Havildar, possibly a Jemadar, and
conceivably a Subedar; his hope was to return to Nagaum full of
honours, with medals and a pension, and to superintend the
cultivation of the family plot of land (theirs since the days of
Shivaji, the Scourge of the Deccan) and the upbringing of his
sons and grandsons. . . . But Fate willed otherwise, and affairs
in Nagaum were affected by the fact that an egotistical
megalomaniac was making a God in his own image, seven thousand
miles away in Berlin. . . .</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>As a white-clad recruit at Belara, life went very well for
Mahdev Rao the Mahratta, and when he found himself a khaki-clad
full private of the Old Hundredth Bombay Rifles, he found himself
indeed.</p>
<p>He was that happy man, the man whose day is full of work that
is his hobby, work that he loves, work that is his play. The
Jemadar of his double-company was an old friend of his father,
and his own Havildar was a Nagaum man. Him, Mahdev Rao cultivated
with such words and gifts as are fitting--and highly politic. The
Captain Sahib of his double-company was a <i>pukka</i> Sahib, a
great <i>shikari,</i> horseman, athlete and soldier. The
descendant of Pindaris could understand and admire the descendant
of Norman free-booters and Elizabethan gentlemen-adventurers and
soldiers of fortune. The Colonel Sahib, with his nine
medal-ribbons, white moustache, and burning eye, was Mahdev Rao's
idea and ideal of a Man. At an age when Mahdev Rao's people were
getting a little senile and more than a little shaky, he seemed
as young and active as a Mahdev himself--yea, though as old as
Mahdev's grandfather. Sepoys who had seen him at work on the
Frontier, when the Ghazis charged home like wounded tigers, spoke
of him with bated breath. This was a Bahadur of Bahadurs, a
<i>Man.</i> Oh, to die in battle under his approving eye! What
bliss! . . . The Adjutant Sahib, Mahdev disliked and feared,
though he respected him. (It seems the painful duty of a good
Adjutant to make himself disliked and feared, as it is his
gratifying privilege to be respected.) . . .</p>
<p>And, by the time war broke out, in August, 1914, the Regiment
was Mahdev Rao's happy home; the Colonel Sahib was, in his own
expressive phrase, "his Father and his Mother," and his Mahratta
comrades were his brothers.</p>
<p>Incidentally and severally, his <i>guru,</i> his Captain,
Lieutenant, Subedar, Jemadar and Havildar were also his Father
and his Mother; and the honour of his Regiment was the honour of
Mahdev Rao. Even the Punjabi Mahommedans and Pathans of the other
double-companies were worthy souls, inasmuch as they were part of
the Regiment; and still more so the Sikhs, Rajputs, and Dogras;
but, of course, the very salt of the Regiment, which was the salt
of the Army, which was the salt of the Earth, was Mahdev Rao's
double-company of Deccani Mahrattas.</p>
<p>When it was known, a few months later, that the Regiment was
to go on Active Service, Mahdev Rao's cup of happiness was
already full, by reason of the fact that he had that very day
defeated Pandurang Bagu and became champion wrestler of the
Regiment--a distinction which guarantees that its holder would
give a little trouble to any wrestler in the world, be his
nationality and eminence what it might. . . . Judge of the
swamping, seething overflow of the said cup of happiness when the
news came, plain and indubitable, through the regimental
<i>babu,</i> that the Old Hundredth Bombay Rifles were to proceed
forthwith to the city of Bombay and embark for East Africa!</p>
<p>Here was news indeed! News of increased saving from pay,
decreased expenses, a certain medal, the chances of decoration
and promotion; and adventure, experience, change. . . . Of
course, to cross the Black Water was to lose caste, but the
<i>guru</i> and the village priests would soon put that right and
provide dispensation at not too exorbitant rates. Marvellous
fellows, the Brahmins, at wangling a thing when there was money
in it. . . .</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The ten days' journey from Bombay to Mombasa was very
wonderful to Mahdev Rao, who had scarcely seen the sea before,
and had never set foot on a ship or boat of any description. . .
. The problem of how it propelled itself without sails or wheels
puzzled him exceedingly, and still more so the problem of how it
found its way, day after day, night after night, from one spot on
the coast of India to another spot on the coast of Africa. And
not just any old spot, mark you, but a definite given place at
which it would arrive at a stated time. Certainly the Sahibs up
on the bridge could not see across the space of a ten days'
journey with the most powerful of field-glasses. . . .</p>
<p>It was a surprise to him to find that the shores of this new
and strange continent were remarkably like those of India, and
that the coconut groves of the Kilindini inlet, between the
island of Mombasa and the mainland, might have come straight from
Bombay . . . But then surprises came so thick and fast, that his
mind, always more tenacious than acute, became dulled, and he
ceased to be surprised at anything--even at the fact that he was
expected to fight in jungle so dense that no human being could
move through it, save along the foot-wide paths that wound and
twisted from village to village or from ford to ford. But
<i>how</i> was a man to fight in such country, and what was a
double-company to do, accustomed as it was to attack in extended
order, and taught never to fire a round until there was a visible
enemy to fire at? How <i>could</i> it fight in single file, with
an impenetrable wall of trees, creepers, bush and thorn on either
side? . . .</p>
<p>The days between the debarkation at Mombasa and the occupation
by his double-company of an advanced outpost (days of weary
marching through jungle and swamp) passed like a dream, and
Mahdev Rao settled down to the routine of this new strange life
in a swamp-jungle, and soon felt as though he had never known any
other.</p>
<p>It was not a pleasant life, for it was monotonous, unhealthy,
and dull, the heat was terrific, food was not all it might have
been, fever and dysentery were rife and, in his own phrase, "air
and water were bad."</p>
<p>But Mahdev Rao was too keen a soldier to grumble. One did not
expect Active Service to be like a furlough-trip to one's home,
nor to have the comforts and luxuries of Nagaum, Belara or
Bombay, in this enemy's country--the loathsome swamp where lived
the <i>Hubshis</i> under the rule of their <i>Germani</i> masters
(a kind of White Men, he gathered, who were not Sahibs).</p>
<p>So he trudged along cheerily when his half of the little
garrison went marching on a reconnaissance into the enemy's
country; did his sentry-go smartly; sat watching with keen
untiring eyes on the <i>machan</i> in the tree-top, when such was
his duty; and scouted warily along the jungle tracks when sent
out with a comrade to patrol to the next outpost. . . .</p>
<p>"That Mahdev Rao's a good lad," remarked Captain Delamere to
Lieutenant Carr as they sat in the grass-hut "Officers' Mess" of
the outpost, one evening, and tried to masticate the tinned
string and encaustic tiles, served out to them under the name of
bully-beef and biscuit.</p>
<p>"Always merry and bright, and chucks a chest when some of the
other blokes begin to slouch and lag a bit."</p>
<p>"Yes," agreed Carr; "he'll make a damgood Havildar some day. .
. . Might make him a Lance-Naik now. . . . Hardly the brains to
go further than Havildar, I am afraid . . . but we c'd do with a
few thousand Mahdev Raos out here." . . .</p>
<p>"We'll give him a stripe," said Delamere, as he tried to cut
up some black-cake ration-tobacco (horrible cheap poison), with
the one and only table-knife.</p>
<p>"Why the devil can't they issue tobacco a man can smoke, if
they're going to issue a tobacco-ration at all? . . . " he
growled, and added: "Yes--we'll give Mahdev Rao a stripe." . . .
But it was some one else, and a very different person, who gave
Mahdev Rao his stripes.</p>
<p>For, on the following day, he and Pandurang Bagu, patrolling
to meet the patrol from the next outpost, were ambushed.</p>
<p>There was a sudden burst of fire from a tree-top, as well as
from the bush before and behind them, and Pandurang Bagu went
down with a heavy bullet of soft lead in his shattered hip-joint.
Almost simultaneously, Mahdev Rao was felled by the blow of a
rifle-butt, as he raised his rifle to fire at big khaki-clad
<i>Hubshis,</i> in tall khaki grenadier-caps, who rushed at him
in front.</p>
<p>"Good!" grunted the Swahili sergeant in charge of the squad.
"That one will be able to talk. Kill the other."</p>
<p>Seven bayonets were plunged into Pandurang Bagu as, with
trembling hands, he raised his rifle. As one does not get the
pleasure of plunging one's bayonet into an enemy every day, the
Swahilis and Yaos made the most of their opportunity, and
Pandurang Bagu's life ebbed quickly out through dozens of wounds.
. . . The Sergeant was a happy man, and his ebon countenance was
wreathed in smiles. He had been sent out, by the <i>Herr
Offizier,</i> with orders to ambush a patrol and bring in at
least one member of it alive--and he had succeeded to
perfection.</p>
<p>One night's wait in a most admirable ambush; strict orders
<i>not</i> to shoot the last man of the patrol--be there a dozen
or be there but two--and to spring out at each end of the ambush
and capture the survivor alive; five seconds of smart work as per
programme, and the job was done.</p>
<p>And done very neatly--for there are few braver or more skilful
soldiers in the world than these African Rifles, when fighting in
their own unique jungle. . . .</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>When Mahdev Rao recovered consciousness (which he did very
quickly, thanks to his thick skull and thicker turban) he found
himself a prisoner. His hands were bound behind his back, he was
stripped almost naked, and his kit and accoutrements were being
examined and looted by his captors.</p>
<p>He realized that he was bare-headed and that the long tuft of
hair, left among the cropped stubble (that the gods might lift
him into heaven, when his time came), was hanging down his
back.</p>
<p>He ground his teeth at the shameful outrage these casteless
sons of pariah-dogs had put upon him, in knocking his turban off
and exposing his bare head. He rose to his knees and staggered to
his feet, only to be knocked down again from behind.</p>
<p>"If you strike him senseless, you will have to carry him,
Achmet Ali," said the Sergeant. "He has to be in the <i>boma</i>
<sup>1</sup> by tomorrow morning, alive, and able to answer the
questions of the <i>Bwana Macouba</i>." <sup>2</sup> . . .</p>
<p> </p>
<p><sup>1</sup> Enclosure; jungle fort. <sup>2</sup> Great
Master.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I am the hero who knocked him down first," said Achmet Ali,
and straightway improvised a chant.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"I am the hero,<br>
The swift-striking hero,<br>
I am the hero<br>
Who knocked him down first."</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>"Be also the hero that drives him along with a bayonet, then,"
interrupted the Sergeant, "and you'll be the hero whose head I
will blow off if the dog escapes."</p>
<p>And, for the remainder of that day and all that night, the
<i>askaris</i> drove Mahdev Rao (as the potter and <i>dhobi</i>
of Nagaum drive their donkeys) with blows and curses.</p>
<p>Once, during one of the brief halts, food was offered him
(cold boiled rice and a plantain), and he tried to give these
foul Untouchables, these casteless carrion-scavengers, some faint
idea of the unutterable pollution of the very thought of taking
food from their defiling hands--the filthy <i>Hubshi</i> dogs! .
. .</p>
<p>"He is too frightened to eat, poor heathen Infidel dog,"
remarked the Sergeant to Achmet Ali, as he turned towards Mecca
and prostrated himself in prayer. . . .</p>
<p>While fording a river, next morning, Mahdev Rao endeavoured to
drown himself and the hero, to the boundless amusement of the
rest of the squad. The hero revenged himself by making a pattern
of cuts upon his captive's back with the point of his bayonet.
But they were only about an inch long and quarter of an inch
deep, and not likely to affect his value when questioned by the
<i>Bwana Macouba</i> as to the number and disposition of the
British forces.</p>

<p>The <i>Germani boma</i> was very similar to the one from which
Mahdev Rao had come, but considerably larger. Dazed and starving
as he was, he noted its strength, the height of its palisades,
the depth of its trenches, the number of its machine-guns, and
the strength of its garrison of native African Rifles
<i>(askaris)</i> and <i>Germani</i> Europeans. He was surprised
to see that the majority of the latter wore beards. . . . He had
never before seen a European officer or soldier with a beard. . .
. Obviously the <i>askaris</i> were well drilled and highly
disciplined.</p>
<p>Also, everything about the place was well done. The huts were
neater and stronger and better thatched than in his own
<i>boma,</i> paths were more neatly made and kept, the earthworks
were bigger and stronger. Evidently the <i>Germanis</i> had more
coolie-labourers and got more work out of them, or else they gave
more attention to these details. Certainly it was a very strong
<i>boma,</i> and very strongly garrisoned. He had seen twelve
machine-guns and two small quick-firers (something like Indian
mountain-battery guns) already. He would have a lot to tell the
Captain Sahib when he escaped and got back to the outpost. . . .
But would they not take very especial care that he did not
escape, after he had seen so much? . . . And how was he to find
his way back to his Company through that dense blind jungle, if
he did escape? . . . It had got to be done, anyhow--and then he
could lead the Captain Sahib and the double-company to this
place, and they could rush it at dawn, with much slaughter of
black untouchable pariahs who kept a high-caste Indian
bare-headed, offered him polluted food and water with their
defiling hands, struck him, and generally behaved like the
savages they were. . . .</p>
<p>Doubtless, however, their <i>Germani</i> masters would punish
them and do justice. Though not <i>pukka</i> Sahibs, they were
White Men, and, as such, would have understanding and a sense of
decency.</p>
<p>White Men do not offend against the religion of others; they
understand caste and respect it; they know that prisoners of war
are to be honourably treated. . . . Yes, they understand a
high-caste man, and know the difference between a dog of a
low-caste negro <i>askari</i> of Africa, and a high-caste
<i>Kshattria</i> Sepoy of India; the difference between one who
comes next to the Brahmins themselves and one who is utterly
beyond the pale, a walking pollution to earth, air, and water,
whose very shadow is a defilement and a desecration to what it
falls upon. . . . Yes, it would be all right when he was brought
face to face with their officers, even though they were
<i>Germanis. . . .</i></p>
<p>He was hustled into a filthy grass hut in which were four
negroes--spies, defaulters and guides, the last being kept in
bonds with the criminals, by reason of their incurable desire to
leave the service of their employers and captors. . . .</p>
<p>Later he was haled forth--still bare-headed, bound, and
half-naked--to where, beneath a tree, sat three Europeans,
attended by a Sergeant and guard of <i>askaris,</i> and one or
two nondescript persons, including a half-caste in European
clothing, a clerk, and a servant. On a camp-table before the
White Men were bottles of beer, glasses, a revolver, a heavy
<i>kiboko</i> <sup>1</sup> of rhinoceros-hide, a map, and a
notebook.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><sup>1</sup> Whip.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The central figure of the three (one Von Groener), who wore a
khaki uniform, blue putties and a white-topped peaked cap, bade
the half-caste ask the prisoner the name of his regiment, the
number of men in his <i>boma,</i> and the number of machine-guns
it contained--for a start.</p>
<p>The "half"-caste, a Negroid Goanese-Arab-Indian, put the
questions in the barbarous Hindustani of the Goanese quarter of
Dar-es-Salaam. Mahdev Rao, a Mahratta, always speaking Marathi in
the Regiment, knew little more Hindustani than he did
English.</p>
<p>"<i>Tera pulton ka nam kya hai?"</i> said the "interpreter."
"<i>Kitni admi tera boma men hain? Kitni tup-tup tup-tup bandook
hain?</i>" <sup>1</sup></p>
<p> </p>
<p><sup>1</sup> " What is the name of your regiment? How many men
are there in your outpost? How many machine-guns?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mahdev Rao had a fair idea as to what the man was driving at,
but he looked stupid, and, in Marathi, replied:</p>
<p>"I do not understand."</p>
<p>Mr. Alonzo Gomez had never heard Marathi in his life.</p>
<p>"The man does not understand the language of India, <i>Herr
Kommandant,</i>" he said, in clumsy German, to the officer who
sat in the centre.</p>
<p>"But that is absurd," replied that worthy. "If he comes from
India he knows the language of India. Tell him I will
<i>kiboko</i> the flesh from his bones if he tries to fool
<i>me.</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Bwana Sahib tumko kiboko diega,</i>" <sup>1</sup> answered
Gomez to the prisoner.</p>
<p><sup> </sup></p>
<p>1 " The Master will flog you."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I will try him in English," said the senior officer to the
others. "The English give all drill-orders in English; therefore
this animal understands English."</p>
<p>"<i>Ja! Ja!</i>" agreed the other two. "<i>Ganz klein
wenig</i>."</p>
<p>"Hear, pig-dog," quoth the senior gentleman, "his battalion
what his name calls? How large are man-number of it? How large
are gun-machine-number of it? Isn't it?"</p>
<p>To Mahdev Rao, at least two of the gutturally pronounced words
were familiar. "Sahib," he said in Marathi, "I am a Sepoy and a
prisoner of war. I am not a spy. And I am very tired and
thirsty." . . .</p>
<p>"The swine is contumacious," said the senior. "He understands
both English and Hindustani. He is shamming. We will help him to
find his wits--and his tongue," and he gave a curt order to the
<i>askari</i> Sergeant. (Also to the Swahili servant--concerning
the replenishment of the beer supply.) He was a handsome man of
about forty, with a small forked beard, a cold blue eye, and a
hard domineering expression. Once he had been an ornament of
Berlin and Potsdam, an <i>Ober-Leutnant</i> of Grenadiers; but
debt, drink, cards, and an unfortunate duel, had sent him into
exile. In exile he had grown morose, bitter and savage, loathing
and blaming everything and every one--except himself.</p>
<p>Of his companions, one was a ne'er-do-well relation of a
German General and had been shipped to German East Africa to die
of fever, beer, and dissipation; the other was an
<i>ex-Feldwebel</i> of the Prussian Guard who had made money as
an elephant-poacher and then done exceeding well as a trader and
planter--well from the financial point of view <i>bien
entendu;</i> from the moral point of view he had not done very
well.</p>
<p>The three were not typical of their class, and were of wholly
different fibre from their General (a great soldier and a
gentleman).</p>
<p>They were three bad men, bad by the standards of the German
colony--and the order that <i>Ober-Leutnant</i> von Groener had
given, and that his colleagues had applauded, was that Mahdev
Rao, prisoner of war, captured in uniform, upon his lawful
occasions as a soldier, should be tied to a tree and flogged with
the terrible rhinoceros-hide <i>kiboko</i> with which the German
instils discipline into his native soldiers, servants, coolies,
criminals, and lady "housekeepers."</p>
<p>Mahdev Rao was seized by the <i>askari</i> guard, and so tied
that he was hugging, with arms and legs, the big tree beneath
which the "court" was sitting.</p>
<p>In the hands of a huge, brawny, and most willing Sergeant of
<i>askaris,</i> the five-foot <i>kiboko,</i> tapering from the
thickness of a man's wrist to that of his little finger, supple
as india-rubber, and tougher than anything in the world, is a
most terrible instrument of torture and punishment. The "draw" of
the scientific pulling-stroke (as of one who cuts through a stick
with one slice of a knife) of the <i>kiboko</i> lacerates and
mangles, blood leaping at every blow. . . .</p>
<p>By the time the three German gentlemen considered that Mahdev
Rao was sufficiently exhorted, encouraged, and rebuked (for his
contumaciousness), he was also senseless and apparently dead. . .
. It was annoying, as the <i>Herr Ober-Leutnant</i> had hoped to
obtain much interesting and useful information concerning the
Indian Expeditionary Force, and to send it to Head-Quarters. . .
.</p>
<p>Mahdev Rao recovered consciousness in the same prison-hut. He
was alone, and the fact that there was no one present to see such
a fall from grace, aided the terrible pangs of thirst in inducing
him to drink from the gourd of water that stood in the corner. .
. . Later, he ate a couple of plantains. . . . As they were
covered by their skins, the interior had not been defiled--or, at
any rate, one could take a certain amount of comfort from such a
theory and argument.</p>
<p>Later still, he bowed to the inevitable, and ate the cold
boiled rice his <i>askari</i> gaoler brought him. It was a
terrible thing to do--but life was dear--and revenge was dearer.
He would live, at any cost, to be revenged upon
that--that--swine, and son of swine--that offspring of pariah
curs--that carrion-eating lump of defilement and pollution--who
had had him, <i>him,</i> Sepoy Mahdev Rao of the Old Hundredth
Bombay Rifles, flogged, publicly flogged, by black beasts of
<i>Hubshis. . . .</i></p>
<p>Great as were his physical sufferings, his mental sufferings
were a thousand times greater. His body felt pain: his mind felt
agonizing tortures and excruciating torments unspeakable. . . .
He ground his teeth, clenched his fists, and cried aloud in rage
and horror--and then fell silent and still . . . for no--he must
not go mad, he must not lose strength, he must not die--until he
had had his revenge. . . .</p>
<p>Next day he was questioned again and flogged again.</p>
<p>At the end of a week, the <i>Ober-Leutnant</i> decided to send
him to Head-Quarters at Mombobora. There was a Missionary Father
in the town, who had worked in India and would know the language
perfectly. There was also a hospital, where they would patch the
dog up, that he might be able to converse with the Father. . . .
Anyhow--since the Colonel seemed to think that he, the
<i>Ober-Leutnant,</i> had shown little skill in his endeavours to
get information from this Indian, let him see if he could do any
better himself. . . .</p>
<p>At Head-Quarters they learnt nothing from Mahdev Rao, though
he learnt much from them concerning the difference between German
and British methods of dealing with native prisoners who will not
"talk."</p>
<p>He was not flogged, but he was abused, starved, bound,
insulted, and finally herded with a chain-gang of negro
criminals, and set to such work as road-sweeping and
latrine-cleaning.</p>
<p>What this means to a man of caste, no one who has not lived in
India can guess, and no one but a high-caste Indian can know.
Nothing worse can happen to him.</p>
<p>And, from time to time, he was brought before the Missionary,
who talked to him in excellent Marathi, promising him all kinds
of rewards if he would describe the composition and disposition
of the Expeditionary Force from India. . . . Were there Pathans
and Gurkhas in it? . . . Were there field-batteries? . . . Were
there Pioneer Corps? . . . Had part of it gone by the Uganda
Railway to Nairobi and the Lakes? . . . Were the Sepoys loyal? .
. . If he returned to them with much money and more promises,
would he be able to induce any of them to desert? . . . What was
the state of feeling in India? . . . And much more, until Mahdev
Rao, maddened, sullen, brutalized, barely sane, by reason of his
wrongs, cruelties, and immeasurable degradations, would lift up
his voice and curse the <i>padre,</i> the evil white
<i>fakir,</i> until his guards smote him on the mouth and dragged
him away--a naked, filthy wreck of a man. . . .</p>
<p>Constantly he sought an opportunity of escape from the town,
but found none.</p>
<p>He must have food, a weapon of some kind, and he must get more
strength and recover his health, get rid of this fever, before he
could take the opportunity if one offered. But when he was not
road-sweeping or road-making with the chain-gang, he was
otherwise working, always under the eye of an <i>askari</i>
guard, who asked nothing better than an excuse to shoot him. . .
.</p>
<p>No--he must wait, and it was always possible that the
<i>Germani</i> officer, who had flogged him, might come to this
Head-Quarters, and save Mahdev Rao the journey to that
gentleman's <i>boma.</i></p>
<p>For Mahdev Rao's one idea now, his one reason for living, was
to avenge himself upon <i>Ober-Leutnant</i> von Groener--the man
who, instead of treating him as a prisoner of war, had had him
publicly flogged, and had then sent him to this place where a
high-caste Indian Sepoy was as a cannibal negro criminal, and was
herded with them. . . . He did not wish to live. He did not wish
to return to India--he was too eternally and utterly defiled,
polluted, and out-caste for that. But he did not intend to die
until he had met the <i>Germani</i> who had had him flogged, the
man whom he regarded as the arch-type of his captors, the man who
had brought him into this living death of defilement, the man who
was the cause of all his woes. . . .</p>
<p>To listen seriously to the Missionary Father's temptations to
treachery never occurred to him. He was Sepoy Mahdev Rao of the
Old Hundredth Bombay Rifles, a soldier of the King Emperor, and
son of a long line of brave and honest fighting men, "true to
salt," and loyal as hilt to blade. . . .</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>One morning, with the rest of a road-sweeping gang, Mahdev Rao
was working at a spot just outside the native "town" of
Mombobora, where a little bridge crossed a muddy stream, more mud
than stream, that lay between two tracts of cultivation. . .
.</p>
<p>A squad of <i>askaris</i> tramped past . . . a doctor and two
nurses . . . a small herd of cattle . . . a German lady in a kind
of rickshaw . . . an officer in a hammock slung from a stout
bamboo pole, borne by four Kavarondo natives . . . a file of
negresses with water-jars upon their heads . . . and then--did
his eyes deceive him?--his Enemy, the man who had had him
flogged!</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>. . . Strolling along, taking the morning air, came
<i>Ober-Leutnant</i> Fritz von Groener, who had been summoned to
Mombobora by the Colonel, and had arrived on the previous
day.</p>
<p>As he reached the little bridge, a crouching man, a filthy,
half-naked wretch of the road-gang, suddenly rose and sprang at
him, drove him sideways and backwards, before he could raise his
heavy whip or draw his automatic--and seized him in a grip,
scientific and powerful, the hold of a champion wrestler, in whom
was the strength of madness and the lust of revenge.</p>
<p>Before the lounging <i>askari</i> guard heard a sound of the
struggle, the two, swaying and straining, fell against the low
coping of the bridge, toppled over it, and splashed heavily into
the liquid mud beneath--the German officer beneath the Indian
soldier, whose hands were at his throat, whose knee was on his
chest, and who, slowly, strongly, surely, thrust his head beneath
the foul slime, and held it there as the writhing bodies sank and
splashed in the watery mud. . . .</p>
<p>It is probable that the <i>Herr Ober-Leutnant</i> was dead
before Askari Mustapha Moussa, in charge of the road-gang, had
realized that something was wrong, had reached the bridge-head
and had made up what must be called his mind, that it was his
duty to risk a shot at the "coolie."</p>
<p>Certainly he was dead enough when the hands of Mahdev Rao were
at length torn from his throat, and the two were dragged from the
mud into which they were disappearing. . . .</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Rumours of the approach of an enemy force caused much
confusion that night, and Sepoy Mahdev Rao, sentenced to be shot
at dawn, decided to view the dawn elsewhere than in Mombobora, or
to die in an attempt to turn this confusion to good account. . .

<h1><a name="c113" id="c113"><i>The Merry Liars</i></a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>A competition in lying was proceeding, and entries were good.
(One Légionnaire told of his beloved pet rabbit which nibbled
lead, ate cordite, swallowed a burning match--and then went out
and shot its own, and its master's, supper.)</p>
<p>"Yep," growled the Bucking Bronco, as the little group of
Legionaries, from all corners of the earth and all strata of
human society, turned toward him, "I allow I can tell as big a
lie as Ole Man Dobroffski--even if I <i>ain't</i> the Czar of
Roosia's gran'pa's little gan'chile,
Wilhelmine-Bungorfski-Poporf."</p>
<p>Père Jean Boule, "father" of the Second Battalion, and
incidentally an English baronet, moved uneasily. The Bucking
Bronco had always disliked the Russian aristocrat, and had never
made any secret of the fact. If ever they fought, there would not
be two survivors of that fight . . . and the Bucking Bronco was
his beloved and loving friend, and a mine of virtues, though a
Bad Man--of the best sort. He had been, among other things, a
miner, cowboy, tramp, lumberman, professional boxer, U.S.A.
trooper, and ornament of a Wild West show, of which he was the
trick revolver-shot.</p>
<p>"Ah . . . you allus was a purple liar, Buck," put in 'Erb, the
Cockney, as the American produced a deplorable French pipe and
some more deplorable French tobacco. (<i>How</i> his soul yearned
for a corn-cob and some Golden Bar, or "the makings" and a bag of
Bull Durham!)</p>
<p>"I give a guy a picky-back once," continued the Bucking
Bronco, ignoring 'Erb, whom he usually treated as a mastiff
treats a small cur.</p>
<p>"But how interesting!" murmured the ex-Colonel of the Imperial
Guard, who called himself "Dobroffski."</p>
<p>"And it killed that guy, and it killed his gal, and it sent me
bug-house--<i>loco</i>--for Devil-knows-how-long-an'-all,"
continued the American, ignoring Dobroffski as he had ignored
'Erb.</p>
<p>"What is it that it is, then--this '<i>bug-'ouse'</i> and this
'<i>loco</i>'?" murmured le Légionnaire Alphonse Blanc, whose
English included no American.</p>
<p>"Same as what you'd call 'dotty'--or 'off 'is
onion'--'looney'--'balmy on the crumpet'--in yore silly lingo,"
explained 'Erb helpfully.</p>
<p>"<i>Fou,</i>" murmured La Cigale, for the benefit of Blanc and
Tant-de-Soif, whose knowledge of English was limited also. (La
Cigale, the ex-Belgian officer, knew all there was to know about
<i>démence,</i> poor soul.)</p>
<p>"Wot killed 'em? Was it the sight o' the faices you
made--doin' the job o' work?" inquired 'Erb.</p>
<p>The Bucking Bronco leaned back against the wall of rough-hewn,
thickly-mortared grey stones, spread his huge legs abroad, and
blew a cloud of smoke. He was wearing his <i>capote</i> (the long
blue great-coat) and red trousers tucked into black leggings, but
he shivered as though cold.</p>
<p>"I can see that gal's face now," he said, staring out across
the ocean of sand that surrounded the fort; and the enormous
powerful man, with his long arms, big hands, leathern face, and
heavy drooping moustache, looked ill and fell silent.</p>
<p>"Wish <i>I</i> could, Ole Cock," observed 'Erb. "Where's she
'iding?"</p>
<p>"And Bud Conklin's feet, too, a danglin' just above me face.
Ole Bud Conklin, what I'd bin a road-kid with, an' took the trail
with ever-since-when--ranchin'; gold-prospectin', with a rusty
pan and a bag o' flour; ridin' the blind, right across the
States; lumberin'; throwin' our feet fer a two-bit poke-out, in
the towns; and trampin' through the alkali sage bush, as thirsty
as a bitch with nine pups.</p>
<p>"Bud Conklin was a blowed-in-the-glass White Man, an' I was
the death of him. Yes, Sir. <i>And</i> his gal--a little peach,
named Mame Texas. . . . I guess she begun life as 'Mame o'
Texas,' never hevin' hed no parients--nawthen to speak of--'cos
Dago Jake had lifted her outer Ole Pete Frisco's ranch when his
gang shot th' ol' sinner up, down Texas way (an' <i>he</i> never
hed no wife--nawthen to speak of) and burnt the place down.</p>
<p>"An' when she filled out and grow'd up a bit, Dago Jake he got
that sot on the gal, he allowed as he'd give any man
lead-pisenin' as looked at her twice; an' he beat her up every
time he got a whisky-jag, so' she shouldn't look twice at nobody
else.</p>
<p>"Marry her? No! There wasn't no sky-pilots around Hackberry
Crossin' by the Frio River in them prickly-pear flats; an' Dago
Jake dassn't show his ugly face near no church-bearin' city--even
if he'd held with matterimony as a pastime.</p>
<p>"Nope! Nix on marryin' fer Jake.</p>
<p>"Then me an' Bud eventuates in Hackberry Crossin', travellin'
mighty modest and unconspishus, after arguin' with a disbelievin'
roller of a Ranger as allowed we'd found our pinto hosses before
no one hadn't lost 'em.</p>
<p>"An' it was up to us to lose ourselves an' keep away with both
feet after we'd collected that cracker-jack's hoss, an' gun
likewise, <i>and</i> the financial events in the pockets of his
pants.</p>
<p>"He was a sure annoyed boob when me an' Bud told him good-bye
an' set his erring feet for Quatana--having took his belt and
pant-suspenders and bootlaces so's he'd hev to hold his pants up
with one hand an' his boots on with the other. An' then we burnt
the trail for Hackberry Crossin', day an' night, and went to
earth at Dago Jake's, sech being Jake's perfession.</p>
<p>"Bud didn' look at Mame twice. Nope, <i>once</i> was enuff,
but it lasted all the time she was in sight! . . . Bud took it
bad. . . . He wrote po'try. An' he made me listen to it while we
wolfed out mornin' <i>frijoles</i> an' cawfy, or evenin'
goat-mutton steaks an' canned termatoes, an' forty-rod whisky.
Bud's fav'rite spasm begun:--</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>'<i>O Mame, which art not in reach,<br>
O Mame, thou art a peach!<br>
I fair must let a screech<br>
Or else my heart it will be too full for
speech.'</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>An' there was about twenty noo verses each day. He made 'em up
outa his silly head while we lay doggo, up in the pear-thicket
along the <i>arroyo</i> behint Jake's abode.</p>
<p>"An' by the time the Sheriff, an' the Lootenant of Rangers,
an' the Town Marshal o' Quatana begun to allow that no such
suspicious characters as me an' Bud hadn't ever crossed the Frio
at Hackberry Crossin', Bud was nearly as much in love with Mame
as Mame was with Bud.</p>
<p>"They <i>hed</i> got it bad.</p>
<p>"And soon that low-lifer coyote of a Dago Jake, he begins to
smell a rat, and afore long he smells a elephant. Bud wants to
shoot him up, but Mame won't stand for it. She don't want Bud to
swing fer a goshdinged tough like Jake. '<i>It would be
man-slaughterin' murder,</i>' says she; '<i>besides which, Jake
kin pull a gun as quick as greased lightnin'. Yew ain't got
nawthen on Jake at that game,'</i> she says, '<i>wherefore I
holds it onlawful and calc'lated to cause a breach of the
peace</i>--<i>and o' yew likewise, Bud</i>,' an' she kisses him
like hell, we-all being in the pear-thicket, an' me lookin' the
other way like I was searchin' fer me lost youth an' innercence.
. . ."</p>
<p>"Wot abaht this 'ere picky-back, Buck?" interrupted 'Erb.
"Thought you was agoin' to tell a thunderin' good lie abaht
killing yer pal an' 'is donah, through playin' picky-backs with
'em."</p>
<p>Le Légionnaire Reginald Rupert, leaning forward from his place
on the bench, smote 'Erb painfully in the ribs: William Jones
crushed the little man's <i>képi</i> over his face: while La
Cigale, in the voice of one who chides a dog, hissed
"<i>Tais-toi, canaille!</i>" in an unwonted fit of anger at the
unmannerly interruption.</p>
<p>"But what is it that it is, this peek-a-back?" whispered
Alphonse Blanc to John Bull, as the Bucking Bronco turned his
slow contemptuous regard upon 'Erb.</p>
<p>"As to say, <i>sur-le-dos,</i>" replied the old Legionary,
seizing the Cockney in a grip of iron as he prepared to deal
faithfully with Rupert and Jones (who had been Captain Geoffry
Brabazon-Howard of the Black Lancers).</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>"And the end of it was," continued the American, "that we made
our get-away, the three of us, one night; mighty clever, we
thought, until we heard Dago Jake laugh--at our very first
campin' ground! . . .</p>
<p>"I'd kep' first watch, an' then Bud the next--and Mame, she
must sit up and keep watch with him. . . . 'Fore long they was
doin' it with their four eyes shut, being as tired as a greaser's
mule, and aleanin' agin a tree, wrop in each other's arms. . .
.</p>
<p>"I ain't ablamin' 'em any. . . . <i>They</i> paid--most,
anyhow. . . .</p>
<p>"When I wakes up, hearing Dago Jake's pleasin' smile, he'd got
'em covered with his gun, an' half-a-dozen of his gang
(blowed-in-glass-Bad-Men-from-Texas they was, too) had got me
covered also likewise.</p>
<p>"'<i>First on you as moves, and I let some daylight into the
dark innards o' that respectable young female as yore acuddlin',
Bud Conklin</i>,' says Jake. '<i>Git up and hands up</i>.'</p>
<p>"'<i>Do it smart, Buck</i>,' ses Bud, and we jumps up and puts
our hands up, right there. I guess Bud hoped as how Jake might
forgive the gal an' take her back--when he'd done with Bud. . .
.</p>
<p>"I'd hev reached for the hip-pocket o' me pants and pulled my
gun--for I allow that no moss don't grow on me when I start in to
deliver the goods with a gun--for all his bone-head bunch o'
shave-tails, but I allowed Jake would shoot the gal up, all
right; and that was where the outfit had got the bulge on us. . .
. Yep, it was Jake's night to howl. . . .</p>
<p>"And right here's where the picky-back eventuates, Sonny," he
added, addressing 'Erb.</p>
<p>"Yep. Mr. Fresh-Tough Coyote Dago Jake had thought out a neat
cinch--cool as ice--with his black heart boilin' and bubblin'
like pitch. . . . In about half no-time, me an' Bud was roped-up
with raw-hide lariats--me like a trussed fowl and Bud with his
hands only. They was bound fit to cut 'em off, but his legs was
free--and all the time Dago Jake covers the gal, and asks in his
dod-gasted greasy voice--like molasses gurglin' outer a bar'l
(no, I didn't like Jake's voice)--whether she'd hev her ears shot
off or be crippled fer life with a shot in each knee, if she
stirred an inch, or me an' Bud tried to move hand or foot. . . .
Yes, Sir, Jake fair gave me the fantods that bright an' shinin'
morn.</p>
<p>"Then, when they'd done tyin' me an' Bud like parcels, they
bound the gal to the tree what we'd been campin' under. They tied
her hands behind her; they tied her feet an' knees together; and
they tied her to that tree like windin' string round a
bat-handle. . . . And then they puts a halter round Bud's neck
an' ties the other end to a branch--<i>after settin' Bud up on my
shoulders, with his legs one each side of my head an' his feet
danglin' down on my chest. . . .</i> Yes, Sir. . . . And I
calc'lated that if I <i>co</i>-lapsed, Bud's feet would still
dangle--about a yard from the ground or a couple o' foot, when
the rope stretched and gave a bit, or the bough bent a little. .
. . And Mame stood face to face with us six feet away. . . ."</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The Bucking Bronco fell silent--and no member of the little
group of Legionaries broke the silence. I could see from their
faces that even Tant-de-Soif and Alphonse Blanc grasped the
situation--while from La Cigale, Dobroffski, and the Japanese,
scarcely a <i>nuance</i> of meaning was hid.</p>
<p>It was plain that John Bull, Reginald Rupert, and William
Jones visualized the scene more clearly, and felt its poignant
horror more fully than did 'Erb, ex-denizen of the foulest slums
of London.</p>
<p>"'<i>Streuth!</i>" 'Erb murmured at last, and scratched his
head.</p>
<p>"And then, '<i>I fear I must now leave you for a spell, ladies
an' gents</i>,'ses Dago Jake," continued the American, "after
he'd smacked his lips some, an' pointed out our cleverness and
beauty to the grinnin' outfit--'<i>but I'll look in a bit later
on</i>--<i>say this day week or so, an' pay my respex</i>'--and
the hull outfit rides off, laffin' fit to bust.</p>
<p>"And there was we-all--Bud hevin' as long to live as I could
stand up under his weight; an' me an' Mame with as long to live
as starvation 'ud let us.</p>
<p>"No, there wasn't no hope of nobody comin' along through them
prickly-pear flats. That didn't eventuate to happen once in a
month--apart from Dago Jake layin' hisself out to <i>see</i> that
it didn't happen till we-all had got what was acomin' to us.</p>
<p>"He c'd fix it to detain anybody what might come to Hackberry
Crossin' plannin' to follow the trail we'd took West--which was
as onlikely as celluloid apples in Hell--an' nobody never come
East along it, 'cos there was a better one.</p>
<p>"Nope--we'd chose that highly onpopulous thoroughfare
apurpose, travellin' modest an' onconspishus as before, an' the
more so for to avoid unpleasantness for Mame consevent upon
pursuit by Dago Jake.</p>
<p>"And there wouldn't be no Ranger patrol along neether. If any
come at all, it'd be along the trail we'd reckoned as Jake'd take
when he found we'd vamoosed durin' his temp'r'y indisposition of
whisky-jag. . . .</p>
<p>"<i>Gee</i>-whillikins! what wouldn't I have give fer that
same Ranger, that Bud an' I had held up an' dispoiled
contumelious, to happen along--even if it meant ten years striped
pyjamas in the County Pen or in St. Quentin with hard labour,
strait-jacket an' dungeons. I'd ha' fell upon his neck an' kissed
him frequent an' free. . . . Yep. . . . And <i>then</i> some." .
. .</p>
<p>The irrepressible 'Erb improved the occasion, as the big
American ceased and seemed to stare into the past.</p>
<p>"Ah!" he moralized, "if you'd bin alivin' of a <i>h</i>onest
life an' keepin' out o' trouble wi' the p'lice, you'd never 'a
come to trouble like <i>that. . . .</i> It was all along 'o yore
interferin' wi' the copper as wanted to see the receipt for them
'osses, that you come ter grief."</p>
<p>"An' that's where yore wrong <i>agin,</i> Sonny," replied the
Bucking Bronco with his big-dog-to-little-dog air of
forebearance. "Though I allow youse an authority on avoidin'
trouble with the perlice"--('Erb's presence in the Legion was
consequent upon his hurried leaving of his country for his
country's good)--"for it was entirely due to that same Ranger's
ferocious pussonal interest in me that I'm alive to-day. He'd
allowed he would trail me and Bud if it took the rest of his
misspent life--an' arrest us lone-handed. He was that mad!
Walkin' on foot without pant-suspenders <i>is</i> humiliatin' to
a sensitive nature what has jest bin relieved of its gun."</p>
<p>He fell silent again, and nobody spoke or stirred.</p>
<p>"We talked a bit, at first," he continued after a long pause,
"an' ole Bud Conklin showed his grit, cheering up Mame, an'
sayin' Dago Jake was only playin' a trick on us. But the gal
<i>knew</i> Dago Jake, an' soon she began to lose holt on
herself. . . . I ain't blamin' her any. . . . She loved Bud
Conklin, y'see. . . . She cried, and struggled, and screeched,
and I wished she'd stop--until she begun to laugh, and then I'd
rather she'd cried and screeched.</p>
<p>"And '<i>Come up, ol' hoss</i>,' says Bud to me, when fust I
staggered a bit--jest quiet like--jest like he'd said a thousand
times when a tired pony stumbled under him.</p>
<p>"And by-an'-by he leans down an' whispers, '<i>I'd kick free
of yer, pard, if it wan't for the gal</i>.'</p>
<p>"An' when I begins to tremble an' sway around, he leans down
agin and says very quiet, '<i>Hold up till the gal faints or
sleeps or su'think, Buck,</i>' he says. '<i>Hold up, ole pard. .
. . She'll go mad for life if I dances an' jerks afore her
eyes!</i>' . . . An' I know he weren't hevin' no daisy of a dandy
time up there--and that he'd have kicked clear long ago but for
the gal. . . .</p>
<p>"Faint? Sleep? Not she. . . . There she stood, face to face
with us--havin' highstericks a spell, then laffin' a spell, then
prayin' some. . . . Then croonin' over Bud Conklin like he was
her babby. . . . Whiles, she'd praise me fer standin' firm an'
savin' her man--an' there was a spell when the pore thing thought
I was God.</p>
<p>"One time, 'bout mid-day, Bud Conklin swore an' cursed at Dago
Jake till I fair blushed to hear him--an' then I waded in and
beat him holler at swearin', an' cursin' the name of Dago Jake. .
. . But <i>that</i> didn't cut no ice--nor cut our raw-hide
lariats neither.</p>
<p>"In all them story-books about Red Injuns an' Deadwood Dicks
an' such, the blue-eyed, golden-haired Hero <i>allus</i> busts
his bonds. He figgers to bust 'em on time; then to find a saddled
hoss standin' ready; likewise to pick up a new-loaded gun
<i>and</i> a square meal by the road-side, before gallopin' a
hundred miles to make a fuss o' the Villain and make a date with
the Hero<i>ine</i>--jest as that husky hoodlum's criminile
<i>ad</i>vances, drugs, stranglin's and starvin's is gettin'
irksome to the young female. . . .</p>
<p>"I guess Dago Jake an' his outfit wasn't the guys as had roped
up aforesaid Hero. . . . Nit. . . . But they <i>was</i> the guys
as had roped up us, an' we didn't bust no bonds. Nary a bust. And
once, towards evenin', I began to sway so bad that I half dropped
Bud, an' on'y got him straight on my shoulders agin, jest in time
. . . (an' I hear the screech that Mame let, <i>now,</i>
sometimes). '<i>Air you achokin' any, Bud?</i>' I ses. '<i>No,
pard,</i>' ses he, '<i>I ain't chokin' none, but you couldn't git
a cigarette-paper between my neck an' this derned lasso. I allow
nex' time will give little Willie a narsty cough an' a crick in
the neck.</i>'</p>
<p>"An' at the same time we notices that Mame was still an'
quiet, with her eyes shut. '<i>Now, Buck,</i>' ses Bud, '<i>fall
down an' roll clear. . . . Better she sees me dead than watch me
dyin'</i>.'</p>
<p>"'<i>Fall down, nawthen</i>,' says I. '<i>I'm agoin' to stand
right here till the Day o' Jedgement; an' then I allow I'll
donate Mister Tin-horn Dago Jake a tomato-eye</i>.' And right
then Mame opens her eyes an' smiles sweet, up at Bud.</p>
<p>"'<i>Hevn't we played this silly game long enuff, Buddy?'</i>
she says. '<i>I'm so tired. . . . Let's go git married, like we
planned</i>'--an' I heerd Bud cough. She shuts her eyes agin
then--an' very slow an' careful I turns right round so's not to
see her no more.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>"An' I stood still till it was dark. . . .</p>
<p>"So whether Mame died afore Bud or not--she didn't <i>see</i>
him die, an' that there fact has kep' me from goin' bug-house
like Cigale . . .</p>
<p>"<i>Her dead face an Bud's boot-soles fer a day or two! . .
.</i></p>
<p>"Yep. It were that Ranger as arrested us. A dead woman tied to
a tree, a dead man danglin' from it, an' a dead man lyin' just
below his feet--o'ny he wasn't quite dead.</p>
<p>"He was a White Man, that Ranger. He was hoppin' mad when he
figgers out what had happened, an' gives me rye-whisky, an' dopes
me to sleep, an' lets me lie there some.</p>
<p>"He was young an' innercent, an' when he'd donated me some
grub an' some more whisky, I talked to him eloquential. I
<i>did</i> wanta tell Dago Jake good-bye, before the Ranger hiked
me off to his Lieutenant, an' they rounded Jake an' his gang up.
The Ranger allowed it was Bud what had held him up and treated
him contumelious that day, an' thet as pore Bud had handed in his
checks, an' I'd nearly done likewise, he was agoin' to fergit me.
. . . He on'y wanted me as witness agin Dago Jake and Co., for
the murder of Mame an' Bud. . . .</p>
<p>"An' as we jogs along I talks to him some more, an' in the end
he lets me go to the adobe hut to tell Jake good-bye afore he
arrests him.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>"'Bout four oclock a.m. in the early morning it was, and Jake
sleepin' off a whisky-jag! . . . But he sobers up right slick
when I wakes him and he sees my pretty face. . . . He didn't even
reach for his gun--not that it was still there if he had. I allow
he thought I'd come from hell for him.</p>
<p>"<i>I had.</i></p>
<p>"Yep. I tells Dago Jake good-bye all-right--all-right. An'
without usin' no gun, nor knife, nor no other lethial weepon. I
takes my farewell o' that gentle Spani-<i>ard</i> with my bare
hands, and then I walks outer the shack a-singin'--</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"'Roll your tail an' roll it high,<br>
Fer you'll be an angel by-an-by,'</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-indent: 0em;">an' walkin' with a proud tail
accordin'.</p>
<p>"'How <i>is</i> Dago Jake?' ses the Ranger.</p>
<p>"'He <i>ain't</i>,' ses I. . . ."</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>As usual it was 'Erb who spoke first.</p>
<p>"I b'lieve you bin tellin' the <i>troof,</i> Buck," said he,
"an' that's disqualified in a bloomin' competition for 'oo can
tell the biggest lie. My performin' rabbit wins, bless 'is liddle
'eart! Come along to the canteen, and . . ."</p>
<p>"I know a performin' train wot's got yore performin' jack
rabbit skinned a mile," interrupted the American.</p>
<p>"Performin' <i>train?</i>" inquired 'Erb blankly.</p>
<p>"That's so," was the drawled reply. "You never seen such a
slick train in Yurrup nor Africky. . . . I was makin' a quick
get-away from that Ranger--an' he gallops on to the platform at
the deepôt as this U.P.R. double-express fast train glides outa
the station. I leans well over the side of the observation-car
and plants a kiss upon his bronzed an' manly cheek. . . . At
least, I <i>begun</i> the kiss there, but where did that kiss
<i>finish?</i></p>
<p>"On the southern end of an ole cow abrowsin' beside the track
<i>thirty-three miles down the line!</i> Some train, and some
travellin' that! . . . You an' yore performin' rabbit! You make
me tired."</p>
<p>"'Streuth!" murmured 'Erb again, and scratched his cropped
head, as was his custom when endeavouring to grapple with
mysteries beyond his ken.</p>

<p>The three brothers sat in a solemn row upon Beau Geste's bed
by the window in their barrack room, enjoying the blessed peace
of a Sabbath afternoon.</p>
<p>John Geste yawned cavernously, and the pot-shot made by his
brother Digby, with a small piece of soap, was entirely
satisfactory--to Digby.</p>
<p>"The child seems bored," observed Beau Geste; "he must do more
Arabic. Yes," he continued, "and I think I must institute a
course of ethnological studies, too."</p>
<p>"Oh, splendid," agreed Digby, "I shall love that. What is
it?"</p>
<p>"What I mean," continued Beau, "is that it would be rather
interesting to see how many different nationalities we can
discover in the Legion; how many different trades, professions,
and callings, and--"</p>
<p>"And all that," said John, having completed another yawn.</p>
<p>"How is Beau like Satan?" asked Digby.</p>
<p>"How's he <i>un</i>like him?" interrupted John, ere Digby
answered his own question with the statement:</p>
<p>"Because he'll find some mischief still for idle coves to do.
They'll make him a sergeant, if he's not careful."</p>
<p>"Why mischief?" asked John. "Ethnology isn't mischief, is
it?"</p>
<p>"It would be, my lad, if it took the form of going about
asking personal questions of <i>les légionnaires.</i> They'd
<i>do</i> you a mischief, too," was the reply.</p>
<p>"That's just the point," observed Beau. "No questions to be
asked at all. See who can get the finest collection of
nationalities, professions, home-towns and all that, without
asking anybody <i>anything.</i> No vulgar curiosity. . . . All
diplomacy, suggestion, induction, deduction . . ."</p>
<p>"Then production," murmured Digby.</p>
<p>"Quite so, my dear Watson. The one that gets the biggest bag,
to give the other two a present. Splendid idea. Keep your young
minds active. Train the faculty of observation."</p>
<p>"When do we compare notes?" asked John,</p>
<p>"When I think I've got the biggest list," replied Beau.</p>
<p>"And what if the same feller appears in more than one list?"
inquired John.</p>
<p>"Cancel him out, or toss for him, or find who discovered him
first, fathead."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid the idea's too late to save <i>you,</i> John,"
observed Digby--"mind dead already."</p>
<p>One evening a month later, the three brothers, sitting in a
row as was their wont, with their elder and leader in the centre,
adorned a broad, low divan in Mustapha's café.</p>
<p>"Well, pups, how's ethnology going?" inquired Beau, as he put
his clay coffee-cup on the floor beside him.</p>
<p>"Fine," said Digby. "I'm a great man with a great mind. A
diplomatist is lost in me."</p>
<p>"<i>Is</i> he?" inquired Beau, in some concern. "Let's get him
out."</p>
<p>"No; you don't understand, Beau," observed John. "He means he
<i>is</i> a diplomatist. He's right, too. Nobody but a clever
diplomatist could hide the fact that he <i>is</i> a diplomatist
so well as Digby does."</p>
<p>"Anyhow, I bet I win," said Digby triumphantly. "All
authentic, too."</p>
<p>"Then you'll give us each a present," pointed out John. "Shall
I choose a fiddle, or a free excursion-ticket, single,
to--to--Brandon Abbas? Read out yours."</p>
<p>"No, we'll declare ourselves in order of merit," interposed
Beau. "I've got a grocer, Bingen; a shipping-clerk, Barcelona; an
officer of the Imperial Guard, St. Petersburg; a valet, Paris; a
surgeon, Vienna; a commercial traveller, Hamburg; a vendor of
unpostable post-cards, valued and respected citizen of
Marseilles; a stevedore, Lisbon; a street-corner fried-bean
merchant, Sofia; a teacher of languages, Warsaw; a fig-packer,
Smyrna; a perfectly good, nice-mannered, bloody-minded brigand,
Bastilica--"</p>
<p>"There isn't any such place," interrupted Digby. "Where is
it?"</p>
<p>"Nothing to be ashamed of in honest ignorance, my lad. It's
right in the middle of Corsica, fifty miles from
Ajaccio--according to the brigand," replied Beau.</p>
<p>"Isn't that where Napoleon Bonaparte was born?" inquired
John.</p>
<p>"Bastilica?" replied Digby. "Why, of course; I remember the
place quite well now."</p>
<p>"A restaurateur from Ancona; a rock-scorpion from Gibraltar; a
Japanese barber from Yokohama--he speaks English with an American
accent, he understands Russian, I know, and I'll bet you he could
not only drill a battalion but handle a brigade or a
division."</p>
<p>"Oh, you mean that chap Yato," interrupted Digby. "I've got
him. He's a wonderful tattooer, too. He's going to do portraits
of you two on my back, so that I can't see them."</p>
<p>"Will he, too, tattoo, two, to . . ." murmured John
sleepily.</p>
<p>"Cancel him out, then," said Beau.</p>
<p>"I've also got a Portuguese cove from Loanda. That's in
Angola, Portuguese West Africa."</p>
<p>"Well, we know that, don't we?" complained Digby.</p>
<p>"No," answered Beau and continued: "A Swedish sailor from
Göttenburg, and two frightful asses from Brandon Abbas."</p>
<p>"Rotten list," commented Digby; "barely a score."</p>
<p>"Well, how many have <i>you</i> got?" asked his brother.</p>
<p>"Oh, in round numbers, about a hundred."</p>
<p>"<i>Round</i> numbers? All round the truth, I suppose?"</p>
<p>"Well, listen and don't be jealous," answered Digby, producing
a paper. "I've got a Russian banker from Odessa; an Italian
opera-singer; a Dutch bargee; an Austrian count--or dis-count,
perhaps; a Munich brewer's drayman; a Spanish fisherman; a
Goanese steward; a Danish farm-boy; a beastly, bounderish,
bumptious, Byzantine blackguard; a French actor; a schoolmaster
from Avignon; a gambling-hell keeper from Punta Arenas--wherever
that may be; a bank-clerk from Rome; a lottery-ticket seller from
Havana; a hybrid Callao <i>maquereau;</i> another cosmopolitan
gent from Sfax, who, on being asked his trade, always says,
'<i>Je faisais la mouche</i>'--"</p>
<p>"But no questions were to be allowed," interposed Beau.</p>
<p>"I didn't ask any, clever; I overheard, see? . . . A Dutch
Colonial soldier, a Bowery tough; a Dresden--"</p>
<p>"Shepherdess," murmured John.</p>
<p>"Wrong again," said Digby--"street-scavenger; a Finnish--"</p>
<p>"Time we got to the finish," murmured John again.</p>
<p>"Bloater-paster, or salmon-smoker--"</p>
<p>"Funny stuff to smoke," commented Beau, "but probably better
than this French <i>caporal</i> tobacco."</p>
<p>"A colonel of Don Cossacks."</p>
<p>"From Donnybrook?" inquired John.</p>
<p>"Yes, and Donegal--or perhaps Oxford," replied Beau.</p>
<p>"A bootblack from Athens; a poor <i>fellah</i> from Egypt; a
boatman from Beirut; and two frightful asses from Brandon Abbas.
. . . Oh, and a lot I haven't written down. Tinker, tailor,
soldier, sailor, rich man, poor man, beggarman, thief; painter,
pander, pedlar, parasite, printer, professor, prize-fighter,
<i>procureur,</i> prefect, priest, pro-consul, prince,
prophet-in-his-own-country. . . . Oh, lots. Get you all the names
and addresses by and by."</p>
<p>"What have you got, John?" inquired Beau, turning as with
bored distaste from the loquacity of his twin.</p>
<p>"I've got another Jones," replied John, alluding to Digby's
<i>nom de guerre</i> of Thomas Jones.</p>
<p>"What <i>is</i> a Jone, by the way?" inquired Digby. "I ought
to know, as I am some."</p>
<p>"Dunno. Anyhow, this is the only other Jones," replied John.
"He's an Englishman--public-school, Oxford, and all that. Indian
Army, too, poor beggar. In a rotten state, living on his nerves.
Sensitive sort of chap. Shoot himself one of these days. This is
about the last place in the world for a man like him."</p>
<p>"Sounds as though it <i>will</i> be the last place in the
world for him," observed Digby. "Let's get hold of him and shed
the light of our countenances upon him, thus brightening his dark
places. Does he seem to be a criminal, like Beau?"</p>
<p>"No, nor a moral wreck like you."</p>
<p>"Moral wreck!" commented Digby. "Better than being an
<i>im</i>moral wreck anyhow." And his look was accusatory.</p>
<p>"Neither criminal nor moral wreck," continued John. "Simply a
gentleman, like me."</p>
<p>"Oh, a gentleman like you, is he?" remarked Beau. "Then I
don't think we'll associate with him."</p>
<p>"Yes, we will. I'm bringing him here to-morrow night, to meet
you two. He's simply longing to talk English to people of his own
kind. And I'll tell you something else. Unlike most people here,
he wants to talk about himself, too. He's in a queer state of
nerves--neurotic."</p>
<p>"Poor chap, we must see what we can do for him," agreed Beau;
and Digby nodded.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A lean haggard man, his sensitive young face a mask of misery,
old and lined, haunted and hopeless, arrived with John the
following evening at Mustapha's café. That he was in a terribly
nervous condition was all too evident--a reserved and reticent
gentleman, devil-driven to be garrulous, talking the harder the
more he was ashamed of talking. He seemed literally dying to
express himself, to make a clean breast of something terrible,
something that still stung and scorched and branded him.</p>
<p>His story, told in a swift rush and a curious metallic voice,
without break or hesitation, greatly interested the sympathetic,
silent brothers. It interested them yet more, next day, when they
learned that, for some reason not divulged, he had shot himself
during the night.</p>
<p>Five minutes after his introduction by John to Beau and Digby,
he told them that his meeting with them was a godsend, for there
was something he <i>must</i> get off his mind.</p>
<p>And a pitiful thing it was, to the listeners, prepared as they
were to hear a dark story of vice, crime, ruin and downfall. . .
. Pitiful, pathetic, tragic and ridiculous, like a torrent in
spate, the absurd story came.</p>
<p>"Looking back and considering the affair again in all its
bearings," he said, "I am still of opinion that I did my painful
duty and nothing more; that I acted as a man of conscience should
do, and that I have nothing whatever wherewith to reproach
myself.</p>
<p>"Only the fool or the moral coward says, 'Am I my brother's
keeper?' For what had my dear mother trained me, and my dear
father in God developed my sense of responsibility to my
neighbour and myself, but that I should act precisely as I did in
that affair?</p>
<p>"I suppose it is the Devil himself who is the <i>fons et</i>
<i>origo</i> of those foolish, unworthy and sinful doubts that do
sometimes try to raise their poisonous heads in my disordered
mind when I look back upon the little incident.</p>
<p>"However, I will tell the exact truth as to what I thought and
said and did; and you shall judge as to whether any high-minded,
conscientious and morally courageous person could have done
otherwise than I did.</p>
<p>"I was brought up by the best mother a man ever had, a human
saint, and by a priest whose chief regret, I think, was that
burning at the stake has become unpopular. No, he didn't want to
burn anybody; he wanted to <i>be</i> burnt--for his faith. He
sought a martyr's crown and found a comfortable living, much
honour and preferment. Finding also that honour is not without
profit save in its own country, he determined to go abroad and
find profit to his soul among the heathen--and possibly the
martyr's crown beneath the solar topi--it would look odd on top
of one.</p>
<p>"And I went to India to join the Indian regiment into which I
was exchanging, by the same boat that took him to join the holy
army of martyrs, if he could contrive it. It was a great joy to
my mother that I was to travel with the good man and not be left
to stray alone into the detrimental atmosphere of Gibraltar,
Malta, Port Said, Aden, Bombay or other such colourful, and
therefore wicked, places.</p>
<p>"And on that accursed boat I saw my new colonel's young wife
kiss another man. I saw him with his arms about her waist. I saw
him go into her cabin, when the colonel lay snoring in a
<i>chaise longue</i> upon the deck.</p>
<p>"When I heard them <i>plotting together to go off,</i> at Port
Said, on Christmas Day, my terrible struggle with my conscience
was ended. My conscience had won, and I knew I must tell the
colonel the horrible truth, however agonizingly distasteful and
obnoxious this hateful duty might be. Yes, I was a Young Man with
a Conscience. . . . But let me tell the facts in sequence as they
occurred.</p>
<p>"My new colonel (of the regiment to which I was going),
returning from leave and his honeymoon trip, was a grey, stern
man; a typical dour Scot, very unapproachable, and the last man
in the World with whom one would attempt to jest or trifle.</p>
<p>"His bride was a beautiful young girl who might well have been
his daughter--as merry, frivolous and gay as Colonel Gordon-Watts
was sober, hard and dour. Opposites attract--and it was plain
that he worshipped her.</p>
<p>"I admired her greatly, and she was very kind to me on the one
or two occasions on which I spoke to her. Sometimes I felt I
would rather be promenading with her, sitting beside her
deck-chair or playing deck-quoits and bull-board with her than
eternally walking and talking with my good and kind mentor.</p>
<p>"But I was far too much his spiritual child, his acolyte and
disciple, to think of breaking away from his control. You see he
had educated me from childhood until I went to Oxford, and he had
settled there, with those admirable Fathers irreverently known to
undergraduate youth as the Cowley Dads, and continued to exercise
his powerful influence upon my character. I was with him daily
and much of every day, and, as you hear, even now that I was in
the army--with a university commission, as my mother would never
hear of my going to Sandhurst--and <i>was</i> going abroad into
the wide and wicked world, he was with me still. Yes, I was a
Young Man with a Conscience.</p>
<p>"No, I did not make any attempt to desert my mentor and
cabin-companion in order to bask in the society of the colonel's
wife; but while my ear listened to my spiritual father and my
tongue replied to him, my eye undoubtedly followed her.</p>
<p>"Nothing happened until we reached Marseilles and the overland
passengers came on board. When I went on the promenade deck that
evening, one of them already sat beside her, and I was very sorry
to see her accept a cigarette from him and smoke it. He was, like
herself, young, and again like herself and most unlike the
colonel, merry, frivolous and gay.</p>
<p>"They had evidently made friends very quickly and they were
always together. Certainly they made a splendidly matched couple,
and certainly she seemed far more merry and bright in his company
than in that of her husband."</p>
<p>"<i>How</i> they laughed together!</p>
<p>"And the colonel seemed content. He would sit in the
writing-room scribbling away, all the morning, at some military
text-book or other that he was compiling; sleep all the
afternoon; scribble again in the evening; walk violently round
and round the deck, for exercise, before dinner, and go to bed
quite early. I confess that I envied the handsome, laughing youth
and that I often longed to talk to someone other than my
spiritual father--someone like this merry, frivolous girl, for
example.</p>
<p>"And on the second day out from Marseilles I received a
terrible shock.</p>
<p>"Coming suddenly round the corner from the music-saloon, I
almost ran into her deck-chair as she withdrew her hand from that
of her new companion with the words:</p>
<p>"'You are a darling, Bobby; you shall have a hug for
that'--and, as I dodged the foot-rest of her chair, her eye met
mine, even as she spoke. Did she look confused, uncomfortable,
guilty? Not she! Her gaze was utterly untroubled, and it was
evidently nothing to <i>her</i> that I must have heard every word
she said.</p>
<p>"Perfectly shameless!</p>
<p>"And as for <i>him</i>--he had the effrontery to murmur quite
distinctly, 'Hold up, old hoss!' as I stumbled and blundered
past.</p>
<p>"Of the three, it was certainly I who would have struck an
observant onlooker as the guilty one, as I flushed to the roots
of my hair and hurried away, not knowing where to look.</p>
<p>"<i>Think of it!</i> Married a month, and the man had not been
on the boat three days! I trembled from head to foot, and went
straight to my cabin, feeling shocked to the point of physical
sickness.</p>
<p>"Should I tell Father Staunton?</p>
<p>"Ought not I to tell her husband? Was not I an accessory after
the fact, almost an accomplice, practically compounding a felony,
if I stood by and said nothing? Was I my brother's keeper? I knew
I was. I knew it was my duty to save the Colonel from shame; to
save this woman from ruining her life; to save this young man
'Bobby' from himself.</p>
<p>"But I knew I was not brave enough to do it. And the devil
tempted me with whisperings of '<i>Most un-gentlemanly of you to
tell tales of a lady!' 'Gross impertinence!'</i> '<i>Colonel
Gordon-Watts will refuse to believe you, but not to kick you
downstairs.'</i> '<i>Mind your own business, you young fool,'</i>
and even: '<i>Make love to her yourself, since she's of such an
oncoming disposition'--</i>whereat I jumped with horror and told
myself I would do my painful, dreadful duty.</p>
<p>"That evening, while Father Staunton was undressing in the
cabin, I went on deck. It was a glorious moonlight night. As four
bells rang and the lascar look-out replied with his sing-song cry
of <i>'Ham dekhta hai'</i> to show that he was awake and
watchful, I was moved with an idle inclination to go right up
into the bows and watch the phosphorescence as the knife-like
stem churned up the sleeping waters.</p>
<p>"I ran down the companion, crossed the well-deck, and climbed
the iron ladder to the fo'c'sle.</p>
<p>"<i>He</i> and <i>she</i> were there, leaning on the
bulwarks--and his arm was around her waist!</p>
<p>"Going up on deck early next morning, I saw them meet--<i>and
kiss!</i> During that day, as on previous days, the young man
(his name was Mornay, by the way) cultivated the society of other
young women a good deal, presumably as a blind. But, as I sat
reading in the lounge before dinner, Mornay and Mrs. Gordon-Watts
came and sat down close behind me, and they made their
arrangements for going off together, on Christmas Day, at Port
Said!</p>
<p>"They spoke with shameless openness and lack of decency; and I
distinctly heard Mornay say: 'Slip away while he's writing,
then,' and a few minutes later: 'Bring <i>all</i> the cash you
can scrape together, mind! You'll want it at . . . and I am
nearly broke. I can't keep--' and her reply, with a heartless
giggle: 'Suppose he comes after us!'</p>
<p>"I sprang up, and leaning over, said: 'Pardon--I am hearing
much of what you say, and I shall--'</p>
<p>"With brazen effrontery, Mornay interrupted with, 'Right-o,
old thing! Sorry if our artless prattle disturbed you,' while
Mrs. Gordon-Watts stared at me as though she thought me
eccentric.</p>
<p>"I rushed to my cabin.</p>
<p>"How shall I tell of the agonies of indecision, cowardice and
self-contempt that I suffered, as I wrestled with my conscience
once more. I <i>ought</i> to stop this thing. It was my bounden
duty to warn the Colonel. Was I my brother's keeper? And so on,
<i>ad nauseam.</i></p>
<p>"And a thing which somehow, and strangely, seemed to make it
all worse, if that were possible, was the fact that she was not
the only woman that he pursued. He was a perfect Don Juan and
made up to every pretty girl and woman on board, married or
single.</p>
<p>"'An arrant flirt,' thought I, 'a lady-killer; a heartless,
conscienceless scoundrel.' And yet I could not deny that he was
popular with all on board. He was in the greatest demand, always
and everywhere--in fact, 'the life and soul of the ship,' as Mrs.
Gordon-Watts truly said.</p>
<p>"And while I sat on my berth, and suffered, Father Staunton
entered and I laid the matter before him. I weakly suggested that
he, a priest, was the fitter person to intervene.</p>
<p>"'No, my son,' said he, 'I go to no man with a tale about a
tale. . . . And I shall leave it to your own conscience. Do what
you think right, but be no self-deceiver. Be very sure of your
motive before you act or decide not to act.'</p>
<p>"And I read this to mean, 'Do not stand by and see this happen
because you are a coward while you pretend it is because you are
not a busybody. . . . Do not shirk your duty because you have
told yourself that this is not your business and that you have no
duty in the matter at all!'</p>
<p>"I had no sleep that Christmas Eve. I tossed from side to
side, a prey to doubt, fear, self-contempt and indecision. I was
stretched upon the rack of my Conscience.</p>
<p>"But in the morning, the glorious Christmas morning, I arose,
calm and decided, and dressed as one dresses who goes to
execution. Conscience had triumphed and I was going to do the
right thing at any cost to myself--and the right thing in this
case was, believe me, a loathsomely distasteful thing for me to
do. I would go through with it, however--and I would do it openly
and fairly, sparing myself nothing. I would tell Colonel
Gordon-Watts, in the presence of his wife and her lover.</p>
<p>"There would be no backbiting, no 'tale about a tale,' no
hole-and-corner sneaking about <i>that.</i></p>
<p>"As the passengers trooped up from breakfast, I followed the
Colonel, with whom were his wife and Mornay, on to the deck; and
with beating heart and dry mouth, I went up to him and said:</p>
<p>"'May I have a word with you, sir, on a matter of the most
urgent and vital importance--and may Mrs. Gordon-Watts and Mr.
Mornay be present?'</p>
<p>"The Colonel stared, looking more like a cold volcano than
ever.</p>
<p>"'What the dev--' he began, and I could feel my knees turning
to tape and my heart to water, as Mornay interrupted with:</p>
<p>"'If it's to form a syndicate for a bet on the day's-run
sweepstake, on the strength of a tip from the engine-room, let us
congeal ourselves and hist.'</p>
<p>"Mrs. Gordon-Watts giggled. If Mornay and she guessed at my
business with the Colonel, they acted cleverly, I thought. There
was no trace of guilty confusion. No; they did not <i>dream</i>
of what was coming.</p>
<p>"'Well? Out with it,' growled the Colonel.</p>
<p>"He had vile manners, as I had already discovered in my brief
and rare encounters with him on board.</p>
<p>"'It would be better for all concerned, if we were alone--we
four, I mean,' said I.</p>
<p>"'Let's go up on the bridge and ask the captain to clear out
for a while,' suggested Mornay. 'He won't mind.'</p>
<p>"The lady laughed again.</p>
<p>"'I am very much in earnest, sir,' continued I to the Colonel,
ignoring Mornay.</p>
<p>"He saw from my manner, and probably from my appearance, that
I certainly was very much in earnest.</p>
<p>"'Come in here,' he said, indicating the empty smoking-room.
All the passengers were crowding forward on the starboard side of
the deck, to watch Port Said rising out of the sea.</p>
<p>"Sir,' said I, 'it is my unspeakably painful duty to tell you,
before this man, Mornay, that I have seen him <i>embrace and kiss
your wife,</i> have heard him address her in terms of intimacy
and endearment, and have heard him <i>arranging to go off with
her</i>--and with what money she could secure--at Port Said. I
have said it and done my duty. My conscience is clear. . . .'</p>
<p>"The Colonel's eyes blazed. His wife and Mornay stared at me
open-mouthed. Thus we hung for seconds that seemed like years,
without sound or movement--till suddenly Mornay threw himself
down upon the couch behind him and buried his face in a cushion;
the Colonel raised a hand--not to strike, but to cover his poor
twitching mouth; and Mrs. Gordon-Watts burst into wild hysterical
screams of distraught laughter.</p>
<p>"And <i>I</i> had made this ruin!</p>
<p>"But <i>I</i> had obeyed my Conscience. . . .</p>
<p>"And <i>then</i>--and <i>then</i>--the Husband turned, first
to the Wife, and then to the Other Man, and said:</p>
<p>"'Is this thing true? If so, you are not to waste more than
ten pounds in the shops, Lilian. And if you, Bobby, have been
kissing your <i>own</i> sister for a change, it's a change in the
right direction!'"</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">II</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I say," said Digby as he entered the Barrack Room, a few days
later, and strode across to where Michael and John, sitting on
the latter's bed, industriously waxed and polished belts, straps
and pouches. "Did you see the draft that came in this afternoon
from Colomb Bechar or somewhere?"</p>
<p>"No," replied Michael. "Why?"</p>
<p>"Well, they've got about the ugliest lad I've ever seen, among
them. . . . <i>Awful</i> face."</p>
<p>"Worse than John's?" asked Michael.</p>
<p>"Well, you can't very well compare them," replied Digby.
"John's ugliness is what you might call natural. He was born like
it. This other fellow's is artificial. Been made like it."</p>
<p>"Got an artificial face, has he?" inquired John.</p>
<p>"Not exactly that either," replied Digby, pushing John off his
bed, and seating himself by Michael. "It's the ugliness that's
artificial. It's as though I didn't like your face--which I
don't, of course--and set to work with cold steel and red-hot
iron to improve it, or at any rate to change it."</p>
<p>"Wouldn't <i>any</i> change be an improvement?" asked Michael,
looking up from the pouch that he was polishing.</p>
<p>"Well, I gather it wasn't so in this man's case," replied
Digby. "His <i>escouade</i> seemed quite proud of his face, and
one of them was telling me about it. He's an Englishman. It seems
he got a poisoned foot and couldn't get his boot on. He fell
behind, as they were doing a forced march to relieve a threatened
post, and couldn't stop for anything or anybody. They hadn't even
any mule or camel <i>cacolets</i> for the sick and wounded. He
kept going, with the utmost pluck and endurance, sometimes
hopping, sometimes using his reversed rifle as a crutch, and at
last going on all fours . . . When he completely collapsed and
couldn't even roll, the tribesmen who had been watching the
Company and stalking this straggler, came down like a wolf on the
fold and gathered him in--not without loss to themselves as they
rushed him from all points of the compass.</p>
<p>"Well, it seems they were so annoyed with him, for shooting
frequent and free, that they had a bit of fun with him, then and
there, before taking him up to the <i>kasbah</i> or caves, or
whatever it was, in order to let the ladies torture him
properly.</p>
<p>"Apparently they slit his cheeks perpendicularly and threaded
twigs through the latticework, so to speak, and did something
similar with his forehead. An argument then arose as to whether
the girls would mind if he were handed over to them without ears,
nose, lips and eyelids. Some murmured '<i>Place aux dames,</i>'
while others said, 'There will be plenty of him left for
them.'</p>
<p>"Like the sensible fellers they are, they compounded and
compromised and split the difference and said they'd just have
his ears for luck, and for something to send in to the Commandant
of the nearest Fort, on his birthday, or for Christmas or
something.</p>
<p>"Well, one nasty man had just grabbed this chap's right ear,
and had just begun to cut with a rather blunt knife, when round
the corner came a policeman, and the boys had to run for it. In
other words, along came a half-troop of Spahis who were following
the Company.</p>
<p>"I gather that the Spahis were divided in their minds as to
whether it would be kinder to shoot him, or to save him up, when
the <i>vile corpus</i> or vile body sat up and said that if
anybody shot him, he'd punch him on the nose. He said this in
English, a language understanded of the <i>sous-lieutenant</i> of
the Spahis, so they pulled most of the brushwood out of the
latticework which was his face, tied his ear on with string,
mopped him up a bit, and put him up behind a trooper."</p>
<p>"Poor devil," murmured John. "He must be a stout lad."</p>
<p>"Yes, let's go and call on him," suggested Michael. "He might
like to have a jibber with fellow-countrymen."</p>
<p>"We will," agreed Digby. "Better look him up tomorrow, as he
may be among those of the draft who are being sent to Arzew to
recuperate."</p>
<p>"Where's that?" inquired John.</p>
<p>"You're an ignorant lad," replied Digby. "It's a health
resort, on the coast, about one hundred miles west of Oran.
Didn't you even know that much? I learnt it this afternoon."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The brothers found <i>le légionnaire</i> Robinson to be a
pleasant English gentleman with a most unpleasant face, hideously
scarred, and rather terrible to behold. It was obvious that he
was still most painfully self-conscious.</p>
<p>As the four chatted, Robinson sat with his hand across his
face, as does a weak-eyed person in a strong light. Although it
was easy to see that the poor fellow was very uncomfortable among
strangers, the tact, charm, sympathy and <i>savoir faire</i> of
the three Gestes won upon him, and put him at his ease. Before
long he was laughing and telling them the story of his ghastly
experience.</p>
<p>"I suppose I'm a <i>légionnaire</i> for life," he smiled wryly
and whimsically, "now that my face is my misfortune . . . This
home of the Soldiers of Misfortune is the best place for it . . .
the only place. Can't go about scaring women and children . . .
Might get a job at a sort of Barnum's Show, I suppose.</p>
<p>"Rather hard luck," he added. "I had only four months more to
serve. . . ."</p>
<p>"Rough luck," murmured Michael, "but look here, you know . . .
I think you make too much of it. . . . What I mean to say is . .
. it'll get a great deal better in course of time . . . scars do,
you know, and these are very recent. . . . And then these great
surgeons can do most marvellous things."</p>
<p>"Why, yes," agreed John. "It's astonishing what they can do in
the way of grafting new flesh, and that sort of thing. I knew of
a man whose nose was most hideously smashed . . . flat with his
face . . . bone all gone--and they built him up a perfectly good
nose."</p>
<p>"Sort of thing he took off at night with his wig and false
teeth?" inquired Robinson grimly. "I shouldn't care to wear a
mask."</p>
<p>"Nothing of the sort," objected John. "This fellow's nose was
not detachable. It was built up under its own skin, so to speak.
I believe they inject molten paraffin wax, and mould it to the
required shape as it cools--something of that sort."</p>
<p>"Yes," added Digby. "I distinctly remember reading of a great
Viennese surgeon who practically rebuilt the shattered face of a
man whose gun burst as he was firing it. According to the account
they even made him a new jawbone, and grafted on to it skin which
they took from his leg. There was a portrait of him, and he
looked perfectly normal, quite good-looking.</p>
<p>"Why not take your discharge, and go to the best surgeon in
the world? Costly job, I suppose, but if a loan . . . we should
be . . ."</p>
<p>"Oh, I've plenty of money <i>now,</i> thanks," replied
Robinson. "Reminds one of the Spanish proverb, '<i>God gives nuts
to him who has no teeth.</i>' I hadn't a bean in the world.
Partly why I came to the Legion. . . . But the day I came out of
hospital--and had a good look at my face--I got a letter from
home. Plenty of money, <i>now.</i>"</p>
<p>"Well, that's all right then," observed Michael, "and you can
spend some of it to good purpose."</p>
<p>"My dear chap, it's hopeless. You know it is. It's most kind
of you to be consoling and encouraging, and all that, but the
damage is done, and it's irreparable. If the marvellous surgeon
had been on the spot, I've no doubt he could have done something
and made, at any rate, a tidier job of it than Nature and my
comrades' dirty paws did. It's far too late now, and I'll spend
the rest of my young life where nothing matters--thanks all the
same."</p>
<p>"Well, anyhow," replied Michael Geste, "you see if I'm not
right. Things will improve enormously in time. The scars will
lose all colour and cease to be livid. They will become mere
seams and lines . . . hardly noticeable."</p>
<p>"That would be a pity in a way, too," smiled Robinson. "My
<i>escouade</i> would be disappointed. They would miss my face.
Perhaps some sniper won't--if I can get on active service
again."</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 2</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Where's Beau?" inquired Digby one afternoon, a couple of
months later, as he joined John at the trough in the
<i>lavabo</i> where they washed their white uniforms.</p>
<p>"Dunno," replied John, "but he'll be in for evening
<i>soupe</i> all right. Why?"</p>
<p>"A job, my little lad! . . . <i>A geste . . .</i> a deed . . .
a do. . . . You know that dear fellow, Klingen. He was telling
his gang an extraordinary yarn while we were peeling potatoes
this morning. . . . Reminded me of that lass who chased the
Crusader home."</p>
<p>"What lass was that?" inquired John.</p>
<p>"D'you mean to say you don't know <i>that,</i> you uneducated
worm . . . you worm that dieth not. No, that was a sharp-headed
worm, wasn't it? Nothing sharp-headed about you, John Geste."</p>
<p>"We were talking about a girl," interrupted John coldly. "Who
was she?"</p>
<p>"How the devil should I know?" replied Digby. "It's you who
ought to know useful things of this sort, so that you can be
helpful to Beau and me."</p>
<p>"You don't mean Mrs. à Becket by any chance, do you?"</p>
<p>"That's it, my lad," said Digby, smiting his brother with his
wet tunic. "Why couldn't you have said that at once, without all
this jibber. Thomas à Becket went to the Crusades and there
picked up with a Saracen lassie."</p>
<p>"But I thought he was a turbulent priest, and a perfectly good
Archbishop of Canterbury," observed John. "I think it was T. à
Becket Senior. Old Mr. Gilbert."</p>
<p>"No, no," replied Digby. "It was Tom Cantuar all right, and
all this happened when he was young and merry and bright, before
he had found grace. . . ."</p>
<p>"<i>Was</i> her name Grace?" asked John. "I thought it was
Zuleika or Zenobia or Aggie."</p>
<p>"Will you shut up and listen, and improve your mind!"
admonished Digby. "He took up with this young woman, and they
were walking out . . . keeping company . . . <i>you</i> know . .
. when T. à Becket's time expired, or else he was due for leave
and furlough, and in the hurry of packing his kit and getting his
papers signed and proving to the Quartermaster that he was a liar
. . ."</p>
<p>"<i>He</i> was--or the Quartermaster was?" asked John.</p>
<p>". . . he quite forgot, or else mislaid, Grace or Zuleika or
Zenobia or Aggie--and in any case he couldn't have taken her
aboard the transport as she wasn't married to him 'on the
strength.' Well, there it was. T. à Becket safe in England and
poor Grace walking up and down the Pier or the beach at Acre or
Joppa or Jaffa or Haifa weeping and wailing. . . ."</p>
<p>"Whaling?" queried John. "From a pier or a beach?"</p>
<p>". . . and Grace's Pa making kind inquiries for T. à Becket
with a thick stick."</p>
<p>"How <i>do</i> you inquire with a stick?" asked John.</p>
<p>"I'll show you in a minute," promised Digby, and
continued:</p>
<p>". . . When Grace found that Thomas had done a bunk--and she
having nearly filled the bottom drawer and all--two of everything
and all hand-stitched--she up and had an idea. Drawing her
savings from the Post Office, she left Pa and Ma to scratch for
themselves; she went down to the shipping office and just said
'Single, London,' and went straight aboard a perfectly good
fifteen-ton lugger or yawl or scow or junk or barge or battleship
and 'proceeded' to London, which she knew to be Thomas's
home-town, as she had seen it on his washing.</p>
<p>"Safely arrived, she took a room in a perfectly respectable
boarding-house in Bloomsbury, patronized entirely by clergymen's
daughters, had an egg to her tea, and then went out to look for
Thomas. . . .</p>
<p>"Now the artful dog, Thomas, had never given her his proper
name and address, and she only knew him as Thomas, Tommy and Tom,
and there were quite a lot of gents so named in London Town.
However, she worked clean through the London Directory and the
Bars and Night-clubs of the Shaftesbury Avenue district, and in
the end, probably the West End, she met her own True Thomas, who
promptly said he was just having a last drink before setting out
to look for her, having been engaged hitherto in getting a home
together. Whereupon they married and were happy ever after. . . .
She was housekeeper at the Palace when he settled in at
Canterbury as Archbishop, because you know how people talk and
all that, when celibate clergymen . . ."</p>
<p>"But my poor dear excellent ass," interrupted John, "what's
all this got to do with the unspeakable Klingen and the deed we
have to do?"</p>
<p>"Nothing, probably," replied Digby, "and then again, you never
know. As I was saying when you interrupted, he was telling his
gang an extraordinary yarn while we were peeling potatoes this
morning.</p>
<p>"It appears that, last night, as he was strolling down the Rue
de Tlemçen, a beauteous maiden stopped him and asked him if he
was English. I gathered that he behaved precisely as Klingen
would behave in the circumstances, and that she cleared off with
her chin in the air, followed by Klingen with his mind in the
gutter--until she went into the <i>Hôtel de l'Europe</i> and
thither he could not follow her. Then up spake a lad whose name I
don't know, and said he'd had a similar experience. A pretty girl
had stopped him near the hotel, and, with blushing apologies,
asked him if he were English. Apparently this chap behaved like
an ordinary decent person--said he was sorry but he wasn't
English. The girl then explained that she wanted to find an
English <i>légionnaire.</i> Her idea seemed to be that her best
plan was to find <i>any</i> Englishman, as he would be more
likely to know <i>the</i> Englishman."</p>
<p>"Of course, the chap she wants will have changed his name, and
her only chance--if the man has been transferred from Sidi--is to
meet somebody who can identify him from her description," said
John.</p>
<p>"Clever lad," approved Digby, "you've got it. Here's a girl
looking for her Thomas, and hasn't got the vaguest idea as to
what he now calls himself. She can't even go about like Grace or
Zuleika asking for him by his Christian name, and, even if he's
in Sidi, it's like looking for a needle in a haystack; and if
he's in Morocco or the Sahara or the Sudan or Madagascar or
Tonkin, she'd never find him at all. He <i>may</i> be here, of
course. . . ."</p>
<p>"And that's where we come in," said John, wringing out the
shirt that he had washed. "By Jove," he added, suddenly
straightening himself up, "it couldn't be Isobel!"</p>
<p>"Of course not, you fat ass. That's what I thought the moment
Klingen spoke. But it was only yesterday you had a letter from
her. And if she came here, she'd have no need to stop strangers
in the street and ask if they spoke English. She'd only have to
send a card round from the hotel to the Barracks addressed to
<i>Légionnaire</i> John Smith, No. 18896, saying that she was at
the Hotel."</p>
<p>"Of course," agreed John sadly. "I spoke before I
thought."</p>
<p>"People who never think, inevitably do that," observed Digby
loftily.</p>
<p>"Now stop both thinking and talking and listen," he
continued.</p>
<p>"La Cigale, who was standing there, peeling away as though
he'd been a hotel scullion all his life, instead of a military
attaché and ornament of Courts, suddenly said:</p>
<p>"'Why! That must be the lady with whom I had so charming and
delightful an adventure last night.'</p>
<p>"You know how the poor old dear talks. He went on:</p>
<p>"'I was sitting in the Gardens, not feeling very happy, when a
lady came and sat down on the same seat. She was young,
beautiful, and a gentlewoman. She paid me the compliment . .
.'</p>
<p>"And here the poor old dear bowed most gracefully toward
me--</p>
<p>"'. . . of asking me if I were English. I replied in French
that I was not, but that I could speak the language quite well,
and we had quite a long talk. I promised to mention to all the
Englishmen whom I knew, that there was an English lady looking
for a compatriot. But the whole matter had gone completely out of
my mind until Klingen spoke just now. It must be the same lady. .
. . This absent-mindedness is terrible. . . .'</p>
<p>"And the old chap went off into apologies and regrets that
he'd forgotten to tell us."</p>
<p>"Hullo, here's Beau," interrupted John. "Beau," he added, "get
some mutton-fat, or dripping or something, and make your hair
extra beautiful. We're going calling on a lady this evening, at
the <i>Hôtel de l'Europe.</i>"</p>
<p>Beau's eyes opened a little wider as he looked from John to
Digby.</p>
<p>"Claudia here?" he asked.</p>
<p>"No," replied John. "Nor Isobel."</p>
<p>"Oh no," added Digby. "It's Grace or Zuleika or Zenobia or
Aggie or somebody," and he proceeded to tell Beau that there was
an English girl who had the courage to walk the streets of an
evening and stop passing soldiers, to inquire if they were
English or knew any Englishmen in the Legion.</p>
<p>"We must go and put ourselves at her disposal," said Michael
Geste.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 3</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Helen Malenton, sitting at "tea" in her room, and honestly
endeavouring to detect any remotely tea-like flavour in the
luke-warm liquid that trickled reluctantly from a grudging
coffee-pot, was losing heart and hope, if not faith and charity.
From the day that Barry had disappeared, leaving only a letter of
passionate renunciation of her, and even more passionate
denunciation of himself, she had kept a stout heart, high hope
and profound faith.</p>
<p>Being a firm believer in the great truth that Heaven helps
those that help themselves, she had done her utmost to merit the
help of Heaven, but hope had been deferred and undoubtedly her
heart had grown sick--with apprehension, disappointment, and the
feeling that the expected help had not been forthcoming.</p>
<p>She rose and went to the window that looked across a dirty
street to a dusty garden, and, turning from the familiar and
unsavoury prospect, began once more to pace the more familiar and
less savoury room--hideously ugly as only the sitting-room of a
provincial hotel can be.</p>
<p>"I <i>won't</i> give up," she said. . . .</p>
<p>"Faith as a grain of mustard seed . . . I <i>know</i> he's
alive, because he could not die without my being aware of it. . .
. My heart would die too. . . . Only believe and . . . if you
want anything hard enough it comes to pass. Effort is never
wasted."</p>
<p>Seating herself on an unbelievable sofa of stamped velvet, she
stared unseeingly at the incredible carpet, her tense hands
clenched on either side of her drawn face.</p>
<p>"Oh God," she whispered aloud. "<i>Do</i> help me. Life isn't
a welter of blind chance. . . . Oh, how long? . . . If there were
a ray of hope. . . . A sign. . . ."</p>
<p>She sprang from her seat as the door opened and a dirty
nondescript <i>garçon</i> of no particular nationality, and
arrayed chiefly in a green baize apron, entered bearing an
envelope in his grimy hand--an envelope addressed "To the English
lady staying at the <i>Hôtel de l'Europe.</i>"</p>
<p>Murmuring that this was apparently <i>pour mademoiselle,</i>
the youth explained that three soldiers were waiting below, for
an answer.</p>
<p>Tearing the envelope open with trembling fingers, Helen
Malenton read:</p>
<p>"Three English <i>légionnaires</i> would like to inquire
whether they can be of any help to you; and, if so, will be
delighted to put their services at your disposal."</p>
<p>Foolish and irrational hope sprang up in her heart.</p>
<p>An answer to prayer? A gleam of light in her darkest hour, the
darkest hour before the dawn?</p>
<p>"Where are they, these soldiers?" she asked eagerly.</p>
<p>"Below in the <i>fumoir,</i> madame."</p>
<p>"I will come down," said Helen quietly, and endeavoured to
conceal the excitement that surged up within her, and caused her
limbs to tremble.</p>
<p>Three handsome youths, obviously Englishmen, rose and bowed as
she entered the stale and dingy lounge.</p>
<p>"Good evening. Will you allow our excellent intentions to
excuse our intrusion?" said one of them. "I am--er--William Brown
and these are my brothers Thomas Jones and John Smith."</p>
<p>Helen Malenton gravely shook hands with her visitors as Digby
remarked:</p>
<p>"Same family, but different names. Curious, but quite
simple--like us."</p>
<p>"Yes," agreed John. "William is curious and Thomas is
simple."</p>
<p>"I think I understand," replied the girl. "My name is Helen
Malenton, and I'm most grateful to you for coming. I most
thankfully accept your offer of help. I have just discovered that
a friend of mine--my fiancé, in fact--is in the Legion, and I've
come to look for him. He disappeared suddenly. Nothing wrong; he
is absolutely incapable of doing anything base or mean."</p>
<p>Her voice trembled.</p>
<p>"Look at <i>me,</i> Miss Malenton," smiled Digby. "You have
but to glance at my countenance to be assured that I could do
nothing wrong, and am absolutely incapable of anything base or
mean. Yet I disappeared suddenly, and am in the Legion. And, in a
lesser degree, this applies to my brothers--who also disappeared
suddenly."</p>
<p>The girl smiled, and with regained self-control,
continued:</p>
<p>"I am sure you all understand."</p>
<p>"Absolutely," murmured Michael. "We are in a position to do
so, and may I add we quite understand that a man who is your
fiancé must be an honourable gentleman."</p>
<p>"Oh, he's one of the noblest and bravest of men who ever
lived," said the girl impulsively. "He hasn't a fault or a
failing, except that he is headstrong and rash, and yet very
sensitive really. You know how such a person can be beautifully
good-tempered and yet--well--at times <i>hot</i>-tempered."</p>
<p>"Oh, rather," agreed Digby. "They are the best sort. Pure gold
from the furnace--and with the warmth of the furnace still in the
heart of them--noble, brave and generous. I'm like that myself,"
and smiled infectiously.</p>
<p>Helen Malenton laughed for the first time in many months.</p>
<p>"Oh, we'll find him all right," he added. "What's he like? Is
he like me in face as well as character?"</p>
<p>"No," smiled Helen. "He's a very handsome man. . . ."</p>
<p>Michael and John grinned appreciatively, and Digby looked sad,
modest and embarrassed.</p>
<p>". . . but as dark as you are fair, I was going to say. Tall,
broad-shouldered and spare. Extremely handsome--almost too much
so, for a man--large eyes, silky black hair with a lovely wave in
it, aquiline nose, small moustache, rather small mouth, a cleft
chin. He had a complexion like a girl's. I used to chaff him
about it, and tell him it wasn't right. He would laugh, and say
it was due to his having been brought up solely by his mother,
for his father died when he was a baby."</p>
<p>An awful thought struck Michael Geste. <i>Jones!</i> Of course
it must be the poor chap who called himself Jones! Poor devil! .
. . And oh, this poor, poor girl! The unhappy, overwrought,
devil-driven Jones, too sensitive, highly-strung and
introspective even for ordinary life--much more so for life in
the Legion--the very last place in the world for a man of his
temperament.</p>
<p>Had they done their best for him? What more could they have
done? They'd been most kind and friendly of course, and they had
only got to know him on the day he committed suicide. It was
Digby who had discovered him and brought him along. Had he said
anything about a girl, in telling them his tragi-comic piteous
story?</p>
<p>And he had shot himself.</p>
<p>The poor girl was just too late. . . . Ghastly . . . Oh, this
was terrible.</p>
<p>He glanced at his brothers, and realized that the same thought
had entered their minds. Digby was eyeing him apprehensively and
he generally knew what his twin was thinking. John was looking
very grave and thoughtful.</p>
<p>"You haven't told us his name," he said, for the sake of
saying something while he considered the best way of breaking the
terrible news to the girl, should his fears prove justified.</p>
<p>"Chartres," was the reply. "Sir Barry Chartres; but I don't
suppose he would use his own name."</p>
<p>"I know the name perfectly well," remarked Beau, and added,
"No, he wouldn't use it in the Legion. You don't know what he
calls himself now, of course."</p>
<p>"No," replied the girl.</p>
<p>"I wonder if he called himself Jones," said John, eyeing
Michael.</p>
<p>"Quite likely," replied the girl. "Do you know an Englishman
of that <i>nom de guerre?"</i></p>
<p>"We <i>did,</i>" admitted Michael.</p>
<p>"Did?" queried Helen Malenton quickly. "Is he . . . ?"</p>
<p>"Was Sir Barry Chartres ever in the British Army? Did he ever
go to India?"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, he did. He transferred from his County Regiment to
the Indian Army, in the hope of seeing some active service."</p>
<p>The girl rose to her feet and faced them with shining eyes and
parted lips.</p>
<p>"What is your friend like? You said '<i>did.</i>' Does that
mean he has gone away from here? Where, where . . . ? Oh, it must
be Barry! There wouldn't be <i>two</i> Englishmen here, who had
both been in the Indian Army. Oh, <i>please</i> tell me quickly
where he has gone?"</p>
<p>Seldom had the three brothers felt more miserably
uncomfortable.</p>
<p>John and Digby looked to Beau for the next move, feeling that
the situation could not be in better hands, and, while prepared
to help him in every way, thankful that he was leader and
spokesman.</p>
<p>What could he do? This was going to be really painful.</p>
<p>"Look here, Miss Malenton," said Beau Geste. "Suppose you
leave everything to us. We are complete strangers to you, I know,
but you can trust us absolutely. . . ."</p>
<p>"Rather," chimed in Digby and John.</p>
<p>". . . and we will do our best for you; we should love to.
What I suggest is that you go back to England at once and we'll
carry on. Do! I'll write to you immediately, when there is any
definite news. It must be wretched for you here, and we three can
do all sorts of things that are impossible for you. Go home
tomorrow, and leave it to us."</p>
<p>"I don't know how to thank you," replied Helen Malenton. "But
I couldn't, I simply couldn't. I <i>had</i> to come here, the
moment I discovered that Barry had joined the Legion, and I must
stay here until I am absolutely convinced that he is not in
Sidi-bel-Abbès. And I shall only leave this place to go to some
other in which he may possibly be."</p>
<p>"Suppose, for the sake of argument, he were dead," said
Michael gravely.</p>
<p>"Oh, he isn't, he <i>couldn't</i> be," the girl protested.</p>
<p>"I want you to answer my question," replied Michael. "Suppose
it."</p>
<p>The girl smiled through gathering tears.</p>
<p>"Why then I could--and should--follow him, of course," she
answered. "I don't want to talk wildly, and be melodramatic, but
I am going to find him, either in this world or the next."</p>
<p>A silence fell upon the four. Digby wiped the palms of his
hands with his handkerchief.</p>
<p>Suppose it had been Isobel looking for <i>him.</i></p>
<p>"Please don't," murmured John, with the slight nervous cough
which his brothers knew to be an expression of deep embarrassment
at deep feeling.</p>
<p>Suppose it had been Isobel looking for <i>him.</i></p>
<p>"Well, then," said Michael, "if you won't go home and won't
leave here till you have a clue leading elsewhere, just remain
quietly here, and let us work for you. We'll hunt out every
English <i>légionnaire</i> in Sidi, and do our utmost to find out
what has become of all those who have been here during the last
five years. It'll be quite simple, for there are very few
Englishmen in the Legion. We shall be able to eliminate most of
them from the list very easily."</p>
<p>"Yes, but where <i>has</i> this friend of yours gone, please?"
interrupted the girl. "You don't tell me. It is almost certainly
Barry. I'll follow up this clue just as soon as I'm sure that
Barry himself is not here--and that should be easy, now that you
three are going to help me. I thank you a thousand times."</p>
<p>"Not at all. Pray don't speak of it," replied Michael. "It is
both a duty and a great pleasure. My only fear is lest we fail
or--or--have to bring you bad news. We'll go now, and start work
at once."</p>
<p>And the brothers rose to take their departure.</p>
<p>"Where <i>did</i> your friend <i>go,</i> please?" repeated the
girl as she extended her hand to Michael.</p>
<p>"That's what we're going to find out," was the reply.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 4</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"A brave and charming gentlewoman," said Beau as they marched
down the street from the <i>Hôtel de l'Europe.</i></p>
<p>"Yes," agreed Digby. "If only the late Mr. 'Jones' had been as
brave, and had stuck it out a little longer! How are we going to
tell her he blew his brains out just before she came?"</p>
<p>"We aren't," replied Michael.</p>
<p>"You mean we're going to say he died fighting bravely beneath
the Legion's flag?" asked John.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure we're going to tell her he's dead at all," was
the enigmatic reply.</p>
<p>"Enlighten us, Uncle," said Digby.</p>
<p>"I'm not at all certain that poor old Jones is the man. I've
got an idea."</p>
<p>"So have I," said John.</p>
<p>"The Man with the Face?" asked Michael.</p>
<p>"Clever lad," he approved.</p>
<p>"By Jove!" ejaculated Digby. "Of course! <i>Of</i> course!
Brainy birds! I never thought of that. He fits exactly, and of
the two it's far more likely that <i>her</i> man would be the one
who didn't commit suicide. I don't believe it was poor old Jones
at all. Oh brains, brains! I somehow feel certain it is the Man
with the Face."</p>
<p>"So do I," agreed John. "Her description of the long-lost
lover suits him even better than the late Jones. I got the
impression of a big chap from her description, and Jones wasn't
enormous."</p>
<p>"No," observed Michael, "but he wasn't by any means a small
man, and I wouldn't build much on that particular point. I
imagine that any average-sized man is a fine huge hero to the
girl who loves him."</p>
<p>"Yes, I suppose even we are," agreed Digby, his thoughts at
Brandon Abbas.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Michael and John simultaneously, their thoughts in
the same place.</p>
<p>"Still it really is an idea and a clue--and a hope," said
Digby, "and we'll follow it up for all it's worth. I vote we now
palter with the truth, and say that the ex-Indian Army man, to
whom we referred, is at Arzew, and that we are on his trail."</p>
<p>"It isn't paltering with the truth so much as switching it
over," said Michael. "A line of inquiry that was to lead us to
the Legion Cemetery in Sidi-bel-Abbès, now leads us to the
Convalescent Camp at Arzew."</p>
<p>"I say," broke in John. "There isn't very much time to lose,
is there? Didn't the Man with the Face say his time was up, and
that he was going to re-enlist? Pretty rotten for Miss Malenton
if he did so, just before we told her we'd found him!"</p>
<p>"Yes, and that raises another snag," said Michael loftily. "A
point upon which I have been wisely and profoundly pondering
while you and your brother jibber and jabber and gabble."</p>
<p>"A snag isn't a point, may I observe?" commented Digby coldly.
"A point is that which has no parts nor magnitude."</p>
<p>"Like your brain, my lad," answered Michael. "You call this
unfortunate gentleman 'the Man with the Face.' Well, does it or
does it not occur to what we must call your mind, that if he
<i>is</i> the man, he is certainly not going to bring his poor
carven face and lay it before his best girl?"</p>
<p>"By jove!" said Digby. "I never thought of that."</p>
<p>"What a ghastly position!" murmured John.</p>
<p>"But surely," he added, "the girl wouldn't turn him down
because he's hideously disfigured. Not if she really loves
him."</p>
<p>Would Isobel turn <i>him</i> down if his face were so slashed
and scarred that he was unrecognizable? She would not.</p>
<p>"But it's not of the <i>girl</i> that I'm thinking at all.
It's the man, my good little asses. I believe she'd stick to him
if he'd lost both eyes, both ears, both lips, and both nose.
<i>He'll</i> raise the trouble, not she."</p>
<p>"You're right, Beau," said Digby. "He will. I've got the
impression that he is the sort of person who'd do just that. I
believe he'd sooner meet anybody in the world than the woman he
loved."</p>
<p>"I can quite understand it too," agreed Beau. "He'd feel that
she'd be repressing shudders the whole time, and fighting a
desire to scream. He'd be afraid that, purely out of loyalty and
decency, she'd swear she not only still loved him, but couldn't
<i>live</i> without him."</p>
<p>"While, all the time, life was a purgatory to her--a hideous
nightmare," added John.</p>
<p>"Depends on the woman, of course," said Digby. "There are
women who'd honestly and truly love their man all the more
because he was a bit chipped and cracked. Want to make it up to
him, and mother him."</p>
<p>"Yes," agreed John, "there are. And then again there are
equally fine women who simply could not bear it--literally could
not stand the sight of a face like that, without being physically
sick."</p>
<p>"And that's what poor old Carven Face will think, I'm afraid,"
said Michael. "He'll write and tell her he's not the only pebble
on the beach and beg her to acquire a nice round smooth pebble
that has not been carved--by Arabs. We'll do our best, anyhow,
and we shall have to be careful and clever."</p>
<p>"John, <i>you'll</i> have to be careful," stated Digby.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 5</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Le légionnaire</i> Robinson had returned from Arzew, his
intention of re-enlisting confirmed by an offer of promotion to
the rank of Corporal if he did so. He realized that he would
probably regret the step when it was too late, but after
impartially studying his terrible face, with the help of a good
mirror, he decided that the best place for such a work of art was
a desert outpost at the ultimate Back of Beyond.</p>
<p>"A pretty picture," he smiled grimly, as he regarded his
reflection. "A picture which should certainly be hung," and he
smiled again.</p>
<p>But only <i>le légionnaire</i> Robinson knew that the facial
contortion was a smile.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Seated alone in a dark corner of the canteen, on the night of
his return to Sidi-bel-Abbès, his hand, as usual, across his face
as though to shade his eyes, he saw an Englishman enter the room
and approach him. Pulling his <i>képi</i> well down over his
face, he turned away and appeared to fall asleep.</p>
<p>"Discouraging," murmured Beau to himself as he turned to the
zinc-topped bar, and procured a bottle of wine and a couple of
glasses.</p>
<p>Seating himself beside Robinson, Beau Geste poured out two
glasses of wine, coughed slightly, somewhat in the manner of
John, and remarked:</p>
<p>"As you say, Robinson, this is an unwarrantable
intrusion."</p>
<p>"I haven't said anything," growled Robinson.</p>
<p>"No, not aloud," agreed Michael. "Very nice of you, but I am
butting in nevertheless, and I apologize--and my reason is my
excuse. I've got a most important message for you."</p>
<p>"Oh?" grunted Robinson, evincing no interest whatever.</p>
<p>"From a lady," added Michael.</p>
<p>"Yes?" growled Robinson, with the complete indifference of one
who received messages from ladies every few minutes.</p>
<p>"From <i>Miss Helen Malenton,</i>" enunciated Michael, slowly
and distinctly.</p>
<p>Robinson's hand, extended to raise his glass, knocked it off
the table.</p>
<p>"Ah?" he murmured, in the tone of one who was more than a
little bored by Miss Malenton's attentions.</p>
<p>Watching the man's face as closely as was possible, Michael
decided that it had shown no faintest sign of any feeling
whatsoever; no slightest flicker of emotion; no shadow of change
of expression, as he spoke the girl's name. But, as he told
himself, he could not see the eyes properly, and the rest of the
face was hardly calculated to register emotion of any sort. In
fact, it was not a face at all, but a mask, a mask of tortured
flesh, probably incapable of showing what its unfortunate owner
felt, even when he wished it to do so.</p>
<p>Yes, decided Michael, <i>le légionnaire</i> Robinson was well
entrenched behind the double defence of the mask he wished to
wear and the mask he <i>had</i> to wear. Only his hands betrayed
him, as so often they betray the man who has perfect facial
control.</p>
<p>This was going to be a difficult job, and Robinson was going
to behave exactly as they had feared.</p>
<p>"She is here," he said quietly. "Here in Sidi-bel-Abbès."</p>
<p>"Yes?" was the discouraging reply, in a voice as cool and
quiet as Michael's own.</p>
<p>"She wants to see you, Robinson," continued Michael.</p>
<p>"To <i>see</i> me?" asked Robinson. "Five <i>sous</i> a peep,
or something like that? Have you gone into the impresario
business, or what?"</p>
<p>The man was certainly bitter.</p>
<p>"Don't <i>you</i> want to see <i>her?</i>" said Michael
patiently.</p>
<p>"Not the faintest desire, thanks," was the uncompromising
answer.</p>
<p>Michael sighed, and picking up Robinson's glass, he refilled
it.</p>
<p>"Let's drink to her health," he suggested.</p>
<p>"With pleasure," growled Robinson. He raised his glass,
muttered something unintelligible, and drained it.</p>
<p>"She's an amazingly brave, staunch, loyal woman," observed
Michael.</p>
<p>"I'm sure she is," agreed the other.</p>
<p>"And she's in a pretty bad way, too," added Michael somewhat
sharply. And--</p>
<p>"Look here, Robinson," more sharply still, "at the risk of
your considering me an impudent meddler, I really must say
this--When a girl has suffered on a man's account as Miss
Malenton has done on yours--and when moreover she has travelled
to Sidi-bel-Abbès to look for him--I do think it's up to him to
see her."</p>
<p>"Yes," agreed Robinson politely.</p>
<p>"Well, don't you think it's the very least he can do?"</p>
<p>"Oh, quite," agreed Robinson again.</p>
<p>"Then you <i>will</i> see her?" said Michael promptly.</p>
<p>"No, Mr. What-is-your-name, I will <i>not</i>--and we'll now
close this somewhat boring conversation," yawned <i>le
légionnaire</i> Robinson, as he arose and departed thence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 6</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Ah, this is a job that wants brains, of course," observed
Digby at the conclusion of Michael's account of his discouraging
interview with <i>le légionnaire</i> Robinson. "Leave it to
<i>me;</i> do as I tell you, and all will be well.</p>
<p>"D'you mind if I visit Miss Malenton unhampered and
unhindered--I mean, unaccompanied and unsupported, by your two
silly faces?" he added.</p>
<p>"Quite hopeless, my dear chap," said John, "even if Miss
Malenton were not absolutely wrapped up in her lost lover. And,
in any case, she would prefer a visit from the nicest of us."</p>
<p>"We must try and keep him out of the sun, Beau," urged Digby,
surveying his younger brother compassionately; "and while he
keeps out of the sun I'm going into the shadows--of the <i>Hôtel
de l'Europe</i> to propound a scheme to Miss Malenton."</p>
<p>"And why this sudden desire for a tête-à-tête?" inquired Beau.
"If you feel you have a Mission and a Message and that we are
neither worthy nor competent . . ."</p>
<p>"Well, it's only partly that," smiled Digby. "But I feel you'd
be much more competent to play your little parts in my plan, if
you knew nothing about it."</p>
<p>"Quite probably, I should say," observed Michael. "What are
our parts?"</p>
<p>"Merely to lend your countenances and your money to my scheme.
It's a dinner-party. We are going to dine and wine Mr. Robinson.
A dinner to mark the occasion of his coming promotion and
re-enlistment--a most hilarious celebration and all that."</p>
<p>"Where?" inquired John.</p>
<p>"At the <i>Hôtel de l'Europe,</i>" was the reply.</p>
<p>"He'd never go there," objected Michael. "He literally
wouldn't show his face in a crowded café like that."</p>
<p>"We shall have a private room," said Digby. "He'll come all
right. He's very fond of me--naturally."</p>
<p>"And if he does, what's the idea? Make him drunk and get his
word of honour that he will at least consent to an interview with
Miss Malenton before he re-enlists?"</p>
<p>"Wrong again," was the answer. "Now ask no more questions, but
be prepared to dine and wallow in the wassail on Sunday evening
with Robinson at the <i>Hôtel de l'Europe.</i> This is Friday,
isn't it? I'm going to see Robinson to-night and Miss Malenton
to-morrow, and thereafter you shall behold the wondrous works of
your Uncle Digby."</p>
<p>As one man, his brothers emitted a loud derisive grunt.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The charming Digby charmed, and the morose and bitter Robinson
succumbed, on learning that the dinner was to be held in a
private room, and that absolutely nobody but the three Englishmen
was to be invited to it. "It's extraordinarily nice of you
fellows," he growled, "and I can't refuse."</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 7</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The dinner went extremely well, for the Gestes were what they
were, and Robinson strove to be what he once had been, a gay and
debonair gentleman. The warmth of their kindly friendship unfroze
the once genial current of his soul.</p>
<p>No mention whatever was made of Miss Helen Malenton, and when,
at the wine-and-walnut stage of the feast, she entered the room,
neither Michael nor John was greatly surprised.</p>
<p>The four men rose to their feet, and Robinson stared, his
mangled face utterly expressionless.</p>
<p>Helen Malenton, her eyes shining, her countenance transfigured
with emotion ineffable and uncontrolled, gazed at him for a
moment, uttered a little gasping cry, rushed to him and flung her
arms about his neck.</p>
<p>"Oh <i>Barry, Barry,</i> my darling!" she sobbed.</p>
<p>Seizing her arms in his hands, Robinson removed them from
about his neck and gently but firmly pushed her from him.</p>
<p>"I don't know you," he said.</p>
<p>"Oh my own <i>darling,</i> my <i>dearest!</i>" cried the girl.
"Your friend told me that your face had been wounded. . . . I was
prepared for it. . . . My sweetheart, it is <i>nothing</i> to
me."</p>
<p>"I don't know you," repeated Robinson, his outstretched hand
between them.</p>
<p>"Barry my <i>love,</i> my <i>darling,</i> don't be so foolish!
If such a thing be possible, I love you all the more! . . . How
can you possibly think I should shrink from you? Why, my darling
sweetheart, I used to think you were far <i>too</i> handsome for
a man. . . . You were <i>pretty</i> almost. I swear to God that I
like you better like this, even though I couldn't love you
better."</p>
<p>The man's hand fell to his side in a gesture of resignation
and acceptance, and the girl's arms were again clasped about his
neck.</p>
<p>"I am <i>not</i> Barry," he groaned, and as, with the laugh of
a mother humouring her child she drew his head down until their
lips met, his arms went about her and crushed her to him.</p>
<p>Except for themselves, the room was empty.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 8</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Once again, good-bye, and God for ever bless you," said <i>le
légionnaire</i> Robinson, wringing the hands of the brothers, as
the four stood at the barrack-gate.</p>
<p>"You'll keep your promise and visit us on the island that we
are going to buy--one of the Islands of the Blest, of which we
shall be the sole inhabitants, and where no one but her will see
my face. . . . God! To think that to-day I should have
re-enlisted and gone back into hell instead of going off into
Paradise with this noble and wonderful woman. How can I ever
<i>begin</i> to thank you?"</p>
<p>"No need," replied Beau Geste. "It's been the most tremendous
pleasure. We shall always be happy to think that we brought you
and Miss Malenton together again."</p>
<p>"You didn't bring us together <i>again,</i>" smiled
Robinson.</p>
<p>Surprised, the Geste brothers stared uncomprehendingly.</p>
<p>"I never set eyes on her in my life until last night," he
said, and as he turned away added, "<i>But she won't believe
it!</i>"</p>

<p><i>Le Légionnaire</i> Yato was one of the quietest, most
retiring and self-effacing men in the Company, and one of the
most modest. It seemed to be his highest ambition--an ambition
which he almost attained--to escape notice, to blush unseen, and
to hide his light beneath a bushel.</p>
<p>And yet, to those who had the seeing eye, he was an extremely
interesting person, and for many reasons. He greatly intrigued
the Geste brothers, and in spite of his meek, self-effacing
humility, they took note of him from the day he arrived, and
watched him with interest.</p>
<p>At first sight, and to the casual eye, he was a poor
specimen--small, narrow-shouldered, weedy, with yellowish face, a
wiry scrub of short hair, and a silly sort of little straggling
moustache, the loss of one hair of which would have made an
obvious difference.</p>
<p>The mere look of him caused Sergeant-Major Lejaune to feel
unwell, and he made no secret of the fact. Indeed, he promised to
stuff the little man into a slop-pail and to be ill upon him.</p>
<p>Never had the Geste boys, who were watching the arrival of
this batch of recruits, seen so hopelessly dull, stupid and
apathetic a face in their lives, as that of this recruit, while
Sergeant-Major Lejaune regarded it; never had they seen one more
acutely intelligent, expressive, spirited and observant as
Sergeant-Major Lejaune passed on.</p>
<p>"See that?" chuckled Digby to his brothers.</p>
<p>"Yes," replied Beau. "If I were Lejaune I think I'd let that
gentleman alone. Wonder what brought him here."</p>
<p>"He's come 'for to admire and for to see,' I should think,"
said John, "and come a long way too." And as the line of recruits
turned to their left and marched off, he added, "His shoulders
have been drilled too, and I'll bet you any amount he's worn a
sword and spurs."</p>
<p>Other interesting facts transpired later. The mild little man
could cut your hair and shave you beautifully, and he could speak
your language if you were English, French, Russian or German. He
could also sketch rather marvellously, and do pictures of
surpassing merit in water-colour and in oil. He preferred to do
these drawings and pictures out in the open air--the more open
the better--and he had done some beauties of the country round
Quetta, for example, and the Khyber Pass, showing all the pretty
forts and things.</p>
<p>His manners were delightful, and he gave offence to no man,
least of all to those set in authority over him.</p>
<p>To their surprise, the Geste boys--who, during his early
recruit days went out of their way to help this lonely little
stranger in a strange land--discovered that he knew England
fairly well, particularly Portsmouth, Plymouth, Weymouth, Rosyth,
Aldershot and Chatham.</p>
<p>For the most part, <i>le légionnaire</i> Yato's
inoffensiveness, humility, excellent manners, and blameless
conduct, kept him out of almost all trouble, official or
private--but not entirely. Although a man may camouflage himself
with a protective colouring of drab dullness and uniformity,
which does indeed protect him by hiding him from general notice,
it may not always suffice to hide him from particular notice. His
very quietness and mild meekness may be his undoing through
attracting the eye of those who need a butt for their diversion,
and even more urgently need long-suffering meekness and mildness
in that butt.</p>
<p>Two such were Messieurs Brandt and Haff, men who, themselves
the butt of their superiors for their stupidity, slovenliness,
and general worthlessness, must find someone to be their butt in
turn. Almost a necessity of their existence was someone upon whom
they could visit the contumely heaped upon themselves.
Subconsciously they felt that, for their self-respect's sake,
they must stand upon something lower than themselves, or be
themselves the lowest things of all.</p>
<p>And this recruit, Yato, seemed so suitable to their purpose,
so dull and stupid, so unable to protect himself, so harmless,
helpless and hopeless, so proper a target for the shafts of their
wit.</p>
<p>So they put thorn-brush in his bed, and unpleasant matter in
his <i>képi</i> and on his pillow; stole his kit; put a dead
mouse in his coffee; arranged a booby-trap for his benefit;
fouled his white uniform after he had washed and ironed it; gave
him false information, messages and orders, to his discomfiture
and undoing; hid his brushes just before kit inspection; stole
his soap; cut his bootlaces and generally demonstrated their own
wit, humour and jocularity as well as his stupidity, harmlessness
and general inferiority to themselves.</p>
<p>One day, Beau Geste and his brothers entered their
barrack-room and discovered the cringing Yato ruefully eyeing
<i>les légionnaires</i> Brandt, Haff, Klingen and Schwartz--four
huge and powerful men, who were proposing to toss him in a
blanket, having first denuded him of all clothing. The bright
idea had been that of Brandt. He had proposed it; Haff had
seconded it; and the two, realizing with their wonted brilliance
that a blanket has four corners, had impressed the services of
the delighted and all-too-willing Schwartz and Klingen.</p>
<p>"Where shall we do it?" roared Schwartz, a great bearded
ruffian, strong as a bull, rough as a bear, and sensitive as a
wart-hog.</p>
<p>"You won't do it at all," said Beau Geste, advancing to where
the four stood about Yato's disordered bed, from which they had
dragged a blanket.</p>
<p>"I do not like to be touched and handled," said Yato quietly,
in the silence that fell upon the surprised bullies. "Please
leave me alone."</p>
<p>"They are going to leave you alone," said Beau Geste.</p>
<p>"Yes! Watch us!" shouted Brandt, and sprang at the cringing
little Jap as the mighty Schwartz turned upon Michael Geste, his
great hands clenched, his eyes blazing, and his teeth bared. But
as he raised his fist to strike, he swung about as something, or
someone, fell against him from behind.</p>
<p>It was Brandt.</p>
<p>Using his right arm as though it were an axe, of which the
side of the hand from little finger to wrist was the edge, Yato
had struck Brandt an extraordinary cutting chopping blow on the
neck, below and behind the ear.</p>
<p>As Brandt fell against Schwartz and to the ground, apparently
dead, the Jap seized Haff by the collar of his tunic, where it
fastened at the throat, and jerked his head violently downward,
at the same time himself springing violently upward, so that the
top of his bullet-head struck Haff between the eyes with
tremendous force.</p>
<p>The huge Schwartz, changing his line of attack, as he turned
about, sprang upon Yato, as might a lion upon a gazelle. The
gazelle threw itself at the lion's feet--but not in supplication.
Before the astonished Gestes could come to the rescue, they saw
Yato fling his arms about Schwartz's ankles, causing the upper
part of his body to fall forward. And as it did so, Yato
astonishingly arose, hugging Schwartz's ankles to his breast.</p>
<p>The result of this lightning movement was that the big man
pitched upon his head so heavily that nothing but its thickness
saved him from concussion of the brain, and it seemed impossible
that his neck should not be broken. And, almost as the body of
Schwartz reached the ground, Yato sprang at Klingen, who was in
the act of drawing a knife.</p>
<p>Seizing the wrist of the hand that held this ugly weapon, the
Japanese wheeled so that he stood beside Klingen, shoulder to
shoulder, and facing in the same direction. As he did so, he
thrust his left arm beneath Klingen's right, and across his
chest, at the same time pulling Klingen's straightened right arm
violently downward. There was a distinctly audible crack as the
arm broke above the elbow.</p>
<p>Where four burly bullies had gathered about a cringing little
man, three lay insensible and one knelt whimpering with pain.</p>
<p>"I do not like to be touched and handled," smiled Yato.</p>
<p>"I don't think you will be, to any great extent," smiled Digby
Geste in return.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 2</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But a man may be touched without being handled, and it was the
dominating desire of Klingen's life to "touch" Yato.</p>
<p>It became essential to his continued existence that he should
avenge his broken arm, his humiliating defeat and utter
overthrow.</p>
<p>For Klingen was a conceited man, devoid of pride, but filled
with self-esteem.</p>
<p>He was handsome and he knew it. But "handsome is as handsome
does," and Klingen had done most evilly. It was, in fact, by
reason of his last and most treacherous love-affair that he was
hiding in the Legion.</p>
<p>He was big and strong and bold, and he had been made to grovel
groaning at the feet of a man one-half his size. He hated pain,
and he had been made to suffer agony unspeakable.</p>
<p>And so he was obsessed with thoughts of vengeance, and lived
for the day when the Japanese should make full payment for the
insult and the injury he had put upon the bold and brave, the
hardy and handsome Klingen.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a certain poor satisfaction could be obtained by
lashing the unspeakable Oriental verbally; for, curiously enough,
the Japanese did not resent such abuse--apparently. So when
Klingen came out of hospital he poured forth upon his quiet
shrinking enemy all the choice epithets, insults and injurious
foulness that he had perpetrated, polished and perfected during
the miserable leisure of his enforced retirement.</p>
<p>He assured Yato that he was a yellow monkey, a loathsome
"native," a <i>coloured</i> man, if indeed he were a man at all.
Klingen explained fully and carefully that he had always drawn
the colour line, and had drawn it straight and strong; also that
it was, to him, the very worst aspect of life in the Legion that
one was forced to herd with coloured men, natives, that foul scum
(or sediment) of humanity which is barely human. He explained
that while he hated niggers, abhorred Arabs and detested Chinese,
words utterly failed him to express the loathing horror with
which he regarded Japs. Brown was bad, black was worse, but what
could be said of yellow? That vile bilious colour was disgusting
in <i>anything</i>--but in human beings it was . . . !</p>
<p>One could be but dumbly sick, and whenever his revolted eye
fell upon <i>le légionnaire</i> Yato, his revolting stomach
almost had its way, and in crude pantomime Klingen would express
his feelings.</p>
<p>And Yato would smile.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the good Klingen was at infinite pains to
indicate the private and personal hideousness of Yato as distinct
from his national bestiality. He would invite all present to
contemplate the little man's unspeakable eyes, indescribable
moustache, unmentionable nose, unbelievable hair, and unutterable
ugliness.</p>
<p>And Yato would smile.</p>
<p>But it was noticed that Klingen never touched the Japanese,
nor sought physical retaliation for his broken arm. Nor did
Messieurs Haff, Brandt and Schwartz. In fact, these three
appeared to entertain feelings rather of reluctant admiration and
sporting acquiescence, than of hatred and vengeance, and when
Klingen proposed various schemes for Yato's undoing, they would
have none of them. They were quite content to regard him as a
freak of nature and a human marvel.</p>
<p>Of him they had had quite enough, and it was their firm
intention to leave him severely alone.</p>
<p>Not so Klingen. If Klingen were to live, Yato must die; or,
better still--far, far better still--suffer some dire, ineffable
humiliation, life-long and worse than death.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Seated in a row, on a bench in the Jardin Publique, Beau Geste
in the middle, the three brothers contemplated the Vast Forever
without finding life one grand sweet song.</p>
<p>Life was hard, comfortless, small and monotonous; but quite
bearable so long as it yielded a lazy hour when they could sit
thus, smoking their pipes in silent communion, or in idle and
disjointed conversation about Brandon Abbas. Frequently Michael
would speculate upon Claudia's doings; Digby and John upon those
of Isobel.</p>
<p>"Here comes old Yato," murmured Digby. "I'm going to hit him,
one day," he added.</p>
<p>"What for?" inquired John.</p>
<p>"Fun," replied Digby.</p>
<p>"Fun for whom--Yato?" inquired Michael.</p>
<p>"Yes," replied Digby. "I want to see what happens to me."</p>
<p>"You won't see," asserted Michael. "You'll only feel."</p>
<p>"Well, you two shall watch and tell me exactly what happens,"
said Digby. "Then I can do it to you two."</p>
<p>"Good evening, gentlemen," said Yato, with a courteous salute.
"Excuse that I approach you."</p>
<p>The brothers rose as one, saluted the tiny man, and invited
him to be seated with them.</p>
<p>"Excuse that I intrude with my insignificant presence,
gentlemen, but I would humbly venture to do you the honour, and
pay you the compliment, of asking a favour of you. You are
<i>samurai.</i> If one of you gave assent with no more than a nod
of his head, it would be a binding contract. . . . Will you do
something for me?"</p>
<p>"Yes," replied Beau Geste.</p>
<p>"You do not stop to make conditions, nor to hear what the
request may be. You do not fear that it may be something you
would not like to do."</p>
<p>"No," replied Beau Geste.</p>
<p>"Ah," smiled Yato, "as I thought. Well, I'm going a long walk
one day soon, and I may want something done for me by a friend,
after I have gone. I do not <i>know</i> that I shall, but it is
quite possible. . . ."</p>
<p>"We shall be delighted," said Beau Geste, and his brothers
murmured assent.</p>
<p>Yato bowed deeply.</p>
<p>"Honourable sirs," he said.</p>
<p>"Better not tell us anything about your--er--long walk," said
Beau Geste. "We shouldn't give you away, of course, but we're not
good liars I'm afraid."</p>
<p>"Oh," smiled Yato, "tell them anything and everything that you
know, should you be questioned. The honourable authorities will
be entirely welcome to me--if they can catch me."</p>
<p>And he rose to go.</p>
<p>"I will leave a note under your pillow or in your
<i>musette,</i>" he continued, addressing Beau Geste. "Goodbye,
gentle and honourable sirs. May I have the distinction of shaking
the hands?"</p>
<p>"Queer little cove and great little gentleman," observed Digby
when Yato had departed.</p>
<p>"Yes," agreed Michael. "A very good friend and a very
dangerous enemy, I should say. I suppose he's in the Japanese
Secret Service."</p>
<p>"I don't think I will hit him, after all," mused Digby.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 3</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Colonel the Baron Hoshiri of the Japanese General Staff, and
of the French Foreign Legion (in the name of Yato), made his way
along the Rue de Daya with, as he would have said, a song in his
heart. There was no smile upon his grim lips, nor expression of
joy in his eyes nor upon his face. They were, in fact, utterly
expressionless.</p>
<p>But he was very, very happy, for he was returning to his
heaven upon earth, at the feet of Fuji Yama--the land of the
cherry blossom, the chrysanthemum, the geisha, and the Rising
Sun. He was leaving this land of barbarians devoid of manners,
arts, graces and beauty.</p>
<p>Also, he had found a little friend, and she gave the lilt to
the song that was in his heart.</p>
<p>A Flower from Japan.</p>
<p>Soiled and trodden and cast aside by these barbarian brutes,
but still a Flower from Japan.</p>
<p>A pitiful little story--heart-breaking--but the little flower,
picked up from the mud, dipped in pure cleansing dew, and set in
a vase of fair water, was reviving.</p>
<p>He would take it back to Japan and it would bloom again and
live, a thing of beauty and of joy.</p>
<p>Yes, a pitiful little tale.</p>
<p>Her parents had taken her to the <i>yoshiwara</i> to earn her
dowry. There she had met her future husband, and thence she had
been taken--rescued rather it seemed to her--by this man who so
earnestly begged her to become his wife. He seemed a nice kind
man, and her heart did not sink very much when he told her that
they were going to travel to the wonderful West--for he was a
merchant, and his business lay in Marseilles.</p>
<p>This was quite true, and in Marseilles, where his business
lay, he sold her--in the way of business. Mr. Ah Foo (born in
Saigon of a Chinese woman and a French Marine) did very well out
of his little bride Sanyora--as he did out of all his other
little brides, for he was what one might call a regular marrying
man, and had entered the bonds of matrimony scores of times, and
each of his wives had entered a bondage unescapable.</p>
<p>From Marseilles, Sanyora had been sold to a gentleman who
travelled for his house, in Algiers, and had been taken to that
house. Thence she had been appointed, without her knowledge or
consent, to a vacancy (created by death--and a knife) in Oran.
From there she had been sold into an even fouler bondage in
Sidi-bel-Abbès.</p>
<p>Could she do nothing for herself? Yes--fight like a tiger-cat
until drugged, and scream appeals for help--in Japanese, the only
language she knew.</p>
<p>And, in that language, Colonel Hoshiri had heard her cry to
God for death, as he passed below the open shutters of a house in
a slum of the Spanish quarter. He had entered, asked for the
Japanese girl, made his way to her room, addressed her in
Japanese, and told her he only wished to be a friend and
deliverer.</p>
<p>And now Sanyora had her own pretty room in a private house in
a respectable quarter, and the Colonel had a haven of rest and
peace--a refuge and quiet place in which he could take his ease
and hear his own language from beautiful lips. Between them, they
had made it a tiny corner of Japan, and, day by day, Sanyora grew
more and more to be the dainty, charming and delightful geisha,
wholly attractive mistress of the arts that delight and soothe
and charm the eye and ear--and heart.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>As usual, <i>le légionnaire</i> Yato was watched and followed
by his bitter and relentless enemy, Klingen. A stab in the back,
as he passed through some dark alley, would be simple enough, but
it would be <i>too</i> simple. To a devil like Yato, it would
have to be a death-stroke, and he might die without knowing who
had killed him. That would be a very poor sort of vengeance.</p>
<p>What Klingen wanted was to hurt him, and hurt him, and
<i>hurt</i> him . . . humiliate him to the dust . . . disgrace
and degrade and shame him . . . torture him to death . . . but a
long, slow, lingering death. . . .</p>
<p>One night Yato might go to <i>le village Nègre.</i> Anything
could happen there. There was no foul and fearful villainy that
one could not buy, and a very little money went a very long way
in <i>le village Nègre.</i> One could certainly have a man
waylaid, knocked on the head, gagged and bound and tied down on a
native bedstead in a dark room in a native house. One could hire
the room and have the key. One could visit one's victim nightly,
and taunt him throughout the night. One could let him starve to
death, or keep him alive for weeks.</p>
<p>The things one could do! What about that lovely trick of
inverting a brass bowl on the man's bare stomach . . . a rat
inside the bowl . . . some red-hot charcoal on top of the bowl. .
. .</p>
<p>How long does it take the rat to eat his way into, and
through, the man? Might it not be too quick a death? No, that was
the whole point of it--a good sound slow torture.</p>
<p>Klingen licked his lips and followed the distant figure of
Yato with his eyes.</p>
<p>Going to the same house again, was he? A pity he did not go to
<i>le village Nègre.</i> What could be the attraction here? A
woman, of course.</p>
<p>Klingen pondered the thought. There might be something in that
. . . especially if he were fond of her. An idea--of dazzling
brilliance. Jealousy! No vengeance like it--for a start. Get his
woman from him. Was there a girl alive who would give a second
glance at that hideous little yellow monkey when the fine big
handsome swaggering swashbuckling Klingen was about? What an
exquisite moment when the girl (seated on Klingen's knee, her
head on Klingen's shoulder, her arms round Klingen's neck) turned
languidly to Yato as Yato entered Yato's own room, and said to
him in accents of extremest scorn, "Get to hell out of this, you
dirty little yellow monkey. The sight and the smell of you make
me feel sick in my stomach."</p>
<p>That would be a great moment. And these women could be
bought.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Ah, yes . . . the little yellow devil was turning into the
same house again. It <i>must</i> be a woman.</p>
<p>Klingen reconnoitred once again. The usual type of house with
a common stairway leading up from a gloomy little basement hall
to a rookery of rooms, apartments and flats occupied by
hard-working poor people of the better sort.</p>
<p>Klingen hesitated, and for the first time entered the house
and looked round the dingy entrance-hall, stone-floored,
stucco-walled, gloomily lit by a smoky oil-lamp hanging against
the wall, and by the rays that shone through iron-barred
window-spaces from a street lamp.</p>
<p>Should he climb the bare, wooden stair that led to the floors
above? Why not? Anyone might enter the wrong house by mistake
when searching for a friend. Still, it was a pity Schwartz, Haff
and Brandt could not be persuaded to come along and have some fun
at the expense of the yellow monkey.</p>
<p>Footsteps. . . . Someone coming down the stairs. . . . A
little man in seedy European clothing. . . . An idea . . .</p>
<p>"Excuse me, Monsieur," said Klingen, as the man reached the
bottom of the stairs. "Can you tell me which is my friend's room?
A <i>légionnaire</i>--a little fellow--Japanese."</p>
<p>The man shrugged his shoulders and made a gesture with his
hands which showed that he was a Spaniard; also that he did not
understand a word of what was being said to him.</p>
<p>Klingen mounted to the first floor, a bare landing, around
three sides of which were closed, numbered doors. Should he tap
at each in turn, and inquire for some non-existent person? And
what should he do if one of them were opened by Yato? Suppose the
yellow tiger-cat attacked him again? His mended arm tingled at
the thought. What was he doing here at all? This longing for
vengeance was driving him mad. . . .</p>
<p>Klingen turned back, descended to the street, and took up his
stand in a doorway from which he could keep watch upon the porch
of the house in which was his enemy.</p>
<p>Another idea! . . . What about waiting until Yato left the
house? He could then go in and knock at every door and ask:</p>
<p>"Is my friend <i>le légionnaire</i> Yato here--a little
Japanese?" If one of the doors were opened by some woman who
replied, "No, he has just gone," he would know that he had found
what he sought, and would get to work forthwith. He would soon
show her the difference between a Yato and a Klingen. And if
Klingen knew anything of women, and he flattered himself that he
most certainly did, there was a bad time coming for the yellow
devil. . . . He could almost hear the very accents in which she
should say:</p>
<p>"Get out of my sight, you filthy yellow cur. I've got a
<i>man</i> now!"</p>
<p>"Yes, and Klingen would have his knife ready too, and this
time he'd throw it, if Yato made trouble. And he also flattered
himself that he knew something of knife-throwing.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Ha! There he was. . . . Blister and burn him!</p>
<p>The retreating form of Yato turned the corner of the street,
and Klingen darted across into the house. Running lightly up the
stairs he knocked at the first door. No answer. He knocked again,
and laid his ear against the wood.</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>He knocked at the next. A fat, slatternly woman, candle in
hand, opened the door and eyed him hardily.</p>
<p>"Well?" she inquired, running her eye contemptuously over his
uniform.</p>
<p>"Monsieur Blanc?" inquired Klingen.</p>
<p>The woman slammed the door in his face.</p>
<p>The third and fourth rooms were apparently empty.</p>
<p>A child opened the door of the fifth, and seeing a
<i>légionnaire,</i> shut it instantly. Hearing a man's deep
growling voice within, Klingen passed on.</p>
<p>To Klingen's inquiry, at the sixth room, as to whether
Monsieur Blanc lived here, the woman who occupied it replied that
he did, but was at the moment in the wineshop round the
corner!</p>
<p>"Then may he sit there till he rots," observed Klingen, and
climbed the second flight of stairs, and, arriving at a landing
similar to the one below, repeated his strategy and tactics.</p>
<p>The first door was opened by a tiny dainty Japanese girl, and
Klingen thrust his way into the room, closed the door behind him,
locked it, and removed the key.</p>
<p>He had found what he wanted.</p>
<p>The girl stood staring, between terror and surprise. This man
was in a similar uniform to that which her lover wore. He must be
his friend, otherwise how would he have known she was here? But
her beloved had only just gone. Had something happened to him,
and why had this man thrust in so roughly, uninvited. But they
were rough and rude, these Western barbarians. Why had he come?
Did he think this place was like one of those dreadful houses in
Marseilles, Algiers and Oran? And she shuddered at the
thought.</p>
<p>Oh, if she could only understand what he was saying and make
herself understood by him! He seemed to be speaking of someone
named Yato. Was it conceivable that he might understand a word of
Japanese?</p>
<p>"I am the servant of the Colonel Hoshiri. What do you want?"
she said in her own tongue.</p>
<p>And, for reply, Klingen snatched her up in his arms and kissed
her violently.</p>
<p>Well, this was a fine <i>affaire! . . .</i> This marched! . .
. She might, or might not, be Yato's girl, but most certainly she
was. A Japanese would hardly be visiting a house in a
Sidi-bel-Abbès side-street in which there was a Japanese woman,
unless he were visiting her. Japs were not so common in the
African hinterland as that. . . . But anyhow, and whoever she
was, this was still a fine <i>affaire,</i> for here was Klingen
the irresistible, locked up in a room with as pretty a little
piece as he had ever clapped eyes on. And a very nice room, too,
if a little bare. Bed, cushions, hangings, flowers in vase--yes,
all very nice indeed.</p>
<p>And now for the little woman. A pity they could not understand
each other's language, but the language of love is universal. He
could soon make himself understood all right.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When <i>le légionnaire</i> Klingen let himself out of the room
an hour or so later, he left a sobbing girl lying upon the bed
weeping as though her heart would break; moaning as though it
were already broken.</p>
<p>But Klingen, as he walked back to barracks, smiled greasily as
he licked his lips, and encountering Yato in the barrack-room,
laughed aloud.</p>
<p>Yato was sitting on his bed engaged in <i>astiquage</i>--the
polishing of his belts and straps.</p>
<p>Having whispered his story, punctuated with loud guffaws, to a
little knot of his friends who evidently enjoyed the joke hugely,
Klingen went over and stood in front of the Japanese, his hands
on his hips, and, rocking himself to and fro, from heels to toes,
leered exultingly. Without looking up, Yato continued waxing and
polishing a cartridge-pouch.</p>
<p>Suddenly he stopped--remained perfectly still, and stared at
the floor between himself and Klingen.</p>
<p>Beau Geste drawing near, and watching carefully as he polished
his bayonet, thought that Yato sniffed silently, as though trying
to detect and capture an odour. Yes, decided Beau, Yato could
smell something, and that something puzzled him. Rising to his
feet, his hands behind him, and moving slowly, the Japanese
approached Klingen, his head thrust forward, his nose obviously
questing.</p>
<p>"What the hell!" growled Klingen, as Yato, his face not very
much above the big man's sash, deliberately smelt at him.</p>
<p>Yato returned to his cot without remark.</p>
<p>But it seemed as though a shadow crossed his face. It was
almost as though he changed colour.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 4</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Le légionnaire</i> Klingen, smart in his walking-out kit, a
red <i>képi,</i> dark-blue tunic with green red-fringed
epaulettes, red breeches and white spats, tightened his belt a
little, pulled his bayonet frog further back, and swaggered from
the barrack-room.</p>
<p>It was "holiday" (pay-day) and he intended to expend on wine
the entire sum of 2½<i>d.</i> which he had received. Thereafter,
being full of good wine and good cheer, it was his intention to
see how the little Japanese girl was getting on, and to cheer her
loneliness with an hour of his merry society. He would watch the
yellow monkey go in, and wait till he came out, and if the girl
had locked her door, he would tap and tap and knock and knock
without saying anything until she did open it.</p>
<p>What a fighting little spit-fire she was. But that was
nine-tenths make-believe, and the other tenth was ignorance of
French.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>From his seat on a barrel, in the corner of a dark wine-shop
which commanded a view of the street in which the girl's house
stood, Klingen saw Yato approaching. Pulling down the vizor of
his <i>képi,</i> and bending his head forward, so that his face
was concealed, he waited until the Japanese had passed, and then
abandoned himself to the pleasures of drinking, anticipation, and
thoughts of revenge.</p>
<p>He was absolutely certain that the girl was Yato's, and, as he
rolled his wine upon his tongue, he rolled upon the debauched
palate of his mind the flavour of the lovely vengeance that
combined the enormous double gratification of deep enjoyment to
himself and deep injury to Yato. He honestly agreed with Klingen
that Klingen was a great man, and never greater than in this
manifestation of his skill--that made his own pleasure his
enemy's agony at a time when his enemy's agony was his own
greatest pleasure.</p>
<p>On the whole, it had turned out to be quite a good thing that
Schwartz, Brandt and Haff had declined to take any further hand
in baiting Yato. Any vengeance, obtained with their help, could
only have been crude and obvious, and have contained but the
single satisfaction of injuring Yato.</p>
<p>But this was subtle, private, worthy of Klingen.</p>
<p>"Yes, my friend," he mused, sucking the wine-drops from his
moustache. "I hurt you by delighting myself, and you add
immeasurably to that delight by being hurt."</p>
<p>And he laughed aloud.</p>
<p>A couple of thieves and their women, a fat person clothed from
head to foot in brown corduroy, and an obese dealer in old
clothes who wore a tarboosh (or fez), a frock-coat, a collarless
blue shirt, football shorts, and a pair of curly-toed slippers,
all turned to stare at the big soldier who laughed loudly at
nothing.</p>
<p>"Mad," said a thief, and shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>"Drunk," growled the other.</p>
<p>"Mad <i>and</i> drunk," said a lady.</p>
<p>"<i>Que voulez-vous? C'est la Legion!</i>" observed her sister
in joy, and drank to the health of <i>le légionnaire</i> Klingen,
in methylated spirit. As his tenth <i>caporal</i> cigarette began
to singe his moustache, and the last glass of his third bottle
began to exhibit sediment, Klingen again pulled his cap over his
eyes, and dropped his chin upon his chest. A small figure in the
uniform of the Legion was passing on the other side of the
road.</p>
<p>Two minutes later, Klingen was knocking at the door of the
room in which dwelt the Japanese girl. To his first knock no
answer was vouchsafed; to the second, a thin, high, childish
voice replied unintelligibly. It might have been in invitation or
prohibition.</p>
<p>Klingen turned the handle and, to his surprise, found that the
door was not fastened. Entering the room, he saw a little figure
on the remembered bed, its back toward him, its head and
shoulders covered by a silken shawl. Turning, he locked the door,
and slipped the key into his pocket.</p>
<p>The figure on the bed moved slightly and did not turn to
him.</p>
<p>The little hussy! What was the game?
Perhaps-I-will-perhaps-I-won't? Or was she pretending she hadn't
heard him come in? Going to make a scene, perhaps, in the hope of
extorting payment. Well, she'd be a clever girl if she got money
out of Klingen! The other way about, more likely.</p>
<p>With quickened breathing, gleaming eye, and smiling lips,
Klingen took a couple of steps in the direction of the bed, and
from it, casting off shawl and covering, sprang Yato, lightly
clad, his face devilish in its ferocity.</p>
<p>Klingen's right hand went to his bayonet and Yato's right
hand, open, shot upward, so that the bottom of the palm struck
Klingen beneath the chin. As it did so, Yato heaved mightily
upward, as though hurling a sack of potatoes which was balanced
on his hand. It was as if the Japanese lifted Klingen by the
face, and flung him backward off his feet. But even as his enemy
was in the act of falling, Yato flung his arm about him, and
turning him sideways, fell heavily with him--Klingen being face
downward. Instantly Yato, whose knee was in the small of
Klingen's back, his right hand on his neck, seized Klingen's
right wrist, and, dragging the arm upward and backward with a
swift movement, dislocated his shoulder, and, as the prostrate
man yelled in agony, Yato, with a similar movement of dexterous
and powerful leverage, dislocated the other.</p>
<p>As Klingen again roared with pain, Yato hissed like a cat,
and, with a grip of steel, dug his thumb and fingers into his
victim's neck, with a grip that changed a howl to a broken
whimper.</p>
<p>Five minutes later, Klingen's wrists were bound behind him
with steel wire, his ankles were fastened together with a strap,
and he was bound down upon the bed with a many-knotted rope, in
such a manner that he could not raise his knees, nor his head,
nor change his position by so much as an inch.</p>
<p>A large handkerchief or rag completely filled his mouth, and a
piece of steel wire, passing round his face from beneath his chin
to the top of his head, prevented him from ejecting it. In fact,
the so-recently active and joyous <i>légionnaire</i> Klingen
could now move nothing but his eyes, could only see and hear--and
suffer.</p>
<p>What was this yellow devil going to do with him? Mutilate him
as the Arabs mutilate <i>les légionnaires</i> when they fall into
their hands? And Klingen shuddered, as he thought of the
photographs that hang in every Legion barrack-room for the
discouragement of deserters . . . photographs of the remains of
things that have been men.</p>
<p>Was Yato going to carve and fillet him? Blind him? Cut his
tongue out? Torture him with a red-hot iron? Cripple him for
life? Destroy his hands, and so his livelihood? Or merely leave
him there to die a dreadful lingering death of thirst and
starvation?</p>
<p>He thought of what he himself had hoped and intended to do, if
he could have had Yato waylaid in <i>le village Nègre.</i></p>
<p>And he could not utter a word of supplication or remonstrance,
nor make offer and promise of impossible reparation and
bribe.</p>
<p>What was the cruel, wicked devil doing now? Heating an iron,
sharpening a knife, boiling some water? These cursed Japs were
artists at fiendish torture, and had a devilish ingenuity beyond
the conception of simple, honest Westerners with their kindly
hearts and generous natures.</p>
<p>What was he doing? <i>O God,</i> what <i>was</i> he doing?
Something unthinkable . . . something unimaginable.</p>
<p>But, strangely enough, Yato was merely engaged in the exercise
of one of his many peaceful and lawful pursuits. Seated
comfortably beside <i>le légionnaire</i> Klingen, to whom he
addressed no remark of any sort, he was making a selection from a
number of small objects neatly packed in a sandal-wood box. A
faint, but pleasing odour came from this; also a small oblong
cake of some black substance, in the powerful delicate fingers of
the Japanese. Taking a tiny saucer from the box, he poured into
it a little water from the flower-vase, and in this placed the
end of the black cake, that it might soak while he
dispassionately studied the contorted face of his enemy. Anon,
taking the cake in his fingers, he sketched broad lines of the
deepest black upon Klingen's forehead and cheeks. Klingen,
expecting either burn or slash, winced and shuddered as the
substance touched his face. Settling down to his work, unhurried,
methodical, and calm, Yato rubbed and dipped, rubbed and dipped,
until the face of Klingen was as black as soot--even to the
eyelids, lips, ears, and throat.</p>
<p>Having completed this portion of his task to his satisfaction,
Yato again considered the contents of the box, and selected
another small stick. With this he most carefully continued his
work, a keen and conscientious craftsman.</p>
<p>And then, changing his tools, Yato, with patient artistry,
laboured long and well, to render indelible his striking effects.
With a long-handled brush, whose bristles were needles of steel,
he tapped and tapped and tapped at forehead, cheeks and chin,
until the blood began to ooze. With separate and single needles,
he worked faithfully and well, in the places where the broader
tools would fail of full effect. . . .</p>
<p>And at last he rose, an artist satisfied, fulfilled, and gazed
upon the face of his enemy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 5</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Le légionnaire</i> Yato was not seen again in the barracks
of the Legion. But, three days later, Beau Geste received a
letter which reminded him of his promise to help his humble
Japanese comrade. All the latter had to ask was that his
honourable friend would proceed, forthwith, accompanied by his
two honourable brothers, to a described house, and there, having
asked a certain man for the key, go to room No. 7, and give
freedom and assistance to an unfortunate man confined therein.
Should they fail to do this, the poor fellow would starve to
death. . . .</p>
<p>Michael, Digby and John did as they were asked.</p>
<p>"<i>Good God!</i> Yato!" ejaculated Michael, as they gazed
upon Klingen.</p>
<p>"The wicked <i>devil!</i>" murmured John.</p>
<p>"What they call a 'gentleman of colour,'" observed
Digby,--for, until the worms devoured it, the whole face of
Klingen would be a deep blue-black, save for the nose of glowing
red.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c203" id="c203"><i>David And His Incredible
Jonathan</i></a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>"Ready, pup?" inquired Michael Geste, turning to where his
brother John was endeavouring satisfactorily to arrange his hair
by means of a brush originally intended for quite other purposes,
and a mirror so small that the work had, as Digby observed, to be
done by sections--if not by numbers.</p>
<p>As the three brothers looked each other over, in turn, with a
view to avoiding unpleasantness at the gates, where a crapulous
and arbitrary Sergeant of the Guard would turn them back if it
were possible to find the slightest fault with their appearance,
La Cigale approached them.</p>
<p>La Cigale, the Grasshopper, a nobleman of ancient family and
once an officer of the Belgian Corps of Guides, was a kind and
gentle madman, whose mental affliction had hitherto in no way
interfered with his soldiering. At times he was quite mad, and at
others appeared quite sane.</p>
<p>Returning to the depôt at Sidi-bel-Abbès, from a long tour of
foreign service, he had re-enlisted for the third time, a veteran
soldier <i>de carrière.</i> With the Geste boys he was a
favourite, as well as a source of wonder, admiration and respect.
Michael said he was not only a noble, but one of Nature's
noblemen, as well as one of God's own gentlemen; Digby said he
reminded him of himself; and John, that he was about the most
lovable and pathetic thing in human form.</p>
<p>And he had been for fifteen years a private soldier of the
Legion!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Are you gentlemen going anywhere in particular?" asked La
Cigale with his pleasant, friendly smile.</p>
<p>"No," replied Michael, "just going to walk abroad, and give
the public a treat."</p>
<p>"You were going alone, of course, a single and indivisible
trinity."</p>
<p>"We were," admitted Michael, "but we should be delighted if
you would care to join us."</p>
<p>"Charmed," murmured Digby and John.</p>
<p>"Thank you so very much," replied La Cigale. "I'm sure that
you mean what you say, and that your politeness is not hollow. .
. . Had you not invited me, I was going to summon up courage to
ask if I might come with you to-night. . . . I am
frightened."</p>
<p>The brothers glanced at the old soldier's <i>Croix de Guerre,
Médaille Militaire,</i> and other medals, with incredulous
smiles.</p>
<p>"And of what is the <i>doyen</i> of the First Battalion of the
First Regiment of the Legion afraid?" asked Michael.</p>
<p>"Of loneliness," was the reply, "and of myself. It is terrible
to be utterly lonely in the midst of such a crowded life as this,
and it is even more terrible to be afraid of oneself--afraid of
what one may do. I am haunted by the dread of doing something
awful, horrible, disgraceful, and knowing nothing about it until
it is too late. And I get these attacks--I can't describe them. I
have one coming on now. Every nerve in the body tingles and
burns, from the brain to the finger-tips and toes. Every cell in
the body shrieks and screams, and I must do something, <i>do</i>
something--something drastic, and do it instantly. But what that
something is, I do not know. It is agony unspeakable. I would
sooner have a dozen wounds."</p>
<p>"Come for a walk and a talk," interrupted Michael Geste, as La
Cigale paused. It was obvious that the less he thought about
himself the better.</p>
<p>"Let's go and find a quiet spot in the Gardens, and perhaps
you'll give us the pleasure and benefit of hearing of some of
your campaigning experiences? We should like to follow in your
footsteps, you know."</p>
<p>"Rather," agreed Digby, "and get as many decorations among the
three of us."</p>
<p>"Regard us as your sons, sir, and take us in hand," murmured
John.</p>
<p>The quartette set forth, saluted the Sergeant of the Guard,
and found themselves safely in the lane that separates the
Legion's Barracks from those of the Spahis.</p>
<p>Having induced La Cigale to share a light and not wholly
inelegant meal at the <i>Café de l'Europe,</i> Michael Geste
proposed that they should adjourn and listen to the Legion's band
as it played in the public Gardens.</p>
<p>"For myself--I dare not," replied La Cigale. "At times music
has a terrible effect upon me. If they were to play a selection
from a certain opera that was world-famous when I was a young
man, I should go mad. I should completely lose control of . .
."</p>
<p>"Then let's go and sit on a seat in the moonlight, and you
shall talk to us. We should enjoy that far more," said Michael
quickly. "Come along."</p>
<p>"Not in the moonlight," objected La Cigale, "if you don't
mind. Some nice dark place in deep shadow. I think moonlight is
terrible--such memories."</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>"I can't tell you how delightful it is to me, to know you,"
said La Cigale, as they seated themselves on a bench in a dark
corner of the Gardens. "Gentlemen and Englishmen. I've always
been fond of the English. There was an astonishingly delightful
Englishman here, who was a friend of mine for years. Killed
trying to escape, with two compatriots--one of them a charming
fellow--and a very attractive American.</p>
<p>"Then there was poor young Edwards--yes, he called himself
Edwards, I remember."</p>
<p>"And what became of him?" asked Michael, as La Cigale fell
into reminiscent silence.</p>
<p>"To young Edwards? Oh, it was a terrible tragedy. I will tell
you."</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 2</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"David Edwards, as he called himself, joined the Legion some
years ago, and was one of the most puzzling of the many people
whose presence in the Legion is a puzzle to all who know
them.</p>
<p>"He was one of the nicest fellows I've ever known, and it was
impossible to suppose that he had left his country for his
country's good, or had chosen the Legion as a refuge. It was
quite obvious that it was not poverty nor vice, crime, debt,
disgrace nor anything of that kind, that had been the cause of
his coming here. Nor did he strike one as being of the born
soldier type--one of those men who are cut out for a military
career, and are fitted for no other. And he wasn't one of the
wildly adventurous sort, mad-cap and hare-brained. It was my good
fortune to be put in charge of him when he arrived, that I might
show him the ropes, and instruct him as to <i>astiquage,
paquetage</i> and so forth.</p>
<p>"We had much in common, including one or two acquaintances,
for I knew the part of England from which he came, and he knew
Brussels, where his father, evidently in the Diplomatic Service,
had been stationed.</p>
<p>"He was extremely kind and friendly to me, but his <i>real</i>
friend, pal, and <i>copain</i> was, extraordinarily enough, an
astounding rascal of the name of Jean Molle.</p>
<p>"It was indeed a case of the attraction of opposites, for this
man Molle was all that Edwards was not--the one a gutter-bred
rough, the other a public-school man of family and
refinement.</p>
<p>"It was really interesting to watch these two, and try to
discover what it was in each that interested the other. One would
have supposed that Edwards would only have seen in Molle a coarse
ignorant ruffian, devoid alike of manners and morals, and that
Molle would have seen in Edwards a white-handed, finnicking fine
gentleman, full of irritating affectations and superiorities.</p>
<p>"Molle, who had been a Paris market-porter at his best, and a
foot-pad <i>apache</i> at his worst, was a huge powerful person
of most violent temper, and an uncontrollable addiction to drink.
But he was droll, I must admit--really very funny when half-sober
or half-drunk, and a born mimic, clown, and buffoon. I should
think that he must have been attached to a circus in some such
capacity, or perhaps was born in one, and he made David Edwards
laugh--laugh until the tears ran down his face, and he had to beg
Molle to stop impersonating a <i>curé,</i> a <i>cocotte,</i> a
Colonel, an old market-woman, a Sergeant-Major, or whatever it
might be.</p>
<p>"Yes, Molle was very good for Edwards from that point of view,
for he kept the Englishman laughing--and laughter is the salt of
life, both as savour and a preservative. And, of course, Edwards
did not understand the vileness of one half of Molle's remarks,
spoken in his almost incomprehensible and wholly untranslatable
<i>argot</i> of the slums and <i>halles</i> of Paris.</p>
<p>"And Edwards was good for Molle in every possible way, and
gave the creature ideas such as he had never before dreamed of,
standards and ideals hitherto unglimpsed by this sewer-rat.</p>
<p>"Surely a more ill-assorted pair never foregathered, even in
the Foreign Legion. I think Edwards grew quite fond of Molle, as
the benefactor often does grow fond of the beneficiary, and
undoubtedly Molle really loved David Edwards. He would have
thrashed anyone who said a word against him, and killed anyone
who injured him.</p>
<p>"They quarrelled, of course--as friends must do--generally on
the subject of Molle's drunkenness and debauchery. He was one of
those <i>canaille</i> who simply must, from time to time, give
way to the demands of their gross appetites, slink into some
horrible hole, and drink themselves insensible.</p>
<p>"Edwards was really wonderful when his friend eluded him and
got drunk. He would go from wine-shop to wine-shop in the Spanish
quarter, search the houses that are in bounds for troops, ransack
<i>le village Nègre</i> itself, and when successful, be rewarded
by a torrent of oaths and a drunken blow. Time after time he was
punished with <i>salle de police</i> for coming in late,
supporting his drunken friend, whom, for hours, he had been
trying to get back to Barracks.</p>
<p>"Never did he desert the drunken brute, even though it meant
being out the whole night and returning too late for parade, but
not too soon for severe punishment.</p>
<p>"I myself, when on guard, have seen them at the gate in the
small hours of the morning--Edwards, who was a teetotaller, by
the way, bleeding about the face, and with torn and muddied
uniform, supporting and endeavouring to control the singing,
shouting, raving Molle, and striving to prevent him from
assaulting the Sergeant and resisting the Guard.</p>
<p>"After these disgusting, disgraceful affairs, Molle would be
tearfully repentant, grovelling in apology, and loud in
self-accusation and promises of reform, and for a time he would
behave well, would walk out with Edwards and return quiet, clean,
sober and punctual for roll-call.</p>
<p>"Nevertheless he was always extremely dangerous after one of
these orgies, for his terrible temper would be in a highly
explosive condition--a thing not to be wondered at, in view of
the fact that he had consumed gallons of assorted alcohol, and
been knocked on the head when fighting like a wild beast to
prevent being thrown into the <i>salle de police.</i></p>
<p>"I never ceased to admire the moral and physical courage with
which Edwards would come between Molle and his desires when the
evil fit was on him, and tackle him when he was in the surly and
quarrelsome stages of drunkenness. Undoubtedly, Edwards saved
Molle from three times as much imprisonment as he got, and Molle
was the cause of practically every punishment awarded to
Edwards.</p>
<p>"Can you understand such a friendship between two such
men--between a cultured man of breeding and a dissolute brute
like Molle? But there it was. And the only explanation I can
offer, is that Edwards imagined himself more or less responsible
for this creature who had attached himself to him as a stray and
homeless mongrel dog will attach himself to a man, and who loved
him as such a dog will do.</p>
<p>"Some men will risk their lives to save a dog, and thereafter
be very fond of it, and I suppose it was in some such spirit that
Edwards risked his life in <i>le village Nègre,</i> and his
peace, prospects and reputation in the Legion--and became fond of
the dog Molle.</p>
<p>"And then one night the tragedy occurred, strangely, suddenly
and unexpectedly, as tragedy does occur.</p>
<p>"Molle had been drinking. After evening <i>soupe</i> he had
evaded Edwards, slipped out by himself, and gone to drink in a
low wine-shop. Unfortunately he had not the money to buy enough
liquor to make himself drunk, but merely sufficient to see him
through the successive stages of hilarity and despondency into
that of a quarrelsome moroseness.</p>
<p>"Making his way back to Barracks when his money was gone, and
carrying, with the air of a dour teetotaller, enough assorted
liquor to intoxicate half a dozen, he strode past the Guard Room
across the Parade Ground, and up to his Barrack Room. Here he sat
himself down in morose and sulky silence, and sullenly cleaned
and polished his kit.</p>
<p>"As he sat, gloomy, heavy and repellent, a dangerous and ugly
customer to tackle, Edwards came into the room. He was wearing
walking-out kit and overcoat.</p>
<p>"'Oh, there you are,' he cried, on catching sight of Molle.
'I've been looking for you everywhere.'</p>
<p>"'Am I a dog that I should be hunted? And by a thing like
you?' growled Molle, glaring angrily at Edwards.</p>
<p>"'Yes,' replied Edwards pleasantly. 'A dirty dog,' and strode
across to where Molle sat.</p>
<p>"'Oh! I am a dirty dog, am I?' muttered Molle quietly, without
looking up.</p>
<p>"'Regular mongrel,' agreed Edwards, 'but full of clever
tricks. . . . Sit up and beg. . . . Up, Fido! Beg, Fido!'</p>
<p>"Molle rose to his feet obedient--and spat in Edwards'
face.</p>
<p>"I told you he was a creature of pleasant habits! And I told
you Edwards was brave.</p>
<p>"Although Molle was about twice his size, and four times as
strong, he let drive instantly with all his strength and landed
Molle as fine a smack in the eye as ever I saw a man receive.</p>
<p>"Molle struck back, hitting Edwards with such force that both
he and Edwards fell to the ground.</p>
<p>"At that moment there was a cry of '<i>Fixe!</i>' and every
one sprang to attention, as our Major came into the room. Molle,
full of liquor though he was, scrambled to his feet, and stood
like a statue at the foot of his bed, steady as a rock.</p>
<p>"Edwards lay where he was--on his face--gasping and
coughing.</p>
<p>"'<i>What's this, then?</i>' snapped the Major, a man who was
always in a terrific hurry. He occasionally made these sudden
inspection raids, and indiscriminately dealt out severe
punishments to all and sundry.</p>
<p>"Edwards gasped, groaned, and partly raised himself on his
right elbow.</p>
<p>"'I am drunk,' he said clearly, and collapsed.</p>
<p>"'Drunk and fighting in the Barrack Room,' shouted the Major.
'Assaulting your comrades. No one else here is drunk. A drunken,
quarrelsome disturber of discipline. . . .'</p>
<p>"And more of the same sort of thing, ending up with an order
that the drunkard should be removed immediately and thrown into
prison.</p>
<p>"'He is not drunk, <i>Monsieur le Majeur,</i>' interrupted
Molle, stepping forward and saluting. 'It is I.'</p>
<p>"'Four days' cells for daring to address me, for contradiction
and attempted interruption of the course of justice,' roared the
incensed officer, as soon as he recovered from his shocked
surprise at Molle's temerity.</p>
<p>"I would have spoken up for Edwards myself, but for the
absolute certainty that I should also incur a sentence of
imprisonment without the slightest possibility of doing him any
good. Quite the contrary, in all probability.</p>
<p>"Edwards, really looking the part of a quarrelsome drunkard
who had been badly knocked about, was carried off and dumped in a
cell, while Molle was led away to the <i>salle de police.</i></p>
<p>"That night I was on guard, and as it happened, it was I who
first entered Edwards' cell in the morning, to take him the loaf
of bread and drop of water that would be his food for the day. He
was lying face downward on the dirty floor, his left arm bent
beneath him, and his right extended, the hand touching the wall
of the cell. Just above it, I could see, in the dim light, smears
and smudges, such as might have been made by a child playing with
a house-painter's brush on which still remained a very little
half-dried red paint.</p>
<p>"Just so might a little girl, named Susan, have tried to write
her name upon the wall--for the first smeared hieroglyphic was a
crude but unmistakable <i>S,</i> followed by what was almost
certainly the letter <i>U.</i></p>
<p>"A finger, dipped in blood, had made the rough double curve
that was an S, had twice made a stroke beside it, and, when a
little more of the slow and painful medium was available, had
joined the bases of the strokes with a curve.</p>
<p>"I saw this much, at a glance, as I knelt to do what I could
for John Edwards. He was quite dead, and had obviously died from
loss of blood, after having stabbed himself, or having been
stabbed, in the left breast.</p>
<p>"Yes, my friend was dead; I could not be mistaken as to
that--I who have seen so many die.</p>
<p>"I looked again at the wall. '<i>SU</i>' he had painfully
scrawled while still comparatively strong. I think he had then
fainted, or perhaps had waited. . . .</p>
<p>"So much of the blood had been absorbed by his clothing, and
the pad he had made with his neck-cloth.</p>
<p>"Oh yes, he had done his best, poor boy, but had probably
grown too weak to do any more for himself than to staunch the
flow of blood.</p>
<p>"Yes, as I read the signs, he had fainted, had revived, and
realized that he was dying; had painfully scrawled the first two
letters, and had then collapsed--probably through fresh
hæmorrhage caused by the effort.</p>
<p>"For there was a space after the <i>U,</i> and then a straight
stroke, followed by a curved one. Near the top of this was a
single finger-print. Evidently, with failing sight and ebbing
strength, he had tried to make this curve into the letter
<i>C,</i> and, ere the heavy hand fell from the wall, he had
smeared the beginning of another stroke.</p>
<p>"'<i>SUICI</i>' had been accomplished, and he had then either
rested from these last labours of his brief life, or had again
been overcome by that dreadful sinking faintness that attacks us
as the life-stream ebbs from wounds.</p>
<p>"Once again he had recovered. This time he had made a mighty
effort, and had been but too well provided with the dreadful
medium in which he worked.</p>
<p>"Below the other letters, and a foot to the right of them,
shakily but clearly were written the final <i>D</i> and
<i>E.</i></p>
<p>"<i>Suicide!</i></p>
<p>"<i>Why?</i> And with what weapon. And where was it?</p>
<p>"He was not wearing his bayonet, of course. Had he a dagger or
clasp-knife which he had returned to its place of concealment,
after inflicting upon himself a death-wound? And if so, why?</p>
<p>"And then again, why spend his last minutes of terrible
agony--as he lay upon the very brink of the grave, and imminent
dissolution was upon him, in such work? Why, I asked myself,
should he have been at such pains--such unthinkable pains--to
smear this dreadful writing on the wall, in his own
life-blood?</p>
<p>"When a <i>légionnaire</i> commits suicide, he commits
suicide, and there's an end of it. He doesn't trouble to write
about it. It is obvious. If he should have anything to record
about his death, he would write it before killing himself,
wouldn't he?</p>
<p>"Reverently I assured myself of the fact that he had no
concealed knife or dagger, and then that there was, in the cell,
absolutely nothing of any sort or kind with which he could have
inflicted this wound upon himself. A man cannot give himself a
neat and clean stab, three quarters of an inch long, a quarter of
an inch wide, and deep enough to kill him, without a knife, or
something that can be used as a knife blade.</p>
<p>"Men have hanged themselves with their braces, strangled
themselves with their bootlaces, opened veins and arteries with a
nail, and battered their heads against their cell walls. There is
always a way for a determined man to put an end to himself, but
he can't fatally stab himself--without at least a piece of glass,
or of hard and pointed wood.</p>
<p>"Could David Edwards have had an enemy who had entered his
cell and murdered him during the night?</p>
<p>"Absurd nonsense! How could such a man get into the cell,
unless it were the Sergeant of the Guard himself? And, if a
prisoner were murdered in this way, would he write
'<i>Suicide</i>' upon the wall as he died?</p>
<p>"It has taken me some time to tell you all this, but I don't
suppose it took a second for these thoughts to flash through my
mind.</p>
<p>"And then I decided that when a man, at such terrible cost,
proclaims the fact that he has committed suicide, he has almost
certainly not committed suicide at all, and of course I was
confirmed in this belief by my absolute certainty that there was
nothing in the cell with which he could have stabbed himself.</p>
<p>"Although I knew that it was perfectly useless to do so, I
opened the door of the cell, and examined the floor of the narrow
passage outside. As you may not be aware, those beastly cells
have no window, grating, nor aperture communicating with the open
air. There is nothing but the grating above the door that opens
into the passage. It was just conceivably possible that Edwards
had stabbed himself with a knife, and had then contrived to throw
it between the bars of the grating, so that it fell in the
passage without.</p>
<p>"Apart from the fact that this would be an extremely difficult
thing to do, and that the sentry would hear the knife fall, why
should a suicide do such a thing, particularly when he intended
to take the trouble to proclaim the fact that it was suicide?</p>
<p>"Surely it would be obvious enough that he had taken his own
life, if the knife were found lying beside him, or gripped in his
hand, or sticking in his chest. On what conceivable grounds
should a man, after inflicting a mortal wound upon himself,
proclaim the fact of suicide and carefully conceal the means
whereby it was effected?</p>
<p>"Life has presented me with some sore puzzles, my friends, but
I think this was the most insoluble problem with which I had been
confronted.</p>
<p>"Well, there it was, in all its stark simplicity of fact.
Edwards was dead, with a stab near the heart; there was no knife
or other weapon in the place, and he had written the word
'<i>Suicide</i>' in his own blood.</p>
<p>"And there it was in all its bewildering complexity, its
incredibility, its sinister insoluble impossibility. And there I
left it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I reported to the Sergeant of the Guard that the prisoner in
No. 1 had committed suicide.</p>
<p>"The body was carried to the hospital for autopsy, and thence
to the mortuary, in the kind of coffin they give the
<i>légionnaire.</i></p>
<p>"Next day, David Edwards was buried in the Cemetery of the
Legion, and doubtless one can still find his grave--for it became
rather famous, and probably the <i>légionnaire-</i>pensioner in
charge of the Cemetery looks after it. In the past he must have
made quite a few <i>sous</i> by exhibiting it.</p>
<p>"No, it was not the mystery attaching to the death of Edwards
that made his grave a nine days' wonder. No one takes much notice
of the suicide of a <i>légionnaire,</i> however interestingly he
made contrive his death.</p>
<p>"It was what happened, a week after he had been buried."</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 3</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"When Molle came out of prison, his first thought was of his
friend, and he hurried in search of him. I was in the Barrack
Room when he entered, looking all the worse for his term of
<i>cellule</i> punishment.</p>
<p>"He stared in astonishment at seeing another man sitting on
Edwards' cot and obviously occupying his place.</p>
<p>"'<i>Here, you</i>--<i>where's Edwards?</i>' he said,
approaching the new-comer, a big Alsatian named Gronau.</p>
<p>"'Dead and buried,' growled the fellow, with an ugly
laugh.</p>
<p>"Molle planted himself in front of Gronau, his big hands
tense, flexed, about to clutch. . . .</p>
<p>"'<i>Where's Edwards?</i> I asked you,' he said.</p>
<p>"I got up with some idea of getting Molle away, but Gronau
answered again,</p>
<p>"'<i>Dead,</i> I tell you! . . . Dead and buried. Dead and
damned.'</p>
<p>"And Molle sprang upon him, literally like a wild beast.</p>
<p>"It took half a dozen of us to get him off Gronau before he
had choked the life out of him.</p>
<p>"The Alsatian, although a big powerful fellow, was like a
child in the hands of Molle.</p>
<p>"We got him down and held him down, and for a time it was more
like holding a horse than a man.</p>
<p>"Then suddenly he fell quiet, as though all his strength had
gone out of him. And it had.</p>
<p>"His attack on Gronau was his last activity--his last effort,
if you understand me.</p>
<p>"He had grasped the fact that David Edwards was dead, and it
broke him, mentally and physically. Yes, that is what he was, a
broken man--heart-broken and broken in spirit.</p>
<p>"For a few days he moved about, doing things automatically. He
reminded me of those stories, that one has heard and read, of the
dog that loses its master and straightway loses all interest in
life, refuses food and pines and droops. Sometimes such a dog
will go and lie upon its master's grave and refuse to be
moved.</p>
<p>"Such a dog was Molle.</p>
<p>"He never spoke: he never smiled; scarcely did he raise his
eyes from the ground. He did not sleep; he did not eat, and,
marvellously, he did not drink.</p>
<p>"What would one have expected such a creature to do? Obviously
to drink himself to death.</p>
<p>"Granted that he were sufficiently human and humane to have
been capable of such a love, one would have supposed its effect
would have been a plunge into the depths of debauchery, a
drowning of sorrow in drink. Surely, nine times out of ten, a man
of this type would seek the only anodyne he knows, his accustomed
way of escape from reality.</p>
<p>"But no! this astonishing Jonathan took the loss of his David
differently, and the debauché became the ascetic, instead of
submerging his troubled soul beneath a sea of alcohol.</p>
<p>"I tried to get <i>en rapport</i> with him.</p>
<p>"He did not so much repulse me as fail to realize me. I made
no impression upon him, and nothing that I said appeared to reach
his mind. I think that was wholly unreceptive, as though it had
frozen into a solid block of fact--one dreadful fact--<i>My
friend is dead.</i></p>
<p>"One day I said to him, 'Look here, Molle. If you don't eat
you'll die. Even <i>your</i> strength can't last much longer.
Come out with me to-night. We'll have supper together in some
nice quiet place.'</p>
<p>"'<i>Eh?</i>' he replied.</p>
<p>"And when I had repeated what I had said, he again murmured,
'<i>Eh?</i>'--and that was as far as I could get with him.</p>
<p>"I completely failed to make him realize that I, more than any
man, could understand how he suffered. I, who had lost every one
and everything; I, whose mind, like his, had suddenly died.</p>
<p>"With a word of sympathy on my lips, and genuine sorrow in my
heart, I turned and left him.</p>
<p>"But I spoke to him once again, and got an answer.</p>
<p>"For my evening walk, I strolled to the cemetery to visit the
grave of David Edwards, just to lay a flower and say a word of
farewell to a dead comrade.</p>
<p>"A foolish thing, of course, and one I often wonder at--this
connecting of the freed and soaring spirit with the poor
corrupting clay, and its last resting-place.</p>
<p>"But poor humanity must have its concrete symbols. . . .</p>
<p>"And there was Jean Molle before me lying prone upon the
grave.</p>
<p>"I went to raise him up. His left hand was buried quite deeply
into the ground, and in his right hand was the knife with which
he had stabbed himself.</p>
<p>"As I turned him over, to see if anything could yet be done to
save him, I saw that the hand that had been buried clutched an
earth-stained letter.</p>
<p>"'What has happened?' I asked, bewildered.</p>
<p>"Molle opened his eyes.</p>
<p>"'I cannot get it down to him,' he moaned. . . . 'Oh, David,
my friend, my friend! . . . I did not mean to do it. . . . Can
you hear me, David, and will you believe me? . . . I did not even
know that <i>a knife was in my hand,</i> when you came to me that
last night in the barrack-room, and I struck you, David. . .
.'</p>
<p>"I tried to stanch the blood that flowed from his bared
breast.</p>
<p>"'<i>Get him the letter</i>,' he whispered, 'I <i>cannot reach
to</i> . . .' and died.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I buried the letter. . . . Doubtless Edwards received it. . .
."</p>

<p> </p>
<p>"I say, citizens," quoth Digby Geste, as his brothers entered
the barrack-room, "Ludwig'll . . ."</p>
<p>"Ludwiggle?" enquired Michael. "Who's he?"</p>
<p>Digby sighed. "As I was about to say, Ludwig'll . . ."</p>
<p>"You <i>did</i> say Ludwiggle," pointed out John.</p>
<p>Digby ignored his younger brother.</p>
<p>Addressing Michael he said firmly, "Ludwig'll . . ."</p>
<p>"He's got this Ludwiggle on the brain," observed Michael.
"What's his surname--Hornswoggle?"</p>
<p>"Yes, obviously; what else could it be?" accommodated Digby in
a soothing voice, and continued, "Well, Ludwig Hornswoggle'll
clean our kit to-night. In fact he's very keen on getting the
job, and keener still on the threepence he'll earn by it.
Thinking of marrying, I believe, and wants to get a few sticks of
furniture for the home."</p>
<p>"Good for Ludwiggle," agreed Michael. "We'll go to Mustapha's
and improve the shining hour, and our shining Arabic."</p>
<p><i>Le légionnaire</i> Ludwig Müller alias Hornswoggle, having
received payment in advance and a promise that it would be
recovered if the work were not satisfactorily done, settled down
to the evening's labour, as the boys, having brushed each other's
coats, took their caps.</p>
<p>"Good-bye, Ludwiggle," observed Michael, as they left the
barrack-room. "You speak English, don't you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, I speak it much," replied Müller. "I haf been
waiter in London."</p>
<p>"'<i>Thig or glear?</i>'" murmured Digby.</p>
<p>"Well then," replied Michael, "you will achieve a just and
accurate perception of what I would fain indicate when I say that
you have had payment <i>a priori,</i> and if we are unable to
approve the result of your industry and application, both
intensive and extensive, you'll get some <i>a posteriori</i>
too."</p>
<p>"Yes, and <i>a forteriori</i> also, Ludwiggle. Now excogitate
the esoteric implications of those few ill-chosen words."</p>
<p>Ludwig Müller grinned and waggled his hands.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 2</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Good heavens, listen," said Michael, suddenly seizing the
arms of his brothers, between whom he was walking, as they passed
a low café in the Spanish quarter.</p>
<p>"Rough-house," observed Digby, as a man came flying backward
through the doorway. "That is what the instructed call being
thrown out on your ear," observed John.</p>
<p>"I thought I heard English," said Michael.</p>
<p>"Scotch," said Digby, "or did I smell it?"</p>
<p>"Only the soda," corrected John. . . . "By Jove, it <i>is</i>
English," he added, as a bull voice roared above the din.</p>
<p>"Is there a man among ye has the Gaelic? . . . Is there a man
among ye can speak English even? . . . Is there a man among ye at
all? Ye gang o' lasceevious auld de'ils, decked oot like weemin'
in spite o' yer hairy long whuskers, full beards and full skirts,
ye deceitful besoms. Whuskers and petticoats wi' the vices o'
both and the virtues o' neither. <i>I'</i>ll sorrt ye."</p>
<p>And there were sounds of alarums and excursions within.</p>
<p>The door opened, and a <i>légionnaire</i> came out laughing--a
Frenchman called Blanc, once a Captain in his country's
Mercantile Marine.</p>
<p>"Ho, ho, <i>ce bon</i> McSnorrt," he chuckled.</p>
<p>"Hullo, there's a compatriot of yours in there," he added, on
catching sight of the brothers. "Perhaps you could get him back
to Barracks. I can't. He's not coming out of there till some one
speaks to him in Gaelic, has danced the sword-dance or sung a
<i>Chanson Écosse</i> about Scots who have bled at the same time
and place as Monsieur Guillaume Wallace."</p>
<p>Blanc laughed again.</p>
<p>"He's taken a dislike to Arabs, Jews and Spaniards to-night,
because they can't talk Gaelic, and he'll kill a few in there
unless they kill him first. . . . Well, I've done my best with
the old fool."</p>
<p>A few questions elicited the information that <i>ce bon</i>
McSnorrt was a Scot with a perfectly unpronounceable name--really
more a sneeze than a name, explained Blanc,--something between
McIlwraith and Colquohoun, who had, long ago, been re-named
"McSnorrt" by an English <i>légionnaire</i> calling himself Jean
Boule. He had taken his discharge three times, and each time had
re-enlisted destitute, after a period of peace, retrenchment, and
reform, during which he had, according to his own account, been
Chief Engineer on great liners.</p>
<p>Apparently he was the pride and joy of his officers in the day
of battle, and their despair, disgrace and utter curse, in the
piping times of peace. On more than one occasion, nothing but his
decorations and glorious fighting record could have saved him
from the Zephyrs or a firing-party. According to Blanc, he had
been very bad in the days of his friend Jean Boule, and ten times
worse since the removal, by the hand of death, of that
gentleman's restraining influence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Followed by his brothers, Beau Geste pushed open the door and
entered the wine-shop.</p>
<p>Brandishing an empty bottle, a red man--red of hair, beard,
nose and eye--enormous and powerfully built, was threatening an
audience of grave and wondering Arabs and grinning, sneering, or
scowling Spaniards, Jews, and nondescripts, while he bitterly and
passionately harangued them on the shortcomings, impropriety, and
general unsuitability of native dress; on their inability to sing
the songs that he approved, and their complete ignorance of
Gaelic.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as his address concluded with the firm assurance that
no man should leave the building until he had cast off his
unseemly garb, danced a sword-dance, sung "Annie Laurie," and
spoken Gaelic, there appeared to be every probability of serious
trouble.</p>
<p>Even as the boys entered, a big, powerful, and
truculent-looking Spaniard set down his glass with a loud bang on
the zinc bar, lit a cigarette, spat in the direction of the
self-constituted censor of local morals, manners and customs, and
strode toward the door.</p>
<p>As the McSnorrt gripped him by the arm, he whipped out a
knife. Quick as he was, the drunken Scot was quicker. Seizing the
upraised hand, the McSnorrt forced the man's arm downward and
backward, and then, with a mighty heave and lift, swung round and
flung him, like a sack of straw, against the swing-doors--and the
subsequent proceedings interested him no more.</p>
<p>There was a general movement and ugly murmurings, as knives
were drawn and empty bottles seized, preparatory to a concerted
rush.</p>
<p>"Speak Gaelic, ye ignorant and contumeelious spawn of Gehenna,
ye dommed dirrty, degraded, derelict descendants o' the Duke of
Hell," roared the McSnorrt, in reply to cries of "Stab him," "Get
behind him," or "Throw a knife in his ear," and general
exhortations of all to sundry that they should do drastic things
with promptitude and despatch.</p>
<p>"Hi, comrade, hae ye the Gaelic yersel'?" shouted Michael, as
he thrust through the encircling company of murderous
blackguards, choice specimens of a cosmopolitan and criminal
underworld.</p>
<p>"Not a worrd, laddie, an' I was never further norrth, ye'll
ken, than my ain fair city o' Glesgie. Not a worrd, an' I doot if
ever I hearrd one. . . . But the soond of yon lovely tongue wad
be sweeter in ma ears than that o' the bonnie pibroch itself. . .
. Oh, to hear the skirrl o' the bonnie, bonnie bag-pipes, playing
'Lochaber no more,' or the 'Flowers of the Forest' in this
meeserable land o' dule and drought. No, I hae na the Gaelic, but
I'm goin' to hearr it the nicht. An' no man leaves this den o'
thieves until I do, yersel's included."</p>
<p>"Then listen," replied Michael, "listen, my little one, and
you shall hear," and in fluent Arabic he continued, "You are a
filthy drunken disgrace to the most decent, self-respecting,
thrifty and sober people in the world. You are a noisy ruffian,
debauched, beastly and detestable, a shame and a reproach to the
white race, and to the Foreign Legion."</p>
<p>Michael paused for breath.</p>
<p>"How did you like that?" he inquired. "Pretty good Gaelic,
eh?"</p>
<p>"Graand, man! Gie's your hand. Och, the bonnie, bonnie Gaelic.
It minds me o' when I was a wee laddie, and paddled i' the burrn.
. . . Or the Clyde at Greenock, anyhow."</p>
<p>And the McSnorrt swallowed hard.</p>
<p>"Oh, cheer up, wee Macgreegor," begged Digby. "Listen."</p>
<p>And at the top of his voice he tunefully declared that
Maxwellton's braes were bonnie.</p>
<p>Scarcely had he uttered the name of Miss Laurie, and the gift
of her promise true, than the McSnorrt burst into tears, and was
led weeping away--away back to Barracks, to the strains of "Loch
Lomond," and the promptings of a somewhat vituperative-seeming
Gaelic.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 3</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Every fifth day is "pay-day," the great day when a soldier of
the Legion has five <i>sous</i> to spend, and can spend it with
untrammelled recklessness.</p>
<p>It was a Fifth Day at eventide, and the McSnorrt, established
as usual in the Canteen, was rapidly recovering from the drear
and dreadful drought of the four previous days, when chill penury
failed to repress his noble rage.</p>
<p>Warmed by wine, the McSnorrt was expanding, mellowing and
waxing genial, shedding moroseness like a garment, and finding
joy, relief, and satisfaction in self-expression. Speech bubbled
up within this usually inarticulate man, and he spake with
tongues; also he remembered his love of the Gaelic, as he caught
sight of the three boys who had come to his rescue in the
wineshop last pay-day.</p>
<p>With a roar and a shout and a wave of one mighty paw, while
the other banged a bottle heavily upon the table, he attracted
the attention of the Geste brothers and bade them come, and in
return for their Gaelic, hear words of wisdom and delight from a
great and good man who had drunk exactly 3,000 gallons of whisky
before the three of them had been born.</p>
<p>Nothing loth, the brothers gathered round the veteran
reprobate, a man with a vivid imagination, an inexhaustible fund
of strange experience, and, on the rare occasions when not
possessed of a dumb devil, a copious flow of potent speech.</p>
<p>Ere long, the party was joined by Maris and Cordier, friends
of the brothers, and practised users of the English tongue.</p>
<p>Michael, Digby and John, finishing a brief argument as to
whether one Robinson, the Carven-Faced Man, should be written
down a liar, and if not, should be esteemed something of a knave,
were anon aware that the McSnorrt, ancient mariner that he was,
had fixed them with a glittering eye and was unfolding a round,
if not unvarnished, tale of which they had missed the
beginning.</p>
<p>"Aye . . . aye, this Mr. Bute-Arrol was a well-kenned and
highly respected man. Last of a great shipping firm he was, and
an ornament to Glasgow as he walked aboot it, a fine big
upstanding man with the sea in his eyes, and the sun-bronze on
his face.</p>
<p>"More like a ship's captain than a shipping-owner, he was, and
well he might be, for he had sailed the seven seas, and travelled
far and wide. Aye, and Mr. Bute-Arrol, partner in the Bell,
Brown, Scott and Bute-Arrol's 'Loch' Line, was a man of parrts
and education. . . . Hobbies he had. . . . Nane of yer fule
hobbies o' collectin' stamps, or moths, or trouser-buttons, or
doin' fret-work or photography, but scienteefic and literary, ye
ken.</p>
<p>"And, I say, scienteefic. There was botany and orchids, that
cost him a fortune, from South America to New Guinea, and trees
and shrubs in his grounds such as ye'd have to go to Kew Gardens
to see the like of.</p>
<p>"And then there was zoology and all sorts of weird beasties,
snakes and lizards and fishes, chameleons and similar molluscs,
and brachycephalous orrnithorhincusses; marvellous-coloured bugs,
beetles, salamanders, iguanas and all such-like lepidoptera and
hagiologies. He'd got conservatories and an aviary and an
insect-house and a reptile-house, all kept as warm as the tropics
while Christians went blue-nosed with the Glasgow east wind and
whisky.</p>
<p>"Aye, he was a man of interests, this Mr. Bute-Arrol, and
three of his greatest were early gold coins, scarce First
Editions of bukes, and rare poisons. . . . Yon disreppitable and
unneighbourly family of Borrgias. . . . That lassie they ca'ed
Madame Brinvilliers, famous poisoners of history--he'd quite a
library of them, and the men that hunted him his orchids,
humming-birds, butterflies and such <i>bichus,</i> had to bring
him poisoned arrows o' the heathen, and the little darts they
puff through the long blow-pipes. <i>Sumpitans,</i> I think they
ca' them. And he'd be extra douce wi' any hunter or agent or
captain who'd send him, or bring him, specimens o' yon
<i>wourali</i> stuff fra' South America, or <i>dhatura</i> fra'
the East, <i>stropanthus</i> from Africa, and dozens of other
such unwholesome food-stuffs from China to Peru--things ye'd
never hear of unless ye went there, and then likely not--and all
unknown to the British Pharmacop&oelig;ia.</p>
<p>"Aye, he was a grraand man, and I'm tellin' ye he had grraand
hobbies, and great ideas.</p>
<p>"Aye, and something else he had, and that was a great enemy, a
successful rival in love, which was bad, and a successful rival
in business which was waur. McRattery his name was, and if ye'd
say Bute-Arrol was the finest figure o' a man, a citizen, a
gentleman, a pillar o' law, order and property, and ornament o'
the Kirk in all Glasgow, ye might perhaps add, 'Unless it's yon
Mr. McRattery.'</p>
<p>"A pair they were, but not a pair that would ever run in
harness, ye ken, nor side by side, nor in the same direction.</p>
<p>"Rivals and enemies, from their school-days at Fettes, to the
prime o' manhood. What the one had, the other must have more of;
what the one did, the other must outdo; what the one was, the
other must be in higher degree. Aye, what the one wanted, the
other must get first.</p>
<p>"And McRattery put the crown on his life's work o' rivalry,
thwarting and competition, by cutting in and getting Mary
MacDonald just when Bute-Arrol decided that it was time he had a
son to follow him, and had marked bonnie Mary down for the high
honour and advancement of becoming Mrs. Bute-Arrol.</p>
<p>"Big men they were both, wise and patient and clever, learned
and able and dour, ill men to cross, wilful and set in their
ways, and neither to haud nor to bind when once started on a
course. And perhaps, after all, McRattery was the bigger man, for
not only had he beaten Bute-Arrol in love and war, but he had
fought fair, and <i>sans rancune,</i> as these French havering
bletherers say.</p>
<p>"Fight he would, while there was breath in his body, but he
bore no malice, and would always fight fair; and ye couldna say
the same o' Bute-Arrol.</p>
<p>"<i>He'd</i> fight fair wi' the steepulation that a's fair in
love and war. An' he <i>did</i> bear malice. He was a good hater,
and he wasna the man to stultify himself wi' impotent hatred,
either. An' McRattery marryin' Mary MacDonald was a turnin'-point
in Bute-Arrol's career. Aye, the down-turnin' point, for he grew
more and more dour, and then soured and warped.</p>
<p>"And then two things happened which turned bad to worse, and
that was very bad indeed.</p>
<p>"The first of these was the death of Mrs. McRattery, that had
been his beloved Mary MacDonald; and the second was McRattery
beating him over a huge Admiralty contract.</p>
<p>"What made Mary's death more terrible to him, was his firm
belief that her life could have been saved. He had a mind like
Aberdeen granite, and hard as granite was his belief, his
certainty, that if Mary had been Mrs. Bute-Arrol instead of Mrs.
McRattery, she'd have lived to four-score.</p>
<p>"'Yon meeserable money-grubbing McRattery simply <i>let</i>
her die--or else she died wilfully, bein' sick sorry and tired at
the sight of her husband's ugly face, and the sound of his
croakin' voice. Why; had the creature been a man, he would have
defied and fought Death himself--and kept her alive, despite the
Devil and all the Imps of Hell. No, she shouldn't have died if
she'd been Mary Bute-Arrol, and she wouldn't have wanted to,
forbye.'</p>
<p>"That was the way he talked. But when McRattery undercut him
with a big contract for the Navy, he didn't talk at all.</p>
<p>"He never said another word against McRattery.</p>
<p>"On the contrary, if anybody at the Club criticized the man,
Bute-Arrol wouldna' let it pass, if it were unfair. And, whiles,
he would take an opportunity o' publicly speaking worrds o'
praise concernin' McRattery; and though he made no overtures nor
approaches to his rival, it got aboot that auld Wullie
Bute-Arrol's bark was waur than his bite, and that he had
naethin' against Eckie McRattery in spite of a'.</p>
<p>"Weel, ye ken hoo things get roond, and in time, McRattery got
to hear that Bute-Arrol wouldna hear a worrd against him. And one
day, when he said, daffing-like, at his own table, that yon
Bute-Arrol was a thrawn diel and an ill cur to turn from his
bone, a crony said:</p>
<p>"'Nay, dinna misca' the man, Eckie, for I heard him only
yesterday at the Club uphaudin' and defendin' ye like a brither,
and sayin' ye were a man that had earrned and desairved every
penny o' your fortune, and every step o' your success . . .' and
the like.</p>
<p>"An' McRattery, being the man he was, made to out-do
Bute-Arrol in generosity, as he had out-done him in business and
in love.</p>
<p>"Aye, aye, it's a queer worrld," mused the McSnorrt, gazing
pensively into his empty glass and slowly shaking his huge red
head.</p>
<p>It was noticeable--that in talking to the Geste brothers--he
talked less and less like a Clydeside docker from Glasgow, and
more like the educated man he was.</p>
<p>"Aye, a queer worrld," he continued, when his glass was
replenished, "an' one o' its queer sights was seen when William
Bute-Arrol sat down at a banquet as one of the guests of
Alexander Buchanan McRattery--the guest of honour on his host's
right hand.</p>
<p>"I can tell ye aboot that banquet at first hand, for I've
talked many a time an' oft wi' a man who was there, Sir Andrew
Anderson he was, and a great and wealthy marine engineer before
he retired. He died at the age of 90, when I was a lad, and many
a good turn he did me, had I but had the sense to ha' taken
advantage o' them.</p>
<p>"According to his account, it was a richt merry and successfu'
dinner, and ye'd have thought that McRattery and Bute-Arrol had
been lifelong friends instead o' rivals and enemies.</p>
<p>"For McRattery fairly laid himself out to charm and captivate
Bute-Arrol, and Bute-Arrol fairly laid himself out to be pleased
and pleasant.</p>
<p>"That dinner-table was a battlefield o' magnanimity. Each o'
the two big men strivin' to outdo the other in generosity and
great-hearted forgiveness and forgetting o' what there was to
forgive and forget.</p>
<p>"They drank each other's health and each made a little speech
full o' kindness and compliment to the other, and when they had
come to the coffee and liqueurs and big cigar stage, and men
leant back in their chairs and unbuttoned their minds socially
and right sociably, there was no pair o' cronies that chatted
more easily and freely than the generous-hearted Eckie McRattery
and his one-time rival and enemy Wullie Bute-Arrol.</p>
<p>"And McRattery must needs strike a match and light
Bute-Arrol's cigarette for him, and Bute-Arrol must clip a cigar
for McRattery--more like loving brothers than life-long rivals
and enemies ye'd believe.</p>
<p>"And as it happened, auld Andrew Anderson was watchin' and
wonderin', as McRattery, with his cigar in one hand and a match
in the other, laughed long and loud at some sly quip or jest, or
mayhap sculduddery, o' Bute-Arrol's.</p>
<p>"And that hearty merry laugh was the last sound poor McRattery
made in this worrld, for still shakin' wi' laughter, he put his
cigar to his lips, lit it, took one long satisfyin' draught,
slowly poured it out fra his smilin' lips, and then gave a start,
and, with a terrible expression on his face, gazed around him and
died.</p>
<p>"Died there in his chair wi'oot a worrd. His head just fell on
to his shoulder, and he sank heavily against his
neighbour--William Bute-Arrol.</p>
<p>"O' coorse they all sprang to their feet and dashed water in
his face, opened the windows, fanned him, tried to make him drink
brandy and did sic-like things, until the doctor came and said he
was dead. For dead he was--cut off in the prime of his health and
strength, and no healthier heartier stronger man had walked the
streets of Glasgae that day.</p>
<p>"An inquest there was, and the two best doctors in the city
confessed themselves puzzled and defeated.</p>
<p>"Deceased had a heart as sound as a bell, they said, and not
an organ that wasna perfect.</p>
<p>"Naturally, the immediate supposition was that he'd eaten
somethin' that had disagreed with him. But how should he have
eaten or drunk something that had disagreed with him to the point
o' killin' him, when not anither man at the table had felt the
slightest qualm o' pain, ill-health or discomfort?</p>
<p>"The contents of the stomach bein' analysed showed absolutely
no trace o' anything deeleterious, and the cause o' death was a
fair mystery. Apart from the offeecial and scienteefic
investigation, the guests themsel's worked it out that he had not
tasted a thing from soup to coffee that others had not
shared.</p>
<p>"And when some auld fule spoke of suicide, he had but to be
asked why Alexander Buchanan McRattery, in boisterous spirits,
rude health, and at the height of his success and fortune, should
commit suicide, and at such a time and place. And moreover, what
of the analyst's report on the absolutely normal and innocuous
contents o' the stomach?</p>
<p>"No, it was a mystery, unfathomable and complete.</p>
<p>"It was a nine-day's wonder, too, and the town talked of
nothing else, but this awfu' tragedy that cast real gloom over
the dead man's wide circle o' freends and acquaintances.</p>
<p>"And none more sorrowfu' and sympathetic than his new friend
and old enemy, William Bute-Arrol.</p>
<p>"Aye, an' it was practical sympathy too, for, in order,
perhaps, to show how deeply he had been affected by McRattery's
death at his very side, nay in his arms, at the very banquet
given to celebrate and demonstrate their reconciliation,
Bute-Arrol had adopted McRattery's orphan child.</p>
<p>"What were the worrkin's of his mind when he thought o' doin'
sic a thing? Who shall presume to fathom the dark mysterious
depths of the human mind? Aye, and ye might ask the question
anither way, or rather ask a different question a'thgither. Who
shall dare presume to fathom and unnerstand the worrkings o'
Providence? God moves in a meesterious way His wonders to
perforrm.</p>
<p>"Weel, whatever was the man's motive--whether it were a
gesture to catch the public eye; whether it were a salve to his
conscience; or whether he had some dark design upon the child,
and thoughts o' carryin' vengeance against his father even beyond
the grave--no-one will ever know.</p>
<p>"But see the result, ponder the ways of the A'mighty, and
turrn fra your wickedness. . . ."</p>
<p>The McSnorrt paused and drank deeply.</p>
<p>"Especially drink," he added, wiping his bearded lips with the
back of a vast and hairy hand.</p>
<p>"See what happened," he continued.</p>
<p>"Now Alexander Buchanan McRattery's son Uchtred, aged aboot
five or six years when Bute-Arrol adopted him--wi' the willing
and even thankful agreement o' the executor, a child-hatin'
plausible scoundrel, who later defaulted and went to prison--was
a healthy and active young limb o' Satan, wi' an enquirin' mind
and busy fingers.</p>
<p>"Folk who liked childer said he was an enterprisin' and
original laddie; and those who didn't like childer said he was a
mischievous and meddlesome young deil.</p>
<p>"But every one thoct it was graand to see the way he and dour
Bute-Arrol got on togither, walkin' hand in hand aboot the
grounds o' the big hoose, or the boy slippin' awa' doon fra the
nursery to get a bit fruit or sweetie or jeelypiece, at
dessert.</p>
<p>"Whiles he'd sit curled up in a chair and watch Bute-Arrol
with solemn big eyes, and Bute-Arrol'd sit sippin' his porrt and
thinkin' his deep thoughts as he stared at the child.</p>
<p>"An' mind ye, the child was fond of him, there's no denyin',
and was the only one in that hoose from the butler to the sixth
gardener's under-gardener that wasna afeared o' the man.</p>
<p>"No one ever saw Bute-Arrol caress the child, any more than
they saw the opposite or heard an unkind worrd; but it was clear
enough that the little lad was happy, and had taken no scunner at
his dour unsmilin' guardian.</p>
<p>"When the late McRattery's executor absconded to South America
and finished what the ruinous strike in the ship-yard had begun,
folk wondered if the boy was goin' to become Bute-Arrol's
heir--and some of Bute-Arrol's relations had disturrbin'
thoughts.</p>
<p>There was other folk--but ye ken what folk are--professed the
opeenion that Bute-Arrol deleeberately turrned a very blind eye
on the doin's o' the said executor, and had more than a finger in
the McRattery strike.</p>
<p>"But what I started to tell ye was this--the boy lived happy
and contented with his governess in Bute-Arrol's hoose, and had
the free run of it, an' of the grounds too. And while it was a
false and maleecious slander to say he was wantonly mischievous,
there's nae denyin' he could poke and pry and investigate with
the best--an' what normal healthy boy will not?</p>
<p>"An' one day he found something.</p>
<p>"It was in a most attractive and wunnerful box in a big room
that opened oot o' his guardian's bedroom--a sort o' combined
dressin'-room and study that Bute-Arrol used more than any o' his
fine graand rooms doon-stairs. There was a huge great desk in it,
and this big old bureau, and a fine safe, and twa-three wardrobes
and some big deep arm-chairs, and Bute-Arrol would smoke his
ceegar there in his dressing-gown late at night, an' he'd read
an' write there more than in his great library.</p>
<p>"Weel, prowlin' round this room, as he loved to do, fingerin'
this an' that, the boy spied this fine box.</p>
<p>"Chinese it was, ebony and ivory and mother-o'-pearl, with
bands o' brass, brass corners and a brass lock,--and to crown a',
a key in the lock. Ye'll imagine it wasna long before the laddie
had that box open, and sniffed its lovely scent o' sandal-wood,
and pried into every compartment and drawer, amusin' himself,
absorbed and happy, for an hoor that went like a meenit.</p>
<p>"He did no harm, and he kept nothing for himself, and the one
thing he took oot, he only took that he might do something with
it for his guardian--just the little childish ploy that a wee
laddie would think of. He guessed that the box had come oot o'
the safe or the bureau, had been left out by mistake, and would
disappear again when his guardian came home and entered the
room.</p>
<p>"That night the boy slippit doon and watched over the
banisters o' the stairs until the right moment, and then, in his
wee dressin'-gown and bedroom slippers, marched into the big
dinin'-room where Bute-Arrol sat all by his lane, the butler
havin' set his wine in front o' him and gone for the coffee.</p>
<p>"'Hullo, Uncle,' called the little lad. 'Can I have some
grapes?'</p>
<p>"Bute-Arrol, unsmilin', nodded at the child.</p>
<p>"'Help yersel',' he growled, and the boy marched round the
table, and then to the big sideboard, spyin' oot the land.</p>
<p>"As the butler came in, carryin' a big silver tray on which
were coffee and a box o' ceegars, Bute-Arrol took a ceegar, laid
it on the cloth beside his plate, and helped himself to
coffee--which he took with hot milk, cream and sugar. While he
did so, the wee laddie came behind his chair, and picked up the
ceegar.</p>
<p>"'Can I have some coffee, Uncle?' he asked.</p>
<p>"'Ye canna,' Bute-Arrol replied, 'but ye can hae a sup o'
milk.'</p>
<p>"'Pooh! Wha wants milk?' replied the child. 'I'll hae a glass
o' wine.'</p>
<p>"'Ye willna,' said Bute-Arrol, and picked up the ceegar that
the boy had laid down again, beside his plate.</p>
<p>"The butler put match-box and ash-tray on the table, as usual,
and went out.</p>
<p>"Bute-Arrol put the ceegar to his lips, lit it, and took a
puff or two.</p>
<p>"He then leant back in his chair, and, wi' an awful look o'
fright an' terror on his face, stared at the laughing wee laddie
who held out a gold ceegar-piercer in his hand--a thing like a
wee pencil-case that ye press at the top, and a sharp hollow
steel piercer pushes out of it and into the ceegar.</p>
<p>"'I did the ceegar for ye, Uncle,' laughed the child
gleefully.</p>
<p>"Bute-Arrol groaned.</p>
<p>"'<i>The judgment of God,</i>' he whispered, and
died--poisoned with the instrument he had used to poison the
boy's father."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The McSnorrt paused dramatically, and his hearers, who had
ceased to smoke and to drink, sat silent.</p>
<p>"How d'you know all this?" asked Beau Geste at last.</p>
<p>"Ma real name's Uchtred Buchanan McRattery," replied the
McSnorrt.</p>

<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 1</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Poor old Cigale's pretty bad these days," said John Geste to
his brothers Michael and Digby as he stepped into a tent of the
standing camp some ninety kilometres south of Douargala.</p>
<p>"Yes," replied Digby, as he rose to help his brother remove
and stow his kit in the tiny space which was allotted to each of
the twelve men who lived in the little tent that could
uncomfortably accommodate eight.</p>
<p>"Moon getting to the full," observed Michael. "We shall have
to keep an eye on the poor old chap. What's his latest?"</p>
<p>"Seeing ghosts," replied John. "He's just been telling me all
about it in the Guard Tent. When he was on sentry last night, he
saw somebody approaching him. Such a very remarkable and
extraordinary somebody that, instead of challenging, he rubbed
his eyes and stared again. He told me all this in the most
rational and convincing manner. It was really almost impossible
to do anything but believe. He said:</p>
<p>"'When I looked again I hardly knew what to do. There
undoubtedly was a man coming towards me out of the desert, from
the direction of the ruins. Nothing strange in that, you may say,
but the man was a soldier in uniform. And the uniform was not of
this regiment, nor of this army, nor of this country--nor of this
century--no, nor of this thousand years. His helmet was of
shining metal, with ear-pieces and neck-shield, but no
visor--rather like a pompier's helmet, but with a horsehair crest
and plume, and he had a gleaming cuirass of the same metal. In
fact, I thought, for a moment, that he was a trooper of the
Dragoon Guards until I saw that he carried a spear, at the slope,
across his right shoulder, and for side-arms had a short
sword--broad, but not much longer than a dagger. Under his
cuirass he wore a sort of tunic that came down to his knees, and
over this hung a fringe of broad strips of metal on leather. He
wore metal greaves on his shins and sandals on his feet.</p>
<p>"'In fact, he was a Roman soldier marching on patrol or doing
sentry-go on his beat. For one foolish moment I thought of enemy
tricks and stratagems and also of practical jokes, but then I
realized that not only could I see him as plainly as I see you
now, but that I could see <i>through</i> him. No, he was not
nebulous and misty like a cloud of steam; his outline was
perfectly clear-cut, but, as he approached me, he came between me
and one of the pillars of the ruins, and though I could see him
perfectly clearly and distinctly, I could also see the
pillar.</p>
<p>"'I was in something of a quandary. As you know, I try to do
my duty to the very best of my poor ability, and aim at being the
perfect private soldier. But there is nothing laid down in
regulations on the subject of the conduct of a sentry when
approached by a ghost.</p>
<p>"'In the Regulations it says, "<i>Anyone</i> approaching," and
at once the question arises as to whether a ghost is anyone. You
see, it is the ghost <i>of</i> someone, and therefore cannot
<i>be</i> someone, can it? . . .'</p>
<p>"Thus spake the good Cigale," continued John, "and I assured
him that personally I should not turn out the Guard nor rouse the
camp to repel ghosts."</p>
<p>"No," agreed Digby. "I don't think I should, either. Sure to
be a catch in it somewhere. The moment the Sergeant of the Guard
came, the dirty dog would disappear--the ghost, I mean--and then
you'd be for it.</p>
<p>"On the other hand," he continued, "if you didn't challenge
him, he might go straight into the General's tent and give the
old dear the fright of his life--and then you'd be for it
again."</p>
<p>"Very rightly," agreed Michael. "What good would the General
be at running a scrap next day, if he'd had a Roman soldier
tickling him in the tummy with the butt-end of a spear all
night?"</p>
<p>"True," mused John. "It's a problem. There ought to be a
section in the Regulations. They certainly provide for most other
things."</p>
<p>"And supposing it were the ghost of a most lovely <i>houri</i>
approaching the General's tent?" asked Digby. "Should it be left
to the sentry's indiscretion? And suppose the General came out
and caught him turning her away--or turning unto her the other
cheek also--"</p>
<p>"It's weird, though," Michael broke in upon these musings.
"You can be absolutely certain that La Cigale thought he saw a
Roman soldier, and if you think you see a thing, you <i>do</i>
see it."</p>
<p>"What's that?" inquired Digby incredulously. "If I think I see
a pimple on the end of your nose, I <i>do</i> see one?"</p>
<p>"Yes, you do, if you really think it. There is an image of it
on the retina of your eye--and what is that but seeing?"</p>
<p>"He did more than see him, too," put in John. "He had a long
conversation with him. They compared notes as to their respective
regiments--the Third Legion, and the French Foreign Legion."</p>
<p>"By Jove, that's interesting!" observed Beau Geste. "I should
have liked to hear them."</p>
<p>"I wonder if you'd have heard the ghost?" said Digby. "Of
course, if you <i>thought</i> you heard him, you <i>would</i>
have heard him, eh?</p>
<p>"I say," he added. "I just thought I heard you ask me to have
a cigarette. Therefore I <i>did</i> hear it."</p>
<p>"Yes," agreed Michael. "And you thought you saw me give you
one. Therefore I did give you one. Smoke it."</p>
<p>The tent-flap was pulled aside, and La Cigale entered.</p>
<p>"Come along, old chap! Splendid! We were just talking about
you and your interesting experience with the Roman legionary,"
Beau continued.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," replied Cigale. "A charming fellow. We had a most
interesting conversation. His depôt was here, and he'd served
everywhere from Egypt to Britain, had sun-stroke twice in Africa,
and frost-bite twice when stationed on The Wall, as he called
it--Hadrian's Wall, that would be, between England and
Scotland.</p>
<p>"He actually spoke of the Belgæ, and must have been stationed
quite near my home at one time. A most intelligent chap, and with
that education which comes from travel and experience. A little
rocky on Roman history, I found, but who would expect a private
soldier to be an authority on history--even that of his own
country?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 2</p>
<p> </p>
<p>La Cigale fell silent and mused awhile, breaking thereafter
into mutterings, disjointed and fragmentary.</p>
<p>"Most interesting fellow. Rome in Africa, five centuries;
France in Africa, one century; the sun the unconquerable enemy of
both. Rome did not assimilate although she conquered. Will France
assimilate, or be herself assimilated?"</p>
<p>And turning to Michael Geste, said:</p>
<p>"He was stationed at Cæsarea once. They called it 'The Athens
of the West.' We talked of Masinissa, the Berber King of Cæsarea
and all Numidia. You will remember he fought against Rome, and
then against Carthage in alliance with Rome. He was the
grandfather of the great Jugurtha.</p>
<p>"We chatted also of his son Juba, who fought for Pompey in the
civil war and committed suicide after Cæsar defeated him at
Thapsus.</p>
<p>"<i>Most</i> interesting fellow. He told me that Antony's wife
Octavia adopted Juba's little son and brought him up with
Antony's own little daughter by Cleopatra--young Silene Cleopatra
he called her. Quite a charming little romance he made of it, for
the two kiddies grew up together at the Roman Court and fell in
love with each other--married and lived happy ever after. They
went back to Cæsarea and he ruled in the house of his fathers.
Rather nice to think about when one considers those cruel
times--"</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 3</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Oh, for God's sake, shut your jabbering row," growled The
Treasure, from where he was lying on his blanket. "Enough to make
a dog sick to listen to you."</p>
<p>"Then suppose the dog goes and is sick outside, and doesn't
listen," suggested Digby.</p>
<p>"Yes, a charming little story," agreed Michael. "What else did
your visitor talk about?"</p>
<p>"Oh, places where he was stationed," replied La Cigale, "and
about his Legion. He was frightfully proud of that--like we are
of ours. He was in the Third African Legion. 'The Augustine,' he
called it. He says it was three centuries in Africa. They only
kept one legion in Africa, he tells me, though there were three
in Britain. Great fellows, those Romans, for system and
organization. What do you think? In this Third Legion of his, the
recruiting was almost purely hereditary. Think of
that--hereditary drafts. When a man had served his time in the
Legion they gave him land on the understanding that he married
and settled down there, and sent his sons into the Legion. No
wonder there was <i>esprit de corps</i> in the Augustine Legion.
By the way, they built that place over there in A.D. 100, called
it Sagunta Diana, and built it on the ground plan of a Roman
camp.</p>
<p>"By Jove, he did a march that I envy him. First they marched
right across North Africa, from here to Alexandria. There they
embarked in triremes for Italy, and marched to Rome. Thence
north, right up Italy, and all across France to a place whence
they could see Britain. Then by transports again to Dover, whence
they marched to London, and from there through the length of
England to Hadrian's Wall. Twenty times 2,000 paces was their
day's march--all marked off by regular camping-places.</p>
<p>"He tells me they had a frightful row in camp outside
Alexandria with the Sixth Legion from Judea--the Ferrata Legion
they called it. It seems the Third Legion hated the others coming
into Africa to relieve them while they did their tour of foreign
service; they looked upon Africa as their own, and didn't want
interlopers in their stations, such as Timgad, Lambæsis, Mascula,
Verecundia and Sitifis. He called Timgad <i>Thamugadi.</i> I
didn't recognize the word at first, as he pronounced it. He was
awfully interested to hear that I'd been there and could identify
some of the temples in which he had worshipped. It is still in a
wonderful state of preservation, as you know. Lambæsis was his
favourite camp, for some reason. He was delighted when I told him
that the Arch of Septimus Severus is almost as perfect to-day as
when he saw it last. That led us to speak of the Arch of
Caracalla. That's at Thevesti--about 200 miles from Carthage, you
know. I'm afraid he began to think I was pulling his leg when I
told him I knew it, as well as his beloved Temple of Minerva. He
got quite excited."</p>
<p>The Treasure growled, cursed, and spat.</p>
<p>"Told you all that, did he?" he said. "Damn fine ghost! Pity
he couldn't have told you something useful. Where he'd buried a
few bottles of wine, for example. D'you know what there was when
you and your ghost was jabberin'? Two village idiots
together--that's what there was."</p>
<p>"If you interrupt again I'll put your face in the sand, and
sit on your head till you die," murmured John Geste.</p>
<p>"But there wasn't two <i>crétins,</i>" continued The Treasure.
"There was only one barmy lunatic, and he was talkin' to hisself.
'E's talkin' to three others, 'e is, now."</p>
<p>John Geste rose to his feet, and The Treasure scrambled from
the tent in haste.</p>
<p>"And this is a <i>most</i> interesting thing," continued La
Cigale, still staring at the ground between his feet, as was his
habit when not on duty or employed. "Very curious, too. He told
me about a deserter from the Roman army--the Legionary Tacfrineas
he called him, who went over to the enemy, and organized the
Berber tribes against Rome. The Third Legion was frightfully sick
about it. Of course, it was just as though one of us deserted and
joined the Senussi or the Touareg or the Riffs, and taught them
our drill and tactics, trained their artillerymen, gave them our
plans and passwords and generally made them about ten times as
dangerous as they are.</p>
<p>"I'd certainly never heard of this Tacfrineas before, so I
couldn't have <i>imagined</i> all this, could I?"</p>
<p>And he gazed appealingly at the faces of the three
brothers.</p>
<p>"Of course not," said Beau Geste. "Extraordinarily interesting
experience. It must give you great pleasure to think that, out of
all the Battalion, it was you whom the Roman soldier chose to
visit."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes. Indeed yes," agreed La Cigale, smiling. "I feel
quite happy to-day, and can even bear the sight--and smell--of
The Treasure. And the Roman soldier has promised to come and
visit me again when I am on sentry, and he's going to tell me a
great secret. I don't know what it is, but it's something about
some gold."</p>
<p>La Cigale fell silent, pondering, and gradually the light of
intelligence faded from his eyes, his mouth fell open, and he
looked stupid, dull and miserable.</p>
<p>Digby Geste leant over and shook him by the knee.</p>
<p>"Splendid, old chap," he said. "You're a very remarkable man,
you know. I envy you. What else did you and the other old
<i>légionnaire</i> yarn about?"</p>
<p>"Oh, we compared pay, rations, drill, marches and all that
sort of thing, you know," replied La Cigale, brightening like a
re-lighted lamp. "They had the same infernal road-making fatigues
that we do.</p>
<p>"Why, he tells me they built one hundred and ninety miles of
solid stone road from Thevesti to Carthage. Think of
that--<i>stone!</i></p>
<p>"Oh, yes, we exchanged grumbles. They had the same
god-forsaken little outposts down in the South and much the same
sort of tyranny from 'foreign' N.C.O.'s, of whom they were more
afraid than they were of the Centurions themselves. Yes, they had
an iron discipline and even severer punishments. In a case where
a man here might get <i>crapaudine,</i> because there were no
cells in which to give him thirty days' solitary confinement, he
would have been flogged to death in the Third Legion, or perhaps
crucified.</p>
<p>"I say, I <i>do</i> hope he comes again. Do you think he will?
He gave me the happiest night I've had since I
went--went--went--"</p>
<p>La Cigale groaned, and gazed stupidly around.</p>
<p>"Eh?" he asked. "What's this?" and lay down upon his blanket
to sleep.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 4</p>
<p> </p>
<p>La Cigale's <i>bête noir</i> was a person who, in full
possession of his faculties, had less understanding and
intelligence than La Cigale at his maddest.</p>
<p>He was that curious product of the Paris slums, that seems to
be less like a human being than are the criminal denizens of the
underworld of any other city--Eastern or Western, civilized or
savage. He was not so much a typical Paris apache, as an apache
too bestial, degraded, evil and brutish to be typical even of the
Parisian apache. Even the Geste brothers, who could find "tongues
in trees, books in the running brooks, sermons in stones, and
good in everything," could find no good in "The Treasure"--as
Sergeant-Major Lejaune, with grim irony, had christened him. They
had, individually and collectively, done their best, and had
completely failed. That such a creature, personally filthy
(inside his uniform), with foulest tongue and foulest habits,
degraded and disgusting, a walking pollution and corruption,
should be one's intimate companion at bed and board, was one of
the many things that made life in the Legion difficult. One had
to sleep, eat, march, and take one's ease (!) cheek by jowl with
The Treasure, and could not escape him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 5</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And the Treasure, by nature indescribably objectionable,
deliberately made himself as personally and peculiarly
objectionable to La Cigale as he possibly could. From the store
of his vile, foul manners, he gave the sensitive ex-officer
constant experience of the vilest and foulest of his filthy and
revolting speech. Of his mean, low, injurious tricks, he reserved
the worst for La Cigale. When accused by a non-commissioned
officer of some offence, he invariably laid the blame upon La
Cigale, in the reasoned belief and reasonable hope that the poor
madman would have either too little wit or too much chivalry to
defend himself and arraign his lying accuser.</p>
<p>On one occasion, at Ain Sefra, Beau Geste had seen The
Treasure, just before kit inspection, direct the attention of La
Cigale, by a sudden shout and pointing hand, to something else,
while he snatched a belt from La Cigale's kit and placed it with
his own. This saved him from eight days' prison and transferred
the punishment to the bewildered La Cigale, who could only
stammer to the roaring Sergeant-Major Lejaune that his show-down
of kit had been complete a few seconds before. But it had earned
The Treasure a worse punishment, for the indignant Beau Geste had
soundly and scientifically hammered him, until he wept and begged
for mercy, with profuse protestations that he had not done it,
but would never do it again.</p>
<p>He never did, but he redoubled his efforts to render La
Cigale's life insupportable, and showed something almost
approaching intelligence in ascertaining which of his foul habits
and fouller words most annoyed, shocked disgusted and upset his
unhappy victim.</p>
<p>For Beau Geste, The Treasure entertained a deep respect, a
great fear and a sharp knife, the last-named to be taken as
prescribed (in the back), and when opportunity and occasion
should arise. These would have arisen long ago but that his enemy
had two brothers and two horrible American friends who rendered
an otherwise perfectly simple job not only difficult but
extremely dangerous . . . (Remember poor Bolidar!)</p>
<p>Like almost all of his kind, The Treasure was a drunkard, and
there was nothing he would not do for money, inasmuch as money to
him was synonymous with liquor. Having been, in private life, a
professional pickpocket and sneak-thief, he was able to keep
himself modestly supplied with cash while avoiding the terrible
retribution which overtakes the <i>légionnaire</i> who robs his
comrades.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 6</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Do you know, young gentlemen," said John Geste, one
afternoon, to his two brothers as they strolled from the parade
ground whence they had just been dismissed to the tent where they
would now settle down to the cleaning of their kit, "I've had an
idea?"</p>
<p>Digby seized John's wrist that he might feel his pulse, and
observed:</p>
<p>"An idea, Beau! He's had an idea. Hold him while I fetch some
water."</p>
<p>"He's got plenty already," replied Michael unperturbed, "on
the brain. Idea's probably drowned by now."</p>
<p>"No, no," said John. "It's still swimming around. It's this:
La Cigale is for guard again to-night and simply bubbling with
excitement at the thought of seeing his Roman soldier again."</p>
<p>"What! Do you want to go and pal up with him?" interrupted
Digby. "Butt in and make up to La Cigale's old pal--severing two
loving hearts--green-eyed jealousy--"</p>
<p>"No, the pup only wants to see a ghost," said Michael.</p>
<p>"Well, of course, I would," admitted John. "But what I was
going to say, when you two--er--gentlemen began to bray, was
this. Poor old Cigale may do anything under the disturbing
influences of full moon and a private visit from this Shade."</p>
<p>"Shady business," murmured Digby. "He may go clean off the
deep end in his excitement--start showing him round the camp,
take him in to gaze upon the slumbering features of Lejaune, or
even toddle off with him to visit a two-thousand-years-closed
wine-shop in the forum at Sagunta Diana. It occurred to me that a
few of us three might exchange with fellows who are for guard,
and keep an eye on the poor old chap."</p>
<p>"Quite so," agreed Beau Geste. "Good lad. I fancy Lejaune
would be only too glad of the chance to smash La Cigale for being
a gentleman and an ex-officer. And if the doctor or the colonel
or a court-martial officially pronounced him mad he might be put
in a lunatic asylum. And that would be about the cruellest and
most dreadful thing one could imagine, for he's half sane half
the time, and as sane as we are occasionally."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes," agreed Digby. "Far saner than some people--John,
for example."</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 7</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the early moonlit hours of the following morning, John
Geste patrolled the beat which adjoined that of La Cigale, while
Michael and Digby took turns to sit outside the guard tent to
watch.</p>
<p>For an hour or so of his tour of sentry go, La Cigale behaved
quite normally.</p>
<p>Suddenly John, marching on his beat towards where La Cigale
stood staring in the direction of the ruins of Sagunta Diana, saw
him spring to attention, present arms, hold himself erect and
rigid as a statue, relax and stand at ease, change his rifle from
his right hand to his left and then, bowing, warmly shake hands
with some person invisible.</p>
<p>"I am so glad you've come again, my friend," John heard La
Cigale say. "Most kind and charming of you. I'm awfully sorry I
can't show myself as hospitable as I should like to be--but you
know what it is. No, we shan't be disturbed until I'm relieved.
Grand Rounds passed some time ago."</p>
<p>John Geste shivered slightly.</p>
<p>A most uncanny experience. It was perfectly obvious that La
Cigale was talking to somebody whom he could see and hear and
touch.</p>
<p>Could it be that ghosts really exist, and are visible to those
who are what is called psychic?</p>
<p>He stared and stared at the place where anyone would be
standing who was talking, face to face, with La Cigale. Nothing,
of course.</p>
<p>He rubbed his eyes and, clasping the blade of the long bayonet
in his hands, leant upon his rifle while he concentrated his gaze
as though peering through a fog.</p>
<p>Nothing, of course.</p>
<p>But <i>was</i> there nothing? Was there a shadow confronting
La Cigale? The shadow of a medium-sized thick-set man leaning
upon his spear in the very attitude in which John was leaning
upon his bayonet and rifle.</p>
<p>Or was it pure illusion? All moonshine--a curious optical
delusion enormously strengthened by La Cigale's conduct and the
fact that he was talking so naturally.</p>
<p>Yes, a clear case of hetero-suggestion. Curious, though, that
one's ears could so affect one's eyes that one could imagine one
saw what one imagined one heard.</p>
<p>Would he hear the Roman soldier's voice in a moment? If so, he
would be perfectly certain that he <i>could</i> see the figure of
a Roman soldier wearing a helmet like that of a fireman; a
moulded breast-plate from which depended heavy hangings; metal
greaves; and high-laced sandals--a man who bore a longish shield
curved at the sides and straight at the top and bottom, on which
was painted an eagle, a capital A, and the figure III.</p>
<p>He only <i>thought</i> he saw him now, of course, and in a
moment he would think he heard his voice. At present there was
but one, and hearing it was like listening to a person who is
using the telephone in the room in which one is.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>"Were you really? No! How very interesting!"</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>"Oh, yes; I've been there several times. To think that we have
trodden the same streets, entered the very same shops and
dwelling-houses, temples and theatres, actually drunk from the
same faucet and washed our hands in the same stone trough! I
think that one of the most interesting--the most <i>human</i> and
real--things in all the wonderful Pompeii are those grooves worn
in the edges of the troughs where thousands of people for
hundreds of years all laid their right hands on the same spot to
support themselves as they bent over the trough to put their lips
to the faucet from which the water trickled."</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>"Yes, of course you have, many and many a time, and so did I
once--just to be one with all those departed Romans."</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>"Yes, that's what makes it so wonderful. Not merely a case of
my having been in a place which is only on the site of a place in
which you have been. Yes, exactly. The very same actual and
identical houses. You and I, my friend, have trodden on the same
actual paving-blocks, and have sat upon the same stone seats. I
have walked in the very ruts in which the wheels of your chariot
rolled as you drove it down the stone-paved High Street of
Pompeii, and I have stood in the wineshops in which you have
drunk."</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>"Yes, a very funny picture, indeed. It is still there, the
colours as perfect as when you saw it last. They've got glass,
and a sort of blind over it now, and a custodian to guard it. To
think you actually saw it being painted and remember roaring with
laughter when Balbus drew your attention to it."</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>"Oh, didn't you? A pity. History says that he was living there
about that time."</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>"Yes, you must have hated returning from furlough just then
even to the Third Legion."</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>"Well, no, we aren't supposed to do it--and there'd be
precious little to be had if we were. One hears tales, of course.
There's a place we call Fez where one or two are supposed to have
got hold of a little."</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>"Really? By Jove, that would be an interesting find for
anybody who unearthed it now. . . ."</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>"<i>I</i> could? I'm afraid it wouldn't be of much use to
me--though it would be most awfully interesting to see it. There
would probably be coins of which no known specimen exists at the
present day. Priceless. Oh, yes, they would fetch any sum. . .
."</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>"By Jove, that was hard luck! They don't seem to have changed
much, from your day to ours. We call them Bedouin and Touareg.
Attack us in much the same way. Stamp us flat occasionally, but
discipline always tells. . . ."</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>"Could you really? The very spot? Very kind of you--most
charming. I should love to see the coins."</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>"Oh, no, I shouldn't wish to remove it, but if you could spare
one or two specimens that are unknown to-day, I should love to
have them as souvenirs. I should not part with them of course.
One or two early Greek gold ones."</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>"Now at once? Really most kind of you. A very great honour.
Oh, no, I wouldn't dream of showing anybody else. I never betray
a confidence. . . ."</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>And then John Geste rushed forward as La Cigale, throwing his
rifle up on his right shoulder, marched off in the direction of
Sagunta Diana. Digby Geste came hurrying from the direction of
the Guard Tent.</p>
<p>Seizing La Cigale's arm, John swung him about.</p>
<p>"What are you doing, man?" he expostulated. "You can't leave
your post like this. You're a pretty sentry! You don't want to be
shot, do you?--not at dawn by a firing party of your own
comrades, at any rate!"</p>
<p>Digby arrived and seized La Cigale's other arm.</p>
<p>"Come home, Bill Bailey," quoth he. "Setting us all a nice
example, aren't you? And I thought you were the model
<i>légionnaire</i>."</p>
<p>"Good God, what am I doing!" stammered La Cigale and passed
his hand across his eyes as the brothers released him.</p>
<p>"Thank you so much, gentlemen. This absent-mindedness is
terrible. Do you know, a friend of mine, a most interesting chap,
strolled over from his lines and we fell into conversation. I
actually forgot that I was on sentry. I am getting <i>so</i>
absent-minded. When he invited me to come over and--er--look at
something, I was just going to walk across with him. Thank you
<i>so</i> much."</p>
<p>"All right now?" asked Digby.</p>
<p>"Oh quite, thank you!" replied La Cigale. "It was only a
momentary aberration. I'd sooner die than leave my post, of
course."</p>
<p>"What became of him?" asked John.</p>
<p>"Oh, he went off without me," replied La Cigale. "There he
goes, look. I hope he's not offended."</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 8</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The brothers stared and stared in the direction of La Cigale's
extended hand.</p>
<p>"See anything, John?" whispered Digby.</p>
<p>"Well, do you know?" answered John, "I couldn't absolutely
swear that I didn't see a nebulous figure. And the astounding
thing is that I saw or thought I saw something that La Cigale
never mentioned."</p>
<p>"The shield?" whispered Digby. "With a capital A and the Roman
III, and something at the top?"</p>
<p>"Did you see it, too?" inquired a voice from behind. Michael
had joined them.</p>
<p>"Clearly," replied Digby. "Did you, Beau?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely distinctly," replied Michael. "I saw a Roman
soldier. I could describe every detail of his kit; I could sketch
him exactly as he was."</p>
<p>"I, too," affirmed Digby.</p>
<p>"You, John?" asked Michael.</p>
<p>"Couldn't swear to it," replied John. "Cigale was chatting
away so naturally with <i>somebody</i>--that I couldn't help
fancying that I saw the man to whom he was talking. I certainly
didn't see anything clearly and definitely like you two seem to
have done. And yet I fancied I dimly saw the III A shield. If
nobody else had mentioned it I should have thought that I'd
dreamed the whole thing."</p>
<p>"Rum business," murmured Digby.</p>
<p>"Not an 'absinthe' business, anyhow," replied Michael, as John
and La Cigale turned about and began to pace their respective
beats.</p>
<p>"You and I are fey, Digby Geste," smiled Michael, linking his
arm through that of his brother as they turned back to the
guard-tent.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 9</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Treasure lay hid in the black shadow of a crumbling arch
watching with wolfish eyes a man who laboured to remove the
light, loose sand that had collected at the base of a wall at a
point twenty-five paces from a pillar--the fourth of a row that
had once supported and adorned the front of a Temple of Diana.
Something approaching excitement stirred the sluggish depths of
his evil and avaricious soul as he once more assured himself that
he was on the track of something good.</p>
<p>Yesterday--with his back turned to his comrades and an
appearance of great absorption in his work--he had listened with
close attention as this bloomin' lunatic told his blasted
friends, those bestial Englishmen, about how he was going to
sneak over to these ruddy ruins and dig out a <i>cache</i> of
gold coins of which he had got wind. Some poor legionary had hid
his little bit of loot there one night and the place had been
rushed and sacked at dawn, the next morning. Gold coins, too!
Nice, handy, portable form of loot, too! And the dirty
double-crosser was only going to take one or two to look at, was
he? The sacred liar! Not so <i>fou</i> as he pretended, that
Cigale. Oh, very tricky. Well, other people might know a few
tricks, too! What about letting the swindling silly hound sweat
for the stuff, and a better man scoop it when the fool had got
it?</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 10</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An hour or so later, La Cigale straightened himself up, gazed
around the moonlit ruins in a dazed manner, climbed out of the
hole that he had excavated, and made his way towards the
camp.</p>
<p>The Treasure crouched back, motionless, in the darkest shadow,
until his comrade had passed, and then, rising, followed him--a
large stone in his right hand.</p>
<p>The Treasure was a workman skilled in all branches of his
trade--one of which was the throwing of knives and other weapons
of offence. The heavy stone, flung at a range of six feet or so,
struck the unfortunate Cigale at the base of the skull, and by
the time he had recovered consciousness The Treasure had come
reluctantly to the conclusion that the accursed lying swindling
<i>crétin</i> had only got a single old coin of some sort, gold,
and curiously shaped, about his person. One ancient gold coin,
the size of a two-franc piece.</p>
<p>By the time La Cigale had painfully raised himself upon his
hands and knees, The Treasure was working feverishly in the
excavation that his comrade had recently left.</p>
<p>By the time La Cigale had recovered sufficiently to rise to
his feet and gaze uncertainly toward the ruins whence he had
come, a dull rumbling, followed by an earth-shaking crash had
startled the watchful sentries of the camp. An undermined pillar
had fallen.</p>
<p>The Treasure was seen no more by his unsorrowing comrades.</p>
<p><i>Buried</i> Treasure.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c206" id="c206"><i>If Wishes Were Horses . .

<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 1</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The full moon, a great luminous pearl, and the incredible
tropic stars--palely blue diamonds scattered over darkly blue
velvet--looked down upon four weary, dirty men who lounged around
a small camp-fire beneath a stunted, crooked palm beside a puddle
of slimy water, rock-circled, thing-inhabited, malodorous.</p>
<p>One of the men was fair, huge, with huge moustache, a great
laugh, great hands, and gross appetite. He looked too dull to be
wicked, or successful. Drink had washed him into the Legion.</p>
<p>The second was dark, tiny, the ideal gentleman-jockey in
build; pretty, small of mouth, and large of eye. He looked too
clever to be trustworthy or determined. Racehorses had carried
him to the Legion.</p>
<p>The third was grey, tall, spare and gaunt, a light-cavalry
type. His craggy face was sad and weary, bitter, and somewhat
cruel. He looked too cynical to be very intelligent or helpful.
Vengeance had driven him to the Legion.</p>
<p>The fourth was Digby Geste, typical English gentleman.
Brother-love had led him to the Legion.</p>
<p>Around them stretched to the horizon, on every side, the
illimitable desert plain, still, mysterious, inimical, its dead
level of monotony broken only by an occasional bush or boulder. A
select small company of vultures formed a large circle around
them, and took an abiding interest in their risings up, and their
lyings down--particularly the latter.</p>
<p>A more select and smaller company of human vultures had made
their camp a mile or so distant--by the simple process of lying
down in their tracks, eating dates, and going to sleep--while one
of their number, having wriggled like a snake with incredible
flatness, speed and skill to within view of the men around the
little camp-fire, squatted behind a boulder and also took an
abiding interest in their risings up, and their lyings down, and
particularly the latter.</p>
<p>To the vultures, the chance of a meal was something to follow
up for days, and to the human vultures the chance of a rifle,
worth its weight in silver, was something to follow up for weeks.
Should the watcher, one night, see the sentry nod, sit down, lean
back, sleep--he would wriggle near, satisfy himself, and then
flee like a deer to his fellows. There would be a quick loping
run, a close recognisance, a sudden swift rush, a flash of
knives, and soon the meal, ready jointed, would await the other
vultures.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 2</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Suppose the good Archangel Gabriel suddenly alighted here,
with easy grace, and, folding his wings, granted us each a wish,
what would you have, Zimmerman?" the dark little man suddenly
asked the huge, fair one.</p>
<p>"Eh? . . . Me? . . . Grant me a wish? . . . Like those people
in the Grimm fairy tales?" replied Zimmerman, a harmless,
worthless waster--once.</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't know. . . . Pick up a diamond as big as my fist.
. . . Strike for Berlin, home and beauty then. Take a suite in
the Hotel Adlon in the Pariser Platz, do the <i>Weinrestaurants,
tanzlokals,</i> theatres, beer-halls, night-cafés of the
Kurfürstendamm, for a bit. Look up all the boys--and the girls. .
. . Oh, ho! Champagne . . . fresh caviare . . . feasting . . .
races . . . the tables . . . Peacock Island, Grunewald;
Charlottenburg, night-clubs . . . Ho, ho! When I drove my girl
down the Unter den Linden, every one would turn and look at us.
Then I'd take her down to Monte Carlo, by way of Paris. Nothing
wrong with Paris, and Monte Carlo, after you've picked up a
diamond as big as your fist. Yes, I'd give her a time she'd
remember. Let her see all the shops in Paris and Monte. . . . Let
her see me win a pile of hundred-franc notes at the Casino. . . .
Let her see me shoot the pigeons."</p>
<p>"She'd <i>love</i> that, I'm sure," observed Digby Geste.</p>
<p>"Yes, she would so! . . . <i>Gott in Himmel!</i> I'd melt that
diamond down. . . .</p>
<p>"What would you do, Gomez? . . . Madrid, a Senorita, and the
bull-ring? . . . Carmelitas . . . fandangos, guitars, wine of
Oporto and Xeres, serenades?"</p>
<p>"Not a bit of it. I should make straight for England. Get
another string together, and train 'em myself."</p>
<p>"Win the Derby, Oaks, and the Grand National, all in the same
year, what? . . ."</p>
<p>"Yes . . . I'd have my stables all white tiles, mahogany,
porcelain and silver plate--the talk of the countryside--and my
horses the talk of England, the talk of the world. . . . Ascot .
. . Goodwood . . . Newmarket . . . Longchamps . . . Auteuil . .
."</p>
<p>He sighed heavily.</p>
<p>"Well, thank the good God for tobacco, even French tobacco,
until Gabriel comes," guffawed Zimmerman.</p>
<p>"What would be <i>your</i> line, Jones," he added, turning to
Digby Geste.</p>
<p>Digby took his pipe from his mouth, slowly blew a long cloud
of smoke, and gazed at the great ball of gentle light that hung
from the velvet dome of the low sky.</p>
<p>What boon would he ask, if one were to be granted to him?</p>
<p>It cannot be said that his thoughts turned to Brandon Abbas,
for they were already there.</p>
<p>What would be the loveliest thing his mind could possibly
conceive? What about a drive in the high dogcart with
Isobel?--through the glorious Devon countryside; the smart cob
doing his comfortable ten miles an hour; harness jingling;
hoof-beats regular as clockwork; Isobel's hand under his right
arm; Devon lanes; Devon fields and orchards; Devon moors;
glorious--beyond description.</p>
<p>But then he would have to keep at least one eye on the horse
and the road, and that would leave only one eye for Isobel. . . .
When one is driving a horse, one should drive him properly, with
the care and attention which is one's courtesy to a horse that is
worth driving. . . . Well up to his bit, with watchful eye and
ready hand . . .</p>
<p>No, not a drive. What about two long chairs in the Bower, side
by side, but facing opposite ways, so that he would have a full
view of Isobel's face . . . nothing for his eyes to do but to
watch every change of expression in <i>her</i> wonderful eyes,
and lovely face . . . nothing for his ears to do but note every
change and inflexion and sound of her sweet voice?</p>
<p>Or what about asking something bigger--something really big? .
. . Why not ask that time be pushed forward a few years, and that
the three of them be distinguished officers? Beau a Colonel, John
and he Majors, going home on leave after a glorious campaign;
home to Brandon Abbas and Isobel . . . Isobel . . . Isobel's arms
about his neck . . . the little church in Brandon Park . . . the
Chaplain at the altar . . . Beau should give her away . . . John
should be best man. . . . Oh, too wonderfully beautiful . . . too
terribly glorious . . . too unthinkable. . . .</p>
<p>He turned to Zimmerman.</p>
<p>"What would <i>I</i> like best in all the world?" he said.
"Oh, I should love, beyond expression, beyond the power of human
speech . . . to hit a very bald man on the head with a very long
cucumber."</p>
<p>His companions pondered this ambition.</p>
<p>"No, no! Not <i>a</i> bald man. Not just <i>any</i> bald man.
It's l'<i>Adjudant</i> Lejaune one would like to hit on the head
with a long cucumber," said the Spaniard. "Now, that really would
be a deed worth doing! . . . <i>Smack! . . .</i> Just when he's
bawling his foulest insults. . . . One could die happy after
that. Yes, a really great conception, Jones. Can you beat it,
Budiski? What would you like?"</p>
<p>"I? . . . I'd ask for nothing better than two minutes with a
certain Russian gentleman I know . . . a perfect little
gentleman. A General, in fact," replied the grey-haired,
grey-faced man.</p>
<p>"I've followed his career with interest ever since he was
quite a junior officer. . . . I have shot him <i>once. . . .</i>
That's why I am here. . . .</p>
<p>"He came with his half-company to our village when I was a lad
. . . long, long ago. . . . It was <i>pogrom</i> time, and
everybody was accusing everybody, when they weren't shooting them
instead. . . . And our Russian masters were 'pacifying' that
little corner of our country by the excellent Russian method.</p>
<p>"Any Lieutenant was the equal of Julius Cæsar in respect of
his complete ability to 'make a solitude and call it peace' . .
.</p>
<p>"They banged on our door one night, because ours was the
biggest, and most comfortable house in the neighbourhood. . . .
Ostensibly, because there was a blood-stained hand-cart in our
stables. Of course there was. . . . It had been put there by the
worthy soul who had used it to remove bleeding carcasses from
where they were inconvenient, to where they were useful evidence
against his enemy. . . . Probably--in proof of his hatred of all
evil-doing, and his love of all Jews and Russians--he had shown
the dripping push-cart to the Russian police.</p>
<p>"Anyhow, there it was, and there were the Russian soldiers
round our house, in which slept my father and mother in a front
room; my sister Wanda--a lovely girl of about eighteen--in the
next room, and I and my young brother in a big room at the back.
. . .</p>
<p>"He was a good boy, that young brother of mine. I was rather
fond of him. Perhaps some of you can understand that?"</p>
<p>Digby Geste nodded his head.</p>
<p>"And we both adored Wanda. She was one of those simple,
gentle, kind natures who, knowing no evil, are slow to think
there is any in others, and imagine that all men--and women are
like themselves. Not clever, you know, nor accomplished, nor
advanced, nor up-to-date, but just merely simply something to
thank God for, in a world like this."</p>
<p>"Marguerite, before Faust came on the scene, eh?" said the big
German.</p>
<p>The Pole regarded him absent-mindedly, and continued:</p>
<p>"I suppose there is a God of Love--a beneficent Deity?"</p>
<p>"Of course there is," observed Digby Geste. "Didn't he create
your Wanda?"</p>
<p>"And didn't he watch what followed? . . . I pulled on an
overcoat, and ran downstairs as my father opened the front door
to the soldiers. In five minutes they were all over the house,
and they brought Wanda and my mother and my young brother down
into the big living-room where the Lieutenant, his drawn sword in
his hand, lolled in a chair, questioning my father, or rather
abusing and bullying him and shouting accusations to which he
would hear no answer.</p>
<p>"I can see that <i>intérieur</i> now, the impudent hard-faced
rascal in my father's chair. A Sergeant and half a dozen
grey-coated, flat-capped soldiers at attention behind him. Other
soldiers replenishing the fire, lighting more lamps and candles,
ransacking the place for food, drink, and loot . . .</p>
<p>"For the sake of his wife and children, my father was humble,
meek, conciliatory, deprecating. It did not take the brave
Lieutenant, who was prosecutor, witnesses, judge and jury all in
one, many minutes to try the old man, find him guilty, and
sentence him to death.</p>
<p>"'Remove the prisoner,' said he, having delivered sentence.
'Bind him, and take him outside--under a tree with a suitable
bough.'</p>
<p>"As my mother and Wanda threw themselves on their knees before
this upright judge, a Corporal and four men seized my father,
tied a rope round his body, so that his arms were bound to his
sides, and led him out into the snow, over which the cold, grey
dawn was beginning to break.</p>
<p>"Smiling evilly on the two imploring women, the gentleman
leant forward. With his left hand he gave my mother a rough
thrust that sent her sprawling, and then, cupping Wanda's chin in
his palm, he turned her face up to his, and kissed her on the
lips.</p>
<p>"The brave rash boy, my brother Karol, sprang forward, before
his two guards could stop him--and even as I shouted, 'Don't, you
young fool,' and, with bursting heart, firmly controlled myself
for the sake of all of us--he struck the Lieutenant heavily
between the eyes, sending that hero over backwards, chair and
all.</p>
<p>"Leaping to his feet, as the guards sprang upon my brother,
and on me, this brave Russian officer put his sword-point to my
brother's throat--and <i>thrust</i> . . .</p>
<p>"I fought like a madman . . .</p>
<p>"I hear my mother's screams to this day . . .</p>
<p>"Wanda had fainted.</p>
<p>"The Lieutenant gave orders that she should be carried to her
bed, and tied to it securely. Also that I and my mother should be
bound.</p>
<p>"'Take the old hag out to her husband,' he ordered, as they
tore her from my brother, who lay bleeding to death among their
feet.</p>
<p>"I lost control.</p>
<p>"'Yes,' I shouted. 'You foul dog! You cowardly, inhuman devil!
You <i>Russian!</i> Bind an old woman, lest she hurt you! . . .
Bind her, and feel safe, you miserable swine!'</p>
<p>"And I contrived to spit on him.</p>
<p>"Calmly he wiped his face, and sat himself down again.</p>
<p>"'Bring the woman back, Sergeant,' he ordered quietly, 'and
send a man to tell Corporal Kyriloff to fetch the old man back,
too. . . . Bring the next prisoner before the Court.'</p>
<p>"I was dragged before his chair, my arms roped to my sides,
and my ankles bound together. He eyed me very coldly.</p>
<p>"Always beware of those who, while a seething hell of rage
boils within them, eye you coldly, and speak quietly.</p>
<p>"'You have resisted, insulted, and attempted to kill a Russian
officer in the execution of his duty,' he said quietly. . . .
'You are condemned to death. Your father has already been
condemned to death. Your brother has been put to death. . . . But
the Court is merciful. Like your ruler, the Great Czar, whom I
have the honour to serve, and against whom you Polish scum
treasonably plot and rebel, the Court is just--but it is
merciful. . . .</p>
<p>"'Of the five of you, but two shall die, and one is already
dead. . . .</p>
<p>"'Or, at any rate, the dog is dying,' he added, stirring my
brother's body with his foot, 'so but one remains.'</p>
<p>"My mother's mind rose triumphant from the abyss of horror,
woe, grief, and fear into which it had sunk while they held her
back from the body of her dying youngest-born.</p>
<p><i>"'Me! Me!</i>' she cried. 'Kill <i>me!</i> . . . They are
innocent, innocent . . .'</p>
<p>"'Gag her, if she speaks again,' growled the Lieutenant,
pouring himself out a glass of vodka.</p>
<p>"'But one remains,' he repeated, smacking his lips. 'Yes, in
my mercy, I will hang but one.'</p>
<p>"'The one who spat upon you,' I said. 'The one who will surely
kill you some day, somewhere, somehow, unless you hang him
now.'</p>
<p>"'<i>No, no,</i> my son!' shrieked my mother, and a soldier
clapped his great hand upon her mouth.</p>
<p>"'The Lieutenant will hang me,' said my father with calm
dignity.</p>
<p>"'No, the Lieutenant will <i>not</i> hang you,' replied that
Russian dog, 'but hanged you shall most assuredly be.'</p>
<p>"And turning to me, he asked in that cold, cruel voice, so
suave and quiet now:</p>
<p>"'Do you love your dear Mother?'</p>
<p>"'In a way you could not begin to understand,' I answered.</p>
<p>"'And that nice, plump, pretty little partridge, your Sister?'
he continued.</p>
<p>"'To a degree that no foul <i>animal</i> could begin to
understand,' I replied, hoping to turn all his wrath to me.</p>
<p>"What less could one do?</p>
<p>"'Ah, that is good,' he smiled. 'Most excellent. . . . And you
would save that dear Mother, and beautiful Sister, at any cost,
eh?'</p>
<p>"'From what?' I asked.</p>
<p>"'Wel-l-l,' he drawled, 'from a certain--unpleasantness. . . .
Your Mother from dying of cold and hunger in a Warsaw prison
cell, or perhaps in the Loubianka dungeons, or, possibly, on that
little stroll to Siberia. . . . Who shall say? . . .</p>
<p>"'And the nice plump partridge . . . from being "<i>the little
friend of all the soldiers</i>" when she begins to bore me. . .
.</p>
<p>"'They <i>do</i> bore one, you know,' he drawled, 'even the
prettiest of girls--in time. They mope, most of them, and fail to
realize their good fortune; or else they are spit-fires, and one
has to take--er--<i>disciplinary</i> measures.</p>
<p>"'Well, what about it? Would you like to save them, and your
own life, too?'</p>
<p>"'Yes,' I replied.</p>
<p>"'Ah, then you <i>shall</i>.'</p>
<p>"My little Lieutenant smiled.</p>
<p>"'When you've done a small job for me, that is,' he added.</p>
<p>"'How do I know that you would keep your word?' I asked.</p>
<p>"'I always keep my word,' he replied. 'It is the word of a
Russian officer.'</p>
<p>"'That is the trouble!' I remarked. But nothing could anger
him now--outwardly, that is to say.</p>
<p>"'What do you Polish boors know of the word of a gentleman?'
he continued, and then rose to his feet.</p>
<p>"'Come--we're wasting time,' he said briskly. 'You wish to
save your Mother from death, and your Sister from shame, I
understand. . . . <i>Then come and hang your father for
me</i>.'"</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 3</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The others stared aghast at the old man's twitching face. Like
most of his countrymen he was a good raconteur, and could
dramatize a tale as he told it.</p>
<p>"'<i>Hang your father'?</i>" murmured Digby Geste. "Did you
say . . ."</p>
<p>"Yes, my friends," continued Budiski. "The Russian Bear stood
declared, in all its shocking savagery. Fang and claw were
revealed. My little Russian gentleman had dropped his
semi-transparent mask of civilization. He had been struck by a
man, and now he was about to strike back as a beast--the most
terrible, relentless, savage, and hypocritical of beasts--the
Bear.</p>
<p>"Have any of you ever stood face to face with the bear, and
seen it change--change from a rather absurd, stupid, earth-bound
thing, somewhat ridiculous--into a monster, a great and
terrifying Thing reared upon its hind legs, towering above you,
capable of removing your face with one wipe of its paw, capable
of removing the front of your body with another? . . ."</p>
<p>The speaker paused, and stared into the embers of the dying
fire.</p>
<p>"You hardly believed your ears when I told of it," he
continued, turning to Digby Geste.</p>
<p>"Judge then whether we believed our ears when we heard those
words, '<i>Come and hang your father for me.</i>'</p>
<p>"We thought it was a joke--a typical Russian joke. . . .</p>
<p>"It was--but it was a <i>practical</i> joke.</p>
<p>"'Fetch the girl again,' said my Lieutenant to the Sergeant,
and the great brute, a huge Siberian, strode off and returned in
a minute with my poor Wanda--weeping, half-fainting in his
arms.</p>
<p>"'Aha, our little plump partridge! . . . Bring her here,' said
this officer and gentleman; and, as Wanda sank to the ground,
when the Sergeant put her down beside the chair, he added:</p>
<p>"'Here, wake up, my dear, don't be alarmed. . . . Your brave
brother is going to save you,' and he shook her, tearing the
shoulder of her nightgown.</p>
<p>"'Oh, thank God,' she said, and, realizing that her father had
been brought back, uttered a cry of joy, and scrambled to her
feet to rush to him.</p>
<p>"The Lieutenant pulled her back, tearing her nightgown the
more.</p>
<p>"'Gently, gently, <i>golubtchick,</i>' he said, as he drew her
to him. 'Your brother hasn't saved you <i>yet. . . .</i> He's
going to rescue you and dear Mamma from the naughty men, by doing
a little job for me.'</p>
<p>"Wanda raised trusting and grateful eyes to the face of this
nobleman--this true <i>boyar.</i> My Lieutenant smiled at her,
and cupped her chin again.</p>
<p>"'Yes, sweet child,' he added, as he kissed her.</p>
<p>"'<i>He's going to hang Papa</i>' . . . and this time his
words became real to us.</p>
<p>"We understood.</p>
<p>"'<i>No!</i>' my mother screamed. '<i>No!</i>'</p>
<p>"'<i>What?</i>' shrieked Wanda.</p>
<p>"'<i>No, no, no,</i>' screamed my mother.</p>
<p>"'Very well,' smiled my Lieutenant, and turning to the
Sergeant gave the order:</p>
<p>"'Take the old woman to the Guard Room just as she is, and the
girl to my quarters. Let <i>her</i> dress, and take what clothing
she wants."</p>
<p>"'Stop!' cried my father, as the Corporal and a couple of men
began to hustle my mother from the room, and the Sergeant seized
Wanda.</p>
<p>"'Stop. . . . <i>You will save your mother and sister, my
son,</i>' said our brave old father, a picture of noble dignity.
'You have never disobeyed me, and you will not disobey me now. Do
not hesitate for a moment. Are we Russians that we should save
ourselves by sacrificing our women? I will show these scum how a
<i>man</i> can die, and you will live to protect your mother and
sister. . . . And perhaps to avenge me ' . . .</p>
<p>"'<i>No, no, no!</i>' screamed my mother. 'Take <i>me!</i>
Take <i>me!</i>'</p>
<p>"Wanda shrieked in the Sergeant's arms.</p>
<p>"'Quick, my son,' urged my father. 'How could we live and face
each other . . . <i>afterwards? . . .</i> How <i>could</i> we? .
. . I order you to save your mother and sister. . . . How can you
hesitate?'</p>
<p>"I turned to the grinning Lieutenant.</p>
<p>"'End this joke, I beg of you, your Excellency,' I prayed.
'See, you have killed my brother. If we have done wrong, you have
punished us enough. . . . You do not make war on women and old
men. . . . Hang me, and let them go. . . . You said that two
would be enough--two out of five, and they are innocent. We have
never plotted, nor talked sedition, nor raised a hand against the
Government. . . . Be merciful. . . .'</p>
<p>"'Wel-l-l, wel-l-l,' drawled the Lieutenant, 'Mercy is
undoubtedly a beautiful thing. I will allow my soft and kindly
nature to triumph once again. . . . Yes, yes, my heart shall rule
my head. . . . Your adored Mother, and worshipped Sister, shall
go free. . . . Your well-beloved and revered father shall
<i>not</i> be hung.'</p>
<p>"'God bless you, sir,' I whispered.</p>
<p>"'No, he shall not be hung, since you intercede for him so
movingly,' he continued. '<i>He shall hang you, instead!</i>'</p>
<p>"I stared this monster in the face, incredulous--though
subconsciously I knew that he meant what he said. . . .</p>
<p>"And for the moment I was even thankful that my mother and my
sister were not there.</p>
<p>"'Well? . . . Come, hurry up! . . . I can't spend the whole
night here. Either hang your father, or let him hang you, and
thank me for my mercy,' he yawned.</p>
<p>"'Yes, my son, <i>hasten,</i>' said my father. 'Your mother
will die of cold . . . And Wanda will . . .'</p>
<p>"Oh, my God. . . .</p>
<p>"'Father,' I cried, 'let <i>me</i> die.'</p>
<p>"'Silence, my son,' replied the old man. 'Show now of what
stuff we sons of Poland are made. . . . You are young and strong,
and I look to you to protect your mother and sister--to work for
them . . . to comfort them . . . to save them . . . And to
<i>remember</i> . . . I am old and feeble, and near my end. . . .
It is a strong man they need. . . . Obey me for the last time, as
you have always obeyed me.'</p>
<p>"And the terrible knowledge grew in my heart that I must drink
of this cup. How could I thrust this burden upon my father--this
crushing burden, this unbearable cross for him to carry to his
grave? For, through every day and hour and minute that he lived,
he would have the burning, corroding thought of the deed that he
had done. Death would be nothing to it.</p>
<p>"I would choose the harder part. . . .</p>
<p>"But some day I would meet this devilish Russian, face to
face. . . .</p>
<p>"'So be it,' I said. 'Give me your blessing, my father.'</p>
<p>"And the brave old man thanked, praised, and blessed me.</p>
<p>"I turned to the Lieutenant.</p>
<p>"'If it is possible that you can do this thing,' I said; 'if
you <i>can</i> look forward to remembering this night upon your
death-bed; if your own soldiers will not prove to be human
beings, tear you limb from limb, and stamp you into the mud where
you belong--I will save my mother and sister.'</p>
<p>"The Lieutenant smiled.</p>
<p>"'Ah,' he remarked silkily. 'I doubt if <i>you</i> will ever
spit upon a Russian officer again . . . any more than your dead
brother will strike one!'</p>
<p>"He sent two men with orders that my mother and sister be
brought back forthwith.</p>
<p>"By the time they arrived, my father was standing beneath the
'suitable' tree, the noose about his neck, the rope dangling from
the branch above.</p>
<p>"And God was merciful, for my mother, with a terrible cry of
'<i>Jan! Jan!</i>' sank down senseless upon the show.</p>
<p>"I glanced from my mother to Wanda, and saw that her body was
hanging inanimate in the arms of the big Sergeant.</p>
<p>"Her eyes were closed.</p>
<p>"'<i>Now,</i> my son,' said my father in a firm voice. . .

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c207" id="c207"><i>The Devil and Digby
Geste</i></a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 1</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Look here," said Digby Geste, known locally as
<i>légionnaire</i> Thomas Jones No. 18896, "will you kindly
endeavour to get into your magnificent brain, Monsieur Tant de
Soif, once and for all, the fact that I will <i>not</i> drink
absinthe with you? . . . Very kind of you, and all that; but I
don't like it, and I don't want it, and I'm not going to drink
it."</p>
<p>"And would you have me <i>faire Suisse?</i>" asked the
<i>légionnaire</i> Tant de Soif, as, with trembling hands, he
poured an evil-looking fluid from his water-bottle into a tin
mug.</p>
<p>"I don't care what you <i>faire,</i> you old marvel, so long
as you don't <i>faire</i> yourself a nuisance. If you do I'll
pour that muck out on the sand."</p>
<p>Tant de Soif shuddered.</p>
<p>"Hush!" he begged. "Do not utter such horrible words--even in
jest! . . . It is a kind of blasphemy," and he drank deeply from
his mug.</p>
<p>"<i>Horrible</i> language," he grumbled, wiping his bearded
lips with the back of his hand. "Never heard anything like it in
all my forty years of soldiering--and I've heard some awful
language, too, in the <i>Marsouins</i> <sup>1</sup> and the
Legion. . . . And so I must <i>faire Suisse</i> at last--after
fifty years of soldiering! . . ."</p>
<p> </p>
<p><sup>1</sup> Colonial Infantry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Once again, <i>faire</i> what you like, only don't
<i>faire</i> nuisance. That's just what you are when you're
drunk--'a fair nuisance.'"</p>
<p>"Eh? . . . <i>Mon Dieu! . . .</i> <i>To me! . . .</i> After
sixty years of soldiering! . . . What did you say? A <i>nuisance?
. . .</i> Say it again. . . ."</p>
<p>And, with drunken gravity, old Tant de Soif rose to his feet,
drew his sword-bayonet, and advanced upon the admired comrade
whom he loved as a son.</p>
<p>"Say it--<i>hic</i>--again if you please," he requested.</p>
<p>"<i>Vous êtes une peste pour tout le monde,</i>" repeated
Digby slowly. "Understand? A nuisance to everybody, when you're
drunk."</p>
<p>And, seizing the bayonet with his left hand, he gave the aged
gentleman a shove with his right. The bayonet and its owner
parted company.</p>
<p>"A nuisance when I'm drunk?" murmured Tant de Soif
incredulously, as he sat suddenly down. "And am I to hear
<i>that</i> said of me, after seventy years of soldiering? . . .
Why, I was born drunk--I've lived drunk, and shall <i>die</i>
drunk! and be a loved and respected centenarian soldier. . . .
Yes. . . . The Government will give me a tomb like that of
Fräulein Eberhardt, the Spahi Sergeant, at Figuig. . . . On it
they will write the dignified and simple epitaph, '<i>One hundred
years a soldier.</i>'"</p>
<p>A tear trickled from the eye of Tant de Soif as he
contemplated his apotheosis.</p>
<p>"More likely '<i>One hundred years drunk,</i>' you old
lunatic," laughed Digby Geste. "That's what you are--the original
and authentic Lunatic among the Tombs."</p>
<p>"Undeniably we are in a tomb," replied Tant de Soif, nodding
his head thoughtfully, "but it is not <i>I</i> who am the
lunatic. . . . It is not <i>I</i> who am refusing good liquor. .
. . No, indeed! . . . Nor have I, in eighty years of soldiering,
met a man who <i>did. . . .</i> No, not until this night. . . .
And now I am in a tomb with him. <i>I</i>, Tant de Soif, with a
lunatic in the Tomb."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In a tomb they undoubtedly were, and in a place of tombs,
built none knew how many centuries before--perhaps on the site of
some battlefield, where great men had fallen and received
princely sepulture. Or possibly some holy and far-famed
<i>marabout</i> had dwelt at this tiny oasis, had been buried
here by the sorrowing devout; and around his tomb had been laid
those of the pious who had wished to sleep near him in death, as
they had dwelt near him in life.</p>
<p>In the largest of these tombs the two <i>légionnaires</i> had
taken up a strategic position for the night. Fastening the still
practicable heavy door, and using the two horizontal tombstones
as beds, they had converted the mosque-like <i>taj</i> into a
barrack-room and a fort.</p>
<p>The two graves were extraordinarily reminiscent of a pair of
crusader, princely, or episcopal tombs in a European
cathedral--save that no recumbent effigy adorned the large, flat,
oblong stone that formed the top of each. Ideal beds--if a little
hard--roomy, level three feet from the ground, and thus well
above the sphere of operations of scorpion, serpent, and
objectionable insect left by pariah dog or wandering beggar.</p>
<p>As though in their heat-warped and horrible caserne at Tokotu,
whence they had come on this patrol, the two soldiers made ready
for the night, and, having cleaned their accoutrements and folded
the clothing they had removed, laid themselves down upon their
cold and silent tombs--their temporary graves, as Digby Geste
described them. The "night attire" of the latter consisted of
white canvas shoes, belted canvas trousers, and a short-sleeved
white shirt. Tant de Soif, for reasons best known to himself,
wore only his <i>képi</i> and his boots. He explained, with
convincing clarity, that, in the case of emergency, he was thus
protected against the sun (or moon) at the one end and against
sharp stones and thorns at the other; while, if no emergency
arose, all was still well, as it was obvious to the meanest
intelligence that if the head and the feet were kept hot, the
intervening and adjacent tracts must inevitably be benefited and
remain in a satisfactory condition.</p>
<p>"So you always sleep in your <i>képi</i> to keep your tummy
warm, eh?" observed Digby, as he settled his head upon his
knapsack.</p>
<p>"And my boots to keep the lumbar regions protected," was the
reply. "I have suffered from lumbago, and one cannot be too
careful . . . especially when one has no blood in one's veins. .
. . I have no blood at all, and, when wounded, I bleed
absinthe."</p>
<p>"Valuable gift," murmured his companion sleepily. "Good idea.
Every man his own canteen. Like the pelican in the wilderness, or
the camel feeding on its own hump. . . . G'night, Gran'pa, and
don't you dare speak another word till daylight doth appear. . .
."</p>
<p>Ere he fell asleep the thoughts of Digby Geste wandered.
First, to Brandon Abbas, where dwelt the girl who had been his
life's sunshine, the sound of whose voice had been his life's
music, for a brief sight of whose face he would now have given
almost anything--certainly a year of his life.</p>
<p>"Darling Isobel," he murmured. "Darling, Faithful Hound," and
smiled. Next he thought of his brothers, Michael and John, at the
Fort of Zinderneuf.</p>
<p>"Dear old Beau. . . . Dear old John. . . . Hope all's well
with them. . . . Wish to God I could get transferred there. They
must be having a thin time with Lejaune. . . . Wonder if de
Beaujolais would listen to me if I asked to be sent there. . .
.</p>
<p>"Glad old St. André and Maris, and Cordier are there too.
Decent chaps. . . . Wish Hank and Buddy were--much as I should
miss them at Tokotu.</p>
<p>"Wonder if I and old Tant de Soif ought to keep watch and
watch? . . . No point in doing so, really. If a raiding-party
come, they come--and they get us, anyhow. . . . And it wouldn't
be till dawn. . . . I shall be awake by then. . . ."</p>
<p>But Digby Geste was awakened before dawn.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Silence. . . .</p>
<p>Outside the tomb a world of silence--a Universe of Silence,
broken only by the occasional sound of a soft, light footstep,
almost inaudible.</p>
<p>Silence and stillness, upon which the great full moon looked
down . . . upon the illimitable desert, all patined with fine
silver, over which the shadows thrown by the few scattered palms
and by the ancient domed and minareted mosques lay black as
ink.</p>
<p>Into one of these mosques the great moon peeped, and by the
light of her own rays beheld, through a narrow unglazed window,
two faces--the one innocent, calm, peacefully happy, the other
debased, scarred, haunted, contorted in the agony of some
miserable nightmare.</p>
<p>The moon watched. . . .</p>
<p>Suddenly at the opposite aperture, appeared the face of
another watcher--a horrible face, a terrible face--long, gaunt,
bearded, with the shallow, soulless eyes of a beast.</p>
<p>Within the tomb, silence, broken only by the sound of
breathing, and an occasional sigh from Digby; from Tant de Soif a
groan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 2</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An unusually loud groan from the restless veteran awoke his
young comrade from a deep dream of peace. The latter raised his
head from the knapsack on which it rested.</p>
<p>"What's up, Daddy?" he said, and yawned.</p>
<p>The old man murmured something concerning a <i>courant
d'air,</i> and the extreme unwholesomeness of ventilation.</p>
<p>With a laugh the boy sat up, stretched and yawned hugely, and,
with a remark to the effect that, in his own callow and
uninstructed mind, he regarded absinthe as even more unwholesome
than fresh air, he spread Tant de Soif's <i>capote</i> over him
and bade him be of good cheer, for he couldn't much longer
survive the troubles of this vale of woe.</p>
<p>Returning to his stony couch, Digby gazed around the moonlit
chamber, so chapel-like with its high, narrow "windows," its pair
of tombs, high, vaulted roof, and stone-flagged floor. In the
moonlight the figure of old Tant de Soif might well have been a
stone effigy, as he lay like a warrior taking his rest, with his
martial cloak around him.</p>
<p>The boy closed his eyes.</p>
<p>Darling Isobel. . . .</p>
<p>What was she doing now? . . .</p>
<p>Sleeping, of course. . . . Sleeping in her moonlit, panelled
room at Brandon Abbas. . . .</p>
<p>Same jolly old moon that was looking into this mosque was
peeping through the leaded panes of her casement. Funny if she
were awake, too, and wondering whether he were looking at the
moon at that moment. . . .</p>
<p>Darling Isobel! When would he see her again? Not till his five
years were up, anyhow; unless, of course, they were sent back to
Sidi-bel-Abbés and she came there. . . . Even when their time had
expired they couldn't go back to Brandon Abbas until that
astounding business was cleared up. . . . Beau running off in
that extraordinary way. . . .</p>
<p>And young John, the silly young ass! . . . Daring to run away
from home, too, like his elders and betters--a child like that. .
. . A good year junior to the twins. . . . Frightful little ass.
. . . That's what happens when the young are released from
proper, repressive discipline. . . . Very 'cute of him, though,
to guess that they had joined the Legion. . . . Pretty mess he'd
have found himself in if he'd been wrong. . . . Dear old Johnny.
. . . How ghastly if anything happened to him. . . . Thank God he
was with Beau. . . . Beau would look after him all right. . . .
Yes, Beau would look after him.</p>
<p>Yawns. . . .</p>
<p>Digby Geste slept.</p>
<p>And was awakened later by a blood-curdling yell--a terrible
scream, like that of a wounded horse. In almost one movement he
was on his feet, crouching between the tombs, his rifle in his
hands, his head turning swiftly from window to window at the
opposite sides of the chamber--the one idea on his mind being of
an Arab raid.</p>
<p>Nothing at either window.</p>
<p>No rifles thrust through the ten-inch aperture, between the
stone sides of the high, narrow openings. No heavy blows upon the
door. . . .</p>
<p>And then he was aware that Tant de Soif was pointing with
trembling hand to the window nearest to him--the one through
which the moon did not shed her soft light. Bringing his rifle
swiftly round, he "covered" the aperture and waited.</p>
<p>Strange! . . . Why hadn't the devils shot at them from both
windows as they slept? And why hadn't old Tant de Soif made one
jump for his gun? Why had he screamed like a tortured woman, and
why was he still lying there, trembling from head to foot? Old
Tant de Soif, with his <i>Médaille Militaire,</i> brave as a
lion?</p>
<p>"Arabs?" whispered Digby.</p>
<p>"No, no," groaned the old soldier. "Oh, my God! . . . God
forgive me . . . forgive me all my wickedness. . . . <i>Oh, mon
Général le bon Dieu,</i> have mercy on an old soldier . . .
<i>première classe</i> . . ."</p>
<p>"What <i>is</i> it, you old fool?" urged Digby, breaking upon
the prayer. "God helps those who help themselves. What <i>is</i>
it, if it isn't Arabs? A lion, or a . . . rabbit, or what?"</p>
<p>"<i>Hush!</i> Don't blaspheme," whispered Tant de Soif,
turning from the window, flinging his arms about Digby, and
crushing his bearded face against the boy's breast.</p>
<p>There was no doubt that the old man had had a terrible fright,
and, indeed, a terrible shock. He was sober enough now, and in a
state of absolute, utter terror.</p>
<p>There is nothing more infectious than panic, terror, fear--and
particularly fear of the utterly unknown.</p>
<p>Perfect love casteth out fear. So doth perfect anger--and a
good deal more quickly. Digby's anger was certainly perfect--at
being awakened; at being made to jump and take cover; at
being--well--frightened or at any rate threatened with fright--by
this old drunkard.</p>
<p>"What <i>is</i> it?" he repeated. "What did you see--or think
you saw?" And his free hand was upon Tant de Soif heavily laid,
though not in the way of kindness.</p>
<p>But Tant de Soif could say nothing. His teeth were chattering
with fright.</p>
<p>It was useless to be angry with the old man. He was most
obviously terrified almost to death.</p>
<p>"What <i>is</i> it, old chap? What did you see?" Digby asked
again, without taking his eyes from the narrow aperture, of which
the base or window-sill was some three feet from the ground.
"What did you see?"</p>
<p>"<i>The Devil himself!</i>" whispered Tant de Soif, and, with
a hollow groan, let his head fall heavily back upon the
stone.</p>
<p>"Oh--<i>the Devil?</i>" replied the incensed Digby. "Is
<i>that</i> all! . . . I'll show you something worse than the
Devil if you wake me up again with your nightmares--you walking
whisky-flask; you woolly-witted wine-cask; you bibulous
brandy-bottle, you . . ."</p>
<p>"Oh, God!" moaned the old soldier. "Oh, Jesus Christ! Oh, Holy
Virgin! Guard me this night. It was <i>the Devil himself.</i> The
Devil has come for me--at last! . . ."</p>
<p>"Well, he hasn't <i>got</i> you yet, has he?" expostulated
Digby. "And he won't. . . . But <i>I</i> will. <i>I'll</i> get
you all right, old son, if you wake me up again."</p>
<p>"The Devil has come for me, and I am dying," groaned the old
soldier as he turned his face again toward the window. "We were
mad to come in here. . . . It is a sepulchre. . . . This tomb is
my bed, and this bed will be my tomb."</p>
<p>"It'll be all <i>that,"</i> replied Digby, "if you don't shut
up. Go to sleep, you silly old ass. Do you think the Devil's a
fool, that he should want <i>you</i> in. . . ."</p>
<p>An awful scream interrupted the speaker as the lower part of
the unglazed "window" was filled by a truly appalling face.</p>
<p>Tant de Soif again flung himself upon his comrade, effectually
pinning his arms to his sides.</p>
<p>Digby Geste was a brave man--young, strong, healthy, and
devoid of nerves. He felt his blood run cold, his knees weaken,
his heart pound furiously, and the cold perspiration start forth
upon his skin.</p>
<p>Not one of these symptoms would have been evoked by the sight
of the most evil face of any human being, Negro or Arab, looking
at him from behind a levelled gun. Rather would Digby Geste's
pulse have tingled with the joy of battle as he jerked his rifle
forward, and tried to shoot ere he was shot.</p>
<p>But this was face neither of Arab nor of Negro. . . . Nor of
any human being.</p>
<p>Tant de Soif looked again, and shrieked again--the dreadful,
agonized shriek of a madman.</p>
<p>It was <i>not</i> a human face. It was the face of a . . . the
face of a <i>devil. . . .</i> The face of <i>the</i> Devil!</p>
<p>Yes . . . merciful God . . . from the forehead that overhung
the glowing luminescent eyes--the dreadful, shallow, bestial,
devilish eyes--to the bearded chin, the face was fiendish. . .
.</p>
<p>The hideous mouth, with its great strong white teeth, opened
to speak, and closed again in silence. The hideous lips twitched
in a sneering smile, and the whole awful face, long, gaunt, and
hairy, leered with a hellish malignity, triumphant, terrible,
cruel beyond expression.</p>
<p>But Digby Geste was more afraid of fear than of the Devil.
Wrenching himself free from the frenzied clutch of Tant de Soif,
he threw his rifle to his shoulder--only to find it torn almost
from his hands as Tant de Soif seized it, and scrambling to his
knees, fell upon him.</p>
<p>"<i>Don't! Don't!</i>" he screamed. "<i>It is the Devil. . .
.</i> You <i>cannot</i> shoot the Devil."</p>
<p>"Watch me," laughed Digby, his own man again, and with a
strong thrust sent Tant de Soif sprawling on the ground,
instantly raising his rifle as he did so.</p>
<p>But the Devil had gone.</p>
<p>Nothing was to be seen, but the silvered sandhills, and some
distant palms.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Digby lowered his rifle and stared aghast. Was this a
nightmare? No, he was awake, and here was Tant de Soif clasping
him round the knees, and praying to God and to the Devil
impartially.</p>
<p>Was it hypnotism . . . auto-suggestion . . .
hetero-suggestion? Was he, for some reason, seeing with his own
eyes what this poor drunken old sot, in an attack of delirium
tremens, thought he saw with his? Was there something in the
physical or psychic atmosphere of this ancient mausoleum that was
supernatural or, at any rate, super-normal? <i>Were</i> there
djinns in these lone desert places?</p>
<p>"<i>Kneel down and pray! . . . Kneel down and pray!</i>"
gabbled Tant de Soif.</p>
<p>"Stand up and watch, more sense," replied Digby. "There's a
time for everything. . . . Get up and get your rifle."</p>
<p>"You can't fight <i>the Devil,</i>" groaned Tant de Soif.</p>
<p>"There isn't any devil," affirmed Digby.</p>
<p>"Haven't we just <i>seen</i> him, you fool?" replied the
drunkard.</p>
<p>"And if we can see him we can shoot him. . . . Pull yourself
together, you old coward," growled Digby.</p>
<p>"I'm not a coward. I fear nothing human, nothing solid. . .
."</p>
<p>"Pity you don't fear nothing liquid, too. . . . Absinthe, for
example. . . ."</p>
<p>Yes, that was all very well, but he, Digby Geste, had never
tasted absinthe in his life, and most undoubtedly he had seen
what Tant de Soif saw. . . . Seen it clearly and unmistakably,
and for at least a minute. . . . Had seen the dreadful eyes move,
the ghastly mouth smile horribly.</p>
<p>Stooping, he pulled Tant de Soif to his feet.</p>
<p>"Now, then," he said. "Pull yourself together, you wretched
old woman. Put on your overcoat, and pick up your rifle. Cover
that other window, while I cover this one. . . . If nothing
happens I'm going outside for a scout round. . . . If it's the
Devil, I want to see a bit more of him. . . . Cloven hoof, and
all that. . . ."</p>
<p>But Tant de Soif was past self-help.</p>
<p>"For the love of <i>God</i> don't open that door," he
stuttered. "Don't leave me. . . . For the love of <i>Christ</i>
don't leave me. I . . ."</p>
<p>"Look!" he shrieked, and collapsed. The Face had reappeared at
the window. . . . Terrible, gleaming, yellow eyes. . . . Inhuman,
sub-human, devilish, shallow eyes. . . . Terrible, inhuman mouth
with twitching lips and gleaming teeth. . . . A gargoyle face,
the face of the Devil as portrayed in ancient books,
wood-carvings and gargoyles.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Digby Geste raised his rifle, and the lips parted in a brutish
smile.</p>
<p>Digby Geste stood firm and steady, the foresight of his weapon
pointing between the gleaming eyes--eyes that shone as though
each contained a glowing core of fire--his forefinger curled
about the trigger--and did not fire.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly he had been frightened. He was not frightened now,
and he refused to panic. He was not going to blow a hole in the
middle of a face simply because he didn't like the look of it.
That was not the sort of thing that Beau would do. To shoot first
and ask after was to exhibit the fear of which he was afraid. . .
.</p>
<p>Stalemate. . . .</p>
<p>The devilish Face watched him, and he covered the devilish
Face.</p>
<p>Stalemate. . . .</p>
<p>His arms were growing tired. . . .</p>
<p>Why didn't the Thing do something? Did it calmly await his
futile shot, secure in the knowledge of its immunity? . . .
<i>Was</i> it a devil? . . . <i>The</i> devil?</p>
<p>That dreadful, impish, evil face . . . that hairy, bearded
mask of evil . . .</p>
<p>Mask! . . . Mask? . . . Was this some Arab trick to frighten
them? . . . To drive them, screaming in terror, from their
stronghold?</p>
<p>Absurd! The man could have shot them sleeping. . . . Perhaps
he had no gun.</p>
<p>The great mouth opened.</p>
<p>No, that was a face, and not a mask. Should he fire? No. One
does not shoot an "unarmed," unarmoured Face.</p>
<p>Digby Geste lowered his rifle and backed slowly to the door,
his eyes fixed upon those other terrible eyes that followed his
every movement.</p>
<p>"Tant de Soif!" he called. "Get up and open this door. Tant de
Soif--you coward--get up!"</p>
<p>Tant de Soif stirred, struggled to his feet, glanced at the
Face, howled, rushed to his comrade, not to obey him, but to get
behind him.</p>
<p>Turning his back upon the Face, Digby thrust Tant de Soif
aside, knocked up the heavy bar with the butt of his rifle,
glanced across the tomb at the motionless, basilisk head, dashed
through the doorway, his rifle at the ready, crept round the
building, turning the second corner, and there beheld, up-reared
upon the cloven hooves of its hind legs, a large billy-goat.</p>

<h1><a name="c208" id="c208"><i>The Mule</i></a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 1</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is said that there is good in everyone, and that though the
whitest sheep has a black or a grey hair somewhere, there is no
black sheep so black that he has not one grey lock, if he cannot
boast a white one.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, <i>le légionnaire</i> Xarro, blackest of
black sheep, did marvellously conceal the fact if he possessed
the faintest redeeming shade of lighter colour.</p>
<p>Although admittedly a black sheep, <i>le légionnaire</i> Xarro
was known as "The Mule." This name had been bestowed upon him
only partly in tribute to the fact that he was astonishingly
mulish, surly, cross-grained, stupid, malevolent and dangerous.
For the other part, the name was esteemed appropriate by reason
of the fact that the company mules apparently accepted him as a
friend and a brother. He was one with them, and they were at one
with him. No mule ever kicked, bit, thwarted or disobeyed <i>le
légionnaire</i> Xarro. Mules were his friends, if not, as his
comrades averred, his relations. A fiendishly cruel man, who
delighted to torture other animals, and to devise tortures which
he hoped some day to inflict upon Arab men, women and children,
he was never cruel to a mule.</p>
<p>Nor was this merely one of those beautiful instances of virtue
being its own reward, and kindness begetting kindness. Digby
Geste was just as kind to his mule as Xarro was to his, but this
did not induce the beast to lose any opportunity of kicking or
biting Digby; of slipping his heel-rope and absenting himself
without leave; of throwing his load whenever he could; of
instigating his fellows to stampede, and generally of being as
ungrateful, obnoxious and exasperating as only a mule can be.</p>
<p>Digby Geste loved animals, and hated this mule as he had never
hated anything before--with good reason--and the more he hated
it, the more kindly he treated it. The more kindly he treated it,
the more evil it seemed to grow--<i>seemed</i>--because no one
would care to state categorically that there was room for it to
grow more evil. . . .</p>
<p>Yet when this same mule was in the hands of <i>le
légionnaire</i> Xarro, it was the Perfect Mule--an animal without
moral spot or blemish, wearing in its head-stall the white flower
of a blameless life.</p>
<p>It pleased the good Xarro enormously that any peculiarly
intractable and unmanageable mule should be handed over to him
with the sure and certain knowledge that, while in his hands, it
would be entirely docile.</p>
<p>Had <i>le légionnaire</i> Xarro been any other than <i>le
légionnaire</i> Xarro, he would have been promoted, and made one
of the non-commissioned personnel at a Mounted Infantry depôt
where men and mules are trained. He might have become
Sergeant-Major or even <i>Adjudant,</i> and had a glorious
opportunity of exercising his markedly developed traits of
cruelty, malevolence, brutality and spite, upon <i>les
légionnaires,</i> whom he hated collectively and
individually.</p>
<p>But, in spite of these qualities, it was quite impossible to
promote <i>ce bon</i> Xarro. He was too utterly unreliable and
untrustworthy; too debauched, depraved and slovenly; too mean,
ineffectual and stupid; too bad a soldier, and too good a liar,
thief and drunkard.</p>
<p>Nor can it be urged in his favour that he was fond of his
mules.</p>
<p>Love is a lovely thing--if it be only love for a mule; but
Xarro loved them no more than he did pariah dogs of the
<i>Village Nègre,</i> wild cats of the rocks, and vultures of the
air.</p>
<p>When a mule was hit by a bullet, fell down a precipice, or
suffered a broken leg and was butchered to become steaks and
cutlets for hungry soldiers, he was inordinately amused, and
apparently very pleased.</p>
<p>No, he certainly did not love them, but he understood them,
and they understood him, and were perfectly <i>en
rapport.</i></p>
<p>It was said--and probably truly--that he had been a muleteer
"in real life" (that is to say before he joined the Legion), and
had been bred and born among mules, thinking their thoughts,
feeling their sensations, needs, desires and sufferings, and,
moreover, speaking their language--this last because he uttered
words, if such sounds could be called words, which the mules
understood.</p>
<p>Digby Geste, watching him, was reminded of what Uncle Hector
had told him about <i>mahouts</i> in India, who undeniably had an
elephant-language which their charges understood and obeyed.</p>
<p>Seated on his mule, Xarro, without movement of hand or heel,
could cause his mount to sidle a few paces to the right or to the
left, to advance a few steps or to rein back--merely by the use
of a single word for each movement. His mule would halt,
about-turn, or wheel to the right or left, at a word. More, it
would lift a left or right hoof, come to its fore-knees, or lie
upon the ground, at Xarro's command.</p>
<p>His particular beast, known as "Satan," was a rare black
animal, big beyond the size of large mules, and, save in the
hands of Xarro himself, a fitter inmate of a cage in a Zoological
Gardens than a place in a mule-line. Among mules, Satan was as
objectionable and detestable as Xarro was among men.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 2</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have it on excellent authority that we needs must love the
highest when we see it. <i>Le légionnaire</i> Xarro must have
been an exception to this golden rule. Definitely he did not love
the highest when he saw it. Hating all his officers,
non-commissioned officers and comrades, he hated the best most.
For scoundrels like Bolidar, Boldini, Guantaio and Vogué (all now
away at Zinderneuf) he had quite a mild detestation.</p>
<p>The three English brothers, who called themselves Brown, Jones
and Smith respectively, he loathed peculiarly, and of these the
one named Jones, who was here at Tokotu, he abhorred most of all.
Was he not always merry and bright, laughing and smiling--curse
him! As if there were anything whatever to laugh or smile about,
in this devilish world! Was he not always pleasant and
friendly--damn him!--in contrast to one's own morose ill-humoured
surliness? Was he not open and frank and generous--blast him! Was
he not popular and cool and unafraid? Was he not rich, a
gentleman, an aristocrat? Yes, and after all, what was he, with
all his airs and graces, but a damned jewel-thief, hiding from
the English police? Who was <i>he</i> to give himself airs, and
walk in pride?</p>
<p>Pride goeth before a fall. Aha, yes, <i>a fall! . . .</i> A
bright idea! . . . And <i>le légionnaire</i> Xarro showed a
mouthful of blackened and broken teeth, in an artful and evil
grin.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 3</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Sunday pants of Holy Moses! What in Hell's that guy Xarro up
to <i>now?</i>" exclaimed Buddy to his friend Hank one evening,
as, having strolled beyond the rough and dirty camp known as
<i>le Village Nègre,</i> they seated themselves upon the summit
of a sand-dune and gazed across the stretch of level country, an
unbroken plain of rock, sand, and gravel, which stretched before
them.</p>
<p>Unaware of their presence, Xarro and Satan, a couple of
hundred metres distant, were engaged upon some mutually diverting
exercise. It soon became apparent to the interested watchers that
Satan was learning a new trick, or rather was learning to do,
instantly and methodically, at the word of command, what he
sometimes did at the prompting of idle errant fancy. He was
learning to roll--on his back, over and over, to and fro, bent
legs waving in the air--as, and when, ordered to do so.</p>
<p>Hank and Buddy who, in their time, had played many parts and
been many things to many men, were intrigued.</p>
<p>"Say, that guy and his burro ought to be in vaudeville," quoth
Hank.</p>
<p>"Sure thing," agreed Buddy, "Xarro and his Performing
Mule."</p>
<p>"And a prize to be given for the first member of the audience
as correctly guesses which is the mule."</p>
<p>Their usual laconic silence then descended upon them, and they
watched.</p>
<p>Satan stood at attention, Xarro three paces in front of him,
both motionless.</p>
<p>Suddenly Xarro uttered a single word of command, and down went
Satan as though shot.</p>
<p>Thrice he rolled from left to right and right to left, arose
to his feet, and stood like a graven image--of wickedness.</p>
<p>Xarro strolled away, and, from a few yards distance, threw a
word over his shoulder. Instantly the mule rolled, and arose
again. Xarro returned, patted the animal's neck, and gave it
something from his pocket. Proceeding to the rear of the
imaginary rank which Satan adorned, Xarro wheeled about, and
again at a few yards distance uttered a word of command from
behind the mule, and again Satan rolled.</p>
<p>Xarro now varied the proceedings. Placing his hands on Satan's
back he lightly vaulted astride him, and sitting with folded arms
bade the mule rein back, right close, left close, advance, about
turn, walk march, right wheel, left wheel and halt. He then, once
again, uttered the sharp short word of command, and sprang clear
as the beast instantly obeyed, threw itself down and rolled
thrice upon its back.</p>
<p>"Say, Hank, what d'you know about <i>that,</i>" murmured
Buddy, as the last man&oelig;uvre was again repeated. "He surely
is the World's Champion Mule-Tamer. What's the idee?"</p>
<p>"Got me guessing, Bud," was the reply. "P'raps he plans to get
a job lion-taming in a circus, when he's through with the
Legion."</p>
<p>"He surely does understand mules," said Buddy. "I've known
guys make horses act that way, but I allow he's the first man
ever taught a mule to sit up and beg. Wonder how he does it?"</p>
<p>"Power of the human eye over the savage beast," opined
Hank.</p>
<p>"Pity he don't try it on the Sergeant-Major then," observed
Buddy, rising to his feet, and the two sauntered back to the
<i>poste.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 4</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The mule<i>-peloton</i> out on a recognizance patrol was
taking an "easy" in the shadow of a great rock, or small cliff,
that marked the turning point of their journey, and weary men
stood easing weary limbs, each at the head of what one would have
supposed to be a weary mule.</p>
<p>Not so, however, the four-legged fiend in mule-skin in charge
of Digby Geste. The phrase is ambiguous, and so was the
situation, inasmuch as the mule appeared at times to be in
Digby's charge, and the mule at times to be in charge of
Digby.</p>
<p>Suddenly the devil entered into the beast, or else the devil
that never left it awoke, and with an energy rarely displayed in
a legitimate cause, the perverse animal began to back, to kick,
to buck, rear and plunge, as though its soul's salvation depended
upon creating the maximum of confusion in the ranks, wrath in the
Commandant, and despair in the unfortunate Digby. A torrent of
abuse from the Sergeant-Major did nothing to help the matter,
though it seemed to amuse and exhilarate the mule who, with a
neigh of laughter, bounded the more vigorously and struggled the
more violently to be free, free to roam the wide desert o'er,
untrammelled and untied.</p>
<p>Genuine hearty mule laughter!</p>
<p>'<i>He saith among the trumpets ha, ha! and he smelleth the
battle afar off, the thunder of the captains and the
shouting,</i>' quoted Digby from the book of Job.</p>
<p>"There will certainly be some thunder from the Captain in a
minute, and the Sergeant-Major is undoubtedly shouting," he
added, as he clung to the equine-asinine rebel.</p>
<p>The mule, rearing and lashing out with his forefeet, made a
noble effort for liberty and self-determination.</p>
<p>But Digby Geste had a word to say to that, and the struggle
continued.</p>
<p>Giving his rein to his right-hand man, <i>le légionnaire</i>
Xarro stepped up to the kicking, struggling mule and quieted it
with a word.</p>
<p>"That's the way to handle a mule," he said. "You take mine,
and I'll ride this one back. But remember this. You mustn't hit
it or touch it with your heel. If you want to steady it, you must
just say '<i>Brrrtsch</i>'--like that. Understand? Just
'<i>Brrrtsch</i>'--and especially when we are on that narrow path
with a precipice on one side, and a cliff on the other be sure to
say '<i>Brrrtsch</i>' and it'll prick up its ears, and know you
for a friend. See?"</p>
<p>"Thanks very much," replied Digby. "But I'll stick to this
Father of Vice."</p>
<p>"Don't be a fool," urged Xarro. "You'll find my mule like a
lady's hack."</p>
<p>"Thanks again, very much," replied Digby. "It's very good of
you, but I mustn't let this beast get the better of me. I must
make it quite clear that it is out with me, and not I with
it."</p>
<p>"It'll get away," persisted Xarro, "and you'll do fifty-two
days' solitary confinement for a start, if it's lost. You go and
take old Satan. He's more like an Arab horse than a mule. And
don't forget to say '<i>Brrrtsch</i>,' when you want to steady
him."</p>
<p>"It's most kind of you, Xarro," said Digby again, "but I
really mustn't let this beast defeat me."</p>
<p>"More afraid of Satan, I suppose," jeered Xarro. "Afraid he'll
play some trick on you, eh?"</p>
<p>"Put it like that if you wish," replied Digby. "Anyhow, I'll
stick to this moke. Thanks all the same."</p>
<p>And with a sneering laugh, Xarro shrugged his shoulders and
turned to Satan.</p>
<p>However, although <i>le légionnaire</i> Xarro had not done all
that he intended to do, he had done something, for Digby's mule
gave no further trouble, either on the narrow and dangerous
mountain path or upon the open plain.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 5</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Digby Geste, alias <i>le légionnaire</i> Thomas Jones, was
duzzled. An unsavoury comrade of the name of Xarro whom he
particularly disliked was making repeated overtures of
friendship, and equally often-repeated suggestions that Digby
should ride his mule Satan. It seemed an obsession with the man,
and he was particularly urgent when the <i>peloton</i> was at a
maximum distance from Tokotu, or about to pass through difficult
and dangerous mountain country.</p>
<p>But <i>le légionnaire</i> Xarro had made a great mistake. He
had dared <i>le légionnaire</i> Jones to ride the mule! He had
foolishly said:</p>
<p>"Jones, I'm willing to bet any amount that you are afraid to
ride Satan. You would like to do so, but you refuse because you
haven't the pluck."</p>
<p>To which Digby had replied:</p>
<p>"Obviously that must be the reason. It needs a hero like you
to ride the old black moke," and neither jeers nor cajolings
could induce Digby to do so.</p>
<p>What he did do was frequently and lengthily to wonder what the
man's object could be. Doubtless Satan would give anyone but
Xarro a great deal of trouble, but he couldn't give Digby more
trouble than did the malevolent Son of Sin and Sorrow with whom
he was at present afflicted.</p>
<p>One thing was very certain. Xarro--the surly, quarrelsome,
insolent Xarro; the malignant, sly, dangerous Xarro; full of
ill-will, ill-nature and ill-breeding--was not offering the mule
to Digby for Digby's good. It was very puzzling. . . .</p>
<p>But one tragic day the puzzle was solved--quite horribly.</p>
<p>The Mule-Company to which Digby was attached rode out from
Tokotu one red-hot morning, on a forty-eight hours' patrol and
tactical exercise as Mounted Infantry. On this occasion they were
given admirable exercise, for they were followed at a most
respectful distance by a Targui scout, and when at night they
halted and made their desert bivouac, he rode off with the glad
news that rifles were to be had for the snatching; mules to be
captured, and Roumis to be hunted down, shot and tortured.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>A little camp was pitched in the form of a square, the
mule-lines in the centre, each man sleeping in his own <i>tente
d'abri</i> which, being only one foot high, two feet wide, and
three feet long, sounds rather more than it is, particularly on
occasions of heavy rain, snow, sand-storm or blasting
sunshine.</p>
<p>When a unit of the Legion bivouacs, its Commandant's first
thought is to choose a place close to water, so that if the force
is pinned to the spot, thirst, the greatest enemy of all, shall
not fight on the side of the foe.</p>
<p>Each quarter of the force forms one side of a square; mounts
all its tents in a line; and then, at the order, <i>aux
murailles,</i> builds a stone wall some eighteen inches high,
parallel to that line. Should that part of the country be devoid
of stones, suitable to dry-wall building, a trench is dug
instead, and the earth thrown up to form a parapet. By the time
each of the four divisions of the force has done this, the
bivouac is a square perimeter camp, surrounded by four defensible
walls or trenches.</p>
<p>This temporary fortress having been constructed, fatigue
parties are told off to fetch in a sufficient supply of fuel and
water.</p>
<p>When, as upon this occasion, neither is likely to be
procurable, each man carries his own supply of both, and unless
he wants to go hungry, supplies his personal quota to the
cook.</p>
<p>At sunset, the guard is mounted for each of the faces of the
camp, to the extent of four to a Company, and each sentry does
two hours on guard and four hours off.</p>
<p>In theory, these sentries patrol continually, in a smart and
soldier-like manner, and meet other sentries at each end of their
respective beats.</p>
<p>Digby Geste, being for guard that night, found himself posted
at a corner of the Square, and, had he been less utterly weary,
saddle-galled and knee-sore, after a long day's wrestling with a
most uncomfortable and refractory mount, he would have enjoyed
his two hours of peaceful solitude beneath the glorious moon and
incredibly great stars, as he gazed out over the silent and
illimitable space. . . .</p>
<p>All was very still and very silent. Not even the sound of
marching feet disturbed the perfect peace--for no feet marched.
Every sentry about the camp was apparently lost in admiration of
the wondrous desert night--or more probably in sleep.</p>
<p>Not so Digby Geste. He was on duty, and he had a habit of
doing his duty and a little more. He was there to watch, and he
was watching--so carefully and so conscientiously, in fact, that
he almost thought for a moment that a distant bush moved! Bushes
frequently do move, but not when there is no wind blowing, and
the air is still as death. Nor in the night-time, when no bird
alights nor flies away, causing a branch to quiver and sway.</p>
<p>But then again, moonlight is notoriously deceptive and
treacherous, making hovels look like palaces, witches look like
fairies and--stationary bushes to look like moving bushes.</p>
<p>But the thing <i>was</i> moving. . . . Surely . . .</p>
<p>Digby rubbed his eyes.</p>
<p>It must be a trick of moonlight. A bush might conceivably
shake when there was no wind blowing, and no big bird alighting
nor flying away; for some small nocturnal animal or snake might
possibly cause its branches to move. He stared so hard and so
long that his eyes watered, and he closed them for a moment. When
he opened them again he was instantly convinced that the bush was
moving, and moreover, that it was <i>moving along</i>!</p>
<p>Now, bushes that move in this manner are really interesting
phenomena, and Digby was duly interested. Placing the butt of his
rifle on a stone, he crossed his arms upon its muzzle, pushed
back his <i>képi,</i> yawned loudly, and leant his head upon his
arms. With one eye open the sentry slept at his post--or
apparently the bush thought he did, for it moved several yards
nearer--or perhaps the sentry, in turn, thought it did, because
he had only one eye open.</p>
<p>Again yawning, he drew his body erect, struck the attitude of
"Stand-at ease," and contemplated infinity. He also contemplated
the bush, and, before very long was absolutely certain that the
bush was approaching him. He was about to raise his rifle when he
was overwhelmed with the thought that, by firing a shot, he would
arouse the whole company, officers, non-commissioned officers and
men, all weary to death and almost preferring death to a needless
awakening.</p>
<p>If he roused them from their sleep without the best of good
reasons, he would become an object of universal execration, the
focus and target of their ferocious wrath, hatred and
contempt.</p>
<p>"<i>I</i> <i>thought I saw a bush move,</i>" would be a fine
excuse when brought before the Commandant to offer any
explanation he could find for rousing the camp and wasting
ammunition. They would say he had been asleep and had fired off
his rifle in a nightmare.</p>
<p>No, the bush was not moving. . . . Not moving now, perhaps,
but it certainly <i>had</i> moved, for it was undoubtedly nearer
than when he had first noticed it. . . . Or was it all
moonshine?</p>
<p>An idea! . . . There was an almost white stone shining in the
moonlight a few yards from the bush.</p>
<p>Digby Geste deliberately turned his back toward the bush,
slowly patrolled his allotted distance and returned. . . . The
bush had moved.</p>
<p>It was nearer to the stone by a distance about equal to the
length of his beat. While he had been patrolling from his post,
the bush had moved forward, and when he had turned about to come
back, the bush had halted.</p>
<p>How many other bushes were approaching the camp in similar
fashion? Or was this a solitary rifle-thief, intending to crawl
into the camp, silently slit the throat of a sleeping man, and
crawl away richer by a good Lebel rifle? More likely the idea,
since he was making a straight line for him, was to get
sufficiently close to a somnolent Digby Geste, to rush him and
stab him to the heart before he could make a sound.</p>
<p>Nasty man! . . . Whole company asleep. . . . Mustn't make a
mistake. . . . Plenty of time for one more patrol--to make sure.
. . .</p>
<p>No, a better notion. Digby Geste yawned, stretched himself,
sloped his rifle, turned his back upon the mystery bush and
marched off. But, at the end of half-a-dozen paces, he swiftly
wheeled about--and saw the bush progressing quite quickly in the
direction of his post. Raising his rifle Digby fired at the lower
part of the bush, and with all the strength of his lungs
called:</p>
<p>"<i>Aux armes! Aux armes!</i>"</p>
<p>Immediately each one of the chain of sentries fired his rifle
at nothing in particular to show that he too was a keen, wakeful
and watchful warrior, and bawled "<i>Aux armes!</i>" in evidence
that he had seen something suspicious, and probably saved the
life of every soul in camp.</p>
<p>In less time than it takes to tell the men were under arms and
lining the perimeter of the camp, each man at his own
<i>créneau</i> loop-hole.</p>
<p>From each of its four sides levelled rifles were ready to pour
forth a hail of death upon a charging enemy.</p>
<p>But no enemy charged.</p>
<p>Nothing happened.</p>
<p>In a very few minutes, lightly clad men were grumbling angrily
as they shivered in the bitter cold, and demanding the blood of
the nervous fool who had brought them from their warm blankets
and snug bivouacs.</p>
<p>Making his rounds, the Sergeant of the Guard found that no
sentry had fired first until he reached Digby Geste, who promptly
confessed to being the offender, or, if the Sergeant liked to put
it that way, the saviour of the situation.</p>
<p>"What did you fire at, you half-witted <i>salo?</i> You
trembling, squint-eyed, frog-faced Afraid-of-the-Dark?"</p>
<p>"At that bush," replied Digby, pointing.</p>
<p>"Oh you did, did you, <i>salo? . . .</i> Is <i>that</i> what
you are afraid of? Did you think it was going to bite you?"</p>
<p>"I didn't know <i>what</i> it might do--when it got here,
Sergeant," replied Digby, standing stiffly at attention.</p>
<p>"When it <i>got</i> here? What do you mean, you sodden
lunatic?" roared the Sergeant, and, before Digby could reply, an
incisive voice cut in sharply with:</p>
<p>"What's all this about?" and the Sergeant and his satellites
sprang to attention.</p>
<p>"This is the man who caused all the trouble, <i>mon
Commandant,</i>" answered the Sergeant, saluting. "He confesses
that he deliberately fired at a bush."</p>
<p>Major de Beaujolais turned to Digby Geste, little thinking
that this Soldier of the Legion was one of the three boys to whom
he had told stories of just such nights in the desert, years
before, at beautiful Brandon Abbas in England.</p>
<p>"And why did you fire at a bush, might one ask?" he inquired
coldly.</p>
<p>"Because it was moving toward me, Monsieur le Majeur," replied
Digby.</p>
<p>"Or because you dreamed that it was?" asked de Beaujolais
sternly.</p>
<p>"No, Monsieur le Majeur," replied Digby, firmly but
respectfully. "The bush moved toward me. I measured its progress
by that stone."</p>
<p>"Then go and fetch it," ordered de Beaujolais. "Quickly, <i>au
pas gymnastique.</i>"</p>
<p>With his rifle at the ready, and his heart beating rapidly,
Digby doubled out toward the bush. Arrived near it, he changed
his pace to a slow walk and covered the bush with his rifle.</p>
<p>He reached it.</p>
<p>Nothing happened.</p>
<p>But when, seizing a branch in his left hand, he pulled, the
bush yielded instantly, and with complete ease he dragged it to
where the little group awaited him.</p>
<p>"Show a light here," ordered Major de Beaujolais, and it was
immediately seen that the bush had been cut off at ground
level.</p>
<p>"You have done well, <i>mon enfant,</i>" he said kindly, and
turning to the Sergeant, added:</p>
<p>"A good thing if all your men were as ready to shoot at bushes
that move at night! This was a spy. Probably there's a Touareg
band somewhere near. Quite possibly we are surrounded, and shall
be attacked at dawn. Double your sentries, and see if any more of
them can spot moving bushes. Bring this man to me in the
morning."</p>
<p>And the Major strode away to give orders for the doubling of
sentries on the other sides of the camp, and for "Stand-to" an
hour before dawn.</p>
<p>But at dawn no attack materialized, and the company struck
camp and moved off as though surrounded by enemies from whom an
attack was imminent.</p>
<p>The retreat from the position was made a useful tactical
exercise, and proved to be particularly so when, from distant
rocks and sandhills, came a sudden outburst of irregular
firing.</p>
<p>Major de Beaujolais appeared quite pleased, and a look of
boredom promptly departed from his handsome face as he stood up
in his stirrups, and gazed coolly around in all directions and
indicated that the company would proceed at its best pace to a
not far distant <i>ravin</i> which appeared to offer excellent
shelter for mules, while an adjacent knoll provided an eligible
site for riflemen. From there he would give his force a lesson in
attack as infantry, and mobile rearguard tactics as rifle-armed
cavalry.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>In the rear of the company rode Digby Geste, his happiness
faintly clouded by anxiety as to the conduct or misconduct of
Mildred, his mule. It would be quite the wrong time for her to
have a fit of self-determination, to demonstrate, and to try to
make the Sahara a country fit for mules to live in. What would
she do if she were hit without being seriously wounded? Probably
bolt and take an undeserved place at the head of the column. Just
as likely to bolt in the opposite direction.</p>
<p><i>Crash! . . .</i> Hullo, someone was down. A few yards to
his right a <i>légionnaire</i> had fallen from his saddle. He had
clung to his rein, and the mule had come to a standstill beside
him. Digby pulled up, as he realized that the man's efforts to
get to his feet were in vain.</p>
<p>Riding across, while bullets knocked up puffs of dust and sand
around him, he saw that the man was Xarro, and that he was hit in
the right knee. He was obviously in the greatest agony, and quite
helpless. Springing to the ground, and putting his rein over his
shoulder, Digby lifted Xarro in his arms, sat him sideways on
Satan, who stood steady as a rock, and then lifted Xarro's left
foot and leg across the mule so that he was seated astride and
firmly in the saddle.</p>
<p>As Digby thrust Xarro's left foot into the stirrup the wounded
man, who appeared about to faint from pain, shock and loss of
blood, drooped forward on Satan's neck and groaned:</p>
<p>"<i>I</i> <i>can't! . . . I can't! . . .</i> Tie me on. . . .
For God's sake. . . ."</p>
<p>Easier said than done, with bullets smacking around, and the
enemy drawing nearer and nearer, as they dodged from rock to rock
and bush to bush.</p>
<p>"Cross your wrists under the mule's neck, quick," cried Digby,
and, snatching a weary-looking handkerchief from his pocket, he
swiftly and firmly bound Xarro's hands together. Then, slipping
the off stirrup-leather from its fastening beneath the
saddle-flap, he unbuckled the strap, thrust the end through the
girth, through the buckle, and pulled the thick strap tightly
across Xarro's left thigh.</p>
<p>He could not now possibly fall from the mule, even if he
fainted, and, provided Satan would canter after the Company,
there was no reason why Xarro should not get safely to
hospital.</p>
<p><i>Smack!</i> A bullet had struck Xarro, and another hit
Digby's water-bottle. Seizing Satan's rein, he swiftly scrambled
on to the back of Mildred, who, with all the incalculable
perversity of the mule had behaved like a perfect lady at a
moment when a little misconduct on her part would have been
literally fatal.</p>
<p>As he urged the two mules into a canter, he realized that some
of the nearest Arabs had ceased firing, and were actually rushing
forward to capture them and their mules alive. Live men can be
tortured, and live mules can be ridden or sold.</p>
<p>"First catch your hare," quoth Digby as Mildred and Satan
surpassed themselves. Never had he known mules to go so fast.
Pity there wasn't a mules' Derby. Was it because Xarro was
present?</p>
<p>Hullo! . . . What was this? . . . Two men galloping back from
the main body.</p>
<p>Hank and Buddy! . . . Silly asses; they couldn't do any good,
and were merely risking their lives for nothing.</p>
<p>The two reined up, dismounted, and, with reins looped over
arms, knelt and opened rapid fire on the running Arabs. These
having magically disappeared behind bushes, stones, mounds,
boulders or such sufficient cover (for an Arab) as a dead leaf,
Hank and Buddy again jumped on their mules and cantered after
Digby and Xarro.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, still holding Satan's rein, Digby
galloped into the mouth of the nullah, wadi or <i>ravin,</i> in
which the other mules stood in groups of four, the reins of each
group being held by the No. 3 man of the group. A few wounded men
sat or lay on the shady side of the nullah, in the charge of a
medical-orderly or dresser.</p>
<p>The remainder of the Company, strongly and invisibly posted,
was waiting to give the advancing Arabs a warm reception.</p>
<p>Leading Satan to where the wounded lay, Digby called out to
the <i>infirmier,</i> the medical subordinate:</p>
<p>"This man's wounded in the knee and chest," and then, reining
in, endeavoured to bring Satan to a standstill.</p>
<p>But Satan seemed agitated. Perhaps he missed his master's
voice. Perhaps he thought that in his master's best interests he
had better make straight for Tokotu, and his comfortable
mule-lines.</p>
<p>He declined to stop.</p>
<p>Xarro opened a sickly eye and groaned. He was not as good at
bearing pain as he had been at inflicting it.</p>
<p>"Whoa, whoa, Satan!" cried Digby, and, as he took his right
foot from the stirrup, to dismount from his own mule, he
remembered the word, or sound, that Xarro himself had told him to
use, when he wanted to steady Satan.</p>
<p>"Whoa, Satan! . . . <i>Brrrtsch! . . .</i>" cried Digby. . . .
"<i>Brrrtsch! . . .</i>"</p>
<p>Satan pricked his ears, and instantly flung himself down and
rolled--as he had been trained to do, at that word of
command.</p>
<p>With his last breath Xarro shrieked in agony, as the huge mule
rolled upon him thrice.</p>

<h1><a name="c209" id="c209"><i>Presentiments</i></a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 1</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When a dam bursts, a mighty flood follows; when a notably
silent man talks, he is apt to say a good deal.</p>
<p>Wine sometimes loosens the tongue, particularly if the drinker
be habitually abstemious. There are men who talk when they have
fever; others when the moon is full, and the desert and night sky
a vision of loveliness and a dream of peace; some when the nerves
are frayed, so that they must do something or go mad, and talking
is the easiest thing to do; others, again, when they are fey, and
are well aware that to-morrow's battle will be their last.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Le légionnaire</i> Max Linden, a forbidding person, so
taciturn, so inarticulate, as to be known as the Dumb Devil, was
talking to the Geste brothers--and to some purpose. It was the
eve of the battle of El Rasa, and Linden affected to be perfectly
certain that he would be killed on the morrow.</p>
<p>"Oh, rubbish, man," said Michael Geste; "not one in a hundred
of these presentiments is justified."</p>
<p>". . . Begun in blood . . . ended in blood," growled Linden,
raising himself on his elbow, and staring out into the moonlit
night. . . . "But that her blood oozed and spread and trickled in
the direction of the door, reached it, and slowly, slowly crept
underneath it and out on to the white doorstep, I should not be
here now . . . here now, awaiting my death from an Arab
bullet."</p>
<p>"Cheer up, old bird," said Digby. "Have a cigarette," he
added, offering a packet of <i>Caporal</i>. "I bet you I'll give
you another, this time to-morrow, and that you'll smoke it."</p>
<p>"You may stick it in my dead mouth if you like," replied
Linden, "before they shovel me under the sand.</p>
<p>"No," he continued, "if her blood had never reached the door,
I shouldn't be here now. . . . On the other hand, my father would
not have been executed, which would have been a pity. Executed
for the murder of my mother."</p>
<p>The brothers eyed each other uncomfortably. No wonder Max
Linden was a bitter and tragic-looking desperado, whose rare
speech was either a snarl or a growl.</p>
<p>"Your father murdered your mother before your eyes, and was
hanged?" murmured Michael Geste, as Linden turned to him and
apparently awaited a reply.</p>
<p>"He was hanged for it, anyhow," replied Linden, and he laughed
horribly as he added:</p>
<p>"Death on the scaffold was the terror of his life, too. Yes,
an absolute obsession, this fear of the rope. And the executioner
got him all right. . . . What about <i>that</i> for a
presentiment coming true? <i>And I could have saved him.</i>"</p>
<p>"What about a spot of sleep?" suggested Digby.</p>
<p>"It was all clear enough to the police, when they burst in,"
continued Linden, ignoring the hint. "It didn't need a Lecoq, nor
your Sherlock Holmes, to see what had happened. It leapt to the
eye.</p>
<p>"Picture it.</p>
<p>"Old Franz Muller, nosing about the dust-pails and gutters in
the early morning, sees a pool of blood on the doorstep of the
little house where lives the drunken <i>mauvais sujet,</i> Marc
Linden. He knocks at the door, tries the handle, peers through
the keyhole, kicks heavily, runs round to the window. No sound
nor sign from within; and, full of importance, off he goes to the
police.</p>
<p>"All in their own good time, they send a man along to see
whether there's a word of truth in old Franz Muller's story; or
whether there is a spot of red paint on our doorstep, and we
peacefully asleep in our beds.</p>
<p>"The man reports that blood has oozed under the front door,
spread across the step, trickled down the sides and soaked into
the dust.</p>
<p>"The police come, burst open the door and find--what?</p>
<p>"A woman lies at full length upon the floor, dead. So great a
quantity of blood has flowed from her head and neck that, if she
was not killed outright at the time, she has bled to death.</p>
<p>"Seated in a wooden arm-chair, and half sprawling across the
table, is a man. He is still in a drunken slumber, his head
pillowed upon his bent left arm, the hand of which clutches an
empty bottle. His right arm, outstretched before him, and resting
on the table, points in the direction of the body of the woman.
In the man's right hand is a pistol, its muzzle resting on the
table. One chamber has been discharged. In a corner of the room,
a boy--a stunted undersized boy--lies on the bare floor.</p>
<p>"They thought he was dead, too, until the Police Surgeon
discovered that he was only suffering from a severe blow on the
head, a dislocated leg and various minor injuries. He was very
emaciated, and had a number of old bruises, weals, abrasions and
contusions. It was noticed, too, that the eyes of the woman were
blackened and that her face showed evidence of brutal injury.</p>
<p>"'Aha!' said the police, 'a wife-beater; a scoundrelly brute
that assaults children in his drunken frenzy; and now he has gone
too far. He has deliberately murdered his wife, and perhaps has
fatally injured his son!'</p>
<p>"They reconstructed the crime.</p>
<p>"The man had come home drunk, as usual, bringing with him a
bottle of cheap and fiery spirit. He had savagely assaulted the
woman, beating her insensible, and had then struck and kicked the
boy, finally hurling him across the room, where he had lain
unconscious and half-dead</p>
<p>"The ruffian had then seated himself at the table to drink.
Unfortunately, before he had fallen into this drunken slumber the
unhappy woman had recovered consciousness and, clutching at the
table, had raised herself to her knees and reproached or defied
him, or perhaps had begged him to get help for the injured child.
His drunken fury blazing forth again, he had snatched the pistol
from his pocket and shot her dead. He had then emptied the bottle
at a draught, and fallen forthwith into the sottish, swinish
slumber in which they had found him.</p>
<p>"Thus the police. And thus was the accusation of wilful murder
framed against my father.</p>
<p>"Nor could a shadow of doubt remain in the mind of any
reasonable and unbiased person who heard the impassioned speech
of the prosecuting Counsel, the Advocate-General, who demanded a
life for a life, the heaviest of punishments for the foulest of
crimes.</p>
<p>"Certainly there was no doubt in the mind of the Judge. How
should there be? What would you three have concluded if you had
been the three policemen who burst into the room, and saw the
body of a slaughtered woman lying in a pool of blood that had
flowed from a wound caused by a bullet that had severed jugular
vein and carotid artery? What would you have concluded if, facing
the murdered woman, there sat a man, a noted brute and
wife-beater, whose hand clutched the pistol from which the bullet
had been fired?</p>
<p>"What, I ask you?" insisted Linden, seizing the wrist of
Michael Geste in his hot and shaking hand. "Tell me; what?"</p>
<p>"I should have said that things looked black against the man,"
replied Michael Geste, "very black."</p>
<p>"Would you have sent him to the scaffold if you had been his
Judge?" asked Linden.</p>
<p>"Don't know, I'm sure," was the reply. "Probably. . . .
Possibly not. Evidence all circumstantial. . . . We have a
different system, you know. If a jury brought him in guilty of
wilful murder . . .</p>
<p>"Yes, but it wasn't England, you see," interrupted Linden,
"and we don't assume that every villainous criminal is innocent.
We leave him to prove that he is--if he can.</p>
<p>"What would <i>you</i> have done if you had been the Judge?"
he added, turning to Digby Geste.</p>
<p>"What the Judge did do, I suppose," replied Digby.</p>
<p>"And you?" continued Linden, turning to John Geste.</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't know," replied John. "Benefit of the doubt, if
there were any doubt; and I suppose there always is a possibility
of doubt when there are no witnesses."</p>
<p>"There <i>was</i> a witness," said Linden. "Myself . . . I
witnessed the whole affair from beginning to end."</p>
<p>"And you could have saved your father," remarked Michael
softly. "What a terrible position for you! Poor chap. . . . You'd
have had to perjure yourself to have saved him, I suppose? What a
ghastly predicament! Did you give evidence against him, or did
you refuse to speak?"</p>
<p>"<i>Aha!</i>" replied Max Linden, and grinned
unpleasantly.</p>
<p>Silence fell on the little group, and three of the four
settled themselves for slumber. But Max Linden, sick-souled and
devil-driven, had more to say.</p>
<p>"It is pretty generally true," he went on, "that bullies are
cowards, and that those who are readiest in inflicting torture
are the worst and feeblest in bearing pain.</p>
<p>"When they reconstructed the crime, my father made me, if
possible, still more ashamed to be his son.</p>
<p>"As soon as I had recovered sufficiently, they took me back
again from the hospital to the house, and put me on a mattress in
the corner of the room, just as the police had found me. The body
of my poor mother was arranged exactly as it had lain when the
police entered the room. My father was seated in his chair, and
made to assume the position in which he had been found. The
pistol, clutched in his right hand, was laid on the exact
spot--marked by a pencil--where it had rested.</p>
<p>"A police agent then enacted my mother's supposed part in the
tragedy. First he lay upon the floor as though stunned by a blow.
He then seized the edge of the table opposite to my father,
dragged himself to his knees, and showed how a bullet, fired from
the pistol as it rested on the table, would penetrate the side of
his neck while he was in the act of rising from the floor.</p>
<p>"My father shuddered, shrieked, covered his eyes, and then
struggled to escape. Alternately he screamed his protestations of
innocence and grovelled for mercy. Weeping, he would point out
that he could not possibly have done such a thing and know
nothing about it; and he called God and all His saints to witness
that he did know nothing about it.</p>
<p>"Then, tearful and voluble, he would point out that he was
drunk when the police found him, and that if he <i>had</i> done
it, he had been too drunk to know what he was doing. Surely they
would not punish him for a thing done in ignorance and innocence?
His only fault was that he had got drunk.</p>
<p>"Then he would call upon the world to witness that no man, so
drunk as he had been, could possibly aim and fire a pistol. But
the <i>Juge d'Instruction</i> coldly asked him what evidence
there was that he had not deliberately murdered his wife and
thereafter drunk himself insensible?</p>
<p>"And that was where I came in.</p>
<p>"Sobbing, groaning, weeping, and sweating with fear for his
own miserable skin, this creature, this man, this Noblest Work of
God, suddenly caught a glimpse of salvation.</p>
<p>"A bright ray of hope shone into the black darkness of his
soul.</p>
<p>"'My son!' he cried, 'my son! He was in the room throughout
the night! He can tell you what happened, <i>Monsieur le
Juge.</i>'</p>
<p>"They took my evidence, and I gave it freely up to a certain
point. I said:</p>
<p>"'For as long as I can remember, my father has been a drunkard
and a brute, living God knows how, and by any means but honest
work. Times without number, I have seen him thrash my mother
unmercifully, with a stick, with the buckle-end of a heavy belt,
with a whip, and with his fist. Times without number, I have seen
him knock her senseless with a single blow, and then kick her as
she lay. More times than I can tell, he has flogged me, either
for no reason whatsoever, or because he had sent me out to steal
and I had brought back nothing. It has been his habit, when in
funds, to bring in good food--fish and meat and vegetables--and
to stand over my mother while she cooked it. He would then eat
the meal himself, while we had nothing but stale bread, and not
enough of that. Frequently the rich food and bottle of wine would
put him into such high good humour that he would observe that we
had no need to eat dry bread, for we could wet it; and that there
was no necessity for us to drink cold water, since there was no
reason why we should not warm it. . . .</p>
<p>"'On the night of my mother's death, he came home neither more
nor less drunk than usual, bringing with him a bottle of liquor,
but no food.</p>
<p>"'He demanded <i>soupe</i> and bread.</p>
<p>"'When my mother told him that there was no food of any sort
in the house, and that we had that day tasted nothing whatsoever
but a cup of re-boiled coffee-grounds, he knocked her down, and
then kicked her until she managed to pull herself together and
rise to her feet. He then announced that he would "feed me to
rights." Since I wanted food, he'd feed me with a stick.</p>
<p>"'As I tried to dodge past him and escape from the house, he
kicked me with all his strength, and then, picking me up from the
floor, flung me across the room, so that I struck the wall and
fell in a corner. He then got the stick, and, as my mother threw
herself between him and me, he struck her repeatedly with all his
strength, until she fell to the ground near the table. Having
kicked her several times, he seated himself at the table and
drank from the bottle.</p>
<p>"'I think I then became unconscious for a time. When I
recovered consciousness, my father was drinking from the bottle,
and my mother was making feeble efforts to lift her head from the
ground and raise herself upon her elbow.</p>
<p>"'What I saw after that I will never tell. Not though I am
<i>tortured</i> will I say one word; not though I spend the rest
of my life in prison will I add another syllable.'</p>
<p>"Naturally the police thought that I was reluctant to give
testimony which would instantly destroy any chance my father
would have of escaping the scaffold; and, while respecting the
filial feelings of an unhappy boy, most miserably situated, they
drew their own conclusions. Naturally, too, it was perfectly
clear to them that my mother could not have committed suicide,
inasmuch as the pistol was in my father's hand. Moreover, had it
been a case of suicide, I, of course should have testified to the
manner of her death, and removed all suspicion from my
father.</p>
<p>"Still protesting his innocence, weeping, shrieking and
struggling, my father was taken back to prison, charged with the
wilful murder of his wife."</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 2</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Linden bowed his head upon his hands and fell silent.</p>
<p>"Look here, you've talked enough for to-night, old chap," said
Michael. "Lie down, and try and get to sleep."</p>
<p>"Oh, let me talk, let me talk, now I have started," groaned
Linden. "Let me finish, anyhow. I shall be under the sand this
time to-morrow--shot, as my mother was shot, through the face and
neck. I want to tell the truth about my father. . . . Let me get
it off my chest. . . . I must tell somebody. . . . Let me go
on."</p>
<p>"Why, of course," agreed Michael, "talk as much as you
like."</p>
<p>"Yes, rather," added Digby; "if it will do you any good, we'll
listen all night. But you've really told us everything, you know.
. . . Poor old chap! . . . Rough luck. . . ."</p>
<p>"Awful hard lines," murmured John. "Some people <i>do</i> have
frightful tragedies in their lives. . . . But doesn't it make it
worse for you, to rake it all up again? . . . And as my brother
says, you've really told us all about it."</p>
<p>"Oh, have I?" replied Linden, again grinning unpleasantly.
"Listen.</p>
<p>"Between the Examining Magistrate's preliminary investigations
and the Court trial, I begged and prayed and implored that I
might be allowed to have an interview with my father in his
prison cell.</p>
<p>"And one day I found myself alone with the man who had made my
life, and that of my mother, a hell upon earth.</p>
<p>"In the most revolting manner, he fawned upon me, kissing me
repeatedly, and straining me to his breast.</p>
<p>"'My son! My son!' he snivelled, 'my saviour! You'll be famous
throughout Europe as the boy who saved his innocent father's
life. . . . How wonderful are the ways of God! Wonderful and yet
terrible--for I have always had this awful fear of the scaffold,
and now I have stood within its very shadow. The thought has been
my nightmare and presentiment from childhood, and here I sit
within a dozen yards of the dreadful thing itself. But my own
beloved son has come to save me! . . . My little Max has come to
tell me all that happened on that dreadful night when his poor
dear mother took her life.'</p>
<p>"And again he thrust his beastly and tear-bedewed face against
mine.</p>
<p>"'Yes, father,' I replied, 'that is just what I have come to
do. Listen:</p>
<p>"'You nearly committed two murders that night. It was not
<i>your</i> fault that you did not first kick your own beloved
little Max to death, and then his poor dear mother. As a matter
of fact, you beat them both insensible. The mother recovered
first, thought her child was dead--as he lay there, white and
still, where his loving father had flung him.'</p>
<p>"'And thinking so, she took her life. . . . She took her own
life. . . . <i>She committed suicide,</i>' gabbled my father.</p>
<p>"'Listen,' I repeated. 'The half-murdered woman, regaining
consciousness, despairing, dazed, beside herself with agony and
grief, stared at what she thought to be the body of her murdered
child, and then at the sodden brutal face of the bestial
ruffianly sot whom she supported by her unceasing labours, and
who repaid her love and generosity as a wild animal would not
have done. . . . It was a terrible look, and would to God that
the eyes of the swinish drunkard could have encountered it.'</p>
<p>"'But they could not! But they could not!' yelped my father.
'He was drunk, he was insensible; the poor fellow was helpless in
a state of stupor, dead to the world . . . innocent,
<i>unconscious.</i>'</p>
<p>"'Quite unconscious,' I agreed, 'drunk and incapable. Entirely
unable to see that terrible stare from the woman who had loved
him. Nor could he see her, after many failures and superhuman
effort, rise to her hands and knees and drag herself to her
feet.'</p>
<p>"'But <i>you</i> saw, <i>you</i> saw!' cried my father.</p>
<p>"'Oh yes, I saw everything,' I reassured him. 'I saw her drag
herself to the cupboard where you hide your pistol. I saw her
stagger from the cupboard with the pistol in her hand, and I saw
her crawl into a chair, fainting, and apparently about to
die.'</p>
<p>"'Yes, yes, yes,' urged my father, 'and then <i>she shot
herself,</i> eh? Thank God! Praise God that my own precious boy
saw it all, and can save his innocent father from this horrible
false charge!'</p>
<p>"'Listen,' I said a third time. 'How long my mother sat there,
I do not know, but, after a time, she got to her feet once more,
went and drank water, and then, with one hand holding the pistol
and the other supporting her against the wall, she stood and
peered at me.</p>
<p>"'<i>Dead!</i>' she whispered. '<i>My little Max, dead!</i>'
and turned again and looked at you, dear father. . . . I would
willingly have died if I could have made you meet that look. It
would have haunted you, sleeping and waking, to your grave.'</p>
<p>"'But you were <i>not</i> dead,' interrupted my father. 'Why
did you not speak to her? Why did you pretend?'</p>
<p>"'Because I thought she was going to shoot you, dear father,'
I replied. 'Going to shoot you, in the belief that you had killed
me. Not for worlds would I have let her see that I was alive. I
was dazed and half-delirious, but I had my wits sufficiently
about me to realize that mother was (thank God!) about to shoot
you, and that I could swear that I had seen you commit suicide!
So I lay still as the dead, in that dark corner, my eyes
half-closed, and looking like the corpse I almost was.</p>
<p>"'And <i>then?</i> And <i>then?</i>' begged my father.</p>
<p>"'And then my mother made her maimed and broken way across to
where you sat and snored, your head upon your left arm, your left
hand clutching the bottle, your right hand and arm extended
across the narrow table. . . . And, to my astonishment, what did
she do but carefully, painfully, gently, slowly, open your right
hand and clasp it about the handle of the revolver, your
forefinger through the trigger-guard, and resting on the
trigger.</p>
<p>"'And then my brain cleared somewhat, and my heart beat fast
with joy, for I realized that my brave and clever mother was
going to make <i>you</i> commit suicide! <i>You</i> were going to
be found with your pistol in your hand and such brains as you
have scattered about the room! . . . I almost moved and spoke. I
nearly cried "<i>Bravo,</i> mother!" and blessed her name.</p>
<p>"'And, wide-eyed, I watched as she went round to the opposite
side of the table and knelt facing you . . . watched to see her
take your right hand in hers and bend it round so that the pistol
touched your loathsome face . . . watched to see her press your
forefinger when the muzzle of the pistol was against your temple,
or your eye, or thrust into your open slavering mouth. . . .</p>
<p>"'She took your right hand in both of hers, and, to my puzzled
amazement, presented the pistol--the butt of which rested on the
table as you gripped it--<i>straight at her own neck.</i></p>
<p>"'Even as my amazement turned to horror and I screamed aloud
"<i>Don't mother! Don't!</i>" she must have pressed your
forefinger with her two thumbs.</p>
<p>"'There was a deafening report, and she fell back.</p>
<p>"'Even as she died, she seemed to be trying to get farther
from the table. . . .</p>
<p>"'And then, too late, I understood. Thinking me dead, she had
come to join me, leaving you, the murderer of her child, to
explain as best you could the corpses, the blood, the discharged
revolver clutched in your hand.'</p>
<p>"'<i>Devilish! Devilish!</i>' whispered my father. 'The vile
hag. . . . But God looks after the innocent; and my child was
there and saw it all--to testify truly that his dear father was
the victim of a horrible plot.'</p>
<p>"'Yes, dear father,' I replied. 'Your child was there, and saw
it all, and has truly testified.'"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"My father was now anxious to be rid of me, and could scarcely
contain himself until he could communicate with the lawyer
charged with his defence. From this gentleman I soon received a
visit in hospital.</p>
<p>"'Well, well,' quoth he, standing beside my bed and rubbing
his hands. 'What is this, what is this, my silent young
gentleman? You've found your tongue with a vengeance! . . . Now
tell me again very carefully all that you told your father,' he
continued as he opened his bag, took out a large notebook, and
seated himself on my bed.</p>
<p>"'Now, my little man,' he smiled, smug and self-satisfied,
'let us have it.'</p>
<p>"I gazed with blank incomprehension upon the smug face of the
lawyer. <i>Found</i> my tongue with a vengeance had I? On the
contrary, I had lost it with a very real vengeance.</p>
<p>"'Sir?' I stammered.</p>
<p>"'Come on,' he encouraged, 'and be very careful and exact,
especially about your mother putting the pistol in your father's
hand and pressing the trigger.'</p>
<p>"'About my mother doing <i>what,</i> sir?' I faltered.</p>
<p>"'You heard what I said,' he snapped.</p>
<p>"'Yes, sir,' I agreed. 'I heard what you said, but I don't
know what you are talking about.'</p>
<p>"'Your father has just told me,' was the reply, slow and
patient, clear and impressive, 'that you have admitted to him
that you witnessed the whole affair, and did not, as you
previously stated, lie unconscious until you awoke to find your
mother dead. He says you told him how you saw your mother put the
pistol in his hand, and then deliberately shoot herself.'</p>
<p>"I smiled with pale amusement.</p>
<p>"'My father seems to have been dreaming, sir,' I said.</p>
<p>"The lawyer stared at me in amazement.</p>
<p>"'<i>Dreaming? . . .</i> <i>Dreaming?</i> . . .' he said, at
length. 'What do you mean? Are you implying that the whole story
is a tissue of lies?'</p>
<p>"'<i>I</i> called it a dream, sir,' I answered meekly.</p>
<p>"The lawyer stared the harder.</p>
<p>"'A wonderfully coherent and circumstantial <i>dream,</i>' he
said. . . . 'Astonishing amount of detail . . . don't you think
so?'</p>
<p>"'My father didn't tell it to me, sir,' I said simply.</p>
<p>"'Well, I'll tell it you now, my young friend.' . . . And he
proceeded to give a very full and accurate repetition of what I
had told my father.</p>
<p>"'A really marvellous dream, sir,' I remarked, when he had
finished.</p>
<p>"'And haven't you dreamed the same dream yourself?' he
asked.</p>
<p>"'I <i>never</i> dream, sir,' I replied.</p>
<p>"'Couldn't you dream that dream to-night?' he suggested, with
a subtle smile and a would-be hypnotic gaze.</p>
<p>"'I <i>never</i> dream, sir,' I repeated, and matched his
subtle smile."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The three brothers stared incredulous at <i>le légionnaire</i>
Max Linden, their young faces expressing a variety of
emotions--wonderment, contempt, pity.</p>
<p>"But did they confront you with your father?"</p>
<p>"Oh yes," replied Linden, "and he, having faithfully repeated
the story I had told him, flung himself at my feet, and implored
me to corroborate it; begged me to speak the truth; besought me
to save him; shrieked to me that he was innocent, <i>and I alone
could prove it.</i>"</p>
<p>"And what did you do?" asked Michael Geste, as Linden fell
silent.</p>
<p>"I saw the wraith of my mother standing behind him, and
turning to the Advocate-General, who was present, I tapped my
forehead and smiled."</p>
<p>"'Dreaming again, eh?'" growled the great man.</p>
<p>"'Yes, sir,' I agreed, 'he is still dreaming.'</p>
<p>"And so my father's presentiment came true."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Excuse me," asked Michael Geste, as <i>le légionnaire</i> Max
Linden lay back and prepared to sleep, "but was the tale you told
your father <i>true,</i> or did you actually invent it with the
object of torturing him?"</p>
<p>"<i>Aha,</i>" grinned <i>le légionnaire</i> Linden, and
composed himself to slumber.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On the following day his own presentiment came true, and he
died on the battlefield of El Rasa. A bullet struck him in the
neck, and, as no one had any time to attend to him, he bled to
death.</p>

<p>"Have you come across an extraordinary bird whom they call The
Apostle?" asked Digby suddenly, as the three brothers sat in the
<i>Jardin Publique,</i> and rested their weary bones, after a
week of murderous man&oelig;uvres, marching, counter, marching,
skirmishing, attacking and trench-digging, during each day of
which they had been burnt almost unbearably by the sun, and,
during each night, soaked and chilled by a cold relentless
rain.</p>
<p>"What's he like?" asked Michael.</p>
<p>"An Apostle," replied Digby.</p>
<p>"What's an Apostle like?" inquired John.</p>
<p>"Don't pretend an ignorance and innocence beyond your years,"
requested Digby. "It is perfectly well known to any student of
German oleographs that an Apostle has a mild and beautiful face,
enriched by limpid and liquid eyes like those of a camel; a
longish, curly but well-trimmed, golden beard; long hair, curling
in ringlets about his shoulders; and an expression of relentless
benignity."</p>
<p>"And a halo," added Michael.</p>
<p>"Well, this chap has to make a <i>képi</i> do for a halo,"
said Digby, "but I really think that, back in the old Home Town,
he must have been a professional sitter."</p>
<p>"What d'you mean--a sitter?" inquired John.</p>
<p>"It's the opposite of professional stander," replied Digby. "A
person who makes a business of standing drinks. . . . There is no
such person; but a professional sitter is a person who makes a
practice of sitting for a photograph. Surely you've seen the
Beach Bathing Girl, laughing like two tickled hyenas, waving a
hand in the air; the Brother-in-Law of the Murdered Man, marked
with a cross, who had nothing to do with it; the Mother of
Nineteen, who might have reared twenty only he swallowed a very
bad penny; the Channel Aspirant, who had to give up toward the
evening of the third day, owing to currents in the bun they gave
her; the Very-Respectable Man in Shirt Sleeves who won the
Football Forcast Competition at the 297th attempt, and is going
to buy his wife (inset) a mangle, because they've never had a
cross word competition in their lives . . ."</p>
<p>"Shut up," growled Michael.</p>
<p>"Certainly, sir," agreed Digby. "And the Apostle must have
made his living sitting for the pictures that adorn the books on
which Good Children are brought up."</p>
<p>"Nearly finished?" inquired Michael, "because if so, I believe
I know the chap you mean, only he was pointed out to me as the
Dreamer. He's a friend of Cordier, who, as a doctor and a
psychologist, is deeply interested in him."</p>
<p>"Oh yes," said John. "I know the Dreamer. Most extraordinary
creature. Preaches, dreams and sees visions."</p>
<p>"Yes, by Jove, I remember now. Some one called him <i>Le
Reveur</i>."</p>
<p>"Well, what do you think of him?"</p>
<p>"I <i>don't</i> think of him," said Michael. "I prefer not to.
He gives me the creeps."</p>
<p>"That's interesting," put in John</p>
<p>"Why?" inquired his brothers.</p>
<p>"Well, I was on a fatigue with him, and after some hours, and
quite a long talk, I really didn't know whether I liked or
loathed him; nor whether he was quite charming or--not quite
charming; almost sinister in fact."</p>
<p>"That's the word," observed Digby. "Sinister. . . . You feel
he's a most interesting and delightful chap, and then suddenly
you come up against something which is, as you say, almost
sinister."</p>
<p>"Unwholesome, what?" suggested Michael. "Bizarre, abnormal,
got a mad streak in him."</p>
<p>"Streak is a good word, too," agreed Digby. "You may
conceivably have encountered the expression Streaky Bacon. He's
like that. A nice expanse of fat white piety and virtue, and then
a hard red streak of something lurid."</p>
<p>"A wretched and vulgar simile," commented Michael. "But I know
what you mean. He's certainly of less homogeneous structure, more
conglomerate, of more diverse elements compact. . . ."</p>
<p>"Yes, Papa," agreed Digby hastily. "In short, a weird bloke.
Let's cultivate him for our collection."</p>
<p>"Or collect him for our cultivation," added John, as they
arose to return to Barracks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 2</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Le légionnaire</i> Maximilien Gontran, as he called
himself, seated at a table in the Canteen, held a circle of his
admirers spell-bound by his eloquence--a thing he loved to do,
and which he could do at will. He was describing one of those
astoundingly vivid and circumstantial dreams that had won him the
sobriquet of "The Dreamer," while his unusual appearance, manner
and conduct had won him that of "The Apostle."</p>
<p>As the three brothers approached, warmly welcomed by their
friends Maris, Cordier and St. André, Gontran paused to bow
courteously and suggest refreshment. He then resumed his
well-told and realistic account of his latest dream.</p>
<p>"No, I couldn't tell you what place it was," he said, "save
that I got the impression of a kind of Cathedral Chapter-House,
or some such place; nor could I say for certain whether it was
part of a Catholic or a Protestant foundation. It might have been
the Vatican, Canterbury Cathedral, Notre-Dame, St. Paul's or St.
Mark's. It may have been in Seville, St. Petersburg, New York,
Athens or Bruges, but it was a magnificently ornate interior of
lace-like ancient stone carving, lace-like old wooden carving,
jewel-like mediæval stained-glass, all mellowed and harmonized
with the patina of Time.</p>
<p>"In this great room with its marble pavement, from which grew
great pillars branching and exfoliating in the dim recesses of
the groined and lofty roof, was a great old table from the
refectory of some monastery. It was surrounded by great old
carven chairs, each worthy to be a Bishop's throne. And in these
chairs, about this table, sat a great company of Princes of the
Church, over whom presided the most wonderful and venerable
figure of that most wonderful and venerable Ecclesiastical Court.
A Prince Bishop, Cardinal, Archbishop or Pope. I can see his face
now, old ivory, aquiline, austere, beautiful, beneath the silver
hair and golden mitre.</p>
<p>"His vestments, stiff with brocade, precious metals and more
precious stones, were the most wonderful that I have ever seen;
even more costly, ornate and marvellous than those of the
constellation of lesser lights that shone around him.</p>
<p>"I can see the faces of those others, too. One was that of a
strong--perhaps headstrong and violent--man; a face that could
flush to dull purple with anger; a face of heavy brows, heavy jaw
and heavy looks. When opposed by one of his colleagues, he bared
strong even teeth and covered them again reluctantly.</p>
<p>"Next him, in purple and gold and finest lawn, with a great
jewel upon his white fore-finger, sat a gentle, quiet creature
who, in silken tones, angered and goaded the strong and violent
man, with honeyed words and mocking smiles. A subtle wily man, a
very fox of Æsop.</p>
<p>"And on the other side, a pompous dullard, diseased with
egoism and conceit, a man who thought, if he did not actually
say, 'God and I in our wisdom have decided and ordained . .
.'</p>
<p>"And others there were of the great and good--and successful.
And they talked about it and about, while the High Priest in the
high chair slowly nodded his august head in agreement, or pursed
his thin lips in even more august disapproval.</p>
<p>"What they discussed with such intensity of feeling, such
veiled acrimony and bitterness, I do not know; but I rather fancy
that some liturgical practice was in process of revision; the
proposal of some modification of ritual was being defended and
attacked; some alteration in the long-established forms of
ancient prayers. I know not what--but it was abundantly clear
that while some evidently thought the proposals would afford the
Almighty considerable satisfaction, others were of an adamantine
certainty that Almighty God would be frightfully put out about
it. One man--if one may use the mere word 'man' without
irreverence--arrayed in clothing more beautiful and costly than
that of a great Queen at a State Ball, spoke most eloquently of
Progress, of the necessity of the Church's parallel growth and
development with that of the development of the mentality and
education of the nation. A good and learned man, he said that
when the nation was a child, it thought and prayed as a child,
but that now it was attaining to lusty youth and incipient
manhood, it would no longer think and pray as a child, and the
Church must realize the fact.</p>
<p>"As he resumed his seat, after a most moving peroration, the
beautiful and saintly figure at the head of the table slowly
nodded its noble and most venerable head. And even as it did so,
another Prelate sprang to his feet, and with clenched fist and
blazing eye called down the curse of God, the rebuke of the High
Priest, and in culmination, the disapproval of the Prime
Minister, on the impious head of him who would dare to lay
defiling, desecrating and sacrilegious hands upon the most
treasured, the most beloved, the most sacred heritage and
possession of the People. If such a dreadful thing were done,
they would not believe their very eyes when they opened that book
which so rarely left their hands. They would not believe their
ears when they detected a change in the service of those churches
which they daily thronged. And when the awful truth at last
dawned clearly on their shocked and shattered souls, they would
swarm forth into the streets and market-places in their millions,
and with tongues of men and angels, they would--er--do all sorts
of things.</p>
<p>"And as this impassioned Defender of the Faith sank back
exhausted upon the velvet cushions of his Throne, and wiped the
foam from his lips with an embroidered handkerchief of finest
lawn, a little wicket opened in the vast oaken double doors of
this great Chapter-House. The little wicket, not five feet high,
not three feet wide, opened, and through it stooped the figure of
a man--a common coatless working man, wearing overalls and an
apron, and carrying, slung over his shoulder, one of those flat
straw baskets in which carpenters carry their tools. From its
ends protruded saws, hammers, and the handles of other such
implements used by those who work in wood.</p>
<p>"Humbly, quietly, treading as softly and silently as the
contact of his hobnailed boots with that wonderful marble
pavement permitted, the workman, with averted eyes and meekest
mien, made his unobtrusive way toward a piece of unfinished work
in the far distant corner of the Hall. There, in silence,
absorption, and obscurity, he went about his business of
measurement and then of boring into some rotten wood. In fact, he
had settled to his work of restoration before the Lords Spiritual
had properly recovered from the shock of his intrusion.</p>
<p>The High Priest at the head of the table, as became a Leader,
was the first to give voice to the indignant astonishment of the
august assembly. But it was the headstrong and violent Prelate
who first took action. Even as the High Priest cried with a stern
note in his beautiful silvern voice:</p>
<p>"'Go hence! Depart! . . . You intrude. . . . This is not the
time for you to enter here,' . . . the strong-faced Prelate,
rising from his throne, strode across to where the carpenter
worked engrossed, his back turned upon that judicial Court of
Princes of the Church.</p>
<p>"Seizing the intrusive workman by the arm, he swung him about,
and with an angry glare and display of strong white teeth,
shouted,</p>
<p>"'Here, what's the meaning of this? Who are you, that you
should come into the presence of the Lords Spiritual themselves,
even while they deliberate on high matters of the
Church--actually while they debate changes in the Form of Worship
of Almighty God! . . . Who are you, sir?'</p>
<p>"A sweet and gentle smile wreathed the lips of the
carpenter.</p>
<p>"'I am Jesus Christ,' he said softly. . . ."</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Le légionnaire</i> Maximilien Gontran, known as the
Apostle, and also as the Dreamer, laughed, and then emptied his
glass, while the Geste boys eyed him critically.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 3</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The patrol under Corporal Heintz, twenty-four hours out from
Douargala, sprawled wearily about that great man's feet, as they
rested in the providential shadow of a great rock in that thirsty
land.</p>
<p>There were present, the Geste brothers and most of their
<i>escouade,</i> Maris, Cordier, St. André, Hank, Buddy, Boldini,
Brandt, Haff, Delarey and a few others, including La Cigale, old
Tant de Soif and Gontran--who distinguished himself next day and
was soon afterwards promoted Corporal.</p>
<p>To become the equal and even the superior of Corporal Heintz
was the dream of Gontran's life, for he hated Heintz with an
unspeakable, unappeasable, almost unbearable hatred. If there
were, in the whole world, another hatred that equalled it, it was
the hatred of Corporal Heintz for Gontran.</p>
<p>"Well, Apostle," growled Heintz with a bitter vicious sneer,
as he looked down, from where he was seated on a big stone, at
the prostrate form of Gontran. "Had any more dreams lately?"</p>
<p>"Not lately, Corporal Heintz," replied <i>le légionnaire</i>
Maximilien Gontran, softly, as he turned his large mild eyes
toward the hard, handsome face of his enemy.</p>
<p>"Not lately, eh?" mocked the other. "Then I must see if I
can't give you something to dream about. I wonder if you'd dream
better in the cells or <i>en crapaudine. . . .</i> Tell us one
that you <i>haven't</i> dreamed lately. . . ."</p>
<p>"I'll tell you one I once dreamed about a bully," replied
Gontran, sitting up suddenly, and looking Heintz squarely in the
face. "Two, in fact, if you'd care to hear them. I do not know
whether you ever went to school, Corporal Heintz. . . . Yes? . .
. Indeed! . . . So did I, and they sent me when I was very
young--far too young, in fact. I first went to school on my third
birthday, and I went in fear and trembling unbelievable, for the
Schoolmaster was a known bully and brute, who ruled his unhappy
charges with a rod of iron, or rather with a rod of pliant cane,
that left blue weals and bruises on their tender bodies. He did
not spare the rod, but he spoiled the child, by making him a
trembling little coward, an arrant little liar. What child, who
thinks he can escape torture by means of deception, will not
deceive? This brutal bully, this cruel sadistic savage, enjoyed
beating children and thrashed them, not 'for their own good,' but
for his own enjoyment, and made them furtive, treacherous,
cowardly and untruthful. He also made their days a misery, their
nights a terror, and their lives a burden. I can see him now,
with his flaming red beard, red hair, red nose and cold greenish
eye, a great powerful, vindictive ruffian of whom our parents
were as much afraid as we were.</p>
<p>"It was no Academy for the Sons of Gentlemen, our school, but
a log hut in a forest, a mile or so from our village, and there
can be but few buildings in this world from which more screams of
agony had rung out. One reads of tortures, tortures of the
Chinese and of the Holy Inquisition; one has seen photographs of
the bodies of our poor fellows tortured and mutilated by the
Arabs; but, you know, I doubt if any tortured person suffers more
from steel, or cord, or red-hot iron, than does a tender child
from the stinging, biting cuts of a swishy cane applied by a
master hand.</p>
<p>"To me, at any rate, it was a refinement of agony ineffable,
and I suffered it daily for years, dreamed of it nightly for
centuries, and tried to find the courage to commit suicide. But
<i>tout lasse, tout casse, tout passe,</i> and at length I was
free, and went out into the great world where I grew big and
strong.</p>
<p>"Oh yes, I'm very strong, Corporal Heintz, and most patiently
I developed and trained my strength, as the earnest pupil of a
great and famous professional Strong Man.</p>
<p>"And then came this dream of which I started to tell you.</p>
<p>"I dreamed that one fine morning I revisited the village of my
birth, spent a delightful hour with my dear old parents, and then
took a stroll through the forest to the scene of my happy
school-days--those days which we are told are the very happiest
of our lives. Nothing had changed in the five or six years of my
absence; not even the sound of agonized shrieks as I drew near
the building; not even the sound of the cutting blows upon bare
flesh as I drew near the open windows of the school-house; not
even the savage grin of enjoyment upon the vile face of my
erstwhile preceptor. . . .</p>
<p>"With my blood boiling, my nerves tingling and my fists
clenching and unclenching, I flung open the door, and strode into
the room, smelt the old familiar smell, saw the rows of strained
white faces, heard the stifled sobbing of a cruelly-beaten
child.</p>
<p>"'You dog,' I said quietly. 'You brutal, savage, snarling
cur.'</p>
<p>"And as he whirled upon me, I struck with all my strength, and
he went down, down across the whipping-bench, over which he had
held me a thousand times. And I saw fear in that brute's eyes as
he rose to his feet, and again I smashed my fist between them,
with all my strength.</p>
<p>"When he could stagger to his feet no more, I flung him across
that whipping-bench on which my young life and soul and nature
had been warped, and taking his own cane, I flogged him until I
was too weary to raise my hand again.</p>
<p>"And as I resumed my coat, I told him that I would keep in
closest touch with certain of his pupils, and that if ever I
heard of his striking one of his pupils a single blow, I would
visit him again and give him a punishment compared with which
this would be as nothing.</p>
<p>"Wasn't that a fine dream, Corporal Heintz? Oh! <i>I am a good
hater and I always repay! I always repay!</i>"</p>
<p>"I suppose it was a true dream," observed Michael Geste.</p>
<p>"Yes," replied Gontran. "A day dream--and quite true."</p>
<p>"You spoke of two," observed La Cigale, who had shuddered and
covered his face with his hands during Gontran's description of
the sufferings of the children. "What was the other, might one
ask? Did you dream that some scoundrelly ruffian was punished in
that one also?"</p>
<p>"Ah, a curious dream," murmured Gontran, eyeing Corporal
Heintz. "Very curious. . . . '<i>Wage du zu irren und zu
traümen</i>,' as Schiller says. . . . 'Dare to err and to dream.'
. . . Yes, there was a scoundrel in this one also, and I think
one may say he was punished. . . . A woman too. . . ."</p>
<p>"Do you never have beautiful dreams of drink?" inquired Tant
de Soif. "I once dreamed that I was swimming in a river of wine.
Lovely. . . . Wonderful. Every night I go to sleep hoping that I
may dream it again."</p>
<p>"I suppose you drank while you swam?" inquired Boldini.</p>
<p>"No, I swam while I drank," replied Tant de Soif, "and I drank
so much and so fast that I choked and woke up, to find that it
had come on to rain, and that a stream of dirty water was pouring
from a roof-gutter into my open mouth. Fancy dreaming of wine,
and waking to water."</p>
<p>"That is life in epitome, my friend," observed La Cigale, "to
find your wine is water. Tell us your other dream," he added,
turning to Gontran.</p>
<p>"Oh, it was nothing . . . nothing much. There are really only
a few varieties of dream. They all belong to one or other of
about half a dozen kinds. This was quite a stock one--the old
triangular dream, you know; two men and a woman. She was a
remarkable girl. Of course, all women are remarkable, I know. But
she was doubly so, for the simple reason that she was two
women."</p>
<p>"So you had two wives, bigamist?" growled the Corporal.</p>
<p>"I did not say that she was my wife--and after all, I'm only
telling a <i>dream,</i> am I not, Corporal Heintz?</p>
<p>"Yes, she was a gentle, timid, soft little thing, meek and
nervous and humble, full of gratitude for your smile, fearful and
anxious and cringing at your scowl."</p>
<p>"Proper sort for a wife," smiled Boldini, and licked his
lips.</p>
<p>"And yet there was a core of granite at the heart of this soft
clay; there was steel somewhere beneath the silk."</p>
<p>"Perhaps she had a heart of gold," sneered Boldini. "Gold's
hard enough, and hard to come by."</p>
<p>"Excellent," smiled Gontran. "What a very clever man you are!
It must have been her heart of gold that one occasionally came
upon beneath that tender softness. Quite so; for she was good.
Oh, unutterably good and sweet--the sweetest nature, the sweetest
disposition, the sweetest temper--oh, incurably sweet. How would
you like to eat honey all day long? And think of the flies such
honey attracts. There was one fly in particular. . . . To pursue
the simile a little further, he got honey on his wings and
couldn't fly away. . . . Sticky stuff, honey. . . . And he got it
in his heart, and certainly in his voice. Oh, honeyed words, I
assure you. The husband listened secretly.</p>
<p>"He was a gentle soul, this Lover . . . made for love. . . .
Undoubtedly in a previous incarnation he had been a Provencal
<i>jongleur,</i> a wandering minstrel of love, going from castle
to castle, and from Court to Court; singing of love; making love;
a very warrior in the lists of love; right welcome at King René's
Court of Love; slender, willowy, white-handed, large-eyed,
long-haired, golden-bearded--oh, a great lover.</p>
<p>"And she, pleased and smiling, always pleased and smiling, but
discreet. . . . Oh, yes, always discreet. . . . And virtuous. . .
. Or so the Husband hoped. And believed--sometimes. And sometimes
he did not. When he was with them he believed, as he gazed upon
that lovely Madonna face, and looked into the soulful, gentle
eyes of his sweet-mouthed friend; but when his affairs took him
away, as periodically they did, and he must leave his Mountain
Forest châlet for days at a time, he did <i>not</i> believe; and
a dark cloud of jealousy gradually overspread the heaven of his
soul.</p>
<p>"Jealousy, to change the metaphor, that purest poison, that
deadliest and most damnable distillation of the Devil. . . . And
the poison spread and spread until his mind was rotted and
corrupted, his conscience paralysed, his better nature dead.</p>
<p>"And as poisoned love was metamorphosed into hideous hate, he
watched and schemed and plotted and laid traps. And worse--he
made opportunities for them. He would say to his friend:</p>
<p>"'This time to-morrow night I shall be on the Rhine again,
gazing on moonlit schloss and vineyard, and thinking of my girl,
lonely at home here. Pass the cottage on your night round,
comrade, and try the door and window. She is young and careless,
and thinks no evil. She does not believe the world holds thieves
and robbers and evil men.'</p>
<p>"And the young forester would eagerly agree. What had he to
guard one-millionth part as precious as little love-faced
Heart-of-Gold?</p>
<p>"And the Husband would take an impassioned farewell of his
Dutiful Beautiful, and bid her not to mope in loneliness during
his week of absence. Why should she not go and visit Frau
Englehardt, and take some dainty for her invalid and aged
husband? Young Fritz would see her safely home if she lingered
after nightfall.</p>
<p>"And departing, he would swiftly return--and watch.</p>
<p>"And one night he was rewarded--or punished, for he saw her
sauntering beneath the trees with her Lover, strolling
hand-in-hand in the moonlight, and lingering in the black patches
of darkest shadow.</p>
<p>"At the door of the cottage they stood and spoke awhile, and
then she drew him in and closed the door. Would a light appear,
and if so in which room? With teeth embedded in the knuckle which
he gnawed, the Husband waited . . . waited . . . waited. And a
light appeared. They had lit the lamp in the sitting-room
downstairs.</p>
<p>"Cautiously he crept to the window. Blind and curtain were
drawn and he could see nothing. Later, the Lover emerged and
strode off into the forest, whistling, his gun upon his shoulder.
Scarcely could the Husband refrain from rushing to the house,
taking down his own gun from where it hung upon the wall, and
stealing off to waylay him on his round. But that would be
crude--and dangerous; and it was just possible that he was wrong,
his suspicions unfounded. He would make absolutely sure--and then
his vengeance should be dreadful.</p>
<p>"But it would be a poor game to alienate his wife, lose his
friend, and put a noose about his own neck, for nothing at
all--put himself within the shadow of the prison--of the
gallows--because of a suspicion that might be as baseless as the
airy fabric of a dream.</p>
<p>"<i>Prison! Gallows!</i> Unpleasant words, and conjuring up
unpleasant thoughts in the mind of one who already had a guilty
secret--one who already knew what it was to feel uncomfortable at
the approach of a <i>gendarme,</i> to feel a certain apprehension
whenever there came a sudden and heavy knock upon the door. Such
a sinister and sullen sound, ominous and foreboding.</p>
<p>"So he waited . . . waited . . . waited through that night,
seated with his back against a tree, his eyes upon his moonlit
silent house, wherein the light had disappeared from the
sitting-room, appeared in the bedroom, and suddenly gone out. And
later, the Lover returned from his round, whistling merrily until
he was near the house, when he fell silent and walked delicately,
making no noise with his iron-shod boots.</p>
<p>"The Husband rose to his feet and stiffened like a hunting-dog
that sees its prey. The forester entered by the little garden
gate, and crept silently to the door. The Husband, in the shadow
of his tree, took a step forward, and the faint sound of the
intake of his breath was audible.</p>
<p>"The door did not open. Nor did the window. No light appeared
within the house, and the Lover strolled silently away.</p>
<p>"At a short distance from the house, he turned, bared his
head, extended both arms in the direction of the upstairs window,
and stood as though in adjuration and in prayer. Then, wafting a
kiss in the direction in which he gazed, he suddenly turned and
strode swiftly away.</p>
<p>"Nothing much in all that, you will say. And so the Husband
said--for a time. But, being of a jealous nature, he could
neither let well alone nor ill, if ill it were--until, one night,
returning two days before he was expected, he found his house
silent, empty and deserted.</p>
<p>"Stunned and incredulous, he seized his gun, and strode out of
that unbearable and mocking house, and, with murder in his heart,
rushed through the forest, bareheaded and distraught. He realized
that his feet were carrying him in the direction of the cottage
where dwelt the <i>garde-champêtre,</i> and his aged parents.</p>
<p>"Why? She would not be there. They would have fled.</p>
<p>"But she <i>was</i> there, serene and calm, sitting with her
lover in the porch, while, in the room above, the old mother
ministered to her sick husband, the invalid for whom the girl had
brought some delicacy. Coolly she greeted her husband, and told
him that he was just in time to take her home, instead of Fritz,
who had kindly offered to do so.</p>
<p>"'But why the gun?' jeered the Lover. 'Going rabbit-shooting
in the dark?'</p>
<p>"'Yes, I'm going to shoot a rabbit,' replied the Husband, in a
deadly quiet voice, 'and quite probably in the dark.'</p>
<p>"Thereafter his mind dwelt much on shooting, but he feared the
law. He feared what his wife might suspect, and say, and do, if
suddenly her lover disappeared. For he knew in his heart, though
never a word had been spoken, that his wife was but too well
aware of his jealousy and his hatred; and he suspected that the
forester knew of it, too.</p>
<p>"With amusement? With contempt? Would they laugh at him
together behind his back, adding vilest insult to foulest injury?
The thought was unbearable, and his soured suspicious mind was
all but unhinged.</p>
<p>"One day, the dark recesses of his mind were brilliantly
illuminated by a lurid idea, and he could scarcely await the hour
for translating thought into action--the action that would give
completest proof and every excuse and right for committing a
<i>crime passionel.</i> The law would pardon the deed, and public
opinion condone it. Proof, confession, punishment. Punishment for
them both. The utmost penalty of the law--the unwritten law.</p>
<p>"Having made his usual preparations for a journey, and
requested his wife to put a change of clothing and a parcel of
food in his rucksack, he announced his departure for Cologne, and
his intention of returning on the fifth day at earliest.</p>
<p>"'There is no time earlier than the earliest, is there?'
observed his wife, with her enigmatic smile; and bade him a
sufficiently fond farewell.</p>
<p>"He returned the next night, and once again watched and waited
for the passing of Fritz, the <i>garde-champêtre.</i> This time
he waylaid and accosted him, a quarter of a mile from the house;
and, as though even more in sorrow than in anger, in wounded
misery than in savage and vengeful wrath--accused him of being
the Lover of his wife.</p>
<p>"It was the young forester who was angry, and angry that the
woman should be accused, that a single word should be uttered
against her, a single breath of suspicion tarnish her good name.
Of himself he said nothing--this sole reply was to condemn the
unbelievable baseness and villainy of the mind that could think
such thoughts, the man who could speak such words of his innocent
wife--and such a wife.</p>
<p>"Oh, it was well acted, clever and very plausible, and when
the Husband bade him cease to speak of the woman, and to answer
the charge brought against himself, he replied:</p>
<p>"'Why waste my time and trouble, madman? But take note that I
am merely <i>suspected</i> of a vile thing, and that by only one
man--if you are a man. Whereas you have done--actually
<i>done</i>--a most vile and awful thing.'</p>
<p>"The Husband recoiled in alarm.</p>
<p>"'<i>What have I done?</i>' he cried.</p>
<p>"'Fouled your own nest, bird of ill-omen,' was the reply.
'Falsely and filthily accused the sweetest and most innocent of
women. Spat your stinking poison at a star of Heaven,
immeasurably above you. Yes, and it falls back upon your own most
beastly face.'</p>
<p>"The Husband laughed.</p>
<p>"'Why all this heat,' he asked softly, 'since you are not her
lover?'</p>
<p>"'Because she is an innocent woman, you diseased hound, and I
will not hear her name befouled, not even by you. Nay,
<i>especially</i> by you, who should be her sure shield and
strong protection. You, the very man who should strike dead the
lying scoundrel who spoke evil. . . .'</p>
<p>"'Or did evil, eh?' interrupted the Husband. 'Strike him dead,
you said.'</p>
<p>"'I did, and I repeat it,' replied the forester. '<i>Evil</i>
in connection with that true, sweet, innocent woman!'</p>
<p>"'She is innocent, eh?' interrupted the Husband again.</p>
<p>"'You know it.'</p>
<p>"'And you? Are you innocent?'</p>
<p>"'You know it.'</p>
<p>"'Good. Then you shall prove it. Refuse to do what I now order
you to do, and I shall know, <i>know,</i> once and for all, that
you are a liar, a coward, and a thief, and that she is a . .
.'</p>
<p>"The forester raised his clenched fist, and the Husband sprang
back.</p>
<p>"'Blows prove nothing,' he cried. 'Fists are not arguments.
Come with me, and we shall see what we shall see--or hear . . .
<i>Innocent,</i> is she!'</p>
<p>"And with a bitter laugh he strode in the direction of his
house, followed by the forester.</p>
<p>"Silently opening the little garden gate, he laid a finger on
his lips and whispered:</p>
<p>"'Make a sound, and it is a certain proof of guilt. Come.'</p>
<p>"And taking the key from his pocket, he crept to the door, and
silently unlocked it.</p>
<p>"'Follow me,' he whispered almost inaudibly, and drew the
Lover into the house.</p>
<p>"There, in the darkness, behind the closed door, they stood.
The Husband, shaking with jealous rage, and scarcely able to keep
his twitching hands from the throat of the man whom he hated
beyond telling or belief; the Lover, sorely bewildered and
disturbed, but strong to protect and defend the woman whom
heloved.</p>
<p>"Thus they stood, silent in the noiseless darkness, till
suddenly the Husband, in low, tense whisper, bade the Lover mount
the stairs and open the door of the room where the woman
slept.</p>
<p>"'Go up, you dog,' he whispered, 'softly open the door, and
say, "<i>Lisette, it is I. I am here, Lisette, it is I,
Fritz</i>"--and we shall hear what she replies! Innocent, is she!
We shall see.'</p>
<p>"'I do not know the door,' answered the Lover. 'I have never
set foot upon those stairs.'</p>
<p>"'Liar!' whispered the Husband. 'Coward! Liar again! You dare
not. You are afraid of what she will say. You dare not stand
there in the dark, knowing that I am behind you with my
hunting-knife against your back, and say, "<i>Lisette, it is I,
Fritz. I have come to you.</i>" No, you know too well what she
will answer. "<i>You are late, my beloved</i>" . . . or "<i>And I
am waiting, my sweetheart Fritz</i>," . . . Eh? That's about what
we should hear, isn't it? Very awkward with the point of this
between your shoulder-blades, eh? . . . No, you don't know the
way to the door, do you?'</p>
<p>"'No,' replied the Lover. 'Show me the way. Creep softly, and
open the door yourself. Then stand behind me, place the point of
your knife just where you will, and I will call, "<i>Lisette, it
is I, Fritz. I have come to you</i>," and abide the result. Lead
on.'</p>
<p>"'Bluff and bravado,' growled the Husband, softly. 'We shall
see.'</p>
<p>"'Lead on,' whispered the Lover, and slowly, stealthily,
silently the two went up the stair. At the top, the Husband,
seizing the Lover's wrist, crossed a little landing at the end of
which a small window, vaguely outlined by starshine and the
feeble fleeting light of a lean cloud-haunted moon, was
visible.</p>
<p>"'This is the door,' he breathed, then directed the Lover's
hand toward the latch, swiftly stepped behind him and drew his
knife.</p>
<p>"After a brief fumbling at the latch, the Lover opened the
door, and with low insistent voice called, '<i>Lisette,
Lisette.</i>'</p>
<p>"And again:</p>
<p>"'<i>Lisette, Lisette.</i>'</p>
<p>"There was a faint sound of movement from the bed, and the
Lover felt a pressure on the left side of his broad back.</p>
<p>"'<i>Lisette,</i>' he called urgently.</p>
<p>"'<i>What? Who's that?</i>' came a woman's voice from the
pitchy darkness of the room.</p>
<p>"The pressure increased behind the forester's heart and he
fancied he felt the knife-point against his skin.</p>
<p>"'<i>It is I, Lisette,</i>' he said. '<i>It is I, Fritz. I
have come to you, Lisette.</i>'</p>
<p>"Dead silence in the blank black darkness.</p>
<p>"No reply. No movement. No sound--even of breathing.</p>
<p>"The pressure increased, and no doubt remained as to whether
the knife-point pricked the Lover's skin.</p>
<p>"'<i>Lisette,</i>' he said again. '<i>Speak to me, Lisette . .
. Say something. It is I, Fritz. Standing here in the doorway of
your room. Speak, Lisette.</i>'</p>
<p>"Silence.</p>
<p>"Aching, unbearable silence and suspense.</p>
<p>"'<i>Say something, Lisette. Speak to me.</i>'</p>
<p>"Silence.</p>
<p>"And then suddenly, at what seemed to be the very end of Time
itself, a voice came out of the darkness.</p>
<p>"'<i>You, is it, Frits?</i>' spoke the woman. '<i>And you have
opened the door of my room, and are standing there. Ah! . . .
Then listen, Fritz. And when I have spoken, you will know what to
do.</i>'</p>
<p>"The voice ceased, but not the increasing pressure behind the
young man's heart.</p>
<p>"'<i>I</i> <i>am listening, Lisette,</i>' he said.</p>
<p>"And Lisette spoke again.</p>
<p>"'<i>On the 25th day of June of last year, at about 9 o'clock
in the evening . .</i> .'</p>
<p>"The pressure suddenly relaxed--the knife was no longer
touching the young man's back.</p>
<p>"'. . . <i>a man was sitting on a log in the forest near the
waterfall. He had sold his winter's wood-carving that day, and
returning homeward had sat him down to rest and to gloat upon the
money he had got for it.</i></p>
<p>"<i>By a curious chance two people saw him</i>--<i>one of them
from some distance, but not from so far away that there could be
any possibility of mistake as to who sat there with</i> <i>the
last rays of the setting sun shining full upon him</i>--<i>nor
any possibility of mistake as to who was the other person who saw
him, and who crept stealthily upon him from behind.</i> THAT
<i>man was . . .</i>'</p>
<p>"'That's enough,' roared a bull voice in the darkness, and
almost in Fritz's ear.</p>
<p>"Dead silence.</p>
<p>"And then the voice of the Husband, a little shaky, false and
falsetto, gabbled unconvincingly,</p>
<p>"'Ha, ha, ha! What do you think of this for a joke, my love?
Fritz and I thought we'd play a little trick on you. I met him in
the forest on my way home. He said, "<i>Let's go and give little
Lisette a fright</i>."'</p>
<p>"'<i>Oh, you are there too, are you, Karl?</i>' replied a cool
voice from the darkness. And I swear there was a smile in the
voice.</p>
<p>"'<i>I think it was a splendid joke . . . a wonderful little
trick for Fritz, of all people, to suggest. And now the little
Lisette has had her fright, eh? Or</i> IS <i>it the little
Lisette who has had the fright?</i>'</p>
<p>"'Get out of this, you, quick,' growled the Husband, and gave
the Lover a thrust that sent him headlong down the stairs.</p>
<p>"Rising to his feet, the young forester debated for a moment
as to whether he should return in triumph and demand an apology,
in the name of Lisette, from that evil-thinking, unworthy animal
above. But natural delicacy joined with instinct and with wisdom
to forbid. Rarely are peacemakers really blessed who come between
husband and wife. . . . And the young man, bewildered, indignant,
angry and sore at heart, quietly went his way.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"And then for the Husband there followed a period of hell upon
earth that made the recent months of misery seem like halcyon
days of peace and joy. He had shown his hand, and Lisette had
shown her knowledge--her knowledge of a deed which he had
hitherto supposed no human eye had witnessed. He had shown his
hand, insulting and alienating his friend, insulting and
alienating his wife, and had proved nothing, gained nothing.
Gained nothing, save a dreadful Fear, a Fear that dogged him by
day and gripped him by night.</p>
<p>"How much did Lisette know?</p>
<p>"Everything, of course.</p>
<p>"How otherwise did she know the very hour at which old Caspar
Knutzen met his death. Had she followed and watched as he dragged
the frail old body to the mouth of the old disused mine and
thrust it over the edge? It mattered not, since she had witnessed
the crime.</p>
<p>"What a woman--to live with that secret in her heart and to
say nothing! But had she said nothing? Had she told her lover?
And if she had not told him, would she tell him now, in revenge
for his unpardonable offence, the insult of the unforgivable
accusation he had made against her and Fritz?</p>
<p>"In what a morass of fear, horror and suspense had he to walk?
If she had not told Fritz up to that very day, she might tell him
on the morrow. After any quarrel she might run to him with this
story of the murder.</p>
<p>"Did Fritz eye him queerly nowadays?</p>
<p>"Was there special meaning and triumph, as well as contempt
and scorn, in the glance which he gave him?</p>
<p>"And if she did tell Fritz, what was there to prevent their
getting him sent to the scaffold that they might be free to
marry? Or, for fear that that might look like interested
collusion, why should not Lisette denounce him to the world, go
to the Police and, after his execution, marry Fritz quietly, in
due course?</p>
<p>"And if she had not yet breathed a word about it to any living
soul, might she not still use this awful secret for her own ends?
Use it to secure his acquiescence and compliance? Perhaps use it
to make him agree to her divorcing him?</p>
<p>"Ah, divorce! Could he not divorce <i>her,</i> with the help
of perjured witnesses?</p>
<p>"The Husband was well aware that there are base scoundrels who
rid themselves of women from whom they wish to be free, by taking
action against them in the Divorce Court, and putting them in the
position of having either to defend their good name and remain
tied to the foul beast, who has accused them; or of gaining their
freedom at the cost of leaving the perjured liar's filthy
accusations unrefuted.</p>
<p>"But what would he gain, even if she and Fritz were willing to
remain undefended, and he succeeded in divorcing her? They would
marry and she would surely tell Fritz the husband what she might
not have told Fritz the lover. And Fritz, of course, would use
the knowledge to punish him for the lies and insults of the
divorce.</p>
<p>"And meanwhile, how much longer could he go on living in the
same house with this woman whom he dared not look in the face?
This woman whom he had so injured and insulted, even while she
knew this dreadful thing, and had said no word. And how could he
continue to meet this Fritz daily, this Fritz whom he had
insulted and accused, and who might, at any moment, learn that he
was a murderer, might indeed know it already? How much longer
could he go on living here, awaiting the heavy hand that would
one day fall upon his shoulder; awaiting the heavy knock that
would one day fall upon his door; fearing every stranger who
approached him; fearing the sound of every foot that followed him
in the forest or the town.</p>
<p>"Flight?</p>
<p>"And if he fled? Whither? And where would he be secure? For
the arm of the law is long, and the voice of the murdered dead is
loud, as it crieth for vengeance from the unconsecrated
grave.</p>
<p>"What to do? How many people knew? Almost certainly no more
than Lisette and Fritz. Quite probably Lisette alone. And if
Lisette alone knew, and anything--happened to--Lisette, then
<i>no one</i> would know, and all would be well, and the Husband
could struggle out of this fearful morass, shake its mud from his
feet, and walk forth a free man.</p>
<p>"But then again, how could one live without Lisette, the
beautiful, the sweet, the charming--and maddening--Lisette?</p>
<p>"Well, better to live without her, a free man, than live
without her in prison, or die without her, on the scaffold.
Lisette was dear, but life was dearer, and self-preservation is
man's first law.</p>
<p>"Yes, it looked as though the dear Lisette might have to die,
but clearly the first thing was to find out whether the good
Fritz had been told of the fatal secret. . . . And if he had, why
then it might prove a fatal secret indeed--for Fritz.</p>
<p>"How one's mind did run on! And how one thing led to
another--two more murders to cover one!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Meanwhile Fritz, the <i>garde-champêtre,</i> lived in a state
of unhappiness far removed indeed from the guilty misery of Karl,
but almost as far from his former condition of light-hearted
contentment and <i>joie-de-vivre.</i> Why had that
ill-conditioned cur behaved so, and spoilt everything between him
and Lisette; made them self-conscious and uncomfortable? Nothing
could ever be the same again, now that this hog had wallowed in
the dainty dream-garden of their delight.</p>
<p>"Life was spoilt and defiled, and instead of rising in the
morning with a song in his heart and thoughts of a glimpse of
Lisette, a word with Lisette, perhaps a walk with Lisette, he
must now avoid her, and slink shamefacedly past the cottage that
had been the lodestone of his thoughts, the haven of his dreams,
the shrine of his dear love.</p>
<p>"And what was the meaning of that astounding bedroom scene,
that drama played in darkness? What had Lisette meant, and why
had her reference to a man seated on a log so suddenly changed a
blustering and menacing bully into a frightened fool?</p>
<p>"How had Lisette known that Karl was standing there? Woman's
quick wit and intuition telling her that her friend Fritz would
not have come to her thus? . . . Had she guessed; and instantly
realized the plot and trap? Possibly she had heard them
whispering below. Anyhow, the cunning blackguard had had his
lesson; the evil-minded dog come whimpering to heel.</p>
<p>"But everything was spoilt and a heavy dirty hand had roughly
and rudely brushed the bloom from life's fairest and sweetest
fruit. Why was it that women such as Lisette married such men as
this Karl the Miller?</p>
<p>"What a man, what an animal, to be the husband and owner of
Lisette! How could she possibly tolerate him, much less love
him?</p>
<p>"No, if truth were told, the man whom Lisette loved was . .
."</p>
<p>"<i>That's enough,</i>" suddenly roared Corporal Heintz. "Fall
in. Stir yourselves, <i>salauds. . .</i> ."</p>
<p>And the weary squad dragged itself to its feet, and painfully
heaved its <i>sacs</i> to its shoulders.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 4</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On the following night, as the squad sat about the camp fire,
digesting the indigestible and smoking the unsmokable, Michael
Geste requested <i>le légionnaire</i> Gontran to continue the
story of his remarkable dream concerning the miller and the
forester.</p>
<p>"It certainly was some dream," observed Hank to his
friend.</p>
<p>"You've said something," replied Buddy. "If I could dream like
that, I'd dream you was a lovely girl, old Hoss; or else that you
was rich and had a generous nature. Nothing ain't impossible in
dreams."</p>
<p>"Which is the true dream, and which the true reality--that of
the sleeping night, or this of the waking day?" asked La
Cigale.</p>
<p>"How did the dream go on?" replied <i>le légionnaire</i>
Gontran to Michael Geste. "Oh, I dreamed that the woman died. . .
. Yes, in my dream I saw that unhappy lover, Fritz, receive a
letter. It was handed to him by a neighbour's half-witted son,
who, on being asked later whether a woman gave it to him said
'Yes,' and on being asked again if a man gave it to him, also
said 'Yes.'</p>
<p>"The letter was in the handwriting of Lisette. It seemed to
have been written in a state of some agitation and in great
haste, and it bade him come to her at ten o'clock that night, for
speak to him she must--and in the absence of her husband. The
latter had again gone away that day, saying he would be absent
for three nights at least. She relied on Fritz to come to her;
she knew that he would come, for she needed his help, and there
was something that must be done and done quickly.</p>
<p>"Beneath the signature of Lisette was an urgent appeal. It
seemed that she had started to write with discretion and
restraint, and at the last moment her feelings had overcome her.
Terror, anxiety and the very fear of death had broken the bonds
of prudence. She had written:</p>
<p>"'<i>Come and advise me and help me. He is so strange and
terrible, and I feel that I am in the greatest danger. I truly
believe that I'm being poisoned. What shall I do? Where can I go?
Help me, Fritz</i>.'</p>
<p>"You may imagine the state of mind in which the Lover spent
the hours which intervened. They were the longest through which
he had ever lived.</p>
<p>"At ten o'clock that night, he approached the dark and silent
house, opened the little garden gate, crept to the door, and
tapped softly.</p>
<p>"No answer. No movement within.</p>
<p>"Again he tapped, and again without response.</p>
<p>"In conjunction with the fact that no light burned in the
sitting-room, this was vaguely disquieting, though not
alarming.</p>
<p>"He tried the latch of the door, and found that the door was
not fastened. Should he walk in? She had bidden him come at ten
o'clock and the hour had struck.</p>
<p>"He entered warily, closed the door behind him, and softly
called, '<i>Lisette, Lisette</i>.'</p>
<p>"He struck a match, and entered the living-room. It was, as he
had expected, empty, though he had half hoped to see her sitting
there in the dark, awaiting him.</p>
<p>"Similarly deserted was the kitchen at the back of the
sitting-room.</p>
<p>"With swiftly-beating heart, he went to the foot of the
well-remembered stairs on which he had set foot but once, and
called her name. Again he called, more loudly; and yet again,
receiving no reply.</p>
<p>"What could be the meaning of this? Was it a trap, some new
and devilish ingenuity of her husband? Should he go up? No. How
explain his presence there, if Karl sprang out upon him, or were
lurking, awaiting him in the bedroom?</p>
<p>"But she had sent for him. She had implored him to be there at
ten o'clock, and time was passing. Should he not go up? Yes.
Lisette would not send for him and then go out of the
cottage.</p>
<p>"And if it were a trap, let the good Karl see what he had got
in his trap! He would not be the first setter of traps that had
caught a Tartar--not the first spider whose net had caught a
wasp.</p>
<p>"Yes, he would go up, and if the worst happened, things could
be no worse, apparently, for Lisette, and might, indeed, be made
very much better.</p>
<p>"The Lover climbed the stairs, and was confronted by a closed
door. Upon this he knocked again and again, receiving no
answer.</p>
<p>"He then tried the door, and found that this also was
unfastened. Opening it, he whispered, '<i>Lisette!</i>' and
louder and louder said, '<i>Lisette! Lisette!</i>' She could not
have gone to bed and be sleeping so heavily that his voice failed
to wake her.</p>
<p>"Of course she would not have gone to bed after having begged
him to come to her at ten o'clock. Could she possibly have gone
out into the forest to meet him, and have missed him in the
darkness? Almost impossible.</p>
<p>"With fear clutching at his heart, he struck a match. A
terrible cry burst from his lips, and dropping the match, he
covered his stricken eyes with shaking hands. On the bed lay
Lisette--dead. Murdered. Most violently and brutally
murdered.</p>
<p>"The reactions of the human mind to sudden emergency or shock
are strange and unaccountable, and are not to be foretold. His
first impulse was to flee from that dreadful spot. The next thing
was to fling himself upon the bed and shield in his embrace that
dear defiled and injured body; coax it back to life and movement
with his caresses.</p>
<p>"What he <i>did</i> do, was to strike a match and fumble at
the lamp with trembling fingers, the while waves of nausea,
grief, and rage shook him from head to foot. Having succeeded in
lighting the lamp, he took a grip upon his courage, and then,
turning to the bed, repressed his shuddering horror and strove to
do what might be done.</p>
<p>"Hopeless and useless. A hunting-knife had done its dreadful
work too well, in heart and throat; and all that the stunned,
incredulous and broken-hearted man could do, was to pray that he
might be vouchsafed sufficient length of life and health and
strength to become the instrument of vengeance.</p>
<p>"It was thus the police found him--the police who, it
appeared, had been anonymously warned to surround and enter the
house at the hour of ten-thirty, if they wished to prevent the
perpetration of a terrible crime, involving robbery and murder,
in the absence of the miller--a crime arranged for the hour of
eleven.</p>
<p>"There they found him, his hands stained with blood--a
picture, at any rate to the Police, of guilt as well as of horror
at the deed he had committed. Nor was the Sergeant of Gendarmes
disposed to change his opinion when he noticed that every drawer
in the room was opened and ransacked; and that a box, evidently
dragged from beneath the bed, had been burst open.</p>
<p>"To the fierce questions and demands of the Police, Fritz
could give no satisfactory reply. He could but protest his
innocence and swear that he had <i>happened</i> to enter the
house, had <i>happened</i> to go upstairs. . . .</p>
<p>"'Oh, quite so . . .' the Police had observed, nodding its
collective head. 'And had <i>happened</i> to go into the poor
woman's bedroom, and had <i>happened</i> to find her robbed and
murdered. A likely story.'</p>
<p>"And why, pray, had he gone to the house at all, at that time
of night?</p>
<p>"And in reply to that awkward question, the prisoner had
preserved a dogged silence.</p>
<p>"But the case proved to be far less simple than had, at first
sight, appeared, and the Police were mystified. Though they had
caught him in the very act--in the ransacked room itself, where
was the loot? Where were the money and poor jewellery that had
undoubtedly been taken from drawer and box? Though he had been
caught red-handed indeed, his hands red with the murdered woman's
blood, where was the weapon, and what the motive?</p>
<p>"And another most extraordinary feature of the case--where was
the husband? He had absolutely disappeared--vanished from off the
face of the earth.</p>
<p>"And was it literally from off the face of the earth, and was
he now under the earth in some secret grave dug for him by this
monster?</p>
<p>"And then again Fritz the forester was most certainly not a
monster, but a most worthy young man of excellent education,
known good character and unimpeachable virtue. Hitherto, at any
rate. But you never knew, you never knew. And the Police shook
its head darkly. Nevertheless the Police was mystified.</p>
<p>"But heart-broken Fritz the forester, in his dank dark cell,
was not mystified. He knew, with absolute certainty, as if he had
seen it all, that Karl had murdered Lisette, and with superhuman
devilish cunning had contrived to divert suspicion, blame, and
accusation upon the friend of whom he was jealous.</p>
<p>"Karl had never been the same man since that night of mad
accusation and infamous attempt at proof. He had gone from bad to
worse, and quite obviously had rendered Lisette's life
unbearable, until at length she had been driven, in fear of her
life, to write Fritz the letter that had brought him to the house
that terrible night.</p>
<p>"Obviously her husband, having told her that he was going away
from home again, had spied upon her and had either caught her in
the act of getting the letter to the half-witted go-between, or
had intercepted it <i>en route.</i> He had then waited as long as
he dared, had most foully and brutally murdered the poor girl,
and had taken all the money and jewellery that was in the house,
leaving the bedroom in calculated disorder.</p>
<p>"He had then gone off in the darkness, sent his anonymous
message to the police and escaped.</p>
<p>"A neat plot, and worthy of the Devil himself. But not quite
successful, for the four absent elements saved Fritz's
life--probably because he valued it so little--absence of motive,
absence of stolen property, absence of weapon, and absence of the
husband whom it was decided could not have been murdered and
disposed of--at any rate by the prisoner--between the time he was
last seen alive and the time of the arrest. Fortunately for
Fritz, his movements and whereabouts were known throughout the
earlier part of that evening.</p>
<p>"So, finally, Fritz was discharged with a stain upon his
character--a stain indelible; and in despair he left his home,
his beloved forest and his native land, and joined the Legion of
the Self-condemned. . . ."</p>
<p>The Dreamer fell silent.</p>
<p>"And is he in the Legion still?" asked Michael Geste.</p>
<p>"He dreams that he is," was the reply.</p>
<p>"And do you dream that he is?" asked John.</p>
<p>"I dream that I dream that he is," replied Gontran, turning
his curious pale, unsmiling eyes upon the boy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">II</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Life at Zinderneuf was life in death, and not infrequently
death in life. As <i>le légionnaire</i> Gontran observed, it was
like nothing on earth, but was indeed most remarkably like
something in Hell--one of Hell's punishment cells, where the
Devil sends defaulting fiends from his Penal Battalions when
other means have failed to repress them. But <i>le
légionnaire</i> Gontran had great compensations, for he had been
promoted Corporal.</p>
<p>On the day on which he stood forth, a Corporal revealed, with
two chevrons upon his cuff, he had gone in search of Corporal
Heintz. And tapping the two red chevrons upon his sleeve had
said:</p>
<p>"Ha, ha, my friend, now we shall see what we shall see."</p>
<p>But the triumph of Corporal Gontran had been brief, his grim
and menacing complacence short-lived, for the last official act
of the Commandant, Captain Renouf, on the very day that he shot
himself, was to promote Corporal Heintz to Sergeant. So a
Sergeant, pending confirmation in orders, Heintz became. And a
Sergeant can make himself quite as painfully unpleasant to a
Corporal as a Corporal can to a <i>légionnaire.</i> He can get
him reduced to the ranks, for example. Meanwhile he can punish
him with confinement to Barracks, or with <i>salle de police</i>
and he can get him sent to prison. Without punishing him at all,
he can make his life a burden, a misery and a shame, by
undermining his authority and making him ridiculous before the
men of his <i>escouade.</i> And he can legally and officially
hold him responsible for every fault committed by every man of
the room of which he is in charge.</p>
<p>It is probable that, on the whole, Sergeant Heintz made life
even more unbearable for Corporal Gontran than had Corporal
Heintz for <i>le légionnaire</i> Gontran. He quickly succeeded in
turning the unfavourable attention of <i>l'adjudant</i> Lejaune
upon the unfortunate man. To show forth their proper zeal beneath
the watchful eye of <i>l'adjudant</i> Lejaune, Sergeant Dupré and
Corporal Boldini, friends of Sergeant Heintz, joined
enthusiastically with him in discovering cause for
dissatisfaction with the work of Corporal Gontran.</p>
<p>One fortunate result of this state of affairs was that neither
Heintz nor Gontran had much time for bullying other people and
became almost popular.</p>
<p>But Sergeant Heintz overdid it, and, one night, Corporal
Gontran dreamed another dream, and when on the following day,
according to his wont, Sergeant Heintz jeeringly inquired as to
whether he had dreamed anything of interest lately, Corporal
Gontran replied that he had indeed. And something, moreover, of
personal interest to the good Sergeant himself.</p>
<p>It was a curious dream, and in two parts.</p>
<p>In the first of these, the Dreamer had dreamed of a most
regrettable and deplorable event, which was nothing less than the
premature demise of Sergeant Heintz himself.</p>
<p>Yes, he had seen him die.</p>
<p>"And how, might one inquire?" sneered Sergeant Heintz,
moistening dry lips.</p>
<p>"Well, in this curious dream of mine, Sergeant, you were
stabbed, just here and just here," and Corporal Gontran indicated
his heart and his throat. "Yes, you were stabbed in the heart and
in the throat, and you bled to death. When the murder was
discovered it was too late to do anything for you. You were
dead--oh, quite dead."</p>
<p>"And the second part of this interesting dream?" asked
Sergeant Heintz, as listening men, lounging outside the Guard
Room, edged nearer and nearer.</p>
<p>"Oh, very vague--you know what dreams are, Sergeant
Heintz--but somehow mixed up with the first one. As far as I can
remember, it was mainly about a <i>légionnaire</i> who had a
mission in life."</p>
<p>"What, to shirk work, and give trouble to his superiors?"
inquired Heintz.</p>
<p>"No, no. So far as I can remember, it was something more
difficult than that. It was to inflict punishment rather than to
get it. In fact, to inflict punishment without getting it. Yes,
that was it. I remember it quite clearly now, that part of it.
Yes, this <i>légionnaire</i> had to kill a man."</p>
<p>"Murder, eh?" sneered Sergeant Heintz. "Sort of thing you
would dream about."</p>
<p>"Well--not so much murder him as execute him. Take the law
into his own hands, or, one might say, assist the law--do what
the law had failed to do. Carry out the death sentence which the
law would most certainly and most righteously have passed upon
him had not the bestial and cowardly Judas fled beyond the reach
of its arm.</p>
<p>"Oh yes, an execution. That was his mission. And he not
unnaturally wanted to live awhile, to enjoy the satisfaction that
his good deed would bring him. . . . But in my dream--and I
remember this part most clearly--it seemed that he had come to
the conclusion that it really did not matter whether he lived or
not once he had fulfilled his task, done his duty by the
community and mankind in general, punished an unspeakable
villain, and avenged the best and sweetest soul that ever graced
this world. . . ."</p>
<p>"Quite a dream, in effect," interrupted Sergeant Heintz, his
livid face twitching.</p>
<p>"Yes, Sergeant Heintz," continued Corporal Gontran. "Quite a
dream. And making it perfectly clear that this <i>légionnaire</i>
had most finally and firmly decided that he had done wrong and
acted foolishly, in waiting for an opportunity to execute justice
without himself falling beneath the sword of justice. . . . Yes,
he saw the error of his ways, in that he had not immediately done
his duty and carried out his mission most cheerfully--as soon as
he found the man--and willingly offered his life as the price of
that privilege. Why, man, he had prayed--prayed most
fervently--that he might live to be the instrument of vengeance
upon that foul savage beast, that treacherous base brutal . .
."</p>
<p>As he spoke Corporal Gontran thrust his suffused face close to
that of Sergeant Heintz, raised his clenched fists, and slavered
at the mouth.</p>
<p>Clearly a case of <i>cafard</i>--the man was going mad--and
Corporal Boldini, seizing his arm, pulled him roughly away.</p>
<p>"I'll give you something to dream about," growled Sergeant
Heintz, "and before long, I'll put you where you'll stop dreaming
altogether."</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 2</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That night, a night so unbearably and dangerously hot that but
few could sleep, Beau Geste and his brother John sat side by side
beneath the desert stars, and talked of Digby, away at Tokotu, of
Brandon Abbas, and of old, happy, far-off things.</p>
<p>After a time they fell silent, and from the darkness of the
black shadow in which they sat against the wall, idly watched the
occasional comings and goings of their comrades, commenting from
time to time upon their more salient characteristics.</p>
<p>"Who's that with Boldini?" murmured Beau as two men passed in
the moonlight, their heads together in whispered converse.</p>
<p>"That weed Bolidar. They're very thick these days," replied
John.</p>
<p>As he spoke, Sergeant Heintz approached, and Bolidar slunk
away into the shadows. Heintz gave Bolidar a sharp order, and as
he hurried off to fulfil it, another man, descending steps that
led down from the roof, approached.</p>
<p>"The Lover and the Husband," murmured John. "Which is
which?"</p>
<p>"Neither of them really knows much of love, I think," replied
Beau.</p>
<p>Corporal Gontran and Sergeant Heintz met in front of the
brothers, and a few yards from where they were sitting.</p>
<p>"Get to your room and dream, you dog," growled Sergeant
Heintz. "Dream while you have yet time. Dream you're on the
scaffold and . . ."</p>
<p>"I'm dreaming now, Sergeant Heintz. I'm dreaming <i>now,</i>
you cesspool of sin," and, drawing his sword-bayonet, he stabbed
Sergeant Heintz in the left breast.</p>
<p>"<i>Lisette!</i>" he shouted, and as the stricken man
staggered back, sagged at the knees and fell to the ground,
Corporal Gontran struck again, driving the bayonet through the
Sergeant's throat.</p>
<p>"<i>Lisette!</i>" he cried a second time, and as the
astonished brothers sprang forward, he whipped out an automatic
pistol.</p>
<p>"Stand still," he shouted, "or I'll shoot you both. Stand to
attention until I tell you to move," and he covered them
alternately with the automatic.</p>
<p>"Keep still, John," murmured Beau, in English. "He's quite mad
and won't care whom he shoots. Wait till I say 'Now,' and then
jump to the right as I jump to the left. . . . <i>Wait,</i>
though."</p>
<p>"Good," whispered John. "You duck and collar him low, and I'll
jump for his pistol."</p>
<p>Corporal Gontran kicked Sergeant Heintz heavily.</p>
<p>"Can you hear, you dog?" he shouted. "Or are you dead?
'<i>Quite a dream in effect</i>,' eh?"</p>
<p>And then, with an incredible change of voice, he said, softly,
as he placed the muzzle of the pistol to his temple and gazed
upward at the stars:</p>
<p>"<i>Je viens, ma Lisette.</i>"</p>

<h1>PART III</h1>
<h1>PORT O' MISSING MEN</h1>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c301" id="c301"><i>The Return of Odo
Klemens</i></a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>"Did I ever see Odo Klemens again, after he deserted from the
Red Devil's <i>poste</i> with a haversack full of bombs, and his
dog Abd-el-Kader?" smiled Tant de Soif. "Yes and No. I did and I
didn't. But I'm quite sure that I heard his voice. There was no
mistaking that at all. It was a very curious voice--with steel in
it.</p>
<p>"What? No mistaking his face and figure either? No, you're
right. Talking nonsense, am I? Don't listen then.</p>
<p>"What I was trying to say was that I was on sentry, one day,
months later, and in quite a different place, when an
ordinary-looking <i>légionnaire</i> sauntered past me; perfectly
ordinary-looking, and yet not in the least so, if you understand
me.</p>
<p>"You don't? No, nor do I. He couldn't have been perfectly
ordinary-looking, for it was Odo Klemens, and nobody could ever
describe Odo thus.</p>
<p>"A what-d'-you-call it? A hallucination? No, for he addressed
me by an extremely foul, offensive and derogatory term of
endearment that nobody but Odo ever used.</p>
<p>"He stopped, yawned, scratched his head and, passing me again,
said,</p>
<p>Shut your eyes and your ears and your mouth, Old Bottle, or
I'll open the rest of you.'</p>
<p>"Well, it was no business of mine, was it? This was just a
<i>légionnaire</i> in uniform, going about his business. It was
no affair of mine that his face and voice were like those of my
beloved friend, my <i>copain,</i> Odo.</p>
<p>"So I forgave him for having landed me in the cart with the
Red Devil over that matter of the vanishing bombs; and again
sloping my rifle, proceeded to pace my beat in a smart and
soldierly manner.</p>
<p>"By and by, I seemed to see Odo Klemens stroll out again and
disappear down the track and round the mountain-side. . . .</p>
<p>"Other things disappeared too.</p>
<p>"Apparently somebody had borrowed the Commandant's field
note-book and diary, out of the pocket of his tunic where it hung
on a nail in his quarters; also some documents--telegrams,
correspondence, orders, from a file in his office; some maps and
a few other odds and ends, such as his field-glasses, compass,
automatic, and things like that: likewise a cipher-code, and
other curious and interesting things.</p>
<p>"It didn't look a bit like the work of a stray dog or a goat
or anything of that sort, especially as the telephone-wire had
been cut.</p>
<p>"It was a most amazing business, and there was a frightful
to-do about it.</p>
<p>"It must have been somebody in the <i>poste,</i> somebody who
could read French, and who knew exactly what he was looking for.
Whoever it was, had visited the quarters of every officer, and
been all over the place.</p>
<p>"A regular puzzle--for why should any of us cut our own
telephone-wire, and steal our own maps and codes and things. And
as the affair had happened in daylight, it was out of the
question that any Arab should have got inside; or, having got
inside, should walk about as though the place belonged to
him.</p>
<p>"It was unfortunate for Sergeant Schrammel that he had been
the senior non-commissioned officer in the <i>poste</i> at the
time, as he was held responsible. All the Officers and most of
the non-commissioned officers and men had been out on a
reconnaissance-in-force, or a tactical exercise, or picnic or
something; and the audacious thief, if he had come in from the
outside, must have known it. But of course this was impossible. I
gave my evidence, as required, and spoke up for Sergeant
Schrammel. Of course no Arab could have got into the place, and
of course sentries were on the alert, regularly posted and
relieved, and everything done according to the book.</p>
<p>"I did not mention my
what-d'-you-call-it--hallucination--about Odo Klemens, for
naturally the Commandant didn't want to hear anything about
day-dreams and foolish fancies. He was too busy with the sober
and serious facts of life, just then. Besides, there may have
been something wrong with the litre of wine I had had at
<i>soupe.</i></p>
<p>"Well, it was all satisfactorily cleared up, by reducing
Sergeant Schrammel and four Corporals to the ranks, severely
punishing everybody who'd been on guard that day, and making a
report to the effect that an even wilier Arab than most had been
even wilier than usual.</p>
<p>"Of course that satisfied everybody, except the people who
were punished. It satisfied me especially, because it proved to
me that I had been wrong in imagining that I had seen Odo. And
even then I sometimes thought I had, because nobody but he had
ever called me--what Odo called me again that day.</p>
<p>"That's why I answered 'Yes and No'; 'I did and I didn't';
when you asked me whether I ever saw Odo again after he deserted
with the bombs, and his dog Abd-el-Kader, from the Red Devil's
<i>poste.</i></p>
<p>"Hear his voice again? Oh yes, there was no doubt about that.
No doubt whatever. I had quite a chat with Odo, and reminded him
of the fact that he owed me five <i>sous.</i></p>
<p>"See him? No, I didn't see him.</p>
<p>"Why not? Because it was pitch dark, my good camel.</p>
<p>"The <i>groupe mobile</i> had broken up and gone into little
<i>postes</i> again, and we were having rather a bad time in this
one.</p>
<p>"They were a nasty lot, those Chleuchs. Got on one's nerves.
It was the first time we had come across a new trick of theirs,
and, until we grasped the idea, it had quite a success with
us.</p>
<p>"What was getting on our nerves was the fact that the sentry
on the wall--or who should have been on the wall--wasn't always
there when visiting-rounds came along. When the Sergeant went to
relieve him, he'd relieved himself. Or somebody else had.</p>
<p>"One could have understood his being found at his post, shot,
or even knifed, by some devil who'd climbed up; but during this
epidemic, the sentry's body was always found, in the morning,
outside the wall. He'd be lying there, with his throat cut; and
with nothing else. No rifle, ammunition and bayonet, of course,
and usually no clothes either.</p>
<p>"It seemed such a silly idea for a sentry to go down there to
have his throat cut, or, putting the boot on the other leg, it
seemed such a silly idea for the Arab to go up and do his job,
and then take the trouble to remove the remains. Obviously, one
or the other must have happened. Either the sentry must have gone
down to have it done, or the Arab must have come up to do it.</p>
<p>"Anyhow, there it was. Sentry after sentry was found down
below; and there was never once any blood or sign of a struggle,
up on the wall.</p>
<p>"Very funny. There were numberless theories. Some people held
that the silly sentry must have been fooled into coming down for
a drink or purse of money or a new <i>chapeau rond</i>--bowler
hat--set with diamonds; and when the silly <i>crétin</i> got down
there, he got his throat cut for his pains.</p>
<p>"But the objection to that theory was the fact that, if a man
were fool enough to contemplate going down in response to some
such inducement, he'd stop to reflect upon the fact that he
couldn't get back again. He'd have to go round to the front door
and sit on the doorstep and come in with the milk, and this would
be bad for his character, and give him an undesirable moral
reputation.</p>
<p>"Nor would he take his rifle down with him.</p>
<p>"Besides, how many men understood sufficient of the local
dialect of Arabic to be able to understand what was said to them
and be open to conviction, be amenable to reason--or reasons?</p>
<p>"Others thought that the men were trying to desert, and were
caught in the act by prowling enemies who hung about round the
<i>poste</i> all night. That again was absurd, of course. It
might have happened once, but hardly twice, let alone several
times.</p>
<p>"I remember one funny fat German lad had an idea that
beautiful <i>houris</i> came and lured these poor fellows to
their doom. I forget what he called them. <i>Lorelei,</i> or some
such nonsense. But as I pointed out to him--first see your
<i>houri.</i> For these jobs were always done on dark nights.</p>
<p>"Another half-wit spun some yarn or other about Oriental
magicians who could put a spell on you, hypnotize you, so that
you had to come when you were called. I told him that if he was
called and felt he'd got to go, it would be a good plan to send a
bullet first, or at least to go with his bayonet in front of
him.</p>
<p>"Well, what is rather interesting is that, one night, this
German boy and I were for guard, and he went on sentry after
telling me exactly what he'd do if he beheld a <i>houri.</i></p>
<p>"Whatever he beheld, he didn't do it; and we never saw him
again--alive.</p>
<p>"Same thing. Missing from his post; and his body down there a
few yards from the wall, in the morning, stripped and mutilated.
Not a sound out of him, either. Just disappeared from his post in
perfect silence. Why hadn't he challenged and fired his rifle?
Why had he gone down? For, quite obviously, the business had been
done down below there. Not a spot of blood up above, nor the
slightest sign of a struggle.</p>
<p>"Wasn't that funny? Because if an Arab had somehow got up on
to the parapet, crept up behind him and laid him out without a
sound--why, as I said before, should he go to all the trouble of
moving the body away? . . .</p>
<p>"Then came the turn of the man who talked about magicians and
hypnotism. Polowski, his name was, this gentleman who suffered
from intelligence.</p>
<p>"His magician got him all right; and before he could do
anything with his rifle or bayonet.</p>
<p>"'Well,' I said to him, as I viewed his most
unpleasant-looking corpse, 'he hypnotized you all right. Why
didn't you listen to my warning and take my advice?'</p>
<p>"But I felt very uncomfortable myself nevertheless, for of
course poor young Schultz and this Polowski had only been talking
nonsense about their <i>houris</i> and their magicians.</p>
<p>"I should have known how to deal with either of those funny
things myself; but what troubled me was that I had not the
faintest idea as to what it really was that would go for me,
sooner or later. We all felt the same, too, so you can imagine
that that big <i>poste</i> was not a very happy one. Nobody there
cared the smell of a cork for any human being on earth, or for
anything they could see. . . . Of course. . . . But as you may
have noticed, these are apt to be just the people who get most
bothered about things they can't see and don't understand.</p>
<p>"Well, there it was. For a week or two, all would be well; and
then somebody's <i>copain,</i> perhaps the only friend he had in
the world, the only thing he loved, would be down below there,
butchered and mangled.</p>
<p>"Oh yes, the Commandant and Officers did everything they knew.
Sentries were visited constantly; strictest orders were given
about shooting on sight--or sound; pickets and patrols were
almost incessantly moving about; and N.C.O.s got hardly any sleep
at all. If somebody was trying completely to upset the
<i>poste</i> and shatter everybody's nerves and demoralize the
lot of us, he was in a fair way to succeed.</p>
<p>"One night there was an alarm. The sudden bang of a rifle, a
'<i>Qui va là?</i>' and then '<i>Aux armes!</i>'</p>
<p>"The sentry swore he'd heard voices just down below the
embrasure by which he was standing, and that he had immediately
challenged and fired. Oh yes, he was quite certain he had heard
voices.</p>
<p>"Perhaps he had.</p>
<p>"So did Joan of Arc.</p>
<p>"Anyhow, the voices had not left any footprints or other
traces, and the Commandant seemed to be in two minds as to
whether he should boot Gomez in the seat of the pants for a liar,
or give him half-a-litre of wine for a wide-awake sentry, prompt
and alert.</p>
<p>"His <i>escouade</i> didn't quite know what to make of his
yarn either, because he told us, in private, that the voices he'd
heard spoke French. When we wanted to know exactly what the
voices had said, he swore that, first of all, there was a low
guarded sort of whistle and then a whisper in French, asking him
who he was and inquiring after three or four of us by name.</p>
<p>"Had it not been for recent murders, Gomez would have
answered. He would have hung out through the embrasure, he said,
and had a chat with whoever was down below, just to while away
the time, and on the chance that he might hear something to his
advantage.</p>
<p>"As it was, he instantly and very naturally connected this
curious phenomenon with the dirty work that had deprived us of
the society of Schultz, Polowski, Rameau, Lincke, and the rest.
So, without answering at all, he just shoved his rifle out
through the embrasure, fired, challenged, and bawled the
alarm.</p>
<p>"He was so earnest and certain, that some of us believed him
as a truthful upright man, and others admired him as a most
circumstantial and convincing liar.</p>
<p>"It was all very puzzling and troublesome, because we badly
wanted to find out what really was happening, and to know what
was the best thing to do when our own turn came.</p>
<p>"Mine came all right, and I found that Gomez had spoken the
truth.</p>
<p>"There never was a more wide-awake sentry than I, that
night.</p>
<p>"Sergeant Montreuil had just paid me a surprise visit, and I
was very much on the alert.</p>
<p>"Suddenly there was a very quiet, yet urgent, sort of whistle
just down below where I was standing. It was the sort of
<i>hsst</i> kind of whistle that you give when you want to
attract the attention of one particular man without attracting
that of others; the sort of noise you make when you want to get
somebody's attention without in the least advertising your
presence.</p>
<p>"I pricked up my ears.</p>
<p>"There it was again.</p>
<p>"<i>Hsst!</i> And then:</p>
<p>"'<i>Sst!</i> Who's up there? Is that you, Skin-the-dog?'</p>
<p>"Well! That was funny. . . . Definitely there was somebody
down below who talked French, and knew that, for a certain
reason, Zigzig Dubonnet was known as 'Skin-the-dog.'</p>
<p>"I leant through the embrasure, shoved my head out and looked
down.</p>
<p>"It wasn't very much good doing that, because in spite of the
stars it was a dark night--black, yet shiny, like the seat of the
Duke of Hell's dress-trousers. But it seemed to me it would be
rather futile simply to bang off my rifle at nothing, and then
report that I'd heard a voice. In the first place, I probably
shouldn't be believed; and in the second, I should probably be
told I was a bone-headed mule for not trying to find out who it
was and what he wanted; what he wanted me to do, <i>c'est à
dire;</i> what inducement he would offer me to come down and be
killed.</p>
<p>"Anyhow, I hung out over the wall and peered down into the
darkness below.</p>
<p>"'Let's have a look at you,' said I, conversationally. 'Strike
a match.'</p>
<p>"But something struck me instead; struck my head and knocked
my <i>képi</i> off.</p>
<p>"No, it wasn't a stone. I thought so myself for a moment,
until I realized that, whatever it was, had come from left to
right at the same level as my head, so to speak. For it had
definitely struck the left-hand side of my <i>képi</i> and
knocked it across my head, over on to my right ear, before
carrying it away altogether.</p>
<p>"In my surprise I uttered an exclamation, and I heard a quiet
chuckle down below.</p>
<p>"'Why, it's old Tant de Soif,' said the voice, disguised and
hoarse, in a sort of loud whisper.</p>
<p>"'It is,' said I, 'and what the devil do you think you . .
.'</p>
<p>"And then things happened.</p>
<p>"I was struck again--lightly, this time--on the side of the
neck, and instantly something coiled itself round and round my
head and throat and neck and the arm that I instantly shot
out.</p>
<p>"And, before I could utter a sound, I was hauled through the
embrasure and fell with a thud on to the sand below.</p>
<p>"Almost before I struck the sand, I saw it all! . . . A decoy
called the sentry and he stuck his head and shoulders out over
the wall, just visible from below and silhouetted against the
sky.</p>
<p>"Another man, standing ready, whirled round and round, in an
upright circle, a rope with a stone attached to the end of it.
Not round his head, you understand, parallel with the ground, but
perpendicularly, parallel with the wall.</p>
<p>"Suddenly he lengthened the rope so that the stone passed
above the sentry's head as it was stuck out over the wall. When
the rope touched him, the remaining end, with the stone attached,
whirled swiftly, coiling about him. And as it did so, the man at
the other end hauled, and jerked him off the wall before he could
free himself.</p>
<p>"A Portuguese told me they hunt in Brazil with a
weapon--called a <i>bola,</i> or something--made on the same
principle, with a couple of leaden balls at the end of a cord.
They throw it, and it coils round the legs of the animal--wild
horse, jaguar, Indian, or what-not.</p>
<p>"I thought of all this in the very act of falling, and I knew
that in the half of two seconds I should be filleted alive.</p>
<p>"As I hit the ground, men sprang upon me, pinned me down, arms
and legs and throat, and another clapped his hand over my mouth
and stuck the point of his knife in under my ear. Not far enough
to cause any great oozing forth of the brain, but enough to be
uncomfortable.</p>
<p>"'Make a sound, and I'll slit your throat,' said the voice in
French. 'Now listen. You tell your Commandant that the Arabs are
going to attack <i>Poste</i> G to-morrow, in tremendous force. I
have come to warn him. See? I don't want them to get <i>Poste</i>
G because it is full of good friends of mine--if for no other
reason. I'm risking my life doing this. Tell him to send all you
lot to <i>Poste</i> G as quickly as possible. It's the only
chance of saving it. And don't forget I've risked my life
to-night to warn him. Now we are going to take your rifle and
bayonet and ammunition and your coat and <i>képi,</i> and I'm
going to make them spare your life so that you can warn the
Commandant. . . . And don't, for your own sake, make a row until
we are well away.'</p>
<p>"Anyhow, I couldn't make much row with a fist like a ham
clamped over my mouth, and with the point of a knife sticking in
under my ear.</p>
<p>"Nor did it seem a sound plan to do so while they were tearing
off my <i>capôte.</i></p>
<p>"Suddenly I was alone, released, unhurt, except for a nasty
shaking and a jab under the ear.</p>
<p>"I was just going to let a loud yell and start bawling '<i>Aux
armes!'</i> when it occurred to me that I should almost certainly
get shot for my pains. So I crawled a reasonable distance from
the Fort, lay down and took a nap till daylight. And in the
morning I arose, blew my nose by way of toilet, and then marched,
in broad daylight and good order, up to the gate.</p>
<p>"They could hardly believe their eyes.</p>
<p>"Here was dear old Tant de Soif restored to their midst, safe
and sound, hale and hearty! Tant de Soif whose absence had been
discovered during the night, and for whom they had been bitterly
mourning.</p>
<p>"'At last, at last!' they had said. 'After forty years of
soldiering; after seven campaigns in five different parts of the
world; seventeen battles and thirty-nine skirmishes they've got
our beloved and admired Tant de Soif at last.'</p>
<p>"And here I was back once more, all present and correct.</p>
<p>"'Well, I'm damned,' gasped Père Poussin. 'I knew this animal
wasn't dead. The Devil looks after his own!' and burst into
tears.</p>
<p>"And thus it was that all of them, excepting, of course,
non-commissioned officers, who affected to regret that I had not
shared the fate of the other butchered sentries, loudly
rejoiced.</p>
<p>"Of course I had to tell my tale to the Commandant, and a
noble tale I made of it. In spite of my natural modesty, I didn't
come out of it at all badly.</p>
<p>"And when I had done, he sat for some time in thought, his
head on his hand, sometimes shooting a question at me, sometimes
gazing right through me, sometimes tapping the blotting-paper on
the table in front of him.</p>
<p>"'Going to attack <i>Poste</i> G, eh?' he said at length.
'Going to attack <i>Poste</i> G--and we are to march every man we
can spare, to their relief.'</p>
<p>"'<i>Oui, mon Commandant,</i>' I agreed, 'or to strengthen the
garrison of <i>Poste</i> G before they are attacked.'</p>
<p>"There was a long silence.</p>
<p>"'Quite so,' he said at last, and turned to <i>Adjudant</i>
Schonfeld.</p>
<p>"'Said they were going to attack <i>Poste</i> G in tremendous
force, eh! Then I think we will get three-quarters of the
garrison of <i>Poste</i> G over here, for this is where the
attack will come. . . . Get on the telephone at once,
Schonfeld.'</p>
<p>"And that was what he and the Commandant of <i>Poste</i> G
decided on.</p>
<p>"Of the hundred men in <i>Poste</i> G seventy-five were
despatched immediately, by a forced march, to our <i>poste;</i>
and we made every possible preparation to give the Arabs a warm
reception when they attacked us.</p>
<p>"And meanwhile they fell upon <i>Poste</i> G precisely as the
voice had warned us, overwhelmed it, burnt and destroyed it, and
killed every single man of its defenders.</p>
<p>"A clever trick to get the garrison away. . . .</p>
<p>"And out of that little business Odo Klemens got two
machine-guns, thirty rifles, a tremendous haul of ammunition and
some fine pickings.</p>
<p>"Oh yes, the voice had been that of Odo Klemens. But I did not
mention the fact to the Commandant."</p>

Klemens</i></a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 1</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Young Fat'ma, undesired and uncherished daughter of Yakoub Ali
ben Abdul Hassan, known as El Wazir ed Dimiryat, of the fierce
fighting tribe of the Beni Baggaroni, was, as has been said
elsewhere, a merry lass, a great flirt, a person of character
(not all bad), and, at the age of fifteen, a woman who knew her
own mind.</p>
<p>After the sudden death of her boy-friend, Ibrahim ben Ghulam
Mahommed, killed at the age of sixteen by the bursting of his
ancient gun as he took a potshot at a French soldier, Fat'ma was,
for a time, noticeably less merry, even less flirtatious.</p>
<p>But only for a time.</p>
<p>The world is wide; the sun is bright; the mountains are
glorious--and men are plentiful. There are rounder pebbles in the
brook than ever came out of it. Besides, young Ibrahim had been
but a boy, albeit a handful of a boy for a lass to manage, and
Fat'ma was now a grown woman--sixteen herself, next month of
Ramazan.</p>
<p>Well, well. Poor Ibrahim. Lifelong playmate. . . . But . . .
What an amazingly lovely man was the Hadj el Aleman.<sup>1</sup>
Now <i>that</i> was a man, not a puling boy, making a great to-do
about killing his first Frenchman. Why, the Hadj el Aleman killed
them wholesale. Where her own father, Yakoub Ali ben
Hassan--great warrior that he was--had slain his tens, the Hadj
el Aleman had slain his hundreds; thousands, perhaps.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><sup>1</sup> The German.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He was as great a raider and slayer as El Raisuli himself;
great almost as our Lord Sidna Abdel-Krim.</p>
<p>Why, he had captured real forts, and looted and burned them
after putting their garrisons to the sword. He had laid ambushes
in defiles, trapped whole detachments, holding them there under a
rain of tribesmen's bullets until they had perished to a man.</p>
<p>He had swooped suddenly down upon convoys of food, clothing,
ammunition and the <i>shraab</i> of the Infidels. He had gone
alone, or with but one or two followers, and decoyed the French
sentries from their posts, bringing them to serve under the
banner of Abdel-Krim. Others, who would not come, he had slain,
and everywhere he had left a writing, a piece of the white paper,
with 'Hadj Aleman' written on it.</p>
<p>He could ride like a Bedouin; fight like a Riffian; run up a
hillside like a mountaineer; shoot like a <i>hamsain</i>
marksman; do anything.</p>
<p>He was a wonderful hero, of whom all men were talking. . . .
And he had looked at her. He had looked at her in such a way that
she knew she had found favour in his sight.</p>
<p>It had been an honour and a thrill and a joy, the proudest and
happiest moment of her life, when he had taken from her, in her
father's house, a cup of coffee that she had prepared with her
own hands.</p>
<p>He had ridden up with his followers, her father among them,
and, entering, for rest and refreshment after a six-hours' ride,
had caused a tremendous stir in the household, and, indeed, the
whole village.</p>
<p>The men had sat in a circle on the floor in the best room in
her father's house, and drunk hot mint-tea, while a meal of
<i>couscous</i> and stewed kid had been prepared.</p>
<p>And when, after they had eaten, she had herself brought the
little clay cups of coffee, he had noticed her, given her a long,
long look, and smiled. Also he had touched her hand. And she had
understood.</p>
<p>And the tales she had heard of him that night, as her father's
wives, women-folk, and slaves of the <i>haremlik</i> had finished
the remains of the meal and cleared away the dishes! The stories
they had told of him and his courage and daring, his marvellous
adventures, his audacity, skill, knowledge--and success.</p>
<p>And that curious story of the young French officer, a mere
boy, and the strange madness with which Allah had suddenly--but,
happily, only briefly--smitten El Hadj Aleman, the ruthless, the
fierce, the slayer, the scourge of the French.</p>
<p>Old Miriam had seen it herself. She had been there. Aye, and
with a good sharp kitchen-knife in her hand, too. A knife with
which she had cut the throat of many a kid, and jointed many a
sheep.</p>
<p>The young officer had been marching at the head of a small
half-company of French soldiers. In his inexperience, or his
helplessness to do otherwise, he had led them through a deep and
gloomy defile. Suddenly the steep boulder-strewn hillsides had
come to life. From behind every bush and rock had arisen a silent
grey-clad man, who, raising his rifle, had taken steady aim and
fired . . . and fired . . . until scarcely a man of the French
had been left upon his feet.</p>
<p>What could they do, the poor silly sheep that huddled together
and fired at nothing--fired at the empty place where a minute
before a tribesman had lain hidden?</p>
<p>And then, at a sudden uprising and shout from El Hadj Aleman,
the sons of Allah had risen to their feet, drawn their swords and
knives, and rushed like an avalanche down upon the wounded
remaining few. These they had overborne, cut down, stabbed and
stabbed again, hacked to pieces.</p>
<p>All save one, the young officer, who had looked but little
older than poor Ibrahim ben Ghulam Mahommed. Upon him, her uncle
Haddu ben Hamid had leapt like a tiger, borne him to the ground,
and strangled him till he was all but dead.</p>
<p>And from him he had driven off the others, saying:</p>
<p>"Let's take him with us and have some merry sport; thereafter
giving him to the women, belike."</p>
<p>And so, leaving in the defile the naked mangled corpses to
bake in the sun and be eaten by dogs, jackals, crows and
vultures, they had brought him back alive, almost unhurt, to
Hamid's house; and old Miriam, who had been there at the table at
the time, had seen him come--and had sharpened her knife.</p>
<p>Then the men had wrangled. Some had wanted to mutilate him,
keep him alive, and make him a slave. Others had said:</p>
<p>"No. Bind him to a pole and feed him, feet first, into a
fire."</p>
<p>Others had said:</p>
<p>"Bury him alive."</p>
<p>And there had been an amendment in favour of doing this, but
leaving his head exposed to the sun, the insects, and the
dogs.</p>
<p>Finally it had been decided to strip him, submit him to
hideous indignities, and pile great heavy stones upon his body so
that he could not move, but also could not die, until he starved
to death, or died of pain, sunstroke and madness.</p>
<p>But this was altogether too slow a business to suit some of
the men and any of the women; and old Miriam, running out from
ben Abdul Hassan's house, with a bowl of honey, had poured it
over his face as he lay gasping and trying not to groan with
pain. . . .</p>
<p>Ants . . . starving village curs. . . .</p>
<p>Some hours later, Hadj el Aleman, knowing nothing of what had
been done with the captive, sent for him that he might
interrogate him, give orders for him to be shot at dawn, or have
him returned in humiliating fashion, the bearer of an impudent
and defiant letter, to the French.</p>
<p>And when Hadj el Aleman was told that the French officer could
not come to him, and why, he rose from the mattress on which he
had been resting, rushed forth from the house, dashed into the
jeering crowd of men and women that thronged around the tortured
officer, thrust men left and right and, with his bare hand,
struck senseless a man who confronted and opposed him.</p>
<p>The Shereef of the village and the Badsha of Targuit
remonstrated with him and he struck them both. Clearly he was
afflicted of Allah. Mad. For he had grievously and impiously
smitten the Shereef himself in the face, and knocked the turban
from the head of the Badsha.</p>
<p>Mad or not, Hadj el Aleman or German deserter from the French
Army, he must not do that.</p>
<p>Such things could not be countenanced.</p>
<p>He must be seized and secured; and a dozen men, springing upon
him, eventually overcame him and bore him to the ground.</p>
<p>Shouting and cursing, kicking and struggling, fighting like
one possessed of a devil, he was carried back into the house,
held down and secured; and there, gagged and bound, he lay
writhing, fighting to burst his bonds; while, outside, the
tortured French officer screamed to his God for mercy.</p>
<p>It might have gone hard, even with the Hadj el Aleman himself,
but that the Shereef, who loved him, pleaded for him, pointing
out that the Afflicted of Allah are responsible neither for their
thoughts, their words, nor their deeds; and that, moreover, they
themselves would be pretty quickly afflicted of El Sidna
Abdel-Krim, did any harm come, at their hands, to the Kaid el
Hadj . . .</p>
<p>Later, it transpired that the Kaid himself had once, when
fleeing from the French to join the Beni Warrain, been
treacherously seized by some villagers, had seen his own grave
dug, been thrust into it, and actually buried to the neck, before
the head man of the village, returning in time, had objected,
pointing out that it was a wicked waste of a perfectly good
slave, and had had him disinterred.</p>
<p>Doubtless it was this that had given him a kind of objection
to that sort of thing; otherwise why should he, the Scourge of
the French, who hated and slew them at every opportunity, have
objected to the torturing of this lad.</p>
<p>Yes, a strange man, this hero; but brave as a lion, swift as
an eagle, strong as a horse, straight as a lance, and beautiful .
. . how beautiful--with his great dark eyes, like those of a
Moor; his thick black beard, curly and soft as silk; and his
lovely smooth brown skin, far darker than her own.</p>
<p>Really a Moor, of course, a Riffi and a Prince in Islam, for
all his nickname of Aleman.</p>
<p>A lovely man. . . .</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But so was Hassan the Pedlar.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 2</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Kaid el Hadj, the Hadj el Aleman, sat busily writing in
his fine house, or rather the fine house of the Badsha of
Targuit; successful, established, at the height of his influence
and power.</p>
<p>To him, squatted on his cushioned mattress in the bare
whitewashed room, entered his confidential devoted servant, Ali,
bearing a kettle of boiling tea and a glass from which to drink
it.</p>
<p>"There's a man, Sidi," said he.</p>
<p>"Lots of them," smiled the Kaid el Hadj. "What sort of a
man?"</p>
<p>"A <i>Roumi.</i> By his clothes, or rags, a deserter from the
Spanish Foreign Legion. He is a German, and craves speech with
the Hadj el Aleman."</p>
<p>"A spy, scouting; or a captured runaway?"</p>
<p>"Allah knows, Sidi. He seems to be one of those who would fain
serve our Lord, Abdel-Krim."</p>
<p>"Bring him in when I have drunk my tea and smoked my pipe of
the forbidden."</p>
<p>For, known only to his confidential servant, and one or two
intimates of a like laxity, the Kaid el Hadj smoked a daily pipe
of the prohibited <i>hashish.</i></p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>"Well, who are you? What do you want?"</p>
<p>The man, a dark bearded fellow, clad in ragged khaki, gave a
military salute.</p>
<p>"A German-Balt, your Excellency," he answered. "From Grusche
in Courland. I speak Lettish better than I do German, and I have
been talking Spanish so long that I speak that better than
either; and I can talk French too. I could be very useful your
Excellency. A trained soldier. Artillery during the war;
infantry, of course, in the Spanish Foreign Legion. Saw a lot of
rough guerrilla warfare against the Bolsheviks after the war; in
the Baltic Landwehr. Wounded at the storming of Riga.</p>
<p>"Then the Regiment was almost wiped out by the Lithuanians at
Radziwiliski. When we were disbanded, in Jüterborg, after the
settlement, I went to Germany, and starved for a winter. Tramped
to Neustadt and joined the French Foreign Legion. They had a
depôt there, during the Occupation. Got so fed up with the Legion
that I deserted into Spanish Territory, was arrested there and
given the choice of joining the Spanish Foreign Legion or being
returned to the French one. Joined the Spanish."</p>
<p>"And know a good deal about Spanish ways and methods, eh?"</p>
<p>"Yes, your Excellency. I could be very useful."</p>
<p>"Know Melillah and Ceuta, and some of the border outposts,
eh?"</p>
<p>"Yes, your Excellency. Especially those nearest to the Riff
country. Oh, I could be very useful."</p>
<p>"H'm. And why did you desert from the Spanish Legion?"</p>
<p>"To better myself, your Excellency," replied the man simply.
"A good soldier. Name of Kreuder . . ."</p>
<p>The Hadj el Aleman grinned.</p>
<p>"We get any number of deserters from the French and Spanish
Legions here," he said. "We generally give them a kick in the
seat of the pants, and let them go. Deserters are apt to get the
deserting habit."</p>
<p>"Not always, your Excellency," replied the man meaningly as he
gazed hardily and fearlessly into the eyes of Odo Klemens.</p>
<p>The adventurer laughed.</p>
<p>This might be a man after his own heart.</p>
<p>"Know Dusseldorf, by any chance?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Not to say <i>know</i> it," replied the man. "I begged
through the streets one happy week-end of east wind and ceaseless
rain; and dossed down in the railway-station waiting-room until a
damned officious copper came and kicked me out, asked for my
papers, and, because I couldn't square him, ran me in."</p>
<p>"Do you remember any of the buildings, streets, big
shops?"</p>
<p>The man thought a while.</p>
<p>"I remember the Carsch Store."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes! . . . Well, well! . . . In the Kolnstrasse . .
."</p>
<p>"And I got a stale loaf from Bauer's Restaurant."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes! . . . Well, well! . . . <i>Mein Gott,</i> the
gallons of lager I've drunk in the garden behind the Bauer, when
I was a . . . But that'll do about Dusseldorf. . . . And so you
want to serve under the banner of El Sidna Abdel-Krim, Kaid of
the Mountains?"</p>
<p>"I want to serve you, your Excellency," replied the man.</p>
<p>"Well, it's good to talk German again," said the Hadj Aleman,
and, frowning, added:</p>
<p>"Damn Germany! . . . Damn France! . . . Damn Europe! . . .
Damn Christianity and all Christians. . . . And you too! . . .
Would you be prepared to renounce your nationality and your
religion, to become a professing Mahommedan and a naturalized
Moor and Riffian, like myself?"</p>
<p>"And to marry two or three fine <i>Arabiya</i>," grinned the
man. "Would I not? To have a harem and . . ."</p>
<p>"To Hell with you, you damned rascal," growled the
<i>hadji.</i> "I'll talk to you again later on, and we will see
what can be done about you."</p>
<p>And, clapping his hands, he gave orders to his servant that
the man should be fed and well treated--and well watched
also.</p>
<p>For some weeks the German deserter hung about, unobtrusively
making himself useful where he could, and evidently taking most
careful note of all things. Obviously a man who intended to make
good, to make his way in the world, this new Moorish world into
which he had escaped.</p>
<p>But, evidently he had, alas, the deserting habit; for, from
the service of Abdel-Krim--or of the Hadj el Aleman--he deserted
also.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 3</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yes, this Hassan the Pedlar was undeniably a fine figure of a
man, and a man with some sense, too: a man with a wonderful
understanding of what a girl liked, and of what she wanted.</p>
<p>And amazingly generous too. Quite different from those pigs of
Jew pedlars who sometimes came round, haggling and driving hard
bargains; and who frequently got robbed and well beaten for their
pains.</p>
<p>He must be a pretty wealthy man too, this Hassan the Pedlar.
No miserable little donkey-load of cheap <i>Mericani</i> stuff
for him, with a negro half-wit for his only assistant, servant,
and donkey-boy.</p>
<p>No, something quite different from those hungry
burro-wallopers who sometimes found their way up here. Why, he'd
got a regular caravan down in the valley--camels and several
men--and he rode a fine horse.</p>
<p>And what an interest he took in Fat'ma, daughter of Yakoub Ali
ben Abdul Hassan.</p>
<p>And Fat'ma gazed, smiling reminiscently, at a quite handsome
little bangle that adorned her shapely arm. Oh, a really generous
man, though of course nobody gave something for nothing.</p>
<p>Still, some things that called themselves men tried to give
nothing for something, or just as little as they possibly could,
and their own mothers couldn't call them generous.</p>
<p>But this Hassan the Pedlar . . .</p>
<p>What would it be like to marry a wealthy merchant who spent
most of his time travelling, but who nevertheless had a fine
house in Fez, as Hassan said he had. Perhaps he was a liar, like
most other men.</p>
<p>Still, his horses and camels and well-armed servants were real
enough. So were his bales, his carpets, rugs, silks, shawls,
<i>robas,</i> veils, trousers, vests, slippers, lovely
leather-work; and his box that he said contained priceless
jewellery, gold ornaments and precious stones. Perhaps! . . .</p>
<p>Anyhow, the lovely necklace, or head ornament, of rows of gold
coins, was real enough. She had had it in her own hands and
examined every coin, and the links that joined them together. She
had put it round her throat, draped it across her forehead. Why,
it must be worth . . . She didn't know what it was worth, but a
gold twenty-franc piece was worth twenty francs, wasn't it?</p>
<p>And as for the man himself, there wasn't a bigger, broader,
finer man in all El Moghreb.</p>
<p>But, of course, the Hadj el Aleman would be a better catch,
although Hassan the Pedlar was an equally lovely man. The Hadj el
Aleman, honoured and beloved of El Sidna Abdel-Krim (Lord of the
Atlas, grand Kaid of the Riffi, conqueror of France and Spain,
and probable future Sultan of Morocco), might rise to any height;
might even become Sultan himself.</p>
<p>On the other hand, suppose he fell from grace? With a word,
Abdel-Krim could strip him of everything and throw him into a pit
to starve; blind him, and cut off his hands and feet; destroy his
house utterly.</p>
<p>Still, one had to take chances in this life. Not that she
would have very much say in the matter. Her father would dispose
of her as he thought fit, and as he would dispose of any other of
his stock, his cattle, his camels and his horses.</p>
<p>Unless, of course, she ran off with this Hassan the Pedlar.
That would be a great lark.</p>
<p>But she'd be much more of a grand lady if she married the Hadj
el Aleman. But then he had three wives and some children already,
not to mention some matrimonial odds and ends among the Beni
Wazain, from whom he had come to the Riff country.</p>
<p>He was certainly attracted; and, according to Miriam,
listening behind curtains and doors, he had spoken to her father
about her.</p>
<p>Would he demand her hand in marriage, or would he just . .
.</p>
<p>The Kaid el Hadj el Aleman. . . . Why was Hassan the Pedlar so
interested in him, so anxious to see him, to prostrate himself
before him, and pay his respects?</p>
<p>Business, no doubt. A man in El Hadj's position could put a
lot of trade in Hassan's way; and, of course, make a nice
commission out of Hassan in doing so.</p>
<p>Anyway, there could be no harm in doing as Hassan asked, and
letting him know, without fail, when the Kaid el Hadj el Aleman
came to her father's village again.</p>
<p>How patient these merchants were. He seemed prepared to sit
down there, in his secret camp, almost indefinitely, provided
that he could at length get hold of El Hadj, get audience of him,
and bring off a deal.</p>
<p>What would it be? Jewellery for the ladies of the household of
the Abdel-Krim brothers; horses, camels, food, or clothing for
the <i>hamsain</i>? <sup>1</sup> . . . That would be a nice
useful contract, some supplies or other, for the regular
army.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><sup>1</sup> Regular army.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yes, no wonder he hung about. No wonder he made up to Fat'ma
after she had scoffed at him and told him--a little
prematurely--that El Kaid el Hadj Aleman was a candidate for her
hand.</p>
<p>Well, it was true enough that she had found favour in the
sight of the <i>hadji;</i> and Miriam swore that he had spoken
about her to her father.</p>
<p>That was it--trade. . . .</p>
<p>Well, business is business; and there was no reason why Fat'ma
should not earn the gold coin necklace.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 4</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Odo Klemens, El Hadj Aleman, dismounted from his horse and
handed the rein to the obsequious Ali, his body-guard and
confidential slave.</p>
<p>Alone and on foot, he strode ahead of his little retinue and
guard who, off-saddling, settled down to cook a meal, and
rest.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Where was it the minx had said? The mouth of a cave, a few
minutes down the path beyond the village as the moon rose above
the Djebel Zirash.</p>
<p>Damn those village dogs!</p>
<p>Yes, this would be the track. . . . What would 'a few minutes'
be? Half a kilometre?</p>
<p>And how was one to find a cave in that darkness?</p>
<p>Perhaps the moon would shine right into it, when it rose above
the mountain.</p>
<p>Anyway, she would see him, and . . .</p>
<p>Strong arms flung about him from behind, pinioning his own to
his side. Hands of steel at his throat. A sack over his head. His
feet jerked from under him. A stunning blow as he fell. All in a
second or two.</p>
<p><i>Delilah!</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 5</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"No, I am not a traitor and a renegade," replied Odo Klemens
angrily, as he stood between two powerful men, his hands tied
behind his back, and faced his captor, Hassan the Pedlar, who
spoke in perfect French.</p>
<p>"No?"</p>
<p>"No. I was a German and I was a Christian. I changed my
nationality and I changed my religion."</p>
<p>"And the little matter of your oath to serve France faithfully
for five years, in the French Foreign Legion?"</p>
<p>"France herself broke the contract; sent me to prison and . .
."</p>
<p>"Sent you to prison for swindling, robbing and starving your
fellow-soldiers; most of them fellow-Germans."</p>
<p>"France ill-treated me, tortured me, and I left her
service--and became a naturalized Riffian. You have no right . .
."</p>
<p>"Left her service and became a naturalized Riffian! And
suppose, during the Great War, I were in the trenches on the
Western Front, and suddenly found a German bayonet at my throat.
I should be justified in experiencing a sudden change of
heart--and nationality--eh? . . . Suddenly become a patriotic
German, ask for a German uniform--and bayonet . . . and join my
assailant in a charge upon my comrades. Noble, eh?"</p>
<p>Odo Klemens spat.</p>
<p>"Casuistry," said he.</p>
<p>"I quite agree. You are made of it."</p>
<p>"Take him away," he added. "We break camp and ride in an
hour."</p>
<p>Before Odo Klemens turned about, he spoke to his captor
again.</p>
<p>"Where have I seen you before?" he asked suddenly.</p>
<p>"Me? Oh, quite recently," smiled the man who had caught him.
"I'm 'a good soldier. Name of Kreuder.' Kreuder, the 'German
deserter from the Spanish Foreign Legion.' . . . Also 'Hassan the
Pedlar.' . . . Incidentally, too, Colonel Le Sage of the French
Secret Service."</p>

<h1><a name="c303" id="c303"><i>The Life of Odo
Klemens</i></a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 1</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is the true story of the life of a very remarkable man
who was, according to one's point of view, a brilliantly clever
and most courageous Soldier of Fortune, or a shameful and
disgusting traitor.</p>
<p>The French authorities not unnaturally regarded him as the
latter. To many of his comrades, especially his compatriots, he
was a hero to envy and to emulate. To others, he was a dog for
whom shooting was far too good a death.</p>
<p>It was to men whom protracted monotony, hardship, misery and
privation were driving to desperation and madness that the
conduct and fortune of Odo Klemens appealed. Men, in short, who
were threatened with, or actually suffering from, <i>le
cafard.</i> If he could desert, not only successfully but
extremely profitably, why could not they desert with, at any
rate, some hope of reaching safety?</p>
<p>These poor fellows, temporarily unhinged, and far more to be
pitied than despised, were apt to forget how nearly impossible
successful desertion is, or was for them; how utterly hopeless
were the conditions under which the attempt must be made, with
hundreds, if not thousands, of kilometres to march before
reaching the place of refuge; the almost insurmountable
difficulty of crossing the terrible mountain ranges, with their
frozen passes, their burning valleys; the almost complete absence
of food and water; the fact that their uniforms would, a hundred
times, make them targets for tribesmen's rifles.</p>
<p>It is not when men are marching and fighting that this spirit
arises and spreads; not when the active service is really active
that this desert madness of <i>le cafard</i> smites them. It is
when they are suffering the treble strain of the heaviest manual
labour, the minimum of sleep, and an unbroken monotony of danger
and unrelieved hardship--which includes bad and insufficient
rations and water.</p>
<p>It is then that all sense of proportion is lost, together with
sanity and all sense of decency and self-respect; then that good
soldiers fall gradual victims to the temptation and example of
men like Odo Klemens.</p>
<p>Especially so, when the tempter follows the villainous
practice of approaching small and lonely <i>postes</i> at
nighttime and, calling to the sentries, urges them to drop down
over the wall; urges them to join him and exchange a life of
slavery for one of freedom, luxury and power; of wine, money,
women, rank, honour and all that the heart of man could
desire--merely by going and joining him, the future Kaid of the
Atlas, if not Sultan of Morocco.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 2</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Odo or Hermann Klemens was, according to his especial comrade,
Schlatz, and the evidence produced at his court-martial, a
German, born at Dusseldorf, and, by now, about forty-five years
of age.</p>
<p>The son of a quite successful tradesman of that town, he might
have lived in peace, comfort, and prosperity all his days; or, at
any rate, up to the Great War. Apparently, however, he had too
little to do, and too much money on which to do it; and became a
man about town.</p>
<p>When the town is Dusseldorf, this may not mean anything
particularly fierce; but Odo Klemens fell in love with a
music-hall dancer from Paris; and when she finished her
engagement in Germany and returned to France, Klemens accompanied
her.</p>
<p>So did a quite considerable portion of his father's
bank-balance, which he had obtained by forging his father's
name.</p>
<p>Odo Klemens now became a man about town, in Paris, quite a
different rôle from that of such a man in Dusseldorf. Before
long, his money was gone, and promptly the lady followed it, with
an equal finality and completeness.</p>
<p>To avoid the rigours of the Paris winter, he made for the
Riviera, got as far as Marseilles, and there lived by his wits
until he got a job of some kind on a ship going to
Constantinople.</p>
<p>After knocking about in the Turkish capital for a time, he
went on tramp and made his way to Persia. He settled in Teheran
and, using his undoubted ability, good education, and his
knowledge of French and German, succeeded to such effect that he
was taken into partnership by a Teheran merchant, and quite
quickly amassed, doubtless in curious ways, a sum of money which,
if not a fortune, was enough to bring him back in comfort to
Europe.</p>
<p>By his own account, as related to his comrade Schlatz, whom he
had no reason to deceive, he lost the whole of this capital at
the Monte Carlo roulette tables, eventually being reduced to such
complete destitution that the Casino paid his fare to Paris,
whither he wished to go.</p>
<p>In Paris, for a time, he again lived by his wits as a tout,
interpreter and guide; and in less creditable capacities.</p>
<p>Obviously he was a man who could stay for long at no place and
in no occupation. For soon, he went on tramp once more, this time
right across France, down the length of Italy, back again and
across the south of France, and from one end of Spain to the
other.</p>
<p>It is a pity that he did not keep a truthful diary, for it
would have been worth reading, and would have shed light on many
dark and curious paths and ways of the under-world of Southern
Europe. The tales he told of his adventures on this odyssey are
equally interesting and amusing, in spite of the fact that they
all redounded to the credit of the skill, cleverness and courage
of Odo Klemens.</p>
<p>In Spain, he undoubtedly earned his living for a time in the
bull-ring, though probably not in the rôle of matador.</p>
<p>At Barcelona he was gored by a bull, and laid up in
hospital.</p>
<p>And here again, in falling, he fell on his feet, as he had so
often done before; for the wife of the German Consul, who was
much given to good works, took great interest in this particular
hospital, and soon discovered that the wounded bull-fighter was a
German.</p>
<p>And here, Klemens had a real chance in life for, on his
recovery, he was invited to the Consulate, was most kindly
treated, not only by this good woman, but by the Consul himself,
and was offered employment in the capacity, and of a kind, for
which he was most eminently fitted--Secret Service.</p>
<p>He was to proceed to Tangier, and put himself at the disposal
of the German Consul who was in immediate need of a brave and
hardy man, clever and competent, who could and would travel about
Morocco from place to place, in some suitable disguise.</p>
<p>From time to time, he would bring or send reports upon people,
tribes, Kaids, routes, oases, places, events, and certain special
subjects of peculiar interest to the German Consul.</p>
<p>This proposition must have sounded ideal to Odo Klemens who,
as soon as he was quite fit, proceeded to Tangier, entered the
employment of the German Consul, and sat him down forthwith to
perfect his knowledge of Arabic, and thoroughly to study the
country of Morocco and its people, their history, religion,
politics and dialects.</p>
<p>By the time his restless spirit was beginning to chafe at his
quiet life of study and physical inaction in Tangier, he was
entirely competent to travel about Morocco in the disguise of a
native merchant, and to keep the German Consul informed of every
move of French, Spanish, Shereefian or Rebel troops; of every
bazaar rumour; of the gossip of market-places, <i>serais,</i>
caravans, oases, soldiers' camp-fires, and military messes; and
generally to be the Consul's eyes and ears.</p>
<p>To understand the position to which Klemens eventually rose
under Abdel-Krim, it must be borne in mind that he carried on his
work as a German spy throughout the length and breadth of
Morocco, in every town and <i>suk</i> and oasis; on every road;
with every tribe; and with every adventurer and rebel of the
Raisuli type, for quite ten years--and he must, by the end of
that time, have known Morocco and the Moroccans as almost no
foreigner had ever done before.</p>
<p>And then, suddenly, he received instant and final dismissal
from the German Secret Service.</p>
<p>Exactly why he was so immediately and ignominiously expelled
from the Service, he never told Schlatz or any other of his
comrades; but, judging by some of his earlier, as well as his
later, actions, it seems more than probable that he was caught in
some such difficult and dubious action as trying to serve two
masters.</p>
<p>Whatever it was, he doubtless had, or discovered, some good
reason and excuse for what he had done; for Klemens would never
admit that he was guilty of treachery or double-dealing.</p>
<p>It is probable that, like many spies, he was a double-spy; a
double-crosser, in fact, acting for two or more countries at
once, and taking money whenever and wherever he could sell
information.</p>
<p>Anyhow, of whatever offence he was convicted, the matter must
have been serious, as he had to flee, literally, for his life,
leaving behind him the savings, pickings and accumulations of
that ten years of deeply interesting, really thrilling, and
thoroughly exciting work as a disguised Secret Service agent.</p>
<p>His most obvious and immediate refuge from the long arm of
German law and the outraged German Consul, was the nearest depôt
of the French Foreign Legion. Thither he fled incontinent;
enlisted, and was safe; and, for the time being at any rate,
declared himself an implacable bitter enemy of Germany and the
Germans, particularly of those in Morocco.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In very many ways Odo Klemens was an ideal recruit for the
French Foreign Legion. He was really tough, really hard,
physically, mentally and morally. He was already inured to
continual imminent danger; to the hardest and poorest of living;
to the longest of marches and the worst of climates, both hot and
cold. Also he knew life and men, both kinds, and backward; knew
his world and his way about it. When Odo Klemens joined the
Foreign Legion, he was already a hard case.</p>
<p>Before long, the recruit Klemens became <i>soldat deuxième
classe;</i> in record time, <i>soldat première classe;</i> and,
very soon after, was promoted Corporal for bravery in battle.</p>
<p>Again Corporal Klemens distinguished himself for courage and
initiative, and was promoted Sergeant on the field. And, being
quick, clever, educated, and able to talk German, French, Spanish
and Moorish like a native, he was appointed Commissariat-Sergeant
of his unit.</p>
<p>Now Commissariat-Sergeant Odo Klemens had not held that rank
and office very long before it became quite obvious that the
men's food was getting poorer and poorer, and Klemens richer and
richer.</p>
<p>A cunning trap was laid for him by his Accounts Department
officer. Klemens was caught red-handed, court-martialled, found
guilty of gross dishonesty and serious theft, sentenced to
imprisonment and reduced to the ranks.</p>
<p>Life in the ranks as a fallen non-commissioned officer suited
Klemens ill. At the first opportunity he deserted, and, escaping,
went straight to the Taza tribe against whom his unit was
fighting. These people, who were old friends of his, received him
with open arms. He accepted the leadership which they offered
him, and sent impudent messages to his late Commandant.</p>
<p>For a time he was content to be Sheikh of this tribe and to
harry the little French outposts of that part of Morocco. He
would go by night and endeavour, sometimes successfully,
sometimes not, to seduce former comrades from their allegiance
and duty. Many sentries he murdered.</p>
<p>On more than one occasion, he entered garrison-town, camp, or
outpost, in uniform, walked about as though the place belonged to
him, spied out the land, obtained information, and departed
undetected and unscathed.</p>
<p>On one occasion, he entered an officer's quarters, stole his
uniform, put it on, and rode away on the officer's horse.</p>
<p>Once, having dressed a party of his tribesmen in French
uniforms stripped from men slain in battle, or from sentries
killed at their posts, he marched them up to an unsuspecting
outpost, and attacked and captured it ere the alarm could be
given and the gate closed.</p>
<p>In a remarkably short space, he became a real danger and a
menace to the outpost line, and something of a thorn in the side
of the French General commanding that zone.</p>
<p>He had only been some months with the Beni Wazain tribe before
his reputation spread throughout the whole country, and a very
important Shereef approached him, urged him to embrace the
Mussulman religion, and gave him the hand of his daughter in
marriage.</p>
<p>He also gave him a commission to fight and harry the French
whenever and wherever he could, and to do everything possible, by
raiding, sniping, cutting off convoys and undermining the
discipline and loyalty of the Foreign Legion and native troops,
to bring about the defeat of the Infidel.</p>
<p>Nor were the ambitions of the Shereef mere pious hopes and
nothing more, his orders and directions but evidence of his
aspirations. He provided Odo Klemens with hordes of fanatical
fighting men; and Klemens provided them with what most they
needed--strong leadership, firm discipline, sound organization,
and modern military strategy and tactics.</p>
<p>It seems that, bitterly as Klemens had hated Germany and the
Germans since his disgrace and dismissal from their Secret
Service, he now hated the French even more. Apparently he deeply
resented their discovery of his defalcations and their infliction
upon him of punishment, imprisonment and possibly worse--for
there are rumours that he suffered the <i>crapaudine</i> torture,
for violent and rebellious conduct while in prison.</p>
<p>Certainly the French had no more dangerous individual enemy at
this time than the new Sheikh and leader of the Beni Wazain
tribe.</p>
<p>It is probable that after his ten years of wandering in
Morocco, living the whole time as a native, Klemens greatly
preferred life in the rôle of an Arab; and it must have seemed to
his friend and patron, the Shereef, to the fighting men the
latter put at his disposal, and to the tribesmen of the Beni
Wazain, that Klemens was no ordinary Roumi--no ordinary Infidel,
if ever he had been one.</p>
<p>Not only did he speak their language perfectly, but he had all
the ways, manners, customs, habits and knowledge of an Arab, and
was indistinguishable from one of themselves, save for the fact
that he was, according to his own account, a Haji, a man who had
acquired merit and religious rank by performing the Haj, the
pilgrimage to Mecca.</p>
<p>This alone gave him a special standing and a claim to
veneration.</p>
<p>It is not known whether Klemens had, in point of fact, visited
Mecca, but, inasmuch as he had been a carpet-merchant in Persia,
it is quite possible that he had successfully ventured with his
Teheran partner as far as the Holy City.</p>
<p>And yet, just when his fame was great, his position strong,
and his popularity enormous, owing to his successful raids on the
French <i>postes,</i> and to his great personal courage, his
marked ability and gifts for guerrilla warfare, he fell from
grace.</p>
<p>The position of any foreigner among fanatical tribesmen,
changeful and suspicious, is apt to be precarious; but one
suspects that there was some good reason for the fact that
'misfortune' once again overtook Odo Klemens.</p>
<p>At any rate, he was suddenly accused of being a traitor and a
spy, and was flung into a <i>silo</i> or pit, to die of
starvation.</p>
<p>And once again Fate intervened to save this remarkable man
from what was apparently certain death.</p>
<p>A wealthy and influential tribesman, whose interests Klemens
had served, rescued him by night, spirited him away, and kept him
in his household, disguised in the rôle of a slave.</p>
<p>From this man's tents, Klemens escaped, and made his way to a
distant tribe to whom also he was known, and who appeared to have
heard nothing of his recent downfall. Them also he led against
the nearest French <i>postes,</i> attained prominence and rank,
again married the Sheikh's daughter, and was in a fair way to
succeed his father-in-law as ruler of the tribe.</p>
<p>Before this occurred, however, all men had begun to talk of
the new hope of Morocco, the new Mahdi who was going to throw off
the foreign yoke and drive every invader from the sacred soil of
Moghreb--Abdel-Krim, the Kaid of the Atlas, who was not only
defying, but defeating, French and Spanish troops, on equal terms
and in open battle.</p>
<p>As usual, Odo Klemens was beginning to find the present task
boring and monotonous; beginning to yearn for fresh fields and
pastures new, a wider life and a bigger stage.</p>
<p>Also there was a woman in the case, once again; a woman in
that part of the country, whom he had seen and long
remembered.</p>
<p>So one day he rode off, leaving his adopted tribe, his lawful
wife, and his son and heir, behind him.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"<i>Leave thy father, leave thy mother<br>
And thy brother;<br>
Leave the black tents of thy Tribe apart!<br>
Am I not thy father and thy brother,<br>
Thy mother?<br>
And thou--what needest with thy Tribe's black tents<br>
Who hast the red pavilion of my heart?</i>"</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>And in the end, this woman played the part of Delilah and was
the cause of his capture, downfall, and ruin.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 3</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Odo Klemens, Abdel-Krim saw not only a man after his own
heart, but one of the very type that he most needed--an
experienced soldier versed in the latest arts of modern warfare;
a man of the highest courage and greatest initiative; a bitter
enemy of the French; a born leader of men; and one whose only
hope was in the success of Abdel-Krim.</p>
<p>First of all he was appointed <i>Kaid-el-Hamsain,</i> or
Colonel of Riff Regulars, and given command of an expedition
which Abdel-Krim was planning to launch suddenly against the
Spaniards.</p>
<p>This was entirely successful, and Odo Klemens was rewarded
with the permanent rank of Kaid; a suitable house at Adjir; the
hand of one of Abdel-Krim's relatives; horses, flocks and
herds.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Odo Klemens now settled down to hard work as
Instructor-General of the Riffian Army, and employed what spare
time he had in map-making, military photography, and the
organizing of artillery and bomb-throwing schools.</p>
<p>Intentionally or not, Klemens so inspired his followers that
he became a legend in his lifetime, known throughout Morocco as
<i>El Hadj Aleman,</i> the German Haji. By all priests and people
he was accepted as not merely a good Mahommedan, but definitely
as a Holy Man who, unlike his less fortunate or less pious
followers, had made the Pilgrimage to Mecca, and established for
all time his claim to special sanctity.</p>
<p>Not only this, but in war, if not in peace, he outdid the
Riffs themselves in ferocity, making himself, to these wild
mountaineers, what Hereward the Wake was to the Saxons, William
Wallace and Robert Bruce to the Scots.</p>
<p>Upon the minds of the French soldiery, too, he made a deep
impression, as it was his habit, when cutting off a convoy,
annihilating a small detachment, capturing a <i>poste,</i> or
even slaying a sentry, to 'leave his card.' To the breast of one
of the dead he would attach a piece of paper bearing the words
'<i>El Hadj Aleman.</i>'</p>
<p>It is little cause for wonder that his capture was earnestly
desired by the French authorities, and that there was a price
upon his head.</p>
<p>Whether regarded as a shameful renegade from Christianity,
from European civilization and from his German nationality and
his adopted French allegiance, or not, he was undeniably a most
romantic figure, a very brave man indeed, leading a life
incredible in its difference from that to which he had been born,
and from that prevailing a few miles away across the Straits of
Gibraltar.</p>
<p>He had gone back three or four centuries.</p>
<p>From time to time, a representative of some European power or
newspaper would make his perilous way to Abdel-Krim's
headquarters, and would there encounter his Chief of Staff, his
Quartermaster-General, his Commander-in-Chief, his
Instructor-in-Chief, <i>El Hadj Aleman,</i> late Sergeant Odo
Klemens of the French Foreign Legion.</p>
<p>To these people Klemens would show hospitality--provided there
were no reason to suppose they were French or German or Spanish
emissaries--expatiate upon the wrongs suffered by Abdel-Krim and
the Riffians at the hands of France and Spain, and explain
himself.</p>
<p>He was not a renegade Christian.</p>
<p>He was a convinced Mussulman, a Mahommedan, a True
Believer.</p>
<p>Christianity he had renounced and abjured, as he had a perfect
right to do. Mahommedanism he had embraced as the only religion
worthy of a man and a warrior.</p>
<p>He was not a renegade German.</p>
<p>He was a naturalized Riffian; and surely there was no more
disgrace in a German becoming a naturalized Riffian than in a
German becoming a naturalized American?</p>
<p>He was not a deserter from the French Army, treacherously
fighting against his own side.</p>
<p>He had served the French well, and they had served him badly;
and so he had terminated his contract and left their service. Had
not every man a perfect right to do this, if he had the will, the
courage and the power? When he had joined the French Foreign
Legion he had joined as a German and a Christian. When he had
ceased to be either, he had ceased to be the man who had
enlisted.</p>
<p>What would be really wrong would be for him, a Mahommedan and
a Riffian, to serve in the Christian European army which was
fighting against his religion and his nation.</p>
<p>"So utterly have I renounced the Christian religion, German
nationality, and French allegiance, that I have taken Riffian
wives. My sons are Riffians; and I will never leave the country
of the Riff. Allah is my God, Mahommet is my salvation; the Atlas
country is my home, and the Riffian people are my nation," said
he.</p>
<p>"'What will happen to me if Abdel-Krim is conquered and
captured?' . . . That will never come to pass; but should it do
so, I shall be in precisely the same position as any other
Riffian Kaid. . . . Why not, since I am a naturalized
Riffian?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 4</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But here Odo Klemens was mistaken. Abdel-Krim was defeated,
captured and exiled. Odo Klemens was taken in an ambush laid for
him near Tamzount by a French officer of the Secret Service.</p>
<p>Treated as a deserter, and marched with manacled hands to
Taza, he was sent to Mekinez to be tried by General
Court-martial.</p>
<p>Here he stoutly defended himself, after denying that he was
subject to the jurisdiction of the Court.</p>
<p>His defence was that he was not a Frenchman; and that, after
leaving the French service, he had renounced his German
nationality, embraced Islam, and become a naturalized Moor of the
Riff.</p>
<p>As was his duty, he had fought for his adopted country, and
had fought honourably against her enemies, whether Spanish,
French or Moorish; for Abdel-Krim's hand had been against that of
the Sultan, and against that of the great Shereefian rebel
Raisuli.</p>
<p>Far from being a renegade deserter, he was not even a soldier
of fortune. He was a patriotic son of his country, and had but
defended her sacred soil. . . .</p>
<p>The Court-martial, however, took a different view, and
sentenced Odo Klemens to death.</p>
<p>On revision, the severity of this sentence was increased and
he was sentenced to eight years in a Penal Battalion.</p>

<p align="center">§ 1</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"That is a dreadful noise," observed Tant de Soif, as we
entered our <i>chambrée.</i> I had to agree, for it was a rather
dreadful noise.</p>
<p>"Ah, as I thought. It emanates from the interior of the aged
intolerable man they call Père Poussin," continued Tant de
Soif.</p>
<p>"Is he in pain, or is he what he would call singing? . . .</p>
<p>"Yes, he is, in effect, 'singing.'"</p>
<p>Turning upon us unabashed, the aged Père Poussin, who was
probably fifty-five or so, yet higher lifted up his voice.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"<i>Elle s'a cassé sa jambe de bois<br>
Sa jambe de bois<br>
En montant d'ssus les ch'vaux d'bois<br>
Sa jambe,<br>
Sa jambe de bois!</i>"</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-indent: 0em;">he sang.</p>
<p>"Peace, my child," requested Tant de Soif, politely and with
restraint.</p>
<p>Making a grimace and gesture unworthy of his years and
station, Père Poussin executed a not inelegant <i>pas seul,</i>
and increased the volume, if not the acceptability, of his
song.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"<i>Mariez-vous donc! Mariez-vous donc!<br>
C'est si gentil, c'est si bon!<br>
Pourquoi rester, mon garçon?<br>
Allons . . .<br>
Mariez-vous donc, garçon!</i>"</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-indent: 0em;">he chanted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof," said Tant de
Soif, "and that, I think, will be quite sufficient."</p>
<p>Unwarned and undaunted, Père Poussin sang on.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"<i>Pour le repos, le plaisir du militaire, Il est
là-bas, à deux pas de la fôret, Une maison aux murs tout couverts
de lierre.</i> 'AUX TOURLOUROUS' <i>c'est le nom du
cabaret</i>."</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>"Had I a cartridge, my dear Père Poussin, I would put it to a
splendid use, and again earn and deserve, if not receive, the
gratitude of mankind. Both as a philanthropist and a man of
musical taste, I would use it to shoot you. But yes, even though
I were surrounded by a million howling foemen, and it were the
last cartridge in the world."</p>
<p>At these words, the grey-bearded Père Poussin dropped upon a
bench, flung his arms upon the table and buried his face in
them.</p>
<p>"There, there," muttered Tant de Soif, evidently much
concerned. And quietly, to me, "One mustn't use the phrase
'<i>the last cartridge</i>' in front of <i>ce pauvre</i>
Poussin."</p>
<p>Tant de Soif said this, not only with obvious concern, but as
though I had been guilty of the alleged indiscretion.</p>
<p>Crossing over to where his <i>copain</i> sprawled, apparently
sobbing, Tant de Soif patted his back gently, and talked to him
as might a mother to a distressed unhappy child.</p>
<p>"There, there, there, <i>mon brave,</i>" he soothed, "don't
take on. There, there. No one would say a word to bring it all
back, upset you, disturb you. . . . Hush now. And we'll have a
litre."</p>
<p>He glanced at me and raised his eyebrows. I nodded
acquiescence.</p>
<p>"A litre, at the very least," continued Tant de Soif, stroking
the grey head that lay bowed upon the table. "Come on, my Spring
Chicken."</p>
<p>"He was such a brave boy, such a fine lad," sobbed Père
Poussin, making me feel most uncomfortable, for he literally did
sob, with the frank and complete abandon of the Latin of his
class.</p>
<p>"He was; he was," agreed Tant de Soif, his gnarled hand gently
shaking his comrade's shoulder. "He'd have been an
<i>adjudant.</i> An <i>adjudant,</i> do I say? An Officer, if he
had . . . lived."</p>
<p>Père Poussin raised a tear-stained face and wiped parts of it
with his cuff.</p>
<p>"Why don't you say '<i>if he hadn't been murdered</i>,'"
sniffed Père Poussin.</p>
<p>"Because I'm not a damned old fool like you," roared Tant de
Soif, giving the venerable head before him a quite useful clout.
"Because it would be a cursed silly lie, and I, unlike yourself,
am not a silly old liar. . . . Get dressed and come and get
drunk, or as drunk as you have the capacity to get."</p>
<p>Père Poussin rose to his feet.</p>
<p>After all, wine is wine.</p>
<p>"It was terrible, you know," whispered Tant de Soif to me, as
Père Poussin went to the shelf whereon his uniforms were folded
<i>en paquetage. "</i>Shot . . ."</p>
<p>"His friend?" said I. "Poor chap! A gun-accident?"</p>
<p>"But no. <i>Au contraire</i>."</p>
<p>"What, shot on purpose?"</p>
<p>"Shot deliberately."</p>
<p>"Murder?"</p>
<p>"Battle, murder and sudden death. . . . Battle and sudden
death certainly. . . . Sudden death after battle, anyhow. . . .
He'll tell you."</p>
<p>For some reason, perhaps because of Tant de Soifs somewhat
mysterious manner, I thought of a firing-party at dawn, a
blindfolded figure bound to a stake, the signalling fall of an
officer's sword, a volley. . . .</p>
<p>"I shouldn't care to ask him," I said.</p>
<p>"He'll tell you when he's had a bottle of <i>pinard.</i> It
was my original prescription, and it has become routine. When
anything brings it all up again like this, I give him all the
wine I can possibly raise, and make him tell the story to someone
who's never heard it; make him get it all up; get it out. . . .
Works like a charm. . . . In the early days I thought he was
going as mad as La Cigale, but my prescription did the trick,
saved him, body and soul and mind. And now, instead of being as
mad as La Cigale, he's as sane as you or I."</p>
<p>Tant de Soif turned upon me with sudden swiftness.</p>
<p>"He is as sane as you or I, isn't he?" he asked insistently,
truculently.</p>
<p>"Obviously," I replied. "Probably a good deal saner than
I."</p>
<p>Tant de Soif gripped, and shook my wrist, causing my hand to
waggle in a foolish manner.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 2</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The canteen was quiet that night, being Friday and all pay
spent the night before.</p>
<p>Père Poussin was not drunk.</p>
<p>How can a man be said to be drunk when his articulation is
perfect, his speech coherent, his selection of the <i>mot
juste</i> unerring, his memory unfailing, his replies
unhesitating and accurate?</p>
<p>Of course Poussin was not drunk that evening, even if I did
carry him from canteen to <i>chambrée</i> and Tant de Soif did
put him to bed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Did you ever hear of the affair at Ain Zeb, <i>mon ami?</i>"
Père Poussin asked me, as he raised his fourth bumper, first to
me, and then to his lips.</p>
<p>"No," he continued, with some bitterness in his voice. "Who
has? Who remembers; who knows; who cares?"</p>
<p>"What was the affair at Ain Zeb?"</p>
<p>"Nothing, nothing. Only an 'affair of outposts'--or rather, of
patrols. Only an affair of an inexperienced young Officer, a
sergeant-major who hadn't the guts to stand up to him, contradict
him, and protest; and of a couple of score of fine
<i>légionnaires</i> thrown away, massacred, butchered . . . all
but one. Forty--of whom I'm the sole survivor. . . . Oh yes,
that's all the affair at Ain Zeb was.</p>
<p>"And who do you think was the last survivor with me . . . the
thirty-ninth . . . the last to die, that is to say?" he
continued. "It was a boy . . . a mere child . . . Adolphe, young
Adolphe, <i>le petit</i> Adolphe.</p>
<p>"And how old do you think he was? Well, I'll tell you how old
he wasn't. He wasn't seventeen, and he died with his boots on . .
. in the uniform of the Legion."</p>
<p>"Magnificent," I murmured, as Père Poussin addressed himself
more particularly to me.</p>
<p>"Ah, and he was magnificent. And white, mind you. White as you
or I: and French to the last drop of his blood. Born in France,
of a good French girl. Her father worked in the O'Brien
<sup>1</sup> vineyards.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><sup>1</sup> <i>Haut-Brion?</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>"But was he going to labour in the vineyard? His father's son?
. . . In the vineyard of Empire, if you like. . . . On his
sixteenth birthday, he started off, tramped to Marseilles, went
to the <i>Bureau de Recrutement,</i> said he was a run-away
Belgian, nineteen years of age, and enlisted in the Legion.</p>
<p>"Rolled up at Sidi bel Abbès, grinning and wagging his tail,
and asking where his father was. I tell you, <i>notre brave</i>
Rollet was pleased. He roared with laughter when, inspecting
recruits, they pointed the boy out to him and told him who he
was.</p>
<p>"He clapped the youngster on the back with his own hand.</p>
<p>"'<i>Mon Dieu</i>,' he swore, 'that's the style. Why can't
each of my rascals beget a young rascal like himself, and bring
him to the Legion? That's how the Romans did it in their Third
African Legion.'</p>
<p>"Yes, Rollet himself spoke to the boy, and saw that when he
had finished his recruit-training, he was sent out to our
Company. He's a man, is our Rollet.</p>
<p>"And yet, if he hadn't taken an interest in him himself, and
seen to it that he joined his father (a damned old
<i>vaurien</i>) the boy might have been alive to-day."</p>
<p>Père Poussin stopped, and his old--or old-looking--face
twitched.</p>
<p>What could one say? This was real grief.</p>
<p>"<i>Courage, mon brave</i>," cried Tant de Soif. "He died, as
he'd have wished to die, in the uniform that his father and
grandfather and great-grandfather wore. . . . He died . . . er .
. ."</p>
<p>Tant de Soif, too, stopped.</p>
<p>"He died gloriously, a soldier's death, in battle," said I
indiscreetly, unmindful of Tant de Soifs mysterious-seeming hints
of an hour before, in the <i>chambrée</i>.</p>
<p>Père Poussin raised his eyes to mine.</p>
<p>"He died," he said, "in the uniform he loved, and had always
longed to wear, at Ain Zeb.</p>
<p>"As I told you.</p>
<p>"The thirty-ninth <i>légionnaire</i> to die.</p>
<p>"I was the fortieth--and lived.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Young Lieutenant de Ménard would halt just there and nowhere
else. Even we, tired as we were, grumbled that the site was
undefendable. No water. Commanded from every side by
<i>collines,</i> by higher ground, rocks, sand-dunes."</p>
<p>"If I'd been there, I'd have marched up to de Ménard and told
him so," interrupted Tant de Soif, pot-valiant.</p>
<p>"Well, luckily you were in more suitable company--with the
mules," replied Père Poussin, with asperity, "or doubtless you'd
have done wonders."</p>
<p>"A snug enough place, I grant you," he resumed, "for a Section
with plenty of water, and moving in safe and settled country. But
we had only what was in our water-bottles, both for drinking and
for cooking, and we were in the <i>zone dissidente,</i> and
actually on our way to strengthen a <i>poste</i> around which
Sheikh Sidi Omar bin Marbrouk himself was raiding with a few
thousand of the best. Worse than the Touareg, Ouled Sidi Sheikhs,
or the Chambaa themselves, they were."</p>
<p>"Why wasn't there any water there if it was called Ain
<sup>1</sup> Zeb?" asked Tant de Soif, to show his close interest
in the story which he must have heard a hundred times before.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><sup>1</sup> <i>Ain</i> = fountain, well, spring.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Because it was dried up, my good camel; or gone underground;
or because a well there had been buried and concealed by the
Arabs; or because there was a perfectly good oasis--a kilometre
away--and our clever young de Ménard couldn't read his map; or
hadn't got a map; or was too tired to go any farther; or didn't
give a damn; or decided that we had sufficient water for the
night--which we had--and that he'd better reconnoitre the oasis
at dawn, and catch the Arabs who were camping there, as they
probably would be.</p>
<p>"How do we know what's in an Officer's mind--always assuming
that there's anything in it at all?</p>
<p>"Anyhow, there it was. Young de Ménard must camp there and
nowhere else, down in this snug depression where wandering
scouts, raiding-parties, or <i>harkas</i> would never see us
unless they chanced upon us--which would be like a man chancing
on a needle in a hay-stack--in this snug, but large, shallow
depression commanded on all sides by higher ground, sand-dunes,
rocks, where, if we were caught, we should be caught like rats in
a trap.</p>
<p>"Why, when we got '<i>Sacs à terre</i>' and '<i>Aux
murailles</i>,' even old Zarinieff, who, as you know, hadn't too
much intelligence, was soldier enough to remark to me:</p>
<p>"'But Name of a Name of a Name of a Billion Bounding Blue
Baboons! Surely the good God has already made the
<i>murailles.</i> We are already within a perimeter-camp . . .
rather a large one, I admit, but it would be better to man the
natural walls of this crater than to build our own walls in the
middle of it'--or words to that effect.</p>
<p>"Even the poor Tant de Soif here would have seen that it was
rather like making a tea-cup inside a saucer and defending that
instead of defending the saucer itself. . . . But I am wandering
from the point. . . ."</p>
<p>"You are indeed wandering in your mind, <i>mon pauvre</i>
Poussin," agreed Tant de Soif. "However, there isn't much room to
wander there, so you will not get lost."</p>
<p>Père Poussin ignored the remark.</p>
<p>"Well, we couldn't build any walls, because there was nothing
but sand. So we scratched a square of shallow trenches, and
willingly obeyed the order for each man to contribute a quarter
of his water to the cooking-pot, and drink the rest. . . . Of
course, de Ménard must have been absolutely certain that we were
close to an oasis, and would be there next day. . . . Or that, in
any case, the Mounted Infantry Company would overtake us, and
they had spare water<i>-fantasses</i> on their mules. . . .
<i>I</i> don't know. . . . Legion officers generally have a good
reason for what they do--unless they've got <i>cafard.</i></p>
<p>"Well, I was for guard that night, and worked it so that my
turn of sentry-duty coincided with young Adolphe's, and that he
and I were next to each other, and met at the end of our
respective beats.</p>
<p>"And, of course, we stopped a while and talked, each time, for
I loved young Adolphe better than anything else in the whole
world . . . better even than myself and my life . . . better even
than the miserable and drunken old Tant de Soif with whom it's
been my misfortune to soldier for forty years--from Dahomey to
Tonkin and from Madagascar to Algeria."</p>
<p>Tant de Soif patted Père Poussin on the back and drank some of
the speaker's wine, as the hand of the latter abandoned its
clutch upon his glass while, with his cuff, he frankly and
unashamedly wiped away the tears that streamed from his eyes.</p>
<p>"Think of it, <i>mes amis,</i> a boy not only through his
recruit-drill and depôt-training, but out on active service
before he was seventeen! . . . Marching with the best of us;
spoiling for a fight; merry all the time; and not only suffering
every hardship cheerfully, but frequently remarking that, with
luck, he might see fifty years of service. . . .</p>
<p>"Yes, we stood and talked . . . and I gave him what I could of
such soldier-knowledge and wisdom as I had gathered in forty
years of service. <i>Le pauvre brave</i> Adolphe. . . ."</p>
<p>And under the influence of wine and emotion, Père Poussin
again broke down and sobbed, while Tant de Soif did his best to
comfort him with loving-kindness, foul oaths, and quite
considerable punches in the ribs and smacks upon the head.</p>
<p>"There, there," he said, "it's all over long ago and the boy's
happy. Shut up, you doddering dotard, or I'll so disperse you
that you'll be good for nothing but autopsy by the Butcher. . . .
There, there, <i>mon brave,</i> drink up and tell us the rest of
the story, for you are cleverer at it and more interesting than
any professional story-teller of the Bazaar. Come on, now, you
damned old fool, or I'll have your gizzard for a
tobacco-pouch."</p>
<p>"Sixteen years of age," continued Père Poussin, "as good a man
as any of us, and better than most. Doing his forty to fifty
kilometres a day, without a whine or a snivel, a groan or a
curse. . . .</p>
<p>"Yes, we talked there in the starlight, and I can remember
every little word he said, for it was the last time. It was the
last time that I and Adolphe talked together . . . the last
time."</p>
<p>"On this earth, <i>mon brave</i>," interrupted Tant de Soif.
"<i>Le grand Général le bon Dieu</i> will see to it that you and
Adolphe meet at the Last Muster, and talk to your heart's content
in the <i>chambrée</i> of the good soldier's Heaven. Of course He
will. And don't contradict me, you drunken dodderer, or I'll
punch you on the nose--a thing one could not miss in the
dark."</p>
<p>"But though we talked, was young Adolphe neglectful of his
duty? Not he. It was Adolphe who saw the Arabs first. And I tell
you, <i>mes amis,</i> that boy fired his rifle, and bawled
'<i>Aux armes</i>' right in the middle of a sentence. He just
caught his gun up from '<i>Stand at ease</i>' and fired it
without stopping to bring it up to his shoulder, and shouted the
alarm as he did so. Right in the middle of what he was saying. .
. . There's soldierly promptitude for you. . . .</p>
<p>"But, as it turned out, it might have been better if he hadn't
been so watchful and so smart. The Arabs would have caught us
napping, and the agony would not have been prolonged. . . . And I
should not be alive to-day, a drunken disgrace to the finest
Regiment God ever made."</p>
<p>"Oh?" ejaculated Tant de Soif, bestowing a heavy thump upon
his <i>copain. "</i>So I go about with 'a drunken disgrace to the
Regiment,' do I?"</p>
<p>"No," replied Père Poussin. "<i>I</i> do that.</p>
<p>"Almost before the words were out of the boy's mouth," he
resumed, "I had my rifle up, too, and in a couple of seconds from
his sighting the crawling assassins we were shooting to kill. And
before their rush was fairly started, the walls were manned, and
the N.C.O.s giving orders for salvo fire.</p>
<p>"The Legion is not often caught napping and, thanks to
Adolphe, it wasn't caught then. I wish it had been. We should
have died just the same, and died quicker. But what am I saying?
Of course, we shouldn't have died quicker. The tortures! . . .
The tortures! . . . Why, I've seen a skewer on which were a
<i>légionnaire's</i> eyes, nose, lips, ears, fingers, toes and .
. ."</p>
<p>"That's enough," growled Tant de Soif.</p>
<p>". . . and the poor devil still alive."</p>
<p>Père Poussin fell silent.</p>
<p>"No," he continued, "it was better so. Adolphe's warning was
in time, and the men died like men, fighting to the last. Back to
back, and their faces to the foe, against odds of ten to one . .
."</p>
<p>Père Poussin's words reminded me of</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"<i>The Scottish spearmen still made good<br>
Their dark impenetrable wood;<br>
Each man stepping where his comrade stood,<br>
The instant that he fell</i>."</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>". . . died like men of the Legion, that never retreats and
never surrenders . . . died fighting for <i>Honneur et Fidélité .
. .</i> killing, until killed by, the enemies of France.</p>
<p>". . . All but me--and one other. . . . One other. . . . Young
Adolphe. He was not killed by an enemy of France."</p>
<p>"Get on with it, now," growled Tant de Soif.</p>
<p>"Well, the Arabs settled down to do the thing in style--five
or six hundred of them to the forty of us--and the fight lasted
all day. The whole of a waterless day, thanks to young de
Ménard's cock-sure cleverness.</p>
<p>"I'm not blaming the boy really. He died like a man, like an
Officer of the Legion, after displaying the utmost courage,
coolness and skill.</p>
<p>"He didn't exactly apologize to us for landing us in that
death-trap, and without any water; but he said the right words,
and called us all the things we liked to be called; and found
time, as he went round, to clap each man on the shoulder and
swear at him.</p>
<p>"He was a good lad, de Ménard, and he set a fine example.</p>
<p>"I suppose he didn't want to live, once he realized what he
had done--but we wanted to. . . . Anyhow, I did--with young
Adolphe there.</p>
<p>"Yes, all day it lasted, and most of us would have died of the
heat and thirst if the Arabs hadn't killed us. . . . A natural
oven, without water, and, as everyone knows, there's nothing like
the excitement of fighting for turning your tongue into
glue-coated leather, and your lips into cracked charcoal.</p>
<p>"And the Arabs had got us sitting. They'd only got to keep a
hundred or so continuously shooting at us, from cover, at short
range, while the rest played cards, had a manicure, got a shampoo
and shave, powdered their noses, took an <i>apéritif,</i> or went
to the pictures, until it was their turn for the <i>tir aux
pigeons</i>--sport without danger.</p>
<p>"And they didn't spare ammunition either, thinking, no doubt,
they'd get ours. But that was what de Ménard didn't intend them
to do.</p>
<p>"'Shoot just as often as you see something to shoot at, <i>mes
enfants</i>,' said he, 'and don't miss. . . . They're bound to
get us--let 'em get us with our pouches empty.'</p>
<p>"Every now and then, a few of the more courageous and
enterprising, or more impatient, would get up a charge and try to
ride over us, break us up and scatter us. But de Ménard saw to
that all right--although he'd been shot through the chest.</p>
<p>"Towards evening, after he had been hit again, in the mouth,
and could talk no more, he carried on just as well with his
whistle, although he blew blood through it, as well as through
the hole in his chest.</p>
<p>"He got around, too, probably doing that foolish thing,
looking for the bullet that would finish him.</p>
<p>"Surely even a youngster like that knows that the only time
you are really safe is when you want to die. It's just the
cussedness of things. If the <i>vaguemestre</i> gives you a
letter saying that your aunt has gone to Heaven and left you ten
thousand francs, you'll stop a bullet that same day--fired a mile
away, at somebody else. But whoever got a bullet when he wanted
one? Not young de Ménard, anyhow. He died slowly, from loss of
blood, and his last croak was a joke that made us laugh.</p>
<p>"Sergeant-Major Brasche--whose fault it really was that we
were in that trap, because he ought to have prevailed on young de
Ménard to choose a better site for the camp--crocked up and went
mad. I said he was a bit of a weakling, didn't I? Oh, he was
brave enough, and a very good non-com., but when it came to the
pinch, he lacked just one thing--guts.</p>
<p>"And, mind you, guts isn't the same thing as courage. Courage
shows in a fight or a charge, for example. Guts shows towards the
end of a long march, when you're a walking agony, and if you
stopped you'd fall down, and nothing on earth would get you up
again. . . . Or towards the end of a long day of being shot at,
front, rear, and both flanks.</p>
<p>"So Sergeant-Major Brasche's courage got the better of his
guts--we'll put it like that, for he was a good soldier. And,
just before sunset, he jumped to his feet, fixed his bayonet, and
did a charge all by himself.</p>
<p>"Curiously enough, he got there, too, though <i>le bon
Dieu</i> alone knows how many times he got chipped on the way.
Reached the nearest group of them, got his bayonet into his man,
and died happy.</p>
<p>"We helped him all we could, of course, but they were all
round him, like flies on a spot of honey--or blood.</p>
<p>"Sergeant Risskoff got a nasty one, right across the front of
his stomach, and that bullet acted just precisely as a butcher's
knife does across the throat of a sheep. Now he had got
guts--even after he'd lost 'em--for he rolled over on his back,
folded his hands across his front as though to hold himself
together--and died for hours, without a sound.</p>
<p>"Charmantelle--you remember Sergeant Charmantelle . . . been a
Dragoon officer before he joined the Legion . . . huge great big
chap--got one sideways, too. Took out all his front teeth. That
was funny because he'd always been so proud of 'em. You remember
the old joke about him, eh, <i>mon ami</i>?"</p>
<p>"Yes," replied Tant de Soif, and quoted, "'There's lots of
good things about Charmantelle--thirty-six good teeth.'"</p>
<p>"Well, that's about all the good there was to Charmantelle,
but one has to admit that he died well. The last thing he
said--and it must have cost him some effort to speak at
all--was,</p>
<p>"'Well, I shan't be able to eat for a long time, but I can
still drink, thank God.'</p>
<p>"Schleydel died noisily, moaning and groaning and bawling
something or other in German. But, in fairness, one has to admit
that he was probably quite unconscious. For he'd got a bullet
clean through the head, just above the ears.</p>
<p>"Matalones got one in the head, too, through the left eye, and
he ran round and round in a circle until he got another.</p>
<p>"Every time I heard a bullet strike a man, I glanced at young
Adolphe who was lying next to me, a few feet away on my right,
firing as coolly and steadily as if we were on the
rifle-range.</p>
<p>"Once he crawled over to Guajiros who was lying with his face
buried in the sand and his bare head and neck exposed to the sun.
A bullet had taken his <i>képi</i> off, after he had sunk down,
shot in the neck.</p>
<p>"Adolphe put the <i>képi</i> back on his head, and turned him
over, so that he could breathe; then took Guajiros' ammunition
and crawled back to his place.</p>
<p>"Towards evening, ammunition became a problem, of course.
Corporal Gueldre started a round of all the dead and wounded--too
badly wounded to be able to shoot, I mean--collecting their
ammunition. And when he was hit, Corporal Djoolte, another damned
good Dutchman, carried on and distributed it among us.</p>
<p>"'Got any ideas, old soldier?' he croaked to me, as he crawled
to where I lay. 'What about a smack at them with Rosalie
<sup>1</sup>?'</p>
<p> </p>
<p><sup>1</sup> Bayonet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"'What's the good of running about in the sun, Corporal?' I
asked. 'How can we get through them on foot? And where'd we go,
if we could? More comfortable here.'</p>
<p>"'Quite right. Just what I think,' agreed Corporal Djoolte.
'It's just possible we may stand them off till they get tired of
it.'</p>
<p>"After he'd been round, Djoolte, now in command, signalled the
<i>Cease Fire,</i> and gave orders that there was to be no more
shooting until the Arabs charged.</p>
<p>"That was all very well, but they didn't charge. They simply
wriggled and crept and crawled a little nearer, and a little
nearer, while keeping up as hot a fire as ever. Before long,
Djoolte, in the centre, raised his head to give another order,
and got a bullet between the eyes.</p>
<p>"Then someone's nerve gave out and he started shooting. It
wasn't young Adolphe.</p>
<p>"Then old Zarinieff jumped up, bawled,</p>
<p>"'I've had enough of this,' and did exactly what
Sergeant-Major Brasche had done.</p>
<p>"At that we all started firing, to give him what support we
could. But, of course, he didn't last long.</p>
<p>"When I glanced round a few minutes later, I was surprised to
see how few of us were left; not more than about half a dozen,
besides Adolphe and me.</p>
<p>"And do you know what I thought of, <i>mes amis?</i> Those
pictures in the <i>Salle d'Honneur,</i> at the Depôt. And I
wished some artist could see what I saw, and paint a picture of
it. You know the sort of thing. <i>The Last Stand,</i> or
perhaps, <i>The End of the Day at Ain Zeb,</i> or something of
that sort.</p>
<p>"Of course, I was too busy to think much about anything. But
you know how these queer thoughts pass through your mind, and
what I was really thinking about all the time was young
Adolphe.</p>
<p>"Curiously enough, I hadn't any--what do you call
it?--premonition of death. Not a bit of it. In fact, I felt quite
sure that I should come through this scrap all right, as I'd come
through so many before.</p>
<p>"<i>Le bon Dieu</i> alone knows why I should have thought so,
for I'd never been in so tight a place in all my service, and
there seemed no earthly possibility of escape. How could there be
any end to it but death--either with or without torture,
according to one's luck?</p>
<p>"And--a still more curious thing, <i>mes amis.</i> Almost to
the last minute, I had a feeling that the Arabs weren't going to
get my young comrade . . . my young Adolphe.</p>
<p>"And so it went on, until there were only Schlosse, Ceppina,
Adolphe and me.</p>
<p>"Just about sunset, Schlosse, a good man who had been a
Sergeant, and degraded to the ranks for drunkenness, made another
tour round the last of the killed and wounded, for ammunition.
And what do you think Ceppina did? . . . Went to sleep. Fact. I
thought he was dead till I heard him snore.</p>
<p>"Schlosse, who seemed to think he was a Sergeant again, rolled
over and over until he was near enough to kick Ceppina in the
ribs and give him some more ammunition.</p>
<p>"'Don't you go to sleep till you've fired that lot,' said
Schlosse.</p>
<p>"And those were the last words of a good soldier who'd seen a
lot of trouble in his time.</p>
<p>"Still the Arabs kept on shooting and crawling nearer, and
Ceppina, Adolphe and I were lying, like three spokes of a wheel,
with our feet to the hub and our faces outward.</p>
<p>"Every now and then a few Arabs would start a little rush, and
it was a case of rapid-independent to stop them. It was no good
husbanding ammunition when they started that game.</p>
<p>"Presently I noticed that Ceppina had stopped firing, and,
looking round, saw that he was asleep for good, this time with
his head in a pool of blood.</p>
<p>"I took his ammunition and gave half of it to young
Adolphe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Adolphe . . . and I . . . alone . . . among . . . the dead. .
. .</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Still, if you can believe me, I did not feel that I was going
to die. Nor that the Arabs were going to get young Adolphe.</p>
<p>"Then I noticed that the Arab fire was slackening, and I could
see that a lot of them, in front of me, were looking up at the
sky, and wondered what for.</p>
<p>"I wondered all sorts of things. You know, one's head gets
queer at the end of a day like that, and one is apt to think
queerly . . . and to act queerly, too.</p>
<p>"Then I realized something that I tried not to realize. But it
was no good doing that.</p>
<p>"Adolphe had ceased firing.</p>
<p>"I sighted at an Arab who was raising himself on one hand, and
beckoning to others. And when I had sighted, I held my fire and
held my breath, and listened for the sound of Adolphe's
rifle.</p>
<p>"Adolphe had ceased firing.</p>
<p>"I shot the Arab, and then turned round with my heart in my
mouth--or in my boots.</p>
<p>"No, it was all right. Adolphe had put his rifle down. And,
with his chin on the backs of his hands, he lay flat, and stared
in front of him.</p>
<p>"He had fired away all his ammunition.</p>
<p>"And only then I realized that I had but two more cartridges
myself.</p>
<p>"I gave one of them to Adolphe.</p>
<p>"And still I felt that this wasn't Père Poussin's last fight,
and that the Arabs would not get Adolphe.</p>
<p>"Suddenly the Arabs gave a great cheer--if you can call their
yelling a cheer--pointed to the sky, and sprang up, hundreds of
them, all round us.</p>
<p>"I glanced at the sky and saw--the new moon.</p>
<p>"Then I heard Adolphe's rifle. They were charging from that
direction.</p>
<p>"His last cartridge.</p>
<p>"Adolphe had fired his last shot.</p>
<p>"In the breach of my rifle was my last cartridge.</p>
<p>"I could be sure of killing one man.</p>
<p>"And then--what?</p>
<p>"Adolphe and I taken alive. Adolphe in their hands--alive,
young, strong, unhurt.</p>
<p>"I saw again, as clearly as though it lay there before me, the
living body of that comrade of mine--the living body from which
they had cut off everything that can be cut from a man . . . and
the skewer . . .</p>
<p>"And I thought of the men we'd found lying with their
burnt-off feet and charred legs in the ashes of dead fires.</p>
<p>"And I thought of all the portraits of mutilated
<i>légionnaires</i> that are hung in the Barrack <i>chambrées</i>
at the Depôt for the 'information and guidance' of recruits.</p>
<p>"And I went mad, <i>mes amis</i>.</p>
<p>"Or did I become sane--saner than I've ever been in my
life?</p>
<p>"I don't know.</p>
<p>"What I do know is that I sprang to my feet, swung about
and--shot young Adolphe through the back of the head.</p>
<p>"Shot him from behind--as he stood, like a young lion, with
his bayonet at the 'ready.'</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"The last cartridge.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Then I turned my back, and the one thing I wanted, the one
thing before I died, was to get my bayonet into an Arab.</p>
<p>"Let them come. . . . I was ready to die now. More than ready.
. . . After what I had done.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"But they did not come.</p>
<p>"They halted, pointed, wavered, broke, fled.</p>
<p>"For, over a ridge, waving his sword and yelling,
'<i>C-h-a-a-a-r-g-e!</i>' at the top of his voice, like a
trumpet-call, galloped--a French officer.</p>
<p>"Straight at them, like a thunderbolt, he came, and they did
not wait for the squadron of Spahis, the galloping Company of
Mounted Infantry, the machine-guns, the <i>Tirailleurs,</i> the
Senegalese and Company of the Legion that
were--<i>not</i>--following him.</p>
<p>"They fled, and the officer, still yelling
'<i>C-h-a-a-a-r-g-e!</i>' and turning in his saddle to beckon on
the men who were <i>not</i> behind him, galloped on at break-neck
pace.</p>
<p>"Then he wheeled about, trotted his horse up to me and saluted
me with his sword, as though I'd been a General. . . .</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I never see the new moon without thinking of him, Lieutenant
Lucien de la Haye de Milvorde de Brabant. I heard that he was
killed in the Sharia massacre. He was a brave man, that one.</p>
<p>"Did ever one solitary man charge an army, single-handed,
before?"</p>
<p>"How came he to be there?" I asked.</p>
<p>"In command of a convoy, going to the same fort that we were
bound for. He'd heard the firing, headed for it, and, the only
mounted man, reconnoitred forward alone, seen what was up, and
charged alone, single-handed, as I told you.</p>
<p>"Lieutenant Lucien de la Haye de Milvorde de Brabant.</p>
<p>"There was something about him. . . . I know not what . . .
something kind . . . something that impelled me to tell him that,
with my last cartridge I had shot . . . <i>my own son.</i></p>
<p>"My own beloved son . . . my little Adolphe."</p>
<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c305" id="c305"><i>Moon-Shadows</i></a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 1</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Of all the extraordinarily interesting men I ever met in the
French Foreign Legion, perhaps the most interesting was the one
known as La Cigale (the Grasshopper).</p>
<p>His was an amazing case.</p>
<p>He was as mad as a hatter, completely insane, at times,
especially at full moon; he was eccentric, odd, peculiar, and
rather mad, most of the time; and upon occasion, for brief
periods, he was as sane as you or I.</p>
<p>But mad, sane, or merely eccentric, he was always and
invariably a gentleman, a gentle man, and a good soldier.</p>
<p>All we knew about him was that he was a Belgian nobleman of
very ancient family, had been an officer in the Belgian Corps of
Guides, and military attaché at more than one of the Belgian
Embassies.</p>
<p>That was all I knew, at any rate, until he honoured me by
telling me his story--under the influence of a fear, I believe,
that his next attack of insanity would be final and complete. Or
it may have been that he had a premonition of approaching
death.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§2</p>
<p> </p>
<p>La Cigale and I were seated, side by side, on a bench beside
the guard-room door, after Retreat, one particularly sultry
evening.</p>
<p>"The sun seems to achieve the impossible and get more powerful
every day," I remarked, as La Cigale unhooked his
<i>boucheron</i> and feebly fanned his face with his
<i>képi.</i></p>
<p>"It's the increasing power of the moon that troubles me more,"
he replied. "It'll be full moon in a day or two. . . .</p>
<p>"I say," he added, "you'll see me through, once again, won't
you? It's terrible. . . . Hell, twelve times a year. And yet one
can only die once. Why don't I die!"</p>
<p>"You'll recover," I said, with false cheery optimism.</p>
<p>"Madness <i>is</i> death--the death of the mind," he
continued. "And when I <i>am</i> mad, I don't suffer. It is the
going mad that is so terrible. When the Arabs have tortured a man
to death, he is dead and feels nothing. But think of what he
suffered first. I'm not whining or complaining--I'm wondering why
I keep on."</p>
<p>"Because you're a brave man," I said. "Whatever one's
religious views on the subject may be, as to the right and wrong
of committing suicide, it is evasion, escape, desertion, a kind
of cowardice, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"It's defeat, anyhow," replied La Cigale. "Admission of
defeat. Defeat by Fate, circumstance, pain, fear. But then, what
is Man that he should not be defeated by Fate?"</p>
<p>"Oh . . . I don't know. I suppose Man can defy Fate and
conquer circumstance and put up a good fight against pain and
fear. . . . But it's easy to talk, I admit."</p>
<p>"When you say Fate, do you mean God?" asked La Cigale.
"Because that raises a big and difficult question. From one point
of view, Fate is God and God is Fate. Yet you just spoke of
defying Fate, though you wouldn't speak of defying God, of
course. . . . And God wouldn't wish to drive you to suicide. . .
. It's this moonlight that defeats me . . . the moon. . . .</p>
<p>"Do you think the moon really has any direct effect on one's
mind--or is it association of ideas . . . memory
connections?"</p>
<p>La Cigale was sane enough to-night, but this was dangerous and
difficult ground.</p>
<p>"I've heard that it is a bad thing to sleep exposed to the
rays of the full moon," I hedged.</p>
<p>"Oh, you're begging the question, my dear chap. What I meant
was, does the full moon itself drive me mad, or is it the painful
memories evoked by the full moon?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. Does the full moon evoke painful memories? I
beg your pardon. I . . ."</p>
<p>I hastened to apologize for the thoughtless question. In the
Legion one does not ask such things, nor make references to the
past.</p>
<p>"Oh, not at all, my dear chap. I'll tell you."</p>
<p>"No, no. Please don't think I was being inquisitive."</p>
<p>"Of course not. I'd like to tell you. I've a sort of feeling
it might be a good thing--if it won't bore you--to talk about the
affair.</p>
<p>"You have the expression in English 'to make a clean breast of
it.' Not that my breast is unclean in that connection. And they
say confession is good for the soul, though again I haven't
anything to 'confess' in that respect. But the doctors have an
idea, nowadays, that weeding the garden of the mind is very
beneficial to the health. Or perhaps a better simile is
ventilating the room in which dwells the mind. No, that doesn't
quite satisfy, either. Perhaps a surgical simile is best--probing
and opening up . . . getting that which is festering in the dark
recesses of the mind, up into the light of day. . . .</p>
<p>"I'll tell you why I hate moonlight--hate it apart from any
question as to whether moonlight itself affects one mentally and
physically.</p>
<p>"I won't mention any names, although it's all so long ago. You
might not think it, but I was an Officer once. . . .</p>
<p>"As a matter of fact, I did think it," I said.</p>
<p>"Yes, but what you didn't know or think, is that I was an
Officer of the Legion."</p>
<p>"No!" I said, astounded.</p>
<p>"I was. <i>A sous-lieutenant. . . .</i> I had been a Captain
in our own Army. I won't bore you with reasons . . . private
affairs . . . a love affair really . . . a French girl. . . .</p>
<p>"I was able to pull strings. . . . I had been a Military
Attaché in France and was <i>persona grata</i> to the Minister of
War, whom I'd been able to serve in what was, to him, a rather
important affair.</p>
<p>"Well, as I say, I got a commission in the Legion and,
moreover, got sent on active service almost at once.</p>
<p>"The French girl, the name of whose family you would recognize
at once--a name known throughout Europe--had a twin brother.</p>
<p>"It was one of those cases of twin minds as well as twin
bodies--what the medical psychologists call 'identical' twins. In
childhood they were not happy apart. Neither of them could be
happy unless the other was happy. If one suffered, the other
suffered. If, on the rare occasions when they were parted,
anything important happened to one, the other knew of it. I don't
mean that the other knew exactly what had happened, but the other
inevitably and infallibly knew that something had happened.</p>
<p>"And yet here's a curious thing. Although these twins were two
bodies with but a single mind, so to speak, and each literally
loved the other as itself--and more than itself--their characters
differed utterly.</p>
<p>"Diane was essentially good. I don't mean in the religious
sense particularly, but good in the sense of being a person of
good will, full of kindness and friendliness, incapable of
baseness, meanness, treachery, cruelty. . . . A character wholly
admirable, wholly lovable. . . . Yes, Diane was essentially good
in the best and widest and truest sense of the word.</p>
<p>"Now the same could not be said of Raoul. I don't for one
moment mean that he was essentially bad. Not at all. But whereas
nobody could fail to be struck by the sweetness, kindness and
goodness of his sister, no one, I am afraid, was ever struck by
the sweetness, kindness and goodness of Raoul.</p>
<p>"By his charm, yes; by his grace, ability, courage, yes; by
his wit and skill and beauty, yes. . . . But not by his kindness
or goodness.</p>
<p>"A very accomplished young man. A very competent, ambitious,
successful soldier.</p>
<p>"Apart from the fact that he was Diane's brother, I loved him
very much indeed. Everybody did. But he being Diane's brother, I
did more than love him very much indeed.</p>
<p>"For one thing, he was so amazingly like her. Why, before he
grew into a broad-shouldered well-set-up young man, they had only
to exchange clothes to exchange personalities. I mean that no one
but themselves would know that the exchange had been
effected.</p>
<p>"As children, as boy and girl, as growing youth and maiden,
they could at any time do this, and deceive everybody, so alike
were they.</p>
<p>"Thus you may imagine what the society of Raoul meant to me.
To look at him was almost to look at Diane. To hear his voice was
almost to hear hers. Is it cause for wonder that I loved Raoul,
and that I shut my eyes to everything that I did not wish to
see?</p>
<p>"Poor Raoul! . . .</p>
<p>"As you will have guessed, if you find my story worth guessing
about, it was to be with Raoul that I left my own Army, and the
rather idle, somewhat aimless life I was leading as a Military
Attaché.</p>
<p>"To be with Raoul was the next best thing to being with Diane.
Also to be with him and . . . what shall I say? . . . keep an eye
on him, look after him . . . was the way I could best serve
Diane.</p>
<p>"Perhaps you wonder--if, again, this little tale is worth
wondering about--why I did not propose marriage to Diane and
settle down with her in Paris.</p>
<p>"There were difficulties. Her parents and her very powerful
family had other views for her. Incidentally the 'other views'
were an elderly man who bore a famous and honoured name in an
infamous and unhonoured manner.</p>
<p>"Also, Diane, while admittedly very fond of me, did not
actually love me. Certainly not in the way in which I loved her.
That I won't attempt to describe. I'll merely say that I adored
her; that she filled my life; was my life; was the reason why I
left everything and followed--her brother.</p>
<p>"He needed some following, too, for he was wild and
high-spirited. He took what he wanted, did what he wished, and
was all-too-frequently in trouble of some sort. A throw-back to
the days and ways of the <i>grand seigneur</i> untrammelled.</p>
<p>"He called me, half wryly, the Keeper of his Conscience; and I
called him, quite wryly, the Keeper of my Purse--for he was
terribly extravagant and he owed me a great deal of money. I
don't mean that I gave him money to squander, but that he was
constantly coming to me to get him out of those scrapes which
need a golden key to open the door of escape.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, undoubtedly he traded on my devotion to Diane, but
then that was quite understandable and excusable, in view of the
fact that it was my devotion to Diane that had made me his
friend, and now his brother-in-arms, companion and mentor. . .
.</p>
<p>"Had I any hope of success with Diane? . . . Oh yes. I could
not otherwise have borne to do as I did, and constantly to seek
the society of her brother. I felt that, in time, her family
might be induced to withdraw their opposition for, although I am
not a Frenchman and one of their Boulevard St. Germain
<i>ancienne noblesse,</i> my family is as noble as theirs, and
has lived in its own chateau for more centuries than their family
has lived on its estates, or any other French family has
done.</p>
<p>"Also I felt pretty sure that Diane, a girl of great strength
of character, would never agree to marry Monsieur le Marquis de
M. . . . Also I knew that, if she did not love me, she loved
nobody else. And as your poet says, 'Hope springs eternal in the
human breast.'</p>
<p>"Anyhow, I was writing to her by every mail, assuring her of
the health, happiness, and good conduct of her adored twin, and
of my unchanging and unchangeable love.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Nevertheless, when we went on active service, it was, in
spite of what I'd said of Raoul's conduct, about time.</p>
<p>"For although his military duties were performed impeccably,
it was becoming increasingly difficult to keep him out of serious
trouble. . . .</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I expect you know all about Colonel Jeffre's great desert
march, and of the amazing disaster to Colonel Dubosc's relief
column that was sent after him several months later--the 'relief'
column whose survivors he himself relieved?</p>
<p>"We were with Colonel Dubosc's column.</p>
<p>"Yes, I am one of the survivors of the Sharia massacre. Didn't
you know? . . . No, I suppose I never mentioned it to anybody
since I rejoined the Legion as a private soldier, all those years
ago.</p>
<p>"Poor Colonel Dubosc. What an example that fine soldier was,
of those who suffer from the vices of their virtues, as the
expression is. His great military virtue was his leonine courage,
and he had its complementary defect of rashness. If only his
caution had been one half as marked as his courage, he'd probably
be alive and a Maréchal of France to-day.</p>
<p>"You know what happened at Sharia, of course?"</p>
<p>"Not the details," I replied. "Only that there was a very
complete disaster. I've never before had the privilege of talking
with a survivor."</p>
<p>"Well, it was the old, old story of over-confidence. Despising
your opponent and forgetting that discretion is an admirable part
of valour.</p>
<p>"Not that Colonel Dubosc absolutely ignored the usual military
precautions, of course. He was too good a soldier to do that: but
they were regarded by him, and consequently by his Staff and by
the whole force, as mere routine, and therefore to be
performed--as routine.</p>
<p>"Every night, when the column camped, on its march to the
relief of Colonel Jeffre, it did so in the proper manner as laid
down in the book--but only because it was so laid down, and not
because the column was moving in the presence of an extremely
dangerous enemy, amazingly mobile, recklessly brave, and
perfectly adapted to the conditions under which it was
fighting.</p>
<p>"So the perimeter-camp was made every night, surrounded by a
shallow trench when in sandy country, and by a low wall of piled
stones, where the ground was hard and rocky.</p>
<p>"Guards were mounted and sentries posted in the correct
manner--and that was that.</p>
<p>"There was no real watchfulness, no hint of anxiety as to the
safety of the column, no special precautions such as, most
certainly, should have been taken--such, in fact, as Colonel
Jeffre invariably took. That was why Colonel Jeffre to whose
relief Colonel Dubosc was proceeding, scarcely lost a man,
whereas Colonel Dubosc lost himself, forty-six officers and over
nine hundred of other ranks.</p>
<p>"It happened at full moon. . . . Full moon. . . .</p>
<p>"After a terribly hot and tiring march, Colonel Dubosc halted
the column and, as soon as possible after the orders <i>Sacs à
terre</i> and <i>Aux murailles,</i> bivouac was made, the men
fed, and the weary column fell asleep. And I should think that
statement includes every one of the sentries, though I'm by no
means certain that trouble would have been averted if they'd all
been wide awake and keenly watchful."</p>
<p>"Why?" I asked, as La Cigale paused and gazed absently before
him.</p>
<p>"Why? Because the camp was most unfortunately or carelessly
sited. Although, from where the column had halted, the desert
looked fairly level as far as the horizon, in all directions,
there was, as a matter of fact, a fold of the ground, a wide
shallow depression, half a kilometre from the camp. And to this
depression there led a broad winding <i>wadi,</i> the whole
geographical formation rather simulating a dried-up lake and a
dry river-bed leading to it--which probably it was.</p>
<p>"Anyhow, with consummate skill and daring, a great Arab
<i>harka</i> which doubtless had been following us for days, made
its way, cavalry, camelry and infantry, unheard and unseen, along
the wide shallow river-bed, and debouched into the
depression.</p>
<p>"Here they formed up, made their plan of attack, and waited
until the small hours when the camp was absolutely silent and
still, not a man stirring and, as I've said, probably not a
sentry awake.</p>
<p>"All this was, of course, reconstructed afterwards by Colonel
Jeffre and his Staff. Naturally, nothing of it was known to
Dubosc's column. All that was known to any of them was that they
awoke to find the Arabs among them.</p>
<p>"I don't know who the Arab leader was on that occasion, but he
was a good man. He actually formed his cavalry up, in a long
double rank, on the edge of the depression, his camel-men in a
line behind them, and his spearmen and swordsmen in support.</p>
<p>"Then, all being ready, he simply charged--just as though
attacking a square or a line of infantry.</p>
<p>"Walk . . . trot . . . canter . . . gallop . . . <i>charge . .
.</i> and, like an avalanche, the horsemen dashed down upon the
camp, leapt the low walls--and swept across the bivouac like a
wave breaking over a sand-castle.</p>
<p>"Before a shot was fired, they were among the
suddenly-awakened men, hacking, slashing, stabbing and trampling
the bewildered, unarmed, almost unresisting mob--for that is what
the column was at that moment . . . its last moment.</p>
<p>". . . One shot as the Arabs charged; one cry of '<i>Aux
armes</i>'; and every man would have snatched his rifle and
rushed to his post. Before the Arabs had crossed the few hundred
yards that lay between their starting-point and the camp, a burst
of fire would have mown them down. Few of the horsemen would have
reached the walls.</p>
<p>"But it was the Arabs themselves who gave the alarm, as they
crashed, a living avalanche, into the camp.</p>
<p>"Of what avail for a thus-awakened man to seize his rifle and
dash to the wall when the Arabs are already within it--hundreds
and hundreds of them, each with raised sword or couched spear,
slashing or thrusting at anything and everything that moves.</p>
<p>"Men sprang to their feet only to have their skulls cleft or
almost severed from their shoulders.</p>
<p>"Here and there a man with fixed bayonet thrust at a horseman,
only to be cut down by another from behind. Here and there a man
fumbled to load his rifle, only to be trampled, speared, or
hacked, as he did so.</p>
<p>"And behind the cavalry came the great Wave of camel-men on
their swift war-camels, their long spears couched.</p>
<p>"And behind them again--worst of all, perhaps--running like
grey-hounds and yelling like fiends, charged the swordsmen . .
.</p>
<p>"It wasn't a fight, it was a massacre.</p>
<p>"The horses and mules, tethered in the centre of the camp,
stampeded; and, within a few minutes of the charge, the area
within the perimeter was a hell upon earth, complete chaos, utter
confusion, a whirling yelling inferno, a mad maelstrom, a
seething sea of men and animals, of slaughter and
destruction.</p>
<p>"Here and there little knots of soldiers got back to back and,
with fixed bayonet and clubbed rifle, sold their lives dearly.
Here and there little bands of fugitives fled together, loading
as they ran, blindly seeking some rallying-point, some chance to
stand and form and fight.</p>
<p>"In vain.</p>
<p>"Herded, harried, hunted, they were borne down by sheer weight
of numbers, surrounded, hacked to pieces, annihilated.</p>
<p>"Colonel Dubosc's body was found just outside the little
<i>tent d'abri</i> in which he slept, and from which he had
evidently rushed to his death. His left hand still clutched his
emptied revolver, and his broken sword transfixed an Arab who lay
at his feet. Dubosc had died a soldier's death, paying the
penalty of his rash indifference to danger--his careless
negligence, if you like; and the men, as usual, had had to join
in the payment of the Commander's debt to the exacting and
unrelenting God of War.</p>
<p>"My own experience, that ghastly unforgettable night? Yes, I
was going to tell you, wasn't I? . . .</p>
<p>"I was dreaming that I was at Longchamps or Auteille, at the
Races. The horses were coming up the straight; the crowd was
shouting; the drumming of hooves growing louder and louder. So
loud it grew that it woke me.</p>
<p>"What? . . . Yes. . . . It <i>was</i> the drumming of hooves.
. . . I raised my head and, as I did so, my astounded and
incredulous brain, still half-drugged with sleep, had to realize
that a regiment of cavalry in full charge, actually charging in
line, was but a few yards from the wall nearest to me.</p>
<p>"Even as I sat up in bewildered amazement, the whole line took
the wall in its stride, and was down upon us like the wave of a
tidal bore; like a tornado, a cyclone, an avalanche--I know not
what.</p>
<p>"As I sprang to my feet, an Arab slashed at me with his sword.
Had he had the sense to give me the point, I shouldn't be here
now. Why didn't he? . . .</p>
<p>"I ducked and sprang, and a horse knocked me flying. Unhurt, I
jumped up as a great sinewy fellow, active as a cat, rushed at me
with a raised spear. I don't know whether he'd been thrown from
his horse, or whether he had charged on foot with the cavalry.
Anyhow, there he was, the first dismounted man I saw. Unarmed
myself, I ducked and butted him in the stomach, like a goat.
Unsoldierly conduct, worthy of an apache, but highly effective,
for he did not know the proper counter of swinging up his knee to
smash my face and save his stomach.</p>
<p>"We went down together, I on top, and, as he struggled to get
above me, I aided him with all my heart.</p>
<p>"In a moment, he was the top dog, and I clasped him to my
bosom. Oh, how I clasped . . . my arms about him like a band of
iron . . . my left hand gripping my right wrist like a vice.</p>
<p>"While that six feet of india-rubber man was above me, I was
fairly safe from hoof or sword or spear.</p>
<p>"It was almost like being under water, almost like being
buried alive, so dense was the whirling press of struggling,
fighting, yelling humanity around me.</p>
<p>"Suddenly the heavings and strainings of my protecting foeman
ceased. Either a horse had smashed his skull, or an
undiscriminating enthusiast had driven a spear into him, <i>en
passant.</i></p>
<p>"Sorely was I tempted to lie still, beneath him; but I was an
Officer, and it is not the rôle of an Officer to lie shamming
dead.</p>
<p>"Pushing the inert body from off me, I scrambled to my feet,
picking up the dead man's spear as I did so. An Arab on a white
horse was in the very act of cutting down, from behind, a
<i>légionnaire</i> who, clad only in his trousers, was
desperately, with whirling gun-butt, fighting two spearmen.</p>
<p>"Into this horseman's right side, beneath the raised sword
arm, I drove the spear, and with it pulled him from the
horse.</p>
<p>"Seizing its reins, I managed to vault on to its back and was
thankful for the <i>voltige</i> schooling of my cavalry days in
Belgium.</p>
<p>"Now what?</p>
<p>"Any hope of rallying some men?</p>
<p>"Absolutely none. The place was a solid mass of seething
humanity. A slaughter-house, a shambles. It was a case of
<i>sauve qui peut,</i> and a faint possibility of doing some good
outside, if one could get outside. Possibly some of the troop of
Spahis had got away.</p>
<p>"The horse was a good one, a fiery stallion needing
controlling rather than urging.</p>
<p>"With raised spear and, I believe, ferocious yells, I drove
him through the press and at the wall. Had the enemy been fewer,
my chances would have been smaller. In a few bounds, and without
serious wounds, I was outside the camp and, like a thunderbolt,
through the thinner press of running swordsmen without.</p>
<p>"Nowhere could I see anything resembling a square or clump or
knot of our men putting up a fight against the Arab hordes. Here
and there a fugitive was being pursued, and here and there a
fallen man was being hacked to pieces with insensate fury.</p>
<p>"One or two mounted men looked like out-distancing their
pursuers.</p>
<p>"What should I do?</p>
<p>"I would ride in the direction of Colonel Jeffre's column--the
force that we had been hastening to 'relieve,' and which was
probably within only two or three days' march of us.</p>
<p>"If I could reach Colonel Jeffre and warn him--not that he was
a man who needed much warning--he might yet be in time to
retrieve some of the stores which we had been bringing him. He
might yet be in time to avenge the massacre.</p>
<p>"Not that there was much chance of my reaching him, though
there was just a possibility of my encountering one of the
<i>méhariste</i> scouts that he used with such consummate
ability.</p>
<p>"Riding hard, I was almost clear of the enemy when suddenly I
was aware that, away on my right front, a small fight was going
on; for several revolver shots were fired.</p>
<p>"Changing direction half-right, I urged my horse on, and with
an Arab spear for cavalry-lance, charged headlong upon a group of
Arab swordsmen encircling, and closing in upon, a French officer.
As he fired again, at a man who suddenly rushed upon him, I
bawled at the top of my lungs to distract the attention of
another swordsman who was charging the officer from behind.</p>
<p>"I was just in time, and my Arab spear went through him like a
knife through butter.</p>
<p>"The Officer's shot brought down the man in front of him, and
as I drove at another of his assailants, all of whom now turned
their attention to me, he swiftly re-loaded, and shot two
more.</p>
<p>"Wheeling about again, I dashed across to him.</p>
<p>"'Quick,' I shouted. 'Hang on to my stirrup leather,' and, as
he raised his head, the shadow of the peak of his <i>képi</i>
left his face, and I saw that it was Raoul.</p>
<p>"'Thank God!' I said. And it shows how incredibly sudden and
swift; how crashing, crushing, and stunning had the whole affair
been, that until this moment, I had not thought of him.</p>
<p>"I felt ashamed.</p>
<p>"'Steady the pace a bit,' he panted, running beside me. 'I
can't keep this up long.'</p>
<p>"What would I not have given to have been astride my own
faithful charger, trained and steady as a circus horse, instead
of this wild bounding Arab stallion, so difficult to manage and
control.</p>
<p>"A charger would have carried us both at once. With this wild
beast it would be hopeless to attempt to mount together, apart
from the obstacle of its impossible saddle, with its high-peaked
pommel and crupper.</p>
<p>"There was one thing, I could always stop the brute dead,
thanks to the cruel great thorn-bit that savagely tortured its
mouth.</p>
<p>"I did my best to keep at a steady trot, not too fast for the
runner clinging to my stirrup, nor too slow to give us hope of
out-distancing pursuit by the swift-running swordsmen who hung
upon our flanks and rear like wolves.</p>
<p>"'Hold tight, and run like the devil for a minute,' I shouted,
and, after a sharp spurt that must almost have pulled Raoul's arm
from his shoulder, and his feet from the ground, I drew rein,
pulled up, and sprang to earth.</p>
<p>"'Up, quick,' I said to Raoul, and gave him a hoist, for he
was pretty well spent with that gruelling run.</p>
<p>"Our pursuers had gained but little upon us, before we were
off again, I, now clinging to the stirrup-leather and running for
dear life.</p>
<p>"And soon, as I ran, with swiftly tiring limbs and labouring
breath, I considered the feasibility of dispensing with the
saddle, and making the attempt to ride the horse bare-backed,
with one of us sitting behind the other.</p>
<p>"Quickly I abandoned the idea. The horse, though swift and
fiery, was light and weedy; and, though Raoul was a fine horseman
and I had been a Cavalry Officer, I doubted whether the pair of
us could stick on a wildly bucking bare-backed horse. . . .</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"How much longer could I run? . . .</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"How much longer could Raoul expect me to run?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I glanced up at him and met his look, as he turned his face
sideways down to me . . .</p>
<p>". . . and brought his right hand over across his left elbow .
. .</p>
<p>". . . and pointed his revolver at my face . . .</p>
<p>". . . and fired . . .</p>
<p>". . . and missed me . . .</p>
<p>". . . and fired again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 3</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Yes. My friend, comrade, and brother-officer, Raoul, to whose
rescue I had come, shot me down in cold blood--murdered me, as he
supposed--and intended," continued La Cigale.</p>
<p>"Did you ever notice the wound-mark I have on my left
shoulder, near my neck?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Yes," I said.</p>
<p>"That is the mark of his bullet, or one of the marks, rather.
He had tried to shoot me through the head, but the bullet,
instead of piercing my skull and brain, travelled through the
bone itself, entering just--here . . . and coming out--here . . .
and then striking my shoulder--here, and penetrating deep down
into my chest.</p>
<p>"It was the restive horse that saved me, I suppose, bounding
and prancing as it did; otherwise Raoul would not have missed me
with the first shot, and only hit the side of my head with the
second."</p>
<p>"What a treacherous ungrateful devil!" I said, as La Cigale
paused in his story. "I doubt if I ever heard of a baser deed. .
. . The man must be a monster . . . a cold-hearted sub-human . .
."</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't know," interrupted La Cigale. "I wouldn't say
that. Selfish and self-centred, I grant you, with a definite
<i>chacun pour soi</i> philosophy . . . Nietzschean . . . the
over-man."</p>
<p>"Over-devil," I growled.</p>
<p>"Well, there it was. I suppose poor Raoul realized that we
couldn't both get away at the speed of the slower . . . while one
was a drag on the other. And there were lots of swift camel-men
about. Doubtless he argued that it was better for one of us to
escape than for both to be butchered."</p>
<p>"Then why didn't he throw himself off your horse? Panic, I
suppose."</p>
<p>"Oh no. No. Raoul was a very brave man."</p>
<p>"That makes it worse, then," said I.</p>
<p>"Well, that's rather a fine point, a matter of opinion. Isn't
cowardice the lowest vice a soldier can exhibit? Which is really
worse; to be so terrified that you shoot down the friend who is
trying to save your life; or, having calmly and coolly calculated
the chances, to decide that only one can escape and that you
shall be the one?"</p>
<p>"A pretty choice," I observed. "But at any rate a coward can't
help being what he is. Surely, better cowardice than blackest
ingratitude and foulest treachery."</p>
<p>"Well, as I say, Raoul was a very brave man, and evidently
decided that a man's first duty is to himself, and
self-preservation his first law.</p>
<p>"Anyhow, Raoul shot me down--and escaped."</p>
<p>La Cigale fell silent, his troubled eyes obviously seeing
nothing of what was present before them, and everything of what
was past. Terrible unforgettable things that had driven him mad.
Or--an idea occurred to me--had the bullet touched and damaged
his brain, in what he called its passage through the bone of his
skull?</p>
<p>"Isn't it a curious thing," he resumed, "that I should
remember everything up to the time when I fainted from loss of
blood? One would have thought unconsciousness would have been
instantaneous, and that the mind would have retained no memory of
events immediately preceding the shooting.</p>
<p>"But no such luck! Everything is as clear as though it
happened yesterday. As clear, indeed, as though I had been a mere
onlooker; and, myself uninjured, had watched it happen to someone
else.</p>
<p>"Nay, I can see it now. The moonlit desert, bright as day; the
rocks, stones, sand, an occasional thorn-bush or cactus; the
Arabs running like grey-hounds; Raoul's face--his face as he bent
over and downward toward me; and his eyes as they met mine.</p>
<p>"Do you wonder that I hate and fear moonlight?</p>
<p>"Before I collapsed and fainted, I saw that he had got away
from his pursuers. The moment I fell, releasing my hold upon the
stirrup-leather, the stallion bounded forward at redoubled speed,
and was away--like a racehorse when the starting-gate goes
up.</p>
<p>"Do you know, my friend, I felt a thrill of joy, a feeling of
immense relief and gratitude."</p>
<p>"To the good Raoul?" I asked.</p>
<p>"No, to the good God. For I was perfectly sure that if Raoul
had been killed, Diane would have died of grief . . . Died of a
broken heart."</p>
<p>"Do people die of broken hearts?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Well, no, perhaps hearts don't literally break, and doctors
don't recognize 'broken heart' as a certifiable cause of death. .
. . But people do die of grief, you know. Just pine and lose
interest in life, and die of the sheer lack of desire to live.
Why, animals do that much.</p>
<p>"Yes, I can honestly say I was glad and thankful to see Raoul
getting away, because news of his death would have been, to put
it mildly, a terrible blow to Diane. She was not an ordinary
sister, you remember, but a twin; and not an ordinary twin, but
an 'identical' one.</p>
<p>"No, curiously enough, the swordsmen who had been pursuing us
paid no further attention to me at all. I suppose that when they
abandoned the hopeless chase of Raoul, they found me apparently
quite dead, if they returned straight in their tracks and found
me. Presumably they were in too great a hurry to get back and
join in the orgy of looting and slaughter at the camp.</p>
<p>"No, memory spares me nothing, except as to what happened
between the moment of losing consciousness, when I thought I was
dying, and awakening to discover that unfortunately I was
alive.</p>
<p>"<i>Mon Dieu,</i> I had a bad time before Colonel Jeffre's
scouts arrived.</p>
<p>"It appears that some of the Spahis of our column did get
away; and one of them, galloping all night, had the luck to run
into a <i>peloton</i> of Jeffre's <i>méharistes,</i> out scouting
for our force. Their Officer sent some of his men back to inform
Jeffre while with the remainder, guided by the Spahi, he made a
reconnaissance in the direction of the scene of the massacre.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, they found me just living, gave me water and
first-aid, kept me alive, and eventually in Jeffre's field
hospital I was patched up, together with a few other wounded
survivors.</p>
<p>"These were few indeed, as all who were not actually dead had
been left for dead, and, as you know, when the Arab has finished
with a wounded man, he generally <i>is</i> finished."</p>
<p>Again La Cigale fell silent and stared unseeingly before
him--or seeing too much.</p>
<p>"I was in a queer state," he resumed, "even when I was able to
get about again. The moonlight. . . . The moonlight seemed to
have got into my brain . . . through the bullet-hole,
perhaps."</p>
<p>I looked at him sharply. Was he beginning to wander in his
mind, as he so often did?</p>
<p>"No, I'm not talking nonsense," he smiled. "I was only
speaking figuratively. But it's quite a good figure--of speech.
It really did seem to me then, as indeed it so often seems to me
now, especially at full moon, that its light is shining right
into my head, right into my very brain . . . through the hole
that Raoul's bullet made in my skull . . . just as moonlight
shines into a garret room through a window in its sloping roof--a
great white cold light, powerful as the beam of a searchlight; a
light by which I see every incident of that terrible massacre
again; a light by which I see myself murdered once more, by my
friend and comrade and brother-officer, Raoul, the twin-brother
of Diane.</p>
<p>"Yes, I was in a queer state and the <i>Médecin-Major</i> who
looked after me, kind good chap, thought I was mad. He decided
that the events of that night had turned my brain. In his
opinion, the bullet had not caused any cerebral lesion. No, it
was when I first asked him to see me through the next period of
full moon that he began to eye me queerly, and talk to me
soothingly, as though I were a child--or a lunatic. . . .</p>
<p>"And do you know what my great terror was, from the hour I was
picked up?</p>
<p>"It was the fear that, at any moment, Raoul might ride into
Colonel Jeffre's camp. That--and the fear that he might not do
so.</p>
<p>"Can you understand me?</p>
<p>"My dread, my horror, was the thought that I might come face
to face with Raoul.</p>
<p>"My fear, my agony of anxiety, was that he might be dead.</p>
<p>"I wonder that the suspense, in my then weak state, did not
kill me: but I suppose nothing can kill me--and I refuse to kill
myself.</p>
<p>"Perhaps you cannot understand my abject quivering fright at
the thought of seeing Raoul. Can you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I can," I assured La Cigale.</p>
<p>"Yes, of course you can. . . . What should I have done if he
had come? What could I have said? I suffered so, at the mere
thought of it, that it was really as though I were the
murderer.</p>
<p>"Really, I think that I could better have faced him--with less
perturbation, less horror; far, far less shame and misery of
soul--had it been I who had tried to kill him. Can you understand
that?"</p>
<p>"I can," I assured La Cigale, "for in that case you would have
been of that type. A man who can try to murder his friend is the
kind of man who can face him afterwards. The sort of man who'd be
sick, to the depths of his soul, at the bare thought of such a
deed, is of the sort who'd almost die of shame <i>for</i> the
friend who tried to kill him."</p>
<p>"Yes, of course you understand, <i>mon ami.</i> That was it. I
felt I should die of shame, as you say, if I saw Raoul. . . .</p>
<p>"Well, I was spared that, anyhow. Raoul, with his usual luck
and, one must add, with his usual intrepidity, endurance and
courage, rode for two or three days, and then either bluffed,
over-awed, or bribed with promises, the petty Sheikh of some
little oasis, and induced him to produce guides and camels.</p>
<p>"With a wretched and ill-equipped little caravan, he made his
way north and east, until eventually he either struck a caravan
route or reached a French outpost.</p>
<p>"At any rate, he got back to civilization, the heroic
survivor--believed for some time to be the sole survivor--of the
massacre of Sharia, long before Colonel Jeffre's slow-moving
column, and very long before I did.</p>
<p>"Yes, I was a long time in hospital at Figuig--and when
sufficiently recovered, physically and mentally, to go before a
<i>Conseil de Réforme,</i><sup>1</sup> I failed to pass it and
was discharged from the Army.</p>
<p>"Yes, '<i>invalidation</i>'; '<i>congé de réforme,'</i>
<sup>2</sup> No longer <i>bon pour le service.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><sup>1</sup> Medical Board. <sup>2</sup> Invalided out of the
Army.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 4</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"So there I was, you see. At what you call a loose end.
Othello's occupation was gone--and Othello was undoubtedly and
admittedly in a queer state.</p>
<p>"Did I tell you that I'd forgotten my name? That was strange,
wasn't it? I could remember absolutely every incident and detail
of the night of the massacre, but I'd forgotten my own name.</p>
<p>"It was discovered for me, later, and I wrote it down, and
kept it with my address, always handy. Thus I could always tell
anyone who I was, and be sure as to where I lived.</p>
<p>"And still my great fear was that I might meet Raoul. It was
so powerful and obsessive that only one thing could overcome it,
and that was my longing to see Diane.</p>
<p>"At first, and for a long time, I could not go near her for
fear I should see her brother, and because I should have to talk
to her about her brother. But gradually the longing overcame the
fear.</p>
<p>"No, I'd had no letter from Diane. You see, it was supposed
that I had perished with the rest of the column, and as I had,
for a long time, lost my identity and forgotten my name, no one
knew that I had survived.</p>
<p>"The 'nine days' wonder'--of the loss of Colonel Dubosc's
column--was ended, and something else filling the public eye,
long, long before I was released from hospital at Figuig, and
returned to France.</p>
<p>"So I did not hear from Diane. And, had she written to me, the
letter would not have reached me, as, quite apart from any
question of temporary loss of memory and general 'queerness,' I
had deliberately and intentionally 'disappeared.'</p>
<p>"It seemed to me to be the only way in which I could live in
the same world as Raoul. If I remained myself and retained my
name and lived the old life in the old way, we were bound to
meet, and I would far sooner have met Death himself.</p>
<p>"I'm glad you can understand that feeling. I doubt whether
most people could.</p>
<p>"I don't quite know how I lived through the weeks and months
that followed.</p>
<p>"And then, one day, love conquered fear, as I say, and I wrote
to Diane.</p>
<p>"I told her--what was quite true--that I had been badly
wounded at Sharia; and that upon recovery I had been invalided
out of the Army, that I had since been in a Nursing Home, very
ill and unable to write letters, but that I was now up and about
again, and, above all things, longed to see her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I had the most charming reply conceivable.</p>
<p>"She wrote from the villa of a friend with whom she was
staying at Antibes.</p>
<p>"It was everything but a love letter; and it would have lifted
me from the hell in which I existed, up into the seventh heaven
of happiness, but for the fact that the letter closed with the
statement that Raoul would be coming over from Monte Carlo to
join them in a day or two . . .</p>
<p>"Another <i>mauvais quart d'heure.</i> An <i>impasse.</i> I
must meet Diane. I simply must. I could not meet Raoul. I simply
could not.</p>
<p>"And then I took myself in hand. I wrestled and fought with
myself. I drove myself out into the open, so to speak, and made
myself realize, admit, and face that elusive and so often
terrible thing, the subconscious motive.</p>
<p>"<i>Why</i> did I so fear to face Raoul, to whom I had never
done any harm in my life? . . . Raoul whom I had always helped,
befriended, excused and defended? Was it not the purest moral
cowardice on my part? Was I not simply afraid to meet him?</p>
<p>"Yes, but why 'afraid,' myself argued with me.</p>
<p>"Afraid of unpleasantness, I replied. Afraid of an awkward
situation. More than awkward, of course--tragic, terrible, almost
unique.</p>
<p>"Yes, I decided, although, like any person of a certain
sensitiveness, any fineness of nature, gentlemanly instincts, you
naturally shrink with loathing from the thought of thrusting your
unspeakably embarrassing presence upon the poor devil who has
tried to murder you--the real reason is cowardice. . . . A
cowardly fear of unpleasantness. . . . It isn't the
unpleasantness for him that you feel, nearly as much as the
unpleasantness for yourself. You must go. Go and get it over,
this interview with Raoul.</p>
<p>"After all, it is his trouble, not yours. It was his crime,
not yours. You can't go on avoiding him and Diane for the rest of
your life, because of what he did. And if you could do so, why
should you? Surely he's done you enough harm already, in
shattering your health and ruining your career.</p>
<p>"Thus I argued with myself. Common sense arguing with
instinct; reason arguing with profound, deep-rooted
unreasonableness; freedom wrestling with inhibition.</p>
<p>"What casuists we are, and how faithfully a man can act
according to his conscience, once he has taught his conscience to
act according to him!</p>
<p>"I don't know. . . . I decided in the end that it was not
gentleman-like sensitiveness that I was up against, but sheer
funk of a nasty situation, and I decided to go. Raoul need not
meet me if he didn't wish to; and if we did meet, I need say
nothing whatsoever about what lay between us. If Raoul chose to
say anything, offer any explanation, I still need say nothing. If
he offered--apology . . . I could accept it. If he begged
forgiveness, I could forgive him from the bottom of my soul,
absolutely, and start afresh.</p>
<p>"I went.</p>
<p>"It was again my luck, or fate, that I should arrive at the
villa at the time of full moon.</p>
<p>"Another of the scenes that I cannot forget, even when I
forget my name, is that truly lovely sub-tropical garden, as I
walked up through it to the very beautiful villa which, I had to
admit, was fit setting even for that human jewel, Diane.</p>
<p>"In that moment, I was, in spite of everything, happy. In
spite even of the moonlight. Happy to be there within a few yards
of her.</p>
<p>"Happy even to be myself, since myself was about to see her,
to speak to her, to kiss her hand, to hear her voice.</p>
<p>"I think, <i>mon ami,</i> that that was the last time that
ever I was happy.</p>
<p>"I felt that she too would be happy, because, ironically
enough, the full of the moon was her time of joy. She was always
filled with a kind of sweet delirium of gaiety when the moon was
full, and always said she could not bear to spend an hour of that
time beneath a roof. She wanted to dance by the light of the
moon; to dance, bathed in moonbeams. That's interesting, you
know, for her mother was like that, and Diane was born in a
garden, by the light of the full moon.</p>
<p>"But Diane was not awaiting me in the garden. Nor on the
piazza.</p>
<p>"A man-servant showed me into the big empty drawing-room
through whose fresh windows came the scents and the light of the
glorious evening.</p>
<p>"I looked out and in my thoughts quoted,</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"'<i>If earth holds a haven of bliss<br>
It is this--it is this--it is this</i>.'</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>"Perhaps she would enter by one of these doors that opened on
the terrace.</p>
<p>"That starry sky, that sleeping sea below, that garden of
white light and black shadow--what a frame for my picture.</p>
<p>"I heard a sound behind me, and, turning about, saw her.</p>
<p>"'<i>Diane!</i>' I whispered.</p>
<p>"But this was not my Diane, the warm sweet living embodiment
of kindliness. This was a woman haughty and hard, cold and . . .
cruel.</p>
<p>"'How have you <i>dared</i> to come?' she said. 'How have you
dared? Are you mad . . . or shameless beyond belief?'</p>
<p>"'Diane!' I said. 'What have . . . ?'</p>
<p>"'I know <i>everything</i>,' she replied with an air of
terrible finality. 'Raoul returned from Monte Carlo this
afternoon, and I told him, as a delightful surprise--delightful,
mark you--that you were coming. The effect upon him was amazing,
terrible. I could feel that something awful, something ghastly
was wrong. . . . I felt as I felt that night when he was fighting
for his life at Sharia--that dreadful night when I knew that he
was in terrible danger.'</p>
<p>"'Yes . . . Diane . . . ?' I faltered.</p>
<p>"'I begged him to tell me. I implored him to tell me, and
though for a long time he refused, at last I wrung it from
him.</p>
<p>"'He told me everything.</p>
<p>"'You. . . . Oh, what <i>are</i> you? Words fail me. . . . To
write to me like that . . . after what had happened--and to
propose coming here. It was too late to communicate with you when
I'd wrung the truth from Raoul. Did you not get the message that
I left at your hotel, or have you ignored it?'</p>
<p>"'I received no message at the hotel, Diane,' I replied. 'I
was in too great haste to come.'</p>
<p>"'And now will you hasten to go,' cut in Diane with a voice of
ice, a face of marble, and a glance of steel.</p>
<p>"'But Diane,' I expostulated. 'Diane . . .' I begged.</p>
<p>"'<i>Go!</i>' she said, once more, pointing.</p>
<p>"'Diane. . . . But cannot you forgive him . . . ? I can. . . .
I do. . . . And if you cannot--why punish me? Was it my fault
that. . . .'</p>
<p>"'God give me patience,' cried this Diane whom I did not know,
and turned upon me like a tigress.</p>
<p>"'<i>Was it your fault?</i>' she mocked in a terrible
voice.</p>
<p>"'Was it <i>your</i> fault that you took his horse when he
risked his life to help you? Was it <i>your</i> fault that you
fired at him and then struck him down, as he ran beside the horse
on which he had put you?'</p>
<p>"I recoiled, aghast, stricken absolutely dumb.</p>
<p>"'I'll tell you what was <i>not</i> your fault, you . . . you
. . . snake. <i>It was not your fault that you missed him when
you tried to shoot him.</i> Now will you go . . . go <i>. . . go
. . .</i> before I shoot you myself?'</p>
<p>"And Diane darted across the room.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Yes . . . I realized that I must go. I must not let Diane
shoot me and bring terrible scandal, shame, and tragedy upon
herself.</p>
<p>"Besides, if that happened, the truth might come
out--certainly the truth that I had been found shot, from above,
through <i>képi,</i> head, and shoulder, obviously by someone
riding on a horse.</p>
<p>"Yes, I must go. For if nothing worse happened, I might, in my
weakness, misery and protesting agony of mind, myself tell her
the truth--show her my wounded head, demand to be confronted with
Raoul, force her to believe me, and in so doing--kill her. Kill
her happiness, most certainly.</p>
<p>"This I realized as Diane crossed the room--to ring a
bell.</p>
<p>"I walked out on to the terrace, out of the house. . . . Out
of Diane's life . . . out of my senses . . . into the moonlight .
. . into the moon-shadows.</p>

<p>"Didn't you once tell us that you killed Delacroix?" I

<p>We are told, on good authority, that Beauty is in the eye of
the beholder. It is at least equally true that Romance is in the
soul of the romantic. A profession, an institution, a situation,
an episode, a career, an event, a story, is romantic if the
romantic think it is.</p>
<p>For him or her whose soul is unromantic nothing is romantic,
and the world holds no romance.</p>
<p>To the romantically-minded person, the French Foreign Legion
is a romantic Regiment, especially if he does not happen to
belong to it. But even to some of its members the Legion is
romantic, though not, possibly, at all times and places, and not
during all its manifold incarnations, manifestations and
activities. Not, for example, when it is demonstrating as a gang
of road-mending navvies, labouring under almost intolerable
conditions and the eyes of non-commissioned officers who are
filling the rôle of slave-driving chain-gang overseers rather
than that of soldiers.</p>
<p>At such times it is not easy for the most deeply
romance-imbued young Romantic to say to himself,</p>
<p>"I am a Crusader, fighting for the spirit of civilization. I
am one of the Last of the Mercenaries. We are true lineal
descendants of the Legions of Rome who conquered the world for
Peace and made it safe for Aristocracy--in the true sense of All
That is Best."</p>
<p>It is easier for him to take the view that he is an incredibly
underpaid manual labourer doing the heaviest of unskilled work
with the lightest of recompense; and to ask himself why (if he
must be an unskilled manual labourer) he does not labour in his
own country for a hundred times the pay and a thousand times the
comfort and amenities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 2</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Trade follows the flag.</p>
<p>Roads follow the Legion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A Company of the Legion, rifles and bayonets laid aside, was
labouring with pick and shovel--just a gang of assorted foreign
workmen, no longer smart soldiers; completely shorn of all
martial pomp and glory, might, majesty and power; and with
nothing whatsoever of military circumstance, save the iron
military discipline that kept them unflaggingly and unceasingly
at their heavy, back-breaking, heart-breaking, soul-breaking
toil, the doing of so very much for so very little.</p>
<p>There were men among them of almost all ages from sixteen to
sixty; of almost all social grades from scavenger to titled,
once-wealthy, once-landed ex-Colonel of Cavalry; of almost all
countries of Europe, from Scotland to Bulgaria, and of all
continents from America to Australia.</p>
<p>The utterly heterogeneous become completely homogeneous: they
who had been almost all things and all men in all countries, now
one and undistinguishable--the road-gang.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And yet not wholly undistinguishable one from another.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Slowly and carefully (as, gratefully, men straightened their
backs, stood up, and stood aside) a large dust-covered
touring-car made its way along the less-uninviting side of the
broken road that had been hastily called into existence by the
exigencies of war--and almost blotted out of existence by the
passage of the engines of war, heavy guns and lorries, and the
toiling feet and hooves of tens of thousands of men and horses,
mules and cattle.</p>
<p>Near the end of the long line of the labouring road-gang, the
car came almost to a standstill as its driver cautiously made his
careful way between a great mound of road metal and the edge of
the deep road-side ditch.</p>
<p>It was not his habit to display the virtue of patience, nor to
exercise caution, but the occasion was special, for one of his
passengers was a lady of rank and fashion, the widow of a
distinguished French General, and the other was an elderly
priest, a member of that noble and justly famous Order, known
across Northern Africa as The White Fathers.</p>
<p>The town-Arab chauffeur had no particular use or admiration
for Christian priests or Generals' widows, but these particular
passengers had been committed to his charge by the owner of the
car, with the firm and certain assurance that if anything
untoward befell them through fault of the chauffeur, he would,
upon his return, lose his life, his health, his job, and his
wages for the trip.</p>
<p>So he passed the dangerous place at the lowest speed of which
the car was capable, and gave the man who was in his way time to
step out of his way, and also gave the lady time to see the man's
face . . . time to look at it again, to recognize it, to rise
quickly to her feet, to extend a hand, to call a name, and
quickly sit down again, trembling.</p>
<p>The chauffeur half turned his head, and glanced behind
him.</p>
<p>"Drive on, drive on," she said.</p>
<p>Laying his hand, that suggested a withered leaf and also an
ancient Japanese carving, over that of the agitated excited
woman.</p>
<p>"Was that he, my daughter?" the priest inquired.</p>
<p>"Yes, Father, yes, it was. . . . God be thanked. . . . It was
Lucien . . . Lucien himself. . . . I knew him instantly."</p>
<p>"You are sure? Perfectly sure . . . after all these
years?"</p>
<p>"Certain, Father. Absolutely certain. His face has hardly
changed, only aged. . . . I could pick him out from an army, from
a million. . . . Oh, my poor Lucien. . . . If only I had changed
as little . . ."</p>
<p>The priest made no reply, though there had been a time when he
would (quite truthfully) have told her that she was still a
beautiful woman, and, for him at least, had not changed in a
quarter of a century.</p>
<p>"Stop for a minute," the woman bade the chauffeur, as the car
turned a bend in the road, and rising ground hid the road-gang
from sight.</p>
<p>"Are you sure this man understands no French?" she asked the
priest in English.</p>
<p>"Quite certain," was the reply. "Beyond <i>Oui, Monsieur; Non,
Monsieur; Pourboire,</i> and <i>Merci;</i> he knows no more
French than you do Arabic. We can talk freely before him.</p>
<p>"And behind him," he added with the whimsical smile that so
frequently lighted and beautified his face.</p>
<p>"I have found Lucien," murmured his companion. "What shall I
do now? Advise me, Father. Help me. Surely the end justifies the
means. Think what he has suffered . . . for all these years . . .
an innocent man. . . . And he loved me."</p>
<p>"And you found that you loved him--after he'd gone away?"
mused the priest.</p>
<p>"Yes . . . and loathed him . . . for what I thought he had
done. . . . Loved Lucien so much that I married Delacroix--to
show myself how much I did not love Lucien. . . . And Raoul's
dying confession showed that, instead of Lucien being the
murderer, he was the victim. . . . And a generous hero. . . . Oh,
Raoul, Raoul. . . ."</p>
<p>And the woman broke down and wept.</p>
<p>The old priest comforted her as best he could.</p>
<p>"Oh, the wasted lives," she sobbed.</p>
<p>"Better to have led his life--than Raoul's," said the
priest.</p>
<p>"Oh, Lucien's ruined, wasted life . . . and mine. . . ."</p>
<p>"No life is wasted; nothing is wasted," said the priest. "All
things are ordained by . . ."</p>
<p>"Then it was ordained that I should find him," interrupted the
woman. "Find him and save him . . . and make the little
restitution I can for what Raoul . . . and I . . . did to
him.</p>
<p>"Think of what he has suffered, Father. And think of what I
have suffered since poor dying Raoul's letter of confession came
to me, and my husband would not help me in my search for Lucien.
. . . Since my husband's death I must have seen the face of
almost every soldier in the Foreign Legion, in every part of the
French Empire. . . . Lucien left no word, no name, no trace.</p>
<p>"It was Raoul's last letter that gave me this idea. He
said,</p>
<p>"'If Lucien is alive, which is unlikely, he'll be in the
Foreign Legion.'</p>
<p>"Father, you'll help me to save him. . . ."</p>
<p>"'To do a great right, do a little wrong,' eh, my poor child?
No, it's no part of our work here in Africa to help soldiers to
desert from the Army of Occupation that is conquering heathendom
for civilization, and for Christ."</p>
<p>"But, Father, the circumstances. . . ."</p>
<p>"Yes, circumstances alter cases, I know, my child. . . . But
I'm not going to help the case to alter the circumstances.
Besides, are you sure that this man, once an Officer--and once an
Officer of the Legion, too--would consent to be 'saved'? I doubt
whether he would desert. . . ."</p>
<p>"It would be so simple, so comparatively easy. A swift
powerful car, as near as possible to his <i>poste;</i> he on
sentry-duty, one dark night; civilian clothes, money, passport,
papers. . . . We should just be tourists. I see no obstacle that
cannot . . ."</p>
<p>"I do," said the Father. "The man himself. He wouldn't
consent. He wouldn't do it."</p>
<p>"He would for me, Father."</p>
<p>"Not even for you, my daughter.</p>
<p>"Not even for Diane," he breathed.</p>
<p>"You refuse to help me--and Lucien?"</p>
<p>"No, I do not refuse to help you--and Lucien. . . . For you,
because I have always loved you; for Lucien, because he deserves
it; for myself, because it is a duty as well as my greatest
pleasure, I will do anything in the world--that my conscience
permits--to help you both. . . . Should I be here, at this
moment, were I not more than anxious to help you? . . .</p>
<p>"As for Lucien, I will visit him, talk to him, tell him
everything, try to express to him my admiration of his noble
conduct and his noble silence, give him any message from you, see
his Officer and try to arrange for a meeting between you and
Lucien . . . do anything, as I say, that is permissible,
above-board and lawful. But I won't help him to desert, nor
connive at his desertion. I won't be a party to it. In fact, my
dear, if anything of the sort should be contemplated, don't tell
me about it, for I warn you that, if I came to know that it was
being planned, I should . . . do my duty."</p>
<p>The woman sighed.</p>
<p>"The end and the means," she murmured.</p>
<p>"Wretched sophistry, my daughter. The end never justifies the
means--if the means are wrong. Isn't it perfectly clear and
obvious that if the means are wrong--they are <i>wrong</i>? . . .
And while I wear this dress, I will not deliberately and
consciously set my hand, or give my consent, to anything I know
to be wrong."</p>
<p>The woman sighed again.</p>
<p>"Will you get a letter to him for me?" she asked. "At the
earliest possible moment. He looks so ill . . . and I am so
afraid. Think if I lost him now . . . <i>now</i> . . . in the
hour of finding him after all these years of search. Will you get
a letter to him, Father? Now . . . to-day . . . to-morrow, at the
latest?"</p>
<p>"Of course I will, my dear child," replied the priest,
"provided you give me your word that it contains no plans of
escape or arrangements for desertion. I won't carry any letter
containing an incitement to crime, making myself an 'accessory
before the fact' of crime."</p>
<p>"Crime, Father?"</p>
<p>"Desertion is a crime, my dear. Punishable, in some
circumstances, by death: in others, by a long term of
imprisonment. And rightly so."</p>
<p>The woman's hardly-won composure broke down.</p>
<p>"Oh, you men," she cried. "Even you good men.
<i>Especially</i> you good men!</p>
<p>"Father, cannot you see that I must and will save Lucien?
Cannot you understand that . . . ?"</p>
<p>"And cannot you trust in God, my dear? Cannot you see and
understand that whatever <i>is,</i> is best; because the fact
that it <i>is,</i> proves that it is God's inscrutable purpose
that it should be? Your Lucien is in God's hands, and he will
save him--or take him--in his own way, and in his own good
time."</p>
<p>The woman, with a gesture and a look that curiously combined
resignation and impatience, with almost a suggestion of
controlled anger, said:</p>
<p>"You will give him a letter, anyhow?"</p>
<p>"Most certainly I will."</p>
<p>"Thank you a thousand times, my dear Father.</p>
<p>"For even the good God needs instruments in the carrying out
of His inscrutable purposes," she added.</p>
<p>If there were the faintest <i>soupçon</i> of a flavour of
bitterness in her voice and of subtlety in her smile, as she
referred to the letter and God's need of an instrument, it was
unnoticed by the simple and single-minded priest.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">II</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The instruments chosen by God for the release of
Lucien--better known to his comrades as La Cigale--were strange
ones.</p>
<p>Young Fat'ma, undesired and uncherished daughter of Yakoub Ali
ben Abdul Hassan, known as El Wazir ed Dimiryat, of the fierce
fighting-tribe of the Beni Baggarani, was a merry lass, a great
flirt, a person of character (not all bad) and, at the age of
fifteen, a woman who knew her own mind.</p>
<p>That her father had ceased from beating her when she had made
an almost successful attempt to kill him, upon the last occasion
of his so doing, accounts for some of her merriness, much of her
freedom, and all of her outrageously flirtatious conduct with
young Ibrahim ben Ghulam Mahommed, a budding warrior of sixteen
years and the neighbouring hill-village, a <i>ksar</i> of some
strength and importance.</p>
<p>When a boy of the Beni Baggarani is big enough to walk beneath
the weight of a rifle, and strong enough to lift it to his
shoulder, he at once and automatically attains the status of
warrior, and becomes a member of the fighting forces of the
tribe, enrolled as such "with the rank and pay of a sapper,"
infantry soldier, scout, sharpshooter, raider, rifleman, sniper,
camel-corps guide, and, if he be lucky, mounted-infantry trooper,
cavalryman, lancer and hussar, as well.</p>
<p>Hitherto, Ibrahim ben Ghulam Mahommed had not been lucky, and
his war-like excursions and alarums had been confined to the
guarding of tribal flocks and herds of sheep and goats, with a
gun longer than himself and even more dangerous--to himself. This
archaic weapon, of greater interest and value to a collector than
to a warrior, had undoubtedly fired real bullets with real
powder, and at a real enemy--to wit, Kirk's Lambs, the famous
Regiment that defended Tangier until brought to England to defend
the honour and life of His Majesty King James II instead; and to
decimate the countryside, after the Battle of Sedgemoor and
before the Bloody Assize of Judge Jeffreys of glorious
memory.</p>
<p>Since the Siege of Tangier, and during the slow passage of
some two and a half centuries, the gun had declined in
usefulness, if not in value; until Ibrahim knew, and the
tribesmen knew, that whatever else you might do with the gun, you
couldn't fire it. Save with a suicidal purpose, that is to say;
for, if fired, it would assuredly burst and undoubtedly disperse
the features of the face and the fingers of the hand of the fool
who fired it.</p>
<p>Thus, although Ibrahim loved his gun, with its inlaid
worm-eaten butt, exactly resembling in size and shape that of a
billiard cue, and although he was as brave as a lion, he dared
not fire it.</p>
<p>He would pour his home-made gunpowder (ground-up charcoal,
sulphur and saltpetre, with a sprinkling of stolen cordite and
other high mysteries and explosives) from his ram's-horn
powder-flask into its bell mouth, and down its five feet of
fairly straight iron barrel, until it reached the rusty end of
its journey, and the large hole that opened into the little
lidded pan, at that part. He would then wedge a stout tuft of
sheep's wool into the cleft head of the long slow "hammer" that
could be brought down to the pan by manipulation, careful and
patient, of its latter end, which protruded trigger-wise beneath
the gun.</p>
<p>He would open the lid of the pan, put yet more of the precious
powder therein, close the lid, sling the gun across his shoulder,
and make a ferocious grin of fierce defiance against imaginary
foeman. He would then refuse to entertain the sad and bitter
thought that nothing on earth would induce him to level the gun
at an approaching enemy, open the lid of the pan, set fire to the
oiled wool, waggle the trigger end of the hammer until its
depressed and fiery head reached the exposed powder, look along
the non-existent sights and, until something happened, put all
his trust in Allah, as he could put none in the gun.</p>
<p>No, not even for Fat'ma could it be done.</p>
<p>Ibrahim ben Ghulam Mahommed was not going to appear at the
Gates of Paradise with his face blown off, and be unrecognizable
to the Prophet for the good Mussulman that he was. Not even for
the greater honour and glory of Ibrahim ben Ghulam Mahommed and
the establishment of his name and fame as a warrior who had
killed his man, won his spurs and established his position.</p>
<p>No, not for honour. Not for a brace of pacing camels. Not even
for a war-horse. Certainly not for a woman. Let Fat'ma chaff and
jeer and gibe and taunt as she might.</p>
<p>And these things Fat'ma did unmercifully.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Be your woman? <i>Yours?</i> Allah! Since when have little
boys . . . ?"</p>
<p>"Am I not a warrior? Do I not defend the flocks? Do I not take
my turn as watchman and sentinel? Do I not go on <i>razzia</i>
with the men?"</p>
<p>"Yes, the boy goes with the men, sometimes. I don't say boys
are not useful. So are horses and mules and camels--and women,"
scoffed Fat'ma.</p>
<p>"Do I not carry a gun?" expostulated the youthful Ibrahim.</p>
<p>"A gun? Is that thing you carry a gun? Oh? I thought it was a
hoe, or a <i>huqua,</i> or a staff, or a tentpole, or
something."</p>
<p>"The sort of thing that an ignorant woman would think! Know
that it is a gun that has been borne to the certain knowledge of
my family, by all my fathers, from the days of the
great-great-grandsire of my great-grandfather's
great-grandfather."</p>
<p>"Allah! How great, and how many greats!" murmured Fat'ma. "And
will it go off bang?"</p>
<p>"What do you suppose guns do, my good Fat'ma?"</p>
<p>"I wasn't talking of guns, my good Ibrahim, but of
that--er--great-great-gun."</p>
<p>"Of course it will, foolish girl."</p>
<p>"Would you fire it, foolish boy, or aren't you quite so
foolish?"</p>
<p>"What a question? Of course I would."</p>
<p>"In the <i>lab-el-baroda,</i> without a bullet?"</p>
<p>"No, in battle, with a bullet."</p>
<p>"Would it kill a lion?"</p>
<p>"Undoubtedly."</p>
<p>"Then go and kill one, and bring me its skin."</p>
<p>"Will you be my woman, if I do?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps . . . perhaps not . . . when you're grown up. . . .
Would it kill a man?"</p>
<p>"Of course it would."</p>
<p>"A hell-doomed accursed Frenchman?"</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"Because you wouldn't give it the chance. You dare not. You'd
be afraid of both the Frenchman and the gun."</p>
<p>"Oh?"</p>
<p>"Well, would you fire it at a Frenchman?"</p>
<p>"Undoubtedly."</p>
<p>"Then go and kill one, and bring me his skin."</p>
<p>"Will you be my woman if I do?"</p>
<p>"Yes. For then you would be grown up. Then you would be a
man."</p>
<p>"I'm as much a man as you are a woman, anyhow," asserted
Ibrahim, with an angry and ugly scowl.</p>
<p>Fat'ma laughed merrily.</p>
<p>"Go and mind the sheep, then, little man, and mind the
Frenchman doesn't get them--or you."</p>
<p>Muttering a real curse into an imaginary beard, the goaded
Ibrahim sprang to his feet.</p>
<p>"Look here, talker," quoth he. "If I bring you a French
soldier's <i>képi</i> and buttons for a betrothal gift, will you
be my woman?"</p>
<p>"What! are you going on a journey, Ibrahim?" asked Fat'ma in
innocent wide-eyed surprise.</p>
<p>"To a little Jew's little shop in the little <i>mellah</i> of
a little town?" she added with a maddening titter.</p>
<p>"Oh, you laugh, do you?" growled Ibrahim. "And suppose I bring
the buttons <i>on</i> the coat--and the coat is wet with blood;
warm with blood?"</p>
<p>"Going to kill a kid, Ibrahim?" inquired Fat'ma.</p>
<p>Ibrahim gnashed his teeth.</p>
<p>"I may do, yet," quoth he, "and its name may be Fat'ma,
daughter of Yakoub Ali ben Abdul Hassan."</p>
<p>"Oh, you call my father a goat, do you? . . . That <i>will</i>
please him."</p>
<p>Ibrahim departed thence, strong but not silent, though his
speech was incoherent.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>La Cigale, on his turn of sentry duty from two a.m. to four
a.m., stood at his post and stared watchfully out across the
rocky plain that stretched to the not-distant rocky hills that
lay at the foot of the great towering mountains, apparently all
carved from that same solid rock.</p>
<p>No better sentry and no better soldier than La Cigale, doing
nothing with eye-service as men-pleasers, but as unto his god of
Duty, his oath of allegiance, his unbending uncompromising
military conscience.</p>
<p>Once a man of the world, of spacious life, wide range and
innumerable interests, the catastrophe that had ruined his life,
killed his ambition, and wrecked his mind and body, had reduced
and concentrated his remaining interests and abilities to the
exact performance of the duties of a private soldier.</p>
<p>An audible groan escaped him, as he stood watchful and
wary.</p>
<p>"I can't! I can't!" he whispered to the moon-lit silent night.
"How can I desert my post? I could as easily commit a theft or a
murder. If I cease to be a good soldier, I cease to be anything
at all. Desert my post? . . . Almost in the very presence of the
enemy?</p>
<p>"Suppose an attack were made . . .</p>
<p>"And suppose no attack is made, the principle is the same. . .
. Betrayal of trust. . . . Failure in the one remaining thing
that I am fit and competent to do. I've never failed in my duty
yet--from wilful fault or negligence, at least.</p>
<p>"Desert my regiment? . . . Lucien de la Haye de Milvorde de
Brabant a <i>deserter!</i> Last of perhaps the oldest military
family in Europe. Last of my line--and first of my kind--a
deserter. It would be bad enough if I were a Frenchman. . . . But
to disgrace my country as well as myself. . . . I can hear our
Captain Dupont, that <i>canaille</i> from the gutter--</p>
<p>'<i>Huh! Another Belgian deserter. These damned Belgians are
no good.</i>'</p>
<p>"How can I desert my regiment and the flag--with its motto
'<i>Honneur et Fidélité</i>' that I have chosen and followed?
Have I now neither honour nor fidelity? . . . How can I desert?
How can I? . . .</p>
<p>"Diane!</p>
<p>"Diane waiting for me there.</p>
<p>"Diane waiting for <i>me.</i> Waiting through the night. How
can I ignore her? How can I? . . . I <i>must</i> see her . . .
speak to her.</p>
<p>"And if I do, I shall weaken and fail. I shall give in. I
shall desert. I owe it to her to do so. Think how she has
suffered since Raoul confessed . . . suffered for him . . .
suffered for me. It would be ungenerous to refuse her the
happiness of making me happy. . . ."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Moving like a ghost in the shadows, an unarmed soldier crept
to La Cigale's side.</p>
<p>"<i>Sst!</i> Give me your rifle," he whispered, "and, for
God's sake be back before <i>appel</i>."</p>
<p>La Cigale handed his comrade his rifle and fixed bayonet.</p>
<p>Drawing a deep breath.</p>
<p>"I'll be back," he said, "before moon-set--long before Relief.
Have no fear. . . . And God reward you."</p>
<p>The soldier patted La Cigale on the back.</p>
<p>"<i>Bonne chance, mon gars</i>," he said, and anxiously
watched his comrade climb through the embrasure, down the rough
face of the low wall, and into the black shadow that it threw
upon the rocky ground beneath.</p>
<p>"Shan't see <i>him</i> again," mused the self-appointed
sentry, "and good luck to him, poor devil. . . .</p>
<p>"And eight days' solitary for me," he added ruefully.</p>
<p>For an hour the man paced his beat, from time to time halting
to stare out across the plain or to peer anxiously down into the
shadows below the wall.</p>
<p>"Couldn't expect him to come back," he mused. "Why should he?
And yet I never knew him tell a lie or play a trick before. But
then, he never had such a temptation before. . . . Poor, poor
devil. . . .</p>
<p>"Wonder if he ever told his story to anyone but me. . . .
Wonder if he'll recover. . . . Wonder if she'll make him happy.
Wonder if he'll take his name and rank and place in the world
again. He could. No one would ever know that Monsieur le Comte de
Don't-know-who was the half-wit, La Cigale, who deserted from the
Legion.</p>
<p>"And yet, somehow, I don't see La Cigale deserting. But then
the circumstances. . . . And the woman. . . . I should do it. . .
. And I should think she'd kidnap him, if he wouldn't come
quietly.</p>
<p>"And yet La Cigale gave me his solemn word that if I'd do
this, he'd come back before I was caught helping him to get
away.</p>
<p>"No, it's too much to expect . . . in the circumstances. But
wasn't it like La Cigale to get a substitute, instead of leaving
his post vacant!</p>
<p>"No . . . we shan't see him again--and how I shall miss him.
Gentlemen aren't so common, nowadays, in the Legion--or out of
it."</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 2</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"<i>Diane! . . .</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Lucien!</i> . . ."</p>
<p>The woman sprang from the car and ran toward where a man in
the uniform of the French Foreign Legion climbed up on to the
road.</p>
<p>"<i>Oh, Diane! Diane!</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Oh, my poor, poor Lucien!</i>"</p>
<p>A long, long silence, as the man took the woman in his arms,
clasped her to his breast, and strained her to him with all his
strength--the strength of the pent-up passion and pain of past
years; a mighty strength, yet all too weak for the woman who now
so gladly would have died for him; and who had been cheated--like
the man--of the glory and the grace, the passion and the power,
of the love that had been theirs, of the life they might have
had.</p>
<p>"Come, Lucien, my love, my heart, my life. . . ."</p>
<p>The man's fine and strong, yet delicate, face set hard. In the
moonlight it looked as though of carven marble, the face of the
effigy of a crusader on a tomb.</p>
<p>"Good-bye . . . Diane. . . ."</p>
<p><i>Good-bye?</i></p>
<p>"Good-bye."</p>
<p>"<i>Lucien?</i>"</p>
<p>"I cannot desert my post. I could not be here now, but that it
is well filled, Diane."</p>
<p>"Lucien! You don't . . . ? You don't love me?"</p>
<p>"Diane, you know . . . you know. . . . Nay, you <i>cannot</i>
know how I love you."</p>
<p>"Then, Lucien . . . ?"</p>
<p>"Diane, I'm a soldier--the poorest, lowest soldier. But . . .
Diane, you couldn't love a <i>deserter.</i> There is a man
waiting for me now. But for him I could not . . . Diane, you
couldn't love a liar and a trickster? I gave him my word. And I
gave France my signed promise. <i>Honneur et Fidélité</i>."</p>
<p>"Lucien!"</p>
<p>"Diane, how could I? Would you let me?"</p>
<p>"But you can send the man money, compensate him a
thousandfold. We can make him rich. Make him thank God you broke
your word to him. . . . Lucien. . . ."</p>
<p>"And my word to France, Diane?"</p>
<p>"Cannot France get ten thousand more for the asking? Without
asking? Isn't cannon-fodder cheap and plentiful enough--that
<i>you</i> should . . . ?"</p>
<p>"It isn't a question of the tricked man, nor of France, Diane.
It is a question of myself. It is not what they are, or want; it
is what I am, and want. Am I a liar and a trickster--to the man?
Am I a deserter and traitor--to France? Do I want to come to you
. . . soiled, spoiled, unclean?"</p>
<p>"Lucien. . . . What do I care how you come to me? As though
<i>you</i> could ever be unclean. And haven't you given the best
years of your life to France?"</p>
<p>"Diane, there is another thing."</p>
<p>The woman stepped back, removing her arms from about her
lover's neck, her hands coming to rest upon his shoulders.</p>
<p>"We'll overcome that, too, my Lucien."</p>
<p>"Diane, I'm going mad. At times I am completely mad. Each
period lasts longer. Soon I shall be permanently and completely .
. ."</p>
<p>The woman laughed aloud.</p>
<p>"My Lucien," she murmured, and drew his face down to hers,
closing his lips with hers.</p>
<p>"Oh, my poor Lucien. With me you shall know only the madness
of love. . . . My Lucien. . . ."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"How long we have been here! Come, Lucien, the moon is
setting."</p>
<p>The man glanced at the moon, showing clear of the distant
mountain-tops, kissed the woman tenderly on the lips, rose to his
feet, and fled. Fled, as though pursued by wolves, by foes, by
fiends from Hell. . . .</p>
<p>Anon he broke into the long steady <i>pas gymnastique</i> of
the Legion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A loud explosion--like the bursting of a bomb.</p>
<p>La Cigale, soldier instinctive, sprang behind a rock.</p>
<p>Dead silence.</p>
<p>Cautiously and skilfully reconnoitring forward to the spot
whence the sound had appeared to come, he found the body of an
Arab, a beardless youth, who lay apparently dead, a great gun
across him.</p>
<p>"Poor devil," murmured La Cigale. "Gun burst at the breech and
. . . Wonder if he's dead. Don't see what one can do for him.
Haven't even got a water-bottle."</p>
<p>La Cigale straightened himself up--and felt a hideous searing
pain--a tremendous blow from behind.</p>
<p>With a cry and a stagger, he turned about as he fell . . . and
saw an Arab . . . girl.</p>
<p>"Ibrahim!" shrieked Fat'ma. "Ibrahim!"</p>
<p>And stabbed again.</p>
<p>La Cigale's head fell back, his glazing eyes beholding the
moon.</p>
<p>"Thank you," he said, smiling at the girl. "I <i>thank</i>
you."</p>
<p>And died.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The moon set.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 1</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Except when, with solemn countenance and serious voice, old
Tant de Soif was deliberately pulling the leg of a <i>bleu,</i>
or ragging Père Poussin, he was, for an old soldier, a remarkably
truthful man.</p>
<p>Undeniably, some of his stories were almost incredible, but
then old Tant de Soif had undoubtedly had some almost incredible
experiences in the course of his long and varied military service
in Cochin China, Madagascar, the Sahara, Morocco and Dahomey.</p>
<p>The most astounding story of all, concerned the last-named
country, for Tant de Soif had served in the horrible Dahomeyan
campaign.</p>
<p>So strange and so interesting was the story, and such was Tant
de Soif's warmth of asseveration as to its truth and his own
personal friendship with Captain Battreau, that I was at pains to
verify it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tant de Soif's amazing story is not fiction, but unadorned
recorded fact which can be verified by reference to French
newspaper files of 1891.</p>
<p>It is one of the most astounding examples of the aptness of
the old saw, <i>Truth is stranger than fiction.</i></p>
<p>Any writer of fiction who had the courage to use this incident
in a novel, would inevitably be laughed to scorn by the wise and
learned men who reviewed his book.</p>
<p>The story begins in the year 1870, when the Hun was ravaging
France, Paris was besieged, and its inhabitants thankful to be
able to buy the flesh of cats, rats and mice at fabulous
prices.</p>
<p>As in 1914, every Frenchman who could bear arms was fighting
to save his beloved country and to drive the loathed invader from
its sacred soil. Young boys and old men marched and fought beside
those of military age. Among the first was a boy named Battreau,
a burning patriot and a keen and ardent soldier, who quickly rose
to the rank of Sergeant.</p>
<p>Battreau was the Happy Warrior</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"<i>that every man in arms should wish to
be</i>",</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-indent: 0em;">for his profession was his hobby, he
loved his work, and this campaign was to him a Crusade and a Holy
War. Unlike the majority of soldiers, especially those of a
conscript army, he positively enjoyed drill, and regarded his
Chassepôt rifle rather as a pet or a beloved comrade than as a
heavy encumbrance and a beastly thing that he had to sweat over,
and keep speckless.</p>
<p>If ever young Battreau got a punishment, which is improbable,
it was certainly not for having a dirty gun. To him indeed was
applicable the saying that "A soldier's best friend is his
rifle."</p>
<p>Curiously enough, the number of Battreau's gun was 1870, and
17 his own age--187017, a number easily remembered and one that
he never forgot. And Private Battreau did more than love and
polish and treasure his beautiful new gun; he used it to some
purpose, for he proved, even from his recruit days, to be an
exceptionally fine shot.</p>
<p>According to those who knew him, Battreau, although a keen
soldier, was anything but bloodthirsty, and it was not in a
revengeful spirit of murderous triumph that he recorded on the
butt of 187017 the number of Germans who, to his certain
knowledge, he killed with it.</p>
<p>No doubt he shot many more than his tally showed, but
whenever, in single combat or when sniping, he killed his man, he
drove a tiny tack or shoe "brad" a little way into the butt of
his rifle, and then pulled it out again.</p>
<p>What with its number, composed of the date of the year and his
own age, and the neat row of tiny holes in the stock, it was not
likely that Private Battreau, Corporal Battreau, Sergeant
Battreau, would have any difficulty in identifying his rifle
among a number of others, or in recovering it from any comrade
who "scrounged", "found" or "won" it when its owner's back was
turned.</p>
<p>And at St. Privat, during the terrible battle of Gravelotte,
the gun received an honourable scar, a decoration that would have
enabled its owner to identify it among a thousand others, even
had he been blind.</p>
<p>For when the famous and magnificent Prussian Guard charged the
French position and was repulsed with tremendous slaughter,
Battreau, suddenly feeling a jarring shock and a blow that nearly
knocked him down, found that a German bullet had passed clean
through the stock of his rifle.</p>
<p>As neatly as though the work had been done by a cabinet-maker
or a highly skilled carpenter, a smooth, clean hole had been
drilled through the butt of 187017.</p>
<p>His beloved gun, that had killed so many of the enemies of his
adored country, had saved his life, for the bullet, in passing
through the thick wood, had lost so much of its velocity that
when it struck Battreau's heavy leather pouch and belt, it failed
to penetrate to his body, and merely knocked him backward, with
no greater injury than a severe bruise.</p>
<p>Is it to be wondered at, that Battreau's affection for his
rifle was increased immeasurably, and that he would scarcely have
parted with it for its weight in gold?</p>
<p>Throughout the remainder of the Franco-Prussian War, Sergeant
Battreau served and suffered, starved, frozen, ragged, often sick
and weary unto death, but with 187017 still upon his shoulder, as
he marched the long, long roads of France.</p>
<p>At the end of the campaign he was alive, unwounded, and
determined to remain in the army as a professional soldier. One
can imagine the pride he took in his curiously decorated rifle,
and the number of times that he told the story of how it got the
hole in its butt and saved its owner's life.</p>
<p>One can also imagine the regret with which Sergeant Battreau
parted with this "best friend" when the French Army discarded the
Chassepôt gun and was re-armed with the Gras rifle.</p>
<p>Poor Battreau made application to be permitted to keep 187017
as his personal property, but his request was refused. Red tape
is red tape, and is nowhere ruddier that in the French Army.</p>
<p>How could the French Republic be expected to lose the few
francs, or even sous, that an old discarded gun might yet be
worth, and give it to the man who had carried it so long, fought
with it so bravely, and killed so many of the Republic's
enemies?</p>
<p>Could not Sergeant Battreau be permitted to buy it from Madame
la République at its original cost, or more?</p>
<p>Certainly not, replied the Red-Tape-Worms of the War Office.
Whoever heard of such a thing as Madame la République trafficking
in old iron? The rifle must be returned to store at once, and
with no more idiotic applications from presumptuous and
half-witted sergeants.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>But traffic in old iron Madame la République undoubtedly did,
and sold the whole discarded consignment to a syndicate of those
Christian patriots who supply the ignorant, barbarous and
comparatively harmless savage with weapons of precision wherewith
he may fight the fellow-countrymen of the said Christian
patriots, or slay his brother with greater facility and
despatch.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 2</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The scene is changed--also the date.</p>
<p>It is now the year 1891, and a small French force, headed as
usual by a detachment of the French Foreign Legion, is making its
way from Porto Novo, in the Bight of Benin on the West Coast of
Africa, up the left bank of the river Oueme, with the high hope,
firm intention, and moderate chance, of reaching Abomey, the
capital of Behanzin, King of Dahomey.</p>
<p>With this detachment of the French Foreign Legion was one
Captain Battreau, formerly a Sergeant of the Line and now a
distinguished officer of the Legion.</p>
<p>Of all Captain Battreau's military experience, this campaign
was the worst.</p>
<p>As frequently happens in war, <i>the</i> enemy was almost the
least of the enemies to be fought: and whenever the Dahomeyans
attacked the little expeditionary force on the march, or in the
perimeter camps of their halting-places, they were regarded
rather as an added nuisance than as the dangerous and murderous
enemy that they were.</p>
<p>Far worse than these savages were the terrible heat; the
vitiated, steam-laden air; the stifling gloom of the dense
impenetrable jungle; virulent malignant fever; the agonizing
labour of hacking their way through dense pathless jungle at the
rate of three miles a day; and almost unbearable thirst.</p>
<p>The torture of thirst was not rendered easier to bear by the
knowledge that the force was advancing parallel to the bank of a
great river. Although this was only a few miles away, it was as
inaccessible, owing to impenetrable jungle, as if it had been in
another continent.</p>
<p>On many a day the force would struggle for hours to cross a
mangrove swamp so water-logged and swollen that it was almost
impassable, and yet as devoid of visible water as any desert.
Here water was an enemy, and, turning the ground beneath their
feet into slimy mud, but added to their sufferings.</p>
<p>Nor was the force allowed, as Captain Battreau humorously
remarked, to fight in peace--to fight its way through the
terrible swamps and jungle where the overhead foliage was so
dense that the rays of the sun never penetrated it.</p>
<p>Without the faintest warning, and at any place or moment,
thousands of silent shadows would suddenly materialize from the
surrounding jungle, and swoop like hawks upon their prey, each
shadow a tall savage armed with slashing <i>coupe-coupe</i> (or
<i>machête</i>), sword and spear. Or the heavy boding silence of
the jungle would be shattered by sudden volleys, and from both
flanks a heavy fire would be poured in, at short range, upon the
struggling men hacking their way in the thick bush or stifling
elephant grass in which they worked blindfold, swallowed up like
dogs in a cornfield.</p>
<p>At night, too, when the weary force sank to the ground, too
exhausted to eat, there was little rest, for, in addition to
constant heavy sniping, most determined attacks were made by
innumerable hordes of spearmen, outnumbering the French by
thousands.</p>
<p>As usual, whatever the sufferings of the other units, those of
the Legion were greater; for they were in the van; they blazed
the trail, they bore the brunt of the frontal attacks, and to
them fell the lion's share of camp and water fatigues, and picket
and outpost duty.</p>
<p>Always to the fore, leading, encouraging and heartening his
splendid <i>légionnaires,</i> was Captain Battreau, admired,
beloved and trusted by his Company, every man of whom knew him to
be a better soldier than himself, a man whose word was "Come on"
rather than "Go on", first in the fight and last to lie down in
camp, as careless of his own life as he was careful of those of
his men.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>And one day happened the incredible thing, the impossible
event, the fact far stranger than any fancy.</p>
<p>The Legion advance-guard, debouching suddenly from the
terrible, gloomy jungle, entered an open glade or savannah, and
simultaneously came under a tremendously heavy fire from a force
completely concealed in the thick bush opposite.</p>
<p>"Come on, boys!" yelled Captain Battreau. "Into them with the
bayonet!" and, drawing his revolver, he led the charge of his
weary, thirsty, half-starved men, across the open.</p>
<p>The Dahomeyans stood fast, and in a few moments spear clashed
on bayonet, and a fierce hand-to-hand struggle took place.</p>
<p>As Captain Battreau, leading, rushed at a tall Dahomeyan, who
had just re-loaded his rifle, the savage threw it forward and
fired at Battreau point-blank. As he did so, Battreau pulled the
trigger of his revolver, and both men fell to the ground, the
Dahomeyan with the revolver bullet through his heart, Battreau
untouched.</p>
<p>As he himself afterwards said, he had not the faintest idea as
to whether he flung himself down when he saw the muzzle of a
rifle pointing straight at his face, or whether he tripped over a
tussock of grass, or some such obstacle.</p>
<p>What he did know was that, as he arose, slightly stunned by
the explosion, so close to his face, of the heavy rifle, he saw
with no small surprise, that the rifle lying at his feet was a
French Chassepôt, complete with bayonet.</p>
<p>Snatching it up as an excellent weapon for use in the
hand-to-hand rough-and-tumble into which he was about to dash,
his eye fell upon something the sight of which gave him pause,
even in that moment of strenuous excitement.</p>
<p>There was a hole through the butt of the rifle!</p>
<p>Swiftly turning it over, Captain Battreau read the number. It
was 187017. In the stock was a neat row of tiny holes.</p>
<p><i>In Captain Battreau's hand was his own rifle</i>--the rifle
with which he had fought throughout the Franco-Prussian War of
1870.</p>
<p>For a moment the noise of battle all about him was that of
Gravelotte, and the fall from which he had just risen was that
caused by the blow of a Prussian bullet that had passed through
the stock of his rifle before striking him.</p>
<p>"I am fey . . . I am mad . . . I am dreaming," said Captain
Battreau, and rushed into the fight, wielding once more, with
deadly effect, the weapon that he had used more than twenty years
before.</p>
<p>There was nothing dream-like, from the Dahomeyan point of
view, about this terrible white man, and, before long, the
savages broke and fled, leaving their dead upon the ground; and
the survivors of the Company triumphed with the feeling of
satisfaction that follows a hand-to-hand and man-to-man fight on
equal terms, with no advantage from superior weapons.</p>
<p>For though disciplined troops armed with a rifle should, and
almost always do, defeat a savage enemy, it is quite a different
matter when bayonet meets spear, and the better man wins.</p>
<p>Captain Battreau sat himself down and stared at 187017, still
unable to believe the evidence of his senses. But there was no
room for doubt.</p>
<p>There could not possibly be in the whole world two Chassepôt
rifles, each bearing that number, each marked with that record of
slain Germans, and each with a bullet-hole drilled through the
butt in exactly that spot.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Captain Battreau again made application for permission to keep
the rifle, and this time, as it was no longer the property of
Madame la République, this was graciously accorded, and 187017
returned to France in his possession.</p>
<p>This story, as Tant de Soif told it to me, is absolutely
true.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c402" id="c402"><i>Bombs</i></a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 1</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Old Tant De Soif, Father of the Battalion, was inevitably a
walking encyclopædia of Legion lore, and it was to him that one
applied for historical and other information.</p>
<p>If not exactly <i>arbiter elegantiarum,</i> he was undeniably
arbiter on disputes and questions concerning matters of fact and
fiction relating to the Battalion and the Regiment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"<i>Did</i> I know Odo Klemens? Why, it was through Odo that I
came near to losing my own identity. I, Tant de Soif, almost came
to be known merely as The Friend of Odo Klemens," he would say
when questioned on the subject.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One had to believe Tant de Soifs oft-told biography of Odo
Klemens because it rang true, and contained those little touches
that no one would think of inventing.</p>
<p>Moreover, I discovered as an indisputable fact, that Tant de
Soif was at one time a comrade, if not the <i>copain,</i> of Odo
Klemens.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I have not yet made up my mind as to whether he
was embroidering the story and varnishing the tale when he told
us the amazing yarn about Odo Klemens' dog.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 2</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"That was another thing about Odo Klemens," quoth Tant de
Soif, after reminiscing about some of his hero's doings when
scouring Morocco and combing her cities in disguise, searching
for secret-service information, and spying upon spies.</p>
<p>"Another of the many strange qualities that made him so
different from ordinary men--the amazing power he had over
animals--including women. . . . Talk about old Bombelli taming
his lions! Klemens would have tamed them and the Strong Woman
too. . . . Why, he could tame army mules; tame mad camels; tame
wild goats, wild sheep, any wild bird. . . . I tell you he would
make a vulture alight near him and eat out of his hand. . .
."</p>
<p>"Could he tame Sergeants and make them eat out of his hand?"
inquired Bombelli.</p>
<p>"He did better than that, Funny-Face. He became a Sergeant
himself and had other people eating out of <i>his</i> hand. . . .
He'd have broken a thing like you and thrown the bits to his dog.
. . . You keep your head shut when I'm talking about a man whose
buttons you aren't fit to polish. . . .</p>
<p>"Where was I when the hole in that thing's face fell open? . .
. Yes. . . . I said he'd have fed his dog on bits of
Bombelli--though I don't say the dog would have eaten
them--though he was only a village pariah cur when Odo Klemens
adopted him.</p>
<p>"Just that. We were going through a <i>ksar</i> with our
bayonets, in style. . . . I dashed into a house and saw Klemens,
who had just pinned a man to the wall. Such a funny sight. The
Arab, who'd got a knife, couldn't reach Odo with it, and Odo
couldn't withdraw his bayonet, and there they were, <i>planté là.
. . .</i> Stuck. . . . Odo was laughing--as he held on to the
butt of his rifle at arm's length (and the Arab looked just like
a big dirty beetle on a pin)--because a pariah pup was biting
away, like the devil, at Odo's gaiters and trying to hang on to
his trousers.</p>
<p>"He could have kicked it half a mile, stove its ribs in, but
he only laughed and encouraged it.</p>
<p>"When I finished off the Arab and we got Odo's bayonet out of
the beam he'd driven it into--and it took the two of us to shift
it--Odo grabbed the dog, held it still, and stared into its
eyes.</p>
<p>"Then he flattened it, belly down, on the floor, and kept
drawing his finger down its head, between the ears, to the nose,
and prolonging the line on the ground while he talked to it in
Arabic, repeating the same two words over and over again. . .
.</p>
<p>"All this only took a minute or so, yet when we bolted out of
the house, the dog followed us as though Klemens had owned it for
years.</p>
<p>"Wherever we went that day, the dog went too--and it must have
seen some funny sights. . . . Me, I had something else than
village curs to attend to, but when we made camp that night,
there was the dog all right; and Odo told me it had stuck to him
all day, and hadn't tried to help any more Arabs again. Quite the
other way round.</p>
<p>"Well, that dog became like Odo's shadow, and he taught it all
manner of amazing tricks--really astounding when you remember it
wasn't a civilized poodle from a Paris flat, but practically a
wild and savage animal.</p>
<p>"Odo called him Abd-el-Kader because he was a good fighter.
Perhaps the most remarkable thing about it all was the fact that
the dog would go and do something Odo told him to do, when he
spoke in an ordinary conversational way, using quite a long
sentence.</p>
<p>"It's one thing to shout '<i>Beg, Fido!</i>' or <i>'Jump,
Fido!</i>' at a dog, and make some appropriate gesture which the
dog understands and connects with the order and the trick that is
expected of it.</p>
<p>"But it's quite another thing to say quietly,</p>
<p>"'Go into the barrack-room and bring me my <i>képi</i> off my
bed'; or to pick up a stone, spit on it, show it to the dog, and
say,</p>
<p>"'If I throw this stone, be good enough to leave it alone,
will you?'--and to have correct obedience every time.</p>
<p>"You don't believe it, Bombelli? No? Of course you don't. You
haven't the intelligence, nor the imagination. You think that
everybody is a Bombelli, I suppose--and that what you can't do,
nobody can do. Why, man, Odo Klemens could do much more than
that--he could have taught <i>you</i> tricks. Made you quite
useful. Useful to him, anyhow. . . .</p>
<p>"Well, as I was saying, when poor Bombelli's face leaked
again, it was really wonderful. . . . Why, I've heard Odo say to
that village pariah cur,</p>
<p>"'If I throw this stone over my right shoulder, you'll stand
as you are. But if I throw it over my left shoulder, you'll lie
down at once. If, however, I do neither, but just drop it, you
will bark twice . . .' and the dog would do accordingly, and be
right every time."</p>
<p>"What language did he talk?" asked Bombelli.</p>
<p>"The dog, do you mean, Fish-face? He generally barked in
Arabic."</p>
<p>"No. . . . Odo Klemens, of course," replied Bombelli
angrily.</p>
<p>"Oh, Klemens. . . . He began by talking Arabic, but when the
dog was well trained, he would speak German to it. Sometimes
French, for the public benefit, when he was showing-off, so that
everyone would know what he had told the dog to do.</p>
<p>"He got very fond of the beast--we all did, in point of
fact--and I think he would have killed anyone who mistook it for
a tender spring-chicken when we were on short rations. Any
stranger passing through, I mean, for anyone of our Section would
as soon have thought of eating a comrade as of eating
Abd-el-Kader. Cannibalism, eh, Poussin?"</p>
<p>"Certainly--if <i>you</i> ate a dog," replied Père
Poussin.</p>
<p>"I don't know what we should have done without that
dog--especially when things were very difficult and there was a
lot of <i>cafard</i> about. We had a bad time in that
<i>poste,</i> just about then, because on top of the usual
troubles of life in the Legion, we were haunted by an
extraordinarily clever thief, or else by a <i>djinn</i>--an evil
spirit, as invisible as it was malevolent.</p>
<p>"When I say a thief, I mean one from outside, of course, an
Arab; and the fact that someone was stealing things was connected
with another undeniable fact--that someone, or something, not in
uniform, was seen flitting or slinking or dodging about.</p>
<p>"Seen by more than one person, more than once.</p>
<p>"About half of us had had some queer experience or other, with
this visitant; and those who hadn't had one, invented one--so
that there was plenty of mystery and unrest in that damned
<i>poste.</i></p>
<p>"Then, one evening, my turn came for a bit of a surprise and a
little shock. . . .</p>
<p>"No, I didn't see anything--that was the uncanny part of it. I
wished I had seen something.</p>
<p>"I was on sentry, and as we were liable to be attacked at any
hour of the day or night, each sentry was given a couple of
bombs--and instructions to use them, pretty dam' quick, if he
saw, or heard, occasion to do so. . . .</p>
<p>"As you know, Arabs like bombs even less than they do
bayonets. They dislike Rosalie for her own sweet sake; but for
Arabs, bombs have a nasty effect both here and Hereafter, since a
good Mussulman can't go to Heaven if he is blown to pieces on
earth. . . . How could Mahommet recognize him for a True Believer
if he arrived at the gates of Paradise in a thousand bits? It
might be some damned dog of an Infidel, trying it on. . . .</p>
<p>"Well, there I was, doing sentry, with my two bombs at my
feet, nice and handy; and, for the sake of my own hide, I was
keeping a sharp look-out, I can tell you.</p>
<p>"By-and-by, I turned and glanced round the <i>poste,</i> for a
change, and, as I moved, I half-unconsciously glanced down to see
that I did not kick or tread on my bombs.</p>
<p>"Well--there wasn't much fear of my doing that--for they
weren't there . . . !</p>
<p>"Those two little flat iron 'pine-apples' simply weren't
there. . . .</p>
<p>"They had vanished--and they had been there less than two
minutes earlier.</p>
<p>"And, another thing, not a living soul had been anywhere near
me for a good half-hour.</p>
<p>"What d'you make of that, Bombelli? Any funny remarks or
clever theories? . . . No? . . . You surprise me; I should have
thought you could explain it instantly. . . .</p>
<p>"I don't mind telling you, <i>mes amis,</i> that I was in a
perishing blue funk, and for two reasons. I'd got to explain the
disappearance of those bombs to Sergeant-Major Essad--a damned
old Turk, if ever there was one; and I'd got to explain it to
myself too.</p>
<p>"One doesn't like it when solid heavy things--such as
bombs--vanish into thin air. . . . Bombs aren't feathers to be
blown away by the wind, are they? No, bombs do their own
blowing--and it's you who go away.</p>
<p>"Oh, I was frightened all right. . . .</p>
<p>"I was afraid of Sergeant-Major Essad; I was afraid of
whatever invisible Thing or Power had pinched the bombs; and I
was also damned well afraid that they'd come flying back--over
the wall or out of the blue or somewhere.</p>
<p>"I stood and sweated; stood and gaped like a . . . like a
Bombelli . . . and wondered what the devil to do.</p>
<p>"I felt I ought to do something and do it quick--but I
couldn't very well give the alarm, and then say it was because my
two bombs had evaporated or lost themselves or something.</p>
<p>"I tell you I had <i>un mauvais quart d'heure</i> then, and a
worse one when I was up before Sergeant Essad. He was a
terror--that one.</p>
<p>"They called him 'The Red Devil'.</p>
<p>"Been an officer in Albania or somewhere, and had had to bolt
for his life from Abdul the Damned.</p>
<p>"A huge chap he was, with red hair and a perfectly red face,
not brown at all; blue eyes; and the biggest moustache I have
ever seen. He had to turn sideways to get it through a
gateway.</p>
<p>"He had a voice to match it, too, and could drill a battalion
a mile away.</p>
<p>"But he never roared at individuals. Not even at defaulters.
No, his voice was very soft and gentle and quiet for them. The
sweeter and softer it was, the worse for the defaulter, and the
bigger the trouble that was coming.</p>
<p>"And he never said what he'd do to you--he merely did it. No
threats--but a punishment worse than the sentence. Yes, Essad
Bey's bite was a lot worse than his bark; and his performance
worse than his promise.</p>
<p>"Was his voice sweet and low when I was brought up before
him?</p>
<p>"Like silk. Like the voice of a girl talking love.</p>
<p>"'Ah! They disappeared, did they, <i>Légionnaire</i> Soif,' he
whispered, smiling.</p>
<p>"'Disappeared when you weren't looking, eh?
Vanished--<i>pouf!</i>--just like that, eh? . . . When you
weren't looking. . . . Exactly. . . . When your eyes were shut,
in fact. . . . Not looking. . . . Precisely. . . . You have told
the truth. . . . Not looking. . . . And sentries are not posted
for the purpose of looking, one observes. . . . No, no! . . .
They are not there to look. . . . They are there for
ornament.'</p>
<p>"I respectfully swore that I had never relaxed my vigilance
for a second; that I had borne myself in a smart and soldierly
manner; and that no human being had approached within a hundred
feet of me, from the moment when I was posted to the moment when
I was relieved.</p>
<p>"Essad smiled pleasantly.</p>
<p>"'Any private theories of your own to explain this remarkable
phenomenon?' he purred.</p>
<p>"Absolutely none.</p>
<p>"Sergeant-Major Essad had a theory though.</p>
<p>"'I believe your story, <i>mon brave</i>,' he murmured, 'and I
have a theory. . . . You will find it proves to be correct, I am
certain,' and his blazing cold eyes smiled into mine.</p>
<p>"'It is this. You had, perhaps--in fact, you had, without
doubt--just a moment or two of, shall we say, absence of
mind--for you have a mind, I verily believe. . . . And at the end
of this brief period of absence (of mind) you--shall we
say?--awoke. . . . That is to say awoke, not from sleep, but to
the more immediate realities of existence. You have told me you
did not sleep on your post, and of course that settles the
matter. But you brought your bright intelligence back to earth
and mundane matters again--and as you did so, you yawned and
stretched and violently shook yourself. . . . One does, you know.
. . . And as you violently shook yourself, a number of strong
hearty healthy insects fell from your clothing and person to the
ground--near the bombs. . . . These the insects immediately
shouldered and bore away. . . . Doubtless they took them to your
bed, where they will surely be found.</p>
<p>"'Sergeant, put <i>Légionnaire</i> Soif, who "wasn't looking",
where he will have no occasion--or indeed opportunity--to
look.</p>
<p>"'Let there be neither water nor food nor blanket to look at,
and let the little place be so perfectly dark that he couldn't
look at them if they were there. . . . For how long? . . . Oh--I
don't know--you mustn't be too red-tape-bound, Sergeant. Say
about as long as Jacob's Ladder put end-to-end with the Prophet's
Beard . . . or until we want him again . . . whichever is the
mercifully shorter period. . . .'"</p>
<p>Old Tant de Soif took a pull at the contents of my mug, bowed
to me, and wiped his beard with his sleeve.</p>
<p>"That's how Sergeant-Major Essad, the 'Red Devil', talked," he
continued.</p>
<p>"It was how he acted too; for I was in solitary confinement in
the dark until The Red Devil wanted the cell for somebody
else.</p>
<p>"And it didn't do me any good. Nor Sergeant-Major Essad
either. . . . No. . . . For he died bravely, leading his men,
with his face to the foe--and a Lebel bullet through the back of
his neck. . . ."</p>
<p>"Who fired it?" asked Otho Bellême. "You?"</p>
<p>"Huh! Who fired it? Who knows? Some good friend of Sergeant
Essad, anyway. Why?"</p>
<p>"Only that--if you did it--I was going to say that you are a
filthy cowardly cur whose corpse a starving hyena would be
ashamed to eat," replied Bellême.</p>
<p>"Sure thing," agreed Joe Mummery, and Sailor Harris nodded
emphatic agreement.</p>
<p>"I didn't say that I did it," replied Tant de Soif, after an
appraising stare at Bellême.</p>
<p>"No," said Bellême.</p>
<p>"Well--go on," I urged, in the rôle of peace-maker.</p>
<p>"So there I sat in the dark--and a heat like the ground-floor
of Hell--wondering, day and night, what the devil had become of
those two bombs, until I got bombs on the brain, and could see
them floating about in the pitch darkness.</p>
<p>"And I got a bit of a shock one day or night,--for night and
day were exactly the same in that Black Hole--when I came to
myself, so to speak, and found I was crawling round and round the
floor of the cell looking for--bombs.</p>
<p>"Meanwhile things were happening outside.</p>
<p>"Sentries kept getting glimpses of the thief, at
nighttime--apparently an Arab in a white <i>burnous</i> or sheet
or something--and no less than four men lost their bombs.</p>
<p>"I heard all about it when I came out from my little hell one
evening, just before Retreat.</p>
<p>"This happened when Sergeant-Major Essad wanted the cell for
someone else.</p>
<p>"I was brought up before him, yellow, filthy, bearded, half
mad, and with my bones sticking through my scaly hide.</p>
<p>"'Look here, <i>Légionnaire</i> Soif,' he purred, 'I really
can't let you have that room, Number Four, any longer. You have
had your turn and must make way for others. I'm sorry, but you'll
have to clear out at once. And you've no cause to grumble at
being turned out, for you have had it all to yourself and had a
nice rest too. Not to mention a special diet. . . . Quite a
"cure", as the doctors call it. . . . At least, I hope it has
been a cure--for your sake, <i>Légionnaire</i> Soif. . . .</p>
<p>"'Now go and cleanse, beautify, and perfume yourself, and
report for guard in an hour. You'll be on sentry, with two bombs,
and I don't really advise any of that "not looking" this time. .
. . Good evening, <i>Légionnaire</i> Soif.'</p>
<p>"That was how The Red Devil talked.</p>
<p>"Well, I got cleaned up somehow, and reported for duty at
guard-mounting, though I could scarcely stand, and kept turning
giddy; and the light hurt my eyes so badly, after those days and
nights of utter blackness, that I could hardly see.</p>
<p>"And there I was again, on sentry-go once more, and with two
bombs at my feet. . . .</p>
<p>"Bombs! They fascinated me. I'd fairly got bombs on the brain,
I tell you. I leant against the wall and stared at them till the
tears ran down my cheeks. I wasn't going to take my eyes off
those damned bombs for the whole two hours of my tour of duty.
Not once.</p>
<p>"Or so I thought.</p>
<p>"But it wasn't very long before I discovered that such a thing
can't be done. Especially by a man in a very weak condition. He
falls down if he tries it.</p>
<p>"I soon found that my eyes wandered.</p>
<p>"And, suddenly, they had good cause to wander, for I heard a
sound, and instantly glancing in the direction whence it came, I
distinctly saw someone--or something--move.</p>
<p>"It might have been a man dressed up in a white sheet, or it
might have been an Arab in a white <i>burnous,</i> or again it
might have been a ghost.</p>
<p>"Anyhow, whoever it was, or whatever it was, I wasn't going to
give it a chance to get my bombs.</p>
<p>"In the same second that I saw the Thing, I glanced down at
the bombs to be sure they were there all right, and threw up my
rifle.</p>
<p>"If this was what had got me a solitary confinement sentence,
I was going to shoot it first, challenge it second, kick it
third, and talk to it afterwards.</p>
<p>". . . It was moving across my front stealthily. The light--or
rather the darkness--was very patchy, and the Thing progressed in
a curious manner. Not exactly undulating like a snake, but rising
and falling as it went along, so that at one moment it looked
about six feet high, and the next moment about three feet
low.</p>
<p>"Pausing for a moment so as to get it at its biggest, I fired.
And it wasn't a case of,</p>
<p>"'<i>Halt! Who goes there? . . . No answer. . . . Bang!</i>',
so much as a case of,</p>
<p>"'<i>Bang! . . . Halt! Who goes there? . . . . No
answer.'</i></p>
<p>"And over I rushed to where the Thing had fallen to get the
answer.</p>
<p>"The answer was the Company cook, groaning and moaning and
calling me a sacred assassin.</p>
<p>"Luckily for me, the silly fool, who was dressed up to look
more or less like a ghost, was on his way back from his little
raid on the store-room, and laden up with bottles of wine and
other stuff that he'd stolen.</p>
<p>"It was thus easy enough for me to pose as the eagle-eyed
ever-watchful hero who had laid the ghost, solved the mystery,
and obviously caught the thief who, for some strange reason, had
been stealing hand-grenades from the sentries.</p>
<p>"It had only taken me a few seconds to shoot Cookie (and he
was the type of cook that deserves to be shot daily), to identify
him, and get back to my post: and as I reached the spot where my
bombs were--I saw that they weren't.</p>
<p>"No, <i>mes amis.</i> Those two good solid little iron
pine-apples were not.</p>
<p>"They weren't there.</p>
<p>"They'd gone.</p>
<p>"I gazed at the spot whence they had gone.</p>
<p>"I tapped my forehead hard with my knuckles.</p>
<p>"'Good evening, Tant de Soif,' said I to myself.</p>
<p>"'Good evening,' said myself to me.</p>
<p>"'The bombs <i>were</i> there when you fired your rifle, Tant
de Soif, were they not?' asked I.</p>
<p>"'They were, my dear friend,' replied myself. 'I glanced down
at them as I brought my rifle up from the "<i>Order</i>" to the
"<i>Present</i>".'</p>
<p>"'And you shot the wine-stealing, bomb-throwing rascal in his
tracks, didn't you?'</p>
<p>"'I did,' I replied.</p>
<p>"'So <i>he</i> couldn't have pinched them, could he?' I asked
myself.</p>
<p>"'Of course he couldn't,' was the reply. 'Don't ask such silly
questions.'</p>
<p>"'Then who did take them?' I asked.</p>
<p>"'How the devil do I know, you silly old fool?' I replied.</p>
<p>"And so brief a time had elapsed since I fired my rifle, that
it was only at this moment that the guard turned out, the hue and
cry was raised, and the hulla-balloo began.</p>
<p>"Well, somehow the Sergeant of the Guard got the impression,
from my prompt and intelligent answers to his foolish questions,
that Cookie was the bomb-thief, and had stolen my two bombs and
had been shot by me, in the execution of my duty, as he had
attempted to get away with them.</p>
<p>"I don't know how it was, but he certainly seemed to get that
impression.</p>
<p>"'Then where the devil are they now? What's he done with 'em,
<i>salaud?</i>' roared the Sergeant.</p>
<p>"To which I could but shrug my shoulders and answer,</p>
<p>"'Where indeed? . . . What indeed, <i>mon Sergent?</i>'</p>
<p>"And really, you know, it wasn't my business, was it? I could
do no more than shoot the treacherous scoundrel, the villainous
robber, who came to steal my bombs, could I? Surely it was for
him to explain what he'd done with them, not me.</p>
<p>"But unfortunately--or fortunately--Cookie couldn't
explain.</p>
<p>"He was dead . . . and gone to his own place--apparently
taking my bombs with him.</p>
<p>"At least, that was how I tried to explain it to The Red Devil
when he had me up and put me through it.</p>
<p>"And at the end of our long and unpleasant interview, I don't
know whether The Red Devil or I was the more puzzled man.</p>
<p>"From his point of view, and knowledge, there had been a thief
about, at night. Several sentries had seen someone dressed up in
white, dodging about inside the <i>poste:</i> and ten bombs had
been stolen, and every time from a sentry.</p>
<p>"It was quite impossible for the men to steal them, as there
was daily kit-inspection, and no possible hole or corner in the
<i>poste</i> that could be used as a place of concealment.</p>
<p>"And now a sentry had seen this strange, lurking, stealthy
figure, white-clad, mysterious and suspicious-looking, and had,
according to his own account, challenged it three times.</p>
<p>"Instead of replying, it had rushed at him, ducked beneath his
fixed bayonet, snatched up his bombs and fled.</p>
<p>"Naturally thinking it to be an Arab rifle-thief turned
bomb-thief, the sentry had again challenged the figure, called
upon it to halt, and then, as it neither replied nor halted, had
very properly shot it dead.</p>
<p>"But the supposed Arab raider had turned out to be the Company
cook, and his loot, bottles of wine instead of bombs.</p>
<p>"But the sentry's bombs had been taken.</p>
<p>"Where were they?</p>
<p>"Yes, The Red Devil was a puzzled man.</p>
<p>"And in addition to the major problem of the bombs was the
minor problem of the sentry.</p>
<p>"If he were an abominable liar--and of course he was an
abominable liar, like all <i>légionnaires</i> (until they are
promoted to be N.C.O.s)--what had he done with the bombs? He
certainly hadn't got them, any more than the dead man had, and
whether he were a liar or not, he had undoubtedly killed a man in
defence of his bombs.</p>
<p>"Why should the sentry have shot the fellow, if he had not
been behaving in the way that the sentry said he had?</p>
<p>"And undoubtedly, the dead man had been engaged in some
villainy or other, or why was he got up in that fantastic
fashion--dressed as a ghost?</p>
<p>"And, anyway, if he hadn't been stealing bombs, he'd been
stealing stores.</p>
<p>"And once again, where were the stolen bombs?</p>
<p>"Yes, The Red Devil was puzzled.</p>
<p>"But he wasn't as puzzled as I, who knew that neither Cookie
nor anybody else had been within twenty yards of those two
bombs.</p>
<p>"The Red Devil sat at his table and stared me in the eyes
until I began to feel that he could read every thought that was
in my mind, and a good many that weren't.</p>
<p>"'I'll see you again later,' he whispered, at length, 'when I
have made further inquiries, and if I find you've told me a word
of untruth, you shall have some cause to share your mother's
favourite wish.'</p>
<p>"He didn't say what that was, but I imagined the fellow
intended to suggest that my mother wished I'd never been
born.</p>
<p>"However, that very night something occurred to turn The Red
Devil's attention elsewhere.</p>
<p>"Another sentry lost his bombs!</p>
<p>"That really put Sergeant-Major Essad on his mettle.</p>
<p>"He swore by Allah and a number of other remarkable phenomena
that he would do the next bomb-loser to death in a curious
manner.</p>
<p>"And that he would raze the <i>poste</i> to the ground, tear
it to fragments piecemeal, and sift the scraps through a sieve,
but that he'd find those bombs--if they were in the Fort.</p>
<p>"You can imagine the state we were all in by that time, and,
had it not been for the fact that Essad stopped the issue of
bombs pending the solution of the mystery, I don't know what
would have happened. We should have all shot each other, I think,
we were so jumpy and nervous.</p>
<p>"The day that The Red Devil cancelled the order for issuing
bombs, I was sitting talking to Odo Klemens.</p>
<p>"'And thank <i>le bon Dieu</i> for that,' said I. 'If I'd gone
on sentry one more time, with a couple of hand-grenades, I should
have thrown them at myself.'</p>
<p>"Odo Klemens laughed.</p>
<p>"'Wonderful mystery, wasn't it?' he said,</p>
<p>"'A bit too wonderful for me,' I agreed. 'Thank God we shan't
have any more of it.'</p>
<p>"'No, we shan't have any more of it,' grinned Odo, and laughed
again.</p>
<p>"'Something seems to be amusing you,' I growled.</p>
<p>"'Something certainly is amusing me,' he laughed afresh.</p>
<p>"I didn't like Odo's laugh. It was always more or less
unpleasant, and when it did not give the impression that he was
laughing at you, it quite distinctly gave the impression that he
was laughing at something you were too stupid to understand.</p>
<p>"I quite distinctly remember feeling, on that occasion, that
he was enjoying a joke that, though far too subtle for me, was
fully shared by Abd-el-Kader.</p>
<p>"He patted the dog's head and pulled its ears as he spoke, and
the dog rolled over on its back, its bent legs in the air, and
laughed aloud.</p>
<p>"Odo Klemens laughed again.</p>
<p>"And the dog laughed again.</p>
<p>"It rolled over on its side, helpless with laughter.</p>
<p>"I was quite annoyed at the way they shared the joke while
excluding me, so I got up and went to the cookhouse.</p>
<p>". . . Did I mention that The Red Devil had appointed me
Company cook--solely on the grounds that I'd shot the official
incumbent? . . .</p>
<p>"However, as you know, <i>mes amis,</i> I am of a gentle and
forgiving nature, and when Abd-el-Kader called round, a little
later, I gave him a big bone that had already seen its best
days--and a good many of them.</p>
<p>"With a word of thanks and a nod, the dog took the bone, and
did not gnaw it.</p>
<p>"On the contrary, he marched away with it and a great air of
purpose.</p>
<p>"'Well, damn it all,' said I. 'Is the dog going to sell it, or
frame it, or what?'</p>
<p>"I followed him to see what he did do with it.</p>
<p>"He did nothing with it--except use it to keep me following
him. So long as I followed, he did nothing; and as long as he did
nothing, I followed.</p>
<p>"And I got tired first.</p>
<p>"'Well,' thought I, 'Abd-el-Kader is as clever as the devil,
as artful as the devil's daughter, and as cunning as her mother.
But surely I, Tant de Soif, a man, am as intelligent as
Abd-el-Kader, the dog?'</p>
<p>"So when I saw old Père Poussin, I seized him by the arm,
turned my back on Abd-el-Kader, and pointed up to the sky.</p>
<p>"'Look, <i>petit</i> Poussin,' said I.</p>
<p>"'What at?' asked he.</p>
<p>"'Nothing,' said I. . . . 'But listen. Follow Abd-el-Kader,
your cousin, without appearing to follow him, and see what he
does with that damned great bone that he's carrying about like a
cornet-player. Go on, my clever Poussin. Follow him. . . . Watch
him. . . . Secret Service. . . .'</p>
<p>"'Follow him yourself,' replied Père Poussin, who, as you all
know, is a mannerless and foolish old man.</p>
<p>"'I've been doing so for some hours,' I replied. 'Now you take
up the trail, and I'll give you my wine-ration to-morrow if
you--deserve it.'</p>
<p>"By-and-bye, Poussin came and told me that, from a coign of
vantage, he had looked down upon Abd-el-Kader, and watched his
doings unseen.</p>
<p>"The dog had merely buried the bone.</p>
<p>"Nothing much in that! . . . Quite so.</p>
<p>"<i>But,</i> that evening, being on sentry, I noticed
Abd-el-Kader leave the fort.</p>
<p>"'You'd better do your business quickly, my lad,' I admonished
him as he passed, 'or take your latchkey with you.'</p>
<p>"And, as I spoke, I noticed that, whether Abd-el-Kader had got
his latch-key with him or not, he'd certainly got the big
bone.</p>
<p>"'Well, now,' thought I, 'where's he taking that? Does he
think he'll get a better price for if in the Arab market?'</p>
<p>"It struck me as queer that Abd-el-Kader should bury the bone
in the <i>poste</i> and then, just before the gates were shut,
exhume it and take it outside. Very curious; for Abd-el-Kader
always had a good reason for anything he did.</p>
<p>"So I watched him, thinking I'd see which way he went, and
note whether he came back before Retreat. . . . The thought did
cross my mind that he might be going to treat himself to a night
out, and that the bone was intended to be in the nature of
a--what shall we say? . . . A love-token; a bribe; a
<i>pourboire</i> . . . ? But I put the thought away.</p>
<p>"'<i>Honi soit qui mal y pense,</i>' said I. 'What reason have
I to doubt the moral character of Abd-el-Kader?'</p>
<p>"But, somewhat to my surprise, he didn't go very far, nor had
he any assignation.</p>
<p>"He merely went to our only tree, some four hundred metres
away, and there, so far as I could see, he again buried the
bone.</p>
<p>"Having done so, he deliberately made a detour, approached the
<i>poste</i> from a different direction, and, just as the gates
were being shut, came in with a rather smug look on his face, as
of one who says,</p>
<p>"'<i>Something attempted, something done, to earn a night's
repose.</i>'"</p>
<p>Tant de Soif stopped and eyed his audience.</p>
<p>Bellême passed him a mug, and Tant de Soif bowed and
drank.</p>
<p>"Next afternoon," he resumed, "finding myself passing our only
tree, I remembered Abd-el-Kader, and thought I'd play a little
trick on that self-sufficient dog. Since he had refused to let me
see what he did with that bone, I wouldn't let him see what
<i>I</i> did with it. I'd remove his bone, and then watch him
scratch his puzzled head when he came to look for it.</p>
<p>"I kicked away some sand, and delved a little with my hands,
and, sure enough, discovered the bone.</p>
<p>"Also, some other bones.</p>
<p>"Likewise, some things that were not bones.</p>
<p>"Not bones at all. Nothing like bones.</p>
<p>"And what were they?</p>
<p>"The missing bombs!</p>
<p>"I nearly fainted. . . . And I nearly swore.</p>
<p>"I saw it all.</p>
<p>"Odo Klemens!</p>
<p>"Yes; my friend Odo Klemens. He had trained that infernal dog
to steal and bury bones in the <i>poste--</i>secretly. Then, to
dig them up and take them out of the <i>poste</i>--also secretly.
When no one was looking.</p>
<p>"When Abd-el-Kader was word-perfect in his part, and as clever
as Houdini, Cinqvalli--or <i>ce bon</i> Bombelli himself--Odo had
led him on, from stealing bones to stealing bombs, and following
the same procedure with them.</p>
<p>"Doubtless he deceived the dog, or at any rate interested him,
by rubbing the bombs with mutton-fat.</p>
<p>"I don't know.</p>
<p>"But I do know that, in one blinding flash of revelation, I
saw the whole thing.</p>
<p>"I saw those bombs disappearing, one after the other, from the
very feet of the nervous, worried sentries who gazed anxiously
and watchfully around, looking for the approach of a man, an
Arab, a ghost, a devil, a <i>djinn</i>--while Odo Klemens'
faithful doggie, Abd-el-Kader, sat at their feet or played around
and helped beguile the tedium of their watch.</p>
<p>"'I see it all,' said I.</p>
<p>"'And I'll see some more,' I added.</p>
<p>"'<i>Mon Dieu,</i> yes. I'll bide my time and catch <i>ce bon
Monsieur</i> Odo Klemens out. I'll watch, and I'll wait, and I'll
see some more.'</p>
<p>"But I didn't see any more--for Odo Klemens and Abd-el-Kader
deserted that night.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"And in the morning, full of importance, honest indignation,
and vindicated righteousness, I obtained an interview with The
Red Devil himself.</p>
<p>"I told him the whole story.</p>
<p>"I led him to the <i>cache</i> of bombs.</p>
<p>"There were no bombs.</p>
<p>"There was only me . . . and The Red Devil."</p>

<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 1</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Old Tant De Soif, incurable <i>laudator temporis acti,</i> was
reminiscent on the subject of his admired and beloved Captain Le
Sage, of whom our Lieutenant Desalles reminds him. Tant de Soif
can pay no man a higher compliment than to permit him to remind
Tant de Soif of this legendary officer, his <i>beau idéal</i> of
a leader and a fighting man.</p>
<p>"Lieutenant Desalles will do," said he, as we lolled and
lounged through <i>siesta-</i>time after our sumptuous lunch.</p>
<p>"He has the makings of a Legion officer of the old school and
the right stamp. . . . But yes, he will grow up into something
very like a man. . . . He may even become another Le Sage--of
whom he already begins to remind me, young as he is.</p>
<p>"'What was Le Sage like?' . . . Oh, like a soldier. Like a man
and a leader and an officer worthy to command
<i>légionnaires</i>--by which I mean <i>légionnaires</i> also of
the old school, of the type that has vanished, or is rapidly
vanishing. . . . Men like myself, <i>par exemple.</i> He was
quiet . . . almost gentle . . . and grim; low-voiced, easy; very
clever; with the determination of a bull-dog. He had no courage
because he had no fear and did not know what danger was.</p>
<p>"He neither wanted to live nor to die; to be wounded nor
remain unwounded; to be promoted nor to be passed over; to be
decorated nor to be left in obscurity.</p>
<p>"He cared for none of these things. No--but he cared for us. .
. . And he cared for his job.</p>
<p>"What he did want, was to be the perfect soldier and officer,
rendering absolute obedience--even unto Death--and exacting
it.</p>
<p>"He lived for his work--and we lived for him.</p>
<p>"'What was he like?' . . . Oh, tall, splendid physique, well
set up, strong, lithe, and agile.</p>
<p>"'In face?' . . . Oh, rather narrow and long, with grey-green
eyes; straight mouth beneath small clipped moustache; a twinkle
of humour about both mouth and eyes--when they were not grim and
hard with determination, pain or anger.</p>
<p>"For he was quick to anger as he was slow to forgive.</p>
<p>"Ah, I shall not look upon his like again, unless I live to
see Lieutenant Desalles grow into such another . . .</p>
<p>"My Captain . . .</p>
<p>"Did I tell you about him and the enterprising citizen who
proposed to turn an honest penny by poisoning, maddening and
actually killing us, Le Sage's silly <i>légionnaires,</i> in his
foul <i>bouge?</i></p>
<p>"No? . . . Oh, that was good. Really good. And so typical of
our quiet, clever and ruthless Captain Le Sage. . . . A neat
little sample of his methods, and an epitome of his logical
thought, character, actions and ways.</p>
<p>"Le Sage, you must know, considered no man as being drunk so
long as he could perform his duty when on duty, and behave
quietly and properly when not on duty.</p>
<p>"He did not punish for drunkenness, but he severely punished
the wrong-doing due to drunkenness. I mean that drunkenness was
absolutely no excuse whatsoever for any misconduct
whatsoever.</p>
<p>"Also he tried to see that we got nothing but good wine--when
we got anything at all. And he was as blind as any blind man to
those things which a good officer knows that it is better for him
not to see. . . . On a feast day, or some good occasion and
opportunity for proper rejoicings. . . .</p>
<p>"But a real breach of discipline--Heaven help him who
committed it.</p>
<p>"And when he marched us into Fort Bugeaud, away down in the
South, there was not a finer Company, commanded by a finer
officer, in the French Army--and that is to say in the whole
world.</p>
<p>"There was nothing to do at Fort Bugeaud--except work . . .
nothing to see but sand and sky . . . nothing to drink but some
poor wine in the little shops of the bazaar--miserable huts and
holes-in-the-wall mostly kept by Arabs . . . and nothing to eat
but army rations.</p>
<p>"However, we being the men we were, and Le Sage being the
commandant that he was, we didn't fare too badly. He found us
plenty to do, and saw that we did it; and there was no harassing
for the sake of harassing, no overdriving, no bullying, and very
little punishment indeed. Fort Bugeaud was the model
<i>poste,</i> for efficiency, smartness and discipline.</p>
<p>"And then, suddenly, trouble began--quite remarkable,
inexplicable, and ugly trouble.</p>
<p>"It began by Maartens and Burgher, two very good Dutchmen,
being brought back from the bazaar one night, drunk and very much
more than drunk. . . . Mad, in fact. . . . Absolutely raving mad,
fighting mad . . . amok . . . dangerous. . . .</p>
<p>"Now Maartens and Burgher were two of those proper
<i>légionnaires</i> who never get drunk in any circumstances, or
under any temptation, inducement, or compulsion. Those two had
never been drunk once in all their years of service, for nothing
could make them drunk.</p>
<p>"Nor--if any conceivable mixture and variety of good liquor
could have been poured into them in such quantities as to
intoxicate those two Dutchmen--would it ever have had the effect
of making them fighting-drunk.</p>
<p>"For they were stolid, sensible men, who, being paid to fight,
fought when they had to, for their pay and nothing else.</p>
<p>"When they had to fight, they fought like tigers, but they did
not fight for amusement--any more than a navvy digs up a road for
amusement, after he has done his day's work at digging up a
road.</p>
<p>"And here were Maartens and Burgher dragged back from the
village into the <i>poste,</i> like the most savage of wild
beasts just captured in the jungle.</p>
<p>"Their uniforms were shameful--and shameless--rags; they were
covered in blood and dirt; and they had made the picket that
brought them in nearly as bad as themselves.</p>
<p>"And, safe inside, they were like a pair of panthers in a
trap.</p>
<p>"Maartens sprang on Sergeant Meredal, knocked him out, and
nearly killed him before we tore the raving maniac from the
prostrate form of his superior officer. Not that we tore too
hard, for we weren't very fond of Sergeant Meredal, whereas we
had the greatest liking for Maartens, and admired him the more
for putting up this wonderful drunk--Maartens who had always been
as sober as a judge, when full as an egg and tight as a tick. . .
.</p>
<p>"And while I was trying to get Maartens' hands from around
Sergeant Meredal's neck just in time for that competent N.C.O. to
recover (and no sooner), I saw Burgher shake off the three or
four men who were holding him, and make a swift dash in the
direction of Captain Le Sage, who was approaching to see what all
the row was about.</p>
<p>"I stuck out a leg and luckily brought him down, for he had
murder in his eye, and absolute madness in the hole where his
mind should have been. Just sheer blind, maniacal lunacy, for
both he and Maartens loved Le Sage as a father, and a fine one at
that. . . .</p>
<p>"Well--it was a job of work to get those two madmen in cells,
and then we had to go in to them again, for Le Sage said they
were to be bound, hand and foot, for their own good, and gagged
for his. He'd have had no sleep otherwise, and he never lost his
proper sleep unless he were fighting overtime, or doing a forced
march. He used to say that it was a soldier's duty to sleep, when
it wasn't his duty not to sleep. . . .</p>
<p>"He gave orders for Maartens and Burgher to be brought up
before him next morning. But it wasn't next morning for the
Dutchmen. They were deaf, dumb, blind and silly; and we only knew
that they were still alive because they still breathed.</p>
<p>"Not that one should really call the disgusting noise
'breathing' . . . worse than old Père Poussin sleeping on his
back. . . . Snorting, snoring, what you will.</p>
<p>"Anyhow, they were making sounds indicative of life--and
suggestive of early death.</p>
<p>"I never in all my days saw two such utter complete and
perfect drunks--until a day or two later . . . and then I saw
three of them.</p>
<p>"One of them was Père Poussin here, and as you know, Père
Poussin is no drunkard. . . . He does his best, I admit, but
there is no man alive--except myself and the survivors of the
garrison of Fort Bugeaud, if there be any--who ever saw Père
Poussin drunk. But he was as drunk as seven owls that night, all
right. And the other two were Petrovitch and an ex-Prussian
Grenadier named Krafft.</p>
<p>"Now Petrovitch was a former Sergeant of the Russian
Guard--the famous Preobrazhenski Regiment, a man weaned on vodka,
and who could drink vodka or any other neat spirit just as freely
as the modern soldier can drink cold water after a dry march, and
with as little effect on his brain, if he had any.</p>
<p>"And Krafft was a man of iron, a real Prussian, who could look
a nine-gallon barrel of beer in the face at sunrise, and defeat
it ere the sun went down upon his thirst that day.</p>
<p>"Now what, I ask you (and Captain Le Sage asked himself),
could have happened to three such men as these, that they also
should be brought in--not so much intoxicated as poisoned--not so
much drunk as mad.</p>
<p>"For they had gone mad as dogs do when they get rabies and
develop hydrophobia.</p>
<p>"In a sense, they had always suffered from hydrophobia, of
course, as they hated water, whether inside them or outside them,
whether falling upon them from Heaven as they marched, or
splashing beneath their feet as they forded streams.</p>
<p>"The scene they made in the village, on the road coming back,
and inside the <i>poste,</i> was similar to that staged by
Maartens and Burgher, but conceived and executed on a grander
scale, because they were grander men--bigger and stronger, both
as men and as drinkers.</p>
<p>"Also, there were three of them.</p>
<p>"And I can inform you, <i>mes amis,</i> authoritatively, that
there was considerable wear and tear, especially tear, and much
disharmony and friction, before those three heroes were safely
trussed-up in the cells.</p>
<p>"When I looked in, later on, to see that Père Poussin was
comfortable, I could only distinguish him from the Russian and
the Prussian by the fact that his right hand still clutched a
good fistful of beard. Not his own, for he shaved regularly every
Saturday night so as to start the week well, and look smart and
soldierly all the time.</p>
<p>"Well, while these three poor fellows were still unconscious,
and breathing like stranded whales, Burgher and Maartens
recovered sufficiently to attend a reception held in their
honour, and in the orderly-room, by Captain Le Sage.</p>
<p>"The charge was one of resisting the guard, damaging
Government property, over-staying leave, and using language
prejudicial to good discipline. . . . No mention of drunkenness.
. . . Nothing about striking a superior officer--which would have
been somewhat more than serious for Messieurs Burgher and
Maartens, with a prison and Penal Battalion sentence as the least
they could hope for.</p>
<p>"The two Dutchmen, still as drunk as newts and sick as
salamanders, pleaded absence of mind, recent bereavements, some
bad tinned fish, birthdays, senility, moon-stroke and a bottle of
flat beer between them, taken upon empty stomachs and a foolish
impulse.</p>
<p>"Captain Le Sage sentenced them to twenty-one years' solitary
confinement--with remission of twenty years and fifty-one weeks,
provided they told him exactly what they had drunk, and where
they had got it.</p>
<p>"But that was the trouble. . . .</p>
<p>"Anxious as they were to shorten their sentence by even twenty
years and fifty-one weeks, they simply could not tell Le Sage
anything about it. . . .</p>
<p>"Not a word. . . .</p>
<p>"They could not even tell us, their admiring comrades, who
longed to emulate their really fine feat and, if possible, to
lower their record--until that night the record drunk of the
Foreign Legion. They could not even tell each other--for they did
not know. . . .</p>
<p>"All they did know was that they had marched out of Fort
Bugeaud one evening, sober soldiers of blameless life and
spotless record, and had more-or-less awakened two or three days
later more-or-less alive, to find themselves bound and gagged
comfortably at home in their old familiar prison-cells.</p>
<p>"As to the intervening period, their minds were blank, and
blank they remained.</p>
<p>"Le Sage sent them back to <i>la boîte,</i> and there applied
various stimulants--to the memory. . . . But you can't stimulate
what is dead. . . . You can't get something out of nothing--and
their minds were nothing. . . . They were vacant. . . .</p>
<p>"Then came the turn of Père Poussin, Krafft and Petrovitch,
who, as I have told you, had set up a fresh record so soon after
the new one established by Maartens and Burgher.</p>
<p>"Just the same with them.</p>
<p>"Not even the wiliness or the ruthlessness, not even the
cajolery or the leniency of Captain Le Sage could get out of
these three any account of what had happened to cause their
downfall, from the position of soldiers who can carry their
liquor, to the level of pimply <i>pékins</i> who cannot.</p>
<p>"Nor is it for one moment to be supposed that these five were
stoutly guarding a sacred secret--the whereabouts of a hidden
shrine in which Bacchus could be invoked with a liquor so potent
that even a seasoned <i>légionnaire</i> could not get away with
it. . . .</p>
<p>"Old Père Poussin would have told me at once, and if he had
not, I'd have wrung his soul from his miserable body and his
secret from his more miserable soul.</p>
<p>"No--they simply did not know.</p>
<p>"Whatever they had drunk was like one of those poisons that
injure the mind more than the body, and destroy the memory
completely.</p>
<p>"In this case, of course, it was only the destruction of
memories and not of the memory itself--and of memories, curiously
enough, connected with the drink itself, prior and posthumous . .
. I mean posterior. . . . What are you laughing at, Poussin, my
gentle jackal? Yes, I said 'posterior' . . . .</p>
<p>"Speaking to the more intelligent of my audience, I remark
that, curiously enough, they remembered everything up to the time
of going in search of a drink. . . . They clearly remembered what
they said and did when dressing for walking-out, and when going
along the road to the village . . . things like that . . . but
nothing about the place to which they went, nor of what they did
there. "Not one of the five could remember that. A queer
business. . . ."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tant de Soif fell silent in reminiscence for a minute, and I
tried to recall the name of a drug (dhatura) of which I had heard
a good deal in India--a horrible poison used by the
<i>thugs</i>--of which a certain dose would infallibly kill a
man, a lesser dose render him insane for life, and a yet smaller
one cause complete loss of memory and general vacuity of
mind.</p>
<p>"Well," continued Tant de Soif, "Le Sage dealt faithfully with
the five of them, and promised that what they got was nothing to
what they would get if it happened again, and less than nothing
to what anybody else would get if it happened to him.</p>
<p>"Naturally this rendered us all very anxious.</p>
<p>"No, my excellent Harris, not anxious lest we should
inadvertently drink of this new and strange potion, and
innocently come upon trouble.</p>
<p>"Not at all.</p>
<p>"Our anxiety was lest Le Sage should discover the source of it
before we did.</p>
<p>"Then, while the five heroes were still <i>gareeb</i> and
<i>miskeen,</i> still shaky and quiet, sick and sorry,
distrustful of life and of alcohol itself, D'Alvers, a nice
French boy, who had come to the Legion because his Mistress had
married his Papa--a distinguished General--followed in their
footsteps. . . .</p>
<p>"Only he did not follow them far enough. . . . Only into the
cells--and not out again. . . .</p>
<p>"He died there.</p>
<p>"A joke's a joke, as Bellême frequently observes, but this was
carrying a joke too far--carrying it to the Gates of Hell and
through them.</p>
<p>"True, he was only a child of three years' Cavalry service and
four years' Legion, and he had been trying to drink himself to
death ever since he joined us, but it was not right that one
evening's fun should kill him.</p>
<p>"Yes, he behaved exactly as the others had done--like a cross
between a wild beast and a raving lunatic. No--he did not die of
the treatment he got, because he was not gagged nor unduly
trussed up . . . nothing like <i>crapaudine,</i> only just hands
and feet for his own good.</p>
<p>"Why wasn't he gagged? Because he wasn't howling. He was dumb
and frothing at the mouth.</p>
<p>"Either he had had a bigger dose than the others, which is
likely--as he only drank in order to forget and to hasten his
end--or else he was of poorer drinking-physique than the others,
which is also likely.</p>
<p>"Probably both.</p>
<p>"Anyhow, he died.</p>
<p>"No, my dear Cigale, it was not a lovely death. . . . Not at
all. . . . Not the peaceful and pleasant passing of one who sinks
beneath the strong Waters of Lethe after having bathed in them
for a life-time.</p>
<p>"Le Sage was really troubled about it--for he knew <i>le bon
papa Général,</i> and he was fond of the boy, a real soldier who,
but for the unfortunate love-affair, would undoubtedly have grown
up to be a distinguished General himself.</p>
<p>"Yes, Le Sage was troubled, angry, and on his mettle.</p>
<p>"As usual, when in trouble, he sent for me.</p>
<p>"'Tant de Soif,' he said, 'you damned drunken old scoundrelly
<i>grognard'</i>--that was only his way of showing his affection
for me, just a term of endearment--'Tant de Soif, <i>mon
vieux,</i> I want your help . . . I rely on you. . . . You have
got to find out what this high-explosive poison is, and where
these half-witted, half-human idiots are getting it.</p>
<p>"So far, I am defeated. I have been to every filthy
<i>bouge</i> and <i>casse-croûte,</i> every hut and hole and shed
that sells anything at all, and have found--nothing. Nothing but
the usual muck with which you peripatetic barrels--no, you
walking dust-bins, you wandering garbage-boxes, you perpendicular
sewers--poison your foul and worthless selves. . . .</p>
<p>"'You are a Frenchman, Tant de Soif. You have been decorated
twice. You are a soldier and a patriot, a man of honour, a real .
. .'"</p>
<p>"'Liar,' interrupted Père Pousin. 'A real liar.' That's what
Le Sage said. He also said, 'Tant de Soif, if that great red nose
of yours can't smell out this stuff, what good is it and what
good are you? None--for you certainly are no good for anything
else, you drunken disreputable ration-robber.' That's what he
said. . . ."</p>
<p>And having delivered himself thus, Père Poussin closed his
eyes and his mouth and began to snore.</p>
<p>"The poor ancient is failing--rapidly," observed Tant de Soif
with apparent concern. "Poor old soul. . . . Drink. . . . Drink.
. . . Alas!</p>
<p>"However, as I was saying, Le Sage turned to me in his
trouble, and when such a man as My Captain wants my help, he gets
it.</p>
<p>"'I want your help,' he repeated. 'I rely on you. You've got
to solve this mystery. Find out what they're getting, and find
out where they're getting it.'</p>
<p>"'Consider it done, <i>mon Capitaine</i>,' replied I, in a
prompt and soldierly manner, as I saluted, turned about, and
marched from the orderly-room.</p>
<p>"'Hi!' he called, as I reached the door. 'I can consider it
done, can I? . . . Well, don't you keep me considering too
long.</p>
<p>"'You are excused from duty until you've solved the problem,
or until somebody else gets drunk,' he added, and as I again
saluted he added some more.</p>
<p>"'And if that happens before you track it down--I'll put you
into cells for thrice that period. . . .'</p>
<p>"Once more I saluted and turned to go.</p>
<p>"'Hi!' called Captain Le Sage again, as he saw my back.
'Here's a franc. Lay it out wisely and well in the wine-shops,
for I'll have it--and another--out of you, if you discover
nothing. So don't go and sit down and drink it, and come back
with a <i>conte borgne</i>.'</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Well, off I went to the wine-shops of the <i>village
nègre,</i> with a roving commission, and thoroughly and
copiously, albeit discreetly, I sampled their goods--or rather
their bads.</p>
<p>"Alleged wine I drank in each; near beer, problematical
<i>pernod,</i> reputed rum, villainous vermouth, ambiguous
absinthe, synthetic syrops, concocted cognac, supposititious
slivoviche, absolute alcohol and pure genuine, unadulterated,
methylated spirit. Also <i>tchum-tchum,</i> a very beautiful
rice-spirit.</p>
<p>"All these things I drank, severally and separately, as well
as in every conceivable permutation and combination. Did they
make me drunk? Not in the slightest degree, much less raving
mad.</p>
<p>"Also I tried a very good combination of <i>tchum-tchum,</i>
methylated spirit, <i>pernod</i> and <i>rogomme</i> on old
Poussin here. Did it make him raving mad? No. . . . Make him
drunk? No. . . . On the contrary. Our Poussin demanded that I add
cognac to the mixture to give it a kick.</p>
<p>"By the time I had worked through the whole lot--every single
place in the bazaar where one could get a drink of any sort--I
had to confess that I was puzzled.</p>
<p>"Foiled, defeated, despairing? No. But puzzled, decidedly.</p>
<p>"I followed all our distinguished drinkers about, tracked them
to their lairs, spied upon them--in their own best interests,
<i>bien entendu</i>--but discovered nothing.</p>
<p>"For each one merely emerged on his feet, or on his ear, at
closing time, or at such time as, having spent his <i>sous,</i>
he could no longer maintain his position against the assaults of
mine host and his myrmidons.</p>
<p>"But whether he came out on his own feet or on a comrade's
back; whether he came out on his own back or beneath his
comrades' feet, dragged along by his own, he was no more drunk
than a good soldier should be.</p>
<p>"Every man of them was able to hit--or miss--a comrade, to
embrace him or to kick him, and if some weakling were not equal
to these feats, he was at least ordinarily peaceful, could easily
be dragged along the road, and be quietly, comfortably, thrown
into cells.</p>
<p>"Yes, I was puzzled, and by the time a week had passed, I was
worried as well as puzzled, for Le Sage was always a man of his
word, and I knew that if we had another such <i>delirium
tremens</i> case that Saturday night, I should get three weeks'
<i>cellule</i> punishment.</p>
<p>"Then Luck, Chance, Fate, or the Guardian Angel of all Good
Soldiers, or my own private Patron Saint, took a hand and came to
my help.</p>
<p>"There was a queer chap in the Company then, a Finn. I don't
know whether Finns are really Swedes, Russians, Eskimos, or a
kind of Red Indian, but they have very fine heads.</p>
<p>"Manly beauty? No, I don't mean that. Great brains and
intellect? No, that's not what I mean. When I say fine heads, I
mean very strong heads.</p>
<p>"They're rightly called Finns, for fins suggest fishes and
they can drink like fishes. In a manner of speaking, you might
say that all Finns are teetotallers, inasmuch as no Finn has ever
been seen the worse for liquor. No Finn ever gets drunk. He
can't.</p>
<p>"Well, one night, when I was sadly returning to Fort Bugeaud
very late--I had a permanent late pass, of course--I suddenly
almost stumbled over the body of one of our men.</p>
<p>"The corpse was lying with its feet in the gutter and its head
against the doorstep of a house.</p>
<p>"'<i>Mon Dieu!</i>' thought I. 'Murder! Stabbed in the back
for a handful of copper coins.'</p>
<p>"Stooping, I turned the body over, so that the moonlight fell
upon its face. It was Idensalmisen--the Finn whom I
mentioned.</p>
<p>"No need to close his eyes, as they were already shut. No need
to staunch his wound, as there wasn't one. No need to fetch a
stretcher-party for the body, as it suddenly heaved a sigh and
emitted a gentle snore.</p>
<p>"In my relief, and to show my pleasure, I fetched Idensalmisen
a good kick in the ribs. When I say a good kick, I mean one
calculated to rouse the dead--or the drunk.</p>
<p>"It did not rouse Idensalmisen, and as he was not dead,
obviously he must be drunk.</p>
<p>"Idensalmisen had broken the Finnish national record. He had
achieved the impossible. He had got drunk.</p>
<p>"But what, <i>what</i> could possibly have made Idensalmisen
drunk?</p>
<p>"And then my Patron Saint or the Guardian Angel of all Good
Soldiers opened the door of his guard-lantern and let in a great
light upon my brain.</p>
<p>"Of course! Of course! Ten Thousand Thundering Tin Devils
Capering Convulsively on a Corrugated Iron Roof! That which had
put Idensalmisen gently to sleep must be the Identical Drink that
had driven Maartens, Burgher, Père Poussin, Petrovitch and Krafft
raving mad, and had killed the French boy.</p>
<p>"It leapt to the eye. I felt certain that I was seeing
daylight--as well as moonlight--at last.</p>
<p>"And assuming that I was right, where had Idensalmisen got it?
Would he remember, when he recovered? And would he tell me if he
did remember?</p>
<p>"Both were possible, if not probable. Seeing that a poison,
which had sent five men mad and killed another, merely put the
good Idensalmisen peacefully to sleep, it seemed quite likely
that the same poison might have no effect upon the memory of the
granite-headed Finn.</p>
<p>"Another idea occurred to me--for, as you have noticed, I am a
man of ideas--and that was the notion that the house outside
which Idensalmisen was lying might very well be the one in which
he had been defeated. Defeated by the bottle, I mean.</p>
<p>"Judging from the way in which he was lying, his appearance,
and the cleanness and general condition of his uniform,
Idensalmisen had not been in trouble. He had not been fighting;
he had not been violently thrown out of a wine-shop; and he had
not been rolling about in the gutter.</p>
<p>"In fact, it seemed to me probable that he had stepped out of
the house, thought to himself, 'I feel very sleepy. I think I'll
have a nap,' had promptly lain down, and with the low door-step
for a pillow, peacefully composed himself to slumber.</p>
<p>"I looked up at the house.</p>
<p>"It was one of the best, or should I say, one of the least
bad, of the shops in the bazaar, a place kept by a camp-follower,
a sutler, who called himself a Greek because he was as much that
as anything, or perhaps because he was neither wholly Arab,
Negro, nor Mussulman.</p>
<p>"Anyhow, he dressed more or less like a European, wore a
<i>fez</i> cap and called himself Papadopoulos.</p>
<p>"<i>Les légionnaires</i> called him Papa Something-else in
recognition of the fact that, even for a half-caste Greek sutler,
he was something quite special.</p>
<p>"Yes, he was a bad one, that Monsieur Papadopoulos. And my
comrade Idensalmisen was lying outside his house.</p>
<p>"Well, as soon as the bright light, which I told you about,
illuminated my brain, I stopped kicking Idensalmisen and kicked
the door of Monsieur Papadopoulos instead.</p>
<p>"Getting no more result from kicking the door of Papadopoulos
than I had from kicking the ribs of Idensalmisen, I rested
awhile.</p>
<p>"Then for a time I kicked alternately at the door and the
Finn.</p>
<p>"When this again became monotonous, I desisted, sought for a
stone, found what I wanted, and threw it at the window which
opened on to the rickety verandah that overhung the ramshackle
shop of Monsieur Papadopoulos.</p>
<p>"Noises followed. A satisfactory crash, a tinkle of falling
glass, squeals, squeaks and squawks from frightened or delighted
or hopeful females, and a loud roar from Monsieur
Papadopoulos.</p>
<p>"'Thieves! Robbers! Assassins! Murder!' he bawled. 'What's
that?'</p>
<p>"'It was the Archangel Gabriel's slipper,' said I.</p>
<p>"'What?' shouted Papadopoulos, bounding out on to the verandah
in the shirt and trousers which evidently he wore in bed, as well
as out of bed. '<i>What? . . .</i> The Archangel Gabriel?'</p>
<p>"'Yes,' said I, 'and worse--the picket. Come down and open the
door at once.'</p>
<p>"I think Papa had gone to bed a little drunker than usual, or
perhaps had been awakened too suddenly, and was somewhat confused
in his mind. Anyhow, a minute later, bolts and bars were
withdrawn, the door unlocked and opened, and there stood Papa,
full of wrath, fear, bluster and liquor.</p>
<p>"'What's this?' he bawled.</p>
<p>"'A corpse,' said I. 'A murdered man. A <i>légionnaire.</i>
Killed in your house . . . assassinated by . . .'</p>
<p>"'Nonsense! Rubbish! He's . . .' spluttered Papa. 'Why, he
walked out of my shop as . . .'</p>
<p>"'O<i>ho!</i>' said I. 'A<i>ha!</i>' said I. 'Walked out of
<i>your</i> shop, did he? I thought so. Well, I'm going to walk
into it.'</p>
<p>"'You're not,' contradicted Papa, as he suddenly sat down, and
I stepped over him into the dark interior.</p>
<p>"'Assault!' shouted Papa. 'Battery! Robbery with violence!
Burglary!'</p>
<p>"'Murder too,' I agreed. 'If you don't light the lamp.' And I
drew my bayonet as noisily as I could.</p>
<p>"I was not going to stick Papa, of course. It was only for
what they call moral effect. Or immoral effect. Anyhow, Papa lit
the lamp as quickly as could reasonably be expected.</p>
<p>"'Now then,' said I. 'First of all, we'll bring the corpse
inside, and then we'll reconstruct the crime. Then I'll fetch the
picket to arrest you, so be careful--for anything you may say
will be twisted into evidence against you.'</p>
<p>"'I tell you I'm innocent,' shouted Papa.</p>
<p>"'Don't tell me,' I replied coldly. 'Tell Captain Le Sage. But
don't tell him more than once, unless you want to make him angry.
Come and fetch the body in before somebody else robs it. You take
the feet . . . so . . .'</p>
<p>"Reverently we laid the body of Idensalmisen on the floor
beneath the lamp, and I closed and locked the door.</p>
<p>"'Now then,' said I. 'Tell me exactly what happened.'</p>
<p>"Papadopoulos had been pulling himself together, and what
brain he had was beginning to work.</p>
<p>"'Happened?' he blustered. 'How do I know what happened? I
never saw him before in my life. Is it my fault that somebody
knocked the drunken dog on the head, outside my shop? . . . Are
you such a fool as not to know that when they murder a man in one
of the dives, they always lay his body outside somebody
<i>else's</i> house?'</p>
<p>"'Oh, that's your habit and custom, is it, Monsieur
Papadopoulos?' I replied. 'Well, we'll use that piece of evidence
against you. Now then, stop lying, and tell the truth. Directly
you saw, by the pure cold light of the moon, the poor dead face
of my murdered comrade, the first words you uttered were,</p>
<p>"'"He walked out of my shop."</p>
<p>"'Those were your very words, your voluntary free confession.
And to that I'll take my solemn oath before the drum-head
court-martial that to-morrow will sentence you to be shot.'</p>
<p>"I spoke like Justice Incarnate, cold, incorruptible,
remorseless, inexorable, inevitable--and Papadopoulos was badly
shaken.</p>
<p>"He began to wilt, to tremble, to pale beneath his dirt.</p>
<p>"'Soldiers of France are not murdered,' I began.</p>
<p>"Idensalmisen emitted a loud snore.</p>
<p>"'No,' agreed Papadopoulos quickly. 'They get drunk.'</p>
<p>"He perked up visibly, shrugged his shoulders and laughed
loudly. Papadopoulos was himself again.</p>
<p>"But I had been myself the whole time.</p>
<p>"'Soldiers of France are not murdered with impunity, I was
about to say,' I resumed, 'and soldiers of France are being
poisoned, assassinated, murdered, destroyed in this foul den,
this sewer, this sink of iniquity.'</p>
<p>"'That one, for example?' sneered Papadopoulos, as
Idensalmisen snored again.</p>
<p>"'Yes, that one, <i>par exemple.</i> That one, now dying at
your feet. That one who will soon be as dead as poor young
D'Alvers, the son of a General. Yes, <i>Monsieur l'Assassin,</i>
what of D'Alvers, now lying stiff beneath the sand? . . .
Poisoned by you. . . . What of him and of my other comrades,
Maartens, Burgher, Poussin, Petrovitch, Krafft? All dead; all
murdered; all poisoned. . . . And who all died accusing
<i>you.</i>'</p>
<p>"'What?' cried Papadopoulos, aghast.</p>
<p>"'Yes,' said I. 'All dead . . . and this one dying. . . . All
poisoned here.'</p>
<p>"I knew he could not have seen any of the five, for those who
weren't in the holes labelled <i>Cells,</i> were in the similar
hole labelled <i>Hospital.</i></p>
<p>"'Now will you tell me the truth? Or must . . . ?'</p>
<p>"And I pointed the question--with the tip of my bayonet, to
which Papa's paunch seemed to act as a powerful magnet.</p>
<p>"'What?' cried Papadopoulos again. 'Dead? Died accusing
<i>me?</i>'</p>
<p>"'Yes, <i>Monsieur l'Assassin,</i>' I replied. 'Poisoned by
you, Mr. Retail-Grocer-and-Wholesale-Murderer.</p>
<p>"'Your infamous name will live. Live to be spat upon by all
decent men, and coupled with those of the most notorious and
infamous criminals, the scum of the earth.</p>
<p>"'Now then, once again and for the last time, how did you
poison them? What dreadful drink did you give to these splendid
men, these distinguished drinkers, these men who could drink
anything without turning a hair, much less without turning the
whole place upside-down? What did you give them, I say?'</p>
<p>"'What did I give them?' snarled Papadopoulos. 'What should I
give them but a bottle of good honest <i>pinard?</i> If I ever
gave them anything at all, that is to say. I doubt if I ever set
eyes on one of them. What do I know of your silly Burghers and
cunning Kraffts and Spring Poussins? What <i>you</i> want . .
.'</p>
<p>"And suddenly he stopped, and a look of slyness, an artful
smile, and the light of an idea illuminated his dull and greasy
countenance.</p>
<p>"'Yes?' I drawled sneeringly. What <i>you</i> want, I say, is
a drink,' continued Papadopoulos.</p>
<p>"And, even as he spoke, I saw his game, I got his idea, I
followed his train of thought! A very nice train, too, <i>mes
amis,</i> and going in the right direction; in fact, straight to
the very point at which I wanted to arrive.</p>
<p>"They are curious, these sudden premonitions, revelations,
illuminations; these <i>je ne sais quoi</i>--whereby one knows,
with absolute certainty, what is about to happen, what is about
to be said, what is about to be done . . . perhaps some trivial,
inconsequent thing . . . perhaps something of the first magnitude
and highest importance.</p>
<p>"Before he said another word, I knew with absolute certainty
that <i>ce bon</i> Papa was going to pour me out a bottle of the
identical high-explosive that had shattered my five comrades,
blown poor young D'Alvers to Hell, and put Idensalmisen gently to
sleep.</p>
<p>"I was right.</p>
<p>"'You wait one moment,' said Papa, 'and I'll give you a bottle
of the best wine you ever tasted. None of your Algerian slops.
Some real Greek wine that's travelled thousands of miles and cost
me an incredible amount for carriage alone. And if I give you a
bottle of this priceless stuff, you've got to carry this
dog's-body out again, and get him along the road. . . . Get him
back to the Fort. You wouldn't abandon a comrade in distress,
would you? . . . Leave him for the picket to find? . . .'</p>
<p>"I could have laughed aloud. Instead, I smiled pleasantly.</p>
<p>"This was good. This marched indeed. Papa was going to put me
to sleep, too--or to death; or else send me raving mad like
Messieurs Burgher, Maartens, Poussin, Krafft and Petrovitch. He
was going to produce a bottle of the very stuff, the
poison--stronger than a cocktail of arsenic, strychnine and
prussic acid--of which I was in search.</p>
<p>"<i>Bon.</i> I had deserved well of My Captain. I, Tant de
Soif, had done as he had bidden. I had discovered the man, the
place and the potion.</p>
<p>"My smile must have grown wolfish, for, without another word,
Papa waddled off, leaving me alone with the body of my comrade
and the stock-in-trade of Monsieur Papadopoulos.</p>
<p>"Promptly I 'decorated myself' with a few useful and
profitable articles, until, hearing the clip-clop of the
returning slippers of Papa, I again kicked Idensalmisen in the
ribs, and then bending tenderly over him, held his hand and
soothed his brow.</p>
<p>"'Yes, he is dying,' I said, as Papa entered the shop from the
door at the back, behind the counter. 'Dying here in a foreign
land so far from home and . . .'</p>
<p>"'Well, drown sorrow then, <i>légionnaire,'</i> interrupted
Papa brutally, as with a loud pop he drew a cork and poured a
yellowish liquid, heavy and oily-looking, into a mug.</p>
<p>"'There,' he said, 'drink that, and you'll feel better. . . .
Then you help your dying comrade home.'</p>
<p>"I picked the mug up and smelt the stuff.</p>
<p>"Now of what did it remind me? I wonder if you've noticed--but
of course you must have done--how smells evoke memories. Yes,
much more than sounds or sights. I never smell a tannery without
seeing a certain town in France where I had happy days. . . . I
can never smell a certain flower without immediately seeing a
girl who--But we're talking of the poison of Papadopoulos. . .
.</p>
<p>"Directly I smelt this 'wine ', I had a vision of my Section
at work on a ground-clearing fatigue. I was hacking-down and
grubbing-up <i>lentisk</i> bushes.</p>
<p>"I beheld the scene as distinctly as I now smelt resin. . . .
'Greek wine!' We got some once, I remembered, on the way to
Saigon--or was it Beyrout? Anyhow, we got it at Alexandria. They
called it Greek wine, and we called it stewed pine-bark, boiled
resin, and extract of fir-cone.</p>
<p>"'Drink it, man, drink it. Drink it down,' urged Papa. 'You a
<i>légionnaire,</i> and afraid of a half-litre of fine wine!'</p>
<p>"Cautiously I tasted it, just a sip.</p>
<p>"Name of a name! But it was fiery stuff. It was real drink. It
made <i>tchum-tchum</i>--a sip of which will knock a mule
down--seem like milk, seem like a bland and gentle beverage for
the weaning of tender infants.</p>
<p>"Tilting back my head I filled my mouth. It burnt it. My
friends, that distilled brimstone burnt the mouth of Tant de
Soif. The mere fumes of it affected my brain.</p>
<p>"Staggering to the door of the shop, mug in hand, I lurched
out into the street, emptied my mouth into the gutter--and
smacked my lips.</p>
<p>"I could taste nothing, feel nothing.</p>
<p>"<i>Mon Dieu!</i> What marvellous stuff! What a temptation!
Bottled Satan!</p>
<p>"Did I fall? Did I falter? Did I fail? Did I show myself
unworthy of My Captain's trust? No. A thousand times no!</p>
<p>"I thought of Le Sage and said, 'Get thee behind me, bottled
Satan.'</p>
<p>"I thought of three weeks in a black but red-hot cell . . .
and I was true to my trust, faithful to my master, loyal to my
officer.</p>
<p>"'Get thee behind me, Papadopoulos,' I bawled; dashed the
contents of the mug upon the ground; and stormed back into the
shop.</p>
<p>"'I'm drunk,' I roared. 'I'm mad. I'm the Archangel Gabriel. .
. .'</p>
<p>"Papadopoulos sniggered.</p>
<p>"'That's so, <i>légionnaire</i>,' he said. 'You are, and
you'll be in Heaven in a minute. That way to Heaven, through the
door, and turn to your left. Take your <i>copain</i> with you.
Come on, catch hold. . . .'</p>
<p>"And a minute later, Idensalmisen and I were out in the street
and Papa's door was banged, barred and bolted behind us.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 2</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"'<i>Bon, mon enfant,</i>' said Captain Le Sage next morning
when I told him of the adventure of the night.</p>
<p>"'And <i>le légionnaire</i> Idensalmisen is still asleep, is
he? . . . H'm. . . . While ideas were flowing so freely into your
otherwise empty skull, you didn't get the bright idea of bringing
the bottle along with you, I suppose? . . . No? . . . You
wouldn't. Would you know it again, or a similar one?'</p>
<p>"'But yes, <i>mon Capitaine.</i> Half-litre size, with sloping
shoulders, rather like a hock-bottle; indentation in the base and
a thickened rim round the neck."</p>
<p>"'Most observant. First-class scout--among bottles,' said Le
Sage. 'Good. You are excused--cells. I'll think about that franc.
Return to duty. Tell Sergeant Salzburger that I shall accompany
the picket to-night, and that he's to take you.'</p>
<p>"Oh yes, <i>mes amis,</i> Le Sage was like that.</p>
<p>"Sure enough, out he marched with the picket that evening, and
went into every wine-shop in the place.</p>
<p>"Oh, but it was amusing!</p>
<p>"Salzburger would kick open the door, call out, '<i>Garde à
vous,</i>' and everyone would jump up and spring to
attention.</p>
<p>"Then Le Sage would stalk in and look round, and there would
be some funny sights as a drunken man would be wedged upright
between two faithful comrades, or a more drunken one shoved under
a divan. . . .</p>
<p>"One splendid fellow, all present and correct, stood
magnificently to attention--with a basin on his head. . . .</p>
<p>"The procedure in each place was the same.</p>
<p>"Having satisfied himself that all things were in order, and
that every <i>légionnaire</i> who should have a pass had got it,
Le Sage smiled in a fatherly manner, and then, in his most brutal
voice, ordered everyone to clear out immediately and to report at
the <i>poste</i> as soon as possible or a good deal sooner. Back
to barracks at the <i>pas gymnastique. . .</i> .</p>
<p>"You'd have thought there was a road-Marathon in progress.</p>
<p>"And, last of all, we came to the shop of Monsieur
Papadopoulos. The same there.</p>
<p>"'<i>Garde à vous! . . . Fixe! . . .</i> Show all passes. . .
. Excellent.'</p>
<p>"And then,</p>
<p>"'Sergeant Salzburger, take names. Every man, drunk or sober,
dead or alive, to be inside Fort Bugeaud within five
minutes.'</p>
<p>"You should have seen them jump to it--and run for it. Believe
me, My Captain was a disciplinarian.</p>
<p>"'Carry on, Sergeant Salzburger,' says he, as soon as the shop
was empty.</p>
<p>"'Close the door and guard it, Tant de Soif,' he added, as the
picket tramped off.</p>
<p>"And you can bet that having closed the door, I mounted guard
on the <i>in</i>side.</p>
<p>"Then Le Sage turned to Papadopoulos, who was looking mighty
uncomfortable, and a bit yellower than usual.</p>
<p>"'Now, my friend,' said Le Sage, and seated himself at a
little table by the counter. 'I must apologize
for--er--disturbing harmony and--er--possibly interfering with
business and--er--curtailing profits and--er--spoiling sport, and
all that. However, we'll have a little harmony all to ourselves,
you and I, shall we . . . and perhaps a little--er--profit,
eh?'</p>
<p>Papadopoulos spread his big hands abroad and raised his
shoulders above his ears.</p>
<p>"'<i>M-Monsieur le C-Commandant</i> . . .' he stammered.</p>
<p>"'Yes, a little harmony and a little profit. You and I are
going to crack a bottle together, Monsieur Papadopoulos. Or
better still, we'll have a bottle each. More profit, eh, Monsieur
Papadopoulos, if not more harmony!</p>
<p>"'Yes, a bottle each. Now, first of all, you fetch me a bottle
of your very best. The very best you've got, Monsieur
Papadopoulos.'</p>
<p>"'<i>Monsieur le Commandant,</i> it is too much honour for my
poor wine-shop. <i>Hélas!</i> I have nothing worthy; nothing
better than the wine of Algérie, only poor <i>pinard!</i>'</p>
<p>"'And it's half water, eh? And dirty water at that. Well, it
has to be good enough for my brave fellows, so it has to be good
enough for me. Bring me a bottle.'</p>
<p>"With more waggles of his great hands and shrugs of his fat
shoulders, Papadopoulos began another apology: but as Le Sage
eyed him with the tigerish glare--that could make even us
<i>légionnaires</i> tremble--and picked up his riding-whip,
Papadopoulos leapt about and seized a bottle from the scores
arrayed on the shelf behind him.</p>
<p>"With this and a glass and a corkscrew in his hands, he
galloped round the counter, placed the glass on the table before
Le Sage, drew the cork and poured out the wine.'</p>
<p>"Picking up the glass, Le Sage smelt the wine, tasted it, and
replaced the glass upon the table.</p>
<p>"'Like a kind of wine,' he said. 'There's a smell and a
flavour about it that suggests a sort of . . . almost . . .
should one say? . . . a species of bad claret, <i>hein? . . .</i>
H'm. Now a bottle for Monsieur Papadopoulos. Yes, a bottle for
Monsieur Papadopoulos, and he and I will sit down and drink
together--in harmony . . . and with profit.'</p>
<p>"'Oh, <i>M'sieu le Commandant.</i> It is too great an honour .
. . far, far too great an honour,' gabbled Papadopoulos.</p>
<p>"'I agree,' assented Le Sage. 'But get your bottle.'</p>
<p>"With a somewhat shaky hand, Papadopoulos returned behind the
counter and took another bottle from the same shelf--a bottle
exactly like the one he had given Le Sage.</p>
<p>"'Oh dear me, no,' protested Le Sage, as Papadopoulos turned
round with the bottle in his hand. 'Surely <i>Monsieur le
Propriétaire</i> doesn't propose to drink the same poor stuff as
he gives his customers. Most unfitting! We're not driven to that
yet, I think. No, no, put that back, Monsieur Papadopoulos, and
get yourself a bottle of your best, your rarest, your
ripest.'</p>
<p>"'But <i>M'sieu le Commandant,</i> I assure you, with my hand
on my heart,' began Papadopoulos.</p>
<p>"'And I'll assure you with my hand on your throat,' replied Le
Sage, 'if you don't do what I tell you. You go and get a bottle
of that rare old Greek wine, the fine grand wine that has
travelled thousands of miles and cost you an incredible amount
for carriage alone. Leave me the Algerian slops, and get
<i>Monsieur le Propriétaire</i>--as is only fitting--a bottle of
that priceless stuff, that "best wine he ever tasted".'</p>
<p>"'<i>M'sieu le Commandant</i>,' whimpered Papadopoulos, 'I do
not understand. . . .'</p>
<p>"'No? Well, get a bottle of the wine you gave my rascals,
Burgher and Maartens and Krafft and Poussin and Petrovitch. Yes,
and poor young D'Alvers. Get a bottle of the wonderful wine you
opened last night for that scoundrel over there.'</p>
<p>"And swinging his great body round, Le Sage pointed at me.</p>
<p>"I thought he'd forgotten all about me, or supposed that I had
mounted guard outside the door--and I knew that, in the confusion
and his general fear and perturbation, Papadopoulos had not
noticed me.</p>
<p>"'Come here, <i>salaud,</i>' shouted Le Sage. And in a smart
and soldierly manner I marched forward and stood to attention in
the light of the lamp.</p>
<p>"'Recognize him?' he growled at Papadopoulos. 'He's the man
you didn't poison last night. The one you did poison is still
asleep.'</p>
<p>"Papadopoulos stared at me and his loose mouth fell open.</p>
<p>"'Wonderful feller, isn't he?' jeered Le Sage. 'All merry and
bright, smart and smiling--after drinking a bottle of your rare
Greek wine--perhaps.</p>
<p>"'<i>Rare Greek wine!</i>' he growled. 'Well, it's going to be
rarer.</p>
<p>"'Go and get a bottle, quick,' he snapped.</p>
<p>"'It's finished, <i>M'sieu le Commandant.</i> I swear to God
that was the last bottle. It's finished.'</p>
<p>"'What's finished?' asked Le Sage quietly.</p>
<p>"Papadopoulos bit his knuckle.</p>
<p>"'The wine, Excellency.'</p>
<p>"What wine?'</p>
<p>"'The . . . the . . . the . . . the wine you were talking
about.'</p>
<p>"'Ah? Yes? The wine that killed my <i>légionnaire.</i> So you
did sell it to them, did you? Until it was finished, eh?'</p>
<p>"Le Sage rose to his feet and I thought Papadopoulos was going
to fall down.</p>
<p>"'Listen, my good Papadopoulos,' said Le Sage in his softest,
silkiest voice. 'Be wise. Be advised. Go and find just one more
bottle of the rare old Greek wine.'</p>
<p>"'Excellency, there isn't one. There's not one left. Before
God, I swear . . .'</p>
<p>"'Last chance, Monsieur Papadopoulos. Go and get a bottle of
the rare old Greek wine. I don't swear anything at all, but I do
most faithfully promise that it will be worse for you if I have
to get it myself.</p>
<p>"'And mind you,' he added, 'I'll find it all right, if I have
to bring my men here and pull the place to pieces. . . . Now I'll
give you one minute in which to go and get a bottle--half-litre
size, sloping shoulders, like a hock-bottle, base indented, and
rim round the neck, eh?'</p>
<p>"And Le Sage glanced at the watch on his left wrist, as he
took up his riding-whip in his right hand.</p>
<p>"With the sweat running down his fat face, Papadopoulos threw
his hands downward, outward and apart, as though he were pulling
open a concertina, shrugged his shoulders, shook his head, cast
up his eyes, and turned to the door behind him.</p>
<p>"'Go with him, you,' snapped Le Sage.</p>
<p>"Nothing loth, I saluted, dashed round the counter and through
the doorway, in pursuit of Papa.</p>
<p>"Down a short flight of steps he waddled into a sort of cellar
or <i>silo,</i> dimly lighted by a native lamp.</p>
<p>"'<i>Sh!</i>' whispered Papa, glancing apprehensively over his
shoulder. 'What about a ten-franc note--and the wrong bottle,
<i>hein?</i> Ten francs. . . . A thousand centimes. A clean, new
ten-franc note. . . .'</p>
<p>"I felt that if I were exceeding my duty and going beyond my
instructions in fetching Papa a kick, I could plead excess of
zeal.</p>
<p>"It was a good kick.</p>
<p>"I exceeded again.</p>
<p>"Papa, with a groan, and what I think was a wicked word in
Greek, scurried to the corner of the cellar and picked out one of
a mound of bottles, lying on their sides, piled one upon the
other.</p>
<p>"It was of the right size and shape, anyhow, whatever it might
contain.</p>
<p>"'Ah!' smiled Le Sage, as we re-entered the shop. 'Found one,
have you, Monsieur Papadopoulos? Good. Now, open it and come and
sit down.'</p>
<p>"'<i>M'sieu le Commandant,</i> it is too much honour. I . .
.'</p>
<p>"'Open that bottle, pour out a glass, and sit down on that
chair.'</p>
<p>"Trembling, with shaking hands, Papa obeyed as best he
might.</p>
<p>"'Ah, a golden wine,' observed Le Sage. 'Wine of Chios? . . .
Allow me.'</p>
<p>"And picking up the glass, Le Sage smelt the liquor.</p>
<p>"'H'm. Curious. Also resinous. D'you know, my friend, anyone
who did not know that this was rare old Greek wine might be
forgiven for thinking it was <i>raki</i> or <i>arrak</i> or
medicine . . . or furniture polish . . . or <i>mastic?</i></p>
<p>"'D'you know, Monsieur Papadopoulos, that that's what I should
have called it--<i>mastic?</i> Just nasty, dangerous, deadly
poisonous <i>mastic.</i> However, I'm glad I'm wrong. I'm glad
it's rare old Greek wine--for your sake. Drink it up.'</p>
<p>"'But <i>M'sieu le Commandant,</i> your Excellency, I never
drink. I'm a man of the most abstemious . . . the most teetotal .
. .'</p>
<p>"Le Sage laughed.</p>
<p>"'Come, come, Monsieur Papadopoulos. Abstemious of truth,' he
said. 'A teetotaller there, all right.'</p>
<p>"Papadopoulos spread piteous, appealing hands.</p>
<p>"'In fact, you're a damned liar,' continued Le Sage. 'You go
to bed drunk, or as drunk as you can get, every night of your
life.'</p>
<p>"And then his voice changed suddenly and sharply.</p>
<p>"'Drink that up,' he ordered, and unfastened the flap of his
pistol holster.</p>
<p>"Really pale by this time, and with a hand that shook till the
'wine' spilt, Papadopoulos obeyed.</p>
<p>"'Ah!' smiled Le Sage, and sipped at his own drink. 'A glass
of wine with Monsieur Papadopoulos!</p>
<p>"'Fill up again,' he said in his orderly-room voice, a minute
later, 'and don't spill any.'</p>
<p>"'<i>M'sieu le Commandant,</i> I beseech . . .'</p>
<p>"Le Sage put his hand on the butt of his revolver.</p>
<p>"'At once,' he said, and with a quick look round like that of
a trapped beast, a glance that came to rest on Le Sage's
half-drawn automatic, Papadopoulos again obeyed.</p>
<p>"'Ah!' smiled Le Sage, 'we'll call that Burgher's bottle, eh?
Now we'll have Maartens'. Then Krafft's. Then, after that,
Poussin's and Petrovitch's. Then one for Idensalmisen--who is
still asleep. And so we shall arrive at D'Alvers' bottle. Eh,
Monsieur Papadopoulos? D'Alvers' bottle. I hope we get as far as
D'Alvers' bottle.</p>
<p>"Papa hiccupped.</p>
<p>"'Oh, but a monumental, a colossal hiccup.</p>
<p>"'You should put your hand up when you do that,' rebuked Le
Sage.</p>
<p>"'Go and get Burgher's bottle,' he continued.</p>
<p>"'<i>M'sieu le Comma . . . Comma . . .</i> hic . . .'</p>
<p>"Le Sage made a threatening movement, and Papadopoulos lurched
to his feet.</p>
<p>"'Go with him, you,' ordered Le Sage.</p>
<p>"And again we went to the cellar.</p>
<p>"'Twenty fr . . . fr . . . <i>hic . . .</i> ancs,' hiccupped
Papadopoulos, and made toward a different heap of bottles.</p>
<p>"I kicked him twice.</p>
<p>"I could not lose twenty francs for less.</p>
<p>"For a teetotaller, Papa had a good head and a good
stomach.</p>
<p>"He opened the second bottle himself, poured out the two big
glasses one after the other, at Le Sage's word of command, and
drank them both.</p>
<p>"'Now, I think, a bottle for Krafft, eh?' suggested Le
Sage.</p>
<p>"Papa's reply was really inaudible, incoherent, and
incomprehensible; and it was quite obvious that the third bottle
would have to be brought for him.</p>
<p>"I fetched it and opened it, but Papadopoulos drank it.</p>
<p>"I imagined that the last of his powers to fail would be the
power of lifting a glass to his lips.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"They say, my friends, that there is good in everyone;
something to admire in the worst of us.</p>
<p>"By the time Le Sage had made Papadopoulos drink to the living
men, whom he had nearly killed, I began quite to admire him.
Papadopoulos was a really eminent drinker.</p>
<p>"Yes, I found myself admiring him.</p>
<p>"He couldn't talk, he couldn't walk, and I doubt if he could
see.</p>
<p>"But he could drink. He could drink, and he could understand
what was said to him.</p>
<p>"And so it went on.</p>
<p>"Then suddenly Le Sage said,</p>
<p>"'We will now drink to the <i>memory</i> of a man, a fine man,
a soldier who called himself D'Alvers. Open the bottle, Tant de
Soif, and fill the glass of Monsieur Papadopoulos.'</p>
<p>"I did so.</p>
<p>"Le Sage raised his glass.</p>
<p>"'To the memory of <i>le légionnaire</i> D'Alvers,' he said.
'Drink, Monsieur Papadopoulos.'</p>
<p>"For the last time, Papadopoulos obeyed. Lowering his head to
the glass, he drank suckingly . . . clutched the glass in his two
hands, drank from it, dropped it with a crash, and sprawled
across the table.</p>
<p>"'Hi! Wake up! . . . Manners, manners! . . . Sit up, man,'
cried Le Sage.</p>
<p>"But Papa could not sit up. In fact, he couldn't sit at all,
for suddenly he slumped, lurched from his chair, fell, and lay
sprawling on the floor.</p>
<p>"'Wake him up,' ordered Le Sage. 'Revive the gentleman. Bring
him round.'</p>
<p>"I rendered First Aid. . . . And Second. . . . And Third.</p>
<p>"I did things to Papa that should have raised the dead, let
alone the drunk. Things that should have galvanized a mummy into
life.</p>
<p>"Le Sage stood tapping the leg of his boot with his whip.</p>
<p>"'Well, you certainly found the stuff, my lad,' he said at
length. 'That was the genuine article, all right.'</p>
<p>"'<i>Oui, mon Capitaine,</i>' said I. 'I'm afraid I shan't be
able to bring him round--for some more. He's dead drunk.'</p>
<p>"Le Sage laughed.</p>
<p>"'He's drunk dead, too, <i>mon enfant,</i>' he said. 'Quite
dead.'</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"And, as always, My Captain was right.</p>
<p>"Papadopoulos was dead . . . dead as poor D'Alvers."</p>

<p> </p>
<p>I never quite got at the actual facts of this story--never
quite got hold of it properly. Perhaps that is why it interested
me so much; kept me guessing, as it were.</p>
<p>The peculiar circumstances in which it was told, and the
handicaps which hampered both teller and listener, offer good
enough excuse for any vagueness.</p>
<p>While listening to the story I felt that I was listening to
the truth--one of those strange human documents which carry
conviction.</p>
<p>Undeniably Krassilov had been what he said he had been. His
speech, face, ankles, wrists, hair, all bore mute testimony; and
his hands--particularly his hands.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>And how I should have liked to see the woman Katinka, and have
a talk with her. I may go that way, some day, and seek her
out.</p>
<p>There are women who are worth crossing the world to visit, let
alone merely crossing Europe.</p>
<p>Yes, if I ever go down the Danube again, I shall go and see
whether she is anything like the picture I have made of her.
Perhaps I shall go down the Danube on purpose.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Most prisons have their drawbacks. Some seem to aim at having
little else. I am not properly acquainted with English prisons,
as, upon the few occasions when I have sojourned in them, I have
been a guest, not of His Majesty, but of the Governor--and none
but the prisoners really know the prison.</p>
<p>Of French, African, Mexican, Colonial, Portuguese and Moroccan
and South American "military" prisons I have had some experience,
and can testify that the prisons of some of the South American
Republics are not to be recommended.</p>
<p>Certain captious and crapulous people who speak ill of French
prisons should try some of those of Central and Southern America.
Thereafter they would know when they are well off--if they had a
Thereafter.</p>
<p>Personally, I've found the military prison at G--, where I met
"Krassilov", very comfortable. True, bare feet are cold in wooden
sabots during the winter; and are cut till they bleed, by
rope-soled sandles, in the summer; the <i>cachot</i> is not a
nice place, and life is apt to be hectic in the <i>salle de
discipline;</i> the <i>boule</i> of dark saw-dust-and-acorn bread
is not appetizing; but apart from cold, hunger, solitary
confinement in the <i>cachot</i> underground cell, corporal
punishment in the <i>salle de discipline,</i> and sleeping on the
damp bare stones of a cell-floor at the whim of a warder, things
are quite comfortable.</p>
<p>What was really delightful was the hour in the yard when,
instead of marching round and round until the rope-soled
<i>espadrilles</i> made our feet bleed, we were allowed, or
rather ordered, to sit on the stone ledge that runs right round
the four walls.</p>
<p>Sitting there, each man in his own numbered place, with the
sun shining warmly upon the lucky ones whose seats faced it, one
could close one's eyes, hear the song of a bird, and imagine that
one was free, imagine that one had but to open one's eyes again
to see grass and trees; a desert, the sea, the <i>Place de
l'Opéra</i> at l'<i>heure d'absinthe,</i> Bond Street on a sunny
morning, the hunt crossing a green field . . .</p>
<p>Well, so one might see them, some day . . . perhaps.</p>
<p>Yes, that was very nice.</p>
<p>Krassilov's place was next to mine. We were not allowed to
talk, of course--hence the handicap to storytelling. If a
warder--and they were Corsicans to a man--saw a man talking, or
thought he saw a man talking, or thought he would think he saw a
man talking, he would give him a dose of <i>cachot.</i></p>
<p>And there he would sit in a darkness as of black velvet and a
silence that could be heard, for the number of days decreed.</p>
<p>If he were the sort of man whom warders do not like--and the
sorts of man whom Corsican warders do not like are numerous--he
might receive visitors in the <i>cachot;</i> three or more.</p>
<p>And when he emerged, on the completion of his sentence, he
would look as though he had been fighting. He had not been
fighting, really. No one could call it a fight when one of his
visitors held him while the other two or three hit him, though
accidents have been known to happen--to warders--even under such
conditions.</p>
<p>Anyhow, in these circumstances, conversation becomes
precarious, and story-telling, however disjointed and
fragmentary, really quite difficult.</p>
<p>Hence, as I've said before, the general unsatisfactoriness of
Krassilov's story.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Krassilov was really clever. He would sit, with a face of
stone, staring straight to his front; and, out of one corner of
his immobile mouth, would talk and talk and talk--in perfect
French or perfect English--until the patrolling guard was within
earshot.</p>
<p>So long as Krassilov was not heard talking, all was well, for
it would not be seen that he was doing so. I had not a tithe of
his skill and cleverness. I could not talk without moving my lips
nor cure myself of the natural habit of turning my head toward
him when I spoke to him.</p>
<p>Thus I could not question him, and, as I've said before, many
puzzles remain unsolved and will do until I meet Katinka--or,
indeed, Krassilov himself. This is hardly likely as, if he
survived his prison sentence, he has been returned to the
Legion.</p>
<p>So I am only able to give you his story as he gave it to me,
and then only after having afforded this apology and
explanation.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>"Married?" asked Krassilov, as we sat and stared in front of
us like the graven images of a temple wall.</p>
<p>With an imperceptible movement, I touched him twice with the
little finger of my hand that rested beside his upon the stone
bench.</p>
<p>This meant "No". Nor was I.</p>
<p>"Are you thinking of a woman?"</p>
<p>I touched his hand once, which meant "Yes".</p>
<p>"So am I. Katinka, the most amazing woman who ever lived.
Absolutely beautiful--truly beautiful--and with such a great good
heart . . . and such a wicked woman. Katinka!</p>
<p>"She keeps a sailors' dive in Galatz, and sells horrible
things to ships' firemen, greasers, deck-hands, and the dock-rats
and longshore scum. Horrible things; aniseed <i>mastika,</i>
sawdust gin, 'Jamaica' rum made in Roumania; local 'French'
cognac; imitation whisky, which is flavoured methylated spirit;
and Roumanian beer which, alas, is genuine; and the most terrible
<i>syrops, apéritifs</i> and liqueurs.</p>
<p>"She had one advertisement which she considered a special draw
for English seamen, a picture of a big bulbous bottle with red
cherries on the label, and, underneath it, the legend,</p>
<p>"'<i>Bestest English Cheery Brandey.</i>'</p>
<p>"I tasted it once and found it neither cheery nor brandy.</p>
<p>"Katinka! . . . Lovely, kind, sweet, savage, wicked woman--the
only other person alive who knows the true story of the
Double-Murder Post . . . the Death Post, as they call it in those
parts. The Greek told her his end of the story, and I told her my
end.</p>
<p>"Laugh! How Katinka did laugh . . . about the Greek. She saw
the hand of Providence in it. As well as mine, presumably.</p>
<p>"I'm not very fond of Greeks myself, but Katinka loathed them
all, for the sake of this one. He was a stranger and she took him
in.</p>
<p>"And he took her in.</p>
<p>"Swindled and robbed her, in return for what she'd given him.
And Katinka was a generous giver and had a lot to give.</p>
<p>"Mind you, she was a self-respecting woman, and, though
generous with her favours, her kissing went by favour. She never
. . ."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"<i>Stand! . . . Left turn! . . . March!"</i> . . . and off we
went again, round the prison yard.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>On another day Krassilov took up the tale again, and from what
he told me then, I now make this:--</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Greek, Skirios, according to the tale he told Katinka,
spent his happy youth and early manhood basking on the
sun-drenched cobbled quays of Piræus. His chief delight was to
sit and watch the panting Levantines, sturdy brown-legged
dock-labourers of every Eastern Mediterranean mixture and hue,
creed, and colour, as they sweated like beasts of burden beneath
their heavy loads.</p>
<p>It lent a brightness to the sky, a colour to the sea, warmth
to the sun, to watch them trotting up and down narrow bending
springing planks, on to, and off from, gaudily painted xebecs,
the shapely seaworthy vessels with high in-curving stem and
stern-posts, that are the direct descendants and replicas of the
pirate-ships of the ancient Corsairs of the Barbary coast.</p>
<p>Indeed, as they bowed themselves beneath the weight of the
various baled, boxed, and bottled products of the Ægean
archipelago, or of imports for the Islanders, these ill-paid
toilers of the deep might have taken comfort, and an added
delight in their interesting labours, from the knowledge that
they laboured where, twenty centuries earlier, their slave
ancestors performed similar tasks for Roman masters and on Roman
galleys, which, having a rounded stem and a pronounced 'tumble
home', some others of these present vessels closely
resembled.</p>
<p>The dignity of labour! What is it, compared with the dignity
of sitting at ease and watching labour?</p>
<p><i>Otium cum dignitate.</i></p>
<p>And so Skirios sat, at ease with dignity, his sole support a
fat and nagging wife, and enjoyed his sweet and simple life.</p>
<p>Well, on a soft spring morning, as this Skirios told his
Katinka, he awoke as usual, yawned, stretched himself;
contemplated the glorious sunshine from the balcony upon which he
lived, when at home; asked the high gods of Olympus why his wife
so exactly resembled what she was; gazed upon her with distaste;
ate his breakfast, and a portion of hers, with relish; and then
withdrew from her the light of his countenance and the comfort of
his presence.</p>
<p>Thinking no evil, and fearing none, he strolled along his
beloved quays, passed Island <i>caïques,</i> lateen-rigged
<i>feluccas</i> and assorted gondola-shaped coasting-craft, until
he finally came to anchor before a slovenly draggle-tailed
'parish-rigged' <i>volecera.</i></p>
<p>He chose this vessel for his contemplation as, here, the babel
towered highest, and the men who laboured to and fro discharging
her sacks of sand-ballast, were really working, really doing
feats of weight-lifting and balancing, properly earning the
appreciative attention with which he now honoured them.</p>
<p>Calm, content, peaceful and philosophic, gently bathed in the
warmed and soothing ozone, Skirios looked upon life and found it
good. All was for the best in this best of all possible
worlds.</p>
<p>Happy Skirios.</p>
<p>But call no man happy until he is dead.</p>
<p>Into the world of Skirios an unsavoury bundle of rags
precipitated itself, panted to suggest that it had been running,
drew breath, gulped, and with luscious grief announced, in few
words and much pantomime, that Madame Skirios, falling down the
long steep flight of steps that led to the Skirion eyrie, had
broken her neck and was dead.</p>
<p>And this was the first blow that a hitherto kindly Fate dealt
Skirios the Greek.</p>
<p>And what a blow was this that struck from beneath him, as it
were, the sole prop, stay, and support of his manhood.</p>
<p>Still was the hand that for so long had shielded him from the
awful horror of work; that had kept him well-fed, well-clad, and
clean.</p>
<p>A stroke of Fate indeed which, in a second, turned Skirios the
Greek from a gentleman of leisure into a man who, though far from
wanting work, badly needed it.</p>
<p>A blow indeed, that knocked poor Skirios right off the quays
of Heaven into a hell of a ship, which, flying the Red Ensign of
Great Britain, was owned by a Greek captain and manned largely by
Greek sailors and firemen.</p>
<p>With heavy heart, light pocket and empty stomach, Skirios
reluctantly accepted a sea-going appointment and, upon a day,
left his native shores--as a Messroom Steward.</p>
<p>Greek met Greek when the Chief Steward tried to make Skirios
work twenty hours a day.</p>
<p>Skirios knew there was no law against this. He also knew that,
provided he avoided the heinous crime of 'refusing duty', there
was no law to prevent his striving to gain the world's record for
doing the minimum of work in the maximum of time.</p>
<p>The Chief Steward, admitting that his respect for Skirios
almost equalled his dislike of him, also admitted himself beaten,
and laid the matter, and the body of Skirios, before the
Captain.</p>
<p>Captain Logodedes, a man of humour, promptly promoted Skirios
to Ordinary Seaman, and put him at the disposal of the Mate.</p>
<p>Again Greek met Greek, and the greater set the lesser to
trimming a cargo of lead ore and, with picturesque imagery,
informed Skirios that he was going to make him sweat.</p>
<p>It is a curious and perhaps humiliating thought that, had
Skirios but perspired, the deaths of two men would have been
avoided.</p>
<p>In delicate and dilettante fashion he did toy for a time with
lead ore, and, though the zealous Mate worked wonders of
mateliness, he failed to hurry Skirios. So signally did he fail,
that he offered heavily to back him to lose a race against an
enhæmorrhaged limpet.</p>
<p>Upon the swarthy visage of Skirios not one drop of
perspiration could he induce. Nor all his piety nor wit could
squeeze out a single drop of it.</p>
<p>The Mate, admitting that his respect for Skirios far exceeded
his dislike of him, refused to admit himself beaten. He had said
that Skirios should sweat, and sweat he should, even though
others should behold this portent.</p>
<p>In the stoke-hole--whether he work or not--even Skirios must
perspire, and the Mate delivered him over to the Second Engineer.
Here, Greek met Scot, and there was no tug-of-war.</p>
<p>The Greek was handed a heavy shovel, told to trim coal, and
the Mate was justified of his faith, for Skirios took one look at
the Second Engineer and the Black Squad, and sweated in
anticipation. Anticipation of bad trouble, for the face of the
Second Engineer prophesied it; and the tongues of the Black
Squad, of whom he had already fallen foul, promised it.</p>
<p>During the brief day of his unjust (mess) stewardship, he, in
his ignorance of sea-usage and his unawareness of its awful and
ineluctable sanctity and sacredness, had made a very bad break
indeed. He had given, for a consideration, <i>bien entendu,</i>
scraps from the cabin tables to such of the deck-hands as
sufficiently desired them.</p>
<p>Now a custom, as old as the mechanical propulsion of ships,
decrees that the leavings, remnants, and remains of all meals
served at cabin tables shall be sent in their entirety and in the
second dog-watch straight to the firemen's fo'c'sle. Here a stew
is made of them, a savoury mess, known in British ships as Black
Cap. Woe to the man who should endeavour to fit Black Cap to any
but a fireman's head.</p>
<p>Woe to Skirios: for one, Mikhail Dulaspoff, had, with his own
eyes, seen him do this thing; seen him sell cabin-leavings to a
deck-hand.</p>
<p>Mikhail Dulaspoff, groping dimly in his not ill-lit nor
ill-furnished mind, for something in the nature of a punishment
that should fit the crime, conceived the bright idea of seeing
whether the cap would fit the head--the Black Cap, that is to
say--and at the first opportunity, crowned Skirios with the kid
from which the luscious stew had just been poured.</p>
<p>The kid or pot was very hot, very greasy, and did not fit,
being far too big and completely obscuring the handsome features
of Skirios, ears and all.</p>
<p>The other members of the Black Squad, hugely amused, applauded
the vastly diverting spectacle, and, unlike Skirios, did not
object to the head of Skirios being inside their cooking-pot.</p>
<p>Doubtless it was very funny; doubtful whether the Russian
would still have thought it so, had he been a thought-reader.
Blank of countenance, Skirios the Greek, sitting in judgment on
Mikhail Dulaspoff, passed silent sentence upon him and, in a
double sense, the Black Cap was on the judge's head.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"<i>Stand! . . .</i> <i>Left turn! . . .</i> <i>March!"</i> .
. . Curse the damned warder.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Again seated beside my friend and fellow-convict--military
convict, <i>bien entendu</i>; and a man may be a military convict
for daring to say 'No', or for a crime that would cost a civilian
anything from five francs to nothing--my fellow-convict
Krassilov, I waited hopefully to hear his soft ventriloquial
voice resume its stream of witty monologue, humorous, sardonic,
and amusing.</p>
<p>"Yes, our poor friend Skirios must have talked a lot about
himself to Katinka while he was in favour.</p>
<p>"Oh that Katinka! . . . If that Roumanian girl, with her touch
of <i>tzigan</i> gipsy blood, could but have had a bigger stage .
. . she would have held it . . . Fit to be a King's mistress and
a power behind the throne.</p>
<p>"And there she was, mistress of a wine-shop and a Skirios.</p>
<p>"That Skirios! . . . And Mikhail Dulaspoff! . . ."</p>
<p>My friend laughed softly. A curious laugh.</p>
<p>"Mikhail Dulaspoff . . . I can tell you something about
him--from personal knowledge . . . oh, very personal
knowledge.</p>
<p>"Of the true spy breed. Not the spy that risks his life in
enemy countries in war-time. But the police-spy, the informer,
the stool-pigeon; the double-dyed, double-damned scoundrel who'd
implicate his own mother in something, sell her to the police for
five roubles, and testify against her in Court for five more.</p>
<p>"Mikhail Dulaspoff! That dog! No; vermin that the village cur
would scratch from itself in disgust.</p>
<p>"However, Mikhail Dulaspoff got what he earned, and, after a
dog's life, died a dog's death, as you shall hear.</p>
<p>"And meanwhile he was leading a dog's life in hiding and
disguise as a fireman on this ship--he who had been, and might
still have been, a well-paid naval artificer. He was a big strong
man, something of a coward, and a great bully.</p>
<p>"Doubtless, while hiding about the purlieus of the wharves and
dock-streets of his native Odessa, he had found plenty of
dock-rats, pimps, panders, crimps'-touts and such other
nimble-witted herring-gutted scum, whom he could bully.</p>
<p>"But among seamen, be they deck-hands or firemen--I think you
call them stokers ashore, don't you?--there are very few
weaklings, and these few play the rôle of the bullied but
poorly.</p>
<p>"At sea, Mikhail Dulaspoff had found the sport of bullying and
baiting disappointing. In the darkness of the middle watch, the
victim was apt to be careless and elusive. One such had
allowed--quite accidentally, of course--an ash-bucket to fall
from above on the spot where Mikhail Dulaspoff had been standing
but a second before. Do you know what a ship's ash-bucket weighs?
. . . No, nor do I, but if one fell on me now, I should never
speak again.</p>
<p>"Then too, on a previous voyage, whilst engaged in 'scaling'
the inside of a boiler, Mikhail Dulaspoff had been so grievously
scalded that, when hauled unconscious through the man-hole, he
had been nearly dead.</p>
<p>"Doubtless the steam had been turned on by accident, by
mistake, or in error--but it had been done, curiously enough, by
the man whom Mikhail Dulaspoff had elected to bully.</p>
<p>"Hence the arrival in the stoke-hole of Skirios the Greek,
already marked out for punishment by reason of his simony when
mess-steward, brought lip-licking joy to the heart of Mikhail
Dulaspoff, as he promised himself rare sport, true sport--that is
to say, sport without danger.</p>
<p>"The poor Johnny Greeko was so devoid of spirit, so flabby, so
mean a worm, that retaliation simply need not be imagined.</p>
<p>"But it is a long worm that has no turning, and this
particular specimen was really more of a snake.</p>
<p>"Nor could it be said that the sport itself came up to
expectation, for the creature's very lack of spirit spoilt it.
You can't hunt a beast that will not run, nor bring down a bird
that will not rise. What apparently feels no pain cannot, with
any real satisfaction, be tormented; and Skirios apparently
enjoyed the very practical jokes which Mikhail Dulaspoff played
on him.</p>
<p>"Did a well-aimed lump of coal hit the communal tin of
oatmeal-water from which Skirios was drinking, he was the first
to applaud the sureness of aim with which the bully had prevented
him from moistening his furnace-parched throat.</p>
<p>"When Skirios suddenly leapt and wildly clutched at the
burning cigarette-end dropped down the back of his neck, his own
laughter was as loud as that of the rest.</p>
<p>"So, by cheerfulness and good temper, Skirios won the
contemptuous half-liking of the stoke-hole, and gradually such
crude jests as the addition of paraffin to his drinking-water, or
the anointing of his luxurious curling locks with dirty
engine-oil, became more and more infrequent, until at last
Mikhail Dulaspoff's persecution palled, turned to boredom, and
died a natural death.</p>
<p>"Then came the turn of Skirios the Greek, who smiled and
smiled and was a villain, cunningly, slowly and imperceptibly
contriving that Mikhail Dulaspoff's dead persecution should be
resuscitated as cultivation. He set himself to work to win the
friendship and affection of the man who had despised and bullied
him."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"<i>You Krassilov. You spoke</i>."</p>
<p>My comrade rose to his feet, stood at attention and, as the
warder bore down upon him, removed his <i>beret</i> and stood
bareheaded, as is the law. Very right and proper too. Who is a
military prisoner that he should stand covered in the presence of
a Corsican guard?</p>
<p>"I, <i>Monsieur le Brigadier</i>? Talking?"</p>
<p>"Yes. You. Talking. Or was it that <i>salaud</i> next to
you?"</p>
<p>I gazed to my front, apparently deaf, dumb, blind and
silly.</p>
<p>"No, <i>Monsieur le Brigadier</i>."</p>
<p><i>"</i>Then it was you, was it?"</p>
<p>"I, <i>Monsieur le Brigadier?</i> Talking?"</p>
<p>"Well, I'll report you for three days' <i>cachot,</i> anyhow.
If you weren't talking then, it'll do for next time. Sit."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"What was I saying when that crumbling crippled <i>cretin</i>
of a cock-eyed Corsican corruption interrupted me? One of these
days I'll smite him on the left cheek and then turn unto me his
right cheek also. It would be worth what I should get. I'll . .
."</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>"Stand! . . .</i> <i>Left turn! . . . March! . . ."</i> Off
again. Great life, this.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Do you know Galatz? The gentle and joyless Roumanian town of
Galatz? No? Well, don't. It only affords the visitor one
pleasure, and that's the pleasure of getting out of it.</p>
<p>"A few miles east of it--I don't think any hero has ever
tarried long enough to measure the exact distance--the starboard
bank of the Danube (and that's a yellow, treacherous,
fast-running river) is broken by an excavation known as the
Baderland Dock. Here, surrounded by innumerable and colossal
piles of timber, ships take on dangerous towering deck-cargoes
until they themselves resemble floating timber-yards.</p>
<p>"Such foolish and misguided mariners as leave the Baderland
Dock for the town of Galatz, must traverse a road--<i>sous ce nom
là!</i>--rough, pot-holed, deep-pitted and, of necessity, raised
high above the surrounding marsh land.</p>
<p>"On both sides, at both ends of this track, lived
dock-labourers and other working-folk, and <i>le bon Dieu</i>
himself alone knows why they live there, and why they live at
all.</p>
<p>"Here the presence of sordid hovels, faced with Danube mud and
raised but a few feet above the mud they deface, awful
Desolation, tragic and grand, is ruined and robbed of Nature's
one redeeming gift of great spacious emptiness.</p>
<p>"Quite oratorical that: almost poetic, <i>n'est ce
pas?</i></p>
<p>"But such considerations troubled not the soul of Skirios the
Greek, whose ship lay in the Baderland Dock.</p>
<p>"On the contrary, he appeared to find this terrible road
through this dreadful place peculiarly suited to his taste and
particularly suited to his purpose--for he had just performed the
expensive and difficult feat of almost quenching the thirst of
his mess-mate, Mikhail Dulaspoff.</p>
<p>"In doing so they had almost depleted the stock of a Galatz
wine-shop, and now, along this <i>Via Dolorosa,</i> Skirios aided
Mikhail Dulaspoff's wandering and erratic way, out of the
town.</p>
<p>"Across trackless leagues of frozen Russian swamp the North
wind blew with a keenness that seared the skin, and the falling,
swirling snow steadily added to the high-piled drifts.</p>
<p>"Under such conditions, had he not been cheerfully drunk,
Mikhail Dulaspoff would have insisted that the long dark journey
to the docks should be made by sleigh.</p>
<p>"Even for a ship's fireman, and a Russian at that, he had been
unusually reckless. To mix drinks is bad, even when there are
only seven kinds to mix. But to drink them mixed, and with
permutations and combinations, is worse. You can make quite a
number of combinations with seven, you know.</p>
<p>"Anyhow, his mixing efforts and labours had made him thirsty,
and as he staggered along, partly supported and entirely guided
by Skirios, he demanded a drink from the bottle borne, with
intent, by his hospitable shipmate.</p>
<p>"Having emptied the bottle, and playfully endeavoured to smite
his admiring friend with it, he announced his intention of
retiring, for the night, upon the nice white bed--a couch of
snow--ready prepared for him by the wayside . . . there, by that
stone post . . . bed-post, ha, ha! . . .</p>
<p>"Some friends would, in the circumstances, have discouraged
this idea, for, in the snow, to sleep may be to dream, but it is
not to wake.</p>
<p>"Skirios did not discourage the idea.</p>
<p>"On the contrary, he applauded it.</p>
<p>"And, further, he assisted Mikhail Dulaspoff to carry it into
execution</p>
<p>"Execution! Ha, a good word, that. . . .</p>
<p>"Mikhail Dulaspoff laid himself down, composed himself to
slumber--and instantly fell asleep. . . .</p>
<p>"Skirios contemplated his enemy, and the smile that bared his
teeth was a smile of the mouth only.</p>
<p>"'<i>So!</i>' he said. '<i>So!</i>' and stooped.</p>
<p>"An interesting phenomenon of natural history, of which you
may or may not be aware, is the fact that the distinguishing
feature of the fireman ashore is an appropriately black square
muffler, which at once obviates the need for a collar and for the
meticulous washing of the neck.</p>
<p>"This muffler is always folded at the back and the ends are
crossed in front and attached to the braces.</p>
<p>"Thus worn, the muffler is useful, comfortable, ornamental,
and fashionable.</p>
<p>"What more would you have?</p>
<p>"Nothing more--but possibly something less, for, thus worn, it
is, in point of fact, admirably adapted for conversion, by an
ill-disposed person, into a most effective tourniquet.</p>
<p>"And so Skirios stooped . . .</p>
<p>"Stooped, thrust his hand into the knotted muffler; twisted
hard; and held on.</p>
<p>"'<i>So!</i>' he said, after a minute or two, '<i>So!</i>' and
rose again.</p>
<p>"The judge had not only worn the Black Cap and passed
sentence, but had himself carried the sentence into
execution.</p>
<p>"Skirios next removed everything from the pockets of his late
colleague, and substituted some Greek-stamped Piraeus letters
addressed to himself, Leonidas P. Skirios, as well as one or two
Greek copper coins.</p>
<p>"Now Skirios, while acting as Mess-room Steward and neglecting
no opportunity for investigation of all things interesting and
possibly profitable, had discovered the chart-room locker in
which the 'Discharge Books' of the crew were kept--and it was not
solicitude nor anxiety for the welfare of Mikhail Dulaspoff that
had induced him to remove that fireman's 'Continuous Certificate
of Discharge' and hide it in a safe place against such time as it
might be useful.</p>
<p>"Among other information this comprehensive certificate gave
the height, colour of eyes, colour of hair, complexion,
tattoo-marks, and other distinguishing marks; and it bore the
'signature' of the holder.</p>
<p>"With the exception of '<i>Clasped Hands tattooed on right
forearm</i>' the general description of the characteristics of
Mikhail Dulaspoff applied equally well to Skirios; and, as it
happened, Mikhail Dulaspoff, for excellent reasons, had professed
to be unable to sign his name.</p>
<p>"Curiously enough at about this time 'Clasped Hands' appeared
tattooed on the right forearm of Skirios the Greek.</p>
<p>"Thus, henceforth, Skirios the Greek, a mere coal-trimmer,
could assume the identity of Mikhail Dulaspoff and earn the, to
him, fabulous wage of a fireman; and from this so clever enemy
himself, Skirios the Greek had learnt not only something of the
Russian language, but much of the art of stoking a furnace . . .
<i>He! he!</i> how amusing.</p>
<p>"Well, as to this foul vermin, Mikhail Dulaspoff, his body was
found a few days later by a relieving detachment of the miserable
conscripted soldiers, who, in Roumania, are posted wherever a
ship is moored, in order to make the administration of palm-oil
to the Custom's officers a little more difficult and
costly--difficult and costly to the importer, that is to say. For
all imports into Roumania are liable to duty. Only <i>liable,</i>
you understand. . . .</p>
<p>"Upon inquest, it was cleverly assumed that deceased was a
seaman who had fallen asleep and died in the snow.</p>
<p>"The assumption was correct. He was a seaman. He had fallen
asleep. And undoubtedly he had died in the snow.</p>
<p>"His papers were examined and, in due course, Captain
Logodedes, now at the port of Kustenje, was informed that a Greek
deserter from his ship had been found dead.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"But, far from dead, Skirios the murderer lay low in Galatz,
found a home in Katinka's capacious heart and wine-shop; and,
boastful in his cups, told her the story of his life, and of
Mikhail Dulaspoff's death.</p>
<p>"And, after a while, seeing his chance of large profits and
quick returns, he robbed her and left her.</p>
<p>"That was a silly thing to do because . . ."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"<i>Stand! . . . Left turn! . . .</i> <i>Quick march!</i> . .
."</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>"I'll tell you about Pierre Bordeau and how he came to
encounter Skirios the Greek.</p>
<p>"Of course you know all about the great '<i>affaire</i>
Dreyfus,' <i>mon ami?</i> Did you know that there was very nearly
a great '<i>affaire</i> Dreyfus' in Russia? It would have been
the <i>affaire</i>--er--Krassilov, had I not escaped--and become
Pierre Bordeau. A very nasty, dirty business, as nasty and dirty
as the <i>affaire</i> Dreyfus was.</p>
<p>"I was Engineer-Captain in the Imperial Russian Navy, and the
carrion cur Mikhail Dulaspoff, beside being a parasite of the
Secret Service, a police-spy, a stool-pigeon, informer and
<i>agent provocateur,</i> was a naval artificer. Behind the
respectable facade of his uniform, he worked his side-line of
spying and informing, on a system of payment by results; the more
results the more payment, and the bigger the better.</p>
<p>"For the low and evil knave that he was, he must have had a
certain amount of brain and quite a stock of low cunning, for he
conceived the brilliant idea of selling some plans and drawings
to a deeply interested Foreign Power and, moreover, of earning a
noble lump of informer's reward by discovering who had done this
foul deed, and denouncing him to the police!</p>
<p>"He did it well, too, as I had good cause to know. For it was
I whom he selected for the honour of being his victim. I whom he
had never seen, any more than I had seen him. . . .</p>
<p>"He did it so well that not only was I arrested, but my wife,
who was supposed to have been my accomplice, was thrown into
prison, too.</p>
<p>"She went into that prison a healthy young woman who had never
had a day's illness in her life. She died there in a few weeks. .
. .</p>
<p>"I, thanks to a certain mechanical ability with tools and
locks and things, escaped, and so there was no big public
<i>affaire</i>--er--Krassilov.</p>
<p>"That vile secret-selling traitor Krassilov disappeared and
Pierre Bordeau took his place.</p>
<p>"Later, the informer Mikhail Dulaspoff disappeared too, with
the police on his track.</p>
<p>"Ha! ha! Let us talk of Pierre Bordeau."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was Krassilov who talked of Pierre Bordeau, and I was only
too glad to listen as he told the absorbing tale.</p>
<p>This is how the amusing Krassilov talked of himself as Pierre
Bordeau:--</p>
<p>"Clad in greasy cap, dirty ragged singlet, oil-soaked dungaree
trousers, and with dilapidated shoes on his sockless feet, Pierre
Bordeau appeared to spend all his waking hours in plunging a bare
muscular arm into the viciously throbbing intricacies of the
engines. Even to the habit of chewing the end of an open-mesh
sweat-rag suspended from his neck, he seemed just typical of all
Mercantile Marine greasers--those useful ratings who, promoted
for industry and experience in the stoke-hole, lubricate vast
engines, and generally assist the more capable and skilled
Engineer-of-the-Watch.</p>
<p>"And what supported Pierre's claim to be typical was a
'Discharge' which certified that he had served as a fireman on
the steamer <i>Prætoris.</i> A beautiful specimen of the forger's
art.</p>
<p>"In point of fact he'd never fed roaring furnaces or scraped
the interiors of boilers, but fortunately the English Port
Official who gave him his first 'Continuous Certificate of
Discharge' was not sufficiently curious to ascertain whether a
<i>Prætoris</i> had ever been on the British Register; and, as a
greaser, he'd passed from ship to ship, French, English and
American.</p>
<p>"Aboard ship, undue reticence does not make for popularity,
and it was some tribute to Pierre's personality, tact, and
ability, that he was quite well liked, and had no enemies in the
fo'c'sle.</p>
<p>"Finding that he met all queries, casual and other, with a
persistent if polite evasiveness, his fo'c'sle shipmates were
content to regard him as a dark horse, and leave it at that.</p>
<p>"No one ever suggested or dreamed that he was a Russian
aristocrat, once an officer and a gentleman.</p>
<p>"To his superiors, Pierre, even more than to his messmates,
was an object of wonder.</p>
<p>"A greaser who can read, write, and speak three languages, and
has a working knowledge of several others, is quite rare.</p>
<p>"If an irate Customs Officer demanded that, in accordance with
the certified store-list, five barrels of oil should be
forthcoming, it was Pierre who was commissioned to explain, in
the Customs Officer's native tongue, that engines must be oiled
and that the fifth barrel had been used on the passage from the
last port.</p>
<p>"When ragged and illiterate Mediterranean deck-passengers
stared stupidly at the harassed First Mate, and produced neither
ticket nor passport in reply to his objurgations, it was Pierre
who was sent for, to interpret, and to smooth difficulties.</p>
<p>"A Chief Engineer, while forcefully admonishing a bumptious
and careless junior, was heard to inform the young man that</p>
<p>"'That Frenchie, Bordeau, knows as much about engines as I do,
and that's a sight more than you'll ever learn. And he's a
gentleman, too, and that's a sight more than you'll ever be.'</p>
<p>"And in course of time and the mysterious workings of
Providence, this 'gentleman' greaser found himself on board a
ship bound for Constantinople, Burgas, Varna, Constanta, the
River Danube and Galatz.</p>
<p>"And, at Galatz, he found himself, one night, in the wine-shop
of Katinka.</p>
<p>"Oh, that Katinka . . . But this is the story of Pierre
Bordeau.</p>
<p>"Well, Pierre Bordeau fell madly in love with Katinka, so it's
the story of Katinka too, isn't it--at the moment?</p>
<p>"And one night, as he leant against the zinc-topped bar,
trying to drown his sorrows in wine, and himself in the deep
wells of Katinka's eyes, the door was thrown open and a man
strode in . . .</p>
<p>"No, not strode in . . . came sheepishly inside and said, as
though he and she were alone in the room--alone in all the
world,</p>
<p>"'Take me back, Katinka.'</p>
<p>"Katinka raised her head and stared with hardening eyes.</p>
<p>"'<i>You!</i>' she said incredulously, and reached beneath the
bar.</p>
<p>"A moment later the man leapt for the door, as Katinka
levelled her pistol at him.</p>
<p>"I laughed.</p>
<p>"'Who's he?' I said as the door swung shut.</p>
<p>"'Mikhail Dulaspoff,' she said.</p>
<p>"'<i>What!</i>'</p>
<p>"'Mikhail Dulaspoff. D'you want him?'</p>
<p>"'I do.'</p>
<p>"'Get him, then,' snapped Katinka, as I sprang for the door
almost as quickly as the man had done.</p>
<p>"He was outside, at a safe distance.</p>
<p>"'Hullo! Thrown out already? Going back to your ship? I'll
come part of the way with you,' he said.</p>
<p>"So that was how he lived nowadays, was it? Robbing drunken
sailors as they reeled and staggered from Galatz to the Baderland
Dock.</p>
<p>"'Yesh,' I hiccupped. 'Goin' back ship. Le's get boll' wine.
Good f'ler. Both good f'lers. Get two boll's. Drink all the
way.'</p>
<p>"And, a quarter of an hour later, I and this dog--this dog and
I--were outside the town and reeling along the road to the
Docks.</p>
<p>"'About half-way,' I thought would be the best place, equally
distant from the town and the Docks, safest from interruption,
and from discovery later.</p>
<p>"By-and-by we reached a spot where stood a stone pillar or
post. This place would do as well as another; very lonely and
deserted, and far from the habitations of men.</p>
<p>"'Funny thing happened here once, old drunk,' said the animal
whose arm I tightly held.</p>
<p>"'And another one's going to happen now,' I replied. . . .
'You are Mikhail Dulaspoff.'</p>
<p>"'That's right,' was the reply.</p>
<p>"The man was startled.</p>
<p>"'Good old Mikhail,' he went on. 'Good old Dulaspoff. Fireman.
"Tattoo signs or other marks; hands clasped on the right
forearm." How did you know me?'</p>
<p>"'Mikhail Dulaspoff,' I said softly.</p>
<p>"'That's me. Good old Mikhail. Good old Dulaspoff.'</p>
<p>"'<i>Ah!</i> And I, my good Mikhail Dulaspoff, am
Engineer-Captain Krassilov,' I said, and took him by the
throat.</p>
<p>"He hadn't a chance, for my hands are of steel.</p>
<p>"As his face darkened and his eyes protruded, I talked to him.
I talked to him of my wife who, through him, had died in prison.
I talked to him of my ruined career, my wrecked and blasted life,
my shamed family, our blackened name, and--by-and-by--I dragged
his corpse to the stone, gave it a last kick, and returned to
Katinka.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"How that Katinka laughed when I told her all about it--all my
story!</p>
<p>"And how I laughed--on a different note--when I learned that
I'd killed the poor Skirios who had himself, on that very spot,
killed the real Mikhail Dulaspoff!</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>"'Oh, poor Skirios!' chuckled Katinka. 'That taught him not to
delude and swindle and rob and desert me!'</p>
<p>"Yes, if he hadn't done that, and hadn't murdered Mikhail
Dulaspoff, he'd never have died on the very same spot, and in the
very same way, that Mikhail Dulaspoff died. . . . I do call it
amusing! . . . Really funny, that <i>two</i> Mikhail Dulaspoffs
should have been murdered on the very same spot! . . . That
stone'll get a bad name--they ought to call it The Death Post." .

<h1><a name="c405" id="c405"><i>E Tenebris</i></a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">I</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is a good wind that blows nobody any ill.</p>
<p>A sudden gust of violent rage, mad, irrepressible, swift rage
that turned a smoulderingly angry man into a raving lunatic,
proved a gust that brought ill to all of us in G-- prison,
beginning with Guard Ghisonaccia, one of our Corsican
warders.</p>
<p>It was the neatest killing I have ever seen, murder or
otherwise, in peace or in war; so amazingly quick, clean, and
efficient that it was more like a feat of conjuring than anything
else. Yes, much more like a juggler's trick than a murderer's
vengeance. An unarmed murderer, too.</p>
<p>Not that he called himself a murderer, of course, or was
called a murderer by any of his comrades.</p>
<p>He and they called it an act of just retribution . . . a
commendable deed of righteous vengeance . . . a proper
punishment.</p>
<p>Anyhow, there it was.</p>
<p>It is also an ill wind that blows nobody any good. This one
brought me one of Krassilov's stories; and the chance to hear it
in peace, if not in comfort.</p>
<p>I've told you about the great gravelled square in the G--
prison, with the broad stone ledge running all round the walls, a
couple of feet from the ground; the ledge on which we used to
sit, each in his numbered place, and the lucky ones in the
sunshine.</p>
<p>We'd had our exercise, round and round the square; and were
sitting silent, like graven images, each in his appointed spot on
the stone ledge, and leaning against the wall.</p>
<p>Krassilov was on my right hand, and on my left an empty space
vacated by Chavart, who, after growling a threat at a guard, had
disappeared into the <i>cachot</i> underground cell--never to
return.</p>
<p>Krassilov appeared to be brooding heavily. Perhaps on the fate
of Chavart, a dauntless fellow of whom he approved.</p>
<p>As a rule, Krassilov would talk through absolutely motionless
lips, as we sat thus, and as opportunity offered. But that day he
would not say a word, even when Guard Ghisonaccia was several
feet away. Nor would he reply to my questions and remarks in
finger language, tapped by my finger-knuckles against his
thigh.</p>
<p>I was just asking him if he were ill when at a sudden</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"<i>Garde à vous. Levez-vous. Droit</i> . . ."</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-indent: 0em;">we sprang to our feet, turned to our
right into line, and marched off to the monotonous staccato,</p>
<p>"<i>Droit! Gauche! 'Oit! gau'!' . . . 'Oit! gau'!' . . . 'Oit!
gau'!'</i> . . ."</p>
<p>The long line filed round the vast square, parallel to the
lofty walls, the guards on the right of the line, about one to
every dozen prisoners.</p>
<p>As it happened, Krassilov and I were so near the end of the
line that there was no guard behind us. The guard Ghisonaccia, in
charge of the last dozen or so, was marching just in front of,
and to the right of, Krassilov and myself, and from time to time
barking out his</p>
<p>"'<i>Oit! gau'!'</i> . . . '<i>Oit! gau'!'</i> . . . '<i>Oit!
gau'!'</i> . . ."</p>
<p>And suddenly it happened, the amazing feat of juggling.</p>
<p><i>Someone</i> noiselessly, and yet with a rapidity that would
make a flash of lightning seem lethargic, whipped Ghisonaccia's
bayonet from its sheath and drove it sideways, from back to front
through its owner's heart.</p>
<p>Really I think that at the beginning of a second the bayonet
was in its sheath, and at the end of that same second the bayonet
was in Ghisonaccia--not only in him, but through him. As quick as
that.</p>
<p>A hand had shot out from the side of a man in that line of
uniformly clad prisoners, and had returned to the man's side--and
Ghisonaccia was dead.</p>
<p>It was as sudden and soundless as though a bullet had been
fired from a perfectly silent gun.</p>
<p>I couldn't be certain at first, nor for several seconds, that
I wasn't dreaming . . . seeing things . . . the victim of
hallucination. One gets queer in prison, you know, and fancies
things.</p>
<p>In two steps I was past Ghisonaccia, and, out of the corner of
my eye--for even then I did not turn my head, as I had suffered
many things for such a crime as turning my head--I saw that
Ghisonaccia had lurched sideways . . . had gone a queer colour .
. . was wearing his bayonet in the wrong place and manner, the
handle protruding beneath his left shoulder-blade, the point
sticking out through his breast-pocket . . .</p>
<p>And yet his very voice, or the voice of his ghost--already
haunting us--went on with his monotonous,</p>
<p>"'<i>Oit! gau'!'</i> . . . '<i>Oit! gau'!'</i> . . . '<i>Oit!
gau'!'</i> . . ."</p>
<p>But that was nonsense.</p>
<p>And yet there it was.</p>
<p>"'<i>Oit! gau'!'</i> . . . '<i>Oit! gau'!'</i> . . . '<i>Oit!
gau'!'</i> . . ."</p>
<p>Of course, the juggler-conjurer was also a ventriloquist: the
quickness of his hand had deceived the eye and the cleverness of
his voice was now deceiving the ear.</p>
<p>In the very tone and accent of the dying or dead Corsican
guard--and probably with absolutely motionless lips he continued
his victim's monotonous mechanical,</p>
<p>"'<i>Oit! gau'!'</i> . . . '<i>Oit! gau'!'</i> . . . '<i>Oit!
gau'!'</i> . . ."</p>
<p>And as I listened, as though in a dream and yet with every
sense taut, alert, and hypersensitive, I heard Ghisonaccia
fall.</p>
<p>No cry, no groan, not even a gasp--but just the sound of a man
falling down, a sound almost drowned in the noise of shuffling
rope-soled <i>espadrilles,</i> and the loud insistent</p>
<p>"'<i>Oit! gau'!'</i> . . . '<i>Oit! gau'!'</i> . . . '<i>Oit!
gau'!'</i> . . ."</p>
<p>The nearest guard, twenty yards in front, had heard nothing,
though doubtless he subconsciously heard what he supposed to be
his colleague's,</p>
<p>"'<i>Oit! gau'!'</i> . . . '<i>Oit! gau'!'</i> . . . '<i>Oit!
gau'!'</i> . . ."</p>
<p>Not a prisoner turned his head.</p>
<p>None of those in front of me, that is to say.</p>
<p>And I doubt whether any of those behind me did so, though
those at the very end of the line--where Ghisonaccia should have
been--must have seen him stagger sideways and fall, even if they
did not see that incredibly dexterous hand dart out from the line
and back into its grey obscurity, its complete anonymity.</p>
<p>On shuffled that long flexible serpent of woe, that worm of
misery--the worm that had turned--leaving its victim bleeding in
the dust of its trail.</p>
<p>To the right wheeled its head, and on along that side of the
huge parade-ground it continued its way. . . .</p>
<p>Every prisoner stared at the back of the head of the man in
front of him; every guard, his thoughts on his dinner, his girl,
his <i>pinard,</i> or the charge he was going to frame against
one of the wretched prisoners, gazed at the ground, and, from
time to time, at the men marching on his left hand.</p>
<p>To the right again wheeled the head of the worm of misery, and
still no guard saw that which he did not expect to see; and no
prisoner affected to see that which perhaps already he had seen.
. . .</p>
<p>Suddenly, one of the guards caught sight of the huddled figure
lying prone, silent, and still on the other side of the
square.</p>
<p>For a second or so, he must have wondered whether he were
dreaming, and whether the ugly vision of the corpse of a
colleague--that obtruded itself upon his thoughts of his dinner,
his girl, his <i>pinard,</i> or his case against a prisoner--was
not a vision indeed.</p>
<p>But no, there in the dust lay a man in the blue uniform of a
prison guard, his outflung hand, palm uppermost, stretched forth
in mute appeal to the unanswering heavens, a glittering spike of
steel protruding from his left breast, his <i>képi</i> on the
ground beside his head. . . .</p>
<p>Suddenly the guard ran to the head of the line, seized the arm
of 'Brigadier' Morsiglia, an old Corporal of Spahis, and
pointed.</p>
<p>Brigadier Morsiglia acted promptly.</p>
<p>"<i>Halte! Droit! Fixe!</i>"</p>
<p>The guards then took station behind their respective squads of
prisoners, and mentioned what would happen to any man who turned
and looked behind him.</p>
<p>There may perhaps have been one or two prisoners so sunk in
apathetic lethargy that they had not already seen the body of
their enemy lying where he fell--but I doubt it.</p>
<p>When one does for a brief space get out into clean air; get
out from beneath a low ceiling; get out from the pressure of four
enclosing walls; get out from gloom into sunshine; get out from a
living grave into the living day; one's soul as well as one's
body arises from that grave.</p>
<p>One must be very ill indeed, or very far gone adown the road
of prison madness, when one ceases to take notice, to take
interest, to take stock of everything animate and inanimate that
lies without one's cell.</p>
<p>The passage of a bird is something to remember; sounds that
penetrate from the world beyond the prison walls; the feel of
sun-warmed stones as one sits and pats and strokes them with
one's hands; the doings of the busy bustling ants beside one's
feet; the movements of the sunshine-beetle that one had captured
to take back to one's cell as a companion, and had repentantly
released; the changing sky, the changing light, the changing
green, from Spring-time to Spring-time, of the only tree (God
bless it!) that one had seen for years; these things are
happenings, events, importances. And the man who has ceased to
notice them will probably never notice anything again.</p>
<p>Thus, the number of those who had not seen Ghisonaccia's body
must have been few.</p>
<p>Imagine, then, the suppressed excitement, the incipient
hysteria, the almost unbearable strain among those abnormal
men--men, <i>c'est à dire,</i> rendered abnormal by the dreadful
life they led.</p>
<p>A guard had been killed.</p>
<p>It must have been the guard at the end of the line.</p>
<p>That would be Ghisonaccia, the worst and most bitterly hated
of them all. Hated for his vile perjured injustice, his currying
of favour by the constant reporting of absolutely imaginary
crimes.</p>
<p>Most prisoners hate most guards. But it is by no means true
that all prisoners hate all guards.</p>
<p>I, personally, am not much given to hating, and throughout my
life have hated very few people indeed. But I hated Ghisonaccia
bitterly and actively, not because he did his duty, but because
he made the tears and groans, despair, suffering, blood and very
lives of helpless broken men the miserable stepping-stones to his
paltry success.</p>
<p>He had caused the deaths of men far less criminal than he; the
undeserved punishment of men entirely devoid of criminal
attributes; of men who had never deliberately done an evil deed
in all their lives.</p>
<p>Personally I disapprove of murder (though I hold that there
are many far worse sins), but I was glad that Ghisonaccia had
been murdered, and my one regret was that he should have died so
quickly and without knowing whose hand had sent him to his
deserved place in Hell.</p>
<p>One is apt to feel like that when, helpless and innocent, one
is tried, condemned (unheard), and cruelly punished for offences
that one has neither committed nor dreamed of committing.</p>
<p>And as I felt, so felt every man in that long line of
prisoners, many with far more reason, and far more violently.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>One has heard of a police institution known in America as the
Third Degree. I myself have had no experience of this form of
examination, but the torture through which every man, who had
been present on that parade, was put, in the course of the next
few days might, without exaggeration, be called the Thirty-Third
Degree.</p>
<p>If this estimate be just, the method adopted for extracting
the truth from the men who had been at the end of the line, the
men of Ghisonaccia's own squad, was surely that of the Hundred
and Third Degree.</p>
<p>It failed.</p>
<p>Whether that was because of the staunch loyalty, <i>esprit de
corps,</i> and prisoner-honour of the men examined, or whether it
was because everybody accused everybody else and a dozen swore
they'd seen a dozen different men commit the dreadful deed--so
that Ghisonaccia ought to have looked like a bristling
pin-cushion--I do not know.</p>
<p>But what I do know is that having said what was the simple
truth--as long as I could say anything at all--I was condemned to
solitary confinement in total darkness until I could say
something different.</p>
<p>It was only natural that I should fall under the heaviest
suspicion of either being the murderer or of knowing who the
murderer was, inasmuch as Ghisonaccia had been, according to all
the evidence, marching close to me.</p>
<p>So he had.</p>
<p>And somebody marching close in front of me had done it--and I
had seen him do it. But who it was, I did not know and did not
wish to know.</p>
<p>Presumably, the two or three men who had been in front of me,
and the two or three behind me, were suffering the same extreme
of inquisition and punishment. One thing, of course, was quite
certain--somebody would face the firing-party or turn his back to
the blade of Madame la Guillotine.</p>
<p>For preference, the authorities would discover the right one;
but if getting him meant getting a whole group, then the group
would face the firing-party or the axe, or go with him to the
'Dry Guillotine'.</p>
<p>Meantime I was enduring solitary confinement in total
darkness.</p>
<p>A prolonged spell of this punishment usually drives a man
insane, frequently completely and permanently mad.</p>
<p>And I imagine that those whose reason is most likely to
survive the ordeal are those blessed with the most mental
resources. I mean men who, for example, have well-stored memories
and can use them both in assisting the flight of time and in
keeping at bay the spectres of suicidal <i>ennui,</i> horror and
fear--fear of darkness, of silence, of blindness, of being left
to starve, and that very fear of going mad that induces
madness.</p>
<p>There is something curiously unsettling to the mind in having
no record whatsoever of the flight of time; in not knowing
whether one has been in darkness for hours, or days, or weeks; in
not knowing whether one has slept for minutes or for hours; in
not knowing whether it is night or day.</p>
<p>One stands, as it were, outside of Time, and that is a very
uncomfortable situation to occupy.</p>
<p>Happy, then, is the man (or let us say comparatively happy)
who has learnt by heart poems and songs and long extracts from
the Classics, from the works of Shakespeare and the other great
playwrights.</p>
<p>In this particular, I was singularly fortunate, but soon
found--if soon it were--that it was dangerous to recite aloud any
poem that had a strongly marked rhythm, the sort of poem that set
itself to music, or rather that one's mind subconsciously sets to
music.</p>
<p>It was with something of a shock that, one day--or one
night--I found that I was not only reciting a simple poem aloud,
but was marching round and round my cell in time to the 'music'
of the poem which I was not only reciting, but actually
singing.</p>
<p>This would not do.</p>
<p>And I promptly went back to Shakespeare, taking each play that
I knew, and each part in that play, acting the part with voice,
bearing, and gesture, as though I were (God forbid!) on the stage
of a London theatre--passing from Henry VIII to Katherine of
Aragon and from Katherine to Cardinal Wolsey, and striving to be
the individual I was impersonating.</p>
<p>But when my mind was tired, I would tire my body, performing
every physical exercise of which I'd ever heard, and inventing
many others of which I had not--all the time with a growing sense
of postponement, of putting off, of evading . . . the moment when
my mental labours would end in gibberish, and my physical efforts
in the dashing of my head against the wall.</p>
<p>How I used to envy those fortunate thrice-happy prisoners who
were merely condemned, even though for life, to confinement in an
ordinary lighted cell, be it lighted never so dimly.</p>
<p>It was not so much that one wanted to see as that one wanted
to know that one <i>could</i> see.</p>
<p>One of the worst things about this confinement in the dark, is
the belief which is bound to grip one sooner or later, that one
does not see because one cannot see. One ceases to believe that
one is in darkness, and soon believes that the darkness is in
oneself.</p>
<p>By a piece of ingenuity somewhat devilish, food is introduced
into these particular punishment cells in G-- prison, without the
accompaniment of either light or sound. Also, so far as one could
tell, the meals (a <i>boule</i> of black bread and a
<i>gamelle</i> of water) were put through the door hatch at
irregular intervals.</p>
<p>Anyhow, by the time the amazing diversion occurred, I was
quite ready for it, as no doubt the authorities intended.</p>
<p>How long I had been in this dreadful darkness, and possibly
more dreadful silence, I do not know--though it was certainly not
less than six weeks--when suddenly, at what hour of the day or
night I cannot say, the door was flung open and my eyes were
blinded by the terrible brilliance of the light that shone from a
dirty smoky slush lamp, in which burnt the stump of a candle. It
was the first light that my eyes had seen for more than forty
days and forty nights, and it hurt them terribly, unbearably.</p>
<p>But as I clapped my hands to my face, I caught sight not only
of my goaler, but of two other guards and a prisoner. From the
slight sounds that tore the heavy pall of silence, I gathered
that the prisoner was thrust into the room, and the door quietly
closed and locked behind him.</p>
<p>"Who are you?" said a voice, a little later.</p>
<p>I told him, and asked his name, for I was afraid to believe
that I had recognized the voice.</p>
<p>"Krassilov," came the answer, and in my weakness, misery, and
despair, almost I could have wept for joy.</p>
<p>"<i>Krassilov!</i>" I said . . ." But why?"</p>
<p>Could it be that there were, after all, gleams of mercy, pity,
decency, in the hearts of our goalers? But of course there were
not, and Krassilov's quiet cynical laugh confirmed my second
thoughts.</p>
<p>"'<i>Why</i>,' my dear chap?" he whispered, and groping for my
hand, drew me close to him and put his lips to my ear.</p>
<p>All but inaudibly, barely framing the words, he whispered
almost soundlessly,</p>
<p>"Why? . . . So . . . that . . . we . . . shall . . . talk . .
. and . . . give . . . ourselves . . . or . . . someone . . .
else . . . away. Don't . . . say . . . a . . . word . . . that .
. . they . . . are . . . not . . . welcome . . . to . . . hear.
Only . . . say . . . things . . . you . . . want . . . them . . .
to . . . know."</p>
<p>Then slowly, laboriously and patiently, for we had all the
time there was, Krassilov tapped a message with his finger-tips
on my forehead. At the end of each sentence I touched his hand,
once if I had understood, and twice if I had not.</p>
<p>By the time he had finished, I knew that he had already had a
man--almost certainly a spy, an informer, a stool-pigeon--in his
cell for a period of time that he estimated at two or three days.
This man had artfully questioned him as to what he knew about the
murder, and Krassilov had artfully replied as to what he did not
know about it.</p>
<p>Krassilov, simply for the sake of human company--even that of
an informer--played his fish as long as he possibly could: talked
'about it and about', as long as there was a word that could be
said, and left him as wise at the end as he had been at the
beginning.</p>
<p>Knowing Krassilov, I should imagine no one ever said more and
told less on a given subject in a given time than he did to the
police spy.</p>
<p>When every conceivable word (that shed no light upon the
subject) had been said, Krassilov's companion had been
withdrawn.</p>
<p>And that scheme having failed, the new plan, according to
Krassilov, was to put the likeliest criminals together in pairs,
and listen to their unguarded speech when they thought themselves
alone.</p>
<p>How were the spies to hear?</p>
<p>He did not know. Heaven alone knew.</p>
<p>Quite likely there was some concealed aperture at which a
warder could listen. There might be some kind of instrument.
Quite probably a third man would come into the cell and listen to
our talk--another informer, possibly a fellow-prisoner who had
been tortured into consenting to do this.</p>
<p>Anyhow, we were together, and must do whatever lay in our
power to remain together. Certainly we must talk, and keep our
listener employed; dole him out crumbs of information--false
information, of course; lead him on and keep him hoping to hear
more, hoping and expecting to learn the truth and solve the
mystery.</p>
<p>Now that I had company, the society of an intelligent and
educated man whom I thoroughly liked and respected, I felt
altogether different--comparatively happy, in fact.</p>
<p>A queer thing, this human happiness . . . that a man could lie
starving, ill, and filthy in a darkness blacker than the hobs of
hell, and feel happy merely because he had a fellow-sufferer with
whom to commune; because he had discovered he was not blind; and
because the inevitable hour of insanity had been postponed. . .
.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>"<i>Sst!</i>" Close to my ear, Krassilov's lips made the
faintest sound of warning.</p>
<p>On the back of my hand his fingers tapped, in our long-short
dash-dot Morse, the words,</p>
<p>"Hatch . . . door . . ."</p>
<p>His hearing was evidently better than mine, for I had heard
nothing.</p>
<p>Krassilov apparently had heard the sound, normally inaudible,
of the slight brief movement of a tiny trapdoor opening on
well-oiled hinges.</p>
<p>With difficulty I repressed an almost overwhelmingly powerful
impulse to grope my way through the pitch darkness to the door,
feel for the aperture, and drive a smashing blow with all my
strength at the side-turned face that filled it.</p>
<p>Krassilov's hand gripped mine, as though in restraint, and
gave it a meaning pressure as he spoke.</p>
<p>"<i>Mais non, mon ami, vous n'avez pas raison,</i>" he said in
French, as though contradicting some remark of mine.</p>
<p>"I tell you it is so. I saw him do it with my own eyes. I
quite admit that it is more than supernormal . . . that it is, as
you say, even supernatural. But what I have seen, I have seen,
and what I know, I know. I saw him as plainly as I saw the man
marching in front of me. He came walking across the
exercise-ground, straight to Ghisonaccia, whipped out
Ghisonaccia's own bayonet, drove it through him, and quietly
walked away again. . . .</p>
<p>"I marvel you didn't see him yourself," continued Krassilov,
giving my hand a squeeze.</p>
<p>"Perhaps I did," I replied, taking his cue. "Perhaps I
did."</p>
<p>"And don't want to give him away, eh?"</p>
<p>"No need to name names is there?" I growled.</p>
<p>"Why not? There's nobody in here but us, is there you fool?
You don't think I'm an <i>escroc,</i> do you?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," I grumbled. "You might be. Anyhow, what I say
is there's no sense in naming names."</p>
<p>There certainly wouldn't be in this case, so far as I was
concerned, for I hadn't the vaguest idea as to what name to
mention, nor indeed as to what he was driving at.</p>
<p>"Oh, <i>quelle sottise!</i> Rot! Bosh! Look here. D'you mean
to tell me you didn't see Chavart kill Ghisonaccia?" and
Krassilov tapped my hand in request for an affirmative reply.</p>
<p>"Well . . . it's you that have said the name, Krassilov. I
wouldn't have uttered it myself, not even to you. I say . .
."</p>
<p>"Did you, or did you not, see Chavart do it?" interrupted
Krassilov.</p>
<p>"Of course I did," I replied.</p>
<p>Was there, or was there not, a sound from the direction of the
door?</p>
<p>Although, as I have said, my hearing was not as sharp as that
of Krassilov, it was, after those endless weeks of appalling
silence, nevertheless preternaturally acute, and I thought I
heard the shadow of a sound. Possibly of breathing, possibly of a
mere movement of a head.</p>
<p>"Well, why couldn't you say so before?" said Krassilov.</p>
<p>"Once again, because there's no sense in naming names," I
replied doggedly, "and because, for all I know, you may have
turned police spy and informer."</p>
<p>"Look here, do you want me to wring your dirty neck?" snarled
Krassilov, as he gently patted my hand.</p>
<p>"You're welcome to try," I replied.</p>
<p>"'Police informer'! . . . 'Spy,'" he growled.</p>
<p>"Anyhow, you're suddenly shoved in here with me and begin
asking me whether I didn't see Chavart."</p>
<p>"And you did see him."</p>
<p>"Yes," I said.</p>
<p>"Thank God for that. And we won't quarrel over insults, <i>mon
ami.</i> You know I'm not a police-spy. They've put me in here
because there aren't enough cells . . . so they're doubling up. .
. . Two in every cell. . . . Splendid."</p>
<p>"Yes, company's company," I agreed sententiously. "Even
yours," I added unpleasantly.</p>
<p>Krassilov's taps told me that I was on the right line.</p>
<p>I yawned loudly.</p>
<p>"Why did you thank God that I'd seen Chavart too?" I said.</p>
<p>"Because Chavart is dead," replied Krassilov in a solemn and
portentous voice.</p>
<p>"What! They've killed him for killing Ghisonaccia?" I
asked.</p>
<p>"No, you fool. Ghisonaccia killed him."</p>
<p>"What <i>are</i> you talking about, my good idiot?"</p>
<p>"Chavart and Ghisonaccia. Ghisonaccia killed Chavart in his
cell. While two other guards held Chavart, Ghisonaccia killed
him. They reported Chavart as having died, and he was buried in
the prison grave-yard. A week later Chavart killed Ghisonaccia
with his own bayonet, before our eyes."</p>
<p>"This poor Krassilov has gone mad," I said aloud. "Talk
sense," I added. "How could the Chavart--whom I and you saw kill
Ghisonaccia--be dead?"</p>
<p>"Ah," observed Krassilov weightily. "Tell me that! . . .</p>
<p>"They put another man in my cell, a little while ago," he
continued, "and he whispered the same question in my ear. Did I
see Chavart do it, and if so, how was it possible?"</p>
<p>"That makes three of us," I said.</p>
<p>"More," replied Krassilov. "While we stood on parade, the man
on my left whispered,</p>
<p>"'Chavart did it.'</p>
<p>"That makes four."</p>
<p>"Five," I lied. "The man marching behind me said,</p>
<p>"'<i>Mon Dieu,</i> Chavart!' as Ghisonaccia fell."</p>
<p>"Of course, everybody behind Ghisonaccia saw Chavart; and none
of the guards, nor any of the prisoners in front, had a chance to
see him."</p>
<p>"Then obviously he can't be dead," I said.</p>
<p>"But he <i>is</i> dead, you fool. Dead, dead, dead! He's dead
and buried. I talked with two of the men who put him in his
grave."</p>
<p>"You mean it was his ghost that . . ."</p>
<p>"Call it what you like," answered Krassilov. "Ghost, spirit,
astral form. . . . Anyhow, it was Chavart all right, as a dozen
of us could testify. And I'll tell you another thing. He's going
to do the same for the warders who held him, and he's going to
haunt every man in this place who . . ."</p>
<p>Suddenly, abruptly, Krassilov stopped, and I strained my ears
to try and catch the sound for which he was listening. . . .</p>
<p>Yes, I was sure of it, this time. . . .</p>
<p>Someone was breathing, or someone's heart was beating, or
someone's neck had moved against the collar of his tunic--someone
who was either in our cell or at the opened hatch.</p>
<p>". . . maltreated him," continued Krassilov, "brought false
charges against him, beat him up, starved him, used his poor body
as a ladder-rung to promotion. . . . Oh yes, he killed
Ghisonaccia and he's going to kill a few more, and he's going to
haunt the rest until they commit suicide, and put an end to their
wretched lives of horror, fear, terror, despair. Each one of them
whom Chavart himself does not kill, will walk with Chavart beside
him; will lie down with Chavart standing by his bed; will awaken
in the night from brief nightmare-haunted slumber to meet dead
Chavart's cold accusing eye; will rise up in the morning watched
by Chavart; will go forth to each dark day's dreadful work
accompanied by Chavart . . . until--<i>suicide!</i></p>
<p>"Oh yes, some of them are going to learn something about
murdering harmless, helpless, defenceless men in underground
cells."</p>
<p>We both strained our ears through the listening silence.</p>
<p>"Chavart was a wonderful man, you know," continued Krassilov.
"He had been stationed at Pondicherry in French India. . . . He
was a Yogi. He had amazing powers. . . .</p>
<p>"In life and in death," he added in a sepulchral voice.</p>
<p>"Oh, they made a mistake when they murdered Chavart. . . .
Murdered his body, that is to say. They could not murder
his--spirit."</p>
<p>"Why did Ghisonaccia kill him?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Because of something that Chavart said to Ghisonaccia,"
replied Krassilov.</p>
<p>"I wonder what that was," I mused.</p>
<p>"Didn't you know? Chavart <i>told</i> Ghisonaccia he would
kill him on the parade-ground."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because he killed Chavart's mouse."</p>
<p>"Killed his mouse?"</p>
<p>"Yes. That was one of the many wonderful things about Chavart
the Yogi. He had amazing power over animals. He could converse
with them. That is to say, he could convey his thoughts to their
minds, and himself understand the thoughts of their minds.</p>
<p>"This mouse of Chavart's was his <i>copain.</i> It used to sit
down to meals with him every day. Chavart and the mouse would
break bread together, and have a chat about things. When Chavart
couldn't sleep, the mouse would come out and keep him
company.</p>
<p>"Where did it live? In Chavart's cell in general and in his
breast-pocket in particular. He told me that the more he knew of
warders the more he respected the intelligence of mice.</p>
<p>"Whenever it heard a footstep outside, it would hide,
preferably in Chavart's breast-pocket if there were time to get
there.</p>
<p>"Of course this mouse took half the punishment out of prison.
It made life worth living--even prison-life. Wherever Chavart
went the mouse went too--always in his breast-pocket.</p>
<p>"Chavart came to love that mouse so much that he wouldn't have
left prison without it.</p>
<p>"Well, one day, Chavart was lying on his back with his knees
drawn up, and the mouse, sitting up on one of Chavart's knees,
was listening attentively and intelligently to what Chavart was
telling it, while it washed its face and stroked its whiskers and
tidied up generally after a good meal.</p>
<p>"Suddenly it pointed.</p>
<p>"I don't mean it extended a finger, so to speak, and pointed
like a human being. . . . You know how a trained sporting-dog
points? Well, the mouse turned to the door and pointed. Someone
was watching through the 'Eye'.</p>
<p>"A key turned in the lock, and the door opened. By the time
Ghisonaccia was in the cell, the mouse was in Chavart's pocket.
When Ghisonaccia went out of the cell, the mouse came out of the
pocket--probably with a sort of wink at the smiling Chavart.</p>
<p>"But the mouse had winked too soon.</p>
<p>"Chavart, who so rarely smiled, had smiled too soon.</p>
<p>"It was the last time that Chavart smiled; and that night was
the last night that Chavart slept with his mouse beside him.</p>
<p>"For next day, as Chavart left his cell, he met
Ghisonaccia.</p>
<p>"Ghisonaccia grinned, and, raising his hand, struck Chavart on
the chest . . . just above the heart. . . .</p>
<p>"Hard enough to hurt Chavart? Oh dear, no! A mere nothing. . .
. A playful blow . . . playful as Ghisonaccia's smile. Just
Ghisonaccia's fun.</p>
<p>"Fun to Ghisonaccia--but death to the mouse.</p>
<p>"Death to Chavart's mouse.</p>
<p>"Death to Chavart.</p>
<p>"Death to Ghisonaccia."</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>I would give a good deal to know what the prison authorities,
and, more particularly, the warders and guards, thought of
Krassilov's remarkable story, and how far despondency and alarm
were spread by the apparently unanimous evidence as to the
ghostly slayer of Ghisonaccia.</p>
<p>Anyhow, it was a good effort and was undoubtedly as widely
circulated and discussed as Krassilov intended.</p>
<p>Nor did the ingenious man leave it at that, but enlarged,
embellished, and improved the story until, at times, I found
myself believing it, and imagining that I had indeed seen the
<i>revenant</i> of poor Chavart.</p>
<p>This was the easier, in view of the fact that Ghisonaccia had
always been especially attentive and brutal to Chavart who was
his <i>bête noire.</i></p>
<p>It was only when I pulled myself together and deliberately
recalled the actual details of the incident, and again saw the
incredibly swift and dexterous movement of the arm in front of
me, that I realized Krassilov's cleverness and very remarkable
powers of suggestion.</p>
<p>Of course, conditions were all in his favour; the eerie
darkness, and one's queer mental state.</p>
<p>But even so, it was interesting and a little frightening, to
note how powerfully Krassilov's fiction strove with reality's
fact. To the unintelligent, uneducated guard, listening (also in
the complete blackness of pitch darkness), the fantastic story of
Chavart's ghost must have seemed mere simple obvious truth--told
as Krassilov told it, and with such a wealth of corroborative
evidence.</p>
<p>And when the subject was absolutely exhausted, and there
positively remained no further word to be said, we had perforce
to talk of other things.</p>
<p>For talk we must. There would be time enough to sleep when we
were again separated; and after weeks and weeks of the dreadful
reason-destroying silence, and unbearable isolation, we must hear
each other's voices while we might.</p>
<p>Only when we slept did we cease to talk, and we slept scarcely
at all. When conversation failed, we recited to each other
English, French, Greek and Latin classics--Shakespeare, Molière,
Homer, Virgil--and discussed the extracts and poems that we
repeated.</p>
<p>Occasionally Krassilov sang Russian folk-songs. He was no
Chaliapin, but never did human voice give me greater pleasure or
affect me more. When first we fell silent, or perhaps I woke from
the first brief sleep that had overcome me since Krassilov
entered my cell, I said,</p>
<p>"Tell me a story, Krassilov."</p>
<p>"What about?"</p>
<p>"Oh, the sea."</p>
<p>And promptly Krassilov murmured,</p>
<p>"'The sight of salt water unbounded . . . and the crash of the
comber, wind-hounded . . .' Ah, shall we ever again behold the
sea, my friend? Would that you and I were dying of thirst on a
raft in the middle of the Pacific instead of rotting in this
black hole! . . . A tale of the sea, you say . . ."</p>
<p>He fell silent for a few moments.</p>
<p>"When we were capping quotations and chopping Classics just
now, the chaste Diana turned up, and Actæon who was destroyed for
spying on her--torn to pieces by the hounds. What you call
'peeping Tom', eh? Well, as it happens, I can tell you a yarn of
the sea, and of Diana and Actæon as well. You won't believe it. .
. ."</p>
<p>"I will," I interrupted.</p>
<p>". . . but it is true, and <i>Diana</i> and <i>Actæon</i> were
real ships. . . . Queer coincidence, but Lord! what would life be
without them?</p>
<p>"It was after that Russian police informer, of whom I told
you, had laid my life in ruins: and I had gone to sea with a pen
in my hand and the hope in my heart of some day becoming a tiny
little cheap-imitation Conrad. . . . He was a Pole, as of course
you know, named Joseph Conrad Korzeniowski, who'd never heard a
word of English nor seen the sea until he was a man, and it
seemed to me that I, a Russian, might humbly follow--at an
immeasurable distance--in his golden footsteps.</p>
<p>"I thought, too, that I might become an English seaman. . . .
What a change and what a disguise, thought I, if I could turn
from Russian Naval Engineer Officer into British sailor, bosun,
Mate and Master. . . .</p>
<p>"But I was going to tell you about <i>Diana</i> and
<i>Actæon</i> not about the man called Krassilov.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>"How hot it can sometimes be in your cold England! Under a
brazen sky reminiscent of that of the Sahara, London, that day,
positively panted in what was to me an incredible heat--the kind
of heat that sends you to sleep. Nor were lullaby and sedative
wanting, for I seemed with one ear to be listening to the distant
drowsy hum of that Fenchurch Street, and, with the other, to the
quiet and steady flow of Captain Jones' lecture on
seamanship.</p>
<p>"The good Captain (square-rigged, Extra Master's Certificate)
was the founder, proprietor, instructor, and everything else of
Jones' Aldgate Academy.</p>
<p>"When I went there, I found ten sunburned youths, burly and
large-fisted, at his seamanship table.</p>
<p>"Two of them, not having finished their apprenticeship, were
to fill up space and to help advertise the Academy, paying only a
nominal sum for their tuition: one sought a First Mate's and one
an Only Mate's certificate; and the remaining six were 'up for
Second Mate'.</p>
<p>"Thus the larger fees of the aspirant for Master's and Extra
Master's certificate were lacking, and these fees were poor
Captain Jones' chief weapon for keeping the pack of wolves from
the door.</p>
<p>"You may imagine, then, that in spite of Captain Jones'
insular prejudice against Dagoes and Square-heads, the only types
of foreigner that he recognized, I was a welcome pupil at the
Aldgate Academy.</p>
<p>"And curiously enough, this good Captain Jones came to like
me, and it was through him that I came to know the <i>Diana,</i>
and . . .</p>
<p>"Moreover, it was on this day of which I am speaking, that I
first heard of a ship being moored with her anchors at the
hawse-pipe, and the <i>after-</i>ends of her cables at the bottom
of the sea--a most curious maritime accident. And that very
accident happened to the <i>Diana.</i></p>
<p>"That's interesting, isn't it?</p>
<p>"Well, old Jones was meandering on, most monotonously, and we
were endeavouring to repel drowsiness most unsuccessfully.</p>
<p>"Suddenly, the too even tenor of his way was interrupted by a
loud emphatic snore.</p>
<p>"Looking round, we discovered that a huge young man had
succumbed, rested his head upon his arm, and frankly--and
noisily--gone to sleep.</p>
<p>"The words froze upon the outraged lecturer's lips, while a
flush of anger burned upon his cheeks.</p>
<p>"What would <i>ce bon Capitaine</i> Jones do, I wondered?
Would he avenge the insult with a blow? He would, apparently, for
swiftly, yet silently, he strode to where, all unconscious of his
fate, the unhappy victim snored.</p>
<p>"Did the Captain raise his red right hand and administer the
swift blow of remonstrance and retribution?</p>
<p>"No. He raised his voice instead.</p>
<p>"Bringing his lips close to the ear of the sleeper, he
bellowed with the brazen voice of the Bull of Bashan,</p>
<p>"'All hands on deck.'</p>
<p>"How everybody roared with laughter as the sleeper awoke,
attempted to leap from his bunk, and, with one hand, grab
imaginary trousers, and with the other, nonexistent
sea-boots.</p>
<p>"When the laughter and applause had died down, Captain Jones
resumed,</p>
<p>"'As it is possible, Mr. Smith, that you did not hear my last
remark but one' (more laughter), 'I'll repeat it. I was just
saying, with reference to my hints on the Mooring of Ships, that
it does not often occur that a ship at sea, or elsewhere, is
moored by the wrong ends of her chain. Yet it has happened, for I
was once so "anchored".'"</p>
<p>Krassilov laughed.</p>
<p>"Well, so in point of fact was I, my friend," he said. "In the
<i>Diana.</i> And that was what reminded me of Captain Jones.</p>
<p>"Yes. Oh, that <i>Diana!</i> Both the ship of that name and
the girl, Diana Robinson.</p>
<p>"I wish you could have seen Diana Robinson.</p>
<p>"Well, well. . . . In spite of the fact that she belonged to
Rudolf, Rosenbaum, Ritzenheimer &amp; Rumpf's famous fleet of
starvation rattletraps, the <i>Diana</i> was a really
lovely-looking ship, a witch, a yacht, a dream. Among that rotten
firm's other straight-fronted, made-by-the-yard, iron boxes, she
stood out like a queen, an Ocean Queen.</p>
<p>"And because her fine lines reduced her carrying capacity,
that gang of coffin-ship owners had bought her for a song, and
when I took command, she was being maintained as cheaply and
cleanly as David's sow.</p>
<p>"Of course, they got me cheaply too, or I should never have
got the job. Still, I know a ship when I see one, and all the
wicked cutting-down of the Mate's store-list couldn't really
affect her essential beauty; couldn't disguise the raking masts
and funnel and her lovely long clipper bow.</p>
<p>"Incidentally that bow was the good Mate's <i>bête
noire.</i></p>
<p>"'Give me a ship with a straight stem,' he used to growl.
'Berthing this bitch has knocked years off my life. One day that
bow is going to lift a truck off the dock-side, capsize a
cargo-shed, or knock over a Customs House. Then we shall all be
for it.'</p>
<p>"Nevertheless, I noticed that whatever other part of the ship
went bare, the Mate could always find some paint with which to
refresh, adorn and beautify the figure-head--Diana the Chaste,
Goddess of the Hunt.</p>
<p>"'Diana the Chased!' he would growl. 'Don't wonder she was
chased. I'd chase 'er meself--with my wife chasin' me. She's some
chaser. . . .'</p>
<p>"Whoever carved that figure-head was a master-craftsman, an
artist to his finger-tips. Evidently he had intended that the
figure-head of the <i>Diana</i> should <i>be</i> Diana, and
nobody else, so that even before the ship was named, you would
not guess that she would be called the <i>Britannia, Venus,
Cleopatra,</i> or <i>Mrs. Grundy.</i></p>
<p>"His goddess looked like a goddess. '<i>Incedit dea
aperta</i>,' a goddess revealed, with her quiver at her side and
crescent on her beautiful well-poised head. His Diana looked out
proudly 'O'er the vassal waves that rolled below'.</p>
<p>"To her rounded bow, held in the left hand of one straight
arm, she fitted a long arrow with the hand of the other
gracefully-curved and shapely arm.</p>
<p>"When the short hunting-dress was painted a snowy white, the
arrow tipped with gold, and the crescent silvered till it
gleamed, Diana was the pride of the Mate's brave heart and the
delight of his roving eye.</p>
<p>"I want you to remember that clipper bow, star-stabbing
bowsprit, chaste Diana, and the golden arrowhead--especially that
sharp bright arrow-head. . . .</p>
<p>"Diana, Goddess of the Chase. . . . She brought no luck to her
poor name-sake ship. . . .</p>
<p>"In your Law Courts, Counsel loved her as a most remunerative
vessel--remunerative to them, that is, though not to her
Owners.</p>
<p>"My first voyage in her was singularly unfortunate . . .
although personally I hadn't a great deal of which to
complain.</p>
<p>"Bound down-Channel, and having cleared the Straits, I left
the Mate and the Third Officer on the bridge, and went below for
a shave. When the youngster came and reported that the <i>Royal
Sovereign</i> Light Vessel was in sight, and bore a quarter-point
on the starboard bow, I sent him aft to read the log.</p>
<p>"Without stopping to tell me that the Mate also had left the
bridge (apparently he thought that such a minor detail wouldn't
interest me) the smart young Third Officer leapt to do my
bidding, while I, all unconscious that the officer of the watch
was not at his post, continued to lather my chin.</p>
<p>"You'd scarcely believe, would you, that a middle-aged Chief
Officer--a family-man who hoped for a command, and expected to
get one--could desert the bridge of a steamer, doing twelve
knots, at a place as crowded and busy as Hyde Park Corner, would
you?</p>
<p>"No, and yet that grey-haired bone-headed fool did that very
thing, just because he'd forgotten to fill his tobacco-pouch.
It's almost incredible. But that's the sort of man Rudolf,
Rosenbaum, Ritzenheimer &amp; Rumpf employed. They got them
cheap, like they did me.</p>
<p>"Suddenly the babel of shouts and curses that sent me, razor
in hand, flying up the bridge-ladder, brought him from his room,
one hand clutching a plug of tobacco, and the other an open
knife.</p>
<p>"Mechanically I remembered <i>Sound Signals for Vessels in
Sight of One Another,</i> and that three short blasts mean '<i>My
engines are going Full Speed Astern</i>'.</p>
<p>"Scarcely had the steam of my third blast left the whistle,
when fairly and squarely between funnel and bridge, we hit a big
tramp steamer, and, my friend, the name of that big tramp steamer
was the <i>Actæon!</i></p>
<p>"Wasn't that an amusing coincidence--Diana and Actæon?"</p>
<p>"Yes," I agreed. "One of those strange things that do
happen."</p>
<p>"Ah, but there was more to it than that, and stranger to
come.</p>
<p>"Well, as I was saying, I had perfectly uselessly, and really
most fatuously, done the correct thing: and later on, in London,
at the inquiry, I was actually complimented on my presence of
mind and scrupulous adherence to the <i>Regulations for
Preventing Collisions at Sea.</i></p>
<p>"I almost laughed in Court, for my three blasts and putting
the engines Full Speed Astern didn't effect the issue one
iota--did not make one hair's-breadth of difference.</p>
<p>"But never mind, I'd done the correct thing, and a Court of
Inquiry will always tell you that you are not there to think or
use your discretion, but to do whatever is Laid Down in the Book,
and not to use your judgment as to its probable efficacy.</p>
<p>"Anyhow, like a knife into cheese, the <i>Diana's</i> sharp
stem cut clean into that steamer's rusty side. Through
shell-plating, steam-pipes, decks and angle-irons; through the
very hatch-coamings, she thrust and sheared--and when the awful
heartrending sound of crashing, grinding, hissing, and jarring,
had almost subsided, a Limehouse fireman suddenly bawled,</p>
<p>"''Ere, why don't you look where you're goin'?'</p>
<p>"And our poor demoralized Mate, who was wholly responsible,
burst into noisy sobs.</p>
<p>"I am not a phlegmatic Englishman, my friend, and I admit that
I administered to that man the kick of a lifetime. . . .</p>
<p>"In order that her crew should not go down with her, I went
gently ahead and kept going, in order that, for as long as
possible, <i>Diana</i> herself should plug the huge gash that she
had rent in the side of <i>Actæon.</i></p>
<p>"As it happened, I needn't have worried. <i>Actæon</i> had no
intention of leaving <i>Diana,</i> and hung on like grim death.
We were held as though we were part of her.</p>
<p>"When the Captain's daughter, all the seamen, the officers
(with the exception of the Third Mate) and the Captain himself
had been hauled aboard the <i>Diana,</i> I put her engines Full
Astern--and found that I couldn't make her budge an inch.</p>
<p>"Eventually, after going ahead and then astern until the
engineers were nearly frantic, the <i>Diana</i> came away with a
rush, and it almost seemed as though, in sinking, the poor old
<i>Actæon</i> took a last dying bite, revengeful and despairing,
at <i>Diana.</i></p>
<p>"It was a bite, too: a real mouthful.</p>
<p>"We were laden with general cargo for Adelaide and Freemantle,
and part of it consisted of whisky--quite a lot of which, from
Number One hold, never reached Australia.</p>
<p>"You have an expression 'drinking like a fish', haven't you?
Well, the <i>Actæon</i> gave the little fishes plenty with which
to get canned.</p>
<p>"As she plunged to Davy Jones, she took our forepeak, our
chain-locker and, from under the fore-hatch, about twenty feet of
the for'ard ballast tanks--and naturally, while many tons of our
cargo dropped out, an equal bulk of the English Channel rushed
in.</p>
<p>"With the weight of water in Number One hold putting us down
by the head, our Chaste <i>Diana's</i> arrow actually stabbed the
'vassal waves', and our uplifted racing propellor beat the air
more than it did the water, and she was about as easy to handle
as a water-logged sand-barge.</p>
<p>"A most delightful state of affairs in that particular
situation, as any sailor will tell you.</p>
<p>"And then, just to cheer us up, we found that not only were
both chains holding us, but they were taking the strain down
through the deck abaft the windlass. And since that windlass was
on the fo'c'sle-head--which was now merely a precarious
jutting-out platform--our cables were what Captain Jones of the
Aldgate Academy had called 'end for end', anchors on board ship
and cable-ends on sea-bottom!</p>
<p>"Of course, I tried to heave them out, but as the
<i>Actæon</i> was apparently anxious to come up with them, I was
afraid to put any further strain on our already strained and
unsupported fore-deck.</p>
<p>"Much against the grain, and with bitter curses at the Mate,
the <i>Actæon,</i> Fate, and a fool called Krassilov, I
unshackled those perfectly good chains, and, since she wanted
them so badly, let the <i>Actæon</i> have them. . . .</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"It's marvellous how tug-boats scent trouble from afar.
They're the vultures of the ocean. It's a case of,</p>
<p>"'Look aht for my 'eavin'-line, Sir,'</p>
<p>and somebody, without thought, hauls away, and the moment the
tow-rope is aboard, a colossal great account for 'assistance
rendered' is automatically incurred.</p>
<p>"Why, one night, off Gravesend, I dragged anchor a little, and
was only just in time to cut a tug-boat's heaving-line that my
Third Mate had seized and was hauling in with great
enthusiasm.</p>
<p>"What I called the young fool was nothing to what the
tug-boat's skipper called me--and had I not arrived just in the
Old Nick of time, that would have been less than nothing to what
my Owner would have called me.</p>
<p>"Nevertheless, for once in my life, I was really glad to see
the tugs, and having engaged four to tow us stern first, we
limped home into London River.</p>
<p>"Thus, as though coyly retreating backwards before the
advances of importunate Olympian lovers, <i>Diana</i> left poor
stricken <i>Actæon</i> to be torn by the hounds--of Neptune. . .
.</p>
<p>"Hark!"</p>
<p>I listened, straining my ears as we both lay motionless and
silent.</p>
<p>I could hear nothing.</p>
<p>Apparently, neither could Krassilov.</p>
<p>"I thought that hatch opened again," he said.</p>
<p>And again we listened.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>"Now, I'll tell you about the other Diana, the girl," he
resumed, a few minutes later.</p>
<p>"I learned a lot about Diana Robinson--before I had finished
with the <i>Diana-Actæon</i> business--and guessed a good deal
more, and I'll tell you the truth as I see it.</p>
<p>"Whether she was a shameless minx, or merely a girl wildly in
love for the first time, I don't know. But, of course, the terms
may be synonymous.</p>
<p>"Anyhow, it clearly transpired that she deliberately dogged
the footsteps of the Third Mate of the <i>Actæon</i> and quite
unintentionally fell into his very willing arms. Nevertheless, I
have reason to believe that an hour before the trouble with the
sailor, he had been less necessary to her comfort, and of no more
personal interest than the Cook's Mate.</p>
<p>"It happened like this.</p>
<p>"With a magazine in her hand, she had made herself comfortable
on the settee in her father's sitting-room, and lulled by the
rhythmic beating of the ship's heart and the warm softness of the
starry night, it was only subconsciously that she heard seven
strokes struck on the wheel-house bell above her head.</p>
<p>"By merely stretching forth her hand, she could have touched
the Captain in his arm-chair, but his voice, saying something
about half-past eleven and beauty sleep, seemed to come from
another world.</p>
<p>"Suddenly, the faint hum of the electric fan was broken by
hideous noises--curses and a sound like that of a body being
dragged down the bridge ladder.</p>
<p>"Captain Robinson, who was getting on in years, and hated
unusual happenings and emergencies, got up, went to the
chart-room door and called out excitedly.</p>
<p>"Outside the door, the Third Mate, in deep tones, calm and
deliberate, answered,</p>
<p>"'It's all right, Sir. This man's been drinking, I should
think. He can't keep a straight course, nor a civil tongue, so
I've put him off the bridge. I think he'd better stay off . . .
and take his trick at the wheel when he can both steer and be
civil.'</p>
<p>"Suddenly, and as though from nowhere, an ugly knife
materialized in the hand of the swarthy glittering-eyed seaman,
and, from the doorway, Diana saw him crouch and spring.</p>
<p>"But even before she could cry out, the officer also sprang,
and she marvelled that so huge a man could move so swiftly, so
lightly.</p>
<p>"There was a blow, a clutch of a big hand--and the keen knife
stuck quivering in the deck, instantly to be kicked overboard by
the Captain, as the sailor's empty brown hand was pushed up and
over its owner's head.</p>
<p>"'Now, if you struggle you will certainly dislocate your
shoulder,' said the Third Mate's quiet voice. ' . . . Go for'ard
at once, before I hurt you,' and, most vigorously propelled, the
sailor clattered down the main deck.</p>
<p>"With evident relief, the Captain returned to the Chart Room.
The young man had handled the matter very well, thought he, and
now the matter was closed.</p>
<p>"That was where he was wrong. It was only just beginning.</p>
<p>"Another of the Olympians had joined <i>Actæon.</i> Suddenly
and unannounced, as so often happens, Eros had come on board, and
had already invaded the boat-deck.</p>
<p>"Brought up almost entirely among men, the Captain's daughter
knew a man from a man, and with the infallibility of youth, the
essential qualifications and characteristics of a really 'real'
Man. And in these few moments this stalwart young officer, of
whom she had hitherto taken no particular note, had exhibited
some of those most essential, according to her strict code.</p>
<p>"His defeat of an insolent, dangerous and treacherous foe had
been extremely competent, easy and quiet. Unruffled, he had shown
a respectful deference to her father; there had been a complete
absence of anger, bluster, and bravado; and although he had been
quite unaware of the presence of a woman, there had been no bad
language, no coarse, ugly or blasphemous words. In fact, he had
spoken very nicely, and where some young men would have swaggered
and expected approval for their achievement, his cultured voice
had been rather apologetic.</p>
<p>"And there he stood, illuminated by the brilliant cabin
light.</p>
<p>"That was his fate, for it cost him his life and herself great
sorrow.</p>
<p>"It was strange, thought Diana, that hitherto she had not
noticed him particularly.</p>
<p>"Certainly Eros was now busily at work.</p>
<p>"How blind she had been!</p>
<p>"She must have seen him--but without seeing.</p>
<p>"Certainly a seafaring giant, more or less, was nothing
unusual, but this man was definitely unusual in face and voice
and figure. . . . He had acted with the grace and speed of a
tiger. . . . Every movement was eloquent of latent dynamic
energy. . . .</p>
<p>"How splendidly his beautiful head was set on the great broad
shoulders; what magnificent eyes he had; and what hair!
Absolutely wasted on a man.</p>
<p>"And how he was staring! But then, so was she. They were
staring at each other. He was positively devouring her with his
eyes--as her favourite novel said.</p>
<p>"Thus Diana.</p>
<p>"But upon the Third Officer, Eros had wrought with equal
skill--equally well . . . or ill. And it is not matter for wonder
that the youth found the girl desirable.</p>
<p>"I tell you, <i>mon ami,</i> she was beautiful, and I do not
use that word lightly."</p>
<p>"I seem to remember a Katinka," I murmured.</p>
<p>"Quite so," agreed Krassilov. "Diana was the blonde
counterpart of brunette Katinka. Katinka was a type--<i>the</i>
type--of Latin beauty; dark, expressive, changeful, glowing,
warm. . . . Diana was a type--<i>the</i> type--of your
Anglo-Saxon beauty; fair, calm, poised, cool . . . oh, maddening
in her unchanging unconscious uncaring loveliness. I fell in love
with her myself.</p>
<p>"No, it is not strange that the Third Officer stared. A
well-bred man of fastidious taste, he decided that here was Diana
indeed. . . . Diana re-incarnate . . . amazingly appropriate . .
. that the gods had been amusing themselves with a whimsy most
<i>à propos.</i> Then, forcing his mind back to earth--and
sea--he realized that he was staring, bowed, and expressed his
regret that Miss Robinson had been disturbed and his hope that
she had not been alarmed.</p>
<p>"Diana, wondering why her heart fluttered, as never before in
the worst emergency had it so misbehaved, coolly assured him that
most certainly she was in no wise disturbed--much less
alarmed.</p>
<p>"In proof of this she suddenly paled and gasped,</p>
<p>"'<i>Oh . . .</i> that man stabbed you! There is blood on your
arm!'</p>
<p>"Surely young Eros smiled and held his breath as he waited to
hear--and see--the answer.</p>
<p>"He heard--and saw.</p>
<p>"'It's only the scratch of a broken button, Miss . . .
Diana.'</p>
<p>"But she had, as she spoke, unconsciously (perhaps) clutched
his wrist . . . and as he whispered the last word 'Diana' he
bent, and reverently but firmly pressing his lips to the back of
her hand, kissed it warmly.</p>
<p>"The ship's bell tolled 'One'.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>"How swiftly the hours had passed.</p>
<p>"With clenched, clasped hands, Diana gave herself up to a riot
of contending thoughts, gave way before a rush of overwhelming
feelings, and merry Eros shook with silent laughter.</p>
<p>"The Third Officer had kissed her hand!</p>
<p>"What impudence! What folly! What cheek! And if the man must
kiss, why not cheek? Why not lips, if it came to that?</p>
<p>"Why, she didn't so much as know his name.</p>
<p>"She could soon remedy that, however.</p>
<p>"Oh, Henry Dallingham, was it?</p>
<p>"Henry Dallingham, a mere junior officer. But what a
fascinating one! . . . If he <i>had</i> kissed her lips! Fancy
being held in those mighty arms . . . close against that great
broad chest. . . .</p>
<p>"That's quite enough, Diana. And don't all sailors kiss . . .
any girl who'll allow herself to be kissed? A girl in every port.
And, after all, he'd only kissed her hand. That was nothing.</p>
<p>"But the look in his wonderful clear eyes, as he stared at
her--that wasn't 'nothing'. It was very much 'something'.
Although quite nice and respectful, it was undoubtedly
'something'.</p>
<p>"He wanted her.</p>
<p>"Eight bells. . . .</p>
<p>"'All's well, Sir.'</p>
<p>"He would be coming off watch now. He would go down to the
main deck, turn sharp to the left and enter the starboard door of
the thwartship alley-way.</p>
<p>"Swiftly and silently Diana ran down her father's private
staircase, through the saloon and out into the alley-way. As the
Third Officer reached the door, she stepped out and collided with
him, and, to steady herself, clutched his arm.</p>
<p>"The <i>Actæon</i> obligingly lurching at the moment, the
Third Officer was constrained to throw his arm about her to save
her from a fall.</p>
<p>"As she made no further movement, though the ship made
several, he assumed that the situation was not distasteful to
Diana Robinson.</p>
<p>"A man of action, and ever an opportunist, he murmured a
question.</p>
<p>"'Er--do you believe in love at first sight, Miss Robinson? .
. .'</p>
<p>"About half an hour later, during which time she had not been
wholly silent, she observed,</p>
<p>"'I only came out here for a breath of fresh air,' and
added,</p>
<p>"'This air is much superior to that outside my room.'</p>
<p>"And a little later still,</p>
<p>"'Yes. You may have just one more . . . Harry. Good night . .
. dear.'</p>
<p>"Fortunately for her peace of mind, Diana, having reached her
cabin, could not see her new-found lover as he heavily pounded
with clenched fists upon the bulwarks, nor note the look of
remorse and despair with which he gazed unseeing at the horizon;
nor hear the words which, through clenched teeth, came whispered
forth as though wrung from him by pain.</p>
<p>"'You <i>fool!</i>'</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>"You say, in your beautiful language, that Distance lends
enchantment, and that Time magnifies the charm of a voice that is
still.</p>
<p>"We, a gloomy people, express it differently, and with a note
of cynicism.</p>
<p>"When Time had partially healed her wound, Diana Robinson, as
she herself told me, regarded the period of her first love-affair
and brief courtship as the happiest period of her life.</p>
<p>"Nevertheless, into her golden happiness there began to creep,
after a few halcyon days, the shadow of misgivings and
doubts.</p>
<p>"In vain she occasionally reminded herself that 'perfect love
casteth out fear'. Why, then, did she find herself increasingly
afraid?</p>
<p>"And why did her lover withhold all mention of his earlier
career . . . prevaricate about his previous work . . . make
contradictory statements about his boyhood and parentage?</p>
<p>"And why did he insist so strenuously that she must not say
anything to her father: prohibit so peremptorily any announcement
of their engagement? Why did he insist so seriously that Diana
Robinson's future husband must be <i>Captain</i> Henry
Dallingham?</p>
<p>"Could a past that had to be concealed like this be honourable
or blameless?</p>
<p>"Personally I think that there is no more erroneous and
fatuous saying than your adage that love is blind. I should say
that on the contrary no eyes are keener than those of one who
loves, especially of a woman in love, and for the first time.</p>
<p>"And all the skill of the Third Officer's plausible and
willing tongue failed to remove from Diana's mind the feeling
that there was something wrong; that he was not all he appeared;
and that some trouble, danger and shame overshadowed him.</p>
<p>"Being the Captain's daughter, and privileged, she would pay
sudden surprise visits to the bridge, coming upon him unawares;
and usually she would find him standing dejected, staring out to
sea with an expression of misery upon his handsome face--misery,
remorse, and fear.</p>
<p>"Nevertheless, in the dark and gloomy sky that was spreading
over her happiness like the pall of night, there was one bright
and steady light, one glowing, gleaming beacon--the conviction,
the certainty, that he loved her passionately.</p>
<p>"Then, one day, Fate intervened--with an instrument too small
to see . . . a microbe.</p>
<p>"The strong young giant suddenly went down with a violent
attack of a malignant malaria.</p>
<p>"All else was forgotten but his danger, and Diana's one
anxiety was that, as his nurse, she might make no mistake, and
might successfully and soon bring him back to consciousness and
health.</p>
<p>"For when he was not asleep, or in what seemed to her to be a
state of coma, he was delirious, and, curiously enough, in his
delirium, he shouted, talked, mumbled and muttered in a foreign
language. Always in a foreign language; never in English.</p>
<p>"Taking a firm stand against her father's expostulation, Diana
insisted on tending the invalid almost constantly. She would only
leave him when her place could be taken by someone in whom she
had complete trust.</p>
<p>"Regularly she visited the invalid before she retired at
night, and spent a last hour in soothing and comforting him if he
were awake, or watching him if he were asleep.</p>
<p>"One night, before the arrival of her relief, the Senior
Apprentice (a youth who would have dived overboard to retrieve
her handkerchief), she laid her cool hands on the sick man's
forehead, kissed the crisply waving hair above it, and murmured
his name.</p>
<p>"Suddenly springing up, he snatched his jacket from its hook
upon the bulkhead, violently ripped open a portion of its lining,
snatched forth an oilskin envelope, emptied its contents upon the
bedside-table, and, with feverish anxiety and haste, spread them
out before her.</p>
<p>"As he did so, he gabbled in a foreign tongue--which she knew
was neither French nor German, and believed to be neither Spanish
nor Italian--and repeatedly uttered what were apparently the
names of women.</p>
<p>"'Alexevana . . . Marya . . . Katrina . . . Daria . . .'</p>
<p>"But surely these were Russian.</p>
<p>"What an extraordinary thing!</p>
<p>"And then with utter amazement, Diana realized that the papers
were beautifully drawn maps and plans; fortresses, harbours,
air-and-sea routes, and, curiously enough, headed with such words
as <i>Flugmaschinen Linien, Harven für Untersee Boote, Amunitions
fabric</i> . . .</p>
<p>"But these were German and she could understand them.</p>
<p>"And among these papers, maps, plans, drawings, charts and
blue-prints, were photographs--a photograph of an officer in
military uniform, the photograph of 'Henry Dallingham'; a
photograph of that same Henry Dallingham seated beside a bold and
flashy-looking, if beautiful, woman, his arm about her waist. . .
. Another photograph that . . .</p>
<p>"Diana flung it from her as though it burnt her hand.</p>
<p>"The Third Officer, babbling incoherently, fell back upon the
pillow.</p>
<p>"Diana's knees seemed about to give way. With a hand to her
twitching mouth, she hurried from the cabin. Face down on her
settee she was wracked with a paroxysm of sobbing.</p>
<p>"So that was it!</p>
<p>"That was the cause of his strangeness, his secrecy, anxiety
and worry.</p>
<p>"For many generations her forebears had sailed, first under
the White Ensign and then under the Red--that your British
Mercantile Marine fondly terms the Old Red Duster. And this
man--this spy--would sail under its protection, would he--to use
it for subversive ends; to wrong it; to violate it? Sail in her
father's ship: make love to her father's daughter!</p>
<p>"What an unimaginable fool she had been! Of course he did not
love her. She was a pawn in his game. The sort of woman he would
love would be the things in that . . . photograph; the women
whose names he called on in delirium.</p>
<p>"Strange that they should all be Russian names. Doubtless the
language in which he had gabbled had been Russian, too, although
the writing on his maps and plans had been German.</p>
<p>"A sort of double disguise, perhaps--a Russian pretending to
be German, if it were discovered that he was not English.</p>
<p>"What was he? One of those avowedly and unashamedly murderous
Bolsheviks?</p>
<p>"Whatever else he was, he was a very clever man, for he had
deceived her completely.</p>
<p>"Possibly Diana Robinson might prove to be a clever girl--and
deceive him completely.</p>
<p>"After bathing her eyes and adding a touch of colour to her
white cheeks, she returned to the sick man's cabin. Apparently no
one had entered it in her absence. The hateful creature still lay
muttering in his bunk--the papers and photographs as she had left
them on the table.</p>
<p>"Picking up his coat and gathering the papers together, Diana
returned to her room. Here she packed the oilskin envelope with
notepaper of a bulk about equal to that of the maps, plans and
photographs, replaced the packet inside the lining of the coat,
and, with deft fingers, so skilfully re-sewed it that the owner
of the coat would be unlikely to notice that it had been
disturbed. . . .</p>
<p>"Such is woman's power of dissimulation, and courage in
bearing and hiding pain, that when Diana entered the Captain's
cabin, he had no idea that anything was wrong, no inkling of his
daughter's anguish.</p>
<p>"Smiling brightly at her father,</p>
<p>"'Daddy,' she said, 'I'm tired of this nursing job . . . and I
think you ought to take charge of the Third Mate's clothes. And
you must put a man to look after him. He's too much for me. I
found him delirious and trying to get up and dress to go on
watch.'</p>
<p>"So, with feminine guile, Diana ensured that the spy's
self-revelation would not be repeated. . . .</p>
<p>"For Diana the days passed somehow, as, with unusual good
fortune, the <i>Actæon</i> carried her fine weather to the very
chops of the Channel.</p>
<p>"One morning, feeling himself able to resume duty, the Third
Officer went up to relieve the Mate for the forenoon watch.</p>
<p>"Having seen him enter up the compass deviation obtained from
an azimuth, Diana visited the bridge, and for the first time the
flash of the Third Officer's white teeth brought no answering
smile to her face.</p>
<p>"'Why so solemn, my nurse . . . my dear?' he asked, gazing
into her eyes and scanning her face anxiously.</p>
<p>"'I'm no longer one of your--dears,' replied Diana, quietly
and somewhat grimly. 'And I wouldn't nurse you if you were dying.
. . . But because I have been your . . . <i>fool,</i> I'll give
you twenty-four hours in which to get out of England when we get
there . . . twenty-four hours, from the time of your discharge in
London, in which to get back to Germany, or Russia, or wherever
your sty is. . . . I ought not to give you a chance at all. . . .
But at the end of that time, I'll certainly put the police on
your track.'</p>
<p>"The Third Officer grinned, chuckled, and then laughed so
heartily and with such apparently genuine amusement, that Diana
was amazed, frightened.</p>
<p>"Was it possible she had been guilty of misjudging him? And if
not, what aplomb, what readiness and perfect poise! What an actor
was this spy!</p>
<p>"Could she have been mistaken?</p>
<p>"Of course not. Photographs are photographs. And delirious
Englishmen don't talk nothing but Russian. Nor do English
officers secretly carry plans of English Naval Bases, Munition
Works and Forts; nor masses of notes and formulæ written in a
foreign language.</p>
<p>"No, obviously he was a spy, and, thought Diana bitterly, if
there were many such, it boded ill for England.</p>
<p>"With a sort of amused, gay tenderness, he chaffed the
indignant yet bewildered girl.</p>
<p>"'You are overwrought, Diana,' he concluded. 'You've been on
board too long, and then this nursing . . . over-conscientious
kindness and loving care. And this spy-business--of course it
worried and upset you and gave you a shock. I shall <i>have</i>
to make a confession now . . .'</p>
<p>"Diana recoiled.</p>
<p>"'. . . and tell you a secret--something I had not intended to
mention until I succeeded. I am writing a book . . . a spy story.
I hope to make money . . . possibly become famous. I wanted to
give my sweetheart a surprise.'</p>
<p>"'You've certainly given me a surprise,' replied Diana, and
added bitterly,</p>
<p>"'What a fool you must think me!'</p>
<p>"'But why, Diana? Why? What makes you say such a thing? Why
should I think you're a fool?'</p>
<p>"'Because you imagine I am so easily deceived. . . . A book! A
spy story!</p>
<p>"'Plausible rubbish,' she added, fighting back the tears that
would well up--force their way, it seemed, from her aching heart
to her smarting eyes.</p>
<p>"The Third Officer, striding forward, extended his arms.</p>
<p>"'Diana,' he said, 'tell me . . . answer me one question. Do
you believe that I love you? . . . Love you absolutely . . . want
nothing in the whole world as I want you?'</p>
<p>"'I did think so,' replied Diana. 'I did believe it. Yes, I
believed it--perhaps because I wanted to. . . . Now I
need--proof.'</p>
<p>"'Proof, Diana? Why, what proof can I give? What proof is
there that I would not give? Tell me how I can . . .'</p>
<p>"Straining every nerve to prevent her voice from faltering,
her gaze from wavering from his, Diana made answer.</p>
<p>"'By throwing overboard the packet that you carry inside the
lining of your jacket.'</p>
<p>"The Third Officer gave a perceptible start. The expression of
his face changed, and the look in his eyes hardened. But almost
simultaneously, he laughed lightly, merrily.</p>
<p>"'But, darling, not the manuscript of the great work? You're
not jealous of that? You don't mind my trying to leave the sea
and make name and fame and wealth as a writer of fiction that . .
.'</p>
<p>'"I am not alluding to fiction,' interrupted Diana coldly, an
angry frown marring her young face. 'I'm referring to maps and
plans and charts and drawings and masses of notes written in a
foreign language--secret information that you have gathered to
send to your German or Russian employers.'</p>
<p>"And then to Diana's shame and horror, if not to her surprise,
the man, with flushed face and clenched fist, swore in some
foreign tongue.</p>
<p>"Most obviously he was swearing; swearing at her; cursing
her.</p>
<p>"She had been right. The man was a foreigner, a Secret Service
Agent, a spy. . . . And she had loved him so.</p>
<p>"And now how she hated him! How she loved him!</p>
<p>"Oh, God! What should she do?</p>
<p>"Even now she must fight against herself--fight to prevent
herself from forgiving him, comforting him, loving him, throwing
her arms about his neck as he stood there, holding to the rail
with a grip that whitened his knuckles, his face a study of
misery, anger . . .</p>
<p>"Suddenly he turned to her.</p>
<p>"'Diana,' he said, 'will you hear me? Will you give me a
chance to explain . . . to tell the truth . . . to do myself
justice . . . clear myself . . . in your eyes? Be just, Diana.
Give me a hearing. I cannot tell you the whole story here, now.
Give me a chance, Diana. I'll tell you the truth, and you shall
judge. Don't condemn me unheard. Don't ruin my life . . . and
yours. For you do love me, Diana. You know you do. <i>I</i> know
you do. You love me and I worship you . . . adore you.</p>
<p>"'You'll hear me, won't you? Give me a chance . . . give
<i>us</i> a chance. Oh, Diana, be just . . . be fair . . . be
sensible. May I come to your cabin . . . or will you come to
mine?'</p>
<p>"'Throw that packet overboard--now,' replied Diana, 'and then
I'll answer you.'</p>
<p>"'Diana! . . .'</p>
<p>"Turning on her heel, the girl walked away without another
word, and descending from the bridge went to her cabin.</p>
<p>"Gazing after her, the Third Officer ground his teeth and
swore again.</p>
<p>"The horns of a dilemma indeed! The fruits of his long,
arduous and dangerous labours he would not give up. This girl who
had got into his very blood, the first woman for whom he had ever
really turned aside, he would not give up.</p>
<p>"His work was his life, success his mistress.</p>
<p>"This girl was his life. . . . His mistress?</p>
<p>"A look of cunning displaced that of despairing anger upon his
flushed face. His set jaw and mouth relaxed as his lips pursed
and then twisted into an unpleasant smile.</p>
<p>"An idea, a plan.</p>
<p>"Success would be--glorious success. Failure would make the
position but little worse than it already was.</p>
<p>"And serve her right, the little devil. How dared she? And how
on earth had she found him out, discovered his secret? His
intuition, instinct, experience, psychology, flair . . . all were
at fault if she were other than she seemed.</p>
<p>"Surely she was not of those who go through the pockets of a
sleeping man; search a sick man's clothes and kit; open his
correspondence; pry into his obviously most private and secret
documents.</p>
<p>"Could it be possible that it was a case of diamond cut
diamond, and that the chit was, herself, a Secret Service
Agent?</p>
<p>"Could it be possible that she was not the Captain's daughter
at all; that she had been following him the whole time, and had
come on board this ship simply to fool him and trap him, and get
his documents--his notes and plans and papers?</p>
<p>"Could it be possible that she was no more English than he
was--and that the fruits of his labours were to be plucked by
those who were as much the enemies of his country as they were
the enemies of England?</p>
<p>"Oh, nonsense! She was English, all right. Yes, but was she in
the English Secret Service? And was his work to be undone?</p>
<p>"No, nonsense! She was just Miss Bread-and-Butter, the
Captain's daughter, and very much a girl in love. And his plan
would work.</p>
<p>"It would have to work. He'd make it work. And she'd be only
too glad for it to work--afterwards.</p>
<p>"But what a mystery . . . about her discovery of that
packet--her thorough investigation of its contents.</p>
<p>"Well, well, you never knew with women: and the more you knew
the less you were certain. Perhaps she thought she'd discovered a
bundle of love-letters and therefore opened the packet. . . .</p>
<p>"That girl was going to be useful to him later on.</p>
<p>"But, God, how he loved her!</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>"Diana woke suddenly and shot upright in bed.</p>
<p>"What was that?</p>
<p>"'Who's there?'</p>
<p>"'It is I, Diana . . . Harry.'</p>
<p>"'How dare you! Go at once. Get out. You can't talk to me here
. . . now.'</p>
<p>"'I don't want to talk to you, Diana.'</p>
<p>"'Then why have you dared to come here?'</p>
<p>"'Because I had no choice . . . because I love you . . . and
because you love me. Diana, you're going to be mine . . . now.
Now and always. I love you so much that I'm going to make sure of
you. I daren't risk losing you. You gave me such a fright with
your foolish talk, your mad suspicion. . . . <i>Diana</i> . . .
No, you can't get to that bell, and if you scream, I'll gag you.
<i>Quiet!</i> I . . .'</p>
<p>"His great hand was over her mouth. She was suffocating; she
was going to faint.</p>
<p>"<i>Crash!</i> . . .</p>
<p>"Amid a sudden rush and trampling of feet and a burst of
shouting, the <i>Actæon</i> staggered under a giant's blow, and
taking a quick and awful list to starboard, shuddered horribly
throughout her length.</p>
<p>"The Third Officer was thrown from where he knelt above Diana,
across the cabin and against the door.</p>
<p>"Like a pen piercing thin paper, a bowsprit ripped open the
side of the cabin, and there, before him, serene, aloof, yet
menacing and terrible, appeared another Diana, white, avenging,
armed, gazing into his staring eyes.</p>
<p>"To his shocked brain, it seemed as though, with an awful
shrieking and a dreadful grinding, the Goddess Diana herself had
burst in, to protect her namesake. And, indeed, as he shrank back
against the stout teak door, a golden arrow-head was presented at
his breast.</p>
<p>"Closer . . . closer . . . closer . . . his brain reeling, his
knees giving way beneath him; mind and body failing together; no
strength to save himself; no weapon for attack or defence; no
space in which to move . . . the arrow . . . the arrow. . .
touching him . . . hurting him. . . .</p>
<p>"One arm he flung above his head, one he threw across his
face.</p>
<p>"As the arrow transfixed his heart, he shrieked,</p>
<p>"'Diana!'</p>
<p>"And struck by a piece of flying metal, the ship's bell tolled
'One'."</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">II</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Krassilov," I said, a little later, when my mind had returned
to earth and the bitter blackness of our cell. "I thank you from
the bottom of my soul. You took me out of prison."</p>
<p>"Krassilov," I asked, a little later still, "did Chavart have
a mouse?"</p>
<p>"He did."</p>
<p>"Did Ghisonaccia kill it?"</p>
<p>"He did."</p>
<p>"Did Chavart say he would kill Ghisonaccia?"</p>
<p>"He did."</p>
<p>"Did Ghisonaccia kill Chavart?"</p>
<p>"He did."</p>
<p>"Did Chavart's ghost kill Ghisonaccia?" I tapped.</p>
<p>"It did not."</p>
<p>"Who did?"</p>
<p>"I did, of course. Didn't you see me?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c406" id="c406"><i>Nemesis</i></a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>I woke suddenly from what was either a brief doze, a short
light nap, or else a long, profound, and heavy slumber. One never
knew which, in that ghastly darkness, that awful pitch-black
silence.</p>
<p>Instantly I stretched forth my hand to "see" whether Krassilov
was still there. He was, thank God, and I put away from me the
thought of how I should feel when they took him away again, and I
was once more alone to fight a losing battle with madness.</p>
<p>On the whole, it would be worse than before Krassilov came;
the silence would be even deeper, the blackness even blacker.</p>
<p>Before long, I should not really be alone in my cell. There
would be a Thing. It would lurk and creep and crawl, circling
around me. I should get up into a corner, and then it would sidle
along the wall toward me, first on my right and then on my left,
advancing and retreating--sometimes touching me before it drew
back. Always it would retreat after an advance, but never, never
would it retreat quite as far. Each approach would be from a
nearer spot, nearer and nearer, until at last it <i>sprang</i>
and fastened on me and seized me for its own--for ever.</p>
<p>A vast Thing, like a colossal spider, and its
name--Madness.</p>
<p>And when it sprang and seized me I should scream, and then,
insanely striving to shake it off, to free myself from its
clutch, to get its terrible claws from out my brain, I should
leap up and dash my head against the wall. Again . . . and again
. . . and again.</p>
<p>"What's up?" said Krassilov.</p>
<p>"Nothing," I replied.</p>
<p>"Sounded as though you were choking. You reminded me of
Antonovitch."</p>
<p>And he laughed.</p>
<p>"I suppose there is some sort of ventilation to these cells,"
he added.</p>
<p>"I suppose so," I replied. "Must be, or we should be dead by
now. . . . I suppose we aren't dead, are we? Dead and in
Hell?"</p>
<p>"In Hell, but not dead," answered Krassilov. "I'm awfully
sorry that--er--Chavart's ghost should have brought you to this
suffering. . . . However, you'll agree that it was in a good
cause . . . oh, an excellent cause."</p>
<p>And Krassilov again laughed his curious sardonic chuckle. It
recalled to my mind something that he had said when he laughed
before--something about reminding him of Antonovitch.</p>
<p>"Who was Antonovitch?" I asked.</p>
<p>Again Krassilov chuckled.</p>
<p>"Ha, ha! <i>ce bon</i> Antonovitch. There's one thing, my
friend, a comforting thought to me. He's a million times worse
off than we are. A tender-skinned, juicy worm, wriggling on the
red-hot floor of the cellars of Hell. . . . A murderous,
treacherous, sadistic slaughterer. . . . <i>Tovarisch</i>
Antonovitch, born a gentleman and died a willing, nay, an
enthusiastic, servant and helper of the bloody-handed,
bloody-minded butchers who had tortured and slain every friend,
relation, comrade, and caste-fellow that the dog had ever
had.</p>
<p>"Oh, but what a cosmic jest of the High Gods! What a colossal,
noble joke! He was <i>the</i> man who digged a pit for his enemy
and fell into it himself; <i>the</i> engineer who was hoist with
his own petard.</p>
<p>"Oh, <i>ce bon</i> Antonovitch! I'll tell you. Really too
funny."</p>
<p>"Did you play one of your practical jokes on him?" I asked,
thinking of a certain Skiros and of one Ghisonaccia.</p>
<p>"No. It was practical enough, but it wasn't one of mine. It
was one of Fate's little jokes--Fate's little ironies. . . .</p>
<p>"He was a <i>Tovarisch,</i> one of the new Comrades, so-called
because they have not a comradely atom in their make-up. Called
Comrades by themselves, <i>bien entendu,</i> because their name
is Hate; their religion, Hate; their attributes hatred, envy,
treachery, lying, and all those qualities that go to make all
that is not a gentleman. . . .</p>
<p>"Well, <i>Tovarisch</i> Antonovitch was travelling on the ship
on which I held undistinguished office in the engine-room, though
I'm not certain that those facts were in any way connected. There
was sufficient possibility of it, however, for me to take an
interest in the doings of Comrade Antonovitch; to watch his
comings and his goings, so far as I could, when the ship was in
port, and to learn of his habits from the cabin-steward and
deck-steward, to whom I made myself agreeable and profitable.</p>
<p>"'A studious gent,' he was reported to be. 'Always mucking
about with paper and pencil, figuring things out, and
over-inclined to raise 'ell if so much as a scrap of paper was
tidied up in his cabin.'</p>
<p>"'What sort of scraps of paper?'</p>
<p>"'Oh, bits of paper all covered over with figures and
letters--silly stuff.'</p>
<p>"'And books.'</p>
<p>"'All day long he'd have his nose in books, up on deck.'</p>
<p>"'What sort of books?'</p>
<p>"'Oh, silly books. Not the sort anybody would pinch and return
when done with. Science an' all that. . . . Chemistry an' all
that. . . . You know. . . . Books full of nothing but figures and
letters, like the papers he scribbled. . . . Barmy sort o' bloke.
Might be a professor, or a schoolmaster, or something silly like
that. . . .'</p>
<p>"All this information gave me a pretty shrewd guess at the
object of the activities of <i>Tovarisch</i> Antonovitch.</p>
<p>"What was he like? Oh, one of the half-baked intelligentsia
type; intense; had what he would have called pale clean-cut
features and burning eyes; and what I called skinny pasty face
with a mad look in it.</p>
<p>"He used to talk to himself too, out loud. He'd stand and
stare at the horizon and suddenly say:</p>
<p>"'The third time. Surely the third time. The third time is
always successful.'</p>
<p>"My friend the deck-steward told me that, not only had he
heard him say these words, but that on one occasion when the
Comrade had rung for him, and he had immediately responded, there
was a slight misunderstanding. For Antonovitch, with a frightful
scowl, growled,</p>
<p>"'The third time.'</p>
<p>"And the deck-steward was constrained to point out that it was
only the first time--that he had rung the bell.</p>
<p>"I came to the conclusion that the good Comrade had had two
unsuccessful shots at some villainy or other, and expected to
bring it off the third time.</p>
<p>"One day he rang his cabin bell--kept his finger on it until
the steward came running.</p>
<p>"Antonovitch was lying on his bunk, one hand clutching his
throat and the other still pressing the bell.</p>
<p>"'Help! . . . Help! . . . Good God! What is it? What is it?'
he gasped chokingly.</p>
<p>"'Wot's wot, Sir?' asked the surprised but phlegmatic
steward.</p>
<p>"Antonovitch gasped, coughed, clutched at his collar.</p>
<p>"'Help! . . . Help!' he croaked. 'It is suffocating me.'</p>
<p>"As the steward informed us that night, as we took the air
upon the after well-deck, he fair thought the bloke had got the
D.T.'s proper. And then he noticed that there was a curious smell
in the room--a nasty and increasing smell of smoke and burning
and of roasting flesh--apparently coming up through the floor of
the cabin or in at the port-hole.</p>
<p>"Yes, even as he sniffed, it got quite nasty, and where Mr.
Antonovitch was lying, just under the port-hole, it must be
worse.</p>
<p>"And then the fire-alarm bells rang, a bugle-call was blown
and the siren hooted.</p>
<p>"Promptly the steward fled to take his place at fire-stations.
Within a quarter of an hour he returned to reassure Mr.
Antonovitch.</p>
<p>"'It's all right, Sir,' he smiled. 'Nothing to be alarmed
about. Your cabin's right over the cook's galley, and a lot of
fat caught fire and blazed up.'</p>
<p>"'Blimey!' declared the steward in telling us this incident,
'you'd 'ave thought old whiskers had been nine-tenths stuffocated
and the other tenth spifflicated, the bloomin' fuss he made. Said
it was 'orrible, and he'd nearly died . . . nearly been choked by
the 'orrible fumes . . . and he'd have the law of the Company.
'Oo did they think they were, and 'oo did they think 'e was,
going about choking him like that? . . .</p>
<p>"'Never asked whether poor old Cookie and the cook's mate had
had their faces burnt off by the blaze.'</p>
<p>"And the second incident.</p>
<p>"We were headed for Colon at the entrance to the Panama Canal,
for which port, or rather gateway or clearing-house, Antonovitch
from the West was bound, to meet a Comrade from the East, one of
their damnable fomenters of trouble, whose ultimate success would
be the negation and disproof of the Eternal Justice of Things and
the Somehow Good.</p>
<p>"Now our course for Panama lay just south of the Island of
Oruba, about a dozen miles off the coast of Venezuela--a
god-forsaken hole that produces nothing but oil.</p>
<p>"At about midnight, as we passed just south of the island, I
came up on to the after well-deck for a breath of air. The wind
was north-west and just strong enough to waft to us the filthy
and somewhat suffocating smell of a burning gusher or something
of the sort. There was a lurid light above Oruba, and a dense
black cloud of smoke which stretched out towards us like a
gigantic hand, the finger-tips of which just failed to reach and
clutch us.</p>
<p>"It may have been the ordinary normal glow and fumes from a
great oil-refinery, but I remember thinking I shouldn't have
cared to be on board a sailing-ship becalmed in the middle of
that fog of smoke.</p>
<p>"As I say, it was unpleasant for a couple of minutes on the
open deck, and must have been still more unpleasant in any cabins
on the starboard side, that were just at the proper level to get
the full benefit of it.</p>
<p>"Apparently Comrade Antonovitch's cabin was, for once again
his bell pealed with a continuous ring.</p>
<p>"But by the time the man on night-duty had discovered who was
making the din, and had reached the corridor leading to
Antonovitch's cabin, that gentleman staggered forth in his
pyjamas, gasping, coughing, clutching his throat, fighting for
breath.</p>
<p>"'Air!' he managed to croak. 'Air!' and fell to the ground,
apparently in a fit of some kind.</p>
<p>"As the bewildered night-watchman remarked later, if air was
all the gent wanted, there was plenty of it about, and he might
as well come up on deck and sample it up there.</p>
<p>"Did he want a doctor?</p>
<p>"No, he wanted air.</p>
<p>"Up on the deserted deck, Antonovitch quickly recovered, but
begged the steward not to leave him there alone. When the man
again offered to fetch the doctor, Antonovitch assured him that
that was not necessary. He was in perfect health, and all that he
needed was fresh air.</p>
<p>"'Are many dead?' he asked. 'I expected to see the stairs and
corridors choked with them, dying as they fled from their cabins.
. . . How did you escape?"</p>
<p>"The steward's opinion that he had got hold of a 'delirious
trimmer' changed to a certainty that he'd got hold of a
lunatic.</p>
<p>"'Escape what, Sir?' the steward humoured him.</p>
<p>"'The gas, man. . . . The gas. . . . I was never nearer death
in my life. . . . I was sitting working and became subconsciously
aware of the smell, and at the back of my brain a foolish fancy
toyed with the thought that the smell came from the formulæ and
figures on my paper. Mathematical chemistry . . . but you
wouldn't understand. . . . And suddenly I awoke to reality and
leapt to my feet, choking, suffocating, dying. . . .'</p>
<p>"Eventually the steward brought up Antonovitch's overcoat and
rug, for he firmly refused to return to his cabin.</p>
<p>"And 'the third time,' as Antonovitch himself was so fond of
saying.</p>
<p>"At Colon he went ashore--and so did I--and at the Washington
Hotel I saw a face that I had never expected to see again, that
of the Comrade who there met Antonovitch.</p>
<p>"He brought him something--whether chemicals, documents or
money--for Antonovitch, who had gone there empty-handed, drove
away from the hotel with a heavy suitcase.</p>
<p>"From Colon we went to Kingston, and thence to Havana, where
we coaled.</p>
<p>"Now, coaling at Havana is, for passengers, a nasty, dirty and
noisy business. Much more so than at places like Aden or Port
Said, where an endless procession of niggers walks up the
gang-planks, each with half a pound of coal-dust in a
strawberry-basket on his head.</p>
<p>"At Havana it comes on by the truck-load and not by the
basketful. The trucks run to the end of the line, tip up, and
hurl the whole load on to a sloping iron chute, down which it
rolls, and from the end of which it falls with a noise like
thunder, through a hatch into the bowels of the ship.</p>
<p>"The row is deafening, the coal-dust is all-pervading, and the
heat is dreadful, as every door, window, and port-hole in the
whole ship is hermetically sealed. Otherwise there'd be a
quarter-inch layer of coal-dust on every bed, sofa, cushion,
carpet, tablecloth and everything else in the ship.</p>
<p>"<i>Tovarisch</i> Antonovitch sat working as usual, far into
the night. It was terribly hot and stuffy in his cabin in spite
of the electric fan, and from time to time he would leave his
cabin, go up the saloon companion, open the door and emerge upon
the blackened deck, in search of somewhat cooler and fresher
conditions.</p>
<p>"But not for long. Like most other people, he was defeated by
the coal-dust and the hellish din.</p>
<p>"In his cabin this was but a heavy rumble; outside it was
deafening--like standing under an iron bridge while express
trains rushed across it.</p>
<p>"At about two o'clock he had had enough of exchanging bad for
worse, and gave it up.</p>
<p>"Leaving his work on the little desk which was part of the
furniture of his cabin, he undressed and went to bed.</p>
<p>"At four o'clock, I--of all people in the world--had occasion
to go to his cabin, and you can take it that what I tell you now
is truth and fact, although I was not present when it happened. .
. . A child could have reconstructed it. . . .</p>
<p>"Antonovitch went to bed--and to sleep. . . . He dreamed. . .
. His dream was horrible . . . awful beyond telling. . . . The
horror of his life was upon him. . . . He was being suffocated .
. . choked. . . . He was dying. . . . Gasping and whooping, he
was vomiting his very lungs. . . . And yet he could not wake;
could not move; could not leap up and flee to safety. He was
bound hand and foot with invisible bonds. Could he but burst
them, he could save himself.</p>
<p>"A last mighty effort, with the strength of despair.</p>
<p>"He opened his eyes.</p>
<p>"The cabin was full of smoke.</p>
<p>"Fire!</p>
<p>"No. . . . The slowly revolving electric fan was oozing a
dense oily heavy stream of smoke that coiled downward to the
floor like a wreathing, writhing serpent. And the floor was
hidden from his sight in this dense green-grey dreadful
smoke.</p>
<p>"The unoiled electric fan had run hot and ever hotter until
the packing of greasy cotton-waste had caught fire and
smouldered.</p>
<p>"All this he saw at a glance, and with another mighty effort
struggled into a sitting position, coughing, choking,
gasping--rose to his feet, screamed, took a staggering step in
the direction of the door and collapsed into the terrible sea of
smoke--and died a dreadful death. . . .</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Word soon came from neighbouring cabins that smoke and smell
were issuing from Number 13. The Fourth Engineer, with me at his
heels, was soon on the spot. A glance showed us what had happened
and in a moment we had stopped the fan and opened the
port-hole.</p>
<p>"While the Fourth Engineer's head was stuck well out of the
latter, as he inhaled draughts of fresh air and coal-dust, I
looked at <i>Tovarisch</i> Antonovitch's papers lying as he had
left them on the table.</p>
<p>"I laughed. I admit it. . . .</p>
<p>"I enjoyed Fate's little joke. . . .</p>
<p>"<i>Poison-gas. . . !</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>"As I discovered from the diary that I promptly annexed, the
Comrade was at work on his third formula. He was inventing a
poison-gas, one container of which, dropped on a city, would turn
it within a few minutes to a City of the Dead. . . ."</p>

<h1><a name="c407" id="c407"><i>The Hunting of Henri</i></a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 1</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Henri Delavigne is a scamp. The word suits him admirably, and
he it.</p>
<p>He is not a rascal, a rogue, a scoundrel, or a blackguard, by
any means, much less a criminal. He is a scamp, a
<i>chenapan;</i> wicked, lovable, amusing--a graceless
detrimental, or rather a graceful detrimental, for, like so many
of these deplorably charming ne'er-do-wells, he is extremely
handsome, almost faultless of face and figure.</p>
<p>The other day Henri gave us a full, true, and particular
account of how he came to be in the Legion. At least, he said it
was true, and it certainly was full and particular.</p>
<p>Fortunately his listeners were also full--and not
particular.</p>
<p>Edited and expurgated, Henri Delavigne's story may be
reconstructed as follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Very extraordinary conduct!" remarked Madame Dartois to her
husband, as they entered the empty drawing-room of The Old
Bungalow, which is in Whereisit, which is by the sea at the back
of beyond in Annam or Tunisia or French Somaliland or
somewhere.</p>
<p>"<i>Étonnant,</i>" agreed Monsieur le Colonel Dartois meekly.
"Sure you haven't mistaken the day, or anything?" he added.</p>
<p>"Guillaume!" ejaculated the outraged lady. "Do I--<i>moi qui
parle</i>--ever make mistakes?"</p>
<p>"No, <i>ma mie</i>," hastily replied Guillaume.</p>
<p>"'Christmas Day at 8.30' was what she wrote to me, a fortnight
ago. And 'Christmas Day at 8.30' I believe to-day is?"</p>
<p>"It is, <i>ma chérie</i>."</p>
<p>"Christmas Dinner to the Garrison and Civil Station--and the
woman not in the house even! I was <i>never</i> so insulted in my
life. Shameful! Disgraceful! Scandalous!"</p>
<p>Madame Dartois' long earrings trembled as her wrath and
indignation waxed. So did her long husband. He knew her temper
and her manners--and he feared a scene when the remiss and errant
hostess did appear.</p>
<p>"Not like the Boirots at all," he observed.</p>
<p>For Monsieur and Madame Boirot had invited all the French
residents of Whereisit to dinner, that Christmas Day, and were
not present to receive them. Not even in the house, according to
the native butler!</p>
<p>Another couple entered--<i>Médecin-Major</i> Luynes, the
portentous Doctor of Whereisit, and his weary wife.</p>
<p><i>Médecin-Major</i> Luynes is one of those "twice-born" who
would have done better to be born once and born well.</p>
<p>"Punctuality is a virtue," he remarked weightily, as he pulled
at his cuffs.</p>
<p>"Wonder what's happened to them," said Colonel Dartois,
greeting the newcomers.</p>
<p>"Procrastination is the thief of time," observed
<i>Médecin-Major</i> Luynes as he smoothed his hair.</p>
<p>"And they, mere civilians of less than ten years' service,"
snorted Madame Dartois. "I don't care if the man <i>is</i> the
District Officer."</p>
<p>"Better late than never," affirmed <i>Médecin-Major</i>
Luynes, tugging at his waistcoat.</p>
<p>"Guillaume, you'll call Monsieur Boirot to account for this,"
said Madame Dartois.</p>
<p>"Certainly, <i>ma belle</i>."</p>
<p>More guests arrived.</p>
<p>At twenty minutes to nine, a dozen people were present,
hungrily awaiting an absent host and hostess.</p>
<p>"I am absolutely certain that we shall find that it is in no
way their fault," said Madame Lebrun, who was as charitable and
kindly as she was beautiful; and added,</p>
<p>"I vote we make a beginning--and an end."</p>
<p>"It is not usual to sit down without one's host and hostess,"
said <i>Médecin-Major</i> Luynes oracularly, and with truth, as
he screwed his moustache.</p>
<p>"No--nor to sit down with them when they aren't there,"
replied Colonel Dartois with equal truth.</p>
<p>"Give them till nine," said Madame Lebrun. "They are sure to
be here by then."</p>
<p>But they were not.</p>
<p>Nor by nine the next evening. Nor the next. Nor by New Year's
Day.</p>
<p>A widely known and greatly respected member of local French
Colonial Society, and his wife--equally well known and
respected--and his camel--even more widely known, but less
respected, had vanished into thin air and disappeared as
completely as if the earth had opened and swallowed them up upon
Christmas Day--after they had invited the whole Station to
dinner.</p>
<p>They had--metaphorically at least--left the children in the
nursery, the horses in the stables, the dog in the kennel, the
cat on the rug, the canary in the cage, the needle in the
unfinished needlework, the unsigned papers and files on the
office-table, and departed without a word to a soul--as though
they wished to insult and flout and annoy the whole Station by a
practical joke in the very worst taste.</p>
<p>They owed no man a sou, had consciences of the clearest,
possessed not an enemy in the world, appeared devoted to their
home, were sane, sound, wholesome, normal people.</p>
<p>And they had vanished, apparently, while a score of hungry
guests irritably wondered what on earth had become of them. Had
they disintegrated, evaporated, spontaneously combusted?</p>
<p>On Boxing Day and the following days, it appeared that no
shipping-office had news of them, no railway-station had seen
them, no wandering Arab or other native knew anything of them or
their camel.</p>
<p>The Police were at fault, the trackers were at fault, the
large rewards were unavailing.</p>
<p>The Boirots and their camel were simply gone. Apparently they
had not left by sea, by rail, or by road; nor were they in
Whereisit, the environs of Whereisit, or the vicinity of
Whereisit.</p>
<p>They had merely ceased to exist, and no longer were.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Madame Boirot and Monsieur Henri Delavigne were friends, birds
of a feather who had flocked together with (so far) the happiest
results. Both were athletic, fond of all sports, lovers of
animals, devoted to the chase in every form, and to the open air
in every kind of weather.</p>
<p>Madame Boirot, who had been christened Poppæa for some reason,
was no beauty; but she was a female athlete, great at tennis,
golf, badminton, swimming, fencing, running, sculling, and could
hold her own across country with anybody on any horse.</p>
<p>With gun, rifle and revolver, she required some beating, and,
<i>mirabile dictu!</i> she could throw a stone or a ball as well
as she could cast a fly.</p>
<p>She should have been named Atlanta or Herculea rather than
Poppæa.</p>
<p>Monsieur Boirot affected to feel a gentle sorrow for all other
men, as he had never met the man whose wife could saddle, bridle,
and groom a horse as well as ride it; take a safe and
distinguished place with the 'guns' as well as feed them; sail a
boat as well as row it; train a hawk as well as fly it; and beat
the average man at the lighter games as well as the average woman
at the duties of the drawing and dining rooms.</p>
<p>Her favourite, if deplorable, way of spending the Sabbath was
to sally forth before dawn with Monsieur Henri Delavigne, and
upon Monsieur Tartarin de Tarascon, with a gun and cartridge-belt
apiece, the tiffin-basket, and a supply of water; and to return
at night with such grouse, partridge, bustard, quail, snipe,
duck, hare or buck as Fate might will.</p>
<p>Monsieur Tartarin de Tarascon was Madame Boirot's camel,
trained and maintained for purposes of shooting. When the
question of naming him had arisen, Madame Boirot had said that
obviously he was Monsieur Tartarin himself, in the
flesh--camel-flesh.</p>
<p>Monsieur Tartarin was unreliable, and, in many ways,
objectionable.</p>
<p>The school-boy who described the camel as 'a beast with a good
heart but bad breath' would have found Tartarin undeserving of
even this limited eulogy. His heart was as bad as his breath, and
though he would do you a good hundred kilometres in a day, and
live for a space on broken gingerbeer-bottles, he did everything
grudgingly and under protest.</p>
<p>He got up with a bubbling growl, and he lay down with a
bubbling growl. With the same he received a blow or a bowl of hot
bran, a rebuke, or a pile of succulent camel-thorn. He would
repay the gift of a generous meal with an attempt to take you by
the neck; and the safest place in his immediate vicinity was on
his back--provided you had his rein and could thwart an attempt
at eating your leg by jerking at his delicate nose.</p>
<p>A lady novelist has written of a Rare and Beautiful-Minded
Camel who 'gurgled with pleasure' at the approach of his master,
and 'knelt proudly to receive him'. Tartarin gurgled without
pleasure at the approach of anybody, and extended his
well-furnished mouth to receive him. And the bite of a camel is
one of the worst bites in the world.</p>
<p>But Tartarin was a most useful beast.</p>
<p>Tartarin was a perfect pantechnicon. Whatever you fancied as a
useful adjunct to an outing on Tartarin, you might take. If to
guns, ammunition, tent, food, water, camera, satchel, and other
impedimenta, you chose to add an arm-chair, a bath, or a
wardrobe, you had only to tie it somewhere on Tartarin. And as he
would stand (or rather kneel) for hours, when you went off on
foot, he made an admirable headquarters.</p>
<p>You could ride him to a place twenty kilometres distant, and
plant him in a chosen spot, as house and home; sally forth on
foot; and return again to him for food, rest and shelter, after
shooting over the adjacent parts of the map.</p>
<p>But you could not safely come in reach of his ugly,
sideways-biting mouth.</p>
<p>Yes. After a week's domesticity, Madame Boirot found it
glorious to get away into the desert on Monsieur Tartarin.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Where shall we go to-morrow, Henri?" asked Madame Boirot on
Christmas Eve. "Let's have 'a day in the country' and get an
appetite for our Christmas dinner."</p>
<p>"I shall be delighted," replied Monsieur Delavigne quite
truthfully. "Let's ride Monsieur Tartarin to the sea--it's only
thirty kilometres--and then prospect for curlew along the shore.
I don't suppose a human being goes there once in a century. We
shall pick up a few sand-grouse on the way, and I hear there's a
bit of grass near the oasis beyond, where we may put up some
quail, and there may be a duck and a wisp of snipe by the water.
Then to the sea for a curlew--I have never bagged one yet, though
I have heard they are to be found along the shore. I want to
stuff and mount a good one, with about two feet of bill."</p>
<p>"Excellent programme, <i>mon garçon</i>," agreed Madame
Boirot. "I'll look out some 'fives' and 'sixes' for my
twenty-bore, and give orders for some appropriate food. Let's get
away before dawn, and see the sun rise in the desert. We can be
back comfortably by the evening."</p>
<p>"Yes, I'll send word round to Ali to bring Monsieur Tartarin
round to my bungalow to-night. Then he'll be here in time in the
morning, anyhow."</p>
<p>At five o'clock on the morrow, Madame Boirot, briefly clad in
shirt, khaki shorts, putties, brown sun-helmet and hob-nailed
boots, emerged from The Old Bungalow and circumspectly approached
Monsieur Tartarin, who, kneeling, chewed the cud of bitter and
resentful recollection.</p>
<p>Near, yet far--far enough for safety--awaited Monsieur Henri
Delavigne, and further still, Ali the Camel-man slept
peacefully.</p>
<p>The gentle application of a toe brought Ali the Camel-man back
from dreams of the houris of Paradise to the realities of
Tartarin of Tarascon, and he bestirred himself to place the large
'Zarles' double saddle-frame on his loudly complaining charge, to
fasten cushions, and to stock saddle-bags, attach folding chairs
and tiffin basket, and festoon the gentle creature with satchels,
cartridge-bags, flasks, camera, field-glasses and other
details.</p>
<p>All being in readiness, Madame Boirot climbed into the rear
seat and sat sideways, with her feet on a board which was slung
to the saddle, and her gun across her lap; then Monsieur Henri
Delavigne, scrambling into the front seat, intimated to Monsieur
Tartarin that the time had come for him to arise and go
thence.</p>
<p>"Does the Presence require this slave?" inquired Ali.</p>
<p>The Presence did not, and the slave returned to his dreams
while, silent as a spectre, the big camel padded out of the
compound and disappeared down the track that led away to the
mysterious limitless desert of sand and sea.</p>
<p>With gun in one hand and nose-rope 'reins' and stick in the
other, Delavigne drove the supercilious and disgusted-looking
animal along, at some eight miles an hour.</p>
<p>He congratulated himself that daylight would find them where
game was to be expected, and that by about nine-thirty, the
drinking time of the sand-grouse, he and his companion would be
ensconced and awaiting them, near the only fresh water--if water
there still were--for miles.</p>
<p>"I do love swaying along in the darkness like this," said
Madame Boirot. "There is nothing else quite like it, when you
can't see the ground, and seem to be neither on earth nor
water."</p>
<p>"We shall be quite sure we're on earth all right, if he trips
over anything, <i>ma chère Poppæa</i>," replied the unpoetic and
shivering male--and conversation languished until a glow of
delicate, silvery grey, slowly turning to shell-pink, defined the
eastern horizon.</p>
<p>"The sun is rising in the east, Henri," said Madame
Boirot.</p>
<p>"Habit it's got," replied her cavalier.</p>
<p>"I do love to see it slowly. . . ."</p>
<p>"I shall be glad to feel it quickly. . . ."</p>
<p>"Poor old Henri, <i>what</i> a miserable cold mortal you are
since that malaria! Have a look into your cognac flask."</p>
<p>"Alcohol, <i>ma chère,</i> gives a meretricious and delusive
sense of warmth, while driving the blood to the surface and
actually lowering the temperature of the whole body," replied
Monsieur Henri Delavigne sententiously. "Yes . . . I think I
will. Shame to abuse good cognac, seeing I lived on it for a
while, after enteric. Good old friend of mine."</p>
<p>"You remind me of poor Colonel Dubord's reply to Zouzou
D'Anton's valedictory advice on the '<i>Massilia</i>'. . . .
'Have a good time at home, Colonel, and avoid the World, the
Flesh and the Devil.'"</p>
<p>"What did Dubord say?"</p>
<p>"He emerged from a large <i>bock</i> and, fixing Zouzou with a
cold and fishy eye, grunted.</p>
<p>"'I'll ask you to speak respectfully of the World, the Flesh
and the Devil, young man--they're the three best friends I've
got!'"</p>
<p>"Don't tell me such shocking things. Dubord's a moral
wreck."</p>
<p>"Better than being an immoral wreck like people who nip brandy
at six a.m. Look! There's the sun."</p>
<p>"You're right, clever woman. It is the sun. Now try to be
silent for five--er--seconds . . . and look around for birds, and
keep a beady eye below for bustard tracks. . . ."</p>
<p>The grey desert turned to gold as the sun crept higher, the
horizon widened, and, in a few minutes, the cold night had
changed to hot day.</p>
<p>Suddenly Delavigne drew rein, and brought Monsieur Tartarin
from a long swaying trot to a stately walk, and then to a
standstill.</p>
<p>Both riders sat motionless as, without turning his head,
Delavigne whispered,</p>
<p>"Five grouse, fifty yards left front, Pop, see them?"</p>
<p>"No. Wait a bit. No. Yes! By the hillock."</p>
<p>"That's it. Your go. I'll put Tartarin down on the far
side."</p>
<p>A circular detour soon brought Tartarin and his riders to a
point on the far side of the big mound of sand, so curiously
wind-wave marked.</p>
<p>Here seductive whisperings and downward tugs of the reins
induced the camel to drop on his knees, and laboriously settle
down in the kneeling position that enabled Madame Boirot to
descend from his back.</p>
<p>Slipping cartridges into her gun, she started off in the
direction of the sleeping birds, leaving her companion seated on
Tartarin, but ready for a shot if the grouse flew over.</p>
<p>With gun well forward, she slowly approached the birds.</p>
<p>A cluck, a whirr of wings, and they were in flight with
surprising celerity. Madame Boirot did not act as so many
lady-shots would have done in like circumstances, and fire both
barrels into the 'brown' when the birds rose.</p>
<p>Letting them rise and settle into steady flight, she chose the
nearest and gave him the right barrel, bringing him down
stone-dead. With the left she aimed at two, flying one behind the
other, in a straight line with herself, fired, and saw one fall
in a cloud of feathers, and the other slant to the earth.</p>
<p>A howl of joy from her cavalier brought a flush of pleasure to
her cheek.</p>
<p>On reaching the third bird, she was relieved to find it dead.
A wounded and living bird or animal spoilt her day
completely.</p>
<p>Tying the three birds to a cord of the saddle-frame, Delavigne
observed that a hundred and fifty per cent of kills was
tolerablish shooting. . . .</p>
<p>The loudly protesting Tartarin was soon under way once more,
his haughty nose being turned in the direction of the distant
oasis pool.</p>
<p>Shadows shortened, gun-barrels became uncomfortably hot to the
touch, thoughts turned to shade and drinks; but the eyes of the
riders scanned the terrain for game and tracks of game, rather
than the horizon for the first glimpse of the palms of the
oasis.</p>
<p>"Look!" said Madame Boirot, pointing over Delavigne's
shoulder. "What is he stalking? Pull up."</p>
<p>Tartarin's driver tautened the nose-rope and looked in the
direction indicated by his companion's finger.</p>
<p>In a few moments, he caught sight of a jackal creeping along
behind the ridge of a sand-hill, and, from time to time, stopping
to look cautiously over it. His behaviour made it evident that
he, too, was hunting. At the end of the ridge he flattened
himself to the ground and lay, a picture of concentration,
expectation and watchfulness, perfectly motionless save for the
tip of his bushy tail, which moved rhythmically to and fro.</p>
<p>"Wonder what he is after," whispered Delavigne.</p>
<p>"More grouse, I expect."</p>
<p>"Yes. Let's ride straight to him, and see," replied Madame
Boirot.</p>
<p>As the silent-footed camel approached, the unconscious jackal,
after apparently making himself smaller and flatter for a minute,
suddenly sprang forward, and, as he disappeared over the side of
the ridge, two large grey birds slowly flapped into the air and
rose heavily in widening circles.</p>
<p>It was Delavigne's turn, and bustard are not easy to miss. A
left and right brought the pair crashing to the ground, and sent
the shocked and grieved jackal fleeing far to healthier
parts.</p>
<p>"<i>Outarde!</i> What luck! Well shot, Henri!" cried Madame
Boirot.</p>
<p>"Well, I couldn't miss them if I tried. Not with my eyes shut,
could I?" was the reply.</p>
<p>"Yes. Monsieur Tartarin simply breathed with all his might,
and I could see your gun sway as you aimed. It isn't everybody
who could hit a hay-stack from a camel. Especially from such an
unobliging pig as Monsieur Tartarin."</p>
<p>"Must train him better," said Delavigne. "Impress on him
'Breathing to be restrained while in the act of firing'--that is,
while we are in the act of firing, <i>bien entendu</i>."</p>
<p>"That's it, Henri. . . . <i>Mon Dieu,</i> I believe two
<i>outardes,</i> left and right from a camel, is a record
hereabouts. They're getting awfully scarce. Best meat in the
world."</p>
<p>"But yes. Of a tenderness. It's a marvel to me how one of them
survives a season--big and clumsy as they are--with panther,
wolves, foxes, wild dogs, jackals, snakes, hawks and humans on
their track."</p>
<p>"Let's go and collect a few duck, snipe and grouse now, and
make the local record bag."</p>
<p>"We will. But how sadly our average is falling, Pop! We're
only a hundred and twenty-five per cent now, although we've
missed nothing. Rotten!"</p>
<p>"You are enough to turn the gods sulky, Henri. Five birds to
four cartridges, and you grumble!"</p>
<p>"I am not grumbling at the five birds to four cartridges, but
at the fact that our average is falling without our making a
miss. <i>Nom du diable!</i> Why should it go down through no
fault of ours? The more hundred per cent shooting we do, the more
it will fall, till from being a hundred and fifty per cent it
will be a hundred-decimal-something per cent. Low, I call
it."</p>
<p>"It's the way of the world and mathematics, I suppose. Bear
up, <i>mon Henri,</i>" murmured Poppæa.</p>
<p>Once more the sour misanthropist was set in motion, and,
strictly under protest, settled into his long swinging stride,
the dangling bustard apparently consenting with nods of their
fantastically swaying heads.</p>
<p>"Get up and run, you little fool," said Delavigne suddenly,
leaning over and apparently apostrophizing the earth, as the
track wound round the base of a hill.</p>
<p>Turning and craning over to her right, Madame Boirot saw a
large hare crouching motionless, with its head in a tussock of
coarse grass and its body completely exposed.</p>
<p>"Throw a cartridge at him," said she.</p>
<p>Taking a careful aim, Delavigne dropped a cartridge on to the
self-deceiver and, a second later, the latter was in full flight,
tearing away up the hill-side, as hares invariably do, provided
there is a hill-side handy.</p>
<p>"I'll give him forty metres and the choke-bore," said Madame
Boirot.</p>
<p>She did, and Puss, turning a couple of somersaults, kicked his
last and lay still.</p>
<p>"Good girl," said her approving Henri. "Dead as
a--corpse."</p>
<p>The hare joined the bustard and their <i>danse macabre,</i>
and Delavigne bemoaned the fact that their shooting average was
now only a hundred and twenty per cent instead of a hundred and
twenty-five, and that it was one of Life's little ironies and a
sling or arrow, whichever you liked, of outrageous Fortune.</p>
<p>"Behold the oasis," said he suddenly, as a clump of palms
broke the level line of the far horizon.</p>
<p>"<i>Bon!</i>" said Madame Boirot. "We shall get there in time
to clear up the duck and snipe, and to lie up for the grouse as
they come to drink. . . . Give old Tartarin a prod."</p>
<p>Delavigne flourished his stick, and emitted a loud howl,
Monsieur Tartarin gave a bound forward, rolled an eye, emitted a
bubbling growl, and commenced to protrude a sample of his many
stomachs from the corner of his mouth.</p>
<p>"If he's going to hang some of his interior out to dry, I
shall give up," said the driver; "I am delicate before
breakfast."</p>
<p>"Oh, good Monsieur Tartarin, don't lay the matter before us,"
implored the passenger.</p>
<p>But Monsieur Tartarin was obdurate, and ere long, much that
was inner became outer, and that which had lain in darkness was
brought to light. Camels have no finer feelings, no thought for
others, no gentility of soul, and therefore no manners.</p>
<p>"Take no notice and he'll withdraw the proposition," said
Delavigne. "He's like the agitator politician, only happy when
noisy and offensive, and as anxious for notice as a
<i>Maire</i>."</p>
<p>"We'd better drop him well away from the pool, or we shan't
find much duck when we get there," suggested Madame Boirot.</p>
<p>"Yes, we'll give him quarter of a kilometre or so--if you
think you are really equal to a quarter of a kilometre over this
deep fine sand, to the grass and palms. It's most terribly
difficult going, you know."</p>
<p>"A kilometre, <i>mon enfant,</i>" was the confident reply.</p>
<p>Monsieur Tartarin, having been made to kneel, his driver
descended and tied the long nose-rope to the stump of a
thorn-bush.</p>
<p>"Come along then, Pop," said he, "bring the glasses," and as
Poppæa hummed an air, continued, "And don't make those disgusting
noises, <i>ma chérie.</i> You're worse than Tartarin. . . . This
time in the morning too! . . . I don't want to find all the duck
dead--or gone. . . ."</p>
<p>"If they're gone we shan't find them," was Poppæa's mild
reply, "and if they're dead we shan't have to shoot them. . .
."</p>
<p>Ten minutes of really hard labour, tramping over hillocks of
fine wind-drifted sand, brought the pair, exhausted, to a clump
of stunted palms whence the pool could be swept with
field-glasses, its reed-and-islet-broken surface searched, and
its muddy beast-trodden marge examined.</p>
<p>"Duck!" whispered Delavigne. . . . "No, they're not, though. .
. . Those beastly long-necked cormoran things . . . and some
silly <i>foulques. . . .</i> Yes, wait a minute, there's a nice
little breakfast-party of duck at the far end. . . . Have a
look."</p>
<p>Madame Boirot adjusted the glasses and scanned the lake.</p>
<p>"Yes, about seven--mallard; and those <i>foulque</i> might be
teal, I do believe."</p>
<p>Crouching and creeping, the stalkers left the palms and
followed the little valleys between the low sandhills and then
reappeared at the other end of the pool.</p>
<p>With extreme caution, on hands and knees, they traversed the
little belt of lye-bush, and finally reached a spot where, hidden
themselves, they could have shot the duck sitting, or rather
floating.</p>
<p>"Ready, Pop? Rise with me, and get what you can. . . . I'll
take the drake and that grey-brown beggar beside him. . . .
Up!"</p>
<p>They rose together and the duck with them.</p>
<p><i>Bang! . . . Bang! . . .</i> went Delavigne's twelve-bore,
and two birds splashed into the water.</p>
<p><i>Crack! . . . Crack! . . .</i> went his companion's
twenty-bore, and two more joined them without a kick or a
flutter. A few feathers floated on the bosom of the lake, from
which rose a variety of aquatic waders and swimmers of non-game
species.</p>
<p>Flying at a height of about a hundred yards, the survivors of
the band of duck wheeled round in a great circle and slanted down
from a furlong distance toward the pool, on a line that would
bring them straight over the hidden foe, at thirty yards
elevation.</p>
<p>"Now!" said Delavigne.</p>
<p>Again he and Poppæa rose and threw forward their guns.</p>
<p>But duck, whistling down the wind toward one, present a
different target from that offered by duck rising and flying away
from one--and Delavigne fired too soon with his right barrel and
too late with his left.</p>
<p>Madame Boirot, more patient, careful and judgmatical, allowed
beautifully for pace and angle, and brought her first bird almost
to her feet, and her second into the water.</p>
<p>"Sorry, <i>mon cher</i>," she cried, with a merry laugh.</p>
<p>"Sufficient grounds for a--divorce," growled her lover,
snapping out his cartridge-cases, and re-loading.</p>
<p>"Perhaps they were bad cartridges," suggested the wily
woman.</p>
<p>"Yes--or perhaps the two birds I didn't hit were so old and
tough that the 'number fours' with which I missed them
rebounded," was the reply.</p>
<p>Quarter of an hour later the pair were dealing faithfully with
such quail as they could put up from the adjacent
grass-patch.</p>
<p>And similarly, later, with the thirsty grouse that began to
arrive at the pool.</p>
<p>"And now for some breakfast," quoth Delavigne when sport
slackened, "and then for the sea and some curlew, if we're lucky.
. . . I hope you've brought stacks of food and gallons of wine.
I'm fading . . . wasting away, dying--darling. . . ."</p>
<p>In the shade of a clump of palms, Madame Boirot spread their
Christmas breakfast, laying out a spotless white cloth, and
adorning it with a cold chicken, sandwiches, eggs, a yard of
bread, a cucumber, tomatoes, tinned butter, tinned fish, tinned
jam, tinned milk, tinned biscuits, tinned cake, tinned fruit, and
a large bottle of wine, as well as dainty coffee-cups, glass and
cutlery--the whole a curious note of civilization and refinement
in that lonely desert wilderness.</p>
<p>After breakfast, Delavigne lit a cigarette and stretched
himself luxuriously on the sand, while his companion boiled more
water in the spirit-kettle, for washing-up.</p>
<p>"I wish you'd take to tobacco, Pop," said he, lazily watching
her in supreme contentment; "a cigarette after a
shooting-breakfast is one of the great things of life. . . . To
have missed it is not to have lived, or to not have lived, or to
have not lived, whichever you like. . . . Besides, it would
soothe your angry passions and make you a better and a . . .</p>
<p>"<i>Hi! . . .</i> <i>Help! . . .</i> Confound that foul,
infernal, damnable, filthy, god-forsaken brute of a camel--look
at him," he suddenly yelled, springing to his feet and pointing
to where, in the distance, the faithful Tartarin was making good
time on the homeward journey.</p>
<p>"He's a conscientious objector to work on Christmas Day, no
doubt," observed Poppæa.</p>
<p>"And there's twenty miles of fine, loose, deep, powdery sand
between here and home," added Delavigne, as he snatched his stick
and started off, "and not a human being nearer. . . . I wish he'd
trip on his nose-rope and break his blasted neck. . . ."</p>
<p>Madame Boirot withheld valedictory remarks anent cigarettes
and the soothing of angry passions, for this was no joke.</p>
<p>Or was it?</p>
<p>She certainly could not do twenty miles, nor two, over that
treacherous, soft, almost impalpable dust. . . . And the best to
be hoped for was a run for poor old Henri under a burning sun,
just after a heavy morning's work. . . . It was enough to give
him apoplexy, sunstroke, and all kinds of collapse, poor boy. . .
. Dear boy. . . . Darling boy.</p>
<p>Suppose he failed to catch the brute--what <i>should</i> they
do?</p>
<p>Suppose Henri dropped suddenly with heat-stroke!</p>
<p>Ah! The wretched beast was turning aside to browse on some
thorn-bush. If Henri had the sense of a guinea-pig now, he'd
stalk him instead of chasing over that red hot sand, as fine as
flour, and yards in depth.</p>
<p>Ah--again! . . . Henri had dropped flat and was crawling
between the sand-hills. . . . He must be simply suffocating and
choking, poor darling boy. . . .</p>
<p>What a Christmas if they were stranded there! . . .</p>
<p>The errant Tartarin browsed, and Madame Boirot lost sight of
her <i>bon ami</i> until he suddenly arose on the far side of the
thorn-bushes and made a swift dash for the wanderer, ran beside
him as he fled, seized his trailing nose-rope and brought him to
anchor. . . .</p>
<p>"Shall I cut his cursed throat or blow his beastly brains
out?" panted Henri on his return.</p>
<p>"Better wait till we're home again," was the reply, "or we
shall only be cutting off our retreat to spite our camel, as it
were.</p>
<p>"What about that tip in the Koran?" she continued: "<i>Put all
thy trust in Allah</i>--<i>but tie up thy camel thyself,</i> eh,
my Henry?"</p>
<p>"<i>Tais-toi, ma gosse</i>," replied Henri with a gross
familiarity--his punishment a smile.</p>
<p>"Well, have another cigarette, <i>mon gars,</i> anyhow; it
will soothe your angry passions and make you a better and a . .
." observed Madame Boirot--her punishment a kiss. . . .</p>
<p>Anon the journey was resumed, and Tartarin's rider neither
spared the rod nor spoiled the camel.</p>
<p>"<i>Thalatta!</i>" cried Delavigne suddenly, half an hour
later, as the horizon shone white for a moment, where the sun
caught the long low line of a breaking wave.</p>
<p>Soon the sand grew cleaner, harder and whiter, and produced a
sparse outcrop of round-stemmed bents; the wind had a salty tang;
a rust-marked log, once part of some ship, stood forlorn; desert
turned to dunes, and the travellers reached low cliffs of
sand-strewn earth and rock that, with an expanse of wet and
shining beach, separated land from sea.</p>
<p>Ahead, as far as the glass-aided eye could see, stretched the
same monotonous expanse, unbroken. . . . Sand, sea, sky--sky,
sea, sand.</p>
<p>For an hour they jogged along the low cliffs, a few yards
above the shell-strewn beach, till, cutting across the neck of a
promontory, a new vista of beach was revealed, and with it, a
most delightful sight.</p>
<p>"Down; quick! Henri," whispered Madame Boirot, and Monsieur
Tartarin was brought somewhat hastily to earth.</p>
<p>"It's like going to the good old <i>Jardin des Plantes</i> for
a Christmas treat again, isn't it?" she continued, "and standing
outside the 'Aquatic Birds Enclosure'."</p>
<p>"Quite," agreed her Henri, and placed a large stone on the end
of Tartarin's nose-rope. "Come on" . . . and the two crept,
crouching, to the low cliff edge and gazed upon a remarkable
assembly.</p>
<p>A group of snowy white pelicans preened their feathers, yawned
with huge cavernous pouched bills, or waddled solemnly about.</p>
<p>Near them straddled and squatted a company of beautiful,
rose-tinted, red-legged flamingoes, writhing snake-like necks
into marvellous contortions, and looking with their high-bridged
haughty beaks like a gathering of <i>ancien régime</i> Marquises
and Duchesses, self-consciously exclusive and proud.</p>
<p>In marked contrast was a flock of big, squat and vulgar
sea-birds, goose-like in form, and plebeian in behaviour.</p>
<p>A big band of solemn, silly spoon-bills looked down their
quaint noses, and reminded the hidden onlookers of wise fools and
dull philosophers; while here and there strode a secretive
martinet-looking adjudant-bird in black and white uniform.</p>
<p>A few great grey storks stalked majestic, while delicate
little cranes craned slender necks over pool and rivulet. Small
sea-gulls of a dozen different species and colours basked in
groups, each after his kind.</p>
<p>"There must be fresh water hereabouts, for there to be such a
mixed crew of sea-farers and land-lubbers," said Delavigne at
last. "Not a game-bird among them though. . . . Not a swan, duck,
snipe or curlew."</p>
<p>"No," agreed Madame Boirot, "and it would be a shame to shoot.
. . . I should like to see them all fly though. Let's just ride
toward them slowly--there is a way down, just along there. . .
."</p>
<p>A few minutes later, Tartarin's feet were padding the sands of
the beach, and the birds, with discordant cries and ungainly
hopping runs, rose in a cloud, and flying, fled septemvious.</p>
<p>Poppæa and Henri gazed in admiration, while the face of
Monsieur Tartarin wore a malignant supercilious sneer.</p>
<p>"And now what?" asked the lady, as the cloud of birds thinned
and disappeared.</p>
<p>"Back to the oasis and a <i>siesta</i> in the shade of the
palms," suggested Henri.</p>
<p>"And home in the cool of the evening, eh?" agreed Poppæa.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">§ 2</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Let Delavigne himself conclude his tale:--</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And later on in the oasis we composed ourselves.</p>
<p>Later still--how much later I know not--I awoke.</p>
<p>I yawned. I stretched myself. My thoughts turned to food and
drink. My eyes turned to the rustling palm-fronds above me, and
then to Poppæa beside me.</p>
<p>She was sleeping like a little child.</p>
<p>Or perhaps not sleeping like a little child. Nor like a little
devil. Not sleeping at all, probably. I know not.</p>
<p>I sat up and looked at the inviting table equipage, lacking in
nothing but the table.</p>
<p>I then looked at Monsieur Tartarin, the thrice-accursed
camel.</p>
<p>I did not look at Monsieur Tartarin, the thrice-accursed
camel--for he was not there.</p>
<p>I rubbed my eyes.</p>
<p>That did not bring him back.</p>
<p>Definitely he was not there.</p>
<p>Amazed, bewildered, incredulous, I rose to my feet and strode
to the spot where he had been: where he was not: whence he had
departed.</p>
<p>Why did I do this?</p>
<p>Was it to see whether that Son of Sin and Father of Sorrow was
hiding under a leaf of the bush to which I had tied him?</p>
<p>I know not.</p>
<p>But it is a sort of human instinct to do such things, as
witness the way in which one will repeatedly search the pockets
which one knows to be empty; and again and again open a ravished
box as though to assure oneself that the stolen treasure has not
miraculously materialized within it.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I hurried to the bush, a shrub so small that it would
not have concealed a reclining goat, much less an unusually
enormous camel.</p>
<p>Of course, Tartarin was not there. I knew he was not
there.</p>
<p>No, but something else was; something the sight of which
caused my heart to stand still.</p>
<p>A cold hand seemed to be laid upon that so-warm young heart;
to seize it, to grip it, to hold it in suspended painful
animation--if animated it were.</p>
<p>What did I behold?</p>
<p>I will tell you.</p>
<p>A small portion of the nose-cord of the accursed camel, a
small portion still firmly tied and skilfully knotted about the
tough stem of the bush.</p>
<p>Broken?</p>
<p>Oh, but no. A thousand times no. No camel in this world ever
broke its nose-cord. Far too painful an operation.</p>
<p>It is because the nose of the camel is extremely tender that
one can ride and guide it exactly as one does a horse, and with
but the slightest little-finger pressure upon the nose cord
rein.</p>
<p>Why, one has only to make a camel kneel, throw the cord-rein
over its head on to the ground and lay one's camel-stick on it,
for the camel to remain anchored, <i>planté là</i> indefinitely,
eternally.</p>
<p>It was only because I'd failed to do this that the brute had
already run away once, that day. And that was why I had taken no
risks the second time.</p>
<p>Not content with merely putting the rein on the ground with a
stick or a stone laid on it, I had, as I have said, tied the rein
firmly to the trunk of the young tree--tied it as though the
camel had been a boat and the sand, upon which he knelt, a
swift-running stream.</p>
<p>Broken?</p>
<p>That strong cord that would have held a plunging horse?</p>
<p>No. It had been <i>cut</i>.</p>
<p>I untied the piece of cord and examined the ends. They were
flat, unfrayed . . . cut, as I had expected.</p>
<p>And why did this cold fear paralyse me with its mortal
chill?</p>
<p>Because there wasn't a human habitation for twenty miles, nor
a human being.</p>
<p>Water in those parts was plentiful, oases numerous, a river
not far distant. The sand, soft, fine and loose as flour,
prohibited cultivation, and there was nothing whatsoever to
attract anyone save the rare occasional sportsmen, like
ourselves, from the Station.</p>
<p>You still do not see why I was terror-stricken?</p>
<p>That cord had been cut by human agency, had it not?</p>
<p>It had been cut, then, by one of the only two people
there.</p>
<p>I had not cut it.</p>
<p>Who had then?</p>
<p>Madame . . . As you say.</p>
<p>Yes. Madame Boirot had cut the cord because her fingers had
not the strength or skill to untie my knots.</p>
<p>She had then doubtless urged the camel to its feet and dealt
it a mighty blow with the big cane which lay beside it. . . .
Possibly a rain of blows . . . until the brute had fled for his
life from the abominable woman who thus assailed him.</p>
<p>Sorely was I tempted to follow his example. But alas, I am not
a camel--though certain Sergeants have seemed to doubt it.</p>
<p>I am not a camel and I cannot flee like one across miles of
steeply sloping little mountain ranges of fine dust. . . .</p>
<p>Trapped! . . .</p>
<p>Trapped by Poppæa Boirot.</p>
<p>Compromised. . . . Ruined. . . .</p>
<p>I should be out with her all night.</p>
<p>All night, do I say! More likely a week--or a month.</p>
<p>And that damned camel would go straight back to the Station
with neatly cut reins for evidence.</p>
<p>And who would believe that I had not cut them and driven the
beast off; I, the ravisher who had been fool enough to forget
that the cut reins would give me away, and prove that the affair
was no accident?</p>
<p>Thus would they argue.</p>
<p>I thought of old Boirot, the District Officer--my chief, the
husband of Poppæa and the master of my destiny. In his hands lay
my future, my career.</p>
<p>And I, his subordinate, his assistant, would be the villain
who, with plausible and specious talk of a shooting-trip, had
taken his wife out for the day and kept her out--for the night. .
. . Half-a-dozen nights, probably.</p>
<p>He'd divorce her, of course. . . . Jump at the chance. . . .
Positively leap. . . .</p>
<p>Poppæa! I should have liked to do unto her stout and sunburnt
neck as she had done to the camel-cord.</p>
<p>Oh, fool! . . . Fool that I had been, to make love to this
abominable woman, in the interests of my career!</p>
<p>At least, it had turned out badly, anyhow; laudable,
admirable, and sensible as the idea itself may have been.</p>
<p>Suddenly I turned from my contemplation of the horizon--over
which the camel had long since disappeared--and glanced at
Poppæa, lying some fifty yards away beneath the palms.</p>
<p>As I did so, I swear I saw her head flop suddenly back upon
the rug.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when I reached her side, she was still sound
asleep.</p>
<p>I gazed upon her brick-red countenance, both in sorrow and in
anger.</p>
<p>I had compromised her--and would have to marry her, eh?</p>
<p>"I won't, my love," I said aloud. "I won't. <i>Par Dieu,</i> I
won't. . . . No. Nothing on earth shall induce me to do it. I'd
die sooner. . . ."</p>
<p>"Sooner than do what, Henri?" asked Poppæa, suddenly opening
her eyes.</p>
<p>"Sooner than desert you, <i>chérie</i>," I replied, for Poppæa
was a formidable woman when roused.</p>
<p>"Desert me, Henri? What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"You will be amazed and astounded, as well as alarmed and
horrified," I replied, "to learn that Monsieur Tartarin
has--er--run away."</p>
<p>"<i>Runaway?</i> How did he get free? How could he? I thought
you tied him to a bush over there somewhere."</p>
<p>"I did," I replied.</p>
<p>"Then how has he got loose?"</p>
<p>"He--er--deliberately ate his nose-rein."</p>
<p>"Ate it?"</p>
<p>"Well, bit through it. Bit through both reins--close up to the
stem of the bush."</p>
<p>"The brute, Henri!"</p>
<p>"Yes, the dirty dog, Poppæa!"</p>
<p>"What are we to do, <i>mon Henri</i>?"</p>
<p>"<i>Le bon Dieu</i> knows, my Poppæa. It would take you a week
to wade that twenty miles of deep yielding dust, Poppæa.</p>
<p>"And it would take me a month to carry you," I added.</p>
<p>"We are marooned at this oasis with an uncrossable sea of sand
on one side, and the ocean on the other."</p>
<p>Poppæa rose to her feet, cast herself upon my bosom, and her
arms about my neck.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The sun went down and the stars came out.</p>
<p>"You told no one where we were going, did you, Henri?"</p>
<p>"No, Poppæa. Did you?"</p>
<p>"No, Henri."</p>
<p>"I suppose not, Poppæa."</p>
<p>"What do you mean, Henri?"</p>
<p>"Well--er--your husband never asks, does he?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Don't you think we'd better make a start, now the sun has
set, Poppæa? We could get a few miles in the direction of home,
before you became too exhausted to go any further."</p>
<p>"And to-morrow? With no shelter from the sun, no food, no
water? . . ."</p>
<p>"We could carry some water and some of these birds. . . ."</p>
<p>"And eat them raw? Have we fuel . . . have we cooking
utensils? Besides, how should we find our way in the darkness?
No, Henri. I do not desire to wander in that terrible desert
until we go mad and die of hunger and of thirst."</p>
<p>We fell silent.</p>
<p>"I have it, Poppæa," said I suddenly. "I know. I'll set off
now with the water-bottle and a brace of grouse. I'll go and get
help."</p>
<p>"And leave me here alone?" cried Poppæa. "Henri, you surprise
me. You would abandon me here to be murdered?"</p>
<p>"By whom?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I know not . . . it matters not. . . . You would not leave me
here to die? Suppose you never reached the Station. . . . Suppose
you died of exhaustion and sun-stroke . . . or lost yourself in
that terrible desert, as inevitably you would do? No, no, my dear
one, let us at least die together. . . ."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We did not die together.</p>
<p>We did not die separately.</p>
<p>On the third day, December the twenty-seventh, a <i>dhow</i>
was beached at the spot where we had seen the flamingoes,
pelicans and other birds.</p>
<p>The rascally owner of the <i>dhow</i> said he had come ashore
for fresh water.</p>
<p>I did not contradict him in front of Poppæa, but I thought it
remarkable that he should have come straight to that particular
oasis in search of fresh water, and without any visible means of
support for the water--no goat-skin, water-bag, gourd, barrel, or
<i>fantasse.</i></p>
<p>"What are you going to carry the water in?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Us," grinned the Arab.</p>
<p>And he and his fellow-pirates drank.</p>
<p>I fear Poppæa thought me a little ungracious to our
preserver.</p>
<p>But there was a certain lack of, <i>je ne sais quoi,</i>
spontaneity perhaps, about our preservation. It looked too much
like a put-up job. And I can tell you, <i>mes amis,</i> that I
was not a happy man, as I contemplated my coming interview with
Papa Boirot.</p>
<p>For we had been 'absent without leave' for three days, and it
would take us another three to get back by sea, what with the
voyage to the nearest port, and camel-transport thence to the
Station.</p>
<p>A nice thing if Papa Boirot took it into his head to commit a
<i>crime passionel</i>!</p>
<p>It would be just like the old fool, I sadly reflected, to be
waiting for us with a gun--and kill two birds with one barrel, as
we walked in at the door of the bungalow.</p>
<p>It would be just like that purple pig of a Boirot to rid
himself of his Poppæa and advertise himself as a man of spirit,
at one fell swoop, and before I could shout,</p>
<p>"I don't want your Poppæa--wouldn't have her at a gift."</p>
<p>The one gleam of comfort, and that but a cold one, was the
thought that if he killed me, I should be dead.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I would enter that accursed bungalow behind
Poppæa--one should always give a lady precedence--and surely she
was tough enough to stop the first bullet completely, in which
case I should be gone before he could fire the second.</p>
<p>Gone for help, <i>bien entendu.</i> Others should overpower
and secure the madman.</p>
<p>Just as I was thinking thus, Poppæa, who was riding behind me,
on the camel I had hired at the port, broke in upon my
reflections.</p>
<p>"Cheer up, <i>mon ami</i>," she said, embracing me about the
waist. "Why so silent? The worst he can do is to make a scene
now, and divorce me as soon as possible. . . . You are not afraid
of that little fat man? . . . No, no, forgive me, I did not mean
that. . . . You are afraid he will not divorce me, but he will,
he <i>shall</i>."</p>
<p>And Poppæa gave me another squeeze.</p>
<p>My stomach was very empty, and that sudden contraction of her
powerful arms almost had disastrous results. Or was it her
promise that Monsieur Boirot would certainly divorce her?</p>
<p>How much quicker, easier, and cheaper, for him to shoot
her!</p>
<p>Even as I sadly pondered the possibility of pointing this out
to Monsieur Boirot, we sighted the Old Bungalow, and, a few
minutes later, the camel on which Poppæa and I were riding,
entered the compound.</p>
<p>Now for it.</p>
<p>Bringing the camel to its knees, I dismounted, helped Poppæa
to alight, and led the way to the front door, on the steps of
which squatted a uniformed <i>rekass</i> of Monsieur Boirot's
retinue.</p>
<p>Rising, he salaamed, and opened the lattice-door that gave
access to the wide verandah.</p>
<p>Stepping courteously aside, that Poppæa might precede me, I
placed myself exactly behind her and followed her into the house
. . . and into the drawing-room . . . and into the dining-room .
. . and into the office-room in which Monsieur Boirot did much of
his work . . . and into the little room, sacred to Monsieur
Boirot, where he kept his riding-boots, guns, and such
impedimenta, smoked his cigars and took his <i>siesta. . .
.</i></p>
<p>"Courage, <i>mon ami</i>," whispered Poppæa.</p>
<p>But the house was very still, sinister, and boding. The place
was silent and aware.</p>
<p>Where was the waiting Boirot?</p>
<p>Where was he lurking?</p>
<p>Where, pistol in hand, was the outraged, ferocious, vengeful
Boirot? . . .</p>
<p>"Upstairs," whispered Poppæa.</p>
<p>"I don't like to," said I, very truthfully.</p>
<p>"Come along, Henri. . . ."</p>
<p>"I have a delicacy," I began.</p>
<p>"Well, don't," interrupted Poppæa.</p>
<p>"Don't come?" I asked.</p>
<p>"No, don't have a delicacy. . . . A little late in the day. .
. ."</p>
<p>"<i>Bon Dieu!</i>" cried I suddenly, and leapt round as though
I had indeed been shot.</p>
<p>I had heard a sound . . . a footstep. . . .</p>
<p>And I had no pistol.</p>
<p>I regretted my gun, reposing in its case on the back of the
camel.</p>
<p>But one cannot walk into the bungalow of one's Chief, creeping
behind a loaded double-barrelled gun, as though one were stalking
a tiger.</p>
<p>A bead curtain was drawn aside and a man entered the hall.</p>
<p>It was not Boirot.</p>
<p>It was the native <i>major-domo,</i> bearing a letter.</p>
<p>My heart resumed its task of beating, and I breathed
again.</p>
<p>Salaaming low, the man presented the letter to Poppæa.</p>
<p>Snatching the letter from the man, Poppæa opened it with
fumbling fingers.</p>
<p>"Quick," I breathed. If Boirot had written to forbid her the
house, I was going while the going was good, <i>pronto. . .
.</i></p>
<p>I saw Poppæa's face harden. Almost, it paled. Certainly it
looked very ugly.</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" she cried. "<i>What? . . ."</i></p>
<p>"Well, what?" I begged, almost dancing with anxiety and
terror.</p>
<p>"The <i>scélérat! . . .</i> The brute! . . . The cur! . . .
The scoundrel! . . . The treacherous snake! . . . The low, base,
mean, deceitful hound!"</p>
<p>"Who? . . . Who? . . ." I yelped.</p>
<p>"This Boirot creature. This thing I married. This viper I have
cherished . . . and whom I trusted so."</p>
<p>"Why, what . . . what's he done?"</p>
<p>"Run away! Gone off! Eloped with that vile half-caste girl of
Raphaëlle's."</p>
<p>"Name of a Name of a Name . . ." I cried.</p>
<p>Here was a blow indeed! . . .</p>
<p>"But how long did he wait?" I asked. "We've only been gone a
week. How did he know we hadn't some perfectly good excuse? How
did he know we hadn't met with an accident?"</p>
<p>"How long did he <i>wait</i>?" screamed Poppæa. . . .
"<i>Wait? Wait,</i> did you say? He didn't wait at all, the
dastardly, treacherous, useless yellow-belly! He went an hour
after we did! Look!"</p>
<p>And Poppæa thrust the letter at me.</p>
<p>With shaking hands I took it and read,</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"DEAREST POPPÆA,<br>
<br>
When you get this I shall be far away, and for many days shall be
getting ever farther from you--please God.<br>
<br>
I leave you my blessing, Poppæa, and very little else, save my
forgiveness and the earnest wish that you may be happy with your
Henri.<br>
<br>
He loves you from the bottom of his heart. I heard him say so. He
kisses you with an ardour and fervour which prove it. I have seen
him.<br>
<br>
I even hope you'll be as happy with him as I shall be with
Bobo.<br>
<br>
<i>Faites-lui mes amitiés.</i> Express to him my most
distinguished consideration and sentiments, my admiration, my
congratulations, my felicitations.<br>
<br>
As ever--nay, more than ever--</blockquote>
<blockquote style="text-align:right;">Your         <br>
<br>
PÉPÉ."</blockquote>
<p> </p>

<p>"When did the Master give you this letter?" asked Poppæa, in a
voice of ice.</p>
<p>"On Christmas Eve, Madame," replied the man, "with strict
instructions to give it to Madame just before dinner on Christmas
Day. . . . But how could I do, Madame, when Madame was not
here?"</p>
<p>"Go," replied Madame.</p>
<p>"Henri," she said, turning to me, as the butler disappeared.
"Can such things be? Are such things possible? Do such men
live?</p>
<p>"But he shall not live! He shall die!" she added fiercely.
"You, <i>mon Henri,</i> shall kill him. . . . And then we can be
married. . . ."</p>
<p>Emotion overcame her.</p>
<p>"Oh, <i>mon Henri!</i>" she wept. "That man . . ."</p>
<p>An idea struck me--the idea of a lifetime . . . a ray of light
. . . a beam of sunshine.</p>
<p>A ray, a beam, do I say? It was a glorious flood of brilliant
light.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," I said quickly. "That man. . . . Of course he
shall be punished. I will follow him! At once I will follow him.
Now, this very night, I start. . . ."</p>
<p>Poppæa flung her arms about my neck.</p>
<p>"I will start to-night," I repeated. "I will begin my search
at once . . . I will go <i>now</i>."</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>I'm still searching for him.</p>
<p>Without the loss of an hour, I joined the Foreign Legion.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, he does not appear to be here.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"And what will you do at the end of your five years, if still
you have not found him?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Re-enlist," smiled Henri the Scamp.</p>
<p> </p>
