<h1>THE ISLINGTON MYSTERY</h1>

<h3>by</h3>

<h2>Arthur Machen</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h3>I</h3>

<p>The public taste in murders is often erratic, and sometimes, I
think, fallible enough. Take, for example, that Crippen business. It
happened seventeen years ago, and it is still freshly remembered and
discussed with interest. Yet it was by no means a murder of the first
rank. What was there in it? The outline is crude enough; simple, easy,
and disgusting, as Dr. Johnson observed of another work of art. Crippen
was cursed with a nagging wife of unpleasant habits; and he cherished a
passion for his typist. Whereupon he poisoned Mrs. Crippen, cut her up
and buried the pieces in the coal-cellar. This was well enough, though
elementary; and if the foolish little man had been content to lie quiet
and do nothing, he might have lived and died peaceably. But he must
needs disappear from his house&mdash;the action of a fool&mdash;and
cross the Atlantic with his typist absurdly and obviously disguised as
a boy: sheer, bungling imbecility. Here, surely, there is no single
trace of the master's hand; and yet, as I say, the Crippen Murder is
reckoned amongst the masterpieces. It is the same tale in all the arts:
the low comedian was always sure of a laugh if he cared to tumble over
a pin; and the weakest murderer is sure of a certain amount of
respectful attention if he will take the trouble to dismember his
subject. And then, with respect to Crippen: he was caught by means of
the wireless device, then in its early stages. This, of course, was
utterly irrelevant to the true issue; but the public wallows in
irrelevance. A great art critic may praise a great picture, and make
his criticism a masterpiece in itself. He will be unread; but let some
asinine paragraphist say that the painter always sings "Tom Bowling" as
he sets his palette, and dines on boiled fowl and apricot sauce three
times a week&mdash;then the world will proclaim the artist great.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The success of the second-rate is deplorable in itself; but it is
more deplorable in that it very often obscures the genuine masterpiece.
If the crowd runs after the false, it must neglect the true. The
intolerable <i>Romola</i> is praised; the admirable <i>Cloister and the
Hearth</i> is waived aside. So, while the very indifferent and clumsy
performance of Crippen filled the papers, the extraordinary Battersea
Murder was served with a scanty paragraph or two in obscure corners of
the Press. Indeed, we were so shamefully starved of detail that I only
retain a bare outline of this superb crime in my memory; but, roughly,
the affair was shaped as follows: In the first floor of one of the
smaller sets of flats in Battersea a young fellow (? 18&mdash;20) was
talking to an actress, a "touring" actress of no particular fame, whose
age, if I recollect, was drawing on from thirty to forty. A shot, a
near shot, broke in suddenly on their talk. The young man dashed out of
the flat, down the stairs, and there, in the entry of the flats, found
his own father, shot dead. The father, it should be remarked, was a
touring actor, and an old friend of the lady upstairs. But here comes
the magistral element in this murder. Beside the dead man, or in the
hand of the dead man, or in a pocket of the dead man's coat&mdash;I am
not sure how it was&mdash;there was found a weapon made of heavy
wire&mdash;a vile and most deadly contraption, fashioned with curious
and malignant ingenuity. It was night-time, but the bright light of a
moon ten days old was shining, and the young man said he saw someone
running and leaping over walls.</p>

<p>But mark the point: the dead actor was hiding beneath his friend's
flat, hiding and lying in wait, with his villainous weapon to his hand.
He was expecting an encounter with some enemy, on whom he was resolved
to work at least deadly mischief, if not murder.</p>

<p>Who was that enemy? Whose bullet was it that was swifter than the
dead man's savage and premeditated desire?</p>

<p>We shall probably never know. A murder that might have stood in the
very first rank, that might have vied with the affair of Madeleine
Smith&mdash;there were certain indications that made this seem
possible&mdash;was suffered to fade into obscurity, while the foolish
crowd surged about elementary Crippen and his bungling imbecilities. So
there were once people who considered <i>Robert Elsmere</i> as a
literary work of palmary significance.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Naturally, and with some excuse, the war was responsible for a good
deal of this sort of neglect. In those appalling years there was but
one thing in men's heads; all else was blotted out. So, little
attention was paid to the affair of the woman's body, carefully wrapped
in sacking, which was found in Regent's Square, by the Gray's Inn Road.
A man was hanged without phrases, but there were one or two curious
points in the case.</p>

<p>Then, again, there was the Wimbledon Murder, a singular business. A
well-to-do family had just moved into a big house facing the Common, so
recently that many of its goods and chattels were still in the
packing-cases. The master of the house was murdered one night by a man
who made off with his booty. It was a curious haul, consisting of a
mackintosh worth, perhaps, a couple of pounds, and a watch which would
have been dear at ten shillings. This murderer, too, was hanged without
comment; and yet, on the face of it, his conduct seems in need of
explanation. But the most singular case of all those that suffered from
the preoccupations of the war was, there is no doubt, the Islington
Mystery, as the Press called it. It was a striking headline, but the
world was too busy to attend. The affair got abroad, so far as it did
get abroad, about the time of the first employment of the tanks; and
people were trying not to see through the war correspondents, not to
perceive that the inky fandangoes and corroborees of these gentlemen
hid a sense of failure and disappointment.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>But as to the Islington Mystery&mdash;this is how it fell out. There
is an odd street, not far from the region which was once called Spa
Fields, not far from the Pentonville or Islington Fields, where
Grimaldi the clown was once accused of inciting the mob to chase an
overdriven ox. It goes up a steep hill, and the rare adventurer who
pierces now and then into this unknown quarter of London is amazed and
bewildered at the very outset, since there are no steep hills in the
London of his knowledge, and the contours of the scene remind him of
the cheap lodging-house area at the back of hilly seaside resorts. But
if the site is strange, the buildings on it are far stranger. They were
no doubt set up at the high tide of Sir Walter Scott Gothic, which has
left such queer memorials behind it. The houses of Lloyd Street are in
couples, and the architect, combining the two into one design, desired
to create an illusion of a succession of churches, in the Perpendicular
or Third Pointed manner, climbing up the hill. The detail is rich,
there are finials to rejoice the heart, and gargoyles of fine fantasy,
all carried out in the purest stucco. At the lowest house on the
right-hand side lived Mr. Harold Boale and his wife, and a brass plate
on the Gothic door said, "Taxidermist: Skeletons Articulated". As it
chanced, this lowest house of Lloyd Street has a longer garden than its
fellows, giving on a contractor's yard, and at the end of the garden
Mr. Boale had set up the apparatus of his craft in an outhouse, away
from the noses of his fellow-men.</p>

<p>So far as can be gathered, the stuffer and articulator was a
harmless and inoffensive little fellow. His neighbours liked him, and
he and the Boule cabinet-maker from next door, the Shell box-maker over
the way, the seal-engraver and the armourer from Baker Square at the
top of the hill, and the old mercantile marine skipper who lived round
the corner in Marchmont Street, at the house with the ivory junk in the
window, used to spend many a genial evening together in the parlour of
the Quill in the days before everything was spoilt by the war.</p>

<p>They did not drink very much or talk very much, any of them; but
they enjoyed their moderate cups and the snug comfort of the place, and
stared solemnly at the old coaching prints that were upon the walls,
and at the large glass painting depicting the landing of England's
Injured Queen, which hung over the mantelpiece, between two Pink Dogs
with gold collars. Mr. Boale passed as a very nice sort of man in this
circle and everybody was sorry for him. Mrs. Boale was a tartar and a
scold. The men of the quarter kept out of her way; the women were
afraid of her. She led poor Boale the devil's own life. Her voice,
often enough, would be heard at the Quill door, vomiting venom at her
husband's address; and he, poor man, would tremble and go forth, lest
some worse thing might happen. Mrs. Boale was a short dark woman. Her
hair was coal-black, her face wore an expression of acid malignity, and
she walked quickly but with a decided limp. She was full of energy and
the pest of the neighbourhood, and more than a pest to her husband.</p>

<p>The war, with its scarcity and its severe closing-hours, made the
meetings at the Quill rarer than before, and deprived them of a good
deal of their old comfort. Still, the circle was not wholly broken up,
and one evening Boale announced that his wife had gone to visit
relations in Lancashire, and would most likely be away for a
considerable time.</p>

<p>"Well, there's nothing like a change of air, so they say," said the
skipper, "though I've had more than enough of it myself."</p>

<p>The others said nothing, but congratulated Boale in their hearts.
One of them remarked afterwards that the only change that would do Mrs.
Boale good was a change to Kingdom Come, and they all agreed. They were
not aware that Mrs. Boale was enjoying the advantages of the
recommended treatment.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>As I recollect, Mr. Boale's worries began with the appearance of
Mrs. Boale's sister, Mary Aspinall, a woman almost as ill-tempered and
malignant as Mrs. Boale herself. She had been for some years nurse with
a family in Capetown, and had come home with her mistress. In the first
place, the woman had written two or three letters to her sister, and
there had been no reply. This struck her as odd, for Mrs. Boale had
been a very good correspondent, filling her letters with "nasty things"
about her husband. So, on her first afternoon off after her return,
Mary Aspinall called at the house in Lloyd Street to get the truth of
the matter from her sister's own lips. She strongly suspected Boale of
having suppressed her letters. "The dirty little tyke; I'll serve him,"
she said to herself. So came Miss Aspinall to Lloyd Street and brought
out Boale from his workshop. And when he saw her his heart sank. He had
read her letters. But the decision to return to England had been taken
suddenly; Miss Aspinall had, therefore, said not a word about it. Boale
had thought of his wife's sister as established at the other end of the
world for the next ten, twenty years, perhaps; and he meant to go away
and lose himself under a new name in a year or two. And so, when he saw
the woman, his heart sank.</p>

<p>Mary Aspinall went straight to the point.</p>

<p>"Where's Elizabeth?" she asked. "Upstairs? I wonder she didn't come
down when she heard the bell."</p>

<p>"No," said Boale. He comforted himself with the thought of the
curious labyrinth he had drawn about his secret; he felt secure in the
centre of it.</p>

<p>"No, she's not upstairs. She's not in the house."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed. Not in the house. Gone to see some friends, I suppose.
When do you expect her back?"</p>

<p>"The truth is, Mary, that I don't expect her back. She's left
me&mdash;three months ago, it is."</p>

<p>"You mean to tell me that! Left you! Showed her sense, I think.
Where has she gone?"</p>

<p>"Upon my word, Mary, I don't know. We had a bit of a to-do one
evening, though I don't think I said much. But she said she'd had
enough, and she packed a few things in a bag, and off she went. I ran
after her and called to her to come back, but she wouldn't so much as
turn her head, and went off King's Cross way. And from that day to this
I've never seen her, nor had a word from her. I've had to send all her
letters back to the post office."</p>

<p>Mary Aspinall stared hard at her brother-in-law and pondered. Beyond
telling him that he had brought it on himself, there seemed nothing to
say. So she dealt with Boale on those lines very thoroughly, and made
an indignant exit from the parlour. He went back to stuff peacocks, for
all I know. He was feeling comfortable again. There had been a very
unpleasant sensation in the stomach for a few seconds&mdash;a very
horrible fear at the moment that one of the outer walls of that
labyrinth of his had been breached; but now all was well again.</p>

<p>And all might have been permanently well if Miss Aspinall had not
happened to meet Mrs. Horridge in the main road, close to the bottom of
Lloyd Street. Mrs. Horridge was the wife of the Shell box-maker, and
the two had met once or twice long ago at Mrs. Boale's tea-table. They
recognized each other, and, after a few unmeaning remarks, Mrs.
Horridge asked Miss Aspinall if she had seen her sister since her
return to England.</p>

<p>"How could I see her when I don't know where she is?" asked Miss
Aspinall with some ferocity.</p>

<p>"Dear me, you haven't seen Mr. Boale, then?"</p>

<p>"I've just come from him this minute."</p>

<p>"But he can't have lost the Lancashire address, surely?"</p>

<p>And so one thing led to another, and Mary Aspinall gathered quite
clearly that Boale had told his friends that his wife was paying a long
visit to relations in Lancashire. In the first place the Aspinalls had
no relations in Lancashire&mdash;they came from Suffolk&mdash;and
secondly Boale had informed her that Elizabeth had gone away in a rage,
he knew not where. She did not pay him another visit then and there, as
she had at first intended. It was growing late, and she took her
considerations back with her to Wimbledon, determined on thinking the
matter out.</p>

<p>Next week she called again at Lloyd Street. She charged Boale with
deliberate lying, placing frankly before him the two tales he had told.
Again that horrid sinking sensation lay heavy upon Boale. But he had
reserves.</p>

<p>"Indeed," he said, "I've told you no lies, Mary. It all happened
just as I said before. But I did make up that tale about Lancashire for
the people about here. I didn't like them to have my troubles to talk
over, especially as Elizabeth is bound to come back some time, and I
hope it will be soon."</p>

<p>Miss Aspinall stared at the little man in a doubtful, threatening
fashion for a moment, and then hurried upstairs. She came down soon
afterwards.</p>

<p>"I've gone through Elizabeth's drawers," she said with defiance.
"There's a good many things missing. I don't see those bits of lace she
had from Granny, and the set of jet is gone, and so is the garnet
necklace, and the coral brooch. I couldn't find the ivory fan,
either."</p>

<p>"I found all the drawers wide open after she'd gone," sighed Mr.
Boale. "I supposed she'd taken the things away with her."</p>

<p>It must be confessed that Mr. Boale, taught, perhaps, by the nicety
of his craft, had paid every attention to detail. He had realized that
it would be vain to tell a tale of his wife going away and leaving her
treasures behind her. And so the treasures had disappeared.</p>

<p>Really, the Aspinall vixen did not know what to say. She had to
confess that Boale had explained the difficulty of his two stories
quite plausibly. So she informed him that he was more like a worm than
a man, and banged the hall door. Again Boale went back to his workshop
with a warmth about his heart. His labyrinth was still secure, its
secret safe. At first, when confronted again by the accusing Aspinall,
he had thought of bolting the moment he got the woman out of the house;
but that was unreasoning panic. He was in no danger. And he remembered,
like the rest of us, the Crippen case. It was running away that had
brought Crippen to ruin; if he had sat tight he would have sat secure,
and the secret of the cellar would never have been known. Though, as
Mr. Boale reflected, anybody was welcome to search his cellar, to
search here and there and anywhere on his premises, from the hall door
in front to the workshop at the back. And he proceeded to give his
calm, whole-souled attention to a fine raven that had been sent round
in the morning.</p>

<p>Miss Aspinall took the extraordinary disappearance of her sister
back with her to Wimbledon and thought it over. She thought it over
again and again, and she could make nothing of it. She did not know
that people are constantly disappearing for all sorts of reasons; that
nobody hears anything about such cases unless some enterprising paper
sees matter for a "stunt", and rouses all England to hunt for John
Jones or Mrs. Carraway. To Miss Aspinall, the vanishing of Elizabeth
Boale seemed a portent and a wonder, a unique and terrible event; and
she puzzled her head over it, and still could find no exit from her
labyrinth&mdash;a different structure from the labyrinth maintained by
the serene Boale. The Aspinall had no suspicions of her brother-in-law;
both his manner and his matter were straightforward, clear, and square.
He was a worm, as she had informed him, but he was certainly telling
the truth. But the woman was fond of her sister, and wanted to know
where she had gone and what had happened to her; and so she put the
matter into the hands of the police.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>She furnished the best description that she could of the missing
woman, but the officer in charge of the case pointed out that she had
not seen her sister for many years, and that Mrs Boale was obviously
the person to be consulted in the matter. So the taxidermist was again
drawn from his scientific labours. He was shown the information laid by
Miss Aspinall and the description furnished by her. He told his simple
story once more, mentioning the incident of his lying to his neighbours
to avoid unpleasant gossip, and added several details to Miss
Aspinall's picture of his wife. He then furnished the constable with
two photographs, pointed out the better likeness of the two, and saw
his visitor off the premises with cheerful calm.</p>

<p>In due course, the "Missing" bill, garnished with a reproduction of
the photograph selected by Mr. Boale, with minute descriptive details,
including the "marked limp", was posted up at the police-stations all
over the country, and glanced at casually by a few passers-by here and
there. There was nothing sensational about the placard; and the
statement "Last seen going in the direction of King's Cross" was not a
very promising clue for the amateur detective. No hint of the matter
got into the Press; as I have pointed out, hardly one per cent of these
cases of "missing" does get into the Press. And just then we were all
occupied in reading the p&aelig;ans of the war correspondents, who were
proving that an advance of a mile and a half on a nine-mile front
constituted a victory which threw Waterloo into the shade. There was no
room for discussing the whereabouts of an obscure woman whom Islington
knew no more.</p>

<p>It was sheer accident that brought about the catastrophe. James
Curry, a medical student who had rooms in Percy Street, Tottenham Court
Road, was prowling about his quarter one afternoon in an indefinite and
idle manner, gazing at shop windows and mooning at street corners. He
knew that he would never want a cash register, but he inspected the
stock with the closest attention, and chose a fine specimen listed at
&pound;75. Again, he invested heavily in costly Oriental rugs, and
furnished a town mansion in the Sheraton manner at very considerable
expense. And so his tour of inspection brought him to the
police-station; and there he proceeded to read the bills posted
outside, including the bill relating to Elizabeth Boale.</p>

<p>"Walks with a marked limp."</p>

<p>James Curry felt his breath go out of his body in a swift gasp. He
put out a hand towards the railing to steady himself as he read that
amazing sentence over again. And then he walked straight into the
police-station.</p>

<p>The fact was that he had bought from Harold Boale, three weeks after
the date on which Elizabeth Boale was last seen, a female skeleton. He
had got it comparatively cheaply because of the malformation of one of
the thigh-bones. And now it struck him that the late owner of that
thigh-bone must have walked with a very marked limp.</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>M'Aulay made his reputation at the trial. He defended Harold Boale
with magnificent audacity. I was in court&mdash;it was a considerable
part of my business in those days to frequent the Old Bailey&mdash;and
I shall never forget the opening phrases of his speech for the
prisoner. He rose slowly, and let his glance go slowly round the court.
His eyes rested at last with grave solemnity on the jury. At length he
spoke, in a low, clear, deliberate voice, weighing, as it seemed, every
word he uttered.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he began, "a very great man, and a very wise man, and a
very good man once said that probability is the guide of life. I think
you will agree with me that this is a weighty utterance. When we once
leave the domain of pure mathematics, there is very little that is
certain. Supposing we have money to invest: we weigh the pros and cons
of this scheme and that, and decide at last on probable grounds. Or it
may be our lot to have to make an appointment; we have to choose a man
to fill a responsible position in which both honesty and sagacity are
of the first consequence. Again probability must guide us to a
decision. No one man can form a certain and infallible judgment of
another. And so through all the affairs of life: we must be content
with probability, and again and again with probability. Bishop Butler
was right.</p>

<p>"But every rule has its exception. The rule which we have just laid
down has its exception. That exception confronts you terribly,
tremendously, at this very moment. You may think&mdash;I do not say
that you do think&mdash;but you may think that Harold Boale, the
prisoner at the bar, in all probability murdered his wife, Elizabeth
Boale."</p>

<p>There was a long pause at this point. Then:</p>

<p>"If you think that, then it is your imperative duty to acquit the
prisoner at the bar. The only verdict which you dare give is a verdict
of 'Not Guilty'."</p>

<p>Up to this, moment, Counsel had maintained the low, deliberate
utterance with which he had begun his speech, pausing now and again and
seeming to consider within himself the precise value of every word that
came to his lips. Suddenly his voice rang out, resonant, piercing. One
word followed swiftly on another:</p>

<p>"This, remember, is not a court of probability. Bishop Butler's
maxim does not apply here. Here there is no place for probability. This
is a court of certainty. And unless you are certain that my client is
guilty, unless you are as certain of his guilt as you are certain that
two and two make four, then you must acquit him.</p>

<p>"Again, and yet again&mdash;this is a court of certainty. In the
ordinary affairs of life, as we have seen, we are guided by
probability. We sometimes makes mistakes; in most cases these mistakes
may be rectified. A disastrous investment may be counterbalanced by a
prosperous investment; a bad servant may be replaced by a good one. But
in this place, where life and death hang in the balances which are in
your hands, there is no room for mistakes, since here mistakes are
irreparable. You cannot bring a dead man back to life. You must not
say, 'This man is probably a murderer, and therefore he is guilty.'
Before you bring in such a verdict, you must be able to say, 'This man
is certainly a murderer.' And that you cannot say, and I will tell you
why."</p>

<p>M'Aulay then took the evidence piece by piece. Scientific witnesses
had declared that the malformation of the thighbone in the skeleton
exhibited would produce exactly the sort of limp which had
characterized Elizabeth Boale. Counsel for the defence had worried the
doctors, had made them admit that such a malformation was by no means
unique. It was uncommon. Yes, but not very uncommon? Perhaps not.</p>

<p>Finally, one doctor admitted that in the course of thirty years of
hospital and private practice he had known of five such cases of
malformation of the thigh-bone. M'Aulay gave an inaudible sigh of
relief; he felt that he had got his verdict.</p>

<p>He made all this quite clear to the jury. He dwelt on the principle
that no one can be condemned unless the <i>corpus delicti</i>, the
body, or some identifiable portion of the body of the murdered person
can be produced. He told them the story of the Campden Wonder; how the
"murdered" man walked into his village two years after three people had
been hanged for murdering him. "Gentlemen," he said, "for all I know,
and for all you know, Elizabeth Boale may walk into this court at any
moment. I say boldly that we have no earthly right to assume that she
is dead."</p>

<p>Of course Boale's defence was a very simple one. The skeleton which
he sold to Mr. Curry had been gradually assembled by him in the course
of the last three years. He pointed out that the two hands were not a
very good match; and, indeed, this was a little detail that he had not
overlooked.</p>

<p>The jury took half an hour to consider their verdict. Harold Boale
was found "Not Guilty".</p>

<p>He was seen by an old friend a couple of years ago. He had emigrated
to America, and was doing prosperously in his old craft in a big town
of the Middle West. He had married a pleasant girl of Swedish
extraction.</p>

<p>"You see," he explained, "the lawyers told me I should be safe in
presuming poor Elizabeth's death."</p>

<p>He smiled amiably.</p>

<p>And finally, I beg to state that this account of mine is a grossly
partial narrative. For all I know, assuming for a moment the severe
standards of M'Aulay, Boale was an innocent man. It is possible that
his story was a true one. Elizabeth Boale may, after all, be living;
she may return after the fashion of the "murdered" man in the Campden
Wonder. All the thoughts, devices, meditations that I have put into the
heart and mind of Boale may be my own malignant inventions without the
shadow of true substance behind them.</p>
