<h2 class="chapter"><a name="ch0"><span id="p9">The</span></a> Beginning and the End</h2>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">The</span> land is cruel and our household gods thrive
badly among the cries and sobs of this continent.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
At first the whirl, the light, the newness of
it all enchants one; especially youth throws
itself on the earth, grasping, choking with the
desire to live.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Then as months go by the plains seem duller,
the mountains more dreary.  In a daily routine
moments fly; leisure from being an hour of
dreams, ambitions, becomes too short a moment
of vacuous rest.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The photograph you so gaily hung on the wall
curls towards its fastening pin.  You take it down
and throw it into the drawer; more frequently
you step to the sideboard, sundowners come at
noon.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
There is the parting of the ways, to go down,
to go up; or to follow along a disciplined way.
Then you'll need a friend, one who will sit silent,
<span id="p10">one</span> who knows his mind, who shoots, who thinks,
who <span class="sic">wholely</span> loves this land.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
After that one parting, no return: your lares
are dead, penates rot in some fogotten corner.
Your faiths are shaken, your creeds broken!
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Some may reconstruct a form of worship, a
discipline of body and mind.  They will follow
a weary, thirsty trail.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
One day emerging, their work done, in some
Sussex village they will retire.  Their windows
will overlook a green, orderly graveyard strewn
with yews; their minds will copy bits from
their favourite newspaper; with souls replete,
opening complacent eyes, they will slowly merge
into a grave contentment&mdash;the day's work is done
and they may die.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Some others may delve down, searching blindly,
fumbling in a mass of fancies struggling against
desire; fighting to keep their feet.  If the body
is brave and the mind fired by images, they
may throw wide the door to this country's soil.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
You will see them forgiving, tenderly rearing
a giant belief; acquiring unto their souls the
strange fancies, the weird mystery of Africa.
Never returning, they will build, prosper; from
the shores to the great lakes, across the desert,
<span id="p11">in</span> huts and palaces you'll meet them.  Ever
striving for more nowledge, more compre&shy;hension,
ever versatile, restless say some.  Speak&shy;ing
&ldquo;Bantu&rdquo; with their followers, Arabic with
the &ldquo;Somal,&rdquo; always alone.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Sometimes such meet and thoughtfully talk
of places, men, things long dead.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Loved by the native, tolerated by the official
who needs them to think in African terms&mdash;<!--lb-->Interpreters
who when they die leave a faith in
the giant book.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
At last the others, those who return too often
to the sideboard, slowly soak, and soaking
sink.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Soon in the house boys' huts native women
will sit and smoke; one more enterprising will
speak to the white man.  He, with the convinc&shy;ing
faith of the weak, will take an interest in
her children, tell them to mend their ways&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
and one tropical night when the hungry stars
tear his heart, a bodily desire takes shape&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
and soon &ldquo;Manapalava.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The weeds will choke the garden, the cactus
grow up through the verandah floor, boards
become disointed; he'll wear khaki: it shows
less stains; the white ants one night in a
<span id="p12">carelessly</span> opened tin box will eat his evening
collars&mdash;and so he rots, soon to die.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Africa, yours is a cruel earth, you are un&shy;forgiving,
you arouse our vilest senses, you break
our wills, curb our ambitions.  But when we
have weathered the storm our souls grow like
some great octoped; over the earth, far reach&shy;ing
all understanding, nearly immortal.  At
dawn we kiss the ground and rise appeased.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Forgiven white man with new gods older
than the world.  To think, to look, and then
inwardly rejoicing, bring souls together in one
whole.  The power of Africa through the subtle
Caucasian mind.
</p>

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch1.sec1"><span id="p15">Mombasa.</span></a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">The</span> mighty ocean breaks, rolls on, breaks again.
Across the sand banks tiny ripplets finger the
glazing sand.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The streamer slowly noses in, now to port,
now to startboard, each foot a trap.  Gently we
pass the salt and weed encrusted cylinders of a
tramp who broke her back on Mombasa's smiling
shore.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
As we creep in, one's heart stops.  There are
the <span class="sic">Boababs</span>, the Pawpaws, the wildly swinging
flowers, the cocoanut palms, the glassy beaches,
the white-skirted natives, and, through these
gorves filters the dull beat of the tom-tom.  Five
thousand miles to hear.  Five thousand miles
to see; one's deserted hearth and slowly swinging
door; just to smell this!
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Half in awe, half sun-dazed, one's fingers grip
the rail, blue sea going black before one's eyes.
As one reels, joy and madness in one's brain, the
tropical sun in one's blood, a silky voice calls,
&ldquo;Passports this way, gentlemen, all passengers
must see the Immigration Officer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="btfi">
<span id="p16">Visions</span> of New York in the distance, the
Hudson's floating ice, a preposterous puffing
paddle-boat rocked by brass bands; Ellis Island,
gloomy, unhealty, sinister; rude officials;
brutal docks.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Here, the sun, a smile, you're through; Kenya
greets you.  &ldquo;Diamond,&rdquo; the porter, will take
your bags straight to the hotel.
</p>

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch1.sec2">Kahlifee.</a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">&ldquo;Kahlifee,</span> Kahlifee, by the Sea.&rdquo;  What a
name, what a picture.  I never believe what
I'm told and am neve surprised at what I see,
at least I say I'm not.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
But Kahlifee, what a name, what a place!
</p>

<p class="btfi">
I wonder if it will be spoiled by people coming
there; I mean white people.  I suppose they'll
hang gaudy rags on trees in sunshine, and wear
them on or around their persons for the morning
and evening dip.  I suppose even fish prices will
rise when ringing Anglo-Saxon laughter coughs
on the coral sand beaches.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
On that party which was staged the other day
were all kinds of people: some civilised, some
not, and yet they led much the same lives they
<span id="p17">do</span> in the Highlands; get up, bathe, at least,
here it takes place in the sea and none need
wait their turn; eat, then wander aimlessly
around, then eat again and sleep, and so on,
drinking through the day.  The taking of photo&shy;graphs
occupied some time.  I wonder who
got the five pounds for that atrocious print which
came out in the Magazine the other day.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
At least I've been spared, all I was made to do
was talk and tell stories in moments of wakefulness.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Now I'm back in the Highlands I pine for that
stark, impressionist portrait, Kahlifee.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Kahlifee by the Sea.
</p>

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch1.sec3">Fever.</a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">Straw</span> thatched roof, mud walls, a cement
floor; Ding! Dong! Doc!  No door; a bead
curtain waves and shivers in the breeze.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
On my native bed I quiver and roll over:
Dong! Doc!  A pale radiance seems to creep
into the room; form under the eaves slight rustles,
as some mongoose trips along, or a giant taran&shy;tula
carefully steps balanced on top of the
wall: Ding! Dong! Dong! Ding! Doc!
</p>

<p class="btfi">
How I curse that bird, the fever bird; I
<span id="p18">count</span> his calls, never the same number; always
trying to catch him out.  I have counted all
day.  I thought he stopped at night, perhaps
this is only imagination.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
My mind clears; I see through the roof the
spreading palms; the cocoanuts in golden clus&shy;ters
varnished by the moonbeams, a monster
bat clinging to a stem, piercing the bark to suck
its life blood.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
I see through the wall the sandy paths bordered
with twisty shells of many hues, the pepper
bushes lined up along the walk waving their
green and orange fruit; those black, long,
crawling shapes like manilla ropes dipped in tar
are the sea worms M'pishi will give us to-morrow,
calling them sausages.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
I see through the terrace the stone steps, cut
out of the coral, down to the beach; the tamarisk
and the mangrove shadowing them down to
the sea.  The moon filters through their million
leaves; blue spots, green spots which shine
and move, the backs of a hundred creepers,
crawlers, come out of the sea on a moon night.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
I see beyond the shimmering sand broken by
a giant oyster, which gapes and snaps at some
passing fancy.  The rippleless water cut by a
<span id="p19">sail-like</span> fin, and in this transparency I see a
shark carrying out to sea the body of the Lascar
who died of heat on the German boat to-day.
The light seems dimmer in my room; some
smell seems to pervate the air, musky and yet
on the sea; like the rotting whale being boiled
down on deck.  It is dark in my room, suddenly
something is at my throat; muscular, and yet
slimy; as I strangle I have a fleeting sense of a
giant octoped.  With a shriek I suffocate.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Someone bathes my forehead and changes my
bed; a candle flickers on the chair.  &ldquo;Here,
drink this, my darling, the fever has broken, now
you will sleep!&rdquo;
</p>

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch1.sec4">Rhamdam.</a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">As</span> the evening sun falls behind the cocoanut
hills, a tense silence quells the town.  They wait.
A crashing discharge as the old brass cannon
belches fire and smoke.  The Rhamdam is over.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Here they congregate at some caf&eacute;, all
clamouring with joy and relief.  The sweetmeat
stores are crowded, a huge pile of &ldquo;gazelles'
horns&rdquo; dwindles; as one looks, cups of coffee
follow cups of coffee, hot tea and mint scents the
<span id="p20">air</span>, and above, through and into everything the
dull throb of the tom-tom grows.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The white-robed, stately sheik, a long pipe in
hand, inhales and spits, his red and gold encrusted
babouche bobs up and down below his crossed
knees, while a shrieking native violin wails and
laughs to break behind his disdainful back.
The draped women veiled in black saunter
past, casting languorous, moist glances at his
heavy rings and bracelets.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
A young bronze figure, naked but for a gaudy
loincloth, rushes by, flecked by the shop lights,
wildly ringing a bell in time with the tom-<!--lb-->toms.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Following the general line of sound, we arrive
in the great market square.  Four huge squat
<span class="sic">boababs</span> are hung with lanterns of every hue;
two bonfires blaze, casting forth smoke and <span class="sic">herby</span>-<!--lb-->scented
swirls; two &ldquo;N'gomas&rdquo; are progressing,
still decorous; they've only just begun.  The
figures clothed in cotton prints jiggle and turn,
stamping the dust into the earth.  As the
rhythm quickens they throw off cloth after cloth,
now whirling out of the circle of light for a
drink, &ldquo;tembo.&rdquo;  Soon they're naked, men and
women face to face, eyes contorted, muscles
<span id="p21">twitching</span>, passion shaking&mdash;near, nearer&mdash;the
sweat running from their shiny backs.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The light-coloured Arabs stalk disdainfully by<!--lb-->&mdash;picking
their way through the crowd; their
spotless turbans lofty and proud, disappear into
the doors of the Mosque.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The savages dance and yell and love outside.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Outside the true heart of Mohammed yet true
believers, the black children beget more sons to
Islam.  Wide is the power of the children of the
Sword.
</p>

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch1.sec5">My Lagoon.</a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">As</span> we chug in from the sea the sand surges
upwards; we see breaks in the reef where the
rollers pass on, to die hissing on the burning sand.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
We thread our way in; the hungry coral
gaping on both sides, few feet to spare; carried
in on the crest of the wave.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
A small creek opens out; slowly twisting and
turning we slip between the falling mangrove
banks.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Under the highly stepping roots coloured wavy
fish pause and glide.  A thousand slimy things
left clinging to the sea-dipped boughs by the
<span id="p22">receding</span> tide.  From time to time a flash of gold
as a Sun-fish, frightened, dashes from the shadows
to the deep waters of the creek.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
A native diver, trident poised, peers over the
gunwall; a downward thrust and a slashing
silver body is drawn up transpierced, to be thrown
with a thump to the bottom of the boat, its
colours dying in the midday air.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Still we twist and turn, the slow throbbing
of the engine scares unseen birds among the
tangled mangroves, the canal widens, benches
of sand thrust out underneath the surface from
the banks; as a last turn swerves by, a burst of
colour dazzles us, a lagoon opening before our
eyes, heralded by two giant pillars of tangled
vines, shot scarlet and gold&mdash;my lagoon, my
find!
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Instinctively the engine has stopped and we
drift in; the mangrove swamps halted at the
entry, a fitting gate.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
White coral banks die into the flashing sandy
beaches; on the banks wave feathery cocoanut
palms with violently flowered bushes, orange and
citron, at their feet.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
On the furthest end a small landing stage;
a short climb of steps and above, my dream
<span id="p23">realised</span>, a white low-roofed bundalow, thatched
with rushes, walls forehead high, white coral
pillars symmetrical along the wide verandah.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
My Neopara greets us by the steps; &ldquo;We
saw your smoke signal last night, Effendi.  The
rooms are ready.  The food is cooked.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="btfi">
We pass into the shade, our foreheads brushed
by hanging columbines of violet hues.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
In colour and peace my mind seeks repose.
</p>

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch1.sec6">The Country Cousin.</a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">As</span> I bump down in the train towards Mombasa,
I try and collect my bewildered mind.  Just
my luck.  I'd come down for a few days' fun at
Muthaiga and was enjoying the six o'clock bar
when a silky voice murmurs at my elbow: &ldquo;So
glad you're down Bob, your aunt was asking
about you this morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="btfi">
My uncle-in-law is rather a dear, but kept well
in hand by my Aunt Anna-Belle, only an aunt
by self-adoption&mdash;hers!  She decided years ago
that she must keep an eye on me, as dear &ldquo;Emily,&rdquo;
my mother, &ldquo;is so weak with that boy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="btfi">
I went to dinner, sat through it thoroughly
subdued, was told that I was a fool to consort with
<span id="p24">the</span> bounders&mdash;why can't you be content with
the workers?  (Evidently she thinks her friends
work.)  &ldquo;You're wasting your time, your dear
mother would be deeply grieved.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="btfi">
After dinner I drove home, having promised
anything to get away, and to-day I am bumping
down in a hot railway carriage to meet a niece of
hers, &ldquo;a daughter of that degenerate pleasure-<!--lb-->chasing
woman, my sister.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Aunt Anna-Belle's niece.  What a job!
Meet a long-legged awkward schoolgirl, so
thoroughly nice.  To have to feed her ice creams
and sweets in the sun, to get her innumerable
parcels through the Customs, to have to chaperon
her in Mombasa, see her comfortable and amused
in the train.  And all the crowd; my crowd
are in Mombasa, presumably bathing, what a
life!
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Weak is the flesh!  Cowardly the mind!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I was too stark frightened of Aunt Anna-Belle
to say that I was busily engaged cutting the
thorns from the cactus in Government House
Garden, or counting sardine tins and dessicated
apples in Safariland Ltd.  So I was landed
summarily without even need of net or gaff.
Well, well, I hope the boat is a week late.  Aunt
<span id="p25">Anna-Belle</span> is paying expenses.  I might be even
welcome among my friends on that basis.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
After ups and downs, some food, some drink,
I sink into slumber disrupted by dreams of the
aunt chasing me around a kitchen with a broom
handle; I, trying to protect myself in the right
quarters and conceal a pot of borrowed jam.
Shades of our youth!
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The sun rising glints in my eyes.  I awake,
and stretching, am caught, fascinated by that first
view of Mombasa and Kilindini harbour, of light
greens and pale blues, of bobbing cockle shells
and bored, lazily-smoking liners.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
A French boat is nosing into anchorage.  My
heart stops in dismay.  My sweet young cousin
is coming by the <i>Messageries Maritimes</i>, but it is
only due to-morrow; it would be awful if she
was already in.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
I am grimy and sticky with the long journey
down, and dash to the Manor Hotel as soon as
we are in.  It is her boat.  D&mdash;&mdash;, two million
times D&mdash;&mdash;.  My boy throws my things around
and in a few minutes I am careering madly down
the shadowed avenue behind a cheerful Somali
driving a chattering Ford taxi.  I am down in
time.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
<span id="p26">As</span> I clamber up the side of the ship, I mop my
forehead and think up suitable things to say to
a girl of eighteen.  To a steward I ask: &ldquo;Will
you tell Miss Mason her cousin has come to take
her off?&rdquo;  His inquiring look apprising me
slowly: &ldquo;Mlle. Anna-Christine Mason?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;   Why do they all have to be called
after Austrian Archduchesses in that family?
The French are not apt to look with awe upon
the benighted Anglo-Saxon, but I look well
groomed.  I've done my best.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
&ldquo;Si Monsieur veut bien attendre, Made&shy;moiselle
serait ravie qu'il d&eacute;jeune avec elle &agrave;
Soir&eacute;e.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Ye Gods!  What's the matter with
the child?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Oh, Mademoiselle n'est pas
souffrante, mais elle n'aime pas la chaleur de la
journ&eacute;e.&rdquo;  &ldquo;I'll wait.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Bien Monsieur.  Le
bar est au bout du pont a tribord.&rdquo;  My French
is rusty, been moulting since 1918, but I get
what I want in the bar, and gather from shreds
the impression that my sweet young cousin is
quite a personage.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The awnings and the ropes stretch and creak
around the bar, the tinkle of ice in the glasses;
<span id="p27">the</span> soft warm atmosphere.  My mind doses, a
hand unconsciously rising from time to time for
another drink; all subdued by the sing-song of
half-heard Gallic voices.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
I slowly become aware of some fragrance in
the air, some Eastern scent, frangipane, or jasmine
and amber, like at sundown from the clusters
hanging low over the walls of Fez or Marrakech.
Through the door opposite comes a lithe figure
in pale mauve, sleeveless, with wide soft hat.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
&ldquo;Are you Cousin Bob?&rdquo; in a low toneless
voice.  I leap up&mdash;this cannot be Anna-Christine.
She turns, introducing her companion, Captain
R., Commander of the ship.  &ldquo;He has been
very kind to me on the trip.&rdquo; She sits opposite
me, the captain subsiding heavily in another
chair; her arms are marvellous, from the orange-<!--lb-->tinted
nails to the shoulders, not a trace of
colour; not marble, not white ivory; perhaps
of some old ivory held for generations in long
Chinese fingers.  On one finger an opium smoker's
ring of green jade, no other ornament.  As the
ordered cocktail comes, she takes off her hat,
revealing deep green eyes set wide apart, long
black lashes and eyebrows so minute and regular,
they might have been painted on.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
<span id="p28">&ldquo;Pale</span> moon face&rdquo; of the old Chinese ballads.
The dark red lips nearly maroon, the wavy
shingled hair&mdash;a marvellous work of nature, a
more marvellous work of art; and that on board
a ship after three weeks at sea!
</p>

<p class="btfi">
I am stunned, and during luncheon can only
mumble and be very British, while she talks
vividly now in English, now in French.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Later in the evening I take her off, the whole
ship's company seems to man decks to see her
go; I'm getting back my footing and we talk
in the Customs house, and we talk in the taxi,
and we talk in the hotel, she sitting on the
edge of a bed, while my boy unpacks her
things.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
I go away to change, my mind whirling with
the charm of this child of eighteen.  It does
not seem possible.  She knows everyone&mdash;about
everything, she seems to have been everytwhere,
and her voice, that flat voice, without tone or
pitch, like voices heard in Islam's bazars, reciting
verses of the Koran.  It worms into your mind,
fascinates your senses, envelops, numbs one!
What is natural?  What is art?  What is
training?
</p>

<p class="btfi">
As we start out for Tudor House, across the
<span id="p29">island</span>, for dinner, she insists, and we take bathing
suits just in case.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The hybiscus, the jasmine, the bougainville
trail overhead.  Light fishes served on brown
and grey dishes.  Pawpaws and mangoes on the
table.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Her stories of Indian bazars and Hill stations
way up in the Himalayas, and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. dinner is over.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Her amber fragrance goes to my head, all my
British training and self repose has fled, I am
throbbing in heart and mind.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Down to the beach and into the rippleless
creek, the moon throwing flashes of blue fire into
our wakes as we swim.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Suddenly I miss her, no longer at my side;
and turning, startled, see her emerge, naked,
silver on the shining beach.  Madness!  I rush
in to be told in that cold flat voice that the
night is for night hawks, and, as there is no one
there to see, I should not have to worry.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
She lies on the sand beautiful as some goddess,
silver statue of some Athenian athlete, all length
and suppleness, and yet as cold as white marble,
frozen in some Nordic garden.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
At last we go home; she tells me with a wan&shy;dering
smile to sleep well and have no dreams.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
<span id="p30">To-day</span> there was a clash of wills, and I lost
as I am now doomed to lose for ever; I was
reserving seats on the train and she wouldn't
&ldquo;be put in with some maybe bathed but cer&shy;tainly
not washed female.&rdquo;  She insisted in
travelling in a big compartment with me.  I
battled my best, but was undone.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
After the conflict, in soothing tones, one hand
on my feverish hand: &ldquo;Bob, it's no use; I
always get my own way.  I always take what
I want and throw it away when I like; don't
forget this ever, I hate repetition.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="btfi">
We are now in the train.  Dinner at the way&shy;side
station amused her; the lights are out, and
through the panes of glass shadowy landscapes
dwindle by.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
There is a certain humour in it all; what a
defeat Aunt Anna-Belle is in for.  At that
moment soft lips touch mine, but cold!  Arms
stretch above my head round my shoulders.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Those pure arms I saw in that first meeting,
that silver body of the beach.
</p>

<p class="btfi spaceAbove">
&ldquo;I take what I want and throw it away.&rdquo;
When shall I be thrown?  Thrown by a child!

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">The</span> bumping of the train awakens me as it
roughly stops.  Makindu!  Breakfast awaits in
the refreshment room.  I try and straighten
sundry clothing and fix the tangled hair; then
leap to the platform and scald myself with tea
and eggs.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Back in my compartment, martyrised but not
replete, I finish the very summary toilette and
settle down to a book&mdash;a book about Kenya,
naturally.  In the five days I have stepped its
soil, I have gone through varieties of emotions;
I don't know what to think.  Last night, when
the train climbed the hills out of Mombasa, I
was homesick and weary, the banana leaves
seemed too wide, too shiny, the cocoanuts
unending, the train so uncomfortable without
blankets, sheets or towels.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
This morning I think I'm better and compose
myself to study in Lord Cranworth's book, that
tabloid monument.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
My companion is still asleep in the upper
berth.  He is an old settler returning from a
<span id="p34">month's</span> sea air in Mombasa; hei s so casual that
one might call him untidy, but he has great
charm, with a red nose and shock of white hair.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
He told fairy stories far into the night, every
now and then helping himself to a Scotch, neat,
out of my flask!  He was most solicitous, wanted
to sell me his farm, in the maizeland, somewhere
up near a place called N'joro.  &ldquo;Well developed,
charming spot, part of the land improved for
settlemend by Lord Delemere, every commodity,
with furniture complete.  So take it or leave it,
my dear boy!&rdquo;  He was certainly full of charm<!--lb-->&mdash;Irish,
I presume.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
It has been raining and the dust is laid, the
famous red dust I've heard so much about as
coating everything it touches with a layer of
tan.  Looking back the way we came I see a
shaft of light emerging from the clouds; that
must be Kilimanjaro on the border, beyond
Tanganyika.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
I am disappointed in this great rolling plain:
I hoped to see game in hundreds.  I've read
&ldquo;The Man Eaters of Tsavo&rdquo; and thought that
when we followed the boundary of the game
reserve, I would see masses of wild animals.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
<span id="p35">Thump</span> a thump!  Thump a thump! go the
wheels.  My companion rolls over in his cot, yawns,
sticks out one leg, then climbs down: &ldquo;Looking
for game, my boy?  Don't you worry, after
Sultan Hamud you'll see all you want.  You'll
probably see Blainey Percival's Giraffe, the one
they had to raise the telegraph poles for.  Not
know that story?  Wait till I get a drink and
I'll tell it to you.  Awfully stuffy in here, or
have I got a head?&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="btfi">
We are now all completely dressed and he,
refreshed, sits by my side telling me names of
trees; the little valleys he calls Dongas.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Sultan Hamud, where the lions come to drink
at night at the Station pump, &ldquo;Quartier
G&eacute;n&eacute;ral&rdquo; of the Game Reserve.  My com&shy;panion
stretches his legs a moment and we
proceed, the line climbing, twisting up among
the thorn trees and the red rocks slowly rising on
that great plain that slopes from 1,000 feet above
Mombasa to 6,000 feet at the foot of the highlands.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
We now see game sparsely dotted across the
country.  &ldquo;There's Percival's Giraffe!&rdquo; and
points; above a thorn tree, three hundred yards
away, a thin neck bends with a small pennant at
the mast-head in lieu of head.  &ldquo;And that's
<span id="p36">a</span> water buck down in the shadows near that
twisted tree, his spreading horns like the back
of some French chair, brown and polished, white
at the tips&mdash;what a magnificent beast!&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="btfi">
We emerge again on the plain after sundry
twists and turns; my companion names the
animals as they appear.  &ldquo;A tommy&mdash;all does
there; look higher up on the skyline for the buck&mdash;<!--lb-->they
are shyer; there's a kongoni, you'll see
lots of those as you go up to Naivasha.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="btfi">
&ldquo;Oh, and that clumsy, bearded, rumbling thing
a &lsquo;wildebeeste&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;It tries to race the train and
goes careering over the bow of the rise madly
galloping.  More &ldquo;tommies,&rdquo; thousands, a flock,
a herd of ostriches flapping along.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The Celt explains their haits and, yawning,
commits himself to sleep again.  Even to me,
repetition tires and I return to Cranworth's
&ldquo;Profit and Sport.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="btfi">
But here are houses.  I arouse my companion.
&ldquo;Oh, here we are!  Have you a place to go?
Well, don't worry.  I'll take you to the &lsquo;Nor&shy;folk&rsquo;
and introduce you to &lsquo;Auntie,&rsquo; she's the
manageress, a great woman, practically runs the
country.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The train puffs through a line of tin huts
<span id="p37">and</span> comes to a rest in what looks really like a
station.  As we clamber out I sway struck, my
eyes blinking at the vivid shirts displayed.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
&ldquo;That's nothing,&rdquo; says my friend; &ldquo;just you
wait in town till race week.  Then you'll see
some lovely ones; we all wear them.&rdquo;  And I
visualise that purple face and white hair framed
by some amazing blazing mauve silk shirt, short-<!--lb-->sleeved,
corduroy slacks of a fawny violet to
match!
</p>

<p class="btfi">
My mentor gets me into a cab, my luggage
piled in front, and he escorts me through the
town, naming each shop as we pass, waving to
friends.  By the time we've followed Govern&shy;ment
Road to the &ldquo;Norfolk,&rdquo; I feel I know at
least half the population.  I mount the steps to
be greeted by a white-haired smiling old lady.
I am at home, I am taken into &ldquo;Auntie's&rdquo;
charge and my worries are at an end.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
My Irish friend waves a hand.  &ldquo;I'm staying
at the club, Muthaiga,&rdquo; and a parting counsel,
&ldquo;Don't let any of those sharks sell you any land,
you can't be too careful when you don't know
about it!&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="btfi">
This is too perfect.  Now I, too, need a settling
drink.
</p>

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch2.sec2"><span id="p38">Pets.</span></a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">After</span> a long trek down, and the motor ride <!--Actually, in the original book this first line is indented and the first word is not in small-caps.-->
from Meru, I reach Nairobi fagged out.  Washed
and bathed, I'm carried off to Muthaiga for
a drink.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
As we drive up we are passed by a low-bodied
Buick, piled up with luggage and boys.  &ldquo;Ah&mdash;they
are the Happy Valley crowd,&rdquo; says the Colonel
at my side.  We stop and park the car behind
theirs.  &ldquo;Salaam! mon colonel!&rdquo; the boy
cries, all dusty faced, orange shirt turned to
brown.  &ldquo;Hello, Delicia!&rdquo; the colonel calls, as
the girl gets out, dark haired under a broad
tera&iuml;, in grey slacks and green jumper, small and
dainty with firm, pointed chin and wide spaced
grey eyes, much personality.  We all meet and
sit on the verandah for a drink&mdash;&ldquo;You don't
know Samson!&mdash;Oh, Ned, please get Samson.&rdquo;
He drags his long supple form from the deepest
chair with a sigh of ennui, goes to the car, bring&shy;ing
back a four months' old lion cub; &ldquo;I never
travel without him, but I've also got Roderigo
and Bill Sikes, also Samson's pal, Gillie, the
Airedale.&rdquo;  They are all brought for inspection,
the two monkeys, tiny, and clinging like moths.
<span id="p39">Roderigo</span> is sweet, but Delicia warns he is not
very gentlemanly in his habits.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
She talks and tells the Colonel all the gossip.
Ned stalks off to the bar.  He seems so nervous
and jumpy, cannot stay still, wanders from group
to group.  Delicia tells of his accident with the
elephant: &ldquo;His nerves are terrible and he will
go hunting in the forest with only one good
arm.&rdquo;  She smiles, &ldquo;He's difficult at times.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="btfi">
&ldquo;And, Delicia, do play to us to-night.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well, maybe, but not at the club, and we must
have dinner, a wash and thousands of drinks.
I'm feeling completely passed out now.  I'm
going to my room, do send Ned along soon, he'll
only get cross if he stays too long in the bar.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="btfi">
&ldquo;A great pity,&rdquo; murmurs the Colonel as she
goes.  &ldquo;A great girl, Delicia, but she cares too
much for her pets and he cares too much for her.&rdquo;
</p>

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch2.sec3">The Game Department.</a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">Governor</span>, hunter, colonist, tourist, trader, one
day crosses A's bridge, and turning aside by the
bright citron bush, trudges up the drive under
the blue gums to halt in a dusty clearing.

<p class="btfi">
The white shack, the corrugated iron roof,
<span id="p40">the</span> verandah, L&nbsp;shaped and dusty, a few cars
packed opposite, a vague odour of eucalyptus,
an imagined taint of formaldehyde, an ominous
calm, a prosperity due to many fines&mdash;The
Game Department!
</p>

<p class="btfi">
A smiling Babu waits upon you.  &ldquo;What is
your desire, sir?&rdquo;  The Colonel for the fishes,
the Captain for the jungle, at your desire to
weigh the &ldquo;Tembo's&rdquo; teeth, or you seek some
rhino horn for memory reviving of long de&shy;parted
youth?
</p>

<p class="btfi">
While bending, his white clothes so tight the
Babu puffs and weighs the ivory, you watch,
smiling, nervous of the result; held by some
force, you turn.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
As silent as timid does or one of his great cats,
the Captain has come in.  All knowing behind
his glasses, he knew you were not quite sure the
weight was right&mdash;intuitive Celt, from Scotland
to Africa; bringing lore unknown to natives,
imagination alien to all hunters, he has made his
department great, his laws obeyed.  And many
a restless eland herd grazes in peace; many a
buffalo fights as dawn at the water hole, that the
Game Department should reap where he has sown.

</p>

<p class="btfi">
Lord D. to-night has at his board His Majesty's
representatives in these colonies.  Afterwards a
ball will conclude what the Muthaiga diner has
left undone.  Woe in the Home Office.  Woe
to colonial secretaries.  When the governors
dine at Muthaiga many youths look up promotion
lists in the Whitehall.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
One long table; silver, flowers; the native
servants all a-fluster, even Ali loses his smile, while
Yusuf shakes and shakes behind his bar.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
<span id="p47">We!</span> the vile settlers relegated to the outer
hall, are thrown some scraps, the fish before the
soup, the pudding spread with mayonnaise.  The
only unforgotten item will be the monthly bill.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
As our last champagne bottle is whisked away
still half full, the big Table rises and dribbles out
across the court.  Small house, lower form, the
miserable Third, mere fags, we follow our
betters.  &ldquo;Naughty William&rdquo; from Uganda
drops us a smile.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
'Tis a pity our wives are so needed to tease
away the administrative worries, or we could
have been eliminated.  Fractious settlers, oh!
so despised!
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The miserable settler has a nasty way of out&shy;lasting
any official party, so towards two o'clock
we have the room to ourselves; and, with band
well liquored up, &ldquo;will hand ourselves a time&rdquo;
at least till dawn.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Then for another six months among trouble
and pain, through dust and mud, will try and
scrape a living from Africa's cruel earth.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Way up in the mountains, down in the gulleys,
chasing sheep stealers, curing cattle, burnt by
the sun, chilled by the rain, exhausted, beggarly,
but free.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
<span id="p48">Happy</span> for once in our lives.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Oh!  Kenya!
</p>

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch2.sec8">Six o'clock.</a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">Six</span> o'clock!  One light, two lights.  Muthaiga
Club wakes up from a somnolent, dreary day,
the boys shake themselves and yawn, coming
from dark recesses where they slept since noon.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
From the tennis courts, from the golf, from
town, through the swinging doors of the
squash courts, by ones, by twos, they come;
their women cluster around the court ordering
gin fizzes and tea, after a short while gathering
up their coats and sticks, depart home to the
subdued purr of their American automobiles.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
From seven till eight Muthaiga is the man's
paradise, a few less athletic in the members' room
consult a Wall Street advice or delve in bridge.
The majority lounge round the bar, hanging
themselves across the counter&mdash;no tall stools
allowed&mdash;propped upagainst the walls, draped
carelessly across the green leather settee.  Now
they talk, now they thrash out the day's work,
tales fly round gathering listeners, in groups
quickly forming and dissolving.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
<span id="p49">&ldquo;I</span> hear that Frenchman in the Wanjohi got
tossed by an elephant the other day.&rdquo;  &ldquo;What?
Ned?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Yes, I was down at Gilgil yesterday
and Dr. Henderson was coming back form there;
he told a wondrous tale.  I wonder if it was his
or the noble Count's&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="btfi">
&ldquo;It appears an old bull wandered up the
valley from Lakipia and messed about in
Hay's back garden; the manager sent over to  <!--Hay = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josslyn_Hay%2C_22nd_Earl_of_Erroll-->
Ned's for a big rifle, and after lunch they
appeared.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
&ldquo;As far as Henderson made out, Ned and a few
boys followed the beast till they got within a
few hundred yards; it is very thick and bushy
forest there; the elephant must have heard
them as he turned down wind.  Ned followed.
From behind a nauseous pipe: &lsquo;What an ass!&rsquo;
The elephant ambushed them, charged,
knocking him down with a side slash of his
tusk.  He squirmed among the brute's feet;
naturally, the animal dug around with its trunk
and Ned says he stuck his fingers in the nostrils
and got kicked out backwards into a clump of
thorns.  After a thorough smelling over the
elephant left him.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;That is an elephant
story!&rdquo;  &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the 3rd K.A.R., &ldquo;Ned
<span id="p50">generally</span> tells the truth except about his cham&shy;pagne.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I don't know what happened,&rdquo; says
the Game Department, &ldquo;but I'll send scouts up,
as I know he hasn't an elephant licence.&rdquo;  And
so they battered for and against, some taking
sides, some not, the Hunters silently sucking
at their pipes.  One can never tell what my lord
the elephant may take into his mind to do.
&ldquo;How is Ned?&rdquo; says the 3rd K.A.R.  &ldquo;Oh,
black and blue all over, three ribs broken and a
dislocated shoulder.  Henderson says that little
American wife of his set the whole business, a
plucky girl, can play, and knows a cocktail
too&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch3.sec1"><span id="p53">The Gilgil Fair.</span></a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">Nine</span> o'clock!  Mr. S&mdash;&mdash; rolls up in his
sumptuous car.  Auction Day in Gilgil, the
corrals full with pawing, butting cattle, dust
rising like smoke, Somali herders cursing like
true believers, Masai herdsmen glowering, wishing
Moran spears through their jostlers' guts.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Behind the stand a few cars are already parked.
Some Abyssinian ponies have just come down,
thin, weary, hoofsore, after a five hundred mile
trek.  A trial or two, much haggling and calling
Allah to witness, then some notes pass hands, and
a smiling Somali hopes you won't recognise him
the next time you meet; or, at least, that when
the horse comes down, your neck will be effec&shy;tively
broken.  While all this is progressing cars
have arrived.  The bright-shirted settlers from
the Valley, a buyer or two from town, the
managers of the stock farms, a few Dutchmen
after oxen, a troop of seers, seekers after cash,
buyers of things given away.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Wives speckle the stand with youthful radiance
and Egyptian cigarettes.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
<span id="p54">&ldquo;Ladies</span> and gentlemen, I am about to auction
off to-day the most meritorious, healthy and
valuable collection of cattle put on the market
this day.&rdquo;  All this from Mr. <span class="nobr">S&mdash;&mdash;,</span> in one
breath.  The auction goes on.  Ding! Dong!
Back and forth, prices not high to-day; native
stock do better than grades, there are some Masai
buyers from the Reserve.  A fat Mombasa
merchant bids for cows in milk, the Rhamdam
is over.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
We sit and talk, watching now and then.  Talk
of wheat and polo, talk of damage to crops, of
zebra shooting.  As the heat rises the bidding falls;
but Mr. S&mdash;&mdash; gets a laugh and things liven up.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The Somalis, with floating turbans and bright
kekois, nudge, poke, drive the cattle about.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Shouts of laughter as one, keenly inspecting a
young calf, is knocked flat by the irate mother.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
An interlude; we troop out on the field behind
the stand to bid for a &ldquo;box-bodied Sedan,
built for Safari or farm, can clear land better
than a plough, never sticks in bottomless mud,
only run a few months, complete with tools.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Bunny,&rdquo; for five pounds gets it: an old Ford
with nailed-down curtains, smelling of the pigs it
brought to market, broken silencer sweeping the
<span id="p55">earth,</span> to clear it, no doubt; has been already
in the Malewa on a wet night; a night wet for
all, about four years ago; two spare nuts and
an old tube go with it, the spares!
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Intent lags, so we all go off to the club for a
drink, and Mr. S&mdash;&mdash; joins us.  This day waxing
confident, he shows how to make &ldquo;Nile water,&rdquo;
patent medicine for fever, cough, rheumatics,
and any other disease.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Then we all sleep it of funder the flowing
shadow of the &ldquo;Syndicate&rdquo; wall.
</p>

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch3.sec2">The Great Rift Valley.</a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">The</span> Great Rift Valley&mdash;how often we've heard
that name on school benches when explorers
came to lecture; in our morning papers when
the Uganda Railway needed more funds; at
social functions when our host had collected the
latest Lady Adventuress, who rolled her eyes,
whose bosom heaved when describing the sunset;
which, by the way, takes place behind a very
large and volcanic mountain.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Many a time I've cursed it when my boiling
Ford must stop and wait in the baking sun on
that knobbly escarpment climb.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
<span id="p56">Looking</span> back towards Naivasha I've never
felt great enthusiasm, but I do remember coming
down it nervously, wondering what kind of a
mess that Central Europa count should have
made when he went over the side.  I had a
drink with him at Gilgil the other day; all I can
say is &ldquo;Beginner's luck!&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="btfi">
One clear spot on that salt, dusty road, &ldquo;Hot
Springs.&rdquo;  How many thirsty cars have drunk
there.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The sign post always fascinates me.
On one side &ldquo;Mongalla 918 miles.&rdquo;&mdash;The Nile,
sweltering grey and dull, slouching past its
papyrus banks, the Lechewe and the Sititunga
slipping quietly away, while a sweating, swearing,
spluttering half-drowned sportsman tries to get
a shot between the mosquitoes' stabs.&mdash;On the
other side &ldquo;Lake Nyassa 2,000&rdquo; and I do not
remember how many miles away!  Shadows of
thorn bush, stretches of scrub, great towering
Kilimanjaro, the tobacco and neat German
houses of Tanganyika, the deep black waters and
puffing steamer on the end of a native woven rope.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
&ldquo;Sir, will you have a glass of wine with me?&rdquo;
The courtly stranger bows from the hips.  From
<span class="corr; sic='Johdpoores'">Jodhpoores</span> neat to wide-brimmed, the brightly-hand&shy;kerchiefed
Tera&iuml; he is the typical Kenya.  A
<span id="p57">flash</span> of teeth, a quick move, a vision boylike in
its youth by its side.  A girl? A boy? who
knows? its slacks, its grey shirt and short slick
hair, who could tell?
</p>

<p class="btfi">
But we split a bottle of Lanson 19, fresh
churned from a journey up-country.  They
went away to the sweet purring of their straight
8 Hup sliding up the hill.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Would that my Ford would do such, but it
has its advantages; the other day, after a party
at Frank's, I tried the escarpment, only to get
through by the skin of my teeth, the banging of
the Ford having scared the buffaloes right off
the road.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Then the Great Rift Valley opens out and
you see this lake, Naivasha, its swampy eastern
shores, its mountains to the west, and on towards
Gilgil, the road winding in and out, playing hide
and seek with the railway.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The trail of dust behind the flying car, the
cloud of dust behind the sheep, the mud like
pea soup after the cloud burst, the fumbling with
unknowing hands to fix unyielding chains to
slimy wheels.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Great Rift Valley, with your changing colours,
your smell of peppery dust and salty sweat,
<span id="p58">backbone</span> of the country say the sheep and
cattle men; fissure in the great earth says the
geologist; crevasse where men go down never
to emerge, or leastwise, to travel the earth
chained to the smells and dust of Africa.
</p>

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch3.sec3">Dust&mdash;N'Joro.</a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">After</span> Nakuru the railway winds slowly through
the foothills, brown dust, red dust; a few
clumps of meagre eucalyptus, a patch or two of
wattle and waving on their hardened stalks,
millions upon millions of corn cobs, maize,
Indian corn.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Capital of this golden crop, N'joro; a station,
two Indian Dukhas, a blistered steel grey water
tower; around, nothing but maize and dust,
dust and maize.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
From an adjacent field it rises in clouds, the
N'joro Country Club is holding its winter polo
competition.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
A wooden shack, a grass &ldquo;Banda,&rdquo; native syces
holding 13-hand Somalis, 16-hand country breds;
a row of cars, splashes of light with short-sleeved
brilliant shirts.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Between each chukker the dust cloud seems to
<span id="p59">die</span> down for a second.  It has settled in your
eyes, between your teeth, up your hair, through
your clothes.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
At last polo is over and sun-caked, dust-burnt
heroes dismount, cracking grey-red complexions
when their first drink homeward goes; a half-<!--lb-->moon
grey-red left on the rim of the glass.
</p>

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch3.sec4">Mount Kenya.</a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">Up</span> rocks, down dales.  It seems to be an unending
trail: I don't know the road and am following
another car.  The country changes so; the plain
grassy and undulating, long-tailed birds sailing
in long swoops; then forest land, precipitous
gulleys where we nose down carefully and splash
through the ford at the bottom; ascending
stones roll down from beneath the wheels of the
preceding car.  Twisted wild olive trees jut out
from red clay banks.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
When we stop on the crest to refill our radiators,
one of us newcomers whoops with joy; ecstati&shy;cally
we gather around the deep imprint of a
lion's pad in the soft earth.  On we travel north,
always north, towards the Equator; the sky is
greyed with a few fleecy clouds.  As we top the
<span id="p60">last</span> rise, far away, shining above a blanket of
clouds, Mount Kenya rears its head, a tooth of
rock part covered in snow.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
We go rattling down through dust and stones
to the plains, winding mile upon mile between
the flat-topped thorn trees.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
&ldquo;Why does the trail wind so, Jack?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Oh,
because we're probably following a native track
and they never walk straight.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Mount Kenya grows, and the evening wind
drags away the clouds by shreds till only a few
specks remain like pods on a cotton plant bursting
to the glory of the setting sun.  The lights play
on it like some kaleidoscope; this soft, wet
atmosphere makes every detail clear; patches of
light grass, the bamboos; the dark towering
cedars; that rolling spur to the south with
irregular clumps.  All is so clear that we can
imagine the frozen buffalo towering among the
snows up there.  The sun is set, we pass through
a few lights to carry on, and just as all goes as
black as should in Africa, we turn up a drive,
flowers on each side glistening in the headlights.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The grating of the brakes, a sudden jarring
stop, and a waving cocktail-shaking figure greets
us by the dark wood floor.

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch4.sec1"><span id="p63">An Elopement.</span></a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">Hand</span> in hand, we stole out of camp; the moon
high up in the skies silvers the winding path, then
down a little slope, the woods thinning all the
while; a murmur grows as we approach the
shelf where the little brooklet takes a leap to a
thousand feet below.  Eternity!
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Mist clouds the valley sides, the dark cedars
pointing their heads through its fleeciness.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The lake shimmers in the moonlight rippleless,
the papyrus nodding indignant heads as some
rat climbs their stalks.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Above the world, out of the world, remote on
a volcanic shelf; the live waters going down to
some distant planet.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
We have come out to talk, to discuss ourselves,
others, our intermingled lives; to thrust and
push over our tangled trails, to try and clear a
road to peace and happiness.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
We had left the fire, hearts full of wounds, of
aches, of desires; our minds seething with
unuttered thoughts, caught-up fancies, wild
hallucinations and love.  Perhaps!
</p>

<p class="btfi">
<span id="p64">We</span> have run away, run away together.  She
has run away from him!  No! from his life!
from her friends!  I have run away from myself.
I have come to drown myself in her feelings, to
lie my head between her cool rigid breasts.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
We have run away to the top of the world,
some instinct guiding us towards this hanging
ledge above the Rift Valley.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Until to-day we have never spoken of what lies
behind us; never acted but as young lovers
running away.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
During dinner I could see the episodes of the
crisis coming and going in her clear eyes.  Dancing
with joy at the idea of having taken his car to do
the bolt.  Sombre at the recollections of that
last scene in the library, with lights low, his
revolver in hand, his rush of words, his idioms,
his colossal conceit.  Soft tones play in her eyes
when she remembers our welcome on that first
dreary, water-soaked evening when we knocked
shyly on the door, wondering how we might be
received, the erring couple in flight.  We
have come out to talk this over and, more, the
future.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Sitting down on the ledge the swishing of the
stream diverts our thoughts.  I reach over the
<span id="p65">cigarette</span> tin and two orange lights glow and die,
to glow again.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
I must speak, I must make things clear, but my
mind wanders fascinated by the glacial ethereal
beauty of the valley; each contour stiffens as
the mist dissolves, sinking in dew between the
cedars; on a far distant ridge a fire twinkles and
the minute throbbing of some tom-tom miles
away.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
My cigarette drops some ashes light and clear
on my dark coat.  Why have we done this,
why have we ruined our lives, perhaps others,
too?
</p>

<p class="btfi">
She has risen from my side, and, slipping off the
cloak and dark kekoi, stands naked, knee-deep
in the brooklet.  Her golden, boyish head, lips
parted, arms raised towards the vertical moon.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The water shines, the rock shines, she shines,
the moon, hard, implacable, reveals us to
ourselves.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The same passion rules us and the strong-<!--lb-->breasted
Kikuyu miles away across the chasm
by the twinkling fire.  We have not run away
from difficulties and pain!  We have not run
away from people, from things!  We have gone
away to satiate passion!  The one inexorable
<span id="p66">fate</span> of this land, and to-morrow she may let
us die.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Long years of heredity and training have blurred
our minds with symbols and creeds, and yet!
and yet!
</p>

<p class="btfi">
That slight silver form quivers in the night
air; with a quick plunge beneath the icy waters
she is gone a second, to emerge draped in a
thousand running diamonds and shimmers.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
As we walk back to camp, our minds relieved,
the moon drooping down sends long shadows
across our path, the murmur of the brook dulls,
the mist seems to creep out from unknown
recesses; only the distant tom-tom cleaves the
night breeze with a clearer sob; or have our
veins, our hearts leant the lesson of the drums,
of the red earth, of the vertical moon?
</p>

<p class="btfi">
No ideals!  No hope!  No faith!  but to feel,
to bloom, to rot!
</p>

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch4.sec2">Happy Valley<span class="corr; sic=''">.</span></a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">Happy</span> Valley, Earls Court, the Wanjohi, as
locally known&mdash;famous and infamous by turns<!--lb-->&mdash;habitat
of the wild and free.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
As befits much-talked-of people or places, it
<span id="p67">is</span> simpler, more harmonious than could ever be
expected.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
At the head of the valley&mdash;a mountain&mdash;<!--lb-->Kippipieri,
joined by a cedar-covered saddle to
the Aberdare escarpment, which slowly, effort&shy;lessly
dies in a lazy slope towards Thomson's falls.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The escarpment, wood covered and rugged
green, leafy, mysterious, abruptly loses its feet
in the grassy plain of great undulations slowly
subdued.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
In this d&eacute;cor live a restless crowd of humans,
hardly colonists&mdash;wanderers perhaps, indefatig&shy;able
amusement seekers weary or cast out from
many climes, many countries.  Misfits, neuras&shy;thenics,
of great breeding and charm, who
lacked the courage to grow old, the stamina to
pull up and build anew in this land.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
<span class="sic">Wanjauhi</span>, the river, flowing down from
Kippipieri through their farms, was once said to
flow cocktails, &ldquo;Trinity's&rdquo; no doubt.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Iceless, ceaseless, imitative, perhaps, when at
the bend it also changes its name, Melewa
then, through that effort of misdirected industry,
a factory and once flax lands, through dust and
mud, over rocks and stones to Naivasha, the lake
thirty miles away.
</p>

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch4.sec3"><span id="p68">Night Air<span class="corr; sic=''">.</span></span></a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">It</span> was midnight when I awoke, some noise
or feeling.  I turn over and listen!
</p>

<p class="btfi">
No moon! the earth seems to hold its breath,
a million stars  overhead dancing between the
branches.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The fires have gone low.  I hear the rustle of
parted grasses against some hide.  Creeping out
of the mosquito net, torch in hand, now erect, I
can see the dull forms of the natives, naked,
sleeping on the ground.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
I step over them, between them, towards
the fires.  Waking a sleeping boy near by, he
shuffles on the logs in a half-dream and slumps
down to earth in slumber again.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
My sleep has vanished, so I squat by the fire
listening to the crackles of a dried log and the
subdued murmur of the white ants at work on
some tree near by.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Suddenly a splash awakens me from my trance,
a grunt and then deep, low breathing.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The buffaloes have come sown to the pool
below.  I cautiously wind towards a great tree
that juts out from the overhanging bank far
over the pool.  I cannot see a shadow though I
<span id="p69">hear</span> them.  I know they are less htan ahundred
yards away; a swishing of water as one rolls,
much breathing and puffing as they emerge to
climb the bank.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
A sudden touch by my side, a shady figure
close to mine, a light fragrance in the air.  She
has left him in the tent to feel and kiss the night.
Not a sound, not a word; There we stand think&shy;ing
and listening.  Far away across the valley
a jackal yelps, a hyena calls from time to time.
A loud purr on the veld as some lion tries to
baffle his prey.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Insensibly her shoulders close to mine; nearer,
nearer, comes the hyena's call, till I feel her
throbbing through the silk pyjamas, beneath the
golden skin.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The cough of the charging lion makes her
shiver; as a late moon rises above the ridge one
vagrant beam silvers her lips turned to mine.
</p>

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch4.sec4">Time and Space<span class="corr; sic=''">.</span></a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">I thought</span> I'd be through before sundown,
but the road was awful and the rain coming
down in sheets.  Towards nine o'clock I see a
light; I've only been up this road once, and am
<span id="p70">about</span> lost, so I turn off, and after a hundred
yards stop in front of a low bungalow, heralded
by a dozen dogs.  A man comes out on the porch.
After telling me where I am, he insists I should
come in to supper and stay the night as he says
the road is practically impassable further on, even
in the daylight.  Some boy takes my bag and
I go in.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
A huge room dimly lit, a fire of enormous
logs at one end.  As I warm myself, whisky and
soda in hand, I look about&mdash;how different from
the ordinary Kenya home.  The walls, entirely
built of great logs one upon another, climbing
to a ceilingless roof.  Not a piece of European
furniture, not a picture, not a photograph.  The
fireplace of rough-hewn stone, a blackened beam,
and above, the towering Kudu head.  Nothing
but skins on the floor.  What a collection:
from where I sit I can see lion, a tiger and bear
skins.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
My hosts sees my astonishment.  &ldquo;All the
furniture has been made on the place.  You see
I'm rather a wanderer, and moving furniture
is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;  He shrugs his shoulders.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Supper is served.  While I eat he sits in front
of the fire, prodding the logs absently.  I study
<span id="p71">him;</span> somehow his personality is familiar; that
sturdiness of figure, set determination of face,
clean-shaven paleness contrasting with tanned
hands.  A man who has always worn a hat, who
has worked by his strength in the open; a
slightly rolling walk stepping high off the ground,
calm grey eyes.  I join him by the fireside.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
What a personality this house asserts. A long
the wall rifles glisten; out of the room emerge
heads, skulls, antlers, an astounding collection:
beside an eland, a black buck fom India, above, a
puku, a markhor from Thibet, and facing each
other from opposite ends of the room, a moose,
an African buffalo.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The table I rest my glass on is a Buganda
drum, while on the two posts holding up the
fireplace beam are nailed witch doctor masks
from West Africa.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
In the red glow of the crumbling logs I realise
my host must be older than I thought at first,
the lines on his face and around his eyes, years of
exposure and rough life.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
We talk of Kenya, then of life through the
world.  I tell of places I've seen, hoping to hear
what he is; slowly he thaws: &ldquo;I was lonely
to-night; I am glad the fates bade you stop.
<span id="p72">I</span> have wandered so I have no home, this seems
only a resting place,&rdquo; and as he speaks pictures
come to his lips: his youth way out in the
west, a small town in Wyoming, stories of cattle
wars, gold rushes, rodeos, of Saskatchewan and
the Yukon; of shooting frays at the Golden
Gate; of emeralds and rubies up the Yangtse
Kiang, of training a troop of horse for an Indian
hill rajah, of slowly drifting down through
India; of the day in Madras during the riots, of
men killed slowly swelling in the sun.  Of the
contract for work in East Africa, of Mombasa;
of the building of the railway, of Tsavo, and the
driving of the coolies, of the war, of German
officers and African soldiers, and after all he
stops.  I question: &ldquo;Have you never been
home?&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="btfi">
&ldquo;Well, I don't think I'd find much to go back
to: my father rode for the H.F. Bar near Sheri&shy;dan,
and mother slung hash at the hotel, and that
was fifty years ago.&rdquo;  He sits and stares.  I pace
the floor, visions dazzling me.  &ldquo;My boy, you're
lucky you have people to go back to.  Don't
let them stray form you, go see them every few
years.&rdquo;  &ldquo;But have you no friends?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Well,
a few: some in Australia, some in China, some
<span id="p73">here</span>, don't see them often though.  Don't
know that I want to now much; you see, I'm a
&lsquo;bum,&rsquo; run sheep fifty thousand head.  I've
no use for sheep, but cattle don't seem to run
good here.  Sometimes things seem finished.
It does me good to see young fellows like you.
I guess I'll go down to the Gilgil Club next
Sunday; nature there is always new, though
I feel I've seen the world.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The candle gutters and spits, the logs are low.
I see a lonely old man; through fifty or more
years he has shot it out with life, and now shivers
by his fire.
</p>

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch4.sec5">An Interlude<span class="corr; sic=''">.</span></a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">The</span> sentry passes up and down the walk, his
naked feet noiseless on the packed earth.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Government House sleeps.  The night is
warm; the jasmine and the hibiscus shower
scent from the heaven, and low down, beyond,
the great lake shimmers under the moon.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
I cannot sleep, so throwing on a Somali shawl
I slip out into the garden for a cigarette and a
feel of the cool breeze on my burning skin.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
A window creaks; I look up and a draped
<span id="p74">form</span> pushes out a small shape, telling it to be a
clever girl.  As I watch, a small dog is clever,
then wanders along the verandah and falls
down to another, slightly below the first.  Soon
the draped form, rather a nice draped form,
comes out and calls.  Alas! the small clever
one can't get back, though it struggles and
whines.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
What a fuss, what a pother then occurs in the
upper room, but there's no way to it, she must
be retrieved by way of the room below.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Now a knocking is heard, and a bashful colonel
trembles to this day at the risk he ran when
that daring draped form crossed his room and
returned, carrying her darling.  The romance
missed fire; it needs more than a dog to make
history in the land of the elephant!
</p>

<p class="btfi">
I wander about, slowly descending to the
lakeside where I sit a moment, soon to be chased
away by flying pests.  As I come back, I hear
two voices; others parade under the moon&shy;beams.
Voices carry at night.  An irate wife
upbraids a penitent husband, &ldquo;Hunting is all
right in its way, but it's painfully ridiculous to
chase three days with the best Government
Shikaree only to wound an eland in the tail.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="btfi">
<span id="p75">To-night</span> is humorous&mdash;Africa's form of humour
is not apt to be light.  I'll retire, or she might
try and get me stabbed by the sentry.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
So funny, don't you know!

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">Earth's</span> cracks seem to go down to some eternal
fire; grass stems shiver and break; leaves
corkscrew back on their branches; brown and
desolate are the hills, grey and desolate are the
plains.  The end of the dry season.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The antelope travel each night miles to slake
their thirst.  The river has dried up.  The
elephant cannot dig to water; even the industrious
rhino, after hours of spade work in the river
bed, leaves a ten-foot well discontentedly, to
trek twenty miles to the waterhole.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
At these times the patient, sun-bearing, thorn-<!--lb-->torn,
mile-weary sporsman gets his recompense.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Around the waterhole, some truce declared,
the animals come to quench their thirst and
wearily tell tales of desolation and waste.  The
giant kudu from the hills, his twirling horns
towering above him in great curves, stamps his
foot with impatience and tells of a thirty mile
trek through the scrub, of his waterfalls gone
dry, of his favourite shades thin and uninviting.
The gazelle from across the plain frets and
<span id="p80">fights</span> his brother, his coat is mussed and dusty,
his feet are sore, while his doe, with melancholy
eyes, nuzzles her thin trembling lawn.  Who can
tell which of them will live when the rains come.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
A lonely giraffe cow straddles her legs and
bends her knees for a twenty minute drink.  The
elephant shuffle against each other with sounds
of scraping bark.  A red-eyed tiang bull eyes a
lioness with panting cubs across the quiet pool.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
A striped hyena looks hungrily at the gaunt,
heaving sides of an old <span class="corr; sic='battled'">battle</span>-scarred half-dead
buffalo; the carrion crow and the vultures
share his wonder, while two sapient old marabout
storks, one leg down to the wet sand, boredly
snap their beaks in contempt.  They know.
At this season the carrion feeders of the land wax
fat and prosperous.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Last-comer, dealer in ill tidings, tongue
hanging, coat unlicked, eyes glazed, limps down
leading his herd, the eland, king of antelopes.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
He has travelled far, bringing the news: the
fires are lit on the plains fifty miles away.  He
has trekked day and night, migrating.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The vultures fly away pleasedly remembering
past feasts at such times, even the marabout
storks show interest, drink, to depart silently
<span id="p81">through</span> the air with great swinging strokes of
their giant wings.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Having drunk, all go; go down to the south,
towards the land of the great rivers, migration
from fire towards water.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The elephants sway on three legs, rubbing a
still sore sole on a rugged leg, remembering the
agony when the natives fired a circle around
them some months back.  The bones of half the
herd rattle to the scraping of some straying
jackal in that murderous dip where they were
caught.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Hunching their shoulders, they glide away
on their three hundred mile trip, a swinging
pace, ten miles to the hour, till, in the shadows of
the great river, they will plunge and splash,
squirting themselves in trumpeting, jocose delight.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Ten hours later, roaring up the valley, a wall
of fire rushes, crackles, assaults the hills, crashes
along ridges, the rocks crackling like gun shots, the
smaller birds of prey above it, in front of it, pick&shy;ing
the terrified scurrying rodents with one swoop.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The plain is now blackened, smooth as your
hand; one or two tortured thorn trees rear their
scarred branches to the blazing sun, while a root
smoulders along the earth.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
<span id="p82">That</span> once pleasant waterhole is now bleached;
the spreading trees have lost their leaves, and
soon the small remaining puddle will waft its
way towards the distant range, a fleecy cloudling.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
That night the wind comes up as some furnace
blast, carrying sparks and stenches of roast flesh.
High up on the hills lines of flickering lights
waver and carry on over the crest their work of
destruction and purification.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The tired hunter ceases his vigil, the danger
is passed; he unfolds his tent, eats a smoked
unpalatable meal and tries to rest.  As he dreams
and mumbles in his impatient sleep, the heat
beats up from the burnt earth, every hour
getting more unbearable.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
And then a ping on his taut tent canvas, like
the pinched cord of a violin; another, and again
another.  Awakened, he jumps up and lifts his
face to the large squashy raindrops; then a deluge.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Sunrise is late, the earth steams, a haze of
blue hides the hills, and still it pours.  Just in
time, those fires, to kill all the insect pests, their
larv&aelig;, their eggs, all awaiting the rains to burst
forth in their biting, stinging millions.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Under his tent the white man reads, the rain-<!--lb-->soaked
canvas hums gently under the falling
<span id="p83">drops</span>, a trench carries the skimming water away.
The white man reads, awaiting the rebirth of the
land.  Patiently he turns the leaves of his book,
unworried he sleeps, eats and reads, the roaring
of the stream a dull accompaniment to his
resting thoughts.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
One morning the sun shines bright, the hills
are turned to green; on every branch buds
grow sticky and burst forth, from every nook
and cranny undreamt of seeds swell, pushing up
and out a million greens.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The cooing of the ring doves in the awakened
trees by the rushing mud stream, the call of the
parrots swinging from thorn bush to thorn bush;
the sudden drop of the vulture way out across
the valley; a swoop of white as the egrets come
to drink.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The white man smiles and stretches, throwing
the books into a tin case to wait till other rains.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The game is back.  Another season has begun.
</p>

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch5.sec2">Xmas Eve.</a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">Christmas Eve.</span>  Seven thousand miles away
the cranberries bubble in a pot; naked over&shy;stuffed
poultry await their doom in the larder;
<span id="p84">crackers</span> in their pink and blue kimonos closely
pressed in boxes sleep till the morrow; stockings
swing to and fro in the icy wind blowing down
the chimney; flecks of snow frozen to the
window-pane make weird lace designs.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Dinner, solitary, cold guinea fowl and beans
from a tin, is over.  Homesick for homesickness<!--lb-->&mdash;you
are so blue.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
From time to time a patter of naked feet on
the baked earth; now and then a voice raised
in song; then as the moon rises dead white over
the palms, the tom-tom murmurs, breaks out
to murmur again.  Some native dance, you
think what a bore, another night of troubled rest.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
As the drums warm up by the giant beacon
fire, the murmur rises into a shout and voices
wail and crash.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Uneasy, you shift your seat, cross your legs,
light a cigarette.  The thump, thump of naked
feet drill into your brain.  All your boys have
deserted camp.  You might as well go over and
see what the blighters are doing.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
In an immense oval space hundreds upon
hundreds of naked bodies are milling around;
on the outskirts the whitewashed huts reflect
red tints from the bonfire.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
<span id="p85">A</span> naked grey-bearded figure salaams, a neck&shy;lace
of crocodiles' teeth hanging to its knees.
The decorous chief who received you in white
flowing robes this noon.  &ldquo;Will the Effendi have
a chair?  No&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;  You prefer the earth and
you sit cross-legged, your back against the wall
of a hut.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The dance goes on, a shrieking native guitar
gives the cue and a hundred voices chant and
rise and fall.  Thump, thump, ring, ring, as the
professional dancers join the fray, wrapped to
their thighs with jingling bells.  On, on, up, up,
till you feel your heart is going to break. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Crash&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all dulls to the murmur of the tom-<!--lb-->toms
rubbed and smoothed.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Into your brain creeps some physical desire,
some urge that numbs your senses, pumps your
blood.  Your hand bets time.  As it swells,
you swell, and as it rolls, you roll.  A thousand
maddened battles course in your veins.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Slaughter and human sacrifices of the times of
your Druid ancestors call for more blood.  Blood
to feed the tom-toms, to blacken their sides and
shine their throbbing skins.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
It needs all your will power to stay silent on
the ground.  Around and around they go, the
<span id="p86">chant</span> rising like the surge of the Atlantic when
its mighty rollers break; and then, the hissing
of the surf on a scorched coral beach.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Then smells, smells of rancid oil on human
sweating flesh; smells of benjoin and myrrh
rising from the braziers; smells of the peppery
dust which shimmers in the moonbeams.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Your nostrils dilate, your mouth opens.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Desire battles with will.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Smells of sexual fury as women weave through
the lines of men, smells as their whirling bodies
sway against each other.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Your two arms outstretched, palms on the
throbbing earth, your nails, your fingers <span class="sic">imbedded</span>.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Some irresistible desire breaks your back
towards the ground.  Down, down, till your
lips touch the earth.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Kiss of an eternal Mother.  Salt on your lips,
a new dawn in your soul&mdash;appeased you rest.

The fresh whip of an October dawn.  The gentle
touch of someone's red lips chilled by iced
champagne.

<span class="sc">Evening</span> comes.  Soon the sun will set behind
the Imatong Hills, now purple-crowned with
gold.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Sitting outside the rest-house, a wall of rock
behind us and the ground sloping away at our
feet far across the valley.  It looks like some
surging sea, mile upon mile of thorn bush and
scrub, some tumultuous boiling cauldron.  The
only relief is a winding band of darker green,
just a shadow sometimes, like a low wall at others
emerging above the sagelike plain; the Kideppo
river winds thus towards the sweltering north,
down towards the Nile.  It is only a ribbon of
water these days; some places flowing deep
down buried in the sand, from time to time to
emerge in tranquil limpid pools bathing the
roots of some giant tree.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
As evening comes, life awakens from a torrid
day.  Since the sun capped the wall of rock
behind, the earth has baked, the cracks opening
larger every hour; even the ants have retired
to rest, not a bird on the wing.  Now at last
cooler, the world seems to <span class="sic">breath</span>, turn over
and stretch.  A green pigeon circles the rest-<!--lb--><span id="p89">house</span>
and alights on a wild-fig tree.  A chorus
of barks far up on the rock wall, a living simian
chain across the chasm.  The baboons move
across; as the last one is over, the rope detaches
itself and swings towards the opposite ledge;
hand over fist, each living link climbs to the foot&shy;hold
and is gone.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Your heart catches.  &ldquo;Did you hear it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Your companion's face is tense and white.
Then it was true, no illusion of a sun-touched
mind.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
No, there it is again.  From far away over the
miles of waving scrub it comes now distinct.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Peal upon peal.  My lord the elephant has
come to drink.

<p class="btfi">
Silently you turn away.  &ldquo;Have a drink.

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch5.sec5">Papyrus.</a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">Slowly</span> we are poled along a canal cut through
the swamp.  Our tent is pitched on a rough
platform thrown across two dug-out trees; the
boys at the other end have built themselves a
stove in which a fire burns, fed with green
leaves.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
<span id="p90">The</span> smoke trailing out behind us merges into
the haze; a faint odour of benjoin and amber
drifts around, breaking the monopoly of the
swampy breaths.

<p class="btfi">
Three naked bronze figures to a side toil up
and down, at their shoulders a long bamboo,
which bends under their weight as they pole
us along.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
In our tent under our mosquito nets we lie
sweltering.  The flap outstretched to catch any
breath of air only seems to concentrate the heat
waves, and through it all a purring sound as
the waves clutch the dugouts and slip aside<!--lb-->&mdash;now
and then a hiss like some great snake
at bay, and the tall papyrus bends down to let
us by.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
As I think of this week, now gone, spent in the
marshes in the interest of His Majesty's Law, one
sense, one feeling pervades all; one impression,
one fact&mdash;Papyrus.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Mile upon mile of papyrus cut by these canals,
mudfish feeding on papyrus parasites, kingfishers
waved to and fro on papyrus stems watching for
the fish, lechwe and sititunga awakened from
their beds of dried papyrus to jump from
clump to clump, invisible, the long stalks swinging
<span id="p91">back</span> behind them as they go.  A leaden sky
overhead cut by a flight of Kavirondo cranes
who circle and alight on these rushes, birds
also topped by a crest of gold like the papyrus.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Ever the same for a week.  The counsels
taking place on the platform, with naked savages
on floating trees bringing woven reed baskets
filled with papyrus flower to wish away the Evil
Eye.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
A monotonous song rises and swings, the polers
grow listless, and as it rolls and widens the
sun dies far away across the swamp.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The gaunt figures in an immemorial gesture
bury the pole, push, then pull, to time with the
swinging chant.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Slaves of the swamp, for ten thousand years,
they have poled the Pharaohs from the north,
their destinies unchanged though a child from the

slushy underfoot, crunching dead things, killing
living ones.  Vines and trailing orchids clutching
at your clothes.

As the beads of sweat roll and drop, one's
topee drooping in the great silence, miasmic
scents sway visibly between the stalks of the
giant fern.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Clutching a rifle, steely, deadly, a machine,
but no solace to one's blind terror of the unknown.
One's heart stops with the cracking of a branch,
while a great limb with the tiredness of centuries
slowly detaching itself, bends and crashing
across the path breaks the back of the coal-black
leopard waiting for you in the trail.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
An elephant shrieks and shrieking passes by;
a clamour of sound instantly stilled.  You know
not whose shadow moves in the gloom on your

frozen sweat you push on mumbling incanta&shy;tions
of your youth, or of some weird, soul-search&shy;ing
belief of some previous life.  Behind you the

A flicker of light ahead, which grows; now
we are just outside a clearing in the forest.
We crouch, making ourselves comfortable, seeing
yet unseen.  District officer, policeman, and
twenty native police; they fidget until a whis&shy;pered
order goes down the line.

<p class="btfi">
The clearing is empty except for a native
tending a fire.  In the foreground, empty space,
a half-moon. Then between two towering
totems with stacks of wood at their feet, the fire;
behind, an altar of some soft stone, stained
red in patches, its table slanting downwards
from back to front, two diagonal furrows crossing
in the centre; at its back two steps of polished
wood or black stone, upon them a carved, gro&shy;tesque,
grimacing figure, seated, arms out&shy;stretched,
entirely plated with gold.

<span id="p94">A</span> rustle&mdash;and by the path come the faithful,

the civilized, the powerful of the tribes.  One
or two we recognise, prosperous and hardworking
tradesmen, devotees of the Mission Church.

The slave of the fire heaps the logs on, logs of
scented wood, the flames leap higher.  A blue
haze of smoke dims the image behind.

<p class="btfi">
The slave wears anklets, joined by a shining
chain of steel.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The faithful are seated in orderly, serried ranks,
a man, a woman, and so on, four feet apart, ranks
four feet behind each other, facing the fire.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Suddenly a blinding flash of light from the fire.
When our eyes are calm again.  At the foot of
the altar we can see a huddled figure in the
same hierarchic pose as the image above, masked,
a shock of ostrich feathers in lieu of hair.  As
it rises, the whole figure reveals itself; a long
robe from shoulder to knees caught at the waist
by a shining girdle of stones, from arms to
finger tips, gauntled in gold, its legs the same.
The worshippers bow down to the earth between
<span id="p95">their</span> crossed legs, their shining backs glistening
like tortoises in the flame light.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
A slow murmur swells till it is like the dull
thumping of the surf on a beach a mile away.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
As the chorus grows, my companion shakes
his head&mdash;the words are in the forgotten language
of some long dead civilization.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The figure slips out smoothly before the fire.
As it whirls and dances the chant rises and falls,
all the congregation swaying to the time.  The
rhythm grows faster and from a corner a chorus
of tom-toms breaks out.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Drops fall from the trees and the cold is good
on one's face.  The fascination of the scene is
indescribable.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The golden figure twists and whirls.  Above
the wailing chant, above the crooning of the
tom-toms we catch the clicking rhythm of
the golden plates.  Always faster and faster,
till with a crash it stops.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
We have been warned, and have come pre&shy;pared.
I make a sign.  The policemen stiffen,
green with fear; the gaunt old sergeant kneels,
bringing his rifle to his side.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Now the golden figure weaves through the
serried ranks of worshippers&mdash;all prostrate, their
<span id="p96">faces</span> on the ground.  The chant breaks out
again, but with terror in its voice.  The figure
stoops, touches a back.  A wild shriek and a
young girl leaps from the ground beneath the
figure only to be seized on either side by two men.
The chant rises again, drowning her cries, and
she is brought forward, her hands tied behind
her back; the men return to their places.  She
is a huddled figure at the feet of the idol behind
the fire.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Now the golden arms circle her, and she is
drawn like a feather off the ground, carried and
left writhing on the altar.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
We are ready.  As one of the golden arms rises
above her the light catches on the curved knife.
I whisper the word.  Crack!  The golden figure
crumples&mdash;hell on earth breaks loose, the police&shy;men
catching and binding all they can.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
My companion and I rush to the prostrate
figure; wrenching off the mask we stagger.
There, dead, lies one of our dearest friends,
beautiful in the glory of her youth, her golden
hair.  African born and bred, what witchcraft
has wrought this?
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Thank God she's dead.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The flames hungrily lick towards her feet.
</p>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">We</span> pass down Muthaiga slope, cross the bridge,
then up a hill and down again, holding our
noses as we pass Lord D.'s slaughter houses, then
up Sixth Avenue, and around the K.A.R. Lines.
Nairobi looks quite presentable at night, the
dim lights hide its <span class="sic">dullness</span>, its dust remains
unseen, the glaring shop windows are dark.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
After a good dinner, a very good dinner, we
are taking out a newly arrived American party
to see the wild animals in the Game Reserve
by night.  In the sea behind Cyrus J. Houfton,
of Piqua, Ohio, Mrs. W. K. Levysohn, his
sister, widow of an enterprising sheeny who
broke into Piqua and raised himself to eminence
on the debris; between them George Black, the
big game shot and white hunter&mdash;I'm driving
with Miss Muriel Houfton by my side.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
They arrived to-day to shoot big game.  &ldquo;I
want a colelction to beat the one that puff-<!--lb-->bellied
Larchmont brought home last year,&rdquo;
said Cyrus J. during the presentation interview
at Safariland this morning.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
<span id="p100">Black</span> and I have been detailed off to deliver
the goods.  &ldquo;And, young fellows, I've made my
pile and am ready to spend it, but no hanging
around clubs and introducing lounge lizards to
Muriel while we're out here!  I've had enough
trouble making the simoleons not to know that
buying off prospective <span class="sic">son-in-laws</span> is an expensive
business, so go right ahead and get us out in the
big, wide country and you'll find me a bear for
punishment after I get my second wind.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Black and I, after much discussion with Safari&shy;land
and others, staged this party, which sup&shy;posedly
will inoculate them all with buck fever.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
We bump along the track into the reserve, the
dash-board lamp shows up the perfect profile of
&ldquo;Dear Muriel.&rdquo;  She is a &ldquo;peach,&rdquo; as her &ldquo;home
town beau<span class="sic">'</span>s&rdquo; would say.  I wonder how they will
stand Safari?  How much fighting there will be?
And everything else one asks oneself before a job.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
An exclamation from Black as two huge spotted
hyenas cross the headlight beams, and again
some more, perhaps they're due for a &ldquo;hyena
ring&rdquo;; it would be just my luck to bump that
unique sight the day I had a sweet &ldquo;clear cut&rdquo;
&ldquo;jeune fille&rdquo; aboard.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
As the game comes up or away, Black names
<span id="p101">them:</span> <span class="sic">wildebeeste</span>, jumping hare, then some
&ldquo;kongoni,&rdquo; a gazelle.  As we round a curve, I
stop the car; a few feet away, crossing the track,
a herd of &ldquo;impala&rdquo; turns and stares, hundreds
of shining eyes; now and again they leap high
into the air over each other's backs.  Cyrus J.
is &ldquo;jittering&rdquo; in excitement, and the noble
Mrs. Levysohn throbs the atmosphere with
&ldquo;Muriel dears.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The girl is quiet and silent, nodding as I
explain in a low voice.  She looks and looks, her
hands clasped together, fingers locking and inter&shy;locking.
As we turn back she glances up and
smiles; green eyes below the white brow and
massed piles of smoke-blue hair.  In the front
seat we're silent, lulled by the purr of the engine
and the chatter of Mrs. Levysohn; an inter&shy;jection
or two from Cyrus J. in true &ldquo;hard&shy;boiled&rdquo;
manner.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
We drop them at the New Stanley Hotel, say
good night; he calls after us: &ldquo;We start bright
and early day after to-morrow; I'll see you at
Safariland in the morning at nine.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Good
night, Mr. Black, good night, Mr. Meighan.
I've liked this evening, and now you must teach
me to shoot.  Don't let father do too much,
<span id="p102">his</span> heart is weak; as for Aunt Zo&euml;, she gets
awfully hot and bothered; I count on you two to
help me keep them well and contented, they're
mighty difficult at times.&rdquo;  This Safari is taken
out of our hands.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Up the hill towards the club we go&mdash;we'd
often heard of the ways of young America!
This is going to be &ldquo;some experience.&rdquo; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
</p>

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch6.sec2">Dreaming.</a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">I sit</span> my feet towards the fire, my table over
my legs; sun set an hour ago, bathed, changed,
dinner finished.  I sit, feet towards the fire,
mind wandering, pipe in mouth.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
I am detached from this world; on a bare
space overlooking a ravine my camp clings to the
mountain side; every rollable object washes by
now in the creek far below.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
What a sunset it was; the last rays of light
gilding my tent, the peak above mauve and pink,
a cloud or two hung like cotton wool to its side,
above the tip of snow.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
One last sunray strayed up somehow through
the cedars in the ravine to light a patch of
bamboo, a threshing of gold slivers.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
<span id="p103">I</span> can just see the fire over the table, the logs
are damp, and the smoke curls and twists accord&shy;ing
to the sighs of the unfelt breeze.  I am
tired, my eyes hypnotised, dully watch the logs
turn red, then white, then red again, dissolving
into embers.  I grow numb, and the smoke
comes nearer.  It takes a shape, wraith-like at
first, then slowly matter seems to form, a face,
dark brooding eyes, pale green, a supple neck,
small red-painted mouth, then the curling auburn
hair, a dress fits itself, green like the bamboo
shoots, blue-tinted in its folds like the curling
stream far below.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
My heart grows cold, my head goes round.
That my loss is true.  The Bwana sleeps.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The bush-buck barks by the river far below, and
away up in the mountain an old rhino snorts,
cursing the white man who, in his sorrow, taints
the mountain air.
</p>

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch6.sec3">White Hunting.</a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">Our</span> camp is set near the winding river, under a
great clump of trees, beds lined up like a dor&shy;mitory,
ground sheets between, mosquito nets
swinging up to the supple bamboo poles (our
<span id="p104">tents</span> rolled up in their sacks, the climate making
them obnoxious).  The natives have built us a
grass &ldquo;banda,&rdquo; rectangular, all sides open, the
high pointed roof coming down to about four
feet from the ground.  In this by day we sleep,
feed or read; it is sunproof and very airy,
every breath of wind seems caught and trained
through it, the temperature thirty degrees lower
than outside.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
After a long day's stalking in the sun we are
relaxed in arm-chairs around the table, talking
and smoking, words dropped, picked up and then
passed on.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
A motley crowd: an African soldier, an
English diplomat, an American millionaire, two
wives, a stepdaughter, youth, beauty and life;
I don't count, just an obsever, a hired white-<!--lb-->hunter,
but they are pretty nice to me on the
whole.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The women are very tired and half asleep in
their chairs; drowsily they shiver as a fly lights
on their bare arms.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Their words seem meaningless to me; somehow
to-day I've felt their personalities.  For the first
time their true selves were revealed.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Just before dawn we came up to a herd of
<span id="p105">elephant</span> about half a mile away and waited;
as sunrise broke we closed in.  A cow herd, only
two shootable bulls, not big at that.  We divided
up&mdash;I took the American and his stepdaughter,
the soldier took the four others.  The diplomat
got his at thirty yards.  A clean brain shot.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Ours was fussing about, breaking branches, and
would not stay still.  The American tried for the
heart; at the shot the animal whirled and came
on like a steam engine; I didn't know exactly
where he was hit, but he was coming, and coming
fast.  The girl was splendid, took one step to
the right of her father, and shot both barrels at
the oncoming head.  He tripped in his stride,
staggering forward on to his trunk with a lurch.
He was dead two yards from where we had
stood.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
I quickly reloaded my 470, not wanting the
girl to know I had shot.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
We all gathered round the stricken monster;
the other party, having seen the charge, joined us.
As we stood there for the first time, I saw them
as they really are.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The millionaire, well!  Just a millionaire and
a weak old man.  The diplomat, excited, out of
his poise, his slow circulation stirred, more alive
<span id="p106">and</span> conscious than I'd seen him before.  The
soldier, thoughtfully rubbing his shoe on the
animal's trunk; he'd been at it before and knows
what an elephant can do; he's Irish, too, imagina&shy;tive.
His eyes stealing towards two women,
become hard and steely.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
One was leaning on her rifle, teeth clenched
over the full lower lip, eyes grey with unconscious
physical desire, cruelty and.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  The other one,
trembling with suppressed fear and excitement,
was clinging to her gunbearer's arm, nerves all
gone, verging on tears.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
But the girl, a slight flush on her cheeks,
quietly broke her gun, dropped the cartridges,
reloaded: &ldquo;Well, that's that, I feel damned
hungry now.&rdquo;  I could see her hand trembling
at her side.  &ldquo;Well, unkie, I'll race you back
to camp for breakfast.&rdquo;  Calm and collected;
self-control.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
She is a thoroughbred right through; never
permits a cloud to gather among the others, runs
the Safari on smooth wheels, no easy job with so
big a party.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
As we sit, I watch her: our eyes meet, and she
catches me at it; her smile seems to include all
the gentle humour of our position.  She glances
<span id="p107">meaningly</span> towards the river, and I break the
spell, and all of us troop down for the evening
dip.
</p>

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch6.sec4">Moon and Water!</a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">We're</span> up to-night, having set a blind near the
waterhole.  After a heavy dinner we trundle
over, the boys loaded with sandwiches, bottles,
stools and guns, escort us to our lair; they de&shy;part
swinging a Safari lantern through the night.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Fitz and I have two weeks' leave and have come
down to the Masa&iuml; reserve to try and <span class="corr; sic='shoo'">shoot</span>
lions; as we have a car, a box-bodied, battered
offspring of Detroit, we have pushed on to the
dry country and are spending a few days in the
vicinity of a rather muddy waterhole.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
By day, our chosen lair seemed perfect; cut
out of a big thorn bush with a spreading tree
overhead, slits shaped so as to afford a view and
possibilities of shooting.  At night we seem less
comfortable, the thorns seem longer, the lair
too small, our implements unending in their
rattles.  At last towards eight, we seem to settle
down, and I take the watch, Fitz trying to dose
in his chair.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
<span id="p108">However</span> used my eyes get to these nights,
the dark is such that, at ten feet, nothing is
recognisable; by contrast, the stars seem to
blaze. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Idly, between the branches, I try
to locate those I ought to know.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Somehow something seemed changed, what
could it be?  Preconsciousness of danger,
proximity of some beast?  I could not say.
Suddenly a shaft of light slips over the hill as
the moon tops the ridge above the thorn trees
on the other side of the pool.  That conscious&shy;ness
of light just before sunrise or moonrise is
absolutely physical, like a presence.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Step by step the moon crawls up its hill, un&shy;folding
a new panorama, unexpected, different
entirely from what it looked by day.  The pool
shimmers, wavelets grow, and as phantoms
emerging from the gloom, I am suddenly conscious
of things, vague shapes, now an outline, at last
the whole.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
I wake up Fitz, it's a sight for the gods.  A
score or so of Thomson's gazelle are standing,
drinking in the pool; their dainty feet break that
silvery surface without a sound; one old buck,
what a beautiful pair of horns, stands guard by the
water side quickly clancing here and there.
<span id="p109">Behind</span> them, statue-like against the dark trees,
four water-buck; one male has spreading annu&shy;lated
horns at least thirty inches long; his hoofs
shine in the moonlight and his dark coat glistens,
in the pink of condition; the does, wide ears
outstretched, listen by his side.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The gazlles &ldquo;freeze&rdquo;; what can they have
heard?  All there poised for flight, it is like some
dead landscape of the German school.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Tap, tap, a slight rattle of stones and then,
with a clatter down the opposite bank, come a
herd of zebras; their stripes seem of silver and
jet, an old stallion takes into his fancy to roll in
the water, splashing, kicking he comes out
covered with mud.  They don't stay long, on
some trek maybe.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Again towards the pool come the water-<!--lb-->buck
only to &ldquo;freeze&rdquo; again, this time a small
troop of kongoni, high-shouldered and sloping
quarters.  They look dull brown instead of the
red-gold natural tint.  Soon they are joined by
their near cousins, the topi, with patchy hides
of grey and brown.  They drink and splash,
while their offspring romp with each other's
shadows in and out among the trees.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Last, slinks down for a sly drink, a huge spotted
<a name="p110"><span class="sic">hyena</span></a>.  At first we thought it was a lioness.
In his wake scurry two jackals; his coming taints
the breeze.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Suddenly a dull rumble in the distance, lives,
grows, falls, the animals alert, by ones, by twos,
in troops fade away; the King of Beasts is
hunting.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
From time to time we hear the roar and a
cough.  Nervous and excited we await his arrival<!--lb-->&mdash;and
waiting, lo! it is dawn.  He has not come!
We collect our chattels, wondering how we have
spent five or six hours intently watching, our
interest held, our senses on the alert; now tired
and shivering we walk briskly back to camp.
</p>

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch6.sec5">Shooting on the Aberdares.</a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">We</span> are camped on a green sward covering the
crest of the bluff; one thousand feet below in the
gorge, a waterfall growls and white mist rises
like smoke between the giant cedars.  From
hill to vale, the dark gauntness of them over&shy;powering
all.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
We arrived at noon, after a four hour climb,
fifteen hundred feet above the plain, nine thousand
above the sea, and above us towers three thousand
<span id="p111">feet</span> of forest and rock.  We are out after bush-<!--lb-->buck,
the beautiful elusive wanderer of forest
glades, and, perhaps, we might meet forest-hog
or bongo, that greatest prize of all.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Three o'clock, time to go.  The boys collect
the equipment and in Indian file we trek out.
Very soon the trees close about us, the N'dorobo
hunter takes the lead.  I follow the two &ldquo;guests&rdquo;
behind.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Two years have passed since I last hunted the
bush-buck, the smell of the forest brings back
memories, memories of things, of people, of days,
of nights.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The winding trail on the side of a hill, so
sombre it might already be night, the maiden-<!--lb-->hair
fern leaning out from the bank to brush your
face with soft dew-speckled fingers, the moss
underfoot cut by the hoofs of the bush-buck
and the pig the tree moss hanging from the
branches overhead, &ldquo;old man's beard,&rdquo; silvery
among these shadows; the giant plantain with
emerald leaves nibbled at the edges.  Pervading
everything the smells, smells of dead wood and
rotting vegetation.  Smells of rancid orchids,
smells of trampled moss, smell of wet, still air.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The going is hard, the forest so thick that we
<span id="p112">must</span> often crawl on hands and knees, up, always
up, towards the bamboo forest.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
At last I call a halt.  My two companions are
purple, puffing, and eyes swimming.  We start
again; the forest thins a little, moss underfoot
changes to grass and nettles appear here and
there, how they sting.  The two sportsmen now
carry their rifles&mdash;we leave the boys behind.
Doubling all precautions we try to find a direction
to the wind; there does not seem to be a breath
of air.  We creep around clumps growing at the
feet of the giant cedars, every sense on the alert.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Suddenly a flash of red across the path, a crack
of breaking dry wood, and immobility again.
A good head.  Bush-buck twenty yards away.
The leading hunter hadn't time to shoot.  I
warned them it wouldn't be easy.  On we twist
and turn along the game trail, the forest clears
like some ill-kept park flung up the mountain
side, the rugged trunks, great columns, sun-<!--lb-->patched
and weary.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The guide &ldquo;freezes&rdquo;; looking down into a
glade we creep up, heads just above the vegeta&shy;tion;
down among the plantains are four forest-<!--lb-->hog,
immense backs grey with dried mud.
There's one good boar, a hundred yards about,
<span id="p113">the</span> hunters steady their guns, elbows on knees,
crack, crack, a miss&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  No, the boar runs fifty
yards and drops.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
But we are actively employed, two for one tree,
two for another.  We wakened from her siesta
an irate old forest rhino, and down the hill she
comes, right in our backs; I just swing clear as
thunderingly she goes by, bumping, slithering
down the slope, nearly squashing the dead pig,
to disappear in the thick bush; leaving a levelled
path behind, she won't stop for half a mile.
Gingerly we climb down, retrieve our implements,
sending the guide back for the boys.  We inspect
the sacrifice, a good size boar, magnificent but
unattractive sight.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
It took thirteen boys to turn the boar over.
After the usual rites, the caravan re-forms and
we trudge home in the red sun to a whistled
tune of some &ldquo;Jim <span class="sic">crow</span>&rdquo; melody.
</p>

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch6.sec6">Buffalo<span class="corr; sic=''">.</span></a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">We</span> were up before dawn, shivering in our light
clothes; in damp, and damp smoky fire beginning
to glow as a shining boy blew and blew.  A
cup of scalding tea and we glided away in single
<span id="p114">file</span>, two trackers ahead, a native between each
of us to hold our faltering footsteps, to be our
eyes, our ears, until the rising sun showed the
over-civilised white man where to step and what to see.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
After half an hour the caravan stopped;
shadows began to show, a slight greening in the
east, a shaft of light and it was dawn, sprung
from heaven in a second to wake the restless
birds and throw open in one great yawn the
gates of light.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
On the banks of a wide sandy river-bed:
bushy trees interspaced with swinging d&ocirc;m
palms rigidly lean over the banks.  A tiny rivulet
of water wanders, twisting about the bed of the
draw.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
A faint low on our right and off we go; the wind
is right, away at our very best pace, it begins
to tell on some of us; Bettina comes up beside
me, lips just apart, dewing about the forehead,
&ldquo;shall we see them soon.&rdquo;  On we go, the
gunbearers have to be hastened, any moment
we may be upon them.  The sand dulls our
footsteps, dragging us at each stride.  Circuiting
a bunch of thorn, cutting across from one bend
of the river to another, at last around a corner
<span id="p115">our</span> trackers freeze; dead still we wait.  A
beckoning and we crawl, about a hundred yards
away up the opposite bank a last large form
scrambles .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. have they seen us?
</p>

<p class="btfi">
We follow down our side, across the yielding
sandy bottom, across the slowly drifting film
of water on the glowing crystal floor, scarcely
wetting our shoes; up the bank with a dreadful
scraping sound and then on at the double, and so,
more rushing behind our guides until we are up
to them, luckily, as here the bush thins and we
see the massive forms wandering along.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Powerful shoulders, sloping rumps, slate grey
in the rising sun.  I make Bettina kneel, she
pants, and her rifle wobbles, but she must shoot
or it will be too late.  A towering bull with
great curved horns shiny and black; not yet old
enough for them to be going back.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
At the crack the whole herd stampedes, but
he holds his ground hit through the shoulder,
there seems a moment of indecision, he does not
know where to look, then like a whirlwind he
comes; less time than it takes to think this
and he is on us.  The dull boom of my 470,
right barrel, then left, he staggers then on again,
Bettina statue-like at my side.  My hands
<span id="p116">seem</span> all thumbs, the cartridges won't go in,
then up and both barrels at it again; again the
stagger, a step, a sudden crumple and with a
throbbing shudder he hits the ground, his legs
twitching still to propel him towards us.  Game
to the last, after he is dead his nerves still drive
him on until his last ounce of blood was pumped
through his heart, the heart of the African
buffalo.  Bettina's 275 solid had gone clean
through the greater arteries above the heart,
and he came on still, my four solid bullets from a
470 broke a shoulder and tore him through and
through, heart, lungs, guts, and yet he came on
until he was dead.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
We walked away, Bettina and I.  Back in
camp we were still silent; the others went on
after some antelope they saw further on, hoping
but not saying that they might catch the herd
that had stampeded.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The native brought in the skin and the head,
great shining horns.  Bettina's Somali gun&shy;bearer
is wild with joy.  As I write he capers
around shouting on Allah to witness the prowess
that is his to have been beside the memsahib
when the buffalo charged.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Bettina in the shade, sitting on a rock; her
<span id="p117">helmet</span> tilted over her eyes, her chin on her knees
drawn up, one long hand playing, finger after
finger, with a necklace of amber beads strung on
scarlet silk.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Wondering of what .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. perhaps of the &ldquo;Am&shy;bassadeurs&rdquo;
or of &ldquo;Zellis&rdquo; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as the fever
bird wakes up across the plain: ding-dong,
ding-dong, doc&mdash;and then on some.  We are in a
bad country, fifteen grains of quinine to-night.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Wondering what.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
</p>

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch6.sec7">An Ivory Trail<span class="corr; sic=''">.</span></a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">We</span> have been out on a hunting trip with a
party of Americans who have come this far to
get elephant.  They have suffered a long journey
with porters and then by dug-out canoe.  No
luck so far.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Bettina is pleased to see some of her erstwhile
compatriots; they gossip of Broadway and the
Great White lights far into the night.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Starting at dawn we marched for three
hours until it became too hot even to think,
camping at last by a little water hole hidden in a
murderous clump of thorns and twining vegeta&shy;tion.
We crossed tracks of the &ldquo;Tembo&rdquo;
<span id="p118">during</span> the march, a day old I should think.  We
settle down for the night, trying to collect strength
and patience for the morrow.  Boys have been
sent out in every direction scouting for news
or fresh spoor; they ought to be here soon as
the sun is going down across the plain in a glory
of golden sparks.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The safari huddle about the fire, their heads
in the twirling smoke, trying to protect themselves
from the million flying pests come from evrey
nook and cranny that conceals a particle of water.
At the hour of the dying day they surge forth in
the search of the warm blood necessary to their
welfare.  And the glory of the last sunray
passes unnoticed amid much slapping of bare
parts and curses to boys who will not hurry
with the mosquito boots.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
We started early before sunrise.  The scouts
brought news of a herd going westwards, we
followed their trail all spread with half-chewed
branches and still warm droppings.  We could
never get up within even dust-seeing distance,
and soon we were deadbeat, so we stopped.
They cannot have been more than two or three
miles ahead of us, but always out of reach.  We
must have covered twenty miles at least, head&shy;<a name="p119">ing
continually</a> westwards towards the Congo.
I expect they will soon turn south-east towards
the Nile as there is no water further on for about
two hundred miles, and they did not drink last
night, or so swears my Somali tracker.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
We are at the last water hole.  I suppose we
are in for a pretty disturbed night, being in a
thickly rhino-populated region&mdash;they have no
other place to drink.  As the Safari only caught
up at five-thirty this evening, the camp is a little
rudimentary; no protection.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Against all rules of the game we had an un&shy;disturbed
night's rest except for a jackal trying
to steal one of m'pishi's saucepans.  We set
out again before dawn, and after an hour's trudg&shy;ing
in <span class="corr; sic='indian'">Indian</span> file were brought to a halt by an  <!--It's capitalized on pp. 111 and 133.-->
excited waving in front of us.  Our theory had
been right&mdash;they were coming back.  At first
cracking of branches and low, deep intestinal
rumblings, then the unmistakable odour.  We
moved for position well to windward of the herd.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
As the sun rose we were all in place.  The first
to get a shot was Bettina.  Head on at about
thirty yards, his mighty shoulders well above
the scrub.  He caught sight of her the moment
before she fired, and had just started to raise his
<span id="p120">trunk</span> when the double crash of the 470 brought
him to his knees and Bettina flat on her back.
Luckily he was knocked stone cold as there was a
moment's confusion.  Where was the herd?
Not a sound.  As we moved over to inspect the
fallen hero a trumpet-call echoed off to our right,
in a southerly direction.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
We sped off towards it, leaving a boy to guard
the carcass; the herd had stopped a mile or so
off; not having winded or seen us, it was still
unruffled.  We dashed on to try to cut them of
and very nearly stumbled right on top of them.
A large herd this time, mostly cows and totos.
In the van a very fair bull; in the rearguard
three more shootable ones, but none anything
like Bettina's.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
We let them go by, and slinking from thorn
patch to thorn patch, separated into two parties,
one heading towards the vanguard of the herd,
the other towards its rear.  We were about a
hundred yards away, a trifle far, perhaps, but
safer, being as numerous as we were; the wind
was right, the place ideal for this sort of ambush;
thorn bush and no grass.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
A shrill whistle echoed and the battle began.
It was over in a second.  A rumble and a cloud
<span id="p121">of</span> dust on the horizon was all that was left.
No!  What is that grey patch behind that thorn
tree?  An elephant on his side kicking in agony
of death; incautiously we join together and
move up; at that instant a shrill trumpet peal
breaks out, and from the side dashes one of the
huge beasts with the rush of a mountain slide.
I don't quite know what happened.  There was
banging off of guns and a great commotion.
All I remember was being knocked over and
seeing a snake-like trunk snatch one of the
trackers and whirl him with a crunching sound
against the trunk of a tree.  Then everything
went black.  I woke up to find them all around
me looking very concerned.  I sat up, and the
first thing that caught my eye was the twitching
leg of the monster as he had fallen head over heels
in his stride.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Nothing broken, I got up and went to the side
of our poor tracker.  He was a complete mess.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
We set the boys to burying him and tried as
best we could to protect his grave from straying
jackals and hyenas.  Then we took stock of
the results; three bull elephants done to death.
Two around fifty pounds and one big one,
Bettina's.  (It scaled larger, when weighed
<span id="p122">properly</span>, 112 and 108 respectively, a real
triumph for her.)
</p>

<p class="btfi">
By the time we had set a guard over them
and were ready to start home an army of natives
had materialized apparently out of thin air.
I believe these meat-hungry demons set a watch
on the vultures; when they see them drop in
any quantities they go out and investigate.
Certainly less than two hours after the actual
shots, over four hundred natives were hard
at it, tearing, rending; all their female relations
having a little Kilkenny argument over the dainty
morsels thrown them by their lords and masters.
The men hew and hack away, getting right
into the carcass, while the women grab and shriek
around the outside; thoroughly nauseated we
departed, leaving a Somali gunbearer and two
native ascaris to escort the ivory home.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The road had seemed short enough in the
morning, especially after sighting the quarry.
What a diference the return under the blazing
sun.  Each foot seemed of lead; my side ached
like fury.  The women, disregarding our advice,
began to suck at the water-bottles, and in
consequence were soon foundered.  We helped
them along as best we could, though as a part
<span id="p123">cripple</span> myself I hindered more than I helped.
Each step was a torture with that demoniacal
sun beating us, burning right down to our boots,
the &ldquo;wait a bit&rdquo; thorns clutching at every
square inch of exposed flesh, tearing our clothes
from our backs, rending cloth or leather.  At
length we reached camp to fall into chairs or on
to the beds.  Our boys undressed us and we lay
in the shade of the bower-like trees, elated though
entirely knocked out.  The girls fared worse
than we did, as for reasons of modesty they had
to retire into the tent and attend to their own
comforts.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
We were a happy company around the table
to-night.  Bettina, her eyes shining, her black
hair glistening in the moonbeams; the southern
girl, all gold and pale ivory, her scarlet lips
trembling with excitement at the idea that she
had actually killed one of these prehistoric
monsters.  The sorrow at the death of the native
was short-lived among his own kinsmen; a
mountain of flesh was <span class="corr; sic='laying'">lying</span> on the veldt; what
mattered life or death compared to glorious
food in such quantities.  The life of a man was a
fly's kiss to the meat hunger which cropped up
on this occasion.  Anyway, death to the African
<span id="p124">is</span> just a happening of everyday life; I have seen
them lay themselves to die after a curse from a
witch doctor, dying effectively within a few days,
and no human remedy can ever save them when
in that state.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Well, we must all go some day soon; and so
to bed.

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">A slight</span> figure wobbles in the haze; as it shim&shy;mies
through the heat waves, you wonder what
matter it is.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Approaching, light of foot, silent of tread,
knees bare, arms bare, mahogany colour, topee
over the eyes, rifle at the slouch, with the easy
stride of the desert wanderer.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
In your chair, one hand on knee, the other
waving a whisky and soda, a flash of teeth, the
curly, jet hair, energy and youth, the border
patrol of the 5th K.A.R.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
His ascaris escorting the Safari trail in, his
tent is pitched, fire going, dinner on the grill;
while he talks and smiles.  Busily, order reigns
<span class="corr; sic=''">.</span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;. even in your camp.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
An invitation to dinner gracefully accepted,
another smile, you are alone in front of your
tent.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
An hour later, as you stroll over to his camp,
luscious smells and Somali laughter greet you.
Such a dinner in the winds, spectre of Mayfair,
nightmares of Harley Street; venison, pudding,
<span id="p128">champagne</span>, just in case you have a touch of
fever. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And then all is quiet, the moon
rising, the candle flickering on the table, the red
glow of the fire behind him, a wistful look in his
eyes (an orderly, at attention, suddenly perceived).
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The orderly bends towards the table, salutes,
is gone, and between us, on the cloth, &ldquo;The
Green Hat&rdquo; wonders if Michael Arlen really
laughed.
</p>

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch7.sec2">N.F.P.</a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">Heaving</span>, plunging, the camels are made to
kneel at last, a case shaken loose on the trek
falls with a resounding crash.  Drip .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. drip
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shrill yells from the &ldquo;M'pishi&rdquo; careering
madly with a saucepan to catch the fast flowing
drops of Dewar's Honeydew.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
&ldquo;Damn, why couldn't it have been a bottle
of your vile gut-rotting lemonade?&rdquo; says the
commandant.  &ldquo;We've still a month to go, and
only two bottles of whisky left.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="btfi">
After a twenty-five mile trek across the lava
rock, footsore, weary, blinded by the sand, we
camp at dawn.  Lake Rudolf in the distance
shimmers of salt and soda, while the thinly-spread
<span id="p129">thorn</span> trees filter the morning sunrise above the
hills.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
We march at night, every one hanging on to
the former one's tail; then if it happens to be
a gracious camel, all is well enough, though one
is apt to get nipped by the next one in the string
behind you.  There is much talk of the hyena's
jaw power, but for plain malevolent biting, the
camel supersedes them all.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The camp fits itself out along the stony ridge,
the machine gun at each end sweeping the plain
beneath us; a &ldquo;Boma&rdquo; in the middle, the
camels crunching contentedly for once.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Our tents are pitched with their backs to a
one hundred feet drop; elimination of the un&shy;wary
or sleep-walking to-night.  We are here
until midnight; when starting again, a short
trek will take us up to Lake Rudolf Fort.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
I have never been this way before.  My last
glimpse of civilisation was at Marsabit; Martin
Johnson and his wife did us royally; the com&shy;mandant
is a friend of theirs.  Great &ldquo;Tembo&rdquo;
hunter and great &ldquo;Tembo&rdquo; photographer
gossiped far on through the night, while Mrs. M.
J. played the Victor to us youngsters.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Fitz is just going out to get some meat, his
<span id="p130">dog</span> at his heels.  I'll go too.  This roaring heat
gets us newcomers, we cannot keep still; the
commandant, under his mosquito net, sleeps
peacefully, while his faithful Daimano fusses
with his things, and a tall, lithe &ldquo;Nandi&rdquo;
orderly lovingly oils the famous &ldquo;Tembo&rdquo;
guns.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
In the plains below, though 9&nbsp;a.m. the heat
is appalling, the world seems to dance around me.
Fitz's long thin form rocks and waves before my
eyes, his dog is beat.  In the middle distance
among some thorn scrub, we sight some gazelles,
&ldquo;Waller's gazelle,&rdquo; says Fitz who has been
swotting up his &ldquo;Rowland Ward.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="btfi">
We try a stalk around some bumpy ground, to
find them moving across the stark plain.  A small
&ldquo;donga&rdquo; stretches on our left, the wind towards
us, we clamber down, our shirts sticking to our
backs, and crawl and creep and run at times,
till the ascaris with us being to show signs of interest.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Cautiously we peer over the edge, there they
are thirty yards away; Fitz gets a buck.  I miss,
and little puffs of dust rise on the plain, flickering
tails outstretched, fifteen feet at every bound;
we'll see them no more to-day.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
<span id="p131">Fitz</span>, already at the kill, tape in hand, measures
twenty inches from tip to skull.  &ldquo;Quite near
a record head,&rdquo; says he importantly.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Oh, that walk home, barely two miles, what a
torture; an ascari calmly stalks, the buck across
his shoulders.  At last the rise; clambering over
the rocks, we thump down in our chairs, clamour&shy;ing
for water, by then the temperature of newly-<!--lb-->made
tea.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The commandant yawns, rolls over, looking
our way.  &ldquo;Got a Grant's, did you, a young
buck, good meat.&rdquo;  Fitz's glad smile dies, the
record for Grant's gazelle in Rowland Ward
is well over thirty inches.  He won't own up,
I won't tell, but a Waller's neck is about three
feet long.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
We lapse into fitful slumber, slowly oozing
moisture wetting our lips, to feel it coming out
through our eyes; and the day goes forward in
the land of the Vertical Sun.
</p>

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch7.sec3">The Patrol.</a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">We</span> trudge along, the quiet squashy tread of the
camels' feet beating time to the rhythm of our
brains; four miles an hour, and then again
<span id="p132">another</span> hour; the trail winds across the plain,
then up a ridge and down the other side or into
a deep donga, then scrambles up again&mdash;miles
of thornbush and scrub.  The askaris march
along, joking among themselves, it is all in the
day's work.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
It is less hot to-day, the sky is over-clouded,
the light subdued.  We crawl on, a snake winding
across the plain.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
In front, the commandant swings his rifle
across his back, his head bent in thought or
dreams of shikar among elephant grass and fly.
Behind him a stalwart sergeant-major, veteran
of a hundred campaigns, remembering long past
fights and lost or damaged equipment, figuring
how much this Safari will cost the company.
Then the camels, an askari on each side.  Perched
on the last one, the company baboon reflectively
scratching, scans the horizon from his exalted
position.  I close the file, the commandant's
dog has elected to help me.  Mixture of fox-<!--lb-->terrier
and pug, she patiently puts up with all
this nonsense, wondering why these foolish
humans should walk in the sun instead of staying
in the lines at Meru, where there are rats to chase
and shadow-bound nooks and crannies to sleep
<span id="p133">in</span> on sweltering days, good water and cool nights.
She trots off to join her master.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Another hour, and a runner from the forward
detachment chases down with news; the column
halts, the runner jabbers and gesticulates.  A
ringing order.  The camels will wait; they
compose themselves to rest, a sullen escort at
either side.  The baboon climbs down, scratches
herself and goes to the cook's box in high hopes.
The commandant explains that the scouts have
sighted some Havashi raiders; we are going to
head them off.  The company lines up and
briskly marches out.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The pace begins to tell; we mop our brows
and little trickles run down our backs.  Skirting
a hill half-way up, having left the trail, we meet
a guide left for us; following along, we dodge
in and out among boulders and rocks in Indian
file.  Halting at last, just below the brow of a
hill, I go forward with the commandant to find
the scouts lying flat on a ledge overlooking a
valley.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
About ten miles away we see the Havashi
coming fast on camels and horses.  They're the
lot we're out to catch; been burning villages
and taking slaves around Lake Rudolf; shooting
<span id="p134">elephant</span> too, they say.  We'll ambush them as
they come into the defile, half the company to
the bottom, the other half split in two to the
ridges on either side.  The Somali askaris are
delighted and fidget behind their rocks.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
An hour later the raiders are in the valley.
They see someone, loose a shot, and, leaping from
their horses, they hide behind boulders and bits
of shrub, in the river bed at the bottom, the
animals careering madly off in all directions.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Down we come with a rush, cover to cover;
they are nearly surrounded.  Popping fom all
sides .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. an askari at my side jumps and flops,
shot through the brain.  We stalk them from
rock to rock, and with a last rush, all is done.
The priosners are led off with much lurid
sarcasm by the Somalis, the vultures are over&shy;head,
one swoops down already to perch un&shy;abashedly
on a nearby tree.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
We march off, our wounded swung in blankets
between two rifles.  A few mounds of piled
stones no hyena could move, a few cartridge
cases; we go out down the valley, leaving it to
regain its pristine quiet.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The commandant starts some Somali song;
the men step out, all joining in the chant.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
<span id="p135">The</span> prisoners ask if we are recruiting any
more; they know their jobs, have fought the
Italians some moons ago.  &ldquo;Silence, dogs,&rdquo; says
a tall sergeant, &ldquo;if you live through the desert
where we're taking you, your bodies will swing
from the trees in Meru, and carrion crows grow
fat.  Dogs, eaters of dug-up bodies; we'll have
no unbelievers in our ranks.&rdquo;  The prisoners'
spirits do not fall; they know they've probably
a little carpet-weaving and stone-breaking to do,
but nothing very heart-rending.  The white
man's law is lenient, the food is good, the work
is light and their Ras is far away.  The sergeant
spits indignantly towards these renegades, for&shy;getting
his own slight lapse ten years ago when
he lead a galloping rush against British horse,
during his leave back in Somaliland.  The com&shy;mandant,
smiling, remembers the look of horror
on the sergeant's face when he was brought
before him: &ldquo;Effendi, is our regiment there?&rdquo;
&ldquo;No, Mohammed, but it is well that I am here
to see that thy neck should not be stretched.
What have I taught thee?  That troops in
formation cannot be broken by a rabble charge.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, Effendi, these pigs would not wait though
I have drilled them for the past week.&rdquo;
<span id="p136">&ldquo;Dismissed,</span> thou shalt have two hours more
drill each day when we get back.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Inchallah,
Effendi.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Our Safari catches up and we tramp down to
the thorn trees around the camp; the dog and
the baboon standing guard over the cook's box.

enough to make much difference.

If someone thinks they recognise themselves

who has given only impressions&mdash;impressions
lasting a second, then passed for ever.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
In his dim mind surges at times some queer
mood, and then he sees in the surrounding
setting a personality take form.  It may be
through the influence of a personality present,
more often it is a vague growth of his mind.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
So to you who think you recognise yourself
or another, I dedicate these sketches as you alone
can give them life, a heart to feel, a mind to move,
a body to break.  They are the personalities I

Flies rise in clouds and buzz against the wire

about their bellies.  A Kavirondo crane
comes flappily to rest on the rood by the rose-<!--lb-->tinted

towering behind.

</p>

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch8.sec4">Far Fly the Fireflies.</a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">With</span> her back to the fire, gold hair aflame in
red and gold kekoi.  She stands!
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The dark hall around, the sylph-like, immaterial
face framed by the dull beam, topped by buffalo
horns.  Like a weird lily swaying on a Japanese
screen, she alone is living in that room.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Sunk in chairs, legs crossed on the floor, propped
up against the wall, all our eyes hang fascinated
on that slight figure.  Elsewhere have I seen
her: a flash of lightning across some dance floor;
drooping lily-like at some spa; laughing excitedly
<span id="p142">while</span> the gold piles up at her side as she bancos
once again.  Everywhere so different, always the
same power.  Men leave their ploughs, their
horses are laid to rest, and, wonderingly, they
follow her never to forget.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The flames flicker; her half-closed eyes awaken
to our mute appeal.  As ever, desire and the long
drawn tobacco smoke weave around her ankles,
slowly entwining that slight frame; around her
neck it curls; a shudder, eyes close.  Content&shy;ment!
Power!
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The figure in the golden kekoi!
</p>

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch8.sec5">Breath of the Sand.</a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">The</span> sun sweeps down, the cattle are coming in.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
On a corral rail, she sits dangling her long
legs.  In flaming kilts, brown riding boots, silk
shirt and flapping soft terai.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Supple figure, breath of the sand; green eyes
aslant, jewelled hand so white in the setting sun.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Languidly at her feet the cattle low, move on
towards water.  Among them the Masai herders
jostle and  a broad back pats; hand in hand, close-<!--lb-->cut
curly hair, sunburned and efficient, the
manager enjoys his pleasure this day's work done.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
<span id="p143">As</span> the sun slowly sinks behind that supple
figure, naked in its transparency, the corral bars
go black, and lower down by the shores of the
lake the flamingoes turn red, waving the beath
in their numbers.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The girl leaps down, her hand pulls off the hat,
a startled hippo snorts and dives again; no
twilight, it's nearly dark over Elementeita; the
mountains on the horizon loose a shaft of light,
which high up in the sky curls a pink-edged cloud
and dies.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
&ldquo;Boy, come home and play,&rdquo; she calls.
</p>

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch8.sec6">The Sun.</a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">With</span> thoughtful eyes, fingers entwined, he stares
through you into space.  His grave, calm head
grey-thatched, his bronze bearded face might
be of some great university in a haven of retorts
and microscopes.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Thirty years of this land, thirty years of fever
and chattering have deformed his mind, broken
his will: but why?
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Behind those eyes is a brain whirling with
superstitions and beliefs.  As once his body ran
naked with the native hunters; now his soul
<span id="p144">runs</span> naked to the bidding of the witch doctors.
Why?
</p>

<p class="btfi">
A paternal government keeps him in his hell,
each day losing hope, losing caste, to administer
white man's law.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
His hand trembles as it holds the pen, and yet
he does not drink.  Why?
</p>

<p class="btfi">
You take your permit written in a shaky hand;
he rises, accompanying you, and you notice that
he stands hatless by your side in the midday sun.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
He does not feel the sun any more!
</p>

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch8.sec7">The Course of True Love.</a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">As</span> the Safari crossed the Uaso Njiro she slipped
and got wet, he may have laughed, he may not
have been quick enough to her side.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
As he stalked the buffalo, her foot caught in
a twig, that buffalo still fights his equals among
the scrub.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
When sentimentally inclined she sought the
moonlight to think and love, he, snoringly com&shy;placent,
cared not that the stenches of his drying
heads and skins smote her to the core.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
They had left New York so happy to be alone,
their hearts yearning for the great spaces of the
<span id="p145">earth</span>; just they together.  The danger and the
glory of big game hunting had drawn them to
my land; to do things together, to go where
&ldquo;men were men!&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The journey is long, hot and tedious; once
out in the wilds they supped; they dined, they
slept, they breakfasted together.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
She got freckles, he grew a beard.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
She went back by sea, craving the solitudes of
Paris.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
He charged overland towards his easy chair
in the Racquet Club.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The course of true love is mysterious in my land.
</p>

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch8.sec8">Black Laughter.</a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">Across</span> the table we talk, just a Welshman and I.
All through the courses, while the silent boys
served and moved, I have watched him: Crea&shy;ture
of moods, creature of instincts, untamed&mdash;<!--lb-->untrained,
a violent mind of desires, flashes of
genius&mdash;no achievement!
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Across the table I've talked hard reason, facts
bleak and unashamed; he answered vaguely,
&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; sliding through one's grip each time;
at each trap hesitatingly he passed by, never to
<span id="p146">say</span> &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; never to deny without some restric&shy;tion.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Across the table he talks of towns we have
known, of people we have seen, of pictures he
might have painted, of Augustus John, of Julian's<!--lb-->&mdash;and
I see him as he might have been: some
knighted R.A. gleaming with orders, his Rolls
waiting at the door.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
In some back room a brown woman laughs,
her bracelets jingle, my host's eyes wander.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Aross that dark table silent we will sit until
I can bear it no more.
</p>

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch8.sec9">Just a Bold, Bad Man.</a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">As</span> he sits over port, his slanting green eyes light
when he sees one shiver to his tales of goring
buffalo or tossing rhino.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
As he walks in the garden moonlight his sensu&shy;ous
mouth tightens when the girl at his side gasps
at his tales of debauch and treason.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
His body, an athlete's, surges around a weird
and lurid mind; diseased things attract him in
the abstract; rape and murder would be his
profession.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
When 'flu breaks out he believes in being
<span id="p147">scarce</span>.  He loves a noise; is spick and span, hair
licked to perfection; he hunts by profession.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
But all must think that:
</p>

<p class="btfi">
&ldquo;Nevil, Nevil, is such a little devil with the
girls!&rdquo;
</p>

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch8.sec10">They Two?</a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">There</span> is an argument, one of those discussions
about nothing which are good for digestions;
keep one moving after dinner.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
An argument?  Well, it might be one if we last
out, our firebrand has always said that true
oratory consists of making oneself heard when
others speak.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
He waves his arms, thumps the table; when he
stops for breath or another Three Star Hennessy,
we get in a word and he breaks out anew.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
She watches him, smiling, her Mongolian eyes
curl upward at the corners, and a slight flush
tinges her ivory-white face.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
&ldquo;You're drunk, my dear, come off to bed,&rdquo;
and she leads him, still discussing, backwards
towards the door.  Far into the night we hear
the fight rally to and fro.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
With that outward directness, who will ever
<span id="p148">know</span> the twistings of her mind?  With that facial
lightness, who will discover her heart's desire,
and give her contentment?
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Beneath his shouting is there a mind?  Does
his business-like practicality hide his true love and
generosity?
</p>

<p class="btfi">
I would like to know?
</p>

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch8.sec11">&ldquo;She.&rdquo;</a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">She</span> sits by my side laughing up at the boy.
Amber liqueur; amber glass; pink nails; white
skin; cream silk shirt and red kekoi.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Her warmth by my side tingles my skin.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
In a throaty voice she asks for another.  &ldquo;Let's
be jolly and think of Paris to-night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Her hand creeps around my waist but she
smiles up at another.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Someone begins to hum the tune and we all
throb to it.  The melody of the corn brakes rises
in the room.  The buffalo horns shine and
bow, the rhythm twisting about them.  Smoke
hands around the backs of the chairs.  Her foot
nods to the time.  Her nails sere my flesh.  A
turn of her head, a breath of a word; &ldquo;to-<!--lb-->night!&rdquo;
</p>

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch8.sec12"><span id="p149">Philip.</span></a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">When</span> you think you've lost him, he snoops
around a corner; when you go out a second,
coming in, you bump his head.  He walks on
your high-heeled shoes, he sweats devotion.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
At first interested, you now are bored.  His
clothes are an indiscretion; his hats would make
the &ldquo;tembo&rdquo; stop in his charge.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Just a rather dear little man, and it did
amuse you to tease that flustered little
wife.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
We all know now why they can't play bridge.
She believes that hearts are always trumps, he
that spade work is necessary.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
But he's better home, as the way she drives
her car when he's away makes me wonder what
she'd really like to do to you.
</p>

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch8.sec13">Business as Usual.</a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">Smiling</span> with twinkling eyes; the charming
athlete is pleased to see you.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
&ldquo;Come on out to the golf club, I've got the
new greens in.  Will you play for our side against
Kikuyu a month from next Sunday?&rdquo;  You try
<span id="p150">to</span> speak of cattle land or water.  &ldquo;We'll go
to the office later.  Just come over to our new
courts.  I hope to get some good games up
every Sunday in the evenings after polo.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="btfi">
He stands you a drink, takes you back to his
house, and a wonderful meal.  &ldquo;Old man, stay
the night and we'll talk about that business
to-morrow.&rdquo;  But you insist, and when he is in
the office you state your case.  He sighs and shakes
his head.  &ldquo;I'm sorry, old man, I'll have to
refer to the London office.  I couldn't let you
do that without.  And you'd better hurry.
You know land is going up with the railroad
coming our way.  It's worth five pounds an
acre now.  I can still let you have six
thousand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="btfi">
&ldquo;Don't forget a month from Sunday.  I
won't be here between times as I'm playing at
Nairobi, at Mombasa, and the week after next
at Eldoret.&rdquo;

He is suffering so to-night!  We are all
concerned.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
He wipes his forehead, red and dewy.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
<span id="p151">He</span> can't make up his mind!  Which girl
does he love?  Which will be that soul com&shy;pleting
comfortress, that insurance policy he
really needs.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Living alone he has passed danger by, but now
he can't cross Government Road without risking
death; slim ankles, thick ankles, lofty or low.
His eye behind his glass just dims with senti&shy;ment.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
His head drops on the bar, great tears roll
through his fingers; all consoling we pat him
on the back.  &ldquo;Nigel, old man, can't we help?&rdquo;
The tears grow harsher, the sobs shake a
bottle from the shelf, tinkling glasses crunch
underfoot.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
At last, truth will out.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
His eyeglass hurts him so!

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch8.sec15">The Ranker.</a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">Our</span> soldier has worked hard; years of toil, of
unrest, of discomfort, of education.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Long hour fighting up the hill, moments of
despair.  But courage, physical courage, and
much more so mental courage has pulled him
through.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
<span id="p152">Not</span> a trace of bitterness, not a trace of arro&shy;gance;
not a thought of humility, not a word of
self-praise.  He is what he has made himself;

he once sailed to London before the mast in a
windjammer.

<p class="btfi">
Efficient chief of real fighting troops, he is
our soldier, a great soldier, a greater gentleman.

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch8.sec16">A Bad Woman.</a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">She</span> is not dainty; she is not distinguished.

<p class="btfi">
She does not haggle about money, she takes it.
She is violent in her loves, choleric in her dis&shy;cussions.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
She does not care who knows about her, she
tries to know about others.  What she does not
know she invents.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
She is a good soul at heart; brave about things
at times.  I suppose her life has made her bitter
about others.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
What will she do?
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Every day on the wing, from here to there
through mud and dust, fiercely driving a car.

<p class="btfi">
What can we say better than &ldquo;Much will be

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch8.sec17"><span id="p153">Barbara.</span></a></h3>

outburst if some fault comes to light.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Barbara goes her rounds in grey slacks and an
old mackintosh.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
She is efficient, she craves fitness, fitness in
horses, fitness in men.  Her mind is fit, her body
fitter, no hesitation comes to her brain, no slip
causes her to move in the saddle as she goes over
the jumps.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Young, eager, and yet restrained.  Ploddingly
she is making her way, making a name.  She is
a great friend to have.  She knows by instinct
what may help just as she completes her lack of
experience by instinct.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
She trains horses; horses of fire, to race and win.

<h3 class="section"><a name="ch8.sec18">The Lady from the North.</a></h3>

<p class="bt">
<span class="sc">From</span> far away up north she comes down once in
a while, to see the gay lights, she says.  Or buy
household goods or clothes.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
She sits calm-eyed in the Muthaiga lounge,
<span id="p154">sipping</span> a drink, a curling cigarette between her
fingers.  In her pale blonde youth and loveliness
she sits and watches, watches men go by.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
Now and then one comes up and takes her hand,
speaks a word and passes on.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
For a day or so she sits and watches; her pale
blue eyes wandering, no place; her mind seems
vacant, her body listless.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
She is making up her mind! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  One morning
she departs, her interior seethings are appeased,
her mind is fixed.  That evening we notice that
someone has gone, one of us has followed the pale
gold figure, to return soon hollow-eyed and
hard-mouthed, never to speak of the north again.

<p class="btfi">
I shall sit in the leather chair by the fireplace

greatly regretted pony.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
We will talk of light things, of horses and the
<span id="p155">latest</span> Government House rumour, awaiting the
other guests.  As they come you shake another
drink and I wander to the show case where your
cups and whips are resting below the fox's mask.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
As the fatal hour comes, reverently we troop
into the dark room frosted with white skulls.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
We sit in silence as the dishes pass around, the
heap growing before each.  Restrained, we eat
thoughtfully, watching each other.  Till the
first bead of perspiration breaks out on the first
forehead.  Silence is the Ritual.  And then,
after a grab of grated cocoanut, we retire to rest.
Sahib, the Sunday curry is over, humbled and
grateful we will wait another week.

Above, skimming clouds flash shadows in the
wake of the moon.  In the house, before a log
fire, the gramophone chants &ldquo;Banana Oil,&rdquo;
while the cat upsets a cocktail glass with a whisk

</p>

<p class="btfi">
The &ldquo;boy friend,&rdquo; his arm about her waist,
speaks of love under the calling Hyrax, under the

a sport of light&mdash;slowly crawls along the
trail; now and then the vanishing pin-points
break out again like awakened glow-worms.
The neigh of a zebra; the stampeding of feet
waft subdued and tenuous on the breath of the
wind.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The &ldquo;boy friend&rdquo; bows his lips to hers, slipping
his hand through the silk kekoi.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
&ldquo;Come on, we are starting another round, and
you are two drinks down already.&rdquo;  The poker
table is laid and the bodies tense press before it.
They come in, blinking towards the light, their
pulses afire.  He rests his hand on the back of
his wife's chair and she slips down at his wife's
side.
</p>

<p class="btfi">
The &ldquo;boy friend&rdquo; deals the cards, his foot close
pressed between hers.
