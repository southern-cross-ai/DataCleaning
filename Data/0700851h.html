  <h2><a name="ch1"
     id="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; THE INVALID</h2>

  <p class="first">LOOKING back on events by the light of experience I perceive
  clearly that the thunder-cloud which burst on me and on those who were dear
  to me had not gathered unseen. It is true that it had rolled up swiftly; that
  the premonitory mutterings, now so distinct but then so faint and
  insignificant, gave but a brief warning. But that was of little consequence,
  since whatever warnings there were passed unheeded, as warnings commonly do,
  being susceptible of interpretation only by means of the subsequent events
  which they foreshadowed.</p>

  <p>The opening scene of the tragedy&mdash;if I had but realized it&mdash;was
  the arrival of the Reverend Amos Monkhouse from his far-away Yorkshire parish
  at the house of his brother Harold. I happened to be there at the time; and
  though it was not my concern, since Harold had a secretary, I received the
  clergyman when he was announced. We knew one another well enough by name
  though we had never met, and it was with some interest and curiosity that I
  looked at the keen-faced, sturdy, energetic-looking parson and contrasted him
  with his physically frail and rather characterless brother. He looked at me,
  too, curiously and with a certain appearance of surprise, which did not
  diminish when I told him who I was.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" said he, "yes, Mr Mayfield. I am glad to have the opportunity of
  making your acquaintance. I have heard a good deal about you from Harold and
  Barbara. Now I can fit you with a visible personality. By the way, the maid
  tells me that Barbara is not at home."</p>

  <p>"No, she is away on her travels in Kent."</p>

  <p>"In Kent!" he repeated, raising his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Yes, on one of her political expeditions; organizing some sort of women's
  emancipation movement. I dare say you have heard about it."</p>

  <p>He nodded a little impatiently. "Yes. Then I assume that Harold is not so
  ill as I had supposed?"</p>

  <p>I was inclined to be evasive; for, to be quite candid, I had thought more
  than once that Barbara might properly have given a little less attention to
  her political hobbies and a little more to her sick husband. So I replied
  cautiously:</p>

  <p>"I really don't quite know what his condition is. You see, when a man has
  chronically bad health, one rather loses count. Harold has his ups and downs,
  but he always looks pretty poorly. Just now, I should say he is rather below
  his average."</p>

  <p>"Ha! Well, perhaps I had better go up and have a look at him. The maid has
  told him that I am here. I wonder if you would be so kind as to show me the
  way to his room. I have not been in this house before."</p>

  <p>I conducted him up to the door of the bedroom and then returned to the
  library to wait for him and hear what he thought of the invalid. And now that
  the question had been raised, I was not without a certain uneasiness. What I
  had said was true enough. When a man is always ailing one gets to take his
  ill-health for granted and to assume that it will go on without any
  significant change. One repeats the old saying of "the creaking gate" and
  perhaps makes unduly light of habitual illness. Might it be that Harold was
  being a little neglected? He had certainly looked bad enough when I had
  called on him that morning. Was it possible that he was really seriously ill?
  Perhaps in actual danger?</p>

  <p>I had just asked myself this question when the door was opened abruptly
  and the clergyman strode into the room. Something in his expression&mdash;a
  mingling, as it seemed, of anger and alarm&mdash;rather startled me;
  nevertheless I asked him calmly enough how he found his brother. He stared at
  me, almost menacingly, for a second or two; then slowly and with harsh
  emphasis he replied: "I am shocked at the change in him. I am horrified. Why,
  good God, Sir! the man is dying!"</p>

  <p>"I think that can hardly be," I objected. "The doctor saw him this morning
  and did not hint at anything of the sort. He thought he was not very well but
  he made no suggestion as to there being any danger."</p>

  <p>"How long has the doctor been attending him?"</p>

  <p>"For something like twenty years, I believe; so by this time he ought to
  understand the patient's&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tut-tut," the parson interrupted, impatiently, "what did you say yourself
  but a few minutes ago? One loses count of the chronic invalid. He exhausts
  our attention until, at last, we fail to observe the obvious. What is wanted
  is a fresh eye. Can you give me the doctor's address? Because, if you can, I
  will call on him and arrange a consultation. I told Harold that I wanted a
  second opinion and he made no objection; in fact he seemed rather relieved.
  If we get a really first-class physician, we may save him yet."</p>

  <p>"I think you are taking an unduly gloomy view of Harold's condition," said
  I. "At any rate, I hope so. But I entirely agree with you as to the
  advisability of having further advice. I know where Dr Dimsdale lives so if
  you like I will walk round with you."</p>

  <p>He accepted my offer gladly and we set forth at once, walking briskly
  along the streets, each of us wrapped in thought and neither speaking for
  some time. Presently I ventured to remark:</p>

  <p>"Strictly, I suppose, we ought to have consulted Barbara before seeking
  another opinion."</p>

  <p>"I don't see why," he replied. "Harold is a responsible person and has
  given his free consent. If Barbara is so little concerned about him as to go
  away from home&mdash;and for such a trumpery reason, too&mdash;I don't see
  that we need consider her. Still, as a matter of common civility, I might as
  well send her a line. What is her present address?"</p>

  <p>"Do you know," I said, shamefacedly, "I am afraid I can't tell you exactly
  where she is at the moment. Her permanent address, when she is away on these
  expeditions, is the head-quarters of the Women's Friendship League at
  Maidstone."</p>

  <p>He stopped for a moment and glowered at me with an expression of sheer
  amazement. "Do you mean to tell me," he exclaimed, "that she has gone away,
  leaving her husband in this condition, and that she is not even within reach
  of a telegram?"</p>

  <p>"I have no doubt that a telegram or letter would be forwarded to her."</p>

  <p>He emitted an angry snort and then demanded: "How long has she been
  away?"</p>

  <p>"About a fortnight," I admitted, reluctantly.</p>

  <p>"A fortnight!" he repeated in angry astonishment. "And all that time
  beyond reach of communication! Why the man might have been dead and buried
  and she none the wiser!"</p>

  <p>"He was much better when she went away," I said, anxious to make the best
  of what I felt to be a rather bad case. "In fact, he seemed to be getting on
  quite nicely. It is only during the last few days that he has got this
  set-back. Of course, Barbara is kept informed as to his condition. Madeline
  sends her a letter every few days."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear Mr Mayfield," he expostulated, "just consider the state of
  affairs in this amazing household. I came to see my brother,
  expecting&mdash;from the brief letter that I had from him&mdash;to find him
  seriously ill. And I do find him seriously ill; dangerously ill, I should
  say. And what sort of care is being taken of him? His wife is away from home,
  amusing herself with her platform fooleries, and has left no practicable
  address. His secretary, or whatever you call him, Wallingford, is not at
  home. Madeline is, of course, occupied in her work at the school. Actually,
  the only person in the house besides the servants is yourself&mdash;a friend
  of the family but not a member of the household at all. You must admit that
  it is a most astonishing and scandalous state of affairs."</p>

  <p>I was saved from the necessity of answering this rather awkward question
  by our arrival at Dr Dimsdale's house; and, as it fortunately happened that
  the doctor was at home and disengaged, we were shown almost at once into his
  consulting room.</p>

  <p>I knew Dr Dimsdale quite well and rather liked him, though I was not
  deeply impressed by his abilities. However, his professional skill was really
  no concern of mine, and his social qualities were unexceptionable. In
  appearance and manner he had always seemed to me the very type of a
  high-class general practitioner, and so he impressed me once more as we were
  ushered into his sanctum. He shook hands with me genially, and as I
  introduced the Reverend Amos looked at him with a politely questioning
  expression. But the clergyman lost no time in making clear the purpose of his
  visit; in fact he came to the point with almost brutal abruptness.</p>

  <p>"I have just seen my brother for the first time for several months and I
  am profoundly shocked at his appearance. I expected to find him ill, but I
  did not understand that he was so ill as I find him."</p>

  <p>"No," Dr Dimsdale agreed, gravely, "I suppose not. You have caught him at
  a rather unfortunate time. He is certainly not so well today."</p>

  <p>"Well!" exclaimed Amos. "To me he has the look of a dying man. May I ask
  what, exactly, is the matter with him?"</p>

  <p>The doctor heaved a patient sigh and put his fingertips together.</p>

  <p>"The word 'exactly'," he replied, with a faint smile, "makes your question
  a little difficult to answer. There are so many things the matter with him.
  For the last twenty years, on and off, I have attended him, and during the
  whole of that time his health has been unsatisfactory&mdash;most
  unsatisfactory. His digestion has always been defective, his circulation
  feeble, he has had functional trouble with his heart, and throughout the
  winter months, more or less continuous respiratory troubles&mdash;nasal and
  pulmonary catarrh and sometimes rather severe bronchitis."</p>

  <p>The Reverend Amos nodded impatiently. "Quite so, quite so. But, to come
  from the past to the present, what is the matter with him now?"</p>

  <p>"That," the doctor replied suavely, "is what I was coming to. I mentioned
  the antecedents to account for the consequents. The complaints from which
  your brother has suffered in the past have been what are called functional
  complaints. But functional disease&mdash;if there really is such a
  thing&mdash;must, in the end, if it goes on long enough, develop into organic
  disease. Its effects are cumulative. Each slight illness leaves the bodily
  organs a little less fit."</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"Well, that is, I fear, what is happening in your brother's case. The
  functional illnesses of the past are tending to take on an organic
  character."</p>

  <p>"Ha!" snorted the Reverend Amos. "But what is his actual condition now? To
  put it bluntly, supposing he were to die tonight, what would you write on die
  death certificate?"</p>

  <p>"Dear me!" said the doctor. "That is putting it very bluntly. I hope the
  occasion will not arise."</p>

  <p>"Still, I suppose you don't regard his death as an impossible
  contingency?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, by no means. Chronic illness confers no immortality, as I have just
  been pointing out."</p>

  <p>"Then, supposing his death to occur, what would you state to be the
  cause?"</p>

  <p>Dr Dimsdale's habitual suavity showed a trace of diminution as he replied:
  "You are asking a very unusual and hardly admissible question, Mr Monkhouse.
  However, I may say that if your brother were to die tonight he would die from
  some definite cause, which would be duly set forth in the certificate. As he
  is suffering from chronic gastritis, chronic bronchial catarrh, functional
  disorder of the heart and several other morbid conditions, these would be
  added as contributory causes. But may I ask what is the object of these very
  pointed questions?"</p>

  <p>"My object," replied Amos, "was to ascertain whether the circumstances
  justified a consultation. It seems to me that they do. I am extremely
  disturbed about my brother. Would you have any objection to meeting a
  consultant?"</p>

  <p>"But not in the least. On the contrary, I should be very glad to talk over
  this rather indefinite case with an experienced physician who would come to
  it with a fresh eye. Of course, the patient's consent would be
  necessary."</p>

  <p>"He has consented, and he agreed to the consultant whom I
  proposed&mdash;Sir Robert Detling&mdash;if you concurred."</p>

  <p>"I do certainly. I could suggest no better man. Shall I arrange with him
  or will you?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I had better," the parson replied, "as I know him fairly well. We
  were of the same year at Cambridge. I shall go straight on to him now and
  will let you know at once what arrangement he proposes."</p>

  <p>"Excellent," said the doctor, rising with all his suavity restored. "I
  shall keep tomorrow as free as I can until I hear from you, and I hope he
  will be able to manage it so soon. I shall be glad to hear what he thinks of
  our patient, and I trust that the consultation may be helpful in the way of
  treatment."</p>

  <p>He shook our hands heartily and conducted us to the street door, whence he
  launched us safely into the street.</p>

  <p>"That is a very suave gentleman," Amos remarked as we turned away. "Quite
  reasonable, too; but you see for yourself that he has no real knowledge of
  the case. He couldn't give the illness an intelligible name."</p>

  <p>"It seemed to me that he gave it a good many names, and it may well be
  that it is no more than he seems to think; a sort of collective illness, the
  resultant of the various complaints that he mentioned. However, we shall know
  more when Sir Robert has seen him; and meanwhile, I wouldn't worry too much
  about the apparent neglect. Your brother, unlike most chronic invalids,
  doesn't hanker for attention. He has all he wants and he likes to be left
  alone with his books. Shall you see him again today?"</p>

  <p>"Assuredly. As soon as I have arranged matters with Detling I shall let Dr
  Dimsdale know what we have settled and I shall then go back and spend the
  evening with my brother. Perhaps I shall see you tomorrow?"</p>

  <p>"No. I have to run down to Bury St Edmunds tomorrow morning and I shall
  probably be there three or four days. But I should very much like to hear
  what happens at the consultation. Could you send me a few lines? I shall be
  staying at the Angel."</p>

  <p>"I will certainly," he replied, halting and raising his umbrella to signal
  an approaching omnibus. "Just a short note to let you know what Sir Robert
  has to tell us of poor Harold's condition."</p>

  <p>He waved his hand, and stepping off the kerb, hopped on to the foot-board
  of the omnibus as it slowed own, and vanished into the interior. I stood for
  a few moments watching the receding vehicle, half inclined to go back and
  take another look at the sick man; but reflecting that his brother would be
  presently returning, I abandoned the idea and made my way instead to the
  Underground Railway station and there took a ticket for the Temple.</p>

  <p>There is something markedly infectious in states of mind. Hitherto I had
  given comparatively little attention to Harold Monkhouse. He was a more or
  less chronic invalid, suffering now from one complaint and now from another,
  and evidently a source of no particular anxiety either to his friends or to
  his doctor. He was always pallid and sickly-looking, and if, on this
  particular morning, he had seemed to look more haggard and ghastly than
  usual, I had merely noted that he was "not so well today."</p>

  <p>But the appearance on the scene of the Reverend Amos had put a rather
  different complexion on the affair. His visit to his brother had resulted in
  a severe shock, which he had passed on to me; and I had to admit that our
  interview with Dr Dimsdale had not been reassuring. For the fact which had
  emerged from it was that the doctor could not give the disease a name.</p>

  <p>It was very disquieting. Supposing it should turn out that Harold was
  suffering from some grave, even some mortal disease, which ought to have been
  detected and dealt with months ago. How should we all feel? How, in
  particular, would Barbara feel about the easygoing way in which the illness
  had been allowed to drift on? It was an uncomfortable thought; and though
  Harold Monkhouse was really no concern of mine, excepting that he was
  Barbara's husband, it continued to haunt me as I sat in the rumbling train
  and as I walked up from the Temple station to my chambers in Fig Tree
  Court.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2"
     id="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; BARBARA MONKHOUSE COMES HOME</h2>

  <p class="first">IN the intervals of my business at Bury St Edmunds I gave
  more than a passing thought to the man who was lying sick in the house in the
  quiet square at Kensington. It was not that I had any very deep feeling for
  him as a friend, though I liked him well enough. But the idea had got into my
  mind that he had perhaps been treated with something less than ordinary
  solicitude; that his illness had been allowed to drift on when possibly some
  effective measures might have been taken for his relief. And as it had never
  occurred to me to make any suggestions on the matter or to interest myself
  particularly in his condition, I was now inclined to regard myself as a party
  to the neglect, if there had really been any culpable failure of attention. I
  therefore awaited with some anxiety the letter which Amos had promised to
  send.</p>

  <p>It was not until the morning of my third day at Bury that it arrived; and
  when I had opened and read it I found myself even less reassured than I had
  expected.</p>

  <p>"Dear Mayfield," it ran. "The consultation took place this afternoon and
  the result is, in my opinion, highly unsatisfactory. Sir Robert is, at
  present, unable to say definitely what is the matter with Harold. He states
  that he finds the case extremely obscure and reserves his opinion until the
  blood-films and other specimens which he took, have been examined and
  reported on by an expert pathologist. But on one point he is perfectly clear.
  He regards Harold's condition as extremely grave&mdash;even
  critical&mdash;and he advised me to send a telegram to Barbara insisting on
  her immediate return home. Which I have done; and only hope it may reach her
  in the course of the day.</p>

  <p>"That is all I have to tell you and I think you will agree that it is not
  an encouraging report. Medical science must be in a very backward state if
  two qualified practitioners&mdash;one of them an eminent
  physician&mdash;cannot between them muster enough professional knowledge to
  say what is the matter with a desperately sick man. However, I hope that we
  shall have a diagnosis by the time you come back.</p>

  <p>"Yours sincerely,</p>

  <p>"AMOS MONKHOUSE."</p>

  <p>I could not but agree, in the main, that my clerical friend's rather
  gloomy view was justified, though I thought that he was a trifle unfair to
  the doctors, especially to Sir Robert. Probably a less scientific
  practitioner, who would have given the condition some sort of name, would
  have been more satisfying to the parson. Meanwhile, I allowed myself to build
  on "the blood-films and other specimens" hopes of a definite discovery which
  might point the way to some effective treatment.</p>

  <p>I despatched my business by the following evening and returned to London
  by the night train, arriving at my chambers shortly before midnight. With
  some eagerness I emptied the letter-cage in the hope of finding a note from
  Amos or Barbara; but there was none, although there were one or two letters
  from solicitors which required to be dealt with at once. I read these through
  and considered their contents while I was undressing, deciding to get up
  early and reply to them so that I might have the forenoon free; and this
  resolution I carried out so effectively that by ten o'clock in the morning I
  had breakfasted, answered and posted the letters, and was on my way westward
  in an Inner Circle train.</p>

  <p>It was but a few minutes' walk from South Kensington Station to Hilborough
  Square and I covered the short distance more quickly than usual. Turning into
  the square, I walked along the pavement on the garden side, according to my
  habit, until I was nearly opposite the house. Then I turned to cross the road
  and as I did so, looked up at the house. And at the first glance I stopped
  short and stared in dismay: for the blinds were lowered in all the windows.
  For a couple of seconds I stood and gazed at this ominous spectacle; then I
  hurried across the road and, instinctively avoiding the knocker, gave a
  gentle pull at the bell.</p>

  <p>The door was opened by the housemaid, who looked at me somewhat strangely
  but admitted me without a word and shut the door softly behind me. I glanced
  at her set face and asked in a low voice: "Why are all the blinds down,
  Mabel?"</p>

  <p>"Didn't you know, Sir?" she replied, almost in a whisper. "It's the
  master&mdash;Mr Monkhouse. He passed away in the night. I found him dead when
  I went in this morning to draw up the blinds and give him his early tea."</p>

  <p>I gazed at the girl in consternation, and after a pause she continued:</p>

  <p>"It gave me an awful turn. Sir, for I didn't see, at first, what had
  happened. He was lying just as he usually did, and looked as if he had gone
  to sleep, reading. He had a book in his hand, resting on the counterpane, and
  I could see that his candle-lamp had burned itself right out. I put his tea
  on the bedside table and spoke to him, and when he didn't answer I spoke
  again a little louder. And then I noticed that he was perfectly still and
  looked even paler and more yellow than usual and I began to feel nervous
  about him. So I touched his hand: and it was as cold as stone and as stiff as
  a wooden hand. Then I felt sure he must be dead and I ran away and told Miss
  Norris."</p>

  <p>"Miss Norris!" I exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Sir. Mrs Monkhouse only got home about an hour ago. She was
  fearfully upset when she found she was too late. Miss Norris is with her now,
  but I expect she'll be awfully glad you've come. She was asking where you
  were. Shall I tell her you are here?"</p>

  <p>"If you please, Mabel," I replied; and as the girl retired up the stairs
  with a stealthy, funereal tread, I backed into the open doorway of the dining
  room (avoiding the library, in case Wallingford should be there) where I
  remained until Mabel returned with a message asking me to go up.</p>

  <p>I think I have seldom felt more uncomfortable than I did as I walked
  slowly and softly up the stairs. The worst had happened&mdash;at least, so I
  thought&mdash;and we all stood condemned; but Barbara most of all. I tried to
  prepare some comforting, condolent phrases, but could think of nothing but
  the unexplainable, inexcusable fact that Barbara had, of her own choice and
  for her own purposes, gone away leaving a sick husband and had come back to
  find him dead.</p>

  <p>As I entered the pleasant little boudoir&mdash;now gloomy enough, with its
  lowered blinds&mdash;the two women rose from the settee on which they had
  been sitting together, and Barbara came forward to meet me, holding out both
  her hands.</p>

  <p>"Rupert!" she exclaimed, "how good of you! But it is like you to be here
  just when we have need of you." She took both my hands and continued, looking
  rather wildly into my face: "Isn't it an awful thing? Poor, poor Harold! So
  patient and uncomplaining! And I so neglectful, so callous! I shall never,
  never forgive myself. I have been a selfish, egotistical brute."</p>

  <p>"We are all to blame," I said, since I could not honestly dispute her
  self-accusations; "and Dr Dimsdale not the least. Harold has been the victim
  of his own patience. Does Amos know?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," answered Madeline, "I sent him a telegram at half-past eight. I
  should have sent you one, too, but I didn't know that you had come back."</p>

  <p>There followed a slightly awkward silence during which I reflected with
  some discomfort on the impending arrival of the dead man's brother, which
  might occur at any moment. It promised to be a somewhat unpleasant incident,
  for Amos alone had gauged the gravity of his brother's condition, and he was
  an outspoken man. I only hoped that he would not be too outspoken.</p>

  <p>The almost embarrassing silence was broken by Barbara, who asked me in a
  low voice: "Will you go and see him, Rupert?" and added: "You know the way
  and I expect you would rather go alone."</p>

  <p>I said "yes" as I judged that she did not wish to come with me, and,
  walking out of the room, took my way along the corridor to the
  well-remembered door, at which I halted for a moment, with an unreasonable
  impulse to knock, and then entered. A solemn dimness pervaded the room, with
  its lowered blinds, and an unusual silence seemed to brood over it. But
  everything was clearly visible in the faint, diffused light&mdash;the
  furniture, the pictures on the walls, the bookshelves and the ghostly shape
  upon the bed, half-revealed through the sheet which had been laid over
  it.</p>

  <p>Softly, I drew back the sheet, and the vague shape became a man; or
  rather, as it seemed, a waxen effigy, with something in its aspect at once
  strange and familiar. The features were those of Harold Monkhouse, but yet
  the face was not quite the face that I had known. So it has always seemed to
  me with the dead. They have their own distinctive character which belongs to
  no living man&mdash;the physiognomy of death; impassive, expressionless,
  immovable; fixed for ever, or at least, until the changes of the tomb shall
  obliterate even its semblance of humanity.</p>

  <p>I stepped back a pace and looked thoughtfully at the dead man who had
  slipped so quietly out of the land of the living. There he lay, stretched out
  in an easy, restful posture, just as I had often seen him; the eyes
  half-closed and one long, thin arm lying on the counterpane, the waxen hand
  lightly grasping the open volume; looking&mdash;save for the stony
  immobility&mdash;as he might if he had fallen asleep over his book. It was
  not surprising that the housemaid had been deceived, for the surroundings all
  tended to support the illusion. The bedside table with its pathetic little
  provisions for a sick man's needs: the hooded candle-lamp, drawn to the
  table-edge and turned to light the book; the little decanter of brandy, the
  unused tumbler, the water-bottle, the watch, still ticking in its upright
  case, the candle-box, two or three spare volumes and the hand-bell for night
  use; all spoke of illness and repose with never a hint of death.</p>

  <p>There was nothing by which I could judge when he had died. I touched his
  arm and found it rigid as an iron bar. So Mabel had found it some hours
  earlier, whence I inferred that death had occurred not much past midnight.
  But the doctors would be able to form a better opinion, if it should seem
  necessary to form any opinion at all. More to the point than the exact time
  of death was the exact cause. I recalled the blunt question that Amos had put
  to Dr Dimsdale and the almost indignant tone in which the latter had put it
  aside. That was less than a week ago; and now that question had to be
  answered in unequivocal terms. I found myself wondering what the politic and
  plausible Dimsdale would put on the death certificate and whether he would
  seek Sir Robert Detling's collaboration in the execution of that
  document.</p>

  <p>I was about to replace the sheet when my ear caught the footsteps of some
  one approaching on tip-toe along the corridor. The next moment the door
  opened softly and Amos stole into the room. He passed me with a silent
  greeting and drew near the bed, beside which he halted with his hand laid on
  the dead hand and his eyes fixed gloomily on the yellowish-white, impassive
  face. He spoke no word, nor did I presume to disturb this solemn meeting and
  farewell, but silently slipped out into the corridor where I waited for him
  to come out.</p>

  <p>Two or three minutes passed, during which I heard him, once or twice,
  moving softly about the room and judged that he was examining the
  surroundings amidst which his brother had passed the last few weeks of his
  life. Presently he came out, closing the door noiselessly behind him, and
  joined me opposite the window. I looked a little nervously into the stern,
  grief-stricken face, and as he did not speak, I said, lamely enough: "This is
  a grievous and terrible thing, Mr Monkhouse."</p>

  <p>He shook his head gravely. "Grievous indeed; and the more so if one
  suspects, as I do, that it need not have happened. However, he is gone and
  recriminations will not bring him back."</p>

  <p>"No," I agreed, profoundly relieved and a little surprised at his tone;
  "whatever we may feel or think, reproaches and bitter words will bring no
  remedy. Have you seen Barbara?"</p>

  <p>"No; and I think I won't&mdash;this morning. In a day or two, I hope I
  shall be able to meet and speak to her as a Christian man should. Today I am
  not sure of myself. You will let me know what arrangements are made about the
  funeral?"</p>

  <p>I promised that I would, and walked with him to the head of the stairs,
  and when I had watched him descend and heard the street door close, I went
  back to Barbara's little sitting-room.</p>

  <p>I found her alone, and, when I entered she was standing before a miniature
  that hung on the wall. She looked round as I entered and I saw that she still
  looked rather dazed and strange. Her eyes were red, as if she had been
  weeping, but they were now tearless, and she seemed calmer than when I had
  first seen her. I went to her side, and for a few moments we stood silently
  regarding the smiling, girlish face that looked out at us from the miniature.
  It was that of Barbara's step-sister, a very sweet, loveable girl, little
  more than a child, who had died some four years previously, and who, I had
  sometimes thought, was the only human creature for whom Barbara had felt a
  really deep affection. The miniature had been painted from a photograph after
  her death and a narrow plait of her gorgeous, red-gold hair had been carried
  round inside the frame.</p>

  <p>"Poor little Stella!" Barbara murmured, "I have been asking myself if I
  neglected her, too. I often left her for days at a time."</p>

  <p>"You mustn't be morbid, Barbara," I said. "The poor child was very well
  looked after and as happy as she could be made. And nobody could have done
  any more for her. Rapid consumption is beyond the resources of medical
  science at present."</p>

  <p>"Yes, unfortunately." She was silent for a while. Then she said: "I wonder
  if anything could have been done for Harold. Do you think it possible that he
  might have been saved?"</p>

  <p>"I know of no reason for thinking so, and now that he is gone I see no use
  in raising the question."</p>

  <p>She drew closer to me and slipped her hand into mine.</p>

  <p>"You will be with us as much as you can, Rupert, won't you? We always look
  to you in trouble or difficulty, and you have never failed us. Even now you
  don't condemn me, whatever you may think."</p>

  <p>"No, I blame myself for not being more alert, though it was really
  Dimsdale who misled us all. Has Madeline gone to the school?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. She had to give a lecture or demonstration, but I hope she will
  manage to get a day or two off duty. I don't want to be left alone with poor
  Tony. It sounds unkind to say so, for no one could be more devoted to me than
  he is. But he is so terribly high-strung. Just now, he is in an almost
  hysterical state. I suppose you haven't seen him this morning?"</p>

  <p>"No. I came straight up to you." I had, in fact, kept out of his way, for,
  to speak the truth, I did not much care for Anthony Wallingford. He was of a
  type that I dislike rather intensely; nervous, high-strung, emotional and in
  an incessant state of purposeless bustle. I did not like his appearance, his
  manners or his dress. I resented the abject fawning way in which he followed
  Barbara about, and I disapproved of his position in this house; which was
  nominally that of secretary to Barbara's husband, but actually that of tame
  cat and generally useless hanger-on. I think I was on the point of making
  some disparaging comments on him, but at that moment there came a gentle tap
  at the door and the subject of my thoughts entered.</p>

  <p>I was rather sorry that Barbara was still holding my hand. Of course, the
  circumstances were very exceptional, but I have an Englishman's dislike of
  emotional demonstrations in the presence of third parties. Nevertheless,
  Wallingford's behaviour filled me with amazed resentment. He stopped short
  with a face black as thunder, and, after a brief, insolent stare, muttered
  that he was afraid he was "intruding" and walked out of the room, closing the
  door sharply after him.</p>

  <p>Barbara flushed (and I daresay I did, too), but made no outward sign of
  annoyance. "You see what I mean," she said. "The poor fellow is quite
  unstrung. He is an added anxiety instead of a help."</p>

  <p>"I see that plainly enough," I replied, "but I don't see why he is
  unstrung, or why an unstrung man should behave like an ill-mannered child. At
  any rate, he will have to pull himself together. There is a good deal to be
  done and he will have to do some of it. I may assume, I suppose, that it will
  be his duty to carry out the instructions of the executors?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so. But you know more about such things than I do."</p>

  <p>"Then I had better go down and explain the position to him and set him to
  work. Presently I must call on Mr Brodribb, the other executor, and let him
  know what has happened. But meanwhile there are certain things which have to
  be done at once. You understand?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed. You mean arrangements for the funeral. How horrible it
  sounds. I can't realize it yet. It is all so shocking and so sudden and
  unlooked-for. It seems like some dreadful dream."</p>

  <p>"Well, Barbara," I said gently, "you shan't, be troubled more than is
  unavoidable. I will see to all the domestic affairs and leave the legal
  business to Brodribb. But I shall want Wallingford's help, and I think I had
  better go down and see him now."</p>

  <p>"Very well, Rupert," she replied with a sigh. "I shall lean on you now as
  I always have done in times of trouble and difficulty, and you must try to
  imagine how grateful I am since I can find no words to tell you."</p>

  <p>She pressed my hand and released me, and I took my way down to the library
  with a strong distaste for my mission.</p>

  <p>That distaste was not lessened when I opened the door and was met by a
  reek of cigarette smoke. Wallingford was sitting huddled up in an easy chair,
  but as I entered, he sprang to his feet and stood facing me with a sort of
  hostile apprehensiveness. The man was certainly unstrung; in fact he was on
  wires. His pale, haggard face twitched, his hands trembled visibly and his
  limbs were in constant, fidgety movement. But, to me, there seemed to be no
  mystery about his condition. The deep yellow stains on his fingers, the reek
  in the air and a pile of cigarette-ends in an ash-bowl were enough to account
  for a good deal of nervous derangement, even if there were nothing
  more&mdash;no drugs or drink.</p>

  <p>I opened the business quietly, explaining what had to be done and what
  help I should require from him. At first he showed a tendency to dispute my
  authority and treat me as an outsider, but I soon made the position and
  powers of an executor clear to him. When I had brought him to heel I gave him
  a set of written instructions the following-out of which would keep him
  fairly busy for the rest of the day; and having set the dismal preparations
  going, I went forth from the house of mourning and took my way to New Square,
  Lincoln's Inn, where were the offices of Mr Brodribb, the family solicitor
  and my co-executor.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3"
     id="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; A SHOCK FOR THE MOURNERS</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was on the day of the funeral that the faint, unheeded
  mutterings of the approaching storm began to swell into audible and
  threatening rumblings, though, even then, the ominous signs failed to deliver
  their full significance.</p>

  <p>How well do I recall the scene in the darkened dining room where we sat in
  our sable raiment, "ready to wenden on our pilgrimage" to the place of
  everlasting rest and eternal farewell. There were but four of us, for Amos
  Monkhouse had not yet arrived, though it was within a few minutes of the
  appointed time to start; quite a small party; for the deceased had but few
  relatives, and no outsiders had been bidden.</p>

  <p>We were all rather silent. Intimate as we were, there was no need to make
  conversation. Each, no doubt, was busy with his or her own thoughts, and as I
  recall my own they seem to have been rather trivial and not very suitable to
  the occasion. Now and again I stole a look at Barbara and thought what a
  fine, handsome woman she was, and dimly wondered why, in all the years that I
  had known her, I had never fallen in love with her. Yet so it was. I had
  always admired her; we had been intimate friends, with a certain amount of
  quiet affection, but nothing more&mdash;at any rate on my part. Of her I was
  not so sure. There had been a time, some years before, when I had had an
  uneasy feeling that she looked to me for something more than friendship. But
  she was always a reticent girl; very self-reliant and self-contained. I never
  knew a woman better able to keep her own counsel or control her emotions.</p>

  <p>She was now quite herself again, quiet, dignified, rather reserved and
  even a little inscrutable. Seated between Wallingford and Madeline, she
  seemed unconscious of either and quite undisturbed by the secretary's
  incessant nervous fidgeting and by his ill-concealed efforts to bring himself
  to her notice.</p>

  <p>From Barbara my glance turned to the woman who sat by her side noting with
  dull interest the contrast between the two; a contrast as marked in their
  bearing as in their appearance. For whereas Barbara was a rather big woman,
  dark in colouring, quiet and resolute in manner, Madeline Norris was somewhat
  small and slight, almost delicately fair, rather shy and retiring, but yet
  with a suggestion of mental alertness under the diffident manner. If Barbara
  gave an impression of quiet strength, Madeline's pretty, refined face was
  rather expressive of subtle intelligence. But what chiefly impressed me at
  this moment was the curious inversion of their attitudes towards the existing
  circumstances; for whereas Barbara, the person mainly affected, maintained a
  quiet, untroubled demeanour, Madeline appeared to be overcome by the sudden
  catastrophe. Looking at her set, white face and the dismay in her wide, grey
  eyes, and comparing her with the woman at her side, a stranger would at once
  have assumed the bereavement to be hers.</p>

  <p>My observations were interrupted by Wallingford once more dragging out his
  watch.</p>

  <p>"What on earth can have happened to Mr Amos?" he exclaimed "We are due to
  start in three minutes. If he isn't here by then we shall have to start
  without him. It is perfectly scandalous! Positively indecent! But there, it's
  just like a parson."</p>

  <p>"My experience of parsons," said I, "is that they are, as a rule,
  scrupulously punctual. But certainly, Mr Amos is unpardonably late. It will
  be very awkward if he doesn't arrive in time. Ah, there he is," I added as
  the bell rang and a muffled knock at the street door was heard.</p>

  <p>At the sound, Wallingford sprang up as if the bell had actuated a hidden
  spring in the chair, and darted over to the window, from which he peered out
  through the chink beside the blind.</p>

  <p>"It isn't Amos," he reported. "It's a stranger, and a fool at that, I
  should say, if he can't see that all the blinds are down."</p>

  <p>We all listened intently. We heard the housemaid's hurried footsteps,
  though she ran on tip-toe; the door opened softly, and then, after an
  interval, we heard some one ushered along the hall to the drawing room. A few
  moments later, Mabel entered with an obviously scandalized air.</p>

  <p>"A gentleman wishes to speak to you, Ma'am," she announced.</p>

  <p>"But, Mabel," said Barbara, "did you tell him what is happening in this
  house?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Ma'am, I explained exactly how things were and told him that he must
  call tomorrow. But he said that his business was urgent and that he must see
  you at once."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Barbara. "I will go and see what he wants. But it is
  very extraordinary."</p>

  <p>She rose, and nearly colliding with Wallingford, who had rushed to open
  the door&mdash;which was, in fact, wide open&mdash;walked out quickly,
  closing the door after her. After a short interval&mdash;during which
  Wallingford paced the room excitedly, peered out of the window, sat down, got
  up again and looked at his watch&mdash;she came back, and, standing in the
  doorway, looked at me.</p>

  <p>"Would you come here for a minute, Rupert," she said, quietly.</p>

  <p>I rose at once and walked back with her to the drawing room, on entering
  which I became aware of a large man, standing monumentally on the hearth-rug
  and inspecting the interior of his hat. He looked to me like a plainclothes
  policeman, and my surmise was verified by a printed card which he presented
  and which bore the inscription "Sergeant J Burton."</p>

  <p>"I am acting as coroner's officer," he explained in reply to my
  interrogatory glance, "and I have come to notify you that the funeral will
  have to be postponed as the coroner has decided to hold an inquest; I have
  seen the undertakers and explained matters to them."</p>

  <p>"Do you know what reason there is for an inquest?" I asked. "The cause of
  death was certified in the regular way."</p>

  <p>"I know nothing beyond my instructions, which were to notify Mrs Monkhouse
  that the funeral is put off and to serve the summonses for the witnesses. I
  may as well do that now."</p>

  <p>With this he laid on the table six small blue papers, which I saw were
  addressed respectively to Barbara, Madeline, Wallingford, the housemaid, the
  cook and myself.</p>

  <p>"Have you no idea at all why an inquest is to be held?" I asked as I
  gathered up the papers.</p>

  <p>"I have no information," he replied, cautiously, "but I expect there is
  some doubt about the exact cause of death. The certificate may not be quite
  clear or it may be that some interested party has communicated with the
  coroner. That is what usually happens, you know, Sir. But at any rate," he
  added, cheerfully, "you will know all about it the day after tomorrow, which,
  you will observe, is the day fixed for the inquest."</p>

  <p>"And what have we to do meanwhile?" Barbara asked. "The inquest will not
  be held in this house, I presume."</p>

  <p>"Certainly not, Madam," the sergeant replied. "A hearse will be sent round
  tonight to remove the body to the mortuary, where the post mortem examination
  will be carried out, and the inquest will be held in the parish hall, as is
  stated on the summons. I am sorry that you should be put to this
  inconvenience," he concluded, moving tentatively towards the door,
  "but&mdash;er&mdash;it couldn't be helped, I suppose. Good morning,
  Madam."</p>

  <p>I walked with him to the door and let him out, while Barbara waited for me
  in the hall, not unobserved by Wallingford, whose eye appeared in a chink
  beside the slightly open dining room door. I pointedly led her back into the
  drawing room and closed the door audibly behind us. She turned a pale and
  rather shocked face to me but she spoke quite composedly as she asked: "What
  do you make of it, Rupert? Is it Amos?"</p>

  <p>I had already reluctantly decided that it must be. I say, reluctantly,
  because, if this were really his doing, the resigned tone of his last words
  to me would appear no less than sheer, gross hypocrisy.</p>

  <p>"I don't know who else it could be," I answered. "The fact that he did not
  come this morning suggests that he at least knew what was happening. If he
  did, I think he might have warned us."</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed. It will be a horrid scandal; most unpleasant for us all, and
  especially for me. Not that I am entitled to any sympathy. Poor Harold! How
  he would have hated the thought of a public fuss over his body. I suppose we
  must go in now and tell the others. Do you mind telling them, Rupert?"</p>

  <p>We crossed the hall to the dining room where we found the two waiting
  impatiently, Madeline very pale and agitated while Wallingford was pacing the
  room like a wild beast. Both looked at us with eager interrogation as we
  entered, and I made the announcement bluntly and in a dozen words.</p>

  <p>The effect on both was electrical. Madeline, with a little cry of horror,
  sank, white-faced and trembling, into a chair. As for Wallingford, his
  behaviour was positively maniacal. After staring at me for a few moments with
  starting eyes and mouth agape, he flung up his arms and uttered a hoarse
  shout.</p>

  <p>"This," he yelled, "is the doing of that accursed parson! Now we know why
  he kept out of the way&mdash;and it is well for him that he did!"</p>

  <p>He clenched his fists and glared around him, showing his tobacco-stained
  teeth in a furious snarl while the sweat gathered in beads on his livid face.
  Then, suddenly, his mood changed and he dropped heavily on a chair, burying
  his face in his shaking hands. Barbara admonished him, quietly.</p>

  <p>"Do try to be calm, Tony. There is nothing to get so excited about. It is
  all very unpleasant and humiliating, of course, but at any rate you are not
  affected. It is I who will be called to account."</p>

  <p>"And do you suppose that doesn't affect me?" demanded Wallingford, now
  almost on the verge of tears.</p>

  <p>"I am sure it does, Tony," she replied, gently, "but if you want to be
  helpful to me you will try to be calm and reasonable. Come, now," she added,
  persuasively, "let us put it away for the present. I must tell the servants.
  Then we had better have lunch and go our several ways to think the matter
  over quietly each of us alone. We shall only agitate one another if we remain
  together."</p>

  <p>I agreed emphatically with this sensible suggestion. "Not," I added, "that
  there is much for us to think over. The explanations will have to come from
  Dimsdale. It was he who failed to grasp the seriousness of poor Harold's
  condition."</p>

  <p>While Barbara was absent, breaking the news to the servants, I tried to
  bring Madeline to a more composed frame of mind. With Wallingford I had no
  patience. Men should leave hysterics to the other sex. But I was sorry for
  Madeline; and even if she seemed more overwhelmed by the sudden complications
  than the occasion justified, I told myself that the blow had fallen when she
  was already shaken by Harold's unexpected death.</p>

  <p>The luncheon was a silent and comfortless function; indeed it was little
  more than an empty form. But it had the merit of brevity. When the last dish
  had been sent away almost intact, Wallingford drew out his cigarette case and
  we all rose.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do, Madeline?" Barbara asked.</p>

  <p>"I must go to the school, I suppose, and let the secretary know
  that&mdash;that I may have to be absent for a day or two. It will be horrid.
  I shall have to tell him all about it&mdash;after having got leave for the
  funeral. But it will sound so strange, so extraordinary. Oh! It is
  horrible!"</p>

  <p>"It is!" exclaimed Wallingford, fumbling with tremulous fingers at his
  cigarette case. "It is diabolical! A fiendish plot to disgrace and humiliate
  us. As to that infernal parson, I should like&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind that. Tony," said Barbara; "and we had better not stay here,
  working up one another's emotions. What are you doing, Rupert?"</p>

  <p>"I shall go to my chambers and clear off some correspondence."</p>

  <p>"Then you might walk part of the way with Madeline and see if you can't
  make her mind a little more easy."</p>

  <p>Madeline looked at me eagerly. "Will you, Rupert?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Of course I assented, and a few minutes later we set forth together.</p>

  <p>For a while she walked by my side in silence with an air of deep
  reflection, and I refrained from interrupting her thoughts, having no very
  clear idea as to what I should say to her. Moreover, my own mind was pretty
  busily occupied. Presently she spoke, in a tentative way, as if opening a
  discussion.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid you must think me very weak and silly to be so much upset by
  this new trouble."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, I don't," I replied. "It is a most disturbing and humiliating
  affair and it will be intensely unpleasant for us all, but especially for
  Barbara&mdash;to say nothing of Dimsdale."</p>

  <p>"Dr Dimsdale is not our concern," said she, "but it will be perfectly
  horrible for Barbara. For she really has been rather casual, poor girl, and
  they are sure to make things unpleasant for her. It will be a most horrid
  scandal. Don't you think so?"</p>

  <p>To be candid, I did. Indeed, I had just been picturing to myself the
  possibilities with an officious coroner&mdash;and he would not need to be so
  very officious, either&mdash;and one or two cross-grained jurymen. Barbara
  might be subjected to a very unpleasant examination. But I did not think it
  necessary to say this to Madeline. Sufficient for the day is the evil
  thereof. I contented myself with a vague agreement.</p>

  <p>There was another interval of silence. Then, a little to my surprise, she
  drew closer to me, and, slipping her hand under my arm, said very earnestly:
  "Rupert, I want you to tell me what you really think. What is it all
  about?"</p>

  <p>I looked down, rather disconcerted, into the face that was turned up to me
  so appealingly; and suddenly&mdash;and rather irrelevantly&mdash;it was borne
  in on me that it was a singularly sweet and charming face. I had never quite
  realized it before. But then she had never before looked at me quite in this
  way; with this trustful, coaxing, appealing expression.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite understand you, Madeline," I said, evasively. "I know no
  more about it than you do."</p>

  <p>"Oh, but you do, Rupert. You are a lawyer and you have had a lot of
  experience. You must have formed some opinion as to why they have decided to
  hold an inquest. Do tell me what you think."</p>

  <p>The coaxing, almost wheedling tone, and the entreaty in her eyes, looking
  so earnestly into mine, nearly conquered my reserve. But not quite. Once more
  I temporized.</p>

  <p>"Well, Madeline, we all realize that what Dimsdale has written on the
  certificate is little more than a guess, and quite possibly wrong; and even
  Detling couldn't get much farther."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I realize that. But I didn't think that inquests were held just to
  find out whether the doctors' opinions were correct or not."</p>

  <p>Of course she was perfectly right; and I now perceived that her thoughts
  had been travelling along the same lines as my own. An inquest would not be
  held merely to clear up an obscure diagnosis. There was certainly something
  more behind this affair than Dimsdale's failure to recognize the exact nature
  of the illness. There was only one simple explanation of the coroner's
  action, and I gave it&mdash;with a strong suspicion that it was not the right
  one.</p>

  <p>"They are not, as a rule, excepting in hospitals. But this is a special
  case. Amos Monkhouse was obviously dissatisfied with Dimsdale, and with
  Barbara, too. He may have challenged the death certificate and asked for an
  inquest. The coroner would be hardly likely to refuse, especially if there
  were a hint of negligence or malpractice."</p>

  <p>"Did Mr Amos say anything to you that makes you think he may have
  challenged the certificate?"</p>

  <p>"He said very little to me at all," I replied, rather casuistically and
  suppressing the fact that Amos had explicitly accepted the actual
  circumstances and deprecated any kind of recrimination.</p>

  <p>"I can hardly believe that he would have done it," said Madeline, "just to
  punish Barbara and Dr Dimsdale. It would be so vindictive, especially for a
  clergyman."</p>

  <p>"Clergymen are very human sometimes," I rejoined; and, as, rather to my
  relief, we now came in sight of Madeline's destination, I adverted to the
  interview which she seemed to dread so much. "There is no occasion for you to
  go into details with the secretary," I said. "In fact you can't. The exact
  cause of death was not clear to the doctors and it has been considered
  advisable to hold an inquest. That is all you know, and it is enough. You are
  summoned as a witness and you are legally bound to attend, so you are asking
  no favour. Cut the interview dead short, and when you have done with it, try,
  like a sensible girl, to forget the inquest for the present. I shall come
  over tomorrow and then we can reconstitute the history of the case, so that
  we may go into the witness-box, or its equivalent, with a clear idea of what
  we have to tell. And now, good-bye, or rather au revoir!"</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, Rupert." She took my proffered hand and held it as she thanked
  me for walking with her. "Do you know, Rupert," she added, "there is
  something strangely comforting and reassuring about you. We all feel it. You
  seem to carry an atmosphere of quiet strength and security. I don't wonder
  that Barbara is so fond of you. Not," she concluded, "that she holds a
  monopoly."</p>

  <p>With this she let go my hand, and, with a slightly shy smile and the
  faintest suspicion of a blush, turned away and walked quickly and with an air
  quite cheerful and composed towards the gateway of the institution.
  Apparently, my society had had a beneficial effect on her nervous
  condition.</p>

  <p>I watched her until she disappeared into the entry, and then resumed my
  journey eastward, rather relieved, I fear, at having disposed of my
  companion. For I wanted to think&mdash;of her among other matters; and it was
  she who first occupied my cogitations. The change from her usual
  matter-of-fact friendliness had rather taken me by surprise; and I had to
  admit that it was not a disagreeable surprise. But what was the explanation?
  Was this intimate, clinging manner merely a passing phase due to an emotional
  upset, or was it that the special circumstances had allowed feelings hitherto
  concealed to come to the surface? It was an interesting question, but one
  that time alone could answer; and as there were other questions, equally
  interesting and more urgent, I consigned this one to the future and turned to
  consider the others.</p>

  <p>What could be the meaning of this inquest? The supposition that Amos had
  suddenly turned vindictive and resolved to expose the neglect, to which he
  probably attributed his brother's death, I could not entertain, especially
  after what he had said to me. It would have written him down the rankest of
  hypocrites. And yet he was in some way connected with the affair as was
  proved by his failure to appear at the funeral. As to the idea that the
  inquiry was merely to elucidate the nature of the illness, that was quite
  untenable. A private autopsy would have been the proper procedure for that
  purpose.</p>

  <p>I was still turning the question over in my mind when, as I passed the
  Griffin at Temple Bar, I became aware of a tall figure some distance ahead
  walking in the same direction. The build of the man and his long, swinging
  stride seemed familiar. I looked at him more attentively; and just as he
  turned to enter Devereux Court I recognized him definitely as a fellow
  Templar named Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>The chance encounter seemed a singularly fortunate one, and at once I
  quickened my pace to overtake him. For Dr Thorndyke was a medical barrister
  and admittedly the greatest living authority on medical jurisprudence. The
  whole subject of inquests and Coroners' Law was an open book to him. But he
  was not only a lawyer. He had, I understood, a professional and very thorough
  knowledge of pathology and of the science of medicine in general, so that he
  was the very man to enlighten me in my present difficulties.</p>

  <p>I overtook him at the Little Gate of the Middle Temple and we walked
  through together into New Court. I wasted no time, but, after the preliminary
  greetings, asked him if he had a few minutes to spare. He replied, in his
  quiet, genial way: "But, of course, Mayfield. I always have a few minutes to
  spare for a friend and a colleague."</p>

  <p>I thanked him for the gracious reply, and, as we slowly descended the
  steps and sauntered across Fountain Court, I opened the matter without
  preamble and gave him a condensed summary of the case; to which lie listened
  with close attention and evidently with keen interest.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," he said, "that your family doctor will cut rather a poor
  figure. He seems to have mismanaged the case rather badly, to judge by the
  fact that the death of the patient took him quite by surprise. By the way,
  can you give me any idea of the symptoms&mdash;as observed by yourself, I
  mean?"</p>

  <p>"I have told you what was on the certificate."</p>

  <p>"Yes. But the certified cause of death appears to be contested. You saw
  the patient pretty often, I understand. Now what sort of appearance did he
  present to you?"</p>

  <p>The question rather surprised me. Dimsdale's opinion might not be worth
  much, but the casual and inexpert observations of a layman would have seemed
  to me to be worth nothing at all. However, I tried to recall such details as
  I could remember of poor Monkhouse's appearance and his own comments on his
  condition and recounted them to Thorndyke with such amplifications as his
  questions elicited. "But," I concluded, "the real question is, who has set
  the coroner in motion and with what object?"</p>

  <p>"That question," said Thorndyke, "will be answered the day after tomorrow,
  and there is not much utility in trying to guess at the answer in advance.
  The real question is whether any arrangements ought to be made in the
  interests of your friends. We are quite in the dark as to what may occur in
  the course of the inquest."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I had thought of that. Some one ought to be present to represent Mrs
  Monkhouse. I suppose it would not be possible for you to attend to watch the
  case on her behalf?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think it would be advisable," he replied. "You will be present
  and could claim to represent Mrs Monkhouse so far as might be necessary to
  prevent improper questions being put to her. But I do think that you should
  have a complete record of all that takes place. I would suggest that I send
  Holman, who does most of my shorthand reporting, with instructions to make a
  verbatim report of the entire proceedings. It may turn out to be quite
  unnecessary; but if any complications should arise, we shall have the
  complete depositions with the added advantage that you will have been present
  and will have heard all the evidence. How will that suit you?"</p>

  <p>"If you think it is the best plan there is nothing more to say, excepting
  to thank you for your help."</p>

  <p>"And give me a written note of the time and place to hand to Holman when I
  give him his instructions."</p>

  <p>I complied with this request at once; and having by this time reached the
  end of the Terrace, I shook hands with him and walked slowly to my chambers
  in Fig Tree Court. I had not got much out of Thorndyke excepting a very
  useful suggestion and some valuable help; indeed, as I turned over his
  extremely cautious utterances and speculated on what he meant by
  "complications." I found myself rather more uncomfortably puzzled than I had
  been before I met him.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch4"
     id="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; "HOW, WHEN AND WHERE&mdash;"</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was on the second day after the interrupted funeral that
  the thunderbolt fell. I cannot say that it found me entirely unprepared, for
  my reflections during the intervening day had filled me with forebodings; and
  by Thorndyke that catastrophe was pretty plainly foreseen. But on the others
  the blow fell with devastating effect. However, I must not anticipate. Rather
  let me get back to a consecutive narration of the actual events.</p>

  <p>On the day after the visit of the coroner's officer we had held, at my
  suggestion, a sort of family committee to consider what we knew of the
  circumstances and antecedents of Harold's death, so that we might be in a
  position to give our evidence clearly and readily and be in agreement as to
  the leading facts. Thus we went to the coroners court prepared, at least, to
  tell an intelligible and consistent story.</p>

  <p>As soon as I entered the large room in which the inquest was to be held,
  my forebodings deepened. The row of expectant reporters was such as one does
  not find where the proceedings are to be no more than a simple, routine
  inquiry. Something of public interest was anticipated, and these gentlemen of
  the Press had received a hint from some well-informed quarter. I ran my eye
  along the row and was somewhat relieved to observe Mr Holman, Thorndyke's
  private reporter, seated at the table with a large note-book and a half-dozen
  well-sharpened pencils before him. His presence&mdash;as, in a sense,
  Thorndyke's deputy&mdash;gave me the reassuring feeling that, if there were
  to be "complications," I should not have to meet them with my own limited
  knowledge and experience, but that there were reserves of special knowledge
  and weighty counsel on which I could fall back.</p>

  <p>The coroner's manner seemed to me ominous. His introductory address to the
  jury was curt and ambiguous, setting forth no more than the name of the
  deceased and the fact that circumstances had seemed to render an inquiry
  advisable; and having said this, he proceeded forthwith (the jury having
  already viewed the body) to call the first witness, the Reverend Amos
  Monkhouse.</p>

  <p>I need not repeat the clergyman's evidence in detail. When he had
  identified the body as that of his brother, Harold, he went on to relate the
  events which I have recorded: his visit to his sick brother, his alarm at the
  patient's appearance, his call upon Dr Dimsdale and his subsequent interview
  with Sir Robert Detling. It was all told in a very concise, matter-of-fact
  manner, and I noted that the coroner did not seek to amplify the condensed
  statement by any questions.</p>

  <p>"At about nine o'clock in the morning of the 13th," the witness continued,
  "I received a telegram from Miss Norris informing me that my brother had died
  in the night. I went out at once and sent a telegram to Sir Robert Detling
  informing him of what had happened. I then went to number 16 Hilborough
  Square, where I saw the body of deceased lying in his bed quite cold and
  stiff. I saw nobody at the house excepting the housemaid and Mr Mayfield.
  After leaving the house I walked about the streets for several hours and did
  not return to my hotel until late in the afternoon. When I arrived there, I
  found awaiting me a telegram from Sir Robert Detling asking me to call on him
  without delay. I set forth at once and arrived at Sir Roberts house at
  half-past five, and was shown into his study immediately. Sir Robert then
  told me that he had come to the conclusion that the circumstances of my
  brother's death called for some investigation and that he proposed to
  communicate with the coroner. He urged me not to raise any objections and
  advised me to say nothing to anyone but to wait until the coroner's decision
  was made known. I asked him for his reasons for communicating with the
  coroner, but he said that he would rather not make any statement. I heard no
  more until the morning of the fifteenth, the day appointed for the funeral,
  when the coroner's officer called at my hotel to inform me that the funeral
  would not take place and to serve the summons for my attendance here as a
  witness."</p>

  <p>When Amos had concluded his statement, the coroner glanced at the Jury,
  and as no one offered to put any questions, he dismissed the witness and
  called the next&mdash;Mabel Withers&mdash;who, at once, came forward to the
  table. Having been sworn and having given her name, the witness deposed that
  she had been housemaid to deceased and that it was she who had discovered the
  fact of his death, relating the circumstances in much the same words as I
  have recorded. When she had finished her narrative, the coroner said: "You
  have told us that the candle in the deceased's lamp was completely burnt out.
  Do you happen to know how long one of those candles would burn?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. About four hours."</p>

  <p>"When did you last see deceased alive?"</p>

  <p>"At half-past ten on Tuesday night, the twelfth. I looked in at his room
  on my way up to bed to see if he wanted anything, and I gave him a dose of
  medicine."</p>

  <p>"What was his condition then?"</p>

  <p>"He looked very ill, but he seemed fairly comfortable. He had a book in
  his hand but was not reading."</p>

  <p>"Was the candle alight then?"</p>

  <p>"No, the gas was alight. I asked him if I should turn it out but he said
  'no.' He would wait until Miss Norris or Mr Wallingford came."</p>

  <p>"Did you notice how much candle there was in the lamp then?"</p>

  <p>"There was a whole candle. I put it in myself in the afternoon and it had
  not been lit. He used to read by the gas as long as it was alight. He only
  used the candle-lamp if he couldn't sleep and the gas was out."</p>

  <p>"Could you form any opinion as to how long the candle had been burnt
  out?"</p>

  <p>"It must have been out some time, for there was no smell in the room as
  there would have been if it had only been out a short time. The window was
  hardly open at all; only just a small crack."</p>

  <p>"Do you know when deceased last took food?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, he had his supper at eight o'clock; an omelette and a tiny piece of
  toast with a glass of milk."</p>

  <p>"Who cooked the omelette?"</p>

  <p>"Miss Norris."</p>

  <p>"Why did Miss Norris cook it? Was the cook out?"</p>

  <p>"No. But Miss Norris usually cooked his supper and sometimes made little
  dishes for his lunch. She is a very expert cook."</p>

  <p>"Who took the omelette up to deceased?"</p>

  <p>"Miss Norris. I asked if I should take his supper up, but she said she was
  going up and would take it herself."</p>

  <p>"Was anyone else present when Miss Norris was cooking the omelette?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I was present and so was the cook."</p>

  <p>"Did deceased usually have the same food as the rest of the
  household?"</p>

  <p>"No, he usually had his own special diet."</p>

  <p>"Who prepared his food, as a rule?"</p>

  <p>"Sometimes the cook, but more often Miss Norris."</p>

  <p>"Now, with regard to his medicine. Did deceased usually take it
  himself?"</p>

  <p>"No, he didn't like to have the bottle on the bedside table, as it was
  rather crowded with his books and things. The bottle and the medicine-glass
  were kept on the mantelpiece and the medicine was given to him by whoever
  happened to be in the room when a dose was due. Sometimes I gave it to him;
  at other times Mrs Monkhouse or Miss Norris or Mr Wallingford."</p>

  <p>"Do you remember when the last bottle of medicine came?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. It came early in the afternoon of the day before he died. I took it
  in and carried it up at once."</p>

  <p>When he had written down this answer, the coroner ran his eye through his
  previous notes and then glanced at the jury.</p>

  <p>"Do any of you gentlemen wish to ask the witness any questions?" he
  enquired; and as no one answered, he dismissed the witness with the request
  that she would stay in the court in case any further testimony should be
  required of her. He then announced that he would take the evidence of Sir
  Robert Detling next in order to release him for his probably numerous
  engagements. Sir Robert's name was accordingly called and a grave-looking,
  elderly gentleman rose from near the doorway and walked up to the table. When
  the new witness had been sworn and the formal preliminaries disposed of, the
  coroner said: "I will ask you. Sir Robert, to give the jury an account of the
  circumstances which led to your making a certain communication to me."</p>

  <p>Sir Robert bowed gravely and proceeded at once to make his statement in
  the clear, precise manner of a practised speaker.</p>

  <p>"On Friday, the 8th instant, the Reverend Amos Monkhouse called on me to
  arrange a consultation with Dr Dimsdale who was in attendance on his brother,
  the deceased. I met Dr Dimsdale by appointment the following afternoon, the
  9th, and with him made a careful examination of deceased. I was extremely
  puzzled by the patient's condition. He was obviously very seriously&mdash;I
  thought, dangerously&mdash;ill, but I was unable to discover any signs or
  symptoms that satisfactorily accounted for his grave general condition. I
  could not give his disease a name. Eventually, I took a number of blood-films
  and some specimens of the secretions to submit to a pathologist for
  examination and to have them tested for micro-organisms. I took them that
  night to Professor Garnett's laboratory, but the professor was unfortunately
  absent and not returning until the following night&mdash;Sunday. I therefore
  kept them until Sunday night when I took them to him and asked him to examine
  them with as little delay as possible. He reported on the following day that
  microscopical examination had not brought to light anything abnormal, but he
  was making cultures from the secretions and would report the result on
  Wednesday morning. On Wednesday morning at about half-past nine, I received a
  telegram from the Reverend Amos Monkhouse informing me that his brother had
  died during the night. A few minutes later, a messenger brought Professor
  Garnett's report; which was to the effect that no disease-bearing organisms
  had been found, nor any thing abnormal excepting a rather singular scarcity
  of micro-organisms of any kind.</p>

  <p>"This fact, together with the death of the patient, suddenly aroused my
  suspicions. For the absence of the ordinary micro-organisms suggested the
  presence of some foreign chemical substance. And now, as I recalled the
  patient's symptoms, I found them consistent with the presence in the body of
  some foreign substance. Instantly, I made my way to Professor Garnett's
  laboratory and communicated my suspicions to him. I found that he shared them
  and had carefully preserved the remainder of the material for further
  examination. We both suspected the presence of a foreign substance, and we
  both suspected it to be arsenic.</p>

  <p>"The professor had at hand the means of making a chemical test, so we
  proceeded at once to use them. The test that we employed was the one known as
  Reinsch's test. The result showed a very appreciable amount of arsenic in the
  secretions tested. On this, I sealed up what was left of the specimens, and,
  after notifying Mr Monkhouse of my intention, reported the circumstances to
  the coroner."</p>

  <p>When Sir Robert ceased speaking, the coroner bowed, and having written
  down the last words, reflected for a few moments. Then he turned to the jury
  and said: "I don't think we need detain Sir Robert any longer unless there
  are any questions that you would like to ask."</p>

  <p>At this point the usual over-intelligent juryman interposed.</p>

  <p>"We should like to know whether the vessels in which the specimens were
  contained were perfectly clean and free from chemicals."</p>

  <p>"The bottles," Sir Robert replied, "were clean in the ordinary sense. I
  rinsed them out with clean water before introducing the material. But, of
  course, they could not be guaranteed to be chemically clean."</p>

  <p>"Then doesn't that invalidate the analysis?" the juror asked.</p>

  <p>"It was hardly an analysis," the witness replied. "It was just a
  preliminary test."</p>

  <p>"The point which you are raising, Sir," said the coroner, "is quite a
  sound one but it is not relevant to this inquiry. Sir Robert's test was made
  to ascertain if an inquiry was necessary. He decided that it was, and we are
  now holding that inquiry. You will not form your verdict on the results of
  Sir Robert's test but on those of the post mortem examination and the special
  analysis that has been made."</p>

  <p>This explanation appeared to satisfy the juror and Sir Robert was allowed
  to depart. The coroner once more seemed to consider awhile and then addressed
  the jury.</p>

  <p>"I think it will be best to take next the evidence relating to the
  examination of the body. When you have heard that you will be better able to
  weigh the significance of what the other witnesses have to tell us. We will
  now take the evidence of Dr Randall."</p>

  <p>As the new witness, a small, dry, eminently professional-looking man,
  stepped briskly up to the table, I stole a quick, rather furtive glance at my
  companions and saw my own alarm plainly reflected in their faces and bearing.
  Barbara, on my left hand, sat up stiffly, rigid as a statue, her face pale
  and set, but quite composed, her eyes fixed on the man who was about to be
  sworn. Madeline, on my right, was ghastly. But she, too, was still and quiet,
  sitting with her hands tightly clasped, as if to restrain or conceal their
  trembling, and her eyes bent on the floor. As to Wallingford, who sat on the
  other side of Barbara, I could not see his face, but by his foot, which I
  could see and hear, tapping quickly on the floor as if he were working a
  spinning-wheel, and his incessantly moving hands, I judged that his nerves
  were at full tension.</p>

  <p>The new witness deposed that his name was Walter Randall, that he was a
  Bachelor of Medicine and police surgeon of the district and that he had made
  a careful examination of the body of deceased and that, with Dr Barnes, he
  had made an analysis of certain parts of that body.</p>

  <p>"To anticipate a little," said the coroner, "did you arrive at an opinion
  as to the cause of death?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. From the post mortem examination and the analysis taken together, I
  came to the conclusion that deceased died from the effects of arsenic
  poisoning."</p>

  <p>"Have you any doubt that arsenic poisoning was really the cause of the
  deceased's death?"</p>

  <p>"No, I have no doubt whatever."</p>

  <p>The reply, uttered with quiet decision, elicited a low murmur from the
  jury and the few spectators, amidst which I heard Madeline gasp in a choking
  whisper, "Oh! God!" and even Barbara was moved to a low cry of horror. But I
  did not dare to look at either of them. As for me, the blow had fallen
  already. Sir Robert's evidence had told me all.</p>

  <p>"You said," the coroner resumed, "that the post mortem and the analysis,
  taken together, led you to this conclusion. What did you mean by that?"</p>

  <p>"I meant that the appearance of the internal organs, taken alone, would
  not have been conclusive. The conditions that I found were suggestive of
  arsenic poisoning but might possibly have been due to disease. It was only
  the ascertained presence of arsenic that converted the probability into
  certainty."</p>

  <p>"You are quite sure that the conditions were not due to disease?"</p>

  <p>"Not entirely. I would rather say that the effects of arsenical poisoning
  were added to and mingled with those of old-standing disease."</p>

  <p>"Would you tell us briefly what abnormal conditions you found?"</p>

  <p>"The most important were those in the stomach, which showed marked signs
  of inflammation."</p>

  <p>"You are aware that the death certificate gives old-standing chronic
  gastritis as one of the causes of death?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and I think correctly. The arsenical gastritis was engrafted on an
  already existing chronic gastritis. That is what made the appearances rather
  difficult to interpret, especially as the post mortem appearances in
  arsenical poisoning are extraordinarily variable."</p>

  <p>"What else did you find?"</p>

  <p>"There were no other conditions that were directly associated with the
  poison. The heart was rather fatty and dilated, and its condition probably
  accounts for the sudden collapse which seems to have occurred."</p>

  <p>"Does not collapse usually occur in poisoning by arsenic?"</p>

  <p>"Eventually it does, but it is usually the last of a long train of
  symptoms. In some cases, however, collapse occurs quite early and may carry
  the victim off at once. That is what appears from the housemaid's evidence to
  have happened in this case. Death seems to have been sudden and almost
  peaceful."</p>

  <p>"Were there any other signs of disease?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, the lungs were affected. There were signs of considerable bronchial
  catarrh, but I do not regard this as having any connection with the effects
  of the poison. It appeared to be an old-standing condition."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the coroner. "The certificate mentions chronic bronchial
  catarrh of several years' standing. Did you find any arsenic in the
  stomach?"</p>

  <p>"Not in the solid form and only a little more than a hundredth of a grain
  altogether. The stomach was practically empty. The other organs were
  practically free from disease, excepting, perhaps, the kidneys, which were
  congested but not organically diseased."</p>

  <p>"And as to the amount of arsenic present?"</p>

  <p>"The analysis was necessarily a rather hasty one and probably shows less
  than the actual quantity; but we found, as I have said, just over a hundredth
  of a grain in the stomach, one and a half grains in the liver, nearly a fifth
  of a grain in the kidneys and small quantities, amounting in all to two
  grains, in the blood and tissues. The total amount actually found was thus a
  little over three and a half grains&mdash;a lethal dose."</p>

  <p>"What is the fatal dose of arsenic?"</p>

  <p>"Two grains may prove fatal if taken in solution, as it appears to have
  been in this case. Two and a half grains, in a couple of ounces of fly-paper
  water, killed a strong, healthy girl of nineteen in thirty-six hours."</p>

  <p>"And how long does a poisonous dose take to produce death?"</p>

  <p>"The shortest period recorded is twenty minutes, the longest, over three
  weeks."</p>

  <p>"Did you come to any general conclusion as to how long deceased had been
  suffering from the effects of arsenic and as to the manner in which it had
  been administered?"</p>

  <p>"From the distribution of the poison in the organs and tissues and from
  the appearance of the body, I inferred that the administration of arsenic had
  been going on for a considerable time. There were signs of chronic poisoning
  which led me to believe that for quite a long time&mdash;perhaps
  months&mdash;deceased had been taking repeated small doses of the poison, and
  that the final dose took such rapid effect by reason of the enfeebled state
  of the deceased at the time when it was administered."</p>

  <p>"And as to the mode of administration? Did you ascertain that?"</p>

  <p>"In part, I ascertained it quite definitely. When the bearers went to the
  house to fetch the body, I accompanied them and took the opportunity to
  examine the bedroom. There I found on the mantelpiece a bottle of medicine
  with the name of deceased on the label and brought it away with me. It was an
  eight ounce bottle containing when full eight doses, of which only one had
  been taken. Dr Barnes and I, together, analyzed the remaining seven ounces of
  the medicine and obtained from it just over eleven grains of arsenic; that is
  a fraction over a grain and a half in each ounce dose. The arsenic was in
  solution and had been introduced into the medicine in the form of the
  solution known officially as Liquor Arsenicalis, or Fowler's Solution."</p>

  <p>"That is perfectly definite," said the coroner. "But you said that you
  ascertained the mode of administration in part. Do you mean that you inferred
  the existence of some other vehicle?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. A single dose of this medicine contained only a grain and a half of
  arsenic, which would hardly account for the effects produced or the amount of
  arsenic which was found in the body. Of course, the preceding dose from the
  other bottle may have contained the poison, too, or it may have been taken in
  some other way."</p>

  <p>"What other way do you suggest?"</p>

  <p>"I can merely suggest possibilities. A meal was taken about eight o'clock.
  If that meal had contained a small quantity of arsenic&mdash;even a single
  grain&mdash;that, added to what was in the medicine, would have been enough
  to cause death. But there is no evidence whatever that the food did contain
  arsenic."</p>

  <p>"If the previous dose of medicine had contained the same quantity of the
  poison as the one that was last taken, would that account for the death of
  deceased?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He would then have taken over three grains in four hours&mdash;more
  than the minimum fatal dose."</p>

  <p>"Did you see the other&mdash;the empty medicine bottle?"</p>

  <p>"No. I looked for it and should have taken possession of it, but it was
  not there."</p>

  <p>"Is there anything else that you have to tell us concerning your
  examination?"</p>

  <p>"No, I think I have told you all I know about the case."</p>

  <p>The coroner cast an interrogatory glance at the jury, and when none of
  them accepted the implied invitation, he released the witness and named Dr
  Barnes as his successor.</p>

  <p>I need not record in detail the evidence of this witness. Having deposed
  that he was a Doctor of Science and lecturer in Chemistry at St Martha's
  Medical College, he proceeded to confirm Dr Randall's evidence as to the
  analysis, giving somewhat fuller and more precise details. He had been
  present at the autopsy, but he was not a pathologist and was not competent to
  describe the condition of the body. He had analyzed the contents of the
  medicine bottle with Dr Randall's assistance and he confirmed the last
  witness's statement as to the quantity of arsenic found and the form in which
  it had been introduced&mdash;Fowler's Solution.</p>

  <p>"What is the strength of Fowler's Solution?"</p>

  <p>"It contains four grains of arsenic&mdash;or, more strictly, of arsenious
  acid&mdash;to the fluid ounce. So that, as the full bottle of medicine must
  have contained just over twelve and a half grains of arsenious acid, the
  quantity of Fowler's Solution introduced must have been a little over three
  fluid ounces; three point fourteen, to be exact."</p>

  <p>"You are confident that it was Fowler's Solution that was used?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; the chemical analysis showed that; but in addition, there was the
  colour and the smell. Fowler's Solution is coloured red with Red Sandalwood
  and scented with Tincture of Lavender as a precaution against accidents.
  Otherwise it would be colourless, odourless and tasteless, like water."</p>

  <p>On the conclusion of Dr Barnes' evidence, the coroner remarked to the
  jury: "I think we ought to be clear on the facts with regard to this
  medicine. Let Mabel Withers be recalled."</p>

  <p>Once more the housemaid took her place by the table and the coroner
  resumed the examination.</p>

  <p>"You say that the last bottle of medicine came early in the afternoon. Can
  you tell us the exact time?"</p>

  <p>"It was about a quarter to three. I remember that because when I took up
  the new bottle, I asked Mr Monkhouse if he had had his medicine and he said
  that his brother, Mr Amos Monkhouse, had given him a dose at two o'clock just
  before he left."</p>

  <p>"Did you open the fresh bottle?"</p>

  <p>"I took off the paper wrapping and the cap but I didn't take the cork
  out."</p>

  <p>"Was the old bottle empty then?"</p>

  <p>"No; there was one dose left in it. That would be due at six o'clock."</p>

  <p>"Do you know what became of the old bottle?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. When I had given him his last dose&mdash;that was out of the new
  bottle&mdash;I took the old bottle away and washed it at once."</p>

  <p>"Why did you wash the bottle?"</p>

  <p>"The used medicine bottles were always washed and sent back to Dr
  Dimsdale."</p>

  <p>"Did you send back the corks, too?"</p>

  <p>"No, the corks were usually burned in the rubbish destructor."</p>

  <p>"Do you know what happened to this particular cork?"</p>

  <p>"I took it down with me in the morning and dropped it in the bin which was
  kept for the rubbish to be taken out to the destructor. The cork must have
  been burned with the other rubbish the same day."</p>

  <p>"When you gave deceased that last dose of medicine from the new bottle,
  did you notice anything unusual about it? Any smell, for instance?"</p>

  <p>"I noticed a very faint smell of lavender. But that was not unusual. His
  medicine often smelt of lavender."</p>

  <p>"Do you know if the previous bottle of medicine smelt of lavender?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it did. I noticed it when I was washing out the bottle."</p>

  <p>"That, gentlemen," said the coroner, as he wrote down the answer, "is a
  very important fact. You will notice that it bears out Dr Randall's opinion
  that more than one dose of the poison had been given; that, in fact, a number
  of repeated small doses had been administered. And, so far as we can see at
  present, the medicine was, at least, the principal medium of its
  administration. The next problem that we have to solve is how the poison got
  into the medicine. If none of you wish to put any questions to the very
  intelligent witness whom we have just been examining, I think we had better
  call Dr Dimsdale and hear what he has to tell us."</p>

  <p>The jury had no questions to put to Mabel but were manifestly all agog to
  hear Dr Dimsdale's evidence. The housemaid was accordingly sent back to her
  seat, and the doctor stepped briskly&mdash;almost too briskly, I
  thought&mdash;up to the table.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch5"
     id="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; MADELINE'S ORDEAL</h2>

  <p class="first">I WAS rather sorry for Dimsdale. His position was a very
  disagreeable one and he fully realized it. His patient had been poisoned
  before his very eyes and he had never suspected even grave illness. In a
  sense, the death of Harold Monkhouse lay at his door and it was pretty
  certain that every one present would hold him accountable for the disaster.
  Indeed, it was likely that he would receive less than justice. Those who
  judged him would hardly stop to reflect on the extraordinary difficulties
  that beset a busy medical man whose patient is being secretly poisoned; would
  fail to consider the immense number of cases of illness presented to him in
  the course of years of practice and the infinitely remote probability that
  any one of them is a case of poison. The immense majority of doctors pass
  through the whole of their professional lives without meeting with such a
  case; and it is not surprising that when the infinitely rare contingency
  arises, it nearly always takes the practitioner unawares. My own amazement at
  this incredible horror tended to make me sympathetic towards Dimsdale and it
  was with some relief that I noted the courteous and considerate manner that
  the coroner adopted in dealing with the new witness.</p>

  <p>"I think," the former observed, "that we had better, in the first place,
  pursue our inquiries concerning the medicine. You have heard the evidence of
  Dr Randall and Dr Barnes. This bottle of medicine, before any was taken from
  it, contained twelve and a half grains of arsenious acid, in the form of just
  over three fluid ounces of Fowler's Solution. Can you suggest any explanation
  of that fact?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Dimsdale, "I cannot."</p>

  <p>"What should the bottle have contained? What was the composition of the
  medicine?"</p>

  <p>"The medicine was just a simple, very mild tonic and alternative. The
  bottle contained twenty-four minims of Tincture of Nux Vomica, sixteen minims
  of Liquor Arsenicalis, half a fluid ounce of Syrup of Bitter Orange to cover
  the taste of the Nux Vomica and half an ounce of Compound Tincture of
  Cardamoms. So that each dose contained three minims of Tincture of Nux Vomica
  and two minims of Liquor Arsenicalis."</p>

  <p>"Liquor Arsenicalis is another name for Fowler's Solution, I
  understand?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is the official name; the other is the popular name."</p>

  <p>"Who supplied this medicine?"</p>

  <p>"It was supplied by me."</p>

  <p>"Do you usually supply your patients with medicine?"</p>

  <p>"No. Only a few of my old patients who prefer to have their medicine from
  me. Usually, I write prescriptions which my patients have made up by
  chemists."</p>

  <p>"This bottle, then, was made up in your own dispensary?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Now, I put it to you, Dr Dimsdale: this medicine did actually contain
  Fowler's Solution, according to the prescription. Is it not possible that
  some mistake may have occurred in the amount put into the bottle?"</p>

  <p>"No, it is quite impossible."</p>

  <p>"Why is it impossible?"</p>

  <p>"Because I made up this particular bottle myself. As my dispenser is not a
  qualified pharmacist, I always dispense, with my own hands, any medicines
  containing poisons. All dangerous drugs are kept in a poison cupboard under
  lock and key, and I carry the key on my private bunch. This is the key, and
  as you see, the lock is a Yale lock."</p>

  <p>He held up the bunch with the little flat key separated, for the coroner's
  and the jurymen's inspection.</p>

  <p>"But," said the coroner, "you have not made it clear that a mistake in the
  quantity was impossible."</p>

  <p>"I was coming to that." replied Dimsdale. "The poisons in the cupboard
  are, of course, powerful drugs which are given only in small doses, and a
  special measure-glass is kept in the cupboard to measure them. This glass
  holds only two drachms&mdash;a hundred and twenty minims, that is, a quarter
  of an ounce. Now, the analysts found in this bottle three fluid ounces of
  Fowler's Solution. But to measure out that quantity, I should have had to
  fill the measure-glass twelve times! That is impossible. No one could do such
  a thing as that inadvertently, especially when he was dispensing poisons.</p>

  <p>"But that is not all. The poison bottles are all quite small. The one in
  which the Liquor Arsenicalis is kept is a four ounce bottle. It happened that
  I had refilled it a few days previously and it was full when I dispensed this
  medicine. Now, obviously, if I had put three ounces of the Liquor into the
  medicine bottle, there would have remained in the dispensing bottle only one
  ounce. But the dispensing bottle is still practically full. I had occasion to
  use it this morning and I found it full save for the few minims that had been
  taken to make up the deceased's medicine.</p>

  <p>"And there is another point. This medicine was coloured a deepish pink by
  the Tincture of Cardamoms. But if it had contained three ounces of Fowler's
  Solution in addition, it would have been a deep red of quite a different
  character. But I clearly remember the appearance of the bottle as it lay on
  the white paper when I was wrapping it up. It had the delicate pink colour
  that is imparted by the cochineal in the Tincture of Cardamoms."</p>

  <p>The coroner nodded as he wrote down the reply, and enquired:</p>

  <p>"Would any of you, gentlemen, like to ask any questions concerning the
  bottle of medicine?"</p>

  <p>"We should like to know. Sir," said the foreman, "whether this bottle of
  medicine ever left the doctor's hands before it was sent to deceased?"</p>

  <p>"No, it did not," replied Dimsdale. "As the dispenser was absent, I put up
  the bottle entirely myself. I put in the cork, wrote the label, tied on the
  paper cap, wrapped the bottle up, sealed the wrapping, addressed it and gave
  it to the boy to deliver."</p>

  <p>The foreman expressed himself as fully satisfied with this answer and the
  coroner then resumed: "Well, we seem to have disposed of the medicine so far
  as you are concerned, Doctor. We will now go on to consider the condition of
  deceased during the last few days. Did no suspicion of anything abnormal ever
  occur to you?"</p>

  <p>"No, I neither perceived nor suspected anything abnormal."</p>

  <p>"Is that not rather remarkable? I realize that poisoning would be the last
  thing that you would be looking for or expecting. But when it occurred, is it
  not a little strange that you did not recognize the symptoms?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all," replied Dimsdale. "There was nothing to recognize. The
  classical symptoms of arsenic poisoning were entirely absent. You will
  remember that Sir Robert Detling had no more suspicion than I had."</p>

  <p>"What are the classical symptoms, as you call them, of arsenic
  poisoning?"</p>

  <p>"The recognized symptoms&mdash;which are present in the immense majority
  of cases&mdash;are acute abdominal pain and tenderness, intense thirst,
  nausea, vomiting and purging: the symptoms, in fact, of extreme irritation of
  the stomach and intestines. But in the case of deceased, these symptoms were
  entirely absent. There was, in my opinion, nothing whatever in his appearance
  or symptoms to suggest arsenic poisoning. His condition appeared in no way
  different from what I had known it to be on several previous occasions; just
  a variation for the worse of his ordinary ill-health."</p>

  <p>"You do not doubt that arsenic poisoning was really the cause of his
  death?"</p>

  <p>"The analysis seems to put the matter beyond question; otherwise&mdash;I
  mean apart from the analysis&mdash;I would not have entertained the idea of
  arsenic poisoning for a moment."</p>

  <p>"But you do not dispute the cause of death?"</p>

  <p>"No. Arsenic is extraordinarily variable in its effects, as Dr Randall
  mentioned, both on the dead body and on the living. Very anomalous cases of
  arsenic poisoning have been mistaken, during life, for opium poisoning."</p>

  <p>The coroner wrote down the answer and having glanced over his notes,
  asked: "What was the condition of deceased when his wife went away from
  home?"</p>

  <p>"He was much better. In fact his health seemed to be improving so much
  that I hoped he would soon be about again."</p>

  <p>"And how soon after his wife's departure did his last attack begin?"</p>

  <p>"I should hardly call it an attack. It was a gradual change for the worse.
  Mrs Monkhouse went away on the 29th of August. On the 2nd of September
  deceased was not so well and was extremely depressed and disappointed at the
  relapse. From that time his condition fluctuated, sometimes a little better
  and sometimes not so well. On the 8th he appeared rather seriously ill and
  was no better on the 9th, the day of the consultation with Sir Robert Detling
  After that he seemed to improve a little, and the slight improvement was
  maintained up to the 12th. His death came, at least to me, as quite a
  surprise."</p>

  <p>"You spoke just now of several previous occasions on which
  attacks&mdash;or, if you prefer it, relapses&mdash;of a similar kind
  occurred. Looking back on those relapses by the light of what we now know, do
  you say that they were quite similar, in respect of the symptoms, to the one
  which ended in the death of deceased?"</p>

  <p>"I should say they were identically similar. At any rate, I can recall no
  difference."</p>

  <p>"Did any of them seem to be as severe as the fatal one?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; in fact the last of them&mdash;which occurred in June&mdash;seemed
  to be more severe, only that it was followed by improvement and recovery. I
  have here the section of my card-index which relates to deceased. In the
  entry dated June 19 you will see that I have noted the patient's
  unsatisfactory condition."</p>

  <p>He handed a small pack of index-cards to the coroner, who examined the
  upper card intently and then, with a sudden raising of the eyebrows,
  addressed the jury.</p>

  <p>"I had better read out the entry. The card is headed 'Harold Monkhouse'
  and this entry reads: 'June 19. Patient very low and feeble. No appetite.
  Considerable gastric discomfort and troublesome cough. Pulse 90, small,
  thready. Heart sounds weak. Sending report to Mrs Monkhouse.'"</p>

  <p>He laid the cards down on the table, and, looking fixedly at Dimsdale,
  repeated: "'Sending report to Mrs Monkhouse?' Where was Mrs Monkhouse?"</p>

  <p>"Somewhere in Kent, I believe. I sent the report to the headquarters of
  the Women's Freedom League in Knightrider Street, Maidstone, from whence I
  supposed it would be forwarded to her."</p>

  <p>For some seconds after receiving this answer the coroner continued to gaze
  steadily at the witness. At length he observed: "This is a remarkable
  coincidence. Can you recall the condition of deceased when Mrs Monkhouse went
  away on that occasion?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I remember that he was in comparatively good health. In fact, his
  improved condition furnished the opportunity for Mrs Monkhouse to make her
  visit to Maidstone."</p>

  <p>"Can you tell us how soon after her departure on that occasion the relapse
  occurred?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot say definitely, but my impression is that the change for the
  worse began a few days after she went away. Perhaps I might be able to judge
  by looking at my notes."</p>

  <p>The coroner handed him back the index-cards, which he looked through
  rapidly. "Yes," he said, at length, "here is an entry on June 11 of a bottle
  of tonic medicine for Mrs Monkhouse. So she must have been at home on that
  date; and as it was a double-sized bottle, it was probably for her to take
  away with her."</p>

  <p>"Then," said the coroner, "it is clear that, on the last two occasions,
  the deceased was comparatively well when his wife left home, but had a
  serious relapse soon after she went away. Now, what of the previous
  relapses?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I cannot remember. I have an impression that Mrs Monkhouse
  was away from home when some of them occurred, but at this distance of time,
  I cannot recollect clearly. Possibly Mrs Monkhouse, herself, may be able to
  remember."</p>

  <p>"Possibly," the coroner agreed, rather drily, "but as the point is of
  considerable importance, I should be glad if you would presently look through
  your case cards and see if you can glean any definite information on the
  subject. Meanwhile we may pass on to one or two other matters. First as to
  the medicine which you prescribed for deceased; it contained, as you have
  told us, a certain amount of Fowler's Solution, and you considered deceased
  to be suffering from chronic gastritis. Is Fowler's Solution usually given in
  cases of gastritis?"</p>

  <p>"No. It is usually considered rather unsuitable. But deceased was very
  tolerant of small doses of arsenic. I had often given it to him before as a
  tonic and it had always seemed to agree with him. The dose was extremely
  small&mdash;only two minims."</p>

  <p>"How long have you known deceased?"</p>

  <p>"I have known, and attended him professionally about twenty years."</p>

  <p>"From your knowledge of him, should you say that he was a man who was
  likely to make enemies?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all. He was a kindly, just and generous man, amiable and
  even-tempered; rather reserved and aloof; not very human, perhaps, and
  somewhat self-contained and solitary. But I could not imagine him making an
  enemy and, so far as I know, he never did."</p>

  <p>The coroner reflected awhile after writing down this answer and then
  turned to the jury.</p>

  <p>"Are there any questions that you wish to put to the witness,
  gentlemen?"</p>

  <p>The jury consulted together for a few moments, and the foreman then
  replied: "We should like to know, Sir, if possible, whether Mrs Monkhouse was
  or was not away from home when the previous relapses occurred."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," said Dimsdale, "that I cannot be more explicit as the
  events occurred so long ago. The other witnesses&mdash;the members of the
  household&mdash;would be much more likely to remember. And I would urge you
  not to detain me from my professional duties longer than is absolutely
  necessary."</p>

  <p>Hereupon a brief consultation took place between the coroner and the jury,
  with the result that Dimsdale was allowed to go about his business and
  Barbara was summoned to take his place. I had awaited this stage of the
  proceedings with some uneasiness and was now rather surprised and greatly
  relieved at the coroner's manner towards her; which was courteous and even
  sympathetic. Having expressed his and the jury's regret at having to trouble
  her in the very distressing circumstances, he proceeded at once to clear off
  the preliminaries, eliciting the facts that she was 32 years of age and had
  been married a little over three years, and then said: "Dr Dimsdale has told
  us that on the occasion of the attack or relapse in June last you were away
  from home, but he is not certain about the previous ones. Can you give us any
  information on the subject?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she replied, in a quiet, steady voice, "I recall quite clearly at
  least three previous occasions on which I went away from home leaving my
  husband apparently well&mdash;as well as he ever was&mdash;and came back to
  find him quite ill. But I think there were more than three occasions on which
  this happened, for I remember having once accused him, facetiously, of saving
  up his illnesses until I was out of the house."</p>

  <p>"Can you remember if a serious relapse ever occurred when you were at
  home?"</p>

  <p>"Not a really serious one. My husband's health was always very unstable
  and he often had to rest in bed for a day or two. But the really bad attacks
  of illness seem always to have occurred when I was away from home."</p>

  <p>"Did it never strike you that this was a very remarkable fact?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I did not give the matter as much consideration as I ought to
  have done. Deceased was always ailing, more or less, and those about him came
  to accept ill-health as his normal condition."</p>

  <p>"But you see the significance of it now?"</p>

  <p>Barbara hesitated and then replied in a low voice and with evident
  agitation: "I see that it may have some significance, but I don't in the
  least understand it. I am quite overwhelmed and bewildered by the dreadful
  thing that has happened."</p>

  <p>"Naturally, you are," the coroner said in a sympathetic tone, "and I am
  most reluctant to trouble you with questions under circumstances that must be
  so terrible to you. But we must find out the truth if we can."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I realize that," she replied, "and thank you for your
  consideration."</p>

  <p>The coroner bowed, and after a brief pause, asked: "Did it never occur to
  you to engage a nurse to attend to deceased?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I suggested it more than once to deceased, but he wouldn't hear of
  it. And I think he was right. There was nothing that a nurse could have done
  for him. He was not helpless and he was not continuously bed-ridden. He had a
  bell-push by his bedside and his secretary or the servants were always ready
  to do anything that he wanted done. The housemaid was most attentive to him.
  But he did not want much attention. He kept the books that he was reading on
  his bedside table and he liked to be left alone to read in peace. He felt
  that the presence of a nurse would have been disturbing."</p>

  <p>"And at night?"</p>

  <p>"At night his bell-push was connected with a bell in the secretary's
  bedroom. But he hardly ever used it. If his candle-lamp burned out he could
  put in a fresh candle from the box on his table; and he never seemed to want
  anything else."</p>

  <p>"Besides deceased and yourself, who were the inmates of the house?"</p>

  <p>"There was my husband's secretary, Mr Wallingford, Miss Norris, the cook,
  Anne Baker, the housemaid, Mabel Withers, and the kitchenmaid, Doris
  Brown."</p>

  <p>"Why did deceased need a secretary? Did he transact much business?"</p>

  <p>"No. The secretary wrote his few business letters, kept the accounts and
  executed any commissions, besides doing the various things that the master of
  the house would ordinarily have done. He is the son of an old friend of my
  husband's, and he came to us when his father died."</p>

  <p>"And Miss Norris? What was her position in the household?"</p>

  <p>"She lived with us as a guest at my husband's invitation. She was the
  daughter of his first wife's sister, and he, more or less informally, adopted
  her as he had no children of his own."</p>

  <p>"Deceased was a widower, then, when you married him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. His wife had been dead about two years."</p>

  <p>"What was his age when he died?"</p>

  <p>"He had just turned fifty-seven."</p>

  <p>"On what sort of terms was deceased with the members of his
  household?"</p>

  <p>"On the best of terms with them all. He was an undemonstrative man and
  rather cool and reserved with strangers and distinctly solitary and
  self-contained. But he was a kind and generous man and all the household,
  including the servants, were devoted to him."</p>

  <p>"Was deceased engaged in any business or profession?"</p>

  <p>"No, he had independent means, inherited from his father."</p>

  <p>"Would you describe him as a wealthy man?"</p>

  <p>"I believe he was quite well off, but he never spoke of his financial
  affairs to me, or to anybody but his lawyers."</p>

  <p>"Do you know how his property is disposed of?"</p>

  <p>"I know that he made a will, but I never enquired about the terms of it
  and he never told me."</p>

  <p>"But surely you were an interested party."</p>

  <p>"It was understood that some provision would be made for me if I survived
  him. That was all that concerned me. Deceased was not a man with whom it was
  necessary to make conditions; and I have some small property of my own. Mr
  Mayfield, who is present, of course, knows what the provisions of the will
  are as he is one of the executors."</p>

  <p>Once more the coroner paused to look over his notes. Then he glanced
  inquiringly at the jury, and, when the foreman shook his head, he thanked
  Barbara and dismissed her; and as she walked back to her chair, pale and
  grave but perfectly composed, I found myself admiring her calm dignity and
  only hoping that the other witnesses would make as good a figure. But this
  hope was no sooner conceived than it was shattered. The next name that was
  called was Madeline Norris and for a few moments there was no response. At
  length Madeline rose slowly, ashen and ghastly of face, and walked unsteadily
  to the table. Her appearance&mdash;her deathly pallor and her trembling
  hands&mdash;struck me with dismay; and what increased my concern for the
  unfortunate girl was the subtle change in manner that I detected in the jury
  and the coroner. The poor girl's manifest agitation might surely have
  bespoken their sympathy; but not a sign of sympathy was discernible in their
  faces&mdash;nothing but a stony curiosity.</p>

  <p>Having been sworn&mdash;on a testament which shook visibly in her
  grasp&mdash;she deposed that her name was Madeline Norris and her age
  twenty-seven.</p>

  <p>"Any occupation?" the coroner enquired drily without looking up.</p>

  <p>"I am a teacher at the Westminster College of Domestic Science."</p>

  <p>"Teacher of what?"</p>

  <p>"Principally of cookery and kitchen management, especially invalid
  cookery."</p>

  <p>"Are you, yourself, a skilled cook?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. It is my duty to demonstrate to the class."</p>

  <p>"Have you ever cooked or prepared food for the deceased?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I usually cooked his meals when I was in the house at meal
  times."</p>

  <p>"It has been stated that you prepared the last meal that deceased took. Is
  that correct?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I cooked an omelette for his supper."</p>

  <p>"Will you describe to us the way in which you prepared that omelette?"</p>

  <p>Madeline considered for a few moments and then replied in a low, shaky
  voice: "It was just a simple omelette. I first rubbed the pan with a cut
  clove of garlic and put in the butter to heat. Then I broke an egg into a
  cup, separated the yolk from the white, and, having beaten them up
  separately, mixed them and added a very small portion of pounded anchovy, a
  pinch or two of finely chopped parsley and a little salt. I cooked it in the
  usual way and turned it out on a hot plate which I covered at once."</p>

  <p>"Who took it up to deceased?"</p>

  <p>"I did. I ran straight up with it and sat and talked to deceased while he
  ate it."</p>

  <p>"Did you meet anyone on your way up or in the bedroom?"</p>

  <p>"No. There was nobody on the stairs, and, the deceased was alone."</p>

  <p>"Did deceased take anything to drink with his supper?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He had a glass of chablis. I fetched the bottle and the glass from
  the dining room and poured out the wine for him."</p>

  <p>"Did you meet anybody in the dining room or coming or going?"</p>

  <p>"No, I met nobody."</p>

  <p>"Can you think of any way in which any poison could have got into the
  omelette or into the wine?"</p>

  <p>"No. Nothing could possibly have got into the omelette. As to the wine, I
  poured it from the bottle into a clean glass. But the bottle was already open
  and had been in the cellaret since lunch."</p>

  <p>"Now, with regard to the medicine. Did you give deceased any on the day
  before his death?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I gave him a dose soon after I came in&mdash;about six o'clock. That
  was the last dose in the bottle."</p>

  <p>"Did you notice anything unusual about the medicine?"</p>

  <p>"No. It was similar to what he had been taking for some days past."</p>

  <p>"What was the medicine like?"</p>

  <p>"It was nearly colourless with the faintest tinge of red and smelled
  slightly of lavender and bitter orange."</p>

  <p>"Was there anything that caused you to notice particularly, on this
  occasion, the appearance and smell of the medicine?"</p>

  <p>"No. I noticed the colour and the smell when I opened the bottle on the
  previous morning to give deceased a dose."</p>

  <p>"Did you examine the new bottle which had just been sent?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; I looked at it and took out the cork and smelled it and tasted
  it."</p>

  <p>"What made you do that?"</p>

  <p>"I noticed that it seemed to contain Tincture of Cardamoms and I smelled
  and tasted it to find out if the other ingredients had been changed."</p>

  <p>"And what conclusion did you arrive at?"</p>

  <p>"That they had not been changed. I could taste the Nux Vomica and smell
  the orange and the Liquor Arsenicalis&mdash;at least the lavender."</p>

  <p>"Did you realize what the lavender smell was due to?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I recognized it as the smell of Liquor Arsenicalis. I knew that
  deceased was taking Liquor Arsenicalis because I had asked Dr Dimsdale about
  it when I first noticed the smell."</p>

  <p>The coroner wrote down this answer and then, raising his head, looked
  steadily at Madeline for some seconds without speaking; and the jury looked
  harder still. At length the former spoke, slowly, deliberately,
  emphatically.</p>

  <p>"You have told us that you examined this medicine to find out what it
  contained, and that you were able to recognize Tincture of Cardamoms by its
  colour and Liquor Arsenicalis by its smell. It would seem, then, that you
  know a good deal about drugs. Is that so?"</p>

  <p>"I know something about drugs. My father was a doctor and he taught me
  simple dispensing so that I could help him."</p>

  <p>The coroner nodded. "Was there any reason why you should have taken so
  much interest in the composition of deceased's medicine?"</p>

  <p>Madeline did not answer immediately. And as she stood trembling and
  hesitating in evident confusion, the coroner gazed at her stonily, and the
  jury craned forward to catch her reply.</p>

  <p>"I used to examine his medicine," she replied at length, in a low voice
  and a reluctant and confused manner, "because I knew that it often contained
  Liquor Arsenicalis and I used to wonder whether that was good for him. I
  understood from my father that it was a rather irritating drug, and it did
  not seem very suitable for a patient who suffered from gastritis."</p>

  <p>There was a pause after she had spoken and something in the appearance of
  the inquisitors almost as if they had been a little disappointed by this
  eminently reasonable answer. At length the coroner broke the silence by
  asking, with a slight softening of manner:</p>

  <p>"You have said that the change in colour of the last medicine led you to
  taste and smell it to ascertain if the other ingredients had been changed.
  You have said that you decided that they had not been changed. Are you sure
  of that? Can you swear that the smell of lavender was not stronger in this
  bottle than in the previous ones?"</p>

  <p>"It did not seem to me to be stronger."</p>

  <p>"Supposing the bottle had then contained as much Liquor Arsenicalis as was
  found in it by the analysts, would you have been able to detect it by the
  smell or otherwise?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I feel sure that I should. The analysts found three ounces of Liquor
  Arsenicalis; that would be nearly half the bottle. I am sure I should have
  detected that amount, not only by the strong smell but by the colour,
  too."</p>

  <p>"You are sure that the colour of this medicine was due to Cardamoms
  only?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is to cochineal. I recognized it at once. It is perfectly
  unmistakable and quite different from the colour of Red Sandalwood, with
  which Liquor Arsenicalis is coloured. Besides, this medicine was only a
  deepish pink in colour. But if three ounces of Liquor Arsenicalis had been in
  the bottle, the medicine would have been quite a dark red."</p>

  <p>"You have had some experience in dispensing. Do you consider it possible
  that the Liquor Arsenicalis could have been put into the medicine by mistake
  when it was being made up?"</p>

  <p>"It would be quite impossible if a minim measure-glass was used, as the
  glass would have had to be filled twelve times. But this is never done. One
  does not measure large quantities in small measures. Three ounces would be
  measured out in a four or five ounce measure, as a rule, or, possibly in a
  two ounce measure, by half refilling it."</p>

  <p>"Might not the wrong measure-glass have been taken up by mistake?"</p>

  <p>"That is, of course, just possible. But it is most unlikely; for the great
  disproportion between the large measure-glass and the little stock-bottle
  would be so striking that it could hardly fail to be noticed."</p>

  <p>"Then, from your own observation and from Dr Dimsdale's evidence, you
  reject the idea that a mistake may have been made in dispensing this bottle
  of medicine?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, entirely. I have heard Dr Dimsdale's evidence and I examined the
  medicine. I am convinced that he could not have made a mistake under the
  circumstances that he described and I am certain that the medicine that I saw
  did not contain more than a small quantity&mdash;less than a drachm&mdash;of
  Liquor Arsenicalis."</p>

  <p>"You are not forgetting that the analysts actually found the equivalent of
  three ounces of Liquor Arsenicalis in the bottle?"</p>

  <p>"No. But I am sure it was not there when I examined the bottle."</p>

  <p>The coroner wrote down this answer with a deliberate air, and, when he had
  finished, turned to the jury.</p>

  <p>"I think we have nothing more to ask this witness, unless there is any
  point that you want made more clear."</p>

  <p>There was a brief silence. Then the super-intelligent juryman
  interposed.</p>

  <p>"I should like to know if this witness ever had any Liquor Arsenicalis in
  her possession."</p>

  <p>The coroner held up a warning hand to Madeline, and replied:</p>

  <p>"That question, Sir, is not admissible. It is a principle of English law
  that a witness cannot be compelled to make a statement incriminating
  him&mdash;or herself. But an affirmative answer to this question would be an
  incriminating statement."</p>

  <p>"But I am perfectly willing to answer the question," Madeline said
  eagerly. "I have never had in my possession any Liquor Arsenicalis or any
  other preparation of arsenic."</p>

  <p>"That answers your question, Sir," said the coroner, as he wrote down the
  answer, "and if you have nothing more to ask, we can release the
  witness."</p>

  <p>He handed his pen to Madeline, and when she had signed her
  depositions&mdash;a terribly shaky signature it must have been&mdash;she came
  back to her chair, still very pale and agitated, but obviously relieved at
  having got through the ordeal. I had taken her arm as she sat down and was
  complimenting her on the really admirable way in which she had given her
  evidence, when I heard the name of Anthony Wallingford called and realized
  that another unpleasant episode had arrived.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch6"
     id="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; THE VERDICT</h2>

  <p class="first">I HAD not been taking much notice of Wallingford, my
  attention being occupied with the two women when it strayed from the
  proceedings. Beyond an irritated consciousness of his usual restless
  movements, I had no information as to how the soul-shaking incidents of this
  appalling day were affecting him. But when he rose drunkenly and, grasping
  the back of his chair, rolled his eyes wildly round the Court, I realized
  that there were breakers ahead.</p>

  <p>When I say that he rose drunkenly, I use the word advisedly. Familiar as I
  was with his peculiarities&mdash;his jerkings, twitchings and
  grimacings&mdash;I saw, at once, that there was something unusual both in his
  face and in his bearing; a dull wildness of expression and an uncertainty of
  movement that I had never observed before. He had not come to the Court with
  the rest of us, preferring, for some reason, to come alone. And I now
  suspected that he had taken the opportunity to fortify himself on the
  way.</p>

  <p>I was not the only observer of his condition. As he walked, with
  deliberate care, from his seat to the table, I noticed the coroner eyeing him
  critically and the jury exchanging dubious glances and whispered comments. He
  made a bad start by dropping the book on the floor and sniggering nervously
  as he stooped to pick it up; and I could see plainly, by the stiffness of the
  coroner's manner that he had made an unfavourable impression before he began
  his evidence.</p>

  <p>"You were secretary to the deceased?" said the coroner, when the witness
  had stated his name, age (33) and occupation. "What was the nature of your
  duties?"</p>

  <p>"The ordinary duties of a secretary," was the dogged reply.</p>

  <p>"Will you kindly give us particulars of what you did for deceased?"</p>

  <p>"I opened his business letters and answered them and some of his private
  ones. And I kept his accounts and paid his bills."</p>

  <p>"What accounts would those be? Deceased was not in business, I
  understand?"</p>

  <p>"No, they were his domestic accounts; his income from investments and
  rents and his expenditure."</p>

  <p>"Did you attend upon deceased personally; I mean in the way of looking
  after his bodily comfort and supplying his needs?"</p>

  <p>"I used to look in on him from time to time to see if he wanted anything
  done. But it wasn't my business to wait on him. I was his secretary, not his
  valet."</p>

  <p>"Who did wait on him, and attend to his wants?"</p>

  <p>"The housemaid, chiefly, and Miss Norris, and of course, Mrs Monkhouse.
  But he didn't usually want much but his food, his medicine, a few books from
  the library and a supply of candles for his lamp. His bell-push was connected
  with a bell in my room at night, but he never rang it."</p>

  <p>"Then, practically, the housemaid did everything for him?"</p>

  <p>"Not everything. Miss Norris cooked most of his meals, we all used to give
  him his medicine, I used to put out his books and keep his fountain pen
  filled, and Mrs Monkhouse kept his candle-box; supplied. That was what he was
  most particular about as he slept badly and used to read at night."</p>

  <p>"You give us the impression, Mr Wallingford," the coroner said, drily,
  "that you must have had a good deal of leisure."</p>

  <p>"Then I have given you the wrong impression. I was kept constantly on the
  go, doing jobs, paying tradesmen, shopping and running errands."</p>

  <p>"For whom?"</p>

  <p>"Everybody. Deceased, Mrs Monkhouse, Miss Norris and even Dr Dimsdale. I
  was everybody's servant."</p>

  <p>"What did you do for Mrs Monkhouse?"</p>

  <p>"I don't see what that has got to do with this inquest?"</p>

  <p>"That is not for you to decide," the coroner said, sternly. "You will be
  good enough to answer my question."</p>

  <p>Wallingford winced as if he had had his ears cuffed. In a moment, his
  insolence evaporated and I could see his hands shaking as he, evidently,
  cudgelled his brains for a reply. Suddenly he seemed to have struck an
  idea.</p>

  <p>"Shopping of various kinds," said he; "for instance, there were the
  candles for deceased. His lamp was of German make and English lamp-candles
  wouldn't fit it. So I used to have to go to a German shop at Sparrow Corner
  by the Tower, to get packets of Schneider's stearine candles. That took about
  half a day."</p>

  <p>The coroner, stolidly and without comment, wrote down the answer, but my
  experience as a counsel told me that it had been a dummy question, asked to
  distract the witness's attention and cover a more significant one that was to
  follow. For that question I waited expectantly, and when it came my surmise
  was confirmed.</p>

  <p>"And Dr Dimsdale? What did you have to do for him?"</p>

  <p>"I used to help him with his books sometimes when he hadn't got a
  dispenser. I am a pretty good accountant and he isn't."</p>

  <p>"Where does Dr Dimsdale do his bookkeeping?"</p>

  <p>"At the desk in the surgery."</p>

  <p>"And is that where you used to work?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Used Dr Dimsdale to work with you or did you do the books by
  yourself?"</p>

  <p>"I usually worked by myself."</p>

  <p>"At what time in the day used you to work there?"</p>

  <p>"In the afternoon, as a rule."</p>

  <p>"At what hours does Dr Dimsdale visit his patients?"</p>

  <p>"Most of the day. He goes out about ten and finishes about six or
  seven."</p>

  <p>"So that you would usually be alone in the surgery?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, usually."</p>

  <p>As the coroner wrote down the answer I noticed the super-intelligent
  juryman fidgeting in his seat. At length he burst out: "Is the poison
  cupboard in the surgery?"</p>

  <p>The coroner looked interrogatively at Wallingford, who stared at him
  blankly in sudden confusion.</p>

  <p>"You heard the question? Is the poison cupboard there?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. It may be. It wasn't any business of mine."</p>

  <p>"Is there any cupboard in the surgery? You must know that."</p>

  <p>"Yes, there is a cupboard there, but I don't know what is in it."</p>

  <p>"Did you never see it open?"</p>

  <p>"No. Never."</p>

  <p>"And you never had the curiosity to look into it?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I didn't. Besides I couldn't. It was locked."</p>

  <p>"Was it always locked when you were there?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, always."</p>

  <p>"Are you certain of that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, perfectly certain."</p>

  <p>Here the super-intelligent juror looked as if he were about to spring
  across the table as he demanded eagerly: "How does the witness know that that
  cupboard was locked?"</p>

  <p>The coroner looked slightly annoyed. He had been playing his fish
  carefully and was in no wise helped by this rude jerk of the line.
  Nevertheless, he laid down his pen and looked expectantly at the witness. As
  for Wallingford, he was struck speechless. Apparently his rather muddled
  brain had suddenly taken in the import of the question, for he stood with
  dropped jaw and damp, pallid face, staring at the juryman in utter
  consternation.</p>

  <p>"Well," said the coroner, after an interval, "how did you know that it was
  locked?"</p>

  <p>Wallingford pulled himself together by an effort and replied: "Why, I
  knew&mdash;I knew, of course, that it must be locked."</p>

  <p>"Yes; but the question is, how did you know?"</p>

  <p>"Why it stands to reason that it must have been locked."</p>

  <p>"Why does it stand to reason? Cupboards are not always locked."</p>

  <p>"Poison cupboards are. Besides, you heard Dimsdale say that he always kept
  this cupboard locked. He showed you the key."</p>

  <p>Once more the coroner, having noted the answer, laid down his pen and
  looked steadily at the witness.</p>

  <p>"Now, Mr Wallingford," said he, "I must caution you to be careful as to
  what you say. This is a serious matter, and you are giving evidence on oath.
  You said just now that you did not know whether the poison cupboard was or
  was not in the surgery. You said that you did not know what was in that
  cupboard. Now you say that you knew the cupboard must have been locked
  because it was the poison cupboard. Then it seems that you did know that it
  was the poison cupboard. Isn't that so?"</p>

  <p>"No. I didn't know then. I do now because I heard Dimsdale say that it
  was."</p>

  <p>"Then, you said that you were perfectly certain that the cupboard was
  always locked whenever you were working there. That meant that you knew
  positively, as a fact, that it was locked. Now you say that you knew that it
  must be locked. But that is an assumption, an opinion, a belief. Now, a man
  of your education must know the difference between a mere belief and actual
  knowledge. Will you, please, answer definitely: Did you, or did you not, know
  as a fact whether that cupboard was or was not locked?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I didn't actually know, but I took it for granted that it was
  locked."</p>

  <p>"You did not try the door?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not. Why should I?"</p>

  <p>"Very well. Does any gentleman of the jury wish to ask any further
  questions about this cupboard?"</p>

  <p>There was a brief silence. Then the foreman said: "We should like the
  witness to say what he means and not keep contradicting himself."</p>

  <p>"You hear that, Sir," said the coroner. "Please be more careful in your
  answers in future. Now, I want to ask you about that last bottle of medicine.
  Did you notice anything unusual in its appearance?"</p>

  <p>"No. I didn't notice it at all. I didn't know that it had come."</p>

  <p>"Did you go into deceased's room on that day&mdash;the Wednesday?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I went to see deceased in the morning about ten o'clock and gave him
  a dose of his medicine; and I looked in on him in the evening about nine
  o'clock to see if he wanted anything, but he didn't."</p>

  <p>"Did you give him any medicine then?"</p>

  <p>"No. It was not due for another hour."</p>

  <p>"What was his condition then?"</p>

  <p>"He looked about the same as usual. He seemed inclined to doze, so I did
  not stay long."</p>

  <p>"Is that the last time you saw him alive?"</p>

  <p>"No. I looked in again just before eleven. He was then in much the same
  state&mdash;rather drowsy&mdash;and, at his request, I turned out the gas and
  left him."</p>

  <p>"Did you light the candle?"</p>

  <p>"No, he always did that himself, if he wanted it."</p>

  <p>"Did you give him any medicine?"</p>

  <p>"No. He had just had a dose."</p>

  <p>"Did he tell you that he had?"</p>

  <p>"No. I could see that there was a dose gone."</p>

  <p>"From which bottle was that?"</p>

  <p>"There was only one bottle there. It must have been the new bottle, as
  only one dose had been taken."</p>

  <p>"What colour was the medicine?"</p>

  <p>Wallingford hesitated a moment or two as if suspecting a trap. Then he
  replied, doggedly: "I don't know. I told you I didn't notice it."</p>

  <p>"You said that you didn't notice it at all and didn't know that it had
  come. Now you say that you observed that only one dose had been taken from it
  and that you inferred that it was the new bottle. Which of those statements
  is the true one?"</p>

  <p>"They are both true," Wallingford protested in a whining tone. "I meant
  that I didn't notice the medicine particularly and that I didn't know when it
  came."</p>

  <p>"That is not what you said," the coroner rejoined. "However, we will let
  that pass. Is there anything more that you wish to ask this witness,
  gentlemen? If not, we will release him and take the evidence of Mr
  Mayfield."</p>

  <p>I think the jury would have liked to bait Wallingford but apparently could
  not think of any suitable questions. But they watched him malevolently as he
  added his&mdash;probably quite illegible&mdash;signature to his depositions
  and followed him with their eyes as he tottered shakily back to his seat.
  Immediately afterwards my name was called and I took my place at the table,
  not without a slight degree of nervousness; for, though I was well enough
  used to examinations, it was in the capacity of examiner, not of witness, and
  I was fully alive to the possibility of certain pitfalls which the coroner
  might, if he were wide enough awake, dig for me. However, when I had been
  sworn and had given my particulars (Rupert Mayfield, 35, Barrister-at-Law, of
  No. 64 Fig Tree Court, Inner Temple) the coroner's conciliatory manner led me
  to hope that it would be all plain sailing.</p>

  <p>"How long have you known deceased?" was the first question.</p>

  <p>"About two and a half years," I replied.</p>

  <p>"You are one of the executors of his will, Mrs Monkhouse has told us."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Do you know why you were appointed executor after so short an
  acquaintance?"</p>

  <p>"I am an old friend of Mrs Monkhouse. I have known her since she was a
  little girl. I was a friend of her father&mdash;or rather, her
  stepfather."</p>

  <p>"Was it by her wish that you were made executor?"</p>

  <p>"I believe that the suggestion came from the deceased's family solicitor,
  Mr Brodribb, who is my co-executor. But probably he was influenced by my long
  acquaintance with Mrs Monkhouse."</p>

  <p>"Has probate been applied for?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Then there can be no objections to your disclosing the provisions of the
  will. We don't want to hear them in detail, but I will ask you to give us a
  general idea of the disposal of deceased's property."</p>

  <p>"The gross value of the estate is about fifty-five thousand pounds, of
  which twelve thousand represents real property and forty-three thousand
  personal. The principal beneficiaries are: Mrs Monkhouse, who receives a
  house valued at four thousand pounds and twenty thousand pounds in money and
  securities; the Reverend Amos Monkhouse, land of the value of five thousand
  and ten thousand invested money; Madeline Norris, a house and land valued at
  three thousand and five thousand in securities; Anthony Wallingford, four
  thousand pounds. Then there are legacies of a thousand pounds each to the two
  executors, and of three hundred, two hundred and one hundred respectively to
  the housemaid, the cook and the kitchen-maid. That accounts for the bulk of
  the estate. Mrs Monkhouse is the residuary legatee."</p>

  <p>The coroner wrote down the answer as I gave it and then read it out slowly
  for me to confirm, working out, at the same time, a little sum on a spare
  piece of paper&mdash;as did also the intellectual juryman.</p>

  <p>"I think that gives us all the information we want," the former remarked,
  glancing at the jury; and as none of them made any comment, he proceeded:
  "Did you see much of deceased during the last few months?"</p>

  <p>"I saw him usually once or twice a week. Sometimes oftener. But I did not
  spend much time with him. He was a solitary, bookish man who preferred to be
  alone most of his time."</p>

  <p>"Did you take particular notice of his state of health?"</p>

  <p>"No, but I did observe that his health seemed to grow rather worse
  lately."</p>

  <p>"Did it appear to you that he received such care and attention as a man in
  his condition ought to have received?"</p>

  <p>"It did not appear to me that he was neglected."</p>

  <p>"Did you realize how seriously ill he was?"</p>

  <p>"No. I am afraid not. I regarded him merely as a chronic invalid."</p>

  <p>"It never occurred to you that he ought to have had a regular nurse?"</p>

  <p>"No, and I do not think he would have consented. He greatly disliked
  having anyone about his room."</p>

  <p>"Is there anything within your knowledge that would throw any light on the
  circumstances of his death?"</p>

  <p>"No. Nothing."</p>

  <p>"Have you ever known arsenic in any form to be used in that household for
  any purpose; any fly-papers, weed-killer or insecticides, for instance?"</p>

  <p>"No, I do not remember ever having seen anything used in that household
  which, to my knowledge or belief, contained arsenic."</p>

  <p>"Do you know of any fact or circumstance which, in your opinion, ought to
  be communicated to this Court or which might help the jury in arriving at
  their verdict?"</p>

  <p>"No, I do not."</p>

  <p>This brought my examination to an end. I was succeeded by the cook and the
  kitchenmaid, but, as they had little to tell, and that little entirely
  negative, their examination was quite brief. When the last witness was
  dismissed, the coroner addressed the jury.</p>

  <p>"We have now, gentlemen," said he, "heard all the evidence that is at
  present available, and we have the choice of two courses; which are, either
  to adjourn the inquiry until further evidence is available, or to find a
  verdict on the evidence which we have heard. I incline strongly to the latter
  plan. We are now in a position to answer the questions, how, when and where
  the deceased came by his death, and when we have done that, we shall have
  discharged our proper function. What is your feeling on the matter,
  gentlemen?"</p>

  <p>The jury's feeling was very obviously that they wished to get the inquiry
  over and go about their business, and when they had made this clear, the
  coroner proceeded to sum up.</p>

  <p>"I shall not detain you, gentlemen, with a long address. All that is
  necessary is for me to recapitulate the evidence very briefly and point out
  the bearing of it.</p>

  <p>"First as to the cause of death. It has been given in evidence by two
  fully qualified and expert witnesses that deceased died from the effects of
  poisoning by arsenic. That is a matter of fact which is not disputed and
  which you must accept, unless you have any reasons for rejecting their
  testimony, which I feel sure you have not. Accepting the fact of death by
  poison, the question then arises as to how the poison came to be taken by
  deceased. There are three possibilities: he may have taken it himself,
  voluntarily and knowingly; he may have taken it by accident or mischance; or
  it may have been administered to him knowingly and maliciously by some other
  person or persons. Let us consider those three possibilities.</p>

  <p>"The suggestion that deceased might have taken the poison voluntarily is
  highly improbable in three respects. First, since deceased was mostly
  bed-ridden, it would have been almost impossible for him to have obtained the
  poison. Second, there is the nature of the poison. Arsenic has often been
  used for homicidal poisoning but seldom for suicide; for an excellent reason.
  The properties of arsenic which commend it to poisoners&mdash;its complete
  freedom from taste and the indefinite symptoms that it produces&mdash;do not
  commend it to the suicide. He has no need to conceal either the
  administration or its results. His principal need is rapidity of effect. But
  arsenic is a relatively slow poison and one which usually causes great
  suffering. It is not at all suited to the suicide. Then there is the third
  objection that the mode of administration was quite unlike that of a suicide.
  For the latter usually takes his poison in one large dose, to get the
  business over; but here it was evidently given in repeated small doses over a
  period that may have been anything from a week to a year. And, finally, there
  is not a particle of evidence in favour of the supposition that deceased took
  the poison himself.</p>

  <p>"To take the second case, that of accident: the only possibility known to
  us is that of a mistake in dispensing the medicine. But the evidence of Dr
  Dimsdale and Miss Norris must have convinced you that the improbability of a
  mistake is so great as to be practically negligible. Of course, the poison
  might have found its way accidentally into the medicine or the food or both
  in some manner unknown to us. But while we admit this, we have, in fact, to
  form our decision on what is known to us, not what is conceivable but
  unknown.</p>

  <p>"When we come to the third possibility, that the poison was administered
  to deceased by some other person or persons with intent to compass his death,
  we find it supported by positive evidence. There is the bottle of medicine
  for instance. It contained a large quantity of arsenic in a soluble form. But
  two witnesses have sworn that it could not have contained, and, in fact, did
  not contain, that quantity of arsenic when it left Dr Dimsdale's surgery or
  when it was delivered at deceased's house. Moreover, Miss Norris has sworn
  that she examined this bottle of medicine at six o'clock in the evening and
  that it did not then contain more than a small quantity&mdash;less than a
  drachm&mdash;of Liquor Arsenicalis. She was perfectly positive. She spoke
  with expert knowledge. She gave her reasons, and they were sound reasons. So
  that the evidence in our possession is to the effect that at six o'clock in
  the afternoon, that bottle of medicine did not contain more than a
  drachm&mdash;about a teaspoonful&mdash;of Liquor Arsenicalis; whereas at
  half-past ten, when a dose from the bottle was given to deceased by the
  housemaid, it contained some three ounces&mdash;about six tablespoonfuls.
  This is proved by the discovery of the poison in the stomach of deceased and
  by the exact analysis of the contents of the bottle. It follows that, between
  six o'clock and half-past ten, a large quantity of arsenical solution must
  have been put into the bottle. It is impossible to suppose that it could have
  got in by accident. Somebody must have put it in; and the only conceivable
  object that the person could have had in putting that poison into the bottle
  would be to cause the death of deceased.</p>

  <p>"But further; the evidence of the medical witnesses proves that arsenic
  had been taken by deceased on several previous occasions. That, in fact, he
  had been taking arsenic in relatively small doses for some time
  past&mdash;how long we do not know&mdash;and had been suffering from chronic
  arsenical poisoning. The evidence, therefore, points very strongly and
  definitely to the conclusion that some person or persons had been, for some
  unascertained time past, administering arsenic to him.</p>

  <p>"Finally, as to the identity of the person or persons who administered the
  poison, I need not point out that we have no evidence. You will have noticed
  that a number of persons benefit in a pecuniary sense by deceased's death.
  But that fact establishes no suspicion against any of them in the absence of
  positive evidence; and there is no positive evidence connecting any one of
  them with the administration of the poison. With these remarks, gentlemen, I
  leave you to consider the evidence and agree upon your decision."</p>

  <p>The jury did not take long in arriving at their verdict. After a few
  minutes' eager discussion, the foreman announced that they had come to an
  unanimous decision.</p>

  <p>"And what is the decision upon which you have agreed?" the coroner
  asked.</p>

  <p>"We find," was the reply, "that deceased died from the effects of arsenic,
  administered to him by some person or persons unknown, with the deliberate
  intention of causing his death."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the coroner; "that is, in effect, a verdict of wilful murder
  against some person or persons unknown. I agree with you entirely. No other
  verdict was possible on the evidence before us. It is unfortunate that no
  clue has happened as to the perpetrator of this abominable crime, but we may
  hope that the investigations of the police will result in the identification
  and conviction of the murderer."</p>

  <p>The conclusion of the coroner's address brought the proceedings to an end,
  and as he finished speaking, the spectators rose and began to pass out of the
  Court. I remained for a minute to speak a few words to Mr Holman and ask him
  to transcribe his report in duplicate. Then, I, too, went out to find my
  three companions squeezing into a taxicab which had drawn up opposite the
  entrance, watched with ghoulish curiosity by a quite considerable crowd. The
  presence of that crowd informed me that the horrible notoriety which I had
  foreseen had even now begun to envelop us. The special editions of the
  evening papers were already out, with, at least, the opening scenes of the
  inquest in print. Indeed, during the short drive to Hilborough Square, I saw
  more than one news-vendor dealing out papers to little knots of eager
  purchasers, and once, through the open window, a stentorian voice was borne
  in with hideous distinctness, announcing:</p>

  <p>"Sensational Inquest! Funeral stopped!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch7"
     id="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash; THE SEARCH WARRANT</h2>

  <p class="first">THE consciousness of the horrid notoriety that had already
  attached itself to us was brought home to me once more when the taxi drew up
  at the house in Hilborough Square. I stepped out first to pay the driver, and
  Barbara following, with the latch-key ready in her hand, walked swiftly to
  the door, looking neither to the right nor left, opened it and disappeared
  into the hall; while the other two, lurking in the cab until the door was
  open, then darted across the pavement, entered and disappeared also. Nor was
  their hasty retreat unjustified. Lingering doggedly and looking about me with
  a sort of resentful defiance, I found myself a focus of observation. In the
  adjoining houses, not a window appeared to be unoccupied. The usually vacant
  foot-way was populous with loiterers whose interest in me and in the
  ill-omened house was undissembled; while mucous voices, strange to those
  quiet precincts, told me that the astute news-vendors had scented and
  exploited a likely market.</p>

  <p>With ill-assumed indifference I entered the house and shut the
  door&mdash;perhaps rather noisily; and was about to enter the dining room
  when I heard hurried steps descending the stairs and paused to look up. It
  was the woman&mdash;the cook's sister, I think&mdash;who had been left to
  take care of the house while the servants were absent; and something of
  eagerness and excitement in her manner caused me to walk to the foot of the
  stairs to meet her.</p>

  <p>"Is anything amiss?" I asked in a low voice as she neared the bottom of
  the flight.</p>

  <p>She held up a warning finger, and coming close to me, whispered hoarsely:
  "There's two gentlemen upstairs. Sir, leastways they look like gentlemen, but
  they are really policemen."</p>

  <p>"What are they doing upstairs?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Just walking through the rooms and looking about. They came about a
  quarter of an hour ago, and when I let them in they said they were police
  officers and that they had come to search the premises."</p>

  <p>"Did they say anything about a warrant?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, Sir. I forgot about that. One of them showed me a paper and said
  it was a search warrant. So of course I couldn't do anything. And then they
  started going through the house with their note-books like auctioneers
  getting ready for a sale."</p>

  <p>"I will go up and see them," said I; "and meanwhile you had better let Mrs
  Monkhouse know. Where did you leave them?"</p>

  <p>"In the large back bedroom on the first floor," she replied. "I think it
  was Mr Monkhouse's."</p>

  <p>On this I began quickly to ascend the stairs, struggling to control a
  feeling of resentment which, though natural enough, I knew to be quite
  unreasonable. Making my way direct to the dead man's room, I entered and
  found two tall men standing before an open cupboard. They turned on hearing
  me enter and the elder of them drew a large wallet from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Mr Mayfield, I think, sir," said he. "I am Detective Superintendent
  Miller and this is Detective-Sergeant Cope. Here is my card and this is the
  search warrant, if you wish to see it."</p>

  <p>I glanced at the document and returning it to him asked:</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't it have been more in order if you had waited to show the warrant
  to Mrs Monkhouse before beginning your search?"</p>

  <p>"That is what we have done," he replied, suavely. "We have disturbed
  nothing yet. We have just been making a preliminary inspection. Of course,"
  he continued, "I understand how unpleasant this search is for Mrs Monkhouse
  and the rest of your friends, but you, Sir, as a lawyer will realize the
  position. That poor gentleman was poisoned with arsenic in this house.
  Somebody in this house had arsenic in his or her possession and we have got
  to see if any traces of it are left. After all, you know, Sir, we are acting
  in the interests of everybody but the murderer."</p>

  <p>This was so obviously true that it left me nothing to say. Nor was there
  any opportunity, for, as the superintendent concluded, Barbara entered the
  room. I looked at her a little anxiously as I briefly explained the
  situation. But there was no occasion. Pale and sombre of face, she was
  nevertheless perfectly calm and self-possessed and greeted the two officers
  without a trace of resentment; indeed, when the superintendent was disposed
  to be apologetic, she cut him short by exclaiming energetically: "But,
  surely, who should be more anxious to assist you than I? It is true that I
  find it incredible that this horrible crime could have been perpetrated by
  any member of my household. But it was perpetrated by somebody. And if,
  either here or elsewhere, I can help you in any way to drag that wretch out
  into the light of day, I am at your service, no matter who the criminal may
  be. Do you wish anyone to attend you in your search?"</p>

  <p>"I think, Madam, it would be well if you were present, and perhaps Mr
  Mayfield. If we want any of the others, we can send for them. Where are they
  now?"</p>

  <p>"Miss Norris and Mr Wallingford are in the dining room. The servants have
  just come in and I think have gone to the kitchen or their sitting room."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Miller, "we had better begin with the dining room."</p>

  <p>We went down the stairs, preceded by Barbara, who opened the dining room
  door and introduced the visitors to the two inmates in tones as quiet and
  matter-of-fact as if she were announcing the arrival of the gas-fitter or the
  upholsterer. I was sorry that the other two had not been warned, for the
  announcement took them both by surprise and they were in no condition for
  surprises of this rather alarming kind. At the word "search," Madeline
  started up with a smothered exclamation and then sat down again, trembling
  and pale as death; while as for Wallingford, if the two officers had come to
  pinion him and lead him forth to the gallows, he could not have looked more
  appalled.</p>

  <p>Our visitors were scrupulously polite, but they were also keenly observant
  and I could see that each had made a mental note of the effect of their
  arrival. But, of course, they made no outward sign of interest in any of us
  but proceeded stolidly with their business; and I noticed that, before
  proceeding to a detailed inspection, they opened their note-books and glanced
  through what was probably a rough inventory, to see that nothing had been
  moved in the interval since their preliminary inspection.</p>

  <p>The examination of the dining room was, however, rather perfunctory. It
  contained nothing that appeared to interest them, and after going through the
  contents of the sideboard cupboards methodically, the superintendent turned a
  leaf of his note-book and said: "I think that will do, Madam. Perhaps we had
  better take the library next. Who keeps the keys of the bureau and the
  cupboard?"</p>

  <p>"Mr Wallingford has charge of the library," replied Barbara. "Will you
  give the superintendent your keys, Tony?"</p>

  <p>"There's no need for that," said Miller. "If Mr Wallingford will come with
  us, he can unlock the drawers and cupboard and tell us anything that we want
  to know about the contents."</p>

  <p>Wallingford rose with a certain alacrity and followed us into the library,
  which adjoined the dining room. Here the two officers again consulted their
  note-books, and having satisfied themselves that the room was as they had
  left it, began a detailed survey, watched closely and with evident anxiety by
  Wallingford. They began with a cupboard, or small armoire, which formed the
  upper member of a large, old-fashioned bureau. Complying with Miller's polite
  request that it might be unlocked, Wallingford produced a bunch of keys, and,
  selecting from it, after much nervous fumbling, a small key, endeavoured to
  insert it into the keyhole; but his hand was in such a palsied condition that
  he was unable to introduce it.</p>

  <p>"Shall I have a try, Sir?" the superintendent suggested, patiently, adding
  with a smile, "I don't smoke quite so many cigarettes as you seem to."</p>

  <p>His efforts, however, also failed, for the evident reason that it was the
  wrong key. Thereupon he looked quickly through the bunch, picked out another
  key and had the cupboard open in a twinkling, revealing a set of shelves
  crammed with a disorderly litter of cardboard boxes, empty ink-bottles,
  bundles of letters and papers and the miscellaneous rubbish that accumulates
  in the receptacles of a thoroughly untidy man. The superintendent went
  through the collection methodically, emptying the shelves, one at a time, on
  to the flap of the bureau, where he and the sergeant sorted the various
  articles and examining each, returned it to the shelf. It was a tedious
  proceeding and, so far as I could judge, unproductive, for, when all the
  shelves had been looked through and every article separately inspected,
  nothing was brought to light save an empty foolscap envelope which had
  apparently once contained a small box and was addressed to Wallingford, and
  two pieces of what looked like chemist's wrapping-paper, the creases in which
  showed that they had been small packets. These were not returned to the
  shelves, but, without comment, enclosed in a large envelope on which the
  superintendent scribbled a few words with a pencil and which was then
  consigned to a large handbag that the sergeant had brought in with him from
  the hall.</p>

  <p>The large drawers of the bureau were next examined. Like the shelves, they
  were filled with a horrible accumulation of odds and ends which had evidently
  been stuffed into them to get them out of the way. From this collection
  nothing was obtained which interested the officers, who next turned their
  attention to the small drawers and pigeonholes at the back of the flap.
  These, however, contained nothing but stationery and a number of letters,
  bills and other papers, which the two officers glanced through and replaced.
  When all the small drawers and pigeonholes had been examined, the
  superintendent stood up, fixing a thoughtful glance at the middle of the
  range of drawers; and I waited expectantly for the next development. Like
  many old bureaus, this one had as a central feature a nest of four very small
  drawers enclosed by a door. I knew the arrangement very well, and so,
  apparently, did the superintendent; for, once more opening the top drawer, he
  pulled it right out and laid it on the writing flap. Then, producing from his
  pocket a folding foot-rule, he thrust it into one of the pigeonholes, showing
  a depth of eight and a half inches, and then into the case of the little
  drawer, which proved to be only a fraction over five inches deep.</p>

  <p>"There is something more here than meets the eye," he remarked pleasantly.
  "Do you know what is at the back of those drawers, Mr Wallingford?"</p>

  <p>The unfortunate secretary, who had been watching the officer's proceedings
  with a look of consternation, did not reply for a few moments, but remained
  staring wildly at the aperture from which the drawer had been taken out.</p>

  <p>"At the back?" he stammered, at length. "No, I can't say that I do. It
  isn't my bureau, you know. I only had the use of it."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Miller. "Well, I expect we can soon find out."</p>

  <p>He drew out a second drawer and, grasping the partition between the two,
  gave a gentle pull, when the whole nest slid easily forward and came right
  out of its case. Miller laid it on the writing flap, and, turning it round,
  displayed a sliding lid at the back, which he drew up; when there came into
  view a set of four little drawers similar to those in front but furnished
  with leather tabs instead of handles. Miller drew out the top drawer and a
  sudden change in the expression on his face told me that he had lighted on
  something that seemed to him significant.</p>

  <p>"Now I wonder what this is?" said he, taking from the drawer a small
  white-paper packet. "Feels like some sort of powder. You say you don't know
  anything about it, Mr Wallingford?"</p>

  <p>Wallingford shook his head but made no further reply, whereupon the
  superintendent laid the packet on the flap and very carefully unfolded the
  ends&mdash;it had already been opened&mdash;when it was seen that the
  contents consisted of some two or three teaspoonfuls of a fine, white
  powder.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Miller, "we shall have to find out what it is. Will you pass
  me that bit of sealing-wax, Sergeant?"</p>

  <p>He reclosed the packet with the greatest care and having sealed both the
  ends with his signet-ring, enclosed it in an envelope and put it into his
  inside breast pocket. Then he returned to the little nest of drawers. The
  second drawer was empty, but on pulling out the third, he uttered an
  exclamation.</p>

  <p>"Well, now! Look at that! Somebody seems to have been fond of physic. And
  there's no doubt as to what this is. Morphine hydrochlor, a quarter of a
  grain."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he took out of the drawer a little bottle filled with tiny
  white discs or tablets and bearing on the label the inscription which the
  superintendent had read out. Wallingford gazed at it with a foolish
  expression of surprise as Miller held it up for our&mdash;and particularly
  Wallingford's&mdash;inspection; and Barbara, I noticed, cast at the latter a
  side-long, inscrutable glance which I sought in vain to interpret.</p>

  <p>"Morphine doesn't seem much to the point," Miller remarked as he wrapped
  the little bottle in paper and bestowed it in his inner pocket, "but, of
  course, we have only got the evidence of the label. It may turn out to be
  something else, when the chemical gentlemen come to test it."</p>

  <p>With this he grasped the tab of the bottom drawer and drew the latter out;
  and in a moment his face hardened. Very deliberately, he picked out a small,
  oblong envelope, which appeared once to have contained a box or hard packet,
  but was now empty. It had evidently come through the post and was addressed
  in a legible business hand to "A Wallingford Esq., 16 Hilborough Square."
  Silently the superintendent held it out for us all to see, as he fixed a
  stern look on Wallingford. "You observe, Sir," he said, at length, "that the
  post-mark is dated the 20th of August; only about a month ago. What have you
  to say about it?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," was the sullen reply. "What comes to me by post is my affair. I
  am not accountable to you or anybody else."</p>

  <p>For a moment, the superintendent's face took on a very ugly expression.
  But he seemed to be a wise man and not unkindly, for he quickly controlled
  his irritation and rejoined without a trace of anger, though gravely enough:
  "Be advised by me, Mr Wallingford, and don't make trouble for yourself. Let
  me remind you what the position is. In this house a man has died from arsenic
  poisoning. The police will have to find out how that happened and if anyone
  is open to the suspicion of having poisoned him. I have come here today for
  that purpose with full authority to search this house. In the course of my
  search I have asked you for certain information, and you have made a number
  of false statements. Believe me, sir, that is a very dangerous thing to do.
  It inevitably raises the question why those false statements should have been
  made. Now, I am going to ask you one or two questions. You are not bound to
  answer them, but you will be well advised to hold nothing back, and, above
  all, to say nothing that is not true. To begin with that packet of powder.
  What do you say that packet contains?"</p>

  <p>Wallingford, who characteristically, was now completely cowed by the
  superintendent's thinly-veiled threats, hung his head for a moment and then
  replied, almost inaudibly, "Cocaine."</p>

  <p>"What were you going to do with cocaine?" Miller asked.</p>

  <p>"I was going to take a little of it for my health."</p>

  <p>The superintendent smiled faintly as he demanded: "And the morphine
  tablets?"</p>

  <p>"I had thought of taking one of them occasionally to&mdash;er&mdash;to
  steady my nerves."</p>

  <p>Miller nodded, and casting a swift glance at the sergeant, asked:</p>

  <p>"And the packet that was in this envelope: what did that contain?"</p>

  <p>Wallingford hesitated and was so obviously searching for a plausible lie
  that Miller interposed, persuasively: "Better tell the truth and not make
  trouble"; whereupon Wallingford replied in a barely audible mumble that the
  packet had contained a very small quantity of cocaine.</p>

  <p>"What has become of that cocaine?" the superintendent asked.</p>

  <p>"I took part of it; the rest got spilt and lost."</p>

  <p>Miller nodded rather dubiously at this reply and then asked:</p>

  <p>"Where did you get this cocaine and the morphine?"</p>

  <p>Wallingford hesitated for some time and at length, plucking up a little
  courage again, replied: "I would rather not answer that question. It really
  has nothing to do with your search. You are looking for arsenic."</p>

  <p>Miller reflected for a few moments and then rejoined, quietly:</p>

  <p>"That isn't quite correct, Mr Wallingford. I am looking for anything that
  may throw light on the death of Mr Monkhouse. But I don't want to press you
  unduly, only I would point out that you could not have come by these drugs
  lawfully. You are not a doctor or a chemist. Whoever supplied you with them
  was acting illegally and you have been a party to an illegal transaction in
  obtaining them. However, if you refuse to disclose the names of the persons
  who supplied them, we will let the matter pass, at least for the present; but
  I remind you that you have had these drugs in your possession and that you
  may be, and probably will be compelled to give an account of the way in which
  you obtained them."</p>

  <p>With that he pocketed the envelope, closed the drawers and turned to make
  a survey of the room. There was very little in it, however, for the bureau
  and its surmounting cupboard were the only receptacles in which anything
  could be concealed, the whole of the walls being occupied by open
  book-shelves about seven feet high. But even these the superintendent was not
  prepared to take at their face value. First, he stood on a chair and ran his
  eye slowly along the tops of all the shelves; then he made a leisurely tour
  of the room, closely inspecting each row of books, now and again taking one
  out or pushing one in against the back of the shelves. A set of box-files was
  examined in detail, each one being opened to ascertain that it contained
  nothing but papers, and even one or two obvious portfolios were taken out and
  inspected. Nothing noteworthy, however, was brought to light by this rigorous
  search until the tour of inspection was nearly completed. The superintendent
  was, in fact, approaching the door when his attention was attracted by a row
  of books which seemed to be unduly near the front edge of the shelf. Opposite
  this he halted and began pushing the books back, one at a time. Suddenly I
  noticed that one of the books, on being pushed, slid back about half an inch
  and stopped as if there were something behind it. And there was. When the
  superintendent grasped the book and drew it out, there came into view,
  standing against the back of the shelf, a smallish bottle, apparently empty,
  and bearing a white label.</p>

  <p>"Queer place to keep a bottle," Miller remarked, adding, with a smile,
  "unless it were a whiskey bottle, which it isn't." He drew it out, and after
  looking at it suspiciously and holding it up to the light, took out the cork
  and sniffed at it. "Well," he continued, "it is an empty bottle and it is
  labelled 'Benzine.' Do you know anything about it, Mr Wallingford?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't," was the reply. "I don't use benzine, and if I did I should
  not keep it on a book-shelf. But I don't see that it matters much. There
  isn't any harm in benzine, is there?"</p>

  <p>"Probably not," said Miller; "but, you see, the label doesn't agree with
  the smell. What do you say, Mrs Monkhouse?"</p>

  <p>He once more drew out the cork and held the bottle towards her. She took
  it from him and having smelled at it, replied promptly: "It smells to me like
  lavender. Possibly the bottle has had lavender water in it, though I
  shouldn't, myself, have chosen a benzine bottle to keep a perfume in."</p>

  <p>"I don't think it was lavender water," said the superintendent. "That, I
  think, is nearly colourless. But the liquid that was in this bottle was red.
  As I hold it up to the light, you can see a little ring of red round the edge
  of the bottom. I daresay the chemists will be able to tell us what was in the
  bottle, but the question now is, who put it there? You are sure you can't
  tell us anything about it, Mr Wallingford?"</p>

  <p>"I have never seen it before, I assure you," the latter protested almost
  tearfully. "I know nothing about it, whatsoever. That is the truth,
  Superintendent; I swear to God it is."</p>

  <p>"Very well, sir," said Miller, writing a brief note on the label and
  making an entry in his note-book. "Perhaps it is of no importance after all.
  But we shall see. I think we have finished this room. Perhaps, Sergeant, you
  might take a look at the drawing room while I go through Mr Monkhouse's room.
  It will save time. And I needn't trouble you anymore just at present, Mr
  Wallingford."</p>

  <p>The secretary retired, somewhat reluctantly, to the dining room while
  Barbara led the way to the first floor. As we entered the room in which that
  unwitnessed tragedy had been enacted in the dead of the night, I looked about
  me with a sort of shuddering interest. The bed had been stripped, but
  otherwise nothing seemed to be changed since I had seen the room but a few
  days ago when it was still occupied by its dread tenant. The bedside table
  still bore its pathetic furnishings: the water-bottle, the little decanter,
  the books, the candle-box, the burnt-out lamp, the watch&mdash;though that
  ticked no longer, but seemed, with its motionless hands, to echo the awesome
  stillness that pervaded that ill-omened room.</p>

  <p>As the superintendent carried out his methodical search, joined presently
  by the sergeant, Barbara came and stood by me with her eyes fixed gloomily on
  the table.</p>

  <p>"Were you thinking of him, Rupert?" she whispered. "Were you thinking of
  that awful night when he lay here, dying, all alone, and&mdash;Oh! the
  thought of it will haunt me every day of my life until my time comes, too,
  however far off that may be."</p>

  <p>I was about to make some reply, as consolatory as might be, when the
  superintendent announced that he had finished and asked that Wallingford
  might be sent for to be present at the examination of his room. I went down
  to deliver the message, and, as it would have appeared intrusive for me to
  accompany him, I stayed in the dining room with Madeline, who, though she had
  recovered from the shock of the detectives' arrival, was still pale and
  agitated.</p>

  <p>"Poor Tony seemed dreadfully upset when he came back just now." she said.
  "What was it that happened in the library?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing very much," I answered. "The superintendent unearthed his little
  stock of dope; which, of course, was unpleasant for him, but it would not
  have mattered if he had not been fool enough to lie about it. That was a
  fatal thing to do, under the circumstances."</p>

  <p>As Wallingford seemed not to have said anything about the bottle, I made
  no reference to it, but endeavoured to distract her attention from what was
  going on in the house by talking of other matters. Nor was it at all
  difficult; for the truth is that we all, with one accord, avoided any
  reference to the horrible fact which was staring us in the face, and of which
  we must all have been fully conscious. So we continued a somewhat banal
  conversation, punctuated by pauses in which our thoughts stole secretly back
  to the hideous realities, until, at length, Wallingford returned, pale and
  scowling, and flung himself into an arm-chair. Madeline looked at him
  inquiringly, but as he offered no remark but sat in gloomy silence, smoking
  furiously, she asked him no questions, nor did I.</p>

  <p>A minute or two later, Barbara came into the room, quietly and with an air
  of calm self-possession that was quite soothing in the midst of the general
  emotional tension.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind coming up, Madeline?" she said. "They are examining your room
  and they want you to unlock the cupboard. You have your keys about you, I
  suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Madeline replied, rising and taking from her pocket a little
  key-wallet. "That is the key. Will you take it up to them?"</p>

  <p>"I think you had better come up yourself," Barbara replied. "It is very
  unpleasant but, of course, they have to go through the formalities, and we
  must not appear unwilling to help them."</p>

  <p>"No, of course," said Madeline. "Then I will come with you, but I should
  like Rupert to come, too, if he doesn't mind. Will you?" she asked, looking
  at me appealingly. "Those policemen make me feel so nervous."</p>

  <p>Of course, I assented at once; and as Wallingford, muttering "Damned
  impertinence! Infernal indignity!" rose to open the door for us, we passed
  out and took our way upstairs.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to trouble you, Miss Norris," said Miller, in a suave tone, as
  we entered, "but we must see everything if only to be able to say that we
  have. Would you be so kind as to unlock this cupboard?"</p>

  <p>He indicated a narrow cupboard which occupied one of the recesses by the
  chimney-breast, and Madeline at once inserted the key and threw open the
  door. The interior was then seen to be occupied by shelves, of which the
  lower ones were filled, tidily enough, with an assortment of miscellaneous
  articles&mdash;shoes, shoe-trees, brushes, leather bags, cardboard boxes,
  note-books and other "oddments"&mdash;while the top shelf seemed to have been
  used as a repository for jars, pots and bottles, of which several appeared to
  be empty. It was this shelf which seemed to attract the superintendent's
  attention and he began operations by handing out its various contents to the
  sergeant, who set them down on a table in orderly rows. When they were all
  set out and the superintendent had inspected narrowly and swept his hand over
  the empty shelf, the examination of the jars and bottles began.</p>

  <p>The procedure was very methodical and thorough. First, the sergeant picked
  up a bottle or jar, looked it over carefully, read the label if there was
  one, uncovered or uncorked it, smelled it and passed it to the
  superintendent, who, when he had made a similar inspection, put it down at
  the opposite end of the table.</p>

  <p>"Can you tell us what this is?" Miller asked, holding out a bottle filled
  with a thickish, nearly black liquid.</p>

  <p>"That is caramel," Madeline replied. "I use it in my cookery classes and
  for cooking at home, too."</p>

  <p>The superintendent regarded the bottle a little dubiously but set it down
  at the end of the table without comment. Presently he received from the
  sergeant a glass jar filled with a brownish powder.</p>

  <p>"There is no label on this," he remarked, exhibiting it to Madeline.</p>

  <p>"No," she replied. "It is turmeric. That also is used in my classes; and
  that other is powdered saffron."</p>

  <p>"I wonder you don't label them," said Miller. "It would be easy for a
  mistake to occur with all these unlabelled bottles."</p>

  <p>"Yes," she admitted, "they ought to be labelled. But I know what each of
  them is, and they are all pretty harmless. Most of them are materials that
  are used in cookery demonstrations, but that one that you have now is French
  chalk, and the one the sergeant has is pumice-powder."</p>

  <p>"H'm," grunted Miller, dipping his finger into the former and rubbing it
  on his thumb; "what would happen if you thickened a soup with French chalk or
  pumice-powder? Not very good for the digestion, I should think."</p>

  <p>"No, I suppose not," Madeline agreed, with the ghost of a smile on her
  pale face. "I must label them in future."</p>

  <p>During this colloquy I had been rapidly casting my eye over the collection
  that still awaited examination, and my attention had been almost at once
  arrested by an empty bottle near the end of the row. It looked to me like the
  exact counterpart of the bottle which had been found in the library; a
  cylindrical bottle of about the capacity of half a pint, or rather less, and
  like the other, labelled in printed characters 'Benzine.'</p>

  <p>But mine was not the only eye that had observed it. Presently, I saw the
  sergeant pick it up&mdash;out of its turn&mdash;scrutinize it
  suspiciously,&mdash;hold it up to the light, take out the cork and smell both
  it and the bottle, and then, directing the latter, telescope-fashion, towards
  the window, inspect the bottom by peering in through the mouth. Finally, he
  clapped in the cork with some emphasis, and with a glance full of meaning
  handed the bottle to the superintendent.</p>

  <p>The latter repeated the procedure in even more detail. When he had
  finished, he turned to Madeline with a distinctly inquisitorial air.</p>

  <p>"This bottle, Miss Norris," said he, "is labelled 'Benzine.' But it was
  not benzine that it contained. Will you kindly smell it and tell me what you
  think it did contain. Or perhaps you can say off-hand."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I can't," she replied. "I have no recollection of having had
  any benzine and I don't remember this bottle at all. As it is in my cupboard
  I suppose I must have put it there, but I don't remember having ever seen it
  before. I can't tell you anything about it."</p>

  <p>"Well, will you kindly smell it and tell me what you think it contained?"
  the superintendent persisted, handing her the open bottle. She took it from
  him apprehensively, and, holding it to her nose, took a deep sniff; and
  instantly her already pale face became dead white to the very lips.</p>

  <p>"It smells of lavender," she said in a faint voice.</p>

  <p>"So I thought," said Miller. "And now, Miss Norris, if you will look in at
  the mouth of the bottle against the light, you will see a faint red ring
  round the bottom. Apparently, the liquid that the bottle contained was a red
  liquid. Moreover, if you hold the bottle against the light and look through
  the label, you can see the remains of another label under it. There is only a
  tiny scrap of it left, but it is enough for us to see that it was a red
  label. So it would seem that the liquid was a poisonous
  liquid&mdash;poisonous enough to require a red poison label. And then you
  notice that this red poison label seems to have been scraped off and the
  benzine label stuck on over the place where it had been, although, as the
  lavender smell and the red stain clearly show, the bottle never had any
  benzine in it at all. Now, Miss Norris, bearing those facts in mind, I ask
  you if you can tell me what was in that bottle."</p>

  <p>"I have told you," Madeline replied with unexpected firmness, "that I know
  nothing about this bottle. I have no recollection of ever having seen it
  before. I do not believe that it ever belonged to me. It may have been in the
  cupboard when I first began to use it. At any rate, I am not able to tell you
  anything about it."</p>

  <p>The superintendent continued to look at her keenly, still holding the
  bottle. After a few moments' silence he persisted: "A red, poisonous liquid
  which smells of lavender. Can you not form any idea as to what it was?"</p>

  <p>I was about to enter a protest&mdash;for the question was really not
  admissible&mdash;when Madeline, now thoroughly angry and quite
  self-possessed, replied, stiffly: "I don't know what you mean. I have told
  you that I know nothing about this bottle. Are you suggesting that I should
  try to guess what it contained?"</p>

  <p>"No," he rejoined hastily; "certainly not. A guess wouldn't help us at
  all. If you really do not know anything about the bottle, we must leave it at
  that. You always keep this cupboard locked, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Usually. But I am not very particular about it. There is nothing of value
  in the cupboard, as you see, and the servants are quite trustworthy. I
  sometimes leave the key in the door, but I don't imagine that anybody ever
  meddles with it."</p>

  <p>The superintendent took the key out of the lock and regarded it
  attentively. Then he examined the lock itself, and I also took the
  opportunity of inspecting it. Both the lock and the key were of the simplest
  kind, just ordinary builder's fittings, which, so far as any real security
  was concerned, could not be taken seriously. In the absence of the key, a
  stiff wire or a bent hair-pin would probably have shot that little bolt quite
  easily, as I took occasion to remark to the superintendent, who frankly
  agreed with me.</p>

  <p>The bottle having been carefully wrapped up and deposited in the
  sergeant's hand-bag, the examination was resumed; but nothing further of an
  interesting or suspicious character was discovered among the bottles or jars.
  Nor did the sorting-out of the miscellaneous contents of the lower shelves
  yield anything remarkable with a single exception. When the objects on the
  lowest shelf had been all taken out, a small piece of white paper was seen at
  the back, and on this Miller pounced with some eagerness. As he brought it
  out I could see that it was a chemist's powder paper, about six inches square
  (when Miller had carefully straightened it out), and the creases which marked
  the places where it had been folded showed that it had contained a mass of
  about the bulk of a dessert-spoonful. But what attracted my
  attention&mdash;and the superintendent's&mdash;was the corner of a red label
  which adhered to a torn edge in company with a larger fragment of a white
  label on which the name or description of the contents had presumably been
  written or printed. Miller held it out towards Madeline, who looked at it
  with a puzzled frown.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember what was in this paper, Miss Norris?" the former
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I don't," she replied.</p>

  <p>"H'm," grunted Miller; "I should have thought you would. It seems to have
  been a good-sized powder and it had a poison label in addition to the
  descriptive label. I should have thought that would have recalled it to your
  memory."</p>

  <p>"So should I," said Madeline. "But I don't remember having bought any
  powder that would be labelled 'poison.' It is very odd; and it is odd that
  the paper should be there. I don't usually put waste paper into my
  cupboard."</p>

  <p>"Well, there it is," said Miller, "but if you can't remember anything
  about it, we must see if the analysts can find out what was in it." With
  which he folded it and having put it into an envelope, bestowed it in his
  pocket in company with his other treasures.</p>

  <p>This was the last of the discoveries. When they had finished their
  inspection of Madeline's room the officers went on to Barbara's, which they
  examined with the same minute care as they had bestowed on the others, but
  without bringing anything of interest to light. Then they inspected the
  servants' bedrooms and finally the kitchen and the other premises
  appertaining to it, but still without result. It was a tedious affair and we
  were all relieved when, at last, it came to an end. Barbara and I escorted
  the two detectives to the street door, at which the superintendent paused to
  make a few polite acknowledgments.</p>

  <p>"I must thank you, Madam," said he, "for the help you have given us and
  for the kind and reasonable spirit in which you have accepted a disagreeable
  necessity. I assure you that we do not usually meet with so much
  consideration. A search of this kind is always an unpleasant duty to carry
  out and it is not made any more pleasant by a hostile attitude on the part of
  the persons concerned."</p>

  <p>"I can understand that," replied Barbara; "but really the thanks are due
  from me for the very courteous and considerate way in which you have
  discharged what I am sure must be a most disagreeable duty. And of course, it
  had to be; and I am glad that it has been done so thoroughly. I never
  supposed that you would find what you are seeking in this house. But it was
  necessary that the search should be made here if only to prove that you must
  look for it somewhere else."</p>

  <p>"Quite so, Madam," the superintendent returned, a little drily; "and now I
  will wish you good afternoon and hope that we shall have no further occasion
  to trouble you."</p>

  <p>As I closed the street door and turned back along the hall, the dining
  room door&mdash;apparently already ajar&mdash;opened and Madeline and
  Wallingford stepped out; and I could not help reflecting, as I noted their
  pale, anxious faces and shaken bearing, how little their appearance supported
  the confident, optimistic tone of Barbara's last remarks. But, at any rate,
  they were intensely relieved that the ordeal was over, and Wallingford even
  showed signs of returning truculence.</p>

  <p>Whatever he was going to say, however, was cut short by Barbara, who,
  passing the door and moving towards the staircase, addressed me over her
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind coming up to my den, Rupert? I want to ask your advice about
  one or two things."</p>

  <p>The request seemed a little inopportune; but it was uttered as a command
  and I had no choice but to obey. Accordingly, I followed Barbara up the
  stairs, leaving the other two in the hall, evidently rather disconcerted by
  this sudden retreat. At the turn of the stairs I looked down on the two pale
  faces. In Madeline's I seemed to read a new apprehensiveness, tinged with
  suspicion; on Wallingford's a scowl of furious anger which I had no patience
  to seek to interpret.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch8"
     id="ch8"></a>VIII. &mdash; THORNDYKE SPEAKS BLUNTLY</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN I had entered the little sitting room and shut the
  door, I turned to Barbara, awaiting with some curiosity what she had to say
  to me. But for a while she said nothing, standing before me silently, and
  looking at me with a most disquieting expression. All her calm
  self-possession had gone. I could read nothing in her face but alarm and
  dismay.</p>

  <p>"It is dreadful, Rupert!" she exclaimed, at length, in a half-whisper. "It
  is like some awful dream! What can it all mean? I don't dare to ask myself
  the question."</p>

  <p>I shook my head, for I was in precisely the same condition. I did not dare
  to weigh the meaning of the things that I had seen and heard.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the stony fixity of her face relaxed and with a little smothered
  cry she flung her arm around my neck and buried her face on my shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Forgive me, Rupert, dearest, kindest friend," she sobbed. "Suffer a poor
  lonely woman for a few moments. I have only you, dear, faithful one; only
  your strength and steadfastness to lean upon. Before the others I must needs
  be calm and brave, must cloak my own fears to support their flagging courage.
  But it is hard, Rupert; for they see what we see and dare not put it into
  words. And the mystery, Rupert, the horrible shadow that is over us all! In
  God's name, what can it all mean?"</p>

  <p>"That is what I ask myself, Barbara, and dare not answer my own
  question."</p>

  <p>She uttered a low moan and clung closer to me, sobbing quietly. I was
  deeply moved, for I realized the splendid courage that enabled her to go
  about this house of horror, calm and unafraid; to bear the burden of her
  companions' weakness as well as her own grief and humiliation. But I could
  find nothing to say to her. I could only offer her a silent sympathy, holding
  her head on my shoulder and softly stroking her hair while I wondered dimly
  what the end of it all would be.</p>

  <p>Presently she stood up, and, taking out her handkerchief, wiped her eyes
  resolutely and finally.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, dear Rupert," she said, "for being so patient with me. I felt
  that I had come to the end of my endurance and had to rest my burden on you.
  It was a great relief. But I didn't bring you up here for that. I wanted to
  consult you about what has to be done. I can't look to poor Tony in his
  present state."</p>

  <p>"What is it that has to be done?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"There is the funeral. That has still to take place."</p>

  <p>"Of course it has," I exclaimed, suddenly taken aback; for amidst all the
  turmoils and alarms, I had completely lost sight of this detail. "I suppose I
  had better call on the undertaker and make the necessary arrangements."</p>

  <p>"If you would be so kind, Rupert, and if you can spare the time. You have
  given up the whole day to us already."</p>

  <p>"I can manage," said I. "And as to the time of the funeral, I don't know
  whether it could be arranged for the evening. It gets dark pretty early."</p>

  <p>"No, Rupert," she exclaimed, firmly. "Not in the evening. Certainly not. I
  will not have poor Harold's body smuggled away in the dark like the
  dishonoured corpse of some wretched suicide. The funeral shall take place at
  the proper time, if I go with it alone."</p>

  <p>"Very well, Barbara. I will arrange for us to start at the time originally
  fixed. I only suggested the evening because&mdash;well, you know what to
  expect."</p>

  <p>"Yes, only too well! But I refuse to let a crowd of gaping sight-seers
  intimidate me into treating my dead husband with craven disrespect."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you are right," said I with secret approval of her decision,
  little as I relished the prospect that it opened. "Then I had better go and
  make the arrangements at once. It is getting late. But I am loath to leave
  you alone with Madeline and Wallingford."</p>

  <p>"I think, perhaps, we shall be better alone for the present, and you have
  your own affairs to attend to. But you must have some food before you go. You
  have had nothing since the morning, and I expect a meal is ready by now."</p>

  <p>"I don't think I will wait, Barbara," I replied. "This affair ought to be
  settled at once. I can get some food when I have dispatched the
  business."</p>

  <p>She was reluctant to let me go. But I was suddenly conscious of a longing
  to escape from this house into the world of normal things and people; to be
  alone for a while with my own thoughts, and, above all, to take counsel with
  Thorndyke. On my way out I called in at the dining room to make my adieux to
  Madeline and Wallingford. The former looked at me, as she shook my hand, very
  wistfully and I thought a little reproachfully.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry you have to go, Rupert," she said. "But you will try to come
  and see us tomorrow, won't you? And spend as much time here as you can."</p>

  <p>I promised to come at some time on the morrow; and having exchanged a few
  words with Wallingford, took my departure, escorted to the street door by the
  two women.</p>

  <p>The closing of the door, sounding softly in my ears, conveyed a sense of
  relief of which I felt ashamed. I drew a deep breath and stepped forward
  briskly with a feeling of emancipation that I condemned as selfish and
  disloyal even as I was sensible of its intensity. It was almost with a sense
  of exhilaration that I strode along, a normal, unnoticed wayfarer among
  ordinary men and women, enveloped by no cloud of mystery, overhung by no
  shadow of crime. There was the undertaker, indeed, who would drag me back
  into the gruesome environment, but I would soon have finished with him, and
  then, for a time, at least, I should be free.</p>

  <p>I finished with him, in fact, sooner than I had expected, for he had
  already arranged the procedure of the postponed funeral and required only my
  assent; and when I had given this, I went my way breathing more freely but
  increasingly conscious of the need for food.</p>

  <p>Yet, after all, my escape was only from physical contact. Try as I would
  to forget for a while the terrible events of this day of wrath, the fresh
  memories of them came creeping back in the midst of those other thoughts
  which I had generated by a deliberate effort. They haunted me as I walked
  swiftly through the streets, they made themselves heard above the rumble of
  the train, and even as I sat in a tavern in Devereux Court, devouring with
  ravenous appreciation a well-grilled chop, accompanied by a pint of claret,
  black care stood behind the old-fashioned, high-backed settle, an unseen
  companion of the friendly waiter.</p>

  <p>The lighted windows of Thorndyke's chambers were to my eyes as the harbour
  lights to the eyes of a storm-beaten mariner. As I emerged from Fig Tree
  Court and came in sight of them, I had already the feeling that the burden of
  mystery and vague suspicion was lightened; and I strode across King's Bench
  Walk with the hopeful anticipation of one who looks to shift his fardel on to
  more capable shoulders.</p>

  <p>The door was opened by Thorndyke, himself; and the sheaf of papers in his
  hand suggested that he was expecting me. "Are those the depositions?" I asked
  as we shook hands.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied. "I have just been reading through them and making an
  abstract. Holman has left the duplicate at your chambers."</p>

  <p>"I suppose the medical evidence represents the 'complications' that you
  hinted at? You expected something of the kind?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. An inquest in the face of a regular death certificate suggested some
  pretty definite information; and then your own account of the illness told
  one what to expect."</p>

  <p>"And yet," said I, "neither of the doctors suspected anything while the
  man was alive."</p>

  <p>"No; but that is not very remarkable. I had the advantage over them of
  knowing that a death certificate had been challenged. It is always easier to
  be wise after than before the event."</p>

  <p>"And now that you have read the depositions, what do you think of the
  case? Do you think, for instance, that the verdict was justified?"</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly," he replied. "What other verdict was possible on the
  evidence that was before the court? The medical witness swore that deceased
  died from the effects of arsenic poisoning. That is an inference, it is true.
  The facts are that the man died and that a poisonous quantity of arsenic was
  found in the body. But it is the only reasonable inference and we cannot
  doubt that it is the true one. Then again as to the question of murder as
  against accident or suicide, it is one of probabilities. But the
  probabilities are so overwhelmingly in favour of murder that no others are
  worth considering. No, Mayfield, on the evidence before us, we have to accept
  the verdict as expressing the obvious truth."</p>

  <p>"You think it impossible that there can be any error or fallacy in the
  case?"</p>

  <p>"I don't say that," he replied. "I am referring exclusively to the
  evidence which is set forth in these depositions. That is all the evidence
  that we possess. Apart from the depositions we have no knowledge of the case
  at all; at least I have none, and I don't suppose you have any."</p>

  <p>"I have not. But I understand that you think it at least conceivable that
  there may be, after all, some fallacy in the evidence of wilful murder?"</p>

  <p>"A fallacy," he replied, "is always conceivable. As you know, Mayfield,
  complete certainty, in the most rigorous sense, is hardly ever attainable in
  legal practice. But we must be reasonable. The law has to be administered;
  and if certainty, in the most extreme, academic sense, is unattainable, we
  must be guided in our action by the highest degree of probability that is
  within our reach."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I realize that. But still you admit that a fallacy is conceivable.
  Can you list for the sake of illustration, suggest any such possibility in
  the evidence that you have read?"</p>

  <p>"Well," he replied, "as a matter of purely academic interest, there is the
  point that I mentioned just now. The body of this man contained a lethal
  quantity of arsenic. With that quantity of poison in his body, the man died.
  The obvious inference is that those two facts were connected as cause and
  effect. But it is not absolutely certain that they were. It is conceivable
  that the man may have died from some natural cause overlooked by the
  pathologist&mdash;who was already aware of the presence of arsenic, from
  Detling's information; or again it is conceivable that the man may have been
  murdered in some other way&mdash;even by the administration of some other,
  more rapidly acting poison, which was never found because it was never looked
  for. These are undeniable possibilities. But I doubt if any reasonable person
  would entertain them, seeing that they are mere conjectures unsupported by
  any sort of evidence. And you notice that the second possibility leaves the
  verdict of wilful murder unaffected."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but it might transfer the effects of that verdict to the wrong
  person."</p>

  <p>"True," he rejoined with a smile. "It might transfer them from a poisoner
  who had committed a murder to another poisoner who had only attempted to
  commit one; and the irony of the position would be that the latter would
  actually believe himself to be the murderer. But as I said, this is mere
  academic talk. The coroner's verdict is the reality with which we have to
  deal."</p>

  <p>"I am not so sure of that, Thorndyke," said I, inspired with a sudden hope
  by his 'illustration.' "You admit that fallacies are possible and you are
  able to suggest two off-hand. You insist, very properly, that our opinions at
  present must be based exclusively on the evidence given at the inquest. But,
  as I listened to that evidence, I had the feeling&mdash;and I have it
  still&mdash;that it did not give a credible explanation of the facts that
  were proved. I had&mdash;and have&mdash;the feeling that careful and
  competent investigation might bring to light some entirely new evidence."</p>

  <p>"It is quite possible," he admitted, rather drily.</p>

  <p>"Well, then," I pursued, "I should wish some such investigation to be
  made. I can recall a number of cases in which the available evidence, as in
  the present case, appeared to point to a certain definite conclusion, but in
  which investigations undertaken by you brought out a body of new evidence
  pointing in a totally different direction. There was the Hornby case, the
  case of Blackmore, deceased, the Bellingham case and a number of others in
  which the result of your investigations was to upset completely a
  well-established case against some suspected individual."</p>

  <p>He nodded, but made no comment, and I concluded with the question: "Well,
  why should not a similar result follow in the present case?"</p>

  <p>He reflected for a few moments and then asked: "What is it that is in your
  mind, Mayfield? What, exactly do you propose?"</p>

  <p>"I am proposing that you should allow me to retain you on my own behalf
  and that of other interested parties to go thoroughly into this case."</p>

  <p>"With what object?"</p>

  <p>"With the object of bringing to light the real facts connected with the
  death of Harold Monkhouse."</p>

  <p>"Are you authorized by any of the interested parties to make this
  proposal?"</p>

  <p>"No; and perhaps I had better leave them out and make the proposal on my
  own account only."</p>

  <p>He did not reply immediately but sat looking at me steadily with a rather
  inscrutable expression which I found a little disturbing. At length he spoke,
  with unusual deliberation and emphasis.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure, Mayfield, that you want the real facts brought to
  light?"</p>

  <p>I stared at him, startled and a good deal taken aback by his question, and
  especially by the tone in which it was put. "But, surely," I stammered, in
  reply. "Why not?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be hasty, Mayfield," said he. "Reflect calmly and impartially
  before you commit yourself to any course of action of which you cannot
  foresee the consequences. Perhaps I can help you. Shall we, without prejudice
  and without personal bias, take a survey of the status quo and try to see
  exactly where we stand?"</p>

  <p>"By all means," I replied, a little uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "the position is this. A man has died in a certain house,
  to which he has been confined as an invalid for some considerable time. The
  cause of his death is stated to be poisoning by arsenic. That statement is
  made by a competent medical witness who has had the fullest opportunity to
  ascertain the facts. He makes the statement with complete confidence that it
  is a true statement, and his opinion is supported by those of two other
  competent professional witnesses. It is an established fact, which cannot be
  contested, that the body of deceased contained sufficient arsenic to cause
  his death. So far as we can see, there is not the slightest reason to doubt
  that the man died from arsenical poisoning.</p>

  <p>"When we come to the question, 'How did the arsenic find its way into the
  man's body?' there appears to be only one possible answer. Suicide and
  accident are clearly excluded. The evidence makes it practically certain that
  the poison was administered to him by some person or persons with the intent
  to compass his death; and the circumstances in which the poisoning occurred
  make it virtually certain that the arsenic was administered to this man by
  some person or persons customarily and intimately in contact with him.</p>

  <p>"The evidence shows that there were eight persons who would answer this
  description; and we have no knowledge of the existence of any others. Those
  persons are: Barbara Monkhouse, Madeline Norris, Anthony Wallingford, the
  housemaid, Mabel Withers, the cook, the kitchenmaid, Dr Dimsdale and Rupert
  Mayfield. Of these eight persons the police will assume that one, or more,
  administered the poison; and, so far as we can see, the police are probably
  right."</p>

  <p>I was rather staggered by his bluntness. But I had asked for his opinion
  and I had got it. After a brief pause, I said: "We are still, of course,
  dealing with the depositions. On those, as you say, a presumption of guilt
  lies against these eight persons collectively. That doesn't carry us very far
  in a legal sense. You can't indict eight persons as having among them the
  guilty party. Do you take it that the presumption of guilt lies more heavily
  on some of these persons than on others?"</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly," he replied. "I enumerated them merely as the body of
  persons who fulfilled the necessary conditions as to opportunity and among
  whom the police will&mdash;reasonably&mdash;look for the guilty person. In a
  sense, they are all suspect until the guilt is fixed on a particular person.
  They all had, technically, a motive, since they all benefited by the death of
  deceased. Actually, none of them has been shown to have any motive at all in
  an ordinary and reasonable sense. But for practical purposes, several of them
  can almost be put outside the area of suspicion; the kitchenmaid, for
  instance, and Dr Dimsdale and yourself."</p>

  <p>"And Mrs Monkhouse," I interposed, "seeing that she appears to have been
  absent and far away on each occasion when the poison seems to have been
  administered."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," he agreed. "In fact, her absence would seem to exclude her
  from the group of possible suspects. But apart from its bearing on herself,
  her absence from home on these occasions has a rather important bearing on
  some of the others."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" said I, trying rapidly to judge what that bearing might be.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is this: the fact that the poisoning occurred&mdash;as it
  appears&mdash;only when Mrs Monkhouse was away from home, suggests not only
  that the poisoner was fully cognizant of her movements, which all the
  household would be, but that her presence at home would have hindered that
  poisoner from administering the poison. Now, the different persons in the
  house would be differently affected by her presence. We need not pursue the
  matter any further just now, but you must see that the hindrance to the
  poisoning caused by Mrs Monkhouse's presence would be determined by the
  nature of the relations between Mrs Monkhouse and the poisoner."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I see that."</p>

  <p>"And you see that this circumstance tends to confirm the belief that the
  crime was committed by a member of the household?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose it does," I admitted, grudgingly.</p>

  <p>"It does, certainly," said Thorndyke; "and that being so, I ask you again:
  do you think it expedient that you should meddle with this case? If you do,
  you will be taking a heavy responsibility; for I must remind you that you are
  not proposing to employ me as a counsel, but as an investigator who may
  become a witness. Now, when I plead in court, I act like any other counsel; I
  plead my client's case frankly as an advocate, knowing that the judge is
  there to watch over the interests of justice. But as an investigator or
  witness I am concerned only with the truth. I never give ex parte evidence.
  If I investigate a crime and discover the criminal, I denounce him, even
  though he is my employer; for otherwise I should become an accessory. Whoever
  employs me as an investigator of crime does so at his own risk.</p>

  <p>"Bear this in mind, Mayfield, before you go any further in this matter. I
  don't know what your relations are to these people, but I gather that they
  are your friends; and I want you to consider very seriously whether you are
  prepared to risk the possible consequences of employing me. It is actually
  possible that one or more of these persons may be indicted for the murder of
  Harold Monkhouse. That would, in any case, be extremely painful for you. But
  if it happened through the action of the police, you would be, after all, but
  a passive spectator of the catastrophe. Very different would be the position
  if it were your own hand that had let the axe fall. Are you prepared to face
  the risk of such a possibility?"</p>

  <p>I must confess that I was daunted by Thorndyke's blunt statement of the
  position. There was no doubt as to the view that he took of the case. He made
  no secret of it. And he clearly gauged my own state of mind correctly. He saw
  that it was not the crime that was concerning me; that I was not seeking
  justice against the murderer but that I was looking to secure the safety of
  my friends.</p>

  <p>I turned the question over rapidly in my mind. The contingency that
  Thorndyke had suggested was horrible. I could not face such a risk. Rather,
  by far, would I have had the murderer remain unpunished than be, myself, the
  agent of vengeance on any of these suspects. Hideous as the crime was, I
  could not bring myself to accept the office of executioner if one of my own
  friends was to be the victim.</p>

  <p>I had almost decided to abandon the project and leave the result to Fate
  or the police. But then came a sudden revulsion. From the grounds of
  suspicion my thoughts flew to the persons suspected; to gentle, sympathetic
  Madeline, so mindful of the dead man's comfort, so solicitous about his
  needs, so eager to render him the little services that mean so much to a sick
  man. Could I conceive of her as hiding under this appearance of tender
  sympathy the purposes of a cruel and callous murderess? The thing was absurd.
  My heart rejected it utterly. Nor could I entertain for a moment such a
  thought of the kindly, attentive housemaid; and even Wallingford, much as I
  disliked him, was obviously outside the area of possible suspicion. An
  intolerable coxcomb he certainly was; but a murderer&mdash;never!</p>

  <p>"I will take the risk, Thorndyke," said I. He looked at me with slightly
  raised eyebrows, and I continued: "I know these people pretty intimately and
  I find it impossible to entertain the idea that any of them could have
  committed this callous, deliberate crime. At the moment, I realize
  circumstances seem to involve them in suspicion; but I am certain that there
  is some fallacy&mdash;that there are some facts which did not transpire at
  the inquest but which might be brought to the surface if you took the case in
  hand."</p>

  <p>"Why not let the police disinter those facts?"</p>

  <p>"Because the police evidently suspect the members of the household and
  they will certainly pursue the obvious probabilities."</p>

  <p>"So should I, for that matter," said he; "and in any case, we can't
  prevent the police from bringing a charge if they are satisfied that they can
  support it. And your own experience will tell you that they will certainly
  not take a case into the Central Criminal Court unless they have enough
  evidence to make a conviction a virtual certainty. But I remind you,
  Mayfield, that they have got it all to do. There is grave suspicion in
  respect of a number of persons, but there is not, at present, a particle of
  positive evidence against any one person. It looks to me as if it might turn
  out to be a very elusive case."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," said I. "That is why I am anxious that the actual perpetrator
  should be discovered. Until he is, all these people will be under suspicion,
  with the peril of a possible arrest constantly hanging over them. I might
  even say, 'hanging over us'; for you, yourself, have included me in the group
  of possible suspects."</p>

  <p>He reflected for a few moments. At length he replied: "You are quite
  right, Mayfield. Until the perpetrator of a crime is discovered and his guilt
  established, it is always possible for suspicion to rest upon the innocent
  and even for a miscarriage of justice to occur. In all cases it is most
  desirable that the crime should be brought home to the actual perpetrator
  without delay for that reason, to say nothing of the importance, on grounds
  of public policy, of exposing and punishing wrong-doers. You know these
  people and I do not. If you are sufficiently confident of their innocence to
  take the risk of associating yourself with the agencies of detection, I have
  no more to say on that point. I am quite willing to go into the case so far
  as I can, though, at present, I see no prospect of success."</p>

  <p>"It seems to you a difficult case, then?"</p>

  <p>"Very. It is extraordinarily obscure and confused. Whoever poisoned that
  unfortunate man, seems to have managed most skilfully to confuse all the
  issues. Whatever may have been the medium through which the poison was given,
  that medium is associated equally with a number of different persons. If the
  medicine was the vehicle, then the responsibility is divided between
  Dimsdale, who prepared it, and the various persons who administered it. If
  the poison was mixed with the food, it may have been introduced by any of the
  persons who prepared it or had access to it on its passage from the kitchen
  to the patient's bedroom. There is no one person of whom we can say that he
  or she had any special opportunity that others had not. And it is the same
  with the motive. No one had any really, adequate motive for killing
  Monkhouse; but all the possible suspects benefited by his death, though they
  were apparently not aware of it."</p>

  <p>"They all knew, in general terms, that they had been mentioned in the will
  though the actual provisions and amounts were not disclosed. But I should
  hardly describe Mrs Monkhouse as benefiting by her husband's death. She will
  not be as well off now as she was when he was alive and the whole of his
  income was available."</p>

  <p>"No. But we were not including her in the group since she was not in the
  house when the poison was being administered. We were speaking of those who
  actually had the opportunity to administer the poison; and we see that the
  opportunity was approximately equal in all. And you see, Mayfield, the
  trouble is that any evidence incriminating any one person would be in events
  which are past and beyond recall. The depositions contain all that we know
  and all that we are likely to know, unless the police are able to ascertain
  that some one of the parties has purchased arsenic from a chemist; which is
  extremely unlikely considering the caution and judgment that the poisoner has
  shown. The truth is that, if no new evidence is forthcoming, the murder of
  Harold Monkhouse will take its place among the unsolved and insoluble
  mysteries."</p>

  <p>"Then, I take it that you will endeavour to find some new evidence? But I
  don't see, at all, how you will go about it."</p>

  <p>"Nor do I," said he. "There seems to be nothing to investigate. However, I
  shall study the depositions and see if a careful consideration of the
  evidence offers any suggestion for a new line of research. And as the whole
  case now lies in the past, I shall try to learn as much as possible about
  everything and everybody concerned. Perhaps I had better begin with you. I
  don't quite understand what your position is in this household."</p>

  <p>"I will tell you with pleasure all about my relations with the Monkhouses,
  but it is a rather long story, and I don't see that it will help you in any
  way."</p>

  <p>"Now, Mayfield." said Thorndyke, "don't begin by considering what
  knowledge may or may not be helpful. We don't know. The most trivial or
  seemingly irrelevant fact may offer a most illuminating suggestion. My rule
  is, when I am gravelled for lack of evidence, to collect, indiscriminately,
  all the information that I can obtain that is in the remotest way connected
  with the problem that I am dealing with. Bear that in mind. I want to know
  all that you can tell me, and don't be afraid of irrelevant details. They may
  not be irrelevant, after all; and if they are, I can sift them out
  afterwards. Now, begin at the beginning and tell me the whole of the long
  story."</p>

  <p>He provided himself with a note-book, uncapped his fountain pen and
  prepared himself to listen to what I felt to be a perfectly useless recital
  of facts that could have no possible bearing on the case.</p>

  <p>"I will take you at your word," said I, "and begin at the very beginning,
  when I was quite a small boy. At that time, my father, who was a widower,
  lived at Highgate and kept the chambers in the Temple which I now occupy. A
  few doors away from us lived a certain Mr Keene, an old friend of my
  father's&mdash;his only really intimate friend, in fact&mdash;and, of course,
  I used to see a good deal of him. Mr Keene, who was getting on in years, had
  married a very charming woman, considerably younger than himself, and at this
  time there was one child, a little girl about two years old. Unfortunately,
  Mrs Keene was very delicate, and soon after the child's birth she developed
  symptoms of consumption. Once started, the disease progressed rapidly in
  spite of the most careful treatment, and in about two years from the outset
  of the symptoms, she died.</p>

  <p>"Her death was a great grief to Mr Keene, and indeed, to us all, for she
  was a most lovable woman; and the poor little motherless child made the
  strongest appeal to our sympathies. She was the loveliest little creature
  imaginable and as sweet and winning in nature as she was charming in
  appearance. On her mother's death, I adopted her as my little sister, and
  devoted myself to her service. In fact, I became her slave; but a very
  willing slave; for she was so quick and intelligent, so affectionate and so
  amiable that, in spite of the difference in our ages&mdash;some eight or nine
  years&mdash;I found her a perfectly satisfying companion. She entered quite
  competently into all my boyish sports and amusements, so that our
  companionship really involved very little sacrifice on my part but rather was
  a source of constant pleasure.</p>

  <p>"But her motherless condition caused Mr Keene a good deal of anxiety. As I
  have said, he was getting on in life and was by no means a strong man, and he
  viewed with some alarm the not very remote, possibility of her becoming an
  orphan with no suitable guardian, for my father was now an elderly man, and I
  was, as yet, too young to undertake the charge. Eventually, he decided, for
  the child's sake, to marry again; and about two years after his first wife's
  death he proposed to and was accepted by a lady named Ainsworth whom he had
  known for many years, who had been left a widow with one child, a girl some
  two years younger than myself.</p>

  <p>"Naturally, I viewed the advent of the new Mrs Keene with some jealousy.
  But there was no occasion. She was a good, kindly woman who showed from the
  first that she meant to do her duty by her little stepdaughter. And her own
  child, Barbara, equally disarmed our jealousy. A quiet, rather reserved
  little girl, but very clever and quickwitted, she not only accepted me at
  once with the frankest friendliness but, with a curious tactfulness for such
  a young girl, devoted herself to my little friend, Stella Keene, without in
  the least attempting to oust me from my position. In effect, we three young
  people became a most united and harmonious little coterie in which our
  respective positions were duly recognized. I was the head of the firm, so to
  speak, Stella was my adopted sister, and Barbara was the ally of us both.</p>

  <p>"So our relations continued as the years passed; but presently the passing
  years began to take toll of our seniors. My father was the first to go. Then
  followed Mr Keene, and after a few more years, Barbara's mother. By the time
  my twenty-fifth birthday came round, we were all orphans."</p>

  <p>"What were your respective ages then?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>Rather surprised at the question, I paused to make a calculation. "My own
  age," I replied, "was, as I have said, twenty-five. Barbara would then be
  twenty-two and Stella sixteen."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke made a note of my answer and I proceeded: "The death of our
  elders made no appreciable difference in our way of living. My father had
  left me a modest competence and the two girls were fairly provided for. The
  houses that we occupied were beyond our needs, reduced as we were in numbers
  and we discussed the question of sharing a house. But, of course, the girls
  were not really my sisters and the scheme was eventually rejected as rather
  too unconventional; so we continued to live in our respective houses."</p>

  <p>"Was there any trustee for the girls?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mr Brodribb. The bulk of the property was, I believe, vested in
  Stella, but, for reasons which I shall come to in a moment, there was a
  provision that, in the event of her death, it should revert to Barbara."</p>

  <p>"On account, I presume, of the tendency to consumption?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly. For some time before Mr Keene's death there had been signs that
  Stella inherited her mother's delicacy of health. Hence the provisions for
  Barbara. But no definite manifestations of disease appeared until Stella was
  about eighteen. Then she developed a cough and began to lose weight; but, for
  a couple of years the disease made no very marked progress, in fact, there
  were times when she seemed to be in a fair way to recovery. Then, rather
  suddenly, her health took a turn for the worse. Soon she became almost
  completely bed-ridden. She wasted rapidly, and, in fact, was now the typical
  consumptive, hectic, emaciated, but always bright, cheerful and full of plans
  for the future and enthusiasm for the little hobbies that I devised to keep
  her amused.</p>

  <p>"But all the time, she was going down the hill steadily, although, as I
  have said, there were remissions and fluctuations; and, in short, after about
  a year's definite illness, she went the way of her mother. Her death was
  immediately caused, I understand, by an attack of hemorrhage."</p>

  <p>"You understand?" Thorndyke repeated, interrogatively.</p>

  <p>"Yes. To my lasting grief, I was away from home when she died. I had been
  recently called to the bar and was offered a brief for the Chelmsford
  Assizes, which I felt I ought not to refuse, especially as Stella seemed,
  just then, to be better than usual. What made it worse was that the telegram
  which was sent to recall me went astray. I had moved on to Ipswich and had
  only just written to give my new address, so that I did not get home until
  just before the funeral. It was a fearful shock, for no one had the least
  suspicion that the end was so near. If I had supposed that there was the
  slightest immediate danger, nothing on earth would have induced me to go away
  from home."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke had listened to my story not only with close attention but with
  an expression of sympathy which I noted gratefully and perhaps with a little
  surprise. But he was a strange man; as impersonal as Fate when he was
  occupied in actual research and yet showing at times unexpected gleams of
  warm human feeling and the most sympathetic understanding. He now preserved a
  thoughtful silence for some time after I had finished. Presently he said: "I
  suppose this poor girl's death caused a considerable change in your way of
  living?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed! Its effects were devastating both on Barbara and me. Neither
  of us felt that we could go on with the old ways of life. Barbara let her
  house and went into rooms in London, where I used to visit her as often as I
  could; and I sold my house, furniture and all and took up residence in the
  Temple. But even that I could not endure for long. Stella's death had broken
  me up completely. Right on from my boyhood, she had been the very hub of my
  life. All my thoughts and interests had revolved around her. She had been to
  me friend and sister in one. Now that she was gone, the world seemed to be a
  great, chilly void, haunted everywhere by memories of her. She had pervaded
  my whole life, and everything about me was constantly reminding me of her. At
  last I found that I could bear it no longer. The familiar things and places
  became intolerable to my eyes. I did not want to forget her; on the contrary,
  I loved to cherish her memory. But it was harrowing to have my loss thrust
  upon me at every turn. I yearned for new surroundings in which I could begin
  a new life; and in the end, I decided to go to Canada and settle down there
  to practise at the Bar.</p>

  <p>"My decision came as a fearful blow to Barbara, and indeed, I felt not a
  little ashamed of my disloyalty to her; for she, too, had been like a sister
  to me and, next to Stella, had been my dearest friend. But it could not be
  helped. An intolerable unrest had possession of me. I felt that I must go;
  and go I did, leaving poor Barbara to console her loneliness with her
  political friends.</p>

  <p>"I stayed in Canada nearly two years and meant to stay there for good.
  Then, one day, I got a letter from Barbara telling me that she was married.
  The news rather surprised me, for I had taken Barbara for an inveterate
  spinster with a tendency to avoid male friends other than myself. But the
  news had another, rather curious effect. It set my thoughts rambling amidst
  the old surroundings. And now I found that they repelled me no longer; that,
  on the contrary, they aroused a certain feeling of home-sickness, a yearning
  for the fuller, richer life of London and a sight of the English countryside.
  In not much more than a month, I had wound up my Canadian affairs and was
  back in my old chambers in the Temple, which I had never given up, ready to
  start practice afresh."</p>

  <p>"That," said Thorndyke, "would be a little less than three years ago. Now
  we come to your relations with the Monkhouse establishment."</p>

  <p>"Yes; and I drifted into them almost at once. Barbara received me with
  open arms, and of course, Monkhouse knew all about me and accepted me as an
  old friend. Very soon I found myself, in a way, a member of the household. A
  bedroom was set apart for my use, whenever I cared to occupy it, and I came
  and went as if I were one of the family. I was appointed a trustee, with
  Brodribb, and dropped into the position of general family counsellor."</p>

  <p>"And what were your relations with Monkhouse?"</p>

  <p>"We were never very intimate. I liked the man and I think he liked me. But
  he was not very approachable; a self-contained, aloof, undemonstrative man,
  and an inveterate book-worm. But he was a good man and I respected him
  profoundly, though I could never understand why Barbara married him, or why
  he married Barbara. I couldn't imagine him in love. On the other hand I
  cannot conceive any motive that anyone could have had for doing him any harm.
  He seemed to me to be universally liked in a rather lukewarm fashion."</p>

  <p>"It is of no use, I suppose," said Thorndyke, "to ask you if these
  reminiscences have brought anything to your mind that would throw any light
  on the means, the motive or the person connected with the crime?"</p>

  <p>"No," I answered; "nor can I imagine that they will bring anything to
  yours. In fact, I am astonished that you have let me go on so long dribbling
  out all these trivial and irrelevant details. Your patience is
  monumental."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," he replied. "Your story has interested me deeply. It enables
  me to visualize very clearly at least a part of the setting of this crime,
  and it has introduced me to the personalities of some of the principal
  actors, including yourself. The details are not in the least trivial; and
  whether they are or are not irrelevant we cannot judge. Perhaps, when we have
  solved the mystery&mdash;if ever we do&mdash;we may find connections between
  events that had seemed to be totally unrelated."</p>

  <p>"It is, I suppose, conceivable as a mere, speculative possibility. But
  what I have been telling you is mainly concerned with my own rather remote
  past, which can hardly have any possible bearing on comparatively recent
  events."</p>

  <p>"That is perfectly true," Thorndyke agreed. "Your little autobiography has
  made perfectly clear your own relation to these people, but it has left most
  of them&mdash;and those in whom I am most interested&mdash;outside the
  picture. I was just wondering whether it would be possible for you to amplify
  your sketch of the course of events after Barbara's marriage&mdash;I am, like
  you, using the Christian name, for convenience. What I really want is an
  account of the happenings in that household during the last three years, and
  especially during the last year. Do you think that, if you were to turn out
  the garrets of your memory, you could draw up a history of the house in
  Hilborough Square and its inmates from the time when you first made its
  acquaintance? Have you any sort of notes that would help you?"</p>

  <p>"By Jove!" I exclaimed. "Of course I have. There is my diary."</p>

  <p>"Oh," said Thorndyke, with obviously awakened interest. "You keep a diary.
  What sort of diary is it? Just brief jottings, or a full record?"</p>

  <p>"It is a pretty full diary. I began it more than twenty years ago as a
  sort of schoolboy hobby. But it turned out so useful and entertaining to
  refer to that I encouraged myself to persevere. Now, I am a confirmed
  diarist; and I write down not only facts and events, but also comments, which
  may be quite illuminating to study by the light of what has happened. I will
  read over the last three years and make an abstract of everything that has
  happened in that household. And I hope the reading of that abstract will
  entertain you; for I can't believe that it will help you to unravel the
  mystery of Harold Monkhouse's death."</p>

  <p>"Well," Thorndyke replied, as I rose to take my leave, "don't let your
  scepticism influence you. Keep in your mind the actual position. In that
  house a man was poisoned, and almost certainly feloniously poisoned. He must
  have been poisoned either by someone who was an inmate of that house or by
  someone who had some sort of access to the dead man from without. It is
  conceivable that the entries in your diary may bring one or other such person
  into view. Keep that possibility constantly before you; and fill your
  abstract with irrelevancies rather than risk omitting anything from which we
  could gather even the most shadowy hint."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch9"
     id="ch9"></a>IX. &mdash; SUPERINTENDENT MILLER IS PUZZLED</h2>

  <p class="first">ON arriving at my chambers after my conference with
  Thorndyke, I found awaiting me a letter from a Maidstone solicitor offering
  me a brief for a case of some importance that was to be tried at the
  forthcoming assizes. At first, I read it almost impatiently, so preoccupied
  was my mind with the tragedy in which I was involved. It seemed inopportune,
  almost impertinent. But, in fact it was most opportune, as I presently
  realized, in that it recalled me to the realities of normal life. My duties
  to my friends I did, indeed, take very seriously. But I was not an idle man.
  I had my way to make in my profession and could not afford to drop out of the
  race, to sacrifice my ambitions entirely, even on the altar of
  friendship.</p>

  <p>I sat down and glanced through the instructions. It was a case of alleged
  fraud, an intricate case which interested me at once and in which I thought I
  could do myself credit; which was also the opinion of the solicitor, who was
  evidently anxious for me to undertake it. Eventually, I decided to accept the
  brief, and having written a letter to that effect, I set myself to spend the
  remainder of the evening in studying the instructions and mastering the
  rather involved details. For time was short, since the case was down for
  hearing in a couple of days' time and the morrow would be taken up by my
  engagements at Hilborough Square.</p>

  <p>I pass over the incidents of the funeral. It was a dismal and unpleasant
  affair, lacking all the dignity and pathos that relieve the dreariness of an
  ordinary funeral. None of us could forget, as we sat back in the mourning
  coach as far out of sight as possible, that the corpse in the hearse ahead
  was the corpse of a murdered man, and that most of the bystanders knew it.
  Even in the chapel, the majestic service was marred and almost vulgarized by
  the self-consciousness of the mourners and at the grave-side we found one
  another peering furtively around for signs of recognition. To all of us it
  was a profound relief, when we were once more gathered together in the
  drawing room, to hear the street door close firmly and the mourning carriage
  rumble away down the square.</p>

  <p>I took an early opportunity of mentioning the brief and I could see that
  to both the women the prospect of my departure came as a disagreeable
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"How soon will you have to leave us?" Madeline asked, anxiously.</p>

  <p>"I must start for Maidstone tomorrow morning," I replied.</p>

  <p>"Oh, dear!" she exclaimed. "How empty the place will seem and how lost we
  shall be without you to advise us."</p>

  <p>"I hope," said I, "that the occasions for advice are past, and I shall not
  be so very far away, if you should want to consult me."</p>

  <p>"No," said Barbara, "and I suppose you will not be away for very long.
  Shall you come back when your case is finished or shall you stay for the rest
  of the assizes?"</p>

  <p>"I shall probably have some other briefs offered, which will detain me
  until the assizes are over. My solicitor hinted at some other cases, and of
  course there is the usual casual work that turns up on circuit."</p>

  <p>"Well," she rejoined, "we can only wish you good luck and plenty of work,
  though we shall be glad when it is time for you to come back; and we must be
  thankful that you were here to help us through the worst of our
  troubles."</p>

  <p>The general tenor of this conversation, which took place at the lunch
  table, was not, apparently, to Wallingford's taste; for he sat glumly
  consuming his food and rather ostentatiously abstaining from taking any part
  in the discussion. Nor was I surprised; for the obvious way in which both
  women leant on me was a reproach to his capacity, which ought to have made my
  advice and guidance unnecessary. But though I sympathized in a way with his
  displeasure, it nevertheless made me a little uneasy. For there was another
  matter that I wanted to broach; one in which he might consider himself
  concerned; namely, my commission to Thorndyke. I had, indeed, debated with
  myself whether I should not be wiser to keep my own counsel on the subject;
  but I had decided that they were all interested parties and that it would
  seem unfriendly and uncandid to keep them in the dark. But, for obvious
  reasons, I did not propose to acquaint them with Thorndyke's views on the
  case.</p>

  <p>The announcement, when I made it, was received without enthusiasm, and
  Wallingford, as I had feared, was inclined to be resentful.</p>

  <p>"Don't you think, Mayfield," said he, "that you ought to have consulted
  the rest of us before putting this private inquiry agent, or whatever he is,
  on the case?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I ought," I admitted. "But it is important to us all that the
  mystery should be cleared up."</p>

  <p>"That is quite true," said Barbara, "and for my part, I shall never rest
  until the wretch who made away with poor Harold is dragged out into the light
  of day&mdash;that is, if there is really such a person; I mean, if Harold's
  death was not, after all, the result of some ghastly accident. But is it wise
  for us to meddle? The police have the case in hand. Surely, with all their
  experience and their machinery of detection, they are more likely to be
  successful than a private individual, no matter how clever he may be."</p>

  <p>"That," I replied, "is, in fact, Dr Thorndyke's own view. He wished to
  leave the inquiry to the police; and I may say that he will not come into the
  case unless it should turn out that the police are unable to solve the
  mystery."</p>

  <p>"In which case," said Wallingford, "it is extremely unlikely that an
  outsider, without their special opportunities, will be able to solve it. And
  if he should happen to find a mare's nest, we shall share the glory and the
  publicity of his discovery."</p>

  <p>"I don't think," said I, "that you need have any anxiety on that score. Dr
  Thorndyke is not at all addicted to finding mare's nests and still less to
  publicity. If he makes any discovery he will probably keep it to himself
  until he has the whole case cut and dried. Then he will communicate the facts
  to the police; and the first news we shall have on the subject will be the
  announcement that an arrest has been made. And when the police make an arrest
  on Thorndyke's information, you can take it that a conviction will follow
  inevitably."</p>

  <p>"I don't think I quite understand Dr Thorndyke's position." said Madeline.
  "What is he? You seem to refer to him as a sort of superior private
  detective."</p>

  <p>"Thorndyke," I replied, "is a unique figure in the legal world. He is a
  barrister and a doctor of medicine. In the one capacity he is probably the
  greatest criminal lawyer of our time. In the other he is, among other things,
  the leading authority on poisons and on crimes connected with them; and so
  far as I know, he has never made a mistake."</p>

  <p>"He must be a very remarkable man," Wallingford remarked, drily.</p>

  <p>"He is," I replied; and in justification of my statement, I gave a sketch
  of one or two of the cases in which Thorndyke had cleared up what had seemed
  to be a completely and helplessly insoluble mystery. They all listened with
  keen interest and were evidently so far impressed that any doubts as to
  Thorndyke's capacity were set at rest. But yet I was conscious, in all three,
  of a certain distrust and uneasiness. The truth was, as it seemed to me, that
  none of them had yet recovered from the ordeal of the inquest. In their
  secret hearts, what they all wanted&mdash;even Barbara, as I
  suspected&mdash;was to bury the whole dreadful episode in oblivion. And
  seeing this, I had not the courage to remind them of their&mdash;of our
  position as the actual suspected parties whose innocence it was Thorndyke's
  function to make clear.</p>

  <p>In view of my impending departure from London, I stayed until the evening
  was well advanced, though sensible of a certain impatience to be gone; and
  when, at length, I took my leave and set forth homeward, I was conscious of
  the same sense of relief that I had felt on the previous day. Now, for a
  time, I could dismiss this horror from my mind and let my thoughts occupy
  themselves with the activities that awaited me at Maidstone; which they did
  so effectually that by the time I reached my chambers, I felt that I had my
  case at my fingers' ends. I had just set to work making my preparations for
  the morrow when my glance happened to light on the glazed bookcase in which
  the long series of my diaries was kept; and then I suddenly bethought me of
  the abstract which I had promised to make for Thorndyke. There would be no
  time for that now; and yet, since he had seemed to attach some importance to
  it, I could not leave my promise unfulfilled. The only thing to be done was
  to let him have the diary, itself. I was a little reluctant to do this for I
  had never yet allowed any-one to read it. But there seemed to be no
  alternative; and, after all, Thorndyke was a responsible person; and if the
  diary did contain a certain amount of confidential matter, there was nothing
  in it that was really secret or that I need object to anyone reading.
  Accordingly, I took out the current volume, and, dropping it into my pocket,
  made my way round to King's Bench Walk.</p>

  <p>My knock at the door was answered by Thorndyke, himself, and as I entered
  the room, I was a little disconcerted at finding a large man seated in an
  easy chair by the fire with his back to me; and still more so when, on
  hearing me enter, he rose and turned to confront me. For the stranger was
  none other than Mr Superintendent Miller.</p>

  <p>His gratification at the meeting seemed to be no greater than mine, though
  he greeted me quite courteously and even cordially. I had the uncomfortable
  feeling that I had broken in on a conference and began to make polite
  preparations for a strategic retreat. But Thorndyke would have none of
  it.</p>

  <p>"Not at all, Mayfield," said he. "The superintendent is here on the same
  business as you are, and when I tell him that you have commissioned me to
  investigate this case, he will realize that we are colleagues."</p>

  <p>I am not sure that the superintendent realized this so very vividly, but
  it was evident that Thorndyke's information interested him. Nevertheless he
  waited for me and Thorndyke to make the opening moves and only relaxed his
  caution by slow degrees.</p>

  <p>"We were remarking when you came in," he said, at length, "what a
  curiously baffling case this is, and how very disappointing. At first it
  looked all plain sailing. There was the lady who used to prepare the special
  diet for the unfortunate man and actually take it up to him and watch him eat
  it. It seemed as if we had her in the hollow of our hand. And then she
  slipped out. The arsenic that was found in the stomach seemed to connect the
  death with the food; but then there was that confounded bottle of medicine
  that seemed to put the food outside the case. And when we came to reckon up
  the evidence furnished by the medicine, it proved nothing. Somebody put the
  poison in. All of them had the opportunity, more or less, and all about
  equally. Nothing pointed to one more than another. And that is how it is all
  through. There is any amount of suspicion; but the suspicion falls on a group
  of people, not on anyone in particular."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Thorndyke, "the issues are most strangely confused."</p>

  <p>"Extraordinarily," said Miller. "This queer confusion runs all through the
  case. You are constantly thinking that you have got the solution, and just as
  you are perfectly sure, it slips through your fingers. There are lots of
  clues&mdash;fine ones; but as soon as you follow one up it breaks off in the
  middle and leaves you gaping. You saw what happened at the search, Mr
  Mayfield."</p>

  <p>"I saw the beginning&mdash;the actual search; but I don't know what came
  of it."</p>

  <p>"Then I can tell you in one word. Nothing. And yet we seemed to be right
  on the track every time. There was that secret drawer of Mr Wallingford's.
  When I saw that packet of white powder in it, I thought it was going to be a
  walk-over. I didn't believe for a moment that the stuff was cocaine. But it
  was. I went straight to our analyst to have it tested."</p>

  <p>As the superintendent was speaking I caught Thorndyke's eye, fixed on me
  with an expression of reproachful inquiry. But he made no remark and Miller
  continued: "Then there were those two empty bottles. The one that I found in
  the library yielded definite traces of arsenic. But then, whose bottle was
  it? The place was accessible to the entire household. It was impossible to
  connect it with any one person.</p>

  <p>"On the other hand, the bottle that I found in Miss Norris' cupboard, and
  that was presumably hers&mdash;though she didn't admit it&mdash;contained no
  arsenic; at least the analyst said it didn't, though as it smelt of lavender
  and had a red stain at the bottom, I feel convinced that it had had Fowler's
  Solution in it. What do you think, Doctor? Don't you think the analyst may
  have been mistaken?"</p>

  <p>"No," Thorndyke replied, decidedly. "If the red stain had been due to
  Fowler's Solution there would have been an appreciable quantity of arsenic
  present; probably a fiftieth of a grain at least. But Marsh's test would
  detect a much smaller quantity than that. If no arsenic was found by a
  competent chemist who was expressly testing for it, you can take it that no
  arsenic was there."</p>

  <p>"Well," Miller rejoined, "you know best. But you must admit that it is a
  most remarkable thing that one bottle which smelt of lavender and had a red
  stain at the bottom, should contain arsenic, and that another bottle, exactly
  similar in appearance and smelling of lavender and having a red stain at the
  bottom, should contain no arsenic."</p>

  <p>"I am entirely with you, Miller," Thorndyke agreed. "It is a most
  remarkable circumstance."</p>

  <p>"And you see my point," said Miller. "Every discovery turns out a sell. I
  find a concealed packet of powder&mdash;with the owner lying like
  Ananias&mdash;but the powder turns out not to be arsenic. I find a bottle
  that did contain arsenic, and there is no owner. I find another, similar
  bottle, which has an owner, and there is no arsenic in it. Rum, isn't it? I
  feel like the donkey with the bunch of carrots tied to his nose. The carrots
  are there all right, but he can never get a bite at 'em."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke had listened with the closest attention to the superintendent's
  observations and he now began a cautious cross-examination&mdash;cautious
  because Miller was taking it for granted that I had told him all about the
  search; and I could not but admire his discretion in suppressing the fact
  that I had not. For, while Thorndyke, himself, would not suspect me of any
  intentional concealment, Miller undoubtedly would, and what little confidence
  he had in me would have been destroyed. Accordingly, he managed the
  superintendent so adroitly that the latter described, piecemeal, all the
  incidents of the search.</p>

  <p>"Did Wallingford say how he came to be in possession of all this cocaine
  and morphine?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Miller, "I asked him, but he refused to say where he had got
  it."</p>

  <p>"But he could be made to answer," said Thorndyke. "Both of these drugs are
  poisons. He could be made to account for having them in his possession and
  could be called upon to show that he came by them lawfully. They are not
  ordinarily purchasable by the public."</p>

  <p>"No, that's true," Miller admitted. "But is there any object in going into
  the question? You see, the cocaine isn't really any affair of ours."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't seem to be," Thorndyke agreed, "at least, not directly; but
  indirectly it may be of considerable importance. I think you ought to find
  out where he got that cocaine and morphine, Miller."</p>

  <p>The superintendent reflected with the air of having seen a new light.</p>

  <p>"I see what you mean, Doctor," said he. "You mean that if he got the stuff
  from some Chinaman or common dope merchant, there wouldn't be much in it;
  whereas, if he got it from someone who had a general stock of drugs, there
  might be a good deal in it. Is that the point?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He was able to obtain poisons from somebody, and we ought to know
  exactly what facilities he had for obtaining poisons and what poisons he
  obtained."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is so," said Miller. "Well, I will see about it at once.
  Fortunately he is a pretty easy chappie to frighten. I expect, if I give him
  a bit of a shake-up, he will give himself away; and if he won't, we must try
  other means. And now, as I think we have said all that we have to say at
  present, I will wish you two gentlemen good night."</p>

  <p>He rose and took up his hat, and having shaken our hands, was duly
  escorted to the door by Thorndyke; who, when he had seen his visitor safely
  on to the stairs, returned and confronted me with a look of deep
  significance.</p>

  <p>"You never told me about that cocaine," said he.</p>

  <p>"No," I admitted. "It was stupid of me, but the fact is that I was so
  engrossed by your rather startling observations on the case that this detail
  slipped my memory. And it really had not impressed me as being of any
  importance. I accepted Wallingford's statement that the stuff was cocaine and
  that, consequently, it was no concern of ours."</p>

  <p>"I don't find myself able to agree to that 'consequently', Mayfield. How
  did you know that the cocaine was no concern of ours?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I didn't see that it was, and I don't now. Do you?"</p>

  <p>"No; I know very little about the case at present. But it seems to me that
  the fact that a person in this house had a considerable quantity of a highly
  poisonous substance in his possession is one that at least requires to be
  noted. The point is, Mayfield, that until we know all the facts of this case
  we cannot tell which of them is or is not relevant. Try to bear that in mind.
  Do not select particular facts as important and worthy of notice. Note
  everything in any way connected with our problem that comes under your
  observation and pass it on to me without sifting or selection."</p>

  <p>"I ought not to need these exhortations," said I. "However, I will bear
  them in mind should I ever have anything more to communicate. Probably I
  never shall. But I will say that I think Miller is wasting his energies over
  Wallingford. The man is no favourite of mine. He is a neurotic ass. But I
  certainly do not think he has the makings of a murderer."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke smiled a little drily. "If you are able," said he, "to diagnose
  at sight a potential murderer, your powers are a good deal beyond mine. I
  should have said that every man has the makings of a murderer, given the
  appropriate conditions."</p>

  <p>"Should you really?" I exclaimed "Can you, for instance, imagine either of
  us committing a murder?"</p>

  <p>"I think I can," he replied "Of course, the probabilities are very unequal
  in different cases. There are some men who may be said to be prone to murder.
  A man of low intelligence, of violent temper, deficient in ordinary
  self-control, may commit a murder in circumstances that would leave a man of
  a superior type unmoved. But still, the determining factors are motive and
  opportunity. Given a sufficient motive and a real opportunity, I can think of
  no kind of man who might not commit a homicide which would, in a legal sense,
  be murder."</p>

  <p>"But is there such a thing as a sufficient motive for murder?"</p>

  <p>"That question can be answered only by the individual affected. If it
  seems to him sufficient, it is sufficient in practice."</p>

  <p>"Can you mention a motive that would seem to you sufficient?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I can. Blackmail. Let us take an imaginary case. Suppose a man to be
  convicted of a crime of which he is innocent. As he has been convicted, the
  evidence, though fallacious, is overwhelming. He is sentenced to a term of
  imprisonment&mdash;say penal servitude. He serves his sentence and is in due
  course discharged. He is now free; but the conviction stands against him. He
  is a discharged convict. His name is in the prison books, his photograph and
  his fingerprints are in the Habitual Criminals' Register. He is a marked man
  for life.</p>

  <p>"Now suppose that he manages to shed his identity and in some place where
  he is unknown begins life afresh. He acquires the excellent character and
  reputation to which he is, in fact, entitled. He marries and has a family;
  and he and his family prosper and enjoy the advantages that follow deservedly
  from his industry and excellent moral qualities.</p>

  <p>"And now suppose that at this point his identity is discovered by a
  blackmailer who forthwith fastens on him, who determines to live on him in
  perpetuity, to devour the products of his industry, to impoverish his wife
  and children and to destroy his peace and security by holding over his head
  the constant menace of exposure. What is such a man to do? The law will help
  him so far as it can; but it cannot save him from exposure. He can obtain the
  protection of the law only on condition that he discloses the facts. But that
  disclosure is precisely the evil that he seeks to avoid. He is an innocent
  man, but his innocence is known only to himself. The fact, which must
  transpire if he prosecutes, is that he is a convicted criminal.</p>

  <p>"I say, Mayfield, what can he do? What is his remedy? He has but one; and
  since the law cannot really help him, he is entitled to help himself. If I
  were in that man's position and the opportunity presented itself, I would put
  away that blackmailer with no more qualms than I should have in killing a
  wasp."</p>

  <p>"Then I am not going to blackmail you. Thorndyke, for I have a strong
  conviction that an opportunity would present itself."</p>

  <p>"I think it very probable," he replied with a smile. "At any rate, I know
  a good many methods that I should not adopt, and I think arsenic poisoning is
  one of them. But don't you agree with me?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose I do, at least in the very extreme case that you have put. But
  it is the only case of justifiable premeditated homicide that I can imagine;
  and it obviously doesn't apply to Wallingford."</p>

  <p>"My dear Mayfield," he exclaimed. "How do we know what does or does not
  apply to Wallingford? How do we know what he would regard as an adequate
  motive? We know virtually nothing about him or his affairs or about the crime
  itself. What we do know is that a man has apparently been murdered, and that,
  of the various persons who had the opportunity to commit the murder (of whom
  he is one) none had any intelligible motive at all. It is futile for us to
  argue back and forth on the insufficient knowledge that we possess. We can
  only docket and classify all the facts that we have and follow up each of
  them impartially with a perfectly open mind. But, above all, we must try to
  increase our stock of facts. I suppose you haven't had time to consider that
  abstract of which we spoke?"</p>

  <p>"That is really what brought me round here this evening. I haven't had
  time, and I shan't have just at present as I am starting tomorrow to take up
  work on the Southeastern Circuit. But I have brought the current volume of
  the diary, itself, if you would care to wade through it."</p>

  <p>"I should, certainly. The complete document is much preferable to an
  abstract which might leave me in the dark as to the context. But won't you
  want to have your diary with you?"</p>

  <p>"No, I shall take a short-hand note-book to use while I am away. That is,
  in fact, what I usually do."</p>

  <p>"And you don't mind putting this very confidential document into the hands
  of a stranger?"</p>

  <p>"You are not a stranger, Thorndyke. I don't mind you, though I don't think
  I would hand it to anybody else. Not that it contains anything that the whole
  world might not see, for I am a fairly discreet diarist. But there are
  references to third parties with reflections and comments that I shouldn't
  care to have read by Thomas, Richard and Henry. My only fear is that you will
  find it rather garrulous and diffuse."</p>

  <p>"Better that than overcondensed and sketchy," said he, as he took the
  volume from me. He turned the leaves over, and having glanced at one or two
  pages exclaimed: "This is something like a diary, Mayfield! Quite in the
  classical manner. The common, daily jottings such as most of us make, are
  invaluable if they are kept up regularly, but this of yours is immeasurably
  superior. In a hundred years' time it will be a priceless historical work.
  How many volumes of it have you got?"</p>

  <p>"About twenty: and I must say that I find the older ones quite interesting
  reading. You may perhaps like to look at one or two of the more recent
  volumes."</p>

  <p>"I should like to see those recording the events of the last three
  years."</p>

  <p>"Well, they are all at your service. I have brought you my duplicate
  latchkey and you will find the volumes of the diary in the glazed book-case.
  It is usually kept locked, but as nobody but you will have access to the
  chambers while I am away, I shall leave the key in the lock."</p>

  <p>"This is really very good of you, Mayfield," he said, as I rose to take my
  departure. "Let me have your address, wherever you may be for the time being,
  and I will keep you posted in any developments that may occur. And now,
  good-bye and good luck!" He shook my hand cordially and I betook myself to my
  chambers to complete my preparations for my start on the morrow.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10"></a>X. &mdash; A GREEK GIFT</h2>

  <p class="first">THE incidents of my life while I was following the
  Southeastern Circuit are no part of this history, and I refer to this period
  merely by way of marking the passage of time. Indeed, it was its
  separateness, its detachment from the other and more personal aspects of my
  life that specially commended it to me. In the cheerful surroundings of the
  Bar Mess I could forget the terrible experiences of the last few weeks, and
  even in the grimmer and more suggestive atmosphere of the courts, the close
  attention that the proceedings demanded kept my mind in a state of wholesome
  preoccupation.</p>

  <p>Quite a considerable amount of work came my way, and though most of the
  briefs were small&mdash;so small, often, that I felt some compunction in
  taking them from the more needy juniors&mdash;yet it was all experience and
  what was more important just now, it was occupation that kept my mind
  employed.</p>

  <p>That was the great thing. To keep my mind busy with matters that were not
  my personal concern. And the intensity of my yearning for distraction was the
  measure of the extent to which my waking thoughts tended to be pervaded by
  the sinister surroundings of Harold Monkhouse's death. That dreadful event
  and the mystery that encompassed it had shaken me more than I had at first
  realized. Nor need this be a matter for surprise. Harold Monkhouse had
  apparently been murdered; at any rate that was the accepted view. And who was
  the murderer? Evade the answer as I would, the fact remained that the finger
  of suspicion pointed at my own intimate friends&mdash;nay, even at me. It is
  no wonder, then, that the mystery haunted me. Murder has an ominous sound to
  any ears; but to a lawyer practising in criminal courts the word has
  connotations to which his daily experiences impart a peculiarly, hideous
  vividness and realism. Once, I remember that, sitting in court, listening to
  the evidence in a trial for murder, as my glance strayed to the dock where
  the prisoner stood, watched and guarded like a captured wild beast, the
  thought suddenly flashed on me that it was actually possible&mdash;and to the
  police actually probable&mdash;that thus might yet stand Wallingford or
  Madeline, or even Barbara or myself.</p>

  <p>It would have been possible for me to run home from time to time at
  weekends but I did not. There was nothing that called for my presence in
  London and it was better to stick close to my work. Still, I was not quite
  cut off from my friends, for Barbara wrote regularly and I had an occasional
  letter from Madeline. As to Thorndyke, he was too busy to write unnecessary
  letters and his peculiar circumstances made a secretary impossible, so that I
  had from him no more than one or two brief notes reporting the absence of any
  new developments. Nor had Barbara much to tell excepting that she had decided
  to let or sell the house in Hilborough Square and take up her residence in a
  flat. The decision did not surprise me. I should certainly have done the same
  in her place; and I was only faintly surprised when I learned that she
  proposed to live alone and that Madeline had taken a small flat near the
  school. The two women had always been on excellent terms, but they were not
  specially devoted to one another; and Barbara would now probably pursue her
  own special interests. Of Wallingford I learned only that, on the strength of
  his legacy he had taken a set of rooms in the neighbourhood of Jermyn Street
  and that his nerves did not seem to have benefited by the change.</p>

  <p>Such was the position of affairs when the Autumn Assizes came to an end
  and I returned home. I remember the occasion very vividly, as I have good
  reason to do&mdash;indeed, I had better reason than I knew at the time. It
  was a cold, dark, foggy evening, though not densely foggy, and my taxicab was
  compelled to crawl at an almost funereal pace (to the exasperation of the
  driver) through the murky streets, though the traffic was now beginning to
  thin out. We approached the Temple from the east and eventually entered by
  the Tudor Street Gate whence we crept tentatively across Kings Bench Walk to
  the end of Crown Office Row. As we passed Thorndyke's chambers I looked up
  and had a momentary glimpse of lighted windows glimmering through the fog;
  then they faded away and I looked out on the other side where the great
  shadowy mass of Paper Buildings loomed above us. A man was standing at the
  end of the narrow passage that leads to Fig Tree Court&mdash;a tallish man
  wearing a preposterous wide-brimmed hat and a long overcoat with its collar
  turned up above his ears. I glanced at him incuriously as we approached but
  had no opportunity to inspect him more closely, if I had wished&mdash;which I
  did not&mdash;for, as the cab stopped he turned abruptly and walked away up
  the passage. The suddenness of his retirement struck me as a little odd and,
  having alighted from the cab, I stood for a moment or two watching his
  receding figure. But he soon disappeared in the foggy darkness, and I saw him
  no more. By the time that I had paid my fare and carried my portmanteau to
  Fig Tree Court, he had probably passed out into Middle Temple Lane.</p>

  <p>When I had let myself into my chambers, switched on the light and shut the
  door, I looked round my little domain with somewhat mixed feelings. It was
  very silent and solitary. After the jovial Bar Mess and the bright,
  frequented rooms of the hotels or the excellent lodgings which I had just
  left, these chambers struck me as just a shade desolate. But yet there were
  compensations. A sense of peace and quiet pervaded the place and all around
  were my household gods; my familiar and beloved pictures, the little friendly
  cabinet busts and statuettes, and, above all, the goodly fellowship of books.
  And at this moment my glance fell on the long range of my diaries and I
  noticed that one of the series was absent. Not that there was anything
  remarkable in that since I had given Thorndyke express permission to take
  them away to read. What did surprise me a little was the date of the missing
  volume. It was that of the year before Stella's death. As I noted this I was
  conscious of a faint sense of annoyance. I had, it is true, given him the
  free use of the diary, but only for purposes of reference. I had hardly
  bargained for his perusal of the whole series for his entertainment. However,
  it was of no consequence. The diary enshrined no secrets. If I had, in a way,
  emulated Pepys in respect of fullness, I had taken warning from his
  indiscretions; nor, in fact, was I quite so rich in the material of
  indiscreet records as the vivacious Samuel.</p>

  <p>I unpacked my portmanteau&mdash;the heavier impedimenta were coming on by
  rail&mdash;lit the gas fire in my bedroom, boiled a kettle of water, partly
  for a comfortable wash and partly to fill a hot water bottle wherewith to
  warm the probably damp bed, and then, still feeling a little like a cat in a
  strange house, decided to walk along to Thorndyke's chambers and hear the
  news, if there were any.</p>

  <p>The fog had grown appreciably denser when I turned out of my entry, and,
  crossing the little quadrangle, strode quickly along the narrow passage that
  leads to the Terrace and King's Bench Walk. I was approaching the end of the
  passage when there came suddenly into view a shadowy figure which I
  recognized at once as that of the man whom I had seen when I arrived. But
  again I had no opportunity for a close inspection, for he had already heard
  my footsteps and he now started to walk away rapidly in the direction of
  Mitre Court. For a moment I was disposed to follow him, and did, in fact,
  make a few quick steps towards him&mdash;which seemed to cause him to mend
  his pace; but it was not directly my business to deal with loiterers, and I
  could have done nothing even if I had overtaken him. Accordingly I changed my
  direction, and crossing King's Bench Walk, bore down on Thorndyke's
  entry.</p>

  <p>As I approached the house I was a little disconcerted to observe that
  there were now no lights in his chambers, though the windows above were
  lighted. I ran up the stairs, and finding the oak closed, pressed the
  electric bell, which I could hear ringing on the floor above. Almost
  immediately footsteps became audible descending the stairs and were followed
  by the appearance of a small gentleman whom I recognized as Thorndyke's
  assistant, artificer or familiar spirit, Mr Polton. He recognized me at the
  same moment and greeted me with a smile that seemed to break out of the
  corners of his eyes and spread in a network of wrinkles over every part of
  his face; a sort of compound smile inasmuch as every wrinkle seemed to have a
  smile of its own.</p>

  <p>"I hope, Mr Polton," said I, "that I haven't missed the doctor."</p>

  <p>"No, Sir," he replied. "He is up in the laboratory. We are just about to
  make a little experiment."</p>

  <p>"Well, I am in no hurry. Don't disturb him. I will wait until he is at
  liberty."</p>

  <p>"Unless, sir," he suggested, "you would like to come up. Perhaps you would
  like to see the experiment."</p>

  <p>I closed with the offer gladly. I had never seen Thorndyke's laboratory
  and had often been somewhat mystified as to what he did in it. Accordingly I
  followed Mr Polton up the stairs, at the top of which I found Thorndyke
  waiting.</p>

  <p>"I thought it was your voice, Mayfield," said he, shaking my hand. "You
  are just in time to see us locate a mare's nest. Come in and lend a
  hand."</p>

  <p>He led me into a large room around which I glanced curiously and not
  without surprise. One side was occupied by a huge copying camera, the other
  by a joiner's bench. A powerful back-geared lathe stood against one window, a
  jeweller's bench against the other, and the walls were covered with shelves
  and tool-racks, filled with all sorts of strange implements. From this room
  we passed into another which I recognized as a chemical laboratory, although
  most of the apparatus in it was totally unfamiliar to me.</p>

  <p>"I had no idea," said I, "that the practice of Medical Jurisprudence
  involved such an outfit as this. What do you do with it all? The place is
  like a factory."</p>

  <p>"It is a factory," he replied with a smile; "a place where the raw
  material of scientific evidence is worked up into the finished product
  suitable for use in courts of law."</p>

  <p>"I don't know that that conveys much to me," said I. "But you are going to
  perform some sort of experiment; perhaps that will enlighten me."</p>

  <p>"Probably it will, to some extent," he replied, "though it is only a
  simple affair. We have a parcel here which came by post this evening and we
  are going to see what is in it before we open it."</p>

  <p>"The devil you are!" I exclaimed. "How in the name of Fortune are you
  going to do that?"</p>

  <p>"We shall examine it by means of the X-rays."</p>

  <p>"But why? Why not open it and find out what is in it in a reasonable
  way?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke chuckled softly. "We have had our little experiences, Mayfield,
  and we have grown wary. We don't open strange parcels nowadays until we are
  sure that we are not dealing with a 'Greek gift' of some sort. That is what
  we are going to ascertain now in respect of this."</p>

  <p>He picked up from the bench a parcel about the size of an ordinary
  cigar-box and held it out for my inspection. "The overwhelming probabilities
  are," he continued, "that this is a perfectly innocent package. But we don't
  know. I am not expecting any such parcel and there are certain peculiarities
  about this one that attract one's attention. You notice that the entire
  address is in rough Roman capitals&mdash;what are commonly called 'block
  letters'. That is probably for the sake of distinctness; but it might
  possibly be done to avoid a recognizable handwriting or a possibly traceable
  typewriter. Then you notice that it is addressed to 'Dr Thorndyke' and
  conspicuously endorsed 'personal.' Now, that is really a little odd. One
  understands the object of marking a letter 'personal'&mdash;to guard against
  its being opened and read by the wrong person. But what does it matter who
  opens a parcel?"</p>

  <p>"I can't imagine why it should matter," I admitted without much
  conviction, "but I don't see anything in the unnecessary addition that need
  excite suspicion. Do you?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not; but you observe that the sender was apparently anxious that
  the parcel should be opened by a particular person."</p>

  <p>I shrugged my shoulders. The whole proceeding and the reasons given for it
  struck me as verging on farce. "Do you go through these formalities with
  every parcel that you receive?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"No," he replied. "Only with those that are unexpected or offer no
  evidence as to their origin. But we are pretty careful. As I said just now,
  we have had our experiences. One of them was a box which, on being opened,
  discharged volumes of poisonous gas."</p>

  <p>"The deuce!" I exclaimed, rather startled out of my scepticism and viewing
  the parcel with a new-born respect, not unmixed with apprehension. "Then this
  thing may actually be an infernal machine! Confound it all, Thorndyke!
  Supposing it should have a clockwork detonator, ticking away while we are
  talking. Hadn't you better get on with the X-rays?"</p>

  <p>He chuckled at my sudden change of attitude. "It is all right, Mayfield.
  There is no clockwork. I tried it with the microphone as soon as it arrived.
  We always do that. And, of course, it is a thousand to one that it is just an
  innocent parcel. But we will just make sure and then I shall be at liberty
  for a chat with you."</p>

  <p>He led the way to a staircase leading to the floor above where I was
  introduced to a large, bare room surrounded by long benches or tables
  occupied by various uncanny-looking apparatus. As soon as we entered, he
  placed the parcel on a raised stand while Polton turned a switch connected
  with a great coil; the immediate result of which was a peculiar,
  high-pitched, humming sound as if a gigantic mosquito had got into the room.
  At the same moment a glass globe that was supported on an arm behind the
  parcel became filled with green light and displayed a bright red spot in its
  interior.</p>

  <p>"This is a necromantic sort of business, Thorndyke," said I, "only you and
  Mr Polton aren't dressed for the part. You ought to have tall pointed caps
  and gowns covered with cabalistic signs. What is that queer humming
  noise?"</p>

  <p>"That is the interrupter," he replied. "The green bulb is the Crookes's
  tube and the little red-hot disc inside it is the anti-cathode. I will tell
  you about them presently. That framed plate that Polton has is the
  fluorescent screen. It intercepts the X-rays and makes them visible. You
  shall see, when Polton has finished his inspection."</p>

  <p>I watched Polton&mdash;who had taken the opportunity to get the first
  innings&mdash;holding the screen between his face and the parcel. After a few
  moments' inspection he turned the parcel over on its side and once more
  raised the screen, grazing at it with an expression of the most intense
  interest. Suddenly he turned to Thorndyke with a smile of perfectly
  incredible wrinkliness and, without a word, handed him the screen; which he
  held up for a few seconds and then silently passed to me.</p>

  <p>I had never used a fluorescent screen before and I must confess that I
  found the experience most uncanny. As I raised it before the parcel behind
  which was the glowing green bulb, the parcel became invisible but in its
  place appeared the shadow of a pistol the muzzle of which seemed to be
  inserted into a jar. There were some other, smaller shadows, of which I could
  make nothing, but which seemed to be floating in the air.</p>

  <p>"Better not look too long, Mayfield," said Thorndyke. "X-rays are
  unwholesome things. We will take a photograph and then we can study the
  details at our leisure; though it is all pretty obvious."</p>

  <p>"It isn't to me," said I. "There is a pistol and what looks like a jar. Do
  you take it that they are parts of an infernal machine?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose," he replied, "we must dignify it with that name. What do you
  say, Polton?"</p>

  <p>"I should call it a booby-trap, Sir," was the reply. "What you might
  expect from a mischievous boy of ten&mdash;rather backward for his age."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke laughed. "Listen to the artificer," said he, "and observe how
  his mechanical soul is offended by an inefficient and unmechanical attempt to
  blow us all up. But we won't take the inefficiency too much for granted. Let
  us have a photograph and then we can get to work with safety."</p>

  <p>It seemed that this part also of the procedure was already provided for in
  the form of a large black envelope which Polton produced from a drawer and
  began forthwith to adjust in contact with the parcel; in fact the appearance
  of preparedness was so striking that I remarked:</p>

  <p>"This looks like part of a regular routine. It must take up a lot of your
  time."</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact," he replied, "we don't often have to do this. I
  don't receive many parcels and of those that are delivered, the immense
  majority come from known sources and are accompanied by letters of advice. It
  is only the strange and questionable packages that we examine with the
  X-rays. Of course, this one was suspect at a glance with that disguised
  handwriting and the special direction as to who should open it."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I see that now. But it must be rather uncomfortable to live in
  constant expectation of having bombs or poison-gas handed in by the
  postman."</p>

  <p>"It isn't as bad as that," said he. "The thing has happened only three or
  four times in the whole of my experience. The first gift of the kind was a
  poisoned cigar, which I fortunately detected and which served as a very
  useful warning. Since then I have kept my weather eyelid lifting, as the
  mariners express it."</p>

  <p>"But don't you find it rather wearing to be constantly on the lookout for
  some murderous attack?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all," he answered with a laugh. "It rather adds to the zest of
  life. Besides, you see, Mayfield, that on the rare occasions when these
  trifles come my way, they are so extremely helpful."</p>

  <p>"Helpful!" I repeated. "In the Lord's name, how?"</p>

  <p>"In a number of ways. Consider my position, Mayfield. I am not like an
  Italian or Russian politician who may have scores of murderous enemies. I am
  a lawyer and an investigator of crime. Whoever wants to get rid of me has
  something to fear from me; but at any given time, there will not be more than
  one or two of such persons. Consequently, when I receive a gift such as the
  present one, it conveys to me certain items of information. Thus it informs
  me that some one is becoming alarmed by some proceedings on my part. That is
  a very valuable piece of information, for it tells me that some one of my
  inquiries is at least proceeding along the right lines. It is virtually an
  admission that I have made, or am in the way of making a point. A little
  consideration of the cases that I have in hand will probably suggest the
  identity of the sender. But on this question the thing itself will in most
  cases yield quite useful information as well as telling us a good deal about
  the personality of the sender. Take the present case. You heard Polton's
  contemptuous observations on the crudity of the device. Evidently the person
  who sent this is not an engineer or mechanician of any kind. There is an
  obvious ignorance of mechanism; and yet there is a certain simple ingenuity.
  The thing is, in fact, as Polton said, on the level of a schoolboy's
  booby-trap. You must see that if we had in view two or more possible senders,
  these facts might enable us to exclude one and select another. But here is
  Polton with the photograph. Now we can consider the mechanism at our
  leisure."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, Polton deposited on the bench a large porcelain dish or tray
  in which was a very odd-looking photograph; for the whole of it was jet-black
  excepting the pistol, the jar, the hinges, and a small, elongated spot, which
  all stood out in clear, white silhouette.</p>

  <p>"Why," I exclaimed as I stooped over it, "that is a muzzle-loading
  pistol!"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Thorndyke agreed, "and a pocket pistol, as you can tell by the
  absence of a trigger-guard. The trigger is probably hinged and folds forward
  into a recess. I daresay you know the kind of thing. They were usually rather
  pretty little weapons&mdash;and useful, too, for you could carry one easily
  in your waistcoat pocket. They had octagon barrels, which screwed off for
  loading, and the butts were often quite handsomely ornamented with silver
  mounts. They were usually sent out by the gunsmiths in little baize-lined
  mahogany cases with compartments for a little powder-flask and a supply of
  bullets."</p>

  <p>"I wonder why he used a muzzle-loader?" said I.</p>

  <p>"Probably because he had it. It answers the purpose as well as a modern
  weapon, and, as it was probably made more than a hundred years ago, it would
  be useless to go round the trade enquiring as to recent purchases."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it was safer to use an old pistol than to buy a new one and leave
  possible tracks. But how does the thing work? I can see that the hammer is at
  full cock and that there is a cap on the nipple. But what fires the
  pistol?"</p>

  <p>"Apparently a piece of string, which hasn't come out in the photograph
  except, faintly, just above that small mark&mdash;string is not dense enough
  to throw a shadow at the full exposure&mdash;but you see, about an inch
  behind the trigger, an elongated shadow. That is probably a screw-eye seen
  end-ways. The string is tied to the trigger, passed through the screw-eye and
  fastened to the lid of the box. I don't see how. There is no metal fastening,
  and you see that the lid is not screwed or nailed down. As to how it works;
  you open the lid firmly; that pulls the string tight; that pulls back the
  trigger and fires the pistol into the jar, which is presumably full of some
  explosive; the jar explodes and&mdash;up goes the donkey. There is a noble
  simplicity about the whole thing. How do you propose to open it, Polton?"</p>

  <p>"I think, Sir," replied the latter, "we had better get the paper off and
  have a look at the box."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Thorndyke, "but don't take anything for granted. Make
  sure that the paper isn't part of the joke."</p>

  <p>I watched Polton with intense&mdash;and far from
  impersonal&mdash;interest, wishing only that I could have observed him from a
  somewhat greater distance. But for all his contempt for the "booby-trap," he
  took no unnecessary risks. First, with a pair of scissors, he cut out a piece
  at the back and enlarged the opening so that he could peer in and inspect the
  top of the lid. When he had made sure that there were no pitfalls, he ran the
  scissors round the top and exposed the box, which he carefully lifted out of
  the remainder of the wrapping and laid down tenderly on the bench. It was a
  cigar-box of the flat type and presented nothing remarkable excepting that
  the lid, instead of being nailed or pinned down, was secured by a number of
  strips of stout adhesive paper, and bore, near the middle, a large spot of
  sealing-wax.</p>

  <p>"That paper binding is quite a happy thought," remarked Thorndyke, "though
  it was probably put on because our friend was afraid to knock in nails. But
  it would be quite effective. An impatient man would cut through the front
  strips and then wrench the lid open. I think that blob of sealing-wax answers
  our question about the fastening of the string. The end of it was probably
  drawn through a bradawl hole in the lid and fixed with sealing wax. But it
  must have been an anxious business drawing it just tight enough and not too
  tight. I suggest, Polton, that an inch-and-a-half centre-bit hole just below
  and to the right of the sealing-wax would enable us to cut the string. But
  you had better try it with the photograph first."</p>

  <p>Polton picked the wet photograph out of the dish and carefully laid it on
  the lid of the box, adjusting it so that the shadows of the hinges were
  opposite the actual hinges. Then with a marking-awl he pricked through the
  shadow of the screw-eye, and again about two inches to the right and below
  it.</p>

  <p>"You are quite right, sir," said he as he removed the photograph and
  inspected the lid of the box. "The middle of the wax is exactly over the
  screw-eye. I'll just get the centre-bit."</p>

  <p>He bustled away down the stairs and returned in less than a minute with a
  brace and a large centre-bit, the point of which he inserted into the second
  awl-hole. Then, as Thorndyke grasped the box (and I stepped back a pace or
  two), he turned the brace lightly and steadily, stopping now and again to
  clear away the chips and examine the deepening hole. A dozen turns carried
  the bit through the thin lid and the remaining disc of wood was driven into
  the interior of the box. As soon as the hole was clear, he cautiously
  inserted a dentist's mirror, which he had brought up in his pocket, and with
  its aid examined the inside of the lid.</p>

  <p>"I can see the string, Sir," he reported; "a bit of common white twine and
  it looks quite slack. I could reach it easily with a small pair of
  scissors."</p>

  <p>He handed the mirror to Thorndyke, who, having confirmed his observations,
  produced a pair of surgical scissors from his pocket. These Polton cautiously
  inserted into the opening, and as he closed them there was an audible snip.
  Then he slowly withdrew them and again inserted the mirror.</p>

  <p>"Its all right," said he. "The string is cut clean through. I think we can
  open the lid now." With a sharp penknife he cut through the paper
  binding-strips and then, grasping the front of the lid, continued:</p>

  <p>"Now for it. Perhaps you two gentlemen had better stand a bit farther
  back, in case of accidents."</p>

  <p>I thought the suggestion an excellent one, but as Thorndyke made no move,
  I had not the moral courage to adopt it. Nevertheless, I watched Polton's
  proceedings with my heart in my mouth. Very slowly and gently did that
  cunning artificer raise the lid until it had opened some two inches, when he
  stooped and peered in. Then, with the cheerful announcement that it was "all
  clear," he boldly turned it right back.</p>

  <p>Of course, the photograph had shown us, in general, what to expect, but
  there were certain details that had not been represented. For instance, both
  the pistol and the jar were securely wedged between pieces of
  cork&mdash;sections of wine-bottle corks, apparently&mdash;glued to the
  bottom of the box.</p>

  <p>"How is it," I asked, "that those corks did not appear in the
  photograph?"</p>

  <p>"I think there is a faint indication of them," Thorndyke replied; "but
  Polton gave a rather full exposure. If you want to show bodies of such low
  density as corks, you have to give a specially short exposure and cut short
  the development, too. But I expect Polton saw them when he was developing the
  picture, didn't you, Polton?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," the latter replied; "they were quite distinct at one time, but then
  I developed up to get the pistol out clear."</p>

  <p>While these explanations were being given, Polton proceeded methodically
  to "draw the teeth" of the infernal apparatus. First, he cut a little wedge
  of cork which he pushed in between the threatening hammer and the nipple and
  having thus fixed the former he quietly removed the percussion-cap from the
  latter; on which I drew a deep breath of relief. He next wrenched away one of
  the corks and was then able to withdraw the pistol from the jar and lift it
  out of the box. I took it from him and examined it curiously, not a little
  interested to note how completely it corresponded with Thorndyke's
  description. It had a blued octagon barrel, a folding trigger which fitted
  snugly into a recess, a richly-engraved lock-plate and an ebony butt,
  decorated with numbers of tiny silver studs and a little lozenge-shaped
  scutcheon-plate on which a monogram had been engraved in minute letters,
  which, however, had been so thoroughly scraped out that I was unable to make
  out or even to guess what the letters had been.</p>

  <p>My investigations were cut short by Thorndyke, who, having slipped on a
  pair of rubber gloves, now took the pistol from me, remarking: "You haven't
  touched the barrel, I think, Mayfield?"</p>

  <p>"No," I answered; "but why do you ask?"</p>

  <p>"Because we shall go over it and the jar for fingerprints. Not that they
  will be much use for tracing the sender of this present, but they will be
  valuable corroboration if we catch him by other means; for whoever sent this
  certainly had a guilty conscience."</p>

  <p>With this he delicately lifted out the jar&mdash;a small, dark-brown
  stoneware vessel such as is used as a container for the choicer kinds of
  condiments&mdash;and inverted it over a sheet of paper, upon which its
  contents, some two or three tablespoonfuls of black powder, descended and
  formed a small heap.</p>

  <p>"Not a very formidable charge," Thorndyke remarked, looking at it with a
  smile.</p>

  <p>"Formidable!" repeated Polton. "Why, it wouldn't have hurt a fly! Common
  black powder such as old women use to blow out the copper flues. He must be
  an innocent, this fellow&mdash;if it is a he," he added reflectively.</p>

  <p>Polton's proviso suddenly recalled to my mind the man whom I had seen
  lurking at the corner of Fig Tree Court. It was hardly possible to avoid
  connecting him with the mysterious parcel, as Thorndyke agreed when I had
  described the incident.</p>

  <p>"Yes," exclaimed Polton, "of course. He was waiting to hear the explosion.
  It is a pity you didn't mention it sooner, Sir. But he may be waiting there
  still. Hadn't I better run across and see?"</p>

  <p>"And suppose he is there still," said Thorndyke. "What would you propose
  to do?"</p>

  <p>"I should just pop up to the lodge and tell the porter to bring a
  policeman down. Why, we should have him red-handed."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke regarded his henchman with an indulgent smile. "Your handicraft,
  Polton," said he, "is better than your law. You can't arrest a man without a
  warrant unless he is doing something unlawful. This man was simply standing
  at the corner of Fig Tree Court."</p>

  <p>"But," protested Polton, "isn't it unlawful to send infernal machines by
  parcel post?"</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly it is," Thorndyke admitted, "but we haven't a particle of
  evidence that this man has any connection with the parcel or with us. He may
  have been waiting there to meet a friend."</p>

  <p>"He may, of course," said I, "but seeing that he ran off like a
  lamplighter on both the occasions when I appeared on the scene, I should
  suspect that he was there for no good And I strongly suspect him of having
  some connection with this precious parcel."</p>

  <p>"So do I," said Thorndyke. "As a matter of fact, I have once or twice,
  lately, met a man answering to your description, loitering about King's Bench
  Walk in the evening. But I think it much better not to appear to notice him.
  Let him think himself unobserved and presently he will do something definite
  that will enable us to take action. And remember that the more thoroughly he
  commits himself the more valuable his conduct will be as indirect evidence on
  certain other matters."</p>

  <p>I was amused at the way in which Thorndyke sank all considerations of
  personal safety in the single purpose of pursuing his investigations to a
  successful issue. He was the typical enthusiast. The possibility that this
  unknown person might shoot at him from some ambush, he would, I suspected,
  have welcomed as offering the chance to seize the aggressor and compel him to
  disclose his motives. Also, I had a shrewd suspicion that he knew or guessed
  who the man was and was anxious to avoid alarming him.</p>

  <p>"Well." he said when he had replaced the pistol and the empty jar in the
  box and closed the latter, "I think we have finished for the present. The
  further examination of these interesting trifles can be postponed until
  tomorrow. Shall we go downstairs and talk over the news?"</p>

  <p>"It is getting rather late," said I, "but there is time for a little chat,
  though, as to news, they will have to come from you, for I have nothing to
  tell."</p>

  <p>We went down to the sitting room where, when he had locked up the box, we
  took each an armchair and filled our pipes.</p>

  <p>"So you have no news of any kind?" said he.</p>

  <p>"No; excepting that the Hilborough Square household has been broken up and
  the inmates scattered into various flats."</p>

  <p>"Then the house is now empty?" said he, with an appearance of some
  interest.</p>

  <p>"Yes, and likely to remain so with this gruesome story attached to it. I
  suppose I shall have to make a survey of the premises with a view to having
  them put in repair."</p>

  <p>"When you do," said he, "I should like to go with you and look over the
  house."</p>

  <p>"But it is all dismantled. Everything has been cleared out. You will find
  nothing there but empty rooms and a litter of discarded rubbish."</p>

  <p>"Never mind," said he. "I have occasionally picked up some quite useful
  information from empty rooms and discarded rubbish. Do you know if the police
  have examined the house?"</p>

  <p>"I believe not. At any rate, nothing has been said to me to that
  effect."</p>

  <p>"So much the better." said he. "Can we fix a time for our visit?"</p>

  <p>"It can't be tomorrow," said I, "because I must see Barbara and get the
  keys if she has them. Would the day after tomorrow do, after lunch?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," he replied. "Come and lunch with me; and, by the way,
  Mayfield, it would be best not to mention to anyone that I am coming with
  you, and I wouldn't say anything about this parcel."</p>

  <p>I looked at him with sudden suspicion, recalling Wallingford's
  observations on the subject of mare's nests. "But, my dear Thorndyke!" I
  exclaimed, "you don't surely associate that parcel with any of the inmates of
  that house!"</p>

  <p>"I don't associate it with any particular person," he replied. "I know
  only what you know; that it was sent by someone to whom my existence is, for
  some reason, undesirable, and whose personality is to some extent indicated
  by the peculiarities of the thing itself."</p>

  <p>"What peculiarities do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Well," he replied, "there is the nature and purpose of the thing. It is
  an appliance for killing a human being. That purpose implies either a very
  strong motive or a very light estimate of the value of human life. Then, as
  we have said, the sender is fairly ingenious but yet quite unmechanical and
  apparently unprovided with the common tools which ordinary men possess and
  are more or less able to use. You notice that the combination of ingenuity
  with non-possession of tools is a rather unusual one."</p>

  <p>"How do you infer that the sender possessed no tools?"</p>

  <p>"From the fact that none were used, and that such materials were employed
  as required no tools, though these were not the most suitable materials. For
  instance, common twine was used to pull the trigger, though it is a bad
  material by reason of its tendency to stretch. But it can be cut with a knife
  or a pair of scissors, whereas wire, which was the really suitable material,
  requires cutting pliers to divide it. Again, there were the corks. They were
  really not very safe, for their weakness and their resiliency might have led
  to disaster in the event of a specially heavy jerk in transit. A man who
  possessed no more than a common keyhole saw, or a hand-saw and a chisel or
  two, would have roughly shaped up one or two blocks of wood to fit the pistol
  and jar, which would have made the thing perfectly secure. If he had
  possessed a glue-pot, he would not have used seccotine. But every one has
  waste corks, and they can be trimmed to shape with an ordinary dinner-knife;
  and seccotine can be bought at any stationer's. But, to return to what we
  were saying. I had no special precautions in my mind. I suggested that we
  should keep our own counsel merely on the general principle that it is always
  best to keep one's own counsel. One may make a confidence to an entirely
  suitable person; but who can say that that person may not, in his or her
  turn, make a confidence? If we keep our knowledge strictly to ourselves we
  know exactly how we stand, and that if there has been any leakage, it had
  been from some other source. But I need not platitudinize to an experienced
  and learned counsel."</p>

  <p>I grinned appreciatively at the neat finish; for "experienced counsel" as
  I certainly was not, I was at least able to realize, with secret approval,
  how adroitly Thorndyke had eluded my leading question.</p>

  <p>And at that I left it, enquiring in my turn: "I suppose nothing of
  interest has transpired since I have been away?"</p>

  <p>"Very little. There is one item of news, but that can hardly be said to
  have 'transpired' unless you can associate the process of transpiration with
  a suction-pump. Superintendent Miller took my advice and applied the
  suctorial method to Wallingford with results of which he possibly exaggerates
  the importance. He tells me&mdash;this is, of course, in the strictest
  confidence&mdash;that under pressure, Wallingford made a clean breast of the
  cocaine and morphine business. He admitted that he had obtained those drugs
  fraudulently by forging an order in Dimsdale's name, written on Dimsdale's
  headed note-paper, to the wholesale druggists to deliver to bearer the drugs
  mentioned. He had possessed himself of the note-paper at the time when he was
  working at the account books in Dimsdale's surgery."</p>

  <p>"But how was it that Dimsdale did not notice what had happened when the
  accounts were sent in?"</p>

  <p>"No accounts were ever sent in. The druggists whom Wallingford patronized
  were not those with whom Dimsdale had an account. The order stated, in every
  case, that bearer would pay cash."</p>

  <p>"Quite an ingenious little plan of Wallingford's," I remarked. "It is more
  than I should have given him credit for. And you say that Miller attaches
  undue importance to this discovery. I am not surprised at that. But why do
  you think he exaggerates its importance?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke regarded me with a quizzical smile. "Because," he answered,
  "Miller's previous experiences have been repeated. There has been another
  discovery. It has transpired that Miss Norris also had dealings with a
  wholesale druggist. But in her case there was no fraud or irregularity. The
  druggist with whom she dealt was the one who used to supply her father with
  materia medica and to whom she was well known."</p>

  <p>"Then, in that case, I suppose she had an account with him?"</p>

  <p>"No, she did not. She also paid cash. Her purchases were only occasional
  and on quite a small scale; too small to justify an account."</p>

  <p>"Has she made any statement as to what she wanted the drugs for?"</p>

  <p>"She denies that she ever purchased drugs, in the usual sense, that is
  substances having medicinal properties. Her purchases were, according to her
  statement, confined to such pharmaceutical and chemical materials as were
  required for purposes of instruction in her classes. Which is perfectly
  plausible, for, as you know, academic cookery is a rather different thing
  from the cookery of the kitchen."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know that she had some materials in her cupboard that I shouldn't
  have associated with cookery and I should accept her statement without
  hesitation. In fact, the discovery seems to me to be of no significance at
  all."</p>

  <p>"Probably you are right," said he; "but the point is that, in a legal
  sense, it confuses the issues hopelessly. In her case, as in Wallingford's,
  materials have been purchased from a druggist, and, as no record of those
  purchases has been kept, it is impossible to say what those materials were.
  Probably they were harmless, but it cannot be proved that they were. The
  effect is that the evidential value of Wallingford's admission is discounted
  by the fact that there was another person who is known to have purchased
  materials some of which may have been poisons."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said I, "that is obvious enough. But doesn't it strike you,
  Thorndyke, that all this is just a lot of futile logic-chopping such as you
  might hear at a debating club? I can't take it seriously. You don't imagine
  that either of these two persons murdered Harold Monkhouse, do you? I
  certainly don't; and I can't believe Miller does."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter very much what he believes, or, for that matter, what
  any of us believe. 'He discovers who proves.' Up to the present, none of us
  has proved anything, and my impression is that Miller is becoming a little
  discouraged. He is a genius in following up clues. But where there are no
  clues to follow up, the best of detectives is rather stranded."</p>

  <p>"By the way," said I, "did you pick up anything from my diary that threw
  any light on the mystery?"</p>

  <p>"Very little," he replied; "in fact nothing that gets us any farther. I
  was able to confirm our belief that Monkhouse's attacks of severe illness
  coincided with his wife's absence from home. But that doesn't help us much.
  It merely indicates, as we had already observed, that the poisoner was so
  placed that his or her activities could not be carried on when the wife was
  at home. But I must compliment you on your diary, Mayfield. It is quite a
  fascinating work; so much so that I have been tempted to encroach a little on
  your kindness. The narrative of the last three years was so interesting that
  it lured me on to the antecedents that led up to them. It reads like a
  novel."</p>

  <p>"How much of it have you read?" I asked, my faint resentment completely
  extinguished by his appreciation.</p>

  <p>"Six volumes," he replied, "including the one that I have just borrowed. I
  began by reading the last three years for the purposes of our inquiry, and
  then I ventured to go back another three years for the interest of tracing
  the more remote causation of recent events. I hope I have not presumed too
  much on the liberty that you were kind enough to give me."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," I replied, heartily. "I am only surprised that a man as much
  occupied as you are should have been willing to waste your time on the
  reading of what is, after all, but a trivial and diffuse autobiography."</p>

  <p>"I have not wasted my time, Mayfield," said he. "If it is true that 'the
  proper study of mankind is man,' how much more true is it of that variety of
  mankind that wears the wig and gown and pleads in Court. It seems to me that
  to lawyers like ourselves whose professional lives are largely occupied with
  the study of motives of human actions and with the actions themselves viewed
  in the light of their antecedents and their consequences, nothing can be more
  instructive than a full, consecutive diary in which, over a period of years,
  events may be watched growing out of those that went before and in their turn
  developing their consequences and elucidating the motives of the actors. Such
  a diary is a synopsis of human life."</p>

  <p>I laughed as I rose to depart. "It seems," said I, "that I wrought better
  than I knew; in fact I am disposed, like Pendennis, to regard myself with
  respectful astonishment. But perhaps I had better not be too puffed up. It
  may be that I am, after all, no more than a sort of literary Strasburg goose;
  an unconscious provider of the food of the gods."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke laughed in his turn and escorted me down the stairs to the entry
  where we stood for a few moments looking out into the fog.</p>

  <p>"It seems thicker than ever," said he. "However, you can't miss your way.
  But keep a look-out as you go, in case our friend is still waiting at the
  corner. Good night!"</p>

  <p>I returned his farewell and plunged into the fog, steering for the left
  corner of the library, and was so fortunate as to strike the wall within just
  a few yards of it. From thence I felt my way without difficulty to the
  Terrace where I halted for a moment to look about and listen; and as there
  was no sign, visible or audible of any loiterer at the corner, I groped my
  way into the passage and so home to my chambers without meeting a single
  human creature.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11"></a>XI. &mdash; THE RIVALS</h2>

  <p class="first">THE warmth with which Barbara greeted me when I made my
  first appearance at her flat struck me as rather pathetic, and for the first
  time I seemed to understand what it was that had induced her to marry Harold
  Monkhouse. She was not a solitary woman by nature and she had never been used
  to a solitary existence. When Stella's death had broken up her home and left
  her with no intimate friend in the world but me, I had been too much taken up
  with my own bereavement to give much consideration to her. But now, as she
  stood before me in her pretty sitting room, holding both my hands and smiling
  her welcome, it was suddenly borne in on me that her state was rather forlorn
  in spite of her really comfortable means. Indeed, my heart prompted me to
  some demonstrations of affection and I was restrained only by the caution of
  a confirmed bachelor. For Barbara was now a widow; and even while my sympathy
  with my almost life long friend tempted me to pet her a little, some faint
  echoes of Mr. Tony Weller's counsels bade me beware.</p>

  <p>"You are quite an anchoress here, Barbara," I said, "though you have a
  mighty comfortable cell. I see you have a new maid, too. I should have
  thought you would have brought Mabel with you."</p>

  <p>"She wouldn't come&mdash;naturally. She said she preferred to go and live
  among strangers and forget what had happened at Hilborough Square. Poor
  Mabel! She was very brave and good, but it was a terrible experience for
  her."</p>

  <p>"Do you know what has become of her?"</p>

  <p>"No. She has disappeared completely. Of course, she has never applied for
  a reference."</p>

  <p>"Why 'of course'?"</p>

  <p>"My dear Rupert," she replied a little bitterly, "do you suppose that she
  would want to advertise her connection with Mrs Harold Monkhouse?"</p>

  <p>"No, I suppose she would be likely to exaggerate the publicity of the
  affair, as I think you do. And how is Madeline? I rather expected that you
  and she would have shared a flat. Why didn't you?"</p>

  <p>Barbara was disposed to be evasive. "I don't know," she replied, "that the
  plan commended itself to either of us. We have our separate interests, you
  know. At any rate, she never made any such suggestion and neither did I."</p>

  <p>"Do you ever see Wallingford now?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Indeed, I do," she replied; "in fact I have had to hint to him that he
  mustn't call too frequently. One must consider appearances, and, until I
  spoke, he was here nearly every day. But I hated doing it."</p>

  <p>"Still, Barbara, it was very necessary. It would be so in the case of any
  young woman, but in your case&mdash;er&mdash;especially so."</p>

  <p>I broke off awkwardly, not liking to say exactly what was in my mind. For,
  of course, in the atmosphere of suspicion which hung about him, his frequent
  visits would be a source of real danger. No motive for the murder had yet
  been suggested. It would be a disaster if his folly were to create the false
  appearance of one. But, as I have said, I shrank from pointing this out,
  though I think she understood what was in my mind, for she discreetly ignored
  the abrupt finish of my sentence and continued: "Poor Tony! He is so very
  self-centred and he seems so dependent on me. And really, Rupert, I am a good
  deal concerned about him."</p>

  <p>"Why?" I asked, rather unsympathetically.</p>

  <p>"He is getting so queer. He was always rather odd, as you know, but this
  trouble seems to be quite upsetting his balance. I am afraid he is getting
  delusions&mdash;and yet, in a way, I hope that he is."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean? What sort of delusions?"</p>

  <p>"He imagines that he is being followed and watched. It is a perfect
  obsession, especially since that superintendent man called on him and
  cross-questioned him. But I don't think I told you about that."</p>

  <p>"No, you did not," said I, quite truthfully, but with an uncomfortable
  feeling that I was indirectly telling a lie.</p>

  <p>"Well, it seems that this man, Miller, called at his rooms&mdash;so you
  see he knew where Tony was living&mdash;and, according to Tony's account,
  extracted by all sorts of dreadful threats, a full confession of the means by
  which he obtained that cocaine."</p>

  <p>"And how did he obtain it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, he just bought it at a wholesale druggist's. Rather casual of the
  druggist to have supplied him, I think, but still, he needn't have made such
  a secret of it. However, since then he has been possessed by this obsession.
  He imagines that he is constantly under observation. He thinks that some man
  hangs about near his rooms and watches his comings and goings and follows him
  about whenever he goes abroad. I suppose there can't be anything in it?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not. The police have something better to do than spend their
  time shadowing harmless idiots. Why on earth should they shadow him? If they
  have any suspicions of him, those suspicions relate to the past, not to the
  present."</p>

  <p>"But I don't think Tony connects these watchers with the police. I fancy
  he suspects them of being agents of Dr Thorndyke. You remember that he was
  suspicious and uneasy about Dr Thorndyke from the first; and I know that he
  suspects him of having set the superintendent on him about the cocaine."</p>

  <p>"The deuce he does!" I exclaimed, a little startled. "Have you any idea
  what makes him suspect Thorndyke of that?"</p>

  <p>"He says that the superintendent accepted his statement at the time when
  the cocaine was found, or at least, did not seem disposed to press him on the
  question as to where he obtained it, and that this inquisition occurred only
  after you had put the case in Dr Thorndyke's hands."</p>

  <p>I reflected on this statement with some surprise. Of course, Wallingford
  was quite right, as I knew from first-hand knowledge. But how had he arrived
  at this belief? Was it a mere guess, based on his evident prejudice against
  Thorndyke? Or had he something to go on? And was it possible that his other
  suspicions might be correct? Could it be that Thorndyke was really keeping
  him under observation? I could imagine no object for such a proceeding. But
  Thorndyke's methods were so unlike those of the police or of anyone else that
  it was idle to speculate on what he might do; and his emphatic advice to
  Miller showed that he regarded Wallingford at least with some interest.</p>

  <p>"Well, Barbara," I said, mentally postponing the problem for future
  consideration, "let us forget Wallingford and everybody else. What are we
  going to do this afternoon? Is there a matinee that we could go to, or shall
  we go and hear some music?"</p>

  <p>"No, Rupert," she replied. "I don't want any theatres or music. I can have
  those when you are not here. Let us go and walk about Kensington Gardens and
  gossip as we used to in the old days. But we have a little business to
  discuss first. Let us get that finished and then we can put it away and be
  free. You were going to advise me about the house in Hilborough Square. My
  own feeling is that I should like to sell it and have done with it once for
  all."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't do that, Barbara," said I. "It is a valuable property, but
  just at present its value is depreciated. It would be difficult to dispose of
  at anything like a reasonable price until recent events have been forgotten.
  The better plan would be to let it at a low rent for a year or two."</p>

  <p>"But would anybody take it?"</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly, if the rent were low enough. Leave it to Brodribb and me to
  manage. You needn't come into the matter at all beyond signing the lease. Is
  the house in fairly good repair?"</p>

  <p>"Most of it is, but there are one or two rooms that will need
  redecorating, particularly poor Harold's. That had to be left when the other
  rooms were done because he refused to be disturbed. It is in a very
  dilapidated state. The paint is dreadfully shabby and the paper is positively
  dropping off the walls in places. I daresay you remember its condition."</p>

  <p>"I do, very well, seeing that I helped Madeline to paste some of the loose
  pieces back in their places. But we needn't go into details now. I will go
  and look over the house and see what is absolutely necessary to make the
  place presentable. Who has the keys?"</p>

  <p>"I have the latch-keys. The other keys are inside the house."</p>

  <p>"And I suppose you don't wish to inspect the place yourself?"</p>

  <p>"No. I do not. I wish never to set eyes upon that house again." She
  unlocked a little bureau, and taking a bunch of latch-keys from one of the
  drawers handed it to me. Then she went away to put on her outdoor
  clothes.</p>

  <p>Left alone in the room, I sauntered round and inspected Barbara's new
  abode, noting how, already, it seemed to reflect in some indefinable way the
  personality of the tenant. It is this sympathetic quality in human
  dwelling-places which gives its special charm and interest to a room in which
  some person of character has lived and worked, and which, conversely, imparts
  such deadly dullness to the "best room" in which no one is suffered to
  distribute the friendly, humanizing litter, and which is jealously preserved,
  with all its lifeless ornamentation&mdash;its unenjoyed pictures and its
  unread books&mdash;intact and undefiled by any traces of human occupation.
  The furniture of this room was mostly familiar to me, for it was that of the
  old boudoir. There was the little piano, the two cosy armchairs, the open
  bookshelves with their array of well-used books, the water-colours on the
  walls, and above the chimney-piece, the little portrait of Stella with the
  thin plait of golden hair bordering the frame.</p>

  <p>I halted before it and gazed at the beloved face which seemed to look out
  at me with such friendly recognition, and let my thoughts drift back into the
  pleasant old times and stray into those that might have been if death had
  mercifully passed by this sweet maid and left me the one companion that my
  heart yearned for. Now that time had softened my passionate grief into a
  tender regret, I could think other with a sort of quiet detachment that was
  not without its bitter-sweet pleasure. I could let myself speculate on what
  my life might have been if she had lived, and what part she would have played
  in it; questions that, strangely enough, had never arisen while she was
  alive.</p>

  <p>I was so immersed in my reverie that I did not hear Barbara come into the
  room, and the first intimation that I had of her presence was when I felt her
  hand slip quietly into mine. I turned to look at her and met her eyes,
  brimming with tears, fixed on me with an expression of such unutterable
  sadness that, in a moment, my heart leaped out to her, borne on a wave of
  sympathy and pity which swept away all my caution and reserve. Forgetful of
  everything but her loneliness and the grief which we shared, I drew her to me
  and kissed her. It seemed the natural thing to do and I felt that she
  understood, though she flushed warmly and the tears started from her eyes so
  that she must needs wipe them away. Then she looked at me with the faintest,
  most pathetic little smile and without a word, we turned together and walked
  out of the room.</p>

  <p>Barbara was, as I have said, a rather inscrutable and extremely
  self-contained woman, but she could be, on occasions, a very delightful
  companion. And so I found her today. At first a little pensive and silent,
  she presently warmed up into a quite unwonted gaiety and chatted so
  pleasantly and made so evident her pleasure at having me back that I yearned
  no more for the Bar Mess but was able to forget the horrors and anxieties of
  the past and give myself up to the very agreeable present.</p>

  <p>I have seldom spent a more enjoyable afternoon. Late autumn as it was, the
  day was mild and sunny, the sky of that wonderful tender, misty blue that is
  the peculiar glory of London. And the gardens, too, though they were
  beginning to take on their winter garb, had not yet quite lost their autumnal
  charm. Still, on the noble elms, thin as their raiment was growing, the
  golden and russet foliage lingered, and the leaves that they had already shed
  remained to clothe the earth with a many-coloured carpet.</p>

  <p>We had crossed the gardens by some of the wider paths and had turned into
  one of the pleasant by-paths when Barbara, spying a seat set back between a
  couple of elms, suggested that we should rest for a few minutes before
  recrossing the gardens to go forth in search of tea. Accordingly we sat down,
  sheltered on either side by the great boles of the elms and warmed by the
  rays of the late afternoon sun; but we had been seated hardly a minute when
  the peace and forgetfulness that had made our ramble so delightful were
  dissipated in a moment by an apparition on the wide path that we had just
  left.</p>

  <p>I was the first to observe it. Glancing back through the interval between
  the elm on my left and another at a little distance, I noticed a man coming
  toward us. My attention was first drawn to him by his rather singular
  behaviour. He seemed to be dividing his attention between something that was
  ahead of him and something behind. But I had taken no special note of him
  until I saw him step, with a rather absurd air of secrecy and caution, behind
  a tree-trunk and peer round it along the way that he had come. After keeping
  a look-out in this fashion for nearly a minute, apparently without result, he
  backed away from the tree and came forward at a quick pace, peering eagerly
  ahead and on both sides and pausing now and again to cast a quick look back
  over his shoulder. I drew Barbara's attention to him, remarking:</p>

  <p>"There is a gentleman who seems to be afflicted with Wallingford's
  disease. He is trying to look all round the compass at once."</p>

  <p>Barbara looked at the man, watching his movements for a time with a faint
  smile. But suddenly the smile faded and she exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"Why, I believe it is Tony! Yes, I am sure it is."</p>

  <p>And Tony it was. I recognized him almost as soon as she spoke. He came on
  now at a quick pace and seemed in a hurry either to escape from what he
  supposed to be behind him or to overtake whatever was in front. He had
  apparently not seen us, for though we must have been visible to him&mdash;or
  we could not have seen him&mdash;we were rendered inconspicuous by the two
  trees between which we sat. Presently he disappeared as the nearer elm-trunk
  hid him from our view, and I waited with half-amused annoyance for him to
  reappear.</p>

  <p>"What a nuisance he is!" said Barbara. "Disturbing our peaceful
  tete-a-tete. But he won't freeze on to us. He would rather forego my much
  desired society than put up with yours." She laughed softly and added in a
  thoughtful tone: "I wonder what he is doing here."</p>

  <p>I had been wondering that, myself. Kensington Gardens were quite near to
  Barbara's flat, but they were a long way from Jermyn Street. It was certainly
  odd that he should be here and on this day of all days. But at this point my
  reflections were interrupted by the appearance of their subject from behind
  the big elm-trunk.</p>

  <p>He came on us suddenly and was quite close before he saw us. When he did
  see us, however, he stopped short within a few paces of us, regarding us with
  a wild stare. It was the first time that I had seen him since the funeral;
  and certainly his appearance had not improved in the interval. There was
  something neglected and dishevelled in his aspect that was distinctly
  suggestive of drink or drugs. But what principally struck me was the
  expression of furious hate with which he glared at me. There was no mistaking
  it. Whatever might be the cause, there could be no doubt that he regarded me
  with almost murderous animosity. He remained in this posture only for a few
  seconds. Then, as Barbara had begun to utter a few words of greeting, he
  raised his hat and strode away without a word.</p>

  <p>Barbara looked at his retreating figure with a vexed smile.</p>

  <p>"Silly fellow!" she exclaimed. "He is angry that I have come out to spend
  a few hours with my oldest friend, and shows it like a bad-mannered child. I
  wish he would behave more like an ordinary person."</p>

  <p>"You can hardly expect him to behave like what he is not," I said.
  "Besides, a very ordinary man may feel jealous at seeing another man admitted
  to terms of intimacy, which are denied to him, with the woman to whom he is
  specially attached. For I suppose, Barbara, we may take it that that is the
  position?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," she admitted. "He is certainly very devoted to me, and I
  am afraid he is rather jealous of you."</p>

  <p>As she spoke, I looked at her and could not but feel a faint sympathy with
  Wallingford. She was really a very handsome woman; and today she was not only
  looking her best; she seemed, in some mysterious way to have grown younger,
  more girlish. The rather sombre gravity of the last few years seemed to be
  quite dissipated since we had left the flat, and much of the charm of her
  youth had come back to her.</p>

  <p>"He looked more than rather jealous," said I. "Venomous hatred was what I
  read in his face. Do you think he has anything against me other than my
  position as his rival in your affections?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I do. He is mortally afraid of you. He believes that you suspect him
  of having at least had a hand in poor Harold's death and that you have set Dr
  Thorndyke to track him down and bring the crime home to him. And his terror
  of Dr Thorndyke is positively an insane obsession."</p>

  <p>I was by no means so sure of this, but I said nothing, and she continued:
  "I suppose you don't know whether Dr Thorndyke does really look on him with
  any suspicion? To me the idea is preposterous. Indeed, I find it impossible
  to believe that there was any crime at all. I am convinced that poor Harold
  was the victim of some strange accident."</p>

  <p>"I quite agree with you, Barbara. That is exactly my own view. But I don't
  think it is Thorndyke's. As to whom he suspects&mdash;if he suspects
  anybody&mdash;I have not the faintest idea. He is a most extraordinarily
  close and secretive man. No one ever knows what is in his mind until the very
  moment when he strikes. And he never does strike until he has his case so
  complete that he can take it into court with the certainty of getting a
  conviction, or an acquittal, as the case may be."</p>

  <p>"But I suppose there are mysteries that elude even his skill?"</p>

  <p>"No doubt there are; and I am not sure that our mystery is not one of
  them. Even Thorndyke can't create evidence, and as he pointed out to me, the
  evidence in our case lies in the past and is mostly irrecoverable."</p>

  <p>"I hope it is not entirely irrecoverable," said she; "for until some
  reasonable solution of the mystery is reached, an atmosphere of suspicion
  will continue to hang about all the inmates of that house. So let us wish Dr
  Thorndyke his usual success; and when he has proved that no one was
  guilty&mdash;which I am convinced is the fact&mdash;perhaps poor Tony will
  forgive him."</p>

  <p>With this, we dismissed the subject, and, getting up from the seat, made
  our way out of the gardens just as the sun was setting behind the trees, and
  went in search of a suitable tea-shop. And there we lingered gossiping until
  the evening was well advanced and it was time for me to see Barbara home to
  her flat and betake myself to Fig Tree Court and make some pretence of doing
  an evening's work.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12"></a>XII. &mdash; THORNDYKE CHALLENGES THE EVIDENCE</h2>

  <p class="first">MY relations with Thorndyke were rather peculiar and a
  little inconsistent. I had commissioned him, somewhat against his
  inclination, to investigate the circumstances connected with the dead of
  Harold Monkhouse. I was, in fact, his employer. And yet, in a certain subtle
  sense, I was his antagonist. For I held certain beliefs which I,
  half-unconsciously, looked to him to confirm. But apparently he did not share
  those beliefs. As his employer, it was clearly my duty to communicate to him
  any information which he might think helpful or significant, even if I
  considered it irrelevant. He had, in fact, explicitly pointed this out to me;
  and he had specially warned me to refrain from sifting or selecting facts
  which might become known to me according to my view of their possible bearing
  on the case.</p>

  <p>But yet this was precisely what I felt myself constantly tempted to do;
  and as we sat at lunch in his chambers on the day after my visit to Barbara,
  I found myself consciously suppressing certain facts which had then come to
  my knowledge. And it was not that those facts appeared to me insignificant.
  On the contrary, I found them rather surprising. Only I had the feeling that
  they would probably convey to Thorndyke a significance that would be
  erroneous and misleading.</p>

  <p>There was, for instance, the appearance of Wallingford in Kensington
  Gardens. Could it have been sheer chance? If so, it was a most remarkable
  coincidence; and one naturally tends to look askance at remarkable
  coincidences. In fact, I did not believe it to be a coincidence at all. I
  felt little doubt that Wallingford had been lurking about the neighbourhood
  of Barbara's flat and had followed us, losing sight of us temporarily, when
  we turned into the by-path. But, knowing Wallingford as I did, I attached no
  importance to the incident. It was merely a freak of an unstable, emotional
  man impelled by jealousy to make a fool of himself. Again, there was
  Wallingford's terror of Thorndyke and his ridiculous delusions on the subject
  of the "shadowings." How easy it would be for a person unacquainted with
  Wallingford's personality to read into them a totally misleading
  significance! Those were the thoughts that drifted half-consciously through
  my mind as I sat opposite my friend at the table. So, not without some
  twinges of conscience, I held my peace.</p>

  <p>But I had not allowed for Thorndyke's uncanny capacity for inferring what
  was passing in another person's mind. Very soon it became evident to me that
  he was fully alive to the possibility of some reservations on my part; and
  when one or two discreet questions had elicited some fact which I ought to
  have volunteered, he proceeded to something like definite
  cross-examination.</p>

  <p>"So the household has broken up and the inmates scattered?" he began, when
  I had told him that I had obtained possession of the keys. "And Mabel Withers
  seems to have vanished, unless the police have kept her in view. Did you hear
  anything about Miss Norris?"</p>

  <p>"Not very much. Barbara and she have exchanged visits once or twice, but
  they don't seem to see much of each other."</p>

  <p>"And what about Wallingford? Does he seem to have been much disturbed by
  Miller's descent on him?"</p>

  <p>I had to admit that he was in a state bordering on panic.</p>

  <p>"And what did Mrs Monkhouse think of the forged orders on Dimsdale's
  headed paper?"</p>

  <p>"He hadn't disclosed that. She thinks that he bought the cocaine at a
  druggist's in the ordinary way, and I didn't think it necessary to undeceive
  her."</p>

  <p>"No. The least said the soonest mended. Did you gather that she sees much
  of Wallingford?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, rather too much. He was haunting her flat almost daily until she
  gave him a hint not to make his visits too noticeable."</p>

  <p>"Why do you suppose he was haunting her flat? So far as you can judge,
  Mayfield&mdash;that is in the strictest confidence, you understand&mdash;does
  there seem to be anything between them beyond ordinary friendliness?"</p>

  <p>"Not on her side, certainly, but on his&mdash;yes, undoubtedly. His
  devotion to her amounts almost to infatuation, and has for a long time past.
  Of course, she realizes his condition, and though he is rather a nuisance to
  her, she takes a very kindly and indulgent view of his vagaries."</p>

  <p>"Naturally, as any well-disposed woman would. I suppose you didn't see
  anything of him yesterday?"</p>

  <p>Of course I had to relate the meeting in Kensington Gardens, and I could
  see by the way Thorndyke looked at me that he was wondering why I had not
  mentioned the matter before.</p>

  <p>"It almost looks," said he, "as if he had followed you there. Was there
  anything in his manner of approach that seemed to support that idea?"</p>

  <p>"I think there was, for I saw him at some distance," and here I felt bound
  to describe Wallingford's peculiar tactics.</p>

  <p>"But," said Thorndyke, "why was he looking about behind him? He must have
  known that you were in front."</p>

  <p>"It seems," I explained, feebly, "that he has some ridiculous idea that he
  is being watched and followed."</p>

  <p>"Ha!" said Thorndyke. "Now I wonder who he supposes is watching and
  following him."</p>

  <p>"I fancy he suspects you," I replied. And so the murder was out, with the
  additional fact that I had not been very ready with my information.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke, however, made no comment on my reticence beyond a steady and
  significant look at me.</p>

  <p>"So," said he, "he suspects me of suspecting him. Well, he is giving us
  every chance. But I think, Mayfield, you would do well to put Mrs Monkhouse
  on her guard. If Wallingford makes a public parade of his feelings towards
  her, he may put dangerous ideas into the head of Mr Superintendent Miller.
  You must realize that Miller is looking for a motive for the assumed murder.
  And if it comes to his knowledge that Harold Monkhouse's secretary was in
  love with Harold Monkhouse's wife, he will think that he has found a motive
  that is good enough."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that had occurred to me; and in fact, I did give her a hint to that
  effect, but it was hardly necessary. She had seen it for herself."</p>

  <p>As we now seemed to have exhausted this topic, I ventured to make a few
  enquiries about the rather farcical infernal machine.</p>

  <p>"Did your further examination of it," I asked, "yield any new
  information?"</p>

  <p>"Very little," Thorndyke replied, "but that little was rather curious.
  There were no finger-prints at all. I examined both the pistol and the jar
  most thoroughly, but there was not a trace of a finger-mark, to say nothing
  of a print. It is impossible to avoid the conclusion that the person who sent
  the machine wore gloves while he was putting it together."</p>

  <p>"But isn't that a rather natural precaution in these days?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"A perfectly natural precaution, in itself," he replied, "but not quite
  consistent with some other features. For instance, the wadding with which the
  pistol-barrel was plugged consisted of a little ball of knitting-wool of a
  rather characteristic green. I will show it to you, and you will see that it
  would be quite easy to match and therefore possible to trace. But you see
  that there are thus shown two contrary states of mind. The gloves suggest
  that the sender entertained the possibility that the machine might fail to
  explode, whereas the wool seems to indicate that no such possibility was
  considered."</p>

  <p>He rose from the table&mdash;lunch being now finished&mdash;and brought
  from a locked cabinet a little ball of wool of a rather peculiar greenish
  blue. I took it to the window and examined it carefully, impressed by the
  curious inconsistency which he had pointed out.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I agreed, "there could be no difficulty in matching this. But as to
  tracing it, that is a different matter. There must have been thousands of
  skeins of this sold to, at least, hundreds of different persons."</p>

  <p>"Very true," said he. "But I was thinking of it rather as a corroborating
  item in a train of circumstantial evidence."</p>

  <p>He put the "corroborating item" back in the cabinet and as, at this moment
  a taxi was heard to draw up at our entry, he picked up a large attache case
  and preceded me down the stairs.</p>

  <p>During the comparatively short journey I made a few not very successful
  efforts to discover what was Thorndyke's real purpose in making this visit of
  inspection to the dismantled house. But his reticence and mine were not quite
  similar. He answered all my questions freely. He gave me a wealth of
  instances illustrating the valuable evidence obtained by the inspection of
  empty houses. But none of them seemed to throw any light on his present
  proceedings. And when I pointed this out, he smilingly replied that I was in
  precisely the same position as himself.</p>

  <p>"We are not looking for corroborative evidence," said he. "That belongs to
  a later stage of the inquiry. We are looking for some suggestive fact which
  may give us a hint where to begin. Naturally we cannot form any guess as to
  what kind of fact that might be."</p>

  <p>It was not a very illuminating answer, but I had to accept it, although I
  had a strong suspicion that Thorndyke's purpose was not quite so vague as he
  represented it to be, and determined unobtrusively to keep an eye on his
  proceedings.</p>

  <p>"Can I give you any assistance?" I enquired, craftily, when I had let him
  into the hall and shut the outer door.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied, "there is one thing that you can do for me which will
  be very helpful. I have brought a packet of cards with me"&mdash;here he
  produced from his pocket a packet of stationer's postcards. "If you will
  write on each of them the description and particulars of one room with the
  name of the occupant in the case of bedrooms, and lay the card on the
  mantelpiece of the room which it describes, I shall be able to reconstitute
  the house as it was when it was inhabited. Then we can each go about our
  respective businesses without hindering one another."</p>

  <p>I took the cards&mdash;and the fairly broad hint&mdash;and together we
  made a preliminary tour of the house, which, now that the furniture, carpets
  and pictures were gone, looked very desolate and forlorn; and as it had not
  been cleaned since the removal, it had a depressingly dirty and squalid
  appearance. Moreover, in each room, a collection of rubbish and discarded
  odds and ends had been roughly swept up on the hearth, converting each
  fireplace into a sort of temporary dust-bin.</p>

  <p>After a glance around the rooms on the ground floor, I made my way up to
  the room in which Harold Monkhouse had died, which was my principal concern
  as well as Thorndyke's.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mayfield," the latter remarked, running a disparaging eye round the
  faded, discoloured walls and the blackened ceiling, "you will have to do
  something here. It is a shocking spectacle. Would you mind roughly sketching
  out the position of the furniture? I see that the bedstead stood by this wall
  with the head, I presume, towards the window, and the bedside table about
  here, I suppose, at his right hand. By the way, what was there on that table?
  Did he keep a supply of food of any kind for use at night?"</p>

  <p>"I think they usually put a little tin of sandwiches on the table when the
  night preparations were made."</p>

  <p>"You say 'they'. Who put the box there?"</p>

  <p>"I can't say whose duty it was in particular. I imagine Barbara would see
  to it when she was at home. In her absence it would be done by Madeline or
  Mabel."</p>

  <p>"Not Wallingford?"</p>

  <p>"No. I don't think Wallingford ever troubled himself about any of the
  domestic arrangements excepting those that concerned Barbara."</p>

  <p>"Do you know who made the sandwiches?"</p>

  <p>"I think Madeline did, as a rule. I know she did sometimes."</p>

  <p>"And as to drink? I suppose he had a water-bottle, at any rate."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that was always there, and a little decanter of whiskey. But he
  hardly ever touched that. Very often a small flagon of lemonade was put on
  the table with the sandwiches."</p>

  <p>"And who made the lemonade?"</p>

  <p>"Madeline. I know that, because it was a very special brand which no one
  else could make."</p>

  <p>"And supposing the sandwiches and the lemonade were not consumed, do you
  happen to know what became of the remainder?"</p>

  <p>"I have no idea. Possibly the servants consumed them, but more probably
  they were thrown away. Well-fed servants are not partial to remainders from a
  sick-room."</p>

  <p>"You never heard of any attacks of illness among any of the servants?"</p>

  <p>"Not to my knowledge. But I shouldn't be very likely to, you know."</p>

  <p>"No. You notice, Mayfield, that you have mentioned one or two rather
  material facts that were not disclosed at the inquest?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I was observing that. And it is just as well that they were not
  disclosed. There were enough misleading facts without them."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke smiled indulgently. "You seem to have made up your mind pretty
  definitely, on the negative side, at least," he remarked; and then, looking
  round once more at the walls with their faded, loosened paper, he continued:
  "I take it that Mr Monkhouse was not a fresh-air enthusiast."</p>

  <p>"He was not," I replied. "He didn't much care for open windows, especially
  at night. But how did you arrive at that fact?"</p>

  <p>"I was looking at the wallpaper. This is not a damp house, but yet the
  paper on the walls of this room is loosening and peeling off in all
  directions. And if you notice the distribution of this tendency you get the
  impression that the moisture which loosened the paper proceeded from the
  neighbourhood of the bed. The wall which is most affected is the one against
  which the bed stood; and the part of that wall that has suffered most is that
  which was nearest to the occupant of the bed, and especially to his head.
  That large piece, hanging down, is just where the main stream of his breath
  would have impinged."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I see the connection now you mention it; and yet I am surprised that
  his breath alone should have made the air of the room so damp. All through
  the winter season, when the window would be shut most closely, the gas was
  burning; and at night, when the gas was out, he commonly had his candle-lamp
  alight. I should have thought that the gas and the candle together would have
  kept the air fairly dry."</p>

  <p>"That," said Thorndyke, "is a common delusion. As a matter of fact they
  would have quite the opposite effect. You have only to hold an inverted
  tumbler over a burning candle to realize, from the moisture which immediately
  condenses on the inside of the tumbler, that the candle, as it burns, gives
  off quite a considerable volume of steam. But of course, the bulk of the
  moisture which has caused the paper to peel in this room came from the man's
  own breath. However, we didn't come here for debating purposes. Let us
  complete our preliminary tour, and when we have seen the whole house we can
  each make such more detailed inspection as seems necessary for our particular
  purposes."</p>

  <p>We accordingly resumed our perambulation (but I noticed that Thorndyke
  deposited his attache case in Monkhouse's room with the evident intention of
  returning thither), both of us looking about narrowly: Thorndyke, no doubt,
  in search of the mysterious "traces" of which he had spoken, and I with an
  inquisitive endeavour to ascertain what kind of objects or appearances he
  regarded as "traces."</p>

  <p>We had not gone very far before we encountered an object that even I was
  able to recognize as significant. It was in a corner of the long corridor
  that we came upon a little heap of rubbish that had been swept up out of the
  way; and at the very moment when Thorndyke stopped short with his eyes fixed
  on it, I saw the object&mdash;a little wisp of knitting-wool of the
  well-remembered green colour. Thorndyke picked it up, and, having exhibited
  it to me, produced from his letter-case a little envelope such as seedsmen
  use, in which he put the treasure trove, and as he uncapped his fountain pen,
  he looked up and down the corridor.</p>

  <p>"Which is the nearest room to this spot?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Madeline's," I replied. "That is the door of her bedroom, on the right.
  But all the principal bedrooms are on this floor and Barbara's boudoir as
  well. This heap of rubbish is probably the sweepings from all the rooms."</p>

  <p>"That is what it looks like," he agreed as he wrote the particulars on the
  envelope and slipped the latter in his letter-case. "You notice that there
  are some other trifles in this heap&mdash;some broken glass, for instance.
  But I will go through it when we have finished our tour, though I may as well
  take this now."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he stooped and picked up a short piece of rather irregularly
  shaped glass rod with a swollen, rounded end.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"It is a portion of a small glass pestle and it belongs to one of those
  little glass mortars such as chemists use in rubbing up powders into
  solutions or suspensions. You had better not touch it, though it has probably
  been handled pretty freely. But I shall test it on the chance of discovering
  what it was last used for."</p>

  <p>He put it away carefully in another seed-envelope and then looked down
  thoughtfully at the miniature dust-heap; but he made no further
  investigations at the moment and we resumed the perambulation, I placing the
  identification card on the mantelpiece of each room while he looked sharply
  about him, opening all cupboards and receptacles and peering into their,
  usually empty, interiors.</p>

  <p>When we had inspected the servants' bedrooms and the attics&mdash;leaving
  the indispensable cards&mdash;we went down to the basement and visited the
  kitchen, the scullery, the servants' parlour and the cellars; and this
  brought our tour to an end.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Thorndyke, "we proceed from the general to the particular.
  While you are drawing up your schedule of dilapidations I will just browse
  about and see if I can pick up any stray crumbs in which inference can find
  nourishment. It isn't a very hopeful quest, but you observe that we have
  already lighted on two objects which may have a meaning for us."</p>

  <p>"Yes, we have ascertained that someone in this house used a particular
  kind of wool and that someone possessed a glass mortar. Those do not seem to
  me very weighty facts."</p>

  <p>"They are not," he agreed; "indeed, they are hardly facts at all. The
  actual fact is that we have found the things here. But trifles light as air
  sometimes serve to fill up the spaces in a train of circumstantial evidence.
  I think I will go and have another look at that rubbish-heap."</p>

  <p>I was strongly tempted to follow him, but could hardly do so in face of
  his plainly expressed wish to make his inspection alone. Moreover, I had
  already seen that there was more to be done than I had supposed. The house
  was certainly not in bad repair, but neither did it look very fresh nor
  attractive. Furniture and especially pictures have a way of marking indelibly
  the walls of a room, and the paintwork in several places showed disfiguring
  traces of wear. But I was anxious to let this house, even at a nominal rent,
  so that, by a few years' normal occupation its sinister reputation might be
  forgotten and its value restored.</p>

  <p>As a result, I was committed to a detailed inspection of the whole house
  and the making of voluminous notes on the repairs and re-decorations which
  would be necessary to tempt even an impecunious tenant to forget that this
  was a house in which a murder had been committed. For that was the current
  view, erroneous as I believed it to be. Note-book in hand, I proceeded
  systematically from room to room and from floor to floor, and became so
  engrossed with my own business that I almost forgot Thorndyke; though I could
  hear him moving about the house, and once I met him&mdash;on the first floor,
  with a couple of empty medicine bottles and a small glass jar in his hands,
  apparently making his way to Harold's room, where, as I have said, he had
  left his attache case.</p>

  <p>That room I left to the last, as it was already entered in my list and I
  did not wish to appear to spy upon Thorndyke's proceedings. When, at length,
  I entered the room I found that he, like myself, had come to the end of his
  task. On the floor his attache case lay open, crammed with various objects,
  several of which appeared to be bottles, wrapped in oddments of waste paper
  (including some pieces of wallpaper which he had apparently stripped off ad
  hoc when the other supplies failed) and among which I observed a crumpled
  fly-paper. Respecting this I remarked: "I don't see why you are burdening
  yourself with this. A fly-paper is in no sense an incriminating object, even
  though such things have, at times, been put to unlawful use."</p>

  <p>"Very true," he replied as he peeled off the rubber gloves which he had
  been wearing during the search. "A fly-paper is a perfectly normal domestic
  object. But, as you say, it can on occasion be used as a source of arsenic
  for criminal purposes; and a paper that has been so used will be found to
  have had practically the whole of the arsenic soaked out of it. As I happened
  to find this in the servants' parlour, it seemed worth while to take it to
  see whether its charge of arsenic had or had not been extracted."</p>

  <p>"But," I objected, "why on earth should the poisoner&mdash;if there really
  is such a person&mdash;have been at the trouble of soaking out fly papers
  when apparently he was able to command an unlimited supply of Fowler's
  Solution?"</p>

  <p>"Quite a pertinent question, Mayfield," he rejoined. "But may I ask my
  learned friend whether he found the evidence relating to the Fowler's
  Solution perfectly satisfactory?"</p>

  <p>"But surely!" I exclaimed. "You had the evidence of two expert witnesses
  on the point. What more would you require? What is the difficulty?"</p>

  <p>"The difficulty is this. There were several witnesses who testified that
  when they saw the bottle of medicine, the Fowler's Solution had not yet been
  added; but there was none who saw the bottle after the addition had been
  made."</p>

  <p>"But it must have been added before Mabel gave the patient the last
  dose."</p>

  <p>"That is the inference. But Mabel said nothing to that effect. She was not
  asked what colour the medicine was when she gave the patient that dose."</p>

  <p>"But what of the analysts and the post mortem?"</p>

  <p>"As to the post mortem, the arsenic which was found in the stomach was not
  recognized as being in the form of Fowler's Solution, and as to the analysts,
  they made their examination three days after the man died."</p>

  <p>"Still, the medicine that they analysed was the medicine that deceased had
  taken. You don't deny that, do you?"</p>

  <p>"I neither deny it nor affirm it. I merely say that no evidence was given
  that proved the presence of Fowler's Solution in that bottle before the man
  died; and that the bottle which was handed to the analysts was one that had
  been exposed for three days in a room which had been visited by a number of
  persons, including Mrs Monkhouse, Wallingford, Miss Norris, Mabel Withers,
  Amos Monkhouse, Dr Dimsdale and yourself."</p>

  <p>"You mean to suggest that the bottle might have been tampered with or
  changed for another? But, my dear Thorndyke, why in the name of God should
  anyone want to change the bottle?"</p>

  <p>"I am not suggesting that the bottle actually was changed. I am merely
  pointing out that the evidence of the analysts is material only subject to
  the conditions that the bottle which they examined was the bottle from which
  the last dose of medicine was given, and that its contents were the same as
  on that occasion; and that no conclusive proof exists that it was the same
  bottle or that the contents were unchanged."</p>

  <p>"But what reason could there be for supposing that it might have been
  changed?"</p>

  <p>"There is no need to advance any reason. The burden of proof lies on those
  who affirm that it was the same bottle with the same contents. It is for them
  to prove that no change was possible. But obviously a change was
  possible."</p>

  <p>"But still," I persisted, "there seems to be no point in this suggestion.
  Who could have had any motive for making a change? And what could the motive
  have been? It looks to me like mere logic-chopping and hair-splitting."</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't say that if you were for the defence," chuckled Thorndyke.
  "You would not let a point of first-rate importance pass on a mere
  assumption, no matter how probable. And as to a possible motive, surely a
  most obvious one is staring us in the face. Supposing some person in this
  household had been administering arsenic in the food. If it could be arranged
  that a poisonous dose could be discovered in the medicine, you must see that
  the issue would be at once transferred from the food to the medicine, and
  from those who controlled the food to those who controlled the medicine.
  Which is, in fact, what happened. As soon as the jury heard about the
  medicine, their interest in the food became extinct."</p>

  <p>I listened to this exposition with a slightly sceptical smile. It was all
  very ingenious but I found it utterly unconvincing.</p>

  <p>"You ought to be pleading in court, Thorndyke," I said, "instead of
  grubbing about in empty houses and raking over rubbish-heaps. By the way,
  have you found anything that seems likely to yield any suggestions?"</p>

  <p>"It is a little difficult to say," he replied. "I have taken possession of
  a number of bottles and small jars for examination as to their contents, but
  I have no great expectation in respect of them. I also found some fragments
  of the glass mortar&mdash;an eight-ounce mortar it appears to have been."</p>

  <p>"Where did you find those?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"In Miss Norris' bedroom, in a little pile of rubbish under the grate.
  They are only tiny fragments, but the curvature enables one to reconstruct
  the vessel pretty accurately."</p>

  <p>It seemed to me a rather futile proceeding, but I made no comment. Nor did
  I give utterance to a suspicion which had just flashed into my mind, that it
  was the discovery of these ridiculous fragments of glass that had set my
  learned friend splitting straws on the subject of the medicine bottle. I had
  not much liked his suggestion as to the possible motive of that hypothetical
  substitution, and I liked it less now that he had discovered the remains of
  the mortar in Madeline's room. There was no doubt that Thorndyke had a
  remarkable constructive imagination; and, as I followed him down the stairs
  and out into the square, I found myself faintly uneasy lest that lively
  imagination should carry him into deeper waters than I was prepared to
  navigate in his company.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; RUPERT MAKES SOME DISCOVERIES</h2>

  <p class="first">BY a sort of tacit understanding Thorndyke and I parted in
  the vicinity of South Kensington Station, to which he had made a bee line on
  leaving the square. As he had made no suggestion that I should go back with
  him, I inferred that he had planned a busy evening examining and testing the
  odds and ends that he had picked up in the empty house; while I had suddenly
  conceived the idea that I might as well take the opportunity of calling on
  Madeline, who might feel neglected if I failed to put in an appearance within
  a reasonable time after my return to town. Our researches had taken up most
  of the afternoon and it was getting on for the hour at which Madeline usually
  left the school; and as the latter was less than half-an-hour's walk from the
  station, I could reach it in good time without hurrying.</p>

  <p>As I walked at an easy pace through the busily populated streets, I turned
  over the events of the afternoon with rather mixed feelings. In spite of my
  great confidence in Thorndyke, I was sensible of a chill of disappointment in
  respect alike of his words and his deeds. In this rather farcical grubbing
  about in the dismantled house there was a faint suggestion of charlatanism;
  of the vulgar, melodramatic sleuth, nosing out a trail; while, as to his
  hair-splitting objections to a piece of straightforward evidence, they seemed
  to me to be of the kind at which the usual hard-headed judge would shake his
  hard head while grudgingly allowing them as technically admissible.</p>

  <p>But whither was Thorndyke drifting? Evidently he had turned a dubious eye
  on Wallingford; and that egregious ass seemed to be doing all that he could
  to attract further notice. But today I had seemed to detect a note of
  suspicion in regard to Madeline; and even making allowance for the fact that
  he had not my knowledge of her gentle, gracious personality, I could not but
  feel a little resentful. Once more, Wallingford's remarks concerning a
  possible mare's nest and a public scandal recurred to me, and, not for the
  first time, I was aware of faint misgivings as to my wisdom in having set
  Thorndyke to stir up these troubled waters. He had, indeed, given me fair
  warning, and I was half-inclined to regret that I had not allowed myself to
  be warned off. Of course, Thorndyke was much too old a hand to launch a
  half-prepared prosecution into the air. But still, I could not but ask myself
  uneasily whither his overacute inferences were leading him.</p>

  <p>These reflections brought me to the gate of the school, where I learned
  from the porter that Madeline had not yet left and accordingly sent up my
  card. In less than a minute she appeared, dressed in her out-of-door clothes
  and wreathed in smiles, looking, I thought, very charming.</p>

  <p>"How nice of you, Rupert!" she exclaimed, "to come and take me home. I was
  wondering how soon you would come to see my little spinster lair. It is only
  a few minutes' walk from here. But I am sorry I didn't know you were coming,
  for I have arranged to make a call&mdash;a business call&mdash;and I am due
  in about ten minutes. Isn't it a nuisance?"</p>

  <p>"How long will you have to stay?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, a quarter of an hour, at least. Perhaps a little more."</p>

  <p>"Very well. I will wait outside for you and do sentry-go."</p>

  <p>"No, you won't. I shall let you into my flat&mdash;I should have to pass
  it&mdash;and you can have a wash and brush-up, and then you can prowl about
  and see how you like my little mansion&mdash;I haven't quite settled down in
  it yet, but you must overlook that. By the time you have inspected
  everything, I shall be back and then we can consider whether we will have a
  late tea or an early supper. This is the way."</p>

  <p>She led me into a quiet by-street, one side of which was occupied by a
  range of tall, rather forbidding buildings whose barrack-like aspect was to
  some extent mitigated by signs of civilized humanity in the tastefully
  curtained windows. Madeline's residence was on the second floor, and when she
  had let me in by the diminutive outer door and switched on the light, she
  turned back to the staircase with a wave of her hand.</p>

  <p>"I will be back as soon as I can," she said. "Meanwhile go in and make
  yourself at home."</p>

  <p>I stood at the door and watched her trip lightly down the stairs until she
  disappeared round the angle, when I shut the door and proceeded to follow her
  injunctions to the letter by taking possession of the bathroom, in which I
  was gratified to find a constant supply of hot water. When I had refreshed
  myself by a wash, I went forth and made a leisurely survey of the little
  flat. It was all very characteristic of Madeline, the professional exponent
  of Domestic Economy, in its orderly arrangement and its evidences of
  considered convenience. The tiny kitchen reminded one of a chemical
  laboratory or a doctor's dispensary with its labelled jars of the cook's
  materials set out in ordered rows on their shelves, and the two little
  mortars, one of Wedgewood ware and the other of glass. I grinned as my eye
  lighted on this latter and I thought of the fragments carefully collected by
  Thorndyke and solemnly transported to the Temple for examination. Here, if he
  could have seen it, was evidence that proved the ownership of that other
  mortar and at the same time demolished the significance of that
  discovery.</p>

  <p>I ventured to inspect the bedroom, and a very trim, pleasant little room
  it was; but the feature which principally attracted my attention was an
  arrangement for switching the electric light off and on from the bed&mdash;an
  arrangement suspiciously correlated to a small set of bookshelves also within
  easy reach of the bed. What interested me in it was what Thorndyke would have
  called its "unmechanical ingenuity"; for it consisted of no more than a
  couple of lengths of stout string, of each of which one end was tied to the
  light-switch and the other end led by a pair of screw-eyes to the head of the
  bed. No doubt the simple device worked well enough in spite of the friction
  at each screw-eye, but a man of less intelligence than Madeline would
  probably have used levers or bell-cranks, or at least pulleys to diminish the
  friction in changing the direction of the pull.</p>

  <p>There was a second bedroom, at present unoccupied and only partially
  furnished and serving, apparently, as a receptacle for such of Madeline's
  possessions as had not yet had a permanent place assigned to them. Here were
  one or two chairs, some piles of books, a number of pictures and several
  polished wood boxes and cases of various sizes; evidently the residue of the
  goods and chattels that Madeline had brought from her home and stored
  somewhere while she was living at Hilborough Square. I ran my eye along the
  range of boxes, which were set out on the top of a chest of drawers. One was
  an old-fashioned tea-caddy, another an obvious folding desk of the same
  period, while a third, which I opened, turned out to be a work-box of
  mid-Victorian age. Beside it was a little flat rosewood case which looked
  like a small case of mathematical instruments. Observing that the key was in
  the lock, I turned it and lifted the lid, not with any conscious curiosity as
  to what was inside it, but in the mere idleness of a man who has nothing in
  particular to do. But the instant that the lid was up my attention awoke with
  a bound and I stood with dropped jaw staring at the interior in utter
  consternation.</p>

  <p>There could be not an instant's doubt as to what this case was, for its
  green-baize-lined interior showed a shaped recess of the exact form of a
  pocket pistol; and, if that were not enough, there, in its own compartment
  was a little copper powder-flask, and in another compartment about a dozen
  globular bullets.</p>

  <p>I snapped down the lid and turned the key and walked guiltily out of the
  room. My interest in Madeline's flat was dead. I could think of nothing but
  this amazing discovery. And the more I thought, the more overpowering did it
  become. The pistol that fitted that case was the exact counterpart of the
  pistol that I had seen in Thorndyke's laboratory; and the case, itself,
  corresponded, exactly to his description of the case from which that pistol
  had probably been taken. It was astounding; and it was profoundly disturbing.
  For it admitted of no explanation that I could bring myself to accept other
  than that of a coincidence. And coincidences are unsatisfactory things; and
  you can't do with too many of them at once.</p>

  <p>Yet, on reflection, this was the view that I adopted. Indeed, there was no
  thinkable alternative. And really, when I came to turn the matter over, it
  was not quite so extraordinary as it had seemed at the first glance. For
  what, after all, was this pistol with its case? It was not a unique thing. It
  was not even a rare thing. Thorndyke had spoken of these pistols and cases as
  comparatively common things with which he expected me to be familiar.
  Thousands of them must have been made in their time, and since they were far
  from perishable, thousands of them must still exist. The singularity of the
  coincidence was not in the facts; it was the product of my own state of
  mind.</p>

  <p>Thus I sought&mdash;none too successfully&mdash;to rid myself of the
  effects of the shock that I had received on raising the lid of the case; and
  I was still moodily gazing out of the sitting room window and arguing away my
  perturbation when I heard the outer door shut and a moment later Madeline
  looked into the room.</p>

  <p>"I haven't been so very long, have I?" she said, cheerily. "Now I will
  slip off my cloak and hat and we will consider what sort of meal we will
  have: or perhaps you will consider the question while I am gone."</p>

  <p>With this she flitted away; and my thoughts, passing by the problem
  submitted, involuntarily reverted to the little rosewood case in the spare
  room. But her absence was of a brevity suggesting the performance of the
  professional quick-change artist. In a minute or two I heard her approach and
  open the door; and I turned-to receive a real knock-out blow.</p>

  <p>I was so astonished and dismayed that I suppose I must have stood staring
  like a fool, for she asked in a rather disconcerted tone: "What is the
  matter, Rupert? Why are you looking at my jumper like that? Don't you like
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I stammered, "of course I do. Most certainly. Very charming.
  Very&mdash;er&mdash;becoming. I like it&mdash;er&mdash;exceedingly."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe you do," she said, doubtfully, "you looked so surprised
  when I first came in. You don't think the colour too startling, do you? Women
  wear brighter colours than they used to, you know, and I do think this
  particular shade of green is rather nice. And it is rather unusual, too."</p>

  <p>"It is," I agreed, recovering myself by an effort. "Quite distinctive."
  And then, noting that I had unconsciously adopted Thorndyke's own expression,
  I added, hastily, "And I shouldn't describe it as startling, at all. It is in
  perfectly good taste."</p>

  <p>"I am glad you think that," she said, "for you certainly did look rather
  startled at first, and I had some slight misgivings about it myself when I
  had finished it. It looked more brilliant in colour as a garment than it did
  in the form of mere skeins."</p>

  <p>"You made it yourself, then?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But I don't think I would ever knit another. It took me months to
  do, and I could have bought one for very little more than the cost of the
  wool, though, of course, I shouldn't have been able to select the exact tint
  that I wanted. But what about our meal? Shall we call it tea or supper?"</p>

  <p>She could have called it breakfast for all I cared, so completely had this
  final shock extinguished my interest in food. But I had to make some response
  to her eager hospitality.</p>

  <p>"Let us split the difference or strike an average," I replied. "We will
  call it a 'swarry'-tea and unusual trimmings."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said she, "then you shall come to the kitchen and help. I
  will show you the raw material of the feast and you shall dictate the bill of
  fare."</p>

  <p>We accordingly adjourned to the kitchen where she fell to work on the
  preparations with the unhurried quickness that is characteristic of genuine
  efficiency, babbling pleasantly and pausing now and then to ask my advice
  (which was usually foolish and had to be blandly rejected) and treating the
  whole business with a sort of playful seriousness that was very delightful.
  And all the time I looked on in a state of mental chaos and bewilderment for
  which I can find no words. There she was, my friend, Madeline, sweet, gentle,
  feminine&mdash;the very type of gracious womanhood, and the more sweet and
  gracious by reason of these homely surroundings. For it is an appalling
  reflection, in these days of lady professors and women legislators, that to
  masculine eyes a woman never looks so dignified, so worshipful, so entirely
  desirable, as when she is occupied in the traditional activities that
  millenniums of human experience have associated with her sex. To me,
  Madeline, flitting about the immaculate little kitchen, neat-handed, perfect
  in the knowledge of her homely craft; smiling, dainty, fragile, with her
  gracefully flowing hair and the little apron that she had slipped on as a
  sort of ceremonial garment, was a veritable epitome of feminine charm. And
  yet, but a few feet away was a rosewood case that had once held a pistol; and
  even now, in Thorndyke's locked cabinet&mdash;but my mind staggered under the
  effort of thought and refused the attempt to combine and collate a set of
  images so discordant.</p>

  <p>"You are very quiet, Rupert," she said, presently, pausing to look at me.
  "What is it? I hope you haven't any special worries."</p>

  <p>"We all have our little worries, Madeline," I replied, vaguely.</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed," said she, still regarding me thoughtfully; and for the
  first time I noticed that she seemed to have aged a little since I had last
  seen her and that her face, in repose, showed traces of strain and anxiety.
  "We all have our troubles and we all try to put them on you. How did you
  think Barbara was looking?"</p>

  <p>"Extraordinarily well. I was agreeably surprised."</p>

  <p>"Yes. She is wonderful. I am full of admiration of the way she has put
  away everything connected with&mdash;with that dreadful affair. I couldn't
  have done it if I had been in her place. I couldn't have let things rest. I
  should have wanted to know."</p>

  <p>"I have no doubt that she does. We all want to know. But she can do no
  more than the rest of us. Do you ever see Wallingford now?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, dear, yes. He was inclined to be rather too attentive at first, but
  Barbara gave him a hint that spinsters who live alone don't want too many
  visits from their male friends, so now he usually comes with her."</p>

  <p>"I must bear Barbara's words of wisdom in mind," said I.</p>

  <p>"Indeed you won't!" she exclaimed. "Don't be ridiculous. Rupert. You know
  her hint doesn't apply to you. And I shouldn't have troubled about the
  proprieties in Tony's case if I had really wanted him. But I didn't, though I
  felt awfully sorry for him."</p>

  <p>"Yes, he seems to be in a bad way mentally, poor devil. Of course you have
  heard about his delusions?"</p>

  <p>"If they really are delusions, but I am not at all sure that they are. Now
  help me to carry these things into the sitting room and then I will do the
  omelette and bring it in."</p>

  <p>I obediently took up the tray and followed her into the sitting room,
  where I completed the arrangement of the table while she returned to the
  kitchen to perform the crowning culinary feat. In a minute or two she came in
  with the product under a heated cover and we took our seats at the table.</p>

  <p>"You were speaking of Wallingford," said I. "Apparently you know more
  about him than I do. It seemed to me that he was stark mad."</p>

  <p>"He is queer enough, I must admit&mdash;don't let your omelette get
  cold&mdash;but I think you and Barbara are mistaken about his delusions. I
  suspect that somebody is really keeping him under observation; and if that is
  so, one can easily understand why his nerves are so upset."</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed. But when you say you suspect that we are mistaken, what does
  that mean? Is it just a pious opinion or have you something to go upon?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I shouldn't offer a mere pious opinion to a learned counsel," she
  replied, with a smile. "I have something to go upon, and I will tell you
  about it, though I expect you will think I am stark mad, too. The fact is
  that I have been under observation, too."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense, Madeline," I exclaimed. "The thing is absurd. You have let
  Wallingford infect you."</p>

  <p>"There!" she retorted. '"What did I say? You think I am qualifying for an
  asylum now. But I am not. Absurd as the thing seems&mdash;and I quite agree
  with you on that point&mdash;it is an actual fact. I haven't the slightest
  doubt about it."</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, "I am open to conviction. But let us have your actual
  facts. How long do you think it has been going on?"</p>

  <p>"That I can't say; and I don't think it is going on now at all. At any
  rate, I have seen no signs of any watcher for more than a week, and I keep a
  pretty sharp lookout. The way I first became aware of it was this: I happened
  one day at lunch time to be looking out of this window through the chink in
  the curtains when I saw a man pass along slowly on the other side of the
  street and glance up, as it seemed, at this window. I didn't notice him
  particularly, but still I did look at him when he glanced up, and of course,
  his face was then directly towards me. Now it happened that, a few minutes
  afterwards, I looked out again; and then I saw what looked like the same man
  pass along again, at the same slow pace and in the same direction. And again
  he looked up at the window, though he couldn't have seen me because I was
  hidden by the curtain. But this time I looked at him very closely and made
  careful mental notes of his clothing, his hat and his features, because, you
  see, I remembered what Tony had said and I hadn't forgotten the way I was
  treated at the inquest or the way in which that detective man had turned out
  my cupboard when he came to search the house. So I looked this man over very
  carefully indeed so that I should recognize him without any doubt if I should
  see him again.</p>

  <p>"Well, before I went out after lunch I had a good look out of the window,
  but I couldn't see anything of him; nor did I see him on my way to the
  school, though I stopped once or twice and looked back. When I got to the
  school I stopped at the gate and looked along the street both ways, but still
  there was no sign of him. Then I ran up to a class-room window from which I
  could see up and down the street; and presently I saw him coming along slowly
  on the school side and I was able to check him off point by point, and though
  he didn't look up this time, I could see his face and check that off, too.
  There was no doubt whatever that it was the same man.</p>

  <p>"When I came out of school that afternoon I looked round but could not see
  him, so I walked away quickly in the direction that I usually take when going
  home, but suddenly turned a corner and slipped into a shop. I stayed there a
  few minutes buying some things, then I came out, and, seeing no one, slipped
  round the corner and took my usual way home but kept carefully behind a man
  and a woman who were going the same way. I hadn't gone very far before I saw
  my man standing before a shop window but evidently looking up and down the
  street. I was quite close to him before he saw me and of course I did not
  appear to notice him; but I hurried home without looking round and ran
  straight up to this window to watch for him. And sure enough, in about a
  couple of minutes I saw him come down the street and walk slowly past."</p>

  <p>"And did you see him again after that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I saw him twice more that same day. I went out for a walk in the
  evening on purpose to give him a lead. And I saw him from time to time every
  day for about ten days. Then I missed him, and I haven't seen a sign of him
  for more than a week. I suppose he found me too monotonous and gave me
  up."</p>

  <p>"It is very extraordinary," I said, convinced against my will by her very
  circumstantial description. "What possible object could anyone have in
  keeping a watch on you?"</p>

  <p>"That is what I have wondered," said she. "But I suppose the police have
  to do something for their pay."</p>

  <p>"But this doesn't quite look like a police proceeding. There is something
  rather feeble and amateurish about the affair. With all due respect to your
  powers of observation, Madeline, I don't think a Scotland Yard man would have
  let himself be spotted quite so easily."</p>

  <p>"But who else could it be?" she objected; and then, after a pause, she
  added with a mischievous smile, "unless it should be your friend, Dr
  Thorndyke. That would really be a quaint situation&mdash;if I should, after
  all, be indebted to you, Rupert, for these polite attentions."</p>

  <p>I brushed the suggestion aside hastily but with no conviction. And once
  more I recalled Wallingford's observations on mare's nests. Obviously this
  clumsy booby was not a professional detective. And if not, what could he be
  but some hired agent of Thorndyke's? It was one more perplexity, and added to
  those with which my mind was already charged, it reduced me to moody silence
  which must have made me the very reverse of an exhilarating companion.
  Indeed, when Madeline had rallied me once or twice on my gloomy
  preoccupation, I felt that the position was becoming untenable. I wanted to
  be alone and think things out; but as it would have been hardly decent to
  break up our little party and take my departure, I determined, if possible,
  to escape from this oppressive tete-a-tete. Fortunately, I remembered that a
  famous pianist was giving a course of recitals at a hall within easy walking
  distance and ventured to suggest that we might go and hear him.</p>

  <p>"I would rather stay here and gossip with you," she replied, "but as you
  don't seem to be in a gossiping humour, perhaps the music might be rather
  nice. Yes, let us go. I don't often hear any good music nowadays."</p>

  <p>Accordingly we went, and on the way to the hall Madeline gave me a few
  further details of her experiences with her follower; and I was not a little
  impressed by her wariness and the ingenuity with which she had lured that
  guileless sleuth into exposed and well-lighted situations.</p>

  <p>"By the way," said I, "what was the fellow like? Give me a few particulars
  of his appearance in case I should happen to run across him."</p>

  <p>"Good Heavens, Rupert!" she exclaimed, laughing mischievously, "you don't
  suppose he will take to haunting you, do you? That would really be the last
  straw, especially if he should happen to be employed by Dr Thorndyke."</p>

  <p>"It would," I admitted with a faint grin, "though Thorndyke is extremely
  thorough and he plumes himself on keeping an open mind. At any rate, let us
  have a few details."</p>

  <p>"There was nothing particularly startling about him. He was a medium-sized
  man, rather fair, with a longish, sharp, turned-up nose and a sandy
  moustache, rather bigger than men usually have nowadays. He was dressed in a
  blue serge suit, without an overcoat and he wore a brown soft felt hat, a
  turn-down collar and a dark green necktie with white spots. He had no gloves
  but he carried a walking-stick&mdash;a thickish yellow cane with a crooked
  handle."</p>

  <p>"Not very distinctive," I remarked, disparagingly.</p>

  <p>"Don't you think so?" said she. "I thought he was rather easy to recognize
  with that brown hat and the blue suit and the big moustache and pointed nose.
  Of course, if he had worn a scarlet hat and emerald-green trousers and
  carried a brass fire-shovel instead of a walking-stick he would have been
  still easier to recognize; but you mustn't expect too much, even from a
  detective."</p>

  <p>I looked with dim surprise into her smiling face and was more bewildered
  than ever. If she were haunted by any gnawing anxieties, she had a wonderful
  way of throwing them off. Nothing could be less suggestive of a guilty
  conscience than this quiet gaiety and placid humour. However, there was no
  opportunity for moralizing, for her little retort had brought us to the door
  of the hall; and we had barely time to find desirable seats before the
  principal musician took his place at the instrument.</p>

  <p>It was a delightful entertainment; and if the music did not "soothe my
  savage breast" into complete forgetfulness, it occupied my attention
  sufficiently to hinder consecutive thought on any other subject. Indeed, it
  was not until I had said "good night" to Madeline outside her flat and turned
  my face towards the neighbouring station that I was able to attempt a
  connected review of the recent startling discoveries.</p>

  <p>What could they possibly mean? The pistol alone could have been argued
  away as a curious coincidence, and the same might have been possible even in
  the case of the wool. But the two together! The long arm of coincidence was
  not long enough for that. The wisp of wool that we had found in the empty
  house was certainly&mdash;admittedly&mdash;Madeline's. But that wisp matched
  identically the ball of wool from the pistol; and here was a missing pistol
  which was certainly the exact counterpart of that which had contained the
  wool plug. The facts could not be disputed. Was it possible to escape from
  the inferences which they yielded?</p>

  <p>The infernal machine, feeble as it was, gave evidence of a diabolical
  intention&mdash;an intention that my mind utterly refused to associate with
  Madeline. And yet, even in the moment of rejection, my memory suddenly
  recalled the arrangement connected with the electric light switch in
  Madeline's bedroom. Its mechanism was practically identical with that of the
  infernal machine, and the materials used&mdash;string and
  screw-eyes&mdash;were actually the same. It seemed impossible to escape from
  this proof piled on proof.</p>

  <p>But if the machine itself declared an abominable intention, what of that
  which lay behind the machine? The sending of that abomination was not an
  isolated or independent act. It was related to some antecedent act, as
  Thorndyke had implied. Whoever sent it, had a guilty conscience.</p>

  <p>But guilty of what?</p>

  <p>As I asked myself this question, and the horrid, inevitable answer framed
  itself in my mind, I turned automatically from Middle Temple Lane and passed
  into the deep shadow of the arch that gives entrance to Elm Court.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14"></a>XIV. &mdash; RUPERT CONFIDES IN THORNDYKE</h2>

  <p class="first">ALTHOUGH few of its buildings (excepting the Halls) are of
  really great antiquity, the precinct of the Temples shares with the older
  parts of London at least one medieval characteristic: it abounds in those
  queer little passages and alleys which, burrowing in all directions under the
  dwelling-houses, are a source of endless confusion and bewilderment to the
  stranger, though to the accustomed denizen they offer an equally great
  convenience. For by their use the seasoned Templar makes his way from any one
  part of the precinct to any other, if not in an actual bee-line, at least in
  an abbreviated zig-zag that cuts across the regular thoroughfares as though
  they were mere paths traversing an open meadow. Some of these alleys do,
  indeed, announce themselves even to unaccustomed eyes, as public
  passage-ways, by recognizable entrance arches; but many of them scorn even
  this degree of publicity, artfully concealing their existence from the
  uninitiated by an ordinary doorway, which they share with a pair of houses.
  Whereby the unsuspecting stranger, entering what, in his innocence, he
  supposes to be the front doorway of a house, walks along the hall and is
  presently astonished to find himself walking out of another front door into
  another thoroughfare.</p>

  <p>The neighbourhood of Fig Tree Court is peculiarly rich in these deceptive
  burrows, indeed, excepting from the Terrace, it has no other avenue of
  approach. On the present occasion I had the choice of two, and was proceeding
  along the narrow lane of Elm Court to take the farther one, which led to the
  entry of my chambers, when I caught sight of a man approaching hurriedly from
  the direction of the Cloisters. At the first glance, I thought I recognized
  him&mdash;though he was a mere silhouette in the dim light&mdash;as the
  loiterer whom I had seen on the night of my return. And his behaviour
  confirmed my suspicion; for as he came in sight of me, he hesitated for a
  moment and then, quickening his pace forward, disappeared suddenly through
  what appeared to be a hole in the wall but was, in fact, the passage for
  which I was making.</p>

  <p>Instantly, I turned back and swiftly crossing the square of Elm Court,
  dived into the burrow at its farther corner and came out into the little
  square of Fig Tree Court at the very moment when the mysterious stranger
  emerged from the burrow at the other side, so that we met face to face in the
  full light of the central lamp.</p>

  <p>Naturally, I was the better prepared for the encounter and I pursued my
  leisurely way towards my chambers with the air of not having observed him;
  while he, stopping short for a moment with a wild stare at me, dashed across
  the square and plunged into the passage from which I had just emerged.</p>

  <p>I did not follow him. I had seen him and had thereby confirmed a suspicion
  that had been growing upon me, and that was enough. For I need hardly say
  that the man was Anthony Wallingford. But though I was prepared for the
  identification, I was none the less puzzled and worried by it. Here was yet
  another perplexity; and I was just stepping into my entry to reflect upon it
  at my leisure when I became aware of hurrying footsteps in the passage
  through which Wallingford had come. Quickly drawing back into the deep shadow
  of the vestibule, I waited to see who this new-comer might be. In a few
  seconds he rushed out of the passage and came to a halt in the middle of the
  square, nearly under the lamp, where he stood for a few moments, looking to
  right and left and listening intently. And now I realized the justice of what
  Madeline had said; for, commonplace as the man was, I recognized him in an
  instant. Brown hat, blue serge suit, big, sandy moustache and concave,
  pointed nose; they were not sensational characteristics, but they identified
  him beyond a moment's doubt.</p>

  <p>Apparently, his ear must have caught the echoes of Wallingford's
  footsteps, for, after a very brief pause, he started off at something
  approaching a trot and disappeared into the passage by which I had come and
  Wallingford had gone. A sudden, foolish curiosity impelled me to follow and
  observe the methods of this singular and artless sleuth. But I did not follow
  directly. Instead, I turned and ran up the other passage, which leads into
  the narrow part of Elm Court; and as I came flying out of the farther end of
  it I ran full tilt into a man who was running along the court towards the
  Cloisters. Of course the man was Wallingford. Who else would be running like
  a lunatic through the Temple at night, unless it were his pursuer?</p>

  <p>With muttered curses but no word of recognition, he disengaged himself and
  pursued his way, disappearing at length round the sharp turn in the lane
  which leads towards the Cloisters. I did not follow him, but drew back into
  the dark passage and waited. Very soon another figure became visible,
  approaching rapidly along the dimly lighted lane. I drew farther back and
  presently from my hiding-place I saw the brown-hatted shadower steal past
  with a ridiculous air of secrecy and caution; and when he had passed, I
  peered out and watched his receding figure until it disappeared round the
  angle of the lane.</p>

  <p>I felt half-tempted to join the absurd procession and see what eventually
  became of these two idiots. But I had really seen enough. I now knew that
  Wallingford's "delusions" were no delusions at all and that Madeline's story
  set forth nothing but the genuine, indisputable truth. And with these new
  facts to add to my unwelcome store of data, I walked slowly back to my
  chambers, cogitating as I went.</p>

  <p>In truth, I had abundant material for reflection. The more I turned over
  my discoveries in Madeline's flat the more did the incriminating evidence
  seem to pile up. I recalled Polton's plainly expressed suspicion that the
  sender of the infernal machine was a woman; and I recalled Thorndyke's
  analysis of the peculiarities of the thing with the inferences which those
  peculiarities suggested, and read into them a more definite meaning. I now
  saw what the machine had conveyed to him, and what he had been trying to make
  it convey to me. The unmechanical outlook combined with evident ingenuity,
  the unfamiliarity with ordinary mechanical appliances, the ignorance
  concerning the different kinds of gun-powder, the lack of those common tools
  which nearly every man, but hardly any woman, possesses and can use: all
  these peculiarities of the unknown person were feminine peculiarities. And
  finally, there had been the plug of knitting-wool: a most unlikely material
  for a man to use for such a purpose, or, indeed, to possess at all.</p>

  <p>So my thoughts went over and over the same ground, and every time finding
  escape from the obvious conclusion more and more impossible. The evidence of
  Madeline's complicity&mdash;at the very least&mdash;in the sending of the
  infernal machine appeared overwhelming. I could not reject it. Nor could I
  deny what the sending of it implied. It was virtually a confession of guilt.
  And yet, even as I admitted this to myself, I was strangely enough aware that
  my feelings towards Madeline remained unaltered. The rational, legal side of
  me condemned her. But somehow, in some incomprehensible way, that
  condemnation had a purely technical, academic quality. It left my loyalty and
  affection for her untouched.</p>

  <p>But what of Thorndyke? Had his reasoning travelled along the same lines?
  If it had, there would be nothing sentimental in his attitude. He had warned
  me, and I knew well enough that whenever there should be evidence enough to
  put before a court, the law would be set in motion. What, then, was his
  present position? And even as I asked myself the question, there echoed
  uncomfortably in my mind the significant suggestion that he had thrown out
  only a few hours ago concerning the bottle of medicine. Evidently, he at
  least entertained the possibility that the Fowler's Solution had been put
  into that bottle after Monkhouse's death, and that for the express purpose of
  diverting suspicion from the food. The manifest implication was that he
  entertained the possibility that the poison had been administered in the
  food. But to suspect this was to suspect the person who prepared the food of
  being the poisoner. And the person who prepared the food was Madeline.</p>

  <p>The question, therefore, as to Thorndyke's state of mind was a vital one.
  He had expressed no suspicion of Madeline. But then he had expressed no
  suspicion of anybody. On the other hand, he had exonerated nobody. He was
  frankly observant of every member of that household. Then there was the
  undeniable fact that Madeline had been watched and followed. Somebody
  suspected her. But who? The watcher was certainly not a detective. Amateur
  was writ large all over him. Then it was not the police who suspected her.
  Apparently there remained only Thorndyke, though one would have expected him
  to employ a more efficient agent.</p>

  <p>But Wallingford was also under observation, and more persistently. Then
  he, too, was suspected. But here there was some show of reason. For what was
  Wallingford doing in the Temple? Evidently he had been lurking about,
  apparently keeping a watch on Thorndyke, though for what purpose I could not
  imagine. Still, it was a suspicious proceeding and justified some watch being
  kept on him. But the shadowing of Madeline was incomprehensible.</p>

  <p>I paced up and down my sitting room turning these questions over in my
  mind and all the time conscious of a curious sense of unreality in the whole
  affair; in all this watching and following and dodging which looked so
  grotesque and purposeless. I felt myself utterly bewildered. But I was also
  profoundly unhappy and, indeed, overshadowed by a terrible dread. For out of
  this chaos one fact emerged clearly: there was a formidable body of evidence
  implicating Madeline. If Thorndyke had known what I knew, her position would
  have been one of the gravest peril. My conscience told me that it was my duty
  to tell him; and I knew that I had no intention of doing anything of the
  kind. But still the alarming question haunted me: how much did he really
  know? How much did he suspect?</p>

  <p>In the course of my perambulations I passed and repassed a smallish deed
  box which stood on a lower book-shelf and which was to me what the Ark of the
  Covenant was to the ancient Israelites: the repository of my most sacred
  possessions. Its lid bore the name "Stella," painted on it by me, and its
  contents were a miscellany of trifles, worthless intrinsically, but to me
  precious beyond all price as relics of the dear friend who had been all in
  all to me during her short life and who, though she had been lying in her
  grave for four long years, was all in all to me still. Often, in the long,
  solitary evenings, had I taken the relics out of their abiding-place and let
  the sight of them carry my thoughts back to the golden days of our happy
  companionship, filling in the pleasant pictures with the aid of my
  diary&mdash;but that was unnecessary now, since I knew the entries by
  heart&mdash;and painting other, more shadowy, pictures of a future that might
  have been. It was a melancholy pleasure, perhaps, but yet, as the years
  rolled on, the bitterness of those memories grew less bitter and still the
  sweet remained.</p>

  <p>Presently, as for the hundredth time the beloved name met my eye, there
  came upon me a yearning to creep back with her into the sunny past; to
  forget, if only for a short hour, the hideous anxieties of the present and in
  memory to walk with her once more "along the meads of asphodel."</p>

  <p>Halting before the box, I stood and lifted it tenderly to the table and
  having unlocked it, raised the lid and looked thoughtfully into the interior.
  Then, one by one, I lifted out my treasures, set them out in order on the
  table, and sat down to look at them and let them speak to me their message of
  peace and consolation.</p>

  <p>To a stranger's eye they were a mere collection of odds and ends. Some
  would have been recognizable as relics of the more conventional type. There
  were several photographs of the dead girl, some taken by myself, and a tress
  of red-gold hair&mdash;such hair as I had been told often glorifies the
  victims whom consumption had marked for its own. It had been cut off for me
  by Barbara when she took her own tress, and tied up with a blue ribbon. But
  it was not these orthodox relics that spoke to me most intimately. I had no
  need of their aid to call up the vision of her person. The things that set my
  memory working were the records of actions and experiences; the sketch-books,
  the loose sketches and the little plaster plaques and medallions that she had
  made with my help after she had become bed-ridden and could go no more abroad
  to sketch. Every one of these had its story to tell, its vision to call
  up.</p>

  <p>I turned over the sketches&mdash;simple but careful pencil drawings for
  the most part, for Stella, like me, had more feeling for form than for
  colour&mdash;and recalled the making of them; the delightful rambles across
  the sunny meadows or through the cool woodlands, the solemn planting of
  sketching-stools and earnest consultation on the selection and composition of
  the subjects. These were the happiest days, before the chilly hand of the
  destroyer had been laid on its chosen victim and there was still a long and
  sunny future to be vaguely envisaged.</p>

  <p>And then I turned to the little plaques and medallions which she had
  modelled under my supervision and of which I had made the plaster moulds and
  casts. These called up sadder memories, but yet they spoke of an even closer
  and more loving companionship; for each work was, in a way, a joint
  achievement over which we had triumphed and rejoiced together. So it happened
  that, although the shadow of sickness, and at last of death, brooded over
  them, it was on these relics that I tended to linger most lovingly.</p>

  <p>Here was the slate that I had got for her to stick the clay on and which
  she used to hold propped up against her knees as she worked with
  never-failing enthusiasm through the long, monotonous days, and even, when
  she was well enough, far into the night by the light of the shaded candle.
  Here were the simple modelling-tools and the little sponge and the camelhair
  brush with which she loved to put the final finish on the damp clay reliefs.
  Here was Lanterri's priceless textbook over which we used to pore together
  and laud that incomparable teacher. Here were the plaques, medals and
  medallions that we had prised out, with bated breath, from their too-adherent
  moulds. And here&mdash;the last and saddest relic-was the wax mould from
  which no cast had ever been made, the final, crowning work of those deft,
  sensitive fingers.</p>

  <p>For the thousandth time, I picked it up and let the light fall obliquely
  across its hollows. The work was a medal some three inches across, a portrait
  of Stella, herself, modelled from a profile photograph that I had taken for
  the purpose. It was an excellent likeness and unquestionably the best piece
  of modelling that she had ever done.</p>

  <p>Often, I had intended to take the cast from it, but always had been
  restrained by a vague reluctance to disturb the mould. Now, as I looked at
  the delicate, sunken impression, I had again the feeling that this, her last
  work, ought to be finished; and I was still debating the matter with the
  mould in my hand when I heard a quick step upon the stair, followed by a
  characteristic knock on my door.</p>

  <p>My first impulse was to hustle my treasures back into their box before
  answering the summons. But this was almost instantly followed by a revulsion.
  I recognized the knock as Thorndyke's; and somehow there came upon me a
  desire to share my memories with him. He had shown a strangely sympathetic
  insight into my feelings towards Stella. He had read my diary. He now knew
  the whole story; and he was the kindest, the most loyal and most discreet of
  friends. Gently laying down the mould I went to the door and threw it
  open.</p>

  <p>"I saw your light burning as I passed just now," said Thorndyke as he
  entered and shook my hand warmly, "so I thought I would take the opportunity
  to drop in and return your diary. I hope I am not disturbing you. If I am,
  you must treat me as a friend and eject me."</p>

  <p>"Not at all, Thorndyke," I replied. "On the contrary, you would be doing
  me a charity if you would stay and smoke a companionable pipe."</p>

  <p>"Good," said he, "then I will give myself the pleasure of a quiet gossip.
  But what is amiss, Mayfield?" he continued, laying a friendly hand on my
  shoulder and looking me over critically. "You look worn, and worried and
  depressed. You are not letting your mind dwell too much, I hope, on the
  tragedy that has come unbidden into your life?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I am," I replied. "The horrible affair haunts me. Suspicion
  and mystery are in the very air I breathe. A constant menace seems to hang
  over all my friends, so that I am in continual dread of some new catastrophe.
  I have just ascertained that Wallingford is really being watched and
  shadowed; and not only Wallingford but even Miss Norris."</p>

  <p>He did not appear surprised or seek for further information. He merely
  nodded and looked into my face with grave sympathy.</p>

  <p>"Put it away, Mayfield," said he. "That is my counsel to you. Try to
  forget it. You have put the investigation into my hands. Leave it there and
  wash your own of it. You did not kill Harold Monkhouse. Whoever did must pay
  the penalty if ever the crime should be brought home to the perpetrator. And
  if it never can be, it were better that you and all of us should let it sink
  into oblivion rather than allow it to remain to poison the lives of innocent
  persons. Let us forget it now. I see you were trying to."</p>

  <p>I had noticed that when he first entered the room, he cast a single, swift
  glance at the table which, I was sure, had comprehended every object on it.
  Then he had looked away and never again let his eyes stray in that direction.
  But now, as he finished speaking, he glanced once more at the table, and this
  time with undisguised interest.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I admitted. "I was trying to find in the memories of the past an
  antidote for the present. These are the relics of that past. I daresay you
  have read of them in the diary and probably have written me down a mawkish
  sentimentalist."</p>

  <p>"I pray you, my friend, not to do me that injustice!" he exclaimed.
  "Faithful friendship, that even survives the grave, is not a thing that any
  man can afford to despise. But for the disaster of untimely death, your
  faithfulness and hers would have created for two persons the perfect life. I
  assure you, Mayfield, that I have been deeply moved by the story of your
  delightful friendship and your irreparable loss. But don't let us dwell too
  much on the sad aspects of the story. Show me your relics. I see some very
  charming little plaques among them."</p>

  <p>He picked up one with reassuring daintiness of touch and examined it
  through a reading-glass that I handed to him.</p>

  <p>"It really is a most admirable little work," said he. "Not in the least
  amateurish. She had the makings of a first-class medallist; the appreciation
  of the essential qualities of a miniature relief. And she had a fine feeling
  for composition and spacing."</p>

  <p>Deeply gratified by his appreciation and a little surprised by his evident
  knowledge of the medallist's art, I presented the little works, one after
  another, and we discussed their merits with the keenest interest. Presently
  he asked: "Has it never occurred to you, Mayfield, that these charming little
  works ought to be finished?"</p>

  <p>"Finished?" I repeated. "But, aren't they finished?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not. They are only on the plaster. But a plaster cast is an
  intermediate form. Just a mere working model. It is due to the merits of
  these plaques and medals that they should be put into permanent
  material&mdash;silver or copper or bronze. I'll tell you what, Mayfield," he
  continued, enthusiastically. "You shall let Polton make replicas of some of
  them&mdash;he could do it with perfect safety to the originals. Then we could
  hand the casts to an electrotyper or a founder&mdash;I should favour the
  electrotype process for such small works&mdash;and have them executed in
  whichever metal you preferred. Then you would be able to see, for the first
  time, the real quality of the modelling."</p>

  <p>I caught eagerly at the idea, but yet I was a little nervous.</p>

  <p>"You think it would be perfectly safe?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely safe. Polton would make gelatine moulds which couldn't
  possibly injure the originals."</p>

  <p>That decided me. I fell in with the suggestion enthusiastically, and
  forthwith we began an anxious consultation as to the most suitable pieces
  with which to make a beginning. We had selected half a dozen casts when my
  glance fell on the wax mould. That was Stella's masterpiece and it certainly
  ought to be finished; but I was loath to part with the mould for fear of an
  accident. Very dubiously, I handed it to Thorndyke and asked: "What do you
  think of this? Could it be cast without any risk of breaking it?"</p>

  <p>He laid the mould on the table before him so that the light fell obliquely
  across it and looked down on it reflectively.</p>

  <p>"So," said he, "this is the wax mould. I was reading about it only
  yesterday and admiring your resourcefulness and ingenuity. I must read the
  entry again with the actual object before me."</p>

  <p>He opened the diary, which he had laid on the table, and when he had found
  the entry, read it to himself in an undertone.</p>

  <p>"Dropped in to have tea with Stella and found her bubbling with excitement
  and triumph. She had just finished the portrait medal and though her eyes
  were red and painful from the strain of the close work, in spite of her new
  spectacles, she was quite happy and as proud as a little peacock. And well
  she might be. I should like Lanterri to see his unknown pupil's work. We
  decided to make the mould of it at once, but when I got out the plaster tin,
  I found it empty. Most unfortunate, for the clay was beginning to dry and I
  didn't dare to damp it. But something had to be done to protect it. Suddenly
  I had a brilliant idea. There was nearly a whole candle in Stella's
  candlestick, quite enough for a mould, and good, hard wax that wouldn't warp.
  I took off the reflector and lighted the candle, which I took out of the
  candlestick and held almost upside down over the clay medal and let the wax
  drip on to it. Soon the medal was covered by a film of wax which grew thicker
  and thicker, until, by the time I had used up practically the whole of the
  candle, there was a good, solid crust of wax, quite strong enough to cast
  from. When I went home, I took the slate with me with the wax mould sticking
  to it, intending to cover it with a plaster shell for extra safety. But my
  plaster tin was empty, too, so I put the slate away in a safe place until I
  should get some fresh plaster to make the cast; which will not happen until I
  get back from Chelmsford.</p>

  <p>"Busy evening getting ready for tomorrow; hope I shall feel less cheap
  then than I do now."</p>

  <p>As Thorndyke finished reading he looked up and remarked: "That was an
  excellent plan of yours. I have seen Polton use the same method. But how was
  it that you never made the cast?"</p>

  <p>"I was afraid of damaging the mould. As you know, when I came back from
  Ipswich, Stella was dead, and as the medal was her last work and her best, I
  hardly dared to risk the chance of destroying it."</p>

  <p>"Still," Thorndyke urged, "it was the medal that was her work. The mould
  was your own; and the medal exists only potentially in the mould. It will
  come into actual existence only when the cast is made."</p>

  <p>I saw the force of this, but I was still a little uneasy, and said so,</p>

  <p>"There is no occasion," said he. "The mould is amply strong enough to cast
  from. It might possibly break in separating the cast, but that would be of no
  consequence, as you would then have the cast, which would be the medal,
  itself. And it could then be put into bronze or silver."</p>

  <p>"Very well," I said, "if you guarantee the safety of the operation, I am
  satisfied. I should love to see it in silver; or perhaps it might look even
  better in gold."</p>

  <p>Having disposed of the works, themselves, we fell to discussing the
  question of suitable settings or frames; and this led us to the subject of
  the portraits. Thorndyke glanced over the collection, and picking up one,
  which happened to be my own favourite, looked at it thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"It is a beautiful face," said he, "and this seems to have been a
  singularly happy portrait. In red chalk autotype, it would make a charming
  little picture. Did you take it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; and as I have the negative I am inclined to adopt your suggestion. I
  am surprised that I never thought of it myself, for red chalk is exactly the
  right medium."</p>

  <p>"Then let Polton have the negative. He is quite an expert in autotype
  work."</p>

  <p>I accepted the offer gladly and we then came back to the question of
  framing. Thorndyke's suggestion was that the portrait should be treated as a
  medallion and enclosed in a frame to match that of the medal. The idea
  appealed to me rather strongly, and presently a further one occurred to me,
  though it was suggested indirectly by Thorndyke, who had taken up the tress
  of Stella's hair and was looking at it admiringly as he drew it softly
  between his fingers.</p>

  <p>"Human hair," he remarked, "and particularly a woman's hair, is always a
  beautiful material, no matter what its colour may be; but this red-gold
  variety is one of the most gorgeous of Nature's productions."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I agreed, "it is extremely decorative. Barbara had her tress made
  up into a thin plait and worked into the frame of a miniature of Stella. I
  liked the idea, but somehow the effect is not so very pleasing. But it is an
  oblong frame."</p>

  <p>"I don't think," said Thorndyke, "that a plait was quite the best form. A
  little cable would look better, especially for a medallion portrait; indeed I
  think that if you had a plain square black frame with a circular opening, a
  little golden cable, carried round concentrically with the opening would have
  a rather fine effect."</p>

  <p>"So it would," I exclaimed. "I think it would look charming. I had no
  idea, Thorndyke, that you were a designer. Do you think Polton could make the
  cable?"</p>

  <p>"Polton," he replied, impressively, "can do anything that can be done with
  a single pair of human hands. Let him have the hair, and he will make the
  cable and the frame, too; and he will see that the glass cover is an airtight
  fit&mdash;for, of course, the cable would have to be under the glass."</p>

  <p>To this also I agreed with a readiness that surprised myself. And yet it
  was not surprising. Hitherto I had been accustomed secretly and in solitude
  to pore over these pathetic little relics of happier days and lock up my
  sorrows and my sense of bereavement in my own breast. Now, for the first
  time, I had a confidant who shared the knowledge of my shattered hopes and
  vanished happiness; and so wholeheartedly, with such delicate sympathy and
  perfect understanding had Thorndyke entered into the story of my troubled
  life that I found in his companionship not only a relief from my old
  self-repression but a sort of subdued happiness. Almost cheerfully I fetched
  an empty cigar-box and a supply of cotton wool and tissue paper and helped
  him tenderly and delicately to pack my treasures for their first exodus from
  under my roof. And it was with only a faint twinge of regret that I saw him,
  at length, depart with the box under his arm.</p>

  <p>"You needn't be uneasy, Mayfield," he said, pausing on the stairs to look
  back. "Nothing will be injured; and as soon as the casting is successfully
  carried through, I shall drop a note in your letter-box to set your mind at
  rest. Good night."</p>

  <p>I watched him as he descended the stairs, and listened to his quick
  foot-falls, fading away up the court. Then I went back to my room with a
  faint sense of desolation to repack the depleted deed-box and thereafter to
  betake myself to bed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash; A PURSUIT AND A DISCOVERY</h2>

  <p class="first">MORE than a week had passed since that eventful
  evening&mdash;how eventful I did not then realize&mdash;when I had delivered
  my simple treasures into Thorndyke's hands. But I was not uneasy; for, within
  twenty-four hours, I had found in my letter-box the promised note, assuring
  me that the preliminary operations had been safely carried through and that
  nothing had been damaged. Nor was I impatient. I realized that Polton had
  other work than mine on hand and that there was a good deal to do. Moreover,
  a little rush of business had kept me employed and helped me to follow
  Thorndyke's counsel and forget, as well as I could, the shadow of mystery and
  peril that hung over my friends, and, by implication, over me.</p>

  <p>But on the evening of which I am now speaking I was free. I had cleared
  off the last of the day's work, and, after dining reposefully at my club,
  found myself with an hour or two to spare before bed-time; and it occurred to
  me to look in on Thorndyke to smoke a friendly pipe and perchance get a
  glimpse of the works in progress.</p>

  <p>I entered the Temple from the west, and, threading my way through the
  familiar labyrinth, crossed Tanfield Court, and passing down the narrow alley
  at its eastern side, came out into King's Bench Walk. I crossed the Walk at
  once and was sauntering down the pavement towards Thorndyke's house when I
  noticed a large, closed car drawn up at its entry, and, standing on the
  pavement by the car, a tall man whom I recognized by the lamplight as Mr
  Superintendent Miller.</p>

  <p>Now I did not much want to meet the superintendent, and in any case it was
  pretty clear to me that my visit to Thorndyke was not very opportune. The
  presence of Miller suggested business, and the size of the car suggested
  other visitors. Accordingly I slowed down and was about to turn back when my
  eye caught another phenomenon. In the entry next to Thorndyke's a man was
  standing, well back in the shadow, but not so far that he could not get a
  view of the car; on which he was quite obviously keeping a watchful eye.
  Indeed, he was so preoccupied with his observation of it that he had not
  noticed my approach, his back being turned towards me.</p>

  <p>Naturally, the watchful attitude and the object of his watchfulness
  aroused my suspicions as to his identity. But a movement backward on his part
  which brought him within range of the entry lamp, settled matter. He was
  Anthony Wallingford.</p>

  <p>I turned and walked quietly back a few paces. What was this idiot doing
  here within a few yards of Thorndyke's threshold? Was he merely spying
  fatuously and without purpose? Or was it possible that he might be up to some
  kind of mischief? As I framed the question my steps brought me opposite
  another entry. The walk was in darkness save for the few lamps and the place
  was practically deserted. After a moment's reflection, I stepped into the
  entry and decided thence to keep a watch upon the watcher.</p>

  <p>I had not long to wait. Hardly had I taken up my rather undignified
  position when three men emerged from the house and walked slowly to the car.
  By the light of the lamp above Thorndyke's entry, I could see them quite
  plainly and I recognized them all. One was Thorndyke, himself, another was Dr
  Jervis, Thorndyke's colleague, now in the employ of the Home Office, and the
  third was Dr Barnwell, well-known to me as the analyst and toxicologist to
  the Home Office. All three carried substantial bags and Dr Barnwell was
  encumbered with a large case, like an out-size suit-case, suggestive of
  chemical apparatus. While they were depositing themselves and their
  impedimenta in the car, Superintendent Miller gave directions to the driver.
  He spoke in clear, audible tones, but though (I have to confess) I listened
  intently, I caught only the question: "Do you know the way?" The words which
  preceded and followed it were just audible but not intelligible to me. It
  appeared, however, that they were intelligible to Wallingford, for, as soon
  as they were spoken and while the superintendent still held the open door of
  the car, he stepped forth from his lurking-place and walked boldly and
  rapidly across to the narrow passage by which I had come.</p>

  <p>Realizing instantly what his intention was, I came out of the entry and
  started in pursuit. As I reached the entrance to the passage, my ear caught
  the already faint sound of his receding footsteps; by which I learned that he
  was running swiftly and as silently as he could. Since I did not intend to
  lose him, I had no choice but to follow his example, and I raced across
  Tanfield Court, past the Cloisters and round by the church as if the Devil
  were after me instead of before. Half-way up Inner Temple Lane he slowed down
  to a walk&mdash;very wisely, for otherwise the night porter would certainly
  have stopped him&mdash;and was duly let out into Fleet Street, whither I
  followed him at a short interval.</p>

  <p>When I stepped out of the gate I saw him some little distance away to the
  west, giving directions to the driver of a taxi. I looked round desperately,
  and, to my intense relief, perceived an apparently empty taxi approaching
  from the east. I walked quickly towards it, signalling as I went, and the
  driver at once drew in to the kerb and stopped. I approached him, and,
  leaning forward, said in a low voice&mdash;though there was no one within
  earshot: "There is a taxi just in front. It will probably follow a big car
  which is coming up Middle Temple Lane. I want you to keep that taxi in sight,
  wherever it may go. Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>The man broke into a cynical grin&mdash;the nearest approach to geniality
  of which a taxi-driver is capable&mdash;and replied that he understood; and
  as, at this moment, the nose of the car appeared coming through the arched
  entrance gate of Middle Temple Lane, I sprang into the taxi and shut the
  door. From the off-side window, but keeping well back out of sight, I saw the
  car creep across Fleet Street, turn eastward and then sweep round into
  Chancery Lane. Almost immediately, Wallingford's taxi moved off and followed;
  and then, after a short interval, my own vehicle started, and, crossing
  directly to Chancery Lane, went ahead in the wake of the others.</p>

  <p>It was an absurd affair. Now that the pursuit was started and its conduct
  delegated for the time to the driver, I leaned back in the shadow and was
  disposed to grin a little sheepishly at my own proceedings. I had embarked on
  them in obedience to a sudden impulse without reflection&mdash;for which,
  indeed, there had been no time. But was there anything to justify me in
  keeping this watch on Wallingford? I debated the question at some length and
  finally decided that, although he was probably only playing the fool, still
  it was proper that I should see what he was really up to. Thorndyke was my
  friend and it was only right that I should stand between him and any possible
  danger. Well as he was able to take care of himself, he could not be always
  on his guard. And I could not forget the infernal machine. Someone at least
  had the will to do him an injury.</p>

  <p>But what about the brown-hatted man? Why had he not joined in this novel
  sport? Or had he? I put my head out of the window and looked along the street
  in our rear, but there was no sign of any pursuing taxi. The ridiculous
  procession was limited to three vehicles; which was just as well, since we
  did not want a police cyclist bringing up the rear.</p>

  <p>From my own proceedings my thoughts turned to those of Thorndyke and his
  companions, though they were no affair of mine, or of Wallingford's either,
  for that matter. Apparently the three men were going somewhere to make a post
  mortem examination. The presence of Dr Barnwell suggested an analysis in
  addition; and the presence of Miller hinted at a criminal case of some kind.
  But it was not my case or Wallingford's. For both of us the analyst had
  already done his worst.</p>

  <p>While I reflected, I kept an eye on the passing landmarks, checking our
  route and idly trying to forecast our destination. From Chancery Lane we
  crossed Holborn and entered Gray's Inn Road, at the bottom of which we swept
  round by King's Cross into Pancras Road. At the end of this we turned up
  Great College Street, crossed Camden Road and presently passed along the
  Kentish Town Road. So far I had noted our progress with no more than a
  languid interest. It did not matter to me whither we were going. But when, at
  the Bull and Gate, we swept round into Highgate Road, my attention awoke; and
  when the taxi turned sharply at the Duke of St Albans and entered Swain's
  Lane, I sat up with a start. In a moment of sudden enlightenment, I realized
  what our destination must be; and the realization came upon me with the
  effect of a palpable blow. This lane, with its precipitous ascent at the
  upper end, was no ordinary thoroughfare. It was little more than an approach
  to the great cemetery whose crowded areas extended on either side of it; its
  traffic was almost completely limited to the mournful processions that crept
  up to the wide gates by the mortuary chapel. Indeed, on the very last
  occasion when I had ridden up this lane, my conveyance had been the mourning
  carriage which followed poor little Stella to her last home.</p>

  <p>Before I had recovered from the shock of this discovery sufficiently to
  consider what it might mean, the taxi came to a sudden halt. I stepped out,
  and, looking up the lane, made out the shadowy form of Wallingford's vehicle,
  already backing and manoeuvring to turn round.</p>

  <p>"Bloke in front has got out," my driver announced in a hoarse whisper, and
  as he spoke, I caught sight of Wallingford&mdash;or at least of a human
  figure&mdash;lurking in the shadow of the trees by the railings on the
  right-hand side of the road. I paid off my driver (who, thereupon, backed on
  to the footway, turned and retired down the hill) and having waited for the
  other taxi to pass down, began slowly to ascend the lane, keeping in the
  shadow of the trees. Now that the two taxis were gone, Wallingford and I had
  the lane to ourselves, excepting where, in the distance ahead, the reflected
  light from the headlamps of the car made a dim halo and the shape of the
  gothic chapel loomed indistinctly against the murky sky. I could see him
  quite plainly, and no doubt he was aware of my presence; at any rate, I did
  not propose to attempt any concealment, so far as he was concerned. His
  movements had ceased to be of any interest to me. My entire concern was with
  the party ahead and with the question as to what Thorndyke was doing at this
  time of night in Highgate Cemetery.</p>

  <p>The burial ground is divided, as I have said, into two parts, which lie on
  either side of the lane; the old cemetery with its great gates and the large
  mortuary chapel, on the left or west side and the newer part on the right. To
  which of these two parts was Thorndyke bound? That was the question that I
  had to settle.</p>

  <p>I continued to advance up the lane, keeping in the shadow, though it was a
  dark night and the precaution was hardly necessary. Presently I overtook
  Wallingford and passed him without either concealment or recognition on
  either side. I could now clearly make out the gable and pinnacles of the
  chapel and saw the car turn in the wide sweep and then extinguish its
  headlights. Presently, from the gate-house there emerged a party of men of
  whom some carried lanterns, by the light of which I could recognize Thorndyke
  and his three companions; and I noted that they appeared to have left their
  cases either in the car or elsewhere for they now carried nothing. They
  lingered for a minute or two at the wicket by the great gates; then,
  accompanied by a man whom I took to be the gate-keeper, they crossed the road
  to the gate of the eastern cemetery and were at once followed by another
  party of men, who trundled two wheel-barrows, loaded with some bulky objects
  the nature of which I could not make out. I watched them with growing anxiety
  and suspicion as they passed in at the gate; and when they had all entered
  and moved away along the main path, I came forth from the shadow and began to
  walk quickly up the lane.</p>

  <p>The eastern cemetery adjoins Waterlow Park, from which it is separated by
  a low wall surmounted by tall railings, and this was my objective. The park
  was now, of course, closed for the night, locked up and deserted. So much the
  better. Locks and bars were no hindrance to me. I knew the neighbourhood of
  old. Every foot of the lane was familiar to me, though the houses that had
  grown up at the lower end had changed its aspect from that which I remembered
  when as a boy I had rambled through its leafy shades. On I strode, past the
  great gates on the left and the waiting car, within which I could see the
  driver dozing, past the white gatehouse on the right, up the steep hill until
  I came to the place where a tall oak fence encloses the park from the lane.
  Here I halted and took off my overcoat, for the six-foot fence is guarded at
  the top by a row of vicious hooks. Laying the folded overcoat across the top
  of the fence, I sprang up, sat for a moment astride and then dropped down
  into the enclosure.</p>

  <p>I now stood in a sort of dry ditch between the fence and a steep bank,
  covered with bushes which rose to the level of the park. I had just taken
  down my overcoat and was putting it on before climbing the bank when its
  place was taken by another overcoat cast over from without. Then a pair of
  hands appeared, followed by the clatter of feet against the fence and the
  next moment I saw Wallingford astride of the top and looking down at me.</p>

  <p>I still affected to be unaware of him, and, turning away, began to
  scramble up the bank, at the summit of which I pushed my way through the
  bushes, and, stepping over a three-foot fence, came out upon a by-path
  overshadowed by trees. Pausing for a moment to get my bearings and to mark
  out a route by which I could cross the park without coming into the open,
  where I might be seen by some watchful keeper, I started off towards a belt
  of trees just as Wallingford stepped over the dwarf fence and came out upon
  the path behind me.</p>

  <p>The position was becoming absurd, though I was too agitated to appreciate
  its humour. I could not protest against his following me seeing that I had
  come in the first place to spy upon him, and was now, like himself, engaged
  in spying upon Thorndyke. However, he soon solved the difficulty by
  quickening his pace and overtaking me, when he asked in a quite
  matter-of-fact tone: "What is Thorndyke up to, Mayfield?"</p>

  <p>"That is what I want to find out," I replied.</p>

  <p>"He is not acting on your instructions, then?"</p>

  <p>"No; and the probability is that what he is doing is no concern of mine or
  of yours either. But I don't know; and I have come here to make sure. Keep in
  the shadow. We don't want the keeper to see us prowling about here."</p>

  <p>He stepped back into the shade and we pursued our way in silence; and even
  then, troubled and agitated as I was, I noted that he asked me no question as
  to what was in my mind. He was leaving the initiative entirely to me.</p>

  <p>When we had crossed the park in the shelter of the trees and descended
  into the hollow by the little lake where we were out of sight of the
  gate-house, I led the way towards the boundary between the park and the
  cemetery. The two enclosures were separated, as I have said, by a low wall
  surmounted by a range of high, massive railings; and the wall and the
  cemetery beyond were partially concealed by an irregular hedge of large
  bushes. Pushing through the bushes, I moved along the wall until I came to
  the place which I intended to watch; and here I halted in the shade of a tall
  mass of bushes, and resting my arms on the broad coping of the wall, took up
  my post of observation with Wallingford, silently attentive at my side.</p>

  <p>The great burial ground was enveloped in darkness so profound that the
  crowded headstones and monuments conveyed to the eye no more than a confused
  glimmer of ghostly pallor that was barely distinguishable from the general
  obscurity. One monument only could be separately identified: a solitary stone
  cross that rose above a half-seen grave some sixty yards from the wall. But
  already the mysterious procession could be seen threading its way in and out
  by the intricate, winding paths, the gleam of the lanterns lighting up now a
  marble figure and now a staring head-stone or urn or broken column; and as it
  drew ever nearer, the glare of the lanterns, the rumble of the barrow-wheels
  on the hard paths and the spectral figures of the men grew more and more
  distinct. And still Wallingford watched and spoke never a word.</p>

  <p>At length, a turn of the path brought the procession into full view, and
  as it approached I could make out a man&mdash;evidently by his uniform, the
  cemetery keeper&mdash;leading, lantern in hand and showing the way. Nearer
  and nearer the procession drew until at last, close by the stone cross, the
  leader halted. Then, as Thorndyke and his companions&mdash;now clearly
  visible&mdash;came up, he lifted his lantern and let its light fall full on
  the cross. And even at this distance I could read with ease&mdash;though it
  was unnecessary&mdash;the single name STELLA.</p>

  <p>As that name&mdash;to me so sacred&mdash;flashed out of the darkness,
  Wallingford gripped my arm. "Great God!" he exclaimed. "It is Stella Keene's
  grave! I came here once with Barbara to plant flowers on it."</p>

  <p>He paused, breathing hard and still clutching my arm. Then, in a hoarse
  whisper, lie demanded: "What can that devil be going to do?"</p>

  <p>There was little need to ask. Even as he spoke, the labourers began to
  unload from the first barrow its lading of picks, shovels and coils of rope.
  And when these were laid on the ground, the second barrow yielded up its
  cargo; a set of rough canvas screens which the men began to set up around the
  grave. And even as the screens were being erected, another lantern slowly
  approaching along the path, revealed two men carrying a long, bedstead-like
  object&mdash;a bier&mdash;which they at length set down upon its stunted legs
  just outside the screens.</p>

  <p>With set teeth I stared incredulously between the railings at these awful
  preparations while Wallingford, breathing noisily, held fast to my arm with a
  hand that I could feel shaking violently. The lanterns inside the screens
  threw a weird, uncertain light on the canvas, and monstrous, distorted
  shadows moved to and fro. Presently, amidst these flitting, spectral shapes,
  appeared one like an enormous gnome, huge, hideous and deformed, holding an
  up-raised pick. The shadowy implement fell with an audible impact, followed
  by the ring of a shovel.</p>

  <p>At the sight and the sound&mdash;so dreadfully
  conclusive&mdash;Wallingford sprang up with a stifled cry.</p>

  <p>"God Almighty! That devil is going to dig her up!"</p>

  <p>He stood motionless and rigid for a few moments. Then, turning suddenly,
  without another word, he burst through the bushes, and I heard him racing
  madly across the park.</p>

  <p>I had half a mind to follow him. I had seen enough. I now knew the
  shocking truth. Why stay and let my soul be harrowed by the sight of these
  ghouls? Every stroke of pick or shovel seemed to knock at my heart. Why not
  go and leave them to their work of desecration? But I could not go. I could
  not tear myself away. There was the empty bier. Presently she would be lying
  on it. I could not go until I had seen her borne away.</p>

  <p>So I stayed there gazing between the railings, watching the elfin shapes
  that flitted to and fro on the screen, listening to the thud of pick and the
  ring and scrape of shovel and letting my confused thoughts wander obscurely
  through a maze of half-realized pain and anger. I try in vain to recall
  clearly what was my state of mind. Out of the confusion and bewilderment
  little emerges but a dull indignation and especially a feeling of surprised
  resentment against Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>The horrible business went on methodically. By degrees a shadowy mound
  grew up at the bottom of the screen. And then of her movements and other
  sounds; a hollow, woody sound that seemed to bring my heart into my mouth. At
  last, the screens were opened at the end and then the coffin was borne out
  and laid on the bier. By the light of the lanterns I could see it distinctly.
  I was even able to recognize it, shabby and earth-stained as it now was. I
  saw Thorndyke help the keeper to spread over it some kind of pall, and then
  two men stepped between the handles of the bier, stooped and picked it up;
  and then the grim procession re-formed and began slowly to move away.</p>

  <p>I watched it until it had passed round a turn of the path and was hidden
  from my view. Then I stood up, pushed my way through the bushes and stole
  away across the park by the way I had come. In the ditch inside the fence I
  stood for a few moments listening, but the silence was as profound as the
  darkness. As quietly as I could I climbed over the fence and dropped down
  into the lane. There seemed to be not a soul moving anywhere near;
  nevertheless, when I had slipped on my overcoat, instead of retracing my
  steps down the lane past the entrance-gates of the cemetery, I turned to the
  right and toiled up the steep hill to its termination in South Grove, where I
  bore away westward and, descending the long slope of West Hill, passed the
  Duke of St Albans and re-entered the Highgate Road.</p>

  <p>It did not occur to me to look out for any conveyance. My mind was in a
  whirl that seemed to communicate itself to my body and I walked on and on
  like one in a dream.</p>

  <p>The dreary miles of deserted streets were consumed unreckoned&mdash;though
  still, without conscious purpose, I followed the direct road home as a
  well-constructed automaton might have done. But I saw nothing. Nor, for a
  time, could I be said to think coherently. My thoughts seethed and eddied in
  such confusion that no product emerged. I was conscious only of an indignant
  sense of shocked decency and a loathing of Thorndyke and all his works.</p>

  <p>Presently, however, I grew somewhat more reasonable and my thoughts began
  to take more coherent shape. As a lawyer, I could not but perceive that
  Thorndyke must have something definite in his mind. He could not have done
  what I had seen him do without a formal authority from the Home Secretary;
  and before any such authority would have been given he would have been called
  upon to show cause why the exhumation should be carried out. And such
  licences are not lightly granted. Nor, I had to admit, was Thorndyke likely
  to have made the application without due consideration. He must have had
  reasons for this outrageous proceeding which not only appeared sufficient to
  him but which must have appeared sufficient to the Home Secretary.</p>

  <p>All this became by degrees clear enough to me. But yet I had not a
  moment's doubt that he had made some monstrous mistake. Probably he had been
  misled by something in my diary. That seemed to be the only possible
  explanation. Presently he would discover his error&mdash;by means which I
  shudderingly put aside. But when the error was discovered, the scandal would
  remain. It is impossible to maintain secrecy in a case like this. In
  twenty-four hours or less, all the world would know that the body of Mrs
  Monkhouse's step-sister had been exhumed; and no subsequent explanation would
  serve to destroy the effect of that announcement. Wallingford's dismal
  prophecy was about to be fulfilled.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Thorndyke's action amounted in effect to an open
  accusation&mdash;not of Madeline or Wallingford but of Barbara, herself. And
  this indignity she would suffer at my hands&mdash;at the hands of her oldest
  friend! The thought was maddening. But for the outrageous lateness of the
  hour, I would have gone to her at once to put her on her guard and crave her
  pardon. It was the least that I could do. But it could not he done tonight,
  for she would have been in bed hours ago and her flat locked up for the
  night. However, I would go in the morning at the earliest possible hour. I
  knew that Barbara was an early riser and it would not be amiss if I arrived
  at the flat before the maid. She must be warned at the earliest possible
  moment and by me, who was the author of the mischief.</p>

  <p>Thus, by the time that I reached my chambers I had decided clearly what
  was to be done. At first, I was disposed to reject altogether the idea of
  sleep. But presently, more reasonable thoughts prevailing, I decided at least
  to lie down and sleep a little if I could. But first I made a few
  indispensable preparations for the morning; filled the kettle and placed it
  on the gas-ring, set out the materials for a hasty breakfast, and cleaned my
  shoes. Then, when I had wound the alarm clock and set it for five, I
  partially undressed and crept into bed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch16"
     id="ch16"></a>XVI. &mdash; BARBARA'S MESSAGE</h2>

  <p class="first">THE routine of modern life creates the habit of dividing the
  day into a series of definite phases which we feel impelled to recognize even
  in circumstances to which they have no real application. Normally, the day is
  brought formally to an end by retirement to bed, a process that&mdash;also
  normally&mdash;leads to a lapse into unconsciousness the emergence from which
  marks the beginning of another day. So, in mere obedience to the call of
  habit, I had gone to bed, though, in spite of bodily fatigue, there had been
  no hint of any tendency to sleep. But I might have saved myself the trouble.
  True, my tired limbs stretched themselves out restfully and mere muscular
  fatigue slowly wore off; but my brain continued, uselessly and chaotically,
  to pursue its activities only the more feverishly when the darkness and the
  silence closed the avenues of impressions from without.</p>

  <p>Hour after hour crept by with incredible slowness, marked at each quarter
  by the gentle undertone of the Treasury clock, voicing its announcement, as
  it seemed, in polite protest (surely there was never a clock that hinted so
  delicately and unobtrusively at the passage of the irrevocable minutes "that
  perish for us and are reckoned"). Other sound there was none to break the
  weary silence of the night; but by the soft, mellow chime I was kept informed
  of the birth of another day and the progress of its infancy, which crawled so
  tardily in the wake of my impatience.</p>

  <p>At last, when half-past four had struck, I threw back the bedclothes, and,
  stepping out, switched on the light and put a match to the gas under the
  kettle. I had no occasion to hurry, but rather sought to make my preparations
  with studied deliberation; in spite of which I had shaved, washed and dressed
  and was sitting down to my frugal breakfast when the alarm clock startled me
  by blurting out with preposterous urgency its unnecessary reminder.</p>

  <p>It had just turned a quarter-past five when I set forth to take my way on
  foot towards Kensington. No conveyance was necessary, nor would it have been
  acceptable; for though throughout the wearisome hours that I had spent in bed
  my thoughts had never ceased to revolve around the problem that Thorndyke had
  set, I still seemed to have the whole matter to debate afresh.</p>

  <p>What should I say to Barbara? How should I break to her the news that my
  own appointed agent had made an undissembled accusation and was holding over
  her an unconcealed menace? I knew well enough what her attitude would be. She
  would hold me blameless and she would confront the threat against her
  reputation&mdash;even against her liberty&mdash;calmly and unafraid. I had no
  fear for her either of panic or recrimination. But how could I excuse myself?
  What could I say in extenuation of Thorndyke's secret, hostile manoeuvre?</p>

  <p>The hands of the church clock were approaching half-past six when I turned
  the corner and came in sight of the entrance to her flat. And at the same
  moment I was made to realize the imminence and the actuality of the danger
  which threatened her. In a narrow street nearly opposite to the flat, a
  closed car was drawn up in such a position that it could move out into the
  main road either to the right or left without turning round; and a glance at
  the alert driver and a watchful figure inside&mdash;both of whom looked at me
  attentively as I passed&mdash;at once aroused my suspicions. And when, as I
  crossed to the flat, I observed a tall man perambulating the pavement, those
  suspicions were confirmed. For this was no brown-hatted neophyte. The hard,
  athletic figure and the calm, observant face were unmistakable. I had seen
  too many plain-clothes policemen to miss the professional characteristics.
  And this man also took unobtrusive note of me as my destination became
  apparent.</p>

  <p>The church clock was chiming half-past six as I pressed the button of the
  electric bell by Barbara's front door. In the silence that still wrapped the
  building, I could hear the bell ring noisily, though far away, and I listened
  intently for some sounds of movement within. The maid would not arrive for
  another half hour, but I knew that Barbara was usually up at this hour. But I
  could hear no sign of any one stirring in the flat. Then I rang again, and
  yet again; and as there was still no sound from within, a vague uneasiness
  began to creep over me. Could Barbara be away from home? That might be as
  well in some respects. It might give time for the discovery of the error and
  save some unpleasantness. On the other hand&mdash;but at this moment I made a
  singular discovery myself. The latch-key was in the door! That was a most
  remarkable circumstance. It was so very unlike the methodical, self-possessed
  Barbara. But probably it had been left there by the maid. At any rate, there
  it was; and as I had now rung four times without result, I turned the key,
  pushed open the door and entered.</p>

  <p>When I had closed the door behind me, I stood for some seconds in the dark
  hall, listening. There was not a sound. I was astonished that the noise of
  the bell had not aroused Barbara; indeed, I was surprised that she was not
  already up and about. Still vaguely uneasy, I felt for the light-switch, and
  when I had turned it on, stole along the hall and peered into the sitting
  room. Of course there was no one in it; nor was there any one in the kitchen,
  or in the spare bedroom. Finally, I went to Barbara's bedroom and knocked
  loudly, at the same time calling her by name. But still there was no response
  or sound of movement.</p>

  <p>At last, after one or two more trials, I turned the handle and opening the
  door a few inches, looked in. The room was nearly dark, but the cold, wan
  light of the early morning was beginning to show on the blind; and in that
  dim twilight I could just make out a figure lying on the bed. With a sudden
  thrill of alarm, I stepped into the room and switched on the light. And then
  I stood, rooted to the spot, as if I had been turned into stone.</p>

  <p>She was there, lying half-dressed upon the bed and as still as a bronze
  effigy upon a tomb. From where I stood I could see that her right hand,
  resting on the bed, lightly held a hypodermic syringe, and that her left
  sleeve was rolled up nearly to the shoulder. And when, approaching stealthily
  on tip-toe, I drew near, I saw upon the bare arm a plainly visible puncture
  and close by it a little blister-like swelling.</p>

  <p>The first glance had made plain the dreadful truth. I had realized
  instantly that she was dead. Yet still, instinctively, I put my fingers to
  her wrist in the forlorn hope of detecting some lingering trace of life; and
  then any possible doubt was instantly dispelled; for the surface was
  stone-cold and the arm as rigid as that of a marble statue. Not only was she
  dead; she had been lying here dead while I, in my bed in the Temple, had lain
  listening to the chimes and waiting for the hour when I could come to
  her.</p>

  <p>For quite a long time I stood by the bed looking down on her in utter
  stupefaction. So overwhelming was the catastrophe that for the moment my
  faculties seemed to be paralysed, my power of thought suspended. In a trance
  of amazement I gazed at her, and, with the idle irrelevancy of a dreamer,
  noted how young, how beautiful she looked; how lissom and graceful was the
  pose of the figure, how into the waxen face with its drowsy eyes and parted
  lips, there had come a something soft and youthful, almost girlish, that had
  not been there during life. Dimly and dreamily I wondered what the difference
  could be.</p>

  <p>Suddenly my glance fell on the syringe that still rested in her hand. And
  with that my faculties awoke. She had killed herself! But why? Even as I
  asked myself the question, the terrible, the incredible answer stole into my
  mind only to be indignantly cast out. But yet&mdash;I lifted my eyes from the
  calm, pallid face, so familiar and yet so strange, and cast a scared glance
  round the room; and then I observed for the first time a small table near the
  bed on which beside a flat candle-stick containing the remains of a burnt-out
  candle, lay two unstamped letters. Stepping over to the table, I read their
  superscriptions. One was addressed to me, the other to Superintendent Miller,
  CID, and both were in Barbara's handwriting.</p>

  <p>With a shaking hand I snatched up the one addressed to me, tore open the
  envelope and drew out the letter; and this is what I read:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Thursday, 1 a.m.</p>

  <p>"My dearest Rupert,</p>

  <p>"This letter is to bid you farewell. When you receive it you will curse
  and revile me, but I shall not hear those curses. Now, as I write, you are my
  darling Rupert and I am your dear friend, Barbara. With what will be when I
  am gone, I have no concern. It would be futile to hope that any empty words
  of mine could win your forgiveness. I have no such thought and do not even
  ask for pardon. When you think of me in the future it will be with hatred and
  loathing. It cannot be otherwise. But I have no part in the future. In the
  present&mdash;which runs out with every word that I write&mdash;I love you,
  and you, at least, are fond of me. And so it will be to the end, which is now
  drawing near.</p>

  <p>"But though this which I write to you in love will be read by you in
  hatred, yet I have a mind to let you know the whole truth. And that truth can
  be summed up in three words. I love you. I have always loved you, even when I
  was a little girl and you were a boy. My desire for you has been the
  constant, consuming passion of my life, and to possess you for my own has
  been the settled purpose from which I have never deviated but once&mdash;when
  I married Harold.</p>

  <p>"As I grew up from girlhood to womanhood, my love grew from a girl's to a
  woman's passion and my resolution became more fixed. I meant to have you for
  my own. But there was Stella. I could see that you worshipped her, and I knew
  that I should never have you while she lived. I was fond of poor Stella. But
  she stood as an insuperable obstacle between you and me. And&mdash;I suppose
  I am not quite as other women. I am a woman of a single purpose. Stella stood
  in the way of that purpose. It was a terrible necessity. But it had to
  be.</p>

  <p>"And after all, I seemed to have failed. When Stella was gone, you went
  away and I thought I had lost you for ever. For I could not follow you. I
  knew that you had understood me, at least partly, and that you had fled from
  me.</p>

  <p>"Then I was in despair. It seemed that I had dismissed poor Stella to no
  purpose. For once, I lost courage, and, in my loneliness, committed myself to
  a marriage with poor Harold. It was a foolish lapse. I ought to have kept my
  courage and lived in hope, as I realized almost as soon as I had married
  him.</p>

  <p>"But when you came back, I could have killed myself. For I could see that
  you were still the same old Rupert and my love flamed up more intensely than
  ever. And once more I resolved that you should be my own; and so you would
  have been in the end but for Dr Thorndyke. That was the fatal error that I
  fell into; the error of under-valuing him. If I had only realized the
  subtlety of that man, I would have made a serious effort to deal with him. He
  should have had something very different from the frivolous make-believe that
  I sent him.</p>

  <p>"Well, Rupert, my darling, I have played my hand and I have lost. But I
  have lost only by the merest mischance. As I sit here with the ready-filled
  syringe on the table at my side, I am as confident as ever that it was worth
  while. I regret nothing but the bad luck that defeated skilful play, and the
  fact that you, my dear one, have had to pay so large a proportion of my
  losings.</p>

  <p>"I will say no more. You know everything now; and it has been a melancholy
  pleasure to me to have this little talk with you before making my exit.</p>

  <p>"Your loving friend,</p>

  <p>"BARBARA."</p>

  <p>"I have just slipped the key into the latch on the chance that you may
  come to me early. From what Tony said and what I know of you, I think it just
  possible. I hope you may. I like to think that we may meet, for the last
  time, alone."</p>

  <p>To say that this astounding letter left me numb and stupefied with
  amazement would be to express but feebly its effect on me. The whole episode
  presented itself to me as a frightful dream from which I should presently
  awaken and come back to understandable and believable realities. For I know
  not how long I stood, dazed by the shock, with my eyes riveted on that calm,
  comely figure on the bed, trying to grasp the incredible truth that this dead
  woman was Barbara, that she had killed herself and that she had murdered
  Stella&mdash;murdered her callously, deliberately and with considered
  intent.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the deathly silence of the flat was broken by the sound of an
  opening, and then of a closing door. Then a strong masculine voice was borne
  to my ear saying, in a not unkindly tone. "Now, my girl, you had better run
  off to the kitchen and shut yourself in."</p>

  <p>On this I roused, and, walking across to the door, which was still ajar,
  went out into the hall, where I confronted Superintendent Miller and
  Barbara's maid. Both stared at me in astonishment and the maid uttered a
  little cry of alarm as she turned and hurried into the kitchen. The
  superintendent looked at me steadily and with obvious suspicion, and, after a
  moment or two, asked, gruffly, nodding at the bedroom door, "Is Mrs Monkhouse
  in there?"</p>

  <p>"Mrs Monkhouse is dead," I answered.</p>

  <p>"Dead!" he repeated, incredulously. Then, pushing past me, he strode into
  the room, and as I followed, I could hear him cursing furiously in a not very
  low undertone. For a few moments he stood looking down on the corpse, gently
  touching the bare arm and apparently becoming aware of its rigidity. Suddenly
  he turned, and, glaring fiercely at me, demanded: "What is the meaning of
  this, Mr Mayfield?"</p>

  <p>"The meaning?" I repeated, looking at him inquiringly.</p>

  <p>"Yes. How came you to let her do this&mdash;that is, if she did it
  herself?"</p>

  <p>"I found her dead when I arrived here," I explained.</p>

  <p>"And when did you arrive here?"</p>

  <p>"About half an hour ago."</p>

  <p>He shook his head and rejoined in an ominously quiet tone: "That won't do,
  Sir. The maid has only just come and the dead woman couldn't have let you
  in."</p>

  <p>I explained that I had found the key in the outer door but he made no
  pretence of accepting the explanation.</p>

  <p>"That is well enough," said he, "if you can prove that the key was in the
  door. Otherwise it is a mere statement which may or may not be true. The
  actual position is that I have found you alone in this flat with the body of
  a woman who has died a violent death. You will have to account satisfactorily
  for your presence here at this time in the morning, and for your movements up
  to the time of your arrival here."</p>

  <p>The very equivocal, not to say perilous, position in which I suddenly
  found myself served to steady my wits. I realized instantly how profoundly
  suspicious the appearances really were and that if I could not produce
  evidence of my recent arrival I should quite probably have to meet the charge
  of being an accessory to the suicide. And an accessory to suicide is an
  accessory to murder. It was a very serious position.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen your man yet?" I asked. "The men, I mean, who were on
  observation duty outside."</p>

  <p>"I have seen them, but I haven't spoken to them. They are waiting out on
  the landing now. Why do you ask?"</p>

  <p>"Because I think they saw me come in here."</p>

  <p>"Ah, well, we can see about that presently. Is that letter that you have
  in your hand from Mrs Monkhouse? Because, if it is, I shall want to see
  it."</p>

  <p>"I don't want to show it unless it is necessary; and I don't think it will
  be. There is a letter addressed to you which will probably tell you all that
  you need know."</p>

  <p>He snatched up the letter, and, tearing it open, glanced through it
  rapidly. Then, without comment, he handed it to me. It was quite short and
  ran as follows:</p>

  <p>"Thursday, 1.35 a.m.</p>

  <p>"Mr Superintendent Miller, CID</p>

  <p>"This is to inform you that I alone am responsible for the death of my
  late husband, Harold Monkhouse, and also for that of the late Miss Stella
  Keene. I had no confidants or accomplices and no one was aware of what I had
  done.</p>

  <p>"As my own death will occur in about ten minutes (from an injection of
  morphine which I shall administer to myself) this statement may be taken as
  my dying declaration.</p>

  <p>"I may add that no one is aware of my intention to take my life.</p>

  <p>"Yours very truly</p>

  <p>"BARBARA MONKHOUSE."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Miller, as I returned the letter to him, "that supports your
  statement, and if my men saw you enter the flat, that will dispose of the
  matter so far as the suicide is concerned. But there is another question. It
  is evident that she knew that a discovery had been made. Now, who told her?
  Was it you, Mr Mayfield?"</p>

  <p>"No," I replied, "it was not. I found her dead when I arrived, as I have
  told you."</p>

  <p>"Do you know who did tell her?"</p>

  <p>"I do not; and I am not disposed to make any guesses."</p>

  <p>"No, it's no use guessing. Still, you know, Mr Mayfield, you knew, and you
  came here to tell her; and you know who knew besides yourself. But there," he
  added, as we moved out into the hall, "it is no use going into that now. I've
  acted like a fool&mdash;too punctilious by half. I oughtn't to have let her
  slip through my fingers. I should have acted at once on Dr Thorndyke's hint
  without waiting for confirmation."</p>

  <p>He was still speaking in an angry, reproachful tone; but suddenly his
  manner changed. Looking at me critically but with something of kindly
  sympathy, he said: "It has been a trying business for you, Mr
  Mayfield&mdash;the whole scandalous affair; and this must have given you a
  frightful shock, though I expect you would rather have it as it is than as it
  ought to have been. But you don't look any the better for it."</p>

  <p>He escorted me politely but definitely to the outer door, and when he
  opened it I saw his two subordinates waiting on the landing; to both of whom
  collectively Miller addressed the inquiry: "Did you see Mr Mayfield enter
  this flat?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Sir," was the reply of one, confirmed by the other. "He went up the
  stairs at exactly half-past six."</p>

  <p>Miller nodded, and wishing me "good morning," beckoned to the two
  officers; and as I turned to descend the stairs, I saw the three enter and
  heard the door shut.</p>

  <p>Once more in the outer world, walking the grey, half-lighted streets, to
  which the yet unextinguished lamps seemed only to impart an added chill, my
  confused thoughts took up the tangled threads at the point at which the
  superintendent's appearance had broken them off. But I could not get my ideas
  arranged into any intelligible form. Each aspect of the complex tragedy
  conflicted with all the others. The pitiful figure that I had left lying on
  the bed made its appeal in spite of the protest of reason; for the friendship
  of a lifetime cannot easily be extinguished in a moment. I knew now that she
  was a wretch, a monster; and when I reminded myself of what she had done, I
  grudged the easy, painless death by which she had slipped away so quietly
  from the wreckage that her incredible wickedness had created. When I
  contrasted that death&mdash;a more gentle lapsing into oblivion&mdash;with
  the long, cheerfully endured sufferings of brave, innocent little Stella, I
  could have cursed the faithful friendship of Wallingford which had let her
  escape from the payment to the uttermost farthing other hideous debt. And yet
  the face that haunted me&mdash;the calm, peaceful, waxen face&mdash;was the
  face of Barbara, my friend, almost my sister, who had been so much to me, who
  had loved me with that strange, tenacious, terrible passion.</p>

  <p>It was very confusing. And the same inconsistency pervaded my thoughts of
  Thorndyke. Unreasonably, I found myself thinking of him with a certain
  repulsion, almost of dislike, as the cause of this catastrophe. Yet my reason
  told me that he had acted with the highest motives of justice; that he had
  but sought retribution for Stella's sufferings and death and those of poor,
  harmless Harold Monkhouse; that as a barrister, even as a citizen, he could
  do no less than denounce the wrong-doer. But my feelings were too lacerated,
  my emotions too excited to allow my reason to deal with the conflicting
  elements of this tragedy.</p>

  <p>In this confused state of mind, I walked on, hardly conscious of
  direction, until I found myself at the entry of my chambers. I went in and
  made a futile attempt to do some work. Then I paced the room for an hour or
  more, alternately raging against Barbara and recalling the lonely figure that
  I had seen in the twilight of that darkened room, until my unrest drove me
  forth again to wander through the streets, away into the squalid east, among
  the docks and the rookeries from Whitechapel to Limehouse.</p>

  <p>It was evening when, once more, I dragged myself up my stairs, and, spent
  with fatigue and exhausted by lack of food&mdash;for during the whole day I
  had taken but a few cups of tea, hastily snatched in the course of my
  wanderings&mdash;re-entered my chamber. As I closed the door, I noticed a
  letter in the box, and taking it out, listlessly opened the envelope. It was
  from Thorndyke; a short note, but very cordially worded, begging me "like a
  good fellow" to go round to have a talk with him.</p>

  <p>I flung the note down impatiently on the table, with an immediate
  resurgence of my unreasonable sense of resentment. But in a few minutes I
  experienced a sudden revulsion of feeling. A sense of profound loneliness
  came upon me; a yearning for human companionship, and especially for the
  companionship of Thorndyke, from whom I had no secrets, and who knew the
  whole dreadful story even to its final culmination.</p>

  <p>Once more, foot-sore as I was, I descended my stairs and a couple of
  minutes later was ascending the "pair" that led up to Thorndyke's
  chambers.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch17"
     id="ch17"></a>XVII. &mdash; THORNDYKE RETRACES THE TRAIL</h2>

  <p class="first">APPARENTLY Thorndyke had seen me from the window as I
  crossed the Walk, for, when I reached the landing, I found him standing in
  the open doorway of his chambers; and at the sight of him, whatever traces of
  unreasonable resentment may have lingered in my mind, melted away instantly.
  He grasped my hand with almost affectionate warmth, and looking at me
  earnestly and with the most kindly solicitude, said: "I am glad you have
  come, Mayfield. I couldn't bear to think of you alone in your chambers,
  haunted by this horrible tragedy."</p>

  <p>"You have heard, then&mdash;about Barbara, I mean?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Miller called and told me. Of course, he is righteously angry that
  she has escaped, and I sympathize with him. But for us&mdash;for you and
  me&mdash;it is a great deliverance. I was profoundly relieved when I heard
  that she was gone; that the axe had fallen once for all."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I admitted, "it was better than the frightful alternative of a
  trial and what would have followed. But still, it was terrible to see her,
  lying dead, and to know that it was my hand&mdash;the hand of her oldest and
  dearest friend&mdash;that had struck the blow."</p>

  <p>"It was my hand, Mayfield, not yours, that actually struck the blow. But
  even if it had been yours instead of your agent's, what could have been more
  just and proper than that retribution should have come through the hand of
  the friend and guardian of that poor murdered girl?"</p>

  <p>I assented with a shudder to the truth of what he had said, but still my
  mind was too confused to allow me to see things in their true perspective.
  Barbara, my friend, was still more real to me than Barbara the murderess. He
  nodded sympathetically enough when I explained this, but rejoined, firmly:
  "You must try, my dear fellow, to see things as they really are. Shocking as
  this tragedy is, it would have been immeasurably worse if that terrible woman
  had not received timely warning. As it is, the horrible affair has run its
  course swiftly and is at an end. And do not forget that if the axe has fallen
  on the guilty its menace has been lifted from the innocent. Madeline Norris
  and Anthony Wallingford will sleep in peace tonight, free from the spectre of
  suspicion that has haunted them ever since Harold Monkhouse died. As to the
  woman whose body you found this morning, she was a monster. She could not
  have been permitted to live. Her very existence was a menace to the lives of
  all who came into contact with her."</p>

  <p>Again, I could not but assent to his stern indictment and his impartial
  statement of the facts.</p>

  <p>"Very well, Mayfield," said he. "Then try to put it to yourself that, for
  you, the worst has happened and is done with. Try to put it away as a thing
  that now belongs to the past and is, in so far as it is possible, to be
  forgotten."</p>

  <p>"As far as is possible," I repeated. "Yes, of course, you are quite right,
  Thorndyke. But forgetfulness is not a thing which we can command at
  will."</p>

  <p>"Very true," he replied. "But yet we can control to a large extent the
  direction of our thoughts. We can find interests and occupations. And,
  speaking of occupations, let me show you some of Polton's productions."</p>

  <p>He rose, and putting a small table by the side of my chair, placed on it
  one or two small copper plaques and a silver medallion which he had taken
  from a drawer. The medallion was the self-portrait of Stella which had lain
  dormant in the wax mould through all the years which had passed since her
  death, and as I took it in my hand and gazed at the beloved face, I found it
  beautiful beyond my expectations.</p>

  <p>"It is a most charming little work," I said, holding it so that the lamp
  light fell most favourably on the relic, "I am infinitely obliged to you,
  Thorndyke."</p>

  <p>"Don't thank me," said he. "The whole credit is due to Polton. Not that he
  wants any thanks, for the work has yielded him hours of perfect happiness.
  But here he is with the products of another kind of work."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, Polton entered with a tray and began in his neat, noiseless
  way, to lay the table. I don't know how much he knew, but when I caught his
  eye and his smile of greeting, it seemed to me that friendliness and kindly
  sympathy exuded from every line of his quaint, crinkly face. I thanked him
  for his skilful treatment of my treasures and then, observing that he was
  apparently laying the table for supper, would have excused myself. But
  Thorndyke would hear of no excuses.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow," said he, "you are the very picture of physical
  exhaustion. I suspect that you have had practically no food today. A meal
  will help you to begin to get back to the normal. And, in any case, you
  mustn't disappoint Polton, who has been expecting you to supper and has
  probably made a special effort to do credit to the establishment."</p>

  <p>I could only repeat my acknowledgments of Polton's goodness (noting that
  he certainly must have made a special effort, to judge by the results which
  began to make themselves evident) and, conquering my repugnance to the idea
  of eating, take my place at the table.</p>

  <p>It is perhaps somewhat humiliating to reflect that our emotional states,
  which we are apt to consider on a lofty spiritual plane, are controlled by
  matters so grossly material as the mere contents of our stomachs. But such is
  the degrading truth, as I now realized. For no sooner had I commenced a
  reluctant attack on the products of Polton's efforts and drunk a glass of
  Burgundy&mdash;delicately warmed by that versatile artist to the exact
  optimum temperature&mdash;than my mental and physical unrest began to subside
  and allow a reasonable, normal outlook to develop, with a corresponding
  bodily state. In effect, I made quite a good meal and found myself listening
  with lively interest to Thorndyke's account of the technical processes
  involved in converting my little plaster plaques and the wax mould into their
  final states in copper and silver.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, in the intervals of conversation the unforgettable events of
  the morning and the preceding night tended to creep back into my
  consciousness; and now a question which I had hitherto hardly considered
  began to clamour for an answer. Towards the end of the meal, I put it into
  words. Apropos of nothing in our previous conversation, I asked: "How did you
  know, Thorndyke?" and as he looked up inquiringly, I added: "I mean, how were
  you able to make so confident a guess, for, of course, you couldn't actually
  know?"</p>

  <p>"When do you mean?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I mean that when you applied for a Home Office authority you must have
  had something to go on beyond a mere guess."</p>

  <p>"Certainly I had," he replied. "It was not a guess at all. It was a
  certainty. When I made the application I was able to say that I had positive
  knowledge that Stella Keene had been poisoned with arsenic. The examination
  of the poor child's body was not for my information. I would have avoided it
  if that had been possible. But it was not. As soon as my declaration was
  made, the exhumation became inevitable. The Crown could not have prosecuted
  on a charge of poisoning without an examination of the victim's body."</p>

  <p>"But, Thorndyke," I expostulated, "how could you have been certain&mdash;I
  mean certain in a legal sense? Surely it could have been no more than a
  matter of inference."</p>

  <p>"It was not," he replied. "It was a matter of demonstrated fact. I could
  have taken the case into court and proved the fact of arsenical poisoning.
  But, of course, the jury would have demanded evidence from an examination of
  the body, and quite properly, too. Every possible corroboration should be
  obtained in a criminal trial."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," I agreed. "But still I find your statement incomprehensible.
  You speak of demonstrated fact. But what means of demonstration had you?
  There was my diary. I take it that that was the principal source of your
  information; in fact I can't think of any other. But the diary could only
  have yielded documentary evidence, which is quite a different thing from
  demonstrated fact."</p>

  <p>"Quite," he agreed. "The diary contributed handsomely to the train of
  circumstantial evidence that I had constructed. But the
  demonstration&mdash;the final, positive proof&mdash;came from another source.
  A very curious and unexpected source."</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said I, "as the case is finished and dealt with, there would
  be no harm in my asking how you arrived at your conclusion?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all," he replied. "The whole investigation is a rather long story,
  but I will give you a summary of it if you like."</p>

  <p>"Why a summary?" I objected. "I would rather have it in extenso if it will
  not weary you to relate it."</p>

  <p>"It will be more likely to weary you," he replied. "But if you are equal
  to a lengthy exposition, let us take to our easy chairs and combine bodily
  comfort with forensic discourse."</p>

  <p>We drew up the two arm-chairs before the hearth, and when Polton had made
  up the fire and placed between us a small table furnished with a decanter and
  glasses, Thorndyke began his exposition.</p>

  <p>"This case is in some respects one of the most curious and interesting
  that I have met with in the whole of my experience of medico-legal practice.
  At the first glance, as I told you at the time, the problem that it presented
  seemed hopelessly beyond solution. All the evidence appeared to be in the
  past and utterly irrecoverable. The vital questions were concerned with
  events that had passed unrecorded and of which there seemed to be no
  possibility that they could ever be disinterred from the oblivion in which
  they were buried. Looking back now on the body of evidence that has gradually
  accumulated, I am astonished at the way in which the apparently forgotten
  past has given up its secrets, one after another, until it has carried its
  revelation from surmise to probability and from probability at last to
  incontestable proof.</p>

  <p>"The inquiry divides itself into certain definite stages, each of which
  added new matter to that which had gone before. We begin, naturally, with the
  inquest on Harold Monkhouse, and we may consider this in three aspects: the
  ascertained condition of the body; the evidence of the witnesses; and the
  state of affairs disclosed by the proceedings viewed as a whole.</p>

  <p>"First, as to the body: there appeared to be no doubt that Monkhouse died
  from arsenical poisoning, but there was no clear evidence as to how the
  poison had been administered. It was assumed that it had been taken in food
  or in medicine&mdash;that it had been swallowed&mdash;and no alternative
  method of administration was suggested or considered. But on studying the
  medical witnesses' evidence, and comparing it with the descriptions of the
  patient's symptoms, I was disposed to doubt whether the poison had actually
  been taken by the mouth at all."</p>

  <p>"Why," I exclaimed, "how else could it have been taken?"</p>

  <p>"There are quite a number of different ways in which poisonous doses of
  arsenic can be taken. Finely powdered arsenic is readily absorbed by the
  skin. There have been several deaths from the use of 'violet powder'
  contaminated with arsenic, and clothing containing powdered arsenic would
  produce poisonous effects. Then there are certain arsenical
  gases&mdash;notably arsine, or arseniureted hydrogen&mdash;which are
  intensely poisonous and which possibly account for a part of the symptoms in
  poisoning from arsenical wallpapers. There seemed to me to be some suggestion
  of arsenical gas in Monkhouse's case, but it was obviously not pure gas
  poisoning. The impression conveyed to me was that of a mixed poisoning; that
  the arsenic had been partly inhaled and partly applied to the skin, but very
  little, if any, taken by the mouth."</p>

  <p>"You are not forgetting that arsenic was actually found in the
  stomach?"</p>

  <p>"No. But the quantity was very minute; and a minute quantity is of no
  significance. One of the many odd and misleading facts about arsenic
  poisoning is that, in whatever way the drug is taken, a small quantity is
  always found in the stomach and there are always some signs of gastric
  irritation. The explanation seems to be that arsenic which has got into the
  blood in any way&mdash;through the skin, the lungs or otherwise&mdash;tends
  to be eliminated in part through the stomach. At any rate, the fact is that
  the presence of minute quantities of arsenic in the stomach affords no
  evidence that the poison was swallowed."</p>

  <p>"But," I objected, "what of the Fowler's Solution which was found in the
  medicine?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said he. "That was the discrepancy that attracted my attention.
  The assumption was that deceased had taken in his medicine a quantity of
  Fowler's Solution representing about a grain and a half of arsenious acid. If
  that had been so we should have expected to find a very appreciable quantity
  in the stomach: much more than was actually found. The condition of the body
  did not agree with the dose that was assumed to have been taken; and when one
  came to examine the evidence of the various witnesses there was further room
  for doubt. Two of them had noticed the medicine at the time when the Fowler's
  Solution had not been added; but no witness had noticed it after the alleged
  change and before the death of deceased. The presence of the Fowler's
  Solution was not observed until several days after his death. Taking all the
  facts together, there was a distinct suggestion that the solution had been
  added to the medicine at some time after Monkhouse's death. But this
  suggestion tended to confirm my suspicion that the poison had not been
  swallowed. For the discovery of the Fowler's Solution in the medicine would
  tend to divert inquiry&mdash;and did, in fact, divert it&mdash;from any other
  method of administering the poison.</p>

  <p>"To finish with the depositions: not only was there a complete lack of
  evidence even suggesting any one person as the probable delinquent; there was
  not the faintest suggestion of any motive that one could consider seriously.
  The paltry pecuniary motive applied to all the parties and could not be
  entertained in respect of any of them. The only person who could have had a
  motive was Barbara. She was a young, attractive woman, married to an elderly,
  unattractive husband. If she had been attached to another man, she would have
  had the strongest and commonest of all motives. But there was nothing in the
  depositions to hint at any other man; and since she was absent from home when
  the poisoning occurred, she appeared to be outside the area of possible
  suspicion.</p>

  <p>"And now to look at the evidence as a whole; you remember Miller's
  comment. There was something queer about the case; something very oddly
  elusive. At the first glance it seemed to bristle with suspicious facts. But
  when those facts were scrutinized they meant nothing. There were plenty of
  clues but they led nowhere. There was Madeline Norris who prepared the
  victim's food&mdash;an obvious suspect. But then it appeared that the poison
  was in the medicine, not in the food. There was Wallingford who actually had
  poison in his possession. But it was the wrong poison. There was the bottle
  that had undoubtedly contained arsenic. But it was nobody's bottle. There was
  the bottle that smelled of lavender and had red stains in it and was found in
  Miss Norris' possession; but it contained no arsenic. And so on.</p>

  <p>"Now all this was very strange. The strongest suspicion was thrown on a
  number of people collectively. But it failed every time to connect itself
  with any one individually. I don't know precisely what Miller thought of it,
  but to me it conveyed the strong impression of a scheme&mdash;of something
  arranged, and arranged with extraordinary skill and ingenuity, I had the
  feeling that, behind all these confusing and inconsistent appearances, was a
  something quite different, with which they had no real connection; that all
  these apparent clues were a sort of smoke-screen thrown up to conceal the
  actual mechanism of the murder.</p>

  <p>"What could the mechanism of the murder have been? That was what I asked
  myself. And by whom could the arrangements have been made and carried out?
  Here the question of motive became paramount. What motive could be imagined?
  And who could have been affected by it? That seemed to be the essential part
  of the problem, and the only one that offered the possibility of
  investigation.</p>

  <p>"Now, as I have said, the most obvious motive in cases of this kind is
  that of getting rid of a husband or wife to make room for another. And
  ignoring moral considerations, it is a perfectly rational motive; for the
  murder of the unwanted spouse is the only possible means of obtaining the
  desired release. The question was, could such a motive have existed in the
  present case; and the answer was that, on inspection, it appeared to be a
  possible motive, although there was no evidence that it actually existed.
  But, assuming its possibility for the sake of argument, who could have been
  affected by it? At once, one saw that Madeline Norris was excluded. The death
  of Harold Monkhouse did not affect her, in this respect, at all. There
  remained only Barbara and Wallingford. To take the latter first: he was a
  young man, and the wife was a young, attractive woman; he had lived in the
  same house with her, appeared to be her social equal and was apparently on
  terms of pleasant intimacy with her. If he had any warmer feelings towards
  her, her husband's existence formed an insuperable obstacle to the
  realization of his wishes. There was no evidence that he had any such
  feelings, but the possibility had to be borne in mind. And there were the
  further facts that he evidently had some means of obtaining poisons and that
  he had ample opportunities for administering them to the deceased. All things
  considered, Wallingford appeared, prima facie, to be the most likely person
  to have committed the murder.</p>

  <p>"Now to take the case of Barbara. In the first place, there was the
  possibility that she might have had some feeling towards Wallingford, in
  which case she would probably have been acting in collusion with him and her
  absence from home on each occasion when the poisoning took place would have
  been part of the arrangement. But, excluding Wallingford, and supposing her
  to be concerned with some other man, did her absence from home absolutely
  exclude the possibility of her being the poisoner? There were suggestions of
  skilful and ingenious arrangements to create false appearances. Was it
  possible that those arrangements included some method by which the poison
  could be administered during her absence without the connivance or knowledge
  of any other person?</p>

  <p>"I pondered this question carefully by the light of all the details
  disclosed at the inquest; and the conclusion that I reached was that, given a
  certain amount of knowledge, skill and executive ability, the thing was
  possible. But as soon as I had admitted the possibility, I was impressed by
  the way in which the suggestion fitted in with the known facts and served to
  explain them. For all the arranged appearances pointed to the use of Fowler's
  Solution, administered by the mouth. But this could not possibly have been
  the method if the poisoner were a hundred miles away. And as I have said, I
  was strongly inclined to infer, from the patient's symptoms and the condition
  of the body, that the poison had not been administered by the mouth.</p>

  <p>"But all this, as you will realize, was purely hypothetical. None of the
  assumptions was supported by a particle of positive evidence. They merely
  represented possibilities which I proposed to bear in mind in the
  interpretation of any new evidence that might come into view.</p>

  <p>"This brings us to the end of the first stage; the conclusions arrived at
  by a careful study of the depositions. But following hard on the inquest was
  your visit to me when you gave me the particulars of your past life and your
  relations with Barbara and Monkhouse. Now your little autobiographical sketch
  was extremely enlightening, and, as it has turned out, of vital importance.
  In the first place, it made clear to me that your relations with Barbara were
  much more intimate than I had supposed. You were not merely friends of long
  standing; you were virtually in the relation of brother and sister. But with
  this very important difference: that you were not brother and sister. An
  adopted brother is a possible husband; an adopted sister is a possible wife.
  And when I considered your departure to Canada with the intention of
  remaining there for life, and your unexpected return. I found that the bare
  possibility that Barbara might wish to be released from her marriage had
  acquired a certain measure of probability.</p>

  <p>"But further; your narrative brought into view another person who had
  died. And the death of that person presented a certain analogy with the death
  of Monkhouse. For if Barbara had wished to be your wife, both these persons
  stood immovably in the way of her wishes. Of course there was no evidence
  that she had any such wish and the death of Stella was alleged to have been
  due to natural causes. Nevertheless, the faint, hypothetical suggestions
  offered by these new facts were strikingly similar to those offered by the
  previous facts.</p>

  <p>"The next stage opened when I read your diary, especially the volume
  written during the last year of Stella's life. But now one came out of the
  region of mere speculative hypothesis into that of very definite suspicion. I
  had not read very far when, from your chance references to the symptoms of
  Stella's illness, I came to the decided conclusion that, possibly mingled
  with the symptoms of real disease, were those of more or less chronic
  arsenical poisoning. And what was even more impressive, those symptoms seemed
  to be closely comparable with Monkhouse's symptoms, particularly in the
  suggestion of a mixed poisoning partly due to minute doses of arsine. I need
  not go into details, but you will remember that you make occasional
  references to slight attacks of jaundice (which is very characteristic of
  arsine poisoning) and to 'eye-strain' which the spectacles failed to relieve.
  But, redness, smarting and watering of the eyes is an almost constant symptom
  of chronic arsenic poisoning. And there were various other symptoms of a
  decidedly suspicious character to which you refer and which I need not go
  into now.</p>

  <p>"Then a careful study of the diary brought into view another very
  impressive fact. There were considerable fluctuations in Stella's condition.
  Sometimes she appeared to be so far improving as to lead you to some hopes of
  her actual recovery. Then there would be a rather sudden change for the worse
  and she would lose more than she had gained. Now, at this time Barbara had
  already become connected with the political movement which periodically
  called her away from home for periods varying from one to four weeks; and
  when I drew up a table of the dates other departures and returns, I found
  that the periods included between them&mdash;that is the periods during which
  she was absent from home&mdash;coincided most singularly with Stella's
  relapses. The coincidence was so complete that, when I had set the data out
  in a pair of diagrams in the form of graphs, the resemblance of the two
  diagrams was most striking. I will show you the diagrams presently.</p>

  <p>"But there was something else that I was on the look-out for in the diary,
  but it was only quite near the end that I found it. Quite early, I learned
  that Stella was accustomed to read and work at night by the light of a
  candle. But I could not discover what sort of candle she used; whether it was
  an ordinary household candle or one of some special kind. At last I came on
  the entry in which you describe the making of the wax mould; and then I had
  the information that I had been looking for. In that entry you mention that
  you began by lifting the reflector off the candle, by which I learned that
  the receptacle used was not an ordinary candlestick. Then you remark that the
  candle was of 'good hard wax'; by which I learned that it was not an ordinary
  household candle&mdash;these being usually composed of a rather soft paraffin
  wax. Apparently, it was a stearine candle such as is made for use in
  candlelamps."</p>

  <p>"But," I expostulated, "how could it possibly matter what sort of candle
  she used? The point seems to be quite irrelevant."</p>

  <p>"The point," he replied, "was not only relevant; it was of crucial
  importance. But I had better explain. When I was considering the
  circumstances surrounding the poisoning of Monkhouse, I decided that the
  probabilities pointed to Barbara as the poisoner. But she was a hundred miles
  away when the poisoning occurred; hence the question that I asked myself was
  this: Was there any method that was possible and practicable in the existing
  circumstances by which Barbara could have arranged that the poisoning could
  be effected during her absence? And the answer was that there was such a
  method, but only one. The food and the medicine were prepared and
  administered by those who were on the spot. But the candles were supplied by
  Barbara and by her put into the bedside candle-box before she went away. And
  they would operate during her absence."</p>

  <p>"But," I exclaimed, "do I understand you to suggest that it is possible to
  administer poison by means of a candle?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," he replied. "It is quite possible and quite practicable. If a
  candle is charged with finely powdered arsenious acid&mdash;'white
  arsenic'&mdash;when that candle is burnt, the arsenious acid will be partly
  vaporized and partly converted into arsine, or arseniureted hydrogen. Most of
  the arsine will be burnt in the flame and reconverted into arsenious acid,
  which will float in the air, as it condenses, in the form of an almost
  invisible white cloud. The actual result will be that the air in the
  neighbourhood of the candle will contain small traces of arsine&mdash;which
  is an intensely poisonous gas&mdash;and considerable quantities of arsenious
  acid, floating about in the form of infinitely minute crystals. This
  impalpable dust will be breathed into the lungs of any person near the candle
  and will settle on the skin, from which it will be readily absorbed into the
  blood and produce all the poisonous effects of arsenic.</p>

  <p>"Now, in the case of Harold Monkhouse, not only was there a special kind
  of candle, supplied by the suspected person, but, as I have told you, the
  symptoms during life and the appearances of the dead body, all seemed to me
  to point to some method of poisoning through the lungs and skin rather than
  by way of the stomach, and also suggested a mixed poisoning in which arsine
  played some part. So that the candle was not only a possible medium of the
  poisoning; it was by far the most probable.</p>

  <p>"Hence, when I came to consider Stella's illness and noted the strong
  suggestion of arsenic poisoning; and when I noted the parallelism of her
  illness with that of Monkhouse; I naturally kept a watchful eye for a
  possible parallelism in the method of administering the poison. And not only
  did I find that parallelism; but in that very entry, I found strong
  confirmation of my suspicion that the candle was poisoned. You will remember
  that you mention the circumstance that on the night following the making of
  the wax mould you were quite seriously unwell. Apparently you were suffering
  from a slight attack of acute arsenical poisoning, due to your having inhaled
  some of the fumes from the burning candle."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I remember that," said I. "But what is puzzling me is how the
  candles could have been obtained. Surely it is not possible to buy arsenical
  candles?"</p>

  <p>"No," he replied, "it is not. But it is possible to buy a candle-mould,
  with which it is quite easy to make them. Remember that, not so very long
  ago, most country people used to make their own candles, and the hinged
  moulds that they used are still by no means rare. You will find specimens in
  most local museums and in curio shops in country towns and you can often pick
  them up in farmhouse sales. And if you have a candle-mould, the making of
  arsenical candles is quite a simple affair. Barbara, as we know, used to buy
  a particular German brand of stearine candles. All that she had to do was to
  melt the candles, put the separated wicks into the mould, stir some
  finely-powdered white arsenic into the melted wax and pour it into the mould.
  When the wax was cool, the mould would be opened and the candles taken
  out-these hinged moulds usually made about six candles at a time. Then it
  would be necessary to scrape off the seam left by the mould and smooth the
  candles to make them look like those sold in the shops."</p>

  <p>"It was a most diabolically ingenious scheme," said I.</p>

  <p>"It was," he agreed. "The whole villainous plan was very completely
  conceived and most efficiently carried out. But to return to our argument.
  The discovery that Stella had used a special form of candle left me in very
  little doubt that Barbara was the poisoner and that poisoned candles had been
  the medium used in both crimes. For we were now out of the region of mere
  hypothesis. We were dealing with genuine circumstantial evidence. But that
  evidence was still much too largely inferential to serve as the material for
  a prosecution. We still needed some facts of a definite and tangible kind;
  and as soon as you came back from your travels on the Southeastern Circuit,
  fresh facts began to accumulate. Passing over the proceedings of Wallingford
  and his follower and the infernal machine&mdash;all of which were
  encouraging, as offering corroboration, but of no immediate
  assistance&mdash;the first really important accretion of evidence occurred in
  connection with our visit to the empty house in Hilborough Square."</p>

  <p>"Ha!" I exclaimed. "Then you did find something significant, in spite of
  your pessimistic tone at the time? I may say, Thorndyke, that I had a feeling
  that you went to that house with the definite expectation of finding some
  specific thing. Was I wrong?"</p>

  <p>"No. You were quite right. I went there with the expectation of finding
  one thing and a faint hope of finding another; and both the expectation and
  the hope were justified by the event. My main purpose in that expedition was
  to obtain samples of the wallpaper from Monkhouse's room, but I thought it
  just possible that the soot from the bedroom chimneys might yield some
  information. And it did.</p>

  <p>"To begin with the wallpaper: the condition of the room made it easy to
  secure specimens. I tore off about a dozen pieces and wrote a number on each,
  to correspond with numbers that I marked on a rough sketch-plan of the room
  which I drew first. My expectation was that if&mdash;as I
  believed&mdash;arsenical candles had been burnt in that room, arsenic would
  have been deposited on all the walls, but in varying amounts, proportionate
  to the distance of the wall from the candle. The loose piece of paper on the
  wall by the bed was, of course, the real touchstone of the case, for if there
  were no arsenic in it, the theory of the arsenical candle would hardly be
  tenable. I therefore took the extra precaution of writing a full description
  of its position on the back of the piece and deposited it for greater safety
  in my letter-case.</p>

  <p>"As soon as I reached home that day I spread out the torn fragment on the
  wide stage of a culture microscope and examined its outer surface with a
  strong top light. And the very first glance settled the question. The whole
  surface was spangled over with minute crystals, many of them hardly a
  ten-thousandth of an inch in diameter, sparkling in the strong light like
  diamonds and perfectly unmistakable; the characteristic octahedral crystals
  of arsenious acid.</p>

  <p>"But distinctive as they were, I took nothing for granted. Snipping off a
  good-sized piece of the paper, I submitted it to the Marsh-Berzelius test and
  got a very pronounced 'arsenical mirror,' which put the matter beyond any
  possible doubt or question. I may add that I tested all the other pieces and
  got an arsenic reaction from them all, varying, roughly, according to their
  distance from the table on which the candle stood.</p>

  <p>"Thus the existence of the arsenical candle was no longer a matter of
  hypothesis or even of mere probability; it was virtually a demonstrated fact.
  The next question was, who put the arsenic into the candle? All the evidence,
  such as it was, pointed to Barbara. But there was not enough of it. No single
  fact connected her quite definitely with the candles, and it had to be
  admitted that they had passed through other hands than hers and that the
  candle-box was accessible to several people, especially during her absence.
  Clear evidence, then, was required to associate her&mdash;or someone
  else&mdash;with those poisoned candles, and I had just a faint hope that such
  evidence might be forthcoming. This was how I reasoned:</p>

  <p>"Here was a case of poisoning in which the poison was self-administered
  and the actual poisoner was absent. Consequently it was impossible to give a
  calculated dose on a given occasion, nor was it possible to estimate in
  advance the amount that would be necessary to produce the desired result.
  Since the poison was to be left within reach of the victim, to be taken from
  time to time, it would be necessary to leave a quantity considerably in
  excess of the amount actually required to produce death on any one occasion.
  It is probable that all the candles in the box were poisoned. In any case,
  most of them must have been; and as the box was filled to last for the whole
  intended time of Barbara's absence, there would be a remainder of poisoned
  candles in the box when Monkhouse died. But the incident of the 'faked'
  medicine showed that the poisoner was fully alive to the possibility of an
  examination of the room. It was not likely that so cautious a criminal would
  leave such damning evidence as the arsenical candles in full view. For if, by
  chance, one of them had been lighted and the bearer had developed symptoms of
  poisoning, the murder would almost certainly have been out. In any case, we
  could assume that the poisoner would remove them and destroy them after
  putting ordinary candles in their place.</p>

  <p>"But a candle is not a very easy thing to destroy. You can't throw it down
  a sink, or smash it up and cast it into the rubbish-bin. It must be burnt;
  and owing to its inflammability, it must be burnt carefully and rather
  slowly; and if it contains a big charge of arsenic, the operator must take
  considerable precautions. And finally, these particular candles had to be
  burnt secretly.</p>

  <p>"Having regard to these considerations, I decided that the only safe and
  practicable way to get rid of them was to burn them in a fireplace with the
  window wide open. This would have to be done at night when all the household
  was asleep, so as to be safe from interruption and discovery; and a screen
  would have to be put before the fireplace to prevent the glare from being
  visible through the open window. If there were a fire in the grate, so much
  the better. The candles could be cut up into small pieces and thrown into the
  fire one at a time.</p>

  <p>"Of course the whole matter was speculative. There might have been no
  surplus candles, or if there were, they might have been taken out of the
  house and disposed of in some other way. But one could only act on the
  obvious probabilities and examine the chimneys, remembering that whereas a
  negative result would prove nothing for or against any particular person, a
  positive result would furnish very weighty evidence. Accordingly I collected
  samples of soot from the various bedroom chimneys and from that of Barbara's
  boudoir, labelling each of them with the aid of the cards which you had left
  in the respective rooms.</p>

  <p>"The results were, I think, quite conclusive. When I submitted the samples
  to analysis I found them all practically free from arsenic&mdash;disregarding
  the minute traces that one expects to find in ordinary soot&mdash;with one
  exception. The soot from Barbara's bedroom chimney yielded, not mere traces,
  but an easily measurable quantity&mdash;much too large to have been
  attributable to the coal burnt in the grate.</p>

  <p>"Thus, you see, so far as the murder of Monkhouse was concerned, there was
  a fairly conclusive case against Barbara. It left not a shadow of doubt in my
  mind that she was the guilty person. But you will also see that it was not a
  satisfactory case to take into court. The whole of the evidence was
  scientific and might have appeared rather unconvincing to the ordinary
  juryman, though it would have been convincing enough to the judge. I debated
  with myself whether I should communicate my discoveries to the police and
  leave them to decide for or against a prosecution, or whether I should keep
  silence and seek for further evidence. And finally I decided, for the
  present, to keep my own counsel. You will understand why."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said I. "You suspected that Stella, too, had been poisoned."</p>

  <p>"Exactly. I had very little doubt of it. And you notice that in this case
  there was available evidence of a kind that would be quite convincing to a
  jury&mdash;evidence obtainable from an examination of the victim's body. But
  here again I was disposed to adopt a waiting policy for three reasons.</p>

  <p>"First, I should have liked to avoid the exhumation if possible. Second,
  if the exhumation were unavoidable, I was unwilling to apply for it until I
  was certain that arsenic would be found in the body; and third, although the
  proof that Stella had been poisoned would have strengthened the case
  enormously against Barbara, it would yet have added nothing to the evidence
  that a poisoned candle had been used.</p>

  <p>"But the proof of the poisoned candle was the kernel of the case against
  Barbara. If I could prove that Stella had been poisoned by means of a candle,
  that would render the evidence absolutely irresistible. This I was not at
  present able to do. But I had some slight hopes that the deficiency might be
  made up, that some new facts might come into view if I waited. And, as there
  was nothing that called for immediate action, I decided to wait, and in due
  course, the deficiency was made up and the new facts did come into view."</p>

  <p>As he paused, I picked up Stella's medallion and looked at it with a new
  and sombre interest Holding it up before him, I said: "I am assuming,
  Thorndyke, that the new facts were in some way connected with this. Am I
  right?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied, "you are entirely right. The connection between that
  charming little work and the evidence that sent that monster of wickedness to
  her death is one of the strangest and most impressive circumstances that has
  become known to me in the whole of my experience. It is no exaggeration to
  say that when you and Stella were working on that medallion, you were forging
  the last link in the chain of evidence that could have dragged the murderess
  to the gallows."</p>

  <p>He paused, and, having replenished my glass, took the medallion in his
  hand and looked at it thoughtfully. Then he knocked out and refilled his pipe
  and I waited expectantly for the completion of this singular story.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch18"
     id="ch18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; THE FINAL PROOF</h2>

  <p class="first">"WE now," Thorndyke resumed, "enter the final stage of the
  inquiry. Hitherto we have dealt with purely scientific evidence which would
  have had to be communicated to the jury and which they would have had to take
  on trust with no convincing help from their own eyes. We had evidence,
  conclusive to ourselves, that Monkhouse had been murdered by means of a
  poisoned candle. But we could not produce the candle or any part of it. We
  had nothing visible or tangible to show to the jury to give them the feeling
  of confidence and firm conviction which they rightly demand when they have to
  decide an issue involving the life or death of the accused. It was this
  something that could be seen and handled that I sought, and sought in vain
  until that momentous evening when I called at your chambers to return your
  diary.</p>

  <p>"I remember that as I entered the room and cast my eyes over the things
  that were spread out on the table, I received quite a shock. For the first
  glance showed me that, amongst those things were two objects that exactly
  fulfilled the conditions of the final test. There was the wax mould&mdash;a
  part, and the greater part, of one of the suspected candles; and there was
  the tress of hair&mdash;a portion of the body of the person suspected to have
  been poisoned. With these two objects it was possible to determine with
  absolute certainty whether that person had or had not been poisoned with
  arsenic, and if she had, whether the candle had or had not been the medium by
  which the poison was administered."</p>

  <p>"But," I said, "you knew from the diary of the existence of the wax
  mould."</p>

  <p>"I knew that it had existed. But I naturally supposed that the cast had
  been taken and the mould destroyed years ago, though I had intended to ask
  you about it. However, here it was, miraculously preserved, against all
  probabilities, still awaiting completion. Of course, I recognized it
  instantly, and began to cast about in my mind for some means of making the
  necessary examination without disclosing my suspicions. For you will realize
  that I was unwilling to say anything to you about Stella's death until the
  question was settled one way or the other. If the examination had shown no
  arsenic either in the candle or in the hair, it would not have been necessary
  to say anything to you at all.</p>

  <p>"But while I was debating the matter, the problem solved itself. As soon
  as I came to look at Stella's unfinished works, I saw that they cried aloud
  to be completed and that Polton was the proper person to carry out the work.
  I made the suggestion, which I should have made in any case, and when you
  adopted it, I decided to say nothing but to apply the tests when the
  opportunity offered."</p>

  <p>"I am glad," said I, "to hear you say that you would have made the
  suggestion in any case. It looked at first like a rather cold-blooded pretext
  to get possession of the things. But you were speaking of the hair. Can you
  depend on finding recognizable traces of arsenic in the hair of a person who
  has been poisoned?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, you can," he replied. "The position is this: when arsenic is
  taken it becomes diffused throughout the whole body, including the blood, the
  bones and the skin. But as soon as a dose of arsenic is taken, the poison
  begins to be eliminated from the body, and, if no further dose is taken, the
  whole of the poison is thrown off in a comparatively short time until none
  remains in the tissues&mdash;with one exception. That exception is the
  epidermis, or outer skin, with its appendages&mdash;the finger and toe nails
  and the hair. These structures differ from all others in that, instead of
  growing interstitially and being alive throughout, they grow at a certain
  growing-point and then become practically dead structures. Thus a hair grows
  at the growing-point where the bulb joins the true skin. Each day a new piece
  of hair is produced at the living root, but when once it has come into being
  it grows no more, but is simply pushed up from below by the next portion.
  Thenceforward it undergoes no change, excepting that it gradually moves
  upwards as new portions are added at the root. It is virtually a dead,
  unchanging structure.</p>

  <p>"Now suppose a person to take a considerable dose of arsenic. That arsenic
  becomes diffused throughout all the living tissues and is for a time
  deposited in them. The growing-point of the hair is a living tissue and of
  course the arsenic becomes deposited in it. Then the process of elimination
  begins and the arsenic is gradually removed from the living tissues. But in
  twenty-four hours, what was the growing-point of the hair has been pushed up
  about the fiftieth of an inch and is no longer a growing structure. It is
  losing its vitality. And as it ceases to be a living tissue it ceases to be
  affected by the process of elimination. Hence the arsenic which was deposited
  in it when it was a living tissue is never removed. It remains as a permanent
  constituent of that part of the hair, slowly moving up as the hair grows from
  below, until at last it is snipped off by the barber; or, if the owner is a
  long-haired woman, it continues to creep along until the hair is full-grown
  and drops out."</p>

  <p>"Then the arsenic remains always in the same spot?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. It is a local deposit at a particular point in the hair. And this,
  Mayfield, is a most important fact, as you will see presently. For observe
  what follows. Hair grows at a uniform rate&mdash;roughly, a fiftieth of an
  inch in twenty-four hours. It is consequently possible, by measurement, to
  fix nearly exactly the age of any given point on a hair. Thus if we have a
  complete hair and we find at any point in it a deposit of arsenic, by
  measuring from that point to the root we can fix, within quite narrow limits,
  the date on which that dose of arsenic was taken."</p>

  <p>"But is it possible to do this?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Not in the case of a single hair," he replied. "But in the case of a
  tress, in which all the hairs are of the same age, it is perfectly possible.
  You will see the important bearing of this presently.</p>

  <p>"To return now to my investigation. I had the bulk of a candle and a tress
  of Stella's hair The questions to be settled were,</p>

  <p>"1. Was there arsenic in the candle? and</p>

  <p>"2. Had Stella been poisoned with arsenic?</p>

  <p>"I began by trimming the wax mould in readiness for casting and then I
  made an analysis of the trimmings. The result was the discovery of
  considerable quantities of arsenic in the wax.</p>

  <p>"That answered the first question. Next, as the tress of hair was larger
  than was required for your purpose, I ventured to sacrifice a portion of it
  for a preliminary test. That test also gave a positive result. The quantity
  of arsenic was, of course, very minute, but still it was measurable by the
  delicate methods that are possible in dealing with arsenic; and the amount
  that I found pointed either to one large dose or to repeated smaller
  ones.</p>

  <p>"The two questions were now answered definitely. It was certain&mdash;and
  the certainty could be demonstrated to a jury&mdash;that Stella had been
  poisoned by arsenic, and that the arsenic had been administered by means of
  poisoned candles. The complete proof in this case lent added weight to the
  less complete proof in the case of Monkhouse; and the two cases served to
  corroborate one another in pointing to Barbara as the poisoner. For she was
  the common factor in the two cases. The other persons&mdash;Wallingford,
  Madeline and the others&mdash;who appeared in the Monkhouse case, made no
  appearance in the case of Stella; and the persons who were associated with
  Stella were not associated with Monkhouse. But Barbara was associated with
  both. And her absence from home was no answer to the charge if death was
  caused by the candles which she had admittedly supplied.</p>

  <p>"But complete as the proof was, I wished, if possible, to make it yet more
  complete: to associate Barbara still more definitely with the crime. In the
  case of Monkhouse, it was clear that the poisoning always occurred when she
  was absent from home. But this was not so clear in the case of Stella. Your
  diary showed that Stella's relapses coincided pretty regularly with Barbara's
  absences; but it was not certain (though obviously probable) that the
  relapses coincided with the periods of poisoning. If it could be proved that
  they did coincide, that proof would furnish corroboration of the greatest
  possible weight. It would show that the two cases were parallel in all
  respects.</p>

  <p>"But could it be proved? If the tress of Stella's hair had been at my
  disposal, I had no doubt that I could have decided the question. But the
  tress was yours, and it had to be preserved. Whatever was to be done must be
  done without destroying or injuring the hair, and I set myself the task of
  finding some practicable method. Eventually, I decided, without much hope of
  success, to try the X-rays. As arsenic is a fairly dense metal and the
  quantity of it in the deposits quite considerable, it seemed to me possible
  that it might increase the density of the hairs at those points sufficiently
  to affect the X-ray shadow. At any rate, I decided to give the method a
  trial.</p>

  <p>"Accordingly, Polton and I set to work at it. First, in order to get the
  densest shadow possible, we made the tress up into a close cylinder,
  carefully arranging it so that all the cut ends were in exactly the same
  plane. Then we made a number of graduated exposures on 'process' plates,
  developing and intensifying with the object of getting the greatest possible
  degree of contrast. The result was unexpectedly successful. In the best
  negative, the shape of the tress was faintly visible and was soon to be
  crossed by a number of perfectly distinct pale bands. Those bands were the
  shadows of the deposits of arsenic. There could be no doubt on the subject.
  For, apart from the fact that there was nothing else that they could be,
  their appearance agreed exactly with what one would have expected. Each band
  presented a sharp, distinct edge towards the tips of the hairs and faded away
  imperceptibly towards the roots. The sharp edge corresponded to the sudden
  appearance of arsenic in the blood when the poisoning began. The gradual
  fading-away corresponded to the period of elimination when the poisoning had
  ceased and the quantity of arsenic in the blood was becoming less and less
  from day to day.</p>

  <p>"Now, since hair grows at a known, uniform rate, it was possible to
  convert the distances between these arsenical bands into periods of time; not
  with perfect exactness, because the rate of growth varies slightly in
  different persons, but with sufficient exactness for our present purpose. As
  soon as I looked at those bands, I saw that they told the whole story. But
  let us follow the method of proof.</p>

  <p>"Assuming the rate of growth to be one fiftieth of an inch in twenty-four
  hours&mdash;which was probably correct for a person of Stella's age&mdash;I
  measured off on the photograph seven inches and a quarter from the cut ends
  as representing the last year of her life. Of course, I did not know how
  close to the head the hair had been cut, but, judging by the bands, I assumed
  that it had been cut quite close to the skin-within a quarter of an
  inch."</p>

  <p>"I happen to know that you were quite right," said I, "but I can't imagine
  how you arrived at your conclusion."</p>

  <p>"It was quite a simple inference," he replied, "as you will see,
  presently. But to return to the photograph. Of the measured space of seven
  inches and a quarter I took a tracing on sheet celluloid, marking the sharp
  edges of the bands, the points at which the fading began and the points at
  which the band ceased to be visible. This tracing I transferred to paper
  ruled in tenths of an inch&mdash;a tenth of an inch representing five
  days&mdash;and I joined the points where the fading began and ended by a
  sloping line. I now had a diagram, or chart, which showed, with something
  approaching to accuracy, the duration of each administration of arsenic and
  the time which elapsed between the successive poisonings. This is the chart.
  The sloping lines show the fading of the bands."</p>

  <p>He handed me a paper which he had just taken from a drawer and I looked at
  it curiously but with no great interest. As I returned it after a brief
  inspection I remarked: "It is quite clear and intelligible, but I don't quite
  see why you took the considerable trouble of making it. Does it show anything
  that could not be stated in a few words?"</p>

  <p>"Not by itself," he replied. "But you remember that I mentioned having
  made two other charts, one showing the fluctuations in Stella's illness and
  the other showing Barbara's absences from home during the same period. Here
  are those other two charts; and now, if you put the three together, your eye
  can take in at a glance a fact of fundamental importance; which is that the
  relapses, the absences and the poisonings all coincided in time. The
  periodicity is strikingly irregular; but it is identical in all three charts.
  I made these to hand to the jury, and I think they would have been quite
  convincing, since any juryman could check them by the dates given in
  evidence, and by inspection of the radiograph of the hair."</p>

  <p>EXPLANATION OF THE CHARTS</p>

  <p>CHART A shows the fluctuations in the illness of Stella Keene during the
  year preceding her death in October. Divided into intervals of five days.</p>

  <p>CHART B shows the distribution of the arsenical bands in Stella Keene's
  hair. The steep sides of the curves, towards the tips of the hairs, show the
  sudden appearance of the deposit, and the sloping sides, towards the roots of
  the hairs, represent its more gradual fading. Each of the narrow divisions
  represents five days' growth.</p>

  <p>CHART C shows the periods during which Barbara was absent from home, each
  absence being represented by a black column. Divided into intervals of five
  days.</p>

  <p>I gazed at the three charts and was profoundly impressed by the convincing
  way in which they demonstrated the connection between Barbara's movements and
  the results of her diabolical activities. But what impressed me still more
  was the amazing ingenuity with which Thorndyke had contrived to build up a
  case of the most deadly precision and completeness out of what seemed, even
  to my trained intelligence, no more than a few chance facts, apparently quite
  trivial and irrelevant.</p>

  <p>"It seems," I said, "that, so far as you were concerned, the exhumation
  was really unnecessary."</p>

  <p>"Quite," he replied. "It proved nothing that was not already certain.
  Still, the Commissioner was quite right. For the purposes of a trial,
  evidence obtained from the actual body of the victim is of immeasurably more
  weight than indirect scientific evidence, no matter how complete. An ordinary
  juryman might have difficulty in realizing that the hair is part of the body
  and that proof of arsenical deposit in the hair is proof of arsenic in the
  body. But the mistake that he made, as events turned out, was in refusing to
  make the arrest until my statements had been confirmed by the autopsy and the
  analysis. That delay allowed the criminal to escape. Not that I complain. To
  me, personally, her suicide came as a blessed release from an almost
  intolerable position. But if I had been in his place, I would have taken no
  chances. She would have gone to trial and to the gallows."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I admitted; "that was what justice demanded. But I cannot be
  thankful enough for the delay that let her escape. Fiend as she was, it would
  have been a frightful thing to have had to give the evidence that would have
  hanged her."</p>

  <p>"It would," he agreed; "and the thought of it was a nightmare to me.
  However, we have escaped that; and after all, justice has been done."</p>

  <p>We were silent for a few minutes, during which Thorndyke smoked his pipe
  with a certain air of attention as it he expected me to put some further
  questions. And, in fact, there were one or two questions that I wanted to
  have answered. I began with the simplest.</p>

  <p>"I am still a little puzzled by some of the circumstances in this case.
  The infernal machine I happen to know to have been sent by Barbara, though I
  don't understand why she sent it. But Wallingford's proceedings are a
  complete mystery to me. What do you suppose induced him to keep a watch on
  you in that extraordinary fashion? And who was the man who shadowed him?
  There certainly was such a man, for I saw him, myself. And the same man had
  been shadowing Miss Norris. What do you make of it all?"</p>

  <p>"One can only reason from past experiences," he replied. "It seems to be a
  rule that a person who has committed a crime cannot remain quiet and let
  things take their course. There appears to be an irresistible impulse to lay
  down false clues and create misleading appearances. It is always a mistake,
  unless the false clues are laid down in advance, and even then it is apt to
  fail and unexpectedly furnish a real clue.</p>

  <p>"Now Barbara, with all her astonishing cleverness, made that mistake. She
  laid down a false clue in advance by her absences from home, and the trick
  certainly worked successfully at the inquest. But it was precisely those
  absences that put me on the track of the candle, which otherwise might have
  passed unsuspected. The faked medicine was another false clue which attracted
  my attention and added to my suspicion concerning the candle. Then, after the
  event came these other endeavours to mislead. They did neither harm nor good,
  as it happened, since I had already marked her down as the principal suspect.
  But if I had been in doubt, I should have followed up those clues and found
  her at the end of them.</p>

  <p>"As to Wallingford, I imagine that she led him to believe that I was
  employed by you to fix the crime on him and that he was advised to watch me
  and be ready to anticipate any move on my part; her actual object being to
  cause him to behave in such a manner as to attract suspicious attention. The
  function of the private detective&mdash;for that is what he must have
  been&mdash;would be to keep Wallingford's nerves&mdash;and Miss Norris',
  too&mdash;in such a state that they would appear anxious and terrified and
  tend to attract attention. The infernal machine was primarily intended, I
  think, to cast suspicion on one or both of them.</p>

  <p>"That was what I inferred from the total absence of finger-prints and the
  flagrantly identifiable character of the pistol and the wool.</p>

  <p>"But the greatest, the most fatal mistake that Barbara made was the one
  that is absolutely characteristic of the criminal. She repeated the procedure
  of a previous crime that had been successful. It was that repetition that was
  her undoing. Either crime, separately, might have been difficult to fix on
  her. As it was, each crime was proof of the other."</p>

  <p>Once more we fell silent; and still Thorndyke had the air of expecting
  some further question from me. I looked at him nervously; for there was
  something that I wanted to ask and yet I hardly dared to put it into words.
  For, as I had looked at those charts, a horrid suspicion had taken hold of
  me. I feared to have it confirmed, and yet I could not let it rest. At last,
  I summoned courage enough to put the question.</p>

  <p>"Thorndyke," I said, "I want you to tell me something. I expect you know
  what it is."</p>

  <p>He looked up and nodded gravely.</p>

  <p>"You mean about Stella?" said he.</p>

  <p>"Yes. How long would she have lived if she had not been poisoned?"</p>

  <p>He looked away for a few moments, and, impassive as his face was, I could
  see that he was deeply moved. At length he replied: "I was afraid you were
  going to ask me that. But since you have, I can only answer you honestly. So
  far as I can judge, but for that accursed ghoul, the poor girl might have
  been alive and well at this moment."</p>

  <p>I stared at him in amazement. "Do you mean," I demanded, "that she was not
  really suffering from consumption at all?"</p>

  <p>"That is what it amounts to," he replied. "There were signs of old
  tubercular trouble, but there was nothing recent. Evidently she had good
  powers of resistance, and the disease had not only become stationary, but was
  practically extinct. The old lesions had undergone complete repair, and there
  is no reason to suppose that any recurrence would have taken place under
  ordinary conditions."</p>

  <p>"But," I exclaimed, hardly able to believe that the disaster had been so
  overwhelmingly complete, "what about the cough? I know that she always had a
  more or less troublesome cough."</p>

  <p>"So had Monkhouse," he replied; "and so would anyone have had whose lungs
  were periodically irritated by inhaling particles of arsenious acid. But the
  tubercular mischief was quite limited and recovery must have commenced early.
  And Barbara, watching eagerly the symptoms of the disease which was to rid
  her of her rival, must have noted with despair the signs of commencing
  recovery and at last resolved to do for herself what nature was failing to
  do. Doubtless, the special method of poisoning was devised to imitate the
  symptoms of the disease; which it did well enough to deceive those whose
  minds were prepared by the antecedent illness to receive the suggestion. It
  was a horribly, fiendishly ingenious crime; calmly, callously devised and
  carried out to its appalling end with the most hideous efficiency."</p>

  <p>After he had finished speaking, I remained gazing at him dumbly,
  stupefied, stunned by the realization of the enormity of this frightful thing
  that had befallen. He, too, seemed quite overcome, for he sat silently,
  grasping his extinct pipe and looking sternly and fixedly into the fire. At
  length he spoke, but without removing his gaze from the bright embers.</p>

  <p>"I am trying, Mayfield," he said, gently, "to think of something to say to
  you. But there is nothing to say. The disaster is too complete, too
  irretrievable. This terrible woman has, so far, wrecked your life, and I
  recognize that you will carry the burden of your loss so long as you live. It
  would be a mere impertinence to utter futile and banal condolences. You know
  what I, your friend, am feeling and I need say no more of that; and I have
  too much confidence in your wisdom and courage to think of exhortations.</p>

  <p>"But, though you have been robbed of the future that might have been,
  there is still a future that may be. It remains to you now only to shoulder
  your fardel and begin your pilgrimage anew; and if the road shall seem at
  first a dreary one, you need not travel it alone. You have friends; and one
  of them will think it a privilege to bear you company and try to hearten you
  by the way."</p>

  <p>He held out his hand and I grasped it silently and with a full heart. And
  the closer friendship that was inaugurated in that hand-clasp has endured
  through the passing years, ever more precious and more helpful.</p>
