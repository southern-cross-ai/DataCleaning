  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>CHAPTER 1</h2>

  <p class="first">MR. SEPTIMUS SALTER pressed the bell on his table for the
  third time and uttered a soft growl.</p>

  <p>He was a stout, elderly man, and with his big red face and white
  side-whiskers, looked more like a prosperous farmer than a successful lawyer.
  The cut of his clothes was queerly out of date, the high white collar and the
  black satin cravat that bulged above a flowered waistcoat were of the fashion
  of 1850, in which year Mr. Salter was a little ahead of his time so far as
  fashions were concerned. But the years had caught him up and passed him, and
  although there was not a more up-to-date solicitor in London, he remained
  faithful to the style in which he had made a reputation as a "buck."</p>

  <p>He pressed the bell again, this time impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Confound the fellow!" he muttered, and rising to his feet, he stalked
  into the little room where his secretary was usually to be found.</p>

  <p>He had expected to find the apartment empty, but it was not. A chair had
  been drawn sideways up to the big ink-stained table, and kneeling on this,
  his elbows on the table, his face between his hands, was a young man who was
  absorbed in the perusal of a document, one of the many which littered the
  table.</p>

  <p>"Steele!" said Mr. Salter sharply, and the reader looked up with a start
  and sprang to his feet.</p>

  <p>He was taller than the average and broad of shoulder, though he gave an
  impression of litheness. His tanned face spoke eloquently of days spent out
  of doors, the straight nose, the firm mouth, and the strong chin were all
  part of the characteristic "soldier face" moulded by four years of war into a
  semblance of hardness.</p>

  <p>Now he was a little confused, more like the guilty school-boy than the
  V.C. who had tackled eight enemy aeroplanes, and had come back to his
  aerodrome with a dozen bullets in his body.</p>

  <p>"Really, Steele," said Mr. Salter reproachfully, "you are too bad. I have
  rung the bell three times for you."</p>

  <p>"I'm awfully sorry, sir," said Jim Steele, and that disarming smile of his
  went straight to the old man's heart.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing here?" growled Mr. Salter, looking at the papers on
  the desk, and then with a "tut" of impatience, "Aren't you tired of going
  over the Danton case?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, I'm not," said Steele quietly. "I have a feeling that Lady Mary
  Danton can be found, and I think if she is found there will be a very
  satisfactory explanation for her disappearance, and one which will rather
  disconcert - " He stopped, fearful of committing an indiscretion.</p>

  <p>Mr. Salter looked at him keenly and helped himself to a pinch of
  snuff.</p>

  <p>"You don't like Mr. Groat?" he asked, and Jim laughed.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, it's not for me to like him or dislike him," he replied.
  "Personally, I've no use for that kind of person. The only excuse a man of
  thirty can produce for not having been in the war, is that he was dead at the
  time."</p>

  <p>"He had a weak heart," suggested Mr. Salter, but without any great
  conviction.</p>

  <p>"I think he had," said Jim with a little twist of his lips. "We used to
  call it a 'poor heart' in the army. It made men go sick on the eve of a
  battle, and drove them into dug-outs when they should have been advancing
  across the open with their comrades."</p>

  <p>Mr. Salter looked down at the papers.</p>

  <p>"Put them away, Steele," he said quietly. "You're not going to get any
  satisfaction out of the search for a woman who - why, she must have
  disappeared when you were a child of five."</p>

  <p>"I wish, sir - " began Steele, and hesitated. "Of course, it's really no
  business of mine," he smiled, "and I've no right to ask you, but I'd like to
  hear more details of that disappearance if you can spare me the time - and if
  you feel inclined. I've never had the courage to question you before. What is
  the real story of her disappearance?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Salter frowned, and then the frown was gradually replaced by a
  smile.</p>

  <p>"I think, Steele, you're the worst secretary I ever had," he said in
  despair. "And if I weren't your godfather and morally bound to help you, I
  should write you a polite little note saying your services were not required
  after the end of this week."</p>

  <p>Jim Steele laughed.</p>

  <p>"I have expected that ever since I've been here," he said.</p>

  <p>There was a twinkle in the old lawyer's eyes. He was secretly fond of Jim
  Steele; fonder than the boy could have imagined. But it was not only
  friendship and a sense of duty that held Jim down in his job. The young man
  was useful, and, despite his seeming inability to hear bells when he was
  wrapped up in his favourite study, most reliable.</p>

  <p>"Shut that door," he said gruffly, and when the other had obeyed, "I'm
  telling this story to you," and he pointed a warning finger at Jim Steele,
  "not because I want to satisfy your curiosity, but because I hope that I'm
  going to kill all interest in the Danton mystery as you call it for evermore!
  Lady Mary Danton was the only daughter of the Earl of Plimstock - a title
  which is now extinct. She married, when she was quite a young girl, Jonathan
  Danton, a millionaire shipowner, and the marriage was not a success. Jonathan
  was a hard, sour man, and a sick man, too. You talk about Digby Groat having
  a bad heart, well, Jonathan had a real bad one. I think his ill-health was
  partly responsible for his harsh treatment of his wife. At any rate, the baby
  that was born to them, a girl, did not seem to bring them together - in fact,
  they grew farther apart. Danton had to go to America on business. Before he
  left, he came to this office and, sitting at that very table, he signed a
  will, one of the most extraordinary wills that I have ever had engrossed. He
  left the whole of his fortune to his daughter Dorothy, who was then three or
  four months old. In the event of her death, he provided that the money should
  go to his sister, Mrs. Groat, but not until twenty years after the date of
  the child's death. In the meantime Mrs. Groat was entitled to enjoy the
  income from the estate."</p>

  <p>"Why did he do that?" asked Jim, puzzled.</p>

  <p>"I think that is easily understood," said Mr. Salter. "He was providing
  against the child's death in its infancy, and he foresaw that the will might
  be contested by Lady Mary. As it was drawn up - I haven't explained all the
  details - it could not be so contested for twenty years. However, it was not
  contested," he said quietly. "Whilst Danton was in America, Lady Mary
  disappeared, and with her the baby. Nobody knew where she went to, but the
  baby and a strange nurse, who for some reason or other had care of the child,
  were traced to Margate. Possibly Lady Mary was there too, though we have no
  evidence of this. We do know that the nurse, who was the daughter of a
  fisherman and could handle a boat, took the child out on the sea one summer
  day and was overtaken by a fog. All the evidence shows that the little boat
  was run down by a liner, and its battered wreck was picked up at sea, and a
  week later the body of the nurse was recovered. We never knew what became of
  Lady Mary. Danton returned a day or two after the tragedy, and the news was
  broken to him by Mrs. Groat, his sister. It killed him."</p>

  <p>"And Lady Mary was never seen again?"</p>

  <p>Salter shook his head.</p>

  <p>"So you see, my boy," he rose, and dropped his hand on the other's
  shoulder, "even if by a miracle you could find Lady Mary, you could not in
  any way affect the position of Mrs. Groat, or her son. There is only one tiny
  actress in this drama who could ever have benefited by Jonathan Danton's
  will, and she," he lowered his voice until it was little more than a whisper,
  "she is beyond recall - beyond recall!"</p>

  <p>There was a moment of silence.</p>

  <p>"I realize that, sir," said Jim Steele quietly, "only - "</p>

  <p>"Only what?"</p>

  <p>"I have a queer feeling that there is something wrong about the whole
  business, and I believe that if I gave my time to the task I could unveil
  this mystery."</p>

  <p>Mr. Salter looked at his secretary sharply, but Jim Steele met his eyes
  without faltering.</p>

  <p>"You ought to be a detective," he said ironically.</p>

  <p>"I wish to heaven I was," was the unexpected reply. "I offered my services
  to Scotland Yard two years ago when the Thirteen Gangs were holding up the
  banks with impunity."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you did, did you?" said the lawyer sarcastically as he opened the
  door, and then suddenly he turned. "Why did I ring for you?" he asked. "Oh, I
  remember! I want you to get out all those Danton leases of the Cumberland
  property."</p>

  <p>"Is Mrs. Groat selling?" asked Steele.</p>

  <p>"She can't sell yet," said the lawyer, "but on the thirtieth of May,
  providing a caveat is not entered, she takes control of the Danton
  millions."</p>

  <p>"Or her son does," said Jim significantly. He had followed his employer
  back to the big private office with its tiers of deed boxes, its worn
  furniture and threadbare carpet and general air of mustiness.</p>

  <p>"A detective, eh?" snorted Mr. Salter as he sat down at his table. "And
  what is your equipment for your new profession?"</p>

  <p>Jim smiled, but there was an unusual look in his face.</p>

  <p>"Faith," he said quietly.</p>

  <p>"Faith? What is faith to a detective?" asked the startled Salter.</p>

  <p>"'Faith is the substance of things hoped for; the evidence of things
  unseen.'" Jim quoted the passage almost solemnly, and for a long time Mr.
  Salter did not speak. Then he took up a slip of paper on which he had
  scribbled some notes, and passed it across to Jim.</p>

  <p>"See if you can 'detect' these deeds, they are in the strong-room," he
  said, but in spite of his jesting words he was impressed.</p>

  <p>Jim took up the slip, examined it, and was about to speak when there came
  a tap at the door and a clerk slipped into the room.</p>

  <p>"Will you see Mr. Digby Groat, sir?" he asked.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>CHAPTER 2</h2>

  <p class="first">MR. SALTER glanced up with a humorous glint in his eye.
  "Yes," he said with a nod, and then to Jim as he was about to make a hurried
  exit, "you can wait, Steele. Mr. Groat wrote in his letter that he wanted to
  see the deeds, and you may have to conduct him to the strong-room."</p>

  <p>Jim Steele said nothing.</p>

  <p>Presently the clerk opened the door and a young man walked in.</p>

  <p>Jim had seen him before and had liked him less every time he had met him.
  The oblong sallow face, with its short black moustache, the sleepy eyes, and
  rather large chin and prominent ears, he could have painted, if he were an
  artist, with his eyes shut. And yet Digby Groat was good-looking. Even Jim
  could not deny that. He was a credit to his valet. From the top of his
  pomaded head to his patent shoes he was an exquisite. His morning coat was of
  the most fashionable cut and fitted him perfectly. One could have used the
  silk hat he carried in his hand as a mirror, and as he came into the room
  exuding a delicate aroma of Quelques Fleurs, Jim's nose curled. He hated men
  who scented themselves, however daintily the process was carried out.</p>

  <p>Digby Groat looked from the lawyer to Steele with that languid, almost
  insolent look in his dark eyes, which the lawyer hated as much as his
  secretary.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Salter," he said.</p>

  <p>He took a silk handkerchief from his pocket and, dusting a chair, sat down
  uninvited, resting his lemon-gloved hands upon a gold-headed ebony cane.</p>

  <p>"You know Mr. Steele, my secretary," said Salter.</p>

  <p>The other nodded his glossy head.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, he's a Victoria Cross person, isn't he?" he asked wearily. "I
  suppose you find it very dull here, Steele? A place like this would bore me
  to death."</p>

  <p>"I suppose it would," said Jim, "but if you'd had four years' excitement
  of war, you would welcome this place as a calm haven of rest."</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," said the other shortly. He was not too well pleased by
  Jim's reference to the fact that he had escaped the trials of war.</p>

  <p>"Now, Dr. Groat - " but the other stopped him with a gesture.</p>

  <p>"Please don't call me 'doctor,'" he said with a pained expression. "The
  fact that I have been through the medical schools and have gained my degrees
  in surgery is one which I wish you would forget. I qualified for my own
  amusement, and if people get into the habit of thinking of me as a doctor, I
  shall be called up all hours of the night by all sorts of wretched
  patients."</p>

  <p>It was news to Jim that this sallow dandy had graduated in medicines.</p>

  <p>"I came to see those Lakeside leases, Salter," Groat went on. "I have had
  an offer - I should say, my mother has had an offer - from a syndicate which
  is erecting an hotel upon her property. I understand there is some clause in
  the lease which prevents building operations of that character. If so, it was
  beastly thoughtless of old Danton to acquire such a property."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Danton did nothing either thoughtless or beastly thoughtless," said
  Salter quietly, "and if you had mentioned it in your letter, I could have
  telephoned you the information and saved your calling. As it is, Steele will
  take you to the strong-room, and you can examine the leases at your
  leisure."</p>

  <p>Groat looked at Jim sceptically.</p>

  <p>"Does he know anything about leases?" he asked. "And must I really descend
  into your infernal cellar and catch my death of cold? Can't the leases be
  brought up for me?"</p>

  <p>"If you will go into Mr. Steele's room, I dare say he will bring them to
  you," said Salter, who did not like his client any more than Jim did.
  Moreover, he had a shrewd suspicion that the moment the Groats gained
  possession of the Danton fortune, they would find another lawyer to look
  after their affairs.</p>

  <p>Jim took the keys and returned with an armful of deeds, to discover that
  Groat was no longer with his chief.</p>

  <p>"I sent him into your room," said Salter. "Take the leases in and explain
  them to him. If there's anything you want to know, I'll come in."</p>

  <p>Jim found the young man in his room. He was examining a book he had taken
  from a shelf.</p>

  <p>"What does 'dactylology' mean?" he asked, looking round as Jim came in. "I
  see you have a book on the subject."</p>

  <p>"Finger-prints," said Jim Steele briefly. He hated the calm proprietorial
  attitude of the man, and, moreover, Mr. Groat was examining his own private
  library.</p>

  <p>"Finger-prints, eh?" said Groat, replacing the book. "Are you interested
  in finger-prints?"</p>

  <p>"A little," said Jim. "Here are the Lakeside leases, Mr. Groat. I made a
  sketchy examination of them in the strong-room and there seems to be no
  clause preventing the erection of the building you mention."</p>

  <p>Groat took the document in his hand and turned it leaf by leaf.</p>

  <p>"No," he said at last, and then, putting down the document, "so you're
  interested in finger-prints, eh? I didn't know old Salter did a criminal
  business."</p>

  <p>"He has very little common law practice," said Jim.</p>

  <p>"What are these?" asked Groat.</p>

  <p>By the side of Jim's desk was a bookshelf filled with thick black exercise
  books.</p>

  <p>"Those are my private notes," said Jim, and the other looked round with a
  sneering smile.</p>

  <p>"What the devil have you got to make notes about, I wonder?" he asked, and
  before Jim could stop him, he had taken one of the exercise books down.</p>

  <p>"If you don't mind," said Jim firmly, "I would rather you left my private
  property alone."</p>

  <p>"Sorry, but I thought everything in old Salter's office had to do with his
  clients."</p>

  <p>"You're not the only client," said Jim. He was not one to lose his temper,
  but this insolent man was trying his patience sorely.</p>

  <p>"What is it all about?" asked the languid Groat, as he turned one
  page.</p>

  <p>Jim, standing at the other side of the table watching him, saw a touch of
  colour come into the man's yellow face. The black eyes hardened and his
  languid interest dropped away like a cloak.</p>

  <p>"What is this?" he asked sharply. "What the hell are you - "</p>

  <p>He checked himself with a great effort and laughed, but the laugh was
  harsh and artificial.</p>

  <p>"You're a wonderful fellow, Steele," he said with a return to his old air
  of insouciance. "Fancy bothering your head about things of that sort."</p>

  <p>He put the book back where he had found it, picked up another of the
  leases and appeared to be reading it intently, but Jim, watching him, saw
  that he was not reading, even though he turned page after page.</p>

  <p>"That is all right," he said at last, putting the lease down and taking up
  his top-hat. "Some day perhaps you will come and dine with us, Steele. I've
  had rather a stunning laboratory built at the back of our house in Grosvenor
  Square. Old Salter called me doctor!" He chuckled quietly as though at a big
  joke. "Well, if you come along, I will show you something that will at least
  justify the title."</p>

  <p>The dark brown eyes were fixed steadily upon Jim as he stood in the
  doorway, one yellow-gloved hand on the handle.</p>

  <p>"And, by the way, Mr. Steele," he drawled, "your studies are leading you
  into a danger zone for which even a second Victoria Cross could not
  adequately compensate you."</p>

  <p>He closed the door carefully behind him, and Jim Steele frowned after
  him.</p>

  <p>"What the dickens does he mean?" he asked, and then remembered the
  exercise book through which Groat had glanced, and which had had so strange
  an effect upon him. He took the book down from the shelf and turning to the
  first page, read: "Some notes upon the Thirteen Gang."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>CHAPTER 3</h2>

  <p class="first">THAT afternoon Jim Steele went into Mr. Salter's office.
  "I'm going to tea now, sir," he said.</p>

  <p>Mr. Salter glanced up at the solemn-faced clock that ticked audibly on the
  opposite wall.</p>

  <p>"All right," he grumbled; "but you're a very punctual tea-drinker, Steele.
  What are you blushing about - is it a girl?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir," said Jim rather loudly. "I sometimes meet a lady at tea, but -
  "</p>

  <p>"Off you go," said the old man gruffly. "And give her my love."</p>

  <p>Jim was grinning, but he was very red, too, when he went down the stairs
  into Marlborough Street. He hurried his pace because he was a little late,
  and breathed a sigh of relief as he turned into the quiet tea-shop to find
  that his table was as yet unoccupied.</p>

  <p>As his tall, athletic figure strode through the room to the little recess
  overlooking Regent Street, which was reserved for privileged customers, many
  heads were turned, for Jim Steele was a splendid figure of British manhood,
  and the grey laughing eyes had played havoc in many a tender heart.</p>

  <p>But he was one of those men whose very idealism forbade trifling. He had
  gone straight from a public school into the tragic theatre of conflict, and
  at an age when most young men were dancing attendance upon women, his soul
  was being seared by the red-hot irons of war.</p>

  <p>He sat down at the table and the beaming waitress came forward to attend
  to his needs.</p>

  <p>"Your young lady hasn't come yet, sir," she said.</p>

  <p>It was the first time she had made such a reference to Eunice Weldon, and
  Jim stiffened.</p>

  <p>"The young lady who has tea with me is not my 'young lady,'" he said a
  little coldly, and seeing that he had hurt the girl, he added with a gleam of
  mirth in those irresistible eyes, "she's your young lady, really."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," said the waitress, scribbling on her order pad to hide her
  confusion. "I suppose you'll have the usual?"</p>

  <p>"I'll have the usual," said Jim gravely, and then with a quick glance at
  the door he rose to meet the girl who had at that moment entered.</p>

  <p>She was slim of build, straight as a plummet line from chin to toe; she
  carried herself with a dignity which was so natural that the men who haunt
  the pavement to leer and importune, stood on one side to let her pass, and
  then, after a glimpse of her face, cursed their own timidity. For it was a
  face Madonna-like in its purity. But a blue-eyed, cherry-lipped Madonna,
  vital and challenging. A bud of a girl breaking into the summer bloom of
  existence. In those sapphire eyes the beacon fires of life signalled her
  womanhood; they were at once a plea and a warning. Yet she carried the
  banners of childhood no less triumphantly. The sensitive mouth, the round,
  girlish chin, the satin white throat and clean, transparent skin, unmarked,
  unblemished, these were the gifts of youth which were carried forward to the
  account of her charm.</p>

  <p>Her eyes met Jim's and she came forward with outstretched hand.</p>

  <p>"I'm late," she said gaily. "We had a tiresome duchess at the studio who
  wanted to be taken in seventeen different poses - it is always the plain
  people who give the most trouble."</p>

  <p>She sat down and stripped her gloves, with a smile at the waitress.</p>

  <p>"The only chance that plain people have of looking beautiful is to be
  photographed beautifully," said Jim.</p>

  <p>Eunice Weldon was working at a fashionable photographer's in Regent
  Street. Jim's meeting with her had been in the very room in which they were
  now sitting. The hangings at the window had accidentally caught fire, and
  Jim, in extinguishing them, had burnt his hand. It was Eunice Weldon who had
  dressed the injury.</p>

  <p>A service rendered by a man to a woman may not lead very much farther to a
  better acquaintance. When a woman helps a man it is invariably the beginning
  of a friendship. Women are suspicious of the services which men give, and yet
  feel responsible for the man they have helped, even to the slightest
  extent.</p>

  <p>Since then they had met almost daily and taken tea together. Once Jim had
  asked her to go to a theatre, an invitation which she had promptly but kindly
  declined. Thereafter he had made no further attempt to improve their
  acquaintance.</p>

  <p>"And how have you got on with your search for the missing lady?" she
  asked, as she spread some jam on the thin bread-and-butter which the waitress
  had brought.</p>

  <p>Jim's nose wrinkled - a characteristic grimace of his.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Salter made it clear to me to-day that even if I found the missing
  lady it wouldn't greatly improve matters," he said.</p>

  <p>"It would be wonderful if the child had been saved after all," she said.
  "Have you ever thought of that possibility?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"There is no hope of that." he said, shaking his head, "but it would be
  wonderful, as you say, and more wonderful," he laughed, "if you were the
  missing heiress!"</p>

  <p>"And there's no hope of that either." she said, shaking her head. "I'm the
  daughter of poor but honest parents, as the story-books say."</p>

  <p>"Your father was a South African, wasn't he?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Poor daddy was a musician, and mother I can hardly remember, but she must
  have been a dear."</p>

  <p>"Where were you born?" asked Jim.</p>

  <p>She did not answer immediately because she was busy with her jam
  sandwich.</p>

  <p>"In Cape Town - Rondebosch, to be exact," she said after a while. "Why are
  you so keen on finding your long-lost lady?"</p>

  <p>"Because I am anxious that the most unmitigated cad in the world should
  not succeed to the Danton millions."</p>

  <p>She sat bolt upright.</p>

  <p>"The Danton millions?" she repeated slowly. "Then who is your unmitigated
  cad? You have never yet mentioned the names of these people."</p>

  <p>This was perfectly true. Jim Steele had not even spoken of his search
  until a few days before.</p>

  <p>"A man named Digby Groat."</p>

  <p>She stared at him aghast.</p>

  <p>"Why, what's the matter?" he asked in surprise.</p>

  <p>"When you said 'Danton' I remembered Mr. Curley - that is our chief
  photographer - saying that Mrs. Groat was the sister of Jonathan Danton?" she
  said slowly.</p>

  <p>"Do you know the Groats?" he asked quickly.</p>

  <p>"I don't know them," she said slowly, "at least, not very well, only - "
  she hesitated, "I'm going to be Mrs. Groat's secretary."</p>

  <p>He stared at her.</p>

  <p>"You never told me this," he said, and as she dropped her eyes to her
  plate, he realized that he had made a faux pas. "Of course," he said
  hurriedly, "there's no reason why you should tell me, but - "</p>

  <p>"It only happened to-day," she said. "Mr. Groat has had some photographs
  taken - his mother came with him to the studio. She's been several times, and
  I scarcely noticed them until to-day, when Mr. Curley called me into the
  office and said that Mrs. Groat was in need of a secretary and that it was a
  very good position; £5 a week, which is practically all profit, because I
  should live in the house."</p>

  <p>"When did Mrs. Groat decide that she wanted a secretary?" asked Jim, and
  it was her turn to stare.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Why do you ask that?"</p>

  <p>"She was at our office a month ago," said Jim, "and Mr. Salter suggested
  that she should have a secretary to keep her accounts in order. She said then
  she hated the idea of having anybody in the house who was neither a servant
  nor a friend of the family."</p>

  <p>"Well, she's changed her views now," smiled the girl.</p>

  <p>"This means that we shan't meet at tea any more. When are you going?"</p>

  <p>"To-morrow," was the discouraging reply.</p>

  <p>He went back to his office more than a little dispirited. Something deep
  and vital seemed to have gone out of his life.</p>

  <p>"You're in love, you fool," he growled to himself.</p>

  <p>He opened the big diary which it was his business to keep and slammed down
  the covers savagely.</p>

  <p>Mr. Salter had gone home. He always went home early, and Jim lit his pipe
  and began to enter up the day's transactions from the scribbled notes which
  his chief had left on his desk.</p>

  <p>He had made the last entry and was making a final search of the desk for
  some scrap which he might have overlooked.</p>

  <p>Mr. Salter's desk was usually tidy, but he had a habit of concealing
  important memoranda, and Jim turned over the law books on the table in a
  search for any scribbled memo he might have missed. He found between two
  volumes a thin gilt-edged notebook, which he did not remember having seen
  before. He opened it to discover that it was a diary for the year 1901. Mr.
  Salter was in the habit of making notes for his own private reading, using a
  queer legal shorthand which no clerk had ever been able to decipher. The
  entries in the diary were in these characters.</p>

  <p>Jim turned the leaves curiously, wondering how so methodical a man as the
  lawyer had left a private diary visible. He knew that in the big green safe
  in the lawyer's office were stacks of these books, and possibly the old man
  had taken one out to refresh his memory. The writing was Greek to Jim, so
  that he felt no compunction in turning the pages, filled as they were with
  indecipherable and meaningless scrawls, punctuated now and again with a word
  in longhand.</p>

  <p>He stopped suddenly, for under the heading "June 4th" was quite a long
  entry. It seemed to have been written in subsequently to the original
  shorthand entry, for it was in green ink. This almost dated the inscription.
  Eighteen months before, an oculist had suggested to Mr. Salter, who suffered
  from an unusual form of astigmatism, that green ink would be easier for him
  to read, and ever since then he had used no other.</p>

  <p>Jim took in the paragraph before he realized that he was committing an
  unpardonable act in reading his employers' private notes.</p>

  <p>"One month imprisonment with hard labour. Holloway Prison. Released July
  2nd. Madge Benson (this word was underlined), 14, Palmer's Terrace,
  Paddington. 74, Highcliffe Gardens, Margate. Long enquiries with boatman who
  owned Saucy Belle. No further trace - "</p>

  <p>"What on earth does that mean?" muttered Jim. "I must make a note of
  that."</p>

  <p>He realized now that he was doing something which might be regarded as
  dishonourable, but he was so absorbed in the new clues that he overcame his
  repugnance.</p>

  <p>Obviously, this entry referred to the missing Lady Mary. Who the woman
  Madge Benson was, what the reference to Holloway Gaol meant, he would
  discover.</p>

  <p>He made a copy of the entry in the diary at the back of a card, went back
  to his room, locked the door of his desk and went home, to think out some
  plan of campaign.</p>

  <p>He occupied a small flat in a building overlooking Regent's Park. It is
  true that his particular flat overlooked nothing but the backs of other
  houses, and a deep cutting through which were laid the lines of the London,
  Midland and Scottish Railway - he could have dropped a penny on the carriages
  as they passed, so near was the line. But the rent of the flat was only
  one-half of that charged for those in a more favourable position. And his
  flat was smaller than any. He had a tiny private income, amounting to two or
  three pounds a week, and that, with his salary, enabled him to maintain
  himself in something like comfort. The three rooms he occupied were filled
  with priceless old furniture that he had saved from the wreckage of his
  father's home, when that easy-going man had died, leaving just enough to
  settle his debts, which were many.</p>

  <p>Jim had got out of the lift on the fourth floor and had put the key in the
  lock when he heard the door on the opposite side of the landing open, and
  turned round.</p>

  <p>The elderly woman who came out wore the uniform of a nurse, and she nodded
  pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"How is your patient, nurse?" asked Jim.</p>

  <p>"She's very well, sir, or rather as well as you could expect a bedridden
  lady to be," said the woman with a smile. "She's greatly obliged to you for
  the books you sent in to her."</p>

  <p>"Poor soul," said Jim sympathetically. "It must be terrible not to be able
  to go out."</p>

  <p>The nurse shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it is," she said, "but Mrs. Fane doesn't seem to mind. You get
  used to it after seven years."</p>

  <p>A "rat-tat" above made her lift her eyes.</p>

  <p>"There's the post," she said. "I thought it had gone. I'd better wait till
  he comes down."</p>

  <p>The postman at Featherdale Mansions was carried by the lift to the sixth
  floor and worked his way to the ground floor. Presently they heard his heavy
  feet coming down and he loomed in sight.</p>

  <p>"Nothing for you, sir," he said to Jim, glancing at the bundle of letters
  in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Miss Madge Benson - that's you, nurse, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"That's right," said the woman briskly, and took the letter from his hand,
  then with a little nod to Jim she went downstairs.</p>

  <p>Madge Benson! The name that had appeared in Salter's diary!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>CHAPTER 4</h2>

  <p class="first">"I'M sick to death of hearing your views on the subject,
  mother," said Mr. Digby Groat, as he helped himself to a glass of port. "It
  is sufficient for you that I want the girl to act as your secretary. Whether
  you give her any work to do or not is a matter of indifference to me.
  Whatever you do, you must not leave her with the impression that she is
  brought here for any other purpose than to write your letters and deal with
  your correspondence."</p>

  <p>The woman who sat at the other side of the table looked older than she
  was. Jane Groat was over sixty, but there were people who thought she was
  twenty years more than that. Her yellow face was puckered and lined, her
  blue-veined hands, folded now on her lap, were gnarled and ugly. Only the
  dark brown eyes held their brightness undimmed. Her figure was bent and there
  was about her a curious, cringing, frightened look which was almost pitiable.
  She did not look at her son - she seldom looked at anybody.</p>

  <p>"She'll spy, she'll pry," she moaned.</p>

  <p>"Shut up about the girl!" he snarled, "and now we've got a minute to
  ourselves, I'd like to tell you something, mother."</p>

  <p>Her uneasy eyes went left and right, but avoided him. There was a menace
  in his tone with which she was all too familiar.</p>

  <p>"Look at this."</p>

  <p>He had taken from his pocket something that sparkled and glittered in the
  light of the table lamp.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" she whined without looking.</p>

  <p>"It is a diamond bracelet," he said sternly. "And it is the property of
  Lady Waltham. We were staying with the Walthams for the week-end. Look at
  it!"</p>

  <p>His voice was harsh and grating, and dropping her head she began to weep
  painfully.</p>

  <p>"I found that in your room," he said, and his suave manner was gone. "You
  old thief!" he hissed across the table, "can't you break yourself of that
  habit?"</p>

  <p>"It looked so pretty," she gulped, her tears trickling down her withered
  face. "I can't resist the temptation when I see pretty things."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you know that Lady Waltham's maid has been arrested for
  stealing this, and will probably go to prison for six months?"</p>

  <p>"I couldn't resist the temptation," she snivelled, and he threw the
  bracelet on the table with a growl.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to send it back to the woman and tell them it must have been
  packed away by mistake in your bag. I'm not doing it to get this girl out of
  trouble, but to save myself from a lot of unpleasantness."</p>

  <p>"I know why you're bringing this girl into the house," she sobbed; "it is
  to spy on me."</p>

  <p>His lips curled in a sneer.</p>

  <p>"To spy on you!" he said contemptuously, and laughed as he rose. "Now
  understand," his voice was harsh again, "you've got to break yourself of this
  habit of picking up things that you like. I'm expecting to go into Parliament
  at the next election, and I'm not going to have my position jeopardized by an
  old fool of a kleptomaniac. If there's something wrong with your brain," he
  added significantly, "I've a neat little laboratory at the back of this house
  where that might be attended to."</p>

  <p>She shrank back in terror, her face grey.</p>

  <p>"You - you wouldn't do it - my own son!" she stammered. "I'm all right,
  Digby; it's only - "</p>

  <p>He smiled, but it was not a pleasant smile to see.</p>

  <p>"Probably there is a little compression," he said evenly, "some tiny
  malgrowth of bone that is pressing on a particular cell. We could put that
  right for you, mother - "</p>

  <p>But she had thrown her chair aside and fled from the room before he had
  finished. He picked up the jewel, looked at it contemptuously and thrust it
  into his pocket. Her curious thieving propensities he had known for a very
  long time and had fought to check them, and as he thought, successfully.</p>

  <p>He went to his library, a beautiful apartment, with its silver grate, its
  costly rosewood bookshelves and its rare furnishings, and wrote a letter to
  Lady Waltham. He wrapped this about the bracelet, and having packed letter
  and jewel carefully in a small box, rang the bell. A middle-aged man with a
  dark forbidding face answered the summons.</p>

  <p>"Deliver this to Lady Waltham at once, Jackson," said Digby. "The old
  woman is going out to a concert to-night, by the way, and when she's out I
  want you to make a very thorough search of her room."</p>

  <p>The man shook his head. "I've already looked carefully, Mr. Groat," he
  said, "and I've found nothing."</p>

  <p>He was on the point of going when Digby called him back.</p>

  <p>"You've told the housekeeper to see to Miss Weldon's room?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," was the reply. "She wanted to put her on the top floor amongst
  the servants, but I stopped her."</p>

  <p>"She must have the best room in the house," said Groat. "See that there
  are plenty of flowers in the room and put in the bookcase and the Chinese
  table that are in my room."</p>

  <p>The man nodded.</p>

  <p>"What about the key, sir?" he asked after some hesitation.</p>

  <p>"The key?" Digby looked up. "The key of her room?"</p>

  <p>The man nodded.</p>

  <p>"Do you want the door to lock?" he asked significantly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Groat's lips curled in a sneer.</p>

  <p>"You're a fool," he said. "Of course, I want the door to lock. Put bolts
  on if necessary."</p>

  <p>The man looked his surprise. There was evidently between these two
  something more than the ordinary relationship which existed between employer
  and servant. "Have you ever run across a man named Steele?" asked Digby,
  changing the subject.</p>

  <p>Jackson shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Who is he?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"He is a lawyer's clerk. Give him a look up when you've got some time to
  spare. No, you'd better not go - ask - ask Bronson. He lives at Featherdale
  Mansions."</p>

  <p>The man nodded, and Digby went down the steps to the waiting electric
  brougham.</p>

  <p>* * *</p>

  <p>Eunice Weldon had packed her small wardrobe and the cab was waiting at the
  door. She had no regrets at leaving the stuffy untidy lodging which had been
  her home for two years, and her farewell to her dishevelled landlady, who
  seemed always to have dressed in a violent hurry, was soon over. She could
  not share Jim Steele's dislike of her new employers. She was too young to
  regard a new job as anything but the beginning of an adventure which held all
  sorts of fascinating possibilities. She sighed as she realized that the
  little tea-table talks which had been so pleasant a feature of her life were
  now to come to an end, and yet - surely he would make some effort to see her
  again?</p>

  <p>She would have hours - perhaps half-days to herself, and then she
  remembered with dismay that she did not know his address! But he would know
  hers. That thought comforted her, for she wanted to see him again. She wanted
  to see him more than she had ever dreamt she would. She could close her eyes,
  and his handsome face, those true smiling eyes of his, would look into hers.
  The swing of his shoulders as he walked, the sound of his voice as he spoke -
  every characteristic of his was present in her mind.</p>

  <p>And the thought that she might not see him again!</p>

  <p>"I will see him - I will!" she murmured, as the cab stopped before the
  imposing portals of No. 409, Grosvenor Square.</p>

  <p>She was a little bewildered by the army of servants who came to her help,
  and just a little pleased by the deference they showed to her.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Groat will receive you, miss," said a swarthy-looking man, whose
  name she afterwards learnt was Jackson.</p>

  <p>She was ushered into a small back drawing-room which seemed poorly
  furnished to the girl's eye, but to Mrs. Groat was luxury.</p>

  <p>The old woman resented the payment of a penny that was spent on decoration
  and furniture, and only the fear of her son prevented her from disputing
  every account which was put before her for settlement. The meeting was a
  disappointment to Eunice. She had not seen Mrs. Groat except in the studio,
  where she was beautifully dressed. She saw now a yellow-faced old woman,
  shabbily attired, who looked at her with dark disapproving eyes.</p>

  <p>"Oh, so you're the young woman who is going to be my secretary, are you?"
  she quavered dismally. "Have they shown you your room?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet, Mrs. Groat," said the girl.</p>

  <p>"I hope you will be comfortable," said Mrs. Groat in a voice that
  suggested that she had no very great hopes for anything of the sort.</p>

  <p>"When do I begin my duties?" asked Eunice, conscious of a chill.</p>

  <p>"Oh, any time," said the old woman off-handedly.</p>

  <p>She peered up at the girl.</p>

  <p>"You're pretty," she said grudgingly, and Eunice flushed. Somehow that
  compliment sounded like an insult. "I suppose that's why," said Mrs. Groat
  absently.</p>

  <p>"Why what?" asked the girl gently.</p>

  <p>She thought the woman was weak of intellect and had already lost whatever
  enthusiasm she had for her new position.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said the old woman, and with a nod dismissed her.</p>

  <p>The room into which Eunice was shown left her speechless for a while.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure this is mine?" she asked incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Yes, miss," said the housekeeper with a sidelong glance at the girl.</p>

  <p>"But this is beautiful!" said Eunice.</p>

  <p>The room would have been remarkable if it had been in a palace. The walls
  were panelled in brocade silk and the furniture was of the most beautiful
  quality. A small French bed, carved and gilded elaborately, invited repose.
  Silk hangings hung at either side of the head, and through the French windows
  she saw a balcony gay with laden flower-boxes. Under her feet was a carpet of
  blue velvet pile that covered the whole of the room. She looked round
  open-mouthed at the magnificence of her new home. The dressing-table was an
  old French model in the Louis Quinze style, inlaid with gold, and the
  matching wardrobe must have been worth a fortune. Near one window was a
  lovely writing-table, and a well-filled bookcase would almost be within reach
  of her hand when she lay in bed.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure this is my room?" she asked again.</p>

  <p>"Yes, miss," said the housekeeper, "and this," she opened a door, "is your
  bathroom. There is a bath to every room. Mr. Groat had the house
  reconstructed when he came into it."</p>

  <p>The girl opened one of the French windows and stepped on to the balcony
  which ran along to a square and larger balcony built above the porch of the
  house. This, she discovered, opened from a landing above the stairs.</p>

  <p>She did not see Mrs. Groat again that afternoon, and when she inquired she
  discovered that the old lady was lying down with a bad headache. Nor was she
  to meet Digby Groat. Her first meal was eaten in solitude.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Groat has not come back from the country," explained Jackson, who
  waited on her. "Are you comfortable, miss?"</p>

  <p>"Quite, thank you," she said.</p>

  <p>There was an air about this man which she did not like. It was not that he
  failed in respect, or that he was in any way familiar, but there was
  something proprietorial in his attitude. It almost seemed as though he had a
  financial interest in the place, and she was glad when her meal was finished.
  She went straight up to her room a little dissatisfied that she had not met
  her employer. There were many things which she wanted to ask Mrs. Groat; and
  particularly did she wish to know what days she would be free.</p>

  <p>Presently she switched out the light, and opening the French windows,
  stepped out into the cool, fragrant night. The after-glow of the sun still
  lingered in the sky. The square was studded with lights; an almost incessant
  stream of motor-car traffic passed under her window, for Grosvenor Square is
  the short cut between Oxford Street and Piccadilly.</p>

  <p>The stars spangled the clear sky with a million specks of quivering light.
  Against the jewelled robe of the northern heavens, the roofs and steeples and
  stacks of London had a mystery and wonder which only the light of day could
  dispel. And in the majestic solitude of the night, Eunice's heart seemed to
  swell until she could scarcely breathe. It was not the magic of stars that
  brought the blood flaming to her face; nor the music of the trees. It was the
  flash of understanding that one half of her, one splendid fragment of the
  pattern on which her life was cut, was somewhere there in the darkness asleep
  perhaps - thinking of her, she prayed. She saw his face with startling
  distinctness, saw the tender kindness of his eyes, felt on her moist palm the
  pressure of those strong brown fingers....</p>

  <p>With a sigh which was half a sob, she closed the window and drew the
  silken curtains, shutting out the immortal splendours of nature from her
  view.</p>

  <p>Five minutes later she was asleep.</p>

  <p>How long she slept she did not know. It must have been hours, she thought.
  The stream of traffic had ceased and there was no sound from outside, save
  the distant hoot of a motor-horn. The room was in darkness, and yet she was
  conscious that somebody was there!</p>

  <p>She sat up in bed and a cold shiver ran down her spine. Somebody was in
  the room! She reached out to turn on the light and could have shrieked, for
  she touched a hand, a cold, small hand that was resting on the bedside table.
  For a second she was paralysed and then the hand was suddenly withdrawn.
  There was a rustle of curtain rings and the momentary glimpse of a figure
  against the lesser gloom of the night, and, shaking in every limb, she leapt
  from the bed and switched on the light. The room was empty, but the French
  window was ajar.</p>

  <p>And then she saw on the table by her side, a grey card. Picking it up with
  shaking hands she read:</p>

  <p>"One who loves you, begs you for your life and honour's sake to leave this
  house."</p>

  <p>It bore no other signature than a small blue hand. She dropped the card on
  the bed and stood staring at it for a while, and then, slipping into her
  dressing-gown, she unlocked the door of her room and went out into the
  passage. A dim light was burning at the head of the stairs. She was
  terror-stricken, hardly knew what she was doing, and she seemed to fly down
  the stairs.</p>

  <p>She must find somebody, some living human creature, some reality to which
  she could take hold. But the house was silent. The hall lamp was burning, and
  by its light she saw the old clock and was dimly conscious that she could
  hear its solemn ticking. It was three o'clock. There must be somebody awake
  in the house. The servants might still be up, she thought wildly, and ran
  down a passage to what she thought was the entrance to the servants' hall.
  She opened a door and found herself in another passage illuminated by one
  light at the farther end, where further progress was arrested by a white
  door. She raced along until she came to the door and tried to open it. There
  was no handle and it was a queer door. It was not made of wood, but of padded
  canvas.</p>

  <p>And then as she stood bewildered, there came from behind the padded door a
  squeal of agony, so shrill, so full of pain, that her blood seemed to turn to
  ice.</p>

  <p>Again it shrieked, and turning she fled back the way she had come, through
  the hall to the front door. Her trembling fingers fumbled at the key and
  presently the lock snapped and the door flew open. She staggered out on to
  the broad steps of the house and stopped, for a man was sitting on the head
  of those steps.</p>

  <p>He turned his face as the door opened, and in the light from the hall he
  was revealed. It was Jim Steele!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>CHAPTER 5</h2>

  <p class="first">JIM came stumbling to his feet, staring in blank amazement
  at the unexpected apparition, and for a moment thus they stood, facing one
  another, the girl stricken dumb with fear and surprise.</p>

  <p>She thought he was part of a dreadful dream, an image that was conjured by
  her imagination and would presently vanish.</p>

  <p>"Jim - Mr. Steele!" she gasped.</p>

  <p>In a stride he was by her side, his arm about her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"What is wrong?" he asked quickly, and in his anxiety his voice was almost
  harsh.</p>

  <p>She shuddered and dropped her face on his breast.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it was dreadful, dreadful!" she whispered, and he heard the note of
  horror in her low voice.</p>

  <p>"May I ask what is the meaning of this?" demanded a suave voice, and with
  a start the girl turned.</p>

  <p>A man was standing in the doorway and for a second she did not recognize
  him. Even Jim, who had seen Digby Groat at close quarters, did not know him
  in his unusual attire. He was dressed in a long white overall which reached
  from his throat to his feet; over his head was a white cap which fitted him
  so that not a particle of his hair could be seen. Bands of white elastic held
  his cuffs close to his wrists and both hands were hidden in brown rubber
  gloves.</p>

  <p>"May I again ask you, Miss Weldon, why you are standing on my doorstep in
  the middle of the night, attired in clothes which I do not think are quite
  suitable for street wear? Perhaps you will come inside and explain," he said
  stepping back. "Grosvenor Square is not quite used to this form of midnight
  entertainment."</p>

  <p>Still clutching Jim's arm, the girl went slowly back to the passage and
  Digby shut the door.</p>

  <p>"And Mr. Steele, too," said Digby with ironic surprise, "you're a very
  early caller."</p>

  <p>Jim said nothing. His attention was wholly devoted to the girl. She was
  trembling from head to foot, and he found a chair for her.</p>

  <p>"There are a few explanations due," he said coolly, "but I rather think
  they are from you, Mr. Groat."</p>

  <p>"From me?'" Mr. Groat was genuinely unprepared for that demand.</p>

  <p>"So far as my presence is concerned, that can be explained in a minute,"
  said Jim. "I was outside the house a few moments ago when the door swung open
  and Miss Weldon ran out in a state of abject terror. Perhaps you will tell
  me, Mr. Groat, why this lady is reduced to such a condition?"</p>

  <p>There was a cold menace in his tone which Digby Groat did not like to
  hear.</p>

  <p>"I have not the slightest idea what it is all about," he said. "I have
  been working in my laboratory for the last half-hour, and the first
  intimation I had that anything was wrong was when I heard the door open."</p>

  <p>The girl had recovered now, and some of the colour had returned to her
  face, yet her voice shook as she recited the incidents of the night, both men
  listening attentively.</p>

  <p>Jim took particular notice of the man's attitude, and he was satisfied in
  his mind that Digby Groat was as much in ignorance of the visit to the girl's
  room as he himself. When she had finished, Groat nodded.</p>

  <p>"The terrifying cry you heard from my laboratory," he smiled, "is easily
  explained. Nobody was being hurt; at least, if he was being hurt, it was for
  his own good. When I came back to my house to-night, I found my little dog
  had a piece of glass in its paw, and I was extracting it."</p>

  <p>She drew a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"I'm so sorry I made such a fuss," she said penitently, "but I - I was
  frightened."</p>

  <p>"You are sure somebody was in your room?" asked Digby.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely certain." She had not told him about the card.</p>

  <p>"They came through the French window from the balcony?" She nodded.</p>

  <p>"May I see your room?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated for a moment.</p>

  <p>"I will go in first to tidy it," she said. She remembered the card was on
  the bed, and she was particularly anxious that it should not be read.</p>

  <p>Uninvited Jim Steele followed Digby upstairs into the beautiful room. The
  magnificence of the room, its hangings and costly furniture, did not fail to
  impress him, but the impression he received was not favourable to Digby
  Groat.</p>

  <p>"Yes, the window is ajar. You are sure you fastened it?"</p>

  <p>The girl nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I left both fanlights down to get the air," she pointed above, "but
  I fastened these doors. I distinctly remember that."</p>

  <p>"But if this person came in from the balcony," said Digby, "how did he or
  she get there?"</p>

  <p>He opened the French door and stepped out into the night, walking along
  the balcony until he came to the square space above the porch. There was
  another window here which gave on to the landing at the head of the stairs.
  He tried it - it was fastened. Coming back through the girl's room he
  discovered that not only was the catch in its socket, but the key was
  turned.</p>

  <p>"Strange," he muttered.</p>

  <p>His first impression had been that it was his mother who, with her strange
  whims, had been searching the room for some trumpery trinket which had taken
  her fancy. But the old woman was not sufficiently agile to climb a balcony,
  nor had she the courage to make a midnight foray.</p>

  <p>"My own impression is that you dreamt it, Miss Weldon," he said, with a
  smile. "And now I advise you to go to bed and to sleep. I'm sorry that you've
  had this unfortunate introduction to my house."</p>

  <p>He had made no reference to the providential appearance of Jim Steele, nor
  did he speak of this until they had said good night to the girl and had
  passed down the stairs into the hall again.</p>

  <p>"Rather a coincidence, your being here, Mr. Steele," he said. "What were
  you doing? Studying dactylology?"</p>

  <p>"Something like that," said Jim coolly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Digby Groat searched for a cigarette in his pocket and lit it.</p>

  <p>"I should have thought that your work was so arduous that you would not
  have time for early morning strolls in Grosvenor Square."</p>

  <p>"Would you really?" said Jim, and then suddenly Digby laughed.</p>

  <p>"You're a queer devil," he said. "Come along and see my laboratory."</p>

  <p>Jim was anxious to see the laboratory, and the invitation saved him from
  the necessity of making further reference to the terrifying cry which Eunice
  had heard.</p>

  <p>They turned down a long passage through the padded door and came to a
  large annexe, the walls of which were of white glazed brick. There was no
  window, the light in the daytime being admitted through a glass roof. Now,
  however, these were covered by blue blinds and the room owed its illumination
  to two powerful lights which hung above a small table. It was not an ordinary
  table; its legs were of thin iron, terminating in rubber-tyred castors. The
  top was of white enamelled iron, with curious little screw holds occurring at
  intervals.</p>

  <p>It was not the table so much as the occupant which interested Jim.
  Fastened down by two iron bands, one of which was about its neck and one
  about the lower portion of its body, its four paws fastened by thin cords,
  was a dog, a rough-haired terrier who turned its eyes upon Jim with an
  expression of pleading so human that Jim could almost feel the message that
  the poor little thing was sending.</p>

  <p>"Your dog, eh?" said Jim.</p>

  <p>Digby looked at him.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said. "Why?"</p>

  <p>"Haven't you finished taking the glass out of his paw?"</p>

  <p>"Not quite," said the other coolly.</p>

  <p>"By the way, you don't keep him very clean," Jim said.</p>

  <p>Digby turned.</p>

  <p>"What the devil are you hinting at?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I am merely suggesting that this is not your dog, but a poor stray
  terrier which you picked up in the street half an hour ago and enticed into
  this house."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"I'd save you further trouble by saying that I saw you pick it up."</p>

  <p>Digby's eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you did, did you?" he said softly. "So you were spying on me?"</p>

  <p>"Not exactly spying on you," said Jim calmly, "but merely satisfying my
  idle curiosity."</p>

  <p>His hand fell on the dog and he stroked its ears gently.</p>

  <p>Digby laughed.</p>

  <p>"Well, if you know that, I might as well tell you that I am going to
  evacuate the sensory nerve. I've always been curious to - "</p>

  <p>Jim looked round.</p>

  <p>"Where is your anaesthetic?" he asked gently, and he was most dangerous
  when his voice sank to that soft note.</p>

  <p>"Anaesthetic? Good Lord," scoffed the other, "you don't suppose I'm going
  to waste money on chloroform for a dog, do you?"</p>

  <p>His fingers rested near the poor brute's head and the dog, straining
  forward, licked the torturer's hand.</p>

  <p>"Filthy little beast!" said Digby, picking up a towel.</p>

  <p>He took a thick rubber band, slipped it over the dog's mouth and nose.</p>

  <p>"Now lick," he laughed; "I think that will stop his yelping. You're a bit
  chicken-hearted, aren't you, Mr. Steele? You don't realize that medical
  science advances by its experiments on animals."</p>

  <p>"I realize the value of vivisection under certain conditions," said Jim
  quietly, "but all decent doctors who experiment on animals relieve them of
  their pain before they use the knife; and all doctors, whether they are
  decent or otherwise, receive a certificate of permission from the Board of
  Trade before they begin their experiments. Where is your certificate?"</p>

  <p>Digby's face darkened.</p>

  <p>"Look here, don't you come here trying to bully me," he blustered. "I
  brought you here just to show you my laboratory - "</p>

  <p>"And if you hadn't brought me in," interrupted Jim. "I should jolly well
  have walked in, because I wasn't satisfied with your explanation. Oh, yes, I
  know, you're going to tell me that the dog was only frightened and the yell
  she heard was when you put that infernal clamp on his neck. Now, I'll tell
  you something, Mr. Digby Groat. I'll give you three minutes to get the clamp
  off that dog."</p>

  <p>Digby's yellow face was puckered with rage.</p>

  <p>"And if I don't?" he breathed.</p>

  <p>"I'll put you where the dog is," said Jim. "And please don't persuade
  yourself that I couldn't do it?"</p>

  <p>There was a moment's silence.</p>

  <p>"Take the clamps off that dog," said Jim.</p>

  <p>Digby looked at him.</p>

  <p>For a moment they gazed at one another and there was a look of malignity
  in the eyes that dropped before Jim's. Another minute and the dog was
  free.</p>

  <p>Jim lifted the shivering little animal in his arms and rubbed its bony
  head, and Digby watched him glowering, his teeth showing in his rage.</p>

  <p>"I'll remember this," he snarled. "By God, you shall rue the day you ever
  interfered with me!"</p>

  <p>Jim's steady eyes met the man's.</p>

  <p>"I have never feared a threat in my life," he said quietly. "I'm not
  likely to be scared now. I admit that vivisection is necessary under proper
  conditions, but men like you who torture harmless animals from a sheer lust
  of cruelty, are bringing discredit upon the noblest of professions. You hurt
  in order to satisfy your own curiosity. You have not the slightest intention
  of using the knowledge you gain for the benefit of suffering humanity. When I
  came into this laboratory," he said - he was standing at the door as he spoke
  - "there were two brutes here. I am leaving the bigger one behind."</p>

  <p>He slammed the padded door and walked out into the passage, leaving a man
  whose vanity was hurt beyond forgiveness.</p>

  <p>Then to his surprise Groat heard Jim's footsteps returning and his visitor
  came in.</p>

  <p>"Did you close your front door when you went upstairs?"</p>

  <p>Digby's eyebrows rose. He forgot for the moment the insult that had been
  offered him.</p>

  <p>"Yes - why?"</p>

  <p>"It is wide open now," said Jim. "I guess your midnight visitor has gone
  home."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>CHAPTER 6</h2>

  <p class="first">IN the cheerful sunlight of the morning all Eunice's fear
  had vanished and she felt heartily ashamed of herself that she had made such
  a commotion in the night. And yet there was the card. She took it from under
  her pillow and read it again, with a puzzled frown. Somebody had been in the
  room, but it was not a somebody whom she could regard as an enemy. Then a
  thought struck her that made her heart leap. Could it have been Jim? She
  shook her head. Somehow she was certain it was not Jim, and she flushed at
  the thought. It was not his hand she had touched. She knew the shape and
  contour of that. It was warm and firm, almost electric; that which she had
  touched had been the hand of somebody who was old, of that she was sure.</p>

  <p>She went down to breakfast to find Groat standing before the fire, a
  debonair, perfectly dressed man, who showed no trace of fatigue, though he
  had not gone to bed until four o'clock.</p>

  <p>He gave her a cheery greeting.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Miss Weldon," he said. "I hope you have recovered from your
  nightmare."</p>

  <p>"I gave you a lot of trouble," she said with a rueful smile. "I am so very
  sorry."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense," he said heartily. "I am only glad that our friend Steele was
  there to appease you. By the way, Miss Weldon, I owe you an apology. I told
  you a lie last night."</p>

  <p>She looked at him open-eyed.</p>

  <p>"Did you, Mr. Groat?" she said, and then with a laugh, "I am sure it
  wasn't a very serious one."</p>

  <p>"It was really. I told you that my little dog had a piece of glass in his
  paw; the truth was that it wasn't my dog at all, but a dog that I picked up
  in the street. I intended making an experiment upon him; you know I am a
  doctor."</p>

  <p>She shivered.</p>

  <p>"Oh, that was the noise?" she asked with a wry little face.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, he was just scared, he hadn't been hurt at all - and in truth I
  didn't intend hurting him. Your friend, however, persuaded me to let the
  little beggar go."</p>

  <p>She drew a long sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"I'm so glad," she said. "I should have felt awful."</p>

  <p>He laughed softly as he took his place at the table.</p>

  <p>"Steele thought I was going to experiment without chloroform, but that, of
  course, was absurd. It is difficult to get the unprofessional man to realize
  what an enormous help to medical science these experiments are. Of course,"
  he said airily, "they are conducted without the slightest pain to the animal.
  I should no more think of hurting a little dog than I should think of hurting
  you."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure you wouldn't," she said warmly.</p>

  <p>Digby Groat was a clever man. He knew that Jim would meet the girl again
  and would give her his version of the scene in the laboratory. It was
  necessary, therefore, that he should get his story in first, for this girl
  whom he had brought to the house for his amusement was more lovely than he
  had dreamt, and he desired to stand well with her.</p>

  <p>Digby, who was a connoisseur in female beauty, had rather dreaded the
  morning meal. The beauty of women seldom survives the cruel searchlight which
  the grey eastern light throws upon their charms. Love had never touched him,
  though many women had come and gone in his life. Eunice Weldon was a more
  thrilling adventure, something that would surely brighten a dreary week or
  two; an interest to stimulate him until another stimulation came into
  sight.</p>

  <p>She survived the ordeal magnificently, he thought. The tender texture of
  the skin, untouched by an artificial agent, was flawless; the eyes, bright
  and vigorous with life, sparkled with health; the hands that lay upon the
  table, when she was listening to him, were perfectly and beautifully
  moulded.</p>

  <p>She on her side was neither attracted nor repelled. Digby Groat was just a
  man. One of the thousands of men who pass and repass in the corridor of life;
  some seen, some unnoticed, some interesting, some abhorrent. Some stop to
  speak, some pass hurriedly by and disappear through strange doors never to be
  seen again. He had "stopped to speak," but had he vanished from sight through
  one of those doors of mystery she would have been neither sorry nor glad.</p>

  <p>"My mother never comes to breakfast," said Digby halfway through the meal.
  "Do you think you will like your work?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know what it is yet," she answered, her eyes twinkling.</p>

  <p>"Mother is rather peculiar," he said, "and just a little eccentric, but I
  think you will be sensible enough to get on with her. And the work will not
  be very heavy at first. I am hoping later that you will be able to assist me
  in my anthropological classification."</p>

  <p>"That sounds terribly important," she said. "What does it mean?"</p>

  <p>"I am making a study of faces and heads," he said easily, "and to that end
  I have collected thousands of photographs from all parts of the world. I hope
  to get a million. It is a science which is very much neglected in this
  country. It appears to be the exclusive monopoly of the Italians. You have
  probably heard of Mantaganza and Lombroso?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"They are the great criminal scientists, aren't they?" she said to his
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I see, you know something about it. Yes, I suppose you would call
  them criminal scientists."</p>

  <p>"It sounds fascinating," she said, looking at him in wonder, "and I should
  like to help you if your mother can spare me."</p>

  <p>"Oh, she'll spare you," he said.</p>

  <p>Her hand lay on the table invitingly near to his, but he did not move. He
  was a quick, accurate judge of human nature. He knew that to touch her would
  be the falsest of moves. If it had been another woman - yes, his hand would
  have closed gently over hers, there would have been a giggle of
  embarrassment, a dropping of eyes, and the rest would have been so easy. But
  if he had followed that course with her, he knew that evening would find her
  gone. He could wait, and she was worth waiting for. She was gloriously
  lovely, he thought. Half the pleasure of life lies in the chase, and the
  chase is no more than a violent form of anticipation. Some men find their
  greatest joy in visions that must sooner or later materialize, and Digby
  Groat was one of these.</p>

  <p>She looked up and saw his burning eyes fixed on her and flushed. With an
  effort she looked again and he was a normal man.</p>

  <p>Was it an illusion of hers? she wondered.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>CHAPTER 7</h2>

  <p class="first">THE first few days of her engagement were very trying to
  Eunice Weldon.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Groat did not overwork her, indeed Eunice's complaint was that the
  old woman refused to give her any work at all.</p>

  <p>On the third day at breakfast she spoke on the matter to Digby Groat.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I am not very much use here, Mr. Groat," she said; "it is a
  sin to take your money."</p>

  <p>"Why?" he asked quickly.</p>

  <p>"Your mother prefers to write her own letters," she said, "and really
  those don't seem to be very many!"</p>

  <p>"Nonsense," he said sharply, and seeing that he had startled the girl he
  went on in a much gentler tone: "You see, my mother is not used to service of
  any kind. She's one of those women who prefer to do things for themselves,
  and she has simply worn herself to a shadow because of this independence of
  hers. There are hundreds of jobs that she could give you to do! You must make
  allowance for old women, Miss Weldon. They take a long time to work up
  confidence in strangers."</p>

  <p>"I realize that," she nodded.</p>

  <p>"Poor mother is rather bewildered by her own magnificence," he smiled,
  "but I am sure when she gets to know you, you will find your days very fully
  occupied."</p>

  <p>He left the morning-room and went straight into his mother's little
  parlour, and found her in her dressing-room crouching over a tiny fire. He
  closed the door carefully and walked across to her and she looked up with a
  little look of fear in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Why aren't you giving this girl work to do?" he asked sharply.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing for her to do," she wailed. "My dear, she is such an
  expense, and I don't like her."</p>

  <p>"You'll give her work to do from to-day," he said, "and don't let me tell
  you again!"</p>

  <p>"She'll only spy on me," said Mrs. Groat fretfully, "and I never write
  letters, you know that. I haven't written a letter for years until you made
  me write that note to the lawyer."</p>

  <p>"You'll find work for her to do," repeated Digby Groat. "Do you
  understand? Get all the accounts that we've had for the past two years, and
  let her sort them out and make a list of them. Give her your bank account.
  Let her compare the cheques with the counterfoils. Give her anything. Damn
  you! You don't want me to tell you every day, do you?"</p>

  <p>"I'll do it, I'll do it, Digby," she said hurriedly. "You're very hard on
  me, my boy. I hate this house," she said with sudden vehemence. "I hate the
  people in it. I looked into her room this morning and it is like a palace. It
  must have cost us thousands of pounds to furnish that room, and all for a
  work-girl - it is sinful!"</p>

  <p>"Never mind about that," he said. "Find something to occupy her time for
  the next fortnight."</p>

  <p>The girl was surprised that morning when Mrs. Groat sent for her.</p>

  <p>"I've one or two little tasks for you, miss - I never remember your
  name."</p>

  <p>"Eunice," said the girl, smiling.</p>

  <p>"I don't like the name of Eunice," grumbled the old woman. "The last one
  was Lola! A foreign girl. I was glad when she left. Haven't you got another
  name?"</p>

  <p>"Weldon is my other name," said the girl good-humouredly, "and you can
  call me 'Weldon' or 'Eunice' or anything you like, Mrs. Groat."</p>

  <p>The old woman sniffed.</p>

  <p>She had in front of her a big drawer packed with cheques which had come
  back from the bank.</p>

  <p>"Go through these," she said, "and do something with them. I don't know
  what."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you want me to fasten them to the counterfoils," said the
  girl.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, that's it," said Mrs. Groat. "You don't want to do it here, do
  you? Yes, you'd better do it here," she went on hastily. "I don't want the
  servants prying into my accounts."</p>

  <p>Eunice put the drawer on the table, gathered together the stubs of the
  cheque books, and with a little bottle of gum began her work, the old woman
  watching her.</p>

  <p>When, for greater comfort, the girl took off the gold wrist-watch which
  she wore, a present from her dead father, Mrs. Groat's greedy eyes focussed
  upon it and a look of animation came into the dull face.</p>

  <p>It looked like being a long job, but Eunice was a methodical worker, and
  when the gong in the hall sounded for lunch, she had finished her
  labours.</p>

  <p>"There, Mrs. Groat," she said with a smile, "I think that is the lot. All
  your cheques are here."</p>

  <p>She put away the drawer and looked round for her watch, but it had
  disappeared. It was at that moment that Digby Groat opened the door and
  walked in.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Miss Weldon," he said with his engaging smile. "I've come back for
  lunch. Did you hear the gong, mother? You ought to have let Miss Weldon
  go."</p>

  <p>But the girl was looking round.</p>

  <p>"Have you lost anything?" asked Digby quickly.</p>

  <p>"My little watch. I put it down a few minutes ago, and it seems to have
  vanished," she said.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it is in the drawer," stammered the old woman, avoiding her son's
  eye.</p>

  <p>Digby looked at her for a moment, then turned to Eunice.</p>

  <p>"Will you please ask Jackson to order my car for three o'clock?" he asked
  gently.</p>

  <p>He waited until the door closed behind the girl and then: "Where is that
  watch?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The watch, Digby?" quavered the old woman.</p>

  <p>"The watch, curse you!" he said, his face black with rage.</p>

  <p>She put her hand into her pocket reluctantly and produced it.</p>

  <p>"It was so pretty," she snivelled, and he snatched it from her hand.</p>

  <p>A minute later Eunice returned.</p>

  <p>"We have found your watch," he said with a smile. "You had dropped it
  under the table."</p>

  <p>"I thought I'd looked there," she said. "It is not a valuable watch, but
  it serves a double purpose."</p>

  <p>She was preparing to put it on.</p>

  <p>"What other purpose than to tell you the time?" asked Digby.</p>

  <p>"It hides a very ugly scar," she said, and extended her wrist. "Look." She
  pointed to a round red mark, the size of a sixpence. It looked like a recent
  burn.</p>

  <p>"That's queer," said Digby, looking, and then he heard a strangled sound
  from his mother. Her face was twisted and distorted, her eyes were glaring at
  the girl's wrist.</p>

  <p>"Digby, Digby!" Her voice was a thin shriek of sound. "Oh, my God!"</p>

  <p>And she fell across the table and before he could reach her, had dropped
  to the floor in an inert heap.</p>

  <p>Digby stooped over his mother and then turned his head slowly to the
  frightened girl.</p>

  <p>"It was the scar on your hand that did it," he said slowly. "What does it
  mean?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>CHAPTER 8</h2>

  <p class="first">THE story of the scar and the queer effect it had produced
  on Mrs. Groat puzzled Jim almost as much as it had worried the girl. He
  offered his wild theory again and she laughed.</p>

  <p>"Of course I shall leave," she said, "but I must stay until all Mrs.
  Groat's affairs are cleared up. There are heaps of letters and documents of
  all kinds which I have to index," she said, "at least Mr. Groat told me there
  were. And it seems so unfair to run away whilst the poor old lady is so ill.
  As to my being the young lady of fortune, that is absurd. My parents were
  South Africans. Jim, you are too romantic to be a good detective."</p>

  <p>He indulged in the luxury of a taxi to carry her back to Grosvenor Square,
  and this time went with her to the house, taking his leave at the door.</p>

  <p>Whilst they were talking on the step, the door opened and a man was shown
  out by Jackson. He was a short, thick-set man with an enormous brown
  beard.</p>

  <p>Apparently Jackson did not see the two people on the step, at any rate he
  did not look toward them, but said in a loud voice:</p>

  <p>"Mr. Groat will not be home until seven o'clock, Mr. Villa."</p>

  <p>"Tell him I called," said the bearded man with a booming voice, and
  stepped past Jim, apparently oblivious to his existence.</p>

  <p>"Who is the gentleman with the whiskers?" asked Jim, but the girl could
  give him no information.</p>

  <p>Jim was not satisfied with the girl's explanation of her parentage. There
  was an old school-friend of his in business in Cape Town, as an architect,
  and on his return to his office, Jim sent him a long reply-paid cablegram. He
  felt that he was chasing shadows, but at present there was little else to
  chase, and he went home to his flat a little oppressed by the hopelessness of
  his task.</p>

  <p>The next day he had a message from the girl saying that she could not come
  out that afternoon, and the day was a blank, the more so because that
  afternoon he received a reply to his cable. The reply destroyed any romantic
  dreams he might have had as to Eunice Weldon's association with the Danton
  millions. The message was explicit. Eunice May Weldon had been born at
  Rondebosch; on the l2th June, 1899; her parents were Henry William Weldon,
  musician, and Margaret May Weldon. She had been christened at the Wesleyan
  Chapel at Rondebosch, and both her parents were dead.</p>

  <p>The final two lines of the cable puzzled him:</p>

  <p>"Similar inquiries made about parentage Eunice Weldon six months ago by
  Selenger &amp; Co., Brade Street Buildings."</p>

  <p>"Selenger &amp; Co.," said Jim thoughtfully. Here was a new mystery. Who
  else was making inquiries about the girl? He opened a Telephone Directory and
  looked up the name. There were several Selengers, but none of Brade Street
  Buildings. He put on his hat, and hailing a taxi, drove to Brade Street,
  which was near the Bank, and with some difficulty found Brade Street
  Buildings. It was a moderately large block of offices, and on the indicator
  at the door he discovered Selenger &amp; Co. occupied No. 6 room on the
  ground floor.</p>

  <p>The office was locked and apparently unoccupied. He sought the
  hall-keeper.</p>

  <p>"No, sir," said that man, shaking his head. "Selengers' aren't open. As a
  matter of fact, nobody's ever there except at night."</p>

  <p>"At night," said Jim, "that's an extraordinary time to do business."</p>

  <p>The hall-keeper looked at him unfavourably.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it is the way they do their business, sir," he said
  pointedly.</p>

  <p>It was some time before Jim could appease the ruffled guardian, and then
  he learnt that Selengers were evidently privileged tenants. A complaint from
  Selengers had brought the dismissal of his predecessor, and the curiosity of
  a house-keeper as to what Selengers did so late at night had resulted in that
  lady being summarily discharged.</p>

  <p>"I think they deal with foreign stock," said the porter. "A lot of cables
  come here, but I've never seen the gentleman who runs the office. He comes in
  by the side door."</p>

  <p>Apparently there was another entrance to Selengers' office, an entrance
  reached by a small courtyard opening from a side passage. Selengers were the
  only tenants who had this double means of egress and exit, and also, it
  seemed, they were the only tenants of the building who were allowed to work
  all night.</p>

  <p>"Even the stockbrokers on the second floor have to shut down at eight
  o'clock," explained the porter, "and that's pretty hard on them, because when
  the market is booming, there's work that would keep them going until twelve
  o'clock. But at eight o'clock, it is 'out you go' with the company that owns
  this building. The rents aren't high and there are very few offices to be had
  in the city nowadays. They have always been very strict, even in Mr. Danton's
  time."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Danton's time," said Jim quickly. "Did he own this building? Do you
  mean Danton the shipowner millionaire?"</p>

  <p>The man nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," he said, rather pleased with himself that he had created a
  sensation. "He sold it, or got rid of it in some way years ago. I happen to
  know, because I used to be an office-boy in these very buildings, and I
  remember Mr. Danton - he had an office on the first floor, and a wonderful
  office it was, too."</p>

  <p>"Who occupies it now?"</p>

  <p>"A foreign gentleman named Levenski. He's a fellow who's never here,
  either."</p>

  <p>Jim thought the information so valuable that he went to the length of
  calling up Mr. Salter at his home. But Mr. Salter knew nothing whatever about
  the Brade Street Buildings, except that it had been a private speculation of
  Danton's. It had come into his hands as the result of the liquidation of the
  original company, and he had disposed of the property without consultation
  with Salter &amp; Salter.</p>

  <p>It was another blank wall.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>CHAPTER 9</h2>

  <p class="first">"I SHALL not be in the office to-day, sir. I have several
  appointments which may keep me occupied," said Jim Steele, and Mr. Salter
  sniffed.</p>

  <p>"Business, Steele?" he asked politely.</p>

  <p>"Not all of them, sir," said Jim. He had a shrewd idea that Mr. Salter
  guessed what that business was.</p>

  <p>"Very good," said Salter, putting on his glasses and addressing himself to
  the work on his desk.</p>

  <p>"There is one thing I wanted to ask, and that is partly why I came,
  because I could have explained my absence by telephone."</p>

  <p>Mr. Salter put down his pen patiently.</p>

  <p>"I cannot understand why this fellow Groat has so many Spanish friends,"
  said Jim. "For example, there is a girl he sees a great deal, the Comtessa
  Manzana; you have heard of her, sir?"</p>

  <p>"I see her name in the papers occasionally," said Mr. Salter.</p>

  <p>"And there are several Spaniards he knows. One in particular named Villa.
  Groat speaks Spanish fluently, too."</p>

  <p>"That is curious," said Mr. Salter, leaning back in his chair. "His
  grandfather had a very large number of Spanish friends. I think that
  somewhere in the background there may have been some Spanish family
  connection. Old man Danton, that is, Jonathan Danton's father, made most of
  his money in Spain and in Central America, and was always entertaining a
  houseful of grandees. They were a strange family, the Dantons. They lived in
  little water-tight compartments, and I believe on the day of his death
  Jonathan Danton hadn't spoken more than a dozen words to his sister for
  twenty years. They weren't bad friends, if you understand. It was just the
  way of the Dantons. There are other families whom I know who do exactly the
  same thing. A reticent family, with a keen sense of honour."</p>

  <p>"Didn't Grandfather Danton leave Mrs. Groat any money? She was one of his
  two children, wasn't she?"</p>

  <p>Septimus Salter nodded.</p>

  <p>"He never left her a penny," he said. "She practically lived on the
  charity of her brother. I never understood why, but the old man took a sudden
  dislike to her. Jonathan was as much in the dark as I am. He used to discuss
  it with me and wondered what his sister had done to incur the old man's
  enmity. His father never told him - would never even discuss the sister with
  him. It was partly due to the old man's niggardly treatment of Mrs. Groat
  that Jonathan Danton made his will as he did.</p>

  <p>"Probably her marriage with Groat was one of the causes of the old man's
  anger. Groat was nothing, a shipping clerk in Danton's Liverpool office. A
  man ill at ease in good society, without an 'h' to his name, and desperately
  scared of his wife. The only person who was ever nice to him was poor Lady
  Mary. His wife hated him for some reason or other. Curiously enough when he
  died, too, he left all his money to a distant cousin - and he left about
  £5,000. Where he got it from heaven knows. And now be off, Steele. The moment
  you come into this office," said Mr. Salter in despair, "you start me on a
  string of reminiscences that are deplorably out of keeping with a lawyer's
  office."</p>

  <p>Jim's first call that morning was at the Home Office. He was anxious to
  clear up the mystery of Madge Benson. Neither Scotland Yard nor the Prisons
  Commissioners were willing to supply an unofficial investigator with the
  information he had sought, and in desperation he had applied to the Secretary
  of State's Department. Fortunately he had a "friend at court" in that
  building, a middle-aged barrister he had met in France, and his inquiry,
  backed by proof that he was not merely satisfying his personal curiosity, had
  brought him a note asking him to call.</p>

  <p>Mr. Fenningleigh received him in his room with a warmth which showed that
  he had not forgotten the fact that on one occasion Jim had saved him from
  what might have been a serious injury, if not death, for Jim had dragged him
  to cover one night when the British headquarters were receiving the unwelcome
  attentions of ten German bombers.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Steele. I can't tell you much," said the official, picking up a
  slip of paper from his blotting-pad, "and I'm not sure that I ought to tell
  you anything! But this is the information which 'prisons' have supplied."</p>

  <p>Jim took the slip from the barrister's hand and read the three lines.</p>

  <p>"'Madge Benson, age 26. Domestic Servant. One month with H.L. for theft.
  Sentenced at Marylebone Police Court. June 5th, 1898. Committed to Holloway.
  Released July 2nd, 1898.'"</p>

  <p>"Theft?" said Jim thoughtfully. "I suppose there is no way of learning the
  nature of the theft?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Fenningleigh shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I should advise you to interview the gaoler at Marylebone. These fellows
  have extraordinary memories for faces, and besides, there is certain to be a
  record of the conviction at the court. You had better ask Salter to apply;
  they will give permission to a lawyer."</p>

  <p>But this was the very thing Jim did not want to do.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10"></a>CHAPTER 10</h2>

  <p class="first">EUNICE WELDON was rapidly settling down in her new
  surroundings. The illness of her employer, so far from depriving her of
  occupation, gave her more work than she had ever expected. It was true, as
  Digby Groat had said, that there were plenty of small jobs to fill up her
  time. At his suggestion she went over the little account books in which Mrs.
  Groat kept the record of her household expenses, and was astounded to find
  how parsimonious the old lady had been.</p>

  <p>One afternoon when she was tidying the old bureau, she stopped in her work
  to admire the solid workmanship which the old furniture builders put into
  their handicraft.</p>

  <p>The bureau was one of those old-fashioned affairs, which are half desk and
  half bookcase, the writing-case being enclosed by glass doors covered on the
  inside with green silk curtains.</p>

  <p>It was the thickness of the two side-pieces enclosing the actual desk,
  which, unlike the writing-flap of the ordinary secretaire, was immovable,
  that arrested her attention. She was rubbing her hand admiringly along the
  polished mahogany surface when she felt a strip of wood give way under the
  pressure of her finger-tips. To her surprise a little flap about an inch wide
  and about six inches long had fallen down and hung on its in visible hinges,
  leaving a black cavity. A secret drawer in a secretaire is not an
  extraordinary discovery, but she wondered whether she ought to explore the
  recess which her accidental touch had revealed. She put in her fingers and
  drew out a folded paper. There was nothing else in the drawer, if drawer it
  could be called.</p>

  <p>Ought she to read it? she wondered. If it had been so carefully put away,
  Mrs. Groat would not wish it to be seen by a third person. Nevertheless, it
  was her duty to discover what the document was, and she opened it.</p>

  <p>To the top a piece of paper was attached on which a few words wire written
  in Mrs. Groat's hand:</p>

  <p>"This is the will referred to in the instructions contained in the sealed
  envelope which Mr. Salter has in his possession."</p>

  <p>The word "Salter" had been struck out and the name of the firm of
  solicitors, which had supplanted the old man had been substituted.</p>

  <p>The will was executed on one of those forms, which can be purchased at any
  law stationer's. But apart from the preamble it was short:</p>

  <p>"I give to my son, Digby Francis Groat, the sum of 20,000 pounds and my
  house and furniture at 409, Grosvenor Square. The remainder of my estate I
  give to Ramonez - Marquis of Estremeda, of Calle Receletos, Madrid."</p>

  <p>It was witnessed by two names, unknown to the girl, and as they had
  described themselves as domestic servants it was probable that they had long
  since left her employment, for Mrs. Groat did not keep a servant very
  long.</p>

  <p>What should she do with it? She determined to ask Digby.</p>

  <p>Later, when going through the drawers on her desk she discovered a small
  miniature and was startled by the dark beauty of the subject. It was a head
  and shoulders of a girl wearing her hair in a way, which was fashionable in
  the late seventies. The face was bold, but beautiful, the dark eyes seemed to
  glow with life. The face of a girl who had her way, thought Eunice, as she
  noted the firm round chin. She wondered who it was and showed it to Digby
  Groat at lunch.</p>

  <p>"Oh, that is a picture of my mother," he said carelessly.</p>

  <p>"Your mother," said Eunice in astonishment, and he chuckled.</p>

  <p>"You'd never think she was never like that; but she was, I believe, a very
  beautiful girl," - his face darkened - "just a little too beautiful," he
  said, without explaining what he meant.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he snatched the miniature from her and looked on the back.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," he apologized, and a sudden pallor had come to his face.
  "Mother sometimes writes things on the back of pictures, and I was rather - "
  he was going to say "scared " - "and I was rather embarrassed."</p>

  <p>He was almost incoherent, an unusual circumstance, for Digby Groat was the
  most self-possessed of men.</p>

  <p>He changed the subject by introducing an inquiry which he had meant to
  make some time before.</p>

  <p>"Miss Weldon, can you explain that scar on your wrist?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She shook her head laughingly.</p>

  <p>"I'm almost sorry I showed it to you," she said. "It is ugly, isn't
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Do you know how it happened?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she said, "mother never told me. It looks rather like a
  burn."</p>

  <p>He examined the little red place attentively.</p>

  <p>"Of course," she went on, "it is absurd to think that the sight of my
  birthmark was the cause of your mother's stroke."</p>

  <p>"I suppose it is," he nodded, "but it was a remarkable coincidence."</p>

  <p>He had endeavoured to find from the old woman the reason of her sudden
  collapse, but without success. For three days she had lain in her bed
  speechless and motionless and apparently had neither heard nor seen him when
  he had made his brief visits to the sick room.</p>

  <p>She was recovering now, however, and he intended, at the first
  opportunity, demanding a full explanation.</p>

  <p>"Did you find anything else?" he asked suspiciously. He was never quite
  sure what new folly his mother might commit. Her passion for other people's
  property might have come to light.</p>

  <p>Should she tell him? He saw the doubt and trouble in her face and repeated
  his question.</p>

  <p>"I found your mother's will," she said.</p>

  <p>He had finished his lunch, had pushed back his chair and was smoking
  peacefully. The cigar dropped from his hand and she saw his face go
  black.</p>

  <p>"Her will?" he said. "Are you sure? Her will is at the lawyer's. It was
  made two years ago."</p>

  <p>"This will was made a few months ago," said Eunice, troubled. "I do hope I
  haven't betrayed any secret of hers."</p>

  <p>"Let me see this precious document," said Digby, starting up.</p>

  <p>His voice was brusque, almost to rudeness. She wondered what had brought
  about this sudden change. They walked back to the old woman's shabby room and
  the girl produced a document from the drawer.</p>

  <p>He read it through carefully.</p>

  <p>"The old fool," he muttered. "The cussed drivelling old fool! Have you
  read this?" he asked sharply.</p>

  <p>"I read a little of it," admitted the girl, shocked by the man's brutal
  reference to his mother.</p>

  <p>He examined the paper again and all the time he was muttering something
  under his breath.</p>

  <p>"Where did you find this?" he asked harshly.</p>

  <p>"I found it by accident," explained Eunice. "There is a little drawer here
  " - she pointed to the seemingly solid side of the bureau in which gaped an
  oblong cavity.</p>

  <p>"I see," said Digby Groat slowly as he folded the paper. "Now, Miss
  Weldon, perhaps you will tell me how much of this document you have read? " -
  he tapped the will on his palm.</p>

  <p>She did not know exactly what to say. She was Mrs. Groat's servant and she
  felt it was disloyal even to discuss her private affairs with Digby.</p>

  <p>"I read beyond your legacy," she admitted, "I did not read it
  carefully."</p>

  <p>"And you saw that my mother had left me £20,000?" said Digby Groat, "and
  the remainder to - somebody else."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Do you know who that somebody else was?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said. "To the Marquis of Estremeda."</p>

  <p>His face had changed from sallow to red, from red to a dirty grey, and his
  voice as he spoke shook with the rage he could not altogether suppress.</p>

  <p>"Do you know how much money my mother will be worth?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No, Mr. Groat," said the girl quietly, "and I don't think you ought to
  tell me. It is none of my business."</p>

  <p>"She will be worth a million and a quarter," he said between his teeth,
  "and she's left me £20,000 and this damned house!"</p>

  <p>He swung round and was making for the door, and the girl, who guessed his
  intentions, went after him and caught his arm.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Groat," she said seriously, "you must not go to your mother. You
  really must not!"</p>

  <p>Her intervention sobered him and he walked slowly back to the fireplace,
  took a match from his pocket, lit it, and before the astonished eyes of the
  girl applied it to one corner of the document. He watched it until it was
  black ash and then put his foot upon the debris.</p>

  <p>"So much for that!" he said, and turning caught the amazed look in the
  face of Eunice. "You think I've behaved disgracefully, I suppose," he smiled,
  his old debonair self. "The truth is, I am saving my mother's memory from the
  imputation of madness. There is no Marquis of Estremeda, as far as I know. It
  is one of the illusions which my mother has, that a Spanish nobleman once
  befriended her. That is the dark secret of our family, Miss Weldon," he
  laughed, but she knew that he was lying.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>CHAPTER 11</h2>

  <p class="first">THE door of Digby Groat's study was ajar, and he caught a
  glimpse of Eunice as she came in and made her way up to her room. She had
  occupied a considerable amount of his thoughts that afternoon, and he had
  cursed himself that he had been betrayed into revealing the ugly side of his
  nature before one whom he wished to impress. But there was another matter
  troubling him. In his folly he had destroyed a legal document in the presence
  of a witness and had put himself into her power. Suppose his mother died, he
  thought, and the question of a will arose? Suppose Estremeda got hold of her,
  her testimony in the courts of law might destroy the value of his mother's
  earlier will and bring him into the dock at the Old Bailey.</p>

  <p>It was an axiom of his that great criminals are destroyed by small causes.
  The spendthrift who dissipates hundreds of thousands of pounds, finds himself
  made bankrupt by a paltry hundred pounds, and the clever organizer of the
  Thirteen who had covered his traces so perfectly that the shrewdest police in
  the world had not been able to associate him with their many crimes, might
  easily be brought to book through a piece of stupidity which was dictated by
  rage and offended vanity. He was now more than ever determined that Eunice
  Weldon should come within his influence, so that her power for mischief
  should be broken before she knew how crushingly it might be employed.</p>

  <p>It was not an unpleasant task he set himself, for Eunice exercised a
  growing fascination over him. Her beauty and her singular intelligence were
  sufficient lures, but to a man of his temperament the knowledge that she
  added to these gifts a purity of mind and soul gave her an added value. That
  she was in the habit of meeting the man he hated, he knew. His faithful
  Jackson had trailed the girl twice, and on each occasion had returned with
  the same report. Eunice Weldon was meeting Steele in the park. And the
  possibility that Jim loved her was the greatest incentive of all to his vile
  plan.</p>

  <p>He could strike at Jim through the girl, could befoul the soul that Jim
  Steele loved best in the world. That would be a noble revenge, he thought, as
  he sat, pen in hand, and heard her light footsteps pass up the stairs. But he
  must be patient and the game must be played cautiously. He must gain her
  confidence. That was essential, and the best way of securing this end, was to
  make no reference to these meetings, to give her the fullest opportunity for
  seeing Jim Steele and to avoid studiously any suggestion that he himself had
  an interest in her.</p>

  <p>He had not sought an interview with his mother. She had been sleeping all
  the afternoon, the nurse had told him, and he felt that he could be patient
  here also. At night, when he saw the girl at dinner, he made a reference to
  the scene she had witnessed in the old woman's sitting-room.</p>

  <p>"You'll think I'm an awful cad, Miss Weldon," he said frankly, "but mother
  has a trick of making me more angry than any other person I have met. You
  look upon me as a very unfilial son?" he smiled.</p>

  <p>"We do things we're ashamed of sometimes when we are angry," said Eunice,
  willing to find an excuse for the outburst. She would have gladly avoided the
  topic altogether, for her conscience was pricking her and she felt guilty
  when she remembered that she had spoken to Jim on the subject. Digby Groat
  was to make her a little more uncomfortable by his next remark.</p>

  <p>"It is unnecessary for me to tell you, Miss Weldon," he said, with his
  smile, "that all which happens within these four walls is confidential. I
  need not express any fear that you will ever speak to an outsider about our
  affairs."</p>

  <p>He had only to look at the crimson face, at the downcast eyes and the
  girl's fingers playing nervously with the silver, to realize that she had
  already spoken of the will, and again he cursed himself for his untimely
  exhibition of temper.</p>

  <p>He passed on, to the girl's great relief, to another subject. He was
  having certain alterations made in his laboratory and was enthusiastic about
  a new electrical appliance which he had installed.</p>

  <p>"Would you like to see my little den, Miss Weldon?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I should very much," said the girl.</p>

  <p>She was, she knew, being despicably insincere. She did not want to see the
  laboratory. To her, since Jim had described the poor little dog who had been
  stretched upon the table, it was a place of horror. But she was willing to
  agree to anything that would take Digby Groat from the topic of the will, and
  the thought of her own breach of faith.</p>

  <p>There was nothing very dreadful in the laboratory, she discovered. It was
  so white and clean and neat that her womanly instinct for orderliness could
  admire the well-arranged little room, with its shelves packed with bottles,
  its delicate glass retorts and its strange and mysterious instruments.</p>

  <p>He did not open the locked doors that hid one cupboard which stood at one
  end of the laboratory, so she knew nothing of the grisly relics of his
  investigations. She was now glad she had seen the place, but was nevertheless
  as pleased to return to the drawing-room.</p>

  <p>Digby went out at nine o'clock and she was left alone to read and to amuse
  herself as best she could. She called at Mrs. Groat's room on her way up and
  learnt from the nurse that the old lady was rapidly recovering.</p>

  <p>"She will be quite normal to-morrow or the next day," said the nurse.</p>

  <p>Here was another relief. Mrs. Groat's illness had depressed the girl. It
  was so terrible to see one who had been as beautiful as the miniature proved
  her to have been, struck down and rendered a helpless mass, incapable of
  thought or movement.</p>

  <p>Her room, which had impressed her by its beauty the day she had arrived,
  had now been enhanced by the deft touches which only a woman's fingers can
  give. She had read some of the books which Digby Groat had selected for her
  entertainment, and some she had dipped into only to reject.</p>

  <p>She spent the evening with The Virginian, and here Digby had introduced
  her to one of the most delightful creations of fiction. The Virginian was
  rather like Jim, she thought - but then all the heroes of all the books she
  read were rather like Jim.</p>

  <p>Searching in her bag for her handkerchief her fingers closed on the little
  card which had been left on her table the night of her introduction to the
  Grosvenor Square household. She took it out and read it for the twentieth
  time, puzzling over the identity of the sender and the object he had in
  view.</p>

  <p>What was the meaning of that little card? she wondered. And what was the
  story which lay behind it?</p>

  <p>She put down her book and, rising, switched on the lamp over her
  writing-table, examining the card curiously. She had not altered her first
  impression that the hand had been made by a rubber stamp. It was really a
  beautiful little reproduction of an open palm and every line was distinct.
  Who was her mysterious friend - or was he a friend? She shook her head. It
  could not be Jim, and yet - it worried her even to think of Jim in this
  connection. Whoever it was, she thought with a little smile, they had been
  wrong. She had not left the house and nothing had happened to her, and she
  felt a sense of pride and comfort in the thought that the mysterious
  messenger could know nothing of Jim, her guardian angel.</p>

  <p>She heard a step in the passage and somebody knocked at her door. It was
  Digby Groat. He had evidently just come in.</p>

  <p>"I saw your light," he said, "so I thought I would give you something I
  have brought back from the Ambassadors' Club."</p>

  <p>The "something" was a big square box tied with lavender ribbon.</p>

  <p>"For me?" she said in surprise.</p>

  <p>"They were distributing them to the guests," he said, "and I thought you
  might have a taste for sweeties. They are the best chocolates in
  England."</p>

  <p>She laughed and thanked him. He made no further attempt to continue the
  conversation, but, with a nod, went to his room. She heard the door open and
  close, and five minutes later it opened again and his soft footsteps faded
  away.</p>

  <p>He was going to his laboratory, she thought, and wondered, with a shiver,
  what was the experiment he was attempting that night.</p>

  <p>She had placed the box on the table and had forgotten about it until she
  was preparing for bed, then she untied the pretty ribbons and displayed the
  contents.</p>

  <p>"They're delicious," she murmured, and took one up in her fingers.</p>

  <p>Thump!</p>

  <p>She turned quickly and dropped the chocolate from her fingers.</p>

  <p>Something had hit against her window, it sounded like a fist. She ran to
  the silken curtains which covered the glass doors from view and hesitated
  nervously for a moment; then with a little catch of breath she thought that
  possibly some boys had thrown a ball.</p>

  <p>She pulled back the curtains violently and for a moment saw nothing. The
  balcony was clear and she unfastened the latch and stepped out. There was
  nobody in sight. She looked on the floor of the balcony for the object which
  had been thrown but could find nothing.</p>

  <p>She went slowly back to her room and was closing the door when she saw and
  gasped. For on one of the panes was the life-size print of the Blue Hand!</p>

  <p>Again that mysterious warning!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>CHAPTER 12</h2>

  <p class="first">EUNICE gazed at the hand spell-bound, but she was now more
  curious than alarmed. Opening the window again she felt gingerly at the
  impression. It was wet, and her finger-tip was stained a deep greasy blue,
  which wiped off readily on her handkerchief. Again she stepped out on to the
  balcony, and following it along, came to the door leading to the head of the
  stairs. She tried it. It was locked. Leaning over the parapet she surveyed
  the square. She saw a man and a woman walking along and talking together and
  the sound of their laughter came up to her. At the corner of the square she
  saw passing under a street-lamp a helmeted policeman who must, she
  calculated, have been actually in front of the house when the imprint was
  made.</p>

  <p>She was about to withdraw to her room when, looking down over the portico,
  she saw the figure of a woman descending the steps of the house. Who was she?
  Eunice knew all the servants by now and was certain this woman was a
  stranger. She might, of course, be one of Digby Groat's friends or a friend
  of the nurse, but her subsequent movements were so unusual that Eunice was
  sure that this was the mysterious stranger who had left her mark on the
  window. So it was a woman, after all, thought Eunice in amazement, as she
  watched her cross the square to where a big limousine was waiting.</p>

  <p>Without giving any instructions to the chauffeur, the woman in black
  stepped into the car, which immediately moved off.</p>

  <p>Eunice came back to the room and sat down in a chair to try to straighten
  her tangled mind. That hand was intended as a warning, she was sure of that.
  And now it was clear which way the visitor had come. She must have entered
  the house by the front door and have got on to the balcony through the door
  on the landing, locking it after her when she made her escape.</p>

  <p>Looking in the glass, Eunice saw that her face was pale, but inwardly she
  felt more thrilled than frightened, and she had also a sense of protection,
  for instinctively she knew that the woman was a friend. Should she go
  downstairs and tell Digby Groat? She shook her head at the thought. No, she
  would reserve this little mystery for Jim to unravel. With a duster, which
  she kept in one of the cupboards, she wiped the blue impression from the
  window and then sat down on the edge of her bed to puzzle out the intricate
  and baffling problem.</p>

  <p>Why had the woman chosen this method of warning her? Why not employ the
  mundane method of sending her a letter? Twice she had taken a risk to impress
  Eunice with the sense of danger, when the same warning might have been
  conveyed to her through the agency of the postman.</p>

  <p>Eunice frowned at this thought, but then she began to realize that, had an
  anonymous letter arrived, she would have torn it up and thrown it into her
  waste-paper basket. These midnight visitations were intended to impress upon
  the girl the urgency of the visitor's fear for her.</p>

  <p>It was not by any means certain that the woman who had left the house was
  the mysterious visitor. Eunice had never troubled to inquire into Digby
  Groat's character, nor did she know any of his friends. The lady in black
  might well have been an acquaintance of his, and to tell Digby of the warning
  and all that she had seen could easily create a very embarrassing situation
  for all concerned.</p>

  <p>She went to bed, but it was a long time before sleep came to her. She
  dozed and woke and dozed again and at last decided to get up. She pulled
  aside the curtains to let in the morning light. The early traffic was
  rumbling through the street, and the clear fragrance of the unsullied air
  came coldly as she stood and shivered by the open window. She was hungry, as
  hungry as a healthy girl can be in that keen atmosphere, and she bethought
  herself of the box of chocolates which Digby had brought to her. She had
  taken one from its paper wrapping and it was between her teeth when she
  remembered with a start that the warning had come at the very moment she was
  about to eat a chocolate! She put it down again thoughtfully, and went back
  to bed to pass the time which must elapse before the servants were about and
  any kind of food procurable.</p>

  <p>Jim Steele was about to leave his little flat in Featherdale Mansions that
  morning when he was met at the door by a district messenger carrying a large
  parcel and a bulky letter. He at once recognized the handwriting of Eunice
  and carried the parcel into his study. The letter was written hurriedly and
  was full of apologies. As briefly as possible Eunice had related the events
  of the night.</p>

  <p>"I cannot imagine that the chocolates had anything to do with it, but
  somehow you are communicating your prejudice against Digby Groat to me. I
  have no reason whatever to suspect him of any bad design toward me, and in
  sending these I am merely doing as you told me, to communicate everything
  unusual. Aren't I an obedient girl! And, please, Jim, will you take me out to
  dinner to-night. It is 'my night out,' and I'd love to have a leisurely meal
  with you, and I'm simply dying to talk about the Blue Hand! Isn't it
  gorgeously mysterious! What I shall try to catch up some of my arrears of
  sleep this afternoon so that I shall be fresh and brilliant." (She had
  written "and beautiful" in mockery but had scratched it out.)</p>

  <p>Jim Steele whistled. Hitherto he had regarded the Blue Hand as a
  convenient and accidental method which the unknown had chosen for his or her
  signature. Now, however, it obtained a new significance. The Blue Hand had
  been chosen deliberately and for some reason which must be known to one of
  the parties concerned. To Digby Groat? Jim shook his head. Somehow he knew
  for certain that the Blue Hand would be as much of a mystery to Digby Groat
  as it was to the girl and himself. He had no particular reason for thinking
  this. It was one of those immediate instincts which carry their own
  conviction. But who else was concerned? He determined to ask his partner that
  morning if the Blue Hand suggested anything to him.</p>

  <p>In the meantime there were the chocolates. He examined the box carefully.
  The sweetmeats were beautifully arranged and the box bore the label of a
  well-known West End confectioner. He took out three or four of the
  chocolates, placed them carefully in an envelope, and put the envelope in his
  pocket. Then he set forth for the city. As he closed his own door his eye
  went to the door on the opposite side of the landing, where dwelt Mrs. Fane
  and the mysterious Madge Benson. The door was ajar and he thought he heard
  the woman's voice on the ground floor below talking to the porter of the
  flats.</p>

  <p>His foot was extended to descend the first of the stairs when from the
  flat came a sharp scream and a voice: "Madge, Madge, help!"</p>

  <p>Without a second's hesitation he pushed open the door and ran down the
  passage. There were closed doors on either side, but the last on the right
  was open and a thin cloud of smoke was pouring forth. He rushed in, just as
  the woman, who was lying on the bed, was rising on her elbow as though she
  were about to get up, and tearing down the blazing curtains at one of the
  windows, stamped out the fire. It was all over in a few seconds and he had
  extinguished the last spark of fire from the blackened lace before he looked
  round at the occupant of the bed, who was staring at him wide-eyed.</p>

  <p>She was a woman of between forty and forty-five, he judged, with a face
  whose delicate moulding instantly impressed him. He thought he had seen her
  before, but knew that he must have been mistaken. The big eyes, grey and
  luminous, the dark brown hair in which a streak of grey had appeared, the
  beautiful hands that lay on the coverlet, all of these he took in at one
  glance.</p>

  <p>"I'm very greatly obliged to you, Mr. Steele," said the lady in a voice
  that was little above a whisper. "That is the second accident we have had. A
  spark from one of the engines must have blown in through the open
  window."</p>

  <p>Just beneath her was the cutting of the London, Midland and Scottish
  Railway, and Jim, who had watched the heavily laden trains toiling slowly and
  painfully up the steep incline, had often wondered if there was any danger
  from the showers of sparks which the engines so frequently threw up.</p>

  <p>"I must apologize for my rather rough intrusion," he said with his sweet
  smile. "I heard your screams. You are Mrs. Fane, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>She nodded, and there was admiration in the eyes that surveyed his
  well-knit figure.</p>

  <p>"I won't start a conversation with you under these embarrassing
  circumstances," said Jim with a laugh, "but I'd like to say how sorry I am
  that you are so ill, Mrs. Fane. Could I send you some more books?"</p>

  <p>"Thank you," she whispered. "You have done almost enough."</p>

  <p>He heard the door close as the servant, unconscious that anything was
  wrong, came in, and heard her startled exclamation as she smelt the smoke.
  Coming out into the passage he met Madge Benson's astonished face.</p>

  <p>A few words explained his presence and the woman hustled him to the door a
  little unceremoniously.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Fane is not allowed to see visitors, sir," she said. "She gets so
  excited."</p>

  <p>"What is the matter with her?" asked Jim, rather amused at the
  unmistakable ejection.</p>

  <p>"Paralysis in both legs," said Madge Benson, and Jim uttered an
  exclamation of pity.</p>

  <p>"Don't think I'm not grateful to you, Mr. Steele," said the woman
  earnestly; "when I saw that smoke coming out into the passage my heart nearly
  stopped beating. That is the second accident we have had."</p>

  <p>She was so anxious for him to be off that he made no attempt to continue
  talking.</p>

  <p>So that was Mrs. Fane, thought Jim, as he strode along to his office. A
  singularly beautiful woman. The pity of it! She was still young and in the
  bloom of health save for this terrible affliction.</p>

  <p>Jim had a big heart for suffering humanity, and especially for women and
  children on whom the burden of sickness fell. He was half-way to the office
  when he remembered that Mrs. Fane had recognized him and called him by name!
  How could she have known him - she who had never left her sick-room?</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13"></a>CHAPTER 13</h2>

  <p class="first">"MR. GROAT will not be down to breakfast. He was working
  very late, miss."</p>

  <p>Eunice nodded. She preferred the conversation of Digby Groat to the veiled
  familiarity of his shrewd-faced servant. It would be difficult for her to
  define in what way Jackson offended her. Outwardly he was respect itself, and
  she could not recall any term or word he had employed to which she could
  reasonably take offence. It was the assurance of the man, his proprietorial
  attitude, which irritated her. He reminded her of a boarding-house at which
  she had once stayed, where the proprietor acted as butler and endeavoured,
  without success, to combine the deference of the servant with the authority
  of the master.</p>

  <p>"You were out very early this morning, miss," said Jackson with his sly
  smile as he changed her plates.</p>

  <p>"Is there any objection to my going out before breakfast?" asked Eunice,
  her anger rising.</p>

  <p>"None at all, miss," said the man blandly. "I hope I haven't offended you,
  only I happened to see you coming back."</p>

  <p>She had been out to send the parcel and the letter to Jim, the nearest
  district messenger office being less than a quarter of a mile from Grosvenor
  Square. She opened her lips to speak and closed them again tightly. There was
  no reason in the world why she should excuse herself to the servant.</p>

  <p>Jackson was not ready to take a rebuff, and besides, he had something
  important to communicate.</p>

  <p>"You weren't disturbed last night, were you, miss?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" demanded Eunice, looking with a start.</p>

  <p>His keen eye was on her and without any reason she felt guilty.</p>

  <p>"Somebody was having a joke here last night, miss," he said, "and the
  governor is as wild as... well, he's mad!"</p>

  <p>She put down her knife and fork and sat back in her chair.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite understand you, Jackson," she said coldly. "What is the
  joke that somebody was having, and why do you ask me if I was disturbed? Did
  anything happen in the night?"</p>

  <p>The man nodded.</p>

  <p>"Somebody was in the house," he said, "and it is a wonder that Mr. Groat
  didn't hear it, because he was working in his laboratory. I thought perhaps
  you might have heard him searching the house afterwards."</p>

  <p>She shook her head. Had the Blue Hand been detected? she wondered.</p>

  <p>"How do you know that a stranger was in the house?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Because he left his mark," said the man grimly. "You know that white door
  leading to the laboratory, miss?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Well, when Mr. Groat came out about half-past two this morning he was
  going to turn out the hall lights when he saw a smudge of paint on the door.
  He went back and found that it was the mark of a Blue Hand. I've been trying
  to get it off all the morning, but it is greasy and can't be cleaned."</p>

  <p>"The mark of a Blue Hand?" she repeated slowly and felt herself change
  colour. "What does that mean?"</p>

  <p>"I'm blessed if I know," said Jackson, shaking his head. "The governor
  doesn't know either. But there it was as plain as a pike-staff. I thought it
  was a servant who did it. There is one under notice and she might have been
  up to her tricks, but it couldn't have been her. Besides, the servants'
  sleeping-rooms are at the back of the house, and the door between the front
  and the back is kept locked."</p>

  <p>So the mysterious visitor had not been satisfied with warning her. She had
  warned Digby Groat as well!</p>

  <p>Eunice had nearly finished breakfast when Digby made his appearance. He
  was looking tired and haggard, she thought. He never looked his best in the
  early hours, but this morning he was more unprepossessing than usual. He shot
  a swift suspicious glance at the girl as he took his place at the table.</p>

  <p>"You have finished, I'm afraid, Miss Weldon," he said briefly. "Has
  Jackson told you what happened in the night?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Eunice quietly. "Have you any idea what it means?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It means trouble to the person who did it, if I catch him," he said;
  then, changing the conversation, he asked how his mother was that
  morning.</p>

  <p>Eunice invariably called at Mrs. Groat's room on her way down, and she was
  able to tell him that his mother was mending rapidly and had passed a very
  good night.</p>

  <p>"She can't get well too soon," he said. "How did you sleep, Miss
  Weldon?"</p>

  <p>"Very well," she prevaricated.</p>

  <p>"Have you tried my chocolates?" he smiled.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"They are beautiful."</p>

  <p>"Don't eat too many at once, they are rather rich," he said, and made no
  further reference either to that matter or to the midnight visitor.</p>

  <p>Later in the morning, when she was going about her work, Eunice saw
  workmen engaged on cleaning the canvas door. Apparently the blue stain could
  not be eradicated, and after a consultation with Digby the canvas was being
  painted a dull blue colour.</p>

  <p>She knew that Digby was perturbed more than ordinarily. When she had met
  him, as she had occasionally that morning, he had worn a furtive, hunted
  look, and once, when she had gone into his study to bring to his notice an
  account which she had unearthed, he was muttering to himself.</p>

  <p>That afternoon there was a reception at Lord Waltham's house in Park Lane,
  in honour of a colonial premier who was visiting England. Digby Groat found
  it convenient to cultivate the acquaintance of the aesthetic Lord Waltham,
  who was one of the great financial five of the City of London. Digby had gone
  cleverly to work to form a small syndicate for the immediate purchase of the
  Danton estate. The time had not yet come when he could dispose of this
  property, but it was fast approaching.</p>

  <p>There were many women in that brilliant assembly who would have been glad
  to know a man reputedly clever, and certainly the heir to great wealth; but
  in an inverted sense Digby was a fastidious man. Society which met him and
  discussed him over their dinner-tables were puzzled by his avoidance of
  woman's society. He could have made a brilliant marriage, had he so desired,
  but apparently the girls of his own set had no attraction for him. There were
  intimates, men about town, who were less guarded in their language when they
  spoke across the table after the women had gone, and these told stories of
  him which did not redound to his credit. Digby in his youth had had many
  affairs - vulgar, sordid affairs which had left each victim with an aching
  heart and no redress.</p>

  <p>He had only come to "look in," he explained. There was heavy work awaiting
  him at home, and he hinted at the new experiment he was making which would
  take up the greater part of the evening.</p>

  <p>"How is your mother, Groat?" asked Lord Waltham.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir, I think she is better," replied Digby. He wanted to keep
  off the subject of his mother.</p>

  <p>"I can't understand the extraordinary change that has come over her in
  late years," said Lord Waltham with a little frown. "She used to be so bright
  and cheerful, one of the wittiest women I have ever met. And then, of a
  sudden, all her spirits seemed to go and if you don't mind my saying so, she
  seemed to get old."</p>

  <p>"I noticed that," said Digby with an air of profound concern, "but women
  of her age frequently go all to pieces in a week."</p>

  <p>"I suppose there's something in that. I always forget you're a doctor,"
  smiled Lord Waltham.</p>

  <p>Digby took his leave and he, too, was chuckling softly to himself as he
  went down the steps to his waiting car. He wondered what Lord Waltham would
  say if he had explained the secret of his mother's banished brightness. It
  was only by accident that he himself had made the discovery. She was a
  drug-taker, as assiduous a "dope" as he had ever met in his professional
  career.</p>

  <p>When he discovered this he had set himself to break down the habit. Not
  because he loved her, but because he was a scientist addicted to experiments.
  He had found the source of her supply and gradually had extracted a portion
  of the narcotic from every pellet until the drug had ceased to have its
  effect.</p>

  <p>The result from the old woman's point of view was deplorable. She suddenly
  seemed to wither, and Digby, whom she had ruled until then with a rod of
  iron, had to his surprise found himself the master. It was a lesson of which
  he was not slow to take advantage, every day and night she was watched and
  the drug was kept from her. With it she was a slave to her habit; without it
  she was a slave to Digby. He preferred the latter form of bondage.</p>

  <p>* * *</p>

  <p>Mr. Septimus Salter had not arrived when Jim had reached the office that
  morning, and he waited, for he had a great deal to say to the old man, whom
  he had not seen for the better part of the week.</p>

  <p>When he did come, a little gouty and therefore more than a little
  petulant, he was inclined to pooh-pooh the suggestion that there was anything
  in the sign of the Blue Hand.</p>

  <p>"Whoever the person is, he or she must have had the stamp by them - you
  say it looks like a rubber stamp - and used it fortuitously. No, I can't
  remember any Blue Hand in the business. If I were you, I should not attach
  too much importance to this."</p>

  <p>Although Jim did not share his employer's opinion he very wisely did not
  disagree.</p>

  <p>"Now, what is this you wore telling me about a will? You say Mrs. Groat
  has made a new will, subsequent to the one she executed in this office?"</p>

  <p>Jim assented.</p>

  <p>"And left all her money away from the boy, eh?" said old Mr. Salter
  thoughtfully. "Curiously enough, I always had an idea that there was no love
  lost between that pair. To whom do you say the money was left?"</p>

  <p>"To the Marquis of Estremeda."</p>

  <p>"I know the name," nodded Mr. Salter. "He is a very rich grandee of Spain
  and was for some time an attache at the Spanish Embassy. He may or may not
  have been a friend of the Dantons, I cannot recall. There is certainly no
  reason why she should leave her money to one who, unless my memory is at
  fault, owns half a province and has three or four great houses in Spain. Now,
  here you are up against a real mystery. Now, what is your news?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>Jim had a little more to tell him.</p>

  <p>"I am taking the chocolates to an analyst - a friend of mine," he said,
  and Mr. Salter smiled.</p>

  <p>"You don't expect to discover that they are poisoned, do you?" he asked
  dryly. "You are not living in the days of Caesar Borgia, and with all his
  poisonous qualities I have never suspected Digby Groat of being a
  murderer."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless," said Jim, "I am leaving nothing to chance. My own theory
  is that there is something wrong with those innocent-looking sweetmeats, and
  the mysterious Blue Hand knew what it was and came to warn the girl."</p>

  <p>"Rubbish," growled the old lawyer. "Get along with you. I have wasted too
  much time on this infernal case."</p>

  <p>Jim's first call was at a laboratory in Wigmore Street, and he explained
  to his friend just enough to excite his curiosity for further details, which,
  however, Jim was not prepared to give.</p>

  <p>"What do you expect to find?" said the chemist, weighing two chocolates in
  his palm.</p>

  <p>"I don't know exactly what I expect," said Jim. "But I shall be very much
  surprised if you do not discover something that should not be there."</p>

  <p>The scientist dropped the chocolates in a big test-tube, poured in a
  liquid from two bottles and began heating the tube over a Bunsen burner.</p>

  <p>"Call this afternoon at three o'clock and I will give you all the grisly
  details," he said.</p>

  <p>It was three o'clock when Jim returned, not expecting, it must be
  confessed, any startling results from the analysis. He was shown into the
  chemist's office, and there on the desk were three test-tubes, standing in a
  little wooden holder.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Steele," said Mendhlesohn. He was, as his name implied, a
  member of a great Jewish fraternity which has furnished so many brilliant
  geniuses to the world. "I can't quite make out this analysis," he said. "But,
  as you thought, there are certainly things in the chocolates which should not
  be there."</p>

  <p>"Poison?" said Jim, aghast.</p>

  <p>Mendhlesohn shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Technically, yes," he admitted. "There is poison in almost everything,
  but I doubt whether the eating of a thousand of these would produce death. I
  found traces of bromide of potassium and traces of hyacin, and another drug
  which is distilled from cannabis indica."</p>

  <p>"That is hashish, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>Mendhlesohn nodded.</p>

  <p>"When it is smoked it is called hashish; when it is distilled we have
  another name for it. These three drugs come, of course, into the category of
  poisons, and in combination, taken in large doses, they would produce
  unconsciousness and ultimately death, but there is not enough of the drug
  present in these sweets to bring about that alarming result."</p>

  <p>"What result would it produce?" asked Jim.</p>

  <p>"That is just what is puzzling me and my friend, Dr. Jakes," said
  Mendhlesohn, rubbing his unshaven chin. "Jakes thinks that, administered in
  small continuous doses, the effect of this drug would be to destroy the
  will-power, and, what for a better term I would describe in the German
  fashion, as the resistance-to-evil-power of the human mind. In England, as
  you probably know, when a nervous and highly excitable man is sentenced to
  death, it is the practice to place minute doses of bromide in everything he
  eats and drinks, in order to reduce him to such a low condition of mental
  resistance that even the thought of an impending doom has no effect upon
  him."</p>

  <p>Jim's face had gone suddenly pale, as the horror of the villainous plot
  dawned upon him.</p>

  <p>"What effect would this have upon a high-spirited girl, who was, let us
  say, being made love to by a man she disliked?"</p>

  <p>The chemist shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I suppose that eventually her dislike would develop into apathy and
  indifference. She would not completely forgo her resistance to his
  attentions, but at the same time that resistance would be more readily
  overcome. There are only two types of mind," he went on, "the 'dominant' and
  the 'recessive.' We call the 'dominant' that which is the more powerful, and
  the 'recessive' that which is the less powerful. In this world it is possible
  for a little weak man to dominate a big and vigorous man, by what you would
  call the sheer force of his personality. The effect of this drug would
  ultimately be to turn a powerful mind into a weak mind. I hope I am not being
  too scientific," he smiled.</p>

  <p>"I can follow you very well." said Jim quietly. "Now tell me this,
  Mendhlesohn, would it be possible to get a conviction against the person who
  supplied these sweets?"</p>

  <p>Mendhlesohn shook his head.</p>

  <p>"As I told you, the doses are in such minute quantities that it is quite
  possible they may have got in by accident. I have only been able to find what
  we chemists call a 'trace' so far, but probably the doses would be increased
  from week to week. If in three weeks' time you bring me chocolates or other
  food that has been tampered with, I shall be able to give you a very exact
  analysis."</p>

  <p>"Were all the chocolates I brought similarly treated?"</p>

  <p>Mendhlesohn nodded.</p>

  <p>"If they have been doped," he went on, "the doping has been very cleverly
  done. There is no discoloration of the interior, and the drug must have been
  introduced by what we call saturation, which only a very skilful chemist or a
  doctor trained in chemistry would attempt."</p>

  <p>Jim said nothing. Digby Groat was both a skilled chemist and a doctor
  trained in chemistry.</p>

  <p>On leaving the laboratory he went for his favourite walk in Hyde Park. He
  wanted to be alone and think this matter out. He must act with the greatest
  caution, he thought. To warn the girl on such slender foundation was not
  expedient. He must wait until the dose had been increased, though that meant
  that she was to act as a bait for Digby Groat's destruction, and he writhed
  at the thought. But she must not know; he was determined as to this.</p>

  <p>That night he had arranged a pleasant little dinner, and he was looking
  forward eagerly to a meeting with one whose future absorbed his whole
  attention and thoughts. Even the search for Lady Mary Danton had receded into
  the background, and might have vanished altogether as a matter of interest
  were it not for the fact that Digby Groat and his affairs were so
  inextricably mixed up with the mystery. Whilst Eunice Weldon was an inmate of
  the Groats' house, the Danton mystery would never be completely out of his
  thoughts.</p>

  <p class="first">JIM had never seen the girl in evening clothes, and he was
  smitten dumb by her ethereal beauty. She wore a simple dress of cream
  charmeuse, innocent of colour, except for the touch of gold at her waist. She
  looked taller to Jim's eyes, and the sweet dignity of her face was a benison
  which warmed and comforted his heart.</p>

  <p>"Well," she asked as the cab was proceeding towards Piccadilly. "Am I
  presentable?"</p>

  <p>"You're wonderful!" breathed Jim.</p>

  <p>He sat stiffly in the cab, scarcely daring to move lest the substance of
  this beautiful dream be touched by his irreverent hands. Her loveliness was
  unearthly and he, too, could adore, though from a different standpoint, the
  glorious promise of her womanhood, the delicious contours of her Madonna-like
  face. She was to him the spirit and embodiment of all that womanhood means.
  She was the truth of the dreams that men dream, the divine substance of
  shadowy figures that haunt their thoughts and dreams.</p>

  <p>"Phew!" he said, "you almost frighten me, Eunice."</p>

  <p>He heard her silvery laugh in the darkness.</p>

  <p>"You're very silly, Jim," she said, slipping her arm into his.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, she experienced a thrill of triumph and happiness that she
  had impressed him so.</p>

  <p>"I have millions of questions to ask you," she said after they had been
  ushered to a corner of the big dining-room of the Ritz-Carlton. "Did you get
  my letter? And did you think I was mad to send you those chocolates? Of
  course, it was terribly unfair to Mr. Groat, but really, Jim, you're turning
  me into a suspicious old lady!"</p>

  <p>He laughed gently.</p>

  <p>"I loved your letter," he said simply. "And as for the chocolates - " he
  hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"I should tell him that you enjoyed them thoroughly," he smiled.</p>

  <p>"I have," said the girl ruefully. "I hate telling lies, even that kind of
  lie."</p>

  <p>"And the next box you receive," Jim went on, "you must send me three or
  four of its contents."</p>

  <p>She was alarmed now, looking at him, her red lips parted, her eyebrows
  crescents of inquiry.</p>

  <p>"Was there anything wrong with them?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He was in a dilemma. He could not tell her the result of the analysis, and
  at the same time he could not allow her to run any farther into needless
  danger. He had to invent something on the spur of the moment and his excuse
  was lame and unconvincing.</p>

  <p>Listening, she recognized their halting nature, but was sensible enough
  not to insist upon rigid explanations, and, moreover, she wanted to discuss
  the hand and its startling appearance in the middle of the night.</p>

  <p>"It sounds almost melodramatic," said Jim, but his voice was grave, "and I
  find a great difficulty in reconciling the happening to the realities of
  life. Of one thing I'm sure," he went on, "and it is that this strange woman,
  if woman it be, has a reason for her acts. The mark of the hand is
  deliberately designed. That it is blue has a meaning, too, a meaning which
  apparently is not clear to Digby Groat. And now let us talk about ourselves,"
  he smiled, and his hand rested for a moment over hers.</p>

  <p>She did not attempt to withdraw her own until the waiter came in sight,
  and then she drew it away so gently as to suggest reluctance.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to stay another month with the Groats," she informed him, "and
  then if Mrs. Groat doesn't find some real work for me to do I'm going back to
  the photographers' - if they'll have me."</p>

  <p>"I know somebody who wants you more than the photographer," he said
  quietly, "somebody whose heart just aches whenever you pass out of his
  sight."</p>

  <p>She felt her own heart beating thunderously, and the hand that he held
  under the cover of the table trembled.</p>

  <p>"Who is that - somebody?" she asked faintly.</p>

  <p>"Somebody who will not ask you to marry him until he can offer you an
  assured position," said Jim. "Somebody who loves the very ground you walk
  upon so much that he must have carpets for your dear feet and a mansion to
  house you more comfortably than the tiny attic overlooking the London,
  Midland and Scottish Railway."</p>

  <p>She did not speak for a long time, and he thought he had offended her. The
  colour came and went in her face, the soft rounded bosom rose and fell more
  quickly than was usual, and the hand that he held closed so tightly upon his
  fingers that they were almost numb when she suddenly released her hold.</p>

  <p>"Jim," she said, still averting her eyes, "I could work very well on bare
  boards, and I should love to watch the London, Midland and Scottish trains -
  go past your attic."</p>

  <p>She turned her head to his and he saw that her eyes were bright with
  tears.</p>

  <p>"If you're not very careful, Jim Steele," she said, with an attempt at
  raillery, "I shall propose to you!"</p>

  <p>"May I smoke?" said Jim huskily, and when she nodded, and he lit his
  match, she saw the flame was quivering in his shaking hand.</p>

  <p>She wondered what made him so quiet for the rest of the evening. She could
  not know that he was stunned and shaken by the great fortune that had come to
  him, that his heart was as numb with happiness as his fingers had been in the
  pressure of her hand.</p>

  <p>When they drove back to the house that night she wanted him to take her in
  his arms in the darkness of the cab and crush her against his breast: she
  wanted to feel his kisses on her lips, her eyes. If he had asked her at that
  moment to run away with him, to commit the maddest folly, she would have
  consented joyously, for her love for the man was surging up like a bubbling
  stream of subterranean fire that had found its vent, overwhelming and burning
  all reason, all tradition.</p>

  <p>Instead, he sat by her side, holding her hand and dreaming of the golden
  future which awaited him.</p>

  <p>"Good night, Jim." Her voice sounded cold and a little dispirited as she
  put her gloved hand in his at the door of 409.</p>

  <p>"Good night," he said in a low voice, and kissed her hand. She was nearly
  in tears when she went into her room and shut the door behind her. She walked
  to her dressing-table and looked in the glass, long and inquiringly, and then
  she shook her head. "I wish he wasn't so good," she said, "or else more of a
  hero!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15"></a>CHAPTER 15</h2>

  <p class="first">JIM continued his journey to the flat, so enveloped in the
  rosy clouds which had descended upon him that he was unconscious of time or
  space, and it seemed that he had only stepped into the cab when it jerked to
  a halt before the portals of Featherdale Mansions. He might have continued in
  his dream without interruption had not the cabman, with some asperity, called
  him back to remind him that he had not paid his fare.</p>

  <p>That brought him back to the earth.</p>

  <p>As he was about to open the outer door of the flats (it was closed at
  eleven every night) the door opened of its own accord and he stepped back to
  allow a lady to pass. She was dressed from head to foot in black and she
  passed him without a word, he staring after her as she walked with quick
  steps to a motor-car that he had noticed drawn up a few yards from where his
  cab had stopped. Who was she? he wondered as the car passed out of sight.</p>

  <p>He dismissed her from his thoughts, for the glamour of the evening was not
  yet passed, and for an hour he sat in his big chair, staring into vacancy and
  recalling every incident of that previous evening. He could not believe it
  was true that this half-divine being was to be his; and then, with a deep
  sigh, he aroused himself to a sense of reality.</p>

  <p>There was work to be done, he thought, as he rose to his feet, and it was
  work for her. His income was a small one, and must be considerably augmented
  before he dare ask this beautiful lady to share his lot.</p>

  <p>He glanced idly at the table. That afternoon he had been writing up his
  notes of the case and the book was still where he had left it, only -</p>

  <p>He could have sworn he had left it open. He had a remarkable memory for
  little things, tiny details of placements and position, and he was sure the
  book had not only been closed, but that its position had been changed.</p>

  <p>A woman came in the mornings to clean the flat and make his bed and
  invariably he let her in himself. She usually arrived when he was making his
  own breakfast - another fad of his. She had no key, and under any
  circumstances never came at night.</p>

  <p>He opened the book and almost jumped.</p>

  <p>Between the pages, marking the place where he had been writing, was a key
  of a peculiar design. Attached to the handle was a tiny label on which was
  written: "D.G.'s master key."</p>

  <p>This time there was no sign of the Blue Hand, but he recognized the
  writing. It was the same which had appeared on the warning card which the
  girl had received.</p>

  <p>The woman in black had been to his flat - and had left him the means to
  enter Digby Groat's premises!</p>

  <p>"Phew!" whistled Jim in amazement.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16"></a>CHAPTER 16</h2>

  <p class="first">EUNICE woke in the morning with a queer little sense of
  disappointment. It was not until she was thoroughly awake, sitting up in bed
  and sipping the fragrant tea which the maid had brought her, that she
  analysed the cause. Then she laughed at herself.</p>

  <p>"Eunice Weldon," she said, shaking her head sadly, "you're a bold woman!
  Because the best man in the world was too good, too silly, or too frightened,
  to kiss you, you are working up a grievance. In the first place, Eunice
  Weldon, you shouldn't have proposed to a man. It was unladylike and certain
  to lead to your feeling cheap. You should have been content to wait for the
  beautiful carpet under your feet and the mansion over your head, and should
  have despised the bare boards of an attic overlooking the railway. I don't
  suppose they are bare boards, Eunice," she mused. "They are certain to be
  very nicely covered and there will be all sorts of mementos of Jim's
  campaigns hanging on the walls or tucked away in odd little cupboards. And
  I'm sure, when the trains are not rattling past, that the view from the
  window is beautiful, and, anyway, I shouldn't have time to look out of the
  window. There would be Jim's shirts to mend, Jim's socks to darn, and -
  Eunice Weldon, get up!" she said hurriedly as she slipped out of bed.</p>

  <p>Going along the corridor Digby Groat heard the sound of her fresh young
  voice singing in the bathroom, and he smiled.</p>

  <p>The ripe beauty of the girl had come on him with a rush. She was no longer
  desirable, she was necessary. He had intended to make her his plaything, he
  was as determined now that she should be his decoration. He laughed aloud at
  the little conceit! A decoration! Something that would enhance him in the
  eyes of his fellows. Even marriage would be a small price to pay for the
  possession of that jewel.</p>

  <p>Jackson saw him smiling as he came down the stairs.</p>

  <p>"Another box of chocolates has arrived, sir," he said in a low voice, as
  though he were imparting a shameful secret.</p>

  <p>"Throw them in the ashpit, or give them to my mother," said Digby
  carelessly, and Jackson stared at him.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you - " he began.</p>

  <p>"Don't ask so many questions, Jackson." Digby turned his glittering eyes
  upon his servant and there was an ugly look in his face. "You are getting
  just a little too interested in things, my friend. And whilst we are on this
  matter, let me say, Jackson, that when you speak to Miss Weldon I want you to
  take that damned grin off your face and talk as a servant to a lady; do you
  understand that?"</p>

  <p>"I'm no servant," said the man sullenly.</p>

  <p>"That is the part you are playing now, so play it," said Digby, "and don't
  sulk with me, or - "</p>

  <p>His hand went up to a rack hanging on the wall, where reposed a collection
  of hunting-crops, and his fingers closed over the nearest.</p>

  <p>The man started back.</p>

  <p>"I didn't mean anything," he whined, his face livid. "I've tried to be
  respectful - "</p>

  <p>"Get my letters," said Digby curtly, "and bring them into the
  dining-room."</p>

  <p>Eunice came into the room at that moment.</p>

  <p>"Good morning. Miss Weldon," said Digby, pulling out her chair from the
  table. "Did you have a nice dinner?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, splendid," she said, and then changed the conversation.</p>

  <p>She was dreading the possibility of his turning the conversation to the
  previous night, and was glad when the meal was finished.</p>

  <p>Digby's attitude, however, was most correct. He spoke of general topics,
  and did not touch upon her outing, and when she went to Mrs. Groat's room to
  play at work, for it was only playing, the real work had been done, he did
  not, as she feared he might, follow her.</p>

  <p>Digby waited until the doctor called, and waylaying him in the passage
  learnt that his mother had completely recovered, and though a recurrence of
  the stroke was possible, it was not immediately likely. He had a few words to
  say to her that morning.</p>

  <p>Old Mrs. Groat sat by the window in a wheeled chair, a huddled, unlovely
  figure, her dark gloomy eyes surveyed without interest the stately square
  with its green leafy centrepiece. The change of seasons had for her no other
  significance than a change of clothing. The wild heart which once leapt to
  the call of spring, beat feebly in a body in which passion had burnt itself
  to bitter ashes. And yet the gnarled hands, crossing and re-crossing each
  other on her lap, had once touched and blessed as they had touched and
  blasted.</p>

  <p>Once or twice her mind went to this new girl, Eunice Weldon. There was no
  ray of pity in her thought. If Digby wanted the girl, he would take her, and
  her fate interested old Jane Groat no more than the fate of the fly that
  buzzed upon the window, and whom a flick of her handkerchief presently swept
  from existence. There was more reason why the girl should go if... she
  frowned. The scar on the wrist was much bigger than a sixpence. It was
  probably a coincidence.</p>

  <p>She hoped that Digby would concentrate on his new quest and leave her
  alone. She was mortally afraid of him, fearing in her own heart the length to
  which he would go to have his will. She knew that her life would be snuffed
  out, like the flame of a candle, if it were expedient for Digby to remove
  her. When she had recovered consciousness and found herself in charge of a
  nurse, her first thought had been of wonder that Digby had allowed her to
  revive. He knew nothing of the will, she thought, and a twisted smile broke
  upon the lined face. There was a surprise in store for him. She would not be
  there to see it, that was the pity. But she could gloat in anticipation over
  his chagrin and his impotent rage.</p>

  <p>The handle of the door turned and there followed a whispered conversation.
  Presently the door closed again.</p>

  <p>"How are you this morning, mother?" said the pleasant voice of Digby, and
  she blinked round at him in a flutter of agitation.</p>

  <p>"Very well, my boy, very well," she said tremulously. "Won't you sit
  down?" She glanced nervously about for the nurse, but the woman had gone.
  "Will you tell the nurse I want her, my boy?" she began.</p>

  <p>"The nurse can wait," said her dutiful son coolly. "There are one or two
  things I want to talk to you about before she returns. But principally I want
  to know why you executed a will in favour of Estremeda and left me with a
  beggarly twenty thousand pounds to face the world?"</p>

  <p>She nearly collapsed with the shock.</p>

  <p>"A will, my boy?" She whined the words. "What on earth are you talking
  about?"</p>

  <p>"The will which you made and put into that secret drawer of your cabinet,"
  he said patiently, "and don't tell me that I'm dreaming, or that you did it
  for a joke, or that it was an act of mental aberration on your part. Tell me
  the truth!"</p>

  <p>"It was a will I made years ago, my dear," she quavered. "When I thought
  twenty thousand pounds was all the money I possessed."</p>

  <p>"You're a liar," said Digby without heat. "And a stupid old liar. You made
  that will to spite me, you old devil!"</p>

  <p>She was staring at him in horror.</p>

  <p>Digby was most dangerous when he talked in that cool, even tone of
  his.</p>

  <p>"I have destroyed the precious document," said Digby Groat in the same
  conversational voice, "and when you see Miss Weldon, who witnessed its
  destruction, I would be glad if you would tell her that the will she saw
  consumed was one which you made when you were not quite right in your
  head."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Groat was incapable of speech. Her chin trembled convulsively and her
  only thought was how she could attract the attention of the nurse.</p>

  <p>"Put my chair back against the bed, Digby," she said faintly. "The light
  is too strong."</p>

  <p>He hesitated, but did as she asked, then seeing her hand close upon the
  bell-push which hung by the side of the bed, he laughed.</p>

  <p>"You need not be afraid, mother," he said contemptuously, "I did not
  intend taking any other action than I have already taken. Remember that your
  infernal nurse will not be here all the time, and do as I ask you. I will
  send Miss Weldon up to you in a few minutes on the excuse of taking
  instructions from you and answering some letters which came for you this
  morning. Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>She nodded, and at that moment the nurse came in.</p>

  <p>Summoned to the sick-room, Eunice found her employer looking more feeble
  than she had appeared before she was stricken down. The old woman's eyes
  smouldered their hate, as the girl came into the room. She guessed it was
  Eunice who had discovered the will and loathed her, but fear was the greater
  in her, and after the few letters had been formally answered, Mrs. Groat
  stopped the girl, who was in the act of rising.</p>

  <p>"Sit down again, Miss Weldon," she said. "I wanted to tell you about a
  will of mine that you found. I'm very glad you discovered it. I had forgotten
  that I had made it."</p>

  <p>Every word was strained and hateful to utter.</p>

  <p>"You see, my dear young woman, I sometimes suffer from a curious lapse of
  memory, and - and - that will was made when I was suffering from an attack -
  "</p>

  <p>Eunice listened to the halting words and was under the impression that the
  hesitation was due to the old woman's weakness.</p>

  <p>"I quite understand, Mrs. Groat," she said sympathetically. "Your son told
  me."</p>

  <p>"He told you, did he?" said Jane Groat, returning to her contemplation of
  the window; then, when Eunice was waiting for her dismissal, "Are you a great
  friend of my son's?"</p>

  <p>Eunice smiled.</p>

  <p>"No, not a great friend, Mrs. Groat," she said.</p>

  <p>"You will be," said the woman, "greater than you imagine," and there was
  such malignity in the tone that the girl shuddered.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17"></a>CHAPTER 17</h2>

  <p class="first">JIM loved London, the noise and the smell of it. He loved
  its gentle thunders, its ineradicable good-humour, its sublime muddle. Paris
  depressed him, with its air of gaiety and the underlying fierceness of life's
  struggle. There was no rest in the soul of Paris. It was a city of strenuous
  bargaining, of ruthless exploitation. Brussels was a dumpy undergrown Paris,
  Berlin a stucco Gomorrah, Madrid an extinct crater beneath which a new
  volcanic stream was seeking a vent.</p>

  <p>New York he loved, a city of steel and concrete teeming with
  sentimentalists posing as tyrants. There was nothing quite like New York in
  the world. Dante in his most prodigal mood might have dreamt New York and da
  Vinci might have planned it, but only the high gods could have materialized
  the dream or built to the master's plan. But London was London -
  incomparable, beautiful. It was the history of the world and the mark of
  civilization. He made a detour and passed through Covent Garden.</p>

  <p>The blazing colour and fragrance of it! Jim could have lingered all the
  morning in the draughty halls, but he was due at the office to meet Mr.
  Salter.</p>

  <p>Almost the first question that the lawyer asked him was:</p>

  <p>"Have you investigated Selengers?"</p>

  <p>The identity of the mysterious Selengers had been forgotten for the
  moment, Jim admitted.</p>

  <p>"You ought to know who they are," said the lawyer. "You will probably
  discover that Groat or his mother are behind them. The fact that the offices
  were once the property of Danton rather supports this idea - though theories
  are an abomination to me!"</p>

  <p>Jim agreed. There were so many issues to the case that he had almost lost
  sight of his main object.</p>

  <p>"The more I think of it," he confessed "the more useless my search seems
  to me, Mr. Salter. If I find Lady Mary, you say that I shall be no nearer to
  frustrating the Groats?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Septimus Salter did not immediately reply. He had said as much, but
  subsequently had amended his point of view. Theories, as he had so
  emphatically stated, were abominable alternatives to facts, and yet he could
  not get out of his head that if the theory he had formed to account for Lady
  Mary Danton's obliteration were substantiated, a big step would have been
  taken toward clearing up a host of minor mysteries.</p>

  <p>"Go ahead with Selengers," he said at last; "possibly you may find that
  their inquiries are made as much to find Lady Mary as to establish the
  identity of your young friend. At any rate, you can't be doing much
  harm."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18"></a>CHAPTER 18</h2>

  <p class="first">AT twelve o'clock that night Eunice heard a car draw up in
  front of the house. She had not yet retired, and she stepped out on to the
  balcony as Digby Groat ascended the steps.</p>

  <p>Eunice closed the door and pulled the curtains across. She was not tired
  enough to go to bed. She had very foolishly succumbed to the temptation to
  take a doze that afternoon, and to occupy her time she had brought up the
  last bundle of accounts, unearthed from a box in the wine-cellar, and had
  spent the evening tabulating them.</p>

  <p>She finished the last account, and fixing a rubber band round them, rose
  and stretched herself, and then she heard a sound; a stealthy foot upon the
  stone of the balcony floor. There was no mistaking it. She had never heard it
  before on the occasion of the earlier visits. She switched out the light,
  drew back the curtains noiselessly and softly unlocked the French window. She
  listened. There it was again. She felt no fear, only the thrill of impending
  discovery. Suddenly she jerked open the window and stepped out, and for a
  time saw nothing, then as her eyes grew accustomed to the darkness, she saw
  something crouching against the wall.</p>

  <p>"Who is that?" she cried.</p>

  <p>There was no reply for a little time; then the voice said:</p>

  <p>"I am awfully sorry to have frightened you, Eunice."</p>

  <p>It was Jim Steele.</p>

  <p>"Jim!" she gasped incredulously, and then a wave of anger swept over her.
  So it had been Jim all the time and not a woman! Jim, who had been supporting
  his prejudices by these contemptible tricks. Her anger was unreasonable, but
  it was very real and born of the shock of disillusionment. She remembered in
  a flash how sympathetic Jim had been when she told him of the midnight
  visitor and how he had pretended to be puzzled. So he was fooling her all the
  time. It was hateful of him!</p>

  <p>"I think you had better go," she said coldly.</p>

  <p>"Let me explain, Eunice."</p>

  <p>"I don't think any explanation is necessary," she said. "Really, Jim, it
  is despicable of you."</p>

  <p>She went back to her room with a wildly beating heart. She could have wept
  for vexation. Jim! He was the mysterious Blue Hand, she thought indignantly,
  and he had made a laughing-stock of her! Probably he was the writer of the
  letters, too, and had been in her room that night. She stamped her foot in
  her anger. She hated him for deceiving her. She hated him for shattering the
  idol she had set up in her heart. She had never felt so unutterably miserable
  as she was when she flung herself on her bed and wept until she fell asleep
  from sheer exhaustion.</p>

  <p>"Damn!" muttered Jim as he slipped out of the house and strode in search
  of his muddy little car. An unprofitable evening had ended tragically.</p>

  <p>"Bungling, heavy-footed jackass," he growled savagely, as he spun
  perilously round a corner and nearly into a taxi-cab which had ventured to
  the wrong side of the road. But he was not cursing the cab-driver. It was his
  own stupidity which had led him to test the key which had made a remarkable
  appearance on his table the night before. He had gone on to the balcony,
  merely to examine the fastenings of the girl's window, with the idea of
  judging her security.</p>

  <p>He felt miserable and would have been glad to talk his trouble over with
  somebody. But there was nobody he could think of, nobody whom he liked well
  enough, unless it was - Mrs. Fane. He half smiled at the thought and wondered
  what that invalid lady would think of him if he knocked her up at this hour
  to pour his woes into her sympathetic ears! The sweet, sad-faced woman had
  made a very deep impression upon him; he was surprised to find how often she
  came into his thoughts.</p>

  <p>Half-way up Baker Street he brought his car to a walking pace and turned.
  He had remembered Selengers, and it had just occurred to him that at this
  hour he was more likely to profit by a visit than by a daytime call. It was
  nearly two o'clock when he stopped in Brade Street and descended.</p>

  <p>He remembered the janitor had told him that there was a side entrance,
  which was used alone by Selengers. He found the narrow court which led to the
  back of the building, and after a little search discovered what was evidently
  the door which would bring him through the courtyard to the back of Brade
  Street Buildings. He tried the door, and to his surprise it was unlocked.
  Hearing the soft pad of the policeman's feet in the street, and not wishing
  to be discovered trying strange doors at that hour, he passed through and
  closed it behind him, waiting till the officer had passed before he continued
  his investigations.</p>

  <p>In preparation for such a contingency, he had brought with him a small
  electric lamp, and with the aid of this he found his way across the paved
  yard to a door which opened into the building. This was locked, he discovered
  to his dismay. There must be another, he thought, and began looking for it.
  There were windows overlooking the courtyard, but these were so carefully
  shuttered that it was impossible to tell whether lights shone behind them or
  not.</p>

  <p>He found the other entrance at an angle of two walls, tried it, and to his
  delight it opened. He was in a short stone corridor and at the farther end
  was a barred gate. Short of this and to the right was a green door. He turned
  the handle softly, and as it opened he saw that a brilliant light was burning
  within. He pushed it farther and stepped into the room.</p>

  <p>He was in an office which was unfurnished except for a table and a chair,
  but it was not the desolate appearance of the apartment which held his
  eye.</p>

  <p>As he had entered a woman, dressed from head to foot in black, was passing
  to a second room, and at the sound of the door she turned quickly and drew
  her veil over her face. But she had delayed that action a little too long,
  and Jim, with a gasp of amazement, had looked upon the face of that
  "incurable invalid" Mrs. Fane!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19"></a>CHAPTER 19</h2>

  <p class="first">"WHO are you, and what do you want?" she asked. He saw her
  hand drop to the fold of her dress, then: "Mr. Steele," she said as she
  recognized him.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry to disturb you," said Jim as he closed the door behind him,
  "but I wanted to see you pretty badly."</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Mr. Steele. Did you see my - " she hesitated, "see my
  face?"</p>

  <p>He nodded gravely.</p>

  <p>"And did you recognize me?"</p>

  <p>He nodded again.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you are Mrs. Fane," he said quietly.</p>

  <p>Slowly her hands rose and she unpinned the veil.</p>

  <p>"You may lock the door," she said; "yes, I am Mrs. Fane."</p>

  <p>He was so bewildered, despite his seeming self-possession, that he had
  nothing to say.</p>

  <p>"You probably think that I have been practising a wicked and mean
  deception," she said, "but there are reasons - excellent reasons - why I
  should not be abroad in the daytime, and why, if I were traced to Featherdale
  Mansions, I should not be identified with the woman who walks at night."</p>

  <p>"Then it was you who left the key?" he said.</p>

  <p>She nodded, and all the time her eyes never left his face.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I cannot enlighten you any farther," she said, "partly
  because I am not prepared at this moment to reveal my hand and partly because
  there is so little that I could reveal if I did."</p>

  <p>And only a few minutes before he had been thinking how jolly it would be
  if he could lay all his troubles and perplexities before her. It was
  incredible that he should be talking with her at this midnight hour in a
  prosaic city office. He looked at the delicate white hand which rested
  against her breast and smiled, and she, with her quick perceptions, guessed
  the cause of his amusement.</p>

  <p>"You are thinking of the Blue Hand?" she said quickly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am thinking of the Blue Hand," said Jim.</p>

  <p>"You have an idea that that is just a piece of chicanery and that the hand
  has no significance?" she asked quietly.</p>

  <p>"Curiously enough, I don't think that," said Jim. "I believe behind that
  symbol is a very interesting story, but you must tell it in your own time,
  Mrs. Fane."</p>

  <p>She paced the room deep in thought, her hands clasped before her, her chin
  on her breast, and he waited, wondering how this strange discovery would
  develop.</p>

  <p>"You came because you heard from South Africa that I had been making
  inquiries about the girl - she is not in danger?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Jim with a wry face. "At present I am in danger of having
  offended her beyond pardon."</p>

  <p>She looked at him sharply, but did not ask for an explanation.</p>

  <p>"If you had thought my warnings were theatrical and meaningless, I should
  not have blamed you," she said after a while, "but I had to reach her in some
  way that would impress her."</p>

  <p>"There is something I cannot understand, Mrs. Fane," said Jim. "Suppose
  Eunice had told Digby Groat of this warning?"</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"He knows," she said quietly, and Jim remembered the hand on the
  laboratory door. "No, he is not the person who will understand what it all
  means," she said. "As to your Eunice," her lips parted in a dazzling little
  smile, "I would not like any harm to come to the child."</p>

  <p>"Have you any special reason for wishing to protect her?" asked Jim.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I thought I had a month ago," she said. "I thought she was somebody whom
  I was seeking. A chance resemblance, fleeting and elusive, brought me to her;
  she was one of the shadows I pursued," she said with a bitter little smile,
  "one of the ghosts that led nowhere. She interested me. Her beauty, her fresh
  innocence and her character have fascinated me, even though she has ceased to
  be the real object of my search. And you, Mr. Steele. She interests you too?"
  She eyed him keenly.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Jim, "she interests me too."</p>

  <p>"Do you love her?"</p>

  <p>The question was so unexpected that Jim for once was not prepared with an
  answer. He was a reticent man ordinarily, and now that the opportunity
  presented he could not discuss the state of his feelings towards Eunice.</p>

  <p>"If you do not really love her," said the woman, "do not hurt her, Mr.
  Steele. She is a very young girl, too good to be the passing amusement that
  Digby Groat intends she shall be."</p>

  <p>"Does he?" said Jim between his teeth.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"There is a great future for you, and I hope that you will not ruin that
  career by an infatuation which has the appearance at the moment of being
  love."</p>

  <p>He looked at the flushed and animated face and thought that next to Eunice
  she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen.</p>

  <p>"I am almost at the end of my pursuit," she went on, "and once we can
  bring Digby Groat and his mother to book, my work will be done." She shook
  her head sadly. "I have no further hope, no further hope," she said.</p>

  <p>"Hope of what?" asked Jim.</p>

  <p>"Finding what I sought," said Mrs. Fane, and her luminous eyes were fixed
  on his. "But I was mad, I sought that which is beyond recall, and I must use
  the remaining years of my life for such happiness as God will send to me.
  Forty-three years of waste!" she threw out her arms with a passionate
  gesture. "Forty-three years of suffering. A loveless childhood, a loveless
  marriage, a bitter betrayal. I have lost everything, Mr. Steele, everything.
  Husband and child and hope."</p>

  <p>Jim started back.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" he said, "then you are - "</p>

  <p>"I am Lady Mary Danton." She looked at him strangely. "I thought you had
  guessed that."</p>

  <p>Lady Mary Danton!</p>

  <p>Then his search was ended, thought Jim with dismay. A queer unsatisfactory
  ending, which brought him no nearer to reward or advancement, both of which
  were so vitally necessary now.</p>

  <p>"You look disappointed," she said, "and yet you had set yourself out to
  find Lady Mary."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"And you have found her. Is she less attractive than you had
  imagined?"</p>

  <p>He did not reply. He could not tell her that his real search had not been
  for her, but for her dead child.</p>

  <p>"Do you know I have been seeing you every day for months, Mr. Steele?" she
  asked. "I have sat by your side in railway trains, in tube trains, and even
  stood by your side in tube lifts," she said with the ghost of a smile. "I
  have watched you and studied you and I have liked you."</p>

  <p>She said the last words deliberately and her beautiful hand rested for a
  second on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Search your heart about Eunice," she said, "and if you find that you are
  mistaken in your sentiments, remember that there is a great deal of happiness
  to be found in this world." There was no mistaking her meaning.</p>

  <p>"I love Eunice," said Jim quietly, and the hand that rested on his
  shoulder was withdrawn, "I love her as I shall never love any other woman in
  life. She is the beginning and end of my dreams." He did not look up at the
  woman, but he could hear her quick breathing. Presently she said in a low
  voice:</p>

  <p>"I was afraid so - I was afraid so." And then Jim, whose moral courage was
  beyond question, rose and faced her.</p>

  <p>"Lady Mary," he said quietly, "you have abandoned hope that you will ever
  find your daughter?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Suppose Eunice were your daughter? Would you give her to me?" She raised
  her eyes to his.</p>

  <p>"I would give her to you with thankfulness," she said, "for you are the
  one man in the world whom I would desire any girl I loved to marry " - she
  shook her head. "But you, too, are pursuing shadows," she said. "Eunice is
  not my daughter - I have traced her parentage and there is no doubt at all
  upon the matter. She is the daughter of a South African musician."</p>

  <p>"Have you seen the scar on her wrist?" he asked slowly. It was his last
  hope of identification, and when she shook her head, his heart sank.</p>

  <p>"I did not know that she had a scar on her wrist. What kind of a scar is
  it?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"A small round burn the size of a sixpence," said Jim.</p>

  <p>"My baby had no such mark - she had no blemish whatever."</p>

  <p>"Nothing that would have induced some evilly disposed person to
  remove?"</p>

  <p>Lady Mary shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," she said faintly. "You are chasing shadows, Mr. Steele, almost
  as persistently as I have done. Now let me tell you something about myself,"
  she said, "and I warn you that I am not going to elucidate the mystery of my
  disappearance - that can wait. This building is mine," she said. "I am the
  proprietor of the whole block. My husband bought it and in a moment of
  unexampled generosity presented it to me the day after its purchase. In fact,
  it was mine when it was supposed to be his. He was not a generous man," she
  said sadly, "but I will not speak of his treatment of me. This property has
  provided me with an income ample for my needs, and I have, too, a fortune
  which I inherited from my father. We were desperately poor when I married Mr.
  Danton," she explained, "and only a week or two later my father's cousin,
  Lord Pethingham, died, and father inherited a very large sum of money, the
  greater portion of which came to me."</p>

  <p>"Who is Madge Benson?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Need you ask that?" she said. "She is my servant."</p>

  <p>"Why did she go to prison?"</p>

  <p>He saw the woman's lips close tight.</p>

  <p>"You must promise not to ask questions about the past until I am ready to
  tell you, Mr. Steele," she said, "and now I think you can see me home." She
  looked round the office. "There are usually a dozen cablegrams to be seen and
  answered. A confidential clerk of mine comes in the morning to attend to the
  dispatch of wires which I leave for him. I have made myself a nuisance to
  every town clerk in the world, from Buenos Ayres to Shanghai," she said with
  a whimsical laugh in which there was a note of pain. "'The shadow he pursueth
  - ' You know the old Biblical lines, Mr. Steele, and I am so tired of my
  pursuit, so very tired!"</p>

  <p>"And is it ended now?" asked Jim.</p>

  <p>"Not yet," said Lady Mary, and suddenly her voice grew hard and
  determined. "No, we've still got a lot of work before us, Jim - " She used
  the word shyly and laughed like a child when she saw him colour. "Even Eunice
  will not mind my calling you Jim," she said, "and it is such a nice name,
  easily remembered, and it has the advantage of not being a popular nickname
  for dogs and cats."</p>

  <p>He was dying to ask her why, if she was so well off, she had taken up her
  residence in a little flat overlooking a railway line, and it was probable
  that had he asked her, he would have received an unsatisfactory reply.</p>

  <p>He took leave of her at her door.</p>

  <p>"Good night, neighbour," he smiled.</p>

  <p>"Good night, Jim," she said softly.</p>

  <p>And Jim was still sitting in his big arm-chair pondering the events of the
  night when the first rays of the rising sun made a golden pattern upon the
  blind.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20"></a>CHAPTER 20</h2>

  <p class="first">EARLY the next morning a district messenger arrived at the
  flat with a letter from Eunice, and he groaned before he opened it.</p>

  <p>She had written it in the hurt of her discovery and there were phrases
  which made him wince.</p>

  <p>"I never dreamt it was you, and after all the pretence you made that this
  was a woman! It wasn't fair of you, Jim. To secure a sensation you nearly
  frightened me to death on my first night here, and made me look ridiculous in
  order that I might fall into your waiting arms! I see it all now. You do not
  like Mr. Groat, and were determined that I should leave his house, and this
  is the method which you have followed. I shall find it very hard to forgive
  you and perhaps you had better not see me again until you hear from me."</p>

  <p>"Oh, damn," said Jim for the fortieth time since he had left her.</p>

  <p>What could he do? He wrote half a dozen letters and tore them all up,
  every one of them into shreds. He could not explain to her how the key came
  into his possession without betraying Lady Mary Danton's secret. And now he
  would find it more difficult than ever to convince her that Digby Groat was
  an unscrupulous villain. The position was hopeless and he groaned again. Then
  a thought struck him and he crossed the landing to the next flat.</p>

  <p>Madge Benson opened the door and this time regarded him a little more
  favourably.</p>

  <p>"My lady is asleep," she said. She knew that Jim was aware of Mrs. Fane's
  identity.</p>

  <p>"Do you think you could wake her? It is rather important."</p>

  <p>"I will see," said Madge Benson, and disappeared into the bedroom. She
  returned in a few moments. "Madame is awake. She heard your knock," she said.
  "Will you go in?"</p>

  <p>Lady Mary was lying on the bed fully dressed, wrapped in a dressing-gown,
  and she took the letter from Jim's hand which he handed her without a word,
  and read.</p>

  <p>"Have patience," she said as she handed it back. "She will understand in
  time."</p>

  <p>"And in the meanwhile," said Jim, his heart heavy, "anything can happen to
  her! This is the very thing I didn't want to occur."</p>

  <p>"You went to the house. Did you discover anything?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Take no notice and do not worry," said Lady Mary, settling down in the
  bed and closing her eyes, "and now please let me sleep, Mr. Steele; I have
  not been to bed for twenty-four hours."</p>

  <p>Eunice had not dispatched the messenger with the letter to Jim five
  minutes before she regretted the impulse which had made her write it. She had
  said bitter things which she did not really feel. It was an escapade of his
  which ought to be forgiven, because at the back of it, she thought, was his
  love for her. She had further reason to doubt her wisdom, when, going into
  Digby Groat's library she found him studying a large photograph.</p>

  <p>"That is very good, considering it was taken in artificial light," he
  said. It was an enlarged photograph of his laboratory door bearing the blue
  imprint, and so carefully had the photographer done his work, that every line
  and whorl of the finger-tips showed.</p>

  <p>"It is a woman's hand, of course," he said.</p>

  <p>"A woman!" she gasped. "Are you sure?"</p>

  <p>He looked up in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Of course I'm sure," said Digby; "look at the size of it! It is much too
  small for a man."</p>

  <p>So she had wronged Jim cruelly! And yet what was he doing there in the
  house? How had he got in? The whole thing was so inexplicable that she gave
  it up, only - she must tell Jim and ask him to forgive her.</p>

  <p>As soon as she was free she went to the telephone. Jim was not in the
  office.</p>

  <p>"Who is it speaking?" asked the voice of the clerk.</p>

  <p>"Never mind," said the girl hurriedly, and hung up the receiver.</p>

  <p>All day long she was haunted by the thought of the injustice she had done
  the man she loved. He would send her a note, she thought, or would call her
  up, and at every ring of the telephone the blood came into her face, only to
  recede when she heard the answer, and discovered the caller was some person
  in whom she had no interest.</p>

  <p>That day was one of the longest she had ever spent in her life. There was
  practically no work to do, and even the dubious entertainment of Digby was
  denied her. He went out in the morning and did not come back until late in
  the afternoon, going out again as soon as he had changed his clothes.</p>

  <p>She ate her dinner in solitude and was comforted by the thought that she
  would soon be free from this employment. She had written to her old employer
  and he had answered by return of post, saying how glad he would be if he
  could get her back. Then they could have their little tea-parties all over
  again, she thought, and Jim, free of this obsession about Digby Groat, would
  be his old cheerful self.</p>

  <p>The nurse was going out that evening and Mrs. Groat sent for her. She
  hated the girl, but she hated the thought of being alone much more.</p>

  <p>"I want you to sit here with me until the nurse comes home," she said.
  "You can take a book and read, but don't fidget."</p>

  <p>Eunice smiled to herself and went in search of a book.</p>

  <p>She came back in time to find Mrs. Groat hiding something beneath her
  pillow. They sat in silence for an hour, the old woman playing with her hands
  on her lap, her head sunk forward, deep in thought, the girl trying to read,
  and finding it very difficult. Jim's face so constantly came between her and
  the printed page, that she would have been glad for an excuse to put down the
  book, glad for any diversion.</p>

  <p>It was Mrs. Groat who provided her with an escape from her ennui.</p>

  <p>"Where did you get that scar on your wrist?" she asked, looking up.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Eunice. "I have had it ever since I was a baby. I
  think I must have been burnt."</p>

  <p>There was another long silence.</p>

  <p>"Where were you born?"</p>

  <p>"In South Africa," said the girl.</p>

  <p>Again there was an interval, broken only by the creak of Mrs. Groat's
  chair.</p>

  <p>In sheer desperation, for the situation was getting on her nerves, Eunice
  said: "I found an old miniature of yours the other day, Mrs. Groat."</p>

  <p>The woman fixed her with her dark eyes.</p>

  <p>"Of me?" she said, and then, "Oh, yes, I remember. Well? Did you think it
  looks like me?" she asked sourly.</p>

  <p>"I think it was probably like you years ago. I could trace a resemblance,"
  said Eunice diplomatically.</p>

  <p>The answer seemed to amuse Jane Groat. She had a mordant sense of humour,
  the girl was to discover.</p>

  <p>"Like me when I was like that, eh?" she said. "Do you think I was
  pretty?"</p>

  <p>Here Eunice could speak whole-heartedly and without evasion.</p>

  <p>"I think you were very beautiful," she said warmly.</p>

  <p>"I was, too," said the woman, speaking half to herself. "My father tried
  to bury me in a dead-and-alive village. He thought I was too attractive for
  town. A wicked, heartless brute of a man," she said, and the girl was
  somewhat shocked.</p>

  <p>Apparently the old doctrine of filial piety did not run in Jane Groat's
  family.</p>

  <p>"When I was a girl," the old woman went on, "the head of the family was
  the family tyrant, and lived for the exercise of his power. My father hated
  me from the moment I was born and I hated him from the moment I began to
  think."</p>

  <p>Eunice said nothing. She had not invited the confidence, nevertheless it
  fascinated her to hear this woman draw aside the veil which hid the past.
  What great tragedy had happened, she speculated, that had turned the
  beautiful original of the miniature into this hard and evil-looking
  woman?</p>

  <p>"Men would run after me, Miss Weldon," she said with a curious
  complacence. "Men whose names are famous throughout the world."</p>

  <p>The girl remembered the Marquis of Estremeda and wondered whether her
  generosity to him was due to the part he had played as pursuing lover.</p>

  <p>"There was one man who loved me," said the old woman reflectively, "but he
  didn't love me well enough. He must have heard something, I suppose, because
  he was going to marry me and then he broke it off and married a simpering
  fool of a girl from Malaga."</p>

  <p>She chuckled to herself. She had had no intention of discussing her
  private affairs with Eunice Weldon, but something had started her on a train
  of reminiscence. Besides, she regarded Eunice already as an unofficial member
  of the family. Digby would tell her sooner or later. She might as well know
  from her, she thought.</p>

  <p>"He was a Marquis," she went on, "a hard man, too, and he treated me
  badly. My father never forgave me after I came back, and never spoke another
  word in his life, although he lived for nearly twenty years."</p>

  <p>After she had come back, thought Eunice. Then she had gone away with this
  Marquis? The Marquis of Estremeda. And then he had deserted her, and had
  married this "simpering fool" from Malaga. Gradually the story was revealing
  itself before her eyes.</p>

  <p>"What happened to the girl?" she asked gently. She was almost afraid to
  speak unless she stopped the loquacious woman.</p>

  <p>"She died," said Mrs. Groat with a thin smile. "He said I killed her. I
  only told her the truth. Besides, I owed him something," she frowned. "I wish
  I hadn't," she muttered, "I wish I hadn't. Sometimes the ghost of her comes
  into this room and looks down at me with her deep black eyes and tells me
  that I killed her!" She mumbled something, and again with that note of
  complacency in her voice:</p>

  <p>"When she heard that my child was the son - " she stopped quickly and
  looked round. "What am I talking about?" she said gruffly.</p>

  <p>Eunice held her breath. Now she knew the secret of this strange household!
  Jim had told her something about it; told her of the little shipping clerk
  who had married Mrs. Groat, and for whom she had so profound a contempt. A
  shipping clerk from the old man's office, whom he had paid to marry the girl
  that her shame should be hidden.</p>

  <p>Digby Groat was actually the son of - the Marquis of Estremeda! In law he
  was not even the heir to the Danton millions!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21"></a>CHAPTER 21</h2>

  <p class="first">EUNICE could only stare at the old woman. "Get on with your
  book," grumbled Mrs. Groat pettishly, and the girl, looking up through her
  lashes, saw the suspicious eyes fixed on her and the tremulous mouth moving
  as though she were speaking.</p>

  <p>She must tell Jim. Despite her sense of loyalty, she realized that this
  was imperative. Jim was vitally interested in the disposal of the Danton
  estate, and he must know.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the old woman began speaking again.</p>

  <p>"What did I tell you just now?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"You were talking about your youth," said the girl.</p>

  <p>"Did I say anything about - a man?" asked the old woman suspiciously. She
  had forgotten! Eunice forced the lie to her lips.</p>

  <p>"No," she replied, so loudly that anybody but this muddled woman would
  have known she was not speaking the truth.</p>

  <p>"Be careful of my son," said Mrs. Groat after a while. "Don't cross him.
  He's not a bad lad, not a bad lad " - she shook her head and glanced slyly at
  the girl. "He is like his father in many ways."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Groat?" said Eunice, and felt inexpressively mean at taking advantage
  of the woman's infirmity, but she steeled her heart with the thought that Jim
  must benefit by her knowledge.</p>

  <p>"Groat," sneered, the old woman contemptuously, "that worm. No - yes, of
  course he was Groat. Who else could he be; who else?" she asked, her voice
  rising wrathfully.</p>

  <p>There was a sound outside and she turned her head and listened.</p>

  <p>"You won't leave me alone. Miss Weldon, until the nurse comes back, will
  you?" she whispered with pathetic eagerness. "You promise me that?"</p>

  <p>"Why, of course I promise you," said Eunice, smiling; "that is why I am
  here, to keep you company."</p>

  <p>The door handle turned and the old woman watched it, fascinated. Eunice
  heard her audible gasp as Digby came in. He was in evening dress and smoking
  a cigarette through a long holder.</p>

  <p>He seemed for the moment taken aback by the sight of Eunice and then
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"Of course, it is the nurse's night out, isn't it? How are you feeling
  to-night, mother?"</p>

  <p>"Very well, my boy," she quavered, "very well indeed. Miss Weldon is
  keeping me company."</p>

  <p>"Splendid," said Digby. "I hope Miss Weldon hasn't been making your flesh
  creep."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," said the girl, shocked, "of course I haven't. How could I?"</p>

  <p>"I was wondering whether you had been telling mother of our mysterious
  visitor," he laughed as he pulled up an easy chair and sat down. "You don't
  mind my smoke, mother, do you?"</p>

  <p>Eunice thought that even if old Jane Groat had objected it would not have
  made the slightest difference to her son, but the old woman shook her head
  and again turned her pleading eyes on Eunice.</p>

  <p>"I should like to catch that lady," said Digby, watching a curl of smoke
  rise to the ceiling.</p>

  <p>"What lady, my boy?" asked Mrs. Groat.</p>

  <p>"The lady who has been wandering loose round this house at night, leaving
  her mark upon the panels of my door."</p>

  <p>"A burglar," said the old woman, and did not seem greatly alarmed.</p>

  <p>Digby shook his head.</p>

  <p>"A woman and a criminal, I understand. She left a clear finger-print, and
  Scotland Yard have had the photograph and have identified it with that of a
  woman who served a sentence in Holloway Gaol."</p>

  <p>A slight noise attracted Eunice and she turned to look at Jane Groat.</p>

  <p>She was sitting bolt upright, her black eyes staring, her face working
  convulsively.</p>

  <p>"What woman?" she asked harshly. "What are you talking about?'"</p>

  <p>Digby seemed as much surprised as the girl to discover the effect the
  statement had made upon his mother.</p>

  <p>"The woman who has been getting into this house and making herself a
  confounded nuisance with her melodramatic signature."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" asked Mrs. Groat with painful slowness.</p>

  <p>"She has left the mark of a Blue Hand on my door - "</p>

  <p>Before he could finish the sentence his mother was on her feet, staring
  down at him with terror in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"A Blue Hand!" she cried wildly. "What was that woman's name?"</p>

  <p>"According to the police report, Madge Benson," said Digby.</p>

  <p>For a second she glared at him wildly.</p>

  <p>"Blue Hand," she mumbled, and would have collapsed but for the fact that
  Eunice had recognized the symptoms and was by her side and took her in her
  strong young arms.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22"></a>CHAPTER 22</h2>

  <p class="first">OUTSIDE the door in the darkened passage a man was listening
  intently. He had trailed Digby Groat all that evening, and had followed him
  into the house. Hearing a movement of footsteps within, he slipped into a
  side passage and waited. Eunice flew past the entrance to the passage and Jim
  Steele thought it was time that he made a move. In a few minutes the house
  would be aroused, for he guessed that the old woman had collapsed. It was a
  desperate, mad enterprise of his, to enter the great household at so early an
  hour, but he had a particular reason for wishing to discover the contents of
  a letter which he had seen slipped into Digby's hand that night.</p>

  <p>Jim had been following him without success until Digby Groat had alighted
  at Piccadilly Circus apparently to buy a newspaper. Then a stranger had edged
  close to him and Jim had seen the quick passage of the white envelope. He
  meant to see that letter.</p>

  <p>He reached the ground floor in safety and hesitated. Should he go into the
  laboratory whither Digby was certain to come, or should he - ? A hurried
  footstep on the stairs above decided him: he slipped through the door leading
  to Digby's study. Hiding-place there was none: he had observed the room when
  he had been in there a few days previously. He was safe so long as nobody
  came in and turned on the lights. Jim heard the footsteps pass the door, and
  pulled his soft felt hat further over his eyes. The lower part of his face he
  had already concealed with a black silk handkerchief, and if the worst came
  to the worst, he could battle his way out and seek safety in flight. Nobody
  would recognize him in the old grey suit he wore, and the soft collarless
  shirt. It would not be a very noble end to the adventure, but it would be
  less ignominious than being exposed again to the scorn of Eunice.</p>

  <p>Suddenly his heart beat faster. Somebody was coming into the library. He
  saw the unknown open the door and he crouched down so that the big library
  table covered him from observation. Instantly the room was flooded with
  light; Jim could only see the legs of the intruder, and they were the legs of
  Digby Groat. Digby moved to the table, and Jim heard the tear of paper as an
  envelope was slit, and then an exclamation of anger from the man.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Groat, please come quickly!"</p>

  <p>It was the voice of Eunice calling from the floor above, and Digby hurried
  out, leaving the door open. He was scarcely out of sight before Jim had
  risen; his first glance was at the table. The letter lay as Digby had thrown
  it down, and he thrust it into his pocket. In a second he was through the
  doorway and in the passage. Jackson was standing by the foot of the stairs
  looking up, and for the moment he did not see Jim; then, at the sight of the
  masked face, he opened his mouth to shout a warning, and at that instant Jim
  struck at him twice, and the man went down with a crash.</p>

  <p>"What is that?" said Digby's voice, but Jim was out of the house, the door
  slammed behind him, and was racing along the sidewalk toward Berkeley Square,
  before Digby Groat knew what had happened. He slackened his pace, turned
  sharp to the right, so that he came back on his track, and stopped under a
  street light to read the letter.</p>

  <p>Parts of its contents contained no information for him. But there was one
  line which interested him:</p>

  <p>"Steele is trailing you: we will fix him to-night."</p>

  <p>He read the line again and smiled as he walked on at a more leisurely
  pace.</p>

  <p>Once or twice he thought he was being followed, and turned round, but saw
  nobody. As he strolled up Portland Place, deserted at this hour of the night
  save for an occasional car, his suspicion that he was being followed was
  strengthened. Two men, walking one behind the other, and keeping close to the
  railings, were about twenty yards behind him.</p>

  <p>"I'll give you a run for your money, my lads," muttered Jim, and crossing
  Marylebone Road, he reached the loneliest part of London, the outer circle of
  Regent's Park. And then he began to run: and Jim had taken both the sprint
  and the two-mile at the 'Varsity sports. He heard swift feet following and
  grinned to himself. Then came the noise of a taxi door shutting. They had
  picked up the "crawler" he had passed.</p>

  <p>"That is very unsporting," said Jim, and turning, ran in the opposite
  direction. He went past the cab like a flash, and heard it stop and a loud
  voice order the taxi to turn, and he slackened his pace. He had already
  decided upon his plan of action - one so beautifully simple and so
  embarrassing to Digby Groat and his servitors, if his suspicions were
  confirmed, that it was worth the bluff. He had dropped to a walk at the sight
  of a policeman coming toward him. As the taxi came abreast he stepped into
  the roadway, gripped the handle of the door and jerked it open.</p>

  <p>"Come out," he said sternly.</p>

  <p>In the reflected light from the taximeter lantern he saw the damaged face
  of an old friend.</p>

  <p>"Come out, Jackson, and explain just why you're following me through the
  peaceful streets of this great city."</p>

  <p>The man was loath to obey, but Jim gripped him by the waistcoat and
  dragged him out, to the taxi-driver's astonishment. The second man was
  obviously a foreigner, a little dark, thin-faced man with a mahogany face,
  and they stood sheepishly regarding their quarry.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow you can go back to Mr. Digby Groat and tell him that the next
  time he sets the members of the Thirteen Gang to trail me, I'll come after
  him with enough evidence in each hand to leave him swinging in the
  brick-lined pit at Wandsworth. Do you understand that?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you mean about to-morrow," said the innocent Jackson in
  an aggrieved tone. "We could have the law on you for dragging us out of the
  cab."</p>

  <p>"Try it, here comes a policeman," said Jim. He gripped him by the collar
  and dragged him toward the interested constable. "I think this man wants to
  make a charge against me."</p>

  <p>"No, I don't," growled Jackson, terrified as to what his master would say
  when he heard of this undramatic end to the trailing of Jim.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23"></a>CHAPTER 23</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE is little that is romantic about a Police Station, and
  Digby Groat, who came in a towering rage to release his servants, was so
  furious that he could not even see the humorous side of the situation.</p>

  <p>Once outside the building he dismissed one, Antonio Fuentes, with a curse,
  and poured the vials of wrath upon the unhappy Jackson.</p>

  <p>"You fool, you blundering dolt," he stormed. "I told you to keep the man
  in sight; Bronson would have carried out my orders without Steele knowing.
  Why the hell did you carry a revolver?"</p>

  <p>"How did I know he would play a dirty trick on me like that?" growled
  Jackson; "besides, I've never heard of the Firearms Act."</p>

  <p>It was a stupid but a dangerous situation, thought Digby Groat, as he sat
  gnawing his nails in the library. It was an old theory of his that great
  schemes come to nought and great crimes are detected through some
  contemptible little slip on the part of the conspirators. What Jim had done
  in the simplest, easiest manner, was to set the police moving against the
  Thirteen, and to bring two of its members into the searching light of a
  magisterial inquiry. What was worse, he had associated Digby Groat with the
  proceedings, though Digby had an excuse that Jackson was his valet, and, as
  such, entitled to his interest. He had disclaimed all knowledge of Fuentes,
  but, as an act of generosity, as the Spaniard was a friend of his servant,
  had gone bail for him also.</p>

  <p>Had the Thirteen brought off a big coup, their tracks would have been so
  hidden, their preparations so elaborated, that they would have defied
  detection. And here through a simple offence, which carried no more than a
  penalty of a five-pound fine, two of the members of the gang had come under
  police observation. Madmen!</p>

  <p>It was a sleepless night for him - even his three hours was denied him.
  The doctor attending his mother did not leave until past three o'clock.</p>

  <p>"It is not exactly a stroke, but I think a collapse due to some sudden
  shock."</p>

  <p>"Probably you're right," said Digby. "But I thought it best to call you
  in. Do you think she will recover?"</p>

  <p>"Oh. yes. I should imagine she'll be all right in the morning."</p>

  <p>Digby nodded. He agreed with that conclusion, without being particularly
  pleased to hear it.</p>

  <p>Difficulties were increasing daily, it seemed; new obstacles were
  besetting the smooth path of his life, and he traced them one by one and
  reduced them to a single cause - Jim Steele.</p>

  <p>The next morning, after he had telephoned to a shady solicitor whom he
  knew, ordering him to defend the two men who were to be charged at Marylebone
  with offences under the Firearms Act, he sent for Eunice Weldon.</p>

  <p>"Miss Weldon," he said, "I am making changes in this house, and I thought
  of taking my mother to the country next week. The air here doesn't seem to
  agree with her, and I despair of her getting better unless she has a radical
  change of environment."</p>

  <p>She nodded gravely.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I shall not be able to accompany you, Mr. Groat."</p>

  <p>He looked up at her sharply.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean, Miss Weldon?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"There is not sufficient work for me to do here, and I have decided to
  return to my old employment," she said.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to hear that, Miss Weldon," he said quietly, "but, of course,
  I will put no obstacle in your way. This has been a calamitous house
  recently, and your experience has not been an exceedingly happy one, and
  therefore I quite understand why you are anxious to leave us. I could have
  wished that you would have stayed with my mother until she was settled in my
  place in the country, but even on this point I will not press you."</p>

  <p>She expected that he would have been annoyed, and his courtesy impressed
  her.</p>

  <p>"I shall not, of course, think of leaving until I have done all that I
  possibly can," she hastened to add, as he expected her to do, "and really I
  have not been at all unhappy here, Mr. Groat."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Steele doesn't like me, does he?" he smiled, and he saw her
  stiffen.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Steele has no voice in my plans," she said, "and I have not seen him
  for several days."</p>

  <p>So there had been a quarrel, thought Digby, and decided that he must know
  a little more of this. He was too wily to ask her point-blank, but the fact
  that they had not met on the previous day was known to him.</p>

  <p>Eunice was glad to get the interview over and to go up to Mrs. Groat, who
  had sent for her a little earlier.</p>

  <p>The old woman was in bed propped up with pillows, and apparently was her
  normal self again.</p>

  <p>"You've been a long time," she grumbled.</p>

  <p>"I had to see your son, Mrs. Groat," said Eunice.</p>

  <p>The old woman muttered something under her breath.</p>

  <p>"Shut the door and lock it," she said. "Have you got your note-book?"</p>

  <p>Eunice pulled up a chair to the bedside, and wondered what was the
  important epistle that Mrs. Groat had decided to dictate. Usually she hated
  writing letters except with her own hand, and the reason for her summons had
  taken the girl by surprise.</p>

  <p>"I want you to write in my name to Mary Weatherwale. Write that down." Old
  Mrs. Groat spelt the name. "The address is in Somerset - Hill Farm,
  Retherley, Somerset. Now say to her that I am very ill, and that I hope she
  will forgive our old quarrel and will come up and stay with me - underline
  that I am very ill," said Jane Groat emphatically. "Tell her that I will pay
  her expenses and give her £5 a week. Is that too much?" she asked. "No, don't
  put the salary at all. I'll be bound she'll come; they're poorly on, the
  Weatherwales. Tell her she must come at once. Underline that, too."</p>

  <p>The girl scribbled down her instructions.</p>

  <p>"Now listen, Miss Weldon." Jane Groat lowered her voice. "You are to write
  this letter, and not to let my son know that you have done it: do you
  understand? Post it yourself; don't give it to that horrible Jackson. And
  again I tell you not to let my son know."</p>

  <p>Eunice wondered what was the reason for the mystery, but she carried out
  the old woman's instructions, and posted the letter without Digby's
  knowledge.</p>

  <p>There was no word from Jim, though she guessed he was the masked stranger
  who had knocked down Jackson in the hall. The strain of waiting was beginning
  to tell upon Eunice; she had grown oddly nervous, started at every sound, and
  it was this unusual exhibition of nerves which had finally decided her to
  leave Grosvenor Square and return to the less exciting life at the
  photographic studio.</p>

  <p>Why didn't Jim write, she asked herself fretfully, and immediately after
  relentless logic demanded of her why she did not write to Jim.</p>

  <p>She went for a walk in the park that afternoon hoping that she would see
  him, but although she sat for an hour under his favourite tree, he did not
  put in an appearance and she went home depressed and angry with herself.</p>

  <p>A stamp upon a postcard would have brought him, but that postcard she
  would not write.</p>

  <p>The next day brought Mrs. Mary Weatherwale, a stout, cheery woman of
  sixty, with a rosy apple face. She came in a four-wheeled cab, depositing her
  luggage in the hall, and greeted Eunice like an old friend.</p>

  <p>"How is she, my darling?" ("Darling" was a favourite word of hers, Eunice
  discovered with amusement.) "Poor old Jane, I haven't seen her for years and
  years. We used to be good friends once, you know, very good friends, but she
  - but there, let bygones be bygones, darling; show me to her room, will
  you?"</p>

  <p>It required all the cheerfulness of Mrs. Weatherwale to disguise her shock
  at the appearance of her one-time friend.</p>

  <p>"Why, Jane," she said, "what's the matter with you?"</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Mary," said the other pettishly. "All right, young lady, you
  needn't wait."</p>

  <p>This ungrateful dismissal was addressed to Eunice, who was very glad to
  make her escape. She was passing through the hall later in the afternoon,
  when Digby Groat came in. He looked at the luggage, which had not been
  removed from the hall, and turned with a frown to Eunice.</p>

  <p>"What is the meaning of this?" he asked. "To whom does this belong?"</p>

  <p>"A friend of Mrs. Groat is coming to stay," said Eunice.</p>

  <p>"A friend of mother's?" he answered quickly. "Do you know her name?"</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Weatherwale."</p>

  <p>She saw an instant change come over his face.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Weatherwale, eh," he said slowly. "Coming to stay here? At my
  mother's invitation, I suppose." He stripped his gloves and flung them on to
  the hall table and went up the stairs two at a time.</p>

  <p>What happened in the sick-room Eunice could only guess. The first
  intimation she had that all was not well, was the appearance of Mrs.
  Weatherwale strutting down the stairs, her face as red as a turkey-cock, her
  bead bonnet trembling with anger. She caught sight of Eunice and beckoned
  her.</p>

  <p>"Get somebody to find a cab for me, my darling," she said. "I'm going back
  to Somerset. I've been thrown out, my darling! What do you think of that? A
  woman of my age and my respectability; thrown out by a dirty little devil of
  a boy that I wouldn't harbour in my cow-yard." She was choleric and her voice
  was trembling with her righteous rage. "I'm talking about you," she said,
  raising her voice, and addressing somebody, apparently Digby, who was out of
  sight of Eunice. "You always were a cruel little beast, and if anything
  happens to your mother, I'm going to the police."</p>

  <p>"You had better get out before I send for a policeman," said Digby's
  growling voice.</p>

  <p>"I know you," she shook her fist at her invisible enemy. "I've known you
  for twenty-three years, my boy, and a more cruel and nastier man never
  lived!"</p>

  <p>Digby came slowly down the stairs, a smile on his face.</p>

  <p>"Really, Mrs. Weatherwale," he said, "you are unreasonable. I simply do
  not want my mother to be associated with the kind of people she chose as her
  friends when she was a girl. I can't be responsible for her vulgar tastes
  then; I certainly am responsible now."</p>

  <p>The rosy face of the woman flushed an even deeper red.</p>

  <p>"Common! Vulgar!" she spluttered. "You say that? You dirty little
  foreigner. Ah! That got home. I know your secret, Mr. Digby Groat!"</p>

  <p>If eyes could kill, she would have died at that moment. He turned at the
  foot of the stairs and walked into his study, and slammed the door behind
  him.</p>

  <p>"Whenever you want to know anything about that!" - Mrs. Weatherwale
  pointed at the closed door - "send for me. I've got letters from his mother
  about him when he was a child of so high that would make your hair stand on
  ends, darling."</p>

  <p>When at last a cab bore the indignant lady from Grosvenor Square, Eunice
  breathed a sigh of relief. One more family skeleton, she thought, but she had
  already inspected the grisly bones. She would not be sorry to follow in Mrs.
  Weatherwale's footsteps, though, unknown to her, Digby Groat had other
  plans.</p>

  <p>Those plans were maturing, when he heard a sharp rat-tat at the door and
  came out into the hall. "Was that a telegram for me?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No, for me," said Eunice, and there was no need to ask whom that message
  was from; her shining eyes, her flushed face, told their own story.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch24"
     name="ch24"></a>CHAPTER 24</h2>

  <p class="first">"JIM!"</p>

  <p>Eunice came running across the grass with out-stretched hands, oblivious
  to the fact that it was broad daylight and that she was being watched by at
  least a hundred idle loungers in the park.</p>

  <p>Jim took both her hands in his and she experienced a moment of serene
  comfort. Then they both talked at once; they were both apologetic,
  interrupting one another's explanations with the expression of their own
  contrition.</p>

  <p>"Jim, I'm going to leave Mrs. Groat's house," she said when they had
  reached sanity.</p>

  <p>"Thank God for that," said Jim.</p>

  <p>"You are so solemn about it," she laughed. "Did you really think I was in
  any danger there?"</p>

  <p>"I know you were," he said.</p>

  <p>She had so much to tell him that she did not know where to begin.</p>

  <p>"Were you sorry not to see me?"</p>

  <p>"The days I have not seen you are dead, and wiped off the calendar," said
  Jim.</p>

  <p>"Oh, before I forget," said Eunice, "Mrs. Weatherwale has gone."</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Weatherwale!" he repeated, puzzled.</p>

  <p>"I haven't told you? No, of course not. I did not see you yesterday. But
  Mrs. Groat asked me to write to Mrs. Weatherwale, who is an old friend of
  hers, asking her to come and stay. I think Mrs. Groat is rather afraid of
  Digby."</p>

  <p>"And she came?" asked Jim.</p>

  <p>The girl nodded.</p>

  <p>"She came and stayed about one hour, then arrived my lord Digby, who
  bundled her unceremoniously into the street. There is no love lost there,
  either, Jim. The dear old lady hated him. She was a charming old soul and
  called me 'darling.'"</p>

  <p>"Who wouldn't?" said Jim. "I can call you darling even though I am not a
  charming old soul. Go on. So she went away? I wonder what she knows about
  Digby?"</p>

  <p>"She knows everything. She knows about Estremeda, of that I am sure. Jim,
  doesn't that make a difference?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"If you mean does it make any difference about Digby inheriting his
  mother's money when she gets it, I can tell you that it makes none. The will
  does not specify that he is the son of John Groat, and the fact that he was
  born before she married this unfortunate shipping clerk does not affect the
  issue."</p>

  <p>"When is the money to be made over to the Groats?"</p>

  <p>"Next Thursday," said Jim, with a groan, "and I am just as far from
  stopping the transfer of the property as I have ever been."</p>

  <p>He had not told her of his meeting with Lady Mary Danton. That was not his
  secret alone. Nor could he tell her that Lady Mary was the woman who had
  warned her.</p>

  <p>They strolled across the Park towards the Serpentine and Jim was unusually
  preoccupied.</p>

  <p>"Do you know, Eunice, that I have an uncanny feeling that you really are
  in some way associated with the Danton fortune?"</p>

  <p>She laughed and clung tighter to his arm.</p>

  <p>"Jim, you would make me Queen of England if you could," she said, "and you
  have just as much chance of raising me to the throne as you have of proving
  that I am somebody else's child. I don't want to be anybody else's, really,"
  she said. "I was very, very fond of my mother, and it nearly broke my heart
  when she died. And daddy was a darling."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Of course, it is a fantastic idea," he said, "and I am flying in face of
  all the facts. I have taken the trouble to discover where you were born. I
  have a friend in Cape Town who made the inquiries for me."</p>

  <p>"Eunice May Weldon," she laughed. "So you can abandon that idea, can't
  you?" she said.</p>

  <p>Strolling along by the side of the Serpentine, they had reached the bridge
  near the magazine and were standing waiting until a car had passed before
  they crossed the road. Somebody in the car raised his hat.</p>

  <p>"Who was that?" said Jim.</p>

  <p>"Digby Groat," she smiled, "my nearly late employer! Don't let us go to
  the tea-shop, Jim," she said; "let us go to your flat - I'd love to."</p>

  <p>He looked at her dubiously.</p>

  <p>"It is not customary for bachelors to give tea-parties to young females,"
  he said.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure it is" - she waved aside his objection. "I'm perfectly certain
  it happens every day, only they don't speak about it."</p>

  <p>The flat delighted her and she took off her coat and busied herself in the
  little kitchenette.</p>

  <p>"You told me it was an attic with bare boards," she said reproachfully as
  she was laying the cloth.</p>

  <p>To Jim, stretched in his big chair, she was a thing of sheer delight. He
  wanted no more than to sit for ever and watch her flitting from room to room.
  The sound of her fresh voice was a delicious narcotic, and even when she
  called him, as she did, again and again, to explain some curio of his which
  hung in the hall, the spell was not broken.</p>

  <p>"Everything is speckless," she said as she brought in the tea, "and I'm
  sure you haven't polished up those brasses and cleaned that china."</p>

  <p>"You're right first time," said Jim lazily. "An unprepossessing lady comes
  in every morning at half-past seven and works her fingers to the bone, as she
  has told me more times than once, though she manages to keep more flesh on
  those bones than seems comfortable for her."</p>

  <p>"And there is your famous train," she said, jumping up and going to the
  window as an express whizzed down the declivity. "Oh, Jim, look at those
  boys," she gasped in horror.</p>

  <p>Across the line and supported by two stout poles, one of which stood in
  the courtyard of the flat, was a stretch of thin telegraph wires, and on
  these a small and adventurous urchin was pulling himself across
  hand-over-hand, to the joy of his companions seated on the opposite wall of
  the cutting.</p>

  <p>"The young devil," said Jim admiringly.</p>

  <p>Another train shrieked past, and running down into Euston trains moved at
  a good speed. The telegraph wire had sagged under the weight of the boy to
  such an extent that he had to lift up his legs to avoid touching the tops of
  the carriages.</p>

  <p>"If the police catch him," mused Jim, "they will fine him a sovereign and
  give him a birching. In reality he ought to be given a medal. These little
  beggars are the soldiers of the future, Eunice, and some day he will
  reproduce that fearlessness of danger, and he will earn the Victoria Cross a
  jolly sight more than I earned it."</p>

  <p>She laughed and dropped her head against his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"You queer man," she said, and then returned to the contemplation of the
  young climber, who had now reached the opposite wall amidst the approving
  yells and shouts of his diminutive comrades.</p>

  <p>"Now let us drink our tea, because I must get back," said the girl.</p>

  <p>The cup was to her lips when the door opened and a woman came in. Eunice
  did not hear the turning of the handle, and her first intimation of the
  stranger's presence was the word "Jim." She looked up. The woman in the
  doorway was, by all standards, beautiful, she noticed with a pang. Age had
  not lined or marred the beauty of her face and the strands of grey in her
  hair added to her attraction. For a moment they looked at one another, the
  woman and the girl, and then the intruder, with a nod and a smile, said:</p>

  <p>"I will see you again. I am sorry," and went out closing the door behind
  her.</p>

  <p>The silence that followed was painful. Jim started three times to speak,
  but stopped as he realized the futility of explaining to the girl the reason
  of the woman's presence. He could not tell her she was Lady Mary Danton.</p>

  <p>"She called you 'Jim,'" said the girl slowly. "Is she a friend of
  yours?"</p>

  <p>"Er - yes," he replied awkwardly. "She is Mrs. Fane, a neighbour."</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Fane," repeated the girl, "but you told me she was paralysed and
  could not get up. You said she had never been out of doors for years."</p>

  <p>Jim swallowed something.</p>

  <p>"She called you 'Jim,'" said the girl again. "Are you very great
  friends?"</p>

  <p>"Well, we are rather," said Jim huskily. "The fact is, Eunice - "</p>

  <p>"How did she come in?" asked the girl with a frown. "She must have let
  herself in with a key. Has she a key of your flat?"</p>

  <p>Jim gulped.</p>

  <p>"Well, as a matter of fact - " he began.</p>

  <p>"Has she, Jim?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, she has. I can't explain, Eunice, but you've got - "</p>

  <p>"I see," she said quietly. "She is very pretty, isn't she?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, she is rather pretty," admitted Jim miserably. "You see, we have
  business transactions together, and frequently I am out and she wants to get
  to my telephone. She has no telephone in her own flat, you see, Eunice," he
  went on lamely.</p>

  <p>"I see," said the girl, "and she calls you 'Jim'?"</p>

  <p>"Because we are good friends," he floundered. "Really, Eunice, I hope you
  are not putting any misconstruction upon that incident."</p>

  <p>She heaved a little sigh.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it is all right, Jim," she said, and pushed away her plate. "I
  don't think I will wait any longer. Please don't come back with me, I'd
  rather you didn't. I can get a cab; there's a rank opposite the flat, I
  remember."</p>

  <p>Jim cursed the accident which had brought the lady into his room at that
  moment and cursed himself that he had not made a clean breast of the whole
  thing, even at the risk of betraying Lady Mary.</p>

  <p>He had done sufficient harm by his incoherent explanation and he offered
  no other as he helped the girl into her coat.</p>

  <p>"You are sure you'd rather go alone?" he said miserably.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>They were standing on the landing. Lady Mary's front door was ajar and
  from within came the shrill ring of a telephone bell. She raised her grave
  eyes to Jim.</p>

  <p>"Your friend has the key of your flat because she has no telephone of her
  own, didn't you say, Jim?"</p>

  <p>He made no reply.</p>

  <p>"I never thought you would lie to me," she said, and he watched her
  disappear down the staircase with an aching heart.</p>

  <p>He had hardly reached his room and flung himself in his chair by the side
  of the tea-table, when Lady Mary followed him into the room.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," she said, "I hadn't the slightest idea she would be
  here."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter," said Jim with a wan smile, "only it makes things
  rather awkward for me. I told her a lie and she found me out, or rather, your
  infernal telephone did, Lady Mary."</p>

  <p>"Then you were stupid," was all the comfort she gave him.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you stay?" he asked. "That made it look so queer."</p>

  <p>"There were many reasons why I couldn't stay," said Lady Mary. "Jim, do
  you remember the inquiries I made about this very girl, Eunice Weldon, and
  which you made too?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>He wasn't interested in Eunice Weldon's obvious parentage at that
  moment.</p>

  <p>"You remember she was born at Rondebosch?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said listlessly. "Even she admits it," he added with a feeble
  attempt at a jest.</p>

  <p>"Does she admit this?" asked Lady Mary. She pushed a telegram across the
  table to Jim, and he picked it up and read:</p>

  <p>"Eunice May Weldon died in Cape Town at the age of twelve months and three
  days, and is buried at Rosebank Cemetery. Plot No. 7963."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch25"
     name="ch25"></a>CHAPTER 25</h2>

  <p class="first">JIM read the cablegram again, scarcely believing his eyes or
  his understanding,</p>

  <p>"Buried at the age of twelve months," he said incredulously, "but how
  absurd. She is here, alive, besides which, I recently met a man who knew the
  Weldons and remembered Eunice as a child. There is no question of
  substitution."</p>

  <p>"It is puzzling, isn't it?" said Lady Mary softly, as she put the telegram
  in her bag. "But here is a very important fact. The man who sent me this
  cablegram is one of the most reliable private detectives in South
  Africa."</p>

  <p>Eunice Weldon was born, Eunice Weldon had died, and yet Eunice Weldon was
  very much alive at that moment, though she was wishing she were dead.</p>

  <p>Jim leant his elbow on the table and rested his chin on his palm.</p>

  <p>"I must confess that I am now completely rattled," he said. "Then if the
  girl died, it is obvious the parents adopted another girl and that girl was
  Eunice. The question is, where did she come from, because there was never any
  question of her adoption, so far as she knew."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I have already cabled to my agent to ask him to inquire on this question
  of adoption," she said, "and in the meantime the old idea is gaining ground,
  Jim."</p>

  <p>His eyes met hers.</p>

  <p>"You mean that Eunice is your daughter?"</p>

  <p>She nodded slowly.</p>

  <p>"That circular scar on her wrist? You know nothing about it?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"It may have been done after " - she faltered - "after - I lost sight of
  her."</p>

  <p>"Lady Mary, will you explain how you came to lose sight of her?" asked
  Jim.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Not yet," she said.</p>

  <p>"Then perhaps you will answer another question. You know Mrs. Groat?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Do you know a woman named Weatherwale?"</p>

  <p>Lady Mary's eyes opened.</p>

  <p>"Mary Weatherwale, yes. She was a farmer's daughter who was very fond of
  Jane, a nice, decent woman. I often wondered how Jane came to make such a
  friend. Why do you ask?"</p>

  <p>Jim told her what had happened when Mrs. Weatherwale had arrived at
  Grosvenor Square.</p>

  <p>"Let us put as many of our cards on the table as are not too stale to
  exhibit," she said. "Do you believe that Jane Groat had some part in the
  disappearance of my daughter?"</p>

  <p>"Honestly I do," said Jim. "Don't you?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I used to think so," she said quietly, "but when I made inquiries, she
  was exonerated beyond question. She is a wicked woman, as wicked as any that
  has ever been born," she said with a sudden fire that sent the colour flying
  to her face, "but she was not so wicked that she was responsible for little
  Dorothy's fate."</p>

  <p>"You will not tell me any more about her?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"There is something you could say which might make my investigations a
  little easier," said Jim.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing I can say - yet," she said in a low voice, as she rose
  and, without a word of farewell, glided from the room.</p>

  <p>Jim's mind was made up. In the light of that extraordinary cablegram from
  South Africa, his misunderstanding with Eunice faded into insignificance. If
  she were Lady Mary's daughter! He gasped at the thought which, with all its
  consequences, came as a new possibility, even though he had pondered it in
  his mind.</p>

  <p>He fixed upon Jane Groat as one who could supply the key of the mystery,
  but every attempt he had made to get the particulars of her past had been
  frustrated by ignorance, or the unwillingness of all who had known her in her
  early days.</p>

  <p>There was little chance of seeing Septimus Salter in his office, so he
  went round to the garage where he housed his little car, and set forth on a
  voyage of discovery to Chislehurst, where Mr. Salter lived.</p>

  <p>The old gentleman was alone; his wife and his eldest son, an officer, who
  was staying with him, had gone to Harrogate, and he was more genial in his
  reception than Jim had a right to expect.</p>

  <p>"You'll stay to dinner, of course," he said.</p>

  <p>Jim shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No thank you, sir, I'm feeling rather anxious just now. I came to ask you
  if you knew Mrs. Weatherwale."</p>

  <p>The lawyer frowned.</p>

  <p>"Weatherwale, Weatherwale," he mused, "yes, I remember the name. I seldom
  forget a name. She appears in Mrs. Groat's will, I think, as a legatee for a
  few hundred pounds. Her father was one of old Danton's tenants."</p>

  <p>"That is the woman," said Jim, and told his employer all that he had
  learnt about Mrs. Weatherwale's ill-fated visit to London.</p>

  <p>"It only shows," said the lawyer when he had finished, "how the terrific
  secrets which we lawyers think are locked away in steel boxes and stowed
  below the ground in musty cellars, are the property of Tom, Dick and Harry!
  We might as well save ourselves all the trouble. Estremeda is, of course, the
  Spanish Marquis who practically lived with the Dantons when Jane was a young
  woman. He is, as obviously, the father of Digby Groat, and the result of this
  woman's mad passion for the Spaniard. I knew there was some sort of scandal
  attached to her name, but this explains why her father would never speak to
  her, and why he cut her out of his will. I'm quite sure that Jonathan Danton
  knew nothing whatever about his sister's escapade, or he would not have left
  her his money. He was as straitlaced as any of the Dantons, but, thanks to
  his father's reticence, it would seem that Mrs. Groat is going to
  benefit."</p>

  <p>"And the son?" said Jim, and the lawyer nodded.</p>

  <p>"She may leave her money where she wishes - to anybody's son, for the
  matter of that," said the lawyer. "A curious case, a very curious case" - he
  shook his grey head. "What do you intend doing?"</p>

  <p>"I am going down to Somerset to see Mrs. Weatherwale," said Jim. "She may
  give us a string which will lead somewhere."</p>

  <p>"If she'll give you a string that will lead Mr. Digby Groat to prison,"
  growled the old lawyer, "get hold of it, Steele. and pull like the
  devil!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch26"
     name="ch26"></a>CHAPTER 26</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN his alarm clock turned him out at six in the morning,
  Jim was both sleepy and inclined to be pessimistic. But as his mind cleared
  and he realized what results the day's investigations might bring, he faced
  his journey with a lighter heart.</p>

  <p>Catching the seven o'clock from Paddington, he reached the nearest station
  to Mrs. Weatherwale's residence soon after nine. He had not taken any
  breakfast, and he delayed his journey for half an hour, whilst the hostess of
  a small inn facing the station prepared him the meal without which no
  Englishman could live, as she humorously described it, a dish of eggs and
  bacon.</p>

  <p>It seemed as though he were in another world to that which he had left
  behind at Paddington. The trees were a little greener, the lush grasses of
  the meadows were a more vivid emerald, and overhead in the blue sky, defying
  sight, a skylark trilled passionately and was answered somewhere from the
  ground. Tiny furry shapes in their bright spring coats darted across the
  white roadway almost under his feet. He crossed a crumbling stone bridge and
  paused to look down into the shallow racing stream that foamed and bubbled
  and swirled on its way to the distant sea.</p>

  <p>The old masons who had dressed these powdery ashlars and laid the
  moss-green stones of the buttresses, were dead when burly Henry lorded it at
  Westminster. These stones had seen the epochs pass, and the maidens who had
  leant against the parapet listening with downcast eyes to their young swains
  had become old women and dust and forgotten.</p>

  <p>Jim heaved a sigh as he resumed his trudge. Life would not be long enough
  for him, if Eunice...if -</p>

  <p>He shook the thought from him and climbed steadily to his destination.</p>

  <p>Hill Farm was a small house standing in about three acres of land, devoted
  mainly to market garden. There was no Mr. Weatherwale. He had been dead for
  twelve years, Jim learnt at the inn, but the old lady had a son who assisted
  in the management of the farm.</p>

  <p>Jim strode out to what was to prove a pleasant walk through the glories of
  a Somerset countryside, and he found Mrs. Weatherwale in the act of
  butter-making. She had a pasture and a dozen cows, as she informed him
  later.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to talk about Jane Groat," she said decisively, when he
  broached the object of his visit. "I'll never forgive that boy of hers for
  the trouble he gave me, apart from the insult. I gave up my work and had to
  hire a woman to take charge here and look after the boy - there's my fare to
  London - "</p>

  <p>"I dare say all that could be arranged, Mrs. Weatherwale," said Jim with a
  laugh. "Mr. Digby Groat will certainly repay you."</p>

  <p>"Are you a friend of his?" she asked suspiciously, "because if you are -
  "</p>

  <p>"I am not a friend of his," said Jim. "On the contrary, I dislike him
  probably as much as you do."</p>

  <p>"That is not possible," she said, "for I would as soon see the devil as
  that yellow-faced monkey."</p>

  <p>She wiped her hands on her apron and led the way to the sunny little
  parlour.</p>

  <p>"Sit ye down, Mr. What-you-may-call-it," she said briskly.</p>

  <p>"Steele," murmured Jim.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Steele, is it? Just sit down there, will you?" She indicated a
  window-seat covered with bright chintz. "Now tell me just what you want to
  know."</p>

  <p>"I want to know something about Jane Groat's youth, who were her friends,
  and what you know about Digby Groat?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Weatherwale shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you much about that, sir," she said. "Her father was old
  Danton who owned Kennett Hall. You can see it from here " - she pointed
  across the country to a grey mass of buildings that showed above the
  hill-crest.</p>

  <p>"Jane frequently came over to the farm. My father had a bigger one in
  those days. All Hollyhock Hill belonged to him, but he lost his money through
  horses, drat them!" she said good-humouredly, and apparently had no
  particular grievance against the thoroughbred race-horse.</p>

  <p>"And we got quite friendly. It was unusual, I admit, she being a lady of
  quality and me being a farmer's daughter; but lord! I've got stacks of
  letters from her, or rather, I had. I burnt them this morning."</p>

  <p>"You've burnt them?" said Jim in dismay. "I was hoping that I should find
  something I wanted to know from those."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing there you would find, except a lot of silly nonsense
  about a man she fell in love with, a Spanish man."</p>

  <p>"The Marquis of Estremeda?" suggested Jim.</p>

  <p>She closed her lips.</p>

  <p>"Maybe it was and maybe it wasn't," she said. "I'm not going to scandalize
  at my time of life, and at her time of life too. We've all made mistakes in
  our time, and I dare say you'll make yours, if you haven't made them already.
  Which reminds me, Mr. - I don't remember your name?"</p>

  <p>"Steele," said Jim patiently.</p>

  <p>"Well, that reminds me there's a duck of a girl in that house. How Jane
  can allow a beautiful creature like that to come into contact with a beast
  like Digby, I don't know. But that is all by the way. No, I burnt the
  letters, except a few. I kept one or two to prove that a boy doesn't change
  his character when he grows up. Why, it may be," she said that
  good-humouredly, "when Digby is hanged the newspaper reporters would like to
  see these, and they will be worth money to me!"</p>

  <p>Jim laughed. Her good-humour was infectious, and when after an absence of
  five minutes she returned to the room with a small box covered with faded
  green plush, he asked; "You know nothing of Digby Groat's recent life?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I only knew him as a boy, and a wicked little devil he was, the sort of
  boy who would pull a fly's wings off for the sport of it. I used to think
  those stories about boys were lies, but it was true about him. Do you know
  what his chief delight was as a boy?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't," smiled Jim. "It was something unpleasant, I am sure."</p>

  <p>"To come on a Friday afternoon to Fanner Johnson's and see the pigs killed
  for market," she said grimly. "That's the sort of boy he was."</p>

  <p>She took out a bundle of faded letters and fixing her large steel-rimmed
  spectacles, read them over.</p>

  <p>"Here's one," she said; "that will show you the kind of kid he was."</p>

  <p>"I flogged Digby to-day. He tied a bunch of crackers round the kitten's
  neck and let them off. The poor little creature had to be killed."</p>

  <p>"That's Digby," said Mrs. Weatherwale, looking over her glasses. "There
  isn't a letter here which doesn't say that she had to beat him for something
  or other," she read on, reading half to herself, and Jim heard the word
  "baby."</p>

  <p>"What baby was that?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him.</p>

  <p>"It wasn't her baby," she said.</p>

  <p>"But whose was it?" insisted Jim.</p>

  <p>"It was a baby she was looking after."</p>

  <p>"Her sister-in-law's?" demanded Jim.</p>

  <p>The woman nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Lady Mary Danton's, poor little soul - he did a cruel thing to her
  too."</p>

  <p>Jim dare not speak, and without encouragement Mrs. Weatherwale said:
  "Listen to this, if you want to understand the kind of little devil Digby
  was."</p>

  <p>"I had to give Digby a severe flogging to-day. Really, the child is
  naturally cruel. What do you imagine he did? He took a sixpence, heated it in
  the fire and put it on the poor baby's wrist. It left a circular burn."</p>

  <p>"Great God!" said Jim, springing to his feet, his face white. "A circular
  burn on the wrist?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Yes, why?"</p>

  <p>So that was the explanation, and the heiress to the Danton millions was
  not Digby Groat or his mother, but the girl who was called Eunice Weldon, or,
  as the world would know her, Dorothy Danton!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch27"
     name="ch27"></a>CHAPTER 27</h2>

  <p class="first">EUNICE was Lady Mary's daughter! There was no doubt of it,
  no possible doubt. His instinct had proved to be right. How had she got to
  South Africa? He had yet to find a solution to the mystery.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Weatherwale's rosy face was a picture of astonishment. For a moment
  she thought her visitor had gone mad.</p>

  <p>"Will you read that piece again about Digby Groat burning the baby's
  wrist," said Jim slowly, and after a troubled glance at him, she
  complied.</p>

  <p>"The little baby was lost soon after," she explained. "It went out with a
  nurse; one of Jane's girls took it out in a boat, and the boat must have been
  run down by some ship."</p>

  <p>And then a light dawned upon Jim.</p>

  <p>What ships passed to the east of the Goodwins (for it was near there that
  the disaster must have occurred) on the day of the tragedy? He must find it
  out immediately and he must take the letter from Jane to her friend in order
  to place it before Septimus Salter. Here, however, the woman demurred, and
  Jim, sitting down again, told her plainly and frankly all his fears and
  suspicions.</p>

  <p>"What, that beautiful girl I saw in Jane's house?" said Mrs. Weatherwale
  in amazement. "You don't tell me!"</p>

  <p>"I do," said Jim. "She has the mark on her wrist, a burn, and now I
  remember! Mrs. Groat knows she is the daughter of Lady Mary, too! It was the
  sight of that scar which brought about her stroke."</p>

  <p>"I don't want any harm to happen to Jane, she hasn't been a bad friend of
  mine, but it seems to me only justice to the young lady that she should have
  the letter. As a matter of fact, I nearly burnt it."</p>

  <p>"Thank God you didn't," said Jim fervently.</p>

  <p>He carried his prize back by the first train that left for London and
  dashed into Salter's office with his news.</p>

  <p>"If your theory is correct." said the old man when he had finished. "there
  ought not to be any difficulty in discovering the link between the child's
  disappearance and her remarkable appearance in Cape Town as Eunice Weldon. We
  have had confirmation from South Africa that Eunice Weldon did die at this
  tender age, so, therefore, your Eunice cannot be the same girl. I should
  advise you to get busy because the day after to-morrow I hand over the Danton
  estate to Mrs. Groat's new lawyers, and from what I can see of things," said
  Mr. Salter grimly, "it is Digby Groat's intention to sell immediately the
  whole of the Danton property."</p>

  <p>"Does that amount to much?"</p>

  <p>"It represents more than three-quarters of the estate," said the lawyer to
  Jim's surprise. "The Lakeside properties are worth four hundred thousand
  pounds, they include about twenty-four homesteads and six fairly big farms.
  You remember he came here some time ago to question us as to whether he had
  the right of sale. I had a talk with Bennetts - they are his new solicitors -
  only this morning," Mr. Salter went on stroking his big chin thoughtfully,
  "and it is pretty clear that Digby intends selling out. He showed Bennett the
  Power of Attorney which his mother gave him this morning."</p>

  <p>The lawyer was faithfully interpreting Digby Groat's intentions. The will
  which Eunice had found had shocked him. He was determined that he should not
  be at the mercy of a capricious old woman who he knew disliked him as
  intensely as he hated her, and he had induced his mother to change her
  lawyers, not so much because he had any prejudice against Salter, but because
  he needed a new solicitor who would carry through the instructions which
  Salter would question.</p>

  <p>Digby was determined to turn the lands and revenues of the Danton Estate
  into solid cash - cash which he could handle, and once it was in his bank he
  would breathe more freely.</p>

  <p>That was the secret of his business in the city, the formation of a
  syndicate to take over the Danton properties on a cash basis, and he had so
  well succeeded in interesting several wealthy financiers in the scheme, that
  it wanted but the stroke of a pen to complete the deal.</p>

  <p>"Aren't there sufficient facts now," asked Jim, "to prove that Eunice is
  Lady Mary's daughter?"</p>

  <p>Salter shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No," he said, "you must get a closer connection of evidence. But as I
  say, it should not be very difficult for you to do that. You know the date
  the child disappeared. It was on the 21st June, 1901. To refresh your memory
  I would remark that it was in that year the Boer War was being fought
  out."</p>

  <p>Jim's first call was at the Union African Steamship Company, and he made
  that just when the office was closing.</p>

  <p>Fortunately the assistant manager was there, took him into the office and
  made a search of his records.</p>

  <p>"None of our ships left London River on the 20th or 21st June," he said,
  "and, anyway, only our intermediate boats sail from there. The mail steamers
  sail from Southampton. The last ship to pass Southampton was the Central
  Castle. She was carrying troops to South Africa and she called at Plymouth on
  the 20th, so she must have passed Margate three days before."</p>

  <p>"What other lines of steamers run to South Africa?"</p>

  <p>The manager gave him a list, and it was a longer one than Jim had
  expected.</p>

  <p>He hurried home to break the news to Lady Mary, but she was out. Her maid,
  the mysterious Madge Benson, said she had left and did not expect to be back
  for two or three days, and Jim remembered that Lady Mary had talked of going
  to Paris.</p>

  <p>"Do you know where she would stay in Paris?"</p>

  <p>"I don't even know she's gone to Paris, sir," said the woman with a smile.
  "Lady Mary never tells me her plans."</p>

  <p>Jim groaned.</p>

  <p>There was nothing to do but wait until to-morrow and pursue his inquiries.
  In the meantime it was growing upon him that Eunice and he were bad friends.
  He smiled to himself. What would she say when she discovered that the woman
  who called him "Jim" was her mother! He must possess his soul in patience for
  another twenty-four hours.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a thought came to him, a thought which struck the smile from his
  lips. Eunice Weldon might forgive him and might marry him and change the drab
  roadway of life to a path of flowers, but Dorothy Danton was a rich woman,
  wealthy beyond her dreams, and Jim Steele was a poor man. He sat back in his
  chair to consider that disquieting revelation. He could never marry the girl
  Eunice now, he thought; it would not be fair to her, or to him. Suppose she
  never knew! He smiled contemptuously at the thought.</p>

  <p>"Get thee behind me, Satan." he said to the little dog that crouched at
  his feet, watching him with eyes that never left his face. He bent down and
  patted the mongrel, who turned on his back with uplifted paws. "You and I
  have no particular reason to love Digby Groat, old fellow," he said, for this
  was the dog he had rescued from Digby's dissecting table, "and if he harms a
  hair of her head, he will be sorry he was ever born."</p>

  <p>He began his search in the morning, almost as soon as the shipping offices
  opened. One by one they blasted his hopes, and he scarcely dared make his
  last call which was at the office of the African Coastwise Line.</p>

  <p>"And I don't think it is much use going to them," said the clerk at the
  last but one of his calls. "They don't sail from London, they are a Liverpool
  firm, and all their packets sail direct from the Mersey. I don't think we
  have ever had a Coastwise boat in the London docks. I happen to know," he
  explained, "because I was in the Customs before I came to this firm."</p>

  <p>The Coastwise Line was an old-fashioned firm and occupied an old-fashioned
  office in a part of London which seemed to be untouched by the passing
  improvements of the age. It was one of those firms which have never succumbed
  to the blandishments of the Company Promoter, and the two senior partners of
  the firm, old gentlemen who had the appearance of being dignitaries of the
  Church, were seated on either side of a big partner's table.</p>

  <p>Jim was received with old-world courtesy and a chair was placed for him by
  a porter almost as ancient as the proprietors of the African Coastwise
  Line.</p>

  <p>Both the gentlemen listened to his requirements in silence.</p>

  <p>"I don't think we have ever had a ship pass through the Straits of Dover,"
  said one, shaking his head. "We were originally a Liverpool firm, and though
  the offices have always been in London, Liverpool is our headquarters."</p>

  <p>"And Avonmouth," murmured his partner.</p>

  <p>"And Avonmouth, of course," the elder of the two acknowledged the
  correction with a slight inclination of his head.</p>

  <p>"Then there is no reason why I should trouble you, gentlemen," said Jim
  with a heavy heart.</p>

  <p>"It is no trouble, I assure you," said the partner, "but to make
  absolutely sure we will get our sailings for - June, 1901, I think you
  said?"</p>

  <p>He rang a bell, and to the middle-aged clerk, who looked so young, thought
  Jim, that he must be the office-boy, he made his request known. Presently the
  clerk came back with a big ledger which he laid on the partners' desk. He
  watched the gentleman as his well-manicured finger ran carefully down the
  pages and suddenly stopped.</p>

  <p>"Why, of course," he said, looking up, "do you remember we took over a
  Union African trip when they were hard pressed with transport work?"</p>

  <p>"To be sure," said his partner. "It was the Battledore we sent out, she
  went from Tilbury. The only ship of ours that has ever sailed from Thames
  River."</p>

  <p>"What date did it sail?" asked Jim eagerly.</p>

  <p>"It sailed with the tide, which was apparently about eight o'clock in the
  morning of the 21st June. Let me see," said the partner, rising and going to
  a big chart that hung on the wall, "that would bring her up to the North
  Foreland Light at about twelve o'clock. What time did the accident
  occur?"</p>

  <p>"At noon," said Jim huskily, and the partners looked at one another.</p>

  <p>"I don't remember anything peculiar being reported on that voyage," said
  the senior slowly.</p>

  <p>"You were in Switzerland at the time," said the other, "and so was I. Mr.
  Mansar was in charge."</p>

  <p>"Is Mr. Mansar here?" asked Jim eagerly.</p>

  <p>"He is dead," said the partner gently. "Yes, poor Mr. Mansar is dead. He
  died at a comparatively early age of sixty-three, a very amiable man, who
  played the piano remarkably well."</p>

  <p>"The violin," murmured his partner.</p>

  <p>Jim was not interested in the musical accomplishments of the deceased Mr.
  Mansar.</p>

  <p>"Is there no way of finding out what happened on that voyage?"</p>

  <p>It was the second of the partners who spoke.</p>

  <p>"We can produce the log book of the Battledore."</p>

  <p>"I hope we can," corrected the other. "The Battledore was sunk during the
  Great War, torpedoed off the Needles, but Captain Pinnings, who was in
  command of her at the time, is alive and hearty."</p>

  <p>"And his log book?" asked Jim.</p>

  <p>"That we must investigate. We keep all log books at the Liverpool office,
  and I will write to-night to ask our managing clerk to send the book down, if
  it is in his possession."</p>

  <p>"This is very urgent," said Jim earnestly. "You have been so kind that I
  would not press you if it were not a matter of the greatest importance. Would
  it be possible for me to go to Liverpool and see the log?"</p>

  <p>"I think I can save you that trouble," said the elder of the two, whose
  names Jim never knew. "Mr. Harry is coming down to London to-morrow, isn't
  he?"</p>

  <p>His friend nodded.</p>

  <p>"Well, he can bring the book, if it exists. I will tell the clerk to
  telephone to Liverpool to that effect," and with this Jim had to content
  himself, though it meant another twenty-four hours' delay.</p>

  <p>He reported progress to the lawyer, when he determined upon making a bold
  move. His first business was the protection of Eunice, and although he did
  not imagine that any immediate danger threatened her, she must be got out of
  409, Grosvenor Square, at the earliest opportunity.</p>

  <p>If Lady Mary were only in London, how simple it would be! As it was, he
  had neither the authority to command nor the influence to request.</p>

  <p>He drove up to 409, Grosvenor Square, and was immediately shown into Digby
  Groat's study.</p>

  <p>"How do you do, Mr. Steele," said that bland gentleman. "Take a seat, will
  you? It is much more comfortable than hiding under the table," he added, and
  Jim smiled.</p>

  <p>"Now, what can I do for you?"</p>

  <p>"I want to see Miss Weldon," said Jim.</p>

  <p>"I believe the lady is out; but I will inquire."</p>

  <p>He rang the bell and immediately a servant answered the summons.</p>

  <p>"Will you ask Miss Weldon to step down here?"</p>

  <p>"It is not necessary that I should see her here," said Jim.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry," smiled Digby. "I will make my exit at the proper
  moment."</p>

  <p>The maid returned, however, with the news that the lady had gone out.</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Jim, taking up his hat, and with a smile as bland as his
  unwilling host's, "I will wait outside until she comes in."</p>

  <p>"Admirable persistence!" murmured Digby. "Perhaps I can find her."</p>

  <p>He went out and returned again in a few minutes with Eunice.</p>

  <p>"The maid was quite misinformed," he said urbanely. "Miss Weldon had not
  gone out."</p>

  <p>He favoured her with a little bow and left the room, closing the door
  behind him.</p>

  <p>Eunice stood with her hands behind her, looking at the man on whom her
  hopes and thoughts had centred, and about whose conduct such a storm was
  still raging in her bosom.</p>

  <p>"You want to see me, Mr. Steele?"</p>

  <p>Her attitude shook his self-possession and drove from his mind all the
  carefully reasoned arguments he had prepared.</p>

  <p>"I want you to leave this house, Eunice," he said.</p>

  <p>"Have you a new reason?" she asked, though she hated herself for the
  sarcasm.</p>

  <p>"I have the best of reasons," he said doggedly. "I am satisfied that you
  are the daughter of Lady Mary Danton."</p>

  <p>Again she smiled.</p>

  <p>"I think you've used that argument before, haven't you?"</p>

  <p>"Listen, Eunice, I beg of you," he pleaded. "I can prove that you are Lady
  Mary's daughter. That scar on your wrist was made by Digby Groat when you
  were a baby. And there is no Eunice Weldon. We have proved that she died in
  Cape Town a year after you were born."</p>

  <p>She regarded him steadily, and his heart sank.</p>

  <p>"That is very romantic," she said, "and have you anything further to
  say?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, except the lady you saw in my room was your mother."</p>

  <p>Her eyes opened wider and then he saw a little smile come and go like a
  ray of winter sunshine on her lips.</p>

  <p>"Really, Jim," she said, "you should write stories. And if it interests
  you, I might tell you that I am leaving this house in a few days. I am going
  back to my old employment. I don't want you to explain who the woman was who
  has the misfortune to be without a telephone and the good fortune to have the
  key of your flat," she said, her anger swamping the pity she had for him. "I
  only want to tell you that you have shaken my faith in men more than Digby
  Groat or any other man could have done. You have hurt me beyond
  forgiveness."</p>

  <p>For a moment her voice quivered, and then with an effort of will she
  pulled herself together and walked to the door. "Good-bye, Jim," she said,
  and was gone.</p>

  <p>He stood as she had left him, stunned, unable to believe his ears. Her
  scorn struck him like a whip, the injustice of her view of him deprived him
  of speech.</p>

  <p>For a second a blinding wave of anger drowned all other emotions, but this
  passed. He could have gone now, for there was no hope of seeing her again and
  explaining even if he had been willing to offer any explanation.</p>

  <p>But he stayed on. He was anxious to meet Digby Groat and find from his
  attitude what part he had played in forming the girl's mind. The humour of
  the situation struck him and he laughed, though his laughter was filtered
  through a pain that was so nearly physical that he could not distinguish the
  one from the other.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch28"
     name="ch28"></a>CHAPTER 28</h2>

  <p class="first">THE end was coming. Digby Groat took too sane a view of
  things to mistake the signs.</p>

  <p>For two years he had been in negotiation with a land agent in San Paulo
  and had practically completed the purchase of an estate. By subterranean
  methods he had skilfully disguised the identity of the purchaser, and on that
  magnificent ranch he intended to spend a not unpleasant life. It might not
  come to a question of flight, in which case the ranch would be a diversion
  from the humdrum life of England. And more than ever was he determined that
  Eunice Weldon should accompany him, and share, at any rate, a year of his
  life. Afterwards - he shrugged his shoulders. Women had come into his life
  before, had at first fascinated, and then bored him, and had disappeared from
  his ken. Probably Eunice would go the same way, though he could not
  contemplate the possibility at the moment.</p>

  <p>The hours of the morning passed all too slowly for Jim Steele. The partner
  brothers had said that their "Mr. Harry" would arrive at one o'clock, and
  punctually at that hour Jim was waiting in the outer office.</p>

  <p>Mr. Harry's train, however, must have been late. It was nearer two when he
  came in, followed by a porter carrying a thick parcel under his arm.
  Presently the porter came out. "Will you go in, sir," he said respectfully,
  and Jim stepped quickly into the room.</p>

  <p>Mr. Harry, whom he had thought of as a boy, was a grave man of fifty, and
  apparently the younger brother of the eldest partner.</p>

  <p>"We have found the log of the Battledore," said that gentleman, "but I
  have forgotten the date."</p>

  <p>"June 21st," said Jim.</p>

  <p>The log lay open upon the big table, and its presence brought an
  atmosphere of romance into this quiet orderly office.</p>

  <p>"Here we are," said the partner. "Battledore left Tilbury 9 a.m. on the
  tide. Wind east by south-east, sea smooth, hazy." He ran his fingers down.
  "This is what I think you want."</p>

  <p>For Jim it was a moment of intense drama. The partner was reading some
  preliminary and suddenly he came to the entry which was to make all the
  difference in the world to the woman whom Jim loved dearer than life.</p>

  <p>"'Heavy fog, speed reduced at 11.50 to half. Reduced to quarter speed at
  12.1. Bosun reported that we had run down small rowing boat and that he had
  seen two persons in the water. Able seaman Grant went overboard and rescued
  child. The second person was not found. Speed increased, endeavoured to speak
  Dungeness, but weather too hazy for flag signals' - this was before the days
  of wireless, you must understand, Mr. Steele." Jim nodded.</p>

  <p>"'Sex of child discovered, girl, apparent age a few months. Child handed
  to stewardess.'"</p>

  <p>Entry followed entry, but there was no further reference to the child
  until he came to Funchal.</p>

  <p>"In the island of Madeira," he explained. "'Arrived Funchal 6 a.m.
  Reported recovery of child to British Consul, who said he would cable to
  London.'"</p>

  <p>The next entry was: "Dakka - a port on the West Coast of Africa and French
  protectorate," said the partner. "'Received cable from British Consul at
  Funchal saying no loss of child reported to London police.'"</p>

  <p>There was no other entry which affected Jim until one on the third day
  before the ship arrived at Cape Town.</p>

  <p>"'Mr. Weldon, a Cape Town resident who is travelling with his wife for her
  health, has offered to adopt the child picked up by us on June 21st, having
  recently lost one of his own. Mr. Weldon being known to the Captain and
  vouched for by Canon Jesson' - this was apparently a fellow-passenger of
  his," explained the partner - "'the child was handed to his care, on
  condition that the matter was reported to the authorities in Cape Town.'"</p>

  <p>A full description of the size, weight, and colouring of the little waif
  followed, and against the query "Marks on Body" were the words "Scar on right
  wrist, doctor thinks the result of a recent burn."</p>

  <p>Jim drew a long sigh.</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell you gentlemen how grateful I am to you. You have righted a
  great wrong and have earned the gratitude of the child who is now a
  woman."</p>

  <p>"Do you think that this is the young lady?"</p>

  <p>Jim nodded.</p>

  <p>"I am sure," he said quietly. "The log of Captain Pinnings supplies the
  missing link of evidence. We may have to ask you to produce this log in
  court, but I hope that the claim of our client will not be disputed."</p>

  <p>He walked down Threadneedle Street, treading on air, and the fact that
  while he had gained for Eunice - her name was Dorothy now, but she would be
  always Eunice to him - a fortune, he had lost the greatest fortune that could
  be bestowed upon a man, did not disturb his joy.</p>

  <p>He had made a rough copy of the log, and with this in his hand he drove to
  Septimus Salter's office and without a word laid the extracts before him.</p>

  <p>Mr. Salter read, and as he read his eyes lit up.</p>

  <p>"The whole thing is remarkably clear," he said; "the log proves the
  identity of Lady Mary's daughter. Your investigations are practically
  complete?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet, sir," smiled Jim. "We have first to displace Jane Groat and her
  son," he hesitated, "and we must persuade Miss Danton to leave that
  house."</p>

  <p>"In that case," said the lawyer, rising, "I think an older man's advice
  will be more acceptable than yours, my boy, and I'll go with you."</p>

  <p>A new servant opened the door, and almost at the sound of the knock, Digby
  came out of his study, urbane and as perfectly groomed as usual.</p>

  <p>"I want to see Miss Weldon," said the lawyer, and Digby stiffened at the
  sight of him. He would have felt more uncomfortable if he had known what was
  in Salter's mind.</p>

  <p>Digby was looking at him straightly; his whole attitude, thought Jim, was
  one of tense anxiety.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry you cannot see Miss Weldon," he said, speaking slowly. "She
  left with my mother by an early Continental train and at this moment, I
  should imagine, is somewhere in the region of Paris."</p>

  <p>"That is a damned lie!" said Jim Steele calmly.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch29"
     name="ch29"></a>CHAPTER 29</h2>

  <p class="first">THEY stood confronting one another, two men with murder in
  their hearts.</p>

  <p>"It is a lie!" repeated Jim. "Miss Weldon is either here or she has been
  taken to that hell house of yours in Somerset!"</p>

  <p>For the time being Digby Groat was less concerned by Jim's vehement insult
  than he was by the presence of the lawyer.</p>

  <p>"So you lend yourself to this blackguardly outrage," he sneered. "I should
  have thought a man of your experience would have refused to have been made a
  dupe of by this fellow. Anyway," he turned to Jim, "Miss Weldon wants no more
  to do with you. She has told me about that quarrel, and really, Steele, you
  have behaved very badly."</p>

  <p>The man was lying. Jim did not think twice about that. Eunice would never
  have made a confidant of him.</p>

  <p>"What is your interest in Miss Weldon?" asked Digby, addressing the
  lawyer.</p>

  <p>"Outside of a human interest, none," said old Salter, and Jim was
  staggered.</p>

  <p>"But - " he began.</p>

  <p>"I think we had better go, Steele," Salter interrupted him with a warning
  glance.</p>

  <p>They were some distance from the house before Jim spoke.</p>

  <p>"But why didn't you tell him, Mr. Salter, that Eunice was the heiress of
  the Danton fortune?"</p>

  <p>Salter looked at him with an odd queer expression in his bright blue
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Suppose all you fear has happened," he said gently. "Suppose this man is
  the villain that we both believe he is, and the girl is in his power. What
  would be the consequence of my telling him that Eunice Weldon was in a
  position to strip him of every penny he possesses, to turn him out of his
  house and reduce him to penury?"</p>

  <p>Jim bit his lip.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, sir." he said humbly. "I'm an impetuous fool."</p>

  <p>"So long as Digby Groat does not know that Eunice threatens his position
  she is comparatively safe. At any rate, her life is safe. Once we let him
  learn all that we know, she is doomed."</p>

  <p>Jim nodded. "Do you think, then, that she is in real danger?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I am certain that Mr. Digby Groat would not hesitate at murder to serve
  his ends," said the lawyer gruffly.</p>

  <p>They did not speak again until they were in the office in Marlborough
  Street, and then Jim threw himself down in a chair with a groan and covered
  his face with his hands.</p>

  <p>"It seems as if we are powerless," he said bitterly, and then, looking up,
  "Surely, Mr. Salter, the law is greater than Digby Groat. Are there no
  processes we can set in motion to pull him down?" It was very seldom old
  Septimus Salter smoked in his office, but this was an occasion for an
  extraordinary happening. He took from a cabinet an old meerschaum pipe and
  polishing it on the sleeve of his broad-cloth coat, slowly filled it, packing
  down the straggling strands of tobacco which overflowed the pipe, with
  exasperating calmness.</p>

  <p>"The law, my boy, is greater than Digby Groat, and greater than you or I.
  Sometimes ignorant people laugh at it, sometimes they sneer at it, generally
  they curse it. But there it is, the old dilatory machinery, grinding slow and
  grinding exceedingly small. It is not confined to the issue of search
  warrants, of arrest and judgments. It has a thousand weapons to strike at the
  cheat and the villain, and, by God, every one of those weapons shall be
  employed against Digby Groat!"</p>

  <p>Jim sprang to his feet and gripped the old man's hand. "And if the law
  cannot touch him," he said, "I will make a law of these two hands and
  strangle the life out of him."</p>

  <p>Mr. Salter looked at him admiringly, but a little amused. "In which case,
  my dear Steele," he said dryly, "the law will take you in her two hands and
  strangle the life out of you, and it doesn't seem worth while, when a few
  little pieces of paper will probably bring about as effective a result as
  your wilful murder of this damnable scoundrel."</p>

  <p>Immediately Jim began his inquiries. To his surprise he learnt that the
  party had actually been driven to Victoria Station. It consisted of Eunice
  and old Mrs. Groat. Moreover, two tickets for Paris had been taken by Digby
  and two seats reserved in the Pullman. It was through these Pullman
  reservations that the names of Eunice and the old woman were easy to trace,
  as Digby Groat intended they should be.</p>

  <p>Whether they had left by the train, he could not discover.</p>

  <p>He returned to the lawyer and reported progress.</p>

  <p>"The fact that Jane Groat has gone does not prove that our client has also
  gone," said the lawyer sensibly.</p>

  <p>"Our client?" said Jim, puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Our client," repeated Septimus Salter with a smile. "Do not forget that
  Miss Danton is our client, and until she authorizes me to hand her interests
  elsewhere - "</p>

  <p>"Mr. Salter," interrupted Jim, "when was the Danton estate handed over to
  Bennetts?"</p>

  <p>"This morning," was the staggering reply, though Mr. Salter did not seem
  particularly depressed.</p>

  <p>"Good heavens," gasped Jim, "then the estate is in Digby Groat's
  hands?"</p>

  <p>The lawyer nodded.</p>

  <p>"For a while," he said, "but don't let that worry you at all. You get
  along with your search. Have you heard from Lady Mary?"</p>

  <p>"Who, sir?" said Jim, again staggered.</p>

  <p>"Lady Mary Danton," said the lawyer, enjoying his surprise. "Your
  mysterious woman in black. Obviously it was Lady Mary. I never had any doubt
  of it, but when I learnt about the Blue Hand, I was certain. You see, my
  boy," he said with a twinkle in his eyes, "I have been making a few inquiries
  in a direction which you have neglected."</p>

  <p>"What does the Blue Hand mean?" asked Jim.</p>

  <p>"Lady Mary will tell you one of these days, and until she does, I do not
  feel at liberty to take you into my confidence. Have you ever been to a
  dyer's, Steele?"</p>

  <p>"A dyer's, sir; yes, I've been to a dye-works, if that is what you
  mean."</p>

  <p>"Have you ever seen the hands of the women who use indigo?"</p>

  <p>"Do you suggest that when she disappeared she went to a dye-works?" said
  Jim incredulously.</p>

  <p>"She will tell you," replied the lawyer, and with that he had to be
  content.</p>

  <p>The work was now too serious and the strings were too widely distributed
  to carry on alone. Salter enlisted the services of two ex-officers of the
  Metropolitan Police who had established a detective agency, and at a
  conference that afternoon the whole of the story, as far as it was known, was
  revealed to Jim's new helpers, ex-Inspector Holder and ex-Sergeant Field.</p>

  <p>That afternoon Digby Groat, looking impatiently out of the window, saw a
  bearded man strolling casually along the garden side of the square, a pipe in
  his mouth, apparently absorbed in the contemplation of nature and the
  architectural beauty of Grosvenor Square. He did not pay as much attention to
  the lounger as he might have done, had not his scrutiny been interrupted by
  the arrival of Mr. Bennett, an angular, sandy-haired Scotsman, who was not
  particularly enamoured of his new employer.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. Bennett, has old Salter handed over all the documents?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said Bennett, "every one."</p>

  <p>"You are sure he has not been up to any trickery?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Bennett regarded him coldly.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Septimus Salter, sir," he said quietly, "is an eminent lawyer, whose
  name is respected wherever it is mentioned. Great lawyers do not indulge in
  trickery."</p>

  <p>"Well, you needn't get offended. Good Lord, you don't suppose he feels
  friendly towards you, do you?"</p>

  <p>"What he feels to me, sir," said Mr. Bennett, his strong northern accent
  betraying his annoyance, "is a matter of complete indifference. It is what I
  think of him that we are discussing. The leases of the Lakeside Property have
  been prepared for transfer. You are not losing much time, Mr. Groat."</p>

  <p>"No," said Digby, after a moment's thought. "The fact is, the people in
  the syndicate which is purchasing this property are very anxious to take
  possession. What is the earliest you can transfer?"</p>

  <p>"To-morrow," was the reply. "I suppose " - he hesitated - "I suppose there
  is no question of the original heiress of the will - Dorothy Danton, I think
  her name is - turning up unexpectedly at the last moment?"</p>

  <p>Digby smiled.</p>

  <p>"Dorothy Danton, as you call her, has been food for the fishes these
  twenty years," he said. "Don't you worry your head about her."</p>

  <p>"Very good," said Bennett, producing a number of papers from a black
  leather portfolio. "Your signature will be required on four of these, and the
  signature of your mother on the fifth."</p>

  <p>Digby frowned.</p>

  <p>"My mother? I thought it was unnecessary that she should sign anything. I
  have her Power of Attorney."</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately the Power of Attorney is not sufficiently comprehensive to
  allow you to sign away certain royalty rights which descended to her through
  her father. They are not very valuable," said the lawyer, "but they give her
  lien upon Kennett Hall, and in these circumstances, I think you had better
  not depend upon the Power of Attorney in case there is any dispute. Mr.
  Salter is a very shrewd man, and when the particulars of this transaction are
  brought to his notice, I think it is very likely that, feeling his
  responsibility as Mr. Danton's late lawyer, he will enter a caveat."</p>

  <p>"What is a caveat?"</p>

  <p>"Literally," said Mr. Bennett, "a caveat emptor means 'let the purchaser
  beware,' and if a caveat is entered, your syndicate would not dare take the
  risk of paying you for the property, even though the caveat had no effect
  upon the estate which were transferred by virtue of your Power of
  Attorney."</p>

  <p>Digby tugged at his little moustache and stared out of the window for a
  long time.</p>

  <p>"All right, I'll get her signature."</p>

  <p>"She is in Paris, I understand."</p>

  <p>Digby shot a quick glance at him.</p>

  <p>"How do you know?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I had to call at Mr. Salter's office to-day," he said, "to verify and
  agree to the list of securities which he handed me, and he mentioned the
  matter in passing."</p>

  <p>Digby growled something under his breath.</p>

  <p>"Is it necessary that you should see Salter at all?" he asked with
  asperity.</p>

  <p>"It is necessary that I should conduct my own business in my own way,"
  said Mr. Bennett with that acid smile of his.</p>

  <p>Digby shot an angry glance at him and resolved that as soon as the
  business was completed, he would have little use for this uncompromising
  Scotsman. He hated the law and he hated lawyers, and he had been under the
  impression that Messrs. Bennett would be so overwhelmed with joy at the
  prospect of administering his estate that they would agree to any suggestion
  he made. He had yet to learn that the complacent lawyer is a figure of
  fiction, and if he is found at all, it is in the character of the seedy
  broken-down old solicitor who hangs about Police Courts and who interviews
  his clients in the bar parlour of the nearest public-house.</p>

  <p>"Very good," he said, "give me the paper. I will get her to sign it."</p>

  <p>"Will you go to Paris?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Digby. "I'll send it across by - er - aeroplane."</p>

  <p>The lawyer gathered up the papers and thrust them back into the
  wallet.</p>

  <p>"Then I will see you at twelve o'clock to-morrow at the office of the
  Northern Land Syndicate."</p>

  <p>Digby nodded.</p>

  <p>"Oh, by the way, Bennett" - he called the lawyer back - "I wish you to put
  this house in the market. I shall be spending a great deal of my time abroad
  and I have no use for this costly property. I want a quick sale, by the
  way."</p>

  <p>"A quick sale is a bad sale for the seller," quoth the lawyer, "but I'll
  do what I can for you, Mr. Groat. Do you want to dispose of the
  furniture?"</p>

  <p>Digby nodded.</p>

  <p>"And you have another house in the country?"</p>

  <p>"That is not for sale," said Digby shortly.</p>

  <p>When the lawyer had gone he went up to his room and changed, taking his
  time over his toilet.</p>

  <p>"Now," he said as he drew on his gloves with a quiet smile, "I have to
  induce Eunice to be a good girl!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch30"
     name="ch30"></a>CHAPTER 30</h2>

  <p class="first">DIGBY GROAT made an unexpected journey to the west. A good
  general, even in the hour of his victory, prepares the way for retreat, and
  the possibility of Kennett Hall had long appealed to Digby as a likely refuge
  in a case of emergency.</p>

  <p>Kennett Hall was one of the properties which his mother had inherited and
  which, owing to his failure to secure her signature, had not been prepared
  for transfer to the land syndicate. It had been the home of the Danton family
  for 140 years. A rambling, neglected house, standing in a big and gloomy
  park, it had been untenanted almost as long as Digby could remember.</p>

  <p>He had sent his car down in the early morning, but he himself had gone by
  train. He disliked long motor journeys, and though he intended coming back by
  road, he preferred the quietude and smooth progress of the morning railway
  journey.</p>

  <p>The car, covered with dust, was waiting for him at the railway station,
  and the few officials who constituted the station staff watched him go out of
  the gate without evidence of enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"That's Groat who owns Kennett Hall, isn't it?" said the porter to the
  aged station-master.</p>

  <p>"That's him," was the reply. "It was a bad day for this country when that
  property came into old Jane Groat's hands. A bad woman, that, if ever there
  was one."</p>

  <p>Unconscious of the criticisms of his mother, Digby was bowling up the hill
  road leading to the gates of Kennett Hall. The gates themselves were
  magnificent specimens of seventeenth-century ironwork, but the lodges on
  either side were those ugly stuccoed huts with which the mid-Victorian
  architect "embellished" the estates of the great. They had not been occupied
  for twenty years, and bore the appearance of their neglect. The little
  gardens which once had flowered so cheerfully before the speckless windows,
  were overrun by weeds, and the gravel drive, seen through the gates, was
  almost indistinguishable from the grassland on either side.</p>

  <p>The caretaker came running down the drive to unlock the gates. He was an
  ill-favoured man of fifty with a perpetual scowl, which even the presence of
  his master could not wholly eradicate.</p>

  <p>"Has anybody been here, Masters?" asked Digby.</p>

  <p>"No, sir," said the man, "except the flying gentleman. He came this
  morning. What a wonderful thing flying is, sir! The way he came down in the
  Home Park was wonderful to see."</p>

  <p>"Get on the step with the driver," said Digby curtly, who was not
  interested in his servitor's views of flying.</p>

  <p>The car drove through a long avenue of elms and turned to breast a
  treeless slope that led up to the lower terrace. All the beauty and
  loveliness of Somerset in which it stood could not save Kennett Hall from the
  reproach of dreariness. Its parapets were crumbled by the wind and rain of
  long-forgotten seasons, and its face was scarred and stained with thirty
  winters' rains. Its black and dusty windows seemed to leer upon the fresh
  clean beauty of the world, as though in pride of its sheer ugliness.</p>

  <p>For twenty years no painter's brush had touched the drab and ugly woodwork
  and the weeds grew high where roses used to bloom. Three great white seats of
  marble, that were placed against the crumbling terrace balustrade, were green
  with drippings from the neglected trees; the terrace floor was broken and the
  rags and tatters of dead seasons spread their mouldering litter of leaves and
  twigs and moss upon the marble walk where stately dames had trodden in those
  brave days when Kennett Hall was a name to inspire awe.</p>

  <p>Digby was not depressed by his view of the property. He had seen it
  before, and at one time had thought of pulling it down and, erecting a modern
  building for his own comfort.</p>

  <p>The man he had called Masters unlocked the big door and ushered him into
  the house.</p>

  <p>The neglect was here apparent. As he stepped into the big bleak entrance
  he heard the scurry and scamper of tiny feet and smiled.</p>

  <p>"You've got some rats here?"</p>

  <p>"Rats?" said Masters in a tone of resignation, "there's a colony of them,
  sir. It is as much as I can do to keep them out of my quarters, but there's
  nothing in the east wing," he hastened to add. "I had a couple of terriers
  and ferrets here for a month keeping them down, and they're all on this side
  of the house." He jerked his head to the right.</p>

  <p>"Is the flying gentleman here?"</p>

  <p>"He's having breakfast, sir, at this minute."</p>

  <p>Digby followed the caretaker down a long gloomy passage on the ground
  floor, and passed through the door that the man opened.</p>

  <p>The bearded Villa nodded with a humorous glint in his eye as Digby
  entered. From his appearance and dress, he had evidently arrived by
  aeroplane.</p>

  <p>"Well, you got here," said Digby, glancing at the huge meal which had been
  put before the man.</p>

  <p>"I got here," said Villa with an extravagant flourish of his knife. "But
  only by the favour of the gods. I do not like these scout machines: you must
  get Bronson to pilot it back."</p>

  <p>Digby nodded, and pulling out a rickety chair, sat down.</p>

  <p>"I have given instructions for Bronson to come here - he will arrive
  to-night," he said.</p>

  <p>"Good," muttered the man, continuing his meal.</p>

  <p>Masters had gone, and Villa was listening to the receding sound of his
  footsteps upon the uncovered boards, before he asked:</p>

  <p>"What is the idea of this, governor? You are not changing
  headquarters?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," replied Digby shortly, "but the Seaford aerodrome is under
  observation. At least, Steele knows, or guesses, all about it. I have decided
  to hire some commercial pilots to give an appearance of genuine business to
  the company."</p>

  <p>Villa whistled.</p>

  <p>"This place is no use to you, governor," he said, shaking his head.
  "They'd tumble to Kennett Hall - that's what you call it, isn't it?" He had
  an odd way of introducing slang words into his tongue, for he spoke in
  Spanish, and Digby smiled at "tumble."</p>

  <p>"You're becoming quite an expert in the English language, Villa."</p>

  <p>"But why are you coming here?" persisted the other. "This could only be a
  temporary headquarters. Is the game slipping?" he asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>Digby nodded.</p>

  <p>"It may come to a case of sauve qui peut," he said, "though I hope it will
  not. Everything depends upon - " He did not finish his sentence, but asked
  abruptly: "How far is the sea from here?"</p>

  <p>"Not a great distance," was the reply. "I travelled at six thousand feet
  and I could see the Bristol Channel quite distinctly."</p>

  <p>Digby was stroking his chin, looking thoughtfully at the table.</p>

  <p>"I can trust you, Villa," he said, "so I tell you now, much as you dislike
  these fast machines, you've got to hold yourself in readiness to pilot me to
  safety. Again, I say that I do not think it will come to flight, but we must
  be prepared. In the meantime, I have a commission for you," he said. "It was
  not only to bring the machine that I arranged for you to come to this
  place."</p>

  <p>Villa had guessed that.</p>

  <p>"There is a man in Deauville to whom you have probably seen references in
  the newspapers, a man named Maxilla. He is a rich coffee planter of
  Brazil."</p>

  <p>"The gambler?" said the other in surprise, and Digby nodded.</p>

  <p>"I happen to know that Maxilla has had a very bad time - he lost nearly
  twenty million francs in one week, and that doesn't represent all his losses.
  He has been gambling at Aix and at San Sebastian, and I should think he is in
  a pretty desperate position."</p>

  <p>"But he wouldn't be broke," said Villa, shaking his head. "I know the man
  you mean. Why, he's as rich as Croesus! I saw his yacht when you sent me to
  Havre. A wonderful ship, worth a quarter of a million. He has hundreds of
  square miles of coffee plantations in Brazil - "</p>

  <p>"I know all about that," said Digby impatiently. "The point is, that for
  the moment he is very short of money. Now, do not ask me any questions,
  Villa: accept my word."</p>

  <p>"What do you want me to do?" asked the man.</p>

  <p>"Go to Deauville, take your slow machine and fly there; see Maxilla - you
  speak Portuguese?"</p>

  <p>Villa nodded.</p>

  <p>"Like a native," he said. "I lived in Lisbon - "</p>

  <p>"Never mind where you lived," interrupted Digby, unpleasantly. "You will
  see Maxilla, and if, as I believe, he is short of money, offer him a hundred
  thousand pounds for his yacht. He may want double that, and you must be
  prepared to pay it. Maxilla hasn't the best of reputations, and probably his
  crew - who are all Brazilians by the way - will be glad to sail under another
  flag. If you can effect the purchase, send me a wire, and order the boat to
  be brought round to the Bristol Channel to be coaled."</p>

  <p>"It is an oil-running ship," said Villa.</p>

  <p>"Well, it must take on supplies of oil and provisions for a month's
  voyage. The captain will come straight to me in London to receive his
  instructions. I dare say one of his officers can bring the boat across. Now,
  is that clear to you?"</p>

  <p>"Everything is clear to me, my dear friend," said Villa blandly, "except
  two things. To buy a yacht I must have money."</p>

  <p>"That I will give you before you go."</p>

  <p>"Secondly," said Villa, putting the stump of his forefinger in his palm,
  "where does poor August Villa come into this?"</p>

  <p>"You get away as well," said Digby.</p>

  <p>"I see," said Villa.</p>

  <p>"Maxilla must not know that I am the purchaser under any circumstances,"
  Digby went on. "You may either be buying the boat for yourself in your
  capacity as a rich Cuban planter, or you may be buying it for an unknown
  friend. I will arrange to keep the captain and the crew quiet as soon as I am
  on board. You leave for Deauville tonight."</p>

  <p>He had other preparations to make. Masters received an order to prepare
  two small rooms and to arrange for beds and bedding to be erected, and the
  instructions filled him with consternation.</p>

  <p>"Don't argue with me," said Digby angrily. "Go into Bristol, into any
  town, buy the beds and bring them out in a car. I don't care what it costs.
  And get a square of carpet for the floor."</p>

  <p>He tossed a bundle of notes into the man's band, and Masters, who had
  never seen so much money in his life, nearly dropped them in sheer
  amazement.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch31"
     name="ch31"></a>CHAPTER 31</h2>

  <p class="first">DIGBY GROAT returned to town by car and reached Grosvenor
  Square in time for dinner. He had a hasty meal and then went up to his room
  and changed.</p>

  <p>He passed the room that Eunice occupied and found Jackson sitting on a
  chair before the door.</p>

  <p>"She's all right," said the man, grinning. "I've shuttered and padlocked
  the windows and I've told her that if she doesn't want me to make friendly
  calls she has to behave."</p>

  <p>Digby nodded.</p>

  <p>"And my mother - you gave her the little box?"</p>

  <p>Again Jackson grinned.</p>

  <p>"And she's happy," he said. "I never dreamt she was a dope, Mr. Groat -
  "</p>

  <p>"There is no need for you to dream anything," said Digby sharply.</p>

  <p>He had a call to make. Lady Waltham was giving a dance that night, and
  there would be present two members of the syndicate whom he was to meet on
  the following morning. One of these drew him aside during the progress of the
  dance.</p>

  <p>"I suppose those transfers are quite in order for to-morrow," he said.</p>

  <p>Digby nodded.</p>

  <p>"Some of my people are curious to know why you want cash," he said,
  looking at Digby with a smile.</p>

  <p>The other shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"You seem to forget, my dear man," he said suavely, "that I am merely an
  agent in these matters, and that I am acting for my rather eccentric mother.
  God bless her!"</p>

  <p>"That is the explanation which had occurred to me," said the financier.
  "The papers will be in order, of course? I seem to remember you saying that
  there was another paper which had to be signed by your mother."</p>

  <p>Digby remembered with an unspoken oath that he had neglected to secure
  this signature. As soon as he could, he made his excuses and returned to
  Grosvenor Square.</p>

  <p>His mother's room was locked, but she heard his gentle tap.</p>

  <p>"Who is that?" she demanded in audible agitation.</p>

  <p>"It is Digby."</p>

  <p>"I will see you in the morning."</p>

  <p>"I want to see you tonight," interrupted Digby sharply. "Open the
  door."</p>

  <p>It was some time before she obeyed. She was in her dressing-gown, and her
  yellow face was grey with fear.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to disturb you, mother," said Digby, closing the door behind
  him, "but I have a document which must be signed tonight."</p>

  <p>"I gave you everything you wanted," she said tremulously, "didn't I, dear?
  Everything you wanted, my boy?"</p>

  <p>She had not the remotest idea that he was disposing of her property.</p>

  <p>"Couldn't I sign it in the morning?" she pleaded. "My hand is so
  shaky."</p>

  <p>"Sign it now," he almost shouted, and she obeyed.</p>

  <p>* * *</p>

  <p>The Northern Land Syndicate was but one branch of a great finance
  corporation, and had been called into existence to acquire the Danton
  properties. In a large, handsomely furnished board-room, members of the
  syndicate were waiting. Lord Waltham was one; Hugo Vindt, the bluff,
  good-natured Jewish financier, whose fingers were in most of the business
  pies, was the second; and Felix Strathellan, that debonair man-about-town,
  was the important third - for he was one of the shrewdest land speculators in
  the kingdom.</p>

  <p>A fourth member of the party was presently shown in in the person of the
  Scotch lawyer, Bennett, who carried under his arm a black portfolio, which he
  laid on the table.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, gentlemen," he said shortly. Millionaires' syndicates had
  long failed to impress him.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Bennett," said his lordship. "Have you seen your client
  this morning?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Bennett made a wry face as he unstrapped the portfolio.</p>

  <p>"No, my lord, I have not," he said, and suggested by his tone that he was
  not at all displeased that he had missed a morning interview with Digby
  Groat.</p>

  <p>"A queer fellow is Groat," said Vindt with a laugh. "He is not a business
  man, and yet he has curiously keen methods. I should never have guessed he
  was an Englishman: he looks more like a Latin, don't you think. Lord
  Waltham?"</p>

  <p>His lordship nodded.</p>

  <p>"A queer family, the Groats," he said. "I wonder how many of you fellows
  know that his mother is a kleptomaniac?"</p>

  <p>"Good heavens," said Strathellan in amazement, "you don't mean that?"</p>

  <p>His lordship nodded.</p>

  <p>"She's quite a rum old lady now," he said, "though there was a time when
  she was as handsome a woman as there was in town. She used to visit us a lot,
  and invariably we discovered, when she had gone, that some little trinket,
  very often a perfectly worthless trifle, but on one occasion a rather
  valuable bracelet belonging to my daughter, had disappeared with her. Until I
  realized the true condition of affairs it used to worry me, but the moment I
  spoke to Groat, the property was restored, and we came to expect this
  evidence of her eccentricity. She's a lucky woman," he added.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't say that with a son like Digby," smiled Strathellan, who was
  drawing figures idly on his blotting-pad.</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, she's lucky," persisted his lordship. "If that child of the
  Dantons hadn't been killed, the Groats would have been as poor as Church
  mice."</p>

  <p>"Did you ever meet Lady Mary, my lord?" asked Vindt.</p>

  <p>Lord Waltham nodded.</p>

  <p>"I met Lady Mary and the baby," he said quietly; "I used to be on dining
  terms with the Dantons. And a beautiful little baby she was."</p>

  <p>"What baby is this?" asked a voice.</p>

  <p>Digby Groat had come in in his noiseless fashion, and closed the door of
  the board-room softly behind him. The question was the first intimation they
  had of his presence, all except Lord Waltham, who, out of the corner of his
  eye, had seen his entrance.</p>

  <p>"We were talking about Lady Mary's baby, your cousin."</p>

  <p>Digby Groat smiled contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"It will not profit us very much to discuss her." he said.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember her at all, Groat?" asked Waltham.</p>

  <p>"Dimly," said Digby with a careless shrug. "I'm not frightfully keen, on
  babies. I have a faint recollection that she was once staying in our house,
  and I associate her with prodigious howling! Is everything all right,
  Bennett?"</p>

  <p>Bennett nodded.</p>

  <p>"Here is the paper you asked for." Digby took it from his pocket and laid
  it before the lawyer, who unfolded it leisurely and read it with exasperating
  slowness.</p>

  <p>"That is in order," he said. "Now, gentlemen, we will get to
  business."</p>

  <p>Such of them who were not already seated about the table, drew up their
  chairs.</p>

  <p>"Your insistence upon having the money in cash has been rather a nuisance,
  Groat," said Lord Waltham, picking up a tin box from the floor and opening
  it. "I hate to have a lot of money in the office; it has meant the employment
  of two special watchmen."</p>

  <p>"I will pay," said Digby good-humouredly, watching with greedy eyes as
  bundle after bundle of notes was laid upon the table.</p>

  <p>The lawyer twisted round the paper and offered him a pen.</p>

  <p>"You will sign here, Mr. Groat," he said.</p>

  <p>At that moment Vindt turned his head to the clerk who had just
  entered.</p>

  <p>"For me?" he said, indicating the letter in the man's hand.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, for Mr. Bennett."</p>

  <p>Bennett took the note, looked at the name embossed upon the flap, and
  frowned.</p>

  <p>"From Salter," he said, "and it is marked 'urgent and important.'"</p>

  <p>"Let it wait until after we have finished the business," said Digby
  impatiently.</p>

  <p>"You had better see what it is," replied the lawyer, and took out a
  typewritten sheet of paper. He read it through carefully.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" asked Digby.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid this sale cannot go through," answered the lawyer slowly.
  "Salter has entered a caveat against the transfer of the property."</p>

  <p>Livid with rage Digby sprang to his feet.</p>

  <p>"What right has he?" he demanded savagely. "He is no longer my lawyer: he
  has no right to act. Who authorized him?"</p>

  <p>The lawyer had a queer expression on his face.</p>

  <p>"This caveat," he said, speaking deliberately, "has been entered by Salter
  on behalf of Dorothy Danton, who, according to the letter, is still
  alive."</p>

  <p>There was a painful silence, which the voice of Vindt broke.</p>

  <p>"So that settles the transfer," he said. "We cannot go on with this
  business, you understand, Groat?"</p>

  <p>"But I insist on the transfer going through," cried Digby violently. "The
  whole thing is a plot got up by that dithering old fool, Salter. Everybody
  knows that Dorothy Danton is dead! She has been dead for twenty years."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless," said Lord Waltham quietly, "we cannot move in face of the
  caveat. Without being a legal instrument, it places upon the purchasers of
  the property the fullest responsibility for their purchase."</p>

  <p>"But I will sign the transfer," said Digby vehemently.</p>

  <p>Lord Waltham shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It would not matter if you signed twenty transfers," he said. "If we paid
  you the money for this property and it proved to be the property of Miss
  Danton, as undoubtedly it would prove, if she were alive, we, and only we,
  would be responsible. We should have to surrender the property and look to
  you to refund us the money we had invested in the estate. No, no, Groat, if
  it is, as you say, a bluff on the part of Salter - and upon my word, I cannot
  imagine a man of Salter's position, age and experience putting up empty bluff
  - then we can have a meeting on another day and the deal can go through. We
  are very eager to acquire these properties."</p>

  <p>There was a murmur of agreement from both Strathellan and Vindt.</p>

  <p>"But at present, as matters stand, we can do nothing, and you as a
  business man must recognize our helplessness in the matter."</p>

  <p>Digby was beside himself with fury as he saw the money being put back in
  the tin box.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he said. His face was pallid and his suppressed rage shook
  him as with an ague. But he never lost sight of all the possible developments
  of the lawyer's action. If he had taken so grave a step in respect to the
  property, he would take action in other directions, and no time must be lost
  if he was to anticipate Salter's next move.</p>

  <p>Without another word he turned on his heel and stalked down the stairs
  into the street. His car was waiting.</p>

  <p>"To the Third National Bank," he said, as he flung himself into its
  luxurious interior.</p>

  <p>He knew that at the Third National Bank was a sum nearly approaching a
  hundred thousand pounds which his parsimonious mother had accumulated during
  the period she had been in receipt of the revenues of the Danton estate.
  Viewing the matter as calmly as he could, he was forced to agree that Salter
  was not the man who would play tricks or employ the machinery of the law,
  unless he had behind him a very substantial backing of facts. Dorothy Danton!
  Where had she sprung from? Who was she? Digby cursed her long and heartily.
  At any rate, he thought, as his car stopped before the bank premises, he
  would be on the safe side and get his hands on all the money which was lying
  loose.</p>

  <p>He wished now that when he had sent Villa to Deauville he had taken his
  mother's money for the purchase of the gambler's yacht. Instead of that he
  had drawn upon the enormous funds of the Thirteen.</p>

  <p>He was shown into the manager's office, and he thought that that gentleman
  greeted him a little coldly.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Mr. Stevens, I have come to draw out the greater part of my
  mother's balance, and I thought I would see you first."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you did, Mr. Groat," was the reply. "Will you sit down?" The
  manager was obviously ill at ease. "The fact is," he confessed, "I am not in
  a position to honour any cheques you draw upon this bank."</p>

  <p>"What the devil do you mean?" demanded Digby.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," said the manager, shrugging his shoulders, "but this morning
  I have been served with a notice that a caveat has been entered at the
  Probate Office, preventing the operation of the Danton will in your mother's
  favour. I have already informed our head office and they are taking legal
  opinion, but as Mr. Salter threatens to obtain immediately an injunction
  unless we agree to comply, it would be madness on my part to let you touch a
  penny of your mother's account. Your own account, of course, you can draw
  upon."</p>

  <p>Digby's own account contained a respectable sum, he remembered.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he said after consideration. "Will you discover my balance
  and I will close the account."</p>

  <p>He was cool now. This was not the moment to hammer his head against a
  brick wall. He needed to meet this cold-blooded old lawyer with cunning and
  foresight. Salter was diabolically wise in the law and had its processes at
  his fingertips, and he must go wanly against the framed fighter or he would
  come to everlasting smash.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the account of the Thirteen was at another bank, and if the
  worst came to the worst - well, he could leave eleven of the Thirteen to make
  the best of things they could.</p>

  <p>The manager returned presently and passed a slip across the table, and a
  few minutes afterwards Digby came back to his car, his pockets bulging with
  bank-notes.</p>

  <p>A tall bearded man stood on the sidewalk as he came out and Digby gave him
  a cursory glance. Detective, he thought, and went cold. Were the police
  already stirring against him, or was this some private watcher of Salter's?
  He decided rightly that it was the latter.</p>

  <p>When he got back to the house he found a telegram waiting. It was from
  Villa. It was short and satisfactory.</p>

  <p>"Bought Pealigo hundred and twelve thousand pounds. Ship on its way to
  Avonmouth. Am bringing captain back by air. Calling Grosvenor nine
  o'clock."</p>

  <p>The frown cleared away from his face as he read the telegram for the
  second time, and as he thought, a smile lit up his yellow face. He was
  thinking of Eunice. The position was not without its compensations.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch32"
     name="ch32"></a>CHAPTER 32</h2>

  <p class="first">EUNICE was sitting in the shuttered room trying to read when
  Digby Groat came in. All the colour left her face as she rose to meet
  him.</p>

  <p>"Good evening. Miss Weldon," he said in his usual manner. "I hope you
  haven't been very bored."</p>

  <p>"Will you please explain why I am kept here a prisoner?" she asked a
  little breathlessly. "You realize that you are committing a very serious
  crime - "</p>

  <p>He laughed in her face.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said almost jovially, "at any rate, Eunice, we can drop the
  mask. That is one blessed satisfaction! These polite little speeches are
  irksome to me as they are to you."</p>

  <p>He took her hand in his.</p>

  <p>"How cold you are, my dear," he said, "yet the room is warm!"</p>

  <p>"When may I leave this house?" she asked in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Leave this house - leave me?" He threw the gloves he had stripped on to a
  chair and caught her by the shoulders. "When are we going? That is a better
  way of putting it. How lovely you are, Eunice!"</p>

  <p>There was no disguise now. The mask was off, as he had said, and the
  ugliness of his black nature was written in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Still she did not resist, standing stiffly erect like a figure of marble.
  Not even when he took her face in both his hands and pressed his lips to
  hers, did she move. She seemed incapable. Something inside her had frozen and
  she could only stare at him.</p>

  <p>"I want you, Eunice! I have wanted you all the time. I chose you out of
  all the women in the world to be mine. I have waited for you, longed for you,
  and now I have you! There is nobody here, Eunice, but you and I. Do you hear,
  darling?"</p>

  <p>Then suddenly a cord snapped within her. With an effort of strength which
  surprised him she thrust him off, her eyes staring in horror as though she
  contemplated some loathsome crawling thing. That look inflamed him. He sprang
  forward, and as he did, the girl in the desperation of frenzy, struck at him;
  twice her open hand came across his face. He stepped back with a yell. Before
  he could reach her she had flown into the bathroom and locked the door. For
  fully five minutes he stood, then he turned and walked slowly across to the
  dressing-table, and surveyed his face in the big mirror.</p>

  <p>"She struck me!" he said. He was as white as a sheet. Against his pale
  face the imprint of her hand showed lividly. "She struck me!" he said again
  wonderingly, and began to laugh.</p>

  <p>For every blow, for every joint on every finger of the hand that struck
  the blow, she should have pain. Pain and terror. She should pray for death,
  she should crawl to him and clasp his feet in her agony. His breath came
  quicker and he wiped the sweat from his forehead with the back of his
  hand.</p>

  <p>He passed out, locking the door behind him. His hand was on the key when
  he heard a sound and looking along the corridor, saw the door of his mother's
  room open and the old woman standing in the doorway.</p>

  <p>"Digby," she said, and there was a vigour and command in her voice which
  made him frown. "I want you!" she said imperatively, and in amazement he
  obeyed her.</p>

  <p>She had gone back to her chair when he came into the room.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Shut the door and sit down."</p>

  <p>He stared at her dumbfounded. Not for a year had she dared address him in
  that tone.</p>

  <p>"What the devil do you mean by ordering me - " he began.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," she said quietly, and then he understood.</p>

  <p>"So, you old devil, the dope is in you!"</p>

  <p>"Sit down, my love child," she sneered. "Sit down, Digby Estremeda! I want
  to speak to you."</p>

  <p>His face went livid.</p>

  <p>"You - you - " he gasped.</p>

  <p>"Sit down. Tell me what you have done with my property."</p>

  <p>He obeyed her slowly, looking at her as though he could not believe the
  evidence of his ears.</p>

  <p>"What have you done with my property?" she asked again. "Like a fool I
  gave you a Power of Attorney. How have you employed it? Have you sold - " she
  was looking at him keenly.</p>

  <p>He was surprised into telling the truth.</p>

  <p>"They have put an embargo - or some such rubbish - on the sale."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I hoped they would," she said. "I hoped they would!"</p>

  <p>"You hoped they would?" he roared, getting up.</p>

  <p>Her imperious hand waved him down again. He passed his hand over his eyes
  like a man in a dream. She was issuing orders; this old woman whom he had
  dominated for years, and he was obeying meekly! He had given her the morphine
  to quieten her, and it had made her his master.</p>

  <p>"Why did they stop the sale?"</p>

  <p>"Because that old lunatic Salter swears that the girl is still alive -
  Dorothy Danton, the baby who was drowned at Margate!"</p>

  <p>He saw a slow smile on her lined face and wondered what was amusing
  her.</p>

  <p>"She is alive!" she said.</p>

  <p>He could only glare at her in speechless amazement.</p>

  <p>"Dorothy Danton alive?" he said. "You're mad, you old fool! She's gone
  beyond recall - dead - dead these twenty years!"</p>

  <p>"And what brought her back to life, I wonder?" mused the old woman? "How
  did they know she was Dorothy? Why, of course you brought her back!" She
  pointed her skinny finger at her son. "You brought her, you are the
  instrument of your own undoing, my boy!" she said derisively. "Oh, you poor
  little fool - you clever fool!"</p>

  <p>Now he had mastered himself.</p>

  <p>"You will tell me all there is to be told, or, by God, you'll be sorry you
  ever spoke at all," he breathed.</p>

  <p>"You marked her. That is why she has been recognized - you marked
  her!"</p>

  <p>"I marked her?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you remember, Digby," she spoke rapidly and seemed to find a joy in
  the hurt she was causing, "a tiny baby and a cruel little beast of a boy who
  heated a sixpence and put it on the baby's wrist?"</p>

  <p>It came back to him instantly. He could almost hear the shriek of his
  victim. A summer day and a big room full of old furniture. The vision of a
  garden through an open window and the sound of the bees...a small spirit-lamp
  where he had heated the coin....</p>

  <p>"My God!" said Digby, reeling back. "I remember!"</p>

  <p>He stared at the mocking face of his mother for a second, then turned and
  left the room. As he did so, there came a sharp rat-tat at the door. Swiftly
  he turned into his own room and ran to the window.</p>

  <p>One glance at the street told him all that he wanted to know. He saw Jim
  and old Salter... there must have been a dozen detectives with them.</p>

  <p>The door would hold for five minutes, and there was time to carry out his
  last plan.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch33"
     name="ch33"></a>CHAPTER 33</h2>

  <p class="first">A MINUTE later he appeared in Eunice Weldon's room. "I want
  you," he said, and there was a sinister look in his eye that made the girl
  cower back from him in fear that she could not master. "My dear," he said
  with that smile of his, "you need not be afraid, your friends are breaking
  into the house and in half an hour you will be free. What I intend doing to
  you is to put you in such a condition that you will not be able to give
  information against me until I am clear of this house. No, I am not going to
  kill you," he almost laughed, "and if you are not sensible enough to realize
  why I am taking this step, then you are a fool - and you are not a fool,
  Eunice."</p>

  <p>She saw something bright and glittering in his hand and terror took
  possession of her.</p>

  <p>"Don't touch me," she gasped. "I swear I will not tell," but he had
  gripped her arm.</p>

  <p>"If you make a sound," his face was thrust into hers, "you'll regret it to
  the last day of your life."</p>

  <p>She felt a sudden pricking sensation in her arm and tried to pull it away,
  but her arm was held as by a vice.</p>

  <p>"There. It wasn't very painful, was it?"</p>

  <p>She heard him utter a curse, and when he turned his face was red with
  rage.</p>

  <p>"They've smashed in the gates," he said sharply.</p>

  <p>She was walking toward him, her hand on the little puncture the needle had
  made, and her face was curiously calm.</p>

  <p>"Are you going now?" she asked simply.</p>

  <p>"We are going in a few minutes," said Digby, emphasizing the "we."</p>

  <p>But even this she did not resent. She had fallen into a curious placid
  condition of mind which was characterized by the difficulty, amounting to an
  impossibility, of remembering what happened the previous minute. All she
  could do was to sit down on the edge of a chair, nursing her arm. She knew it
  hurt her, and yet she was conscious of no hurt. It was a curious impersonal
  sensation she had. To her, Digby Groat had no significance. He was a somebody
  whom she neither liked nor disliked. It was all very strange and
  pleasant.</p>

  <p>"Put your hat on," he said, and she obeyed. She never dreamt of
  disobeying.</p>

  <p>He led her to the basement and through a door which communicated with a
  garage. It was not the garage where he kept his own car - Jim had often been
  puzzled to explain why Digby kept his car so far from the house. The only car
  visible was a covered van, such as the average tradesman uses to deliver his
  goods.</p>

  <p>"Get in," said Digby, and Eunice obeyed with a strange smile.</p>

  <p>She was under the influence of that admixture of morphine and hyacin,
  which destroyed all memory and will.</p>

  <p>"Sit on the floor," he ordered, and laced the canvas flap at the back. He
  reached under the driver's seat and pulled out a cotton coat which had once
  been white, but was now disfigured with paint and grease, buttoning it up to
  the throat. A cap he took from the same source and pulled it over his head,
  so that the peak well covered his eyes.</p>

  <p>Then he opened the gates of a garage. He was in a mews, and with the
  exception of a woman who was talking to a milkman, the only two persons in
  sight, none saw the van emerge.</p>

  <p>There was not the slightest suspicion of hurry on his part. He descended
  from his seat to close the gates and lock them, lit a pipe and, clambering
  up, set the little van going in the direction of the Bayswater Road.</p>

  <p>He stopped only at the petrol station to take aboard a fair supply of
  spirit, and then he went on, still at a leisurely pace, passing through the
  outlying suburbs, until he came to the long road leading from Staines to
  Ascot. Here he stopped and got down.</p>

  <p>Taking the little flat case from his pocket, and recharging the glass
  cylinder, he opened the canvas flap at the back and looked in.</p>

  <p>Eunice was sitting with her back braced against the side of the van, her
  head nodding sleepily. She looked up with a puzzled expression.</p>

  <p>"It won't hurt you," said Digby. Again the needle went into her arm, and
  the piston was thrust home.</p>

  <p>She screwed up her face a little at the pain and again fondled her
  arm.</p>

  <p>"That hurt," she said simply.</p>

  <p>Just outside Ascot a touring car was held up by two policemen and Digby
  slowed from necessity, for the car had left him no room to pass.</p>

  <p>"We are looking for a man and a girl," said one of the policemen to the
  occupants of the car. "All right, sir, go on."</p>

  <p>Digby nodded in a friendly way to the policeman.</p>

  <p>"Is it all right, sergeant?"</p>

  <p>"Off you go," said the sergeant, not troubling to look inside a van on
  which was painted the name of a reputable firm of London furnishers.</p>

  <p>Digby breathed quickly. He must not risk another encounter. There would be
  a second barrier at the cross roads, where he intended turning. He must go
  back to London, he thought, the police would not stop a London-bound car. He
  turned into a secondary road and reached the main Bath road passing another
  barrier, where, as he had expected, the police did not challenge him, though
  they were holding up a string of vehicles going in the other direction. There
  were half a dozen places to which he could take her, but the safest was a
  garage he had hired at the back of a block of buildings in Paddington. The
  garage had been useful to the Thirteen, but had not been utilized for the
  greater part of a year, though he had sent Jackson frequently to superintend
  the cleaning.</p>

  <p>He gained the west of London as the rain began to fall. Everything was in
  his favour. The mews in which the garage was situated was deserted and he had
  opened the gates and backed in the car before the occupants of the next
  garage were curious enough to come out to see who it was.</p>

  <p>Digby had one fad and it had served him well before. It was to be
  invaluable now. Years before, he had insisted that every house and every
  room, if it were only a store-room, should have a lock of such a character
  that it should open to his master key.</p>

  <p>He half led, half lifted the girl from the car, and she sighed wearily,
  for she was stiff and tired.</p>

  <p>"This way," he said, and pushed her before him up the dark stairs, keeping
  her on the landing whilst he lit the gas.</p>

  <p>Though it had not been dusted for the best part of a month, the room
  overlooking the mews was neat and comfortably furnished. He pulled down the
  heavy blind before he lit the gas here, felt her pulse and looked into her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"You'll do, I think," he said with a smile. "You must wait here until I
  come back. I am going to get some food."</p>

  <p>"Yes," she answered.</p>

  <p>He was gone twenty minutes, and on his return he saw that she had taken
  off her coat and had washed her hands and face. She was listlessly drying her
  hands when he came up the stairs. There was something pathetically childlike
  in her attitude, and a man who was less of a brute than Digby Groat would
  have succumbed to the appeal of her helplessness.</p>

  <p>But there was no hint of pity in the thoughtful eyes that surveyed her. He
  was wondering whether it would be safe to give her another dose. In order to
  secure a quick effect he had administered more than was safe already. There
  might be a collapse, or a failure of heart, which would be as fatal to him as
  to her. He decided to wait until the effects had almost worn off.</p>

  <p>"Eat," he said, and she sat at the table obediently.</p>

  <p>He had brought in cold meat, a loaf of bread, butter and cheese. He
  supplemented this feast with two glasses of water which he drew in the little
  scullery.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she put down her knife and fork.</p>

  <p>"I feel very tired," she said.</p>

  <p>So much the better, thought Digby. She would sleep now.</p>

  <p>The back room was a bedroom. He watched her whilst she unfastened her
  shoes and loosened the belt of her skirt before she lay down. With a sigh,
  she turned over and was fast asleep before he could walk to the other side of
  the bed to see her face.</p>

  <p>Digby Groat smoked for a long time over his simple meal. The girl was
  wholly in his power, but she could wait. A much more vital matter absorbed
  his attention. He himself had reached the possibility which he had long
  foreseen and provided against. It was not a pleasant situation, he thought,
  and found relief for his mind by concentrating his thoughts upon the lovely
  ranch in Brazil, on which, with average luck, he would spend the remainder of
  his days.</p>

  <p>Presently he got up, produced from a drawer a set of shaving materials
  wrapped in a towel, and heating some water at the little gas-stove in the
  kitchen, he proceeded to divest himself of his moustache.</p>

  <p>With the master key he unlocked the cupboard that ran the height of the
  room, and surveyed thoughtfully the stacks of dresses and costumes which
  filled the half a dozen shelves. The two top shelves were filled with boxes,
  and he brought out three of these and examined their contents. From one of
  these he took a beautiful evening gown of silver tissue, and laid it over the
  back of a chair. A satin wrap followed, and from another box he took white
  satin shoes and stockings and seemed satisfied by his choice, for he looked
  at them for a long time before he folded them and put them back where he had
  found them. His own disguise he had decided upon.</p>

  <p>And now, having mapped out his plan, he dressed himself in a chauffeur's
  uniform, and went out to the telephone.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch34"
     name="ch34"></a>CHAPTER 34</h2>

  <p class="first">"DEAD! Jane Groat dead?"</p>

  <p>To Lady Mary the news came as a shock.</p>

  <p>Jim, gaunt and hollow-eyed, sitting listlessly by the window of Mr.
  Salter's office, nodded.</p>

  <p>"The doctors think it was an overdose of morphia that killed her," he said
  shortly.</p>

  <p>Lady Mary was silent for a long while, then;</p>

  <p>"I think perhaps now is a moment when I can tell you something about the
  Blue Hand," she said.</p>

  <p>"Will it assist us?" asked Jim, turning quickly.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid it will not, but this I must tell you. The person against
  whom the Blue Hand was directed was not Digby Groat, but his mother. I have
  made one grave mistake recently," she said, "and it was to believe that Digby
  Groat was dominated by his mother. I was amazed to discover that so far from
  her dominating him, she was his slave, and the only explanation I can give
  for this extraordinary transition is Digby Groat's discovery that his mother
  was a drug-taker. Once he was strong enough to keep the drug from her the
  positions were reversed. The story of the Blue Hand," she said with her sad
  little smile, "is neither as fantastic nor as melodramatic as you might
  expect."</p>

  <p>There was a long silence which neither of the men broke.</p>

  <p>"I was married at a very early age, as you know." She nodded to Salter.
  "My father was a very poor nobleman with one daughter and no sons, and he
  found it not only difficult to keep up the mortgaged estates which he had
  inherited, but to make both ends meet even though he was living in the most
  modest way. Then he met Jonathan Danton's father, and between the two they
  fixed up a marriage between myself and Jonathan. I never met him until a week
  before my wedding-day. He was a cold, hard man, very much like his father,
  just to a fault, proud and stiff-necked, and to his natural hardness of
  demeanour was added the fretfulness due to an affected heart, which
  eventually killed him.</p>

  <p>"My married life was an unhappy one. The sympathy that I sought was denied
  me. With all his wealth he could have made me happy, but from the first he
  seemed to be suspicious of me, and I have often thought that he hated me
  because I was a member of a class which he professed to despise. When our
  daughter was born I imagined that there would be a change in his attitude,
  but, if anything, the change was for the worse.</p>

  <p>"I had met his sister, Jane Groat, and knew, in a vague kind of way, that
  some scandal had attached to her name - Jonathan never discussed it, but his
  father, in his lifetime, loathed Jane and would not allow her to put her foot
  inside his house. Jonathan hadn't the same prejudices. He knew nothing of her
  escapade with the Spaniard, Estremeda, and I only learnt of the circumstances
  by accident.</p>

  <p>"Jane was a peculiar mixture. Some days she would be bright and vivacious,
  and some days she would be in the depths of gloom, and this used to puzzle
  me, until one day we were at tea together at our house in Park Lane. She had
  come in a state of nerves and irritability which distressed me. I thought
  that her little boy was giving her trouble, for I knew how difficult he was,
  and how his cruel ways, even at that tender age, annoyed her. I nearly said
  distressed her," she smiled, "but Jane was never distressed at things like
  that. We were having a cup of tea when she put her hand in her bag and took
  out a small bottle filled with brown pellets.</p>

  <p>"'I really can't wait any longer, Mary,' she said, and swallowed one of
  the pills. I thought it was something for digestion, until I saw her eyes
  begin to brighten and her whole demeanour change, then I guessed the
  truth.</p>

  <p>"'You're not taking drugs, are you, Jane? 'I asked.</p>

  <p>"'I'm taking a little morphine,' she replied. 'Don't be shocked, Mary. If
  you had my troubles, and a little devil of a boy to look after, as I have,
  you'd take drugs too!'</p>

  <p>"But that was not her worst weakness, from my point of view. What that was
  I learnt after my husband sailed to America on business.</p>

  <p>"Dorothy was then about seven or eight months old, a bonny, healthy,
  beautiful child, whom my husband adored in his cold, dour fashion. One
  morning Jane came into my room while I was dressing, and apologizing for her
  early arrival, asked me if I would go shopping with her. She was so cheerful
  and gay that I knew she had been swallowing some of those little pellets, and
  as I was at a loose end that morning I agreed. We went to several stores and
  finished up at Clayneys, the big emporium in Brompton Road. I noticed that
  Jane made very few purchases, but this didn't strike me as being peculiar,
  because Jane was notoriously mean, and I don't think she had a great deal of
  money either. I did not know Clayneys. I had never been to the shop before.
  This explanation is necessary in view of what followed. Suddenly, when we
  were passing through the silk department, Jane turned to me with a startled
  expression and said to me under her breath, 'Put this somewhere.'</p>

  <p>"Before I could expostulate, she had thrust something into the interior of
  my muff. It was a cold day and I was carrying one of those big pillow muffs
  which were so fashionable in that year. I had hardly done so before somebody
  tapped me on the shoulder. I turned to see a respectable-looking man who said
  sharply, 'I'll trouble you to accompany me to the manager's office.'</p>

  <p>"I was dazed and bewildered, and the only thing I recollect was Jane
  whispering in my ear, 'Don't give your name.' She apparently was suspect as
  well, for we were both taken to a large office, where an elderly man
  interviewed us. 'What is your name?' he asked. The first name I could think
  of was my maid, Madge Benson. Of course, I was half mad. I should have told
  them that I was Lady Mary Danton and should have betrayed Jane upon the spot.
  My muff was searched and inside was found a large square of silk, which was
  the article Jane had put into it.</p>

  <p>"The elderly man retired with his companion to a corner of the room and I
  turned to Jane. 'You must get me out of this; it is disgraceful of you, Jane.
  Whatever made you do it?'</p>

  <p>"'For God's sake, don't say a word,' she whispered. 'Whatever happens, I
  will take the responsibility. The magistrate - '</p>

  <p>"'The magistrate?' I said in horror. 'I shall not go before a
  magistrate?'</p>

  <p>"'You must, you must; it would break Jonathan's heart, and he would blame
  you if I came into court. Quick.' She lowered her voice and began speaking
  rapidly. 'I know the magistrate at Paddington and I will go to him and make a
  confession of the whole thing. When you come up to-morrow you will be
  discharged. Mary, you must do this for me, you must!'</p>

  <p>"To cut a long story short, the manager came back and, summoning a
  policeman, gave me into custody. I neither denied my crime nor in any way
  implicated Jane. I found afterwards that she explained to the proprietor that
  she was a distant relation of mine and she had met me in the shop by
  accident. How can I depict the horror of that night spent in a police-court
  cell? In my folly I even thanked God that my name had not been given. The
  next morning I came before the magistrate, and did not doubt that Jane had
  kept her word. There was nobody in the court who knew me. I was brought up
  under the name of Madge Benson and the elderly man from Clayneys went into
  the witness-box and made his statement. He said that his firm had been losing
  considerable quantities through shop-lifting, and that he had every reason to
  believe I was an old hand.</p>

  <p>"Humiliating as this experience was, I did not for one moment doubt that
  the magistrate would find some excuse for me and discharge me. The shame of
  that moment as I stood there in the dock, with the curious crowd sneering at
  me! I cannot even speak of it to-day without my cheeks burning. The
  magistrate listened in silence, and presently he looked at me over his
  glasses and I waited.</p>

  <p>"'There has been too much of this sort of thing going on,' said he, 'and I
  am going to make an example of you. You will go to prison with hard labour
  for one month.'</p>

  <p>"The court, the magistrate, the people, everything and everybody seemed to
  fade out, and when I came to myself I was sitting in a cell with the jailer's
  wife forcing water between my teeth. Jane had betrayed me. She had lied when
  she said she would go to the magistrate, but her greatest crime had yet to be
  committed.</p>

  <p>"I had been a fortnight in Holloway Gaol when she came to visit me. I was
  not a strong woman and they put me to work with several other prisoners in a
  shed where the prison authorities were making experiments with dyes. You
  probably don't know much about prisons," she said, "but in every county gaol
  through England they make an attempt to keep the prisoners occupied with some
  one trade. In Maidstone the printing is done for all the prisons in England -
  I learnt a lot about things when I was inside Holloway! In Shepton Mallet the
  prisoners weave. In Exeter they make harness. In Manchester they weave
  cotton, and so on.</p>

  <p>"The Government were thinking of making one of the prisons a dye-works.
  When I came to the little interview-room to see Jane Groat, I had forgotten
  the work that had stained both my hands, and it was not until I saw her
  starting at the hands gripping the bars that I realized that the prison had
  placed upon me a mark which only time would eradicate.</p>

  <p>"'May, look!' she stammered. 'Your hands are blue!'</p>

  <p>"My hands were blue," said Lady Mary bitterly. "The Blue Hand became the
  symbol of the injustice this woman had worked.</p>

  <p>"I did not reproach her. I was too depressed, too broken to taunt her with
  her meanness and treachery. But she promised eagerly that she would tell my
  husband the truth, and told me that the baby was being taken care of, and
  that she had sent it with her own maid to Margate. She would have kept the
  baby at her own house, she said, and probably with truth, but she feared the
  people, seeing the baby, would wonder where I was. If the baby was out of
  town, I too might be out of town.</p>

  <p>"And then occurred that terrible accident that sent, as I believed, my
  darling baby to a horrible death. Jane Groat saw the advantage which the
  death gave to her. She had discovered in some underhand fashion the terms of
  my husband's will, terms which were unknown to me at the time. The moment
  Dorothy was gone she went to him with the story that I had been arrested and
  convicted for shop-lifting, and that the baby, whom it was my business to
  guard, had been left to the neglectful care of a servant and was dead.</p>

  <p>"The shock killed Jonathan. He was found dead in his study after his
  sister had left him. The day before I came out of prison I received a note
  from Jane telling me boldly what had happened. She made no attempt to break
  to me gently the news of my darling baby's death. The whole letter was
  designed to produce on me the fatal effect that her news had produced on poor
  Jonathan. Happily I had some money and the property in the City, which my
  husband, in a moment of generosity, which I am sure he never ceased to
  regret, had given to me. At my father's suggestion I turned this into a
  limited liability company, the shares of which were held, and are still held,
  by my father's lawyer.</p>

  <p>"Soon after my release my father inherited a considerable fortune, which
  on his death came to me. With that money I have searched the world for news
  of Dorothy, news which has always evaded me. The doubt in my mind as to
  whether Dorothy was dead or not concentrated on my mistrust of Jane. I
  believed, wrongly, as I discovered, that Jane knew my girlie was alive. The
  Blue Hand was designed to terrorize her into a confession. As it happened, it
  only terrorized the one person in the world I desired to meet - my
  daughter!"</p>

  <p>Salter had listened in silence to the recital of this strange story which
  Lady Mary had to tell.</p>

  <p>"That clears up the last mystery," he said.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch35"
     name="ch35"></a>CHAPTER 35</h2>

  <p class="first">EUNICE woke and, opening her eyes, tried hard to remember
  what had happened. Her last clear recollection was of her room in Grosvenor
  Square. The last person - she shivered as she recalled the moment - was Digby
  Groat, and he was coming towards her - she sat up in bed and reeled with the
  pain in her head. Where was she? She looked round. The room was meanly
  furnished, a heavy green blind had been drawn over the small window, but
  there was enough light in the room to reveal the shabby wardrobe, the common
  iron bed on which she lay, the cheap washstand and the threadbare carpet that
  covered the floor.</p>

  <p>She was fully dressed and feeling horribly grimy. She almost wished at
  that moment she was back in Grosvenor Square, with its luxurious bathroom and
  its stinging shower-baths.</p>

  <p>But where was she? She got off the bed, and, staggering across the room,
  she pulled aside the blind. She looked out upon the backs of drab buildings.
  She was in London, then. Only London could provide that view. She tried to
  open the door - it was locked, and as she turned the handle she heard
  footsteps outside.</p>

  <p>"Good morning," said Digby Groat, unlocking the door.</p>

  <p>At first she did not recognize him in his chauffeur uniform and without
  his moustache.</p>

  <p>"You?" she said in horror. "Where am I? Why have you brought me here?"</p>

  <p>"If I told you where you were you would be no wiser," said Digby coolly.
  "And the reason you are with me must be fairly obvious. Be sensible and have
  some breakfast."</p>

  <p>He was looking at her with a keen professional eye. The effect of the drug
  had not worn off, he noticed, and she was not likely to give him a great deal
  of trouble.</p>

  <p>Her throat was parched and she was ravenously hungry. She sipped at the
  coffee he had made, and all the time her eyes did not leave his.</p>

  <p>"I'll make a clean breast of it," he said suddenly. "The fact is, I have
  got into very serious trouble and it is necessary that I should get
  away."</p>

  <p>"From Grosvenor Square?" She opened her eyes wide in astonishment. "Aren't
  you going back to Grosvenor Square?"</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"It is hardly likely," he said sarcastically. "Your friend Steele - "</p>

  <p>"Is he there?" she cried eagerly, clasping her hands. "Oh, tell me,
  please."</p>

  <p>"If you expect me to sing your lover's praises you're going to get a jar!"
  said Digby, without heat. "Now eat some food and shut up." His tone was quiet
  but menacing, and she thought it best not to irritate him.</p>

  <p>She was only beginning to understand her own position. Digby had run away
  and taken her with him. Why did she go? she wondered. He must have drugged
  her! And yet - she remembered the hypodermic syringe and instinctively rubbed
  her arm.</p>

  <p>Digby saw the gesture and could almost read her thoughts. How lovely she
  was, he mused. No other woman in the world, after her experience of
  yesterday, could face the cold morning clear-eyed and flawless as she did.
  The early light was always kind to her, he remembered. The brightness of her
  soft eyes was undiminished, untarnished was the clarity of her complexion.
  She was a thing of delight, a joy to the eye, even of this connoisseur of
  beauty, who was not easily moved by mere loveliness.</p>

  <p>"Eunice," he said, "I am going to marry you."</p>

  <p>"Marry me," she said, startled. "Of course, you will do nothing of the
  kind, Mr. Groat. I don't want to marry you."</p>

  <p>"That is quite unimportant," said Digby, and leaning forward over the
  table, he lowered his voice. "Eunice, do you realize what I am offering you
  and the alternative?"</p>

  <p>"I will not marry you," she answered steadily, "and no threat you make
  will change my mind."</p>

  <p>His eyes did not leave hers.</p>

  <p>"Do you realize that I can make you glad to marry me," he said, choosing
  his words deliberately, "and that I will stop at nothing - nothing?"</p>

  <p>She made no reply, but he saw her colour change.</p>

  <p>"Now understand me, my dear, once and for all. It is absolutely necessary
  that I should marry you, and you can either agree to a ceremony or you can
  take the consequence, and you know what that consequence will be."</p>

  <p>She had risen to her feet and was looking down at him, and in her eyes was
  a contempt which would have wilted any other man than he.</p>

  <p>"I am in your power," she said quietly, "and you must do what you will,
  but consciously I will never marry you. You were able to drug me yesterday,
  so that I cannot remember what happened between my leaving your house and my
  arrival in this wretched place, and possibly you can produce a similar
  condition, but sooner or later, Digby Groat, you will pay for all the wrong
  that you have done to the world. If I am amongst the injured people who will
  be avenged, that is God's will."</p>

  <p>She turned to leave the room, but he was at the door before her and pulled
  her arm violently towards him.</p>

  <p>"If you scream," he said, "I will choke the life out of you."</p>

  <p>She looked at him with contempt.</p>

  <p>"I shall not scream."</p>

  <p>Nor did she even wince when the bright needle passed under the skin of her
  forearm.</p>

  <p>"If anything happens to me," she said in a voice scarcely above a whisper,
  "I will kill myself in your presence, and with some weapon of yours." Her
  voice faded away and he watched her.</p>

  <p>For the first time, he was afraid. She had touched him on a sensitive
  point - his own personal safety. She knew. What had put that idea into her
  head? he wondered, as he watched the colour come and go under the influence
  of the drug? And she would do it! He sweated at the thought. She might have
  done it here, and he could never have explained his innocence of her
  murder.</p>

  <p>"Phew!" said Digby Groat, and wiped his forehead.</p>

  <p>Presently, he let her hand drop and guided her to a chair.</p>

  <p>Again, her hand touched her arm, tenderly, and then:</p>

  <p>"Get up," said Digby, and she obeyed. "Now go to your room and stay there
  until I tell you I want you."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch36"
     name="ch36"></a>CHAPTER 36</h2>

  <p class="first">THAT afternoon he had a visitor. He was, apparently, a
  gentleman who was anxious to rent a garage, and he made one or two inquiries
  in the mews before he called at Digby Groat's temporary home. Those people
  who troubled to observe him, noticed that he stayed a considerable time
  within this garage, and when he came out he seemed satisfied with his
  negotiations. He was in truth Villa, who had come in answer to an urgent
  wire.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Digby, "is everything ready?"</p>

  <p>"Everything is ready, dear friend," said Villa amiably. "I have the three
  men you want. Bronson is one, Fuentes and Silva are the others; they are
  known to you?"</p>

  <p>Digby nodded. Bronson was an army aviator who had left the service under a
  cloud. Digby had employed him once before, to carry him to Paris - Bronson
  ran a passenger carrying service which Digby had financed. The other two he
  knew as associates of Villa - Villa had queer friends.</p>

  <p>"Bronson will be in a field just outside Rugby. I told him to pretend he
  had made a false landing."</p>

  <p>"Good," said Digby. "Now you understand that I shall be travelling north
  in the disguise of an old woman. A car must be waiting a mile short of the
  station and Fuentes must reach the line with a red hand-lamp and signal the
  train to stop. When it stops he can clear and by that time I shall be well
  away. I know Rugby well and this sketch-map will tell you everything." He
  handed a sheet of paper to Villa. "The car must be waiting at the end of the
  lane marked B. on the plan - the house - is it in good condition?"</p>

  <p>"There's a house on the property," said Villa, "but it is rather a
  tumbledown affair."</p>

  <p>"It can't be worse than Kennett Hall," said Digby. "That will do
  splendidly. You can keep the girl there all night and bring her to Kennett
  Hall in the morning. I will be there to receive you. To-morrow afternoon,
  just before sundown, we will take our final flight to the sea."</p>

  <p>"What about Bronson?"</p>

  <p>"Bronson will have to be settled with," said Digby, "but you can leave
  that to me."</p>

  <p>He had his own views about Bronson which it was not expedient at the
  moment to discuss.</p>

  <p>"How are you going to get to the Hall?" asked the interested Villa.</p>

  <p>"You can leave that to me also," said Digby with a frown. "Why are you so
  curious? I will tell you this much, that I intend taking on the car and
  travelling through the night."</p>

  <p>"Why not take the girl by the car?" demanded the persistent Villa.</p>

  <p>"Because I want her to arrive at Kennett Hall by the only way that is
  safe. If the Hall is being watched, there is a chance of getting away again
  before they close in on us. No, I will be there before daybreak, and make a
  reconnaissance. In a case like this, I can trust nobody but myself, and what
  is more, Villa, I know the people who are watching me. Now, do you
  understand?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly, my friend," said Villa jovially; "as to that little matter of
  sharing out - "</p>

  <p>"The money is here," said Digby, tapping his waist, "and you will have no
  cause to complain. There is much to be done yet - we have not seen the worst
  of our adventures."</p>

  <p>For Eunice Weldon the worst was, for the moment, a splitting headache
  which made it an agony to lift her head from the pillow. She seemed to have
  passed through the day in a condition which was neither wakefulness nor
  sleep. She tried to remember what had happened and where she was, but the
  effort was so painful that she was content to lie with her throbbing head,
  glad that she was left alone. Several times the thought of Digby Groat came
  through her mind, but he was so inexplicably confused with Jim Steele that
  she could not separate the two personalities.</p>

  <p>Where she was she neither knew nor cared. She was lying down and she was
  quiet - that satisfied her. Once she was conscious of a sharp stinging
  sensation in her right arm, and soon after she must have gone to sleep again,
  only to wake with her head racked with shooting pains as though somebody was
  driving red-hot nails into her brain.</p>

  <p>At last it became so unendurable that she groaned, and a voice near her -
  an anxious voice, she thought - said;</p>

  <p>"Have you any pain?"</p>

  <p>"My head," she murmured. "It is dreadful!"</p>

  <p>She was conscious of a "tut" of impatience, and almost immediately
  afterwards somebody's arm was round her neck and a glass was held to her
  lips.</p>

  <p>"Drink this," said the voice.</p>

  <p>She swallowed a bitter draught and made a grimace of distaste.</p>

  <p>"That was nasty," she said.</p>

  <p>"Don't talk," said the voice. Digby was seriously alarmed at the condition
  in which he found her when he had returned from a visit of reconnaissance.
  Her colour was bad, her breathing difficult and her pulse almost
  imperceptible. He had feared this, and yet he must continue his
  "treatment."</p>

  <p>He looked down at her frowningly and felt some satisfaction when he saw
  the colour creep back to the wax-like face, and felt the throb of the pulse
  under his fingers.</p>

  <p>As to Eunice, the sudden release from pain which came almost immediately
  after she had taken the draught, was so heavenly that she would have been on
  her knees in gratitude to the man who had accomplished the miracle, and with
  relief from pain came sleep.</p>

  <p>Digby heaved a sigh of relief and went back to his work. It was very
  pleasant work for him, for the table was covered with little packages of five
  thousand dollar gold bills, for he had been successful in drawing the funds
  of the Thirteen and exchanging them for American money. He did not want to
  find himself in Brazil with a wad of English notes which he could not change
  because the numbers had been notified.</p>

  <p>His work finished, he strapped the belt about his waist and proceeded
  leisurely to prepare for the journey. A grey wig changed the appearance of
  his face, but he was not relying upon that disguise. Locking the door, he
  stripped himself of his clothes and began to dress deliberately and
  carefully.</p>

  <p>It was nearly eight o'clock that night when Eunice returned to
  consciousness. Beyond an unquenchable thirst, she felt no distress. The room
  was dimly illuminated by a small oil-lamp that stood on the washstand, and
  the first thing that attracted her eye, after she had drunk long and eagerly
  from the glass of water that stood on the table by the side of the bed, was a
  beautiful evening dress of silver tissue which hung over the back of the
  chair. Then she saw pinned to the side of the pillow a card. It was not
  exactly the same shade of grey that Digby and she had received in the early
  stages of their acquaintance. Digby had failed to find the right colour in
  his search at the local stationers, but he had very carefully imitated the
  pen-print with which the mysterious woman in black had communicated her
  warnings, and the girl reading at first without understanding and then with a
  wildly beating heart, the message of the card saw her safely assured.</p>

  <p>"Dress in the clothes you will find here, and if you obey me without
  question I will save you from an ignominious fate. I will call for you but
  you must not speak to me. We are going to the north in order to escape Digby
  Groat."</p>

  <p>The message was signed with a rough drawing of the Blue Hand.</p>

  <p>She was trembling in every limb, for now the events of the past few days
  were slowly looming through the fog with which the drugs had clouded her
  brain. She was in the power of Digby Groat, and the mysterious woman in black
  was coming to her rescue. It did not seem possible. She stood up and almost
  collapsed, for her head was humming and her knees seemed incapable of
  sustaining her weight. She held on to the head of the bedstead for several
  minutes before she dared begin to dress.</p>

  <p>She forgot her raging thirst, almost forgot her weakness, as with
  trembling hands she fastened the beautiful dress about her and slipped on the
  silk stockings and satin shoes. Why did the mysterious woman in black choose
  this conspicuous dress? she wondered, if she feared that Digby Groat would be
  watching for her? She could not think consecutively. She must trust her
  rescuer blindly, she thought. She did her hair before the tiny mirror and was
  shocked to see her face. About her eyes were great dark circles; she had the
  appearance of one who was in a wasting sickness.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad Jim can't see you, Eunice Weldon," she said, and the thought of
  Jim acted as a tonic and a spur.</p>

  <p>Her man! How she had hurt him. She stopped suddenly in the act of brushing
  her hair. She remembered their last interview. Jim said she was the daughter
  of Lady Mary Danton! It couldn't be true, and yet Jim had said it, and that
  gave it authority beyond question. She stared at her reflection, and then the
  effort of thought made her head whirl again and she sat down.</p>

  <p>"I mustn't think, I mustn't think," she muttered, and yet thoughts and
  doubts, questions and speculations, crowded in upon her. Lady Mary Danton was
  her mother! She was the woman who had come into Jim's flat. There was a tap
  at the door and she started. Was it Digby Groat? Digby who had brought her
  here?</p>

  <p>"Come in," she said faintly.</p>

  <p>The door opened but the visitor did not enter, and she saw, standing on
  the little landing, a woman in black, heavily veiled, who beckoned to her to
  follow. She rose unsteadily and moved towards her.</p>

  <p>"Where are we going?" she asked, and then, "Thank you, thank you a
  thousand times, for all you are doing for me!"</p>

  <p>The woman made no reply, but walked down the stairs, and Eunice went after
  her.</p>

  <p>It was a dark night; rain was falling heavily and the mews was deserted
  except for the taxi-cab which was drawn up at the door. The woman opened the
  door of the cab and followed Eunice into its dark interior.</p>

  <p>"You must not ask questions," she whispered. "There is a hood to your
  coat. Pull it over your head."</p>

  <p>What did it mean? Eunice wondered.</p>

  <p>She was safe, but why were they going out of London? Perhaps Jim awaited
  her at the end of the journey and the danger was greater than she had
  imagined. Whither had Digby Groat gone, and how had this mysterious woman in
  black got him out of the way? She put her hand to her head. She must wait.
  She must have patience. All would be revealed to her in good time - and she
  would see Jim!</p>

  <p>The two people who were interested in the departure of the
  eleven-forty-five train for the north, did not think it was unusual to see a
  girl in evening dress, accompanied by a woman in mourning, take their places
  in a reserved compartment. It was a train very popular with those visitors to
  London who wanted to see a theatre before they left, and the detective who
  was watching on the departure platform, scrutinizing every man who was
  accompanied by a woman, gave no attention to the girl in evening dress and,
  as they thought, her mother. Perhaps if she had not been so attired, they
  might have looked more closely - Digby Groat was a great student of human
  nature.</p>

  <p>Lady Mary, in her restlessness, had come to Euston to supplement the watch
  of the detectives, and had passed every carriage and its occupants under
  review just before Eunice had taken her seat.</p>

  <p>"Sit in the corner," whispered the "woman," "and do not look at the
  platform. I am afraid Groat will be on the look-out for me."</p>

  <p>The girl obeyed and Lady Mary, walking back, seeing the young girl in
  evening dress, whose face was hidden from her, never dreamt of making any
  closer inspection. The detective strolled along the platform with her towards
  the entrance.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid there will be no more trains to-night, my lady," said the
  bearded officer, and she nodded. "I should think they've left by
  motor-car."</p>

  <p>"Every road is watched now," said Lady Mary quietly, "and it is impossible
  for them to get out of London by road."</p>

  <p>At the moment the train, with a shrill whistle, began to move slowly out
  of the station.</p>

  <p>"May I look now?" said Eunice, and the "woman" in black nodded.</p>

  <p>Eunice turned her head to the platform and then with a cry, started
  up.</p>

  <p>"Why, why," she cried wildly, "there is Mrs. Fane - Lady Mary, my
  mother!"</p>

  <p>Another instant, and she was dragged back to her seat, and a hateful voice
  hissed in her ear; "Sit down!" The "woman" in black snapped down the blind
  and raised "her" veil. But Eunice knew that it was Digby Groat before she saw
  the yellow face of the man.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch37"
     name="ch37"></a>CHAPTER 37</h2>

  <p class="first">THE recognition had been mutual. Lady Mary had seen that
  white face, those staring eyes, for a second, and then the train had rolled
  quickly past her, leaving her momentarily paralysed.</p>

  <p>"There, there!" she gasped, pointing. "Stop the train!"</p>

  <p>The detective looked round. There was no official in sight, and he tore
  back to the barriers, followed by Lady Mary. He could discover nobody with
  authority to act.</p>

  <p>"I'll find the station-master," he cried. "Can you telephone
  anywhere?"</p>

  <p>There was a telephone booth within a few yards and her first thought was
  of Jim.</p>

  <p>Jim was sitting in his room, his head in his hands, when the telephone
  bell rang, and he went listlessly to answer the call. It was Lady Mary
  speaking.</p>

  <p>"Eunice is on the northern train that has just left the station," she
  said, speaking rapidly. "We are trying to stop it at Willesden, but I am
  afraid it will be impossible. Oh, for God's sake do something, Jim!"</p>

  <p>"On the northern train?" he gasped. "How long has it left?"</p>

  <p>"A few seconds ago...."</p>

  <p>He dropped the receiver, threw open the door and ran downstairs. In that
  moment his decision had been taken. Like a flash there had come back to his
  mind a sunny afternoon when, with Eunice at his side, he had watched a daring
  little boy pulling himself across the lines by the telegraph wire which
  crossed the railway from one side to the other. He darted into the courtyard
  and as he mounted the wall he beard the rumble and roar of the train in the
  tunnel.</p>

  <p>It would be moving slowly because the gradient was a stiff one. From which
  tunnel would it emerge? There were two black openings and it might be from
  either. He must risk that, he thought, and reaching up for a telegraph wire,
  swung himself over the coping. The wires would be strong enough to hold a
  boy. Would they support him? He felt them sagging and heard an ominous creak
  from the post which was in the courtyard, but he must risk that too. Hand
  over hand he went, and presently he saw with consternation the gleam of a
  light from the farther tunnel. In frantic haste he pulled himself across.
  There was no time for caution. The engine, labouring heavily, had passed
  before he came above the line. Now he was over the white-topped carriages,
  and his legs were curled up to avoid contact with them. He let go and dropped
  on his foot. The movement of the carriage threw him down and he all but fell
  over the side, but gripping to a ventilator, he managed to scramble to his
  knees.</p>

  <p>As he did so he saw the danger ahead. The train was running into a second
  tunnel. He had only time to throw himself flat on the carriage, before he was
  all but suffocated by the sulphur fumes which filled the tunnel. He was on
  the right train, he was certain of that, as he lay gasping and coughing, but
  it would need all his strength to hold himself in position when the driver
  began to work up speed.</p>

  <p>He realized, when they came out again into the open, that it was raining,
  and raining, heavily. In a few minutes he was wet through, but he clung
  grimly to his perilous hold. Would Lady Mary succeed in stopping the train at
  Willesden? The answer came when they flashed through that junction, gathering
  speed at every minute.</p>

  <p>The carriages rocked left and right and the rain-splashed roofs were as
  smooth as glass. It was only by twining his legs about one ventilator, and
  holding on to the other, that he succeeded in retaining his hold at all. But
  it was for her sake. For the sake of the woman he loved, he told himself,
  when utter weariness almost forced him to release his grip. Faster and faster
  grew the speed of the train, and now in addition to the misery the stinging
  rain caused him, he was bombarded by flying cinders and sparks from the
  engine.</p>

  <p>His coat was smouldering in a dozen places, in spite of its sodden
  condition, his eyes were grimed and smarting with the dust which the rain
  washed into them, and the agony of the attacks of cramp, which were becoming
  more and more frequent, was almost unendurable. But he held on as the train
  roared through the night, flashing through little wayside stations, diving
  into smoky tunnels, and all the time rocking left and right, so that it
  seemed miraculous that it was able to keep the rails.</p>

  <p>It seemed a century before there came from the darkness ahead a
  bewildering tangle of red and green lights. They were reaching Rugby and the
  train was already slowing. Suddenly it stopped with unusual suddenness and
  Jim was jerked from his hold. He made a wild claw at the nearest ventilator,
  but he missed his hold and fell with a thud down a steep bank, rolling over
  and over... another second, and he fell with a splash into water.</p>

  <p>The journey had been one of terror for Eunice Danton. She understood now
  the trick that had been played upon her. Digby Groat had known she would
  never leave willingly and had feared to use his dope lest her appearance
  betrayed him. He had guessed that in his disguise of the woman in black she
  would obey him instantly, and now she began to understand why he had chosen
  evening dress for her.</p>

  <p>"Where are you taking me?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He had drawn the blinds of the carriage and was smoking a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"If I had known you would ask that question," he said sarcastically, "I
  would have had a guide book prepared. As it is, you must possess your soul in
  patience, and wait until you discover your destination."</p>

  <p>There was only one carriage on the train which was not a corridor car, and
  Digby had carefully chosen that for his reservation. It was a local car that
  would be detached at Rugby, as he knew, and the possibility of an
  interruption was remote. Once or twice he had looked up to the ceiling and
  frowned. The girl, who had caught a scratching sound, as though somebody was
  crawling along the roof of the carriage, watched him as he pulled down the
  window and thrust out head and shoulders. He drew in immediately, his face
  wet with rain.</p>

  <p>"It is a filthy night," he said as he pulled down the blinds again. "Now,
  Eunice, be a sensible girl. There are worse things that could happen to you
  than to marry me."</p>

  <p>"I should like to know what they were," said Eunice calmly. The effect of
  the drug had almost worn oft and she was near to her normal self.</p>

  <p>"I have told you before," said Digby, puffing a ring of smoke to the
  ceiling, "that if your imagination will not supply you with a worse
  alternative, you are a singularly stupid young person, and you are not
  stupid." He stopped. Suddenly he changed his tone and, throwing the cigarette
  on to the ground, he came over to her and sat by her side. "I want you,
  Eunice," he said, his voice trembling and his eyes like fiery stars. "Don't
  you understand I want you? That you are necessary to me. I couldn't live
  without you now. I would sooner see you dead, and myself dead too, than hand
  you to Jim Steele, or any other man." His arm was about her, his face so
  close to hers that she could feel his quick breath upon her cheek. "You
  understand?" he said in a low voice. "I would sooner see you dead. That is an
  alternative for you to ponder on."</p>

  <p>"There are worse things than death."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you recognize that," said Digby, recovering his self-possession
  with a laugh. He must not frighten her at this stage of the flight. The real
  difficulties of the journey were not yet passed.</p>

  <p>As to Eunice, she was thinking quickly. The train must stop soon, she
  thought, and though he kill her she would appeal for help. She hated him now,
  with a loathing beyond description - seeing in him the ugly reality, and her
  soul shrank in horror from the prospect he had opened up to her. His real
  alternative she knew and understood only too well. It was not death - that
  would be merciful and final. His plan was to degrade her so that she would
  never again hold up her head, nor meet Jim's tender eyes. So that she would,
  in desperation, agree to marriage to save her name from disgrace, and her
  children from shame.</p>

  <p>She feared him more now in his grotesque woman garb, with that smile of
  his playing upon his thin lips, than when he had held her in his arms, and
  his hot kisses rained on her face. It was the brain behind those dark eyes,
  the cool, calculating brain that had planned her abduction with such minute
  care, that she had never dreamt she was being duped - this was what terrified
  her. What was his plan now? she wondered. What scheme had he evolved to
  escape from Rugby, where he must know the station officials would be looking
  for him?</p>

  <p>Lady Mary had seen her and recognized her and would have telegraphed to
  the officials to search the train. The thought of Lady Mary started a new
  line of speculation. Her mother! That beautiful woman of whom she had been
  jealous. A smile dawned on her face, a smile of sheer joy and happiness, and
  Digby Groat, watching her, wondered what was the cause.</p>

  <p>She puzzled him more than he puzzled her.</p>

  <p>"What are you smiling at?" he asked curiously, and as she looked at him
  the smile faded from her face. "You are thinking that you will be rescued at
  Rugby," he bantered.</p>

  <p>"Rugby," she said quickly. "Is that where the train stops?" And he
  grinned.</p>

  <p>"You're the most surprising person. You are constantly trapping me into
  giving you information," he mocked her. "Yes, the train will stop at Rugby."
  He looked at his watch and she heard him utter an exclamation. "We are nearly
  there," he said, and then he took from the little silk bag he carried in his
  role of an elderly woman a small black case, and at the sight of it Eunice
  shrank back.</p>

  <p>"Not that, not that," she begged. "Please don't do that."</p>

  <p>He looked at her.</p>

  <p>"Will you swear that you will not make any attempt to scream or cry out so
  that you will attract attention?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," she said eagerly. "I will promise you."</p>

  <p>She could promise that with safety, for if the people on the platform did
  not recognize her, her case was hopeless.</p>

  <p>"I will take the risk," he said. "I am probably a fool, but I trust you.
  If you betray me, you will not live to witness the success of your plans, my
  friend."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch38"
     name="ch38"></a>CHAPTER 38</h2>

  <p class="first">SHE breathed more freely when she saw the little black case
  dropped into the bag, and then the speed of the train suddenly slackened and
  stopped with such a violent jerk that she was almost thrown from the
  seat.</p>

  <p>"Is there an accident?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," said Digby, showing his teeth mirthlessly. He had
  adjusted his wig and his bonnet and now he was letting down the window and
  looking out into the night. There came to his ears a sound of voices up the
  line and a vista of signal lamps. He turned to the girl as he opened the
  door.</p>

  <p>"Come along," he commanded sharply, and she stood aghast.</p>

  <p>"We are not in the platform."</p>

  <p>"Come out quickly," he snarled. "Remember you promised."</p>

  <p>With difficulty she lowered herself in the darkness and his arm supported
  her as she dropped to the permanent way. Still clutching her arm, they
  stumbled and slid down the steep embankment and came presently to a field of
  high grass. Her shoes and stockings were sodden by the rain which was falling
  more heavily than ever, and she could scarcely keep her feet, but the hand
  that gripped her arm did not relax, nor did its owner hesitate. He seemed to
  know the way they were going, though to the girl it was impossible to see a
  yard before her.</p>

  <p>The pitiless rain soaked her through and through before she had half
  crossed the field. She heard Digby curse as he caught his foot in his skirt,
  and at any other time she might have laughed at the picture she conjured up
  of this debonair man, in his woman's dress. But now she was too terrified to
  be even amused.</p>

  <p>But she had that courage which goes with great fear. The soul courage
  which rises superior to the weakness of the flesh.</p>

  <p>Once Digby stopped and listened. He heard nothing but the patter of the
  rain and the silvery splash of the water as it ran from the bushes. He sank
  on his knees and looked along the ground, striving to get a skyline, but the
  railway embankment made it impossible. The train was moving on when the girl
  looked back, and she wondered why it had stopped so providentially at that
  spot.</p>

  <p>"I could have sworn I heard somebody squelching through the mud," said
  Digby. "Come along, there is the car."</p>

  <p>She caught the faint glimmer of a light and immediately afterwards they
  left the rough and soggy fields and reached the hard road, where walking was
  something more of a pleasure.</p>

  <p>The girl had lost one shoe in her progress and now she kicked off the
  other. It was no protection from the rain, for the thin sole was soaked
  through, so that it was more comfortable walking in her stockinged feet.</p>

  <p>The distance they had traversed was not far. They came from the side-lane
  on to the main road, where a closed car was standing, and Digby hustled her
  in, saying a few low words to the driver, and followed her.</p>

  <p>"Phew, this cursed rain," he said, and added with a laugh! "I ought not to
  complain. It has been a very good friend to me."</p>

  <p>Suddenly there was a gleam of light in the car. He had switched on a small
  electric lamp.</p>

  <p>"Where are your shoes?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I left them in the field," she said.</p>

  <p>"Damn you, why did you do that?" he demanded angrily. "You think you were
  leaving a clue for your lover, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be unreasonable, Mr. Groat. They weren't my shoes, so they couldn't
  be very much of a clue for him. They were wet through, and as I had lost one
  I kicked off the other."</p>

  <p>He did not reply to this, but sat huddled in a corner of the car, as it
  ran along the dark country road.</p>

  <p>They must have been travelling for a quarter of an hour when the car
  stopped before a small house and Digby jumped out. She would have followed
  him, but he stopped her.</p>

  <p>"I will carry you," he said.</p>

  <p>"It is not necessary," Eunice replied coldly.</p>

  <p>"It is very necessary to me," he interrupted her. "I don't want the marks
  of your stockinged feet showing on the roadside."</p>

  <p>He lifted her in his arms; it would have been foolish of her to have made
  resistance, and she suffered contact with him until he set her down in a
  stone passage in a house that smelt damp and musty.</p>

  <p>"Is there a fire here?" He spoke over his shoulders to the chauffeur.</p>

  <p>"Yes, in the back room. I thought maybe you'd want one, boss."</p>

  <p>"Light another," said Digby. He pushed open the door, and the blaze from
  the fire was the only light in the room.</p>

  <p>Presently the driver brought in an oil motor-lamp. In its rays Digby was a
  ludicrous spectacle. His grey wig was soaked and clinging to his face; his
  dress was thick with mud, and his light shoes were in as deplorable a
  condition as the girl's had been.</p>

  <p>She was in a very little better case, but she did not trouble to think
  about herself and her appearance. She was cold and shivering and crept nearer
  to the fire, extending her chilled hands to the blaze.</p>

  <p>Digby went out. She heard him still speaking in his low mumbling voice,
  but the man who replied was obviously not the chauffeur, though his voice
  seemed to have a faintly familiar ring. She wondered where she had heard it
  before, and after awhile she identified its possessor. It was the voice of
  the man whom she and Jim had met coming down the steps of the house in
  Grosvenor Square.</p>

  <p>Presently Digby came back carrying a suitcase.</p>

  <p>"It is lucky for you, my friend, that I intended you should change your
  clothes here," he said as he threw the case down. "You will find everything
  in there you require."</p>

  <p>He pointed to a bed which was in the corner of the room.</p>

  <p>"We have no towels, but if you care to forgo your night's sleep, or sleep
  in blankets, you can use the sheets to dry yourself," he said.</p>

  <p>"Your care for me is almost touching," she said scornfully, and he
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"I like you when you are like that," he said in admiration. "It is the
  spirit in you and the devil in you that appeal to me. If you were one of
  those puling, whining misses, all shocks and shivers, I would have been done
  with you a long time ago. It is because I want to break that infernal pride
  of yours, and because you offer me a contest, that you stand apart from, and
  above, all other women."</p>

  <p>She made no reply to this, and waited until he had gone out of the room
  before she looked for some means of securing the door. The only method,
  apparently, was to place a chair under the door-knob, and this she did,
  undressing quickly and utilizing the sheet as Digby had suggested.</p>

  <p>The windows were shuttered and barred. The room itself, except for the bed
  and the chair, was unfurnished and dilapidated. The paper was hanging in
  folds from the damp walls, and the under part of the grate was filled with
  the ashes of fires that had burnt years before, and the smell of decay almost
  nauseated her.</p>

  <p>Was there any chance of escape? she wondered. She tried the shuttered
  window, but found the bars were so thick that it was impossible to wrench
  them from their sockets without the aid of a hammer. She did not dream that
  they would leave the door unguarded, but it was worth trying, and she waited
  until the house seemed quiet before she made her attempt.</p>

  <p>Stepping out into the dark passage, she almost trod on the hand of Villa,
  who was lying asleep in the passage. He was awake instantly.</p>

  <p>"Do you want anything, miss?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," she replied, and went back to the room. It was useless,
  useless, she thought bitterly, and she must wait to see what the morrow
  brought forth.</p>

  <p>Her principal hope lay in her - her mother. How difficult that word was to
  say! How much more difficult to associate a name, the mention of which
  brought up the picture of the pleasant-faced woman who had been all that a
  mother could be to her in South Africa, with that gracious lady she had seen
  in Jim Steele's flat!</p>

  <p>She lay down, not intending to sleep, but the warmth of the room and her
  own tiredness made her doze. It seemed she had not slept more than a few
  minutes when she woke to find Villa standing by her side with a huge cup of
  cocoa in his hand.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry I can't give you tea, miss," he said.</p>

  <p>"What time is it?" she asked in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Five o'clock. The rain has stopped and it is a good morning for
  flying."</p>

  <p>"For flying?" she repeated in amazement.</p>

  <p>"For flying," said Villa, enjoying the sensation he had created. "You are
  going a little journey by aeroplane."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch39"
     name="ch39"></a>CHAPTER 39</h2>

  <p class="first">JIM STEELE had had as narrow an escape from death as he had
  experienced in the whole course of his adventurous life. It was not a river
  into which he tumbled, but a deep pool, the bottom of which was a yard thick
  with viscid mud, in which his feet and legs were held as by hidden hands.</p>

  <p>Struggle as he did, he could not release their grip, and he was on the
  point of suffocation when his groping hands found a branch of a tree which,
  growing on the edge of the pond, had drooped one branch until its end was
  under water. With the strength of despair, he gripped, and drew himself up by
  sheer force of muscle. He had enough strength left to drag himself to the
  edge of the pond, and there he lay, oblivious to the rain, panting and
  fighting for his breath.</p>

  <p>In the old days of the war, his comrades of the Scout Squadron used to
  tick off his lives on a special chart which was kept in the mess-room. He had
  exhausted the nine lives, with which they had credited him, when the war
  ended, and all further risk seemed to an end.</p>

  <p>"There go two more!" he gasped to himself. His words must have been
  inspired, for as he drew himself painfully to his bruised knees he heard a
  voice not a dozen yards away, and thanked God again. It was Digby Groat
  speaking.</p>

  <p>"Keep close to my side," said Digby.</p>

  <p>"I will," muttered Jim, and walked cautiously in the direction where he
  had heard the voice, but there was nobody in sight. The train, which had been
  stationary on the embankment above - he had forgotten the train - began to
  move, and in the rumble of its wheels, any sound might well be drowned.</p>

  <p>He increased his pace, but still he did not catch sight of the two people
  he was tracking. Presently he heard footsteps on a roadway, but only of a
  man.</p>

  <p>They had reached better going than the field, thought Jim, and moved over
  in the same direction. He found the lane, and as he heard the footsteps
  receding at the far end he ran lightly forward, hoping to overtake them
  before they reached the car, the red rear-light of which he could see. The
  wheels were moving as he reached the open road, and he felt for his revolver.
  If he could burst the rear tyres he could hold them. Jim was a deadly shot.
  Once, twice, he pressed the trigger, but there was no more than a "click," as
  the hammer struck the sodden cartridge, and before he could extract the dud
  and replace it the car was out of range.</p>

  <p>He was aching in every limb. His arms and legs were cramped painfully, but
  he was not deterred. Putting the useless pistol in his pocket, he stepped off
  at a jog-trot, following in the wake of the car.</p>

  <p>He was a magnificent athlete and he had, too, the intangible gift of
  class, that imponderable quality which distinguishes the great race-horse
  from the merely good. It served a double purpose, this exercise. It freed the
  cramped muscles, it warmed his chilled body and it cleared the mind. He had
  not been running for ten minutes before he had forgotten that within the
  space of an hour he had nearly been hurled to death from the roof of a train
  and had all but choked to death in the muddy depths of a pond.</p>

  <p>On, on, without either slackening or increasing his pace, the same steady
  lop-lopping stride that had broken the heart of the Oxford crack when he had
  brought victory to the light-blue side at Queen's Park.</p>

  <p>It was half an hour before he came in sight of the car, and he felt well
  rewarded, although he had scarcely glimpsed it before it had moved on
  again.</p>

  <p>Why had it stopped? he wondered, checking his pace to a walk. It may have
  been tyre trouble. On the other hand, they might have stopped at a house, one
  of Digby Groat's numerous depots through the country.</p>

  <p>He saw the house at last and went forward with greater caution, as he
  heard a man's voice asking the time.</p>

  <p>He did not recognize either Villa or Bronson, for though he had heard
  Villa speak, he had no very keen recollection of the fact. "What to do?"
  murmured Jim.</p>

  <p>The house was easily approachable, but to rush in with a defective
  revolver would help neither him nor the girl. If that infernal pond had not
  been there! He groaned in the spirit. That he was wise in his caution he was
  soon to discover. Suddenly a man loomed up before him and Jim stopped dead on
  the road. The man's back was towards him, and he was smoking as he walked up
  and down, taking his constitutional, for the rain had suddenly ceased. He
  passed so close as he turned back that, had he stretched out his hand towards
  the bushes under which Jim was crouching, he would not have failed to touch
  him.</p>

  <p>In a little while a low voice called:</p>

  <p>"Bronson!"</p>

  <p>"Bronson!" thought Jim. "I must remember that name!"</p>

  <p>The man turned and walked quickly back to the house, and the two talked in
  a tone so low that not a syllable reached Jim.</p>

  <p>At the risk of discovery he must hear more, and crept up to the house.
  There was a tiny porch before the door and under this the two men were
  standing.</p>

  <p>"I will sleep in the passage," said the deep-throated Villa. "You can take
  the other room if you like."</p>

  <p>"Not me," said the man called Bronson. "I'd rather stand by the machine
  all night. I don't want to sleep anyway."</p>

  <p>"What machine?" wondered Jim. "Was there another motor-car here?"</p>

  <p>"Will the boss get there to-night?" asked Villa.</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you, Mr. Villa," replied Bronson. "He might not, of course,
  but if there are no obstacles he'll be at the Hall before daybreak. It is not
  a very good road."</p>

  <p>At the Hall! In a flash it dawned upon Jim. Kennett Hall! The pile of
  buildings which Mrs. Weatherwale had pointed out to him as the one-time
  ancestral home of the Dantons. What a fool he had been not to remember that
  place when they were discussing the possible shelters that Digby Groat might
  use!</p>

  <p>Both Villa and Bronson were smoking now and the fragrance of the former
  man's cigar came to the envious Jim.</p>

  <p>"She won't give any trouble, will she, Mr. Villa?" asked Bronson.</p>

  <p>"Trouble?" Villa laughed. "Not she. She'll be frightened to death. I don't
  suppose she's ever been in an aeroplane before."</p>

  <p>So that was the machine. Jim's eyes danced. An aeroplane... where? He
  strained his eyes to beyond the house, but it was too dark to distinguish
  anything.</p>

  <p>"Nothing funny will happen to that machine of yours in the rain?"</p>

  <p>"Oh no," said Bronson. "I have put the sheet over the engines. I have
  frequently kept her out all night."</p>

  <p>Then you're a bad man, thought Jim, to whom an aeroplane was a living,
  palpitating thing. So Eunice was there and they were going to take her by
  aeroplane somewhere. What should he do? There was time for him to go back to
  Rugby and inform the police, but -</p>

  <p>"Where is Fuentes?" asked Bronson. "Mr. G. said he would be here."</p>

  <p>"He's along the Rugby Road," replied Villa. "I gave him a signal pistol to
  let us know in case they send a police-car after us. If you aren't going to
  bed, Bronson, I will, and you can wait out here and keep your eye open for
  any danger."</p>

  <p>Fuentes was in it, too, and his plan to get back to Rugby would not work.
  Nevertheless, the watchful Fuentes had allowed Jim to pass, though it was
  likely that he was nearer to Rugby than the place where he had come out on to
  the road. They might not get the girl away on the machine in the darkness,
  but who knows what orders Digby Groat had left for her disposal in case a
  rescue was attempted? He decided to wait near, hoping against hope that a
  policeman cyclist would pass.</p>

  <p>Villa struck a match to start a new cigar and in its light Jim had a
  momentary glimpse of the two men. Bronson was in regulation air-kit. A
  leather coat reached to his hips, his legs were encased in leather breeches
  and top-boots. He was about his height, Jim thought, as an idea took shape in
  his mind. What an end to that adventure! Jim came as near to being excited as
  ever he had been in his life.</p>

  <p>Presently Villa yawned.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to lie down in the passage, and if that dame comes out, she's
  going to have a shock," he said. "Good night. Wake me at half-past four."</p>

  <p>Bronson grunted something and continued his perambulations up and down the
  road. Ten minutes passed, a quarter of an hour, half an hour, and the only
  sound was the dripping of the rain from the trees, and the distant clatter
  and rumble of the trains as they passed through Rugby.</p>

  <p>To the north were the white lights of the railway sidings and workshops;
  to the west, the faint glow in the sky marked the position of a town. Jim
  pulled his useless pistol from his pocket and stepped on to the roadway,
  crouching down, so that when he did rise, he seemed to the astonished Bronson
  to have sprung out of the ground. Something cold and hard was pushed under
  the spy's nose.</p>

  <p>"If you make a sound, you son of a thief!" said Jim, "I'll blow your face
  off! Do you understand that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," muttered the man, shivering with fright.</p>

  <p>Jim's left hand gripped his collar. The automatic pistol under his nose
  was all too obvious, and Felix Bronson, a fearful man for whom the air alone
  had no terror, was cowed and beaten.</p>

  <p>"Where is the bus?" asked Jim in a whisper.</p>

  <p>"In the field behind the house," the man answered in the same tone. "What
  are you going to do? Who are you? How did you get past - "</p>

  <p>"Don't ask so many questions," said Jim; "lead the way - not that way," as
  the man turned to pass the house.</p>

  <p>"I shall have to climb the fence if I don't go that way," said Bronson
  sullenly.</p>

  <p>"Then climb it." said Jim, "it will do you good, you lazy devil!"</p>

  <p>They walked across the field, and presently Jim saw a graceful outline
  against the dark sky.</p>

  <p>"Now take off your clothes," he said peremptorily.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" demanded the startled Bronson. "I can't undress
  here!"</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry to shock your modesty, but that is just what you are going to
  do," said Jim; "and it will be easier to undress you alive than to undress
  you dead, as I know from my sorrowful experience in France."</p>

  <p>Reluctantly Bronson stripped his leather coat.</p>

  <p>"Don't drop it on the grass," said Jim, "I want something dry to
  wear."</p>

  <p>In the darkness Bronson utilized an opportunity that he had already
  considered. His hand stole stealthily to the hip-pocket of his leather
  breeches, but before it closed on its objective Jim had gripped it and spun
  him round, for Jim possessed other qualities of the cat besides its
  lives.</p>

  <p>"Let me see that lethal weapon. Good," said Jim, and flung his own to the
  grass. "I am afraid mine is slightly damaged, but I'll swear that yours is in
  good trim. Now, off with those leggings and boots."</p>

  <p>"I shall catch my death of cold." Bronson's teeth were chattering.</p>

  <p>"In which case," said the sardonic Jim, "I shall send a wreath; but I fear
  you are not born to die of cold in the head, but of a short sharp jerk to
  your cervical vertebra."</p>

  <p>"What is that?" asked Bronson.</p>

  <p>"It is German for neck," said Jim, "and if you think I am going to stand
  here giving you lectures on anatomy whilst you deliver the goods, you have
  made a mistake - strip!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch40"
     name="ch40"></a>CHAPTER 40</h2>

  <p class="first">UNDER menace of Jim Steele's pistol, Mr. Bronson stripped
  and shivered. The morning was raw, and the clothes that Jim in his mercy
  handed to the man to change were not very dry. Bronson said as much, but
  evoked no sympathy from Jim. He stood shivering and shaking in the wet
  clothes, whilst his captor strapped his wrists behind.</p>

  <p>"Just like they do when they hang you," said Jim to cheer him up. "Now, my
  lad, I think this handkerchief round your mouth and a nearly dry spot under a
  hedge is all that is required to make the end of a perfect night."</p>

  <p>"You're damned funny," growled Bronson in a fury, "but one of these days -
  "</p>

  <p>"Don't make me sing," said Jim, "or you'll be sorry."</p>

  <p>He found him a spot under a hedge, which was fairly dry and sheltered from
  observation, and there he entertained his guest until the grey in the sky
  warned him that it was time to wake Villa.</p>

  <p>Mr. Villa woke with a curse.</p>

  <p>"Come in and have some cocoa."</p>

  <p>"Bring it out here," said Jim. He heard the man fumbling with the lock of
  the door and raised his pistol.</p>

  <p>Something inside Jim Steele whispered: "Put that pistol away," and he
  obeyed the impulse, as with profit he had obeyed a hundred others.</p>

  <p>Men who fight in the air and who win their battles in the great spaces of
  the heavens are favoured with instincts which are denied to the other mortals
  who walk the earth.</p>

  <p>He had time to slip the pistol in his pocket and pull the goggles down
  over his eyes before the door opened and Villa sleepily surveyed him in the
  half-light.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, you're ready to fly, are you?" he said with a guffaw. "Well, I
  shan't keep you long."</p>

  <p>Jim strolled away from the house, pacing the road as Bronson had done the
  night before.</p>

  <p>What had made him put the pistol away? he wondered. He took it out
  furtively and slipped the cover. It was unloaded!</p>

  <p>He heard the man calling.</p>

  <p>"Put it down," he said, when he saw the cup in his hand.</p>

  <p>He drank the cocoa at a gulp, and making his way across the field to the
  aeroplane he pulled on the waterproof cover, tested the engine and pulled
  over the prop.</p>

  <p>Eunice had swallowed the hot cocoa and was waiting when Villa came in.
  What the day would bring forth she could only guess. Evidently there was some
  reason why Digby Groat should not wait for her, and amongst the many theories
  she had formed was one that he had gone on in order to lead his pursuers from
  her track. She felt better now than she had done since she left the house in
  Grosvenor Square, for the effect of the drug had completely gone, save for a
  tiredness which made walking a wearisome business. Her mind was clear, and
  the demoralizing tearfulness which the presence of Digby evoked had
  altogether dissipated.</p>

  <p>"Now, young miss, are you ready?" asked Villa. He was, at any rate. He
  wore a heavy coat and upon his head was a skin cap. This, with his hairy face
  and his broad stumpy figure, gave him the appearance of a Russian in winter
  attire. Why did he wrap himself up so on a warm morning? she wondered. He
  carried another heavy coat in his hand and held it up for her to put on.</p>

  <p>"Hurry up, I can't wait for you all day. Get that coat on."</p>

  <p>She obeyed.</p>

  <p>"I am ready," she said coldly.</p>

  <p>"Now, my dear, step lively!"</p>

  <p>Jim, who had taken his place in the pilot's seat, heard Villa's deep voice
  and looking round saw the woman he loved.</p>

  <p>She looked divinely beautiful by the side of that squat, bearded man who
  was holding her forearm and urging her forward.</p>

  <p>"Now, up with you."</p>

  <p>He pushed her roughly into one of the two seats behind the pilot, and Jim
  dared not trust himself to look back.</p>

  <p>"I'll swing the prop. for you, Bronson," said Villa, making his way to the
  propeller, and Jim, whose face was almost covered by the huge fur-lined
  goggles, nodded. The engine started with a splutter and a roar and Jim slowed
  it.</p>

  <p>"Strap the lady," he shouted above the sound of the engine, and Villa
  nodded and climbed into the fuselage with extraordinary agility for a man of
  his build.</p>

  <p>Jim waited until the broad strap was buckled about the girl's waist, and
  then he let out the engine to its top speed. It was ideal ground for taking
  off, and the plane ran smoothly across the grass, faster and faster with
  every second. And then, with a touch of the lever, Jim set the elevator down
  and the girl suddenly realized that the bumping had stopped and all conscious
  motion had ceased. The Scout had taken the air.</p>

  <p>Eunice had never flown in an aeroplane before, and for a moment she forgot
  her perilous position in the fascination of her new and wonderful experience.
  The machine did not seem to leave the earth. Rather it appeared as though the
  earth suddenly receded from the aeroplane and was sinking slowly away from
  them. She had a wonderful feeling of exhilaration as the powerful Scout shot
  through the air at a hundred miles an hour, rising higher and higher as it
  circled above the field it had left, a manoeuvre which set Villa wondering,
  for Bronson should have known the way back to Kennett Hall without bothering
  to find his landmark.</p>

  <p>But Bronson, so far from being at the wheel, at that moment was lying
  bound hand and feet beneath a bush in the field below, and had Villa looked
  carefully through his field glasses he would not have failed to see the
  figure of the man wearing Jim's muddy clothes. Villa could not suspect that
  the pilot was Jim Steele, the airman whose exploits in the abstract he had
  admired, but whose life he would not at this moment have hesitated to
  take.</p>

  <p>"It is lovely!" gasped Eunice, but her voice was drowned in the deafening
  thunder of the engines.</p>

  <p>They were soaring in great circles, and above were floating the scarves of
  mist that trailed their ravelled edges to the sun, which tinted them so that
  it seemed to her the sky's clear blue was laced with golden tissue. And
  beneath she saw a world of wonder: here was spread a marvellous mosaic, green
  and brown and grey, each little pattern rigidly defined by darked lines,
  fence and hedge and wall. She saw the blood-red roof of house and the spread
  of silver lakes irregular in shape, and to her eye like gouts of mercury that
  some enormous hand had shaken haphazard on the earth.</p>

  <p>"Glorious!" her lips said, but the man who sat beside her had no eye for
  the beauty of the scene.</p>

  <p>Communication between the pilot and his passengers was only possible
  through the little telephone, the receiver of which Jim had mechanically
  strapped to his ear, and after awhile he heard Villa's voice asking:</p>

  <p>"What are you waiting for? You know the way?"</p>

  <p>Jim nodded.</p>

  <p>He knew the way back to London just as soon as he saw the railway.</p>

  <p>The girl looked down in wonder on the huge chequer-board intercepted by
  tiny white and blue ribbons.</p>

  <p>They must be roads, and canals, she decided, and those little green and
  brown patches were the fields and the pastures of Warwickshire. How glorious
  it was on this early summer morning to be soaring through the cloud-wisps
  that flecked the sky, wrack from the storm that had passed overnight. And how
  amazingly soothing was the loneliness of wings! She felt aloof from the world
  and all its meanness. Digby Groat was no more than that black speck she could
  see, seemingly stationary, on the white tape of a road. She knew that speck
  was a man and he was walking. And within that circle alone was love and hate,
  desire and sacrifice.</p>

  <p>Then her attention was directed to Villa. He was red in the face and
  shouting something into the telephone receiver, something she could not hear,
  for the noise of the engines was deafening.</p>

  <p>She saw the pilot nod and turn to the right and the movement seemed to
  satisfy Villa, for he sank back in his seat.</p>

  <p>Little by little, the nose of the aeroplane came back to the south, and
  for a long time Villa did not realize the fact. It was the sight of the town
  which he recognized that brought the receiver of the telephone to his
  lips.</p>

  <p>"Keep to the right, damn you, Bronson. Have you lost your sense of
  direction?"</p>

  <p>Jim nodded, and again the machine banked over, only to return gradually to
  the southerly course; but now Villa, who had directed the manoeuvre, was
  alert.</p>

  <p>"What is wrong with you, Bronson?" and Jim heard the menace in his
  voice.</p>

  <p>"Nothing, only I am avoiding a bad air current," he answered, and
  exaggerated as the voice was by the telephone, Villa did not dream that it
  was anybody but Bronson to whom he was speaking.</p>

  <p>Jim kept a steady course westward, and all the time he was wondering where
  his destination was supposed to have been. He was a raving lunatic, he
  thought, not to have questioned Bronson before he left him, but it had never
  occurred to him that his ignorance on the subject would present any
  difficulties.</p>

  <p>He was making for London, and to London he intended going. That had been
  his plan from the first, and now, without disguise, he banked left,
  accelerated his engines and the Scout literally leapt forward.</p>

  <p>"Are you mad?" It was Villa's voice in his ear, and he made no reply, and
  then the voice sank to a hiss: "Obey my instructions or we crash
  together!"</p>

  <p>The barrel of an automatic was resting on his shoulder. He looked round,
  and at that moment Eunice recognized him and gave a cry.</p>

  <p>Villa shot a swift glance at her, and then leapt forward and jerked at
  Jim's shoulders, bringing his head round.</p>

  <p>"Steele!" he roared, and this time the pistol was under Jim's ear. "You
  obey my instructions, do you hear?"</p>

  <p>Jim nodded.</p>

  <p>"Go right, pick up Oxford and keep it to your left until I tell you to
  land."</p>

  <p>There was nothing for it now but to obey. But Jim did not fear. Had the
  man allowed him to reach London it might have been well for all parties. As
  Villa was taking an aggressive line, and had apparently recognized him, there
  could be only one end to this adventure, pistol or no pistol. He half twisted
  in his narrow seat, and looked back at Eunice with an encouraging smile, and
  the look he saw in her eyes amply repaid him for all the discomfort he had
  suffered.</p>

  <p>But it was not to look at her eyes that he had turned. His glance lingered
  for a while on her waist, and then on the waist of Villa, and he saw all that
  he wanted to know. He must wait until the man put his pistol away; at present
  Villa held the ugly-looking automatic in his hand. They passed over Oxford, a
  blur of grey and green, for a mist lay upon the city, making it difficult to
  pick out the buildings.</p>

  <p>Soon Jim's attention was directed elsewhere. One of his engines had begun
  to miss and he suspected water was in the cylinder. Still, he might keep the
  machine going for awhile. A direction was roared in his ear, and he bore a
  little more west. It seemed that the engine difficulty had been overcome, for
  she was running sweetly. Again he glanced back. The pistol was tucked in the
  breast of Villa's leather jacket, and probably would remain there till the
  end of the journey. To wait any longer would be madness.</p>

  <p>Eunice, watching the scene below in a whirl of wonder, suddenly felt the
  nose of the aeroplane dive down, as though it were aiming directly for earth.
  She experienced no sense of fear, only a startled wonder, for as suddenly the
  nose of the aeroplane came up again with a rush and the sky seemed to turn
  topsy-turvy. There was a tremendous strain at the leather belt about her
  waist, and looking "down" she found she was staring at the sky! Then she was
  dimly conscious of some commotion on her right and shut her eyes in
  instinctive apprehension. When she opened them again Villa was gone! Jim had
  looped the loop, and, unprepared for this form of attack, Villa, who was not
  secured to the machine, had lost his balance and fallen. Down, down, the tiny
  fly shape twirled and rolled with outstretched arms and legs, tragically
  comic in its grotesqueness....</p>

  <p>Jim turned his head away and this time swung completely round to the girl,
  and she saw his lips move and his eyes glance at the telephone which the man
  had left.</p>

  <p>She picked up the mouthpiece with trembling hands. Something dreadful had
  happened. She dare not look down: she would have fainted if she had made the
  attempt.</p>

  <p>"What has happened?" she asked in a quavering voice.</p>

  <p>"Villa has parachuted to the ground," lied Jim soothingly. "Don't worry
  about him. He's not in any danger - in this world," he added under his
  breath.</p>

  <p>"But, Jim, how did you come here?"</p>

  <p>"I'll have to explain that later," he shouted back, "my engine is
  misbehaving."</p>

  <p>This time the trouble was much more serious, and he knew that the journey
  to London he had contemplated would be too dangerous to attempt. He was not
  at sufficient height to command any ground he might choose, and he began to
  search the countryside for a likely landing. Ahead of him, fifteen miles
  away, was a broad expanse of green, and a pin-point flicker of white caught
  his eye. It must be an aerodrome, he thought, and the white was the ground
  signal showing the direction of the winds. He must reach that haven, though,
  had he been alone, he would not have hesitated to land on one of the small
  fields beneath him.</p>

  <p>Here the country is cut up into smaller pastures than in any other part of
  England, and to land on one of those fields with its high hedges, stiff and
  stout stone walls, would mean the risk of a crash, and that was a risk he did
  not care to take.</p>

  <p>As he grew nearer to the green expanse he saw that he had not been
  mistaken. The sheet was obviously planted for the purpose of signalling, and
  a rough attempt had been made to form an arrow. He shut off his engines and
  began to glide down, and the wheels touched the earth so lightly that Eunice
  did not realize that the flight was ended.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it was wonderful, Jim," she cried as soon as she could make herself
  heard, "but what happened to that poor man? Did you - "</p>

  <p>There was a flippant reply on Jim's lips, but when he saw the white face
  and the sorrowful eyes he decided it was not a moment for flippancy. He, who
  had seen so many better men than Villa die in the high execution of their
  duty, was not distressed by the passing of a blackguard who would have killed
  him and the girl without mercy.</p>

  <p>He lifted Eunice and felt her shaking under the coat she wore. And so they
  met again in these strange circumstances, after the parting which she had
  thought was final. They spoke no word to one another. He did not kiss her,
  nor did she want that evidence of his love. His very presence, the grip of
  his hands, each was a dear caress which the meeting of lips could not
  enhance.</p>

  <p>"There's a house here," said Jim, recovering his breath. "I must take you
  there and then go and telegraph dear old Salter."</p>

  <p>He put his arm about her shoulder, and slowly they walked across the
  grasses gemmed with wild flowers. Knee-deep they paced through the wondrous
  meadowland, and the scent of the red earth was incense to the benediction
  which had fallen on them.</p>

  <p>"This house doesn't seem to be occupied," said Jim, "and it is a big one,
  too."</p>

  <p>He led the way along a broad terrace, and they came to the front of the
  building. The door stood open, and there the invitation ended. Jim looked
  into a big dreary barn of a hall, uncarpeted and neglected.</p>

  <p>"I wonder what place this is," said Jim, puzzled.</p>

  <p>He opened a door that led from the hall to the left. The room into which
  he walked was unfurnished and bore the same evidence of decay as the hall had
  shown. He crossed the floor and entered a second room, with no other result.
  Then he found a passageway.</p>

  <p>"Is anybody here?" he called, and turned immediately. He thought he heard
  a cry from Eunice, whom he had left outside on the terrace admiring the
  beauty of the Somerset landscape. "Was that you, Eunice?" he shouted, and his
  voice reverberated through the silent house.</p>

  <p>There was no reply. He returned quickly by the way he had come, but when
  he reached the terrace Eunice was gone! He ran to the end, thinking she had
  strolled back to the machine, but there was no sign of her. He called her
  again, at the top of his voice, but only the echoes answered. Perhaps she had
  gone into the other room. He opened the front door and again stepped in.</p>

  <p>As he did so Xavier Silva crept from the room on the left and poised his
  loaded cane. Jim heard the swish of the stick and, half turning, took the
  blow short on his shoulder. For a second he was staggered, and then driving
  left and right to the face of the man he sent him spinning.</p>

  <p>Before he could turn, the noose of a rope dropped over his head and he was
  jerked to the ground, fighting for breath.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch41"
     name="ch41"></a>CHAPTER 41</h2>

  <p class="first">WHILST Jim had been making his search of the deserted house,
  Eunice had strolled to the edge of the terrace, and, leaning on the broken
  balustrade, was drinking in the beauty of the scene. Thin wraiths of mist
  still lingered in the purple shadows of the woods and lay like finest muslin
  in the hollows. In the still air the blue-grey smoke of the cottagers' fires
  showed above the tree-tops, and the sun had touched the surface of a stream
  that wound through a distant valley, so that it showed as a thread of
  bubbling gold amidst the verdant green.</p>

  <p>Somebody touched her gently on the shoulder. She thought it was Jim.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it lovely, Jim?"</p>

  <p>"Very lovely, but not half as lovely as you, my dear."</p>

  <p>She could have collapsed at the voice. Swinging round she came face to
  face with Digby Groat, and uttered a little cry.</p>

  <p>"If you want to save Steele's life," said Digby in a low urgent tone, "you
  will not cry out, you understand?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>He put his arm round her shoulder and she shivered, but it was no caress
  he offered. He was guiding her swiftly into the house. He swung open a door
  and, pushing her through, followed.</p>

  <p>There was a man in the room, a tall, dour man, who held a rope in his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Wait, Masters," whispered Digby. "We'll get him as he comes back." He had
  heard the footsteps of Jim in the hall and then suddenly there was a
  scuffle.</p>

  <p>Eunice opened her lips to cry a warning, but Digby's hand covered her
  mouth and his face was against her ear.</p>

  <p>"Remember what I told you," he whispered.</p>

  <p>There was a shout outside, it was from Xavier, and Masters dashed out
  ahead of his employer. Jim's back was turned to the open door, and Digby
  signalled. Immediately the rope slipped round Jim's neck and he was pulled
  breathlessly to the ground; his face grew purple and his hands were tearing
  at the cruel noose. They might have choked him then and there, but that
  Eunice, who had stood for a moment paralysed, flew out of the room and,
  thrusting Masters aside, knelt down and with her own trembling hands released
  the noose about her lover's neck.</p>

  <p>"You beasts, you beasts!" she cried, her eyes flashing her hate.</p>

  <p>In an instant Digby was on her and had lifted her clear.</p>

  <p>"Rope him," he said laconically, and gave his attention to the struggling
  girl. For now Eunice was no longer quiescent. She fought with all her might,
  striking at his face with her hands, striving madly to free herself of his
  grip.</p>

  <p>"You little devil!" he cried breathlessly, when he had secured her wrists
  and had thrust her against the wall. There was an ugly red mark where her
  nails had caught his face, but in his eyes there was nothing but
  admiration.</p>

  <p>"That is how I like you best," he breathed. "My dear, I have never
  regretted my choice of you! I regret it least at this moment!"</p>

  <p>"Release my hands!" she stormed. She was panting painfully, and, judging
  that she was incapable of further mischief, he obeyed.</p>

  <p>"Where have you taken Jim? What have you done with him?" she asked, her
  wide eyes fixed on his. There was no fear in them now. He had told her that
  he had seen the devil in her. Now it was fully aroused.</p>

  <p>"We have taken your young friend to a place of safety," said Digby. "What
  happened this morning, Eunice?"</p>

  <p>She made no reply.</p>

  <p>"Where is Villa?"</p>

  <p>Still she did not answer.</p>

  <p>"Very good," he said. "If you won't speak I'll find a way of making your
  young man very valuable."</p>

  <p>"You'd make him speak!" she said scornfully. "You don't know the man
  you're dealing with. I don't think you've ever met that type in the
  drawing-rooms you visited during the war. The real men were away in France,
  Digby Groat. They were running the risks you shirked, facing the dangers you
  feared. If you think you can make Jim Steele talk, go along and try!"</p>

  <p>"You don't know what you're saying," he said, white to the lips, for her
  calculated insult had touched him on the raw. "I can make him scream for
  mercy."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"You judge all men by yourself," she said, "and all women by the poor
  little shop-girls you have broken for your amusement."</p>

  <p>"Do you know what you're saying?" he said, quivering with rage. "You seem
  to forget that I am - "</p>

  <p>"I forget what you are!" she scoffed. The colour had come back to her face
  and her eyes were bright with anger. "You're a half-breed, a man of no
  country and no class, and you have all the attributes of a half-breed. Digby
  Groat, a threatener of women and an assassin of men, a thief who employs
  other thieves to take the risks whilst he takes the lion's share of the loot.
  A quack experimenter, who knows enough of medicines to drug women and enough
  of surgery to torture animals - I have no doubt about you!"</p>

  <p>For a long time he could not speak. She had insulted him beyond
  forgiveness, and with an uncanny instinct had discovered just the things to
  say that would hurt him most.</p>

  <p>"Put out your hands," he almost yelled, and she obeyed, watching him
  contemptuously as he bound them together with the cravat which he had torn
  from his neck.</p>

  <p>He took her by the shoulders and, pushing her feet from her ungently, sat
  her in a corner.</p>

  <p>"I'll come back and deal with you, my lady," he growled.</p>

  <p>Outside in the hall Masters was waiting for him, and the big, uncouth man
  was evidently troubled.</p>

  <p>"Where have you put him?"</p>

  <p>"In the east wing, in the old butler's rooms," he said, ill at ease. "Mr.
  Groat, isn't this a bad business?"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean, bad business?" snarled Digby.</p>

  <p>"I've never been mixed up in this kind of thing before," said Masters.
  "Isn't there a chance that they will have the law on us?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you worry, you'll be well paid," snapped his employer, and was
  going away when the man detained him.</p>

  <p>"Being well paid won't keep me out of prison, if this is a prison job," he
  said. "I come of respectable people, and I've never been in trouble all my
  life. I'm well known in the country, and although I'm not very popular in the
  village, yet nobody can point to me and say that I've done a prison job."</p>

  <p>"You're a fool," said Digby, glad to have some one to vent his rage upon.
  "Haven't I told you that this man has been trying to run off with my
  wife?"</p>

  <p>"You didn't say anything about her being your wife," said Masters, shaking
  his head and looking suspiciously at the other, "and, besides, she's got no
  wedding-ring. That's the first thing I noticed. And that foreign man hadn't
  any right to strike with his cane - it might have killed him."</p>

  <p>"Now look here, Masters," said Digby, controlling himself, for it was
  necessary that the man should be humoured, "don't trouble your head about
  affairs that you can't understand. I tell you this man Steele is a scoundrel
  who has run away with my wife and has stolen a lot of money. My wife is not
  quite normal, and I am taking her away for a voyage..." He checked himself.
  "Anyway, Steele is a scoundrel," he said.</p>

  <p>"Then why not hand him over to the police," said the uneasy Masters, "and
  bring him before the justices? That seems to me the best thing to do, Mr.
  Groat. You're going to get a bad name if it comes out that you treated this
  gentleman as roughly as you did."</p>

  <p>"I didn't treat him roughly," said Digby coolly, "and it was you who
  slipped the rope round his neck."</p>

  <p>"I tried to get it over his shoulders," explained Masters hastily;
  "besides, you told me to do it."</p>

  <p>"You'd have to prove that," said Digby, knowing that he was on the right
  track. "Now listen to me, Masters. The only person who has committed any
  crime so far has been you!"</p>

  <p>"Me?" gasped the man. "I only carried out your orders."</p>

  <p>"You'd have to prove that before your precious justices," said Digby, with
  a laugh, and dropped his hand on the man's shoulder, a piece of familiarity
  which came strangely to Masters, who had never known his employer in such an
  amiable mood. "Go along and get some food ready for the young lady," he said,
  "and if there is any trouble, I'll see that you get clear of it. And here."
  He put his hand in his pocket and took out a wad of notes, picked two of them
  out and pressed them into the man's hand. "They are twenty-pound banknotes,
  my boy, and don't forget it and try to change them as fivers. Now hurry along
  and get your wife to find some refreshment for the young lady."</p>

  <p>"I don't know what my wife's going to say about it," grumbled the man,
  "when I tell her - "</p>

  <p>"Tell her nothing," said Digby sharply. "Damn you, don't you understand
  plain English?"</p>

  <p>At three o'clock that afternoon a hired car brought two passengers before
  the ornamental gate of Kennett Hall, and the occupants, failing to secure
  admission, climbed the high wall and came trudging up towards the house.</p>

  <p>Digby saw them from a distance and went down to meet the bedraggled
  Bronson and the dark-skinned Spaniard who was his companion. They met at the
  end of the drive, and Bronson and his master, speaking together, made the
  same inquiry in identical terms;</p>

  <p>"Where is Villa?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch42"
     name="ch42"></a>CHAPTER 42</h2>

  <p class="first">THE room into which Jim was thrust differed little from
  those chambers he had already seen, save that it was smaller. The floorboards
  were broken, and there were holes in the wainscot which he understood long
  before he heard the scamper of the rats' feet.</p>

  <p>He was trussed like a fowl, his hands were so tightly corded together that
  he could not move them, and his ankles roped so that it was next to
  impossible to lever himself to his feet.</p>

  <p>"What a life!" said Jim philosophically, and prepared himself for a long,
  long wait.</p>

  <p>He did not doubt that Digby would leave immediately, and Jim faced the
  prospect of being left alone in the house, to make his escape or die. He was
  fully determined not to die, and already his busy mind had evolved a plan
  which he would put into execution as soon as he knew he was not under
  observation.</p>

  <p>But Digby remained in the house, as he was to learn.</p>

  <p>An hour passed, and then the door was snapped open and Digby came in,
  followed by a man at the sight of whom Jim grinned. It was Bronson, looking
  ludicrous in Jim's clothes, which were two sizes too large for him.</p>

  <p>"They discovered you, did they, Bronson!" he chuckled. "Well, here am I as
  you were, and presently somebody will discover me, and then I shall be
  calling on you in Dartmoor, some time this year, to see how you are going
  along. Nice place Dartmoor, and the best part of the prison is Block B. -
  central heating, gas, hot water laid on, and every modern convenience except
  tennis - "</p>

  <p>"Where is Villa?" asked Digby.</p>

  <p>"I don't know for a fact," said Jim pleasantly, "but I can guess."</p>

  <p>"Where is he?" roared Bronson, his face purple with rage.</p>

  <p>Jim smiled, and in another minute the man's open hand had struck him
  across the face, but still Jim smiled, though there was something in his eyes
  that made Bronson quail.</p>

  <p>"Now, Steele, there's no sense in your refusing to answer," said Digby.
  "We want to know what you have done with Villa. Where is he?"</p>

  <p>"In hell," said Jim calmly. "I'm not a whale on theology, Groat, but if
  men are punished according to their deserts, then undoubtedly your jovial pal
  is in the place where the bad men go and there is little or no flying."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that he is dead?" asked Digby, livid.</p>

  <p>"I should think he is," said Jim carefully. "We were over five thousand
  feet when I looped the loop from sheer happiness at finding myself once again
  with a joy-stick in my hand, and I don't think your friend Villa had taken
  certain elementary precautions. At any rate, when I looked round, where was
  Villa? He was flying through the air on his own, Groat, and my experience is
  that when a man starts flying without his machine, the possibility of making
  a good landing is fairly remote."</p>

  <p>"You killed him," said Bronson between his teeth, "damn you!"</p>

  <p>"Shut up," snapped Digby. "We know what we want to know. Where did you
  throw him out?"</p>

  <p>"Somewhere around," said Jim carelessly. "I chose a deserted spot. I
  should have hated it if he had hurt anybody when he fell."</p>

  <p>Digby went out of the room without a word, and locked the door behind him,
  and did not speak until he was back in the room where he had left Villa less
  than a week before. He shuddered as he thought of the man's dreadful end.</p>

  <p>The two Spaniards were there, and they had business which could not be
  postponed. Digby had hoped they would rely on his promise and wait until he
  had readied a place of safety before they insisted on a share-out, but they
  were not inclined to place too high a value upon their chief's word. Their
  share was a large one, and Digby hated the thought of paying them off, but it
  had to be done. He had still a considerable fortune. No share had gone to the
  other members of the gang.</p>

  <p>"What are your plans?" asked Xavier Silva.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to Canada," replied Digby. "You may watch the agony columns of
  the newspapers for my address."</p>

  <p>The Spaniard grinned.</p>

  <p>"I shall be watching for something more interesting," he said, "for my
  friend and I are returning to Spain. And Bronson, does he go with you?"</p>

  <p>Digby nodded.</p>

  <p>It was necessary, now that Villa had gone, to take the airman into his
  confidence. He had intended leaving his shadow in the lurch, a fact which
  Bronson did not suspect. He sent the two men into the grounds to give the
  machine an examination, and Jim, sitting in his room, heard the noise of the
  engine and struggled desperately to free his hands. If he could only get up
  to his feet! All his efforts must be concentrated upon that attempt.</p>

  <p>Presently the noise ceased; Xavier Silva was a clever mechanic, and he had
  detected that something was wrong with one of the cylinders.</p>

  <p>"Tuning up!" murmured Jim.</p>

  <p>So he had more time than he had hoped for.</p>

  <p>He heard a step on the stone terrace, and through the window caught a
  glimpse of Bronson passing. Digby had sent the man into the village to make
  judicious inquiries as to Villa's fate.</p>

  <p>Curiously enough, the three men who had watched the approaching aeroplane
  from the terrace of Kennett Hall had been unconscious of Villa's doom,
  although they were witnesses of the act. They had seen the loop in the sky
  and Digby had thought no more than that Bronson was showing off to the girl,
  and had cursed him roundly for his folly. Villa's body must be near at hand.
  How near, Bronson was to discover at the village inn.</p>

  <p>After the man had left, Digby went to look at his second prisoner, and
  found her walking up and down the room into which she had been put for
  safety.</p>

  <p>"Did you like your aeroplane journey, Eunice?" he asked blandly.</p>

  <p>She did not reply.</p>

  <p>"Rather thrilling and exciting, wasn't it? And were you a witness to the
  murder of my friend Villa?"</p>

  <p>She looked up at him.</p>

  <p>"I don't remember that your friend Villa was murdered," she said, ready to
  defend Jim of any charge that this man might trump up against him.</p>

  <p>He read her thoughts.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry about Mr. Steele," he said dryly. "I am not charging him with
  murder. In fact, I have no time. I am leaving tomorrow night as soon as it is
  dark, and you are coming with me by aeroplane."</p>

  <p>She did not answer this.</p>

  <p>"I am hoping that you won't mind a brief immersion in the sea," he said.
  "I cannot guarantee that we can land on my yacht."</p>

  <p>She turned round. On his yacht! That, then, was the plan. She was to be
  carried off to a yacht, and the yacht was to take her - where?</p>

  <p>There was a clatter of feet in the outer room and he opened the door. One
  glance at Bronson's face told him that he had important news.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he asked sharply.</p>

  <p>"They've found Villa's body. I saw a reporter at the inn," said the man
  breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"Do they know who it is?" asked Digby, and Bronson nodded.</p>

  <p>"What?" asked Digby, startled. "They know his name is Villa?"</p>

  <p>Again the man nodded.</p>

  <p>"They found a paper in his pocket, a receipt for the sale of a yacht," he
  said, and through the open doorway Eunice saw the man shrink back.</p>

  <p>"Then they know about the yacht?"</p>

  <p>The news confounded him and shook him from his calm. If the police knew
  about the yacht his difficulties became all but insuperable, and the danger
  which threatened him loomed up like a monstrous overwhelming shape. Digby
  Groat was not built to meet such stunning emergencies and he went all to
  pieces under the shock.</p>

  <p>Eunice, watching him through the open door, saw his pitiable collapse. In
  a second he had changed from the cool, self-possessed man who had sneered at
  danger into a babbling fretful child who cursed and wrung his hands, issuing
  incoherent orders only to countermand them before his messenger had left the
  room.</p>

  <p>"Kill Steele!" he screamed. "Kill him, Bronson. Damn him - no, no, stay!
  Get the machine ready... we leave to-night."</p>

  <p>He turned to the girl, glaring at her.</p>

  <p>"We leave to-night, Eunice! To-night you and I will settle accounts!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch43"
     name="ch43"></a>CHAPTER 43</h2>

  <p class="first">HER heart sank, and it came to her, with terrifying force,
  that her great trial was near at hand. She had taunted Digby with his
  cowardice, but she knew that he would show no mercy to her, and unwillingly
  she had played into his hands by admitting that she knew she was the heiress
  to the Danton fortune and that she had known his character, and yet had
  elected to stay in his house.</p>

  <p>The door was slammed and locked, and she was left alone. Later she heard
  for the second time the splutter and crash of the aeroplane's engines as the
  Spaniard tuned them up.</p>

  <p>She must get away - she must, she must! She looked round wildly for some
  means of escape. The windows were fastened. There was no other door from the
  room. Her only hope was Jim, and Jim, she guessed, was a close prisoner.</p>

  <p>Digby lost no time. He dispatched Silva in the car, telling him to make
  the coast as quickly as possible, and to warn the captain of the Pealigo to
  be ready to receive him that night. He wrote rapidly a code of signals. When
  in sight of the sea Bronson was to fire a green signal light, to which the
  yacht must respond. A boat must be lowered on the shoreward side of the yacht
  ready to pick them up. After the messenger had left he remembered that he had
  already given the same orders to the captain, and that it was humanly
  impossible for the Spaniard to reach the yacht that night.</p>

  <p>Digby had in his calmer moments made other preparations. Two inflated
  life-belts were taken to the aeroplane and tested, signal pistols, landing
  lights, and other paraphernalia connected with night flying were stowed in
  the fuselage. Bronson was now fully occupied with the motor of the aeroplane,
  for the trouble had not been wholly eradicated, and Digby Groat paced up and
  down the terrace of the house, fuming with impatience and sick with fear.</p>

  <p>He had not told the girl to prepare, that must be left to the very last.
  He did not want another scene. For the last time he would use his little
  hypodermic syringe and the rest would be easy.</p>

  <p>Fuentes joined him on the terrace, for Fuentes was curious for
  information.</p>

  <p>"Do you think that the finding of Villa's body will bring them after us
  here?"</p>

  <p>"How do I know?" snapped Digby, "and what does it matter, anyway? We shall
  be gone in an hour?"</p>

  <p>"You will," said the Spaniard pointedly, "but I shan't. I have no machine
  to carry me out of the country, and neither has Xavier, though he is better
  off than I am - he has the car. Couldn't you take me?"</p>

  <p>"It is utterly impossible," said Digby irritably. "They won't be here
  to-night, and you needn't worry yourself. Before the morning, you will have
  put a long way between you and Kennett Hall."</p>

  <p>He spoke in Spanish, the language which the man was employing, but Fuentes
  was not impressed.</p>

  <p>"What about that man?" He jerked his thumb to the west wing, and a thought
  occurred to Digby. Could he persuade his hitherto willing slave to carry out
  a final instruction?</p>

  <p>"He is your danger," he said. "Do you realize, my dear Fuentes, that this
  man can bring us all to destruction? And nobody knows he is here, except you
  and me."</p>

  <p>"And that ugly Englishman," corrected Fuentes.</p>

  <p>"Masters doesn't know what has happened to him. We could tell him that he
  went with us!"</p>

  <p>He looked at the other keenly, but Fuentes was purposely stupid.</p>

  <p>"Now what do you say, my dear Fuentes," said Digby, "shall we allow this
  man to live and give evidence against us, when a little knock on the head
  would remove him for ever?"</p>

  <p>Fuentes turned his dark eyes to Digby's, and he winked.</p>

  <p>"Well, kill him, my dear Groat," he mocked. "Do not ask me to stay behind
  and be found with the body, for I have a wholesome horror of English gaols,
  and an unspeakable fear of death."</p>

  <p>"Are you afraid?" asked Digby.</p>

  <p>"As afraid as you," said the Spaniard. "If you wish to kill him, by all
  means do so. And yet, I do not know that I would allow you to do that," he
  mused, "for you would be gone and I should be left. No, no, we will not
  interfere with our courageous Englishman. He is rather a fine fellow." Digby
  turned away in disgust.</p>

  <p>The "fine fellow" at that moment had, by almost super-human effort, raised
  himself to his feet. It had required something of the skill of an acrobat and
  the suppleness and ingenuity of a contortionist, and it involved supporting
  himself with his head against the wall for a quarter of an hour whilst he
  brought his feet to the floor; but he had succeeded.</p>

  <p>The day was wearing through and the afternoon was nearly gone before he
  had accomplished this result. His trained ear told him that the aeroplane was
  now nearly ready for departure, and once he had caught a glimpse of Digby
  wearing a lined leather jacket. But there was no sign of the girl. As to
  Eunice, he steadfastly kept her out of his thoughts. He needed all his
  courage and coolness, and even the thought of her, which, in spite of his
  resolution, flashed across his mind, brought him agonizing distress.</p>

  <p>He hopped cautiously to the window and listened. There was no sound and he
  waited until Bronson - he guessed it was Bronson - started the engines again.
  Then with his elbow he smashed out a pane of glass, leaving a jagged
  triangular piece firmly fixed in the ancient putty. Carefully he lifted up
  his bound hands, straining at the rope which connected them with the bonds
  about his feet, and which was intended to prevent his raising his hands
  higher than the level of his waist.</p>

  <p>By straining at the rope and standing on tiptoe, he brought the end of the
  connecting link across the sharp jagged edge of the glass. Two strokes, and
  the rope was severed. His hands were still bound and to cut through them
  without injury to himself was a delicate operation. Carefully he sawed away,
  and first one and then the other cord was cut through. His hands were red and
  swollen, his wrists had no power until he had massaged them.</p>

  <p>He snapped off the triangular piece of glass and applied it to the cords
  about his feet, and in a minute he was free. Free, but in a locked room.
  Still, the window-sash should not prove an insuperable obstacle. There was
  nothing which he could use as a weapon, but his handy feet smashed at the
  frames, only to discover that they were of iron. Jonathan Danton's father had
  had a horror of burglars, and all the window-frames on the lower floor had
  been made in a foundry. The door was the only egress left and it was too
  stout to smash.</p>

  <p>He listened at the keyhole. There was no sound. The light was passing from
  the sky and night was coming on. They would be leaving soon, he guessed, and
  grew frantic. Discarding all caution, he kicked at the panels, but they
  resisted his heavy boots, and then he heard a sound that almost stopped his
  heart beating.</p>

  <p>A shrill scream from Eunice. Again and again he flung his weight at the
  door, but it remained immovable, and then came a shout from the ground
  outside. He ran to the window and listened.</p>

  <p>"They are coming, the police!"</p>

  <p>It was the Spaniard's throbbing voice. He had run until he was exhausted.
  Jim saw in stagger past the window and heard Digby say something to him
  sharply. There was a patter of feet and silence.</p>

  <p>Jim wiped the sweat from his forehead with the sleeve of his coat and
  looked round desperately for some means of getting out of the room. The
  fireplace! It was a big, old-fashioned fire-basket, that stood on four legs
  in a yawning gap of chimney. He looked at it; it was red with rust and it had
  the appearance of being fixed, but he lifted it readily. Twice he smashed at
  the door and the second time it gave way, and dropping the grate with a crash
  he flew down the passage out of the house.</p>

  <p>As he turned the corner he heard the roar of the aeroplane and above its
  drone the sound of a shot. He leapt the balustrade, sped through the garden
  and came in sight of the aeroplane as it was speeding from him.</p>

  <p>"My God!" said Jim with a groan, for the machine had left the ground and
  was zooming steeply up into the darkening sky.</p>

  <p>And then he saw something. From the long grass near where the machine had
  been a hand rose feebly and fell again. He ran across to where he had seen
  this strange sight. In a few minutes he was kneeling by the side of Fuentes.
  The man was dying. He knew that long before he had seen the wound in his
  breast.</p>

  <p>"He shot me, senor," gasped Fuentes, "and I was his friend... I asked him
  to take me to safety... and he shot me!"</p>

  <p>The man was still alive when the police came on the spot; still alive when
  Septimus Salter, in his capacity of Justice of the Peace, took down his dying
  statement.</p>

  <p>"Digby Groat shall hang for this, Steele," said the lawyer; but Jim made
  no reply. He had his own idea as to how Digby Groat would die.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch44"
     name="ch44"></a>CHAPTER 44</h2>

  <p class="first">THE lawyer explained his presence without preliminary, and
  Jim listened moodily.</p>

  <p>"I came with them myself because I know the place," said Mr. Salter,
  looking at Jim anxiously. "You look ghastly, Steele. Can't you lie down and
  get some sleep?"</p>

  <p>"I feel that I shall never sleep until I have got my hand on Digby Groat.
  What was it you saw in the paper? Tell me again. How did they know it was
  Villa?"</p>

  <p>"By a receipt in his pocket," replied Salter. "It appears that Villa,
  probably acting on behalf of Digby Groat, had purchased from Maxilla, the
  Brazilian gambler, his yacht, the Pealigo - "</p>

  <p>Jim uttered a cry.</p>

  <p>"That is where he has gone," he said. "Where is the Pealigo?"</p>

  <p>"That I have been trying to find out," replied the lawyer, shaking his
  head, "but nobody seems to know. She left Havre a few days ago, but what her
  destination was, nobody knows. She has certainly not put in to any British
  port so far as we can ascertain. Lloyd's were certain of this, and every
  ship, whether it is a yacht, a liner, or a cargo tramp, is reported to
  Lloyd's."</p>

  <p>"That is where he has gone," said Jim.</p>

  <p>"Then she must be in port," said old Salter eagerly. "We can telegraph to
  every likely place - "</p>

  <p>Jim interrupted him with a shake of his head.</p>

  <p>"Bronson would land on the water and sink the machine. It is a very simple
  matter," he said. "I have been in the sea many times and there is really no
  danger, if you are provided with life-belts, and are not strapped to the
  seat. It is foul luck your not coming before."</p>

  <p>He walked weakly from the comfortable parlour of the inn where the
  conversation had taken place.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind if I am alone for a little while? I want to think," he
  said.</p>

  <p>He turned as he was leaving the room.</p>

  <p>"In order not to waste time, Mr. Salter," he said quietly, "have you any
  influence with the Admiralty? I want the loan of a seaplane."</p>

  <p>Mr. Salter looked thoughtful.</p>

  <p>"That can be fixed," he said. "I will get on to the 'phone straight away
  to the Admiralty and try to get the First Sea Lord. He will do all that he
  can to help us."</p>

  <p>Whilst the lawyer telephoned, Jim made a hasty meal. The pace had told on
  him and despair was in his heart.</p>

  <p>The knowledge that Digby Groat would eventually be brought to justice did
  not comfort him. If Eunice had only been spared he would have been content to
  see Digby make his escape, and would not have raised his hand to stop him
  going. He would have been happy even if, in getting away, the man had been
  successful in carrying off the girl's fortune. But Eunice was in his wicked
  hands and the thought of it was unendurable.</p>

  <p>He was invited by the local police-sergeant to step across to the little
  lock-up to interview the man Masters, who was under arrest, and as Mr. Salter
  had not finished telephoning, he crossed the village street and found the
  dour man in a condition of abject misery.</p>

  <p>"I knew he'd bring me into this," he bewailed, "and me with a wife and
  three children and not so much as a poaching case against me! Can't you speak
  a word for me, sir?"</p>

  <p>Jim's sense of humour was never wholly smothered and the cool request
  amused him.</p>

  <p>"I can only say that you tried to strangle me," he said. "I doubt whether
  that good word will be of much service to you."</p>

  <p>"I swear I didn't mean to," pleaded the man. "He told me to put the rope
  round your shoulders and it slipped. How was I to know that the lady wasn't
  his wife who'd run away with you?"</p>

  <p>"So that is the story he told you?" said Jim.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," the man said eagerly. "I pointed out to Mr. Groat that the
  lady hadn't a wedding-ring, but he said that he was married all right and he
  was taking her to sea - "</p>

  <p>"To sea?"</p>

  <p>Masters nodded.</p>

  <p>"That's what he said, sir - he said she wasn't right in her head and the
  sea voyage would do her a lot of good."</p>

  <p>Jim questioned him closely without getting any further information.
  Masters knew nothing of the steamer on which Digby and his "wife" were to
  sail, or the port at which he would embark.</p>

  <p>Outside the police station Jim interviewed the sergeant.</p>

  <p>"I don't think this man was any more than a dupe of Groat's," he said,
  "and I certainly have no charge to make against him."</p>

  <p>The sergeant shook his head.</p>

  <p>"We must hold him until we have had the inquest on the Spaniard," he said,
  and then, gloomily, "to think that I had a big case like this right under my
  nose and hadn't the sense to see it!"</p>

  <p>Jim smiled a little sadly.</p>

  <p>"We have all had the case under our noses, sergeant, and we have been
  blinder than you!"</p>

  <p>* * *</p>

  <p>The threat of a renewed dose of the drug had been sufficient to make
  Eunice acquiescent. Resistance, she knew, was useless. Digby could easily
  overpower her for long enough to jab his devilish needle into her arm.</p>

  <p>She had struggled at first and had screamed at the first prick from the
  needle-point. It was that scream Jim had heard.</p>

  <p>"I'll go with you; I promise you I will not give you any trouble," she
  said. "Please don't use that dreadful thing again."</p>

  <p>Time was pressing and it would be easier to make his escape if the girl
  did not resist than if she gave him trouble.</p>

  <p>The propeller was ticking slowly round when they climbed into the
  fuselage.</p>

  <p>"There is room for me, senor. There must be room for me!"</p>

  <p>Digby looked down into the distorted face of the Spaniard who had come
  running after him.</p>

  <p>"There is no room for you, Fuentes," he said. "I have told you before. You
  must get away as well as you can."</p>

  <p>"I am going with you!"</p>

  <p>To Digby's horror, the man clung desperately to the side of the fuselage.
  Every moment was increasing their peril, and in a frenzy he whipped out his
  pistol.</p>

  <p>"Let go," he hissed, "or I'll kill you," but still the man held on.</p>

  <p>There were voices coming from the lower path, and, in his panic, Digby
  fired. He saw the man crumple and fall and yelled to Bronson: "Go, go!"</p>

  <p>Eunice, a horrified spectator, could only stare at the thing which had
  been Digby Groat, for the change which had come over him was extraordinary.
  He seemed to have shrunk in stature. His face was twisted, like a man who had
  had a stroke of paralysis.</p>

  <p>She thought this was the case, but slowly he began to recover.</p>

  <p>He had killed a man! The horror of this act was upon him, the fear of the
  consequence which would follow overwhelmed him and drove him into a momentary
  frenzy. He had killed a man! He could have shrieked at the thought. He, who
  had so carefully guarded himself against punishment, who had manoeuvred his
  associates into danger, whilst he himself stood in a safe place, was now a
  fugitive from a justice which would not rest until it had laid him by the
  heel.</p>

  <p>And she had seen him, she, the woman at his side, and would go into the
  box and testify against him! And they would hang him! In that brick-lined pit
  of which Jim Steele had spoken. All these thoughts flashed through his mind
  in a second, even before the machine left the ground, but with the rush of
  cold air and the inevitable exhilaration of flight, he began to think calmly
  again.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch45"
     name="ch45"></a>CHAPTER 45</h2>

  <p class="first">BRONSON had killed him, that was the comforting defence.
  Bronson, who was now guiding him to safety, and who would, if necessary, give
  his life for him. Bronson should bear the onus of that act.</p>

  <p>They were well up now, and the engines were a smooth "b-r-r" of sound. A
  night wind was blowing and the plane rocked from side to side. It made the
  girl feel a little sick, but she commanded her brain to grow accustomed to
  the motion, and after a while the feeling of nausea wore off.</p>

  <p>They could see the sea now. The flashing signals of the lighthouses came
  from left and right. Bristol, a tangle of fiery spots, lay to their left, and
  there were tiny gleams of light on the river and estuary.</p>

  <p>They skirted the northern shore of the Bristol Channel and headed west,
  following the coastline. Presently the machine turned due south, leaving
  behind them the land and its girdle of lights. Twenty minutes later Bronson
  fired his signal pistol. A ball of brilliant green fire curved up and down
  and almost immediately, from the sea, came an answering signal. Digby
  strapped the girl's life-belt tighter, and saw to the fastening of his
  own.</p>

  <p>"Fix my belt." It was Bronson shouting through the telephone, and Digby,
  leaning forward, fastened the life-belt about the pilot's waist. He fastened
  it carefully and added a stout strap, tying the loose end of the leather in a
  knot. Down went the machine in a long glide toward the light which still
  burnt, and now the girl could see the outlines of the graceful yacht and the
  green and red lights it showed. They made a circle, coming lower and lower
  every second, until they were spinning about the yacht not more than a dozen
  feet from the sea. Bronson shut off his engines and brought the machine upon
  the water, less than fifty feet from the waiting boat.</p>

  <p>Instantly the aeroplane sank under them, leaving them in the sea. It was a
  strange sensation, thought the girl, for the water was unusually warm.</p>

  <p>She heard a shriek and turned, and then Digby caught her hand.</p>

  <p>"Keep close to me," he said in a whimpering voice, "you might be lost in
  the darkness."</p>

  <p>She knew that he was thinking of himself. A light flared from the oncoming
  boat, and she looked round. In spite of herself, she asked:</p>

  <p>"Where is the man?"</p>

  <p>Bronson was nowhere in sight. Digby did not trouble to turn his head or
  answer. He reached up and gripped the gunwale of the boat and in a minute
  Eunice was lifted out of the water. She found herself in a small cutter which
  was manned by brown-faced men, whom she thought at first were Japanese.</p>

  <p>"Where is Bronson?" she asked again in a panic, but Digby did not reply.
  He sat immovable, avoiding her eyes, and she could have shrieked her horror.
  Bronson had gone down with the aeroplane! The strap which Digby had fastened
  about his waist, he had cunningly attached to the seat itself, and had
  fastened it so that it was impossible for the pilot to escape.</p>

  <p>He was the first up the gangway on to the white deck of the yacht, and
  turning, he offered his hand to her.</p>

  <p>"Welcome to the Pealigo," he said in his mocking voice.</p>

  <p>Then it was not fear that had kept him silent. She could only look at
  him.</p>

  <p>"Welcome to the Pealigo, my little bride," he said, and she knew that the
  man who had not hesitated to murder his two comrades in cold blood would have
  no mercy on her.</p>

  <p>A white-coated stewardess came forward, and said something in a language
  which Eunice did not understand. She gathered that the woman was deputed to
  show her the way to the cabin. Glad to be free from the association of Digby,
  she passed down the companion-way, through a lobby panelled in rosewood, into
  a cabin, the luxury of which struck her, even though her nerves were
  shattered, and she was incapable of taking an interest in anything outside
  the terrible fact that she was alone on a yacht with Digby Groat.</p>

  <p>Extravagance had run riot here, and the Brazilian must have lavished a
  fortune in the decoration and appointments.</p>

  <p>The saloon ran the width of the ship and was as deep as it was broad.
  Light was admitted from portholes cunningly designed, so that they had the
  appearance of old-fashioned casement windows. A great divan, covered in silk,
  ran the length of the cabin on one side, whilst the other was occupied by a
  silver bedstead, hung with rose silk curtains. Rose-shaded lights supplied
  the illumination, and the lamps were fashioned like torches and were held by
  beautiful classical figures placed in niches about the room.</p>

  <p>She came to the conclusion that it was a woman's room and wondered if
  there were any other women on board but the stewardess. She asked that woman,
  but apparently she knew no English, and the few words in Spanish which she
  had learnt did not serve her to any extent.</p>

  <p>The suite was complete, she discovered, for behind the heavy silken
  curtains at the far end of the cabin there was a door which gave to a small
  sitting-room and a bath-room. It must be a woman's. In truth, it was designed
  especially by Senor Maxilla for his own comfort.</p>

  <p>Lying on the bed was a complete change of clothing. It was brand-new and
  complete to the last detail. Digby Groat could be very thorough.</p>

  <p>She dismissed the woman, and bolting the door, made a complete change, for
  the third time since she had left Grosvenor Square.</p>

  <p>The boat was under way now. She could feel the throb of its engines, and
  the slight motion that it made in the choppy sea. The Pealigo was one of the
  best sea boats afloat, and certainly one of the fastest yachts in
  commission.</p>

  <p>She had finished her changing when a knock came at the door and she opened
  it to find Digby standing on the mat.</p>

  <p>"You had better come and have some dinner," he said.</p>

  <p>He was quite his old self, and whatever emotions had disturbed him were
  now completely under control.</p>

  <p>She shrank back and tried to close the floor, but now he was not standing
  on ceremony. Grasping her arm roughly, he dragged her out into the
  passage.</p>

  <p>"You're going to behave yourself while you're on this ship," he said. "I'm
  master here, and there is no especial reason why I should show you any
  politeness."</p>

  <p>"You brute, you beast!" she flamed at him, and he smiled.</p>

  <p>"Don't think that because you're a woman it is going to save you anything
  in the way of punishment," he warned her. "Now be sensible and come along to
  the dining-saloon."</p>

  <p>"I don't want to eat," she said.</p>

  <p>"You will come into the dining-saloon whether you want to or not."</p>

  <p>The saloon was empty save for the two and a dark-skinned waiter, and, like
  her own cabin, it was gorgeously decorated, a veritable palace in miniature,
  with its dangling electrolier, its flowers, and its marble mantelpiece at the
  far end.</p>

  <p>The table was laid with a delicious meal, but Eunice felt she would choke
  if she took a morsel.</p>

  <p>"Eat," said Digby, attacking the soup which had been placed before
  him.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"If you don't," and his eyes narrowed, "if you don't, my good soul, I will
  find a way of making you eat," he said. "Remember," he put his hand in his
  pocket, pulled out the hateful little black case (it was wet, she noticed)
  and laid it on the table, "at any rate, you will be obedient enough when I
  use this!"</p>

  <p>She picked up her spoon meekly and began to drink the soup, and he watched
  her with an amused smile.</p>

  <p>She was surprised to find how hungry she was, and made no attempt to deny
  the chicken en casserole, nor the sweet that followed, but resolutely she
  refused to touch the wine that the steward poured out for her, and Digby did
  not press her.</p>

  <p>"You're a fool, you know, Eunice." Digby lit a cigar without asking
  permission, and leaning back in his chair, looked at her critically. "There
  is a wonderful life ahead for you if you are only intelligent. Why worry
  about a man like Steele? A poor beggar, without a penny in the world - "</p>

  <p>"You forget that I have no need of money, Mr. Groat," she said with
  spirit. Any reference to Jim aroused all that was savage in her. "I have not
  only the money which you have not stolen from my estate, but when you are
  arrested and in prison, I shall recover all that you have now, including this
  yacht, if it is yours."</p>

  <p>Her answer made him chuckle.</p>

  <p>"I like spirit," he said. "You can't annoy me, Eunice, my darling. So you
  like our yacht - our honeymoon yacht?" he added.</p>

  <p>To this, she made no reply.</p>

  <p>"But suppose you realise how much I love you." He leant over and caught
  her hand in both of his and his eyes devoured her. "Suppose you realise that,
  Eunice, and knew I would give my life - my very soul - to make you happy,
  wouldn't that make a difference?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing would make a difference to my feelings, Mr. Groat," she said.
  "The only chance you have of earning my gratitude is to put in at the nearest
  port and set me ashore."</p>

  <p>"And where do I set myself?" he asked coolly. "Be as intelligent as you
  are beautiful, Eunice. No, no, I shall be very glad to make you happy, so
  long as I get a little of the happiness myself, but I do not risk
  imprisonment and death." He shivered, and hated himself that he had been
  surprised into this symptom of fear and hated her worst, having noticed
  that.</p>

  <p>"Where are we going?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"We are bound to South America," said Digby, "and it may interest you to
  learn that we are following a track which is not usually taken by the South
  American traffic. We shall skirt Ireland and take what Americans call the
  Western Ocean route, until we are within 1000 miles of <i>Long Island</i>,
  when we shall turn due south. By this way we avoid being sighted by the
  American ships, and we also avoid - "</p>

  <p>The man who came in at that moment, Eunice thought must be the
  captain.</p>

  <p>He wore three rings of gold about his wrist, but he was not her ideal of a
  seaman. Under-sized, lame in one foot, his parchment face of stiff black hair
  almost convinced her that this was a Japanese boat after all.</p>

  <p>"You must meet the captain," said Digby, introducing him, "and you had
  better make friends with him."</p>

  <p>Eunice thought that the chances of her making friends with that
  uncompromising little man were remote.</p>

  <p>"What is it, captain?" asked Digby in Portuguese.</p>

  <p>"We have just picked up a wireless; I thought you'd like to see it."</p>

  <p>"I had forgotten we had wireless," said Digby as he took the message from
  the man's hand.</p>

  <p>It was ill-spelt, having been written by a Brazilian who had no knowledge
  of English and had set down the message letter by letter as he received it.
  Skipping the errors of transmission, Digby read;</p>

  <p class="letter">"To all ships westward, southward, and homeward bound. Keep
  a sharp look out for the yacht Pealigo and report by wireless, position and
  bearing, to Inspector Rite, Scotland Yard."</p>

  <p>Eunice did not understand what they were talking about, but she saw a
  frown settle on Digby's forehead, and guessed that the news was bad. If it
  was bad for him, then it was very good for her, she thought, and her spirits
  began to rise.</p>

  <p>"You had better go to bed, Eunice," said Digby. "I want to talk to the
  captain."</p>

  <p>She rose, and only the captain rose with her.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," said Digby testily. "You are not here to do the honours to
  Mrs. Digby Groat."</p>

  <p>She did not hear the last words, for she was out of the saloon as quickly
  as she could go. She went back to her own cabin, shut the door, and put up
  her hand to shoot home the bolt, but while she had been at dinner somebody
  had been busy. The bolt was removed and the key of the door was gone!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch46"
     name="ch46"></a>CHAPTER 46</h2>

  <p class="first">EUNICE stared at the door. There was no mistake. The bolts
  had recently been removed and the raw wood showed where the screws had been
  taken out.</p>

  <p>The Pealigo was rolling now, and she had a difficulty in keeping her
  balance, but she made her way round the cabin, gathering chairs, tables,
  everything that was movable, and piling them up against the door. She
  searched the drawers of the bureau for some weapon which might have been left
  by its former occupant, but there was nothing more formidable than a
  golden-backed hairbrush which the plutocratic Maxilla had overlooked.</p>

  <p>The bathroom yielded nothing more than a long-handled brush, whilst her
  sitting-room made no return for her search.</p>

  <p>She sat watching the door as the hours passed, but no attempt was made to
  enter the cabin. A bell rang at intervals on the deck: she counted eight. It
  was midnight. How long would it be before Digby Groat came?</p>

  <p>At that moment a pale-faced Digby Groat, his teeth chattering, sat in the
  cabin of the wireless operator, reading a message which had been picked up.
  Part was in code, and evidently addressed to the Admiralty ships cruising in
  the vicinity, but the longer message was in plain English and was
  addressed:</p>

  <p class="letter">"To the chief officers of all ships. To the Commanders of
  H.M. ships: to all Justices of the Peace, officers of the police Great
  Britain and Ireland. To all Inspectors, sub-inspectors of the Royal Irish
  Constabulary:<br>
  "Arrest and detain Digby Groat, height five foot nine, stoutly built,
  complexion sallow, had small moustache but believed to have shaven. Speaks
  Spanish, French, Portuguese, and is a qualified surgeon and physician,
  believed to be travelling on the S.Y. Pealigo, No. XVM. This man is wanted on
  a charge of wilful murder and conspiracy; a reward of five thousand pounds
  will be paid by Messrs. Salter &amp; Salter, Solicitors, of London, for his
  arrest and detention. Believe he has travelling with him, under compulsion,
  Dorothy Danton, age 22. Groat is a dangerous man and carries fire-arms."</p>

  <p>The little captain of the Pealigo took the thin cigar from his teeth and
  regarded the grey ash attentively, though he was also looking at the
  white-faced man by the operator's side.</p>

  <p>"So you see, senhor," he said suavely, "I am in a most difficult
  position."</p>

  <p>"I thought you did not speak English," said Digby, finding his voice at
  last.</p>

  <p>The little captain smiled.</p>

  <p>"I read enough English to understand a reward of five thousand pounds,
  senhor," he said significantly. "And if I did not, my wireless operator
  speaks many languages, English included, and he would have explained to me,
  even if I had not been able to understand the message myself."</p>

  <p>Digby looked at him bleakly.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"That depends upon what you are going to do," said the Brazilian. "I am no
  traitor to my salt, and I should like to serve you, but you readily
  understand that this would mean a terrible thing for me, if, knowing that you
  were wanted by the English police, I assisted you to make an escape? I am not
  a stickler for small things," he shrugged his shoulders, "and Senhor Maxilla
  did much that I closed my eyes to. Women came into his calculations, but
  murder never."</p>

  <p>"I am not a murderer, I tell you," stormed Digby vehemently, "and you are
  under my orders. Do you understand that?"</p>

  <p>He jumped up and stood menacingly above the unperturbed Brazilian, and in
  his hand had appeared an ugly-looking weapon.</p>

  <p>"You will carry out my instructions to the letter, or, by God, you'll know
  all about it!"</p>

  <p>But the captain of the Pealigo had returned to the contemplation of his
  cigar. He reminded Digby somewhat of Bronson, and the yellow-faced man
  shivered as at an unpleasant thought.</p>

  <p>"It is not the first time I have been threatened with a revolver," said
  the captain coolly. "Years ago when I was very young, such things might have
  frightened me, but to-day I am not young. I have a family in Brazil who are
  very expensive; my pay is small, otherwise I would not follow the sea and be
  every man's dog to kick and bully as he wishes. If I had a hundred thousand
  pounds, senhor, I should settle down on a plantation which I have bought and
  be a happy and a silent man for the rest of my life."</p>

  <p>He emphasized "silent," and Digby understood.</p>

  <p>"Couldn't you do that for a little less than a hundred thousand?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I have been thinking the matter out very carefully. We shipmen have
  plenty of time to think, and that is the conclusion that I have reached, that
  a hundred thousand pounds would make all the difference between a life of
  work and a life of ease." He was silent for a moment and then went on. "That
  is why I hesitated about the reward. If the radio had said a hundred thousand
  pounds, senhor, I should have been tempted."</p>

  <p>Digby turned on him with a snarl.</p>

  <p>"Talk straight, will you?" he said. "You want me to pay you a hundred
  thousand pounds, and that is the price for carrying me to safety; otherwise
  you will return to port and give me up."</p>

  <p>The captain shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I said nothing of the sort, senhor," he said. "I merely mentioned a
  little private matter in which I am glad to see you take an interest. The
  senhor also wishes for a happy life in Brazil with the beautiful lady he
  brought on board, and the senhor is not a poor man, and if it is true that
  the beautiful lady is an heiress, he could be richer."</p>

  <p>The operator looked in. He was anxious to come back to his own cabin, but
  the captain, with a jerk of his head, sent him out again.</p>

  <p>He dropped his voice a tone.</p>

  <p>"Would it not be possible for me to go to the young lady and say: 'Miss,
  you are in great danger, and I too am in danger of losing my liberty, what
  would you pay me to put a sentry outside your door; to place Senhor Digby
  Groat in irons, in the strong-room? Do you think she would say a hundred
  thousand pounds, or even a half of her fortune, senhor?"</p>

  <p>Digby was silent.</p>

  <p>The threat was real and definite. It was not camouflaged by any fine
  phrases; as plainly as the little Brazilian could state his demands, he had
  done so.</p>

  <p>"Very good." Digby got up from the edge of the table where he had sat,
  with downcast eyes, turning this and that and the other plan over in his
  mind. "I'll pay you."</p>

  <p>"Wait, wait," said the captain. "Because there is another alternative that
  I wish to put to you, senhor," he said. "Suppose that I am her friend, or
  pretend to be, and offer her protection until we reach a port where she can
  be landed? Should we not both receive a share of the great reward?"</p>

  <p>"I will not give her up," said Digby between his teeth. "You can cut that
  idea out of your head, and also the notion about putting me in irons. By God,
  if I thought you meant it - " He glowered at the little man, and the captain
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"Who means anything in this horrible climate?" he said lazily. "You will
  bring the money to-morrow to my cabin, perhaps - no, no, to-night," he said
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"You can have it to-morrow."</p>

  <p>The captain shrugged his shoulders; he did not insist, and Digby was left
  alone with his thoughts.</p>

  <p>There was still a hope; there were two. They could not prove that he shot
  Fuentes, and it would be a difficult matter to pick up the yacht if it
  followed the course that the captain had marked for it, and in the meantime
  there was Eunice. His lips twisted, and the colour came into his face.
  Eunice! He went along the deck and down the companion-way, but there was a
  man standing in the front of the door of the girl's cabin, a broad-shouldered
  brown-faced man, who touched his cap as the owner appeared, but did not
  budge.</p>

  <p>"Stand out of the way," said Digby impatiently. "I want to go into that
  room."</p>

  <p>"It is not permitted," said the sailor.</p>

  <p>Digby stepped back a pace, crimson with anger.</p>

  <p>"Who gave orders that I should not pass?"</p>

  <p>"The capitano," said the man.</p>

  <p>Digby flew up the companion-ladder and went in search of the captain. He
  found him on the bridge.</p>

  <p>"What is this?" he began, and the captain snapped something at him in
  Portuguese, and Digby, looking ahead, saw a white-fan-shaped light stealing
  along the sea.</p>

  <p>"It is a warship, and she may be engaged in manoeuvres," said the captain,
  "but she may also be looking for us."</p>

  <p>He gave an order, and suddenly all the lights on the ship were
  extinguished. The Pealigo swung round in a semicircle and headed back the way
  she had come.</p>

  <p>"We can make a detour and get past her," explained the captain, and Digby
  forgot the sentry at the door in the distress of this new danger.</p>

  <p>Left and right wheeled the searchlight, but never once did it touch the
  Pealigo. It was searching for her, though they must have seen her lights, and
  now the big white ray was groping at the spot where the yacht had turned. It
  missed them by yards.</p>

  <p>"Where are we going?" asked Digby fretfully.</p>

  <p>"We are going back for ten miles, and then we'll strike between the ship
  and Ireland, which is there." He pointed to the horizon, where a splash of
  light trembled for a second and was gone.</p>

  <p>"We are losing valuable time," said Digby fretfully.</p>

  <p>"It is better to lose time than to lose your liberty," said the
  philosophical captain.</p>

  <p>Digby clutched the rail and his heart turned to water, as the searchlight
  of the warship again swung round. But fortune was with them. It might, as the
  captain said, be only a ship carrying out searchlight practice, but on the
  other hand, in view of the wireless messages which had been received, it
  seemed certain that the cruiser had a special reason for its scrutiny.</p>

  <p>It was not until they were out of the danger zone that Digby remembered
  the mission that had brought him to the bridge.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by putting a man on guard outside that girl's door?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>The captain had gone to the deckhouse, and was bending over the table
  examining an Admiralty chart. He did not answer until Digby had repeated the
  question, then he looked up and straightened his back.</p>

  <p>"The future of the lady is dependent, entirely, on the fulfilment of your
  promise, illustrious," he said in the flamboyant terminology of his
  motherland.</p>

  <p>"But I promised - "</p>

  <p>"You have not performed."</p>

  <p>"Do you doubt my words?" stormed Digby.</p>

  <p>"I do not doubt, but I do not understand," said the captain. "If you will
  come to my cabin I will settle with you."</p>

  <p>Digby thought a while; his interest in Eunice had evaporated with the
  coming of this new danger, and there was no reason why he should settle that
  night. Suppose he was captured, the money would be wasted. It would be
  useless to him also, but this, in his parsimonious way, did not influence
  him.</p>

  <p>He went down to his cabin, a smaller and less beautifully furnished one
  than that occupied by Eunice, and pulling an arm-chair to the neat little
  desk, he sat down to think matters over. And as the hours passed, his
  perspective shifted. Somehow, the danger seemed very remote, and Eunice was
  very near, and if any real danger came, why, there would be an end of all
  things, Eunice included, and his money would be of no more value to him than
  the spray which flapped against the closed porthole.</p>

  <p>Beneath the bureau was a small, strong safe, and this he unlocked, taking
  out the broad money-belt which he had fastened about his waist before he
  began the journey. He emptied one bulging pocket, and laid a wad of bills
  upon the desk. They were gold bonds of ten thousand dollar denomination, and
  he counted forty, put the remainder back in the pocket from whence he had
  taken it, and locked the belt in the safe.</p>

  <p>It was half-past five and the grey of the new day showed through the
  portholes. He thrust the money in his pocket and went out to talk to the
  captain.</p>

  <p>He shivered in the chill wind of morning as he stepped out on the deck and
  made his way for'ard. The little Brazilian, a grotesque figure, wrapped in
  his overcoat and muffled to the chin, was standing moodily staring across the
  grey waste. Without a word Digby stepped up to him and thrust the bundle of
  notes into his hand. The Brazilian looked at the money, counted it
  mechanically, and put it into his pocket. "Your Excellency is munificent," he
  said. "Now take your sentry from the door," said Digby sharply.</p>

  <p>"Wait here," said the captain, and went below. He returned in a few
  minutes.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch47"
     name="ch47"></a>CHAPTER 47</h2>

  <p class="first">SHE had heard the tap of her first visitor at one o'clock in
  the morning. It had come when Digby Groat was sitting in his cabin turning
  over the possibilities of misfortune which the future held, and she had
  thought it was he.</p>

  <p>The handle of the door turned and it opened an inch; beyond that it could
  not go without a crash, for the chairs and tables that Eunice had piled
  against it. She watched with a stony face and despair in her heart, as the
  opening of the door increased.</p>

  <p>"Please do not be afraid," said a voice.</p>

  <p>Then it was not Digby! She sprang to her feet. It might be some one worse,
  but that was impossible.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"It is I, the captain," said a voice in laboured English.</p>

  <p>"What is it you want?"</p>

  <p>"I wish to speak to you, mademoiselle, but you must put away these things
  from behind the door, otherwise I will call two of my sailors, and it will be
  a simple matter to push them aside."</p>

  <p>Already he had prized open the door to the extent of two or three inches,
  and with a groan Eunice realized the futility of her barricade. She dragged
  the furniture aside and the little captain came in smiling, hat in hand,
  closing the door after him.</p>

  <p>"Permit me, mademoiselle," he said politely, and moved her aside while he
  replaced the furniture; then he opened the door and looked out, and Eunice
  saw that there was a tall sailor standing with his back to her, evidently on
  guard. What did this mean? she wondered. The captain did not leave her long
  in ignorance.</p>

  <p>"Lady," he said in an accent which it was almost impossible to reproduce,
  "I am a poor sailor-man who works at his hazardous calling for two hundred
  miserable milreis a month. But because I am poor, and of humble - " he
  hesitated and used the Portuguese word for origin - which she guessed at -
  "it does not mean that I am without a heart." He struck his breast violently.
  "I have a repugnancio to hurting female women!"</p>

  <p>She was wondering what was coming next: would he offer to sell his master
  at a price? If he did, she would gladly agree, but the new hope which surged
  up within her was dissipated by his next words.</p>

  <p>"My friend Groat," he said, "is my master. I must obey his orders, and if
  he says 'Go to Callio,' or to Rio de Janeiro, I must go."</p>

  <p>Her hopes sunk, but evidently he had something more to say.</p>

  <p>"As the captain I must do as I am told," he said, "but I cannot and will
  not see a female hurted. You understand?"</p>

  <p>She nodded, and the spark of hope kindled afresh.</p>

  <p>"I myself cannot be here all the time, nor can my inconquerable sailors,
  to see that you are not hurted, and it would look bad for me if you were
  hurted - very bad!"</p>

  <p>Evidently the worthy captain was taking a very far-sighted view of the
  situation, and had hit upon a compromise which relieved him at least of his
  responsibility toward his master.</p>

  <p>"If the young lady will take this, remembering that Jose Montigano was the
  good friend of hers, I shall be repaid."</p>

  <p>"This" was a silvery weapon. She took the weapon in her hand with a glad
  cry.</p>

  <p>"Oh, thank you, thank you, captain," she said, seizing his hand.</p>

  <p>"Remember," he raised a warning finger. "I cannot do more. I speak now as
  man to woman. Presently I speak as captain to owner. You understand the
  remarkable difference?"</p>

  <p>He confused her a little, but she could guess what he meant.</p>

  <p>He bowed and made his exit, but presently he returned.</p>

  <p>"To put the chairs and tables against the floor is no use," he said,
  shaking his head. "It is better - " He pointed significantly to the revolver,
  and with a broad grin closed the door behind him.</p>

  <p>Digby Groat knew nothing of this visit: it satisfied him that the sentry
  had been withdrawn, and that now nothing stood between him and the woman
  whom, in his distorted, evil way, he loved, but her own frail strength. He
  tapped again. It pleased him to observe these threadbare conventions for the
  time being, yet when no answer came to his knock, he opened the door slowly
  and walked in.</p>

  <p>Eunice was standing at the far end of the cabin; the silken curtains had
  been drawn aside, and the door leading to her sitting saloon was open. Her
  hands were behind her and she was fully dressed.</p>

  <p>"My dear," said Digby, in his most expansive manner, "why are you tiring
  your pretty eyes? You should have been in bed and asleep."</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"What else could a man want, who had such a beautiful wife, but the
  pleasure of her conversation and companionship," he said with an air of
  gaiety.</p>

  <p>"Stand where you are," she called sharply as he advanced, and the
  authority in her tone made him halt.</p>

  <p>"Now, Eunice," he said, shaking his head, "you are making a lot of trouble
  when trouble is foolish. You have only to be sensible, and there is nothing
  in the world that I will not give you."</p>

  <p>"There is nothing in the world that you have to give, except the money
  which you have stolen from me," she said calmly. "Why do you talk of giving,
  when I am the giver, and there is nothing for you to take but my mercy?"</p>

  <p>He stared at her, stricken dumb by the coolness at the moment of her most
  deadly danger, and then with a laugh he recovered his self-possession and
  strolled towards her, his dark eyes aflame.</p>

  <p>"Stand where you are," said Eunice again, and this time she had the means
  to enforce her command.</p>

  <p>Digby could only stare at the muzzle of the pistol pointed towards his
  heart, and then he shrank back.</p>

  <p>"Put that thing away!" he said harshly. "Damn you, put it away! You are
  not used to fire-arms, and it may explode."</p>

  <p>"It will explode," said Eunice. Her voice was deep and intense, and all
  the resentment she had smothered poured forth in her words. "I tell you,
  Digby Groat, that I will shoot you like a dog, and glory in the act. Shoot
  you more mercilessly than you killed that poor Spaniard, and look upon your
  body with less horror than you showed."</p>

  <p>"Put it away, put it away! Where did you get it?" he cried. "For God's
  sake, Eunice, don't fool with that pistol; you don't want to kill me, do
  you?"</p>

  <p>"There are times when I want to kill you very badly," she said, and
  lowered the point of the revolver at the sight of the man's abject
  cowardice.</p>

  <p>He wiped his forehead with a silk handkerchief, and she could see his
  knees trembling.</p>

  <p>"Who gave you that pistol?" he demanded violently. "You didn't have it
  when you left Kennett Hall, that I'll swear. Where did you find it? In one of
  those drawers?" He looked at the bureau, one of the drawers of which was half
  open.</p>

  <p>"Does it matter?" she asked. "Now, Mr. Groat, you will please go out of my
  cabin and leave me in peace."</p>

  <p>"I had no intention of hurting you," he growled. He was still very pale.
  "There was no need for you to flourish your revolver so melodramatically. I
  only came in to say good night."</p>

  <p>"You might have come about six hours earlier," she said. "Now go."</p>

  <p>"Listen to me, Eunice," said Digby Groat; he edged forward, but her pistol
  covered him, and he jumped. "If you're going to play the fool, I'll go," he
  said, and followed the action by the deed, slamming the door behind him.</p>

  <p>She heard the outer door open and close, and leant against the brass
  column of the bed for support, for she was near to the end of her courage.
  She must sleep, she thought, but first she must secure the outer door. There
  was a lock on the lobby door; she had not noticed that before. She had hardly
  taken two steps through the cabin door before an arm was flung round her, she
  was pressed back, and a hand gripped the wrist which still carried the
  weapon. With a wrench he flung it to the floor, and in another moment she was
  in his arms.</p>

  <p>"You thought I'd gone " - he lifted her, still struggling, and carried her
  back to the saloon. "I want to see you," he breathed; "to see your face, your
  glorious eyes, that wonderful mouth of yours, Eunice." He pressed his lips
  against hers; he smothered with kisses her cheeks, her neck, her eyes.</p>

  <p>She felt herself slipping from consciousness; the very horror of his
  caresses froze and paralysed her will to struggle. She could only gaze at the
  eyes so close to hers, fascinated as by the glare of the deadly snake.</p>

  <p>"You are mine now, mine, do you hear?" he murmured into her ear. "You will
  forget Jim Steele, forget everything except that I adore you," and then he
  saw her wild gaze pass him to the door, and turned.</p>

  <p>The little captain stood there, his hands on his hips, watching, his brown
  face a mask.</p>

  <p>Digby released his hold of the girl, and turned on the sailor.</p>

  <p>"What the hell are you doing here? Get out," he almost screamed.</p>

  <p>"There is an aeroplane looking for us," said the captain. "We have just
  picked up her wireless."</p>

  <p>Digby's jaw dropped. That possibility had not occurred to him.</p>

  <p>"Who is she? What does the wireless say?"</p>

  <p>"It is a message we picked up saying, 'Nothing sighted. Am heading due
  south.' It gave her position," added the captain, "and if she is coming due
  south I think Mr. Steele will find us."</p>

  <p>Digby fell back a pace, his face blanched.</p>

  <p>"Steele," he gasped.</p>

  <p>The captain nodded.</p>

  <p>"That is the gentleman who signs the message. I think it would be
  advisable for you to come on deck."</p>

  <p>"I'll come on deck when I want," growled Digby. There was a devil in him
  now. He was at the end of his course, and he was not to be thwarted.</p>

  <p>"Will the good gentleman come on deck?"</p>

  <p>"I will come later. I have some business to attend to here."</p>

  <p>"You can attend to it on deck," said the little captain calmly.</p>

  <p>"Get out," shouted Digby.</p>

  <p>The captain's hand did not seem to move; there was a shot, the deafening
  explosion of which filled the cabin, and a panel behind Digby's head
  splintered into a thousand pieces.</p>

  <p>He glared at the revolver in the Brazilian's hand, unable to realize what
  had happened.</p>

  <p>"I could have shot you just as easily," said the Brazilian calmly, "but I
  preferred to send the little bullet near your ear. Will you come on deck,
  please?"</p>

  <p>Digby Groat obeyed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch48"
     name="ch48"></a>CHAPTER 48</h2>

  <p class="first">WHITE and breathless he leant against the bulwark glowering
  at the Brazilian, who had come between him and the woman whose rum he had
  planned.</p>

  <p>"Now," he said, "you will tell me what you mean by this, you swine!"</p>

  <p>"I will tell you many things that you will not like to hear," said the
  captain.</p>

  <p>A light dawned upon Digby.</p>

  <p>"Did you give the girl that revolver?"</p>

  <p>The Brazilian nodded.</p>

  <p>"I desired to save you from yourself, my friend," he said. "In an hour the
  gentleman Steele will be within sight of us; I can tell where he is within a
  few miles. Do you wish that he should come on board and discover that you
  have added something to murder that is worse than murder?"</p>

  <p>"That is my business," said Digby Groat, breathing so quickly that he felt
  he would suffocate unless the pent-up rage in him found some vent.</p>

  <p>"And mine," said the captain, tapping him on the chest. "I tell you, my
  fine fellow, that that is my business also, for I do not intend to live
  within an English gaol. It is too cold in England and I would not survive one
  winter. No, my fine fellow, there is only one thing to do. It is to run due
  west in the hope that we escape the observation of the airship man; if we do
  not, then we are - " He snapped his fingers.</p>

  <p>"Do as you like," said Digby, and turning abruptly walked down to his
  cabin.</p>

  <p>He was beaten, and the end was near. He took from a drawer a small bottle
  of colourless liquid, and emptied its contents into a glass. This he placed
  in a rack conveniently to his hand. The effect would not be violent. One
  gulp, and he would pass to sleep and there the matter would end for him. That
  was a comforting thought to Digby Groat.</p>

  <p>If they escaped -! His mind turned to Eunice. She could wait; perhaps they
  would dodge through all these guards that the police had put, and they would
  reach that land for which he yearned. He could not expect the captain, after
  receiving the wireless messages of warning, to take the risks. He was playing
  for safety, thought Digby, and did not wholly disapprove of the man's
  attitude.</p>

  <p>When they were on the high seas away from the ocean traffic, the little
  Brazilian would change his attitude, and then - Digby nodded. The captain was
  wise; it would have been madness on his part to force the issue so soon.</p>

  <p>Eunice could not get away; they were moving in the same direction to a
  common destination, and there were weeks, hot and sunny weeks, when they
  could sit under the awning on this beautiful yacht and talk. He would be
  rational and drop that cave-man method of wooing. A week's proximity and
  freedom from restraint might make all the difference in the world, if -!
  There was a big if, he recognized. Steele would not rest until he had found
  him, but by that time Eunice might be a complacent partner.</p>

  <p>He felt a little more cheerful, locked away the glass and its contents in
  a cupboard, and strolled up to the deck. He saw the ship now for the first
  time in daylight, and it was a model of what a yacht should be. The deck was
  snowy white; every piece of brass-work glittered, the coiled sheets looked to
  have been dipped in chalk, and under that identical awning great basket
  chairs awaited him invitingly.</p>

  <p>He glanced round the horizon; there was no ship in sight. The sea sparkled
  in the rays of the sun, and over the white wake of the steamer lay a deep
  black pall of smoke, for the Pealigo was racing forward at twenty-two knots
  an hour. The captain, at any rate, was not playing him false. He was heading
  west, judged Digby.</p>

  <p>Far away on the right was an irregular purple strip, the line of the Irish
  coast; the only traffic they would meet now, he considered, was the
  western-bound steamers on the New York route. But the only sign of a steamer
  was a blob of smoke on the far-off eastern horizon.</p>

  <p>The chairs invited him, and he sat down and stretched his legs
  luxuriously.</p>

  <p>Yes, this was a better plan, he thought, and as his mind turned again to
  Eunice, she appeared at the head of the companion-way. At first she did not
  see him, and walking to the rail, seemed to be breathing in the beauties of
  the morning.</p>

  <p>How exquisite she looked! He did not remember seeing a woman who held
  herself as she did. The virginal purity of her face, the glory of her
  colouring, the svelte woman figure of her - they were worth waiting for, he
  told himself again.</p>

  <p>She turned her head and saw him and made a movement as though she were
  going back to her cabin, but he beckoned to her, and to his surprise, she
  walked slowly toward him.</p>

  <p>"Don't get up," she said coldly. "I can find a chair myself. I want to
  speak to you, Mr. Groat."</p>

  <p>"You want to speak to me," he said in amazement, and she nodded.</p>

  <p>"I have been thinking that perhaps I can induce you to turn this yacht
  about and land me in England."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you have, have you?" he said sharply. "What inducement can you offer
  other than your gracious self?"</p>

  <p>"Money," she answered. "I do not know by what miracle it has happened, but
  I believe I am an heiress, and worth" - she hesitated - "a great deal of
  money. If that is the case, Mr. Groat, you are poor."</p>

  <p>"I'm not exactly a pauper," he said, apparently amused. "What are you
  offering me?"</p>

  <p>"I'm offering you half my fortune to take me back to England," she
  said.</p>

  <p>"And what would you do with the other half of your fortune?" he mocked
  her. "Save me from the gallows? No, no, my young friend, I have committed
  myself too deeply to make your plan even feasible. I'm not going to bother
  you again, and I promise you I will wait until we have reached our
  destination before I ask you to share my lot. I appreciate your offer and I
  dare say it is an honest one," he went on, "but I have gone too far literally
  and figuratively to turn back. You hate me now, but that feeling will
  change."</p>

  <p>"It will never change," she said as she rose. "But I see that I am wasting
  my time with you," and with a little nod, she would have gone had he not
  caught her hand and drawn her back.</p>

  <p>"You love somebody else, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"That is an impertinence," she said. "You have no right to question
  me."</p>

  <p>"I am not questioning you, I am merely making a statement which is beyond
  dispute. You love somebody else, and that somebody is Jim Steele." He leant
  forward. "You can make up your mind for this, that sooner than give you to
  Jim Steele, I will kill you. Is that plain?"</p>

  <p>"It is the kindest thing you have said," she smiled contemptuously as she
  rose.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch49"
     name="ch49"></a>CHAPTER 49</h2>

  <p class="first">A LITTLE smudge of smoke far away to the south, sent Jim
  Steele racing away on a fool's errand, for the ship proved to be nothing more
  interesting than a fruit-boat which had ignored his wireless inquiry because
  the only man who operated the instrument was asleep in his bunk. Jim saw the
  character of the ship when he was within two miles of it, and banked over,
  cutting a diagonal course north-west.</p>

  <p>Once or twice he glanced back at his "passenger," but Inspector Maynard
  was thoroughly at home and apparently comfortable.</p>

  <p>Jim was growing anxious. At the longest he could not keep in the air for
  more than four hours, and two of those precious hours were already gone. He
  must leave himself sufficient "juice" to make the land and this new zigzag
  must not occupy more than half an hour.</p>

  <p>He had purposely taken the machine to a great height to enlarge his field
  of vision, and that meant a still further burden upon his limited supply of
  petrol.</p>

  <p>He was almost despairing when he saw in the far distance a tiny white
  arrow of foam - the ship whose wake it was he could not see. His hand strayed
  to the key of his little wireless and he sent a message quivering through the
  ether. There was no response. He waited a minute and again the key clattered
  and clicked. Again a silence and he flashed an angry message. Then through
  his ear-pieces he heard a shrill wail of sound - the steamer was
  responding.</p>

  <p>"What ship is that?"</p>

  <p>He waited, never doubting that he would learn it was some small merchant
  vessel. There was a whine, and then:</p>

  <p>"P-E-A-L-I-G-O," was the reply.</p>

  <p>* * *</p>

  <p>Digby had gone forward to see what the men were doing who were swung over
  the side. He was delighted to discover that they were painting out the word
  Pealigo and were substituting Malaga. He went up to the captain in his most
  amiable mood.</p>

  <p>"That is a good thought of yours," he said, "changing the name, I
  mean."</p>

  <p>The captain nodded.</p>

  <p>"By your orders, of course," he said.</p>

  <p>"Of course," smiled Digby, "by my orders."</p>

  <p>All the time he was standing there chatting to the Brazilian he noticed
  that the man constantly turned his eyes to the north, scanning the sky.</p>

  <p>"You don't think that the aeroplane will come so far out, do you? How far
  are we from the coast?"</p>

  <p>"We are a hundred and twelve miles from the English coast," said the
  skipper, "and that isn't any great distance for a seaplane."</p>

  <p>Digby with unusual joviality slapped him on the back.</p>

  <p>"You are getting nervous," he said. "He won't come now."</p>

  <p>A man had come on to the bridge whom Digby recognized as the wireless
  operator. He handed a message to the captain, and he saw the captain's face
  change.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" he asked quickly.</p>

  <p>Without a word the man handed the written slip.</p>

  <p>"Ship heading south, send me your name and number."</p>

  <p>"Who is it from?" asked Digby, startled at this voice from nowhere.</p>

  <p>The captain, supporting his telescope against a stanchion, scanned the
  northern skies.</p>

  <p>"I see nothing," he said with a frown. "Possibly it came from one of the
  land stations; there is no ship in sight."</p>

  <p>"Let us ask him who he is," said Digby.</p>

  <p>The three went back to the wireless room and the operator adjusted his
  ear-pieces. Presently he began writing, after a glance up at the captain, and
  Digby watched fascinated the movements of the pencil.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Heave to. I am coming aboard you."</p>

  <p>The captain went out on the deck and again made a careful examination of
  the sky.</p>

  <p>"I can't understand it," he said.</p>

  <p>"The signal was close, senhor captain - it was less than three miles
  away," broke in the operator.</p>

  <p>The captain rubbed his nose.</p>

  <p>"I had better stop," he said.</p>

  <p>"You'll do nothing of the kind," stormed Digby. "You'll go on until I tell
  you to stop."</p>

  <p>They returned to the bridge, and the captain stood with one hand on the
  telegraph, undecided.</p>

  <p>And then right ahead of them, less than half a mile away, something fell
  into the water with a splash.</p>

  <p>"What was that?" said Digby.</p>

  <p>He was answered immediately. From the place where the splashing had
  occurred arose a great mass of billowing smoke which sped along the sea,
  presenting an impenetrable veil. Smoke was rising from the sea to their
  right, and the captain, shading his eyes, looked up. Directly over them it
  seemed was a silvery shape, so small as to be almost invisible if the sun had
  not caught the wing-tips and painted them silver.</p>

  <p>"This, my friend," said the captain, "is where many things happen." He
  jerked over the telegraph to stop.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" asked Digby.</p>

  <p>"It was a smoke-bomb, and I prefer a smoke-bomb half a mile away to a real
  bomb on my beautiful ship," said the captain.</p>

  <p>For a moment Digby stared at him, and then with a scream of rage he sprang
  at the telegraph and thrust it over to full-ahead. Immediately he was seized
  from behind by two sailors, and the captain brought the telegraph back to its
  original position.</p>

  <p>"You will signal to the senhor aviator, to whom you have already told the
  name of the ship, if you have obeyed my orders," he said to the operator,
  "and say that I have put Mr. Digby Groat in irons!"</p>

  <p>And five minutes later this statement was nearly true.</p>

  <p>Down from the blue dropped that silvery dragon-fly, first sweeping round
  the stationary vessel in great circles until it settled like a bird upon the
  water close to the yacht's side.</p>

  <p>The captain had already lowered a boat, and whilst they were fixing the
  shackles on a man who was behaving like a raving madman in his cabin below,
  Jim Steele came lightly up the side of the ship and followed the captain down
  the companion-way.</p>

  <p>Above the rumble of the yacht's machinery Eunice had heard the faint buzz
  of the descending seaplane, but had been unable to distinguish it until the
  yacht stopped, then she heard it plainly enough and ran to the porthole,
  pulling aside the silk curtain.</p>

  <p>Yes, there it was, a buzzing insect of a thing, that presently passed out
  of sight on the other side. What did it mean? What did it mean? she wondered.
  Was it - and then the door flew open and a man stood there. He was without
  collar or waistcoat, his hair was rumpled, his face bleeding, and one link of
  a steel handcuff was fastened about his wrist. It was Digby Groat, and his
  face was the face of a devil.</p>

  <p>She shrank back against the bed as he came stealthily toward her, the
  light of madness in his eyes, and then somebody else came in, and he swung
  round to meet the cold level scrutiny of Jim Steele.</p>

  <p>With a yell like a wild beast, Digby sprang at the man he hated, but the
  whirling steel of the manacle upon his hand never struck home. Twice Jim hit
  him, and he fell an inert heap on the ground. In another second Eunice was in
  her lover's arms, sobbing her joy upon the breast of his leather jacket.</p>
