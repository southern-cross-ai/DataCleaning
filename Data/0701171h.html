  <h2><a name="ch1"
     id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

  <p class="first">THE establishment of Yeh Ling was just between the desert of
  Reed Street and the sown of that great and glittering thoroughfare which is
  theatreland. The desert graduated down from the respectable, if gloomy,
  houses where innumerable milliners, modistes, and dentists had their signs
  before the doors and their workrooms and clinics on divers landings, to the
  howling wilderness of Bennet Street, and in this particular case the
  description often applied so lightly is aptly and faithfully affixed, for
  Bennet Street howled by day and howled in a shriller key by night. Its
  roadway was a playground for the progeny of this prolific neighbourhood, and
  a "ring" in which all manner of local blood-feuds were settled by waist-bare
  men, whilst their slatternly women squealed their encouragement or vocalized
  their apprehensions.</p>

  <p>Yeh Ling's restaurant had begun at the respectable end of the street and
  he had specialized in strange Chinese dishes.</p>

  <p>Later it had crept nearer and nearer and nearer to The Lights, one house
  after another having been acquired by the unhappy-looking Oriental, its
  founder.</p>

  <p>Then, with a rush, it arrived on the main street, acquired a rich but
  sedate facia, a French chef, and a staff of Italian waiters under the popular
  Signor Maciduino, most urbane of maitres d'hotel, and because of gilded and
  visible tiles, became "The Golden Roof." Beneath those tiles it was a place
  of rosewood panelling and soft shaded lights. There was a gilded elevator to
  carry you to the first and second floors where the private dining-rooms
  were--these had doors of plate-glass, curtained diaphanously. Yeh Ling
  thought that this was carrying respectability a little too far, but his
  patron was adamant on the matter.</p>

  <p>Certain rooms had no plate-glass doors, but these were very discreetly
  apportioned. One such was never under any circumstances hired to diners,
  however important or impeccable they might be. It was the end room, No. 6,
  near the service doorway which led through a labyrinth of crooked and cross
  passages to the old building in Reed Street. This remained almost unchanged
  as it had been in the days of Yeh Ling's earlier struggles. Men and women
  came here for Chinese dishes and were supplied by soft-footed waiters from
  Han-Kow, which was Yeh Ling's native province.</p>

  <p>The patrons of the old establishment lamented the arrival of Yeh Ling's
  prosperity and sneered at his well-dressed customers. The well-dressed
  customers being, for the most part, entirely ignorant that their humble
  neighbours had existence, ate their expensive meals unmoved and at certain
  hours danced sedately to the strains of The Old Original South Carolina
  Syncopated Orchestra, which Yeh Ling had hired regardless of expense.</p>

  <p>He only visited the fashionable part of his property on one day of the
  year, the Chinese New Year, a queer little figure in a swallow-tailed coat,
  white-vested, white-gloved, and tightly, as well as whitely, collared.</p>

  <p>At other times he sat at ease midway between the desert and the sown in a
  pokey little parlour hung about with vivid pictures which he had cut from the
  covers of magazines. Here, in a black silk robe, he pulled at his
  long-stemmed pipe. At half-past seven every night, except Sundays, he went to
  a door which opened on to the street, and was the door of one of those houses
  which linked the two restaurants, and here he would wait, his hand upon the
  knob. Sometimes the girl came first, sometimes the old man. Whichever it was,
  they usually passed in without a word and went up to Room No. 6. With their
  arrival Yeh Ling went back to his parlour to smoke and write letters of great
  length and beauty to his son at Han-Kow, for Yeh Ling's son was a man of
  great learning and position, being both a poet and a scholar. He had been
  admitted a member of the Forest of Pencils, which is at least the equivalent
  of being elected an Academician.</p>

  <p>Sometimes Yeh Ling would devote himself to the matter of his new building
  at Shanford and dream dreams of an Excellency who would be its honoured
  master--for all things are possible in a land which makes education a test of
  choice for Ambassadorial appointments.</p>

  <p>He never saw the two guests depart. They found their way to the door
  alone, and soon after eight the room was empty, No waiter served them; their
  meals were placed in readiness on a small buffet, and as No. 6 was veiled
  from the observations of the curious by a curtain which stretched across the
  passage, only Yeh Ling knew them.</p>

  <p>On the first Monday of every month, Yeh Ling went up to the room and
  kow-towed to its solitary occupant. The old man was always alone on these
  occasions. On such a Monday with a large lacquered cash-box in his hand and a
  fat book under his arm, Yeh Ling entered the presence of the man in No. 6,
  put down his impedimenta on the buffet, and did his reverence.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," said Jesse Trasmere, and he spoke in the sibilant dialect of
  the lower provinces. Yeh Ling obeyed, hiding his hands respectfully in the
  full sleeves of his gown.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"The profits this week have fallen, excellency," said Yeh Ling, but
  without apology. "The weather has been very fine and many of our clients are
  out of town."</p>

  <p>He exposed his hands to open the cash-box and bring out four packages of
  paper money. These he divided into two, three of the packages to the right
  and one to the left. The old man took the three packages, which were nearest
  to him, and grunted.</p>

  <p>"The police came last night and asked to be shown over the houses," Yeh
  Ling went on impassively. "They desired to see the cellars, because they
  think always that Chinamen have smoke-places in their cellars."</p>

  <p>"Humph!" said Mr. Trasmere. He was thumbing the money in his hand. "This
  is good, Yeh Ling."</p>

  <p>He slipped the money into a black bag which was on the floor at his feet.
  Yeh Ling shook his head, thereby indicating his agreement.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember in Fi Sang a man who worked for me?"</p>

  <p>"The Drinker?"</p>

  <p>The old man agreed to the appellation.</p>

  <p>"He is coming to this country," said Mr. Trasmere, chewing on a
  tooth-pick. He was a hard-faced man between sixty and seventy. A rusty black
  frock-coat ill fitted his spare form, his old-fashioned collar was frayed at
  the edge, and the black shoe-string tie that encircled his lean throat had
  been so long in use that it had lost whatever rigidity it had ever possessed,
  and hung limp in two tangled bunches on either side of the knot. His eyes
  were a hard granite blue, his face ridged and scaled with callosities until
  it was lizard-like in its coarseness.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he is coming to this country. He will come here as soon as he finds
  his way about town, and that will be mighty soon, for Wellington Brown is a
  traveller! Yeh Ling, this man is troublesome. I should be happy if he were
  sleeping on the Terraces of the Night."</p>

  <p>Again Yeh Ling shook his head.</p>

  <p>"He cannot be killed--here," he said. "The illustrious knows that my hands
  are clean--"</p>

  <p>"Are you a man--or--wild-mind?" snarled the other. "Do I kill men or ask
  that they should be killed? Even on the Amur, where life is cheap, I have
  done no more than put a man to the torture because he stole my gold. No, this
  Drinker must be made quiet. He smokes the pipe of the Pleasant Experience.
  You have no pipe-room. I would not tolerate such a thing. But you know
  places..."</p>

  <p>"I know a hundred and a hundred," said Yeh Ling, cheerfully for him.</p>

  <p>He accompanied his master to the door, and when it had closed upon him he
  returned swiftly to his parlour and summoned a stunted man of his race.</p>

  <p>"Go after the old man and see that no harm comes to him," he said.</p>

  <p>It seemed from his tone almost as though this guardianship was novel, but
  in exactly the same words the shuffling Chinaman had received identical
  instructions every day for six years when the thud of the closing street-door
  came to Yeh Ling's keen ears. Every day except Sunday.</p>

  <p>He himself never went out after Jesse Trasmere. He had other duties, which
  commenced at eleven and usually kept him busy until the early hours of the
  morning.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2"
     id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

  <p class="first">MR. TRASMERE walked steadily and at one pace, keeping to the
  more populous streets. Then at exactly 8.25 he turned into Peak Avenue, that
  wide and pleasant thoroughfare where his house was situated. A man who had
  been idling away a wasted half-hour saw him and crossed the road.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, Mr. Trasmere."</p>

  <p>Jesse shot a scowling glance at the interrupter of his reveries. The
  stranger was young and a head taller than the old man, well dressed,
  remarkably confident.</p>

  <p>"Eh?"</p>

  <p>"You don't remember me--Holland? I called upon you about a year ago over
  the trouble you had with the municipality."</p>

  <p>Jesse's face cleared.</p>

  <p>"The reporter? Yes, I remember you. You had an article in your rag that
  was all wrong, sir--all wrong! You made me say that I had a respect for
  municipal laws, and that's a lie! I have no respect for municipal laws or
  lawyers. They're thieves and grafters!"</p>

  <p>He thumped the ferrule of his umbrella on the ground to emphasize his
  disapproval.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't be surprised," said the young man, with a cheerful smile;
  "and if I made you toss around a few bouquets, that was faire bonne mine. I'd
  forgotten anyway, but it is the job of an interviewer to make his subject
  look good."</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you want?"</p>

  <p>"Our correspondent in Pekin has sent us the original proclamation of the
  insurgent, General Wing Su--or Sing Wu, I'm not sure which. These Chinese
  names get me rattled."</p>

  <p>Tab Holland produced from his pocket a sheet of yellow paper covered with
  strange characters.</p>

  <p>"We can't get in touch with our interpreters, and knowing that you are a
  whale--an authority on the language, the news-editor wondered if you would be
  so kind."</p>

  <p>Jesse took the sheet reluctantly, gripped his bag between his knees, and
  put on his glasses.</p>

  <p>"'Wing Su Shi, by the favour of heaven, humbly before his ancestors,
  speaks to all men of the Middle Kingdom...'" he began.</p>

  <p>Tab, note-book in hand, wrote rapidly as the old man translated.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir," he said when the other had finished.</p>

  <p>There was an odd smirk of satisfaction on the old man's face, a strange,
  childlike pride in his accomplishment. "You have a remarkable knowledge of
  the language," said Tab politely.</p>

  <p>"Born there," replied Jesse Trasmere complacently: "born in a go-down on
  the Amur River and could speak the three dialects before I was six. Beat the
  whole lot of 'em at their own books when I was so high! That all,
  mister?"</p>

  <p>"That is all, and thank you," said Tab gravely, and lifted his hat.</p>

  <p>He stood looking after the old man as he continued his walk. So that was
  Rex Lander's miserly uncle? He did not look like a millionaire, and yet, when
  he came to consider the matter, millionaires seldom looked their wealth.</p>

  <p>He had settled the matter of the Wing Su proclamation and was immersed in
  a new Prison Report which had been published that day when he remembered an
  item of news which had come his way, and duly reported.</p>

  <p>"Sorry, Tab," said the night-editor, "the theatre man has 'flu. Won't you
  go along and see the lady?"</p>

  <p>Tab snorted, but went.</p>

  <p>The dresser, hesitating, thought that Miss Ardfern was rather tired, and
  wouldn't to-morrow do?</p>

  <p>"I'm tired, too," said Tab Holland wearily; "and tell Miss Ardfern that I
  haven't come to this darned theatre at eleven p.m. because I'm an autograph
  hunter, or because I'm collecting pictures of actresses I'm crazy about; I'm
  here in the sacred cause of publicity."</p>

  <p>To the dresser, he was as a man who spoke a foreign language. Surveying
  him dubiously she turned the handle of the stained yellow door, and standing
  in the opening, talked to somebody invisible.</p>

  <p>Tab had a glimpse of cretonne hangings, yawned, and scratched his head. He
  was not without elegance, except in moments of utter tiredness.</p>

  <p>"You can come in," said the dresser, and Tab passed into a room that
  blazed with unshaded lights.</p>

  <p>Ursula Ardfern had made her change and was ready to leave the theatre,
  except that her jacket was still hung on the back of one chair and her cloth
  cloak with the blue satin lining was draped over another. She had in her hand
  a brooch which she was about to put into an open jewel-case. Tab particularly
  noticed the brooch. A heart-shaped ruby was its centre piece.</p>

  <p>He saw her pin it to the soft lining of the lid and close the case.</p>

  <p>"I'm extremely sorry to worry you at this hour of the night, Miss
  Ardfern," he said apologetically, "and if you're annoyed with me, you have my
  passionate sympathy. And if you're not mad at me, I'd be glad of a little
  sympathy myself, for I've been in court all day following the Lachmere fraud
  trial."</p>

  <p>She had been a little annoyed. The set of her pretty face told him that
  when he came in.</p>

  <p>"And now you've come for another trial," she half-smiled. "What can I do
  for you, Mr.--?"</p>

  <p>"Holland--Somers Holland of The Megaphone. The theatre reporter is sick,
  and we got a rumour to-night from two independent sources that you are to be
  married."</p>

  <p>"And you came to tell me! Now, isn't that kind of you!" she mocked. "No, I
  am not going to be married. I don't think I ever shall marry; but you needn't
  put that in the newspaper, or people will think I am posing as an eccentric.
  Who is the lucky man, by the way?"</p>

  <p>"That is the identical question that I have come to ask," Tab smiled.</p>

  <p>"I am disappointed." Her lips twitched. "But I am not marrying. Don't say
  that I am wedded to my art, because I'm not, and please don't say that there
  is an old boy and girl courtship that will one day materialize, because there
  isn't. I just know nobody that I ever wanted to marry, and if I did I
  shouldn't marry him. Is that all?"</p>

  <p>"That's about all, Miss Ardfern," said Tab. "I'm really sorry to have
  troubled you. I always say that to people I trouble, but this time I mean
  it."</p>

  <p>"How did this information reach you?" she asked as she rose.</p>

  <p>Tab's frown was involuntary.</p>

  <p>"From a--a friend of mine," he said. "It is the first piece of news that
  he has ever given to me, and it is wrong. Good night, Miss Ardfern." His hand
  gripped hers, and she winced.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry!" He was all apologies and confusion.</p>

  <p>"You're very strong!" she smiled, rubbing her hand, "and you aren't very
  well acquainted with us fragile women--didn't you say your name is Holland?
  Are you 'Tab' Holland?"</p>

  <p>Tab coloured. It wasn't like Tab to feel, much less display,
  embarrassment.</p>

  <p>"Why 'Tab'?" she asked, her blue eyes dancing.</p>

  <p>"It is an office nickname," he explained awkwardly; "the boys say that
  I've a passion for making my exit on a good line...really, I believe it is
  the line on which the curtain falls...you'll understand that, Miss Ardfern,
  it is one of the conventions of the drama."</p>

  <p>"A tab-line?" she said. "I have heard about you. I remember now. It was a
  man who was in the company I played with--Milton Braid."</p>

  <p>"He was a reporter before he fell--before he went on the stage," said
  Tab.</p>

  <p>He was not a theatre man and knew none of its disciples. This was the
  second actress he had met in his twenty-six years of life, and she was
  unexpectedly human. That she was also remarkably pretty he accepted without
  surprise. Actresses ought to be beautiful, even Ursula Ardfern, who was a
  great actress if he accepted the general verdict of the press and the
  ecstatic and prejudiced opinion of Rex Lander. But she had a sense of humour;
  a curious possession in an emotional actress, if he could believe all that he
  had read on the subject. She had grace and youth and naturalness. He would
  willingly have stayed, but she was unmistakably ending the interview.</p>

  <p>"Good night, Mr. Holland."</p>

  <p>He took her hand again, this time more gingerly, and she laughed outright
  at his caution.</p>

  <p>On the dressing-table was the small brown jewel-case and a glimpse of it
  reminded him: "If there is anything you'd like to go in The Megaphone," he
  floundered--"there was a paragraph in the paper about your having more
  wonderful jewels than any other woman on the stage..."</p>

  <p>He was being unaccountably gauche; he knew this and hated himself. It did
  not need her quick smile to tell him that she did not wish for that kind of
  publicity. And then the smile vanished, leaving her young face strangely
  hard.</p>

  <p>"No...I don't think that my jewels and their value are very interesting.
  In the part I am playing now it is necessary to wear a great deal of
  jewellery--I wish it weren't. Good night I'm glad to upset the rumour."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry for the bridegroom," said Tab gallantly.</p>

  <p>She watched him out of the room, and her mind was still intent upon this
  broad-shouldered towering young man when her dresser came in.</p>

  <p>"I do wish, miss, you hadn't to carry those diamonds about with you," said
  the sad-faced dresser. "Mr. Stark, the treasurer, said he would put them in
  the theatre safe for you--and there's a night watchman."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Stark told me that too," said the girl quietly, "but I prefer to take
  them with me. Help me with my coat, Simmons."</p>

  <p>A few minutes later she passed through the stage-door. A small and
  handsome little car was drawn up opposite the door. It was closed and empty.
  She passed through the little crowd that had gathered to see her depart,
  stepped inside, placed the jewel-case on the floor at her feet, and started
  the machine.</p>

  <p>The door-man saw it glide round the corner and went back to his tiny
  office.</p>

  <p>Tab also saw the car depart. He grinned at himself for his whimsical and
  freakish act. If anybody had told him that he would wait at a stage-door for
  the pleasure of catching a glimpse of a popular actress, he would have been
  rude. Yet here he was, a furtive and abashed man, so ashamed of his weakness
  that he must look upon her from the darkest corner of the street!</p>

  <p>"Well, well," said Tab with a sigh, "we live and learn."</p>

  <p>His flat was in Doughty Street, and stopping only to telephone the result
  of the interview, he made his way home.</p>

  <p>As he came into the sitting-room a man some two years his junior looked up
  over the top of the armchair in which he was huddled.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>Tab went over to a large tobacco jar and filled his polished briar before
  he spoke.</p>

  <p>"Is it true?" asked Rex Lander impatiently; "what a mysterious brute you
  are!"</p>

  <p>"Rex, you're related to the Canards of Duckville," said the other, puffing
  solemnly. "You're a spreader of false tidings and a creator of alarm and
  despondency amongst the stage-door lizards--whose ancient fraternity I have
  this night joined, thanks to you."</p>

  <p>Rex relaxed his strained body into a more easy and even less graceful
  posture.</p>

  <p>"Then she isn't going to be married?" he said with a sigh.</p>

  <p>"You meant well," said Tab, flopping into a chair, "and I know of no worse
  thing that you can say about a man than that he 'meant well!' But it isn't
  true. She's not going to be married. Where did you get hold of this story,
  Babe?"</p>

  <p>"I heard it," said the other vaguely.</p>

  <p>He was a boyish-looking young man with a pink-and-white complexion. His
  face was so round and cherubic that the appellation of "Babe" had good
  excuse, for he was plump of person and lazy of habit. They had been
  school-fellows, and when Rex had come to town at the command of his one
  relative, his uncle, the sour Mr. Jesse Trasmere, to take up a torturous
  training as an architect, these two had gravitated together and now shared
  Tab's small flat.</p>

  <p>"What do you think of her?"</p>

  <p>Tab thought before replying.</p>

  <p>"She's certainly handicapped with good looks," he said cautiously. At
  another time he would have added a word of disparagement or would have spoken
  jokingly of Rex Lander's intense interest in the lady, but now, for some
  reason, he treated the other's inquiry with more seriousness than was his
  wont.</p>

  <p>Ursula Ardfern stood for the one consistently successful woman management
  in town. Despite her youth she had chosen and cast her own plays, and in four
  seasons had not known the meaning of the word failure.</p>

  <p>"She's quite...charming," Tab said. "Of course I felt a fool; interviewing
  actresses is off my beat anyway. Who is the letter from?" He glanced up at
  the envelope propped on the mantelpiece.</p>

  <p>"From Uncle Jesse," said the other without looking up from his book. "I
  wrote to him, asking him if he would lend me fifty."</p>

  <p>"And he said?--I saw him to-day by the way."</p>

  <p>"Read it," invited Rex Lander with a grin.</p>

  <p>Tab took down the envelope and extracted a thick sheet of paper written in
  a crabbed school-boy hand.</p>

  <p>"DEAR REX" (he read). "Your quarterly allowance is not due until the
  twenty-first. I regret, therefore, that I cannot agree to your request. You
  must live more economically, remembering that when you inherit my money you
  will be thankful for the experience which economical living has given to you
  and which will enable you to employ the great wealth which will be yours, in
  a more judicious, far-seeing manner."</p>

  <p>"He's a miserable old skinflint," said Tab, tossing the letter back to the
  mantelshelf. "Somebody was telling me the other day that he's worth a
  million--where did he make it?"</p>

  <p>Rex shook his head.</p>

  <p>"In China, I think. He was born there, and started in quite a humble way
  as a trader on the Amur River Goldfields. Then he bought property on which
  gold was discovered. I don't know," he said, scratching his chin, "that I
  ought to complain. After all, there may be a lot in all he says, and he has
  been a good friend of mine."</p>

  <p>"How often have you seen him?"</p>

  <p>"I spent a week with him last year," said Rex, with a little grimace at
  the memory. "Still," he hastened to add, "I owe him a lot. It may be if I
  wasn't such a lazy slug and didn't like expensive things, I could live within
  my income."</p>

  <p>Tab pulled at his pipe in silence. Presently he said: "There are all sorts
  of rumours about old Jesse Trasmere. A fellow told me the other day that he
  is a known miser; keeps his money in the house, which of course is a romantic
  lie."</p>

  <p>"He hasn't a banking account," said the other surprisingly, "and I happen
  to know that he does keep a very large sum of money at Mayfield. The house is
  built like a prison, and it has an underground strong-room which is the
  strongest room of its kind. I have never seen it, but I have seen him go down
  to it. Whether or not he sits down and gloats over his pieces of eight, I
  have never troubled to discover. But it is perfectly true, Tab," he said
  earnestly, "he has no banking account. Everything is paid out in cash. I
  suppose he does have transactions through banks, but I have never heard of
  them. As to his being a miser"--he hesitated--"well, he is not exactly
  generous. For example, six months ago he discovered that the man and his wife
  who looked after Mayfield, which is a very small house, were in the habit of
  giving the pieces of food left over to one of their poorer relatives, and he
  fired them on the spot! When I was there this year, he was shutting up all
  the rooms except his own bedroom and his dining-room, which he uses also as a
  study."</p>

  <p>"What does he do for servants?" asked Tab, and the other shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"He has his valet, Walters, and two women who come in every day, one to
  cook and one to clean. But for the cook he has built a small kitchen away
  from the house."</p>

  <p>"He must be a cheerful companion," said Tab.</p>

  <p>"He is not exactly exhilarating. He has a fresh cook every month. I met
  Walters the other day and he told me that the new cook is the best they've
  had," admitted the other, and there followed a silent interval of nearly five
  minutes.</p>

  <p>Then Tab got up and knocked the ashes from his pipe.</p>

  <p>"She certainly is pretty," he said, and Rex Lander looked at him
  suspiciously, for he knew that Tab was not talking about the cook.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3"
     id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

  <p class="first">MR. JESSE TRASMERE sat at the end of a long, and, except in
  his immediate vicinity, bare table. At his end it was laid, and Mr. Trasmere
  was slowly and deliberately enjoying a lean cutlet.</p>

  <p>The room gave no suggestion of immense wealth and paid no silent tribute
  either to his artistic taste or his acquaintance with China. The walls were
  innocent of pictures, the furniture old, European, and shabby. Mr. Trasmere
  had bought it second-hand and had never ceased to boast of the bargain he had
  secured.</p>

  <p>If there were no pictures, there were no books. Jesse Trasmere was not a
  reader, even of newspapers.</p>

  <p>It was one o'clock in the afternoon, and through the folds of his
  dressing-gown the grey of his pyjama jacket showed open at his lean throat,
  for Mr. Trasmere had only just got out of bed. Presently he would dress in
  his rusty black suit and would be immensely wakeful until the dawn of
  to-morrow. He never went to bed until the grey showed in the sky, nor slept
  later than two o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

  <p>At six-thirty, to the second, Walters, his valet, would assist him into
  his overcoat, a light one if it was warm, a heavy fur-lined garment if it was
  cold, and Mr. Trasmere would go for his walk and transact whatever business
  he found to his hand.</p>

  <p>But before he left the house there was a certain ceremonial--the locking
  of doors, the banishment of the valet to his own quarters, and the
  disappearance of Mr. Trasmere through the door which led from his
  study-dining-room to the basement of the house. This done he would go out.
  Walters had watched him from one of the upper windows scores of times walking
  slowly down the street, an unfurled umbrella on one hand, a black bag in
  another. At eight-thirty to the minute he was back in the house. He
  invariably dined out. Walters would bring him a cup of black coffee, and at
  ten o'clock would retire to his own room, which was separated from the main
  building by a heavy door which Mr. Trasmere invariably locked.</p>

  <p>Once in the early days of his service Walters had expostulated.</p>

  <p>"Suppose there is a fire, sir," he complained.</p>

  <p>"You can get through your bath-room window on to the kitchen, and if you
  can't drop to the ground from there you deserve to be burnt to death,"
  snarled the old man. "If you don't like the job, you needn't stay. Those are
  the rules of my establishment, and there are no others."</p>

  <p>So, night after night, Walters had gone to his room and Mr. Trasmere had
  shuffled after him in his slippered feet, had banged and locked the door upon
  him and had left Walters to solitude.</p>

  <p>This procedure was only altered when the old man was taken ill one night
  and was unable to reach the door. Thereafter a key was hung in a small
  glass-fronted case, in very much the same way as fire-keys are hung. In the
  event of his illness, or of any other unexpected happening, Walters could
  secure the key and answer the bell above his bed-head. That necessity had not
  arisen.</p>

  <p>Every morning the valet found the door unlocked. At what hour old Jesse
  came he could not discover, but he guessed that his employer stopped on his
  way to bed in the morning to perform this service.</p>

  <p>Walters was never allowed an evening off. Two days a week he was given
  twenty-four hours' leave of absence, but he had to be in the house by
  ten.</p>

  <p>"And if you are a minute later, don't come back," said Jesse Trasmere.</p>

  <p>As the old man's valet Walters had exceptional opportunities for
  discovering something more about his master than Mr. Trasmere would care to
  have known. He was for a very particular reason anxious to know what the
  basement contained. Once he had met a man who had been engaged in the
  building of the house, and learnt that there was a room below, built of
  concrete; but though he had, with the greatest care and discretion, searched
  for keys which might, during the daily absence of his employer, reveal the
  secret of this underground room, he had never succeeded in laying his hand
  upon them. Mr. Trasmere had apparently only one key, a master-key, which he
  wore round his neck at night, and in the same inaccessible position in his
  clothing during the daytime, and Walters' search had been in vain, until one
  morning, when taking Mr. Trasmere his shaving-water, the servant found him
  suffering from one of those fainting fits which periodically overcame him.
  There was a cake of soap handy, and Walters was a resourceful man...</p>

  <p>Mr. Trasmere looked up from his plate and fixed his servant with his
  grey-blue eyes.</p>

  <p>"Has anybody called this morning?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir."</p>

  <p>"Have any letters come?"</p>

  <p>"Only a few. They are on your desk, sir."</p>

  <p>Mr. Trasmere grunted.</p>

  <p>"Did you put the notice in the paper that I was leaving town for two or
  three days?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said Walters.</p>

  <p>Jesse Trasmere grunted again.</p>

  <p>"A man is coming from China; I don't want to see him," he explained. He
  was oddly communicative at moments to his servant, but Walters, who knew his
  master extremely well, did not make the mistake of asking questions. "No, I
  don't want to see him." The old man chewed a toothpick reflectively, and his
  unattractive face bore an expression of distaste. "He was a partner of mine,
  twenty, thirty years ago, a card-playing, gambling, drinking man, who gave
  himself airs because--well, never mind what he gave himself airs about," he
  said impatiently, as though he anticipated a question which he should have
  known never would have been put to him. "He was that kind of man."</p>

  <p>He stared at the fireless grate with its red brick walls and its
  microscopic radiator and clicked his lips.</p>

  <p>"If he comes, he is not to be admitted. If he asks questions, you're not
  to answer. You know nothing...about anybody. Why he's coming at all...well,
  that doesn't matter. He's just trash, a soakin' dope. He had his chance, got
  under it, and went to sleep. Phew! That fellow! He might have been rich, but
  he sold all his shares. A soak! Rather drink than sit in the Empress of
  China's council...she's dead. White trash...nothing...h'm."</p>

  <p>He glared up of a sudden and asked harshly:</p>

  <p>"Why the hell are you listening?"</p>

  <p>"Sorry, sir, I thought--"</p>

  <p>"Get out!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said Walters with alacrity.</p>

  <p>For half an hour old Jesse Trasmere sat where the valet had left him, the
  red end of his toothpick leaping up and down eccentrically. Then he got up
  and, going to an old-fashioned bureau, opened the glass front.</p>

  <p>He brought to the table a shallow bowl of white porcelain half filled with
  Indian ink. His second visit to the secretaire produced a thick pad of paper.
  It was unusually large, and its texture of a peculiar character. From an
  open-work iron box he took a long-handled brush, and sitting down again
  dipped the fine point into the ink.</p>

  <p>Another long interval of inaction and he commenced to write, beginning at
  the top right-hand corner and working down the page. The grotesque and
  intricate Chinese characters appeared with magic rapidity. He finished one
  column and commenced another, and so until the page was covered except for
  two spaces beneath the last and the penultimate line.</p>

  <p>Laying down the brush he felt, with the slow deliberation of age, in his
  right-hand waistcoat pocket and pulled out an ivory cylinder as big round as
  a large pencil. He slipped one end out and pressed it on the paper. When he
  took the stamp away there appeared within a red circle two Chinese
  characters. This was Jesse Trasmere's "hong," his sign manual; a thousand
  merchants from Shanghai to Fi Chen would honour cheques which bore that queer
  mark, and those for startling sums.</p>

  <p>When the paper was dry he folded it into a small compass and getting up,
  went to the empty fireplace. Outside on the stairs a deeply interested
  Walters craned his neck to see what happened. From his position, and through
  the fanlight above the door, he commanded a view of at least a third of the
  room.</p>

  <p>But now Jesse had passed out of sight, and although he stretched himself
  perilously he could not see what was happening. Only, when the old man
  reappeared the paper was no longer in his hand.</p>

  <p>He touched a bell, and Walters came at once.</p>

  <p>"Remember," he rasped, "I am not at home--to anybody!"</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir," said Walters, a little impatiently.</p>

  <p>Mr. Trasmere had gone out that afternoon when the visitor called.</p>

  <p>It was unfortunate for the old man's scheme that the China mail had made a
  record voyage and had arrived thirty-six hours ahead of her scheduled time.
  Mr. Trasmere was not a reader of newspapers, or he would have learnt the fact
  in that morning's paper.</p>

  <p>Walters answered the bell after some delay, for he was busily engaged in
  his own room on a matter that was entirely private to himself, and when he
  did answer the tinkling summons it was to find a brown-faced stranger
  standing on the broad step. He was dressed in an old suit which did not fit
  him, his linen was stained, and his boots were patched, but his manner would
  not have been out of place in Lorenzo the Magnificent.</p>

  <p>With his hands thrust into his trousers pockets, his soiled soft hat on
  the back of his head, he met the inquiring and deferential gaze of Walters
  with a calm and insolent stare, for Mr. Brown was rather drunk.</p>

  <p>"Well, well, my man," he said impatiently, "why the devil do you keep me
  waiting on the doorstep of my friend Jesse's house, eh?" He removed one of
  his hands from his pocket, possibly not the cleanest one, and tugged at his
  short grey beard.</p>

  <p>"Mr.--er--Mr. Trasmere is out," said Walters, "I will tell him you have
  called. What name, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Wellington Brown is my name, good fellow," said the stranger. "Wellington
  Brown from Chei-feu. I will come in and wait."</p>

  <p>But Walters barred the way.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Trasmere has given me strict orders not to admit anybody unless he is
  in the house," he said.</p>

  <p>A wave of anger turned Wellington Brown's face to a deeper red.</p>

  <p>"He has given orders!" he spluttered. "That I am not to be admitted--I,
  Wellington Brown, who made his fortune, the swindling old thief! He knows I
  am coming!"</p>

  <p>"Are you from China, sir?" blurted Walters.</p>

  <p>"I have told you, menial and boot-licking yellow-plush, that I am from
  Chei-feu. If you are illiterate, as you appear to be, I will explain to you
  that Chei-feu is in China."</p>

  <p>"I don't care whether Chei-feu is in China or on the moon," said Walters
  obstinately. "You can't come in, Mr. Brown! Mr. Trasmere is away--he'll be
  away for a fortnight."</p>

  <p>"Oh, won't I come in!"</p>

  <p>The struggle was a brief one, for Walters was a man of powerful physique,
  and Wellington Brown was a man nearer sixty than fifty. He was flung against
  the stone wall of the porch and might, in his bemused condition, have fallen
  had not Walters' quick hand grabbed him back.</p>

  <p>The stranger breathed noisily.</p>

  <p>"I've killed men for that," he said jerkily, "shot 'em down like dogs!
  I'll remember this, flunkey!"</p>

  <p>"I didn't want to hurt you," said Walters, aggrieved that any onus for the
  unpleasantness should rest on him.</p>

  <p>The stranger raised his hand haughtily.</p>

  <p>"I will settle accounts with your master--remember that, lackey! He shall
  pay, by God!"</p>

  <p>With drunken dignity he walked unsteadily through the patch of garden that
  separated the house from the road, leaving Walters a puzzled man.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch4"
     id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

  <p class="first">AT nine o'clock that night the bell of Tab Holland's flat
  rang long and noisily.</p>

  <p>"Who the dickens is that?" he growled.</p>

  <p>He was in his shirt-sleeves, writing for dear life, and the table was
  strewn with proofs of his industry.</p>

  <p>Rex Lander came out of his bedroom.</p>

  <p>"Your boy, I expect," he said; "I left the lower door open for him."</p>

  <p>Tab shook his head. "The office is sending for the copy at eleven," he
  said; "see who it is, Babe."</p>

  <p>Mr. Lander grumbled. He always grumbled when he was called upon for
  physical effort. He opened the door, and Tab, hearing a loud and unfamiliar
  voice, joined him. On the landing without was a bearded, swaying figure, and
  he was talking noisily.</p>

  <p>"What is wrong?" asked Tab.</p>

  <p>"Everything, sir," hiccupped the caller, "everything is...wrong. A man, a
  gen'leman cannot be robbed with impunity or assaulted by me--menials
  with--with," he considered a moment and added: "impunity."</p>

  <p>"Bring him in, the poor soused herring," said Tab, and Mr. Wellington
  Brown swaggered and staggered into the sitting-room. He was abominably
  intoxicated.</p>

  <p>"Wish of you young gen'lemen is Rex Lander?"</p>

  <p>"That is my name," said the puzzled Rex.</p>

  <p>"I'm...Wellington Brown of Chei-feu. A pensioner at' the mercy of a dam'
  ol' scoundrel! A pension'r! He pays me a pittance out of what he robbed me. I
  can tell you some'n about ol' Trasmere..."</p>

  <p>"Trasmere, my uncle?" asked the startled young man.</p>

  <p>The other nodded gravely and sleepily.</p>

  <p>"I can tell you some'n about him. I was his book...keeper 'n sec'tary. I
  know! I'll tell you some'n about him!"</p>

  <p>"You can save your breath," said Rex coldly. "Why have you come here?"</p>

  <p>"Because you're's nephew. Thas why! He robbed me...robbed me!" he sobbed.
  "Took bread out 'the mouth of innocent child...thas what! Took bread out 'f
  orphan's mouth and robbed me, swin'led me out of my share Mancurian Trading
  Syn'cate, an' then gave me remittance 'n said, 'Drink yerself to death'--thas
  what he said!"</p>

  <p>"And did you?" asked Tab sardonically.</p>

  <p>The stranger eyed him unfavourably.</p>

  <p>"Who's this?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"This is a friend of mine," said Rex, "and you're in his flat. And if the
  only business you have is to abuse my uncle you can get out just as soon as
  you like."</p>

  <p>Mr. Wellington Brown tapped the young man's chest with a grimy
  forefinger.</p>

  <p>"Your uncle is a rascal! Get that! A low thief!"</p>

  <p>"Better write and tell him so," said Tab briskly; "just now I am engaged
  in churning out two yards of journalese, and you're disturbing my
  thoughts."</p>

  <p>"Write to him!" roared Mr. Brown delightedly; "write to him! Thas
  good...best thing I've heard for years! Why--!"</p>

  <p>"Get out!"</p>

  <p>Babe Lander threw open the door with a crash, and the visitor glared at
  him.</p>

  <p>"Like ungle, like nephew," he said, "like nephew, like lackey...I'm goin'.
  And let me tell you--"</p>

  <p>The door slammed in his face.</p>

  <p>"Phew!" said Babe, wiping his brow. "Let's open the window and let in some
  fresh air!"</p>

  <p>"Who is he?"</p>

  <p>"Search me," said Rex Lander. "I've no illusions about Uncle Jesse's early
  friends. I gather that he's been a pensioner of the old boy's, and there is
  probably some truth in his charge that he was robbed. I cannot imagine uncle
  giving money away from charitable motives. Anyway, I'm seeing him to-morrow,
  and I'll ask."</p>

  <p>"You'll see nothing," said Tab. "Do you ever read the fashionable
  intelligence or society news? Uncle is leaving town to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Rex smiled.</p>

  <p>"That is an old trick when he doesn't want to be seen--by Joab! It is the
  Wellington who has put his name in the society column!"</p>

  <p>Tab paused, pen in hand.</p>

  <p>"Silence will now reign," he commanded, "whilst a great journalist deals
  adequately with the Milligan Murder Appeal."</p>

  <p>Rex looked at him admiringly.</p>

  <p>"How you can stick your nose at the grindstone is a source of wonder to
  me," he said. "I couldn't--"</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" snapped Tab, and the desirable silence was his.</p>

  <p>He finished the last page at eleven, sent off his copy by a punctual
  messenger, then filling his pipe, stretched himself luxuriously in his
  mission chair.</p>

  <p>"Now I'm a free man until Monday afternoon--"</p>

  <p>The hall telephone signalled at that moment, and he got up with a
  groan.</p>

  <p>"Boast not!" he growled. "That is the office or I'm a saint!"</p>

  <p>It was the office, as he had so intelligently foreseen. He snapped a few
  words at the transmitter and came back to the room. And Tab was very
  voluble.</p>

  <p>A Polish gentleman concerned in certain frauds on insurance companies had
  been arrested, escaped again, and having barricaded himself in his house, was
  keeping the police at bay with the aid of boiling water and a large axe.</p>

  <p>"Jacko is enthusiastic about it," said the savage Tab, speaking thus
  disrespectfully of his city editor; "says it is real drama--I told him to
  send the dramatic critic. Gosh! I did his job the other night."</p>

  <p>"Going out?" asked Rex with mild interest.</p>

  <p>"Of course I'm going out, you thick-headed jibberer!" said the other
  unkindly as he struggled into the collar he had discarded.</p>

  <p>"I thought all that sort of stuff was invented in the office," said the
  young architect monstrously. "Personally I never believe what I read in
  newspapers..."</p>

  <p>But Tab had gone.</p>

  <p>At midnight he joined a little group of police officers that stood at safe
  range from the besieged house, whose demented occupant had found a shot-gun.
  Tab was with them until the door of the house was stormed and the defender
  borne down and clubbed to a state of placidity.</p>

  <p>At two o'clock in the morning, he and Carver, the chief of the detectives
  engaged in the case, adjourned to the police mess and had supper. It was
  half-past three and the streets were lit by the ghostly light of dawn when he
  started to walk home.</p>

  <p>Passing through Park Street, he heard the whir of wheels and a motor-car
  flew past him. It had gone a hundred yards when there came to him the
  explosion of a burst tyre. He saw the car swerve and stop. A woman alighted
  and examined the damage. Apparently she was alone, for he saw her open the
  tool-box on the running-board and take out a jack. He hastened his footsteps
  and crossed to the middle of the road.</p>

  <p>The only other person in sight was a cyclist down the road who had
  dismounted and was examining his wheel.</p>

  <p>"Can I be of service?" asked Tab. The woman started and turned. "Miss
  Ardfern!" he said, in astonishment.</p>

  <p>For a second she seemed uncomfortable, and then with a quick smile:</p>

  <p>"It is...Mr. Tab! Please forgive the familiarity, I cannot remember your
  other name."</p>

  <p>"Don't try," he said, taking the jack from her hands; "but if you are very
  anxious to remember, I am called Holland."</p>

  <p>She said nothing whilst he was raising the car. When he was knocking the
  torn wheel free, she said: "I was out rather late; I have been to a
  party."</p>

  <p>There was light enough for him to see that she was dressed very plainly
  and that the shoes she wore were heavy and serviceable. He would have gone
  farther and said that she was dressed poorly. Inside the car on the seat by
  her side was a square black case, smaller but deeper than a suit-case.
  Perhaps she had changed her clothes--but for all their surprising agility in
  this direction, actresses do not change their clothes to go home from a
  party.</p>

  <p>"I have been to a party too," he said, jerking off the wheel and rolling
  it to the front of the car: "a surprise party, with fireworks."</p>

  <p>"A dance?"</p>

  <p>Tab smiled to himself.</p>

  <p>"I only danced once," he said "I saw the gentleman taking aim with the
  shot-gun and danced right merrily, yo ho!"</p>

  <p>He heard the quick intake of her breath.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes...it was the Pole. We heard the shots and I knew that he had taken
  refuge in his house before I left the theatre."</p>

  <p>The wheel was replaced now, the tools returned, and the old wheel strapped
  to the car.</p>

  <p>"That is O.K.," said Tab, stepping back. "Oh no, it was nothing," he said
  hastily as she began to thank him, "nothing at all."</p>

  <p>She did not offer to drive him home. He rather hoped that she would;
  indeed, her method of going was a little precipitate, and she was out of
  sight before he realized that she was gone.</p>

  <p>What on earth was she doing at that time in the morning, he wondered? A
  party she had said, but again it occurred to him that fashionable actresses
  did not go to parties in that kind of outfit.</p>

  <p>Rex was awake when he reached home and came out to him. Strangely enough,
  although they discussed the happenings of the night, Tab did not mention his
  meeting with Ursula Ardfern.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch5"
     id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

  <p class="first">"URSULA ARDFERN." Tab woke with the words on his lips. The
  hour was eleven, and Rex had been out and was back again.</p>

  <p>"L'ami de mon oncle has been--did you hear him?" asked Rex, stopping his
  towel-encompassed companion on his way to the bath-room.</p>

  <p>"Who--Bonaparte?"</p>

  <p>"Wellington is his name, I believe. Yes, he came rather subdued and
  apologetic, but full of horrific threats toward Uncle Jesse. I turned him
  out."</p>

  <p>"Why did he come?"</p>

  <p>Rex Lander shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Heaven knows! Unless it was that he simply had to find somebody who knew
  uncle well enough to be interested in hearing him curse the old man. I've
  persuaded him to leave town until the end of next week. But I must say that I
  was impressed by the brute's threats. He says he will kill Uncle Jesse unless
  he makes reparation."</p>

  <p>"Twiff!" said Tab contemptuously, and went to his tub.</p>

  <p>Over his breakfast (Rex had had his two hours before) he returned to the
  subject of Mr. Jesse Trasmere and his enemy.</p>

  <p>"When a man soaks he's dangerous," he said. "There isn't any such thing as
  a harmless drunkard, any more than there is a harmless lunatic. Carver and I
  had a talk on the matter early this morning, and he agreed. That man is
  certainly intelligent, which is more than you can say of the majority of
  detectives, poor fellow; they are the victims of a system which calls for a
  sixty-nine-inch brain."</p>

  <p>"Eh?"</p>

  <p>"A sixty-nine-inch brain," explained Tab, and there was really no excuse
  for Babe Lander to be puzzled, for Tab was on his favourite topic, "is the
  brain of a man who is chosen for the subtle business of criminal
  investigation; not because he is clever or shrewd or has a knowledge of the
  world, but because he stands sixty-nine inches in his stockings and has a
  chest expansion to thirty-eight. Funny, isn't it? And yet detectives are
  chosen that way. They have to strip hard, very hard, but they need not think
  very hard. Do you ever realize that Napoleon and Julius Caesar, to mention
  only two bright lads, could never have got into the police force?"</p>

  <p>"It hasn't struck me before," admitted Rex. "But I've never had any doubt
  as to the size of your brain, Tab."</p>

  <p>There were exactly seventy inches of Tab, though he did not look so tall,
  having thickness and breadth to his shoulders. He had a habit of stooping,
  which made him seem round-shouldered. This trick came from pounding a
  typewriter or crouching over a desk which was just a little too low for
  him.</p>

  <p>He was fresh-coloured, but brown rather than pink. His face was finer
  drawn than is usual in a man of his build, his eyes deep-set and steadfastly
  grey. When he spoke he drawled a little. Those who knew him very well indeed
  detected one imperfection of speech. He could not say "very"--it was "vethy,"
  but spoken so quickly that only the trained and acquainted ear could detect
  the lisp.</p>

  <p>He came to journalism from one of the Universities, bringing no particular
  reputation for learning, but universally honoured as the best three-quarter
  back of his time. Without being rich he was comfortably placed, and as he was
  one of those fortunates who had innumerable maiden-aunts he received on an
  average one legacy a year, though he had studiously neglected them because of
  their possessions.</p>

  <p>It would be more true to say that Tab leapt into journalism, and to that
  peculiar department of journalism which he found most fascinating, when he
  dived off the end of a river pier and rescued Jasper Dorgon, the defaulting
  banker who had tried to commit suicide, and had extracted an exclusive story
  from the banker whilst both sat in a state of nudity before a night
  watchman's fire watching their clothes dry.</p>

  <p>"Let it strike you now, Babe," he said. "The sixty-nine-inch brain, the
  generally accepted theory that anything under the sixty-nine-inch level is
  solid ivory, is the theory that keeps Lew Vann and old Joe Haspinell and
  similar crook acquaintances of mine dining in the Grand Criterion when they
  ought to be atoning for their sins in the Cold Stone Jug. But Carver is a
  good man. He thinks, though it is against regulations."</p>

  <p>"What does he think about Wellington?"</p>

  <p>"Didn't tell him," said Tab. "You ought to warn your uncle."</p>

  <p>"I'll see him to-day," nodded Rex.</p>

  <p>They went out together before the lunch hour. Tab had a call to make at
  the office and afterwards he was meeting Carver for lunch. Carver, a lanky
  and slow-speaking man, was ordinarily no conversationalist. On some subjects
  he was impressively interesting, and as Tab provided the subject, two hours
  slipped away very quickly. Before they left the restaurant, Tab told him of
  the drunken stranger and his threats against Jesse Trasmere.</p>

  <p>"I don't worry about threats," said Carver, "but a man with a grievance,
  and especially a Number One grievance like this man has, is pretty certain to
  cause trouble. Do you know old Trasmere?"</p>

  <p>"I've seen him twice. I was once sent to his house to make an inquiry
  about an action that the municipality started against him for building
  without the town architect's permission. Rex Lander, who is a kindergarten
  architect by the way, and rooms with me, is his nephew, and I've heard a
  whole lot about him. He writes to Rex from time to time; letters full of good
  advice about saving money."</p>

  <p>"Lander is his heir?"</p>

  <p>"Rex hopes so, fervently. But he says it is just as likely that Uncle
  Jesse will leave his money to a Home for the Incurably Wealthy. Talking of
  Trasmere, there goes his valet, and he seems in a hurry."</p>

  <p>A cab dashed past them, its solitary passenger was Walters, a pinch-faced
  man, bareheaded, and on his face a tense, haggard look that immediately
  arrested the attention of the two men.</p>

  <p>"Who did you say that was?" asked Carver quickly.</p>

  <p>"Walters--old Trasmere's servant," replied Tab; "looks pretty scared to
  me."</p>

  <p>"Walters?" The detective stood stock still, thinking. "I know that man's
  face...I've got him! Walter Felling!"</p>

  <p>"Walter who?"</p>

  <p>"Felling--he was through my hands ten years ago, and he has been convicted
  since. Walters, as you call him, is an incorrigible thief! Old Trasmere's
  servant, eh? That's his speciality. He takes service with rich people, and
  one fine morning they wake up to find their loose jewellery and money and
  plate gone. Did you notice the number of the cab?"</p>

  <p>Tab shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The question is," said the detective, "has he made a get-away in a hurry,
  or is he on an urgent errand for his boss? Anyway we ought to see Trasmere.
  Shall we take a cab or walk?"</p>

  <p>"Walk," said Tab promptly. "Only the detectives of fiction take cabs,
  Carver. The real people know that when they present their cab bills to the
  head office a soulless clerk will question each item."</p>

  <p>"Tab, you certainly know more about the interior economy of thief-catching
  than an outsider ought to know," responded the detective gloomily.</p>

  <p>Between them and Trasmere's house was the better part of a mile. Mayfield,
  the dwelling-place of old Jesse, was the one ugly building in a road which
  was famous for the elegance of its houses. Built of hideously yellow brick,
  without any ornamentation, it stood squat and square in the middle of a
  cemented "garden." Three microscopic circles of earth had been left at the
  urgent request of the builder, wherein Mr. Jesse might, if he so desired, win
  from the sickly earth such blooms and blossoms as might delight his eye. To
  this he reluctantly agreed, but only after there had been pointed out to him
  the fact that such an alteration to his plans would save a little money.</p>

  <p>"It isn't exactly the Palace of the Fairy Prince, is it?" said Tab, as he
  pushed open the cast-iron gate.</p>

  <p>"I've seen prettier houses," admitted Carver. "I wonder--"</p>

  <p>So far he got when the front door was flung violently open and Rex Lander
  rushed out. His face was the colour of chalk, his big baby eyes were staring
  wildly. They fell upon the two men on the concrete walk, and his mouth opened
  to speak, but no words came.</p>

  <p>Tab ran to him.</p>

  <p>"What is wrong?" he demanded, and that something was badly wrong one
  glance at Babe Lander told him.</p>

  <p>"My uncle..." he gasped. "Go...look..."</p>

  <p>Carver rushed into the house and through the open door of the dining-room.
  It was empty, but at the side of the fireplace was a narrower door.</p>

  <p>"Where is he?" asked the detective.</p>

  <p>Rex could only point to the narrow aperture.</p>

  <p>There was a flight of stone stairs which terminated in a narrow passage,
  barred by yet another door, which was also open. The corridor was well
  lighted by three globes set at intervals in the ceiling, and the acrid smell
  of exploded cordite filled the confined space of the passage, which was
  empty.</p>

  <p>"There must be a room opening from here," said Carver.</p>

  <p>"Whose are these?"</p>

  <p>He stooped and picked up an old pair of gloves that lay on the floor and
  pushed them into his pocket.</p>

  <p>He looked round for Rex Lander. That young man was sitting on the top step
  of the stairs, his face in his hands.</p>

  <p>"There's no sense in questioning him," said Carver in an undertone, "where
  is his uncle?"</p>

  <p>Tab walked rapidly down the passage and came to a door on the left. It was
  a narrow door, painted black and deeply recessed in the thick wall. There was
  no handle, and only a tiny keyhole. Four inches from its top was a steel
  plate pierced with small holes for the purpose of ventilation. He pushed the
  door, but it was locked. Then he peered through the ventilator.</p>

  <p>He saw a vault which he guessed was about ten feet long by eight feet
  wide. Fixed to the rough walls were a number of steel shelves, loaded up with
  black iron boxes. A brilliant light came from a globe in the vaulted roof,
  and he saw plainly.</p>

  <p>At the farther end of the room was a plain table, but it was not at this
  he was looking, but at the figure crouched against one of its legs. The face
  was turned in his direction.</p>

  <p>It was the face of Jesse Trasmere, and he was dead.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch6"
     id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

  <p class="first">TAB gave way to the detective and waited whilst Carver
  looked.</p>

  <p>"There's no sign of a weapon--but by the smell there has been some
  shooting," he said. "What is that on the table?"</p>

  <p>Tab peered through the ventilator.</p>

  <p>"It looks like a key to me," he said.</p>

  <p>They tried the door, but it resisted their combined weight.</p>

  <p>"The door is much too thick and the lock too strong for us to force," said
  Carver at last. "I'll telephone headquarters, Tab. See what you can get out
  of your friend."</p>

  <p>"I don't think he'll tell me much for some time. Come along, Babe," said
  Tab kindly, taking the other's arm. "Let's get out of this beastly
  atmosphere."</p>

  <p>Unresisting, Rex Lander allowed himself to be led back to the dining-room,
  where he dropped into a chair.</p>

  <p>Carver had finished his telephoning and had returned long before Rex had
  recovered sufficiently to give a coherent narrative. His face was blanched,
  he could not control his quivering lips, and it was a considerable time
  before he could tell his patient hearers all that he knew.</p>

  <p>"I came to the house this afternoon by appointment," he said. "My uncle
  had written to me asking me to see him about an application which I had made
  to him for a loan. He had previously rejected my request, but, as had often
  happened, he relented at the last moment, for he was not a bad man at heart.
  As I was pressing the bell the door opened, and I saw Walters--Walters is my
  uncle's valet."</p>

  <p>The detective nodded.</p>

  <p>"He looked terribly agitated, and he had a brown leather bag in his hand.
  'I am just going out, Mr. Lander,' he said--"</p>

  <p>"Did he seem surprised to see you?"</p>

  <p>"He seemed alarmed," said Rex. "It struck me when I saw him that my uncle
  must be ill, and I asked him if anything was the matter. He said that uncle
  was well, but he had sent him on a very important errand. The conversation
  did not last more them a minute, for Walters ran down the steps into the road
  before I could recover from my amazement."</p>

  <p>"He wore no hat?" asked Carver.</p>

  <p>Rex shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I stood in the hall for a moment, knowing that my uncle does not like
  people to come in upon him unless they are properly announced. You see, Mr.
  Carver, the situation was rather a delicate one for me. I had come here in
  the role of a suppliant, and naturally I did not wish to prejudice my chance
  of getting the fifty which my uncle had promised me. I went to uncle's
  living-room, but he was not there; but the door which I knew led to the
  strong-room was open and he could not be far away. I sat down and waited. I
  must have been there ten minutes, and then I began to smell something
  burning, as I thought, but which was, in fact, the smell of gunpowder, or
  whatever they use in cartridges, and I was so thoroughly alarmed that I went
  down the steps and after a little hesitation, knowing how my uncle hated
  being overlooked, I went on to the door of the vault. It was locked, and I
  rapped on the ventilator but had no reply. Then I peeped through."</p>

  <p>"It was horrible," he shuddered. "As fast as I could I ran up the stairs
  into the street, intending to call a policeman, and I saw you."</p>

  <p>"Whilst you were in the house you heard no sound to suggest that there was
  anybody else present? Where are the servants?"</p>

  <p>"There is only the cook," said Rex, and Carver went in search of her.</p>

  <p>But the kitchen was closed and deserted. It was apparently the cook's day
  off.</p>

  <p>"I'll make a search of the house," said Carver. "Come along, Tab, you are
  in this case now and you had better stay with it."</p>

  <p>The search did not take a very long time. There were two rooms used by Mr.
  Trasmere, the remainder were locked up and apparently unused. A passage-way
  led to Walters' sleeping apartment, which had originally been designed as a
  guest-room and was larger than servants' quarters usually are. The room was
  meagrely furnished and there was evidence that Mr. Walters had not
  anticipated so hurried a flight. Some of his clothing hung on pegs behind the
  door, others were found in a wardrobe, whilst a cup filled with coffee stood
  on the table. Carver dipped his little finger into the liquid. It was still
  warm.</p>

  <p>A cloth had been thrown hurriedly over some bulky object at one end of the
  table, and this the detective removed. He whistled. Clamped to the edge of
  the table was a small vice and scattered about were a number of files and
  other tools.</p>

  <p>Carver turned the screw of the vice and released the object in its grip.
  It was a small key of peculiar shape, and the man must have been working upon
  it recently, for steel filings covered the base of the tool.</p>

  <p>"Then friend Walters was making a key," said Carver.</p>

  <p>"Look at that plaster cast! That is an old dodge, of his. I suppose he got
  an impression of the key on soap or wax and has been working at it ever
  since." He looked at the thing in his palm, curiously. "This may save us a
  great deal of trouble," he said, "for unless I am mistaken this is the key of
  the strong-room."</p>

  <p>A few minutes later the house was filled with detectives, police
  photographers, and coroner's officers. They came on a useless errand, for the
  door remained locked. Tab took advantage of their arrival to escort his
  friend home.</p>

  <p>Before he went Carver drew him aside.</p>

  <p>"We shall have to keep in touch with Mr. Lander," he said. "He may be able
  to throw a great deal of light upon this murder. In the meantime I have sent
  out all station calls to pull in Felling--who is Wellington Brown?"</p>

  <p>"Wellington Brown? That is the man who has been threatening Trasmere--I
  told you about him at lunch."</p>

  <p>Carver pulled an old pair of gloves from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Wellington Brown was in that underground corridor," he said quietly,
  "and was sufficiently indiscreet to leave his gloves behind--his name is
  written inside!"</p>

  <p>"You will charge him with the murder?" asked Tab, and Carver nodded.</p>

  <p>"I think so. Either he or Walters. At any rate we shall hold them on
  suspicion, but I cannot be more definite until we've got inside that
  vault."</p>

  <p>Tab escorted his friend to the flat, and leaving him, hurried back to
  Mayfield, by which fanciful name Trasmere had called his grim house.</p>

  <p>"We've found no weapon of any kind," said the detective, whom Tab found
  sitting in Trasmere's dining-room with a plan of the house before him. "Maybe
  it is in the vault, in which event it looks like a case of suicide. I have
  been on the telephone with the boss of Mortimers, the builders. They say that
  there is only one key in existence for that vault--I was speaking to Mr.
  Mortimer himself, and he knows. Trasmere made a special point about the lock,
  and had twenty or thirty manufactured by different locksmiths. Nobody knows
  which one he used, and Mortimer says that the orders were so imperative that
  there should be no duplicate key that it is unlikely--in fact, I think,
  impossible--that the murderer could have entered the vault except by the aid
  of Trasmere's own key. However, we shall soon know; I have the best workman
  in town working at the unfinished key in Felling's room, and he says it is so
  far advanced that he is in no doubt he will be able to open the vault
  to-night."</p>

  <p>"Then it is useless in its present state?"</p>

  <p>The other nodded.</p>

  <p>"Quite useless; we have tried it, and the locksmith, who is an expert,
  says that it wouldn't fit into the keyhole as it was when we found it."</p>

  <p>"Then you suggest it is a case of suicide? That old man Trasmere went into
  the vault, locked himself in and then shot himself?"</p>

  <p>Carver shook his head.</p>

  <p>"If the revolver is found in the vault, yours would be a very sound
  theory, though why Trasmere should shoot himself is entirely beyond me."</p>

  <p>At a quarter to eleven that night three men stood before the door of the
  Trasmere vault, and the shirt-sleeved workman inserting the key, the lock
  snapped back. He was pushing the door open when Carver caught his arm.</p>

  <p>"Just leave it as it is," he said, and the locksmith, obviously
  disappointed that he should be denied a full view of the tragedy which he had
  only half glimpsed, went back to gather up his tools.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Carver, drawing a long breath, and pulling a pair of white
  gloves from his pocket he put them on.</p>

  <p>Tab followed him into the chamber of death.</p>

  <p>"I've telephoned for the doctor. He'll be here in a few seconds," said
  Carver, looking down at the silent figure leaning against the table legs. He
  pointed to the table. In the exact centre lay a key, but what brought the
  exclamation to the detective's lips was the fact that the one half was
  stained red. The fluid which had run from it had soaked into the porous
  surface of the table.</p>

  <p>"Blood," whispered the detective, and gingerly lifted the flat steel.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt about it. Though the handle was clean, the lower wards
  appeared as though they had been dipped in blood.</p>

  <p>"This disposes of the suicide theory," said Carver.</p>

  <p>His first search was for the pistol which had obviously slain the man.
  There was no sign of any weapon. He passed his hand under the limp body, and
  Tab shivered to see the head drop wearily to the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Nothing there...shot through the body too. Suicides seldom do it that
  way."</p>

  <p>His quick fingers searched the silent figure. There was nothing of any
  value.</p>

  <p>Carver straightened himself and stood, fist on hip, surveying the dreadful
  sight.</p>

  <p>"He was standing here when he was shot--he never knew what killed him. As
  faked suicide it is inartistic--apart from the absence of weapon, the old man
  was shot in the back."</p>

  <p>If there were any doubts on the subject they were set at rest when the
  doctor made his brief examination.</p>

  <p>"He was shot at the range of about two yards," he said. "No, Mr. Carver,
  it is impossible that he should have committed suicide; there is no burning
  whatever. Besides, the bullet has entered the back, just beneath the left
  shoulder, and of course death must have been instantaneous. It is impossible
  that the wound can have been self-inflicted."</p>

  <p>Again came the police photographers, and after they had gone, leaving the
  vault thick with the mist of exploded magnesium, the two men were left to
  their search. The first boxes were, for the main part, filled with money.
  There was very little gold, but a great deal of paper of various
  nationalities. In one box Carver found five million francs in thousand-franc
  notes, another was packed with English five-pound notes, another was full of
  hundred-dollar bills fastened in packets of ten thousand. Only two of these
  boxes were locked and only one that they looked at that night contained
  anything in the nature of documents. For the most part they were old leases,
  receipts painted on thin paper in Chinese characters, and which they only
  knew were receipts because somebody had written a translation on their backs.
  They were bracketed neatly in folders, on each of which was described in a
  fine flowing hand, the nature of its contents.</p>

  <p>On one thick bundle fastened with rubber bands was an old label: "Trading
  correspondence, 1899."</p>

  <p>In his search Tab, who was looking through the box, found a folded
  manuscript, which he brought out.</p>

  <p>"Here is his will," he said, and Carver took it from him. It was written
  in the crabbed boyish hand which Tab had come to know so well, and it was
  very short. After the conventional preamble, it went on:</p>

  <p>"I leave all my property and effects whatsoever, to my nephew, Rex
  Percival Lander, the only son of my deceased sister, Mary Catherine Lander
  nee Trasmere, and I appoint him sole executor of this my will."</p>

  <p>It was witnessed by Mildred Green, who described herself as a cook, and by
  Arthur Green, whose description of his profession was valet. Their addresses
  were Mayfield.</p>

  <p>"I think those are the two servants the old man discharged for pilfering
  some six months ago. The will must have been executed a few weeks before they
  left."</p>

  <p>Tab's first feeling was one of pleasure that at last his friend was a rich
  man. Poor Rex, little did he dream that he would come into his inheritance in
  so tragic a fashion.</p>

  <p>Carver put the document back into the box and continued the examination of
  the door which Tab had interrupted.</p>

  <p>"It isn't a spring lock, you notice," he said. "So, therefore, it couldn't
  have been slammed by a murderer who first shot Trasmere and then made his
  escape. It has to be locked either from the inside or the outside. If there
  was any reasonable possibility of Trasmere having shot himself, the solution
  would have been simple. But he did not shoot himself. He was shot here, the
  door was locked upon him, and the key returned to the table--how?" He took
  the key and tried one of the air-holes of the ventilator. The point of the
  key scarcely entered.</p>

  <p>"There must be some other entrance to the vault," he said.</p>

  <p>The sun was up before they finished their examination of the room. The
  walls were solid. There was neither window nor fireplace. The floor was even
  more substantial than the walls.</p>

  <p>In a last hopeless endeavour to solve the mystery Carver called in an
  expert to inspect the ventilator. It was made of steel, a quarter of an inch
  thick, and fastened into the door itself. There were no screws with which it
  could have been taken out, and even if it had been removed, only the tiniest
  of mortals could have crept through.</p>

  <p>"Still," said Carver, "if we could suppose that the ventilator was
  removable, we might have taken a leaf from Edgar Allan Poe and thought
  seriously of a trained monkey being introduced."</p>

  <p>"There is the theory of the duplicate key--"</p>

  <p>"Which I dismiss," said Carver. "I am satisfied that no duplicate key was
  used. If a duplicate key had been procurable, Felling, or Walters as you call
  him, would have found his way to it. He is the cleverest man in that
  business, and he has lived on duplicate keys all his life. He must have known
  that it was impossible to gain admission by such a method or he wouldn't have
  taken the trouble to make one. He is a specialist in that line of business,
  probably the finest locksmith of the underworld."</p>

  <p>"Then you suggest that this key was used?" Tab pointed to the table.</p>

  <p>"I not only suggest it, but I would swear to it," said Carver quietly.
  "Look!" He pulled the door open so that the light fell upon the outside
  keyhole. "Do you see the little bloodspots?" he asked. "That key has not only
  been used from the outside, where it has left unmistakable markings, but the
  same has happened on the inside of the door."</p>

  <p>He swung the door again and Tab saw the tell-tale stains.</p>

  <p>"That door was unlocked from the inside after the old man was dead and
  locked again upon him."</p>

  <p>"But how did the key get back to the table?" asked the bewildered
  reporter.</p>

  <p>Mr. Carver shook his head.</p>

  <p>"A medical student was once asked by a professor whether Adam was ever a
  baby, and he replied: 'God knows'--that is my answer to you!" he said. "We
  will leave the other boxes until to-morrow, Tab."</p>

  <p>Carver led the way out of the vault, locked the door with the duplicate
  key, and put it in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"My brain is dead," said Tab.</p>

  <p>And it was then that he saw the new pin.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch7"
     id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

  <p class="first">FROM where he stood the light caught it and sent up a thread
  of silvery reflection. He stooped mechanically and picked it up.</p>

  <p>"What is that?" asked the detective curiously.</p>

  <p>"It looks to me like a pin," said Tab.</p>

  <p>It was a very ordinary pin, silvery bright and about an inch and a half in
  length. In that sense it was of an unusual size, though it was the kind that
  is commonly used by bankers, who delight in fastening large documents
  together by this barbarous method. It was not straight, there was a slight
  bend in it, but otherwise it had no remarkable features. Tab looked at it
  stupidly.</p>

  <p>"Give it to me," said Carver. He took it in his white-gloved hand and
  walked to a position under one of the lights. "I don't suppose it has any
  significance," he said, "but I'll keep it." He put the pin carefully away in
  the match-box where he had put the key. "Now, Tab," he said more briskly as
  they went out of the house together into the bright sunlight, two unshaven,
  weary-looking men, "you have the story of your life, but go easy on any clues
  we have found."</p>

  <p>"I didn't know we had found any," said Tab, "unless the pin is a
  clue."</p>

  <p>"Even that I should not mention," said Carver gravely.</p>

  <p>When he got back to his flat Tab found the lights of the sitting-room
  blazing and Rex Lander, fully dressed, asleep on the settee.</p>

  <p>"I waited up till three," yawned Rex. "Have they caught Walters, or
  whoever it was?"</p>

  <p>"Not when I left Carver, which was ten minutes ago," replied Tab. "They
  suspect that man Brown. His gloves were found in the passage."</p>

  <p>"Brown, the man from China?...it was pretty awful, wasn't it?" asked Babe
  in a hushed voice, as though the fearfulness of those moments through which
  he had passed were only now appealing to him in their sheer terror. "My God,
  what an awful thing! I've tried not to think about it all night; that
  horrible memory persisted so that it nearly drove me mad."</p>

  <p>"I have one bit of good news for you, Rex," said the other as he began to
  prepare for bed. "We found your uncle's will. That is unofficial."</p>

  <p>"You found the will, did you?" said the other listlessly. "I am afraid I
  am not interested in his will just now. Who gets the money--the Dogs' Home or
  the Cats' Creche?"</p>

  <p>"It goes to a stout young architect," said Tab with a grin, "and I can see
  our little home breaking up. Maybe I'll come and see you when you are rich,
  Babe, if you'll know me."</p>

  <p>Rex's impatient gesture silenced him.</p>

  <p>"I'm not thinking about money--I'm thinking about other things," he
  said.</p>

  <p>Tab slept for four hours, and woke to find that Rex had gone out.</p>

  <p>When he came into the street the special editions of the Sunday newspaper
  were selling, with stories of the murder.</p>

  <p>The news-editor had not arrived when Tab reached the office, but he turned
  in the rough narrative of the tragedy to guide the office in its general
  search for Walters and Brown.</p>

  <p>He went on to Mayfield, but Carver was not there, and the police-sergeant
  in charge of the house was indisposed to admit him. Carver, being a single
  man, lived in lodgings. Tab surprised him in the act of shaving.</p>

  <p>"No, there is no news of Felling, and Brown, who is a much more difficult
  proposition, has disappeared from view. Why is he more difficult? Because he
  is unknown. In comparison tracing Walters is child's play. Yet we haven't
  even found him," said the Inspector, wiping his face, "which is rather
  surprising, considering that we know his usual haunts and acquaintances. None
  of these say they have seen him. The cab-driver has come forward in answer to
  our hurry-up call, and says he set down Felling at the Central Station. They
  stopped on the way to buy a hat, apparently."</p>

  <p>Carver had not been to the station that morning, and even if he had he
  could not have given the news which was to startle Tab later in the day.</p>

  <p>"Have you formed any fresh theory, Carver?"</p>

  <p>Carver looked out of the window and pulled his long nose thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>He was a tall thin man, with a lean face that was all lines and furrows.
  In repose it was melancholy in the extreme, and his gentle apologetic tone
  seemed somehow in keeping with his appearance.</p>

  <p>"There are several theories, all more or less fluid," he said.</p>

  <p>"Has it occurred to you," asked Tab, "that the shot might have been fired
  through one of the ventilator holes?"</p>

  <p>Carver nodded several times before he answered.</p>

  <p>"It occurred to me after I left you and I went back to make sure, but
  there is no blackening of the grating such as there would be if a pistol of
  sufficiently small calibre had been pressed against one of the holes and
  fired, added to which there is this important fact: that the bullet of the
  size the doctors found in Trasmere's body would not go through any such
  hole." Carver shook his head. "No, the murder was committed actually in the
  vault, either by Brown, by Walters, or by some third person."</p>

  <p>Tab had a few independent inquiries to pursue, one of which related to the
  cook. She had already been questioned by the police, he discovered, when he
  reached her little suburban home. A quiet, motherly, and unimaginative woman,
  there was little she could tell.</p>

  <p>"It was my day off," she said. "Mr. Trasmere said he was going into the
  country, though I don't suppose he was. He had said that before, but Walters
  told me to take no notice. I have never seen Mr. Trasmere," she said, to
  Tab's surprise.</p>

  <p>"All my orders came through Mr. Walters, and practically I was never
  inside the house except once, when the cleaning woman did not turn up in the
  morning and I helped Walters to tidy the master's sitting-room. I remember
  that morning because I found a little black lid--well it was hardly a lid--I
  have got it here if you would like to see it. I have often wondered what it
  was for."</p>

  <p>"Lid," said Tab. "What kind of a lid?"</p>

  <p>"It was like the lid of a small pill-box," explained the woman, "about the
  size of a threepenny-piece. I picked it up and asked Mr. Walters what it was
  for, and he said he didn't know. It was on the floor near the table and I
  brought it home, meaning to ask my husband what it was."</p>

  <p>She went out of the room and returned with the "lid," which proved on
  examination to be a celluloid cap such as typists use to cover their
  keys.</p>

  <p>"Had Mr. Trasmere a typewriter?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir," she answered, shaking her head, "not so far as I know. I have
  never seen one. As I say, I have only been that once into the house. The
  kitchen is built away from the living rooms, although it is connected; Mr.
  Trasmere gave strict orders that I was to keep to my kitchen."</p>

  <p>Tab looked at the little cap which he held between his finger and thumb.
  It was undoubtedly part of a typist's equipment, and yet Mr. Trasmere had
  never employed a typist. He always wrote to Rex in his own hand.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure nobody came during the day to take your master's
  correspondence?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No; I am perfectly sure Mr. Walters would have told me. He used to
  complain how dull it was because nobody came to the house at all, and he was
  rather partial to young women, so I am sure I should have heard. Have they
  found Mr. Walters? I'm certain he didn't do it."</p>

  <p>Tab satisfied her on that point.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember the Greens?" he asked, remembering just as he was on the
  point of leaving the house the witnesses to the old man's will.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, not really," she said. "Mrs. Green was cook before me and I saw
  her once, the day I came, and Mr. Green too. They were a very nice couple and
  I don't think the master treated them very well."</p>

  <p>"Where are they now?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, sir," she said. "I did hear that they had gone to
  Australia. They were middle-aged people, but very strong and healthy, and Mr.
  Green was always talking about going to Australia, where he was born, and
  settling down there."</p>

  <p>"Did Green or his wife have any hard feeling against Mr. Trasmere?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated. "Well, they naturally felt sore because they had been
  accused of thieving, and Mr. Green seemed to feel the disgrace terribly,
  especially when the master had their boxes searched because he had lost some
  valuable silver and a gold watch."</p>

  <p>This was news to Tab. He had heard of the food pilfering, but he had not
  heard of the other losses.</p>

  <p>She could tell him very little more, except that Green had acted as a sort
  of butler.</p>

  <p>"Was Walters there at the time?" asked Tab.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir; he was Mr. Trasmere's valet. After Mr. Green went Mr. Walters
  was butler and valet, too."</p>

  <p>Tab went straight to the office to write the story up to date, but he knew
  that it was a waste of labour, since some news was certain to come in before
  nightfall.</p>

  <p>The news-editor was at his desk when he pushed open the big swing doors
  and came into the news-room to report.</p>

  <p>"These front page crimes always come together in shoals," complained the
  news-editor bitterly. "I have another very good story--"</p>

  <p>"Well, give it to a good story writer," said Tab. "This case is going to
  occupy not only my time, but the time of half a dozen men very fully
  indeed."</p>

  <p>"What is the new sensation?" he asked sarcastically.</p>

  <p>"An actress has lost her jewels, which does not sound tremendously
  exciting," said the news-editor, fishing for two slips of paper on which he
  had made a rough note of the case, "but you needn't bother about that. I'll
  put another man on the story as soon as I can get one."</p>

  <p>"Who is the actress?"</p>

  <p>"Ursula Ardfern," replied the editor, and Tab's jaw dropped.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch8"
     id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

  <p class="first">"URSULA ARDFERN! She is not the kind of person who would
  mislay her jewels for the sake of a few lines of advertising," he said.
  "Where did she lose them?"</p>

  <p>"It is rather a curious story," said the editor, leaning back in his
  chair, his hands clasped behind his head. "She went into a post office on
  Saturday morning on her way to the theatre for the matinee, bought some
  stamps, putting the jewel-case down on the counter by her side. When she
  looked round, the case was gone. It happened so suddenly and in such a
  surprisingly short space of time that she could not believe her eyes, and did
  not even complain to the post office officials.</p>

  <p>"Her own story is, that she thought she must be suffering from some kind
  of delusion and that she had not brought the jewel-case out at all. She went
  back to her suite at the Central Hotel and searched every room. By the time
  she was through, it was near the hour for her matinee, and she hurried down
  to the theatre--anyway, to cut a long story short, she did not report her
  loss to the police until this morning."</p>

  <p>"She wouldn't," said Tab stoutly. "She's the kind of girl who would hate
  the publicity of it and would do all she could to make sure there was not a
  simple explanation of their loss before she put the matter in the hands of
  the police."</p>

  <p>"You know her, eh?"</p>

  <p>"I know her in the sense that a reporter knows almost everybody, from the
  Secretary of State to the hangman," said Tab, "but I'll take this story if
  you like. There will be nothing doing on the Trasmere case before the
  evening. She stays at the Central, does she?"</p>

  <p>The other nodded.</p>

  <p>"You will need to exercise a little ingenuity," he said, "especially if
  what you say about her hating publicity is true. I'd like to get a photograph
  of the actress who hated publicity and hang it up in this office," he
  added.</p>

  <p>At the Central Hotel Tab found himself up against a blank wall.</p>

  <p>"Miss Ardfern is not receiving callers," said the inquiry clerk. He was
  not even certain that she was in.</p>

  <p>"Will you send my card up?"</p>

  <p>The clerk very emphatically said that he would not send up anybody's card.
  Tab went straight to the supreme authority.</p>

  <p>Fortunately he knew the hotel manager very well, but on this occasion
  Crispi was not inclined to oblige him.</p>

  <p>"Miss Ardfern is a very good customer of ours, Holland," he said, "and we
  don't want to offend her. I will tell you, in the strictest confidence, that
  Miss Ardfern is not in the hotel."</p>

  <p>"Where is she?"</p>

  <p>"She went away this morning in her car to her country cottage. She always
  spends Sunday and Sunday night in the country, and I know that she does not
  want to see any reporters, because she came back this morning especially to
  tell me that the staff were to answer no inquiries relative to herself."</p>

  <p>"Where is this country cottage--come on, Crispi," wheedled Tab, "or the
  next time you have a robbery in this hotel I'll make a front-page item of
  it."</p>

  <p>"That is blackmail," murmured Crispi, protestingly. "I am afraid I cannot
  tell you, Holland. Maybe if you get a Hertford directory--"</p>

  <p>In the office library he found the directory and turned its pages. Against
  the name of "Ardfern, Ursula," was "Stone Cottage, near Blisville
  Village."</p>

  <p>The distance from town was some forty-five miles, and the route carried
  him past an unfinished building which one day was to play its part in the
  ending of many mysteries. Tab covered the ground on a fast motor-cycle in
  just over an hour.</p>

  <p>He leant his machine against a very trim hedge, opened the high garden
  gate, and walked into the beautiful little garden that surrounded Stone
  Cottage, which was not ill-named, though the stone which composed its walls
  was completely hidden by purple-flowering creeper.</p>

  <p>In the shade of a tree he saw a white figure stretched at her ease, a
  figure which sat bolt upright in her deep garden chair at the click of the
  gate-lock.</p>

  <p>"This is too bad of you, Mr. Tab," said Ursula Ardfern reproachfully. "I
  particularly asked Crispi not to tell anybody where I was."</p>

  <p>"Crispi didn't tell. I found you in a directory," said Tab cheerfully.</p>

  <p>The sunlight was very kind to Ursula, and it seemed to him that she looked
  even more beautiful in these surroundings than she had in the generous
  setting and the more merciful lighting of the theatre.</p>

  <p>She was slimmer than he had thought, and conveyed an extraordinary
  impression of hurt youth. Somewhere, some time, this girl had suffered, he
  thought, yet there was no hint of old pain in her unlined face, no suggestion
  of sorrow or remorse in her clear blue eyes.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you have come to cross-examine me about my jewels," she said,
  "and I will allow you, on one condition, to ask me any question you
  wish."</p>

  <p>"What is the condition?" he smiled.</p>

  <p>"Bring up that chair." She pointed across the strip of lawn.</p>

  <p>"Now sit down"; and when he had obeyed, "The condition is this: that you
  will confine yourself to saying that I have no recollection of the jewels
  being taken, but I shall be very glad to have them back and pay a suitable
  reward; that they were not as expensive as most people thought and that I am
  not insured against loss by theft."</p>

  <p>"All of which I will faithfully record," said Tab. "I am an honest man and
  keep my promises. I admit it."</p>

  <p>"And now I will tell you, for your own private ear," she said, "that if I
  never see those jewels again, I shall be a very happy woman."</p>

  <p>He looked at her open-mouthed.</p>

  <p>"You don't think I am posing, do you?" She looked round at him
  suspiciously. "I see that you don't. I am not in the least worried that I
  shall have to play the part with property jewels as I did last night."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you go to the police before?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Because I didn't," was her unsatisfactory but uncompromising reply. "You
  may put whatever interpretation you like upon my slackness. You may say that
  it was because of my humanity, my desire to save some person from being
  accused, or coming under suspicion of having stolen the pieces, when all the
  time they were snug in my bureau drawer, or you may think or say that I did
  not want to make a fuss about them. In fact," she smiled, "you can do or say
  what you wish."</p>

  <p>"You don't remember who was standing by you--"</p>

  <p>She stopped him with a gesture. "I remember nothing except that I bought
  ten stamps."</p>

  <p>"What was the jewellery worth?" he persisted.</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders. "I can't even tell you that," she said.</p>

  <p>"Had they any history?"</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"You are very persistent, Mr. Tab." Her eyes were smiling at him, though
  her face was composed. "And now, since you have surprised me in my Abode of
  Quiet, I must show you over my little domain."</p>

  <p>She took him round the garden and through the tiny pine wood at the back
  of the house, chatting all the time; and then after leaving him, as she said,
  to ensure that her room was tidy, she beckoned him into a large and pleasant
  sitting-room, tastefully, if not expensively furnished, a cool, quiet haven
  of rest.</p>

  <p>He had arrived at two o'clock and it was five o'clock before he
  reluctantly took his leave. And all that afternoon they had talked of books
  and of people, and since she had not mentioned or spoken of the murder which
  had engrossed his thoughts until her soothing presence had made Mayfield seem
  very remote and crime a thing of distaste, he did not introduce so jarring a
  discordance into the lavender atmosphere of her retreat.</p>

  <p>"What kind of story do you call this?" snapped the news-editor when Tab
  handed him two folios of copy.</p>

  <p>"From a literary point of view," said Tab, "it is a classic."</p>

  <p>"From a news point of view, it is rotten," said the editor. "The only new
  fact you have discovered is that she loves Browning, and maybe even the
  police know that!"</p>

  <p>He grumbled, but accepted the copy, and with his blue pencil committed
  certain acts of savage mutilation, what time Tab was making his final
  round-up of the Trasmere case.</p>

  <p>Here again very little new matter was available. Walters and the man
  Wellington Brown were still at liberty, and he had to confine himself to a
  sketch of Trasmere's life, material for which had, from time to time, been
  supplied to him by the Babe.</p>

  <p>The new millionaire he had not seen all day. When he got home that night
  he found Rex Lander in bed and asleep and did not disturb him. He was tired
  to death and more anxious to make acquaintance with his hard pillow than he
  was to discuss Ursula Ardfern. In truth, he was not prepared to discuss
  Ursula at all with any third person.</p>

  <p>"I just loafed around," said Rex the next morning, when asked to give an
  account of his movements. "I had a very bad night and was up early. You were
  sleeping like a pig when I looked in. I read your story in The Megaphone--by
  the way you know that Miss Ardfern's jewellery has been stolen?"</p>

  <p>"I know that very well indeed," said Tab, "I saw her yesterday."</p>

  <p>Rex was instant attention.</p>

  <p>"Where?" he asked eagerly. "What is she like, Tab--I mean off the stage?
  Is she as beautiful--what colour eyes has she?"</p>

  <p>Tab pushed back his chair and frowned at the young man across the
  table.</p>

  <p>"Your curiosity is indecent," he said severely; "really, Rex, I never
  dreamt that you were so interested in the lady."</p>

  <p>Rex did not meet his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I think she is very beautiful," he said doggedly. "I'd give my head to
  spend a day with her."</p>

  <p>"Phew!" said Tab. "Why, you young devil, you are in love with her!"</p>

  <p>Rex's babyish face went crimson.</p>

  <p>"Stuff," he said loudly. "I am very fond of her. I have seen her a hundred
  times, I suppose, though I have never spoken to her once. She is my idea of
  the perfect woman. Beautiful of face, with the loveliest voice I have ever
  heard. I am going to know her one day."</p>

  <p>This revelation of Babe's secret passion was, for some reason, which Tab
  could not define, an extremely disquieting one.</p>

  <p>"My dear Babe," he said more mildly, "the young lady is not of the loving
  or marrying sort--"</p>

  <p>Suddenly he remembered.</p>

  <p>"Why, you are a millionaire now, Babe! Jumping Moses!"</p>

  <p>Rex blushed again, and then Tab whistled.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean in all seriousness that you are truly fond of her?"</p>

  <p>"I adore her," said Rex in a low voice. "I got so rattled when I heard a
  fellow say she was going to be married that I had to send you to see
  her."</p>

  <p>Tab interrupted him with a roar of delighted laughter.</p>

  <p>"So that was why I was sent on a fool's errand, eh?" he asked, his eyes
  dancing. "You subtle dog! It was to bring balm to your bruised heart that an
  eminent crime specialist must stand, hat in hand, in the dingy purlieus of a
  playhouse, begging admission to the great actress's dressing-room." He was
  serious in a moment. "I hope this isn't a very violent attachment of yours,
  Rex," he said quietly. "In the first place it struck me that Ursula Ardfern
  is not of the marrying kind, that even your great possessions would not tempt
  her. In the second place--" he stopped himself.</p>

  <p>"Well?" asked Rex impatiently. "Whatever other just cause or impediment do
  you see?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know that it is any business of mine," said Tab, "and I certainly
  am not in a position to give you fatherly advice."</p>

  <p>"You mean that an actress is the worst kind of wife a man can have, I
  suppose. I have heard all that rubbish before. Poor Uncle Jesse, when I spoke
  about it--"</p>

  <p>"You spoke to him of your--liking for Ursula Ardfern?" asked Tab in
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"Of course I didn't," said the other scornfully. "I approached it in a
  roundabout sort of way. Uncle Jesse foamed at the mouth. It was then he told
  me that he was going to leave all his money away from me. He said horrible
  things about actresses."</p>

  <p>Tab was silent, a little puzzled at himself. What did it matter to him,
  anyway, that Rex Lander should be head over heels in love with the girl? Yet,
  for some mysterious reason, he regarded Babe's passion as a personal affront
  to himself.</p>

  <p>It was ridiculous, childish in him, and he laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"You think it is darned funny, I daresay," growled Rex, getting up from
  the table in a huff.</p>

  <p>"I was laughing at myself for daring to give advice," said Tab
  truthfully.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch9"
     id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

  <p class="first">TAB was in his own room when Carver called.</p>

  <p>"I have had a talk with some of the High Ones," he said, "and put it up to
  them that you might be of assistance to me. First of all they were horrified
  at the idea of a newspaper reporter being allowed even to smell inside
  information, but I persuaded them at last. I am on my way down to the house
  now, and I thought I would pick you up. I am going through those boxes that
  we didn't search on Saturday."</p>

  <p>Tab heard with mingled feelings. To assist the police actively meant that
  his newspaper stories would suffer. He would not be allowed to use any of the
  information he secured except in the tamest, most colourless form. If he
  remained outside, he was fairly certain to get a line to the crime, which he
  might use without laying himself open to the charge of breaking faith. There
  was no time to discover the mind of his chief on the subject--he had to make
  an instant decision.</p>

  <p>"I'll go," he said. "This means, of course, that I shall only be able to
  write the punk stuff that the evening papers print, but I'll take a
  chance."</p>

  <p>He was surprised, when he came out into Doughty Street, to find that a
  private car had been placed at Carver's disposal.</p>

  <p>Knowing the parsimony of headquarters, he expressed his surprise.</p>

  <p>"It is Mr. Trasmere's own. He has had it garaged for the past year, but
  Mr. Lander gave us permission to get it out, and offered to pay the running
  expenses."</p>

  <p>"Good old Babe," said Tab, sinking back into the carriage seat. "He didn't
  tell me anything about it."</p>

  <p>Nearing the house, Carver broke the silence.</p>

  <p>"I have something to show you later," he said. "Our men have been at the
  post office all night, making inquiries as to Mr. Trasmere's correspondence.
  It appears that he has had a whole lot during the past year or two. We shall
  probably come across it in the boxes that remain unsearched. But that wasn't
  the big thing we found. Most of the telegraph staff were off duty yesterday.
  It was only this morning that we learnt a telegram had been received at
  Mayfield about ten minutes before Walters disappeared."</p>

  <p>When they were in the sitting-room and the door was closed, Carver
  produced the telegram from his pocket. It was handed in at the General Post
  Office and ran:</p>

  <p>"Remember 17th July, 1915. Newcastle police coming for you at three
  o'clock."</p>

  <p>It was unsigned.</p>

  <p>"I have been searching the newspaper files this morning," said Carver, "to
  discover the reference to that date. On the 17th July, 1913, I find that
  Felling was sent down at Newcastle for seven years, and the judge said that
  if he ever came before him again on a similar charge he would send him down
  for life."</p>

  <p>"Then the telegram was despatched by some friend of Walters?" suggested
  Tab.</p>

  <p>Carver nodded.</p>

  <p>"It was delivered five minutes before he disappeared; that is to say,
  exactly at five minutes to three. I have seen the lad who delivered the
  telegram, and he says that Walters himself took in the message."</p>

  <p>"Would that account for his disappearance?"</p>

  <p>"In a sense it might, yet it does not necessarily follow that Waiters is
  innocent of the murder. The telegram may have come to him immediately after
  the murder was committed and have decided him to get away. If he was
  responsible for the murder, there would be even more reason why he should
  leave in a hurry. The arrival of the police, who would find the body, would,
  of course, have been fatal to him."</p>

  <p>"Did anybody see Wellington Brown go into the house?" asked Tab. It was a
  question he meant to have put before.</p>

  <p>"Nobody," said the detective. "At what hour he arrived only Walters can
  tell us."</p>

  <p>He folded the telegram and put it away, then unlocking the door from the
  study which led to the passage, he went down the steps and, stopping only to
  switch on the lights, made his way into the vault. One by one the boxes were
  taken down, emptied of their contents, and carefully examined.</p>

  <p>Money was everywhere: bank-notes, treasury bills, money in the greasy
  notes of a Chinese Government bank, money in the shape of Greek drachmas and
  Italian lira. Sometimes a box would contain nothing but these valuable
  squares of paper, sometimes a box held thick packets of correspondence
  addressed to Trasmere, at queer-looking towns in Northern China. All bore the
  same clerkly number, generally written in green ink, and none of them threw
  any light whatever upon the tragedy they were investigating.</p>

  <p>In the last box of all the correspondence was more recent. It was mostly
  typewritten copies of letters, evidently addressed by the dead man to various
  corporations with whom he had dealings, and these they went through letter by
  letter.</p>

  <p>"Where were those typed?" said Carver. "And when? He doesn't seem to have
  kept a secretary."</p>

  <p>Until that moment Tab had forgotten the discovery of the
  typewriter-key-cover. Now he referred to the find.</p>

  <p>"But he used to go out every night at half-past six and remain away until
  half-past eight," said Tab. "Probably he went to some typewriting
  office--there are a few in the city which make a speciality of after-hours
  work."</p>

  <p>"That is possible," admitted Carver. "There is nothing here. I have sent
  anything that looked important to the translators--I don't think it is worth
  while sending the trading accounts of '89." He put the papers carefully back
  into the box. "And that's the lot," he said.</p>

  <p>Tab was standing with his back to the lower shelf to the right hand of the
  door, and his fingers were idly touching the plain strip of steel when he
  felt something underneath and, looking down, saw that the obstruction which
  his fingers had found was one of two slides on which hung a drawer. They had
  been pushed so far back that it was impossible to see it from where they had
  stood.</p>

  <p>The detective stooped and picked it out.</p>

  <p>"Hullo," he said, "what are these?"</p>

  <p>He brought out first a small box of Chinese workmanship.</p>

  <p>It was exquisitely lacquered in pale green. Lifting off the lid he saw
  that it was empty.</p>

  <p>"Nothing there--some curio he was hoarding," said Carver.</p>

  <p>Next he produced a small brown jewel-case from the drawer, and putting it
  on the broad shelf, opened it.</p>

  <p>Even before he saw the heart-shaped ruby brooch that was pinned to the
  satin lining of the lid, Tab knew what it was.</p>

  <p>"Those are Ursula Ardfern's jewels," he said, and they looked at one
  another.</p>

  <p>"The jewels that were stolen on Saturday morning?" asked the detective
  incredulously.</p>

  <p>Tab nodded, and the detective took out an emerald cross, turned it over,
  looked at its face, then put it back again.</p>

  <p>"On Saturday morning," he said slowly, "if I remember the facts aright,
  and I only read them in the newspaper this morning. Miss Ursula Ardfern went
  into a post office to buy some stamps. Whilst she was there she put her
  jewel-case by her side, and looking round, discovered it was gone. Thinking
  she had made some mistake, she went back to her hotel and searched her room.
  She reported it to the police on Sunday morning."</p>

  <p>"That is the case as I understand it," said Tab, who was as dumbfounded as
  his companion.</p>

  <p>"And three or four hours after Miss Ardfern lost her jewels, Trasmere was
  murdered in this room. The jewels were here at that time, because obviously
  nobody has been in or out of this room since Trasmere was murdered, except
  possibly the murderer; in other words, in the space of two hours the jewels
  were stolen and conveyed to Jesse Trasmere and locked in his
  strong-room--why?" He stared at Tab.</p>

  <p>Tab could only stare back. Carver scratched his head, massaged the back of
  his neck irritably, rubbed his chin, and then: "In other circumstances one
  would say that Trasmere was a receiver. I have known some very unlikely
  people who were receivers of stolen property and grew rich on the proceeds,
  and I have known very unlikely folk to lend money, not only to actresses, but
  very substantial people, on the security of their jewels. Had we not Miss
  Ardfern's report of their loss, the obvious explanation would have been that
  these had been pledged to Trasmere in security for a loan."</p>

  <p>"I am perfectly sure she doesn't know Trasmere. I happen to be--an--an
  acquaintance of hers," said Tab quickly.</p>

  <p>Again the detective was giving contortional evidence of his perplexity.
  His long face was longer still, his down-turned mouth more melancholy.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, there is no question of pledge. The only thing we have to decide
  is, whether he was the kind of man who would receive stolen property." He
  glanced round at the black boxes which filled the shelves and shook his head.
  "The probability is all against that theory," he said. "Trasmere was too rich
  a man to run the risk. Besides, we should have found other property. It is
  not likely that he would act as receiver for one gang of thieves, and for
  only one of their crimes."</p>

  <p>He hoisted himself to the top of the table, pushed his hands in his
  trousers pockets and, with his chin on his breast, considered.</p>

  <p>"Now that beats me," he said at last. "I admit that I am thoroughly and
  absolutely beaten. You are perfectly sure that these are Miss Ardfern's
  jewels?"</p>

  <p>"I am absolutely certain that it is her jewel-case. Probably at
  headquarters they have a description of the jewels which are lost," said
  Tab.</p>

  <p>"Then we'll settle that little mystery at once."</p>

  <p>He was telephoning for a quarter of an hour, taking notes all the time;
  and when he hung up the receiver he turned to Tab.</p>

  <p>"Without having carefully looked at the pieces in that box," he said. "I
  think it is absolutely certain that those jewels are Miss Ardfern's. She gave
  a fairly complete list to the police, but could not remember every item. We
  will go along and check our inventory."</p>

  <p>He had not been at work long before it was clear that the jewellery was
  Ursula Ardfern's property.</p>

  <p>"Go along and see her, Tab," said Carver. "Take the empty box with you--we
  had better hold on to the jewellery a little longer--and ask her to identify
  the case."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

  <p class="first">URSULA had only arrived a few minutes before Tab reached the
  Central Hotel, and the ban against reporters must have been lifted, because
  Ursula saw him immediately.</p>

  <p>She took the case from his hand slowly, and with a face from whence all
  expression had fled.</p>

  <p>"Yes, this is mine," she said. She lifted the lid. "Where are the jewels?"
  she asked quickly.</p>

  <p>"The police have those."</p>

  <p>"The police?"</p>

  <p>"It was found in the strong-room of Jesse Trasmere, the old man who was
  murdered on Saturday afternoon," said Tab. "Have you any idea how they came
  into his possession?"</p>

  <p>"None," she said emphatically. "I did not know Mr. Trasmere."</p>

  <p>He told her about the murder, but apparently she had already read the
  details and seemed loath to discuss the matter until he told her the part
  that he himself was taking in the tracking of the murderer.</p>

  <p>"Where did you find these?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"In his strong-room. The curious thing is we turned out all the boxes, ran
  over all the papers, and found nothing of importance. It was only by accident
  that we discovered this case. It was in a little drawer pushed far under one
  of the shelves."</p>

  <p>"You went through all the papers," she repeated mechanically. "What sort
  of papers--did he have--many?"</p>

  <p>"Quite a number," said Tab, surprised that after definitely and decidedly
  changing the subject she had returned to it voluntarily. "Old bills and
  accounts, copies of letters, and that sort of thing. Nothing of any very
  great importance. Why do you ask?"</p>

  <p>"I had a friend once, a girl who was interested in Mr. Trasmere," she
  answered. "She told me that he was keeping a number of documents connected
  with her family. No, I don't remember her name. She was an actress I met on
  tour."</p>

  <p>"There was nothing in his papers except purely business records," said
  Tab.</p>

  <p>Tab was very sensitive to atmosphere. He could have sworn when he came
  into the room that she had keyed herself up to meet him. There was no reason
  why she should, except the reluctance to discuss the robbery, and she
  maintained that tense attitude throughout the interview. Now he was as
  certain that she was relieved, he sensed, rather than saw, a relaxation of
  mind. Probably it was only his imagination, but imagination had never played
  such a trick upon him before.</p>

  <p>"When are the police going to give me my beautiful jewels?" she asked,
  almost gaily.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid they will retain those until after the court proceedings are
  through. There must be an inquest, you know."</p>

  <p>"Oh," she said, and seemed disappointed. Then again she returned to the
  murder. "It seems all so dreadful and mysterious," she said quietly. "How do
  you account for it, Mr. Holland? One of the newspapers says that it was
  impossible that any other hand than Mr. Trasmere's could have locked the
  door, and yet they are equally certain that he did not commit suicide. And
  who is the man Brown for whom they are searching?"</p>

  <p>"He is an adventurer from China who was at some time or other a sort of
  secretary to old Trasmere."</p>

  <p>"A secretary?" she said quickly. "A man--how do you know that?"</p>

  <p>"Brown told me himself, I saw him the day before the murder. Apparently
  Trasmere had treated him badly and had held him off for years by paying him a
  sum of money."</p>

  <p>She hit her lip in thought.</p>

  <p>"Why did he come hack?" she said, half to herself. "He might have lived
  comfortably on the allowance. I suppose it was a good allowance?" she added
  quickly. "That is all you want to see me about, Mr. Holland?"</p>

  <p>"You may have to go to the police station to identify the jewellery," said
  Tab; "and they are pretty certain to ask you how the box came into Mr.
  Trasmere's possession."</p>

  <p>She did not answer this, and he left her with an odd feeling of
  uneasiness.</p>

  <p>Going to report the result of his interview to Carver, he found that
  energetic man crawling about the vault on all fours. He looked over his
  shoulder at the sound of Tab's footsteps.</p>

  <p>"Was Saturday wet or fine?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It was a particularly fine day."</p>

  <p>"Then this must be a blood impression." He pointed to the floor, and Tab
  went on his knees at his side. There was a faint half-moon printed on the
  edge of the concrete. "That is the edge of a heel, and a rubber heel," said
  Carver, "which proves beyond any doubt whatever that somebody came into the
  vault after the old man was killed, probably went close to the body to see
  the effect of the shot, and in doing so got a little of the blood on a part
  of his heel. The rubber accounts for his coming on Trasmere without the old
  man hearing him. There is no other impression that I can find."</p>

  <p>"Which brings us back to the question of the duplicate key."</p>

  <p>"There was no duplicate key; you can cut that idea right out," said
  Carver, getting up and dusting his knees. "I have been into the matter very
  thoroughly with the manufacturers, and although they each claim to have the
  best kind of lock and are naturally inclined to take an uncharitable view of
  their rivals, they say that the maker of our particular key is reliable, and
  he says that it was in the hands of his most trustworthy man, and that no
  second key was ever made. Not only that, but no drawing of the key was kept.
  In fact, the lock, just before it was fitted, was altered by the
  manufacturer's expert here, on the premises. I am seeing him to-morrow, but
  from what I learnt on the telephone he says that we can dismiss from our
  minds the possibility of there being a duplicate."</p>

  <p>"But Walters was making--"</p>

  <p>"Walters hadn't finished his job; and even if he had, he could not have
  fashioned a key that would have unlocked this door, clever as he was. No; the
  blood-stained key is the key that locked the door. What is more, it is the
  key which the old man carried on a thin silver chain round his neck. We found
  the broken ends of the chain in his clothing after the body was searched.
  Then again, there are the bloodstains, both on the inside and on the outside
  of the door. That is the most remarkable feature of the case, that after the
  murder the door was locked both from the inside and the outside. At one
  period, after the death of Trasmere, the murderer must have been locked in
  this vault with him. If I did not know it was an absolute impossibility I
  should say that it was locked finally from the inside, the key was placed on
  the table, and the murderer disappeared through some secret entrance, which
  we know very well does not exist."</p>

  <p>"Have you tested the roof?"</p>

  <p>"I have tested everywhere--roof, walls, floor, and door," said Carver. "A
  fact which may or may not be important, is that there is about an eighth of
  an inch of space between the bottom of the door and the floor. If the key had
  been found on the floor there would be no mystery about the matter, because
  the murderer could have pushed it under and, with a flick of his finger, sent
  it into the middle of the room. Here is the situation in a nutshell." He
  ticked off the points on his fingers. "Trasmere is murdered in a vault, the
  door of which is locked. The murderer is either Brown, who has threatened
  him, or Walters, who has been robbing him. Inside the locked vault is found
  the only key which could open or close it. Note this particularly, that
  Trasmere was shot in the back."</p>

  <p>"Why is that important?"</p>

  <p>"As proving that at the moment of his murder Trasmere was in no fear. He
  was not expecting either to be shot or hurt. And now we add to the situation,
  which is sufficiently baffling, the discovery in the vault of a jewel-case
  belonging to an eminent actress, from whom it has been stolen on the very day
  of the murder. This is the case which I must take to a coroner's jury. It
  doesn't look very good to me."</p>

  <p>It did not "look very good" to the coroner's jury which contented itself a
  week later with returning a verdict of wilful murder against some person or
  persons unknown, and added a rider expressing its dissatisfaction with the
  inefficiency of the police.</p>

  <p>The day that verdict was returned, Ursula Ardfern fainted twice in the
  course of her performance and was carried home to her hotel in a condition of
  collapse.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

  <p class="first">A MURDER lends to the locality in which it is perpetrated a
  certain left-handed fame which those of its inhabitants who appear most
  disgusted most enjoy. Human nature being what it is, trouble and misery have
  a larger sale-value to newspapers than have comfort and happiness. Nothing
  makes a newspaper reader more conscious of the emptiness of his journal than
  to learn that his insignificant neighbour has unexpectedly inherited a
  fortune. Therefore it is only natural that when the average man or woman
  finds himself or herself promoted from mere observer to participant, however
  indirect, he or she experiences a queer satisfaction that is no less
  satisfying because it is queer.</p>

  <p>The woman of the house may shudder and make unusual efforts to "keep it
  from the children," but she listens avidly to the cook's inside story of the
  crime that was committed next door, and presses for further details. The man
  may express his horror and indignation and talk of leaving his house and
  finding another in a less notorious neighbourhood, but for years he will
  point out to his visitors and guests the window of the room where the fell
  deed was done.</p>

  <p>Opposite to Mayfield was the home of John Fergusson Stott, who, in
  addition to being a neighbour of the late Jesse Trasmere, was the employer of
  his nephew. This gave him an especial title to speak as an Authority. It
  supported him also in his determination to Say Nothing.</p>

  <p>"It is bad enough, my dear, to be living in the street where this ghastly
  crime has been committed. I cannot afford to be dragged into the matter."</p>

  <p>He was a small, fat man, very bald, and he wore spectacles of great
  magnifying power.</p>

  <p>"Eline says--" began his buxom wife.</p>

  <p>Mr. Stott held up a podgy hand and closed his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Servants' gossip?" said he. "Let us keep out of this business. I cannot
  afford to have my name in the papers. Why we should have the house full of
  reporters in no time! And the police too. I had quite trouble enough over the
  dog's licence, without wanting to see the police again."</p>

  <p>He sat soberly in his place before the window, glaring out at the
  darkening street. A light flitted to and fro in one of the upper windows of
  Mayfield, came and went and came again.</p>

  <p>The police were searching. He was interested. To-morrow, when he met the
  men at Toby's, he would be able to say: "They are still searching old
  Trasmere's house. I saw them last night--the house is just opposite to
  mine."</p>

  <p>Presently the light disappeared for good, and he turned to his wife.</p>

  <p>"What did Eline say? Ring for her."</p>

  <p>Eline was a parlour-maid, grown of a sudden from the merest cypher in the
  great sum of parlour-maids to an isolated and important factor.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure it gives me the shivers to talk about it, sir," she said.
  "Little did I ever think I should be mixed up in a case like this. I'm sure
  that I'd die if I was ever called into court to give evidence."</p>

  <p>"You will not be called into court," said Mr. Stott decisively. "This must
  go no farther, do you understand that, Eline?"</p>

  <p>Eline said she did, but she seemed in no way pleased that she was to be
  spared the painful publicity.</p>

  <p>"I've had toothache for the past fortnight--"</p>

  <p>"You should have it out," said Mr. Stott. An opportunity for advising
  sufferers to have their teeth extracted is one which no normal man can miss.
  "It is always best to deal drastically with a decaying tooth. Out with it, my
  girl--well?"</p>

  <p>"It comes on about half-past eleven and goes off at two. I could set the
  clock by it."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," said Mr. Stott testily, his interest in Eline's misfortune
  ended; "but what did you see at Mayfield?"</p>

  <p>"I usually sit at the window until the pain has gone," said Eline, and Mr.
  Stott resisted the temptation to tell her that that was the very last place
  in the world where she ought to sit, "and naturally anything that happens in
  the street I see. The first night I was sitting there, I saw a little
  motor-car drive up to the front of the house. A lady got out--"</p>

  <p>"A lady?"</p>

  <p>"Well...she might have been a woman," admitted Eline. "But she got out,
  opened the gates and drove into the garden. I thought that was funny, because
  Mr. Trasmere hasn't a garage, and I knew there was nobody staying with
  him."</p>

  <p>"Where did the car go?"</p>

  <p>"Just into the garden. There is plenty of room for it, because it is not
  exactly a garden-more like a yard than anything, I think she took the car
  near the house and put out all the lights. Then she went up the steps and
  opened the door. There was a light in the passage the first night, and I saw
  her taking the key out before she shut the door. She hadn't been in the house
  a few minutes before I saw a man on a bicycle coming along the road. He
  jumped down and propped the Machine against the kerb. What struck me about
  him was the funny way he walked. Sort of queer little steps he took. He was
  smoking a cigar."</p>

  <p>"Where did he go?" asked Mr. Stott.</p>

  <p>"Only as far as the gate and leant on it, smoking. By and by he threw away
  his cigar and lit another, and I saw his face--it was a Chinaman!"</p>

  <p>"Good God!" said Mr. Stott. The mental picture she conjured of a Chinaman
  lighting a cigar in the vicinity of Mr. Stott's stately home was a
  particularly revolting one.</p>

  <p>"Just before the policeman came along he went back to his bicycle and rode
  away, but after the policeman had passed he came back again and stood leaning
  on the gate until the front door of Mayfield opened. Then he sort of slunk
  back to his bicycle and rode in the opposite direction--I mean opposite to
  the way he had come. He had hardly got out of sight before I saw the lady
  come down and open the gates. Soon after she brought out the car, got down,
  closed the gates again, and drove away. And then I saw the Chinaman riding
  behind and pedalling like mad, as if he was trying to catch up the car."</p>

  <p>"Extraordinary!" said Mr. Stott. "This happened once?"</p>

  <p>"It happened every night--Friday was the last night," said Eline
  impressively--"the lady in the car, the Chinaman, and everything. But on
  Sunday night two Chinamen came, and one went into the garden and was there
  for a long time. I knew the other one was a Chinaman because he walked so
  curiously. But they didn't come on bicycles. They had a car, which stopped at
  the far end of the street."</p>

  <p>"Remarkable!" said Mr. Stott, and stroked his smooth face.</p>

  <p>Eline had finished her story, but was reluctant to surrender her position
  as news gleaner.</p>

  <p>"The police have been taking things away from the house all day," reported
  the observer, "boxes and trunks. The girl at Pine Lodge told me that they are
  leaving there to-night. They've been keeping guard on the house ever since
  the murder."</p>

  <p>"Very, very extraordinary; very remarkable," said Mr. Stott. "But I don't
  think that it is any business of ours. No. Thank you, Eline. I should
  certainly have that tooth out. You mustn't be a baby, and American dentistry
  has reached such a high level of efficiency that--"</p>

  <p>Eline listened respectfully but nervously, and went up to her room to plug
  the aching molar with Dr. Billbery's Kure-Ake.</p>

  <p>It seemed to Mr. Stott that his head had scarcely touched the pillow
  before there came a knock upon the panel of his bedroom door.</p>

  <p>"Yes?" he asked fiercely, in case it was a burglar who was in this polite
  manner seeking admission to his chamber.</p>

  <p>"It is Eline, sir...they're there!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Stott shivered, and, conquering an almost irresistible desire to pull
  the bed-clothes over his head and pretend that he had been talking in his
  sleep, he got reluctantly out of bed and pulled on his dressing-gown. As to
  Mrs. Stott, she never moved. She went to bed, as she had often said, to
  sleep.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Eline--waking me up at this time in the morning?" asked Mr.
  Stott irritably.</p>

  <p>"They are there--the Chinamen. I saw one getting through the window," said
  the girl, her teeth chattering, to the serious disturbance of Dr. Billbery's
  Kure-Ake.</p>

  <p>"Wait a moment until I get my stick."</p>

  <p>Mr. Stott kept hanging to his bed-rail a heavily loaded cane. He had no
  intention of going nearer to Mayfield than the safe side of his dining-room
  window, but the holding of the stick gave him the self-confidence of which he
  was in need.</p>

  <p>Cautiously the girl let up the blind of the dining-room window and
  unfastened the catch. The sash slid up noiselessly and gave them an
  uninterrupted view of Mayfield.</p>

  <p>"There's one!" whispered Eline.</p>

  <p>Standing in the shadow was a figure. Mr. Stott saw it plainly. They
  watched in silence for the greater part of half an hour. Mr. Stott had an
  idea that he ought to telephone for the police, but refrained. In the case of
  ordinary burglars he would not have hesitated. But these were Chinese,
  notoriously clannish and vengeful. He had read stories, in which Chinamen had
  inflicted diabolical injuries upon men who had betrayed them.</p>

  <p>At the end of the half-hour's vigil the door of Mayfield opened and a man
  came out and joined the other. Together they walked up the road, and that was
  the last Mr. Stott saw of them.</p>

  <p>"Very remarkable!" said Mr. Stott profoundly. "I'm glad you called me,
  Eline. I wouldn't have missed this for the world. But you must say nothing
  about this, Eline--nothing. The Chinese people are very blood-thirsty. They
  would think no more of putting you into a barrel full of sharp pointed nails
  and rolling you down a hill, than I should think of--er--lacing my
  shoes."</p>

  <p>So Maple Manor kept its grisly secret, and none knew of Yeh Ling's visit
  to the house of death or his search for the tiny lacquer box wherein Jesse
  Trasmere kept a folded sheet of thin paper elegantly inscribed in Chinese
  characters by Yeh Ling, in his own hand.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

  <p class="first">"URSULA ARDFERN is leaving the stage and is going to live in
  the country."</p>

  <p>Tab made the announcement one evening when he came home from the
  office.</p>

  <p>Rex scarcely seemed interested.</p>

  <p>"Oh?" said Rex.</p>

  <p>That was all he said. He seemed as disinclined as Tab to discuss the
  lady.</p>

  <p>It was his last night at the Doughty Street flat. He was still suffering
  from shock, and his doctor had advised a trip abroad.</p>

  <p>He had suggested that at the end of his vacation he would return to
  Doughty Street, but on this point Tab was firm. "You have a lot of money,
  Babe," he said seriously, "and a man who has a lot of money has also a whole
  lot of responsibilities. There are about a hundred and forty-five reasons why
  our little menage should be broken up, and the most important from my point
  of view is, that I will not be demoralized by living cheek by jowl with a man
  of millions. You have a certain place to take in society, certain duties to
  perform, and you can't keep up the position that you are entitled to keep in
  a half-flat in Doughty Street. I don't suppose you ever want to go to
  Mayfield to live."</p>

  <p>Rex shuddered.</p>

  <p>"I don't," he said, with great earnestness. "I shall shut the place up and
  let it stand for a few years, until the memory of the crime is forgotten, and
  then perhaps somebody will buy it. I am pretty comfortable here, Tab."</p>

  <p>"I am not thinking so much about your comfort as my own," replied Tab
  calmly. "It isn't going to do me a lot of good in any way. Consider yourself
  ejected."</p>

  <p>Rex grinned.</p>

  <p>He sailed for Naples the next afternoon, and Tab went down to the boat to
  see him off. No mention of Ursula Ardfern was made until the landing bell was
  ringing.</p>

  <p>"I am holding you to your promise, Tab, to introduce me to Miss Ardfern,"
  he said, and frowned as though at some unhappy recollection. "I wish to
  heaven she hadn't been mixed up in the business at all. How on earth do you
  account for her jewel-case being in poor Uncle Jesse's vault? By the way, the
  key of that devil room is in my trunk if the police want it. I don't suppose
  they will, for they have the other key now."</p>

  <p>He had asked this question about Ursula's jewels so many times before that
  Tab could not keep count of them. Therefore, he did not attempt to supply a
  satisfactory solution.</p>

  <p>Standing on the pier he watched the big ship gliding down the river, and
  on the whole was glad that the companionship had broken up. He liked Rex and
  Rex liked him, and they had shared happily the mild vicissitudes which came
  to young men with large ambitions and limited incomes. Of the two, Tab had
  been the richer in the old days, and had often helped the other through the
  morasses which grip the ankles of men who systematically live beyond their
  means. And now Babe was in calm waters: for evermore superior to the favours
  of crabbed uncles and businesslike employers; no more would he start at every
  knock the postman rapped, or scowl at the letters which arrived, knowing that
  more than half of them were bills he could not hope to satisfy.</p>

  <p>Nearly a month had passed since the inquest, and all that Tab had heard
  about Ursula was that she had been very ill and was now in the country,
  presumably at the Stone Cottage.</p>

  <p>He had some idea of going down to see her, but thought better of it.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile he had made respectful inquiries about the girl who had so
  impressed him.</p>

  <p>Ursula Ardfern's story was a curious one. She had appeared first in a road
  company, playing small parts and playing them well. Then, without any
  warning, she blossomed forth into management, took a lease of the Athenaeum,
  and appeared playing a secondary role in an adaptation of Tosca--the lead
  being in the capable hands of Mary Farrelli. The dramatic critics were
  mollified by her modesty and pleased with her acting; said they would like to
  see her in a more important part, and hoped that her season would be
  prosperous. They asked, amongst themselves, who was the man behind the show,
  and found no satisfactory answer. Then Tosca came off, after a run of three
  months; she staged The Tremendous Jones, which played for a year, and this
  time she was the leading actress. She had gone from success to success, was
  on the very threshold of a great career. The simple announcement that she had
  retired from the stage for ever was not very seriously believed. Yet it was
  true. Ursula Ardfern had appeared for the last time before the
  footlights.</p>

  <p>The day that Rex sailed she saved Tab any further cogitation by writing to
  him. He found the letter at the office.</p>

  <p>"DEAR MR. HOLLAND.--I wonder if you would come to the Stone Cottage to see
  me? I promise you rather a sensational 'story,' though I realize that it will
  lose much of its importance because I will not have my name mentioned in
  connection."</p>

  <p>Tab would have liked to have gone then and there. He was up the next
  morning at six, and chafed because he could not in decency arrive at the
  house much before lunch.</p>

  <p>It was a glorious June day, warm, with a gentle westerly wind: such a day
  as every doctor with a convalescent patient in his charge hails with joy and
  thankfulness.</p>

  <p>She was reclining where he had seen her on his first visit to Hertford,
  but this time she did not rise, but held out a thin white hand, which he took
  with such exaggerated care that she laughed. She was paler, thinner of face,
  older looking in some indefinite way.</p>

  <p>"You won't break it," she said. "Sit down, Mr. Tab."</p>

  <p>"I like Mr. Tab very much better than I like Mr. Holland," said Tab. "It
  is glorious here. Why do we swelter in the towns?"</p>

  <p>"Because the towns pay us our salaries," she said dryly. "Mr. Holland,
  will you do something for me?"</p>

  <p>He longed to tell her that if she asked him to stand on his head, or lie
  down whilst she wiped her feet upon him, she would be gladly obeyed. Instead:
  "Why, of course," he said.</p>

  <p>"Will you sell some jewels for me? They are those which were found--in
  poor Mr. Trasmere's vault."</p>

  <p>"Sell your jewels," he said in amazement, "why? Are you--" he checked
  himself.</p>

  <p>"I am not very poor," she said quietly. "I have enough money to live
  without working again--my last play was a very great success, and happily the
  profits--" She stopped dead. "At any rate, I am not poor."</p>

  <p>"Then why sell your jewellery? Are you going to buy others?" he blurted
  out.</p>

  <p>She shook her head, and a smile dawned in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"No, my plan is this: I am going to sell the jewellery for what it is
  worth, and then I want you to distribute the money to such charities as you
  think best."</p>

  <p>He was too astonished to answer, and she went on:</p>

  <p>"I know very little about charities and their values. I know in some cases
  all the money subscribed is swallowed up in officials' salaries. But you will
  know these."</p>

  <p>"Are you serious?" he at last found his voice to ask.</p>

  <p>"Quite," she nodded gravely. "I think they are worth from twelve to twenty
  thousand. I am not sure. They are mine," she went on a little defiantly, and
  unnecessarily so, thought Tab, "and I may do as I wish with them. I want them
  to be sold and the money distributed."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear Miss Ardfern--" he began.</p>

  <p>"My dear Mr. Holland!" she mocked him, "you must do as I tell you if you
  are going to help me at all."</p>

  <p>"I'll certainly carry out your wishes," he said; "but it is a weighty lot
  of money to give away."</p>

  <p>"It is a weightier lot of money to keep," she said quietly. "There is
  another favour I ask--you must not write that I am the donor. You can
  describe me as a society woman--a retired tradeswoman, or as anything you
  like; except as an actress; and of course my name must not even be hinted.
  Will you do this?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"I have them here," she said. "I kept them at the hotel and had them sent
  down to me by special messenger yesterday. And now that that business is
  over, come inside and lunch."</p>

  <p>It was very dear to have her leaning on his arm; her dependence thrilled
  him. He wanted to take her up in his arms and carry her through that
  sweet-smelling place, slowly and with dignity, as nurses carry sleeping
  babies. He wondered what she would think and say if she guessed his thoughts.
  It made him hot to consider the possibility for a second.</p>

  <p>She did not go direct to the house, but took him through a sunken patch
  hidden by low bushes, and he stopped and admired, for here a master hand had
  laid out a Chinese garden with tiny bridges and dwarf trees and great clumps
  of waxen rock flowers that harboured a faint and delicate scent, a hint of
  which came up to him.</p>

  <p>"You were thinking of carrying me," she said, a propos of nothing.</p>

  <p>Tab went a fiery red.</p>

  <p>"But for the proprieties, I should like it. Do you like babies, Mr.
  Tab?"</p>

  <p>"I love 'em," said he, glad to reach a less embarrassing topic.</p>

  <p>"So do I--I have seen so many when I was a child. They are wonderful. It
  seems to me that they are so near to the source of life, they bring with them
  the very fragrance of God."</p>

  <p>He was silent, impressed, a little bewildered. Where had she seen "so
  many" babies? Had she been a nurse? She had not been talking for effect...He
  knew an actress once, the only other one he had interviewed, who had quoted
  Ovid and Herrick and talked with astonishing ease and fluency on the
  Byzantine Empire. He learnt from a friend that she possessed an extraordinary
  memory, and had read up these subjects before he came, in order to get a good
  story about herself. She had the story.</p>

  <p>No, Ursula was different. He wished he had lifted her up in his arms when
  she had spoken about being carried.</p>

  <p>Over the meal the talk took a personal turn.</p>

  <p>"Have you many friends?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Only one," smiled Tab "and he's now so rich that I can scarcely call him
  a friend. Not that Rex wouldn't repudiate that."</p>

  <p>"Rex?"</p>

  <p>"Rex Lander," said Tab, "who, by the way, is very anxious to be introduced
  to you. He is one of your most fervent admirers." Tab felt that he was being
  very noble indeed, and he experienced quite a virtuous glow at his own
  unselfishness.</p>

  <p>"Who is he?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"He is old Trasmere's nephew."</p>

  <p>"Why, of course," she said quickly, and went red. "You have spoken about
  him before."</p>

  <p>Tab tried to remember. He was almost certain that he had never mentioned
  Rex to the girl.</p>

  <p>"So he is very rich? Of course he would be. He was Mr. Trasmere's only
  nephew."</p>

  <p>"You saw that in the newspaper?"</p>

  <p>"No; I guessed, or somebody told me; I haven't read any account of the
  murder, or any of the proceedings. I was too ill. He must be very rich," she
  went on. "Is he anything like his uncle?"</p>

  <p>Tab smiled.</p>

  <p>"I can't imagine two people more dissimilar," he said. "Rex is--well, he's
  rather stoutish," he said loyally, "and a lazy old horse. Mr. Trasmere, on
  the contrary, was very thin and, for his age, remarkably energetic. When did
  I mention Rex?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I can't recall the time and place. Please don't make me think, Mr.
  Holland. Where is Rex now?"</p>

  <p>"He has gone to Italy. He sailed yesterday," said Tab, and thereupon the
  girl's interest in Rex Lander seemed to suffer eclipse.</p>

  <p>"I should like to have had Trasmere's real story," said Tab; "he must have
  lived an interesting life. It is rather curious that we found nothing in the
  house reminiscent of his Chinese experience but a small lacquer box, which
  was empty. The Chinese fascinate me."</p>

  <p>"Do they?" she looked at him quickly; "they fascinate me in a way by their
  kindness."</p>

  <p>"You know them; have you lived in China?" She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I know one or two," she said, and paused, as though she were considering
  whether it was advisable to say any more. "When I first came to town from
  service-" He gaped at her.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite get that-by 'service'; what do you mean? You don't mean
  domestic service...you weren't a cook or anything?" he asked jocularly, and
  to his amazement she nodded.</p>

  <p>"I was a sort of tweeny maid; peeled potatoes and washed dishes," she said
  calmly. "I was only thirteen at the time. But that is another story, as Mr.
  Kipling says. At this age, and before I went to a school, I met a Chinaman
  whose son was very ill. He lodged in the house where I was staying. The
  landlady wasn't a very humane sort of person, and being Chinese, she thought
  the poor little boy had some mysterious Eastern disease which she would
  'catch.' I nursed him, in a way," she said apologetically, but Tab knew that
  the apology was not for her condescension, but for her lack of nursing skill.
  "The father was very poor then, a waiter in a native restaurant, but he was
  ever so grateful. Quite an extraordinary man--I have seen him since."</p>

  <p>"And the child?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, he got better-his father was dosing him with quaint proprietary
  medicines. I think he was suffering from enteric fever, and nursing is the
  only thing that cures that. He's in China now--quite an important
  person."</p>

  <p>"I should like to have that other story," said Tab. "Kipling gets my goat.
  That 'other story' of his is never told. I think he must have had them in his
  mind when he referred to them, but he got lazy on it."</p>

  <p>"My other story must keep," she smiled. "Some day...perhaps...but not now.
  The father of the boy laid out my little Chinese garden, by the way."</p>

  <p>Tab had come by train, and there was a long walk to the station. He stayed
  to the very last moment, and then had to hurry to catch the one fast express
  of the afternoon. He had gone a leisurely hundred yards from the front gate
  (you cannot walk fast if you turn round at intervals for a glimpse of a cool
  white figure) when he saw a dusty roadfarer coming toward him. The awkward
  gait of the walker, his baggy clothes, the huge Derby hat pulled down to his
  ears, attracted Tab's attention long before he could distinguish the man's
  features. When he did, it was with a spasm of surprise. The walker was a
  Chinaman, and carried in his hand a flat packet. The Oriental deviated from
  the straight path to cross the road. Without a word he carefully unwrapped a
  thin paper cover and exposed a letter. It was addressed to "Miss Ursula
  Ardfern, Stone Cottage," and on the wrapper Tab saw a number of Chinese
  characters which he guessed were directions to the messenger.</p>

  <p>"Tell," said the man laconically. He evidently knew little English.</p>

  <p>"That house on the left," said Tab; pointing. "How far have you come,
  Chink?"</p>

  <p>"Velly well," said the man, and taking the letter, folded it again in its
  covering and trotted off. Tab looked after him, wondering. How curious a
  coincidence, he thought, that they should have been talking about the Chinese
  only half an hour before?</p>

  <p>He had to run, and then only caught the train as it was pulling out of the
  station.</p>

  <p>The inexorable and constitutionally discontented news-editor was not at
  all satisfied with the story as Tab wrote it.</p>

  <p>"It loses half its value if we can't give her name," he complained; "and
  after we've started the interest going, The Herald, or some other paper, will
  find out who is the owner of the jewels and get all the fat of the story!
  Can't you persuade her?"</p>

  <p>Tab shook his head.</p>

  <p>"What's the great idea--is she going into a convent or something?"</p>

  <p>"She didn't mention it," said Tab impatiently. "There it is--take it or
  leave it, Jacques. It is a good item, and if you don't like it, I'll take it
  to the chief."</p>

  <p>A threat which invariably ended all discussion, for Tab was an important
  personage on the staff of The Megaphone, and his word carried weight.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

  <p class="first">MR. STOTT combined the implacable qualities of the feudal
  lord with an amiable leaning toward the society and approval of his fellow
  men. There was a cafe near his office which was extensively patronised by
  grave business men--directors, bank managers, and superior cashiers. The
  price of luncheon had been scientifically fixed by the proprietor, so that
  whilst it was within the means of men of substance and standing, it was just
  beyond the reach of those whose limited incomes did not permit the luxury of
  lunching at Toby's, though it was well worth the money to sit at meat with
  men who had offices labelled "Private," and drove to their businesses in
  polished limousines.</p>

  <p>Mr. Stott referred to the wistful folk who passed the door of Toby's to be
  swallowed up in less exclusive establishments, as the hoi polloi, which he
  understood was an Italian expression. Toby's had almost acquired the status
  of a club.</p>

  <p>Occasionally, ignorant strangers wandered in to test the gastronomical
  excellence of the kitchen, and these were usually accommodated in obscure
  corners away from the hearing of intimate gossip.</p>

  <p>Mr. Stott had recently become a person to be listened to with respect, and
  the necessity for keeping the regular patrons of Toby's aloof from the vulgar
  herd was doubly urgent by reason of the very important matters that had to be
  discussed.</p>

  <p>"What I can't understand, Stott," said one of his hearers, "is why the
  devil you didn't send for the police?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Stott smiled mysteriously.</p>

  <p>"The police should have been there," he said; "and by the way, I need not
  remind you fellows that what I say to you is in absolute confidence. I am
  scared out of my life lest that babbling servant of mine starts talking. You
  can never trust these gossiping girls. I confess, though, that I had half a
  mind, not to send for the police, but to tackle the Chinks myself. I should
  have done it, too, but the girl was so frightened of being left alone."</p>

  <p>"Have they come since?" asked another interested hearer.</p>

  <p>"No; nor the woman--you remember that I told you of the woman who used to
  drive up to Mayfield every night in her car?"</p>

  <p>"It seems to me that the police ought to know," interrupted the first
  speaker. "One of your servants is bound to talk. As you say, you can't trust
  'em! And then the authorities will want to know why you haven't reported the
  matter."</p>

  <p>"It is not my business," said Mr. Stott pharisaically. "It is for the
  police to get busy. I'm not at all surprised that the coroner's jury made the
  remark they did. Here is a man murdered--"</p>

  <p>He exhibited the crime graphically.</p>

  <p>"At any rate, I'm keeping out of it--these Chinese criminals are dangerous
  fellows to monkey with."</p>

  <p>He had paid his bill and was walking out of the cafe when somebody touched
  him on the arm, and he swung round to see a tall, melancholy, and long-faced
  man.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me; Mr. Stott, I believe?"</p>

  <p>"That is my name. I haven't the pleasure-"</p>

  <p>"My name is Carver. I am an Inspector of Police, and I want you to tell me
  something about what was seen outside Mayfield, both before and after the
  murder."</p>

  <p>Mr. Stott's face fell.</p>

  <p>"That servant of mine has been talking," he said, annoyed; "I knew she
  couldn't keep her mouth shut."</p>

  <p>"I know nothing about your servant, sir," said Carver sadly, "but I have
  been sitting in Toby's for the past three days and I have heard quite a lot.
  It sounded to me almost as if you were the principal speaker on the subject,
  but maybe I was mistaken."</p>

  <p>"I shall say nothing," said Mr. Stott firmly, and the detective
  sighed.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't hurry to make up my mind on that subject if I were you," he
  said; "it is certain to be a difficult business explaining to the Public
  Prosecutor why you have kept silence so long...it looks very suspicious, you
  know, Mr. Stott."</p>

  <p>Mr. Stott was aghast.</p>

  <p>"Suspicious...me...Good heavens! Come to my office, Mr.
  Carver...suspicious! I knew I should be dragged into it! I'll fire Eline
  to-night!"</p>

  <p>When Tab in the course of duty called that night at the station, he heard
  the story from Carver.</p>

  <p>"If the poor nut had only had the pluck to telephone to the police when
  the girl first told him the story, we could have caught those birds. As it
  is, there's no sense in keeping the house under observation any longer. Who
  was the woman? That puzzles me. Who was the woman who night after night
  garaged her car in Trasmere's garden and let herself into the house, carrying
  a square black bag?"</p>

  <p>Tab did not answer. The identity of the woman was no mystery to him. She
  was Ursula Ardfern.</p>

  <p>The fabric of supposition fitted piece to piece. He remembered he had come
  upon her in the deserted streets at dawn, surveying a burst tyre, and the
  plainness of her dress. Inside the car was a square black case, but Ursula
  working hand in glove with Chinamen; Ursula privy to these stealthy comings
  and goings, these midnight burglaries at Mayfield? That was unthinkable.</p>

  <p>"...their reason for breaking in after we had left the place is beyond
  me," Carver was saying. "I can only suppose that they hoped that we had
  overlooked something of value."</p>

  <p>"In Mayfield...there is nothing there now?"</p>

  <p>"Only the furniture and one or two articles we took away but have since
  returned, such as the green lacquer box. As a matter of fact, they only went
  back yesterday. Mr. Lander thought of selling all the furniture and effects
  by auction, and I believe that before he left he put the matter in the hands
  of an agent. The Chinamen intrigue me," he said, "though it is by no means
  certain that both Stott and his servant aren't mistaken. I gather they were
  considerably panic-stricken, and even I wouldn't undertake to distinguish a
  Chinaman from a European by the light of a match."</p>

  <p>Tab went into Carver's private office, and they sat talking until close on
  eleven o'clock, at which hour their conversation was violently interrupted by
  the ring of the telephone.</p>

  <p>"Call through for you, sir," said the voice of the sergeant on the desk,
  and a second later Carver recognized the agitated voice of Mr. Stott.</p>

  <p>"They're here now! They've just gone in! The woman has opened the
  door...they've just gone in!"</p>

  <p>"Who? Is that Stott--do you mean into Mayfield?" asked Carver quickly.</p>

  <p>"Yes! I saw them with my own eyes. The woman's car is outside the
  door."</p>

  <p>"Go and get its number quick," said Carver sharply; "find a policeman and
  tell him; and if you can't find one detain the woman yourself."</p>

  <p>He heard Mr. Stott's feeble expostulation, and jumped for his hat.</p>

  <p>They boarded the first taxi-cab they could find, and raced through the
  town at a break-neck pace, turning into one end of the quiet avenue in which
  Mayfield was situated, just as the tail lights of a car turned the corner at
  the other end.</p>

  <p>Mr. Stott was standing on the side-walk, pointing dumbly, but with
  hysterical gestures, at the place where the car had been.</p>

  <p>"They've gone," he said hollowly, "...couldn't find a policeman: they've
  gone!"</p>

  <p>"So I notice," said Carver. "Did you take the number of the car?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Stott shook his head and made a choking noise in his throat. Presently
  he commanded his speech.</p>

  <p>"Covered over with black paper," he said.</p>

  <p>"Who was it?"</p>

  <p>"A Chinaman and a woman," said the other.</p>

  <p>"Why in hell didn't you stop them?" snapped Carver.</p>

  <p>"A Chinaman and a woman," repeated Stott miserably.</p>

  <p>"What was she like?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't get near enough to see," Mr. Stott made the confession without
  shame. "There ought to have been police here...lots of police...It is
  disgraceful. I am going to write to the--"</p>

  <p>They left him quivering threats. Carver ran across the concrete garden,
  unlocked the door and switched on all the lights in the hall. Nothing, so far
  as he could see, had been disturbed. The door to the vault was locked, and
  had not been tampered with. Apparently the dining-room had. The fireplace was
  a broad deep cavity lined with red brick, and pointed with yellow cement. An
  electric radiator had replaced the stove, and Carver had made a very thorough
  examination, both of the recess and the wide chimney above. But he saw at a
  glance that his inspection had been short of perfect. One of the bricks had
  been taken out. It lay on the table, with its steel lid open, and Carver
  surveyed it thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"That is one on me," he said. "It looks like the face of a brick, doesn't
  it? Look at that artistic cement pointing all round the edge? It isn't cement
  at all, but steel. In fact, this must be about the only secret drawer in the
  house. I ought to have made more thorough inquiries from the builders."</p>

  <p>The box was empty, except for a tiny rubber band. They found its fellow on
  the table.</p>

  <p>"There was something of importance in that box which has been taken out;
  probably a bundle of papers; more likely two bundles. The rubber bands
  suggest two. Anyway, they've gone."</p>

  <p>He glanced round the room.</p>

  <p>"And the green lacquer box has gone," he said. "I know it was here,
  because I put it on the mantelshelf with my own hands."</p>

  <p>He opened the door leading to the vault and satisfied himself that nobody
  had gained admission to the underground room.</p>

  <p>"We had better go along and see this police critic," he said grimly.</p>

  <p>It appeared that he had done Mr. Stott an injustice, for, greatly fearing,
  he had crossed the road whilst the people were in the house, and he had made
  honest attempts to find a policeman, having sent the toothachy Eline on that
  errand, which was successful, if the success was somewhat belated, for the
  policeman arrived with her whilst the Inspector was talking to the
  merchant.</p>

  <p>"I not only crossed the road," said Mr. Stott, "but I went inside the
  garden. They must have seen me, for the light in the dining-room went out
  suddenly, and they came flying down the steps together."</p>

  <p>"And passed you, of course?"</p>

  <p>"They did not pass me," explained Mr. Stott emphatically, "because I was
  on the other side of the road before they were out of the gate. I do not
  think anything would have passed me."</p>

  <p>"What was the woman like?" asked Carver again.</p>

  <p>"I have an idea she was young, but I did not see her face. She was dressed
  in black, and, as far as I could see, veiled. The other man was small: he
  only came up to her shoulder."</p>

  <p>"That is that," said Carver disconsolately, when they came away. "They
  ought to have been caught, if that man had the spunk of a rabbit. You are
  very silent, Tab--what are you thinking?"</p>

  <p>"I am wondering," said Tab truthfully, "just wondering."</p>

  <p>"What are you wondering?" growled the other.</p>

  <p>"I am wondering whether old Trasmere was a much worse man than any of us
  imagine," said Tab calmly.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

  <p class="first">EARLY in the morning Tab paid a fruitless visit to Stone
  Cottage. The woman who acted as caretaker told him that the young lady had
  returned to town, and it was at the Central Hotel that he saw her.</p>

  <p>Never had he approached an inquiry, professional or otherwise, with such
  reluctance. On most matters Tab had very definite views. His mentality was
  such that he never hesitated to form a judgment, or wavered in his
  convictions. That type of mind cannot understand in others the vacillating
  hesitancy which so often distinguishes them in their judgment of people and
  things. And yet, strive as he did, he could not reduce to a formula his own
  chaotic feelings in relation to Ursula Ardfern.</p>

  <p>One thing he knew. It was no vicarious interest he was showing--he did not
  even in his own mind regard himself as standing for Rex Lander.</p>

  <p>Tab thought best with a pen in his hand, yet when in cold blood he
  endeavoured to reduce to writing the exact state of his mind in relation to
  Ursula Ardfern, the white sheet of paper remained white to the end.</p>

  <p>The moment he entered her sitting-room Tab felt that Ursula knew the
  object of his visit.</p>

  <p>"You want to see me very badly, don't you?" she said, without preliminary,
  and he nodded.</p>

  <p>"What is it?"</p>

  <p>Unless he was dreaming, her voice held a subtle caress and yet that was a
  ridiculous exaggeration; perhaps "kindness" was a better word.</p>

  <p>"Somebody went into Mayfield last night, accompanied by a Chinaman, and
  they got away just before the police arrived," said Tab awkwardly. "And that
  isn't all: that same somebody has been in the habit of visiting Trasmere
  between eleven at night and two in the morning, and this practice has been
  going on for a considerable time."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I told you I did not know Mr. Trasmere," she said quietly. "It is the
  only lie I have told you. I knew Mr. Trasmere very well, but there were
  reasons why it would have been fatal for me to have admitted my friendship
  with him. No, not one lie--two." She held up her fingers to emphasize her
  words.</p>

  <p>"The other was about the lost jewel-case," said Tab huskily.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she replied.</p>

  <p>"You didn't lose it at all."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't lose it at all: I knew where it was all the time; but I
  was--panic-stricken, and had to make a decision on the spur of the moment. I
  did not regret it."</p>

  <p>There was a pause.</p>

  <p>"Do the police know?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"About you? No. I think they might find out--not from me."</p>

  <p>"Sit down." She was very calm. He thought she was going to explain, and
  was quite satisfied that the explanation was a very simple one, but she had
  no such intention, as her first words told him.</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you now the why of everything. I am too...what is the word?
  Too tense. I am not so sure that this is the word, either, but my defences
  are in being. I dare not relax one of them, or the whole would go. Of course
  I knew nothing of the murder--you never dreamt I did?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I did not know until Sunday morning, when I was driving out to Stone
  Cottage," she said. "It was only by accident that I bought a paper in the
  street, and then I made my decision. I went straight to the police station
  with my story of the lost jewel-case. I knew it was in the vault, and I had
  to find some explanation."</p>

  <p>"How did it come to be in the vault?" Tab knew that the question was
  futile before it was half out.</p>

  <p>"That is part of the other story," she smiled faintly. "Do you believe
  me?"</p>

  <p>He looked up at her quickly, and their eyes met.</p>

  <p>"Does it matter whether I believe or not?" he asked quietly.</p>

  <p>"It matters a great deal to me," she said, in the same tone.</p>

  <p>It was his gaze that fell first.</p>

  <p>Then, in a different and more cheery voice, she went on: "You have to help
  me, Mr. Tab. Not in the matter we have been discussing--I don't mean
  that."</p>

  <p>"I'll help you in that," said Tab.</p>

  <p>"I think you will," she answered quickly, "but for the moment, ungracious
  as it may sound, I do not need help. The other matter is more personal. Do
  you remember telling me about your friend?"</p>

  <p>"Rex?" he asked in surprise.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"He went to Naples, didn't he? I had a letter from him, written on
  board."</p>

  <p>Tab smiled.</p>

  <p>"Poor old Rex. What did he want, your photograph?"</p>

  <p>"More than that," she said quietly. "You won't think I am horrible if I
  betray his confidence, but I must if you are to help me. Mr. Lander has done
  me the honour of asking me to marry him."</p>

  <p>Tab looked at her open-mouthed.</p>

  <p>"Rex?" he said incredulously.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I won't show you the letter, it would hardly be fair; but he has asked me
  to give my answer in the agony column of The Megaphone. He says that he has
  an agent in London who will send it by wireless, and I was wondering--" She
  hesitated.</p>

  <p>"If I were the agent?" said Tab. "No, I know nothing whatever about
  this."</p>

  <p>She drew a sigh.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad," she said inconsequently. "I mean, I'm glad that you won't be
  hurt even indirectly."</p>

  <p>"Do you intend putting in the advertisement?"</p>

  <p>"I have already sent it to the paper," she said. "Here is a copy." She
  went to her writing-table and brought back a slip of paper, and Tab read:</p>

  <p>"Rex: What you ask is quite impossible. I shall never make any other
  reply. U."</p>

  <p>"One does get those kind of letters," she said, "and as a rule they are
  not worth while answering. Had I not known...he was a friend of yours, I
  don't think I should have taken the trouble--yes I would," she nodded slowly.
  "Mr. Trasmere's nephew has certain claims to refusal."</p>

  <p>"Poor old Rex," said Tab softly. "I had a wireless from him this morning,
  saying that he was enjoying the voyage."</p>

  <p>He took up his hat.</p>

  <p>"As regards the other matter, Miss Ardfern," he said, "you must tell me in
  your own time, if you wish to tell me at all. But you must understand that
  there is a very big chance that the police will trace you, in which case I
  may be of assistance. As matters stand, I am just a sympathetic
  observer."</p>

  <p>He held out his hand with a smile, and she took it and held it in both of
  hers.</p>

  <p>"For twelve years I have been living in a nightmare," she said: "a
  nightmare which my own vanity created. I think I am awake now, and when the
  police trace me--and I am so certain they will trace me that I have left the
  stage--"</p>

  <p>"Was that the reason?" he exclaimed in surprise.</p>

  <p>"That is one of the two reasons," she said. "When they trace me, I think I
  shall be glad. There is still something of the old Eve in me"--she smiled a
  little sadly--"to make exposure a painful possibility."</p>

  <p>One last question he asked as he stood at the door.</p>

  <p>"What was in the box? The box that looked like a brick and was hidden in
  the fireplace?"</p>

  <p>"Papers," she replied. "I only know they were papers written in Chinese. I
  do not know what they were about yet."</p>

  <p>"Had they...could they possibly supply a clue to the murder?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head, and he was satisfied.</p>

  <p>He smiled at her, and with no other word went out. All doubts that he had
  had as to his feelings toward her were now set at rest. He loved this slim
  girl with the madonna-like face, whose moods changed as swiftly as April
  light. He did not think of Rex, or the heartache which her message would
  bring, until later.</p>

  <p>There was no very satisfactory portrait of Wellington Brown in existence.
  On the ship which brought him from China a fellow passenger had taken a
  snapshot of a group in which Mr. Brown's face, slightly out of focus, loomed
  foggily.</p>

  <p>With this to work on, and with the assistance of Tab, something like a
  near-portrait was constructed and circulated by the police. Every newspaper
  carried the portrait, every amateur detective in the country was looking for
  the man with the beard, whose gloves had been found outside the death chamber
  of Jesse Trasmere.</p>

  <p>Less fortunate was the lot of Mr. Walter Felling, alias Walters. He had
  been in prison, and his portraits, full face and profile, were available for
  immediate distribution. He watched the hunt from one of those densely crowded
  burrows where humanity swelters and festers on the hot days and nights. In
  the top room of a crowded tenement, he grew more and more gaunt as the days
  went by, for the fear of death was in his heart.</p>

  <p>Despite the efficient portraiture, it is doubtful whether he would have
  been recognized by the most lynx-eyed policeman, for his beard had reached a
  considerable length and suspense and terror had wasted his plump cheeks into
  hollows and cavities that had changed the very contours of his face. He knew
  the law; its fatal readiness to accept the most fragmentary evidence when a
  man was on trial for murder. His every movement had been an acknowledgment of
  guilt; would be accepted as such by a judge; who would lay out the damning
  points against him with a cold and remorseless thoroughness.</p>

  <p>Sometimes at nights, especially on rainy nights, he would creep out into
  the streets. Always they seemed to be full of police. He would return in a
  panic to spend another restless night, when every creak of the stairs, every
  muffled voice in the rooms below, made him jump to the door.</p>

  <p>Walters had doubled back to town, the only safe place of refuge. In the
  country he would have been a marked man and his liberty of short duration.
  Avoiding the districts which knew him well, and the friends whose loyalty
  would not stand the test of a murder charge, he came to the noisy end of Reed
  Street, posing as an out-of-work engineer.</p>

  <p>Here he read every newspaper which he could procure, and in each journal
  every line that dealt with the murder. What had Wellington Brown to do with
  it? The appearance of that man in the case bewildered him. He remembered the
  visitor from China very well. So he, too, was a fugitive. The knowledge
  brought him a shade of comfort. It was as though a little of the burden of
  suspicion had been lifted from himself.</p>

  <p>One night when he was taking the air, a Chinaman went pad-padding past
  him, and he recognized Yeh Ling. The proprietor of the Golden Roof was one of
  the few Chinamen in town who seldom wore European dress, and Walters knew
  him. Yeh Ling had come to Mayfield on several occasions. He had worn European
  dress then, and had excited no surprise, for Mr. Trasmere's association with
  the Far East was well known. Yeh Ling must have seen him, for he had passed
  at a moment when the light of a street lamp fell upon Walters' face. But he
  made no sign of recognition, and the fugitive hoped that Yeh Ling had been
  absorbed in his thoughts.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless he hurried home again, to sit in his darkened room and start
  painfully at every sound.</p>

  <p>Had he known that Yeh Ling had both seen and identified him, he would not
  have slept at all that night. The Chinaman pursued his course to the
  unsavoury end of Reed Street; children who saw him screamed derisively; a
  frowsy woman standing in a doorway yelled a crude witticism, but Yeh Ling
  passed on unmoved. Turning sharply into a narrow alleyway he stopped before a
  darkened shop and tapped upon a side door. It was opened at once, and he
  passed into a thick and pungent darkness. A voice hissed a question, and he
  answered in the same dialect. Then, without guide, he made his way up the
  shaky stairs to a back room.</p>

  <p>It was illuminated by the light of four candles. The walls were covered by
  a cheap paper, its crude design mellowed by age, and the only furniture in
  the room was a broad divan, on which sat a compatriot, a wizened old Chinaman
  who was engaged in carving a half-shaped block of ivory which he held between
  his knees.</p>

  <p>They greeted one another soberly, and the old man uttered a mechanical
  politeness.</p>

  <p>"Yo Len Fo," said Yeh Ling, "is the man well?"</p>

  <p>Yo Len Fo shook his head affirmatively.</p>

  <p>"He is well, excellency," he said. "He has been sleeping all the afternoon
  and he has just taken three pipes. He had also drunk the whisky you
  sent."</p>

  <p>"I will see him," said Yeh Ling, and dropped some money on the divan.</p>

  <p>The old man picked this up, uncurled himself, and putting down his ivory
  carefully, led the way up another flight of stairs. A small oil-lamp burnt on
  the bare mantelpiece of the room into which Yeh Ling walked. On a discoloured
  mattress lay a man. He wore only shirt and trousers and his feet were bare.
  By the side of the mattress was a tray on which rested a pipe, a half-emptied
  glass, and a watch.</p>

  <p>Mr. Wellington Brown looked up at the visitor, his glazed eyes showing the
  faintest light of interest.</p>

  <p>"Lo Yeh Ling...come to smoke?"</p>

  <p>His language was a queer mixture of Cantonese and English, and it was in
  the former tongue that Yeh Ling replied.</p>

  <p>"I do not smoke, Hsien," he said, and the man chuckled.</p>

  <p>"Hsien?--'The Unemployed One,' eh?...Funny, how names stick...wasser
  time?"</p>

  <p>"It is late," said Yeh Ling, and the bead of the man drooped.</p>

  <p>"See ol' Jesse to-morrow..." he said drowsily; "got...lot of
  business..."</p>

  <p>Yeh Ling stooped, and his slim fingers encircled the man's wrist. The
  pulse was weak but regular.</p>

  <p>"It is good," he said, turning to the old carver of ivory.</p>

  <p>"Every morning there must be air in this room. No other smoker must come;
  you understand, Yo Len Fo? He must be kept here."</p>

  <p>"This morning he wanted to go out," said the keeper of the
  establishment.</p>

  <p>"He will stay for a long time. I know him. When he was on the Amur River
  he did not leave his house for three months. Let there be one pipe always
  ready. Obey."</p>

  <p>He went softly down the stairs and into the night.</p>

  <p>Only once did he glance back as he made his unhurried way to the side door
  of the Golden Roof. But that glance was sufficient. The man he had seen
  loafing at the entrance of the alleyway was watching him. He saw him now,
  walking on the other side of the road, a dim, secretive figure. Yeh Ling
  slipped into his private door, bent down and raised the flap of a letter
  slot. The man had come to a halt on the other side of the road. The reflected
  light from the blazing signs on the main street illuminated his back, but his
  face was in shadow.</p>

  <p>"It is not a policeman," said Yeh Ling softly, and then, as the man
  strolled back into the darkness, he called his stunted servant.</p>

  <p>"Follow that man who wears a cap. You will see him on the other side of
  the road; he is walking toward the houses of the noisy women."</p>

  <p>A quarter of an hour later the stunted man came back with a story of
  failure, and Yeh Ling was not surprised. But the watcher was neither
  policeman nor reporter, of this he was sure.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

  <p class="first">IN the course of his professional duties Tab Holland had
  been brought into contact with the master of the Golden Roof on two
  occasions. The first followed a small scandal, which only remotely touched
  the restaurant (the woman who was the subject of Tab's investigation had
  dined there at an important date), and once in connection with a dead-season
  topic dealing with the nutritive values of food.</p>

  <p>He had found the Chinaman reserved to a point of taciturnity, monosyllabic
  in speech; a most unsatisfactory person.</p>

  <p>Tab knew nothing about him except that he was a successful Chinaman who
  had gravitated into the restaurant business.</p>

  <p>He asked Jacques for enlightenment, well knowing that if the news-editor
  could not satisfy his curiosity it was because Yeh Ling was altogether
  uninteresting. Jacques was one of the rarities, to whom reference is so
  frequently made that it might be imagined they were as common as straws in a
  stable. He was a veritable "mine of information." The genus occurs sometimes
  in newspaper offices. Jacques knew everybody and everybody's wife. He knew
  why they married. He also knew why stars twinkled and the chemical
  composition of tears.</p>

  <p>Quote him a line from any classic and he would give you its predecessor
  and that which followed. He knew the dates of all important earthquakes and
  was an authority on the Mogul Emperors. He could sketch you with equal
  facility the position of Frossard's second corps at Rezonville on August 17,
  1870, or the military situation at Thermopolae...and dates.</p>

  <p>The only serious students of The Megaphone reference library were the
  reporters who went there to confound Jacques. They never succeeded.</p>

  <p>"Yeh Ling? Yes...queer bird. An educated Chink...got a son who is quite a
  swell scholar by Chinese standards. He ought to make a good story some day;
  that house he is building at Storford--it is on the way to Hertford; says
  that one day his son will be the Chinese Ambassador here, and he wants him to
  have a house worthy of his position. That is what he told Stott. Know Stott?
  He is a dud architect who knows it all. Weird little devil who looks as if he
  might have been clever with a different kind of brain. Stott laid out the
  ground work: sort of Chinese temple with two enormous concrete pillars that
  are going to stand half way down the drive. The Pillar of Cheerful Memories
  and the Pillar of Grateful Hearts. That's what he is going to call them.
  Stott thought it was heathenish, and wondered if the bishop would like it.
  Yes, you ought to see that place, Tab. No, it isn't built. Yeh Ling has
  nothing but Chink labour. The Secretary of the Builders Union went to see him
  about it. Yeh Ling said his ancestors had a Union of their own which put the
  bar upon non-Taoist labour. Taoism--"</p>

  <p>"I hate to wade into the foaming torrent of your eloquence," said Tab
  gently, "but how did you come to meet Stott?"</p>

  <p>"Same lodge," said Jacques. "It is not for me to talk down a brother
  craftsman--are you one of us, by the way?"</p>

  <p>Tab shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Ought to be. Get a little respect for authority into your system. As I
  was saying, I don't want to knock Stott, but he's not everybody's meat. Go
  and see that temple, or whatever it is, Tab. Might be a good story."</p>

  <p>On the first idle day he had Tab took his motor-bicycle and went out to
  Storford. He was not entirely without hope that he would see Ursula--her
  house was only seven miles beyond Storford Hill, and he had reason to know
  that she had with-drawn herself to her country home. In a letter telling this
  she had told him in so many words that when she wanted him she would send for
  him.</p>

  <p>He saw the building from a distance.</p>

  <p>He had noticed it before--it was hardly possible to miss seeing it, for it
  stood on the crest of one of the few hills the country boasted. The walls
  were half finished and heavy wooden uprights rose like the palings of a fence
  above the queerly laid courses. And one of the pillars already lifted its
  lofty head. It flanked on one side a broad pathway, which was half the width
  of the house, and stood some fifty feet above the ground, being crowned by a
  small stone dragon.</p>

  <p>Tab wondered if this was the Pillar of Grateful Hearts or that which
  stood, or would stand, for Cheerful Memories.</p>

  <p>Its diameter must have been fully five feet. Near at hand was one of the
  wooden moulds in which it was cast, and a Chinese workman was scraping the
  interior.</p>

  <p>Tab walked through a break in the low hedge which separated Yeh Ling's new
  home from the road, and now stood regarding with interest the activities of
  the blue-bloused workmen. Their industry was remarkable. Whether they were
  running bricks and mortar, or cutting out the garden (already taking shape),
  or walling up the terraces, they moved quickly, untiringly, wholly absorbed
  in their occupations. Never once did they stop to lean upon their spades and
  picks to discuss the chances of the new Administration, or to tell one
  another how Milligan got his black eye.</p>

  <p>Nobody seemed to notice Tab. He strolled farther into the land, and there
  was none to challenge his right. A gang of men were gravelling and rolling
  the broad path, and one of these said something which sent the others into a
  fit of that cluttering laughter which is peculiar to the East. Tab wondered
  what was the joke.</p>

  <p>Turning to walk back to the road, he saw that a car had stopped at the
  break in the hedge, and his heart gave a leap, for its occupant was
  Ursula.</p>

  <p>"What do you think of it?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"It is going to be rather wonderful--how do you like the idea of having a
  Chinaman for a neighbour? I forgot--you rather like the Chinese."</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said shortly. "There could be worse neighbours than Yeh
  Ling."</p>

  <p>"You know him?"</p>

  <p>He wondered if she would deny acquaintance or evade the question.</p>

  <p>"Very well," she said calmly; "he is the proprietor of the Golden Roof. I
  often dine there. You know him too?"</p>

  <p>"Slightly," said Tab, looking back at the unfinished house, "He must be
  rich."</p>

  <p>"I don't know. One never really knows what money is required to build a
  place like this. The labour is cheap, and it seems a very simple kind of
  house."</p>

  <p>And then, with a wave of her hand, she drove on. She might at least have
  asked him to lunch, he thought indignantly.</p>

  <p>A week went past, a drab week for a discontented Tab Holland, for now
  there was neither a likelihood of nor an excuse for a chance meeting.</p>

  <p>A sedative week for the hiding Walters. References to the murder seldom
  appeared now in the newspapers, and he had found a man who had offered to get
  him a job as a steward on an outward-bound liner.</p>

  <p>A week of drugged sleep for a besotted man, curled up on a mattress at the
  top of Yo Len Fo's house.</p>

  <p>But for Inspector Carver an exceptionally busy week, though there was no
  newspaper record of his activities.</p>

  <p>Tab no longer spent his evenings at home. The flat seemed horribly empty
  now that the love-sick Rex had gone. He had had a radio from him, saying that
  he was improved in health.</p>

  <p>The message was cheerful enough, so that Ursula's refusal could not have
  bitten very hard.</p>

  <p>By the end of the week life had become an intolerable dreariness, and to
  make matters worse nothing was happening in the great world that called for
  Tab's intervention and interest. He was in that condition of utter boredom
  when there happened the first of those remarkable incidents which, in his
  official account of the case, Inspector Carver refers to as "The Second
  Activity."</p>

  <p>The flats, one of which Tab occupied, had originally been apartments in a
  private house. With little structural alteration they had been turned into
  self-contained suites. On each of the landings was a door of one of the four
  flats. Admission to the house was by the front door, and the landlord had so
  arranged matters that, whilst the key of each flat was different, all keys
  opened the street door. It was therefore possible to go in and out without
  observation, unless by chance one of the other tenants happened to be on the
  stairs or in the passage-way at the time.</p>

  <p>On Saturday night Tab knew he would be alone in the house; the other three
  tenants invariably spent the week-end out of town. One was a middle-aged
  musician who lived on the top floor. Beneath him was a young couple engaged
  in literary work; then came Tab's flat; and the ground-floor suite was
  occupied by a man whose profession was unknown, but who was generally
  believed to be connected with an advertising agency. He was seldom at home,
  and Tab had only seen him once.</p>

  <p>The Saturday night happened to be the occasion of an annual dinner of his
  club, and Tab dressed and went out early, spent a mildly exhilarating
  evening, and returned home at half-past twelve. There was nothing in first
  appearance to suggest that anything unusual had happened in his absence,
  except that the lights in his sitting-room were burning and he had switched
  them off before he went out.</p>

  <p>His first impression was that the waste of current was due to his own
  carelessness, but then he recalled very clearly that he had turned out the
  light and closed the sitting-room door before he went out. Now the
  sitting-room door was open, as also was the door of Rex's old room.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch16"
     id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

  <p class="first">TAB smiled to himself. He who had investigated so many
  burglaries had never imagined that he would be favoured by the attention of
  those midnight adventurers. He went into Rex's room, turned the switch, and
  had only to take one glance to know that somebody had been very busy indeed
  in his absence. Under the bed which his companion had occupied were two
  shallow trunks filled with those of Rex Lander's belongings which he had not
  taken with him. One of these had been pulled out, placed on the bed, and
  opened. It had been opened unscientifically with a chisel, which Tab knew was
  his property, and must have been taken from the tool-box in the kitchen. The
  lock was wrenched off and the contents of the box scattered on the bed. The
  other trunk had not been touched. Whether the thief had been successful in
  his quest Tab did not know, because he was ignorant of the box's contents. He
  guessed he must have been disappointed, for beyond a quantity of underlinen,
  more or less in a state of disrepair, a few books and drawing; instruments,
  and a packet of letters which Tab saw at a glance were from Jesse Trasmere,
  there was nothing at all valuable in the trunk.</p>

  <p>He went to his own room, but none of his things had been touched. And then
  he began a careful search of the other rooms in the flat. They yielded,
  however, no clue as to the identity of the mysterious visitor, and Tab got on
  to the 'phone to Carver and was lucky to find him.</p>

  <p>"Burglars? That's poetic justice, Tab," said Carver's sad voice. "I'll
  come right along."</p>

  <p>The detective was at the house in ten minutes.</p>

  <p>"If this had happened in the daytime I could find a fairly simple
  explanation," said Tab, "because the front door below is left open until
  nine, and the tenant who comes in or goes out nearest to nine o'clock closes
  it. We keep the door open, because it saves a lot of running up and down
  stairs, but the street door was closed when I came home."</p>

  <p>"How would it have been a simple matter to burgle the flat?" asked Carver,
  and Tab explained that there was a window on the landing through which a
  sure-footed and skilful adventurer might emerge on to a narrow ledge by which
  the kitchen window could be reached.</p>

  <p>"He didn't go that way, I should think," said Carver, after he had
  inspected the kitchenette. "No; the burglar opened the door like a gentleman.
  Do you know whether Mr. Lander had anything worth stealing in that
  trunk?"</p>

  <p>Tab shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I am perfectly certain he hadn't," he said. "Poor old Rex had nothing of
  value except the money he drew from his uncle's estate just before he
  left."</p>

  <p>Carver went back to Rex's room and carefully emptied the trunk, item by
  item.</p>

  <p>"It was something at the bottom of the trunk. I should imagine it was in
  this box." He handled a little wooden box with a sliding lid. "And here is
  the top," he said, picking it up from the bed. "Can you get in touch with Mr.
  Lander?"</p>

  <p>"He'll be at Naples in a day or two; I'll wire him then--but I shouldn't
  imagine he had lost anything worth the thief's trouble," said Tab.</p>

  <p>They went back to the sitting-room, and Carver stood a long time by the
  table, tapping its covered surface nervously, his long face puckered in
  thought.</p>

  <p>"Do you know what I think?" he said suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Generally," said Tab.</p>

  <p>"Do you know what I am thinking now?"</p>

  <p>"You think I am giving you a lot of trouble over a happening which wasn't
  worth mentioning," said Tab.</p>

  <p>Carver shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I am thinking this," he said slowly and deliberately: "that the man who
  burgled this flat was the man who killed Jesse Trasmere! If you ask me to
  give chapter and verse for my conclusion I shall both disappoint you and
  disappoint myself. I have always found," he went on, "that when one has an
  instinctive conviction it is a mistake to make too close an examination of
  one's mind. Every human being was endowed, some time or other, with as
  powerful and potent an instinct as the most sensitive of wild animals. With
  the growth of reason, the instinctive quality faded, until to-day, in
  humanity, we find only the faintest trace of it. Yet," he said earnestly, "it
  is possible for humanity to cultivate that germ of instinct so that one can
  go to a race-track and pick every winner."</p>

  <p>"You are joking," said Tab surprised, but Carver shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You get flashes of it at times; you call them 'hunches.' But you won't
  give it a chance. You slay it with the hands of logic and smother it with
  argument, and my instinct tells me that the hand that opened Mr. Lander's
  trunk was the hand that destroyed Trasmere. I had a queer feeling when you
  telephoned to me," he went on--"a queer feeling, as though you or somebody
  was going to hand to me a ready-made solution of Trasmere's death."</p>

  <p>"And you are disappointed. My poor old Carver," said Tab pityingly. "You
  think too much!"</p>

  <p>"We all think too much," said Carver, relapsing into his natural
  gloom.</p>

  <p>The next morning the tenant who occupied the flat below came up whilst Tab
  was dressing, and Mr. Holland was a little taken aback to see one who so
  seldom put in an appearance on any day. He was a red-faced gentleman,
  somewhat sportily attired.</p>

  <p>"I hope you didn't mind my shouting up at you last night," he said
  apologetically, "but I had been travelling night and day and I had had no
  sleep, and naturally I was a little rattled when I heard that noise going on
  overhead. Did you drop a box or something?"</p>

  <p>"To be exact, I didn't drop a box at all," said Tab smiling. "In fact, the
  noise you heard was made by a burglar."</p>

  <p>"A burglar?" said the startled man. "I heard the row, and it woke me up. I
  got out of bed and yelled up, as I thought, to you."</p>

  <p>"What time was this?"</p>

  <p>"Between ten and half-past," said the other. "It was just getting
  dark."</p>

  <p>"He must have dropped the box as he was putting it on the bed," said Tab
  thoughtfully. "You didn't by any chance see him?"</p>

  <p>"I heard him go out about a quarter of an hour after I'd made a fuss."
  said the man from downstairs, "and I was feeling so ashamed of myself for
  losing my temper that I opened the door to apologize for shouting at
  him."</p>

  <p>"You didn't see him?"</p>

  <p>The man shook his head. "He shut the door quickly, just as I got into the
  passage. The only thing I saw was his hand on the edge of the door. He was
  wearing black gloves. Naturally I thought it was you, though the black gloves
  seemed to be a queer sort of thing for a young man to wear, even if he was in
  mourning; and taking it for granted that it was you, and that you were mad
  with me, I thought no more about it."</p>

  <p>All this Tab duly reported to Carver.</p>

  <p>That ended the episode of Saturday. Sunday's surprise was more pleasant
  but not less disturbing. It was late in the evening, and Tab was reading by
  the light of a table-lamp when the bell which connected with the front door
  rang urgently.</p>

  <p>This meant that the front door was closed. On the night of Wellington
  Brown's visit it was open. He unconsciously connected the two visitations,
  and wondered whether his instinct was working as well as Carver could wish.
  Putting the book aside he went down and opened the door, and nearly staggered
  in his astonishment, for his visitor was Ursula Ardfern, and her little car
  stood by the edge of the side-walk.</p>

  <p>"I am on my way to the Central," she explained. "Can I come in?"</p>

  <p>He had seen the two suitcases strapped to the back of the car, and had
  wondered for what distant and inaccessible spot she was bound.</p>

  <p>"Come in, please," he said hastily. "I am afraid this room is rather
  smoky." He made to pull up the blind, but she stopped him.</p>

  <p>"Please don't," she said, "I am all nerves and shivers, and I feel I could
  swoon on the slightest excuse. It is rather a pity that that delightful
  practice of our grandmothers' days went out of fashion. It would be such a
  relief to swoon sometimes."</p>

  <p>Her tone was half-jesting, but there was a whole lot of seriousness in her
  face. "I am coming to live at the Central again," she said, "though I really
  cannot afford that extravagance."</p>

  <p>"What has happened?"</p>

  <p>"Stone Cottage is haunted," was the staggering reply.</p>

  <p>"Haunted?"</p>

  <p>She nodded, and a momentary smile came into her eyes, only to fade as
  quickly as it came.</p>

  <p>"Not by a ghost," she said, "but by a very human man--a mysterious
  individual in black. The woman who looks after me saw him the other night in
  the garden; I myself have seen him from my window and challenged him. He has
  been seen by other people pacing the road outside. Now tell me honestly, Tab
  Holland, am I under the observation of the police?"</p>

  <p>The thought had also occurred to Tab.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," he said. "Carver does not tell me everything, but he
  has never mentioned your name to me as being under the slightest suspicion.
  In black, you say?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," nodded the girl. "From head to foot in black, including black
  gloves. It was rather spectacular--"</p>

  <p>"Black gloves?" interrupted Tab. "I wonder if it is my burglar?" and he
  told her of the visitor who had come the night before.</p>

  <p>"It is extraordinary," she said; "more extraordinary because he was not
  seen last night. I am not usually nervous, but I must confess that it is a
  little worrying to know that somebody is watching me."</p>

  <p>"How did he come? Had he a car or bicycle, or did he come by train?"</p>

  <p>On this point she could not enlighten him.</p>

  <p>"I almost wish you had not come up," said Tab. "If you had told me, I
  would have gone to Stone Cottage and stayed the night, especially after my
  burglar. I should like to meet the gentleman who treats my flat so
  unceremoniously."</p>

  <p>She made no reply, and then: "Why did I come here, I wonder?" she asked,
  and it was as though she were speaking to herself, for she laughed. "Poor Mr.
  Tab," she said, with that little hint of mockery in her voice which he
  adored, "I am laying all my burdens upon you. Mystery upon mystery, some of
  my own, but this, I promise you, not of my making." She considered, her
  finger at her lips. "Suppose I return to Stone Cottage on Monday morning and
  you come down later? My woman will be an efficient chaperon, and I think you
  should come after dark--that is, if you can spare the time."</p>

  <p>Tab wanted to tell her that all eternity, so far as he was concerned, was
  at her disposal, but very wisely refrained.</p>

  <p>He saw her to her car and went back to his room with a sense of
  exhilaration that he had not felt all that week.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch17"
     id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was a delicate matter broaching the subject of police
  espionage to Carver. In the first place he did not want to give the Inspector
  the slightest hint that Ursula Ardfern expected to be watched. He compromised
  by telling that gloomy man, at the first opportunity, that he had seen Miss
  Ardfern. And then he mentioned casually, and by the way, the story of her
  watcher.</p>

  <p>"Of course it isn't a thief," said Carver promptly. "Thieves do not
  advertise their presence by alarming the people they hope to rob. Has she
  complained to the local police?"</p>

  <p>Tab did not know, but he guessed that she had not.</p>

  <p>"It may be a coincidence," said Carver, "and the man in black may really
  have nothing whatever to do with the murder of Trasmere, but I am intrigued.
  You are going down, you say? I wonder if Miss Ardfern would mind my coming
  too?"</p>

  <p>Tab was in a dilemma here. To hesitate would be to give the police officer
  a wholly wrong impression. To accept was to eclipse the happy evening he had
  in prospect. For to be alone with Ursula Ardfern, to stand to her in the
  nature of a protector, would be a wonderful experience which he had no desire
  to share.</p>

  <p>"I am sure Miss Ardfern would be delighted," he said.</p>

  <p>"If I can get away I will come," said Carver.</p>

  <p>Tab fervently hoped that urgent business would keep his friend in
  town.</p>

  <p>He sent a note round to Ursula putting forward Carver's suggestion, and
  received a reply by return extending her invitation.</p>

  <p>After mature thought, Tab decided that it was not at all a bad idea to
  have Carver with him. It would give the girl an opportunity of making friends
  with one who might, in certain circumstances, be a difficult man to satisfy.
  She could not have too many friends, he thought, and was almost relieved when
  Carver hurried into the station a few minutes before the last train to
  Hertford left.</p>

  <p>It was dark when they arrived, and by pre-arrangement they did not speak
  in the long walk which separated them from Stone Cottage, but in single file,
  keeping to the shadows of the road, they marched forward without meeting with
  a soul.</p>

  <p>When at last they came to the highway in which Stone Cottage was situated,
  they proceeded with greater caution. But there was nobody in sight and they
  reached the garden unobserved.</p>

  <p>Ursula was standing in the open doorway to welcome them.</p>

  <p>"I've had all the blinds pulled down," she said, "and Inspector Carver's
  coming is rather providential, for my woman has had to go home--her mother
  has been taken ill. I hope you don't mind appearing in the role of a
  chaperon," she smiled at Carver.</p>

  <p>"Even that is not an unusual one," he replied, unsmiling. "Where does she
  live, the mother of your servant?"</p>

  <p>"At Felborough. Poor Margaret only had time to catch the last train."</p>

  <p>"How did Margaret know her mother was ill?" asked the Inspector. "Did she
  have a telegram?"</p>

  <p>Ursula nodded.</p>

  <p>"Late this afternoon?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the girl, in surprise. "Why do you ask?"</p>

  <p>"She got the telegram in time to catch the train to town; in time, too, to
  catch a train for Felborough. That was why I asked. You did not see the man
  last week?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't come down until this morning," she answered, troubled. "Do you
  think that Margaret has been sent for by--somebody--that it was a ruse to get
  her away?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Carver. "In my profession we always apply the worst
  construction, and we are generally right. What time do you usually go to
  bed?"</p>

  <p>"At ten o'clock in the country," she said.</p>

  <p>"Then at ten o'clock, will you go up to your room, put on your lights, and
  after a reasonable time, put them out again? You may, if you wish, come down,
  but you must be prepared to sit in the dark; and if you want to talk, you
  must carry on your conversation in whispers." A rare smile softened his face.
  "We shall probably all be feeling a little foolish in the morning, but I
  would rather feel foolish than miss the opportunity of meeting the man in
  black."</p>

  <p>She gave them supper, and after the men had helped clear away the remains
  of the meal Tab, at her request, filled his pipe. Carver said he did not wish
  to smoke.</p>

  <p>Conversation, for some reason, seemed to flag. They sat silently about the
  table, each busy with his own thoughts.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Ursula said: "I am almost inclined to make a restricted
  confession to you, Mr. Carver. I don't think I should ever have dreamt of
  doing so if I had never met you."</p>

  <p>"Restricted confessions are irritating things," said Carver, "so I don't
  think I should confess if I were you, Miss Ardfern especially as I know what
  the restricted confession is all about."</p>

  <p>Her eyebrows rose. "You know?" she said.</p>

  <p>He nodded. "You would tell me," he said, "that you were in the habit of
  going to Trasmere's house every night, to leave your jewels with him, though
  that wasn't the object of your visit. You went there," he said, slowly and
  not looking at her, "to act as his secretary. All the letters that were sent
  away by Jesse Trasmere were typewritten by you on a portable machine: the
  make of the machine is a Cortona, its number is 29754, it has one key-cap
  missing, and the letter 'r' is a little out of alignment."</p>

  <p>He enjoyed her consternation for a second, and then went on: "Perhaps you
  weren't going to tell me that you and Yeh Ling, the proprietor of the Golden
  Roof, paid a visit to Mayfield the night I nearly caught you? No, I see that
  you weren't. So we'll restrict the confession to your peculiar
  occupation."</p>

  <p>Tab was speechless.</p>

  <p>Ursula Ardfern the old man's secretary! One of the most successful
  actresses in London acting as amanuensis to that crabbed misanthrope; it was
  unbelievable. Yet a glance at the girl's face told him that Carver had only
  spoken the truth.</p>

  <p>"How do you know?" she gasped.</p>

  <p>Carver smiled again.</p>

  <p>"We have very clever people in the police," he said dryly. "You would
  never imagine it, to read the newspapers. Clever old sixty-nine-inch brains,
  eh, Tab?"</p>

  <p>"I never said that you had a sixty-nine-inch brain," avowed Tab
  stoutly.</p>

  <p>"But--" interrupted the girl, and her voice was agitated, "do you know--do
  you know anything else? Why we went that night?"</p>

  <p>"You went to show Yeh Ling where the old man kept some of his secret
  documents, in the fake brick in the fireplace. You went hoping that in that
  box there were some papers which related to you, and you were disappointed.
  The only thing I am in doubt about is this--was Yeh Ling disappointed
  too?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I wondered," mused Carver. "Of course I guessed that it was in the little
  lacquer box, and guessed also that the little lacquer box had a false bottom.
  Am I right?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head again.</p>

  <p>"No--Yeh Ling thought it was there; the document he sought was in the
  brick-box."</p>

  <p>"You have the key of Mayfield," said Carver. "I think you had better give
  it to me. Otherwise you may be getting into serious trouble."</p>

  <p>She went out of the room without a word, came back, and handed him the
  small Yale key, which he glanced at and dropped into his pocket.</p>

  <p>"If I were a writing man, which, thank heavens, I am not," he said, "I
  should call this story of the Trasmere murder, 'The Mystery of the Three
  Keys.' Here is one solved, and it wasn't much of a mystery. There are two
  others. The third is the most difficult of all."</p>

  <p>"You mean the key that was found on the table in the vault?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, and said no more.</p>

  <p>In her discretion, Ursula asked no further questions.</p>

  <p>Tab was looking at Carver with a new respect.</p>

  <p>"Every day, Carver," he said seriously, "you are getting nearer the
  fictional ideal of a real detective!"</p>

  <p>Carver's down-turned lips took an upward curve, and then he looked at his
  watch.</p>

  <p>"Ten o'clock, Miss Ardfern," he said with mock severity, and Ursula made a
  move to the door. "We must turn these lights out before you leave the room.
  Everything must be done in order, remembering that somewhere the Black Man is
  watching."</p>

  <p>She shivered.</p>

  <p>It was Tab who blew out the light in the drawing-room.</p>

  <p>"I think we may draw the curtains," said Carver softly, and pulled back
  the heavy velvet hangings from the window.</p>

  <p>It was a starlight night and there was just sufficient light in the sky to
  outline the gateway.</p>

  <p>"This will do admirably," he said, settling himself in the window-seat.
  "If you must smoke, Tab, don't bring your pipe within sight of that
  gate."</p>

  <p>Tab groaned and laid his pipe upon the fender.</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later Ursula came into the room.</p>

  <p>"May I stay?" she whispered. "I have put out my bedroom light most
  artistically."</p>

  <p>They conversed in whispers for an hour, and Tab was beginning to feel
  sleepy when a hiss from Carver stopped him in the middle of a sentence.
  Looking out of the window he saw a dark figure by the gate. It was impossible
  to distinguish more than the outlines. It appeared to be a man of
  considerable height, but this might have been, and probably was, an illusion.
  It wore a broad-brimmed hat, presumably dark; more than this they could not
  see. They waited in silence as the gate opened and the figure stole
  noiselessly into the garden.</p>

  <p>It was half way to the door when another figure appeared.</p>

  <p>It came from nowhere, seeming to rise up from the ground, and then before
  the man in the wide-awake hat could draw back, the second man had flung
  himself upon him. The watchers sat paralysed until Carver, jumping to his
  feet, ran out of the room, Tab close behind him.</p>

  <p>When they flung open the door, both figures had disappeared. Carver sprang
  toward the gate, and stumbled. His foot had struck a soft bulk which
  stretched across the garden path; he turned back, flashing an electric lamp
  upon the object. It was a man, and for a moment they did not see his
  face.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" Carver pulled the man over on his back. "Well, I'm--"</p>

  <p>The man at his feet was Yeh Ling!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch18"
     id="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

  <p class="first">THE Chinaman was unconscious, and Carver looked around for
  the second visitant. He rushed to the gate, the road was deserted. Flinging
  himself upon the roadway to secure an artificial skyline, he peered first in
  one direction and then in the other. Presently he saw his man running swiftly
  in the cover of the hedges, and started in pursuit.</p>

  <p>A hundred yards away from the house was a secondary road, and into this
  the runner turned. As Carver reached the corner he heard a motor-car engine
  and dimly saw the bulk of a large touring car retreating rapidly.</p>

  <p>He came back to the house, to find Yeh Ling sitting in Ursula's room
  holding his head in his hands.</p>

  <p>"This is the second man; it isn't the wide-awake gentleman," said Carver.
  "Now, Yeh Ling, give an account of your actions. How are you feeling?"</p>

  <p>"Pretty dizzy," said Yeh Ling, and to Tab's surprise his tone was that of
  a cultured man, his English faultless. He looked up at the girl
  reproachfully.</p>

  <p>"You did not tell me these gentlemen were coming down, Ardfern, when you
  wrote to me," he said.</p>

  <p>"I hadn't any idea when I wrote that they were coming, Ling," she
  answered.</p>

  <p>"I had been here a little earlier I should have seen him," he said. "As it
  was, I am afraid I have spoilt your evening, Mr. Carver." His expressionless
  brown eyes looked up at the detective.</p>

  <p>"I see! You were on guard too, were you?" said Carver good-humouredly.
  "Yes, we seem to have made a mess of it between us. Did you see the man?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't see him," said Yeh Ling, "but," he added, "I felt him," and he
  rubbed his head. "I think it must have been his fist. I did not notice any
  weapon."</p>

  <p>"You didn't see his face?" persisted Carver.</p>

  <p>"No, he had a beard of some kind. I felt it as my hands clutched at him. I
  am afraid I over-estimated my strength," he said apologetically to the girl,
  "yet there was a time when I was a star performer at Harvard, in the days
  when Chinese students were something of a curiosity."</p>

  <p>"Harvard?" said Tab, in surprise. "Great Moses! I thought you were a--" he
  couldn't very well finish his sentence.</p>

  <p>But the other helped him.</p>

  <p>"You thought I was a very ordinary Chink?" he said. "Possibly I am. I hope
  I am," he said. "Certainly, Miss Ardfern knew me when I was a very poor
  Chink! We lodged in the same house, she will remember, and she placed me
  under an eternal obligation by saving the life of my son."</p>

  <p>Then Tab remembered the little Chinese boy Ursula had nursed when she
  herself was little more than a child. Remembering this, a great many things
  which had been obscure to him became clear and understandable.</p>

  <p>"I had no idea you would come to-night, Yeh Ling, but you begged me if I
  was in any kind of difficulty to let you know," she said. "You shouldn't have
  taken the trouble."</p>

  <p>"Events seem to prove that," said the Chinaman dryly. "I am merely being
  consistent, Miss Ardfern. You have been under my personal observation for
  seven years. Seven years, day and night, either I or one of my servants have
  been watching you. You never went--" He stopped, and changed the
  conversation.</p>

  <p>"Miss Ardfern never went to Mr. Trasmere's house but you weren't watching
  outside; that is what you were going to say, wasn't it, Yeh Ling?" smiled
  Carver. "You need not be reticent, because I know all about it, and Miss
  Ardfern knows that I know."</p>

  <p>"That was what I was going to say," said the other. "I usually followed
  Miss Ardfern from the theatre to her hotel; from her hotel to Trasmere's
  house, and home again when she had finished working."</p>

  <p>The reporter and detective exchanged glances. This, then, was the
  explanation of the mysterious Chinaman who had been seen by Mr. Stott's
  servant waiting outside Mayfield smoking a cigar in the cold hours of the
  morning. It explained, also, the appearance of the cyclist in the roadway
  that morning when the tyres of Ursula Ardfern's car had burst and Tab had
  been on hand to render timely assistance.</p>

  <p>"I had no idea," breathed the astonished girl; "is that true, Yeh Ling?
  Oh, how kind you have been!"</p>

  <p>Tab saw tears in her eyes, and wished that he, and not this uninteresting
  Chinaman, had been the person who excited her gratitude.</p>

  <p>"Kindness is a relative term," said Yeh Ling. He had brought his feet up
  on a chair and was rolling a cigarette; he had asked permission with his
  eyes, and as Ursula nodded he lit it with a quick flick of his fingers, a
  match having appeared, as it seemed, out of space, and carefully replaced the
  stalk in a match-box. "Was it kindness that you saved the life of one who is
  to me the light of my eyes and the inspiration of my soul, if you will
  forgive what may seem to you, a writer, Mr. Holland, a piece of flowery
  orientalism, but which is to me the quintessence of sincerity."</p>

  <p>Then, without preamble, he told his story: a story which was only half
  known to the girl.</p>

  <p>"I was in this peculiar position," he said, "that I was a rich man or a
  poor man, whichever way the great law of this country interprets an agreement
  I made with Shi Soh. Shi Soh you know as 'Trasmere,' and that, of course, is
  his name.</p>

  <p>"On the Amur River we called him Shi Soh. I came to this country many
  years ago and worked in the restaurant of which I am now proprietor. I do not
  mean the Golden Roof, but the little place in Reed Street. The man who owned
  it lost all his money at Fan-tan, and I bought it a bargain. You may wonder
  why a man of education, and the son of a great Clan, should be here in this
  country, playing the humble part of waiter in a Chinese restaurant. I might
  tell you," he said, simply and without conscious humour, "that education in
  China, when it is applied to political objectives, is not always popular, and
  I left China hurriedly. That, however, is all past. The Manchu has gone, the
  old Empress, the Daughter of Heaven, is dead, and Li Hung is asleep on the
  Terraces of the Night.</p>

  <p>"I was making slow progress when Mr. Trasmere came one night. I did not
  recognize him at first. When I knew him first he was a very strong, healthy
  man, with a reputation for being cruel to his employees. I have known him to
  burn men to death in order to make them reveal where they had hidden gold
  which they had stolen from the diggings. We talked of old times, and then he
  asked me if there was money to be made in the restaurant business. I told him
  there was, and that was the beginning of the partnership which lasted until
  the day of his death. Three-quarters of the profits of the Golden Roof was
  paid every Monday to Mr. Trasmere, and that was our agreement. It was the
  only agreement that we had, except one which I myself wrote at his dictation
  and which placed on record this fact: that in the event of his dying, the
  whole of the property should come to me. It was signed by me with my 'hong,'
  and by him with his 'hong' which he always carried in his pocket."</p>

  <p>"The 'hong'," interrupted Carver, "is a small ivory stamp with a Chinese
  character at the end. It is carried in a thin ivory case, rather like a
  pencil-case, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>Yeh Ling nodded.</p>

  <p>"I kept the document until a few days before his death, when he asked me
  to let him take it away with him to make a copy. It will be news to you,
  though not perhaps to you, Miss Ardfern, that Mr. Trasmere spoke and wrote
  Chinese with greater ease than I, who am almost an authority upon Mandarin. A
  few days later he was murdered. My only hope of saving myself from ruin was
  to find that agreement, which he had taken away in my little lacquer
  box."</p>

  <p>"But could they touch your restaurant? Are there any other documents in
  existence which would give Mr. Trasmere's heir the right of interfering with
  you?"</p>

  <p>Yeh Ling looked at him steadily. "It does not need a document," he said
  quietly. "We Chinese are peculiar people. If Mr. Lander came to me on his
  return from Italy and said, 'Yeh Ling, this property is my uncle's, in which
  you only have a very small share,' I would reply: 'That is true'; and if the
  agreement which we two men had not signed was not discovered, I should make
  no effort at law to preserve my rights."</p>

  <p>And he meant it. Tab knew as he spoke that he was telling the truth. He
  could only marvel that such an exalted code of honour could be held by a man
  who subconsciously he regarded as of an inferior race and of an inferior
  civilization.</p>

  <p>"You found the agreement?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said Yeh Ling. "It had been taken out of the box in which I
  gave it to Mr. Trasmere and placed--elsewhere. But I found it--and other
  documents of no immediate interest. As to my coming here to-night--apart from
  your letter, lady, I was anxious to meet the Black Man also. Yes. He has been
  watching me for many days. I am certain it is the same." He made a little
  grimace and rubbed his bruised head. "I met him," he said.</p>

  <p>Carver jotted down a few notes in his book and then putting the book away,
  he turned and faced the Chinaman squarely.</p>

  <p>"Yeh Ling," he said, "who murdered Jesse Trasmere?"</p>

  <p>The Chinaman shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I do not know," he said simply. "To me it is amazing. There must be a
  secret passage that opens into the vault. I can think of no other way in
  which the murderer could have got in or out."</p>

  <p>"If there is a secret way," said the detective grimly, "then it is the
  best kept secret I have known. It has certainly been kept a secret from the
  men who built the house and the vault and the clerk of the works who was on
  the spot all the time it was being erected. No, Yeh Ling, you must get that
  idea out of your head. Either the man Brown or Walters is guilty. We shall
  know the method they employed when we get them."</p>

  <p>"Brown was not guilty," said Yeh Ling quietly, "for I was with him when
  the murder was committed!"</p>

  <p>They heard this pronouncement with astonishment; even the girl seemed
  surprised.</p>

  <p>"Do you know what you are saying?"</p>

  <p>"I know what I am saying, and I rather wish, I hadn't said it," said the
  Chinaman with a quick smile. "Nevertheless, it is true. If the murder was
  committed on Saturday afternoon, then I certainly was with the man called
  Wellington Brown, but whom we called The Drinker, or The Unemployed One, at
  that hour. It embarrasses me to say how or where, but it would embarrass me
  more if you were to ask me whether I know his whereabouts at the present
  moment. To that question I should answer: 'No.'"</p>

  <p>"And you would lie," said Carver quietly.</p>

  <p>"I should lie," was the calm answer. "Yet I tell you, Mr. Carver, that
  Wellington Brown was with me, under my eye, from half-past one o'clock in the
  afternoon of the Saturday on which Jesse Trasmere was killed until
  night."</p>

  <p>Carver eyed him keenly.</p>

  <p>"When he came to you," he asked, "how was he dressed?"</p>

  <p>The other shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Poorly. He has always been dressed poorly."</p>

  <p>"Did he wear gloves?"</p>

  <p>"No. He had no gloves. That was the first thing I noticed, because he
  was--what do you call it in English?--fastidious to a degree. In the hottest
  days I have seen him wearing gloves. A shabby dandy! That is the expression I
  was seeking. I am sorry to disappoint you."</p>

  <p>"You haven't disappointed me," said Carver bitterly; "you have merely
  added another brick wall between me and my objective."</p>

  <p>Yeh Ling left soon after. He had bicycled down from town, and cheerfully
  undertook the long return journey in preference to spending the remainder of
  the night at the cottage.</p>

  <p>It was too late for Ursula to go to her hotel, and they sat up all night,
  Carver playing an interminable game of solitaire, whilst Tab and the girl
  walked about the garden in the growing light and talked oddly of incongruous
  things.</p>

  <p>As soon as it was light Carver went out to find the place where the car
  had stood and to examine wheel-tracks. He gained little from his inspection,
  except that the tyres were new and that the car was a powerful one, which was
  hardly a discovery.</p>

  <p>"The man who drove was not a skilled driver, or else he was very nervous.
  Half way up the lane he nearly swerved into a ditch and came into collision
  with a telegraph pole, which must have damaged his mudguard severely. I found
  flakes of brand-new enamel attaching to the damaged wood, so I guessed that
  the car also had not been long from the makers' hands."</p>

  <p>Thus passed the second appearance of the Man in Black. The third was to
  come in yet a more dramatic fashion.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch19"
     id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

  <p class="first">MR. WELLINGTON BROWN woke one morning, feeling
  extraordinarily refreshed. Usually he woke with a clouded brain and a parched
  mouth, with no other desire than to satisfy that craving for opium which all
  his life had kept him poor and eventually had ruined him physically and
  morally. But on this occasion he opened his eyes, made a quick stock of his
  surroundings, and uttered a "faugh!" of disgust. He knew himself so well, and
  was so well acquainted with his idiosyncrasies and the character of these
  fits which came upon him, that he saw that the end of a bout had come. Some
  day he would not wake up feeling refreshed, or wake up at all.</p>

  <p>He sat up in bed, fingering his beard, and sucked in the breeze that came
  through the open window. Rising to his feet he found his knees a little
  unstable, and laughed foolishly. It was Yo Len Fo himself who came in,
  bearing a tray with a glass of water, a bottle half full of whisky, and the
  inevitable pipe.</p>

  <p>Without a word Wellington poured himself out a stiff dose of the spirit
  and gulped it down.</p>

  <p>"You may take that pipe to the devil," he said. His voice was quavery but
  determined.</p>

  <p>"'A pipe in the morning makes the sun shine,'" quoted Yo Len Fo.</p>

  <p>"'A pipe in the morning does not go out with the stars,'" replied
  Wellington Brown, giving proverb for proverb.</p>

  <p>"If the Illustrious will stay I will have breakfast sent to him," said the
  Chinaman urgently.</p>

  <p>"I have stayed too long," said Wellington Brown. "What is the day of the
  month by the foreign reckoning?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know the foreign ways," said Yo Len Fo; "but if your Excellency
  will deign to stay for a few hours in this hovel--"</p>

  <p>"My Excellency will not deign to stay in any hovel or palace," said
  Wellington. "Where is Yeh Ling?"</p>

  <p>"I will send for him at once," said the old man eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Leave him," replied Mr. Brown, with a fine gesture, and began to search
  his pockets. To his surprise, all his money, which was not much, was intact.
  "How much do I owe you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Yo Len Fo nodded, thereby meaning "nothing."</p>

  <p>"Running a philanthropic hop joint?" asked the other sarcastically.</p>

  <p>"It has all been paid by the excellent Yeh Ling," answered the man.</p>

  <p>Brown grunted. "I suppose that old devil Trasmere is behind this," he said
  in English; and seeing that the man did not comprehend him he pushed his way
  past Yo Len Fo and went down the uncarpeted stairs into the street. He felt
  terribly weak, but his heart was light. Hesitating at the end of a narrow
  passage, he turned to the left, otherwise he could not have failed to have
  run into the arms of Inspector Carver, who had made a call that morning upon
  the proprietor of The Golden Roof.</p>

  <p>Mr. Brown's day was spent simply. He found his way to the park and,
  sitting down on a bench, dozed and mused the hours away, basking in the
  glorious June sunlight and seemingly oblivious to its heat.</p>

  <p>Late in the afternoon he felt hungry and went to a refreshment kiosk in
  the park. Finishing his meal he found the nearest bench and continued his
  pleasant occupation of doing nothing. Mr. Wellington Brown was a born loafer;
  it is a knack which would prolong many lives in this strenuous age, if it
  could be acquired.</p>

  <p>The stars were coming out in a velvet-blue sky when, with a shiver, he
  aroused himself and made instinctively for the lights. As he slouched along
  one of the big main paths that cross the park, he overtook a man who was
  walking slowly in his direction. The man shot a quick glance at him, and then
  turned suddenly away.</p>

  <p>"Here," said Mr. Brown truculently, "I know you. Why in hell are you
  running away from me? Think I'm a leper or something?"</p>

  <p>The man stopped, glanced uneasily left and right. "I don't know you," he
  said coldly.</p>

  <p>"That's a damned lie," snarled Brown. The reaction of his bout was upon
  him. He would have quarrelled with anything or anybody. "I know you and I've
  met you." He groped in his hazy mind for some string that would lead him to
  the identity of the stranger. "In China, wasn't it? My name's
  Brown--Wellington Brown."</p>

  <p>"Yes, perhaps it was in China," said the other, and of a sudden became
  friendly, gripped Wellington Brown's arm, and leaving the path, led him
  across the green spaces of the park.</p>

  <p>A courting couple sitting under one of the trees saw them pass, and heard
  Wellington Brown say: "Don't say that I was his storekeeper, because I
  wasn't, or his servant! I was his equal, by gad. A partner in the firm, the
  blamed old swindler..."</p>

  <p>So they passed, the Man in Black and the besotted pensioner from
  China.</p>

  <p>At this hour another person deeply interested in Jesse Trasmere's fate was
  making his final preparations for departure.</p>

  <p>He had ventured forth in broad daylight, braved the glances of the purser
  of the Arak, and had signed on as steward of the second saloon on a voyage to
  South Africa. The end of the long nightmare had come. Walters had to join his
  ship overnight, an excellent arrangement from his point of view, since it
  reduced the danger of detection to a minimum.</p>

  <p>He carried with him to the big roomy docks a respectable sum of money, the
  proceeds of his pilfering at Mayfield, and his opportunities had been many,
  remembering Mr. Trasmere's parsimony.</p>

  <p>He had sent his bag off to the ship in the afternoon and he had only to
  convey himself to the docks. He went on foot, keeping to the less-frequented
  streets, and although this entailed a longer journey he was taking no risks.
  A month ago he would have trembled at every shadow, and the sight of a
  policeman would have paralysed his activities, but now the case had been
  forgotten; one never read a line about it in even the more sensational
  newspapers, and it was with some confidence that he traversed the wharf and
  mounted the gangway leading to the ill-lighted decks of the liner.</p>

  <p>"Report to the chief steward," said the custodian on duty at the ship end
  of the plank, and Walters inquired his way forward, went down the broad
  companion to the broader deck where the chief steward's office is situated,
  and joined a dozen other men who were lined up in queues waiting to
  report.</p>

  <p>Walters would not have worried if the waiting had occupied the rest of the
  evening, but in a remarkably short space of time he stepped into the chief
  steward's cabin, knuckled his forehead, and said:</p>

  <p>"Reporting for duty, sir. John Williams, steward--" and then he
  stopped.</p>

  <p>On the farther side of the steward's table was Inspector Carver.</p>

  <p>Walters turned in a flash, but the doorway was blocked by a detective.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said despondently as they snapped the steel handcuffs on
  his wrist, "but I didn't do it, Mr. Carver. I know nothing about the murder.
  I am as innocent as a babe unborn."</p>

  <p>"What I like about you," said Carver unpleasantly, "is your
  originality."</p>

  <p>He followed behind the two men who held the arms of their manacled
  prisoner, and Tab joined him. As they came off the ship Tab asked:</p>

  <p>"Well, do you honestly think you have him, Carver?"</p>

  <p>"Who--Walters? That's the man all right. I know him very well indeed."</p>

  <p>"I mean the murderer," said Tab.</p>

  <p>"Oh, the murderer. No, I don't think that this is the gentleman, but he
  will have some difficulty in proving he isn't. You can say that he's
  arrested, Tab, but I would rather you didn't say that I charged him with the
  murder, because I shan't until I have much more information in my possession
  than I have at present. Perhaps if you come round to the station after you
  have been to the office, I will be able to tell you a little more, especially
  if Walters makes a statement, as I think he will."</p>

  <p>In this the detective was right, for Mr. Walters lost no time in putting
  his defence on record.</p>

  <p>THE STATEMENT OF WALTER FELLING</p>

  <p>"My name is Walter John Felling. I have sometimes assumed the name of
  Walters, sometimes MacCarty. I have served three terms of imprisonment for
  theft and impersonation, and in July 1913 I was sent to prison for five years
  at Newcastle. I was released from prison in 1917 and served in the army as
  cook until 1919. On leaving the army I heard from a nose(*) that Mr. Trasmere
  was in want of a valet, and knowing that he was a very rich man and very
  mean, I applied for the job, producing false references, which were made out
  by a man named Coleby, who does that kind of job. When Mr. Trasmere asked me
  what salary I wanted, I purposely said a sum which I knew was below the rate
  usually paid, and he engaged me on the spot. I do not think he wrote for my
  references. If he had, Coleby would have replied."</p>

  <p>[(*)"Nose": informer. Either one who betrays or who supplies information
  to criminals!]</p>

  <p>"There were two other servants at Mayfield when I went there, a Mr. and
  Mrs. Green. Mr. Green was an Australian, but I think Mrs. Green was born in
  Canada. He acted as butler to Mr. Trasmere, but he did not have a very happy
  time. He did not like Mr. Trasmere, I think. Certainly Mr. Trasmere did not
  like him. My object in securing employment with Mr. Trasmere was to find an
  opportunity for getting away with a good haul. I knew from the first it was
  going to be very difficult, because of the peculiar habits of the house, but
  I managed to get a few things together--a gold watch and two silver
  candlesticks--and was thinking of making a get-away when Mr. Trasmere
  detected Green giving food away to Mrs. Green's brother-in-law, and fired
  them on the spot. Then he discovered the loss of the gold watch and had their
  boxes searched. I felt very sorry for Green, but of course I could say
  nothing.</p>

  <p>"After the Greens had left I had to do the work of valet and butler, too.
  I very soon discovered that all the valuables in the house were kept in a
  room in the cellar. I have never been into that room, but I know it is
  somewhere in the passage which leads from Mr. Trasmere's study, because I
  have seen the door opened and, by bending down, have been able to look along
  the corridor.</p>

  <p>"I hoped that some day or other I should be able to make a more careful
  inspection of the place, but that opportunity never came, although it seemed
  that I was going to have a chance a week or two before Mr. Trasmere's death.
  I managed to get the key from his neck whilst he was in a kind of fit and
  take an impression, but the fit did not last very long, and I had hardly got
  the key back before the old gentleman recovered. It was a lucky thing for me
  that I had wiped the soap from the key on my sleeve, for the first thing he
  felt for was the chain round his neck. However, I had quite enough to work
  on, and I started in to make a key that would fit the impression. That is as
  much as I can tell you about the vault, which I never saw.</p>

  <p>"I went to bed every night at ten o'clock, and Mr. Trasmere used to lock
  the door which shut me off from the rest of the house, so that it was
  impossible for me to see what was going on at night. I complained to him, and
  he had a key put in a glass box in my room so that in case of emergency I
  could smash the glass and, with the aid of the key, unlock the door that
  separated me from the rest of the house. He didn't even agree to this until
  he was taken ill one night and I was unable to go to his assistance.</p>

  <p>"To open the door which locked me in was one thing, to open the little
  glass cupboard and take out the key was, however, a simpler matter. I used
  that key several times. The first time I used it I heard voices in the
  dining-room downstairs, and wondered who it was calling at that late hour. I
  hadn't the courage to go down and see for fear I should be detected, for
  there was a light in the hall. But another night, hearing a woman's voice, I
  went down, the lights being out, and saw a young lady sitting at a table with
  a typewriter in front of her, tapping the keys whilst Mr. Trasmere walked up
  and down, with his hands behind him, dictating. She was the prettiest young
  lady I have seen in my life, and somehow I was sure that I had seen her
  before. I did not recognize her until I saw her photograph in an illustrated
  paper, and then it seemed to me to be impossible that it could be Miss Ursula
  Ardfern, the well-known actress. I came down again the next night, and this
  time they were talking together and Mr. Trasmere called her 'Ursula,' and I
  knew I was right. She used to come from the theatre every night, and
  sometimes he would keep her there as late as two o'clock.</p>

  <p>"One evening, soon after she came, I crept downstairs and, in my
  stockinged feet, listened to them. I heard him say very sharply: 'Ursula,
  where is the pin?' The young lady answered, 'It is there, somewhere'; and
  then I heard him grumbling and grunting, and presently he said, 'Yes, here it
  is.'</p>

  <p>"There was much more to be picked up in the house than I had imagined."
  (Here Walters enumerated minutely, and as far as can be ascertained exactly,
  the number and nature of the valuables which he succeeded in acquiring.)
  "When Mr. Trasmere was alone he used to sit at the table with a little
  porcelain dish in front of him and a brush. I don't know what he was
  painting, I never saw any of his pictures. I only know that he did this,
  because I managed to peep at him on several nights, and saw him at work. He
  did not use a canvas; he always painted on paper, and he always used black
  ink. The paper must have been very thin, because once the window was slightly
  open and a sheet blew away.</p>

  <p>"I managed to see him, because there was a glass fanlight over the door
  which I used to keep clean, and from the head of the stairs you could look
  into the room, and if he happened to be sitting in a certain place it was
  easy to see him.</p>

  <p>"On the morning I left the house I was engaged in working at the key I was
  making, and I could do this without any danger, because Mr. Trasmere never
  came into my room, the door of which I kept locked in case of accidents. I
  served lunch to my master, and he talked to me about Brown, the man I had
  turned away from the door. He told me that I had done quite right and that
  Brown was wanted by the police in this country, and he wondered why he had
  taken the risk of coming back. He told me that Brown was an opium taker and a
  drunkard, and that he was a worthless fellow. After lunch he cleared me out
  of the room and I knew that he was going down to his vault, which he usually
  did on Saturday afternoons.</p>

  <p>"At about ten minutes to three I was in my room working at the key, and
  had just brought a cup of coffee from the kitchen when the front door bell
  rang and I answered it. There was a messenger boy with a telegram, and it was
  addressed to me. I had never before received telegrams at the house and I was
  surprised. On opening it I read a message reminding me that I had been
  convicted at Newcastle eight years before, and telling me that the police
  were calling at three o'clock.</p>

  <p>"I was in a terrible state of mind, for I had in my room a considerable
  quantity of stolen property and I knew that my next conviction would mean a
  very long sentence. I rushed up to the room, gathered my stuff together, and
  was out of the house a little before three. As I opened the door I saw Mr.
  Rex Lander standing by the gate. I had seen Mr. Lander before, because he had
  stayed for a little time in the house a month after I had taken up my
  position. He had always been very nice to me, and he is a gentleman for whom
  I have a great deal of respect.</p>

  <p>"His uncle, the late Mr. Trasmere, did not like him. He told me once that
  Mr. Rex was extravagant and lazy. On seeing Mr. Rex at the gate my heart went
  down into my boots, and I thought that he must immediately detect that
  something was wrong. He asked me if his uncle was ill, and that gave me a
  moment to pull myself together, and I told him that I was going on a very
  urgent errand, and running into the street I had the good luck to find a
  taxi-cab which drove me to the Central Station. I did not, however, leave
  town, but made my way to a room which I had once occupied in a house which I
  knew in Reed Street, where I have been in hiding ever since.</p>

  <p>"I did not see Mr. Trasmere again after lunch. He did not come out to
  inquire who had called when the telegram arrived; there were frequent
  callers, tradesmen, and others, and I never reported to him unless there was
  something important or unless letters or telegrams came for him. I have never
  been in the vault or in the passage leading to the vault, nor have I at any
  time owned a revolver.</p>

  <p>"I made this statement voluntarily, without any pressure, and have
  answered the questions which Inspector Carver has put to me without any
  suggestion on his part as to the way they should be answered."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch20"
     id="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

  <p class="first">"THERE is the statement," said Carver. "Not a line must be
  used; only the fact that the statement has been made can be published. What
  do you think of it?"</p>

  <p>"It reads fairly honest to me," said Tab, and the Inspector nodded.</p>

  <p>"It does to me also. I never had the slightest doubt in my mind that
  Walters, or Felling, was innocent. The references to Miss Ardfern's visits
  are a little obscure, and in one sense rather remarkable, particularly the
  old man's reference to the pin."</p>

  <p>"You are thinking of the pin we found in the corridor?" said Tab
  quickly.</p>

  <p>Carver laughed softly. "I was and I wasn't," he said. "The pin of which
  the old man spoke was obviously one of the jewels which were in the box, and
  as obviously he was taking an inventory of the jewel-case to see that
  everything was there."</p>

  <p>Tab was silent for a while.</p>

  <p>"You mean that the jewels really belonged to Trasmere, that he lent them
  to the girl, and that she had to return them every night?" he asked
  quietly.</p>

  <p>"There is no other explanation," said Carver. "There is no other
  explanation, either, for her secretarial activities. Trasmere was in a score
  of enterprises, and I have no doubt that he was the man who put up the money
  for Ursula Ardfern's season. He was a shrewd old boy and probably had seen
  her acting. My own impression is that he made a fortune out of this
  girl--"</p>

  <p>"But why should she, a successful actress, consent to act as his midnight
  secretary? Why should she go on as though she were a slave to this man,
  instead of being, if your theory is correct, an earner of big money?"</p>

  <p>Carver looked at him steadily.</p>

  <p>"Because he knew something about Miss Ardfern--something that she did not
  wish should be known," he said gently. "I am not suggesting it is anything
  discreditable to her," he went on discreetly, detecting the cloud gathering
  on Tab's face. "Some day she'll tell us all about it, I daresay. At present,
  it is unimportant."</p>

  <p>He got up from his desk--they were talking in his office--and stretched
  himself.</p>

  <p>"This concludes the day's entertainment, gentlemen," he said, "and if you
  are dissatisfied, your money will be returned to you at the doors."</p>

  <p>There were moments when Carver could be facetious.</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not going home. I have a couple of hours' work here. I shan't be
  disturbed. Happily the station telephone is out of order. A tree fell across
  a line somewhere between here and the exchange. Remember, Tab, only the
  briefest notes of Walter's arrest: Nothing about the charge, not a single
  item of his statement, beyond the fact that he has made one."</p>

  <p>Happily Jacques had gone home, or the news-editor would have exploded at
  the meagre details with which Tab supplied his newspaper that night.</p>

  <p>He reached home at half-past eleven with a queer little ache at his heart.
  What was Ursula Ardfern's secret? Why the mystery? Why must her mystery be
  interwoven with the greater and more sordid mystery of the old man's
  death?</p>

  <p>As he pushed open the door he saw a telegram in the box which was common
  to the whole of the flats, once the entrance door was closed. It was for him,
  and he tore open the envelope and unfolded its flimsy contents. It was handed
  in at Naples, and was from Rex.</p>

  <p>"Going on to Egypt; quite recovered. Shall be back in a month."</p>

  <p>He smiled to himself, and hoped that "quite recovered" referred to his
  youthful infatuation as well as his disordered nerves. He paused outside the
  door to his flat to find his key, and as he did so he thought he heard a
  sound. It may have come from one of the flats above, but he did not give it
  any importance, and, inserting the key, he caught a momentary flash of light
  through the transom of his sitting-room. It was as if at the second he had
  opened the door the lights in the sitting-room had been extinguished.</p>

  <p>It must have been an optical delusion, he thought; but the memory of the
  burglar came to him as he closed the door slowly behind him. For a second he
  hesitated, and then pushed open the closed door of the sitting-room. The
  first thing he noticed was that all the blinds were down, and he had left
  them up. He heard the sound of heavy breathing.</p>

  <p>"Who's there?" he asked, and then reached out his hand for the switch.</p>

  <p>Before his fingers could close upon the lever something struck him. He
  felt no pain, was conscious only of terrific shock that brought him to his
  knees, incapable of thought or movement. Somebody pushed past him in the
  darkness. There was a slam of the flat door, a quick patter of feet on the
  stairs, and the street door slammed.</p>

  <p>Still Tab remained on his hands and knees, held there by his own
  invincible will. There was a trickle of warm blood running over his forehead
  and into the corner of his eye, and the subsequent smart of it brought him at
  last to his senses.</p>

  <p>He got unsteadily to his feet and put on the lights.</p>

  <p>It was a chair that had struck him; it lay overturned near the door. Tab
  felt gingerly at his forehead and then went in search of a mirror. The injury
  was a very slight one, the wound being superficial. He guessed that the chair
  must have caught against the wall and eased the blow, for one of the legs was
  broken and there was a long scratch on the wall.</p>

  <p>Mechanically he bathed his face, put a rough dressing on his forehead, and
  then went back to the sitting-room to get a better idea of the confusion
  which reigned there than he had been able to appreciate at first. Every
  drawer in his desk had been emptied. One which he kept locked, and which
  contained his more private papers, had been forcibly broken open and the
  contents were scattered, some on the floor, a few on the desk. A little
  bureau by the wall had been treated with the same lack of courtesy, and the
  floor was littered with its contents.</p>

  <p>He found the same in his bedroom; every drawer rummaged except his
  wardrobe, every box opened.</p>

  <p>In Rex's room the only thing that had been touched was the second trunk
  that the burglar had left on his previous visit. This was on the bed, opened,
  and its contents had been thrown around in confusion.</p>

  <p>Tab's gold watch and chain, which he had inadvertently left behind, was
  untouched. His cash-box had been wrenched open, but though the money had been
  emptied out not a cent had been taken. Then he made a curious discovery. In
  one of the drawers of his desk he had a portfolio of photographs of himself
  which had been made a year before at the request of his many maiden aunts.
  This had been removed, and every photograph torn into four pieces. He found
  the debris with the other papers. It was the only wanton damage that the
  burglar had done. For what had he been searching? Tab puzzled his brains to
  remember the possession of something which might interest an outsider. What
  did Rex own that was worth all the trouble that this unknown visitor had
  taken?</p>

  <p>He got on to the telephone and tried to reach Carver, and then remembered
  Carver had told him the station 'phone was out of order.</p>

  <p>On the stroke of midnight Inspector Carver was tidying his desk
  preparatory to leaving when a dishevelled and damaged Tab made his
  appearance.</p>

  <p>"Hullo," said Carver, "been fighting?"</p>

  <p>"The other fellow did the fighting," said Tab. "Carver, I am going to sue
  the men who supplied us with our furniture. He said that the chairs were
  mahogany, and they are only pine."</p>

  <p>"Sit down," commanded the detective; "you seem to be a little out of your
  mind." And then quickly, "You haven't had another visit from your
  burglar?"</p>

  <p>Tab nodded. "And what is more, I found him at home," he said grimly, and
  related all that had happened in the flat.</p>

  <p>"I'll come along and see the damage, though I don't think it will help us
  much," said Carver slowly. "So he tore up your photographs, did he? That is
  rather interesting."</p>

  <p>"I guess he didn't like me," said Tab. "I have been trying to remember all
  the crooks I have annoyed. Carver. It can't be young Harry Bolter, because he
  must be still in prison; and it can't be Low Sorki, because, if I remember
  rightly, he got religion in prison and he is now conducting a mission to the
  submerged. They are the only two people who expressed their intention of
  cutting short my young life."</p>

  <p>"It is neither of those." Carver was emphatic on this point "Tell me
  again, Tab, from the moment you opened the door to the moment you lost
  interest in the proceedings, just what happened. First, did you close the
  flat-door behind you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Tab, surprised.</p>

  <p>"And then you went into the sitting-room, and he caught you a whack with
  the chair? There were no lights?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever."</p>

  <p>"No light on the landing outside the flat door?" asked Carver eagerly.</p>

  <p>"None."</p>

  <p>"And he just rushed past you and was gone. You remember that very well, I
  suppose, although you were knocked out?"</p>

  <p>"I remember his going and hearing the door slam," said Tab, wondering.</p>

  <p>Carver was making notes on his blotting-pad in that strange system of
  shorthand which nobody understood but Carver.</p>

  <p>"Now, Tab, think very carefully before you reply, was there anything in
  Lander's box, any reference to his uncle, any document respecting his uncle,
  anything, indeed, that had to do, even remotely, with Trasmere, in that box
  of Lander's? Because I am perfectly certain that there was the objective and
  that the search of your room was an after-thought. In fact, it is proved by
  the circumstance of the thief being in your room when you arrived--he had
  evidently left that search to the last."</p>

  <p>Tab concentrated his mind upon Rex and all Rex's belongings.</p>

  <p>"No," he confessed, "I can't remember anything."</p>

  <p>Carver nodded.</p>

  <p>"Very good," he said, rising; "and now we'll go along and look at this
  trouble of yours. When did it happen?"</p>

  <p>"About half an hour ago; maybe a little more," he looked up at the clock,
  "yes, it was nearer an hour ago. I tried to get you on the 'phone--"</p>

  <p>"The machine is out of order; it always is out of order," said the
  fatalistic Carver, "when there is real trouble around. In fact, if I obeyed
  my impulse, I should double the men on duty every time that 'phone falls
  down."</p>

  <p>They were in front of the station and the cab that Carver had called was
  pulling up to the kerb when another cab came dashing toward them, swerved to
  the side-walk, and stopped dead. Out of the cab's interior tumbled a man who
  was sketchily attired, and whose pyjama coat showed where his shirt should
  have been. Mr. Stott had arrayed himself hurriedly, and for once in his life
  was careless of appearance.</p>

  <p>He fell almost into Carver's arms, and his mouth opened and closed like a
  fish out of water. When he did speak his voice was a squeak.</p>

  <p>"They're at it again! They're at it again!" he piped.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch21"
     id="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

  <p class="first">MR. JOHN STOTT had discovered to his gratification that the
  association of his name with the Trasmere case had enhanced, rather than
  detracted from his social standing. It is true that the newspapers, having
  long ceased to take the slightest interest in the murder, seemed oblivious to
  the part he had played, or the startling discovery which he had to his
  credit, but a more important circle of public opinion, that circle which met
  daily at Toby's and discussed an expensive lunch and such matters of public
  interest as deserved attention, had applauded Mr. Stott's decision to place
  in the hands of the police authorities the information which, up to that
  moment, had been confined to some twenty commercial gentlemen, their wives,
  their wives' families, their servants, the servants of their wives' families,
  the families of the servants, to say nothing of personal friends of all and
  each, their servants and attachments.</p>

  <p>"So far as I am concerned, the matter is ended," said Mr. Stott one day at
  Toby's. "The police have behaved very shabbily. I have neither been thanked
  by the Commissioners nor their underlings."</p>

  <p>It is true that Mr. Stott had never expected thanks; it is true that he
  had expected a long term of imprisonment, and had shivered every time the
  door bell rang lest the callers be minions of the law, armed with warrants
  for his arrest. It is true that he had dismissed and re-engaged Eline at
  least twice a day, for having dragged him into this unenviable position.</p>

  <p>He had expected, at least, the severest censure and condemnation from all
  those who had to do with the administration of the law, but he had never
  expected a vote of thanks.</p>

  <p>"I told this fellow Carver," said Mr. Stott, "and Carver, I might say in
  passing, is one of those thick-headed, unimaginative men that have made the
  police force what it is--I told him, 'Don't ever expect any further
  information from me. If you do, you will be disappointed.'"</p>

  <p>"What did Carver say?" asked one of his fascinated audience.</p>

  <p>Mr. Stott shrugged his broad shoulders. "What could Carver say?" he asked
  enigmatically, and nobody seemed to be able to supply an answer on the spur
  of the moment.</p>

  <p>"In my opinion," said Mr. Stott impressively, "if a business man had had
  charge of this case, we should have had the murderer by the heels and
  executed by this time!"</p>

  <p>Here every one of the business men at the long table was in complete
  agreement. They shared a common faith that a man who can make money by
  selling sugar, or can acquire a competence by trading in margins, must
  necessarily be the best type of mind to tackle every problem, however
  obscure. It was their wont to shake their heads sadly at every mistake the
  administration made, and hypothesize the same situation if business men had
  been in control. It was accepted, without dispute, that no government or
  government department came up to the business man's standard of
  requirements.</p>

  <p>"They had their chance and they missed it," said Mr. Stott, "when the
  Chinaman and the woman were in the house and I was holding them--well, I was
  practically holding them--the police could have caught the whole gang if they
  had arrived in time. As it was, they allowed them to slip through their
  fingers. I hate to say so, though it has struck me since, that probably the
  police were in it!"</p>

  <p>"In the house?" asked a foolish man.</p>

  <p>"No," snapped Mr. Stott, "in the plot, man! Anyway, I've washed my hands
  of the whole affair."</p>

  <p>Mr. Stott was in the habit of washing his hands of the whole affair twice
  a day, once at lunch and once after dinner.</p>

  <p>He washed his hands that night to his placid wife, not only of the
  Trasmere case, but of Eline's tooth; and he washed them with such effect on
  Eline herself, that she reluctantly agreed to have the offending ivory
  extracted on the following morning.</p>

  <p>She did this after making the most searching inquiries as to whether
  people told their more intimate secrets when they were under the effects of
  anaesthetics.</p>

  <p>Mr. Stott went up to bed at eleven o'clock, had a bath, and got into his
  pyjamas. The night was warm--indeed it was oppressively hot, and bed was very
  uninviting. He opened the French window of his room and, stepping out on to
  the small balcony, he seated himself in a cane chair which occupied exactly
  one half of the balcony space, and enjoyed what little breeze there was. His
  partner having gone to bed to sleep, was behaving according to plan. Mr.
  Stott remained contemplating the deserted street, and then crept downstairs
  and brought back his cigar-case.</p>

  <p>He smoked enjoyably for half an hour, watched the Manders return from the
  theatre, and duly noted that Mr. Trammin, who lived three doors away from
  him, returned home in a state of intoxication and offered to fight the cabman
  for his fare. He saw old Pursuer's car stop at "Flemington," and when these
  interests were exhausted, and his cigar was nearly through, he saw two men
  walking slowly toward him along the opposite side-walk. He failed to identify
  them, and had ceased to be interested in their movements when they turned
  into the gateway of Mayfield.</p>

  <p>Instantly Mr. Stott was alert. They might be police officers, only--the
  sound of a large voice came to him.</p>

  <p>"Let me tell you, my dear fellow, that Wellington Brown is a good friend
  and a bad enemy!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Stott nearly fainted. Wellington Brown! The man whose portrait had
  been in the newspapers; the man for whom the police were searching!</p>

  <p>The other said something in a voice which did not reach the balcony.</p>

  <p>"I am not threatening," said the strident voice of Wellington Brown.</p>

  <p>They walked up the steps to the door of Mayfield and disappeared from
  view.</p>

  <p>Mr. Stott rose with knees that trembled. In the shortest space of time he
  was at the telephone. Carver's number he knew; he had been on to him several
  times in connection with the unfortunate little disagreement he had had with
  the police.</p>

  <p>But Carver's number was out of order. The operator could not get any
  reply, she said.</p>

  <p>Strong as was Mr. Stott's repugnance to assist the police in the lawful
  execution of their duty, he dashed to his bedroom, pulled on his trousers
  over his pyjama-legs, and with trembling fingers buttoned himself up. There
  was no time to get into boots, and it was in his bedroom slippers that he
  shuffled down the street in search of a cab, looking back fearfully from time
  to time, lest the mysterious men who had entered Mayfield should be upon his
  track with murder in their hearts.</p>

  <p>After an unconscionable time a taxi-cab came past and Mr. Stott flung
  himself into the interior.</p>

  <p>"Central Police Station," he gasped, "quick! Double fare if you get me
  there in ten minutes."</p>

  <p>He knew that was the usual thing to say in such circumstances. As even a
  slow taxi could have covered the distance in five, Mr. Stott's instructions
  were misplaced.</p>

  <p>"They're at it again," he quavered as he fell into Carver's arms.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch22"
     id="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

  <p class="first">"AT what again?" asked Carver quickly.</p>

  <p>"Mayfield," gurgled Mr. Stott; "two men!"</p>

  <p>"Two men have gone into Mayfield? When?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know how long ago. I saw them. One was Brown."</p>

  <p>"Wellington Brown? Are you sure?"</p>

  <p>"I heard him speak," said the agitated Mr. Stott; "I'll swear to it in a
  court of law. I was sitting on the balcony smoking a cigar, a box which a
  friend of mine has given to me--perhaps you know Morrison of the Morrison
  Gold Corporation--"</p>

  <p>But Carver had gone back into the station with a rush, to reappear almost
  immediately.</p>

  <p>He bundled Tab into a taxi and shot a direction at the driver.</p>

  <p>"I had to go back to get our own key," he said, "and--" he took something
  from his coat pocket and Tab heard the snick of an automatic jacket being
  pulled back. "Unless this man is suffering from delusions, we are going to
  see developments to-night, Tab."</p>

  <p>He looked back through the peep-hole at the back of the cab. The other
  taxi was following at a distance.</p>

  <p>"I brought out every available man," he said. "I wonder if they found room
  for Stott? Anyway, he can walk," he added cruelly.</p>

  <p>Mayfield was in darkness when the cab drove up to the gate.</p>

  <p>Carver sprang out, ran across the concrete yard and up the steps to the
  door with Tab at his heels. He flashed a pocket lamp upon the keyhole, flung
  the door wide open as the second cab drew up at the gate to discharge half a
  dozen police officers in various stages of attire.</p>

  <p>The hall was in darkness, but they had the lights on in a second and
  Carver ran into the sitting-room. The door leading to the vault was open.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" said Carver thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>He came back to give instructions to his posse, and then, followed by Tab,
  he went down the stone steps and along the corridor. The door of the vault
  was closed and locked and the room was unlighted. Carver felt in his pocket,
  took out the duplicate key--that upon which Walters had worked so
  industriously--and snapped back the lock. A touch from his thumb and the
  vault was flooded with light.</p>

  <p>He paused in the open doorway and looked. Wellington Brown was lying face
  downward in the centre of the room, blood was flowing from under him, and on
  the table, in the exact centre, was the key of the vault!</p>

  <p>Carver picked it up. There was no doubt about it; the old bloodstain was
  still upon it, and he looked blankly at his companion.</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you think of that, Tab?" he asked in a hushed voice.</p>

  <p>Tab did not reply. He was standing just inside the door-way looking down
  at his feet, and between his feet was something, the sight of which deprived
  him of speech. He stooped slowly and picked it up, laying it upon the palm of
  his hand.</p>

  <p>"Another new pin!" said the detective thoughtfully. "This time,
  inside!"</p>

  <p>A thorough search of the house failed to discover the second man. He must
  have made his escape just before the police arrived, for the smoke of the
  pistol's explosion still hung in the vaulted roof.</p>

  <p>When the doctors came and the body was moved Tab spoke what was in his
  mind.</p>

  <p>"Carver, I have been a fool," he said quietly. "We ought to have been able
  to prevent this; we should have done if I had only remembered."</p>

  <p>"What?" asked Carver, arousing himself from thoughts which did not seem to
  be particularly pleasant, to judge from his expression.</p>

  <p>"That key was in Rex's box. I remember now that he mentioned casually that
  he put it in his trunk before he went away."</p>

  <p>Carver nodded.</p>

  <p>"I guessed that," he said. "Probably we both arrived at that solution when
  we saw the key on the table. The burglary of your flat is, of course,
  explained. He came the first time for the key and was disturbed by the tenant
  from the flat beneath, and got away before it had been found. To-night, the
  need being urgent, he took a chance, found the key, and--" he shrugged. "How
  did the key get on the table? The door was locked both sides, yet there is
  the key--and the new pin," he added half to himself, "the second new
  pin."</p>

  <p>He got up and stretched himself and began to pace up and down old
  Trasmere's sitting-room.</p>

  <p>"No weapon, nothing but the body--and the new pin," he mused, half to
  himself. "This lets out friend Walters, of course; there isn't a shadow of
  evidence against him after this second murder. We can hold him for theft on
  his own confession--but no more. Tab, I am going down to the vault; I don't
  want you to come with me. There are one or two things that I want to be
  certain about."</p>

  <p>He was gone half an hour, and Tab, whose head was throbbing, was glad to
  see him when he returned.</p>

  <p>Carver said nothing, walked out into the hall where the police constable
  was sitting.</p>

  <p>"Nobody is to be allowed into this house unless they are accompanied by
  me," he said.</p>

  <p>He drove Tab to Doughty Street and went up to see the damage that the
  burglar had done. But he was less interested in the condition of Rex Lander's
  wardrobe than he was in the torn photographs. He held their borders to the
  light.</p>

  <p>"No finger-prints: he wore gloves, of course. I wondered if--yes, ah, here
  it is." He pieced together a torn photograph; scrawled on the face was a
  heavy black cross. "Yes, I expected that," he said to himself.</p>

  <p>"If I were you, Tab, I should put the bolt on the door to-night. I don't
  want to alarm you unduly, but I rather think you should. The Man in Black is
  going to stop at nothing. Have you got a gun?" Tab shook his head, and Carver
  slipped the automatic from his pocket and laid it on the table.</p>

  <p>"Borrow mine," he said; "and take my considered advice--do not hesitate to
  shoot anybody you find in this flat, or in your room to-night."</p>

  <p>"You are a cheerful little soul, Carver!"</p>

  <p>"Better be cheerful than dead," said the detective cryptically, and left
  him to puzzle it out.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch23"
     id="ch23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

  <p class="first">THE noise of the roaring presses came up to Tab as he worked
  in his office. The building shook and trembled, for every machine was running
  with the story of the mystery of Mayfield. Slip by slip his copy was rushed
  to the linotype room.</p>

  <p>Presently the presses would stop and the last city edition would be
  prepared.</p>

  <p>He finished at last, pulled the last sheet from the typewriter, and
  hunched himself back in the chair.</p>

  <p>To the detective's warning he gave no serious attention. He was perfectly
  satisfied in his own mind that the burglar had come to his flat in order to
  secure the key. The menace was not against himself, but against Rex Lander.
  What was that menace? he wondered. Had the old man some other relative who
  felt himself wronged when the property passed into the hands of the Babe? He
  was confident that the search of his own belongings had been made in order to
  find something that had to do with Rex. As to the tearing up of his
  photographs--he grinned at the thought.</p>

  <p>"I never did like those pictures, anyway," he said.</p>

  <p>"Which pictures?" asked the solitary reporter in the room.</p>

  <p>"I am vocalizing my thoughts and unveiling the tablet of my mind," said
  Tab politely.</p>

  <p>The late-duty man grinned.</p>

  <p>"You are a lucky devil," he said, "to be in both these cases. I have been
  five years on this paper and have never had anything more exciting than a
  blackmail case which was hushed up before it went into court. What's that
  drawing?"</p>

  <p>"I am trying to draw a plan of the vault and the passage," said Tab.</p>

  <p>"Was the body found in exactly the same place?" asked the interested
  reporter.</p>

  <p>"Almost," said Tab.</p>

  <p>"And the key?"</p>

  <p>Tab nodded.</p>

  <p>"Is there a window to the vault?" asked the reporter hopefully.</p>

  <p>Tab shook his head.</p>

  <p>"If the murderer was a bug he couldn't have got into that vault without
  unlocking the door," he said.</p>

  <p>As he was speaking the chief came in. He very seldom visited the
  reporters' room, and it was unusual to find him at the office at all after
  eleven o'clock. But the news of the crime had been telephoned to him and he
  had driven in. He was a stout man, with grey hair and a disconcerting habit
  of anticipating excuses. He was at once High Priest and Father Confessor of
  The Megaphone office.</p>

  <p>"Come into my room, Holland," he said, and Tab obeyed meekly.</p>

  <p>"The Trasmere murder seems to have been repeated in every detail," he
  said. "Have you found out where this man Brown has been?"</p>

  <p>"I gather that he has been in an opium den of some kind," said Tab. "Yeh
  Ling--"</p>

  <p>"The man who owns the Golden Roof?" asked the editor quickly.</p>

  <p>"That's the chap. He gave us a hint that that is where Brown had been
  staying. The man was a notorious drug fiend."</p>

  <p>"I understand that two men went into the house together. Nobody saw the
  second man?"</p>

  <p>"Nobody except Stott," said Tab, "and Stott was so scared that he cannot
  give us anything like a picture of either of them. Certainly nobody saw him
  come out; he was gone when we arrived."</p>

  <p>"And the key on the table--what does this mean?"</p>

  <p>Tab made a gesture of despair.</p>

  <p>"Of course I know what it means," said the editor thoughtfully. "It is the
  murderer's defence, prepared with devilish ingenuity in advance. Don't you
  realize," he said, seeing that his junior was taken aback by this theory,
  "that before you can convict the man who killed Trasmere, and presumably also
  killed Brown, you would have to prove that it was possible for him to get
  into the vault and out again, lock the door, and return the key to the
  table--and that is just what you could not prove."</p>

  <p>That the murderer had this in his mind was a new possibility to Tab. He
  had regarded the appearance of the key as a piece of whimsical mystifying on
  the part of the murderer, an act of bravado rather than a serious attempt to
  save his own neck in the event of his detention.</p>

  <p>"Carver says--" he began.</p>

  <p>"I know Carver's theory," interrupted the chief. "He thinks that the
  murderer made a mistake in the first instance and intended leaving the pistol
  behind, with the idea of conveying the impression that Trasmere committed
  suicide. He would have been more clever than that; he certainly would not
  have shot him in the back. No, there is the fact. I was discussing it with a
  lawyer only last night and he agreed with me. The murderer who killed those
  two unfortunate fellows is determined that there shall be no conclusive
  evidence against him, and there will be none until you can prove how that key
  came to get on the table after the door had been locked from the outside.</p>

  <p>"Now, Holland," his manner was very serious, "there is certain to be
  terrible trouble over this crime, and somebody is going to be badly hurt
  unless the murderer is brought to justice. That somebody will be your friend
  Carver, who, presumably, is in charge of this case and was in charge of the
  other. I like Carver," he went on, "but I must join with the hounds that will
  put him down unless he can give us something more than theories. And you are
  in it, too"--he tapped Tab's chest with his plump forefinger--"head, heels,
  and eyebrows! You are in it from my point of view, especially because it is
  your job to show the police just where they are wrong, and you have had
  exceptional opportunity. I am not going to say what will happen to you if you
  don't get the biggest story of your life out of this murder, because I don't
  believe in threatening a man who may fall down here and come up smiling on
  another case, and anyway you are too good a man to threaten. But we've got to
  get this crime cleared up, Holland."</p>

  <p>"I realize that, sir," said Tab.</p>

  <p>"And it will be cleared," said the editor, "when you have discovered how
  that key got on the table. Don't forget that, Holland. Mark that! Puzzle your
  young brain and get me a solution of that mystery and all the other mysteries
  will be cleared up."</p>

  <p>Tab knew that Carver was still at Mayfield; he had gone back there after
  inspecting the rack and ruin left by the burglar in Doughty Street, and Tab
  went straight on from the office to find, as he had expected, that Inspector
  Carver had by no means completed his investigation.</p>

  <p>"The pins are different," were his first words.</p>

  <p>The bright little articles were tying on the table before him, and Tab saw
  at a glance that one was shorter than the other.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if our friend missed it," said Carver. "He must have done so on
  this occasion, though he probably overlooked the loss on the first murder.
  Anyway, what is a pin more or less?" he added moodily. "Come down to the
  vault, Tab."</p>

  <p>The door of the strong room was open and the light burning when Tab went
  in. He looked at the second stain on the floor, and, despite his excellent
  nerves, shuddered.</p>

  <p>"No weapon was found--he did not even attempt to fake a suicide."</p>

  <p>Tab told him then his chief's opinion on that matter, and Carver listened
  with respect and growing interest.</p>

  <p>"That never occurred to me," he said, "though it is nevertheless a fact
  that it would be next to impossible to bring the crime home to the man even
  if we found him in the passage with a smoking revolver in his hand."</p>

  <p>"In that case," said Tab, "we shall never find him at all."</p>

  <p>Carver was silent.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't go so far as taking that view," he said at last, "but it is
  certainly going to be difficult. There are no finger-prints," he said, when
  Tab looked inquiringly at one of the polished black boxes on the shelf. "Our
  mysterious Man in Black wore gloves. By the way, I am going to keep an
  officer on duty in the house for a day or two, to discover whether the
  murderer returns. I have no hope that he will."</p>

  <p>He turned the light out, locked the door of the vault, and then went back
  to the sitting-room.</p>

  <p>"This lets out Felling. I think I have made that remark before," said the
  detective. "Obviously he was innocent, because at the moment this crime was
  committed he was under arrest. Incidentally"--he made a little face--"it lets
  out Brown! In fact, Tab, the only two people who seem to be left in are you
  and I."</p>

  <p>"That occurred to me too," said Tab with a quick smile.</p>

  <p>That morning he got up to find a bulky letter in his box.</p>

  <p>It was unstamped and had been delivered by hand, and recognizing the
  superscription he opened it with an exclamation of surprise. It was dated
  Hotel Villa, Palermo, and was from Rex.</p>

  <p>"DEAR TAB" (it read). "I am tired of travel and I am coming home. Loud
  cheers from Doughty Street! The mails here are very erratic, and I have just
  heard horrific stories of the pilfering that goes on in the Italian post
  offices, so I am asking one of the stewards of the Paraka, the ship on which
  I came to Naples, and which is leaving here to-day, to deliver this for me,
  the enclosed being of some value. I picked it up in a little shop in Rome,
  and knowing how interested you are in crime and criminals I am sure you will
  appreciate it. It is a scarab ring, authentically the property of Caesare
  Borgia. In fact I have with it a guarantee as long as your arm..."</p>

  <p>Tab read no farther, but took up the ring that had come out of the
  envelope and examined it curiously. It was even too small for his little
  finger, but it was a beautiful piece of work, the beetle being cut from a
  solid turquoise.</p>

  <p>"Don't bother about tipping the steward," (the letter went on), "I am
  tipping like a Croesus, and I have given him enough money to set himself up
  for life. I haven't the slightest idea what I shall do when I come back, but
  I am certainly not going to that charnel-house of Uncle Jesse's; and as you
  will not have me, I shall probably live luxuriously at the best hotel in
  town. Forgive me for not writing before, but pleasure is a great business.
  Yours ever, REX."</p>

  <p>There was a P.S.</p>

  <p>"If the fast boat calls here on Wednesday, and there is some uncertainty
  as to whether it will or not, I think I shall come straight away home. If you
  don't hear from me you will know I have changed my mind. There are some
  stunning girls in Palermo."</p>

  <p>There was a further P.S.</p>

  <p>"We will have a dinner the night I return. Invite that sixty-nine-inch
  brain of yours, Carver."</p>

  <p>Tab grinned, put the ring and the letter away in his desk, and gave
  himself over to the serious consideration as to whether it would be advisable
  for Rex to come back to Doughty Street. He missed him terribly at times.
  Apparently he had got over his infatuation for Ursula, for the references to
  the stunning girls at Palermo did not seem to harmonize with a broken
  heart.</p>

  <p>He had arranged to go to tea with Ursula that afternoon, but he had his
  doubts as to whether he would be able to keep his promise. The second case
  was absorbing every minute of his time and he was already regretting the bond
  of secrecy under which he worked.</p>

  <p>On this subject he spoke frankly to Carver when he saw him. Carver saw his
  point of view.</p>

  <p>"There is no reason now why you shouldn't tell everything--the full story
  if you like, Tab, all except--all except the new pins," he added.</p>

  <p>Tab was delighted. So far he had only been able to give the vaguest
  outlines of the story in print, and the lifting of the embargo simplified his
  work enormously; incidentally it gave him time to see Ursula.</p>

  <p>And she was glad to see him. She threw out two impulsive hands and gripped
  his as he came into her sitting-room at the Central.</p>

  <p>"You poor hard-worked man! You look as if you haven't slept for a week,"
  she said.</p>

  <p>"I feel that way," said Tab ruefully, "but if I yawn whilst I am with you,
  throw a cup at me--not necessarily an expensive cup--I respond to the
  commonest of crockery."</p>

  <p>"Of course you are working on this new crime?" she asked, busy with the
  teapot. "It is dreadful. Brown is the poor fellow they were trying to
  discover, weren't they? Isn't he the man that Yeh Ling spoke about?"</p>

  <p>Tab nodded.</p>

  <p>"Poor soul," she said softly; "he was from China also? I remember. And you
  have captured Walters. I never thought that Walters was guilty. I did not
  like the man; I had seen him once and felt instinctively repulsed from him,
  though I never thought that he would murder Mr. Trasmere."</p>

  <p>She turned quickly to another topic with relief.</p>

  <p>"I have had an offer to go back to the stage, but of course I am not
  going," she said. "I wonder if you will believe me when I tell you that I
  hate the stage? It is full of the most unhappy memories for me."</p>

  <p>Suddenly a thought struck Tab.</p>

  <p>"I heard from Rex this morning," he said. "He is coming back again. You
  haven't heard from him?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head and her eyes were grave.</p>

  <p>"Not since he wrote me that letter," she said. "I am dreadfully
  sorry."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't be," he smiled. "I think Rex has made a very good recovery.
  Besides, it is the prerogative of youth to fall in love with beautiful
  actresses."</p>

  <p>"Spoken like a greybeard," she said, with laughter in her eyes. "You are
  never so amusing as when you are patriarchal, Mr. Tab. Did you escape that
  heart-breaking experience?"</p>

  <p>"Falling in love with actresses?" said Tab. "Yes, up to a point."</p>

  <p>"What was the point?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Well 'point' doesn't quite express my meaning," said Tab carefully. "I
  should have said up to a date."</p>

  <p>Her eyes caught his and dropped.</p>

  <p>"I don't think that I should make any exceptions if I were you," she said
  in a low voice. "Loving people can be a great nuisance."</p>

  <p>"You have found it so?" said Tab, icily polite.</p>

  <p>"I have found it so," she repeated, and went on quickly: "What is Rex
  going to do with life? He is very wealthy. Curiously enough I never dreamt
  that Mr. Trasmere would leave him everything. He used to grumble about Mr.
  Lander's laziness to me, but I suppose he had not made any preparation for
  his terribly sudden end, and Mr. Lander inherited by right of relationship.
  He was Mr. Trasmere's next-of-kin, was he not?"</p>

  <p>"I believe he was," said Tab; "but the dear old man made a will, written
  in his own hand, leaving Rex everything."</p>

  <p>He heard a crash and stared stupidly at the cup that had fallen to the
  floor and broken, and then looked up in amazement at Ursula. She was standing
  stiffly erect, her face as pale as death, staring at him.</p>

  <p>"Say that again," she said hollowly.</p>

  <p>"What?" he asked puzzled. "About Rex inheriting the property? You knew
  that."</p>

  <p>She stood with compressed lips and then:</p>

  <p>"Oh, my God!" she whispered. "Oh, my God, how dreadful!"</p>

  <p>In a second he was by her side, his arm about her. "What is it, Ursula?"
  he asked anxiously, "are you ill?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, I have had a shock. I have just remembered something. Won't you
  please forgive me?"</p>

  <p>She turned from him quickly and ran out of the room, leaving Tab a prey to
  various emotions. He waited for fully a quarter of an hour before she
  reappeared. She was still pale, but she was calm, and her first words were an
  apology.</p>

  <p>"The truth is," she said with a faint smile, "I am a nervous wreck."</p>

  <p>"What was it I said that upset you?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know...you talked about the will...and it brought it all back,"
  she said hurriedly.</p>

  <p>"Ursula, you are not speaking the truth. Accidentally I must have said
  something that horrified you. What was it?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I am telling you the truth, Tab," she said, and in her distress dropped
  the prefix.</p>

  <p>It was his flush that reminded her.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I ought not to call you Tab," she said, a trifle incoherently,
  "but we actresses are bold and brazen women. I thought with your vast
  experience you would have known that. Really, I should have begun calling you
  Tab the first time I met you. And now you want to go...you are trying to tell
  me that you don't want to go until I explain what it was that distressed me,
  and you are going to refuse all explanation about my poor nerves, so I can
  see we are likely to have an interminably quarrelsome evening. Come and see
  me to-morrow--Tab."</p>

  <p>He took her hand and kissed it, and felt awkward and artificial.</p>

  <p>"That was very sweet of you," she said gently.</p>

  <p>When Tab left her he was feeling amazingly happy.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch24"
     id="ch24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

  <p class="first">To the left of the vermilion door of Yeh Ling's new house
  was a tablet let into the brick buttress inscribed with those words which to
  the old Chinese represent the beginning and end of philosophical piety: Kuang
  tsung yu tou, which in English may be roughly translated: "Let your acts
  reflect glory upon your ancestors."</p>

  <p>Yeh Ling, for all his Western civilization, would one day burn gold paper
  before a shrine within those vermilion doors and would stand with hidden
  hands before the family shrine and ask commendation and approval for his
  important acts.</p>

  <p>Now he was sitting on one of the very broad and shallow steps that led
  from terrace to terrace, watching the primitive system by which his engineer
  was getting ready the casting of the second concrete pillar. About the site
  were a number of bottomless tubs, hinged so that they opened like leg-irons
  open to receive the ankle of a prisoner. Steel brackets on each enabled them
  to be clamped together to make a long tube.</p>

  <p>The first of these was in its place, and sticking up from the centre was a
  rusty steel bar that drooped out of the true--the core of the pillar to be.
  High above on a crazy scaffolding was a huge wooden vat, connected with the
  tub by a wooden shoot. All day long an endless chain of buckets, responding
  to a hand-turned wheel, had been rising to the top of the platform, their
  contents being turned into the vat.</p>

  <p>"Primitive," murmured Yeh Ling; but in a way he liked primitive things and
  primitive methods.</p>

  <p>Down the shoot would run a stream of semi-liquid cement and rubble, and
  the two toiling labourers would pat and shovel the concrete into place until
  the tub was filled. Then to the first would be fastened a second mould, the
  process would be repeated, and the pillar would rise. Then, on a day when the
  cement had hardened, the connecting wedges would be knocked away, the hinged
  tubs prised loose, the rough places of the Pillar of Grateful Memories
  chiselled and polished smooth, and, crowned with a companion lion, the
  obelisk would stand in harmony with its fellow.</p>

  <p>Yeh Ling looked up at the frail scaffolding that supported the vat and the
  narrow platform, and wondered how many Western building laws he was breaking.
  The second tub was now brimming with the grey concrete and a third and a
  fourth were being fixed. All this Yeh Ling saw from his place on the steps, a
  cigar clenched between his small teeth. He saw the workmen climb down the
  ladders from the interior of the new tubs, and he glanced at the sun and
  rose.</p>

  <p>A blue-bloused Chinaman, ludicrously handling a fan, came running toward
  him.</p>

  <p>"Yeh Ling, we must wait four days for the water-stone to grow hard.
  To-morrow I will strengthen the wall of the terrace."</p>

  <p>"You have done well," said Yeh Ling.</p>

  <p>"I thought you wrong," said the builder nodding; "it seemed so much money
  to waste. He that is not offended at being misunderstood is a superior
  man."</p>

  <p>"He that fears to correct a fault is not a brave man," said Yeh Ling,
  giving one saying of Confucius for another.</p>

  <p>The workmen lived on the spot; their fires were burning when he left the
  ground. On the roadway was a small black car, a noisy testimony to the
  efficacy of mass production, and into this he stepped.</p>

  <p>He did not drive away for a long time, but sat hunched up at the wheel,
  his head sunk in thought.</p>

  <p>Once he glanced at the pillar in making: speculatively, as though his
  meditations had to do with this. It was growing dark when at last he put his
  foot upon the starting plug and rattled away into the gloom.</p>

  <p>He left the car at the side-door of the restaurant and passed in.</p>

  <p>"The lady is in No. 6," said his personal servant; "she wishes to see
  you."</p>

  <p>There was no need for Yeh Ling to ask which lady. Only one had the right
  of entry to No. 6. He went straight to her, dusty as he was, and found Ursula
  Ardfern sitting before an untouched meal.</p>

  <p>She was very pale, and a shadow lay beneath her grey eyes.</p>

  <p>She looked up quickly as he came in.</p>

  <p>"Yeh Ling, did you read all the papers we found in the house?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Some of them," he said cautiously.</p>

  <p>"The other night you said that you had read them all," she said
  reproachfully, "and you were not speaking the truth!"</p>

  <p>He agreed with a gesture.</p>

  <p>"There are so many," he said, excusing himself, "and some are very
  difficult Lady, you do not realize how many there were--"</p>

  <p>"Was there anything about me?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"There were references to you," he said. "Much of the writing was in the
  nature of a diary...it is hard to disentangle item from item..."</p>

  <p>She knew he was evading a direct answer.</p>

  <p>"Was there any mention of my father or mother?" she challenged him
  directly.</p>

  <p>"No," he said, and her grey eyes searched his face.</p>

  <p>"You are not speaking the truth, Yeh Ling," she said in a low voice. "You
  think if you speak...if you think I know, that I shall be hurt. Isn't that
  true? And because you would not hurt me, you are lying?"</p>

  <p>He showed no evidence of embarrassment at the accusation.</p>

  <p>"Lady, how can I say what is in papers which I have not read, or if I have
  read I cannot understand? Or suppose in his writings one revelation is so
  mixed up with another that it is impossible to betray one without the other?
  I will not deceive you. Shi Soh wrote about you. He said that you were the
  only person in the world he trusted."</p>

  <p>She looked her amazement.</p>

  <p>"I? But..."</p>

  <p>"He said other things...I am puzzled. It is not a simple matter to make a
  decision. Some day I must give you a translation of everything. I know that;
  it troubles me...what is best to do. We Chinese have a word for indecision.
  Literally it means a straw moving in cross currents--first this way, then
  that way. My mind is like that. I owe Shi Soh-Trasmere--much...how can I pay
  him? He was a hard man, but our words, one to the other, have been more
  binding than sealed papers, and once I said that I would serve his blood.
  That is my difficulty, a promise which is now..."</p>

  <p>Here, such was his emotion that his English failed him. She saw the dull
  red of his face, the veins of his temples standing out like knotted cords,
  and was sorry for him.</p>

  <p>"I will be patient, Yeh Ling," she said soothingly. "I know you are my
  friend."</p>

  <p>She held out her hand, remembered, and drawing it back quickly took her
  own and shook it with a delighted gurgle of laughter.</p>

  <p>Yeh Ling smiled too, as he followed her example.</p>

  <p>"A barbarous custom," he said dryly, "but from a hygienic point of view a
  very wise one. You are forgiving me, Miss Ardfern?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," she nodded. "And now I really am feeling hungry--will you
  send me some warm food--this is cold?"</p>

  <p>He was out of the room before her request was completed.</p>

  <p>It was like Yeh Ling that he did not come to the door when she went out.
  She hoped he would, but Yeh Ling could not have been there, for he was
  waiting outside, and when she turned the corner he was very near to her
  though she could not guess this.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch25"
     id="ch25"></a>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

  <p class="first">REX was home! His telegram, handed in at the docks, preceded
  him only by half an hour, and his thunderous knock at the door and his long
  and continuous peal on the bell told Tab the identity of the impatient
  caller, long before he had thrown open the door and gripped the hand of the
  returned traveller.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm back," said Rex heartily, as he dropped himself into a chair and
  fanned himself with his hat. He was looking thinner, a little more peaked of
  face, but the colour of health was on his cheeks and his eyes were
  bright.</p>

  <p>"You'll have to put me up, old man," he said; "I simply will not go to an
  hotel while you've an available bed in the flat; and besides, I want to tell
  you something about my plans for the future."</p>

  <p>"Before we start dreaming," said Tab, "listen to a little bit of sordid
  reality. You have been burgled, my lad!"</p>

  <p>"Burgled?" said Rex incredulously. "How do you mean, Tab? I left nothing
  to be burgled."</p>

  <p>"You left if couple of trunks which have been thoroughly and
  scientifically examined by somebody who has a grudge against you."</p>

  <p>"Good God!" said Rex. "Did they find the key? I only saw the story of the
  second murder when I landed."</p>

  <p>"You did leave the key in the trunk?"</p>

  <p>Rex nodded. "I left it in a box--a small wooden box with a sliding lid.
  There were two of these boxes, I remember, one in each trunk."</p>

  <p>"That was the object of the visit. Why he should mutilate poor me I find
  it difficult to explain."</p>

  <p>He told Rex Lander what happened on the night of the second burglary, and
  Rex listened, fascinated.</p>

  <p>"I've lost all the fun being away," he grumbled. "So poor old Brown was
  the victim, eh? And we thought he was the murderer. And Carver--what has he
  got to say about it?"</p>

  <p>"Carver is rattled, but mysterious," said Tab.</p>

  <p>Rex was deep in thought.</p>

  <p>"I am going to have that strong room bricked up," he said; "I made up my
  mind while I was on the ship. Anyway, I don't suppose anybody will want to
  buy the beastly place, and I shall have it on my hands for years. But I'll
  take pretty good care that tragedy number two doesn't become tragedy number
  three."</p>

  <p>"Why not remove the door?" suggested Tab, but Rex shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I won't have the vault turned into a show place," he said quietly.
  "Besides, it will likely enough stop a good sale. My own inclinations are to
  pull the house down and have it rebuilt; dig it out from foundation to roof
  and start afresh. But I don't think that even that would induce me to go and
  live there," he said. "Poor old Jesse's blood would rise up from the ground
  and find us wherever we were. There is a curse upon the house," he went on
  solemnly. "Some evil spirit seems to brood over it and inspire innocent men
  to these hideous crimes."</p>

  <p>Tab stared at him in amazement.</p>

  <p>"Babe," he said, "you've got poetical. I guess it is the air of
  Italy."</p>

  <p>Rex went red, as he always did when he was embarrassed. "I feel very
  strongly about the house," he said curtly, and Tab saw that he had hurt his
  feelings; but Rex's huff did not last long. He spoke of his voyage, the
  interesting places he had seen, and then: "You got my ring?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Rex, thank you; it is a beauty," said Tab. "It seems to me to be
  worth a terrible lot of money."</p>

  <p>"It didn't cost so much," said the other carelessly. "I've got a rich way
  of thinking nowadays, Tab. I shudder at myself sometimes."</p>

  <p>They fell to discussing Rex's immediate movements, and Tab succeeded in
  persuading him to go to the hotel. He had a reason for this; knowing the lazy
  nature of his former companion, he guessed that if Rex once got himself
  settled down in the flat he would never leave it.</p>

  <p>Rex questioned him closely about the second tragedy, plying him with
  innumerable questions.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I shall certainly have that place bricked up. I will put it in the
  hands of the builders right away," he said. "And as you decided to chuck me
  out, perhaps you will come and dine pretty frequently."</p>

  <p>He sent for his trunks the following day and made a call upon Carver. Tab
  heard later that under the personal direction of Rex all the deed-boxes and
  other movables in the vault had been moved by a gang of workmen, and that
  immediate preparations were being made to wall up this sinister chamber.</p>

  <p>It was like Rex to take up with enthusiasm some unexpected hobby. Carver
  told him, when next they met, that Rex haunted the builders' yard, was having
  elaborate plans drawn for a new house, and was himself entering with
  enthusiasm into the mysteries of mortar-making and bricklaying.</p>

  <p>"In fact," said Tab, "poor Rex is making himself an infernal nuisance. He
  has these spasms. About three years ago he decided, in defiance of his
  uncle's intentions, to become a great crime reporter, and spent so much time
  in The Megaphone library that the news-editor kicked. Whenever he wanted a
  book, Rex had it; whenever he wanted to look up some old and forgotten crime,
  there was Rex, in the midst of a chaos of cuttings. The present fit will last
  exactly three weeks; after that, Rex will buy a large hammock and a large bed
  and spend his time alternately on one or the other!"</p>

  <p>Tab did not see Ursula Ardfern for a week. He wrote to her once, for he
  was a little worried, remembering her fainting fit on her last night at the
  theatre, but he received a reassuring, indeed a flippant, message from Stone
  Cottage.</p>

  <p>"I have come back here and am entrenched against all mysterious Men in
  Black with an aged but active butler, who has served in the army and is
  acquainted with the use of lethal weapons. The late roses are out--won't you
  come and see them? They are glorious. And Yeh Ling's Temple of Peace is
  roofed with shining red tiles, and the villagers are breathing freely again
  at the prospect of his queer little labourers leaving the neighbourhood.</p>

  <p>"I drove over there yesterday and found Yeh Ling very sombre and very
  quiet, watching the final touches being put on what looked to be a huge
  barrel, but which I found was the mould in which the second of his great
  pillars is to be cast. It is the Pillar of Grateful Recollection, or
  something of the sort, and it is to be dedicated to--me! I feel thrilled! It
  is hard to believe that all these years Yeh Ling has remembered the trifling
  services I gave to his son; and isn't it curious, that in all those years,
  although I have met him many times, for I used to dine regularly at his
  restaurant (I dined there this week), he has never made one reference to the
  old days? It is a little eerie, isn't it?</p>

  <p>"I am learning to shoot. Forgive this inconsequence, but my butler (how
  grand that sounds!) is very insistent, and I practise every day in the
  meadows behind the house. I had no idea that a revolver was so very heavy or
  jumped so when you pressed the trigger, and the noise is appalling! I was
  scared almost to death the first day of the practice, but I am getting quite
  used to it now, and Turner says I shall make a crack shot.</p>

  <p>"If you come you will not lack for excitement. Personally I should have
  preferred that Turner would have given me lessons in archery; it is much more
  graceful and ladylike. Every time the pistol fires (it is an automatic) it
  blackens my hands horribly--and it stings!"</p>

  <p>Tab read the letter through very many times before he took the Hertford
  Road. He stopped en route to admire the monument which Yeh Ling had erected
  to his prosperity. He could admire, in all sincerity, for the house presented
  not only a striking, but a beautiful appearance. Its unusual lines, the
  quaint setting in which it stood, for the garden had now taken shape, the one
  lusty pillar that flanked the broad yellow path, made a striking picture.</p>

  <p>The workmen had not gone, and presently he spied Yeh Ling himself coming
  down the broad short flight of steps from the upper terrace.</p>

  <p>If he did not distinguish him at first, it was excusable, for he wore the
  blue blouse and baggy trousers of his workmen; but Yeh Ling had seen him and
  came straight to where he was standing.</p>

  <p>"You've nearly finished," said Tab, with a smile of greeting. "I
  congratulate you, Yeh Ling."</p>

  <p>"You think it is pretty," said Yeh Ling, in his grave cultured voice. "I
  have had the best builder I could get from China, and I have not stinted him.
  Some day perhaps you will come and see the interior."</p>

  <p>"What are they doing now?" asked Tab.</p>

  <p>"In a few days we shall cast a second pillar," said Yeh Ling, "and then
  the work is finished. You think I am at heart a barbarian?" Yeh Ling seldom
  smiled, but now his pale lips curled momentarily, "and you will take those
  pillars as proof?"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't say that--" began Tab.</p>

  <p>"Because you are so polite, Mr. Holland," said Yeh Ling; "but then, you
  see, we look at things from a different angle. I think your church steeples
  are ridiculous! Why is it necessary to stick a great stone spike on to a
  building to emphasize your reverence?"</p>

  <p>He searched in his blouse and brought out a gold cigarette case, and
  offered it to Tab. Then he lit a cigarette himself, inhaled deeply before he
  sent a blue cloud into the still air.</p>

  <p>"My pillar of Grateful Memories will have a greater significance than all
  your steeples," he said, "than all your stained-glass windows. It is to me
  what your War Memorial Crosses are to you, a concrete symbol (literally
  concrete!) of an intangible sentiment."</p>

  <p>"You are a Taoist?" asked Tab, interested. Yeh Ling shrugged his
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I am a believer in God," he said, "in 'x,' in something beyond
  definition. Churches and sects, religions of all kinds are monopolies. God is
  like the water that flows down the mountainside and fills the brooks and the
  rivers. There come certain men who bottle the waters, some in ugly bottles,
  some in beautiful bottles, and these bottles they sell, saying that 'only
  this water will quench your thirst.' That it does quench thirst we will not
  deny, but the water is often a little stale and flat and the sparkle has gone
  out of it. You can drink better from the hollow of your hands kneeling by a
  brook. In China we bottle it with mystic writings and flavour it with
  cinnamon and spices. Here it is bottled without any regard to the water, but
  with punctilious care as to the shape of the bottle. I go always to the
  brook."</p>

  <p>"You are a queer devil," said Tab, surveying the other curiously.</p>

  <p>Yeh Ling did not answer for a while, and then he asked: "Is there any news
  about the murder of Brown?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Tab; "where was he, Yeh Ling?"</p>

  <p>"He was in a smoke-house," said Yeh Ling, without hesitation. "I took him
  there at the request of my patron, Mr. Trasmere. The man had come over to
  give him trouble and Trasmere wanted me to look after him and see that he
  didn't make himself a nuisance. Apparently Brown had these bouts and then
  recovered, as opium smokers sometimes do, with a distaste for the drug. He
  must have recovered very suddenly and was gone before I could stop him and
  before the man who owned the house could let me know. I searched for him, but
  he disappeared, and I heard no more about him until I read in the newspapers
  that he was dead."</p>

  <p>Tab was thoughtful.</p>

  <p>"Had he any friends? You knew him in China?"</p>

  <p>Yeh Ling nodded.</p>

  <p>"Was there anybody who had a particular grudge against him--or against
  Trasmere?"</p>

  <p>"Many," said the other. "I, for example, did not like Brown."</p>

  <p>"But apart from you?"</p>

  <p>Yeh Ling shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Then you have not the slightest idea who was the murderer?"</p>

  <p>Again the inscrutable gaze of Yeh Ling met his.</p>

  <p>"I have an idea," he said deliberately, "I know the murderer. I could lay
  my hands upon him without the slightest difficulty."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch26"
     id="ch26"></a>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

  <p class="first">Tab gasped. "You're not joking!"</p>

  <p>"I am not joking," said Yeh Ling quietly. "I repeat, I know the murderer.
  He has been within reach of me many times."</p>

  <p>"Is he a Chinaman?"</p>

  <p>"I repeat he has been within reach of me many times," said Yeh Ling, "but
  there are reasons why I should not betray him. There are many reasons why I
  should kill him," he added reflectively. "You are going to see Miss Ardfern?"
  He changed the subject abruptly. "Do not go there in the afternoons, or if
  you do approach from the front of the house. Miss Ardfern is taking lessons
  in revolver shooting, and one of my men, who has been watching the house from
  the lower meadows, has had several narrow escapes."</p>

  <p>Tab laughed and offered his hand.</p>

  <p>"You are a strange man, Yeh Ling," he said, "and I don't know what to make
  of you."</p>

  <p>"That is my Oriental mystery," said the Chinaman calmly. "One reads about
  such things. 'For ways that are dark and for ways that are strange--' you
  know the stanza."</p>

  <p>Tab went away with an amused feeling that Yeh Ling had been laughing at
  him, but he had been serious enough when he had been talking about the
  murder; of that Tab was sure.</p>

  <p>Long before he reached the house he saw Ursula Ardfern.</p>

  <p>She was standing in the middle of the road opposite her gate, waving her
  hand to him, a dainty figure in grey, her flushed face shaded by a large
  garden hat.</p>

  <p>"I'm such an expert shot, now," she said gaily as he jumped off, "that I
  thought of putting a few long-range ones in your direction to see how you
  looked when you were scared."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you didn't, if Yeh Ling's uncomplimentary reference to your
  shooting is justified," he said, as he tucked her hand under his arm.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen Yeh Ling? And was he very rude about my marksmanship?"</p>

  <p>"He said you are a danger to life and property," said Tab gravely, and she
  laughed.</p>

  <p>"You would manage your bicycle better if you used both hands," she said,
  releasing her own. "I want you to see my heliotrope. I have to keep it in a
  garden by itself; it is a cannibal plant: it kills all the other flowers. How
  could you spare time to come down?" she asked, her voice changing; "aren't
  you very busy?"</p>

  <p>Tab shook his head. "I have been instructed to get very busy indeed," he
  said grimly.</p>

  <p>"Over this last case?"</p>

  <p>"I can do no more than the police are doing," he said, "and Carver seems
  to have lost hope, though he is a deceptive bird."</p>

  <p>"No clue of any kind has been discovered?"</p>

  <p>Tab hesitated here. He had promised Carver that he would not speak of the
  new pin, but perhaps the restriction was confined only to the printed
  word.</p>

  <p>"The only clues we have," he said, as he sat down by her side under the
  big maple, "are two very bright and very new pins which we found, one in the
  passage after the first murder, and one just inside the vault after the
  second. Both were slightly bent."</p>

  <p>She looked at him thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Two pins?" she repeated slowly. "How strange! Have you any idea of the
  use that was made of them?"</p>

  <p>Tab had no idea, neither had Carver.</p>

  <p>"The murderer was, of course, the Man in Black," she said.</p>

  <p>"I read an account of the case, particularly Mr. Stott's statement--he is
  the scared little man who ran away when Yeh Ling and I went to search the
  house for our papers. Yes, I say 'our' advisedly."</p>

  <p>"By the way, did Yeh Ling really find what he wanted?" She nodded. "And
  what you wanted?"</p>

  <p>She bit her lips. "I don't know," she said. "Sometimes I think he did and
  is keeping it from me. He swears that there was nothing of interest to me,
  but I believe he is being...kindly reticent. Some day I am going to have it
  out with him."</p>

  <p>The hand that was nearest to him was playing with a twig on the seat, and
  summoning his courage he took it in his own and she did not resist.</p>

  <p>"Ursula, it isn't easy...you'd think that a man with my enormous nerve
  could take the hand of a woman...that he loved...without his heart going like
  an aeroplane propeller, wouldn't you?"</p>

  <p>She did not answer.</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't you?" he repeated desperately. He could think of nothing else to
  say.</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," she said, not meeting his eyes. "And you'd think that an
  actress who had been made love to eight days a week, counting matinees, for
  years on end, would carry through a scene like this without having...an
  insane desire to burst into tears...if you kiss me, Turner will see
  you..."</p>

  <p>Tab could never remember that moment very clearly. He had a ridiculous
  recollection that her nose was cold against his cheek and that in some
  miraculous fashion a wisp of hair came between their lips.</p>

  <p>"Lunch is served, madam," said Turner awfully.</p>

  <p>He was an elderly, grim-looking man, and apparently he did not trust
  himself to look at Tab.</p>

  <p>"Very well, Turner," said Ursula, with extraordinary courage and coolness.
  And when he had gone: "Tab, you have realized poor Turner's worst fears; he
  told me that I was the first actress he had ever taken service with, and I
  gathered he looks upon the experiment as a dangerous one."</p>

  <p>Tab was a little breathless, but he had his line to say.</p>

  <p>"The only thing that can save your character, Ursula, is an immediate
  marriage," he said boldly, and she laughed and pinched his ear.</p>

  <p>The confusion of Tab's recollections of that day extended to the golden
  hours which followed. He came back to town in a desperate hurry--he was
  aching to write to her! He wrote and he wrote, and an expectant night-editor
  peeped in at him and crept softly away to warn the printer that a big story
  of the murder was coming along (the night-editor had distinctly counted a
  dozen folios to the left of Tab's elbow), and it was only at almost the
  eleventh hour that he found he was mistaken.</p>

  <p>"I thought you were doing the Mayfield murder. Where's your story?" asked
  the indignant man.</p>

  <p>"It is coming along," said Tab guiltily. He stuffed the unfinished letter
  into his inside pocket, set his teeth, and tried to fix his mind upon crime.
  He would stop at the most incongruous moments to conjure up a rosy vision of
  that day, only to turn with a groan to...</p>

  <p>"...the position of the body removes any doubt there may have been as to
  the manner in which the man met his death. The features of the two crimes are
  almost identical..."</p>

  <p>So he wrote at feverish haste for half an hour, and the night-editor,
  cutting out the superfluous "darlings" that appeared mysteriously in the
  copy, formed a pretty clear idea as to what Tab had been writing when he was
  interrupted.</p>

  <p>Tab posted the letter, went home, and began another, this being the way of
  youth.</p>

  <p>It was all a dream, he told himself when the morning came. It could not be
  true. And yet there was a fat envelope containing the letter he had written
  overnight, awaiting the post...</p>

  <p>Tab opened the letter and added seven pages of postscript.</p>

  <p>Later in the morning he asked Jacques, the news-editor, if he believed in
  long engagements. He asked this casually, as one who was seeking information
  for business purposes.</p>

  <p>"No," said Jacques decisively, "I don't. I believe after a man has been
  two or three years on a newspaper he gets stale, and ought to be fired."</p>

  <p>Tab had not the moral courage to explain the kind of engagement he
  meant.</p>

  <p>That day the weather broke. The rain shot down from low-hanging clouds,
  the temperature fell twelve degrees. Nevertheless, he thought longingly of
  the garden of Stone Cottage. It would be snug under the trees, snugger still
  in that long low-ceilinged sitting-room of hers. Tab heaved a deep sigh and
  strolled off to fulfil his promise to Rex.</p>

  <p>Rex was full of his new scheme, and dragged his visitor into the bedroom,
  where blue prints and maps and plans seemed to cover every available
  surface.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to build a veritable mansion in the skies," he said; "I have
  chosen the site. It is just this side of where Ursula Ardfern has her
  cottage. The only rising ground in the country."</p>

  <p>"I know the only hill in that part of the world," said Tab, with sudden
  interest, "but unfortunately you have been forestalled, Rex."</p>

  <p>"You mean by Yeh Ling." said the other carelessly; "I'll buy him off.
  After all, it is only a freak on his part to put up a house there."</p>

  <p>Tab shook his head. "You will have some difficulty in persuading him to
  sell," he said quietly. "I happen to know that he is almost as keen on his
  house as you are on yours."</p>

  <p>"Stuff," laughed Rex. "You seem to forget that I am made of money!"</p>

  <p>Tab shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I didn't forget that," he said, "but I repeat I know Yeh Ling."</p>

  <p>Rex scratched his head irritably. "It will be a shame if I can't get it,"
  he said. "Could you persuade him--I've rather set my heart on that site. I
  saw it once in the old days, long before I ever knew that Ursula Ardfern
  lived nearby, and I said to myself: 'One of these days I'll build a house on
  that hill.' How is my adored one, by the way?"</p>

  <p>The opportunity which Tab had wanted.</p>

  <p>"Your adored one is my adored one," he said quietly. "I am going to marry
  Ursula Ardfern."</p>

  <p>Rex fell into the nearest chair, looking at him with eyes and mouth wide
  open.</p>

  <p>"You lucky dog!" he said at last, and then he came to his feet with his
  hand outflung. "I go away on a holiday and you steal my beloved," he said,
  wringing Tab's hand. "No, I am not feeling at all bad about it--you are a
  lucky man. We must have a bottle on this."</p>

  <p>Tab was relieved, to an extent greater than he had anticipated. He had
  rather dreaded telling the love-sick youth that the object of his passion had
  agreed to bestow herself upon the best friend of the man who was responsible
  for their meeting.</p>

  <p>"You are going to tell me all about this," said Rex, busy with the
  wire-cutters; "and of course I'll be your best man and take in hand the
  arrangements for the swellest wedding this little village has seen in years,"
  he babbled on, and Tab was glad to let him talk.</p>

  <p>Presently they came back to the subject of the house. Rex made no attempt
  to hide his disappointment that the ideal site was taken.</p>

  <p>"I should have given it to you, old man," he said impulsively. "What a
  wedding gift for a pal! But you shall have a house that is worthy of you, if
  I have to build the darned thing myself! As an architect I am a failure," he
  went on; "my views are too eccentric. Poor old Stott swooned at the sight of
  some of my designs," he chuckled to himself. "I'm not going to give up the
  attempt to carry my great idea into effect," he told Tab at parting, "I shall
  see Yeh Ling at the earliest opportunity. I may be able to persuade him to
  sell."</p>

  <p>Tab went down to Hertford the next afternoon, and never had his bicycle
  moved more leisurely.</p>

  <p>"I told Rex," he blurted out, and he saw her face fall.</p>

  <p>"He wasn't hurt," said Tab, anxious to relieve her mind; "in fact, he
  behaved like a brick! Do you mind very much? My telling him, I mean?"</p>

  <p>"No," she said quietly. "He wasn't hurt?"</p>

  <p>Tab laughed. "It may sound uncomplimentary to you, but I am sure that Rex
  was only temporarily infatuated."</p>

  <p>He saw a smile dawning and took her face between his hands.</p>

  <p>"If I were Rex," he said, "I should hate Tab Holland."</p>

  <p>"Rex is stronger minded," she said. "Let us go into the garden. I have
  been thinking things out, and I feel that there is something that you ought
  to know, and the longer I put it off the harder it will be to tell."</p>

  <p>He followed her, carrying an armful of cushions, arranged her chair, and
  sat upon its arm; and then, in the most unconcerned voice, holding no hint of
  the tremendous statement she was to make, she said: "I killed Jesse
  Trasmere."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch27"
     id="ch27"></a>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

  <p class="first">HE leapt to his feet.</p>

  <p>"What?" he gasped.</p>

  <p>"I killed Jesse Trasmere," she repeated; "not directly, not with my hands,
  but I am responsible for his death, almost as assuredly as if I had shot
  him." She caught his hand and held it. "How white you are! I was a brute to
  put it that way. In our profession we love these dramatic--no, I don't mean
  that, Tab."</p>

  <p>"Will you tell me what you do mean?"</p>

  <p>She signalled him to sit on the foot-rest of the chair.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you something, but I don't think I'll tell you any more about
  the murder," she said, "and this is the something which you ought to know,
  and which I intended you should know. I had not the slightest intention of
  saying what I did.</p>

  <p>"The spirit of tragedy seems to haunt me," she said, staring straight
  ahead; "I was cradled in that atmosphere of violence and wickedness. I once
  told you, Tab, that I had been in service as a tweeny-maid, and I think you
  were startled. I went there from a public orphan's home, an institution where
  little children are taught to be born old. Tab...my mother was murdered, my
  father was hanged for her murder!"</p>

  <p>There was no pain in her eyes, just a little hardness. He took both her
  hands in his and held them.</p>

  <p>"I don't remember anything about it," she went on; "my earliest
  recollection was the long dormitory where about forty little girls used to
  sleep, a very fat matron, and two iron-faced nurses; and the why and
  wherefore of my being at Parkington's Institute only came to me late in life.
  One of the little girls had heard the matron tell the nurse, and I had to
  piece together the fact that I was an orphan by the act of my father, and
  that after his trial and execution I had been sent to this home to be brought
  up and educated for the profession which all good little girls follow, and
  which had, as its supreme reward, an appointment as under-cook. I was not so
  fortunate. I am afraid my cooking was rather vile, for when I came out of the
  Institute it was to take a place as under-housemaid and general help in the
  kitchen of a great society leader, who spent thousands of pounds upon
  charity, but weighed the very bread that her servants ate. I had only been in
  this place for three months when Mr. Trasmere made his appearance. It was on
  a cold windy afternoon--I remember it as distinctly as though it were
  yesterday--when one of the parlour-maids came and said I was to go up into
  the drawing-room. I found Mr. Trasmere alone, and I was rather frightened at
  the sight of him, for he did not speak, but sat with a little scowl on his
  face, taking me in from head to foot.</p>

  <p>"I was between twelve and thirteen then, a sensitive child, to whom life,
  as it came to me, was a veritable hell. He asked me what was my age, and
  whether I was happy, and I told him the truth. Apparently he had seen the
  authorities at the Institute, for I was allowed to go away with him, and he
  took me to a poor apartment house and placed me under the care of a woman who
  either owned or rented the house, and sublet the rooms furnished to the
  queerest lot of people I have ever seen congregated under one roof. Knowing
  him now much better, I am inclined to think that Mr. Trasmere owned the house
  himself and that the woman was his nominee. I did not see him again for
  nearly two months. I had a room to myself and he sent me school books to read
  and study, and it was whilst I was here that I first met Yeh Ling, who, as I
  have told you, was a poor waiter at a Chinese restaurant.</p>

  <p>"At the end of the two months Mr. Trasmere came for me, and his coming was
  heralded by the arrival of a huge box of clothes, the like of which I had
  never seen, let alone worn. He left a message that I was to be dressed and
  ready to go with him, and that afternoon he called and took me down into the
  country, to a preparatory school which, after the Institute, was heaven upon
  earth. On the way down he told me he had heard about me from some friends of
  his, and he wanted to give me an education which would fit me to take the
  position which he had for me, and I was so overcome by his kindness that I
  cried all the way to our destination.</p>

  <p>"The three years that I spent at St. Helen's seem, even now, like a
  beautiful dream. I was happy, I made many friends, and my whole outlook on
  life changed. The year I left, Mr. Trasmere came down to our Commemoration
  and saw me acting in a play which the school dramatic society had produced,
  and from what he saw was evolved this extraordinary arrangement. Knowing what
  I do, I know he was not wholly disinterested. It was his practice to take up
  projects and finance likely people. Once he told me that he had intended
  settling in this country and living the life of a gentleman--to use his own
  words--but that he was so unutterably bored that to give himself an interest
  he took up the most extraordinary of schemes.</p>

  <p>"Do you know at one time he financed twelve tearooms and collected his
  share of the takings every day? Do you know that he was behind three doctors
  and took his profits from each? He was Yeh Ling's backer, and in time he came
  to be mine. I was with him six months, acting as his secretary in a tiny
  office he hired for the purpose, and to which he never came until five
  o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

  <p>"Then it was that he suggested that I should go on to the stage, and sent
  me away with a touring company. Of course he was financially interested in
  it, and it was my duty to send him a daily return showing the amount of money
  we took every night. On Saturdays I paid the salaries and expenses and
  remitted the remainder to him. When the tour was finished I came back to
  town, to find that he had already made arrangements in his furtive, secretive
  way, to start a season with me as the principal attraction. My salary! You
  would laugh if I told you. It was hardly enough to keep body and soul
  together, only, as an excuse for his parsimony, he agreed that he would pay
  me one half of the profits over a certain amount.</p>

  <p>"To my astonishment, as well as to his, I became not only a respectable
  success, but a great financial success. The profits on my seasons were
  enormous; they exceeded to an incredible extent the amount he had fixed. And
  of course he paid. Jesse Trasmere's word was more than his bond. It was his
  oath.</p>

  <p>"His code was the code of the Chinese business man. When you know what
  that means, Tab, you will realize how very punctilious he was in such
  matters. He made exactly the same arrangements with Yeh Ling. There was the
  curious bond which bound us together, Yeh Ling and I--our shares were
  enormously in excess of his estimate. But he paid loyally.</p>

  <p>"Between him and me there was never an agreement of any kind. In the case
  of Yeh Ling there was an agreement, as you know. But the most bizarre aspect
  of my success was that I was compelled to continue as his secretary. Every
  night, when the theatre was closed, I motored to his house, dealt with his
  correspondence, and answered his letters. Sometimes I was so weary after a
  heavy evening that I could scarcely drag myself up the steps of Mayfield. But
  Jesse was inexorable. He never let up on any bargain he made, any more than
  he evaded the terms of any agreement which proved adverse to him.</p>

  <p>"When I began to get talked about he insisted upon my making a 'show,' as
  he called it, and bought a lot of jewels which he told me should be mine at
  his death. Whether he bought them--they did not look new to me--or whether he
  acquired them in one of those deals of his which nobody knew anything about,
  I am unable to say with certainty. They were beautiful--but they were not
  mine until his death. Every night I dined with him at Yeh Ling's, and he
  handed to me the jewel-case which he had taken from his bag, and every night
  I carried those jewels back to the house and gave them into his care."</p>

  <p>"Did the old man ever tell you how he came to seek you out?"</p>

  <p>She nodded, and a faint smile came and went. "Jesse Trasmere was very
  frank. That was one of his charms. He told me he knew my deplorable history,
  and he wanted somebody about whom he knew a few discreditable facts! He said
  that in almost those identical words. 'You'll have to go along as I want
  you,' he said; 'and the higher you get, and the more successful you become,
  the less you will want the news published that your father was a murderer.'
  And yet, curiously enough, he never objected to my taking my own name, for
  Ardfern is my name, for professional purposes. I don't suppose anybody at
  that dingy Institute associates me with the skinny little girl who used to
  scrub and peel and toil at uninteresting lessons from morning until
  night."</p>

  <p>"What was your father?" asked Tab, with an effort, for he expected that
  any reference to her parents must still wound her.</p>

  <p>To his surprise she answered readily.</p>

  <p>"He was an actor," she said, "and I think he was a clever actor until he
  took to drink. It was in drink that he murdered my mother. That much I learnt
  at the home--I have not troubled to inquire since. What are you thinking
  about, Tab?"</p>

  <p>His forehead was knit.</p>

  <p>"I am trying to recall the execution of any person named Ardfern in the
  last twenty years; I know them all by name." he said slowly. "Have you a
  telephone?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>In three minutes Tab was talking to the news-editor of The Megaphone.</p>

  <p>"Jacques," he said, "I want some information. Do you remember any person
  named Ardfern being executed for murder in the last"--he looked round at the
  girl--"seventeen or eighteen years?"</p>

  <p>"No," was the instant reply. "There was a man named Ardfern against whom a
  coroner's verdict of manslaughter was returned, but he skipped the
  country."</p>

  <p>"What was his first name?" asked Tab eagerly.</p>

  <p>"I am not sure that it was Francis or Robert. No, it was Willard--Willard
  Ardfern. I remember there were two 'ards' in it," said the
  information-bureau.</p>

  <p>"In what town was this crime committed?"</p>

  <p>Jacques answered without hesitation, giving the name of a small country
  town that Tab knew well.</p>

  <p>He hung up the receiver and turned to the girl.</p>

  <p>"What was your father's name?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Willard," she replied, without hesitation.</p>

  <p>"Phew!" whistled Tab, and wiped his streaming forehead. "Your father was
  not hanged."</p>

  <p>He saw her go red and white.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Perfectly sure. Old Jacques never makes a mistake. Besides which he had
  the name pat when I asked him. Willard Ardfern. He was indicted for
  manslaughter. I fear that your unhappy mother died of his violence, but
  Willard Ardfern himself left the country and was never arrested or
  tried."</p>

  <p>His arm went round her in support, she had gone suddenly white and
  ill-looking.</p>

  <p>"Thank God," she whispered. "That seemed...worse...than killing my poor
  mother. Oh, Tab, it has been such a nightmare to me! Such a dreadful,
  dreadful weight. You can't know how I felt about it."</p>

  <p>"Was it that?"--he hesitated--"something I had said that made you feel bad
  when we talked of Mr. Trasmere's will?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him steadily, but did not give an answer.</p>

  <p>"I used to hate this nightly borrowing of jewels"--she went back to her
  relations with Jesse Trasmere--"I had enough money to buy my own, though I
  have no particular leaning toward jewellery, but old Trasmere would not hear
  of it. Any movement towards my independence he checked ruthlessly."</p>

  <p>She stopped suddenly, and her mouth made a little O of surprise. "I wonder
  if he heard...in China?" she asked. "Yes, that is it! He must have met my
  father. That is how he came to know about me! I am sure Yeh Ling knows,
  because Mr. Trasmere had a habit of making elaborate notes--I wonder," she
  said, speaking to herself. Impulsively she threw out her hands and caught
  his. "Tab, the night you came into my dressing-room I felt instinctively that
  you were a factor in my life. I could never have dreamt how big a part you
  were going to be."</p>

  <p>For once in his life Tab could not think of an appropriate rejoinder.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch28"
     id="ch28"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE came to police-headquarters a tall, ruddy-skinned man
  of middle age. He wore a suit which was evidently not made for him, and he
  seemed a little depressed by his surroundings.</p>

  <p>"I have an appointment with Inspector Carver," he said, and passed a
  letter across the desk to the police clerk, who read it and nodded.</p>

  <p>"Inspector Carver is expecting you," he said, and called a messenger.</p>

  <p>Carver looked round as the door opened and viewed his caller with a
  speculative eye. Then he jumped up.</p>

  <p>"Of course!" he said. "Sit down, please."</p>

  <p>"I hope," began the man, "there isn't going to be any trouble."</p>

  <p>"Not for you," said Carver, "but I rather fancy there is trouble coming
  for somebody."</p>

  <p>The messenger closed the door and left them together.</p>

  <p>Half an hour later Inspector Carver telephoned for the office
  stenographer, and when the harassed man with the fresh face and ill-fitting
  clothes left the police office after a three-hour examination, Inspector
  Carver had material for much cogitation.</p>

  <p>Tab called in the ordinary way of duty and they discussed the latest
  tragedy, but never once did Inspector Carver make reference to his visitor of
  the morning. That was his secret, and too precious a one, in the
  circumstances, to breathe to a soul.</p>

  <p>He drove down that afternoon to the detention prison where Walters was
  awaiting trial and had a long talk with him.</p>

  <p>Yeh Ling was in his parlour, half way through his long weekly letter to
  his son, when Inspector Carver was announced. He put down his brush and gazed
  impassively upon the servant who had brought in the Inspector's card.</p>

  <p>"Is this man alone?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Yeh Ling. There is no one with him."</p>

  <p>Yeh Ling tapped his white teeth with his well-manicured nails.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said laconically, and there was something in Carver's face
  which told Yeh Ling all that he wanted to know.</p>

  <p>But there was a fight to be made yet, and he was not without hope that
  this matter of the Trasmere murder, and the tragedy that had followed, would
  be settled in a manner more consonant with his keen sense of obligation.</p>

  <p>The Inspector did not come to the point at once. He accepted a cigar that
  the Chinaman offered to him, spoke jocularly of Yeh Ling's letter-writing,
  asked a question or two about Ursula Ardfern, and at last hinted at the
  object of his visit.</p>

  <p>"Yeh Ling," he said, "I think the Trasmere case is coming to a
  solution."</p>

  <p>Yeh Ling's eyelids did not so much as flicker.</p>

  <p>"In fact," said the Inspector, carefully examining the ash of his cigar,
  "I have found the murderer."</p>

  <p>Yeh Ling said nothing.</p>

  <p>"I need very little confirmatory evidence to put the man who killed Jesse
  Trasmere on the trap," Carver went on.</p>

  <p>"And you have come to me to furnish that evidence," said Yeh Ling, with a
  touch of irony.</p>

  <p>Carver shook his head and smiled. "I don't know...I didn't think you
  would," he said, and then almost sharply: "Where are the documents you took
  from the Trasmere house the night you went there with Miss Ardfern?"</p>

  <p>The Chinaman got up without hesitation, unlocked a small safe in the
  corner of the room and brought out a thick packet of papers.</p>

  <p>"They are all there?" asked Carver, shooting a suspicious glance at the
  other.</p>

  <p>"All except two," was the cool reply; "one of which has reference to my
  interest in the Golden Roof and that is with my lawyer--"</p>

  <p>"And the other?" asked the detective.</p>

  <p>"That deals with matters of a sacred nature," said Yeh Ling, in that
  precise English that sounded almost affected.</p>

  <p>Carver bit his lip.</p>

  <p>"You know that this is the document I particularly want?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I guessed that," was the reply, "Nevertheless, Mr. Carver, I cannot give
  it to you; and if you know so much"--for a second a ghost of a smile lit his
  brown eyes--"then you will also know why it is not forthcoming."</p>

  <p>"Does Miss Ardfern know?"</p>

  <p>Yeh Ling shook his head.</p>

  <p>"She is the one person who must not know," he said emphatically. "If it
  were not for her"--he shrugged his shoulders--"you might see it."</p>

  <p>Carver knew that he was opposed by a will greater than his own, and that
  neither threats nor promises would move this impassive man from the attitude
  he had taken up.</p>

  <p>"What does it matter whether you see this paper or not?" asked Yeh Ling.
  "You say you know the murderer, that you have sufficient evidence to put him
  on the trap--but have you?"</p>

  <p>His look was a challenge.</p>

  <p>"You cannot convict a man on supposition, Mr. Carver. You must prove
  beyond any doubt whatever that Jesse Trasmere was killed by somebody who had
  the means of getting in and out that locked vault, and leaving the key on the
  table.</p>

  <p>"It is not enough to say: 'I am certain that this prisoner killed his
  benefactor!' It is not sufficient that you can show motives. You must produce
  the means! Until you can say the murderer obtained admission to the vault by
  this or that door, in this or that way, or that he employed these or those
  means to restore the key to the table from the outside of a locked door
  through which no key could pass, you cannot secure a conviction. That is the
  law. I studied law at Harvard, and I have the rules of evidence at my
  finger-tips." He smiled faintly. "You see, Mr. Carver, that the confirmatory
  evidence you require cannot possibly be supplied by me."</p>

  <p>Carver knew that he was speaking no more than the truth; that he was
  against a dead wall unless some human eye had witnessed the murder, and the
  method by which the murderer escaped.</p>

  <p>The logic of the Chinaman's criticism was irresistible, and Carver, who
  had seen success within reach, experienced a sense of failure at the very
  moment when he thought that all his efforts were coming to fruition.</p>

  <p>"Then tell me this," he said. "I understand that on several occasions you
  have been followed by the Man in Black. Have you any idea who he is?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the other, without hesitation; "but what is the value of my
  ideas? I could not swear to any facts, and facts are the meat and drink of
  juries, Mr. Carver."</p>

  <p>Carver got up and sighed heavily, and hearing him, Yeh Ling broke into a
  fit of silent laughter.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," he apologized, "but I am thinking of my favourite poem," his
  eyes twinkled. "You remember the other gentleman who 'rose with a sigh, and
  he said can this be? We are ruined by Chinese cheap labour...'"</p>

  <p>"I shall certainly not 'go for the Heathen Chinee,'" said Carver
  good-humouredly; "not for the moment. What I like about you, Yeh Ling, is
  your refreshing sanity. I don't know that I have ever dealt with a man--shall
  I say fought with a man?--who would have given me greater pleasure to
  fence."</p>

  <p>The Chinaman performed a deep kow-tow, and his mock humility amused Carver
  long after he had left the shadow of the Golden Roof.</p>

  <p>Yeh Ling, who seldom made any personal effort for the comfort of his
  guests, paid particular attention to the preparations which were being made
  in No. 6 that night. The Italian waiters, to whom the proprietor was almost
  unknown, were both nervous and annoyed, for nothing seemed to please Yeh
  Ling. He had the flowers changed half a dozen times. He had new cloths
  brought, and at the last minute insisted upon the table being laid all over
  again. He brought the rarest of glass to adorn the board, unearthed
  unsuspected treasures of chinaware and substituted them for the crockery of
  the restaurant.</p>

  <p>This done, he summoned to his room the maitre d'hotel and the wine chef,
  and chose the dinner with the most exquisite care.</p>

  <p>"Yeh Ling has really done himself proud," said Tab, admiring the
  table.</p>

  <p>The girl nodded. She had hoped that Yeh Ling would have chosen another
  room, but she had no real feeling of repugnance; and besides, she had been
  here since Trasmere's death.</p>

  <p>"It is very thrilling to be dining alone with a young man," she said,
  handing her wrap to the waiter. "And I can only hope the scandal of it
  doesn't get into the newspapers!"</p>

  <p>"Shall we see Yeh Ling?" asked Tab, half way through the dinner.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"He never appears. He has only been in this room twice to my
  recollection."</p>

  <p>"It is our first appearance together in public," said Tab solemnly. "I can
  count on our boys, but if any of those Herald thugs hear and catch a glimpse
  of your expensive ring, there are going to be scare lines in that deplorable
  rag--The Herald has no reticence or decency."</p>

  <p>She laughed softly and looked at the "expensive ring" that glittered and
  sparkled in the light of the shaded lamp.</p>

  <p>"I asked Carver if he would come along after dinner," said Tab, "but he is
  busy. He sent the most flowery and poetical messages to you--really Carver is
  a surprising person; there is a whole world of romance hidden behind that
  somewhat unpleasing exterior, if you will pardon the journalese."</p>

  <p>But if Carver could not come, they had a visitor. There came a tap and the
  door opened slowly.</p>

  <p>"Great Moses!" said Tab, springing up. "How the dickens did you know that
  we were here, Rex?"</p>

  <p>"I spotted you," said Rex Lander reproachfully, "slinking in at the side
  door like two guilty souls! May I offer my congratulations, Miss Ardfern, and
  lay at your feet the fragments of a broken heart?"</p>

  <p>She laughed nervously at his jest.</p>

  <p>"No, I can't stay," said Rex, "I have a party; and, moreover, I am
  entertaining a man with terrific ideas on architecture. Isn't it queer? Now
  that I am no longer arching I have conceived a passion for that unhallowed
  profession! Even old Stott is becoming an admirable personage in my eyes.
  Have you forgiven me, Miss Ardfern?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," she said quietly, "I have forgiven you a very long time
  ago."</p>

  <p>Rex's baby eyes were very kindly, his plump face was wrinkled in a smile
  of amiable reflection.</p>

  <p>"'When a young man's fancy--'" he began, and caught a reflection in the
  mirror.</p>

  <p>From where Tab and the girl sat they could see nothing.</p>

  <p>Rex saw reflected the half-open door and a figure that stood motionless
  outside. He spun round with an exclamation.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch29"
     id="ch29"></a>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

  <p class="first">"GOOD lord, Yeh Ling, you gave me a fright! What a creeping
  old devil you are."</p>

  <p>"I came to see whether the dinner was successful," said Yeh Ling softly.
  His hands were covered in his wide sleeves, a little black skull cap was
  pushed on the back of his head, his shabby silk suit and white-soled slippers
  seemed remarkably out of place in that very modern setting.</p>

  <p>"It was a great success, Yeh Ling," said Tab, "wasn't it?"</p>

  <p>He turned to the girl, and she nodded and her eyes met Yeh Ling's and for
  the fraction of a second held them.</p>

  <p>"I think I'll go," said Rex awkwardly, and gripped the girl's hand again.
  "Good night, old man, you are a lucky old thief."</p>

  <p>He wrung Tab's hand and was gone.</p>

  <p>"Was the wine to your liking?" said Yeh Ling's soft voice.</p>

  <p>"Everything was beautiful," said Ursula,</p>

  <p>There was a touch of colour in her cheeks that had not been there before.
  "Thank you, Yeh Ling, you gave us a wonderful feast. We shall be late for the
  theatre, Tab," she said, getting up hurriedly.</p>

  <p>She was very silent in the car that drove them to the Athenaeum, and Tab
  felt a little of the gloom which had suddenly come into their festivity.</p>

  <p>"Yeh Ling is a creepy sort of fellow, isn't he?" he said.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose he is," was her reply, and that was all she said.</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later she was sitting in a box, intent upon a stage which she
  had once adorned, and seemingly oblivious to everything except the play. Tab
  decided that she was a little temperamental, and loved her for it.</p>

  <p>Going out to smoke between the first two acts (she insisted upon his
  going) he saw Carver standing by a tape machine in the vestibule of the
  theatre. His attention was concentrated on a very prosy account of a yacht
  race which was coming through, but he saw Tab out of the corner of his eye,
  and signalled him.</p>

  <p>"I am going home with you to-night," he said surprisingly. "What time will
  you leave Miss Ardfern?"</p>

  <p>"I am seeing her to her hotel immediately after the show."</p>

  <p>"You are not going to supper anywhere?" asked the other carelessly.</p>

  <p>"No," said Tab; "why do you ask?"</p>

  <p>"Then I will be waiting at the Central Hotel for you. I wish to see you
  about a nephew of mine who wants to become a newspaper reporter. Perhaps you
  can give me a few hints."</p>

  <p>Tab glanced at him suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"I have suspected you of many weaknesses, but never of nepotism!" he said.
  "You told me a few weeks back that you hadn't a relation in the world."</p>

  <p>"I have acquired a nephew since then," said Carver calmly, his eyes still
  upon the tape; "it is a poor kind of detective who can't discover a nephew or
  two. I may fall down on a murderer, but when it comes to unearthing distant
  relations I am at the top of my class. You will find me somewhere in the
  shadows of the Central," he added.</p>

  <p>Tab did not see the detective again until he had left the girl in the
  vestibule of her hotel. Coming out into the street Carver, true to his word,
  appeared from the night and took his arm.</p>

  <p>"We will walk home. You don't take enough exercise," he said. "Lack of
  exercise is bad for the old, but it is fatal for the young."</p>

  <p>"You are very chatty this evening," said Tab; "tell me something about
  your little nephew."</p>

  <p>"I haven't a nephew," said the detective shamelessly, "but I am feeling
  kind of lonely to-night. I have had a very disappointing day, Tab, and I want
  to pour my woes into a sympathetic ear."</p>

  <p>"Faugh!" said Tab.</p>

  <p>Carver showed no inclination to find a sympathetic listener, even when
  they were back at the flat and he had a modest whisky and soda before
  him.</p>

  <p>"The truth is," he said at last, in answer to a direct question, "I have
  reason to believe that I am being most carefully watched."</p>

  <p>"By whom?" asked the startled Tab.</p>

  <p>"By the murderer of Trasmere," said the detective quietly. "It is a
  humiliating confession for a man of my experience and proved courage to make,
  but I am afraid to go home to-night, for I have a large premonition that our
  unknown friend is preparing something particularly startling in the way of
  trouble for me."</p>

  <p>"Then you really want to stay the night here?" said Tab, as the fact
  dawned upon him.</p>

  <p>Carver nodded.</p>

  <p>"Your instinct is marvellously developed," said he. "That is just what I
  want to do, if it is not inconvenient. The fact is, I had not the moral
  courage to ask you before. It isn't very pleasant to admit--"</p>

  <p>"Oh shush!" said Tab scornfully. "You are no more scared of the murderer
  than I am."</p>

  <p>"I am more accessible to him in my own lodgings," said the detective, and
  that sounded fairly true. "If I stayed in an hotel I should be even more
  accessible, so I am going to make use of you, Tab. How do you feel about
  it?"</p>

  <p>"You can bring your belongings and stay here until the case is over,"
  invited Tab. "I don't think that Rex's old bed is made up."</p>

  <p>"I prefer the sofa, anyway. Luxury enfeebles and vitiates a man as it
  enfeebles and vitiates a nation--"</p>

  <p>"If you are going to be oracular, I am retiring to bed," said Tab.</p>

  <p>He went into his room, brought out a rug and a pillow and threw them on to
  the broad settee.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to say," said Carver, as Tab was leaving him for the last time,
  "how surprisingly good you look in evening kit. The difficulties of making a
  reporter look like a gentleman must be almost insuperable, but you have
  succeeded beyond my most sanguine expectations."</p>

  <p>Tab chuckled. "You're indecently humorous to-night," he said.</p>

  <p>He hadn't been in bed five minutes before the light went out in the
  sitting-room. Mr. Carver was apparently settling himself to sleep.</p>

  <p>Tab's dreams were happy, but they were strangely mixed.</p>

  <p>Within five minutes of his head touching the pillow he was carrying Ursula
  through her scented garden and his heart was full of gratitude to providence
  that this great and wonderful prize had come to him. And then in his dream he
  began to feel uncomfortable. Glancing over his shoulder he saw the sinister
  figure of Yeh Ling watching him, and he was in the garden no longer, but on
  the slope of a hill flanked by two huge pillars, and Yeh Ling stood at the
  entrance of his queer house, arrayed in dull gold brocade.</p>

  <p>"Bang...Bang!"</p>

  <p>Two shots in rapid succession.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch30"
     id="ch30"></a>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>

  <p class="first">HE woke with a start. There was a rush of feet in the
  sitting- room, and then--crash.</p>

  <p>He was out of bed in a second and into the sitting-room.</p>

  <p>Carver was nowhere to be seen and he felt by the draught that the door of
  the flat was wide open. He put his hand on the light switch and a voice from
  the darkness said:</p>

  <p>"Don't touch that light!"</p>

  <p>It came from outside the door, and it was Carver who was speaking.</p>

  <p>Below came the thud of the street door closing.</p>

  <p>Carver came hurriedly into the room, passed him, ran to the window and
  looked out.</p>

  <p>"You can put it on now," said Carver. A red weal was slashed across his
  face, and it was bleeding slightly.</p>

  <p>He put up his hand and looked at it.</p>

  <p>"That was a narrow squeak," he said. "Yes, he's gone. I could have taken a
  chance and run downstairs after the door slammed, but even that might have
  been a fake to lure me into the open."</p>

  <p>The whole building was awake now. Tab heard the sound of unlocking doors
  and voices speaking from above and below.</p>

  <p>"It was the cigar that gave me away," said Carver ruefully. "I was a fool
  to smoke. He must have seen the red end in the darkness, and on the whole I
  think he shot pretty accurately."</p>

  <p>There was a small Medici print hanging by the side of the window. The
  glass was shattered. A round bullet-hole showed on the white shoulder of
  Beatrice D'Este.</p>

  <p>Carver fingered the hole carefully.</p>

  <p>"That looks to me like an automatic," he said. "He is getting quite
  modern. The last time he killed a man he used a type of revolver which was
  issued by the Chinese Government to its officers some fifteen years ago. We
  know that from the shape of the bullet," he went on unconcerned. "There is
  somebody at the door, Tab. You had better go and explain we have had another
  attack of burglaritis."</p>

  <p>Tab was gone some ten minutes, disquieting the tenants of the flats. When
  he returned he found Carver examining the track of the second bullet, which
  had struck the lower window sash and which had drilled a neat little
  hole.</p>

  <p>"Probably hit the wall opposite," said Carver, squinting through.</p>

  <p>"The man below found this on the stairs," said Tab.</p>

  <p>It was a small green-handled knife in a lacquered scabbard.</p>

  <p>"Pseudo-Chinese," said Carver. "It may even be the genuine article." He
  pulled out the knife, tested the razor-like edge.</p>

  <p>"And sharp," he added. "I had an idea he didn't mean to use his gun."</p>

  <p>"Now," said Tab, facing the detective squarely, "we will dispense with all
  light and airy persiflage and come down to sober affidavits. You expected
  this attack. That is why you came to-night with your fake story of a
  literary-minded nephew."</p>

  <p>"I did and I didn't," said Carver frankly. "When I told you that the
  attack would be made on me I half believed it, but as I couldn't find an
  excuse for getting you to stay with me, and, moreover, as I have no
  accommodation for a man of your luxurious habits, I decided on the whole I'd
  take a chance by staying here." He looked at his watch. "Two o'clock," he
  said. "He must have come about a quarter of an hour ago, and I will give him
  this credit, that I did not hear the door open.</p>

  <p>"Fortunately there was a clothes hook behind the door, and some time or
  other you hung an old hat there. It was hearing this hat fall that made me
  realize that either I was growing deaf or else the stealthy personage was
  unusually soft-footed.</p>

  <p>"He must have seen first my cigar, and then my outline as I rose, for,
  like a fool, I hadn't pulled the settee away from the window. He was back in
  the lobby in a flash, and before I knew what had happened he had fired twice,
  slammed the door, and gone. He was still in the hall when I went out, but it
  was so dark that I could see nothing."</p>

  <p>"I thought I heard the door first."</p>

  <p>"Because you were asleep," smiled the detective, "and you hear the last
  sound first. No, I will give you a guarantee that he shot at me before he
  shut the door." His eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," he said softly.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"I wonder if your friend has had a duplicate of this attack? Where is he
  staying?"</p>

  <p>"I think we ought to warn him, anyway," said Tab. "Our visitor came in the
  first place to burgle Rex's trunks, and probably he doesn't know that Rex
  isn't staying here. He is at the Pitts Hotel."</p>

  <p>Carver got the telephone directory and discovered the number. It was some
  time before he had an answer, for the clerks at the Pitts Hotel are not
  accustomed to calls at that hour of the morning. Presently he got into touch
  with a porter.</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether he is staying here, but I will find out," said that
  official.</p>

  <p>It was ten minutes before he had made the discovery.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he is in Room 180. Shall I put you through?"</p>

  <p>"If you please," said Carver. He heard the click and dug of the connection
  being made, and after an appreciable delay Rex's sleepy voice answered
  him.</p>

  <p>"Hullo! who is that? What the devil do you want?"</p>

  <p>"I'll talk to him," whispered Tab, and took the receiver from the
  detective's hands.</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Rex?"</p>

  <p>"Hullo! who is that--Tab? What's the idea?"</p>

  <p>"We have had a visitor," said Tab. "You remember I told you about the
  burglar? Well, he came again to-night."</p>

  <p>"The devil he did."</p>

  <p>"In fact, we've turned the old flat into a shooting gallery," said Tab,
  "and Carver wonders whether you have had a similar experience."</p>

  <p>"Not I," was the cheerful reply. "It is as much as a man's life's worth to
  wake me out of my sleep."</p>

  <p>Tab grinned.</p>

  <p>"Keep your door locked."</p>

  <p>"And my telephone receiver off," said the other. "I'll let you know if
  anything happens. Is Carver there?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Tab.</p>

  <p>Carver went to the phone.</p>

  <p>"He wants to speak to you."</p>

  <p>Carver had made a signal, and now he took the receiver in his hand.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry you have been disturbed, Mr. Lander," he said, "but I'd like
  you to know officially that we warn you that an attempt has been made to get
  into this flat at--well, ten minutes ago. What time would that be?"</p>

  <p>"That would be about a quarter to two, I guess," said Rex's voice. "Thank
  you for telling me, Inspector, but I am not at all scared."</p>

  <p>Carver put the receiver on the hook and rubbed his hands.</p>

  <p>"Do you think they will go there? What on earth is amusing you?" asked Tab
  irritably.</p>

  <p>"I am intensely amused, I admit," said Carver, "at the queer, simple, and
  tragic error that our murderer made."</p>

  <p>Early in the morning Carver called at the Pitts Hotel and personally
  interviewed a sleepy-eyed Rex, who sat up in bed in violently striped pyjamas
  and expostulated with commendable mildness upon the interruption to his
  night's sleep.</p>

  <p>"I am one of those people," he said severely, "who require at least twelve
  hours' heavy slumber. Heaven having endowed me with the means whereby I can
  gratify my wishes in this respect, it is a little short of an outrage that
  Tab and you should call me up even to tell me that the flat has been burgled
  again."</p>

  <p>Reporting his interview on his return to the flat, Carver offered a few
  remarks on the vagaries of masculine fashions, particularly in relation to
  pyjamas, and came back at a tangent to the very serious events of the past
  twelve hours.</p>

  <p>"I think you'll be all right to-night," he said. "At any rate I am leaving
  you to your own devices. Bolt the door and put a tripwire between a couple of
  chairs."</p>

  <p>"Oh, nonsense!" said Tab. "He will not come again to-night."</p>

  <p>Carver scratched his chin.</p>

  <p>"What is to-night?"</p>

  <p>"Saturday."</p>

  <p>"The fatal Saturday, eh?" he said. "No, perhaps not. What are you doing
  to-day?"</p>

  <p>"I am driving a friend into the country, or rather she is driving me,"
  said Tab promptly. "It is my week-end off, but I shall be back in town
  to-night."</p>

  <p>Carver nodded.</p>

  <p>"Ring me up the moment you are back. Will you promise that?"</p>

  <p>And Tab laughed.</p>

  <p>"Certainly I will if it is any satisfaction to you."</p>

  <p>"If you don't ring me I shall ring you at intervals throughout the night,"
  threatened Carver. "I have already warned Lander. Above all, Lander must not
  sleep at this flat."</p>

  <p>"Don't you think that by now they will have discovered that he is no
  longer living in the flat?" asked Tab.</p>

  <p>"They may or may not," was the reply, "and"--he hesitated--"I don't think
  I should talk about this to Miss Ardfern. In fact, I would rather you
  didn't."</p>

  <p>Tab had no intention of alarming Ursula, and he could make that promise
  without reservation.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch31"
     id="ch31"></a>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>

  <p class="first">SHE came to Doughty Street and picked him up, and they were
  at Stone Cottage in time for lunch. The weather was still unsettled, but Tab
  had passed the stage where weather made any difference to him.</p>

  <p>Though he did not tell her of his sensational experience, he did mention
  his dream.</p>

  <p>"Ursula," he asked, "you like Yeh Ling, don't you? So do I, as a matter of
  fact, but do you absolutely trust him?"</p>

  <p>She considered before she spoke.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think I do," she said. "He has been a most faithful friend. Think,
  Tab, without my knowledge, all these years he has been watching over me. I
  should be a most ungrateful girl if his loyalty did not move me."</p>

  <p>Tab thought that there might be some other explanation of Yeh Ling's
  devotion, but wisely said nothing.</p>

  <p>"Do you know," she said, "that he keeps a man watching this house day and
  night? I only discovered it by accident when I was engaged in revolver
  shooting. Perhaps Yeh Ling told you that I nearly shot one of his
  sentinels."</p>

  <p>"He is a strange man," admitted Tab, "but my dream rather impressed
  me--"</p>

  <p>"Even the first part of your dream hasn't come true yet," she suggested
  demurely, and he picked her up in his arms there and then.</p>

  <p>Happily the so-easily scandalized Mr. Turner was engaged elsewhere.</p>

  <p>Tab's heart was full of love and gratitude when he left her in the
  sweet-smelling dusk, and mounting his bicycle, which he had brought strapped
  to the back of Ursula's car, started on his leisurely way home.</p>

  <p>Half way he had a puncture which delayed him, and it was nearly ten
  o'clock when he wheeled the machine into the garage where it was
  maintained.</p>

  <p>The last part of the journey was made through a heavy driving rain and he
  was wet through by the time he reached Doughty Street. A hot bath and a
  change of clothing brightened him, and he was filling his cigarette-case
  preparatory to going out to take a meal when he was called to the telephone.
  He expected to be greeted by Carver, but it was Rex who was speaking, and his
  voice was eager and urgent.</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Tab? My boy, I've made the most wonderful discovery!"</p>

  <p>"What is that?" asked Tab, wondering.</p>

  <p>"You are not to breathe a word to Carver, you understand, Tab? This is the
  most extraordinary discovery, Tab!" His voice shook. "I have found out how
  the murder was committed!"</p>

  <p>"The Trasmere murder?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," came the quick reply. "I know how the man got in and out of the
  vault. I was in there this afternoon inspecting the work that has been done,
  and I found it by accident. It is all so simple, Tab, how the key got on to
  the table and...everything. Can you meet me at Mayfield?"</p>

  <p>"At Mayfield?"</p>

  <p>"I'll be waiting outside the door for you. I don't want any of Carver's
  men to see us."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" asked Tab.</p>

  <p>"Because," said Rex's voice deliberately, "Carver is in this murder up to
  his neck!"</p>

  <p>Tab nearly dropped the receiver from his hands.</p>

  <p>"You are mad," he said.</p>

  <p>"Am I? You shall judge for yourself. And Yeh Ling is in it--hurry!"</p>

  <p>Tab ran to the larder and pushed a handful of biscuits into his pocket,
  put on his raincoat, and went out into the vile night, his mind in a state of
  chaos.</p>

  <p>Carver!</p>

  <p>And Yeh Ling was in it too!</p>

  <p>The wind had risen and half a gale swept through the deserted Peak Avenue
  as he strode along to the house of mystery. He did not see Rex until he
  passed through the gate.</p>

  <p>That young man was standing under the shelter of the portico by the door.
  Nearby in the concrete yard Tab saw a car.</p>

  <p>"We'll find our way in the dark. I've got a pocket-lamp," he whispered,
  and Tab stepped into the dark deserted hall, with its fusty scent and its
  strangely oppressive atmosphere of decay and neglect.</p>

  <p>Rex's voice was trembling with excitement.</p>

  <p>"We can put the lights on after we get into the corridor," he said.</p>

  <p>He found his way across the room by the light of the lamp, unlocked the
  door, and led the way into the passage.</p>

  <p>"Shut that door, Tab," he hissed, and when Tab had obeyed he turned on all
  the lights.</p>

  <p>Near to the end of the corridor Tab saw a great heap of bricks and a board
  covered with mortar; the work of bricking up the vault had begun, and the
  first course stretched across the open doorway of the vault.</p>

  <p>Rex stepped over the brickwork and illuminated the empty interior.</p>

  <p>"There!" said Rex triumphantly, and pointed to the table.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" asked Tab, in amazement.</p>

  <p>"Hold both sides of the table and pull."</p>

  <p>"But the table is fixed on to the floor; we noticed that before," said
  Tab.</p>

  <p>"Do as I tell you," said Rex impatiently.</p>

  <p>Tab leant over the table, and gripping both edges, firmly pulled...</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch32"
     id="ch32"></a>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>

  <p class="first">HE awoke to consciousness with a sense of a dull pain at the
  back of his neck and a feeling of restriction. He was sitting against the
  wall, propped up, and when he tried to bring up a hand to rub his aching neck
  he found they would not move.</p>

  <p>He opened his eyes and looked around, and the first thing he noticed was
  that his feet were strapped together. He stared stupidly at the fastening and
  tried to move his hands--but they were in a curious position. He was
  handcuffed behind. To the connecting links a cord had been fastened and
  passed under him to the strap.</p>

  <p>"What--" he began, and heard somebody laugh softly. Looking up he saw Rex.
  That young man was sitting on the edge of the table, smoking.</p>

  <p>"Feel better?" he asked politely.</p>

  <p>"What is the meaning of this, Rex?"</p>

  <p>"It means that, as I promised, you have found the murderer of dear Uncle
  Jesse," said Rex, his baby blue eyes gleaming. "I killed Jesse Trasmere. I
  also killed that drunken beast Brown. I didn't intend killing Brown," he went
  on reflectively. "Unfortunately he left me no alternative. He recognized me
  in the park at the time when I was supposed to be in Naples."</p>

  <p>"Didn't you go abroad?" gasped Tab, the minor deception for the moment
  bulking largely.</p>

  <p>Rex shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I didn't go any farther than the mouth of the river," he said. "I came
  off with the pilot. The cables and wireless messages that I sent were
  despatched by the steward, whom I paid for that purpose. I never left
  town."</p>

  <p>Tab could say nothing.</p>

  <p>"If you had done as I wished," said Rex, with an odd note of reproach in
  his voice, "I should have made you a rich man, Tab; but like the sneaking
  swine you are, you took the woman who was foreordained to be my wife! Your
  beastly lips have touched hers, my goddess!" His voice quavered.</p>

  <p>Tab, staring at him, realized that he was in the presence of a madman.</p>

  <p>"You think I am mad," said Rex, as though he was guessing the other's
  thoughts. "Perhaps I am, but I adore her. I killed Jesse Trasmere because I
  wanted her, could not wait for her, needed the money to possess her."</p>

  <p>In a flash there came to Tab Ursula's words: "I killed Jesse Trasmere. I
  was the indirect cause."</p>

  <p>So she knew! That was the explanation of her strange attitude when Rex had
  come into the room!</p>

  <p>And Yeh Ling knew, and had come soft-footed to the door of the private
  dining-room, ready to leap upon the visitor if he showed any sign of
  hostility. Yeh Ling, the watchful, the soft-footed one, the everlasting
  guardian--in his heart Tab Holland thanked God for Yeh Ling.</p>

  <p>Rex went out of the vault and was gone for five minutes.</p>

  <p>When he came back he was carrying a writing-pad, which he put on the
  table, pulling up a chair and sat down.</p>

  <p>"I am going to give you the scoop of your life, Tab," he said. There was
  no mockery in his voice; it was, if anything, very serious and gentle. "I am
  going to write a full confession of how I killed all three of you."</p>

  <p>Tab said nothing. The whimsical act of the man was in keeping with the
  theory of lunacy. For half an hour he listened to the scratching of a pen and
  the rustle of paper as one by one the sheets were covered, blotted, and
  neatly put aside.</p>

  <p>What was his end to be? Rex would kill him; he had no doubt whatever on
  this score. The man was impervious to appeal, and it was senseless to call
  for help. His voice would never escape the confinement of that underground
  room.</p>

  <p>Carver and he had made an experiment after Trasmere's death. He had stayed
  in the vault and fired a blank cartridge whilst Carver was outside the house
  listening, but no sound had come out.</p>

  <p>Tab looked round for the sign of a weapon, but if Lander had brought one
  it was not visible.</p>

  <p>"There, I've said everything, and here it shall stay on the table, and
  when they find your bones they will know why you died."</p>

  <p>Watching him, Tab saw him sign his name with a flourish, the old flourish,
  which had often amused him.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do, Lander?" he asked quietly, and Lander
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"Have no fear," he said, "I am not going to disfigure your athletic body
  or do you any violence. You are going to stay here and die."</p>

  <p>Tab fixed him with an unwavering glance.</p>

  <p>"You don't suppose--" he began, but thought better of it</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose that your friend Mr. Carver will not come in search of
  you; that was what you were going to say; but believe me, Mr. Carver will
  never find you. In the first place he would not come here, for nobody knows
  that you are here. He didn't even suspect that I was your visitor last
  night."</p>

  <p>"Have you a clock in your room?" said Tab, a light dawning on him.</p>

  <p>The other frowned.</p>

  <p>"In my bedroom, at the hotel?" he was surprised into saying.</p>

  <p>"You haven't!" said Tab triumphantly. "Good old Carver! He asked you the
  time when he was talking on the telephone, didn't he? And you replied. He
  knew you were the man who came into the flat. He knew that when he called you
  up you would be fully dressed and have a watch in your pocket."</p>

  <p>"Oh," said the other blankly, and then: "He came to see me this morning,
  damn him! It was to discover whether there was a clock in the room, eh?" he
  grinned, but there was no humour in those bared teeth. "He doesn't know you
  are here, anyway," he said. "Good-bye, Tab. Do you remember how you tried to
  make a reporter of me, and how I used to sit at the office studying crime?
  Well, I found a new trick in those cuttings, and I have been waiting years to
  put it into practice."</p>

  <p>No other word he spoke, but took something from his pocket: it was a reel
  of stout cotton. Then from his waistcoat he produced a new pin, and with
  great care and solemnity tied the thread to the end of the pin, Tab watching
  him intently.</p>

  <p>And all the time he was working, Rex Lander was humming a little tune, as
  though he were engaged in the most innocent occupation. Presently he stuck
  the point of the pin in the centre of the table, and pulled at it by the
  thread he had fastened.</p>

  <p>Apparently he was satisfied. He unwound a further length of cotton, and
  when he had sufficient he threaded the key upon it, carrying it well outside
  the door. The end he brought back into the vault, pushing it through one of
  the air-holes. Then he closed the door carefully. He had left plenty of slack
  for his purpose and Tab heard the click of the lock as it was fastened, and
  his heart sank. He watched the door fascinated, and saw that Lander was
  pulling the slack of the cotton through the air-hole. Presently the key came
  in sight under the door. Higher and higher came the sagging line of cotton
  and the key rose until it was at the table's level, slid down the taut
  cotton, and came to rest on the table. Tighter drew the strain of the thread,
  and presently the pin came out, passed through the hole in the key, leaving
  it in the exact centre of the table.</p>

  <p>Tab watched the bright pin as it was pulled across the floor and through
  the ventilator.</p>

  <p>That was the secret of the pin!</p>

  <p>The last time the thread must have slipped, or possibly the point of the
  pin had caught in the woodwork of the door and had fallen where he had found
  it. Or the man may have left it in the vault, and it had been left in the
  passage after Trasmere's death to add mystery to mystery.</p>

  <p>"Did you see?" Lander's voice shook with pride. "Simple eh? And
  quick...Tab?"</p>

  <p>Tab did not answer.</p>

  <p>"I am a rotten architect, eh, Tab, but by Jingo, I'm a good bricklayer!
  Have you seen me lay bricks, Tab...? I know so much about it that I fired the
  two workmen to-day, and said I was going to get somebody else to finish the
  job...Tab, I'm finishing it..."</p>

  <p>Tab crossed his hands and tried to snap the connecting links of the cuff,
  but he could not get purchase. He had been so tied that he could hardly move.
  His head was aching terribly, and he knew the cause; one of the first things
  he had seen on recovering consciousness was the sand-bag which Rex Lander had
  used as he was leaning across the table, fooled into believing that some
  secret passage would be revealed when he pulled.</p>

  <p>Rex was singing softly, and mingled with his voice came the click and ring
  of trowel on brick, that scraping sound that bricklayers make, that tap, tap,
  tap of the trowel as it knocked the bricks into place.</p>

  <p>"I shall probably be working all night," Lander interrupted his singing to
  say, talking with his mouth against the ventilator. "I ought to have put the
  light out, but it is too late now."</p>

  <p>"You poor lout," said Tab contemptuously. "You poor cheap lunatic! I can't
  be angry with you, you unspeakable fat man!"</p>

  <p>He heard the quick intake of the other's breath, and knew that he had
  touched him on the raw.</p>

  <p>"Don't you realize," said Tab remorselessly, "that the very first place
  Carver will look will be this vault, and when he finds it bricked up, the
  very first thing he will do will be to tear it down, and all your fine
  explanations will not stop him. And then what will he find? The confession
  which, in your crazy vanity, you have made, and my statement."</p>

  <p>"You'll be dead," howled Lander, and went to work frantically.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch33"
     id="ch33"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>

  <p class="first">TAB'S brain was clearing now; he was taking a cold survey of
  the position. Rex Lander was mad--up to a point. Mad as men of abnormal
  vanity are mad. Vanity inspired the bravado which made him leave in the
  death-room a statement which would surely hang him when it was found. Vanity
  and hurt pride led him to his present dreadful act, even as it had led him to
  search amongst Tab's papers at the flat for Ursula's non-existent love
  letters and to tear and mutilate the portrait of the man who had won her
  love.</p>

  <p>Rex was the burglar. Who else could have found his way unerringly in the
  dark? And Carver had known!</p>

  <p>Madness in relation to crime fascinated Tab. In his younger and more
  confident days he had written a monograph on the subject, which, amidst much
  profitless speculation, had contained one gem of reasoning--the demand for
  corroborative evidence of criminal insanity. "Not evidence of a number of
  acts showing that an accused person is insanely cruel or pursues some one,
  apparently mad, course; but proof that in other relations he is abnormal. It
  is corroboration of homicidal tendencies that a man insists on wearing odd
  boots of a different colour, or that he is in the habit of walking in the
  street without his trousers."</p>

  <p>By this standard Rex was sane.</p>

  <p>So thought Tab with one half of his brain; the other half was taking stock
  of his immediate hope of escape. He was handcuffed behind; around his legs
  was a strap that was beyond the reach of his teeth. Between the links of the
  hand-cuffs and the strap a cord had been fastened and pulled tight, so that
  his knees were doubled up without hope of straightening unless he could
  succeed in breaking the cord. If that were possible, there was the key within
  reach. He made one effort, pulling up his legs still farther and then jerking
  out his feet violently. The pain of it nearly made him faint, tough as he
  was. It seemed as if both his shoulders were dislocated. He could feel the
  cord; it was stout...perhaps with finger and nail he could pick it into
  shreds, fibre by fibre, or cut it with his thumbnail...</p>

  <p>After the wall was up his time would be very short unless the vault
  contained some other ventilator which neither Carver nor he had discovered.
  And yet, even if the cord was broken he must wait until Lander had completed
  his work. It would be fatal, handcuffed as he was, to break out whilst Rex
  was on hand. His only chance was to free himself of the trussing cord whilst
  the work outside was in progress, get the key, and by some contortion unlock
  the door and employ his great strength to push through the newly laid bricks.
  The time would be short...but the cord was unbreakable.</p>

  <p>He rolled over on one side, and bracing his feet against the leg of the
  table and his head against the wall succeeded in getting on to his knees.
  Bound as he was, his eyes were at the level of the table-top. Shelves, steel
  shelves...perhaps there was a rough edge somewhere. He hobbled along on his
  knees and saw a promising place.</p>

  <p>Again he rolled over, this time on his back, raising his feet until, by
  straining, he brought the cord against the shelf. And all the time came the
  ring of the trowel and the crooning song of Rex Lander. He knew at once that
  it was a hopeless proposition. The sharp edge was beneath the shelf, he could
  only reach the upper surface. Crossing his legs to get a better purchase, he
  felt the strap slip upward. By pushing at the strap he brought it to below
  his knees, and he could have yelled his delight, for now the cord was slack
  and he would, he thought, at least be able to stand.</p>

  <p>The sound of amateur bricklaying ceased suddenly, and Rex came to the
  grating.</p>

  <p>"You're wasting your time doing all those funny tricks," he said
  confidently. "I practised that tie all one evening and you'll not get away.
  If you come out you'll be sorry!"</p>

  <p>"Avaunt, fat man!" snarled Tab. "Get to your flesh pots, gross
  feeder!"</p>

  <p>Rex chuckled.</p>

  <p>"Partial to tab lines, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Get out of my sight," said Tab, "you theatrical poseur! All the money you
  have couldn't make you a gentleman--"</p>

  <p>He was interrupted by the torrent of rage which swept down upon him from
  the impotent man outside.</p>

  <p>"I wish I'd killed you," he screamed. "My God, if I could get in--"</p>

  <p>"But you can't," said Tab, "that is why the position is so remarkably free
  from anxiety. Carver knows--don't forget that. Carver will have you on the
  trap--he has promised himself that treat, though I can't see how they'll hang
  a crazy man," he went on. Lander clawed at the steel plate, sobbing in his
  rage.</p>

  <p>"I'm not mad, I'm not mad," he screamed. "I'm sane! Nobody can put me
  away...I'm not mad, Tab; you know I'm not mad."</p>

  <p>"You are just the maddest thing that ever lived," said Tab inflexibly.
  "Thank God I saved Ursula--" the words were hardly out of his lips before he
  regretted them.</p>

  <p>He had turned the mind of the man at the door in the last direction he
  wanted it to go.</p>

  <p>"Ursula...mine! Do you hear, she's mine now..."</p>

  <p>Tab heard the clash of the trowel as it was thrown down and the sound of
  hurrying feet growing fainter.</p>

  <p>Tab wriggled himself to his knees, threw back his weight, and came to his
  feet. It was a terrible strain to support himself, but he was standing,
  doubled up grotesquely, but free to move his feet a few inches at a time. So
  he crept to the table, and leaning over, pulled the key toward him with his
  chin. He brought it carefully to the edge, then gripped the handle in his
  teeth and shuffled to the door. But the lock was set so close to the wall
  that he could not get his head into position to insert the key. He tried
  twice, and then, what he feared happened. The key dropped from his teeth with
  a clang to the floor.</p>

  <p>He was on the point of kneeling when he heard somebody moving about. Rex
  opened the door to the sitting-room and shouted something; what it was, Tab
  could not hear, but there came to him a noise as if somebody was breaking
  sticks. Crack, crack, crack! it went, and then he sniffed. It was a faint
  smell of burning petrol he had detected and he knew that for him the worst
  had happened. Mayfield was on fire.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch34"
     id="ch34"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>

  <p class="first">"No answer," said Exchange.</p>

  <p>Mr. Carver rubbed his nose irritably and glanced up at the clock. Then he
  lifted the instrument again.</p>

  <p>"Give me Hertford 906," he said.</p>

  <p>In five minutes the call was signalled.</p>

  <p>"Miss Ardfern...Carver speaking. I'm very, very sorry...got you out of
  bed, did I...so sorry! What time did Tab leave?...Half-past eight...you don't
  say so? Oh yes, he's all right...gone to the office...oh yes, he does some
  Saturday nights. Don't worry...not at all. Only he promised to call...can't
  trust love-smitten young men, eh...certainly I'd call you if there was
  anything wrong."</p>

  <p>He put the instrument back and looked up at the clock.</p>

  <p>Then he pressed a bell. The sergeant who answered was dressed as if he
  expected to go out into the storm at any moment.</p>

  <p>"Men ready...good. Pitts Hotel; two men to each entrance, one to the upper
  floor, in case he breaks that way. Four good men for his room...men sharp
  enough to dodge his quick-firing batteries...he'll shoot!"</p>

  <p>"Who is the man, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Rex Lander. I want him for murder and forgery; attempted murder and
  burglary. If he's not at home it will be easy...we'll take him as he comes
  into the hotel. One of the night porters is probably being well paid by him.
  He was the fellow who stalled me last night and gave Lander a chance to get
  to his room and use the telephone. So we'd better get there before the room
  clerk goes off duty. And don't forget to impress upon the men that Lander
  will shoot! If the night porter is on duty we'll take him. He's not to get to
  the telephone...beat his head off if he tries. I'll be with you in five
  minutes."</p>

  <p>He made another attempt to get in touch with Tab, but was no more
  successful. Then a thought struck him. He remembered that Tab had told him
  the name of the sporting tenant who occupied the flat below. But Tab had also
  told him that this gentleman was seldom at home. Still, there was a
  chance.</p>

  <p>He waited the receiver at his ear.</p>

  <p>"Is that Mr. Cowling...why, I am sorry to disturb you...I'm Inspector
  Carver, a friend of Holland's, who lives above you. You haven't any idea
  whether he is at home? I've been trying to get him...you've heard the 'phone
  going, have you? Yes, that was me."</p>

  <p>"He came in about an hour ago," said the tenant's voice, "then somebody
  called him. I can hear the 'phone very plainly from my room. Bex or Wex or
  some such name."</p>

  <p>"Rex?" asked the Inspector quickly; "yes, yes...he went out, did
  he?--thank you."</p>

  <p>He sat staring down at his blotting-pad for a minute, then he got up and
  pulled on his raincoat.</p>

  <p>His squad were getting into cabs as he came out of the station, and he
  entered the first of these.</p>

  <p>Had he left it too long? he wondered. The warrant had been issued after he
  had taken the sworn statement of the man Green, formerly butler to Jesse
  Trasmere. He had brought this witness from Australia; had cabled to him the
  very day that Trasmere was found murdered. Green's reply had confirmed his
  suspicions.</p>

  <p>Too late now to regret his delay. Accompanied by his sergeant, he strolled
  into the hotel. The lounge was empty, half the lights had been extinguished,
  and, as he had expected, the room clerk had gone, leaving a stalwart night
  porter in charge.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Lander, sir? No, I don't think he is in. I'll get through to his
  room."</p>

  <p>"Don't touch that telephone!" said the Inspector, "I am an officer of the
  police. Show me to his room."</p>

  <p>The man hesitated the fraction of a second, and then: "If you monkey with
  the switchboard I'll put you where the rats won't bite you," said Carver
  sharply. "Come out of that!"</p>

  <p>The man obeyed sulkily.</p>

  <p>"I've done no wrong," he said; "I was only trying to--"</p>

  <p>"Watch this man," said Carver. "Now give me the key of Lander's room."</p>

  <p>The man took down a key from a hook and threw it on the counter.</p>

  <p>Rex Lander's suite was empty, as Carver had expected.</p>

  <p>"I want a thorough search made of these rooms," he said to the sergeant.
  "I will leave you a man to help you. All stations must be maintained until
  they are withdrawn. He may come in late."</p>

  <p>He waited for half an hour inside the hall, but though there was a
  constant procession of cars and cabs laden with people returning from the
  theatres, there was no sign of Rex Lander.</p>

  <p>The hall porter became informative.</p>

  <p>"I've got a wife and three children. I don't want to get into any trouble.
  What do you want Mr. Lander for?"</p>

  <p>"I'll not tell you," said Carver curtly.</p>

  <p>"If it is anything very serious I know nothing about it," said the porter.
  "I might as well tell you that I did him a favour the other night."</p>

  <p>"Last night, was it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He was in the hall when somebody telephoned through for him, and he
  asked me to keep them waiting whilst he went up to his room. He told me it
  was a lady friend that he wasn't on good terms with. That's all I know about
  it. He is a very nice man," he added in justification.</p>

  <p>"A perfect peach," agreed Carver sardonically. "Well?"</p>

  <p>One of the men he had left to search the room was coming hurriedly across
  the lounge. He drew Carver aside and produced from his pocket a
  long-barrelled revolver of an old-fashioned make.</p>

  <p>"We found this in one of the drawers," he said.</p>

  <p>Carver examined it curiously. The moment he saw it he knew what it was,
  even before he found the Chinese characters engraved on the steel of the
  butt.</p>

  <p>"I thought so," he said. "It is a Chinese issue, the sort they served out
  to their Army officers about twelve years ago. I think you'll find it was the
  property of Trasmere." He snapped it open. It was fully loaded; containing
  four live and two used cartridges. "Keep that carefully apart. Wrap it in
  paper and have it photographed for finger prints," he ordered. "You found
  nothing else?"</p>

  <p>"There's a receipted bill from Burbridge's for a sapphire ring," said the
  man, and Carver smiled faintly. The present which Rex had bought "in Rome"
  for his friend had been purchased within a few miles of Doughty Street and
  was intended to emphasize the fact that Rex was abroad.</p>

  <p>It was nearing twelve o'clock when a 'phone message came through from
  police-headquarters and Carver went to the instrument.</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Mr. Carver...Mayfield is burning...the brigade have just had
  a call."</p>

  <p>Carver dropped the receiver as if it were red-hot and flew to the door. A
  cab had just set down some guests at the hotel and he pushed unceremoniously
  past them.</p>

  <p>"Peak Avenue," he said.</p>

  <p>What a fool not to have thought of Mayfield before! He cursed volubly in
  the darkness of the taxi. And after he knew that Rex Lander had called Tab on
  the 'phone, and that Tab had gone out! Of course, that was where he would
  have taken Tab--to Mayfield. Tab would have gone cheerfully, having no
  suspicion of his friend, and--Carver shuddered.</p>

  <p>He had read only too clearly the significance of the torn photographs. The
  man was insanely jealous; would stop at nothing. With two murders to his
  discredit, a third would be simple.</p>

  <p>Long before he reached Peak Avenue he saw the red glow in the sky, and
  groaned. Amidst that blazing hell Rex Lander had destroyed not only his rival
  but half the evidence of his crime.</p>

  <p>The cab dashed through the police line into the Avenue, crowded now with
  half-dressed inhabitants, and brightly lit by the flames that mounted above
  the doomed house. The roof fell in as he sprang from the cab; a column of
  sparks leapt into the dark sky, and Carver could only stand speechless and
  sorrowful beyond expression.</p>

  <p>Then it was that somebody tapped his elbow, and looking round he saw a man
  in a soaked and bedraggled dressing-gown. At first he did not recognize him,
  for the little man's face was blackened and scorched, his eyes were red and
  wild.</p>

  <p>"My father was a fireman," said Mr. Stott solemnly. "We Stotts are a hard
  bit'n race. Heroes all of us!"</p>

  <p>Carver looked at the man aghast.</p>

  <p>Mr. Stott was very drunk!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch35"
     id="ch35"></a>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>

  <p class="first">ELINE SIMPSON, with a large handkerchief tied round her
  face, turned on her bed and groaned. It was unfortunate for all concerned
  that Eline's bedroom was immediately above that occupied by Mr. John Stott
  and his wife, although Eline's groans had no serious effect upon that
  lady.</p>

  <p>Mr. Stott had reached the stage where he waited with agonized expectancy
  for the next boom of anguish; when it did not come he was frantic, when it
  finally shivered the walls of his room he was maddened. Eline was an
  irregular groaner.</p>

  <p>"Eline goes to-morrow!" he roared, and even Mrs. Stott heard him.</p>

  <p>"She's had her tooth out," said Mrs. Stott sleepily.</p>

  <p>"Go upstairs and tell that girl to get up and walk about...no, no, not to
  walk about, to sit still."</p>

  <p>"M'm," said Mrs. Stott, and sighed happily.</p>

  <p>Mr. Stott glared at her and then came another groan from above. He got out
  of bed and into his dressing-gown--it was really a kimono--and trotted up the
  stairs.</p>

  <p>"Eline!" he called, in a hushed, intense voice, suitable to the hour and
  the occasion.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," pathetically.</p>

  <p>"What the he--why are you making such a...such a hullabaloo?"</p>

  <p>"Oh...my...tooth...does ache, sir!" she wailed jerkily.</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!" said Mr. Stott; "how can it ache when it is at the dentist's?
  Don't be a baby. Get up and take something.. come downstairs...dress yourself
  decently," he warned her.</p>

  <p>He went down into the dining-room and from a secret cupboard produced a
  bottle with a boastful label. Into a tumbler he splashed a very generous
  portion.</p>

  <p>Eline came in a flannel dressing-gown and skirt. She looked scarcely
  human.</p>

  <p>"Drink this," commanded Mr. Stott.</p>

  <p>Eline took the glass timidly and examined it. "I could never drink that,
  sir," she said, awe-stricken.</p>

  <p>"Drink it!" commanded Mr. Stott fiercely; "it is nothing."</p>

  <p>To prove that it was nothing he poured himself out an even more impressive
  quantity and tossed it down. In retaliation, the whisky almost tossed down
  Mr. Stott. At any rate, he staggered under the shock. Fortunately for his
  reputation as a hard and easy drinker Eline was oblivious to everything
  except a sense of complete suffocation, accompanied by a feeling that she had
  swallowed a large ladleful of molten lead. So she did not see Mr. Stott
  gasping like a fish and clutching his throat.</p>

  <p>"Oh, sir...what was it?" she found voice to ask.</p>

  <p>"Whisky," said Mr. Stott, in a strangled voice, "neat whisky! It is
  nothing."</p>

  <p>Eline had never drunk neat whisky before. It seemed to her, as whisky,
  distinctly untidy. It had sharp edges. She could only look upon her employer
  with a new-born respect.</p>

  <p>"It is nothing," said Mr. Stott again. Now that it was all over it seemed,
  at any rate, easy. He was an abstemious man, and in truth had never tasted
  whisky in its undiluted state.</p>

  <p>Bravado had made him do it, but now that it was done he had no
  regrets.</p>

  <p>"How's your tooth?"</p>

  <p>"Fine, sir," said Eline gratefully. She experienced a wonderful sense of
  exhilaration. So did Mr. Stott.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Eline." He pointed grandly to a chair.</p>

  <p>Eline smiled foolishly, and sat.</p>

  <p>"I have always been a very heavy drinker," said Mr. Stott gravely. "My
  father was before me. I am what is known as a three-bottle man."</p>

  <p>He wondered at himself as he spoke. His maligned parent had been a Baptist
  minister.</p>

  <p>"Goodness!'" said Eline impressed; "and there are only two bottles on the
  sideboard!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Stott looked.</p>

  <p>"There is only one, Eline," he said severely, and looked again. "Yes,
  perhaps you're right." He closed first one eye and then the other. "Only
  one," he said.</p>

  <p>"Two," murmured Eline defiantly.</p>

  <p>"We Stotts have always been devil-may-care fellows," said Mr. Stott
  moodily. "Into one scrape and out of another. Hard-drinking, hard-riding,
  hard-living men, the salt of the earth, Eline."</p>

  <p>"There are three bottles!" said Eline, in wonderment.</p>

  <p>"My father fought Kid McGinty for twenty-five rounds." Mr. Stott shook his
  head. "And beat him to...to...a jelly. Hard fighters every one of us. By
  heaven," he said, his pugilistic mood reviving certain memories, "if I had
  laid my hands on that scoun'rel...!"</p>

  <p>He frowned heavily, rose, and walked with long strides into the hall.
  Eline, scenting action, followed. Her strides were not so long, but longer
  than she expected. Mr. Stott was standing on the doorstep, his hands on his
  hips, his legs apart, and he was looking disparagingly at Mayfield.</p>

  <p>"Come any more of your tricks--and look out!" he challenged. "You'll find
  a Stott--"</p>

  <p>Eline clutched his arm frenziedly. "Oh, sir...there's somebody there!"</p>

  <p>Undoubtedly there was somebody there: a light was showing in the front
  room--a red and uncertain light. And then a door closed loudly. "Somebody
  there...?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Stott strode down the steps furiously. Even when he strode down a step
  that wasn't there, he did not lose his poise.</p>

  <p>"Somebody there...?"</p>

  <p>He remembered mistily that the gardener had a lazy habit of leaving his
  spade beneath the trimmed hedge that marked the boundaries of his
  property.</p>

  <p>"You'll catch your death of cold, dear," wailed Eline outrageously.</p>

  <p>But Mr. Stott neither observed the uncalled-for endearment, nor the rain
  that soaked him, nor the wind that flapped his dressing-gown loose. He groped
  for the spade and found it, just as a car came smashing through the frail
  gate of Mayfield.</p>

  <p>"Hi, you sir," shouted Mr. Stott fiercely, "what in hell do you mean,
  sir?"</p>

  <p>He stood in the centre of the road, brandishing his spade--the mudguard of
  the car just missed him.</p>

  <p>Mr. Stott turned and stared after.</p>

  <p>"Disgusting...no lights!" he said.</p>

  <p>But there were lights in Mayfield, white and red and yellow lights, that
  flickered up in long caressing tongues.</p>

  <p>"Fire!" said Mr. Stott thickly.</p>

  <p>He staggered up to the door of Mayfield and brought his spade down upon
  the narrow glass panel with a crash. Putting in his hand, he found the knob
  of the door and fell into the passage.</p>

  <p>"Fire!" boomed Mr. Stott.</p>

  <p>He had an idea that something ought to be done...a feeling that somebody
  should be rescued. The dining-room was blazing at the window end, and by the
  light he saw an open door. Below was a glow of steady illumination.</p>

  <p>"Anybody there?" shouted Mr. Stott.</p>

  <p>And then a shiver ran down his spine, for a distant voice called:</p>

  <p>"Here!"</p>

  <p>"Fire!" yelled Mr. Stott, and stumbled down the steps.</p>

  <p>The voice came from a door,</p>

  <p>"Wait...I'll kick out the key..."</p>

  <p>There was a sound of metallic scraping and something hit the brickwork at
  his feet.</p>

  <p>Mr. Stott frowned at it. A key.</p>

  <p>"Open the door," said the voice urgently.</p>

  <p>Mr. Stott stooped and picked it up, made three shots at the keyhole, and
  at last got it.</p>

  <p>A man, doubled up as if in pain, shuffled out.</p>

  <p>"Unfasten the strap," he commanded.</p>

  <p>"There's a fire," said Mr. Stott impressively.</p>

  <p>"So I observe...quick."</p>

  <p>Stott unbuckled the strap and the man stood up.</p>

  <p>"Get those papers...on the table," said the strange man.</p>

  <p>"I can't touch them, I'm handcuffed behind."</p>

  <p>The rescuer obeyed.</p>

  <p>The passage was thick with smoke, and suddenly all the lights went
  out.</p>

  <p>"Now run!" hissed Tab, and Mr. Stott, still gripping his spade, groped
  forward. At the foot of the steps he paused.</p>

  <p>The heat was fierce, the flames were curling down over the top step.</p>

  <p>"Whack the floor...the carpet with your spade and run...don't worry about
  me!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Stott made a wild rush up the stairs, striking more wildly at the
  floor. The smoke blinded him: he was scorched, he felt his few locks shrivel
  in the heat.</p>

  <p>And then Tab Holland behind pushed him with his shoulder, and it seemed to
  Mr. Stott that he was being thrown into the fiery furnace. He uttered one
  yell and leapt. In a fraction of a second he was in the passage...gasping and
  alive.</p>

  <p>"Outside...!"</p>

  <p>Tab thrust his shoulder again at the dazed man, and Mr. Stott walked out
  into the rain just as the first fire-engine came clanging into the
  street.</p>

  <p>"There is a fire," said Mr. Stott, with satisfaction. "Come and have a
  drink."</p>

  <p>Tab wanted something more than a drink. He saw a running policeman, and
  hailed him.</p>

  <p>"Officer...can you unlock these handcuffs. I'm Holland of The Megaphone.
  Good business!"</p>

  <p>A turn of a key and he was free.</p>

  <p>He stretched his aching arms.</p>

  <p>"Com'n have a drink," urged Mr. Stott, and Tab thought that the suggestion
  was not altogether foolish.</p>

  <p>They came to Mr. Stott's dining-room, to find Eline singing in a high
  falsetto voice, a voice which had aroused even Mrs. Stott, for that good
  lady, in deshabille, was regarding the musical Eline with wonder and shame
  when they arrived.</p>

  <p>The good lady staggered at the appearance of her husband.</p>

  <p>Tab seemed a less notable phenomenon--even the vocal Eline faded from the
  picture.</p>

  <p>"What is the meaning of this?" she asked tearfully.</p>

  <p>"There's been a fire," murmured her husband.</p>

  <p>He glared at Eline fiendishly, and pointed to the door.</p>

  <p>"Shut up, girl! Go to bed! You're fired--you're the secon' fire
  to-night!"</p>

  <p>He was so overcome by his witticism that he relapsed into what promised to
  be continuous laughter. The clang of another engine arrested his merriment,
  and he stalked out of the house.</p>

  <p>"I don't think Mr. Stott is quite well," said Mrs. Stott, in a tremulous
  voice. "I--be quiet, Eline! Singing sacred songs at this hour of the
  morning!"</p>

  <p>And then came Mr. Stott in a hurry, and behind him, Carver.</p>

  <p>"Thank God, my boy...I never expected...!"</p>

  <p>Carver found a difficulty in speaking.</p>

  <p>"I rescued 'm," said Mr. Stott loudly.</p>

  <p>His face was black, what of his dressing-gown was not singed was sodden.
  He flourished the spade. "I rescued 'm," said Mr. Stott, with dignity. "We
  Stotts come of a hard bit'n race. My father was a firem'n--he rescued
  thousan's from burnin'."</p>

  <p>Here he was getting near to the truth, for, as has been before remarked,
  Mr. Stott's father was a Baptist minister.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch36"
     id="ch36"></a>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>

  <p class="first">"WE must warn Miss Ardfern at once. I have been on the
  telephone with her this evening. I was enquiring about you, and the chances
  are that I so thoroughly alarmed her that she is awake. I only hope to God
  she is!" said Carver.</p>

  <p>But whilst it was easy earlier in the evening to get into touch with
  Hertford 906, it was now impossible. The Hertford operator, after the second
  attempt, signalled through that there was an interruption.</p>

  <p>Carver came back to Mr. Stott's dining-room with a grave face. They could
  speak without interruption, because Mrs. Stott and the errant Eline had
  disappeared. Mr. Stott, his hands clasped across his stomach, was fast asleep
  in a chair, a touch of a smile on his lips. Probably he was dreaming of his
  heroic and hard bit'n ancestors.</p>

  <p>"Tab," said Carver, "you know Stone Cottage? Have you any recollection of
  the telephone arrangements? Is it a dead-end connection or is it connected
  from the road?"</p>

  <p>"I think it is from the road," said Tab: "The wire runs by the house and
  the connection crosses the garden. I remember, because Ursula said how
  unsightly it was."</p>

  <p>Carver nodded.</p>

  <p>"Then he's there," he said, "and the wire has been cut. I'll get the
  nearest police station and see what we can do," he said. "In the meantime we
  will find somebody with a car; make a few quick inquiries, Tab."</p>

  <p>Tab's inquiries were particularly fortunate. In the very next house was a
  young man whose joy in life it was to exceed all speeds limits on a sporting
  Spans, and he accepted the commission which would enable him to break the
  laws with the approval of the police, with alacrity and enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>When Tab returned, the Inspector was waiting at the garden gate.</p>

  <p>"Is that the car?" he said. "Our friend knows the way?"</p>

  <p>"I could find it blindfold," said the amateur chauffeur</p>

  <p>It was a wild ride. Even Tab, who treated all speed regulations with
  scorn, admitted that the driver erred on the side of recklessness.</p>

  <p>They spun through driving rain that stung and smarted like needles, that
  fell so fast that the two powerful lamps created fantastic nebulae and halos
  in the darkness ahead. They skidded round greasy corners, thundered along
  narrow roads...once Tab could have sworn he glimpsed a black car drawn up
  under a hedge...they passed before he could be sure.</p>

  <p>The garden gate was open when Tab leapt out from his precarious seat. As
  he came through the gate a dangling wire struck him across the face.</p>

  <p>There was no need to look for evidence of a visitor...the door was open
  wide.</p>

  <p>His heart was beating thunderously as he stood in the quiet hall, where
  the only sound that came to him was the sober ticking of a clock. He struck a
  match and lit one of the candles that he knew Ursula kept ready on a side
  table. By its faint light he saw that a chair in the hall had been overturned
  and lay on the carpet, which had been dragged up as though in a struggle. He
  held on to the wall for support.</p>

  <p>"I'll go alone," he whispered hoarsely, and went up the stairs slowly.
  Every movement required an effort.</p>

  <p>On the landing above a dim night-light burnt. It was a broad landing,
  carpeted with a square blue carpet, and there were two easy-chairs and a
  small table-nest. Ursula had told him she sometimes read there, for there was
  a sky-light overhead which could be opened on hot days. Here, again, the
  carpet was in disorder and on the blue settee--</p>

  <p>He bit his lip to stop the cry that came.</p>

  <p>Blood! A great patch near one end. He touched it frightfully, and looked
  at the tips of his fingers. Blood!</p>

  <p>His knees gave way under him, and he sat down for a second, then with a
  tremendous effort rose again and went to the door of Ursula's room and turned
  the knob.</p>

  <p>Shading the candle with his hands he walked into the room. A figure was
  lying on the bed: the brown hair lay fanlike across the pillow, the face was
  turned away from him, and then...His heart stood still.</p>

  <p>"Who is that?" said a sleepy voice.</p>

  <p>Ursula turned on her elbow, shading her eyes from the light of the
  candle.</p>

  <p>"Ursula!" he breathed.</p>

  <p>"Why--it is Tab!"</p>

  <p>He caught a glitter of steel as she thrust something back under the pillow
  that she had half withdrawn.</p>

  <p>"Tab!" She sat up in bed. "Why, Tab, what is wrong?"</p>

  <p>The candlestick was shaking in his hand, and he put it down on the
  table.</p>

  <p>"What is wrong, dear?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He could not answer; falling to his knees by the bedside he trembled his
  relief into the crook of his arm.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch37"
     id="ch37"></a>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h2>

  <p class="first">REX LANDER was smiling as he drove through the rain, for it
  seemed to him that a great trouble had passed from his mind.</p>

  <p>The solution of all his difficulties had appeared miraculously.</p>

  <p>He did not hurry, the end was sure now, and the woman who had completely
  occupied his mind for four years, whose portraits by the hundred he had
  secretly treasured, whose face he had watched, to whose voice he had listened
  night after night, until she had become an obsession that excluded all other
  thoughts and fancies, was his!</p>

  <p>He had hated his sometime friend since the day Tab had made a mock of his
  adoration. He had loathed him when the incredible fact had been proved beyond
  doubting that Tab had stolen into the girl's heart, and had won her in his
  absence.</p>

  <p>He had planned his life on this supposition. Wealth! The possession of
  great power, the ability to bestow upon the object of his choice all that
  human vanity or human weakness could desire.</p>

  <p>Tab was dead now, he thought complacently, and his confession was ashes.
  He regretted the impulse which had made him write. He had had no intention of
  doing that when he brought Tab to Mayfield, and he was rather puzzled at his
  own stupidity. It was a mad thing to do. Mad? He frowned.</p>

  <p>He was not mad. It was very sane to desire a woman of Ursula Ardfern's
  grace and beauty. It was sane enough to want money, and to go to extremes to
  obtain what he wanted.</p>

  <p>Throughout all the ages men had killed others that their position might be
  enhanced. They were not madmen. And he was not mad. He had a definite plan,
  and madmen do not have definite plans.</p>

  <p>Ursula would this night consent to marry him, and would be glad, if she
  refused, to reconsider her decision. He would be her accepted lover before he
  left the house, and the thought took his breath away.</p>

  <p>"Am I mad?" he asked aloud, as he parked his car in the side turning where
  Carver had almost found it once.</p>

  <p>Madmen did not take such elaborate precautions. Madmen did not remember
  that by some mischance her servant might telephone for the police, nor carry
  in their pockets a weighted cord to throw over the telephone wire and bring
  it down. They did not even buy the cord of such and such a length--so much to
  bind Tab Holland, so much to break the wire--and buy just sufficient for the
  purpose.</p>

  <p>"I am not mad," said Rex Lander, as he went in through the gate.</p>

  <p>The house was in darkness; no lights glowed from the upper window where
  she was sleeping.</p>

  <p>He had made a very careful reconnaissance of the house, and he knew its
  vulnerable points. He opened the casement window of the drawing-room, and had
  stepped softly inside the room before, in ordinary circumstances, a servant
  could have answered his ring at the door.</p>

  <p>He was in her room! Her sitting-room! It held the very charm of her
  presence, and he would have been content to sit here, absorbing the
  atmosphere which she lent to everything she touched, dreaming dreams as he
  had dreamt so often in the night watches at Doughty Street, at his office
  when he should have been working, in the solitary walk home from the theatre
  after he had been listening entranced to her wonderful voice.</p>

  <p>He took from his pocket a large electric-torch and flashed it round. On
  the little cottage piano was a bowl of roses; reverently he drew one out,
  nipped off its stalk, and threaded it tenderly in his button-hole. Her hand
  had placed it there.</p>

  <p>She had taken it from the garden, kissed it perhaps--he bent his head, and
  his lips touched the velvety petals.</p>

  <p>The door was not locked. He was in the hall, the wide flagged hall. In the
  corner was a grandfather's clock that ticked sedately.</p>

  <p>Her room was in the front of the house: he knew he could not miss it, but
  must stand on the landing in an ecstasy of anticipation. He put down his
  torch upon the settee, and mechanically smoothed his hair. Then he tip-toed
  forward.</p>

  <p>His hand was on the knob of the door when an arm came round his neck, a
  lithe sinewy arm that strangled the cry which rose in his throat.</p>

  <p>Such was the man's strength that he lifted his assailant bodily from the
  ground, and, twisting, would have flung him down, but Yeh Ling's leg gripped
  his, and then Rex Lander wrenched his hands free and dived for his pocket.
  Yeh Ling saw the gleam of the automatic.</p>

  <p>"Sorry," he breathed.</p>

  <p>It seemed to Rex Lander that he felt a momentary spasm of pain in his left
  side.</p>

  <p>"You...!" he gurgled. He coughed deeply once, and Yeh Ling eased him down
  to the settee.</p>

  <p>The Chinaman stood, his head bent forward, listening. No sound but the
  "clac-cloc, clac-cloc" from the hall below. He lifted Lander's eyelids and
  touched the ball of the eye gently.</p>

  <p>The man was dead.</p>

  <p>Yeh Ling pulled a blue silk handkerchief from his sleeve and wiped the
  perspiration from his face and eyes, replacing the handkerchief carefully.
  Then, bending down, he brought the limp arm of Lander about his neck, and
  with a jerk lifted him to his shoulder. Slowly, painfully, he passed down the
  stairs with his burden. At the foot of the stairs he was compelled to lay the
  man down. He tried to find a chair, but without success. Sitting on the floor
  by the side of his victim, Yeh Ling recovered his breath, and getting up
  noiselessly opened the door wide.</p>

  <p>Black as the night was there was sufficient light to distinguish objects
  faintly. He could not hoist the man again: he could only drag him across the
  hall. He knocked over a chair in the process, but fortunately it fell on the
  carpet and made no sound. Into the garden, along the paved path, out into the
  road...</p>

  <p>Yeh Ling's breath came in a thin whistle. He had to stop again to recover
  himself. He made another effort to lift the body, and was partially
  successful. He staggered up the road, his knees giving way under him, but his
  will dominated; and when he reached a safe distance from the house he put his
  burden down and went in search of Lander's car. This he found with no
  trouble: it was unlikely that he should fail, for he had seen the man arrive.
  He started the engine and brought the car backward along the road until it
  was level with the Thing. Then he got down and hoisted it into the back of
  the car, lit a cigarette, put on the lights, and drove slowly along the road
  toward Storford.</p>

  <p>Half a mile from where his new house was situated he turned off the
  lights, and covered the remainder of the distance without their assistance.
  Drawing the car up close to a hedge, he gathered the limp figure on his
  shoulder, and tramped across the muddy ground until he came to the uprights
  that supported the cement vats. There was a flicker of lightning on the
  horizon. Yeh Ling could see in that flash (even if he had not known) that no
  progress had been made in the construction of his Pillar of Grateful
  Memories: the tub--like moulds stood in place, the steel core, like an
  attenuated tree-trunk, leaned and swayed in the gale drunkenly.</p>

  <p>After much seeking he found the end of a rope fastened to one of the
  cross-pieces of the platform, and this he tied about the Thing's waist, and
  went to the windlass. A growl of thunder, a more prolonged quiver and splash
  of blue light.</p>

  <p>Looking up, Yeh Ling saw a bundle suspended in mid-air, and took another
  turn of the wheel.</p>

  <p>The wind was blowing fiercely, sending that limp weight at the rope's end
  swaying to and fro, and Yeh Ling peered up, striving to follow its every
  movement. Presently came another flash, and another, and yet another. The
  body had swung over the edge of the mould. Yeh Ling released the primitive
  brake and the body dropped. From his breast pocket he took the torch that he
  had found on the settee and flashed a light up at the wooden mould. Yes, it
  had disappeared.</p>

  <p>There was a ladder against the wooden casing, and he climbed up, found
  another ladder inside, and descended the eight feet which intervened between
  the mould and the top of the hardening concrete beneath. Without loosening
  the rope he dragged the body to its feet, and with quick, strong hands,
  lashed it to the steel core, winding the rope round and round.</p>

  <p>Presently he cut and knotted the binding, and climbed up again to the top
  of the woodwork, looking down in an effort to see the sagging figure. The
  lightning was now incessant, the thunder growing in intensity. He saw, and
  was satisfied. Pulling up the inside ladder, he dropped over, and in a few
  moments was himself back on ground level.</p>

  <p>And now he made a search. He had to find the rope which controlled the
  shoot, and he discovered it at last. Pulling it gingerly, he heard the rush
  of the viscid concrete as it flowed down the shoot into the mould. He pulled
  the sluice gate wider yet, and heard the "swish, swish" of the flood as it
  gained in volume. After a while he released the rope, found a shovel, and
  climbed up the ladder again. The concrete had nearly reached the top of the
  mould. There was no sign of Rex Lander. Plying the tool, he levelled down the
  uneven surface of the cement and descended for the last time.</p>

  <p>The storm was local and passing, but if it had been the most cataclysmic
  disturbance of Nature Yeh Ling would not have noticed. He sat on the
  running-board of Lander's car, wet to the skin, his hands raw and bleeding,
  every bone aching, and he smoked a cigarette and thought. So thinking he
  heard the roar of an on-coming car, and ran to the cover of the hedge. It
  passed in a flash.</p>

  <p>"I cannot afford to wait," said Yeh Ling.</p>

  <p>He got into the car and drove off, avoiding Storford village and taking,
  instead, a road which led by the river. Here he stopped and got out, keeping
  his engine running. With his hands he released the clutch and the car tumbled
  down the bank into the black water. Then Yeh Ling went back for his own
  rattling machine.</p>

  <p>When day was breaking Yeh Ling lay in a hot scented bath in his apartment
  overlooking Reed Street. His hands, free from the water, held a thin
  selection of Browning's poems; he was reading "Pippa Passes."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch38"
     id="ch38"></a>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h2>

  <p class="first">"THERE are blood stains on the stairs," said Carver, "and on
  the garden path outside. There is also the mark of car wheels which have
  evidently been backed from the lane where Lander usually keeps his car, but
  beyond that all trace is lost."</p>

  <p>He looked at Tab and Tab looked at him.</p>

  <p>"What do you think?" asked Tab quietly..</p>

  <p>"I am not putting my thoughts into words," said the inspector; "and I tell
  you honestly, Tab, that I'd rather have that confession of Lander's--wild and
  incoherent as it is--than I'd have Lander himself."</p>

  <p>Dawn was breaking and Ursula had come down to make them coffee, a silent
  but absorbed listener.</p>

  <p>"It is perfectly certain that Lander came here," said Carver. "He
  destroyed the telephone connection, he made an entrance by the window in the
  sitting-room, and he went upstairs. You heard nothing, Miss Ardfern?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing." She shook her head. "I am not a very light sleeper, but I am
  sure if there had been any kind of struggle outside my door I should have
  heard."</p>

  <p>"It all depends on who controlled the struggle," said Carver dryly. "My
  own belief is--however, that is nothing to do with the matter. There is the
  fact that Lander's hat was found in the roadway, Lander came here, his car
  marks are distinguishable, and that Lander himself has gone. Turner heard
  nothing?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," she said. "That isn't remarkable: he sleeps at the back of the
  house, in a room opening from the kitchen. Does the confession tell you
  much?"</p>

  <p>"A whole lot," said Carver emphatically, "and with Tab's explanation as to
  how the key was put back on the table the thing is as clear as daylight. It
  seems that Lander has for years been planning to get his uncle's money, and
  his scheme was hurried when he learnt--probably from the old man's lips when
  he was staying with him--that Trasmere intended leaving his money away from
  the family. Whilst Rex Lander was a guest at Mayfield he must have taken the
  revolver, which was undoubtedly Trasmere's property, and I have an idea that
  he took something else."</p>

  <p>"I can tell you what it was," said Ursula quietly. "He took away with him
  some Mayfield notepaper."</p>

  <p>Tab looked at her in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Why should he do that, Ursula?"</p>

  <p>She did not answer him at once, because here Carver interposed a
  question.</p>

  <p>"How long have you known, Miss Ardfern, that Lander was the murderer of
  Jesse Trasmere?"</p>

  <p>Tab expected her to say that she did not know at all, and that the news
  had come in the nature of a dreadful shock.</p>

  <p>Instead: "I knew he was the murderer the day that Tab told me about the
  will Mr. Trasmere had left."</p>

  <p>"But why?" asked Tab.</p>

  <p>"Because," said Ursula, "Mr. Trasmere could not read or write
  English!"</p>

  <p>The full significance of the simple statement came more quickly to Carver
  than to Tab.</p>

  <p>"I see. I've known the will was a fake all the time," he said, "but I
  thought it was just a forgery, and that Lander had imitated the writing of
  the letters that used to come for him from the old man."</p>

  <p>"They never came from the old man. Mr. Lander wrote them himself," said
  the girl. "I rather think he wrote them with the intention of establishing
  the authenticity of the signature when the will was discovered. He had
  guessed the old gentleman's secret. Mr. Trasmere was very sensitive on the
  point. He used to complain that although he could write and read Chinese
  without any difficulty--in fact I have learnt since that he was scholarly in
  that direction--he could not write two words of English. That is the
  principal explanation as to why he employed me for his secretary, and why he
  must have somebody upon whom he could place the utmost reliance, and on whom
  he had some sort of pull."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to tell me that Rex was writing letters to himself?" asked
  Tab incredulously.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"There is no doubt at all," she said. "When you told me Mr. Trasmere had
  left a will in his own handwriting, I nearly fainted. I knew then just what
  had happened, who was the murderer, and why Mr. Trasmere had been
  murdered."</p>

  <p>Carver rubbed his unshaven chin.</p>

  <p>"I wish I could find Lander," he said, half to himself. "How long did Rex
  have this idea?"</p>

  <p>Tab broke the silence which followed. "For years; ever since--" he
  hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Ever since he first saw me?" said the girl miserably.</p>

  <p>"Before then. There was another lady upon whom he set his heart," replied
  Carver. "Lander, as I say, had to hurry up his scheme when he found that the
  money was going to be left away. He was only waiting his opportunity. The
  plan had been completed to the smallest detail. He had practised with the key
  trick assiduously, and he decided to put the plan into operation on the day
  the murder was committed. He knew that his uncle generally spent his Saturday
  afternoons in the vault, that the doors leading to the vault would be open.
  His first job was to get rid of the servant. By some means he discovered that
  Walters was a crook: I have an idea that there was a time when Lander was an
  industrious student of crime, and I seem to remember somebody telling me that
  he used to spend hours at The Megaphone library and made himself very
  unpopular in consequence."</p>

  <p>Tab nodded.</p>

  <p>"That is where he might have become acquainted with Walters, or Felling,
  though I am not going to dogmatize on the subject. It is sufficient that he
  found that Walters was a convicted thief, and that on the afternoon of the
  murder he sent a telegram (which I have been able to trace) to Walters,
  telling him the police were coming for him at three. &gt;From the moment he
  saw that telegram delivered, and he must have been watching, to the moment
  that Walters left the house, Lander was somewhere handy. As soon as he saw
  the door opened, and Walters came out, he made his appearance. When Walters
  had gone he went into the house, passed down the steps into the passage, and
  found, as he had expected, his uncle working at the table, probably checking
  some money that had come in during the week--a favourite occupation of his.
  Without warning, he shot the old man dead. Then looking round for the key, he
  found that it was not as he had expected, in the lock, but on the chain about
  Trasmere's neck.</p>

  <p>"He broke the chain and took out the key, which was blood-stained. He had
  a pin and thread ready, which he fastened to the centre of the table, put the
  other end through the air-hole after threading the key, pulling the door too,
  locked it, and drew on the slack in exactly the same way as you saw and
  described, Tab.</p>

  <p>"I noticed one little bloodstain near the bottom of the door when I first
  inspected the cell, but could not make head nor tail of it. Nor could I
  understand the appearance of a tiny piece of grit in the ward of the key.
  Both these mysteries have been solved. When the key was back on the table he
  pulled out the pin, removed it from the cotton, which he put back in his
  pocket, and by some mischance dropped the pin in the passageway."</p>

  <p>There was another long pause, and then: "Where is he now?" asked Carver
  irritably.</p>

  <p>The only man who could have supplied him with exact information was at
  that moment sleeping peacefully on a hard and narrow bed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch39"
     id="ch39"></a>CHAPTER XXXIX.</h2>

  <p class="first">YEH LING wrote:</p>

  <p>"Dear Miss Ardfern--I am giving what you call a house-warming on Monday
  next. Will you not come? And please, if you can, will you persuade Mr. Carver
  and Mr. Holland also to be my guests for this festivity?"</p>

  <p>The girl wrote instantly, accepting the invitation, both on her own and
  Tab's behalf.</p>

  <p>"It is a great idea," said the news-editor; "there is a story in that
  house, Tab. Now, boy, see if for once in your young life you can turn in a
  really informative column! There is something gone wrong with your stuff
  lately--the night-editors are complaining bitterly about the slush that finds
  it way into your literary efforts. You are not supposed to refer to the
  Secretary of State as 'darling,' and it is not usual to speak of a judge as
  'beloved.'"</p>

  <p>Tab went very red.</p>

  <p>"Do I do that, Jacques?" he asked conscience-stricken.</p>

  <p>"You do worse than that," said Jacques. "Now...a good story about these
  pillars of Yeh Ling's. Get a touch of the flaming East into your mundane
  exercises, will you?"</p>

  <p>Tab promised faithfully that he would.</p>

  <p>He had the unexpected pleasure of meeting Mr. Stott at the house-warming,
  and introduced that gentleman to Ursula. Mr. Stott had a particular interest
  in Yeh Ling's fabric, for, as he explained some dozen times, he had put in
  the foundations.</p>

  <p>"I owe you a very great deal, Mr. Stott," said Ursula warmly. "Tab--Mr.
  Holland has told me how splendidly brave you were on the night of the
  fire."</p>

  <p>Mr. Stott coughed.</p>

  <p>"There is some talk in town of presenting me with a piece of plate," he
  said deprecatingly; "I have done my best to stop it. I hate a fuss about a
  trifle of that description. The curious thing is, all my family have disliked
  that kind of fuss...Our family has always hated publicity. My father, who was
  perhaps the best minister in the Baptist movement, might have gone into the
  church and become a bishop--in fact, they practically offered him a
  bishopric--he was just the same. I remember..."</p>

  <p>Yeh Ling led them through the house, showing them his art treasures,
  accumulated with some labour and now seeing the light of day for the first
  time.</p>

  <p>Ursula felt very happy, was childishly appreciative and enthusiastic over
  every beautiful little statuette, over every example of the native painters'
  art which Yeh Ling showed her.</p>

  <p>"Yeh Ling," she said, when they were alone for a second, "have you heard
  any news of Mr. Lander?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Do you think he has got away to another country?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I think not," said Yeh Ling.</p>

  <p>"Do you know, Yeh Ling?" she said meaningly.</p>

  <p>"I can only assure you, Miss Ardfern," said Yeh Ling, waving the cool air
  into his face with a beautifully painted fan, "that I have never looked upon
  Mr. Lander's face since the night I saw him at the Golden Roof."</p>

  <p>She was content with this, but--</p>

  <p>"Who was Wellington Brown?" she asked, in a strained voice.</p>

  <p>"Lady," said Yeh Ling gently, "he is dead; it was better that he died so
  than in the way you feared."</p>

  <p>She passed her hand before her eyes and nodded.</p>

  <p>"We Chinese forgive our fathers much," said Yeh Ling, and left her to her
  grief.</p>

  <p>From the house he took his guests to the terrace gardens, and then down
  the broad yellow avenue to the two massive grey pillars that stood guard at
  the entrance of his domain.</p>

  <p>"You had a lot of trouble with these, I am sure," said Stott, casting a
  professional eye upward.</p>

  <p>"With one only," said Yeh Ling, and his fan moved to and fro languidly.
  "With the Pillar of Grateful Memories there was a hitch. Somebody came into
  the ground one night whilst it was raining and let cement into the mould, cut
  off the hauling rope, and did other trivial damage. My builder thought that
  the pillar would not set, but it has."</p>

  <p>He looked up at the smooth face of the concrete, and his eyes rested some
  dozen feet above the ground.</p>

  <p>"I have dedicated this to all who have helped me: to the old man Shi Soh;
  to you, Miss Ardfern...to all gods, Western and Eastern; to all who love and
  are loved."</p>

  <p>When his guests had gone Yeh Ling, in his blue-and-gold satin dress of
  ceremony, came back to the pillar, and there was a little book in his hand.
  His finger was inserted midway. The servant who accompanied him he
  dismissed.</p>

  <p>"I believe," said Yeh Ling, "I shall be happier..." He stood facing the
  pillar, bowed, then opening the book, he began to read in his deep rich
  voice. He was reading the service for the burial of the dead.</p>

  <p>When he had finished he lit three joss sticks which stood in the blue vase
  the servant had carried, and placed them before the pillar, kow-towing
  deeply. Then from his capacious sleeve he produced some strips of gold paper
  suitably inscribed, and these he burnt.</p>

  <p>"I think those are all the gods I know," said Yeh Ling, dusting his
  fingers daintily.</p>
