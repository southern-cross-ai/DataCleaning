<h2><a id="bibnote" name="bibnote"></a>BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTE</h2>

<p class="first"><i>The Brigand</i> is a patchwork of tales from
different sources. Anthony Newton, the Brigand himself, began
his literary existence as "Captain Reggie Hex" in a series of
seven stories that Edgar Wallace wrote under the pseudonym "E.
Graham Smith" for <i>The Sunday Post</i>, Glasgow, Scotland, in
1919.<br></p>

<p><i>The Sunday Post</i> introduced the first story with the
words:</p>

<p class="newspaper"><i>"To-day we commence a series of
remarkable narratives dealing with the exploits of Captain Hex,
a young discharged army officer, who has established a private
detective agency, the object of which is to help the ex-Service
men and their families who are in dire need. Captain Hex goes
about his work in a decidedly novel manner, and devises schemes
for procuring munificent sums from those best able to bear the
financial burden&mdash;even though it is against their
wish."</i></p>

<p>The general title of the series was "The Adventures of
Captain Hex." The titles and dates of publication of the stories
were:</p>

<ol style="margin-left:25%;list-style-type: disc">

<li>"Mr. Montague Flake, the Margarine King, Hands Over £8,000" (Feb 9, 1919);</li>

<li>"The Outwitting of Mr. Theodore Match" (Feb 16, 1919);</li>

<li>"The Foiling of Mr. Harry B. Kingberry" (Feb 23, 1919);</li>

<li>"Mr. Montague Sluis Is Caught Napping&mdash;A Remarkable Deal in Pearls" (Mar 2, 1919);<br>
reprinted as "A Ricochet in Pearls"* in <i>The Edgar Wallace Mystery  Magazine</i>, Feb 1967;</li>

<li>"The Man Who Betrayed Himself" (Mar 9. 1919);</li>

<li>"The Secret of the Hidden Vault" (Mar 16, 1919);<br>
reprinted as "Blackmail with Roses"* in <i>The Edgar Wallace
Mystery Magazine</i>, Sep 1966;</li>

<li>"How Mr. Milson Wren Was Outwitted" (Mar 23, 1919).</li>

</ol>

<p class="footnote">[* In these stories the hero's first name
was changed from "Reggie" to "Michael." In "Blackmail with
Roses" the villain's name was changed from "Bolivski" to
"Boddin."]<br></p>

<p><br>
Re-witten versions of the first two stories&mdash;"Mr.
Montague Flake, the Margarine King, Hands Over £8,000" and "The
Outwitting of Mr. Theodore Match"&mdash; resurface as stories 3
and 4 in <i>The Brigand</i> under the snappier titles "Buried
Treasure" and "A Contribution to Charity."</p>

<p><br>
Other Brigand stories made their first appearance in <i>The
Novel Magazine</i> in 1923 in a series called "The Nerve of Tony
Newton." The titles of the stories in this series were:</p>

<ol style="margin-left:25%;list-style-type: disc">

<li>"The Guest of the Minnows" (Jan 1923);</li>

<p class="first">ANTHONY NEWTON was a soldier at eighteen; at
twenty-eight he was a beggar of favours, a patient waiter in
outer offices, a more or less meek respondent to questionnaires
which bore a remarkable resemblance one to the other.</p>

<p>'What experience have you?'</p>

<p>'What salary would you require?'</p>

<p>There were six other questions, all more or less unimportant,
but all designed to prove that a Public School education and a
record of minor heroisms were poor or no qualification for any
job that produced a living wage and the minimum of interest,
unless the applicant was in a position to deposit fabulous sums
for the purchase of partnerships, secretaryships and
agencies.</p>

<p>And invariably:</p>

<p>'I am afraid, Mr Newton, we haven't a place for you at the
moment, but if you will leave your address, we will communicate
with you just as soon as something comes along.'</p>

<p>Tony Newton struggled through eight years of odd jobs. His
gratuity had been absorbed in a poultry farm which as everybody
knows, is a very simple method of making money. In theory. And
at the end of the eighth year he discussed the situation with
himself and soberly elected for brigandage of a safe and more or
less unobjectionable variety. His final decision was taken on a
certain morning.</p>

<p>Mrs Cranboyle, his landlady, presented a bill and an
ultimatum. The bill was familiar&mdash;the ultimatum, not
altogether unexpected, was both novel and alarming.</p>

<p>He looked at his landlady thoughtfully, and his good-looking
face wore an unaccustomed expression of doubt. As for Mrs
Cranboyle, a solid, stout woman with a flinty eye and a large,
determined chin, she was very definitely beyond any kind of
doubt whatever.</p>

<p>Anthony heaved a sigh, and his gaze wandered from his
landlady's face to the various features of his small and
comfortless room. From the knobbly bed to the 'What is home
without a mother?' (a masterpiece of German lithographic art)
above the bed board, to the 'All we like sheep have gone astray'
above the mantelpiece, to the two china dogs thereon, to the
skimpy little hearth-rug before the polished and fireless grate,
and then back to Mrs Cranboyle.</p>

<p>'You can't expect me to keep you, Mr Newton,' she said
significantly, not for the first time that morning.</p>

<p>'Hush,' said Anthony testily. 'I am thinking.'</p>

<p>Mrs Cranboyle shivered.</p>

<p>'I have worked very hard for all I've got,' she went on, 'and
a young man like you should know better than to impose upon a
widow who doesn't know where her next pound is coming
from&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You've got seven hundred and fifty pounds in Government
Bonds, two hundred and fifty in the Post Office, and a deposit
account at the London and Manchester Bank of nearly five hundred
pounds,' said Anthony calmly, and Mrs Cranboyle gasped.</p>

<p>'What&mdash;how&mdash;' she stammered.</p>

<p>'I was looking through your passbook,' explained Anthony
without shame. 'You left it in the drawing-room one day, and I
spent a very pleasant afternoon examining it.'</p>

<p>For a moment Mrs Cranboyle was incapable of speech.</p>

<p>'Well, you've got a cheek!' she gasped at last. 'And that
settles it! You leave my house to-day.'</p>

<p>'Very good,' said Anthony with a shrug. 'I'll go along and
find other rooms, and I'll send a man for my luggage.'</p>

<p>'Send the six weeks' rent you owe,' said Mrs Cranboyle, 'or
don't trouble to send at all. If you think I'm going to keep a
house open for a gambling, good-for-nothing&mdash;'</p>

<p>Anthony raised his hand with some dignity.</p>

<p>'You are speaking to one of your country's defenders,' he
said, loftily, 'one who has endured the terrific strain of war,
one who, whilst you slept snug in your bed, was dithering
through the snow, the sleet, the slush, the fog and the gunfire.
Always remember that, Mrs Cranboyle. You can't be sufficiently
thankful to men like me.' He glared at her. 'Where would you be
if the Germans had won?'</p>

<p>Mrs Cranboyle was quite incapable of speech. She wanted to
remind him, for the third time, of the manner in which he had
wasted his substance, but he saved her the trouble.</p>

<p>'You tell me I am a gambler,' he said. 'It is true that I
backed Hold Tight for the Sheppey Handicap; how true it is, you,
who spend your spare time in rummaging amongst my papers, know
only too well. Your curiosity will be your ruin.'</p>

<p>He looked out of the window and picked up his hat. Mrs
Cranboyle was incapable of comment. She met his stern gaze with
the stare of a hypnotised rabbit.</p>

<p>'The least you can do for me, Mrs Cranboyle,' he said
sternly, 'is to lend me ten shillings, which will be repaid in
the course of the next few hours.'</p>

<p>The landlady came out of her trance, violently.</p>

<p>'Not ten pence&mdash;not ten farthings!'</p>

<p>'Your country's defender,' murmured Anthony. 'People like you
turn us ex-soldiers into anarchists.'</p>

<p>'If you threaten me, I'll send for the police,' bawled Mrs
Cranboyle.</p>

<p>He walked back to the dressing-table, brushed his hair
carefully, took up his hat again and put it firmly on his
head.</p>

<p>'I will send for my luggage this afternoon,' he said
soberly.</p>

<p>She was muttering incoherent and menacing sounds as he walked
slowly down the stairs; he realised that the crisis of his life
was at hand.</p>

<p>That he was going forth into a hard and unsympathetic world,
with six copper coins in his pocket, and the knowledge that he
had yet to earn his board and his bed, worried Anthony not at
all. He stepped forth into the spring sunlight with a joyous
sense of physical well-being and strolled up the suburban street
with the carefree air of one who has no worries.</p>

<p>An ex-lieutenant in the Blitheshire Fusiliers, ex-secretary
to the veritable Mr Hoad, of Hoad and Evans (Anthony invariably
referred to them as 'Odds and Evens', and cherished no malice in
his heart against the spluttering and apoplectic Mr Hoad, who
had fired him), he knew that the normal sources of income which,
at the best, had produced but a trickling stream, were now dried
up. He had been fighting when he should have been receiving
training and his succession of odd jobs demonstrated the
futility of a public school training and a military career as a
means of acquiring steady or lucrative employment.</p>

<p>And as Anthony swung on to a bus and paid three of those six
remaining coppers of his to the conductor, he had thoroughly
made up his mind that the oyster of life was not to be opened
either by sword or song.</p>

<p>He spent the morning at the National Gallery, which had ever
been a source of inspiration to him, and came out at the hunger
hour, singularly deficient in ideas. He was famished, for he was
healthy and young and his breakfast had consisted of two hard
slices of bread, meagrely buttered and a cup of Mrs Cranboyle's
impossible tea.</p>

<p>A policeman saw him standing about on the corner of Trafalgar
Square and decided, from his air of indecision, that he was a
country or colonial visitor, for Anthony affected soft felt
hats, grey and large-brimmed, and he invariably appeared to be
well dressed. 'Are you looking for something, sir?' asked the
constable.</p>

<p>'I want to know where I can get a good lunch,' said Anthony,
truthfully.</p>

<p>'You ought to go to the Pallaterium. A gentleman told me
yesterday that that was the best place in London.'</p>

<p>'Thank you, constable,' said Anthony gratefully, and to the
Pallaterium he went, for Anthony had faith. He strolled
carelessly into the broad vestibule which was crowded with
people, the majority of whom were waiting either for guests or
hosts, and seated himself in a deep armchair, stretching his
legs luxuriously. And from the swing door of the restaurant came
a fragrant aroma of food. He watched the greetings between
apologetic late arrivals and hypocritical and patient guests; he
saw the little family parties drift in and pass into the gilded
heaven beyond the glass doors, but he saw nobody that he
knew.</p>

<p>Presently four stout people came in, two men and two women.
They were expensively dressed, and they were obviously ladies
and gentlemen who would not lie awake on hard beds that night,
wondering how they might scrounge a good breakfast. He watched
them as they, too, went past into the restaurant, and
sighed.</p>

<p>'Now, if I were only&mdash;' he began, and suddenly an idea
occurred to him.</p>

<p>He waited for another ten minutes then, rising slowly, he
handed his hat to the cloakroom attendant and passed into the
restaurant. He saw the four stout people at a table at the far
end of the long room; next to them was a small unoccupied table.
The elder of the two men looked up at the sight of a very
respectable figure.</p>

<p>'Yes, sir?' he asked.</p>

<p>Anthony bent down and lowered his voice, but it was not so
low that all four members of the party could not hear.</p>

<p>'Lord Rothside says he is awfully sorry he can't come, but
will you lunch with him instead, at Berkeley Square?'</p>

<p>'Eh?' said the staggered recipient of this invitation.</p>

<p>'You are Mr Steiner, aren't you?' said Anthony, in a tone of
apprehension, as though it were beginning to dawn upon him that
he had made a mistake.</p>

<p>'No, sir,' said the fat and smiling Hebrew, 'my name is
Goldheim. I am afraid you've made a mistake.'</p>

<p>Anthony uttered a 'tut' of impatience.</p>

<p>'I'm awfully sorry, but the fact is I have never met Mr
Steiner, and I knew he was lunching here, and&mdash;' He broke
off in confusion.</p>

<p>'No offence, I'm sure,' said the nattered gentleman. 'I don't
know Mr Steiner myself, or I would point him out.' He chuckled
round at his companions. 'I've only been mistaken for a friend
of Lord Rothside's, that's all,' he said, not without
enjoyment.</p>

<p>'I'll wait for him,' smiled Anthony, apologetically. 'I can't
tell you how sorry I am to have interrupted you.'</p>

<p>He sat down at the next table; and when the waiter bustled
up:</p>

<p>'I am not ordering anything, yet,' he said. 'I am expecting a
gentleman.'</p>

<p>At the next table the lunch proceeded and Anthony writhed in
agony. Presently one of the party looked round.</p>

<p>'Mr Steiner hasn't come yet, has he?' he asked
unnecessarily.</p>

<p>Anthony shook his head.</p>

<p>'I'll wait,' he said, 'though it is rather a nuisance. I am
losing my lunch.' There was another interregnum of clattering
knives and forks, and then: 'Won't you join us, Mr&mdash;?'</p>

<p>'Newton is my name,' said Anthony, 'and really, I don't think
it is fair to impose myself upon you.'</p>

<p>But before he had finished the sentence, he was sitting with
them, and in five minutes had given his opinion on an excellent
Niersteiner.</p>

<p>'Are you Lord Rothside's secretary?'</p>

<p>'Not exactly his secretary,' said Anthony, with a little
smile.</p>

<p>He conveyed the impression that the question had been in the
nature of a faux pas, and that the position he occupied was
something infinitely superior to secretaryship. So might
Napoleon have looked if, in the days of the directorate, he had
been asked if he was a member of the Government.</p>

<p>The two women were nice-looking motherly ladies, with that
sense of humour which Anthony was best able to titillate. He set
the table in chuckles as he struggled manfully to overtake them.
By the time the coffee stage was reached he was level: he smoked
one of Mr Goldheim's cigars with the air of a connoisseur.</p>

<p>'It is strange meeting you like this,' said Anthony
reminiscently. 'I shall never forget the first time I dined with
the Duke of Minford. I dropped in most unexpectedly, had never
met him before, never been introduced, didn't know him from
Adam.'</p>

<p>Here, Anthony spoke nothing but the truth, for he had
'dropped in' when His Grace was lying at the bottom of a
shell-hole in France, and they had dined upon a biscuit and a
bar of chocolate.</p>

<p>'You're in the City, I suppose Mr Newton?'</p>

<p>'I'm everywhere,' said Anthony, vaguely. 'I have a place in
the City, of course, but I have only recently returned from
abroad.'</p>

<p>Mr Goldheim smiled at him slyly.</p>

<p>'Made a lot of money, eh?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I've made a lot of money.'</p>

<p>'South Africa?'</p>

<p>It was Anthony's turn to smile, but Anthony smiled
cryptically. It neither admitted nor denied South Africa. It was
a smile which stood as well for the Argentine, Chicago or South
America.</p>

<p>'The truth is, I don't know London very well,' he
admitted.</p>

<p>All the time he was wondering who were the three quiet,
middle-aged men at the next table, who spoke a little, but who
gave him the impression that they were listening intently. The
first time he noticed them, he realised that they had heard
almost every word he had spoken, from his first mention of the
great master of finance; and he felt a momentary discomfort. And
yet they did not appear to be listening. The man with the big
red face, who was nearest to him, seemed utterly absorbed in the
meal he was eating. They might have been prosperous farmers in
London for the day, or successful north country mill owners.</p>

<p>Soon after, Mr Goldheim called for the bill, tipped the
waiter extravagantly (Anthony's palm itched to take back one of
the half-crowns), and the party strolled back into the
vestibule.</p>

<p>Anthony was the first to hand his check to the cloakroom
attendant; and the official accepted Mr Goldheim's tip as for
the whole of the party.</p>

<p>'Can we drop you anywhere?' asked that gentleman.</p>

<p>'If you could put me down at the Ritz-Carlton,' Anthony
hesitated, 'that is, if it is not out of your way.'</p>

<p>It was not out of their way, for the theatre where they were
spending the afternoon was next door to the hotel.</p>

<p>He stood for a moment in the entrance of the hotel waving
farewell to his benefactors and then strolled into the reception
hall.</p>

<p>'I want a bedroom and a sitting-room,' said Anthony.</p>

<p>He had not the slightest intention of going to the Ritz or to
any other hotel; but it seemed such an hotel as a brigand, at
sudden war with society, would choose for his headquarters.</p>

<p>'I will bring my baggage in later,' he said, 'but remember, I
must have a room overlooking The Mall.'</p>

<p>'What name, sir?'</p>

<p>Anthony signed the book with a flourish, and before the
reception clerk could hint gently that rooms could not be
reserved for baggageless visitors without a deposit, Anthony was
enquiring the exact location of the nearest branch of the
Hardware Trust Bank, of New York.</p>

<p>'If you turn to the right when you go out of the entrance,
sir, and then turn to the right again, you will find the Trust
Company on the left,' said the clerk. 'It is customary in
engaging rooms&mdash;' and then came a welcome interruption.</p>

<p>A hand fell on Anthony's shoulder, and he turned to look into
the smiling eyes of a big jovial man, whose tanned face spoke of
an open air life.</p>

<p>'Isn't this Mr Newton?' he asked, wonder and hope in his
voice.</p>

<p>Anthony took a step back, and then thrust out his hand.</p>

<p>'By Jove, I don't know your name, but I remember you so
well.'</p>

<p>'John Frenchan, of Frenchan and Carter. You remember my store
in Cape Town?'</p>

<p>'Remember!' said Anthony ecstatically, and shook the man's
hand. 'As if I could forget it! I can't quite recall where I met
you, but I know your name as well as my own.'</p>

<p>He turned from the desk; the clerk's face bore a look of
resignation. Automatically he placed a room number against Mr
Newton's name; in his private register he wrote 'No baggage. OK?
The question mark against 'OK' was more than justified.</p>

<p>Anthony's new friend led the way to the lounge, where the
coffee and cigar parties were sitting. A waiter came forward
expectantly, and spun a chair.</p>

<p>'You've had your lunch? Join me in a cup of coffee,' said Mr
Frenchan. 'Did you come over by boat?'</p>

<p>'Yes, on the Balmoral Castle,' said Anthony.</p>

<p>In his capacity of secretary to Hoad and Evans, a firm which
conducted an extensive shipping business, he was acquainted not
only with the ships of the Castle line, but knew by repute the
name of Frenchans. They were amongst the biggest agricultural
implement importers at the Cape. Also he was interested in
shipping news, and he had noted the arrival of the mail.</p>

<p>'I thought I recognised you in the restaurant,' nodded Mr
Frenchan; 'In fact I was sure!'</p>

<p>'Huh?' said Anthony. Now he remembered the three men who had
sat at the next table. 'Why, of course! I spotted you and
couldn't place you.'</p>

<p>'I suppose you made a lot of money in South Africa, like the
rest of us?' Mr Frenchan resented his own share of good fortune
if his tone meant anything. 'It's easy enough to make&mdash;I
was happier when I was earning a few pounds a week. Money?
Bah!'</p>

<p>Anthony, who had never had enough money to 'bah!' at, was a
little shocked.</p>

<p>'Yes, I made about forty thousand pounds'&mdash;he shrugged
his shoulders to intimate the absurdity of describing so
insignificant a sum as 'money'. 'But I wasn't in Africa very
long.'</p>

<p>Mr Frenchan looked at him with a new interest. As the
representative of capital, Tony was a possibility&mdash;as a
capitalist, he was a proposition.</p>

<p>'Do you know the Goldheims very well? I saw you were lunching
with them.'</p>

<p>'I don't know them very well,' said Tony, realising that this
was a moment for candour. 'In fact, I met them more or less by
accident.'</p>

<p>'Smart fellow, Goldheim,' meditated the other, examining his
cigar. 'He's in oil&mdash;worth a million. Maybe two
millions.'</p>

<p>'Dear Me!' said Tony, and to make conversation and at the
same time secure a little data, he asked: 'Are you in London for
long?'</p>

<p>'For three or four months,' said the other with a grimace of
dissatisfaction. 'I shouldn't be here at all if my poor foolish
brother hadn't died.'</p>

<p>Anthony wondered whether it was the folly or the poverty of
the departed Mr Frenchan which so ruffled his host. Certainly
one or the other annoyed him, for he was scowling.</p>

<p>'A man has no right,' he exploded suddenly, 'no right
whatever to indulge in eccentric charities. When a man makes a
will he should dispose of his property so that it does not hold
his relatives up to ridicule, contempt or malice.
Envy&mdash;yes. But not contempt.'</p>

<p>Anthony agreed.</p>

<p>The hard faced man was blinking indignantly. The memory of
his brother's folly apparently stirred all that was uncharitable
in his nature. His underlip thrust out aggressively.</p>

<p>'If he wants to leave a thousand to the Stockwell Orphanage,
and a thousand to the London Hospital, and ten thousand to the
Home for Providing Babies with False Teeth, let him do it!
Personally, I never wanted a farthing of his money, neither I
nor my family.'</p>

<p>From which lofty declaration of disinterestedness, Anthony
gathered that the late Mr Frenchan had not left his brother
anything.</p>

<p>'What Church do you attend, Mr Newton?' he asked
unexpectedly, and Anthony, for a moment, was taken aback.</p>

<p>'Primitive Methodist,' he said. If Anthony was attached to
any sect at all, it was towards Primitive Methodism, the church
to which he had been dragged every Sunday morning as a
child.</p>

<p>The effect upon Mr Frenchan was electrical. He sat back in
his chair and stared at the young man for fully a minute.</p>

<p>'Well, that's a most remarkable coincidence,' he said,
slowly. 'You're the first Primitive Methodist I have met in this
country!'</p>

<p>Anthony was more than a little astonished. Primitive
Methodism acquired a new importance. Never had he imagined this
sect of his could provide anything in the nature of a
sensation... Almost his heart warmed to the brick chapel of his
youth.</p>

<p>What particular significance lay in the fact, Mr Frenchan
went on to explain.</p>

<p>'My brother Walter was a bit of a crank. I am not saying that
Primitive Methodism is a cranky kind of religion, but Walter
carried it to an extreme. He employed nearly two thousand hands
in his business, and, if you believe me, sir, nobody had a
chance of a job with Walter unless he was a Primitive Methodist.
It is a fine religion, I daresay; personally I don't know very
much about it. But you might say that Walter lived for the
church, and was so bigoted that he could see no good in any
other kind of worship. Now, I am sure, Mr Newton, that you, as a
man of the world, do not agree that that was an intelligent view
to take?'</p>

<p>Anthony murmured his complete disagreement.</p>

<p>'And because he held these eccentric views,' Mr Frenchan went
on bitterly, 'he has put me to more trouble than anybody else
has ever put me to in my life. I said to my lawyer: "Am I to sit
here in London, year after year, looking out for cases of
poverty amongst Primitive Methodists, in order to carry out the
provisions of Walter's will? I'll be dashed if I do!"'</p>

<p>He grew almost choleric, swallowed the remainder of his
coffee savagely. There was a peculiar glitter in his eyes that
at first alarmed and then encouraged his companion.</p>

<p>'Will you have a liqueur?' he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>Anthony nodded.</p>

<p>'I should like you to meet my lawyer: he is a man after your
own heart, a shrewd man of the world, a little suspicious, but I
don't think that any harm in a lawyer. You probably know the
firm, Whipplewhite, Summers and Soames.'</p>

<p>Anthony nodded. He had never heard of a firm of lawyers
called Whipplewhite, Summers and Soames, but it sounded very
much like a firm of lawyers. He knew there was a firm called
Bennett, Wilson, Moss, Bennett and Wilson, and he had heard of
another firm called Jones, Higgins, Marsh, Walter, Johnson, dark
and Higgins, and he was quite prepared to accept so simple a
thing as a triple alliance.</p>

<p>Mr Frenchan looked at his watch.</p>

<p>'I wonder if I could catch him?' he said. 'You'd be delighted
with him. A dour Scotsman, mind you, but a man with a heart of
gold. He looks upon everybody as a potential criminal.' He
chuckled to himself, and shook his head. 'I don't know that that
is a bad thing in a lawyer,' he reflected.</p>

<p>'It is a very excellent quality, and very much resembles the
attitude of my own solicitor towards humanity,' said Anthony
sedately. 'After all, lawyers are cautious souls, and the first
element of caution is suspicion.'</p>

<p>Mr Frenchan got up.</p>

<p>'Come along. Let us see if we can find him. He is usually to
be run to earth in the neighbourhood of the Law Courts about
this time and I'd like you to meet him.'</p>

<p>The reception clerk, who looked at him with pleading eyes as
he passed, Anthony ignored. It was not desirable that the sordid
question of deposits should be mentioned before his opulent
friend.</p>

<p>Mr Frenchan called a cab, and they drove down the Strand,
halting at the broad entrance of the Royal Courts of
Justice.</p>

<p>'Here he is!' cried Mr Frenchan. 'What a bit of luck!'</p>

<p>A thin, cadaverous man, wearing a worried look and a black
homburg, was standing on the steps of the Courts in a meditative
attitude. He had an expression of profound melancholy and nodded
curtly to Mr Frenchan. It was easy to imagine that he regarded
the world as a sinful place. He reviewed the throng that hurried
past the gates with the basilisk glare of a thwarted
executioner.</p>

<p>'I want you to meet my friend Newton, Whipplewhite,' said
Frenchan, and the lawyer extended a cold hand. 'Can you come
along somewhere? I want to have a talk.'</p>

<p>Mr Whipplewhite shook his sad head.</p>

<p>'I am afraid I can't,' he said shortly. 'I have a case in
Court No. 6 in half an hour.'</p>

<p>'Rubbish!' said Mr Frenchan loudly. 'You've got a counsel or
whatever you call the fellow, haven't you? Come along.'</p>

<p>Still Mr Whipplewhite was reluctant. 'I'd much rather not,'
he said, and looked at his watch. 'I can spare you five minutes,
but I can't go very far from the Court.'</p>

<p>'We'll find a teashop, somewhere; a cup of tea won't hurt us,
eh, Mr Newton?'</p>

<p>Anything to eat or drink would have hurt Anthony very much at
that moment, but he acquiesced, and in a dimly lighted, pokey
little teashop, to which the grumbling Mr Whipplewhite led them,
Anthony's introduction was continued.</p>

<p>'This is a young gentleman I knew very well in South Africa.
Newton &mdash;you've heard me speak of him.'</p>

<p>Anthony was still considerably puzzled. That he was being
mistaken for somebody else, he had no doubt, but he was patient.
The problem of lunch had been settled, dinner seemed a
certainty, although he had less inclination for food than he had
had for a long time. On one matter he was perfectly satisfied;
he would have to produce large and pretentious quantities of
baggage before the sloe-eyed reception clerk would hand him the
key of his suite. That was a fact. Mr Frenchan was a potential
host &mdash;though he would not have guessed it.</p>

<p>'By the way, Frenchan, I've taken probate of your brother's
will. The net personalty is not six hundred and forty thousand,
but five hundred and twelve, six and nine-pence.'</p>

<p>Mr Frenchan made a snarling noise.</p>

<p>'I wish it were six and ninepence,' he said savagely, and the
lawyer grunted impatiently. 'I know you think I'm daft,' Mr
Frenchan went on, 'but Walter and I were very good pals and,
eccentric though his wishes are I intend carrying them out.'</p>

<p>'Why not hand the money over to the church and let them
dispose of it?' suggested the lawyer. 'It is the simplest way,
and will save you a lot of trouble. Besides, they know more
about their own people than you do.'</p>

<p>Mr Frenchan shook his head.</p>

<p>'That would not be carrying out Walter's wishes,' he said
firmly. 'How does the will run? "On the first day of January in
every year, one-fifth of the residue of my estate shall be
placed in the hands of some responsible person for the purpose
of distribution."'</p>

<p>'"On the second of January,"' corrected the lawyer. 'But
you've got the will a little wrong, Mr Frenchan&mdash;it says
that "one fifth of my estate shall immediately&mdash;"'</p>

<p>'Of course, of course. And then the second fifth to be paid
over on the 2nd January; I had forgotten that,' said Mr
Frenchan.</p>

<p>The lawyer leant back and chewed a toothpick, his eyes gazing
into vacancy.</p>

<p>'What I want to know is,' he said slowly, 'where are you
going to find a respectable and responsible person to whom you
can entrust these large sums of money? There is no sense in
beating about the bush, Frenchan. If you're going to undertake
the distribution, all well and good, but how do you know that
this money is not going to pass into the hands of some common
swindler? I know what you are going to say,' he said, raising a
protesting hand, 'that I shall always be around to see that the
money is not being put to an improper use: but I am a very busy
man and I couldn't undertake the responsibility of guaranteeing
that every penny of your brother's money goes to indigent
Primitive Methodists. It is absurd to expect me to do so. What
you want is a substantial man who can be trusted implicitly, who
has money of his own, and some sort of position. In those
circumstances I should say go ahead, but unless you find that
man, my dear Frenchan, you must remain in England for the next
five years &mdash;you may groan, but I am talking practical
common sense&mdash;and undertake the disbursement of the money
yourself.'</p>

<p>'That I cannot do,' said Mr Frenchan, emphatically. 'Besides,
I'm not a Primitive&mdash;by George!' He looked at Anthony.
'This gentleman is a Primitive Methodist.'</p>

<p>'You are not suggesting that you can place this heavy
responsibility upon a young man who is probably making his way
in the world, and either has not the, time or the inclination
towards philanthropic enterprises?'</p>

<p>Anthony listened in silence, wondering... amazed...
comprehending.</p>

<p>'Now, look here, Whipplewhite,' said Frenchan sharply. 'I
can't allow you to speak in any way disparagingly of Mr Newton.
You have known me for many years, and you are aware that my
judgment is never at fault so far as human nature is concerned.
I know Mr Newton's character almost as well as I know
yours.'</p>

<p>'I agree that you are a pretty shrewd judge of men,' said the
other reluctantly, 'but here we are dealing with a fantastic, if
I may say so, a stupid will, the provisions of which can only be
carried out&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Can only be carried out by a man of honour,' said Mr
Frenchan shortly.</p>

<p>The lawyer shook his head.</p>

<p>'Honour is all very well,' he said doggedly, 'but it is money
that counts. If this gentleman has money&mdash;if he can show me
ten thousand pounds&mdash;'</p>

<p>The heart of Anthony Newton was singing a hymn of
thankfulness, but his voice was a little husky when he
spoke.</p>

<p>'If you will step round to my bankers&mdash;' he began, and
then: 'I don't know that I want to undertake such a mission, and
please, Mr Frenchan, do not insist, but if you are in any doubt
as to my financial stability, and if you will come with me to my
bank and see the manager, I have no doubt he will put your mind
at rest.'</p>

<p>'What did I say?' said Mr Frenchan triumphantly. 'Will you
oblige Mr Newton by walking round to his bank?'</p>

<p>'I haven't time to go to any banks,' snarled the lawyer. 'I
told you I had a case.' He rose as he spoke. 'But if Mr Newton
can, between now and this evening, produce five thousand pounds,
and can show me that sum in his possession, then I, as one of
the trustees of your brother's estate, will agree.'</p>

<p>'You are too damned particular,' said Frenchan angrily, 'and
I am not going to ask my friend Newton to do anything so
absurd.'</p>

<p>'Not at all,' said Anthony politely. 'I quite understand Mr
Whipplewhite's objection, and if you will name a time and a
place, I shall be most happy to bring you five thousand pounds,
though of course I am not prepared to hand it over to you.'</p>

<p>'I don't want you to hand it to me,' said Mr Whipplewhite
sharply. 'I merely want to see it.'</p>

<p>Anthony breathed deeply.</p>

<p>'There is just time to get to the bank,' he said. 'Now, where
shall I meet you?'</p>

<p>'Meet me at the Cambrai Restaurant, Regent Street, at
half-past seven. I can't get away before. Will that suit you,
Frenchan?'</p>

<p>'I object to the whole proceeding,' said Mr Frenchan, who
appeared to be considerably ruffled. 'But if Mr Newton in his
generosity agrees to your plan which is to my mind almost as
eccentric as my poor brother's will, it is not for me to
object.'</p>

<p>It was a quarter to three when Anthony hurried from the
coffee house. He could have wished that he might, within view of
his new-found friend, leap upon a taxi and give spectacular
orders, but the truth was that he had not even a bus fare. He
made his way on foot to the park, and strolled along the path
looking for discarded newspapers. He found two, and, discovering
a secluded seat, he sat down and carefully tore the newspapers
into uniform oblong slips, stacking them one after the other
into both sides of his faded wallet until it was swollen.</p>

<p>He was so intent upon his work that he did not notice the
presence of a man who had approached across the grass, and now
stood watching him.</p>

<p>'Making a collection of press cuttings?' asked the voice and
Anthony looked round.</p>

<p>There was no reason for him to doubt the profession of his
interrupter. Anthony nodded cheerfully. 'I am indeed,' he
said.</p>

<p>'What is the idea?' said the man, in a more official
tone.</p>

<p>'Each of these is a ten pound banknote,' said Anthony.</p>

<p>The man sat down on a seat beside him.</p>

<p>'It almost sounds as if you and I were going to get better
acquainted,' he said.</p>

<p>'I admit it. You're an officer from Scotland Yard, aren't
you?'</p>

<p>'I don't know how you guessed it, but you're nearer the truth
than you're ever likely to be.'</p>

<p>'Are there many confidence gangs working in London just
now?'</p>

<p>'There are about four,' said the officer. 'How people get
taken in by them I don't know. Is somebody after you?'</p>

<p>Anthony nodded.</p>

<p>'Then you're a fellow to keep under observation,' said the
detective with amusement.</p>

<p>'For the Lord's sake, don't,' replied Anthony in alarm. 'Tell
me, what is their <i>modus operandi</i>?'</p>

<p>'Come again?' said the detective as a matter of
principle.</p>

<p>'What is their method of working?'</p>

<p>'They've only got one method,' said the other, 'and if you've
met them you ought to know all about them. They are generally
people who have got money to distribute to the poor and needy.
Somebody leaves money for that purpose and they are looking for
an honest, respectable lad without brains to whom they can hand
the money, without fear that he will blue it on champagne and
girls.'</p>

<p>'They are very unoriginal,' smiled Anthony.</p>

<p>'As unoriginal as greed,' said the other, 'and it is the
greed in human nature that they work on. Have they got you for a
sucker?'</p>

<p>Anthony nodded.</p>

<p>'I am a young man from South Africa with great possessions,'
he said, simply. 'This evening I am going to show them five
thousand pounds in order to prove my bona fides.'</p>

<p>The detective glanced at the pocket book.</p>

<p>'Sic 'em!' he said, preparing to go. 'And if they give you
any trouble afterwards, here's my card.'</p>

<p>At half past seven that night, Anthony kept his appointment.
He found the lawyer already waiting for him, reading the evening
newspaper, a small glass of absinthe before him.</p>

<p>'A pernicious drink, Mr Newton,' he said, 'but I find it is
very beneficial. I suffer from indigestion. I suppose you
haven't seen Mr Frenchan?'</p>

<p>Anthony shook his head.</p>

<p>'A strange man, a very trusting man, and how he ever keeps
out of scrapes heaven only knows,' said the lawyer in despair.
'He would trust anybody. He would trust a tramp in the street. I
hope, Mr Newton, that you are not feeling very sore with me, but
a lawyer has to be a little inhuman.'</p>

<p>'That I understand,' said Anthony heartily, and at that
moment Frenchan came in.</p>

<p>They talked for a while on an item of news which was being
advertised on all newspaper bills and placards, and then Mr
Frenchan, with a sigh, said: 'Well, let us to business, and get
it over.'</p>

<p>He produced a heavy wallet and took out a wad of notes.</p>

<p>'What on earth did you bring that for?' asked the lawyer.</p>

<p>'Because,' said Mr Frenchan emphatically, 'I thought if you
could not trust Mr Newton, there was no reason why Mr Newton
should trust us. I do trust Mr Newton, I trust him
implicitly.'</p>

<p>'Don't raise your voice,' said the lawyer. 'There is no need
to make a disturbance.'</p>

<p>'And Mr Newton trusts me.'</p>

<p>'Have you brought the money?' asked the lawyer
practically.</p>

<p>Anthony produced his heavy wallet.</p>

<p>'What did I tell you?' said Frenchan, for the second time
that day. 'A man of substance and a man of honour, Whipplewhite.
Will you do me a favour?'</p>

<p>He leant across the table and spoke earnestly to Anthony.</p>

<p>'Certainly, Mr Frenchan.'</p>

<p>Mr Frenchan tossed his wallet into Anthony's lap.</p>

<p>Take that wallet and go outside for five minutes, and then
return,'</p>

<p>'But why?' asked Anthony, raising his eyebrows.</p>

<p>'To show that I trust you. And I daresay you would do the
same for me?'</p>

<p>'Most certainly I would,' said Anthony.</p>

<p>He picked up the wallet.</p>

<p>'But there is a lot of money here, isn't there? I wish you
would count it.'</p>

<p>'There is no necessity to count it,' said the other, loftily.
Nevertheless, he pulled open the flap and took out a wad of
notes. He turned over the first batch of notes and Anthony saw
that they were each for ten pounds. Beneath were sham 'Bank of
Engraving' notes, he guessed, but those on top were genuine
enough.</p>

<p>'I don't like doing it,' he said, as he took the wallet from
the other. 'After all, you don't know me.'</p>

<p>'I think I should accede to Mr Frenchan's rather remarkable
request,' said the lawyer gently, and Anthony slipped the case
into his pocket, and went slowly from the restaurant. A taxi cab
was passing.</p>

<p>'Don't stop,' he said, as he ran up to the slowing vehicle.
'Drive me to Victoria.'</p>

<p>As the cab flashed through the darkening streets, he took the
wallet and extracted its contents. The twenty top notes were
gloriously genuine.</p>

<p>In the restaurant Mr Whipplewhite and Frenchan waited.</p>

<p>'A bright kid,' said Mr Frenchan.</p>

<p>'Ain't they all bright?' said the other contemptuously.
'Ain't they all clever? It is only the clever ones that fall.
Hullo!' He looked up with a start to meet the eyes of a
soldierly looking man.</p>

<p>'Hullo, Dan, waiting for a mug?'</p>

<p>'I don't know what you mean, sergeant,' said Frenchan. 'We
are waiting for a friend of ours.'</p>

<p>'You'll wait a long time, that's my opinion,' said Sergeant
Maud, of Scotland Yard. 'I have been watching that lad all the
afternoon.'</p>

<p>He clicked his teeth cheerfully, and viewed with great joy
the consternation and horror that was dawning on the faces of
his victims.</p>

<p>'It is occasions like these, Dan, that make all the policemen
in heaven rise up and sing hallelujah,' he added.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="story2" id="story2">II. &mdash; ON GETTING AN
INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

<p class="first">POLITE brigandage has its novel aspects and its
moments of fascination. Vulgar men, crudely furnished in the
matter of ideas, may find profit in violence, but the more
subtle and the more delicate nuances of the art of gentle
robbery had an especial attraction for one who, in fulfilment of
the poet's ambition, could count the game before the prize.</p>

<p>So it came about that Mr Newton found himself in an awkward
situation. The two near wheels of his car were in a ditch; he
with some difficulty had maintained himself at the steering
wheel, though the branches of the overhanging hedge were so
close to him that he had to twist is head on one side.
Nevertheless, he maintained an attitude of supreme dignity as he
climbed out of his car, and the eyes that met the girl's alarmed
gaze were full of gentle reproach.</p>

<p>She sat bolt upright at the wheel of her beautiful Daimler,
and for a while was speechless.</p>

<p>'You were on the wrong side of the road,' said Tony
gently.</p>

<p>'I'm awfully sorry,' she gasped. 'I sounded my horn, but
these wretched Sussex lanes are so blind...'</p>

<p>'Say no more about it,' said Anthony. He surveyed the ruins
of his car gravely.</p>

<p>'I thought you would see me as you came down the hill,' she
said in excuse. 'I saw you and I sounded my horn.'</p>

<p>'I didn't hear it,' said Anthony, 'but that is beside the
question. The fault is entirely mine, but I fear my poor car is
completely ruined.'</p>

<p>She got out and stood beside him, the figure of penitence,
her eyes fixed upon the drunken wreck.</p>

<p>'If I had not turned immediately into the ditch,' said
Anthony, 'there would have been a collision. And it is better
that I should ruin my car than I should occasion you the
slightest apprehension.'</p>

<p>She drew a quick sigh.</p>

<p>'Thank goodness it is only an old car,' she said. 'Of course,
Daddy will&mdash;'</p>

<p>Anthony could not allow the statement to pass
unchallenged.</p>

<p>'It looks old now,' he said gently; 'it looks even decrepit.
It has all the appearance of ruin which old age, alas, brings,
but it is not an old car.'</p>

<p>'It is an old model,' she insisted. 'Why, that's about twenty
years old&mdash;I can tell from the shape of the wing.'</p>

<p>'The wings of my car,' said Anthony, 'may be old fashioned. I
am an old fashioned man, and I like old fashioned wings. In
fact, I insisted upon having those old fashioned wings put on
this perfectly new car. You have only to look at the beautiful
coach work&mdash;the lacquer&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You lacquered it yourself,' she accused him. 'Anybody can
see that that has been newly done.' She touched the paint with
her finger, and it left a little black stain. 'There,' she said
triumphantly, 'It has been done with "Binko", you can see the
advertisements in all the papers: "Binko dries in two hours."'
She touched the paint again and looked at the second stain on
her finger. 'That means you painted it a fortnight ago,' she
said, 'it always takes a month to dry.'</p>

<p>Anthony said nothing. He felt that her discovery called for
silence. Moreover, he could not, for the moment, think of any
appropriate rejoinder.</p>

<p>'Of course,' she went on more warmly, 'it was very fine of
you to take such a dreadful risk. My father, I know, will be
very grateful.'</p>

<p>She looked at the car again.</p>

<p>'You don't think you could get it up,' she said.</p>

<p>Anthony was very sure he could not restore the equilibrium of
his car. He had bought it a week before for thirty pounds. The
owner had stuck out for thirty-five, and Anthony had tossed him
thirty pounds or forty, and had won. Anthony always won those
tosses. He kept a halfpenny in his pocket which had a tail on
each side, and since ninety-nine people out of a hundred say
'heads' when you flip a coin in the air, it was money for
nothing.</p>

<p>'Shall I drive you into Pilbury?' she said.</p>

<p>'Is there anywhere I can find a telephone?' asked
Anthony.</p>

<p>'I'll take you back to the house,' said Jane Mansar suddenly.
'It's quite near, you can telephone from there, and I'd like you
to have a talk with father. Of course, we will not allow you to
lose by your unselfish action, though I did sound my horn as I
came round the corner.'</p>

<p>'I didn't hear it,' said Anthony gravely.</p>

<p>He climbed in, and she backed the car into a gateway, turned
and sped at a reckless pace back the way she had come. She
turned violently from the road, missed one of the lodge gates by
a fraction of an inch and accelerated up a broad drive to a big
white house that showed sketchily between the encircling elms.
She braked suddenly and Anthony got out with relief.</p>

<p>Mr Gerald Mansar was a stout, bald man, whose fiery
countenance was relieved by a pure white moustache and bristling
white eyebrows. He listened with thunderous calm whilst his
pretty daughter told the story of her narrow escape.</p>

<p>'You sounded your horn?' he insisted.</p>

<p>'Yes, father, I am sure I sounded the horn.'</p>

<p>'And you were going, of course, at a reasonable pace,' said
Mr Mansar.</p>

<p>In his early days he had had some practice at the law in the
County Courts. Anthony Newton recognised the style and felt it
was an appropriate moment to step in.</p>

<p>'You quite understand, Mr Mansar, that I completely exonerate
Miss Mansar from any responsibility,' he interjected. 'I am
perfectly sure she sounded the horn, though I did not hear it. I
am completely satisfied and can vouch for the fact that she was
proceeding at a very leisurely pace, and whatever fault there
was, was mine.'</p>

<p>Anthony Newton was a very keen student of men, particularly
of rich men. He had studied them from many angles, and one of
the first lessons he learnt in presenting a claim, was to
exonerate these gentlemen from any legal responsibility. The
rich hate and loathe the onus of legal responsibility. They will
spend extravagant sums in law costs to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of themselves and the world that they are not
legally responsible for the payment of a boot-black's fee. The
joy of wealth is generosity. There was never a millionaire born
who would not prefer to give a thousand than to pay a disputed
penny.</p>

<p>Mr Mansar's puckered face relaxed.</p>

<p>'I shall certainly not allow you to be the loser,
Mr&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Newton is my name.'</p>

<p>'Newton. You are not in the firm of Newton, Boyd and Wilkins,
are you, the rubber people?'</p>

<p>'No,' said Anthony. 'I never touch rubber.'</p>

<p>'You are not the pottery Newton, are you?' asked Mr Mansar
hopefully.</p>

<p>'No,' said Anthony gravely, 'we have always kept clear of
pots.'</p>

<p>After Mr Mansar had, by cross-examination, discovered that he
wasn't one of the Warwickshire Newtons, or Monmouth Newtons, or
a MacNewton of Ayr, or one of those Irish Newtons, or a Newton
of Newton Abbot, but was just an ordinary London Newton, his
interest momentarily relaxed.</p>

<p>'Well, my dear,' he said, 'what shall we do?'</p>

<p>The girl smiled.</p>

<p>'I think at least we ought to ask Mr Newton to lunch,' she
said and the old man, who seemed at a loss as to how the
proceedings might reasonably be terminated or developed,
brightened up at the suggestion.</p>

<p>'I noticed that you mentioned me by name. Of course, my
daughter told you&mdash;' he said.</p>

<p>Anthony smiled.</p>

<p>'No, sir,' he replied, 'but I know the city rather well and,
of course, your residence in this part of the world is as well
known as&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Naturally,' said Mr Gerald Mansar. He had no false ideas as
to his fame. The man who had engineered the Nigerian oil boom,
the Irish linen boom, who floated the Milwaukee paper syndicate
for two millions, could have no illusions about his
obscurity.</p>

<p>'You are in the city yourself, Mr Newton?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' admitted Anthony.</p>

<p>He was in the city to the extent of hiring an office on a
first floor of a city building; and it was true he had his name
painted on the door. It was an office not big enough to swing a
cat, as one of his acquaintances had pointed out. Anthony
however, did not keep cats. And if he had kept them, he would
certainly have never been guilty of such cruelty.</p>

<p>The lunch was not an unpleasant function, for a quite
unexpected factor had come into his great scheme. Nobody knew
better than Anthony Newton that it was Mr Mansar himself who
every Saturday morning drove the Daimler into Pullington, and
when Anthony had purchased his racketty car, spending many hours
in the application of 'Binko' to endow it with a more youthful
complexion, he had not dreamt that the adventure would end so
pleasantly. He knew that Mr Millionaire Mansar had a
daughter&mdash;he had a vague idea that somebody had told him
she was pretty. He did not anticipate when he engineered his
accident so carefully, that it would be at her expense.</p>

<p>For, whatever else he was, Anthony Newton was an honest
adventurer. He had decided that there was money in honest
adventure; he had reached this conclusion after he had made a
careful study of the press. There were other adventurers whose
names figured conspicuously in the police court reports. They
were all ingenious and painstaking men, but their ingenuity and
foresight were employed in ways which made no appeal to one who
had strict, but not too strict, views on the sacredness of
property.</p>

<p>Some of these adventurers had walked into isolated post
offices, a mask over their faces and a revolver in their hands
and had carried off the contents of the till, amidst the loud
protests of postal officials who were on the spot. Others had
walked into banks similarly disguised and had drawn out balances
which were certainly not due to them.</p>

<p>And Anthony, thinking out the matter, decided that it was
quite possible, by the exercise of his mental talent, to secure
quite a lot of money without taking the slightest risks.</p>

<p>He wished to know Mr Mansar. Mr Mansar, in ordinary
circumstances, was unapproachable. To step into his office and
demand an interview was almost as futile as stepping up to the
stamp counter in St Martin's-le-Grand, and asking to see the
Postmaster-General. Mr Mansar was surrounded by guards, inner
and outer, by secretaries, by heads of departments, by general
managers and managing directors, to say nothing of
commissionaires, doorkeepers, messengers and plain clerks.</p>

<p>There are two ways of getting acquainted with the great. One
is to discover their hobbies, which is the weakest side of their
defence, and the other is to drop in upon them on their
holidays. The man you cannot meet in the City of London is very
accessible in the Hotel de la Paix.</p>

<p>But apparently Mr Mansar never took a holiday, and his only
hobby was keeping alive an illusion of his profound genius.</p>

<p>Lunch over, and Anthony's object achieved, there seemed no
excuse for his lingering. He awaited, with some confidence, the
grave intimation that a car was ready to take him to the
station, and that Mr Mansar would be glad if he would dine with
him at his London house on Thursday. Maybe it would be
Wednesday. Possibly, thought Anthony, the function might be
deferred for a week or two. But the intimation did not come. He
was treated as though he had arrived for a permanent stay.</p>

<p>Mr Mansar showed him the library, and told him to make
himself comfortable, pointing out certain books which had amused
him (Mr Mansar) in his moments of leisure.</p>

<p>Anthony Newton cooed and settled himself, not perhaps to
read, but to think large and beautiful thoughts of great
financial coups which he might engineer with this prince of
financiers, of partnerships maybe, certainly of profits.</p>

<p>There was a big window looking out upon a marble terrace and
as he read, or pretended to read, Mr and Miss Mansar paced
restlessly along the paved walk. They were talking in a low
voice and Anthony, having surrendered all sense of decorum,
crept nearer to the window and listened as they passed.</p>

<p>'He is much better looking than the last one,' murmured Jane,
and he saw Mr Mansar nod.</p>

<p>Much better looking than the last one? Anthony scratched his
head.</p>

<p>Presently they came back.</p>

<p>'He has a very clever face,' said Jane, and Mr Mansar
grunted.</p>

<p>Anthony had not the slightest doubt as to whom they were
talking about. When she said 'clever face' he knew it was
himself.</p>

<p>They did not return again, and Anthony waited on, a little
impatient, a little curious; he had decided that he himself
would make a move to go, when Mr Mansar came into the library
and carefully closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>'I want a little talk with you, Mr Newton,' he said solemnly.
'It has occurred to me that you might be of the very greatest
service to my firm.'</p>

<p>Anthony cleared his throat. The same thought had occurred to
him also.</p>

<p>'Do you know Brussels at all?'</p>

<p>'Intimately,' said Anthony promptly. He had never been to
Brussels, but he knew that he could get a working knowledge of
the city from any guide book.</p>

<p>Mr Mansar stroked his chin, pursed his lips, frowned, and
then:</p>

<p>'It is providential your arriving,' he said. 'I have a very
confidential mission which I have been looking for somebody to
undertake. In fact, I thought of going to town this afternoon to
find a man for the purpose but, as I say, your arrival has been
miraculously providential. I have been discussing it with my
daughter, I hope you will forgive that little impertinence,' he
said, courteously.</p>

<p>Anthony Newton forgave him there and then.</p>

<p>'My daughter, who is a judge of character, is rather
impressed by you.'</p>

<p>It was clear to Anthony now that he had been the subject of
the conversation he had overheard. He was tingling with
curiosity to discover exactly the nature of the mission which
was to be entrusted to him. Mr Mansar did not keep him waiting
long.</p>

<p>'I want you to go by to-night's train to Brussels. You will
arrive on Sunday morning, and remain there until Wednesday
morning. Have you sufficient money for your journey?'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes,' said Anthony, airily.</p>

<p>'Good.' Mr Mansar nodded gravely, as though he had never had
any doubt upon the matter. 'You will carry with you a sealed
envelope, which you will open on Wednesday morning in the
presence of my Brussels agent, Monsieur Lament, of the firm of
Lament and Lament, the great financiers, of whom you must have
heard.'</p>

<p>'Naturally,' said Anthony.</p>

<p>'I want you to keep your mission a secret, tell nobody, you
understand?'</p>

<p>Anthony understood perfectly.</p>

<p>'I leave the method of travel to you. There is a train to
London in half an hour; here is the letter.'</p>

<p>He took it from his inside pocket. It was addressed to Mr
Anthony Newton, and marked 'To be opened in the presence of
Monsieur Cecil Lament, 119, Rue Partriele, Brussels.'</p>

<p>T do not promise you that you will be paid very well or even
be paid at all, for undertaking this mission,' said the
millionaire. 'But I rather fancy this experience will be useful
to you in more ways than one.'</p>

<p>Anthony detected a certain significance in this cautious
promise and smiled happily.</p>

<p>'I think I'll go along now, sir,' he said briskly. 'When I
carry out these missions&mdash;and as you may guess, this is not
the first time that I have been&mdash;entrusted with important
errands&mdash;I prefer that I should lose no time.'</p>

<p>'I think you're wise,' said Mr Mansar soberly.</p>

<p>Anthony hoped to see the girl before he went, but here he was
disappointed. It was a very ordinary chauffeur who drove him to
the station and, passing the wreckage of his car stranded in the
ditch, Anthony did not regret one single penny of his
expenditure. Anyway, the car would still sell for the price of
old iron.</p>

<p>He reached Brussels in time for breakfast on Sunday morning,
and on the Monday he made a call at Monsieur Lament's office.
Monsieur Lament was a short, stout man, with a large and bushy
beard, and seemed surprised at the advent of this spruce and
mysterious young Englishman.</p>

<p>'From M'sieur Mansar,' he said with respect, even veneration.
'M'sieur Mansar did not tell me he was sending anybody. Is it in
connection with the Rentes?'</p>

<p>'I am not at liberty to say,' said Anthony discreetly, 'In
fact, sir, I am, so to speak, under sealed orders.'</p>

<p>Monsieur Lament heard the explanation and nodded.</p>

<p>'I honour your discretion, M'sieur,' he said. 'Now is there
anything I can do for you while you are in Brussels? Perhaps you
would dine with me to-night at my club.'</p>

<p>Anthony was very happy to dine with him at his club, because
he had brought with him a grossly insufficient sum to pay his
expenses.</p>

<p>Over the dinner that nigh, Monsieur Lament spoke reverently
of the great English financier.</p>

<p>'What a wonderful man?' he said, with an expressive gesture.
'You are a friend of his, M'sieur Newton?'</p>

<p>'Not exactly a friend,' said Anthony carefully, 'how can one
be a friend of a monument? One can only stand at a distance and
admire.'</p>

<p>'True, true,' said the thoughtful Monsieur Lament. 'He is
indeed, a remarkable character. And his daughter&mdash;' he
kissed the tips of his fingers, 'what charm, what intelligence,
what beauty!'</p>

<p>'Ah!' said Anthony, 'what!'</p>

<p>So charming a companion was he, that Monsieur Lament asked
him to lunch with him the next day, and this time the Belgian
showed some curiosity as to the object of Anthony's visit.</p>

<p>'Is it in connection with the Turkish loan?' he asked.</p>

<p>Anthony smiled.</p>

<p>'You will, I am sure, agree with me that I must maintain the
utmost secrecy,' he said firmly.</p>

<p>'Naturally! Of course! Certainly!' said Monsieur Lament
hastily. 'I honour your discretion. But if it is in connection
with the Turkish loan, or the Viennese Municipal
loan&mdash;'</p>

<p>Anthony raised his hand with a gesture of gentle
insistence.</p>

<p>Monsieur Lament dissolved into apologies.</p>

<p>Anthony was himself curious and he attended M. Lament's
office on Wednesday morning with a joyous sense of
anticipation.</p>

<p>In that rosewood-panelled room standing with his back to the
white marble fireplace, he tore the flap of the envelope with
fingers that shook, for he realized that he might be at the very
crisis of his career; and that his good plan to drop into
financial society had succeeded beyond his wildest hope.</p>

<p>To his amazement, the letter was from Jane Mansar, and he
read it, open-mouthed.</p><br>

<p class="letter">'<span class="smcap">Dear Mr
Newton</span>:</p>

<p class="letter">Daddy wants to hand you over to the police or
have you ducked in the pond. I chose this method of giving you a
graceful exit from the scene, because I feel that such a man of
genius and valour should not be subjected to so ignominious a
fate. You are the thirty-fourth person who has secured an
introduction to my father by novel, and in some cases, painful,
methods. I have been rescued from terrifying tramps (who have
been hired by my rescuer) some six times. I have been pushed
into the river and rescued twice. Daddy has had three people
accidentally wounded by him when he has been shooting rabbits,
and at least five who have got into the way of his car when he
has been driving between the house and the station.</p>

<p class="letter">We do recognize and appreciate the novelty of
your method, and I confess that for a moment I was deceived by
the artistic wreckage of your poor little car. To make
absolutely sure that I was not doing you an injustice, I
telephoned the local garage, and found, as I expected, that you
had kept the car there for a fortnight before the 'accident'.
Poor Mr Newton, better luck next time.</p>

<p class="letter">Yours sincerely,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Jane
Mansar</span>.</p><br>

<p>Anthony read the letter three times, and then looked
mechanically at the slip of paper which was enclosed. It
ran:</p><br>

<p class="letter">To <span class="smcap"><i>MONSIEUR
LAMONT</i></span>,</p>

<p class="letter">Pay Mr Anthony Newton a sum sufficient to
enable him to reach London, and to support him on the
journey.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Gerald
Mansar</span>.</p><br>

<p>Monsieur Lament was watching the dazed young man.</p>

<p>'Is it important?' he asked eagerly. 'Is it to be
communicated to me?'</p>

<p>Anthony was never wholly overcome by the most tremendous
circumstances. He folded the letter, put it in his pocket,
looked at the slip again.</p>

<p>'I regret that I cannot tell you all that this contains,' he
said. 'I am leaving immediately for Berlin. From Berlin I go to
Vienna, from Vienna to Istanbul; from there I must make a
hurried journey to Rome, and from Rome I have to get to Tangier.
Then I shall reach Gibraltar in a month's time, and fly to
England.'</p>

<p>He handed the slip to Monsieur Lament.</p>

<p>'Pay Mr Anthony Newton a sufficient sum to enable him to
reach London and support him on the journey.'</p>

<p>Monsieur Lament looked at Anthony. 'How much will you
require, M'sieur?' he asked respectfully.</p>

<p>'About nine hundred pounds, I think,' said Anthony
softly.</p>

<p>Monsieur Lament gave him the money then and there and when
Mansar got the account he was justifiably annoyed.</p>

<p>He came into Jane, storming.</p>

<p>'That... that...' he spluttered, 'rascal...'</p>

<p>'Which rascal, Daddy, you know so many,' she was half
smiling.</p>

<p>'Newton... as you know, I gave Lament an order to pay his
expenses to London?'</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>'Well, he drew nine hundred pounds.'</p>

<p>The girl opened her eyes with joyous amazement.</p>

<p>'He told Lament that he was coming home by way of Berlin,
Vienna, Istanbul and Rome,' groaned Mr Mansar. 'Thank God the
trans-Siberian railway isn't working!' he added. It was the one
source of comfort he had.</p> <hr>

<p class="caption">Belshazzar Smith (renamed Bill Farrel in "The
Brigand")<br>
The Sunday Post, Glasgow, February 18, 1919</p>
</div><br>

<p class="first">MR TONY NEWTON threw up the window of his
sitting-room and looked across the chimney tops of Bloomsbury
with a critical eye.</p>

<p>It was a sunny day, and even chimney stacks and gaunt
dead-ends have a poetry in the golden light of an early morning
in summer to a young man plentifully endowed with faith in his
own capabilities.</p>

<p>Big Bill Farrel was his companion, and Bill had just finished
at his leisure a large plateful of ham and eggs, and now, with a
pipe between his teeth, was at peace with the world.</p>

<p>'<i>Voila</i>!' said Anthony gravely, and with a wave of his
hand indicated a number of portraits (mainly cut from
newspapers) which decorated one wall of his room.</p>

<p>He walked to the wall where his picture gallery offended the
unities, and stabbed with his finger portrait after portrait, as
he reeled off their titles and biographies.</p>

<p>'That's William O. McNeal, real name Adolph Bernsteiner, the
Meat King; that is Harry V. Teckle, the Steel King; that is
Theodore Match, the Shipping King; that is Montague G. Flake,
the Provision King; this fellow with the funny nose is Michael
O. Blogg, the Jam King&mdash;and that fellow with the glasses is
the Cotton King; and that lad with the dyspeptic eye and the
diamond pin is the Hardware King&mdash;bow to Their Majesties,
Bill. They are going to make us rich!'</p>

<p>'Eh?' said the startled and baffled Mr Farrel.</p>

<p>They are our little Eldorados,' said Tony calmly, 'our Pay
Cash or Bearers; our Money from Home!'</p>

<p>'Do you mean they're relations of yours?' asked Bill, in
tones of awe.</p>

<p>'God forbid!' said Mr Newton piously. 'Sit you down and I'll
expound the Plan of Operations and the General Idea.'</p>

<p>For an hour he expounded his scheme, and comprehension came
very slowly to Bill, but it came.</p>

<p>'And now,' said Tony, getting up, 'we will go to the little
office which I have rented in Theobald's Road.'</p>

<p>Painted on the uncleanly glass panel was the
inscription:</p><br>

<p class="sign">NEWTON'S DETECTIVE AGENCY</p><br>

<p>From a drawer in the one table of the room, he took a large
card, similarly painted.</p>

<p>'You will find two nails outside the door,' said Tony, 'and
your job will be to hang it out every morning and take it in
every night, providing the youth of Bloomsbury does not pinch
it.'</p>

<p>When Bill returned, his friend was reading a newspaper
cutting.</p>

<p>'Listen to this. It is a description of a sale at Floretti's.
"A small box of miscellaneous manuscript went to the bid of Mr
Montague Flake at 120 guineas. The box is of carved Spanish
mahogany," etc., etc. I will not bother you with the details.
The point is that Mr Flake is a great collector of old
manuscript and a great hog.'</p>

<p>From his wallet he took another and a smaller cutting.</p>

<p>'Listen,' he said, and read: '"A bargain: Small cottage with
one acre. Cottage could be made a comfortable weekend residence.
Price £1000 for quick sale."' He took a time table from his desk
and turned the leaves. 'Here is the place: the train leaves at
twelve.'</p>

<p>'I am to buy this property?' said Big Bill, open-mouthed.
Tony nodded.</p>

<p>That is your job,' he said. 'It will interest you to know
that I have already inspected it, and have an architect's plan
in my bedroom. Nevertheless, don't close the deal until you get
a telegram from me. You are not to communicate with me except
through this office, and under no circumstances are you to
disclose the fact that you know me or have any business dealings
with me.'</p>

<p>An hour later Big Bill left and Anthony returned to his
little hotel, took off his coat and set to work. In a box in his
bedroom were half a dozen sheets of age-stained parchment. He
spent the rest of the morning and the greater part of the
afternoon covering these with fine writing.</p>

<p>There is no more highly respected figure in financial and
business circles than Mr Montague Flake, for Mr Flake controlled
the butter markets of London, Copenhagen, Rotterdam and many
others. From which it may be gathered that Mr Flake was a
considerable personage even before the time he managed to corner
the butter supplies, to say nothing of the cold storage butter
and the butter in transit and the butter of unborn generations
of cows.</p>

<p>Officially, Mr Flake did not control the market. Officially
he had nothing to do with the cornering of margarine. In all his
stores&mdash;and there were 631 branches of Flake U.P. Stores
throughout the United Kingdom&mdash;the 'U.P.' standing for
'Universal Provisions'&mdash;there was a large notice
respectfully informing customers that the management was doing
its best to get supplies of butter and margarine, but that the
failure of the hay crop in Denmark, and the root crop in
Ireland, was causing much embarrassment, whilst the extra cost
of freights (which really worked out at an additional farthing
per pound), compelled the reluctant directors to raise the price
of butter 3d per pound, and margarine 2d.</p>

<p>And the customers were duly impressed, and, what is more to
the point, they paid, and millions of tuppence&mdash;ha'pennies
went into Mr Flake's pocket, for he was the company, the
directors and the shareholders.</p>

<p>Mr Flake had a large house in St John's Square, in the most
fashionable part of London. He had a model farm in Norfolk, an
estate in Kent, a shoot in Yorkshire and a salmon river in
Scotland. He could neither farm, shoot nor fish, but these were
the correct things to own, so he owned them.</p>

<p>It is said that his own idea of happiness was to sit in a
secluded spot on the edge of the lake on his estate, dabbling
his bare feet in the water and smoking a clay pipe, whilst he
read the divorce cases in the Sunday newspapers.</p>

<p>He was a harsh-faced man, wholly unsuggestive of butter or
anything oleaginous or suave. He was a widower, and lived alone,
save for a housekeeper, three secretaries, four chauffeurs,
twelve menservants and a small army of white-capped cooks,
housemaids and the like.</p>

<p>Mr Flake sat in his magnificent library at a table much
larger than the room in which the majority of his customers
slept, and he was nibbling his pen, for he was in the agony of
composition. He had scratched out twenty lines when a visitor
was announced. He took up the card that lay on the silver plate
and read the inscription without any show of interest. It
read:</p><br>

<p class="sign">THE NEWTON PRIVATE DETECTIVE AGENCY<br> Captain
Anthony Newton, DSO, MC,<br> late Blitheshire Fusiliers</p><br>

<p>He glared up at his secretary, who had followed the footman
into the room.</p>

<p>'What does he want? Tell him to write.'</p>

<p>'He insists upon seeing you, sir,' said the footman. 'I told
him you were busy.'</p>

<p>'Show him in,' growled Mr Flake.</p>

<p>Tony was ushered in, very grave, very business&mdash;like and
very well dressed.</p>

<p>'Sit down. Captain&mdash;er&mdash;Newton,' said Mr Flake,
waving his lordly hand to a chair. 'What can I do for you?'</p>

<p>Mr Newton removed his gloves slowly, laid them beside his
hat, took out his pocket-book and consulted the interior.</p>

<p>'A few days ago,' he said, 'you purchased a number of
miscellaneous manuscripts at Floretti's sale.'</p>

<p>Mr Flake nodded.</p>

<p>'They were the property,' Tony went on, 'of the late Lord
Witherall, who was a collector, and they comprised a number of
more or less important documents&mdash;'</p>

<p>'More or less worthless,' interrupted Mr Flake brusquely. 'As
a matter of fact, I bought that lot for the box more than for
the manuscripts. I haven't had time to look through them yet.'
Tony's eyes gleamed. 'And I don't suppose the manuscripts are
worth tuppence.'</p>

<p>'It was on the subject of the manuscripts I wanted to see
you,' said Tony. 'I have been employed by a client to interview
you under peculiar circumstances. A former confidential servant
of Lord Witherall gave into his lordship's custody certain
documents, the particulars of which I am not at liberty to give,
and these, according to the man's relatives &mdash;he has been
dead some years, by the way&mdash;were kept by his lordship in
that particular box. The man's name was Samuels, though that was
not the name he was known by to Lord Witherall. If that document
is in your possession&mdash;it is in the form of a letter
addressed to Samuels &mdash;my client is willing to pay you £200
for its return.'</p>

<p>Now Mr Flake was, above all things, a good business man, and
a good business man knows instinctively that a first offer of
£100 for anything means that it is worth much more. And a good
business man, moreover, has ever an eye to the main chance.</p>

<p>Mr Flake pressed a bell, and, when his secretary
appeared:</p>

<p>'Bring me that box I bought at Floretti's the other day,' he
said. 'I can tell you this,' he said, when the girl had gone,
'that I do not promise that I can return any document which may
be in this box. A deal's a deal. Captain Newton, and I am a
business man.'</p>

<p>Tony nodded.</p>

<p>'I can only remind you,' he said gently, 'that the relatives
of Samuels are very poor people, and from what I gather that
document may be of the greatest value to them.'</p>

<p>'And to me,' said Mr Flake pleasantly. 'I am poor, too. We
are all poor&mdash;it is a relative term, as we are on the
subject of relatives,' he added humorously.</p>

<p>'I don't think you can compare your condition with theirs,
sir,' said Anthony with dignity, 'and I feel sure that you would
not attempt to benefit at the expense of poor people&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Rubbish!' snapped Montague Flake. 'There is no sentiment in
my composition, sir. I am a self-made man, and I have made my
money without worrying very much about the people who have had
to part. A bargain is a bargain. If I pay 120 guineas for a
poke, I'm entitled to the pig I find in it. That's fair, ain't
it&mdash;isn't it, I mean? Mind you, I'm not going to say I
won't sell it,' he added, as the secretary placed the box on the
big table before him, 'and I'm not going to say I will.'</p>

<p>He cut the sealed cords which bound the box, and threw open
the lid. It was filled to the top with yellow manuscripts. Some
were bound together in vellum books, and there were a large
number of loose sheets.</p>

<p>Mr Flake hesitated and, lifting out the first stratum, laid
it on the desk.</p>

<p>'You say it is a letter?' he said.</p>

<p>Tony nodded.</p>

<p>'This is evidently the manuscript of an old play,' said Mr
Flake; 'and this'&mdash;he lifted another weighty
pile&mdash;'seems to be the original manuscript of a story of
some kind. Here are the letters.' He picked one up, turned it
over to read the signature, and laid it on the table.</p>

<p>Tony turned to the waiting secretary, and then to Mr Flake
with an air of indecision.</p>

<p>'I wonder if your secretary would be good enough to look up
the telephone number of Sir John Howard and Sons.'</p>

<p>He named the greatest of the London solicitors, a name which
carried respect even to Mr Flake.</p>

<p>'Are you acting for Howard?' he asked quickly.</p>

<p>Anthony smiled.</p>

<p>'For the moment I cannot disclose my principals,' he
said.</p>

<p>He looked round and waited until the door closed behind the
girl; then he sidled close to Mr Flake.</p>

<p>'I can tell you this in confidence,' he said in a low voice.
I am acting for&mdash;'</p>

<p>He whispered a name in Mr Flake's ear. To reach the financier
he had to come round to the corner of the table. As he
whispered, he obscured for a moment Mr Flake's view of the box.
With somebody whispering in your ear, it is difficult to detect
the rustle of parchment.</p>

<p>Tony's hand shot into the open box, and was out again before
Mr Flake could recover from his surprise.</p>

<p>'Tup?' said Mr Flake irritably. 'Who the dickens is Tup?'</p>

<p>'That,' said the suave young man, 'I will reveal at some
later stage of the enquiry. I thought you knew.'</p>

<p>Mr Flake looked at him searchingly, but the eyes of Tony
Newton did not falter.</p>

<p>'Anyway,' said the financier, as he bundled the documents
back into the box, 'I haven't time to go through these things
now, and I shan't be able to give you an answer for a few
days.'</p>

<p>'But it is urgent.' Tony was earnest again. 'If it is a
question of money we shall not quarrel over a few hundreds. It
is absolutely necessary that we should get this document back
immediately.'</p>

<p>'And it is absolutely necessary,' said Mr Flake
good-humouredly, 'that I should have my afternoon tea and that
I should have time to examine the contents. I will give you your
answer to-morrow.'</p>

<p>With this the visitor had to be content. He left the house,
curiously enough, without discovering the telephone number he
had enquired for, and made his way to the nearest post office.
He sent a telegram addressed to 'Smith, Bull Hotel, Little
Wenson, Kent,' and the message was: 'Close the deal.'</p>

<p>Four days later a large car drew up before a very small
cottage a mile from the village of Little Wenson, and Mr Flake
descended.</p>

<p>The cottage was a poor sort of dwelling; the garden was
neglected and the windows uncurtained; but he was less
interested in the house than in the acre of kitchen garden,
equally neglected, which stood at its rear.</p>

<p>Fortunately, he was able to make his reconnaissance without
effort, for the cottage stood at the corner of a lane and the
western limit of the garden ran flush with the hedge. There were
two apple trees, and beyond the broken wall of a well with its
crazy windlass.</p>

<p>Mr Flake walked slowly back to the front of the cottage,
pushed open the gate, walked along the garden path and knocked
at the door. A man in his shirt sleeves answered: a tall,
solemn-looking man, who answered Mr Flake's cheery 'Good
morning!' with a non-committal nod.</p>

<p>'Is this your house?' asked Mr Flake pleasantly.</p>

<p>'Yes, sir,' said Big Bill Farrel, the cottager.</p>

<p>'Rather nice situation,' said Mr Flake.</p>

<p>'It's not so bad,' said the other, cautiously.</p>

<p>'Been here long?'</p>

<p>'About a week,' said the occupant. 'I haven't been out of the
army long, and I thought of starting a poultry farm.'</p>

<p>'Oh, so you were in the army?' said Mr Flake, patronisingly.
'Well, it doesn't seem the right kind of place to raise
chickens. Who owned it before you?'</p>

<p>'I forget the name,' said the cottager, 'but it's been in the
same family for hundreds of years.'</p>

<p>'H'm!' said Mr Flake. Then, carelessly: 'Can't you recall the
name?'</p>

<p>'Something like Samson,' said the cottager, with an effort of
memory.</p>

<p>'Was it Samuels?' asked Mr Flake, eagerly.</p>

<p>'Ah, that's the name, Samuels. They weren't the last tenants,
but they were the people who owned it years ago.'</p>

<p>'H'm!' said Mr Flake again. 'If it isn't asking you a rude
question, what did you pay for it?'</p>

<p>'All the money I had,' parried the other skilfully. 'And as
the song says&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes,' said Mr Flake. I know what the song says, but
now, tell me&mdash;what would you sell this little property
for?'</p>

<p>'I wouldn't sell it,' said the cottager.</p>

<p>'Come, come, you'd sell it for a hundred pounds' profit,
surely?' said Mr Flake.</p>

<p>'Not for a thousand pounds' profit,' said the other,
determinedly. 'Not for ten thousand pounds' profit. There's some
funny tales going about this property. I had a lawyer down here
the other day and a private detective.'</p>

<p>'The devil you did!' said Mr Flake. 'Come, now, let's talk
business. I am a business man, and I will give you two thousand
pounds for this property.'</p>

<p>'If you offered me twenty thousand pounds I wouldn't take
it,' said the cottager, with greater determination than ever. 'I
am satisfied with it, and, as Socrates says: "Contentment is
natural wealth; luxury is artificial poverty."'</p>

<p>'Never mind about Socrates,' said the impatient Mr Flake. 'I
will give you&mdash;'</p>

<p>'"If man knew what felicity dwells in the cottage of a godly
man," says Jeremy Taylor,' the cottager insisted.</p>

<p>'Now look here.' Mr Flake was aroused. 'Will you take a
reasonable price for this property? I've got a fancy for it and
I will pay anything in reason.'</p>

<p>'Come inside,' said the cottager opening the door. An hour
later Mr Farrel shook the dust of Little Wenson from his feet.
He was accompanied to London by Mr Flake, and together they
journeyed to a bank in Lombard Street, for Mr Farrel admitted to
a wholesome horror of cheques, and not until he had received
large bundles of banknotes did he affix his signature to the
deed which transferred his property to Mr Flake.</p>

<p>It was a long time since Mr Flake had done a day's hard
digging, but he felt that he was being well repaid for his
labours when, at six o'clock the next morning, he began his
excavations. A line drawn at right angles from the centre of the
two apple trees passed the well on the right hand side. This was
exactly as the document in his possession said it should
pass.</p>

<p>Those three sheets of parchment written in a crabbed hand,
described how one William Samuels had in the year 1826 stolen
from the strong rooms of Cheals Bank, at which he was employed
as a porter, 'brilliant stones to the value of £120,000, the
property of the French emigre, the Marquis du Thierry', and of
how he had hidden that same in the garden of his brother, Henry
Frederick Samuels, in the parish of Little Wenson. Mr Flake
consulted them again and again. The directions worked out with
magnificent accuracy. Nine feet three inches at the right angle
from a line drawn between the two apple trees brought the seeker
after stolen wealth to the centre of a newly dug garden plot.
Four feet down Mr Flake's heart leapt when he came to the
'square flat stone which I have put atop of the Hole in which
said Box is Hidden'.</p>

<p>The said box was there. A perspiring Mr Flake discovered it
after three hours' strenuous digging and brought it to the
light. It looked strangely new. Indeed an ordinary person might
have confused it with one of those solid boxes which farmers
employ to send eggs by rail. It was heavy, but Mr Flake did not
feel its weight as he carried it to the seclusion of the cottage
and prized off its top.</p>

<p>It was heavy because it was half-filled with sand. He ran his
hand through the sand, and his fingers encountered a square
piece of cardboard, which he took out and carried to the light,
for he was a thought near-sighted.</p>

<p>There was one line of writing, and that in the same crabbed
calligraphy as the letter he had found in his box of
manuscript&mdash;though, if he had examined that box before Mr
Newton had whispered in his ear, he might have saved himself a
great deal of labour and no small amount of money.</p>

<p>The inscription ran:</p>

<p class="cp"><i>'TUP means The Unfortunate People, on whose
behalf I am acting.'</i></p>

<p><br> The next morning Mr Flake waited upon Mr Newton. 'You
and your gang have swindled me out of twelve thousand pounds,'
he said. 'You can either hand the money back or be
prosecuted.'</p>

<p>'Thank you very kindly,' said Tony. 'I will be
prosecuted.'</p>

<p>'You are a common swindler,' stormed Mr Flake.</p>

<p>'There are two ways out of this room,' said Tony. 'One is out
of the window and one is out of the door. You have paid your
money, so you can take your choice.'</p>

<p>'I shall go to the police,' fumed Mr Flake, taking up his
hat. He was on the point of apoplexy.</p>

<p>'Now listen to me,' said Tony kindly. 'You got the worst of a
deal. You thought you were going to make a lot of money at the
expense of a poor family. You have spent your life getting fat
on the money you have twisted from the public. You have scraped
something from every slice of bread and butter in the kingdom.
That you should get rich and have your shooting boxes and your
country estates, quite a lot of people have gone hungry. The law
cannot touch you. You are one of the thieves who keep within the
law. I have taken twelve thousand pounds from you on a square
deal and I tell you this'&mdash;he shook his finger in the
purple face of the speechless financier&mdash;'that twelve
thousand pounds will be 120 thousand before I have done with
you.'</p>

<p>'You are a common thief!' spluttered Mr Flake.</p>

<p>'Bill,' called Tony sternly, and the big man appeared in the
doorway, 'chuck this blighter out.'</p>

<p>Bill, the whilom cottager, opened the door and jerked his
thumb.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="story4" id="story4">IV. &mdash; A CONTRIBUTION TO
CHARITY</a></h2>

<h3>First published as<br> "The Outwitting of Mr. Theodore
Match"<br> in <i>The Sunday Post</i>, Glagow, February 16,
1919</h3>

<p class="first">TONY NEWTON was not given to indiscriminate
charity. He believed in that variety which began at home and
stayed there, for he had a profound lack of faith in the bona
fides of charity organisers. He was not intensely interested in
the Mercantile Marine, nor had he the slightest intention of
founding cottage houses for disabled sailors&mdash;until he met
Mr Match.</p>

<p>Tony always said that the affair of the shipowner was his
greatest exploit&mdash;the greater perhaps since he gained no
personal benefit from his ingenuity.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that Scotland Yard could tolerate the
existence and operations of a conscienceless brigand. But
Scotland Yard is powerless without the support of a complainant
who may develop into a prosecutor. Mr Newton owed his immunity
partly to the shyness of certain wronged men to take action, and
partly (and this was the greater part) to the inability of his
victims to offer an interpretation of their own conduct that
would look well in the printed report of an Old Bailey
trial.</p>

<p>Tony and his brigands enjoyed a wider reputation than he
guessed: this much he discovered one day when a 'case' took him
to Newcastle.</p>

<p>He and Big Bill Farrel had sat for an hour in the fading
light, smoking in silence. The evening sky was still bright, and
through the open window came the shrill voices of children at
play. For in London the street is still the Coliseum of
childhood, the course and arena of its Roman game, the very
college where it graduates in the bitter science of life.</p>

<p>'Who is Theodore Match?' asked Anthony unexpectedly, and Bill
started.</p>

<p>His friend had the bland tone of a schoolmaster extracting
information from a nervous pupil.</p>

<p>'The Shipping King,' said Farrel, remembering.</p>

<p>'And what is a Shipping King?' demanded Tony.</p>

<p>'A Shipping King?' hesitated the other. 'Well, he's a fellow
who owns ships.'</p>

<p>Tony smiled sadly.</p>

<p>'A Shipping King,' he explained, 'is a man who sees trouble
ahead. He's always on the point of being ruined next year. If
trade is good, he's going to be ruined through the shortage of
shipping. If there are lots of ships he's ruined by the shortage
of freights. Sometimes he's ruined by the charter rates,
sometimes by the price of coal. He gets so ruined in one way and
another, what with income tax and surtax and excess profits tax,
that he doesn't know what to do with the money he can't
spend.'</p>

<p>'Good Lord!' said Bill, who was brave but not bright.</p>

<p>'Anyway, Theodore Match, Esquire, who has never given a
ha'penny to charity, is going to provide a start in life for the
great-great-grandson of a man who fought at Trafalgar. That's
me! My great-great-grandfather was a sailor&mdash;we kept his
wooden leg for years as a souvenir.'</p>

<p>Bill knocked the ashes from his pipe.</p>

<p>'Match isn't a bad old stick,' he said, unconscious of his
humour. 'He gave a new library&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You needn't praise Mr Match,' interrupted Tony. 'He'll be
Sir Theodore Match in the next Honours List. Anyway, he doesn't
know how generous he is going to be. Bill, is your tea dearer
than it used to be? Is meat dearer&mdash;is bread
dearer&mdash;is everything dearer that comes from overseas? Who
do you think has got the extra ha'pence? The planter and the
farmer have got a bit&mdash;they worked for it and good luck to
them. But Theodore Match has got more than his whack. He's had a
ha'penny of yours for tea and a farthing for your loaf of bread
and something out of everything you eat or drink. He's raised
his freights. Coal is dear, labour is dearer&mdash;everything's
dear. But he's the dearest thing of all. There's nothing cheap
about Theodore except the souls he sends to sea and the men he
employs and his charitable subscriptions. To cut short my
introduction, I have put him down on the subscription list to
Anthony Newton's Happy Evening Fund for the sum of twelve
thousand pounds&mdash;and I'll get it.'</p>

<p>Mr Farrel nodded slowly, and there was admiration in his
eyes.</p>

<p>'I bet you will,' he said enthusiastically.</p>

<p>The Theodore Steamship Line, as everybody knows, is one of
the most important cargo lines in the United Kingdom. It had a
fleet of 25 ships, it traded with South America, with the China
seas and with the two coasts, and with India and Africa. Its
head offices were in Newcastle; and to Newcastle Tony Newton
journeyed next day, accompanied by his trusty lieutenant. They
arrived late in the evening and went at once to the Station
Hotel.</p>

<p>Early in the morning Anthony set forth on a voyage of
discovery. The Theodore Steamship Line possessed an
unpretentious block of offices not very far from the hotel, and
by the energy of the clerks and the number of clients who waited
in the various departments. Tony gathered that business was
extensively brisk.</p>

<p>He passed into the office, handed his card to a clerk and
presently was shown into the private room of Mr Theodore Match.
It was a large room, half-panelled in oak and hung about with
photographs of ships. Mr Match was a middle-aged man with one of
those jovial, bearded countenances and those easily laughing
eyes which are the possession of men upon whom the cares and
worries of this world sit lightly.</p>

<p>He beamed at his visitor through gold-rimmed glasses.</p>

<p>'Glad to meet you, Mr Newton,' he said, to that adventurer's
surprise. 'Sit you down and make yourself at home. Have a
cigar.' He handed a silver box to the visitor and Tony slowly
selected one. 'Now what is it you want?' smiled Mr Match. 'Ten
thousand pounds for some buried treasure or a million pound
partnership?'</p>

<p>For a second, but only for a second. Tony was surprised to
silence.</p>

<p>'I think I'll take the partnership,' he said, 'though, as a
matter of fact, I don't want anything like that sum.'</p>

<p>Mr Match leant back in his chair, shaking with laughter and
rubbing his hands together as though he were a participant in
the greatest joke in the world.</p>

<p>'You see, I know you, Newton. As a matter of fact, I've been
warned about you. I'll tell you frankly, I know all about the
little office you had in Theobald's Road. I know all about your
portrait gallery&mdash;I sent a private detective there the
other day to have a look round&mdash;I know all about your
adventures with Mr Montague Flake, who is an old friend and
client of ours, and Mr Gerald Mansar is another. I know how you
diddled Flake out of twelve thousand pounds&mdash;I've been
laughing over that ever since. Now let us come down to plain
speaking, Mr Newton,' he said, leaning forward and resting his
elbows on the arms of his chair. 'You imagine you have a mission
in life to relieve rich men of their unearned surpluses. Am I
right?'</p>

<p>Tony was now at his ease. He recognised the situation and his
mind was working rapidly.</p>

<p>'That is perfectly true,' he said. 'I have.'</p>

<p>Now Tony had had no desire to help anybody but himself. But
at that moment was born a righteous and philanthropic
resolve.</p>

<p>'Good!' said Mr Match heartily. 'You have marked down a dozen
disgustingly rich people to contribute to your comfort.'</p>

<p>'That also is true,' said Tony.</p>

<p>'Good again!' said Mr Match. 'You regard me as a profiteer
and you have come to Newcastle with a grand little scheme in
your head to make me contribute to&mdash;what?'</p>

<p>'I have been settling soldiers on the land,' said Tony. 'I
want to provide a few homes for wives and children of the men of
the Mercantile Marine,' he said slowly.</p>

<p>'Admirable philanthropist!'</p>

<p>The eyes of Mr Theodore Match were beaming with benevolent
fun. He stroked his little beard thoughtfully.</p>

<p>'Admirable philanthropist!' he repeated. 'And how much am I
supposed to contribute to this very interesting experiment of
yours?'</p>

<p>'I have put you down for twelve thousand pounds,' said
Tony.</p>

<p>'Why not twelve million pounds? I am as willing to give one
as the other. And I suppose you have some little scheme to get
it. Now be a sportsman, Newton,' he said banteringly. 'What
shall it be? A grand confidence trick, buried
treasure&mdash;won't you enlighten me as to the little trick you
intended employing to extract my hard-won wealth?'</p>

<p>Tony laughed.</p>

<p>'I will give you frankness for frankness,' he said. 'I hadn't
quite made up my mind.'</p>

<p>'Come,' said the other, 'be friendly.'</p>

<p>The door opened at that moment and a young man came in, a
tall, stoutly built young man, red and puffy of face.</p>

<p>'This is my son; this is Mr Newton, about whom I was speaking
to you, Tom,' said Theodore Match.</p>

<p>'Tell me, before we go any farther,' said Tony, 'will you
contribute anything to my scheme?'</p>

<p>'Not a bean,' smiled the other, 'not half a bean, not the
very dust that lies at the bottom of a bag of beans. Why should
I? Am I sitting here making money for my servants or for myself?
Do I devote the whole of my day and the greater part of my night
to working out schemes for increasing my surtax in order to
bring trade and custom to a hundred local public-houses? No,
sir!' He thumped his desk furiously. 'The welfare of my men does
not interest me. What they do with their money does not interest
me either. What I do with my own is no concern of theirs or
yours or anybody else's in the world.'</p>

<p>'Do you want me, governor?' asked the young man.</p>

<p>'No, Tom, I merely wanted you to come in to see Mr
Newton.'</p>

<p>With a nod to the visitor and a meaning grin to his parent
Tom Match left the room.</p>

<p>'I make more money than the able seaman because I am cleverer
than the able seaman. It is the triumph of intellect over brute
strength. Show me anybody who is cleverer than I and let him
take it out of me, and I am perfectly willing that he shall get
away with it. If you'&mdash;he pointed a pencil at Tony and
spoke more slowly&mdash;'or your military attache, who I
understand bears the name of Farrel, can by any trick or dodge
or act of artfulness, short of forgery or burglary or robbery,
extract from, me twelve thousand pounds or twenty thousand
pounds, you are at liberty to do so. I tell you this frankly,
and as man to man, Newton, that the welfare of the seaman is of
no interest to me. I don't for one moment imagine that it is of
much interest to you. That Mercantile Marine Home was an
inspiration. You came here to carry out a private swindle
&mdash;but we'll let that go. If you can find a way of getting
the better of me, if you can trap me in an unguarded moment by
any trick you may choose into giving you the money you require,
I promise you that I will not prosecute you even though the act
by which you extract the money may be a criminal one in the eyes
of the law.'</p>

<p>He stood up, still smiling, and thrust out his big hand, and
Tony was smiling as he gripped it. There was something about
this Philistine that he liked. If he were a brute, he was an
honest brute.</p>

<p>'I accept your challenge,' he said. 'Within a week you will
have contributed twelve thousand pounds to an unexpected
charity.'</p>

<p>'You can't do it,' said Mr Match decidedly. 'Why, my dear
man, I have successfully resisted an appeal of the highest
people in the land. Look here!' He walked back to his desk,
pulled open a drawer and flung out half a dozen printed
documents, attached by a fastener. 'It came this
morning&mdash;the Prince's Appeal for Merchant Seamen. That's
one better than yours. They want a million,' he chuckled. 'Did I
refuse it? No, sir, I ignored it. If I refused I should get into
bad odour&mdash;you realize we are speaking in confidence as men
of honour. If the Prince comes to Newcastle I shall dodge him.
If he writes me a personal letter I shall be on a bed of
sickness and unable to reply. I have never given a ha'porth of
charity in my life and, please heaven, I never shall! When I die
I shall leave nothing to build hospitals or found churches,
nothing for the indigent poor, nothing for anybody who hasn't
the right to it.'</p>

<p>He was a shrewd man, in many ways brilliant. He had one of
those extraordinarily nimble minds which are the peculiar
possession of the accountant and the bookmaker. There was no
need for him to take any extra precautions. He had sized up Tony
and knew that he had a foe worthy of his steel, but felt quite
competent to meet all the machinations which the most ingenious
and most unscrupulous philanthropist could devise. If he
scrutinised a little more closely the documents which came
before him in the ordinary course of business for his signature,
if he watched with a little more care the companions of his son,
if he was a little more suspicious of all the business proposals
which came before him from outside sources, and read into them
some sinister scheme of Newton to secure his subscription, it
was not an unusual care for an unprecedented suspicion, nor a
particularly remarkable scrutiny which he exercised, for he was
by nature careful.</p>

<p>Of Tony he saw nothing for the first three days. A private
detective whom he had employed to shadow the philanthropist
reported that he spent most of his time in the private
sitting-room of his hotel with his companion, the tall, solemn
soldier with whom he occasionally went abroad.</p>

<p>He met Tony in the street by accident on the fourth day and
crossed the road to greet him.</p>

<p>'Well,' demanded Mr Match boisterously, his eyes agleam, 'how
goes the robbery under arms&mdash;the Great-Turf-Fraud&mdash;the
Jim-the-Penman-Ship?'</p>

<p>Tony laughed.</p>

<p>'Fine,' he said. 'I reckon your money is as good as in my
pocket.'</p>

<p>Match roared his merriment.</p>

<p>'Have you found a scheme?'</p>

<p>Tony shook his head.</p>

<p>'Not really&mdash;but I'm picking it up little by little.
Watts invented the steam engine through seeing a kettle
boil&mdash;I'm watching the extraordinary effect of large
self-confidence upon the security of wealth.'</p>

<p>'Watch!' said the other, and put out his hand. 'You're going
to get eyestrain.'</p>

<p>He was going on, but Tony laid his hand on his arm.</p>

<p>'Wait&mdash;there's one thing I want to tell you,' he said.
'There are a dozen ways I could get the money from you, but
they're all dishonest. I could forge your name as easily as
anything&mdash;I should have made a most successful
criminal&mdash;I could burgle your stately mansion at
Morpeth&mdash;I've reconnoitered the ground and it's dead easy
to get through the window above the portico&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Try it,' said the other significantly.</p>

<p>'Oh, I know all about the burglar alarms, but I could make
them inoperative with a gimlet and a wire in a matter of
moments. I could impersonate you so that your own son would be
deceived. But none of these things appeal to me. There isn't any
art in them&mdash;I should just hate to take the money. But
you're a difficult proposition. You're too big &mdash;there's
nothing really mean about you.'</p>

<p>'Flatterer,' smiled Mr Match.</p>

<p>'It's a fact. I could never get you to buy a share in buried
treasure, or bluff you into believing that I know all about your
past life. You're just an honest rascal making a fortune out of
people's necessity and so far as I can see you have only one
weak spot.'</p>

<p>Mr Match looked at him quizzically.</p>

<p>'Let me know that and I am fortified,' he said.</p>

<p>'You are too confident of yourself,' said Tony. 'That's where
your undoing lies.'</p>

<p>'Prove it.'</p>

<p>'I can prove it all right,' said Tony.</p>

<p>They were near his hotel and the hour was one.</p>

<p>'Come and lunch with me, if I promise you that I will neither
dope, sandbag nor hypnotise you.'</p>

<p>'Done!' said Mr Match heartily. 'We will discuss this matter
further &mdash;you amuse me.'</p>

<p>It was not until the lunch was over that Mr Match again
approached the subject. Throughout the meal Tony kept up a
light, continuous flow of amusing reminiscence and Mr Match
found him an agreeable companion.</p>

<p>'You were talking about my self-confidence and how it might
ruin me. I am interested. Please elucidate.'</p>

<p>Mr Newton shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>'What I mean is that you have confidence in the processes of
business and in your own ability to handle any situation which
has to do with the transference of money. For example, if I
asked you for a cheque for twelve thousand pounds at this moment
and you gave me that cheque, you would be quite satisfied in
your mind that you would be able to prevent that money from
going to charity.'</p>

<p>The shipper thought for a moment.</p>

<p>'Yes,' he said. 'I think I can say with confidence&mdash;it
may be over-confidence but I don't think it is&mdash;that I
could give you &mdash;in fact, I am quite willing to give you at
this moment&mdash;a crossed cheque for twelve thousand
pounds.'</p>

<p>'You think that you could stop it.'</p>

<p>The other nodded.</p>

<p>'You would probably post-date it till to-morrow.'</p>

<p>Match nodded again.</p>

<p>'And such is your confidence in the etiquette and practice of
banking that you would not be one penny the worse off.'</p>

<p>'Exactly,' said the other, 'though it might put you in rather
a hole, my friend.'</p>

<p>'Whether it would or not,' said Tony, offering his cigarette
case, 'I challenge you to do so, and I promise you that if I do
not get the value of that cheque applied to the purpose I design
it, I will not bother you again.'</p>

<p>For a moment the shipping man looked at him and then, with a
little grin and with that quickness which characterised all his
movements, he slipped a chequebook from one pocket and a
fountain pen from another, and wrote. Tony, looking across the
table, saw that the cheque was dated for the following day. He
noted that under the amount Mr Match wrote:</p>

<p>'This cheque must only be passed on the personal
authorisation of the payer.'</p>

<p>He signed it with a flourish, crossed it with two heavy
strokes and handed it to his companion with a smile. Tony drew a
long sigh of relief.</p>

<p>'Thank you,' he said. 'I see you have made it payable to
bearer.'</p>

<p>'The bearer will have some difficulty in getting it,' said Mr
Match.</p>

<p>Mr Match drove straight back to his office and without a
moment's delay called up his bank on the telephone.</p>

<p>'That you, Gilbert? It's Theodore Match speaking. I have just
given a cheque for twelve thousand pounds, payable to
bearer&mdash;got that? The number of the cheque is
A.B.714312&mdash;got that? I stop payment of that cheque and it
is not to be cashed or debited to my account under any
circumstances. I will give you confirmation in writing.'</p>

<p>It may be said of Theodore Match that his pleasures were
mainly intellectual. He had found his principal joy in life in
pitting his wits against wits as shrewd or nearly as shrewd as
his own, and it is true that he accounted success less by the
money that that success brought to him than by the satisfaction
of having outwitted his opponent. Whether or not Tony knew his
man before he came to Newcastle, it is certain that he
understood him now.</p>

<p>Match did not regard the money as of any great consequence.
He took a keen pleasure in the game for the game's sake and it
was in this spirit of eager interest that he awaited the
culmination of his enemy's plan.</p>

<p>His watcher brought him two items of news that afternoon, one
that Big Bill Farrel had gone to London by the first train, the
second that Tony had hired the window of a small confectioner's
shop in the main street for two days, and that the contents of
that window were being hurriedly removed to make way for an
interesting exhibit. No other happening marked that afternoon.
Having secured his window, Tony did not fill it. It was not
until the following afternoon that he showed his hand,
simultaneously with the issue of the evening papers.</p>

<p>At half past two Mr Match received a telegram from
London.</p>

<p>'Heartiest congratulations and thanks for your help.'</p>

<p>It was signed 'Farrel'.</p>

<p>'Now who the dickens is Farrel?' asked Match with a
frown.</p>

<p>He was cogitating when Tom, his young hopeful, burst into the
room.</p>

<p>'I say, father,' he gasped, 'you didn't tell me you were
going to do it!'</p>

<p>'Do what?' asked Mr Match, suspiciously.</p>

<p>'Why,' said the young hopeful, 'that Prince's Fund; you told
me you would not contribute a cent!'</p>

<p>Mr Match was on his feet.</p>

<p>'And how much have I contributed?' he asked quietly.</p>

<p>'Twelve thousand pounds. It's in the evening papers. That
fellow Newton has got a window in High Street pasted round with
appeals for the Prince's Fund, and a photographic enlargement of
your cheque in the centre.'</p>

<p>Mr Match collapsed into his chair. 'Good lord!' he said.
Then: 'What do the papers say?'</p>

<p>The young man took a paper and read:</p>

<p>'We understand that the Prince's Fund for Merchant Seamen is
the richer by 12,000 through the generosity of Mr Theodore Match
of this city, a cheque for this amount having been given by our
patriotic fellow-citizen.'</p>

<p>'Good lord!' said Match again. 'So that was his dodge! He
couldn't get it for himself, and so he got it for the fund.'</p>

<p>'Did you give him a cheque?'</p>

<p>Mr Match nodded. 'But I stopped it,' he said. 'That fellow's
too clever for me.'</p>

<p>'But you aren't going to let it go through?' said his
agitated hopeful.</p>

<p>'Don't be a fool, Tom,' said Mr Match calmly. 'Stopping a
cheque for one of Newton's infernal schemes and stopping a
cheque for a big national fund are two different matters. He's
got me all right. Don't you see what would happen if I
repudiated my gift? I should be pilloried from one end of the
country to the other.'</p>

<p>With a deep sigh he reached for the telephone and gave the
number.</p>

<p>'That you, Gilbert? With reference to that cheque I stopped
yesterday&mdash;yes, the one for twelve thousand pounds. It is
now in order. Let it go through.'</p>

<p>He pressed a bell, summoned his secretary, and dictated a
confirmation. He went home that night a silent, thoughtful man,
and answered the congratulations of the few privileged friends
who could approach him on the subject somewhat absently.</p>

<p>The next morning when he got to his office, he found his
banker waiting for him.</p>

<p>'That cheque was cleared very quickly,' said Gilbert.</p>

<p>'Cleared?' said Mr Match in surprise.</p>

<p>The other nodded.</p>

<p>'It was cleared soon after I got your message yesterday
afternoon, through the London and Midland Bank of Newcastle. By
the way, I see that there is a contradiction about your gift in
this morning's paper.'</p>

<p>Mr Match took the paper in his hand without a word.</p>

<p>We find we were in error in describing the charity which
benefited by Mr Match's munificence as the Prince's Fund. This
error was due to the fact that a facsimile of the cheque was
shown in the High Street amidst a number of appeals to support
the Prince's charity. The money has been devoted to Captain
Newton's Cottage Homes for Seamen's Families.</p>

<p>Mr Match put down the paper.</p>

<p>'I gave the cheque,' he said, talking aloud to himself, 'I
stopped the cheque and then I authorised its payment, just as he
said I would. It was clever. He took the cheque, paid it into
the London and Midland &mdash;he must have opened a special
account in Newcastle for some such purpose&mdash;and started the
story about my having subscribed to the Prince's Fund knowing
that the first thing I would do would be to cancel the stoppage
of the cheque&mdash;clever! Yes, I was overconfident, all
right!'</p>

<p>He picked up the telephone.</p>

<p>'Give me the Station Hotel.' Then after a pause: 'Is Mr
Anthony Newton there? Put him through, please. Is that you,
Newton?</p>

<p>'Yes,' said the cheerful voice of Tony.</p>

<p>'When you get tired of your career of crime,' said Mr Match,
'I can give you a partnership in this firm.'</p>

<p>'Not on your life,' said Tony. 'You're not going to get your
money back that way!'</p>

<p>When Mr Match put down the telephone he was laughing softly
to himself.</p> <hr>

GREY</a></h2><br>

<p class="caption">Captain Hex (later Anthony Newman)<br>
Portrait from The Sunday Post, Glasgow, March 2, 1919</p>
</div><br>

<p class="first">DURING the hectic days of war, Anthony Newton
had met Sybil Martin. He called her 'The Lady in Grey', and was
a little terrified of her. It was not that she was haughty, or
that she was of herself terrifying. Hers was a peculiar
loveliness; a patrician type of beauty which awed without
inspiring.</p>

<p>The daughter of a poor nobleman, she possessed the qualities
of the grand dame to this extent, that, without effort on her
own part, she impressed people with a sense of their
inferiority.</p>

<p>Jim Martin was Tony's colonel. Anthony was always puzzled
when he met people of Martin's position. He never knew whether
they were rich or poor. They seemed to have been born to the use
of great houses and the rights of perambulating vast estates,
carrying under their arms guns of costly make, wherewith to
shoot expensively-reared partridges. They had the entree to
other great houses, and were free of shootings and fishings.
They called one another by their Christian names, and had a host
of mutual friends. Jim Martin was fatally wounded in the second
year of the war.</p>

<p>'Do what you can for the missus,' he said, just before he
died.</p>

<p>At the first opportunity, Anthony had sought her out in her
little house in Curzon Street. She was disconcertingly cool and
unemotional. Anthony was hot and stammering before he had been
with her ten minutes. Was there anything he could do? Oh, no,
nothing at all. She thanked him very much, asked him to stay to
lunch, and discussed air raids and a new war book that was
creating a sensation at the moment.</p>

<p>Anthony crawled out of her presence.</p>

<p>He had seen her three times since. Once, in the direst days
of his poverty, he had been loafing in Hyde Park and she passed
in a beautiful car. He raised his hat and she stared past him.
Perhaps she had not seen him? She was in grey, as usual, a
silvery dove-like grey that suited her.</p>

<p>The second time was after his excellent encounter with
certain confidence tricksters. It was in the vestibule of a
theatre and she was waiting for somebody. This time she smiled
an acknowledgment to his bow and moved toward him.</p>

<p>'I have an idea I saw you in the park a month ago, Mr Newton.
My mind was so occupied that I did not remember you until I had
passed. Won't you come and see me some day?'</p>

<p>'I shall be delighted,' said Anthony, sincerely. At any rate,
his mind was relieved as to her financial status. He sometimes
wondered exactly what he would have done if it had been less
satisfactory.</p>

<p>At the moment he was engineering a coup, and it came in the
nature of an unpleasant shock to see the 'objective' hurrying to
meet the girl he had just left.</p>

<p>'Oh. blow!' said Anthony.</p>

<p>The squat, bald figure that sidled up to his queen in grey
had been the object of his very earnest study.</p>

<p>Mr Jepburn had not been born with that name. There had been a
'ski and a 'vitch' in it somewhere before he had left his native
Poland, and he had acquired 'Jepburn' from a packing-case he had
seen lying on the quay at Dover, when he landed as a third-class
passenger with exactly twenty roubles in his pocket and a
passionate antipathy to the land of his birth.</p>

<p>So 'Mr Jepburn' he became in those lax days, when men could
change their names with greater facility than they could change
their shirts, and in course of time he became rich. Many and
interesting were the methods he employed to acquire his
wealth.</p>

<p>An East End Club, with a polyglot membership, started him on
the road to prosperity. Then his fortune took a sudden rise as a
result of judicious contracts placed by the Government. Later he
formed what was subsequently known as the 'Jepburn Circle'. In
various parts of the West End, he either acquired or rented
houses, furnished or unfurnished, staffed them with compatriot
men and women upon whom he could rely, roped in a few
impecunious members of the nobility and gentry to act as hosts
and touts, and in an amazingly short time had seven gambling
hells in full swing.</p>

<p>The name of Jepburn was associated with none of these. When
you went to Mrs Keluer Buizan's Belgian dances, you could not
guess that Mrs Keluer Buizan owned not a stick of the handsome
furniture at 43, Flowerview Gardens, S.W.; that she was neither
the lessee nor the proprietor of the house in which she lived,
and that her household expenses, plus a thousand a year, were
paid for by a stout little man with a bald head, who lived in a
modest Bloomsbury flat.</p>

<p>People came to the dance and stayed to play, and the usual
game was trente-et-quarante. The croupiers were Mr Jepburn's
own, the profits of the game were also Mr Jepburn's, and they
were invariably large, for his croupiers were even better paid
than his hostesses, and the gentlemen who dealt the pack could,
by the transposition of one card from the bottom to the top,
decide whether black or red would win. And that colour won which
was supported for the least amount.</p>

<p>Despite his enormous expenses, Mr Jepburn made thirty
thousand pounds a year out of each of his seven houses, and it
was an awkward matter for the police to deal with him, because
the hostesses were people whose names were known, the game was,
to all appearances, a friendly game, and the law is peculiarly
respectful to the rights of individuals, especially when those
individuals are in their own houses.</p>

<p>Anthony mentioned Jepburn's name casually when he made his
promised call.</p>

<p>'Jepburn?' said the lady in grey carelessly. 'Yes, I know him
slightly. He is rather amusing, and he knows all the best
people. I suppose you thought it was strange that he should be
my escort?'</p>

<p>Anthony smiled.</p>

<p>'I never think about such things,' he said, untruthfully, 'He
is not a friend of yours?'</p>

<p>'No!'</p>

<p>The answer was instant, and the vehemence in her tone was
unusual. She evidently realised this, for she went on in her
languid voice.</p>

<p>'Oh, no. There was to have been a big party, and really Lady
Mambury was my hostess, only three of the people, including Lady
Mambury, had influenza&mdash;it was rather tiresome.' He was
relieved and she was quick to notice. 'You don't like him?'</p>

<p>'I don't like or dislike,' said the diplomatic young man,
'but he has rather a reputation.'</p>

<p>'What sort of a reputation?' she asked.</p>

<p>Anthony was in a quandary. He had no wish that Mr Jepburn
should hear at second-hand that he was suspect.</p>

<p>'Well... one hears things. About his gambling clubs?'</p>

<p>She was silent. 'Is that... a fact? I mean, is it generally
believed that he is... that kind of person?'</p>

<p>'I shouldn't say "generally believed,"' he said, 'but that is
the impression I received.'</p>

<p>There was another silence.</p>

<p>'How perfectly dreadful,' she said at last. 'Does Mr Jepburn
know you?' Mr Jepburn did not know him, confessed Anthony. He
might have added his gratification, for it was essential to his
happiness and well-being that Mr Jepburn should be ignorant of
his identity.</p>

<p>Three nights later Anthony Newton came into contact with that
gentleman. Jepburn dined always at a famous restaurant and had a
table reserved for himself.</p>

<p>To this table one night came Anthony Newton, to all
appearances, a young man slightly drunk. And because he doggedly
refused to rise from the reserved table, and seemed willing and
able to create a scene, Mr Jepburn signalled to the head waiter
to let him remain.</p>

<p>'You seem a particularly determined young man,' said Mr
Jepburn, beaming over his gold-rimmed glasses.</p>

<p>'You bet I am,' replied Anthony, with a certain shrill accent
which was foreign to him. 'Say! I'm a democrat! I don't stand
for any of this reservation business. In my country all men are
equal. Get that!'</p>

<p>'You are an American?' said Mr Jepburn.</p>

<p>'I surely am,' replied Anthony, 'and I'll be mighty glad to
get back home again, for this is certainly the dullest little
village I have ever struck. Gee, it is about as bright as Gopher
Prairies! I guess you've read that book, mister?'</p>

<p>Mr Jepburn had never read any books except his passbook.</p>

<p>'You can't spend money in this little burg,' complained
Anthony. 'I'm going to Paris next week to see if I can't get one
small piece of gaiety into my system.'</p>

<p>Mr Jepburn was interested.</p>

<p>'It all depends upon what you call gaiety, hein? Some people
call one thing gay, some another. You can get anything if you
pay for it. Perhaps you cannot afford to pay, my frient.'</p>

<p>Anthony snorted.</p>

<p>'Can't afford to pay? Look here.' He thrust his hand into his
pocket and pulled out a great roll of notes, which Mr Jepburn
observed with peculiar interest. 'No, sir, this city is
certainly Deadville all right,' said Anthony. 'Why, I tried to
get some guys into a game at my hotel, and they thought I was a
burglar when I wanted to make it twenty pounds to open a
jack-pot! They surely did!'</p>

<p>Mr Jepburn's faded eyes wandered round the room, and
presently he saw one of his men. He beckoned him across.</p>

<p>'Meet my friend Mr&mdash;?'</p>

<p>'Swashbuck&mdash;Arthur B. Swashbuck, from Kansas City,' said
Anthony.</p>

<p>'My friend's name is Smith,' said Mr Jepburn. 'Maybe he can
show you round town, there are plenty of things to see,
hey?'</p>

<p>He glanced significantly at Mr Smith. Mr Smith agreed that
there were many things that ought to be seen.</p>

<p>'I will leave you two young men to talk,' said Mr Jepburn,
and shook hands sedately. 'Perhaps you will come and sit here
whenever you wish.'</p>

<p>'You bet I will,' said Anthony.</p>

<p>Mr Smith was a small-featured young man, immaculately
dressed.</p>

<p>'Who's that guy, anyway?' asked Anthony, looking after the
departing Jepburn.</p>

<p>'Oh, he's an old gentleman I have met several times, quite a
nice man,' said Smith, carelessly. 'How long are you staying in
London, Mr Swashbuck?'</p>

<p>'Well, it depends what London can give me,' said Anthony. 'It
is a blank city to me, so far.'</p>

<p>'It will not be blank after this night,' said Mr Smith with
conviction, and he led forth his victim to the slaughter.</p>

<p>Mr Smith was evidently a person of some social standing. His
car was small but beautiful to look upon. He had a chauffeur
excellently arrayed.</p>

<p>'There are a lot of places here that people know nothing
about,' said Smith, as they drove through the brightly lighted
streets, 'and a man could search without success from year in to
year out and never hit upon the bright spots. I am taking you
now to the house of a friend of mine, Mr Westbury Vach.'</p>

<p>'It is very kind of you,' said Anthony warmly.</p>

<p>'Not a bit,' replied the other. 'I have had so many
kindnesses shown to me by Americans that it is a pleasure to pay
back something I owe.'</p>

<p>Mr Westbury Vach's house was a large mansion in Cadogan
Gardens, and there was apparently a dance in progress. The big
saloon on the ground floor was crowded with prettily dressed
women and young and reputable men. Later, Anthony was introduced
into a saloon on the next floor, which was not so crowded.</p>

<p>'They play a little game here,' said Mr Smith carelessly.
'Trente-et-quarante. It is rather amusing to watch, but I
wouldn't advise you to play, although it is the straightest game
in London.'</p>

<p>It was also the smallest game that was played in any of Mr
Jepburn's houses. His establishments were graduated according to
the means of his victims...&mdash;</p>

<p>'Yes, it is a small game,' said Mr Smith apologetically.
'Come along, I'll show you another place.'</p>

<p>He had some friends, he explained in the car, a Mr and Mrs
Cresslewaite. Their house was in a street off Berkeley Square. A
footman admitted them and again Anthony found a dance in
progress; on the next floor, however, seated round a large green
table, were about fifty men and women, and here the game was
certainly more exciting.</p>

<p>'Yes, it is trente-et-quarante,' said Mr Smith, 'with a fifty
pound limit.'</p>

<p>At three o'clock that morning Anthony took leave of his
new-found friend. He was a hundred pounds poorer than he had been
when he started out, but he was more than a hundred pounds
richer in experience. He had seen four of Mr Jepburn's
houses.</p>

<p>Anthony Newton had a small city office. It served less as a
place of business than a rendezvous for certain poverty-stricken
young ex-officers of infantry, for now that Anthony had become
semi-prosperous there was always a whisky and soda for callers.
Here they forgathered, smoking until the air was thick and blue,
talking less of old battles than of new struggles; and on the
Monday morning following his exploits, Anthony, coming into the
office, found the room in the possession of five bright young
men who had shone on the battlefield, but whose glories were now
somewhat diminished.</p>

<p>'The fact is. Tony,' said Big Bill Farrel, 'there isn't a
ghost of a chance for us respectable murderers.'</p>

<p>Anthony surveyed the crowd in their shabby gratuity suits,
relics of those halcyon days when subalterns with a hundred
pounds' worth of bank notes in their pockets were as common as
blackberries in September, and he wondered and he grinned.</p>

<p>'I am rather glad to see you fellows here this morning,' he
said, 'and if you hadn't been here, I should have written to
most of you.'</p>

<p>'What's the idea, Tony?' asked Bill.</p>

<p>'Brigandage,' said Tony.</p>

<p>Bill sighed.</p>

<p>'I've got to the stage now,' he said, 'where I find myself
cutting black masks out of old socks and polishing up my Webley
in odd moments.'</p>

<p>There was a murmur of agreement.</p>

<p>'Nobody expects preferential treatment because one has been
through the war,' said Farrel. 'The only thing we ask is, that
it shouldn't be regarded as a drawback. I'm thinking seriously
of holding up the bank in my neighbourhood. It is run by three
conscientious objectors and a spiritualist!'</p>

<p>'You can cut that out,' said Tony promptly, 'and listen to
your uncle's new system of ethics. Smouching is an ancient and
honourable practice recognised in the best army circles, but it
can only be carried out in a gentlemanly manner if operations
are directed against a sap-headed government, a
quartermaster-general, or a recognised tyrant. Don't you fellows
recognise that the surplus of wealth is in the hands of two
classes&mdash;the honourable and the dishonourable&mdash;the
honest and the thief? And as there are quite a large surplus of
thieves to operate upon, you needn't worry about holding up a
post office or busting a bank! The thing is to find a man with
ill-gotten gains. If he is a murderer, too, so much the better.
We, being soldiers of considerable merit and valour, find
ourselves still at war with the enemies of honest finance and
lawful behaviour!'</p>

<p>'That is the line, Tony,' said Bob. 'But where is the
victim?'</p>

<p>'The victim is on view daily from seven until eight at
Parent's Restaurant. He is a bloodsucker, a blackmailer, a man
of no country, an eater-up of gratuities, and he is other things
as well.'</p>

<p>He looked round the crowded room at the youthful and eager
faces.</p>

<p>'Boys,' he said solemnly, 'my several names are Ali Baba,
Chu-Chin-Chow and Robin Hood, and I am getting together a band
for one performance only. The path of glory may lead you to
Wandsworth Gaol but it is unlikely. You will have the sympathies
of the public if you are pinched, though that might not prevent
your doing time. Are you with me?'</p>

<p>The yell they raised was very much resented by the indent
firm of solicitors that occupied the suite below.</p>

<p>'Go down and tell your boss,' said Anthony to the clerk who
was sent up to expostulate, 'that we are extremely sorry to have
inconvenienced him, and that if the worst comes to the worst he
is retained for the defence.'</p>

<p>The bewildered clerk went down with the message, which did
not enlighten his employer to any great extent.</p>

<p>On the following Wednesday night, when the street was
practically deserted, a large car drew up to the door of 903,
Cadogan Gardens. It was an old car, and it made wheezy noises.
It was entitled to utter some protest, for it was grossly
overloaded. From a body designed to hold four people, or five at
a squeeze, eight men descended.</p>

<p>Tony knocked at the door and it was opened by the liveried
servant. Before he could shout, before he could reach the little
bell in the wainscoting. Big Bill Farrel's hand was over his
mouth, he was jerked to the floor, and a voice whispered
horrific threats in his ear.</p>

<p>One man took his station at the door of the saloon where
dancing was in progress; the remainder, led by Anthony, raced up
the stairs into the gambling saloon.</p>

<p>'Keep quiet!' shouted Anthony in an authoritative voice, 'you
are all under arrest. Take that man, sergeant.' He pointed to
the shrinking croupier.</p>

<p>Instantly there was a babel of sound, a shriek, and a woman
fainted, but these were casualties which could not be avoided.
Anthony produced a large canvas bag from his pocket, swept all
the stock of money at the croupier's side into its depth, while
Bill Farrel marshalled the servants, and marching them into a
small adjoining room locked them in.</p>

<p>'I know all your names and addresses,' said Anthony, 'and I
do not intend arresting you to-night. You will remain here in
this room until my sergeant, who will be on guard outside,
allows you to go.'</p>

<p>Five minutes later the car was driving wildly to the house
off Berkeley Square. Here the procedure was the same, except
that the liveried man at the door made less resistance. Anthony
ran up the stairs and burst into the gambling room and stopped
dead.</p>

<p>For the first two people he saw were Jepburn and the lady in
grey. She sprang to her feet in alarm at the sight of the men
who crowded the doorway. Jepburn, less energetic, glared around
and rose more slowly.</p>

<p>'What is the meaning of this?' he asked, but Anthony did not
answer. He was looking at the girl, whose wide-eyed horror was
pathetic to see.</p>

<p>'The police,' she breathed and then Anthony woke from his
trance.</p>

<p>'All the players stand against the wall,' he commanded, and
in three strides he was at the croupier's side, and swept a huge
pile of bank notes into the open mouth of his bag. This done, he
rejoined the girl.</p>

<p>'I want to speak to you,' he said quietly.</p>

<p>He took her outside to the deserted landing.</p>

<p>'What are you doing here, Mrs Martin?' he asked quietly.</p>

<p>'I'm&mdash;I'm the new hostess,' she faltered.</p>

<p>'The new hostess?' repeated Anthony, unable to believe his
ears, 'what do you mean?'</p>

<p>'I'm in Jepburn's debt. He holds three thousand pounds' worth
of IOUs of mine,' she said and avoided his eyes.</p>

<p>'But I thought&mdash;' he began.</p>

<p>'You thought I was rich,' she said bitterly, 'but I'm not.
Poor Jim left very little money, and that I
have&mdash;spent.'</p>

<p>'This way?' he jerked his head to the room and she
nodded.</p>

<p>'Just wait.'</p>

<p>'He went back to Jepburn, expostulating in strange and
excited tones in a language which was half French and half
Polish, to the imperturbable Farrel. He turned a glance of hate
on Anthony.</p>

<p>'So you were the police all the time, eh? You were very
clever, hein! By God, if I had known who you were, I'd
have&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Shut up,' said Anthony. 'You've got some IOUs of Mrs
Martin's &mdash;where are they?'</p>

<p>The man's eyes narrowed.</p>

<p>'Why do you want them?' he said.</p>

<p>'It comes to this, Jepburn&mdash;I either put you where I can
find you and have you deported to your own country, or I
withdraw my men and say no more about this business, on
condition that you hand me Mrs Martin's IOUs.'</p>

<p>Mr Jepburn was a quick thinker.</p>

<p>'You shall have them,' he said, 'if you will accompany me to
my house. But what of the money you have taken&mdash;?'</p>

<p>'That is going to a charity,' said Anthony virtuously. 'The
Ex-Officers' Subsistence Fund.'</p> <hr>

</div><br>

<p class="first">'HUMAN nature,' said Anthony Newton, 'is
dominated by two vices &mdash;credulity and stupidity. It is
said that a fool is born every minute, which is true, but it
takes a long time for him to grow up, and the chances are that
somebody will skin him before you meet him.'</p>

<p>'Spoken like a heartless criminal,' said Big Bill Farrel
lazily.</p>

<p>They were at dinner at the Empress Hotel, and they were
dining on the fat of the land.</p>

<p>'I make these few remarks,' said Anthony, looking at his
cigar thoughtfully, 'because I have just come from an interview
with the amiable Inspector Parrit of Scotland Yard. Something of
an exploit, carried out apparently by persons with no particular
regard for the law, has come to the ears of the police. In other
words, the story is going around official circles than an
unofficial police force raided two gambling houses, got away
with eight thousand pounds, and added to the infamy of their
conduct by robbing Mr Jepburn, the noble proprietor, of certain
objects of art which took their fancy when they visited him in
his flat.'</p>

<p>'I didn't take the gold snuff box,' said Bill Farrel.</p>

<p>'I did,' admitted Anthony calmly. 'I have a passion for gold
snuff boxes set with rubies. Besides, it has an historical
interest. I believe it came down from one of the Czars. It was a
gift of Peter the Great to Mr Jepburn's ancestor. Not that Mr
Jepburn ever had an ancestor worth mentioning, but it is a
weakness of rich men to acquire ancestry at his time of
life.'</p>

<p>'What did the police say?' asked Farrel, interested.</p>

<p>'They knew I was the villain,' said Anthony coolly, 'and that
they hoped I wouldn't make a practice of impersonating the
constabulary. I asked whether it had been stated that the
raiders had described themselves as police at all, and he
admitted that they hadn't, and that it was the guilty
consciences of the ladies and gentlemen who patronised Mr
Jepburn's establishments, which led them to believe that the
eight stalwart and good looking men, who had marched so sternly,
who had interrupted so rudely their little game, had some
association with Scotland Yard.'</p>

<p>He chuckled softly.</p>

<p>'It isn't a laughing matter,' said the serious Bill. 'I'm
sure that that crazy Greek who attacked you the other night in
the street was set on the job by Jepburn.'</p>

<p>'You are not surer than I am,' said Anthony, carefully
removing the ashes of his cigar. In fact, I saw Jepburn this
morning, and told him that if it happened again, that a lunatic
foreigner tried to knife me on the King's highway, I should come
round to his flat with my confederates, tie him to a bed and
tickle the soles of his feet with feathers until he went
mad.'</p>

<p>Farrel gasped.</p>

<p>That's a pretty blood-thirsty threat.'</p>

<p>'He wouldn't understand any other,' said Anthony. 'These
eastern people are not to be dealt with in any other way. Where
is the gang?'</p>

<p>Bill grinned.</p>

<p>'The gang is enjoying its ill gotten gain according to its
several temperaments. Dinky Brown is opening a hat shop off
Regent Street. Tommy Barlow is working a new racing system.
Foreman has bought a pub.'</p>

<p>Anthony nodded.</p>

<p>'You didn't make much out of the job yourself,' said
Farrel.</p>

<p>'I got my whack,' replied Anthony, 'and quite enough for my
little investment.'</p>

<p>'Your investment?' said the puzzled Bill.</p>

<p>Anthony nodded, felt in his waistcoat pocket, and produced a
small newspaper cutting.</p>

<p>Bill took it from his hand and read:</p>

<p>'Sleeping partner wanted with a thousand pounds. Huge profit;
no risks. Apply Box 943 Daily Megaphone.'</p>

<p>'The gentleman's name is Yarrow,' explained Anthony, between
puffs at his cigar, 'and he is a bookmaker&mdash;'</p>

<p>'A bookmaker,' said the incredulous Bill.</p>

<p>Anthony nodded.</p>

<p>'A bookmaker with a fairly strange record. He has had other
partners who have put in a thousand pounds, only this time he is
not going to get a sleeping partner.'</p>

<p>'But what sense is there in investing a thousand pounds in a
shady bookmaker's business,' said Bill, 'besides, he won't have
any clients.'</p>

<p>'Oh yes he will,' said Anthony. 'He will have at least one
client. Yarrow's father,' he explained, 'is something big on the
Stock Exchange. He's big but he's a crook. In fact, he is as
much of a rascal as his son. But don't forget that, Bill,' he
emphasised his point with his cigar, 'that Yarrow senior is a
man of substance.'</p>

<p>'Mind you don't get stung,' warned Bill, and Anthony
smiled.</p>

<p>He had his interview with Mr Silvester Yarrow the following
morning. Mr Yarrow occupied two rooms on the third floor of a
building off Piccadilly. It was handsomely furnished and
equipped with the usual tape machine and telephone.</p>

<p>Mr Yarrow himself was a sleek, perfectly dressed young man,
whose hair was heavily brilliantined. He brought to the outer
office, to where he came to meet the newcomer, a delicate
fragrance of some exotic scent, and he offered a white, well
manicured hand to his caller.</p>

<p>'Good morning, Mr Newton,' he said with a smile. 'Will you
come into my office?'</p>

<p>Anthony followed him into a room which might more fittingly
and accurately have been described as a boudoir. Mr Yarrow liked
pretty things, hangings, heavy carpets of a peculiarly aesthetic
hue, heavy notepaper and purple sealing wax.</p>

<p>He was a thin, sallow-faced young man, with bright black
eyes, and his voice was gentle, even languorous.</p>

<p>'I don't keep a clerk. One can never trust those fellows,' he
explained. 'Now, Mr Newton, you have read my proposition: will
you come into the business?'</p>

<p>'That is my intention,' said Anthony, 'except&mdash;' Mr
Yarrow shot a swift glance at him. 'Except that I do not like
the idea of being just an investor; I should like to play some
active part.'</p>

<p>Mr Yarrow's eyes went down to the desk.</p>

<p>'Do you know anything about bookmaking&mdash;it is a
perfectly horrid profession and I am awfully ashamed of being
associated with it,' he said, 'but one must live.'</p>

<p>'I don't know anything about it at all,' said Anthony,
'except that people send you money to put on horses. If they
win, you pay them: and if they lose, they pay you.'</p>

<p>Mr Yarrow's smile was beatific.</p>

<p>'It is interesting, I admit it, devilishly interesting,' he
said. 'Very well, if you wish to work and if you do not mind
taking the desk at the outer office, I shall be happy for you to
play an active part. As I say, I have no clerk, and you will be
able to answer the telephone, open the telegrams, and make a
note upon a voucher form of all the bets which are made.'</p>

<p>It seemed a rather dull business to Anthony. The whole of the
afternoon nobody telephoned, no telegrams came.</p>

<p>'It is the first day of Newmarket,' explained Mr Yarrow,
'there is very little betting.' He looked at his watch. 'Go out
and have a cup of tea like a good chap, and when you come back,
I'll go.'</p>

<p>Anthony thought it an excellent idea. He was gone a quarter
of an hour and when he returned, the face of Mr Yarrow was long
and lugubrious.</p>

<p>'A perfectly vexing thing has happened,' he said. 'Just after
you went, a fellow named Bertie Feener called up and had fifty
on "Merriboy" and the infernal thing has won at six to one!'</p>

<p>'Fine,' said Anthony, watching him rise and disappear. The
next afternoon was much more busy. Strange people called on the
telephone, made bets of a very small amount, which were duly
recorded and reported to the head of the business, who sat at
ease in his scented room, polishing his nails incessantly. At
four o'clock Anthony went out for a cup of tea and was met by Mr
Yarrow on his return.</p>

<p>'That fellow Feener has got the devil's own luck,' he said.
'He's just had a hundred on a horse that started at four to
one!'</p>

<p>'Good business,' said Anthony heartily, 'I suppose you have
these runs of luck&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh yes,' said the other palpably relieved that his partner
had taken the matter so calmly. 'And then, of course, we get a
run of luck the other way, and thousands simply roll into the
office.'</p>

<p>On the following afternoon Anthony did not go out to tea.</p>

<p>'It is too expensive,' he said, 'and besides, I'd like to
talk to Bertie Feener.'</p>

<p>Mr Yarrow seemed a little uncomfortable. 'Hang the fellow,'
he said, 'I wish he'd have a thousand on a horse that wasn't
trying, but that's the sort of thing he'll never do.'</p>

<p>Apparently Bertie was not betting that day, for he did not
call up, and the few bets which were made over the telephone
showed a profit to the firm.</p>

<p>The fourth day was a Friday. About three o'clock in the
afternoon the bell rang, and Yarrow went hurriedly to the
telephone. Tony pretended to be very busy at his desk, but he
paid particular attention to the monosyllabic answers which the
usually voluble and polite Mr Yarrow was returning to the person
at the other end of the wire. Presently Mr Yarrow grew more
genial.</p>

<p>'Yes, old thing,' he said, 'certainly, old thing, I'll do so
with pleasure. Two hundred pounds you say, three hundred,
good!'</p>

<p>The tape at Tony's elbow began to whirr, then to tick
furiously. The result of the 2.30 race was coming through.</p>

<p>'Yes, yes... I'll lay it to you, three hundred
pounds&mdash;certainly.' Mr Yarrow glanced across at Tony and
whispered: 'What has won?'</p>

<p>'Black Emperor' said Tony, and a look of pain crept into Mr
Yarrow's face.</p>

<p>'Now, isn't that annoying? The devil's backed another
winner,' he said.</p>

<p>'Ask him if he's sure he meant "Black Emperor"?' hissed Tony,
with an agonised expression, and the obliging Mr Yarrow
nodded.</p>

<p>'Is that you Bertie?' he said, 'what was that horse you
wanted to back for three hundred? Black Emperor? You're sure?
You are certain that is the horse? Well, you lucky devil, it has
won!'</p>

<p>He hung up the receiver and came disconsolately across to the
tape.</p>

<p>'Isn't that exasperating?' he asked. His tone suggested
enthusiasm rather than sorrow. 'Just my luck to have him back
the horse a minute before the message came through.'</p>

<p>He glanced at the tape and his face changed.</p>

<p>'Black Emperor didn't win,' he said sharply. 'Rare-bell
won.'</p>

<p>'My mistake,' said Anthony coolly.</p>

<p>By Mr Yarrow's annoyance it almost seemed that he was sorry
the firm of Yarrow had won three hundred pounds.</p>

<p>'Deuced careless of you, old fellow,' he said, trying hard to
recover some of his natural politeness. 'I told Bertie it had
won. He may take away his business from us.'</p>

<p>'That would break my heart,' said Anthony.</p>

<p>He saw Bill Farrel that night.</p>

<p>'How's it going?' said Bill.</p>

<p>'Fine,' said Tony with enthusiasm. 'But Yarrow has no clients
at all. He fakes them while I'm out. The whole thing is
deliciously simple. As soon as my back turns, some mythical
person telephones through a winner which takes four or five
hundred out of my pocket. When my funds are exhausted, friend
Yarrow will get another partner.'</p>

<p>'Who is this Bertie Feener?'</p>

<p>'There is no "Bertie Feener"&mdash;he is like Mrs Harris.
When Yarrow was having that delightful conversation which
resulted in his friend backing "Black Emperor," his finger was
on the phone rest. He had finished the real conversation with
whoever it was three minutes before.'</p>

<p>The next afternoon, to Mr Yarrow's surprise, as it was a big
race day, Anthony went out to tea. Before he went, he asked a
rather important question.</p>

<p>'Have you a limit to the bets you lay to Mr Feener?' he
asked.</p>

<p>'No,' said the other with a smile. 'It wouldn't be advisable,
would it, old boy, when he is so much in our debt? No, give the
jolly old rascal enough rope and he'll hang himself.'</p>

<p>On Anthony's return Mr Yarrow had a tale of sorrow to relate.
He was stalking up and down the office giving evidence of great
mental distress.</p>

<p>'Confound that beastly chap,' he moaned. I wish to heaven I'd
never had his name on the books.'</p>

<p>'Bertie Feener?' asked Anthony innocently. 'What has he
done?'</p>

<p>'Had two hundred on a four to one chance! You had hardly got
down the stairs before the beggar rung up. At first I thought of
turning him down, and then like a fool I laid him the bet.'</p>

<p>'So we lost eight hundred pounds?' asked Anthony
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Mr Yarrow nodded.</p>

<p>'It is beastly hard luck on you, old boy,' he said. 'Such a
thing has never happened in this office before. Why, we've
practically lost over a thousand pounds this week.'</p>

<p>'It can't be helped,' said Anthony cheerfully. 'Go and get
your tea, Yarrow, I'll make the cheque out to Mr Feener if you
will give me his address when you come back.'</p>

<p>Mr Yarrow bounced forth gaily.</p>

<p>The last race had been run and the result had been through
twenty minutes when he returned.</p>

<p>'Well, old boy, anything happened?' he asked cheerfully, as
he hung up his hat.</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Anthony, 'Bertie Feener came through and had
twelve hundred pounds on "Blue Diamond." We are square with
Bertie now.'</p>

<p>Mr Yarrow looked at him open-mouthed. 'Bertie Feener did
what?' he asked hollowly. It was as though he could not believe
his ears.</p>

<p>'He had twelve hundred pounds on "Blue Diamond". It was
beaten in the last race but one,' said Anthony confidentially.
'As a matter of fact, he rang up just as you were going down the
stairs, and for a moment I hesitated as to whether I should lay
him the bet, but then realising that you had no limit, I thought
we'd take a chance. Congratulations, partner.'</p>

<p>He put out his hand, but Mr Yarrow did not take it.</p>

<p>'But Bertie Feener went away to the country: he caught the
four o'clock train, in fact, he told me so when I was talking to
him this afternoon on the telephone.'</p>

<p>'He telephoned from the railway station,' said Anthony
calmly.</p>

<p>Mr Yarrow's sallow face was white.</p>

<p>'Very good,' he said.</p>

<p>'I don't think we'll have these telephone bets. It is much
more satisfactory if our clients send telegrams,' said
Anthony.</p>

<p>'Very good,' said Mr Yarrow shortly.</p>

<p>'How providential it was,' mused Anthony, 'that I was here
when Bertie called! May I call him Bertie? You don't think he
would be very much annoyed, do you?'</p>

<p>Mr Yarrow at his desk did not raise his eyes.</p>

<p>'If you had been here you might have hesitated about laying
such a huge wager,' said Anthony. 'Happily we are all square on
the week.'</p>

<p>'I don't see how you can do a telegraph business,' Mr Yarrow
was stung into saying. 'No starting price offices accept more
than fifty up to the time the race starts, and very few accept
that.'</p>

<p>'Let us be the exception,' said Anthony, and he saw a glad
light come into his partner's eyes.</p>

<p>'Why not,' said Anthony recklessly, 'give them an option of
putting a thousand or two thousand up to the "off" as long as
they sign their names to their telegrams and we know them. Why,
Yarrow, we might get a tremendous business that way!'</p>

<p>'So we might,' said Mr Yarrow with a return to his old
cheerfulness. 'I'll think it out and let you know on Monday
morning.'</p>

<p>On Monday morning Mr Yarrow was almost gay.</p>

<p>'You are a deuced clever fellow, Newton,' he said. 'I've been
thinking it out, and your scheme is a jolly good idea. I
consulted my governor, who doesn't approve of this business, as
you can well understand, and he says it is an excellent notion.
He does a bit of racing himself, Newton, in fact, he owns a half
a dozen horses, and he says that if we are willing to make those
terms, he is quite willing to put all his business in our hands.
We'll have a new code typewritten and sent to our clients, so
that they can wire to the fullest extent without exciting
comment. What do you say to that?'</p>

<p>To judge by Tony Newton's attitude, facial expression and
gurgling speech, he was beside himself with delight.</p>

<p>'We'll try it anyway for a week,' he said. 'On Wednesday I
have to go down into Gloucester, but there is nothing much
happening on Wednesday.'</p>

<p>'There is racing at Hurst Park,' said the other, breathing
heavily and trying to appear wholly indifferent. 'But we shan't
have any very heavy betting on that day. There is nothing to bet
on. To what part of Gloucester are you going?'</p>

<p>'To Gloucester itself. I shall be back by night. Will you
send me a telegram if anything unusual happens?'</p>

<p>Anthony left by the ten o'clock train which had the advantage
of stopping at Reading. Mr Yarrow who, to make absolutely sure,
had come down to Paddington to see his partner safely out of
London, did not know about the stop at Reading.</p>

<p>'It is deuced curious my being here,' he said, at the
carriage door, 'but I've got to meet an aunt who is coming up
from Cardiff in a quarter of an hour, so I thought I'd stroll
round and have a look at you. What time will you be back?'</p>

<p>'About six o'clock to-night,' said Anthony. 'I shall only be
an hour in the town.'</p>

<p>At Reading he chartered a taxi to carry him the not very
considerable distance which separated him from Hurst Park. Mr
Yarrow senior did not know Anthony, but Anthony knew Mr Yarrow
senior. A tallish, bent man, with a loose lip and a pendulous
nose, Mr Yarrow had, in his day, many choice adventures which,
were he writing the recollections of his racing career, he would
never have put into print. A Justice of the Peace, a prospective
candidate for Parliament, his wealth was held to atone for the
method by which it was secured. Not that Mr Yarrow was ever
guilty nowadays of the indiscretion which had made his name a
term of reproach in the best sporting and book-making
circles.</p>

<p>The third race of the day was one of those events which are
frequently found on the card at most big meetings, a Foal Plate
for horses which had been entered as yearlings by their
optimistic owners. Three years after their entry, all that had
survived the severe test of the racecourse, met to do battle for
a thousand pound trophy. There remained exactly three horses of
the original ninety-five entered, and it was on this race, as
Anthony had guessed, when he searched the programme, that Mr
Yarrow would help assist his son to the fulfilment of his
heart's desire &mdash;which was the acquirement of Anthony's
thousand pounds.</p>

<p>Of the three horses left, obviously only two had a chance.
The third, as he had proved on every racecourse in England,
might have won a selling race if the class had been extremely
poor, but Mr Yarrow was taking no chances.</p>

<p>Tony, watching him, with his back to the unsaddling
enclosure, saw him take down three telegraph forms and write on
each. He wormed his way into the field immediately behind
Yarrow, and saw the old man pass the three forms into the cubby
hole where the clerk sat. They were all addressed to 'Yoxi,
London,' Mr Yarrow's telegraphic address, and they each had a
name of a different horse with a code word 'Yail', which Yarrow
and he had agreed should stand for two thousand pounds.</p>

<p>There is no sin in backing three horses in one race. Many
sportsmen have done this and are still walking about, though
sadly deficient in shoe leather. There was nothing exactly
criminal in backing three horses in a race where there were only
three runners. It is, to put it mildly, foolish, but it is not
sinful.</p>

<p>Anthony strolled into the ring.</p>

<p>'Bird's Eye' was favourite, and an odds on favourite:
'Morton's Pride' was second favourite, two to one against, and
the third horse was quoted at twenty to one.</p>

<p>He stood in the ring and watched the race being run. It was
less of a race than a procession, for 'Bird's Eye' led from
start to finish, and won in a canter.</p>

<p>Satisfied, Anthony went back to London and at a quarter past
six strolled into his office.</p>

<p>Mr Yarrow made no attempt to conceal his gratification.</p>

<p>'Old boy, we are done in the eye!' he said.</p>

<p>'What has happened?' asked Anthony.</p>

<p>'My governor had two thousand on "Bird's Eye". It is
unfortunate, old chap, but there, what can you do? Here is the
telegram, time all correct.'</p>

<p>Anthony took the telegram.</p>

<p>'Yes,' he said, 'that's in order.'</p>

<p>'We've lost a thousand, and that's just about burst the till,
unless you can get a little more capital,' said Mr Yarrow.</p>

<p>'I reckon that we've made three thousand,' said Anthony
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>'What do you mean?' gasped Yarrow.</p>

<p>'Where are the other two telegrams your father sent?' asked
Tony.</p>

<p>Mr Yarrow Hushed red.</p>

<p>'What the devil do you mean?' he demanded, but Anthony
stopped him with a gesture.</p>

<p>'Your father sent three wires, one backing each horse. The
only chance of his winning from us would have been if an
outsider had come in first. As a matter of fact, he finished so
far last, that I doubt if he has passed the winning post yet.
You will greatly oblige me, Yarrow, if you call on your parent
this evening and tell him that unless three thousand pounds is
placed in my hands by to-morrow morning, I will have you both
arrested for conspiracy to defraud. I am well aware, and you
need not tell me, that it is in itself a felony to demand money
by threats of prosecution, but there it is, Yarrow; I am sinning
with my eyes open.'</p>

<p>'I tell you there were no other telegrams,' screamed the
young man.</p>

<p>'There are two others,' said Anthony, patiently, 'but you
have burnt them or got rid of them some way. They are probably
in your trouser pocket, crumpled up. Anyway, that's an easy
thing to find out, because the post office would give me copies
of all the telegrams your father sent from Hurst Park. Now be a
good lad and see the old man, and tell him I give him till
twelve o'clock, failing which, I will go to Scotland Yard and
swear an information. And,' he added, standing at the door as he
walked out, 'tell your fond parent that I prefer bank notes of
small denomination.'</p> <hr>

<br>

<p class="first">NO man,' said Tony Newton oracularly, 'was ever
ruined by taking small profits.'</p>

<p>'Seems familiar to me,' said Pinkey. 'I must have read it in
a book.'</p>

<p>They were dining together at the Sorbet, which, in spite of
its name, was known by press, police and punters, the three
supreme estates of the realm, as 'hot'. About the Sorbet a story
can be told, though, for the moment, that page may be
skipped.</p>

<p>'The curious thing about me,' said the reminiscent Tony, 'is
that I'm never beaten. I've made money out of the greatest
besters in town; I've diddled confidence men and I've had money
from a moneylender who went to bed Stahlstein and woke to find
himself one of the proud Macgregors, and never even paid him
back. I have met in single combat the Scot and the Armenian, and
I have wrenched from their maws the wherewithal to live. The pup
that other men buy licks my hand and develops into a pedigree
show dog.'</p>

<p>'The funny thing about you,' said Pinkey, 'is your unblushing
modesty.'</p>

<p>Pinkey Stephens was a lawyer who lived in the Temple and
earned a very good living from writing love stories for cheap
magazines. From his practice as a barrister-at-law of the Middle
Temple, he derived an income which was more than sufficient to
pay for his cigarettes and nearly covered his bus-fares.</p>

<p>Pinkey was young and bald. From brow to occiput he was all
shining pink. He smoked a big pipe and never rode on buses.</p>

<p>'I'm sorry to hear you say that,' said Tony thoughtfully. 'I
always thought that diffidence was my weakness. Maybe I'm wrong.
But there is the fact. I founded my slender fortune on taking
money from a crowd of crooks. Success begets success. The name
of the competent man flashes from lip to lip. For example, I
have been sent for by an eminent city firm to carry out delicate
negotiations when, apparently, other&mdash;I will not say
"better"&mdash;men have failed.'</p>

<p>'Who sent for you&mdash;Rothschilds?' asked Pinkey, and Tony
shook his head.</p>

<p>'I am not at liberty to say,' he replied gravely, as he rose
from the table, leaving Pinkey to pay the bill. 'Excuse me if I
rush off; I have some papers to&mdash;look through.'</p>

<p>'I haven't read the Star either,' said Pinkey. 'What won that
apprentice race?'</p>

<p>Tony Newton had his weaknesses. He admitted them, but in such
a manner as to suggest that they were in reality the
underpinnings of strength. The most deplorable of these was his
passion for beauty. It was, he often said, a purely detached
passion and wholly impersonal.</p>

<p>He saw the plum pudding girl as he came downstairs from his
expensive bedroom in Russell Square next morning, and wondered
why, if Nature insisted upon creating anything quite as helpless
as a girl, she did not make a. good job of it and create
something good to look at. And the plum pudding girl was not
good to look at. She was plump and dumpy. Her hair had the
appearance of having been dressed with a vacuum cleaner; there
was a certain irregularity of complexion which suggested that
she had been sunburnt through a strainer; and when she smiled,
as she frequently did, for she had a friendly disposition, she
told all the world that the interior of a dental parlour was
<i>terra incognita</i>.</p>

<p>'Who is the beauty?' asked Tony of the porter.</p>

<p>'Miss Jibble, sir&mdash;Miss Eliza Jibble.'</p>

<p>'She looks it,' said Tony ungallantly.</p>

<p>He thought of her as the plum pudding girl&mdash;a plum
pudding made by a cook who wasn't really a cook, but was taking
the cook's place whilst she was on a holiday.</p>

<p>The first time he had seen her was in the lounge. Miss Jibble
was taking tea with a dark, fat young man and a very stout and
elderly woman who must have been Miss Jibble's mother. She
afforded the only possible explanation for Miss Jibble. Mrs
Jibble wore diamonds wherever diamonds could be worn.</p>

<p>They were talking together eagerly and in low tones when he
came opposite the curtained opening. Standing there, he saw the
young man pinch Miss Jibble's ear playfully, and Tony
shuddered.</p>

<p>'You'll 'ave to take that off, Liz,' said Miss Jibble's
mother, and at that moment the plum pudding girl, looking up,
saw Tony and snatched her plump hand from the table.</p>

<p>All this Tony noted idly as he passed out of the hotel. This
happened a few days before he knew her name and before there
came to him the extraordinary commission from Tanker and
Tanker.</p>

<p>Tony was comparatively well off, and was determined to be
weller. He had that sublime faith in himself which is the chief
asset of the general and the commercial traveller. Tony felt
that, if there was anything easier than winning a battle, it was
selling a line of last year's hats to an open-air colony that
wore sandals, went bareheaded, and lived exclusively on love and
monkey-nuts.</p>

<p>He had found the world, on his return from active service, a
hard and bitter place, plastered with notices that read: 'No
ex-officer or ex-convict need apply.' Yet he applied, being
one and seriously considering the advisability of being the
other.</p>

<p>Leaving the hotel, he walked briskly cityward, swinging a
nearly gold-headed cane and glancing from time to time at his
fine platinum watch. His dark suit was new. He wore a black
homburg and carried pigskin gloves.</p>

<p>The office of Tanker and Tanker is up a narrow flight of
stairs leading from almost as narrow a side street in the city
of London, where, from morning until night, three heavy vans
obstruct the traffic and make the road impassable except for the
attenuated and the reckless. The city is full of such streets,
and each street has its three vans and its gloomy drivers,
waiting doggedly for the van ahead to sink through the earth.
Tony went up the stairs two at a time, squeezed himself through
a door that was just big enough to make the interior draughty
and, by manoeuvring his feet, came to the high counter where,
behind a brass grille, sat a woman who, Tony liked to believe,
had once been a barmaid and had seen better times.</p>

<p>'Mr Tanker is expecting you; will you step in?' she asked
sadly, and Tony went sideways through another door and into a
room which overlooked the vans.</p>

<p>An elderly man at the worn desk looked over his glasses at
the visitor.</p>

<p>'Ah, Mr Newton: come in, come in. What a glorious day, what a
glorious day!'</p>

<p>'It is, it is,' said Tony.</p>

<p>Mr Tanker had a peculiar habit of repeating almost every
commonplace he uttered.</p>

<p>'Sit down, sit down. Now, Mr Newton, I think I can settle
this business in a very short time&mdash;a very short time. I
wrote to you because I'd heard about you,' said Mr Tanker,
speaking very rapidly. 'Young man, eh? Young man? Full of life
and go and all that sort of thing? Got money?'</p>

<p>'I have a little,' said Tony modestly.</p>

<p>'Of course you have! My friend Belter told me that you were
thinking of buying up the Medusa Hotel.'</p>

<p>Tony had thought of buying up many hotels. In his spare time
he cultivated estate agents and his room was full of their
publications. And beautiful publications they were, showing, as
they did, photographically (and on art paper) a view of The Hall
from the Park, a glimpse of the Rosery from the Terrace, the
Banqueting Room from the Music Gallery, and the Gardens from
almost anywhere. He used to lie in bed and open his mail,
undecided as to whether he would be happy at Fothingay Manor
('383 acres: more can be acquired, 4 cottages: every modern
convenience') or at Soke Priory ('Owner has spent nearly 10,000
on improvements. Sandy soil and glorious view of the
Chilterns').</p>

<p>And then he used to get out of bed and check his passbook to
make absolutely sure whether the bank manager, in writing that
he was £1 7s 4d overdrawn, wasn't guilty of the grossest
libel.</p>

<p>'Yes; but I'm not buying property just now,' said Tony. He
had no idea that Tanker and Tanker were house agents. Their
letterhead had simply said 'General and Confidential Agency'.
And there is nothing confidential about an estate agent. He has
no reticence whatever except about defective drains and leaking
roofs.</p>

<p>'I see, I see,' said Mr Tanker, not for a moment put out.
'And really, Mr Newton, I think you are wise. I think you are
wise. House Property is a drug in the market and a bad
investment, a bad investment.'</p>

<p>He wasn't an estate agent, Tony decided.</p>

<p>'What I want to see you about is a very delicate matter. I
will make a confession to you, shall I&mdash;shall I?'</p>

<p>'Do, do,' said Tony.</p>

<p>'I came to your hotel last night specially to see you! Not to
speak to you, oh no, oh no! I just wanted to see you. I am a
remarkable judge of character. I wasn't sure that you were the
right kind of man. Not even after I had your letter. But now I
know. Mr Newton, you are the man; you are the man.'</p>

<p>He extended his hand. Tony took it. Even though it was
empty.</p>

<p>'Now here is the case in a nutshell,' said Mr Tanker briskly.
'We are not lawyers, I and my son: I have been a solicitor,
but&mdash;well, I'm not now. There was an unfortunate happening,
years ago&mdash;I was not responsible, being abroad at the time,
and I was made a scapegoat. But no matter, no matter!'</p>

<p>He waved his hand airily: such a little thing as having been
struck off the rolls was not worth discussing.</p>

<p>'But although we are not lawyers, we have clients. People of
title, people of immense wealth. Immense! And naturally, we have
some curious and remarkable commissions.'</p>

<p>'Naturally,' said Tony with great heartiness. 'Anything over
ten per cent is both remarkable and curious.'</p>

<p>Mr Tanker frowned.</p>

<p>'I am not referring to&mdash;er&mdash;monetary commissions:
no, no. Although we are paid well and pay well.'</p>

<p>He opened a drawer of his desk and took out a bundle of
papers tied with red tape. The tape he did not remove, but
looked up at Tony. 'Have you ever written love letters?' he
asked unexpectedly.</p>

<p>'Hundreds,' said Tony. 'I might even say thousands.'</p>

<p>Mr Tanker nodded.</p>

<p>'Would you, for a fee, let us say £20 a letter, write love
letters to one whom you have not seen&mdash;let me explain,' he
said as he saw the look of blank astonishment on the other's
face. 'My client is a wealthy widow: she has a daughter, young,
gloriously beautiful, romantic. Unfortunately this unhappy girl
has formed an attachment for the chauffeur of Her
Grace&mdash;forget that I said "Her Grace" and think of her only
as a woman of the world. My client has sent away the chauffeur.
The girl is pining. She is not in love with him&mdash;she is in
love with love, if you understand what I mean.'</p>

<p>He stopped and eyed his visitor pathetically.</p>

<p>'What do you want me to do?' asked Tony, who was now
intrigued.</p>

<p>'Write to her: say that you have seen her in the park. Tell
her the very sight of her&mdash;is&mdash;er sunshine and all
that sort of stuff. Say you&mdash;er&mdash;prostrate yourself at
her feet. Dear me, dear me, you know what to write: We want to
get the chauffeur out of the girl's life: we want to drive his
memory forth. Le clou chase les autres. My French is bad, but
you understand: "One nail drives out another." The only question
is, and I am being perfectly frank with you, is your style
sufficiently flowery?'</p>

<p>'Don't worry about that,' said Tony. 'I've got a style that
makes flowers look like watercress. Do I sign the letters?'</p>

<p>Mr Tanker shrugged his thin shoulders.</p>

<p>'An initial would do: you can sign if you wish. I don't want
the girl to fall in love with you, Mr Newton. She is an heiress
in her own right, and that would mean complications. The only
thing I demand is that you shall not see her without my consent,
and that all letters come through me.'</p>

<p>'I'll think about it,' said Tony.</p>

<p>That night he wrote to Mr Tanker and enclosed a sample
letter. It described at length the physiological reactions which
had followed his first glance at her 'flower face'. It described
the action of his heart and pulse that she had produced, with
the exactitude one might have expected from an enthusiastic
medical student after his first clinic. He mentioned how his
brain reeled and the colour of the world toned up three shades,
and he spoke of the memory that he had carried to his lonely
room and how he treasured one little blade of grass that she had
trodden with her fairy feet.</p>

<p>The reply came by hand. It was a letter containing twenty £1
notes. Later in the morning, Mr Tanker rang him up.</p>

<p>'Excellent: pray continue. The second letter, if I may
suggest, should be just a trifle more passionate&mdash;just a
trifle. And in re blade of grass: the lady keeps to the paths,
which are asphalt. You don't mind my mentioning this?'</p>

<p>'I am greatly obliged,' said Tony. 'Do I get any reply?'</p>

<p>'It is possible,' said the diplomatic Tanker. 'If any come
they will be forwarded.'</p>

<p>The answer arrived two days later. It was ecstatic. It told
him that already the memory of a horrid affair had almost faded
from her mind. And how she longed to see her unknown lover. Was
he ever at Baden-Baden or Aix?</p>

<p>Tony looked up the hotel Bradshaw to find the cost of living
at these resorts. He wrote again, and the second letter covered
ten sheets. When he received from Tanker the twenty pounds, he
felt that it was a shame to take the money. The third letter
went on the following Sunday. It was a Nature letter and dealt
familiarly with the stars, moon and skies, lilies, clouds,
roses, scented nights, seas, winds (gentle), dreams, visions and
Baden-Baden.</p>

<p>Within twenty-four hours a letter came to him. It was the
outpourings of a young and girlish heart; it spoke of dogs,
dresses, bishops, love, motor-cycles, heaven, hair-styles, death
and marrons glacees.</p>

<p>Tony choked as he read and, without one mercenary thought,
sat up half the night replying, and was only stopped when the
supply of stationery ran out. He sent the letter off next day to
Tanker. The porter, weighing the package in his hand, suggested
that it would be cheaper to send it by parcel post.</p>

<p>The day passed slowly; the morning brought no balm to his
anguished soul. He loved her, this little duchess. Her name was
Phyllis. Lady Phyllis Blank. He sat back in his chair, dreaming
of her. The limpid purity of her grave blue eyes. The glory of
her golden hair. He knew that she was petite and beautiful, with
a complexion that was like ivory. She sang, of course. He
pictured her in a dusky room with French windows that opened to
the slope of the lawn. Far away, the wooded hills stood purple
against the amethystine skies. And she was playing a strange
tune, plaintive, sad with the sadness of dead years and loves
that were yet fragrant memories.</p>

<p>On the third day, the letter came, and to his surprise it
came direct to him. 'Anthony Newton, Esq', and his address. The
first words thrilled him.</p>

<p>'<i>My own darling dream boy</i>,' it began. She wanted to
see him, to be near him. She wanted to look into his eyes and
hear the soft caress of his voice&mdash;</p>

<p>Tony wiped his forehead and smiled seraphically&mdash;yet
tenderly. He was all in all to her. Relations, wealth, even
amorous chauffeurs, were as nothing. And so it went on until the
postscript.</p>

<p>There was a postscript.</p><br>

<p class="letter">'Oh, Anthony, what am I to do? My mother has
found one of your letters, and my dear brother is furious. He
says that I must marry you at once.'</p><br>

<p>Anthony staggered for a second. He was in his room, happily.
He would have hated to be seen dithering in public.</p><br>

<p class="letter">'He says there was an excuse for the chauffeur
holding my hand when he was driving, and he even forgave him for
the damage he did to the radiator when the car hit the tree, but
he cannot and will not forgive me. He is turning me out!
Anthony, I come to you, my love!'</p><br>

<p>Tony crushed the letter into his pocket, thrust his hat upon
his head and went down the stairs at a rush.</p>

<p>He seized the porter.</p>

<p>'If any woman comes here and asks for me&mdash;I'm out. Went
abroad yesterday. If a man comes, tell him I went abroad last
week. If she asks you whether I'm rich, say no! If she says: "Is
he good-looking?" say NO!'</p>

<p>'I can easily say that, sir,' said the porter.</p>

<p>Tony jumped into the first taxi that he found and rode
furiously cityward. The street in which the office of Tanker and
Tanker was situated was blocked by three dark brown vans. Numbly
Tony recalled that last time there were three dark red vans. He
squeezed into the outer office and without a word to the
prisoner behind the grille, turned the handle and fell into Mr
Tanker's presence. And Mr Tanker looked at him over his glasses
and beamed.</p>

<p>'Come for your money, Mr Newton? I was just about to send
it&mdash;to send it.'</p>

<p>'No.' Tony was breathless. 'I haven't&mdash;don't want money.
She wants to marry me!'</p>

<p>'The lady you were writing to? Of course!'</p>

<p>'What!' screeched Tony.</p>

<p>'Of course, of course! What is wrong?'</p>

<p>'Her brother found my letters. Now Mr Tanker, you've got to
get me out of this. I want a note from you stating the
circumstances under which I wrote to her.'</p>

<p>Mr Tanker shook his head sorrowfully. 'That would be
betraying the confidence of a client. I will go further and say
this, Mr&mdash;er &mdash;Newton: that I shall deny any knowledge
of the business. You were well paid for any risk you took. I am
sorry&mdash;very sorry. But I do not know you officially.'</p>

<p>Tony sat in the chair and gasped.</p>

<p>'The confidence of a client is a sacred trust,' Mr Tanker
went on soberly. 'We would no more dream of betraying that
confidence than&mdash;er&mdash;we should dream of standing on
our heads&mdash;our heads.'</p>

<p>'But I'll take you into court, you old scoundrel!' said
Anthony in a fury; and Mr Tanker smiled sadly.</p>

<p>'How? It is impossible. You would find it difficult even to
get my name mentioned&mdash;except that you might make certain
charges, if &mdash;er&mdash;a breach of promise case came along.
But there would be no proof. Perhaps, no breach of promise
case.'</p>

<p>'Who is this woman?' demanded Tony, mastering his
emotions.</p>

<p>'She is a lady of a very good family and she loves you. Make
no mistake about that&mdash;she loves you. In fact, she loves
you so much that she spent a week at your hotel, long
before&mdash;er&mdash;she induced us to approach you.'</p>

<p>'Hotel... good family,' repeated Tony hollowly, and Mr Tanker
nodded. 'She is a Miss Jibble&mdash;one of the Jibbles of Stoke
Poges&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Jibble!' The young man's voice was hoarse. 'The plum pudding
girl?'</p>

<p>'I see you have met her,' said Mr Tanker complacently. 'I see
you have met her: you might do worse. She is a very comfortable
girl.'</p>

<p>Tony went down the stairs very slowly and stood in a dazed
condition on the edge of the pavement between two of the
dark-brown vans. He thought of Pinkey, and bent his steps toward
the quiet of Temple Gardens.</p>

<p>Pinkey did not welcome visitors at any time, and it was a
long while before he would open the door to Tony, being under
the impression that the caller was a client. He never saw
clients if he could help it.</p>

<p>'Hullo!' he said ungraciously. 'What do you want?'</p>

<p>'Pinkey, I'm ruined, old boy,' groaned Tony, and the lawyer
was alarmed.</p>

<p>'You haven't come here for legal advice, have you?' he asked
anxiously. 'I've practically chucked the law, since the
Megaphone bought "Sundered Souls". Have a drink?'</p>

<p>Tony shook his head.</p>

<p>'Do you know Tanker?' he asked, and Mr Stephens brightened
up. It so happened that Tanker was one of the few people he did
know outside a certain literary circle that met in the bar of
the Green Dragon and discussed the weather and the three o'clock
race, and cures for dyspepsia, and other matters pertaining to
art and the higher life.</p>

<p>Tanker was a lawyer. He was kicked out because he did
something shady, before I was born. Now he runs a matrimonial
bureau&mdash;'</p>

<p>Tony uttered a deep, shuddering groan.</p>

<p>'Suppose you've got a daughter and can't get her off,' Pinkey
went on, warming to his subject. 'You call in old man Tanker.
It's a great idea; I'm going to make a story about it one of
these days and call it "A Wife by Arrangement."'</p>

<p>'Don't let us discuss your plans,' begged Tony. 'What happens
when you call in Tanker?'</p>

<p>'He finds a husband. He's the most ingenious devil in the
world. He lands the most unexpected coups. He was the fellow
that married Lola Sabino, the Girl with the Swansdown
Feet&mdash;married her to Lord Pinnutt&mdash;she's Lola Countess
of Pinnutt now; got a house in Regent's Park and never speaks to
anybody who hasn't been to Eton. Then he got that girl whose
mother was in the old clothes business and paired her up with
Leslie Majest, the film star. Then&mdash;'</p>

<p>'How does he do it?' wailed Tony.</p>

<p>Here Pinkey could give no information.</p>

<p>'It's a mystery. Most people think that old Tanker mixes
matrimony with blackmail. All his matches aren't made. Some of
'em are broken off at the last minute by arrangement with the
old man. I happen to know all about him because he caught a pal
of mine, a fellow with pots of money. His father was in the
brass business.'</p>

<p>'How did he catch him?'</p>

<p>'It was so simple that I can't understand how Bob fell,' said
Pinkey scornfully. This old bird got Bob to write some love
letters to an unknown girl&mdash;what's the matter?'</p>

<p>'Nothing!' said Tony hastily. 'How did he persuade him?'</p>

<p>'Said she was just getting over a love affair and wanted an
interest in life. Said the father would pay. Naturally, Bob
jumped at the chance. There isn't a man in the world who doesn't
think he can write much better than the next man. That poor gink
fell absolutely in love with her&mdash;until he saw her. It cost
him five thousand to save a breach of promise case. How he could
have been such a blithering fool&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes, we know all about that,' said Tony testily. 'Let
me think.'</p>

<p>Pinkey opened his blue eyes.</p>

<p>'Good Lord! He hasn't caught you?' he gasped.</p>

<p>'Nobody has ever caught me,' snarled Tony. 'Don't worry: I'm
thinking how I can catch him.'</p>

<p>And then suddenly he smiled, as he remembered something.
Tony's memory was one of his assets.</p>

<p>He went back to his hotel. A lady had called and asked for
him: she was waiting in the lounge with her mother.</p>

<p>'Miss Jibble, sir. She was staying here a week ago: you
remember?' asked the porter.</p>

<p>'Ask them to come up to my room,' said Tony gravely.</p>

<p>He was hardly in his little sitting-room before there came a
knock at the door. '<i>Entrez</i>,' said Tony foreignly.</p>

<p>Miss Jibble came in, blinking shyly, seemingly agitated. Mrs
Jibble was pompous and awful.</p>

<p>'Sit down.' said Tony.</p>

<p>'I shall not sit down,' said the elderly lady. She had a deep
bass voice that made the windows rattle. 'I shall stay no longer
in this home of licence and heartlessness than is
necessary.'</p>

<p>'Oh, mother, spare him,' said Miss Jibble convulsively. 'I am
sure he is good. Tell her, Anthony.'</p>

<p>'You have tampered with the affections of a young and
innocent child. I demand from you an explanation.'</p>

<p>'No explanation is necessary,' said Tony. 'I saw your
daughter in the park and, struck by her transcendent beauty,
fell madly in love with her.'</p>

<p>For a second even the hardened Mrs Jibble was staggered.</p>

<p>'Nobody who has seen her,' said Tony, with a rapt glance at
the plum pudding girl, who stood open-mouthed, listening, 'could
be insensible to her charms. To see her is to love her:
Eliza&mdash;!'</p>

<p>He spread out his arms, but Eliza stepped back a pace.</p>

<p>'You will marry my daughter, of course?' said the agitated
Mrs Jibble. 'You have smirched her fair name&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Marry her?' said Tony ecstatically. 'I ask for nothing
more!'</p>

<p>'You'll marry her?' There was a note of incredulity in Mrs
Jibble's voice which was not flattering to her daughter.</p>

<p>'Of course. It is the dream of my life. Eliza&mdash;at
last!'</p>

<p>Again Miss Jibble shrank back, and for a second the eyes of
mother and daughter met.</p>

<p>'There is no need for you to marry her,' said Mrs Jibble
hurriedly. 'My daughter must go away to the South of France to
recover from&mdash;from the shock. You as a gentleman will not
hesitate to defray the expenses of that trip. What is a thousand
pounds to you?'</p>

<p>'A thousand pounds,' said Anthony promptly; 'and the South of
France is the very place I had chosen for my honeymoon.'</p>

<p>It seemed that Mrs Jibble was breathing heavily.</p>

<p>'It is not a matter to be decided in a hurry,' she said.
'Perhaps in the morning you will realise the folly of it.
Perhaps you will see that such a match will bring nothing but
unhappiness for you. Here is my card, Mr Newton.'</p>

<p>She laid a large oblong of engraving on the table.</p>

<p>'To-morrow you may think better of your determination to ruin
my dear child's life. Come, Elizabeth.'</p>

<p>They swept out of the room. Eliza was out first.</p>

<p>Tony spent one hour at a public office, then he made a call
on a real lawyer, a man who had never written a love story in
his life or read anything more erotic than <i>Einstein on the
Building Laws</i>. Tony knew him slightly. He was a successful
man, and his office looked like a ragshop. There wasn't a chair
that had a whole seat, and the carpet had worn into the floor.
It was a business with six names, and was eminently
respectable.</p>

<p>'I want you to issue without delay a writ against Eliza
Jibble, of the Clarence, Palace Hotel, Regent's Park.'</p>

<p>'What is the subject?' asked the impassive man of law,
scribbling the address.</p>

<p>'Breach of promise,' said Tony calmly, and such was the
lawyer's imperturbability that he did not so much as lower an
eyelash.</p>

<p>'And it is very urgent,' said Tony. 'I'll stay here all the
afternoon if necessary.'</p>

<p>'It is neither necessary nor desirable,' said the lawyer, and
rang for his clerk.</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock the next morning his telephone bell rang
and the voice of Mr Tanker greeted him sharply.</p>

<p>'I've just had a man in from Hall, Bennett, Smith, Pollock,
Wild and Bosanquet,' he said, and his voice was trembling.</p>

<p>'Did they all come?' asked Tony sympathetically.</p>

<p>'He's served me with a subpoena,' said Mr Tanker, 'In a
breach of promise case. What the devil do you mean by it?'</p>

<p>Tony's voice was like cold custard. 'You said I wouldn't get
your name into the court except in a breach action&mdash;well,
I've brought it. I assess the damages at a thousand pounds,'
said Tony firmly, 'and when I've got that, anybody can laugh who
wants to.'</p>

<p>'You're mad!' screamed Mr Tanker. 'It's disgraceful! Suing a
girl for breach of promise! Now be a sensible boy&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I'm being one,' said Tony. 'Us boys have got to be protected
from designing females.'</p>

<p>There was a silence, and then:</p>

<p>'I suppose a hundred would settle it?' asked Mr Tanker. 'A
hundred is a lot of money, a lot of money.'</p>

<p>'It is, it is,' said Tony; 'but not a thousand&mdash;not a
thousand.'</p>

<p>He heard the old man's receiver click.</p>

<p>Later came Mrs Jibble in a condition bordering upon
frenzy.</p>

<p>'What's the meaning of this, mister?' she demanded,
nourishing a white paper in Tony's face.</p>

<p>'It means that your daughter either marries me, or she shall
pay for my lacerated feeling,' said Tony. 'I will not be played
with! The plum pud&mdash;your daughter has blighted my life. I
am determined to make her pay for her behaviour!'</p>

<p>'But, mister,' Mrs Jibble was almost in tears, 'a thousand
will ruin us.'</p>

<p>'Sell your jewellery,' said the inexorable Tony. 'You've got
too much anyway. As your future son-in-law&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You're not!' screeched the woman. 'I'd sooner&mdash;I'd
sooner... '</p>

<p>The interview ended unsatisfactorily for Mrs Jibble.</p>

<p>At tea-time came Mr Tanker himself.</p>

<p>'Now see here, Newton, we're not going to quarrel. Mrs Jibble
doesn't want this marriage to go through. She's willing to buy
you off for two hundred and fifty. Here's the money.'</p>

<p>He slammed a pad of notes on the table, and for one moment
Tony was tempted.</p>

<p>'No,' he said, 'I can't sell the most holy of my aspirations
for a paltry two-fifty. That's the curious thing about me,
Tanker&mdash;principles.'</p>

<p>'I daresay,' snorted Mr Tanker. 'But we're not discussing the
mythical. We're dealing with facts, and here are two hundred and
fifty of them.'</p>

<p>'Satan, avaunt!' said Tony loftily.</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock that night Tony made a call on Pinkey
Stephens, and Pinkey was glad to see him, for he had news to
tell.</p>

<p>'My boy&mdash;a bottle!' He rummaged in a cupboard and
produced a black and golden headed vessel. 'I've just sold a
story for three hundred!'</p>

<p>'And I've sold one for a thousand,' said Tony. 'It is called
"Never Wear Your Wedding Ring in Public". The villain is a
wicked ex-lawyer who hired a married beauty to entangle the
hero, but forgot to warn her against wearing her wedding ring.
The beauty, who is as attractive as a bombed tannery, is chosen
with the idea of making the hero&mdash;a young and handsome and
singularly brainy man&mdash;so fed up that he would pay a
fortune to get rid of her. In the end the hero triumphs. He is,
if I didn't mention the fact before, a tall, handsome man with a
boyish smile and a carriage that attracts instant attention. As
he walks in the street, women turn to look at him&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Sounds like that actor chap,' said Pinkey, and Tony Newton
was annoyed.</p> <hr>

<p class="first">TONY NEWTON was strong in the faith that if he
cast his bread upon the waters it would come back cake. And not
ordinary cake either. It would be of the richest quality and
covered with almond icing. To most people life is full of
promise. To Anthony Newton the promise bore a contract stamp.
The art and practice of optimism is based upon the faith that
Something is Due. Nothing comes to Hope, but a wistfulness
turning sour. The man who gets there looks to the future with
the same confidence and certainty as the tradesman who sends in
his bill to a Rothschild looks for payment.</p>

<p>Tony believed that the world revolved about him once in
twenty-four hours. He also believed that the world was created
for him and that the Lord rested on the seventh day to check the
result and see if He had forgotten anything that Tony might
want.</p>

<p>When Pinkey was working out a most difficult situation in his
newest story ('Should he have married her?' A Drama of Love and
Passion) Tony strolled into his chambers and was greeted by his
unwilling host with a scowl. 'Hello!' said Pinkey unpleasantly.
'Haven't you any work to do?'</p>

<p>Tony seated himself with great care, pulling up the knees of
his nicely creased trousers and setting down his hat gingerly on
the sideboard.</p>

<p>'I want a secretary,' he said.</p>

<p>Pinkey made a gurgling and indignant noise.</p>

<p>'Am I running an employment bureau?' he demanded, but Tony
raised a dignified hand.</p>

<p>This is serious, Pinkey,' he said quietly. 'I want a
secretary. I've been thinking things out. I've got an office
with furniture complete. I've bought a typewriter and had my
name painted on the door. All I want now is a secretary. I don't
want any flighty girl; at the same time I don't want one who
looks like Auntie Rosa. She must be neat, pretty, in a
business-like way, quiet, dignified, capable and
appreciative.'</p>

<p>'Need she type?' asked the other sarcastically.</p>

<p>Tony nodded.</p>

<p>That is necessary, I think,' he answered gravely. 'I have a
typewriter, so perhaps it would be better if she typed.'</p>

<p>Pinkey put down his pen and leant back in his chair,
frowning. 'Ordinarily, your coming to me to find you a secretary
would have been an act of lunacy. As it is, you've happened to
arrive at an auspicious moment.' He searched his table and
presently found a slip of paper.</p>

<p>'Miss Ann Portland,' he read, and passed the paper to the
other. 'She came in this morning&mdash;a friend of mine sent her
to see if I could give her a job. She is a good typist, has done
secretarial work, and is capable. At least, that is the
recommendation which came with her.'</p>

<p>'Is she&mdash;?' Tony hesitated.</p>

<p>'She's pretty but sedate. How sedate I don't know. I couldn't
find a job for her&mdash;all my work is done by an agency in
Temple Chambers. Her address is written on the back. And now,
old friend, if you will excuse me, I have a whole lot of writing
to do.'</p>

<p>Anthony rose, smoothed himself and took up his hat.</p>

<p>'What the devil do you want a secretary for, anyway?' asked
Pinkey, his curiosity getting the better of him, and Tony
sighed.</p>

<p>'You are out of touch with realities Pinkey,' he said, a
little sadly. 'In the old days the hallmark of a man of affairs
was a smart gig and a tiger. To-day it is an office and a
secretary. I am for the moment a pariah in City circles. People
look askance at me. Wherever I go men whisper behind their hands
in horrified tones "He hasn't got a secretary!" It is getting on
my nerves.'</p>

<p>'Twiff!' sneered Pinkey. 'It is sheer bluff on your
part!'</p>

<p>Tony did not deny the charge. There was no necessity. He had
in truth taken a new office at the top of a small building near
Piccadilly Circus. He had printed notepaper and, as he said, a
typewriter, a telephone, indeed all the appurtenances of a
business man&mdash;except business. As to this, Tony was
satisfied that business would come.</p>

<p>The next morning Miss Portland arrived. She was young,
pretty, self-possessed and remarkably frank. She examined Tony's
bargain typewriter and passed sentence of death without holding
out any hope of reprieve. She sorted Tony's letters and
discreetly omitted to read, or said that she had omitted to
read, any that had the appearance of privacy. She herself took
back the typewriter to the gentleman who had sold it to Tony,
and returned, flushed and happy, with an older looking machine
that really worked. Tony was enchanted.</p>

<p>They had tea together in the office, and Tony told her the
sad story of his life. She believed as much as she wanted, and
told him a few vital facts about her own career.</p>

<p>'I suppose you ought to get some sort of reference from my
last employer,' said Miss Portland toward the end of the
afternoon, 'though I don't know that it will help you much.'</p>

<p>'I employ people on their faces,' said Tony loftily, 'I have
seldom made a mistake.'</p>

<p>The girl smiled.</p>

<p>'Mr Anquilina thinks the same,' she said drily, 'But he made
one big mistake&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Anquilina?' Tony was interested. The South American
millionaire?'</p>

<p>'He's South American all right,' replied Miss Portland, 'but
I'm not giving him a million.'</p>

<p>'But, my dear child!' Tony could be very bland and fatherly.
'It is in the newspapers. He has bought the Treforium Theatre
and the Jollity and the New Hippoceum and Merry's&mdash;'</p>

<p>She faced him, a smile on her pretty face and a twinkle of
fun in her eyes. Young, shrewd, without illusions. The product
of bureaux, wise in the ways of the Employing Male.</p>

<p>'Mr Newton,' she said, 'if Anquilina had been buying shops or
business sites, would a line have got into the newspapers? If he
had come to buy up half Threadneedle Street, would anybody have
worried? Yes, the bankers would. They'd have put through
enquiries about his financial position. But because he is
supposed to be buying theatres, he has all the publicity in the
world-theatres have a journalism of their own. Anquilina is a
bluff. He lives in the best hotel in London and pays his bills.
He has a secretary&mdash;or he had till I left him&mdash;and he
has got to know almost every theatrical celebrity in London.
That's easy. He has "talked" buying&mdash;but I've seen the
inside of his mind. A man is pretty frank with a girl he wants
to take to supper. I don't eat suppers. They're bad for the
complexion&mdash;especially suppers at Cavolo's. I don't like
Cavolo's or any other restaurant where the waiter knocks before
he comes in.'</p>

<p>'Then what on earth is he?' asked the astonished Tony.</p>

<p>'I shouldn't like to tell you,' said Ann demurely. 'But if
you ask me what his profession is, I'll tell you. He has a
sitting-room at the hotel and gives little parties. He can play
baccarat better than most people. That is why he had to leave
the Rex Hotel&mdash;the manager said that people were
complaining about the bad language his guests used when they
went home at two in the morning. I suppose you think I'm being
unpardonable in betraying my late employer&mdash;but some people
are outside consideration, and Antonio Anquilina is one.'</p>

<p>Tony was pinching his chin thoughtfully.</p>

<p>'Then he's a crook?'</p>

<p>'I don't know. Men who get their livings by their wits can't
very well be straight, because straight wits run to straight
business.'</p>

<p>Tony nodded gravely. 'Thank you, Ann,' he said.</p>

<p>It was that same night that Tony heard of the Minnows. The
Minnow Club was not as well known as it deserved to be. The
membership was limited, its financial resources were practically
nil. Originally designed as a club for important managers of
West End dress shops, its title was chosen in a sense of pompous
self-abnegation on the part of its founders, and was intended to
be wholly derisory. For the gentlemen who chose this and its
furnishings were the Tritons of the Ready-to-Wear world, that is
contained within the north and south boundaries of Piccadilly
and Wigmore Street.</p>

<p>In what manner the Minnows really became veritable minnows,
common twopenny-ha'penny people could be told. The war had
something to do with it; the bankruptcy of one and the
imprisonment of another great patron contributed to its
deterioration.</p>

<p>Felix Sandyman bought the benefit of the lease, the furniture
and whatever goodwill it possessed for the sum of one thousand
pounds, payable as to £300 on the signing of the agreement and
thereafter regular monthly payments of £50 (say Fifty pounds).
For this sum he received from The Vendors the articles set forth
in the schedule, a depleted stock of third-class refreshments, a
billiard table and a French chef who was known professionally as
Henri and privately as 'Youngarry'.</p>

<p>Tony Newton met Felix that night by accident. They drank
together, and Felix who was an earnest, round-faced young man
who wore glasses and had no sense of humour, suggested that Tony
should become a member of the dub.</p>

<p>'Thanks,' said Tony. 'I don't fish, though haddock with a
poached egg is my favourite breakfast.'</p>

<p>'There's nothing about fishing in this club,' said Felix
sombrely. 'It's called "The Minnows" for no reason at all. I
bought it from a man named Aaronson who had it for bad debt. I
wish people would pay their debts. If they did, I shouldn't have
been stuck with the Minnows.'</p>

<p>'Doesn't it pay?' asked Tony, interested.</p>

<p>'Pay?' Mr Sandyman made or performed a gesture to signify the
futility of the question. 'I thought of selling it to that South
American that everybody is talking about&mdash;' he began, and
Tony half rose from the table, gaping.</p>

<p>'A fellow named Angelina&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Anquilina.' corrected Felix, and added ungrammatically:
'That's him. He's buying property in London for a trust,
theatres and things.'</p>

<p>Tony was breathing heavily.</p>

<p>'I'll buy your club' he said. It was unlike Tony to buy
anything without haggling over the price. Yet this he did and
more. By noon the next day he was proprietor of 'The Minnows',
its springless chairs and wonky billiard table. Its sets of
sporting prints and odd table services.</p>

<p>He had the right (which he did not exercise) of dismissing
Youngarry. the French chef&mdash;whose real name was
Jackson&mdash;and of appointing waiters. Instead, he hired
furniture and cutlery and bought a new carpet for the card room.
Had a big lock put upon the door of the same, hired a carpenter
to cut a hole in the card-room door, and had a trap fixed so
that it could be opened from the inside. All this he did before
he made his call at another and respectable club.</p>

<p>The men in the big reading-room greeted him with enthusiasm,
for in bygone days Tony had been the most anarchistic and
revolutionary member of their party.</p>

<p>'No, I haven't lost my job&mdash;I never had one to lose,'
explained Tony. 'I'm living on my wits.' A picture of the wise
Miss Portland rose to his vision. 'Well, not exactly
that&mdash;anyway, I'm living, and I've got three nights' work
for any of you lads who can play baccarat and own a dress suit.
The pay is good, the commission, ten per cent of my profits, is
likely to be respectable, and the joke is on a gory villain with
a name like a new table waiter.'</p>

<p>There were ten men in the room and there were ten volunteers,
nine of whom had the requisite habiliments. As to the
tenth...</p>

<p>'You'll be door-keeper, Fairy,' said Tony, and the
unprepossessing young man he addressed grinned. 'You have the
pug' mug and that's going to be an asset. Gather round and
listen... '</p>

<p>Mr Antonio Anquilina was a stoutish and exquisitely-dressed
man of middle age. He occupied one of the most expensive suites
that the Hotel Belleami boasted, and in truth he found that his
extravagance was well justified. He was a member of a luncheon
club where theatrical magnates forgathered (his lamentations at
luncheon over his last night's losses were the frequent cause
for his jubilation at breakfast&mdash;all the world loves a
loser) and he had the entry to some of the best theatrical
circles in London.</p>

<p>Though he never made a purchase, he had pursued encouraging
enquiries. Money was no object. He made this clear. If he got
the right kind of theatre, he would pay. Unfortunately he never
found the right kind of theatre. He was open, too, to finance
theatrical productions if the scheme appealed to him. For a
month he lunched at the expense of fevered producers, authors
and actor-managers, but no scheme quite satisfied him. And in
the meantime, men who had money and wanted more, preferably his,
gladly accepted his return invitations to a cold bird and a
bottle in his rooms. There was also a stone-cold deck of cards,
but this was not on the menu... his visitors accepted the
subsequent misfortune which came their way with the gambler's
philosophy. That is to say, they returned the next night to win
back their losses. And they never did.</p>

<p>There was trouble at the hotel. A polite manager interviewed
Sen. A. Anquilina, and with many regrets informed him that his
room had been let as from next week. Antonio, who had been
kicked out of more hotels than any other man living, was
indignant, talked of actions at law and behaved exactly as he
had behaved on hundreds of similar occasions.</p>

<p>He was making his plans for the future when a card was
brought up to him.</p>

<p>'Who is Meester Anthony Newton?' he demanded of his new
secretary.</p>

<p>'Never heard of him, sir,' said the young man.</p>

<p>Mr Anthony Newton was shown up. Thus did Anthony and Antonio
meet, the one dark and smiling and oozing an almost oriental
affability, the other slim and cold and most business-like.</p>

<p>'I have heard that you are in want of a theatre,' said Tony,
and Mr Anquilina, inwardly speculating, outwardly eager,
nodded.</p>

<p>'I also am in warn of a theatre,' said Tony to the other's
surprise. 'The fact is, Mr Anquilina, it occurred to me that, if
you had succeeded, I might secure a partnership in your
enterprise. I have a play which I am anxious to produce... '</p>

<p>They talked plays and theatres throughout the afternoon.</p>

<p>'Money, with me,' said Tony as he rose to go, 'is no object.
I feel that if I can get the right theatre I'll buy it. Frankly,
I am not anxious for a partnership; I prefer to take over the
full responsibility. It isn't fair to one's partner...'</p>

<p>Mr Anquilina agreed. He not only agreed, but he praised Tony
shamelessly for his amiable and honourable viewpoint. Would Tony
dine with him?</p>

<p>'Dine with me at the Minnows,' said Tony.</p>

<p>'The&mdash;?'</p>

<p>The Minnows,' Tony smiled darkly. 'I don't suppose you've
ever heard of the place? It is select, and we do not advertise
it&mdash;I must tell you in confidence that it is my own
club&mdash;I bought it some time ago, and it is rather a worry.
Upon my word, if I were offered £10,000 for it I'd sell it.'</p>

<p>'Doesn't it pay?'</p>

<p>But Tony did not answer. 'It isn't a question of
paying&mdash;it is the responsibility. I come from a very
straight-laced family, and sometimes I am afraid that, with all
the precautions I take, I shall one day find myself in
trouble.'</p>

<p>Mr Anquilina accepted the invitation with alacrity.</p>

<p>And yet, to his experienced eyes, there was nothing unusual
about the club. It seemed at first a little pokey and a little
shabby. The members who were dining were certainly good class
people. He guessed them to be rich, and when in twos and threes
they went out, leaving Tony and his guest alone, he was
intrigued.</p>

<p>'Do all the members leave so early?' he asked.</p>

<p>Tony shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>'There are very few here to-night... State Ball and all that
sort of thing.'</p>

<p>'But are they leaving the club?' persisted the other.</p>

<p>Tony hesitated.</p>

<p>'I don't know whether I ought to embarrass you by taking you
into my confidence,' he said, 'but if you are interested... no,
no, I won't.'</p>

<p>Mr Anquilina was visibly agitated. 'I assure you of the great
emphasis that I am most fascinated to share your confidence,' he
said, and Tony looked at him sombrely.</p>

<p>'Come,' he said, and got up.</p>

<p>Mr Anquilina followed, scenting romance. They passed up a
narrow flight of stairs into a small ante-room. There was a door
in this room, and upon it Tony knocked three times. A trap in
the panel opened and a fierce face glared at them.</p>

<p>'It is all right, Fairy,' said Tony soothingly. 'This is a
friend of mine.'</p>

<p>The head shook.</p>

<p>'I don't think you ought to bring anybody in, Mr Newton,
unless he is vouched for by the other guests.'</p>

<p>Tony frowned.</p>

<p>'Am I not the proprietor of this club?' he demanded angrily
and the trap closed.</p>

<p>The fascinated Mr Anquilina heard the sound of bolts being
drawn and the door was opened. Ushered by his host, he found
himself in a medium-sized room, in the middle of which was a
green baize-covered table. There was no need for the visitor to
ask what the nine solemn men were doing. One in shirt sleeves
was dealing cards from a 'boot'. But it was not the game that
left the South American gasping. It was the wagering.</p>

<p>They were betting in hundreds, in thousands, with a coolness
which staggered even Mr Anquilina. The only protest came from
one who, as he signed a cheque and threw it across to the
dealer, uttered a curse.</p>

<p>'That's sixteen thousand I've lost in two days,' he said
bitterly and the visitor gasped.</p>

<p>They stood watching the game for a while, and then Tony
tapped his guest on the shoulder and silently they withdrew.</p>

<p>'What do you think of it?'</p>

<p>Mr Anquilina could only shake his head.</p>

<p>'You understand why I am worried? Play is too high&mdash;of
course they can afford to lose, and it's their look out anyway.
The profits are good and the game is straight&mdash;I see to
that&mdash;but&mdash;'</p>

<p>He shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>'My dear fellow,' said Anquilina, when he had recovered his
breath, 'I understand.. I sympathise... You are a gentleman of
character. I would buy the club from you... at a price. I am
rich, but I must have hobbies. Being English, you will
understand. Now, if you had said six thousand... '</p>

<p>'Ten,' said Anthony.</p>

<p>'Or seven... '</p>

<p>'Nine.' said Tony decisively. 'I would not dream of selling
it at a loss. Besides which, I have no great desire to sell. I,
too, need a hobby... '</p>

<p>Eventually he sold it for eight thousand five hundred, and
when Mr Anquilina's bank opened in the morning, Tony was waiting
on the doorstep with the cheque in his hand. And round the
corner, oblivious of the pouring rain, ten dead broke young men,
who only the night before had been playing for mythical
thousands were waiting for their commissions.</p> <hr>

For Tony Newton"</p>

<br>

<p class="first">IN the centuries ahead, writers of the period,
taking as their models those of our authors who effect the
historical novel as the medium of their genius, may tell the
story of Master Anthony Newton and of How He Came to Bursted,
and of What Fell Out.</p>

<p>In the meantime let us have the truth.</p>

<p>Tony was neither ambitious nor vindictive in the baser sense.
His only ambitions were to make a lot of money and to be talked
about by everybody. Otherwise he was an extraordinarily modest
man. As to his vengefulness&mdash;he never wanted any more than
to get even with his enemies. Which brings us to Bursted,
appropriately enough, with the great protagonist of these
adventures.</p>

<p>Tony Newton, being in that condition of prosperity which
makes for restlessness, saw two announcements in the press. And
they both had to do with the Borough of Bursted, though this he
did not know until he had interviewed an agent and discovered
that the...</p>

<p class="quote">'Thriving Country weekly. Largest circulation
in prosperous agricultural district. Great opportunity for
pushful man,'</p>

<p class="first">...which was advertised for sale was the
<i>Rocket</i> of that town. That Mr Josias Longwirt had been
chosen as the Conservative candidate for Bursted, was announced
more openly.</p>

<p>The appearance of Mr Longwirt's name in print aroused in
Tony's heart a passionate desire for justice. For years he had
carried in his mind's eye a mental picture of an exquisitely
dressed and painfully rich young man, to whom he had once
appealed for the price of a dinner. And Tony had needed that
meal pretty badly. It was in the days when he tramped London,
looking for the job to which his services and genius entitled
him.</p>

<p>Mr Longwirt had also an excellent memory. He recalled three
lickings at school at the hands of a prefect named Newton, and
his little soul rejoiced at the opportunity which this appeal
gave to him.</p>

<p>'Awfully sorry, Newton&mdash;can't help you... so many calls
on my purse&mdash;why don't you try for National Assistance...
'</p>

<p>Those were the sage and healing words which Mr Josias
Longwirt addressed to his sometime schoolfellow. And the next
time they had met, he had cut Anthony dead.</p>

<p>Tony was no journalist, but the possibilities of the
<i>Rocket</i> were very apparent.</p>

<p>His intention was wholly mischievous. Beyond a desire to
annoy and worry Mr Longwirt, to expose certain of his weaknesses
and act as general thorn in the side, he had no other intention
or purpose. So strangely does fate shape the lives of men that
no unkind reference to Josias Longwirt, Esq, ever appeared in
the columns of the <i>Bursted Rocket</i>. And for this
reason.</p>

<p>Anthony Newton, with a chequebook in his inside pocket and a
newspaper advertisement cut from the 'Stationers' Gazette' in
his cigarette case, walked with stately strides down No 4
platform at Waterloo Station, looking for a compartment that
promised to offer an adequate return in comfort for the
excessive sum he had been charged for a first-class return. He
was also looking for a man. So doing, he saw a familiar face
through a window and, although the scared proprietor of the face
instantly raised his newspaper to blot out his identity. Tony
saw him, turned the handle of the carriage door and sat down
opposite. 'Bug-face,' said Tony, calmly and dispassionately.</p>

<p>The young man thus addressed put down his paper with an
all-simulated expression of surprise.</p>

<p>'Why, it's Newton!' he said, and offered a feeble hand.</p>

<p>'Well, how are you, and how is the old rag and bone
business?'</p>

<p>'I'm fine,' said the other without enthusiasm.</p>

<p>He was sallow and small and his eyes were pale. Mr Longwirt
was the son of Longwirt, who made millions out of the sale and
purchase of rags. This fact was never mentioned by anybody but
Tony Newton. Therefore, J. P. Longwirt disliked A. Newton
excessively.</p>

<p>'I hear that you're doing well, Newton,' said Mr Longwirt,
hoping that the unpleasant past had been forgotten. 'I like to
hear that fellows are doing well. I'm going into Parliament. I
shouldn't be surprised, from what I've heard, if I didn't get a
jolly good position in the Government.'</p>

<p>'For Bursted,' said Anthony with a curious emphasis. 'I saw
the announcement in the papers. A walk over?'</p>

<p>Mr Longwirt hesitated.</p>

<p>'It may be,' he said. There's an Independent chap standing,
and he hasn't an earthly. Not an earthly! Besides,' he smiled
secretly, 'he may not stand.'</p>

<p>Tony winked. Mr Longwirt winked back.</p>

<p>'Paying him to stand down?'</p>

<p>Mr Longwirt smiled.</p>

<p>'I should be mad to do a thing like that,' and he winked
again.</p>

<p>'Hence the expression "honest politics",' said Tony. 'I've no
doubt you've heard of the <i>Bursted Rocket</i>?'</p>

<p>Mr Longwirt had.</p>

<p>'Belongs to old Murkle, a silly old ass. I shall be very
nearly the youngest Member of Parliament, Newton.'</p>

<p>'Will you?' stated, rather than asked Tony. 'Bug-face, do you
remember meeting me in the Strand about ten months ago?'</p>

<p>The other frowned.</p>

<p>'I've an idea I did see you,' he confessed; 'but I've got
such a rotten memory for faces&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You saw me&mdash;you spoke to me, and you made a reference
to National Assistance. I looked seedy and down and out. I
nearly was. Bug-face, you perished at that moment!'</p>

<p>Mr Longwirt first squirmed and then stood on his dignity.</p>

<p>'If you're offended, I can't help it,' he said. 'I can't give
money to everybody.'</p>

<p>'You will have all your work cut out to help yourself,' said
Tony darkly; and at that moment the train began to move out of
the station.</p>

<p>It was gathering speed when a man opened the carriage door
and fell in. And as he fell, he cursed.</p>

<p>He was a gentleman of sixty, very short and very bald. He had
a jaw of great strength and breadth, and eyes that glared
naturally.</p>

<p>'... all stationmasters, ticket collectors and porters!' he
said, violently.</p>

<p>'Are you hurt, sir?' asked Tony, politely.</p>

<p>'No, sir, I'm not hurt.' Suddenly he lowered his brows and
looked hard at Tony. 'For the moment I thought that your face
was asymmetrical,' he said. 'I now perceive that it was the
shadow. Forgive me. A more normal face I have not seen for
years.'</p>

<p>Tony inclined his head gravely.</p>

<p>'May I return the compliment&mdash;' he began.</p>

<p>'No, sir, you may not!' snapped the other. 'My lower jaw is
distinctly prognathic&mdash;my right ear is abnormal, and the
processes of the parietal bones are frantically abnormal. Some
of the finest scientists of the day have said that it is humanly
impossible that I can be sane with such parietals.'</p>

<p>He glared at the open-mouthed Mr Longwirt.</p>

<p>'Good God!' gasped the short man profanely. 'Here is the most
remarkable face I have ever seen.'</p>

<p>'You interest me,' said Tony. 'Pray tell me some more.'</p>

<p>Mr Longwirt was speechless.</p>

<p>'The recessive frontal indicates a low mentality; the ears,
standing out as they do, suggest homicidal tendencies; the lower
maxilla is weak and recessed&mdash;do you mind turning your head
sir?'</p>

<p>'I will not turn my head!' said the indignant Mr Longwirt,
recovering his breath. 'How dare you, sir! How dare you!'</p>

<p>'That,' explained the little stranger with a certain
satisfaction, 'explains the ears. Unbalanced... lack of mental
equilibrium&mdash;the queer traits of personal vanity one sees
in such cases.'</p>

<p>'I am Mr Longwirt, of Leathbro' Hall,' said that gentleman
awfully.</p>

<p>'I'm Dr Clayfield, of Clayfield Mental Hospital,' introduced
the other briskly. 'Longwirt-Longwirt&mdash;didn't one of your
relations poison his mother?'</p>

<p>'No, sir,' roared Josias.</p>

<p>'Are you sure. Bug-face?' asked Tony gently.</p>

<p>'Of course I'm sure!' Dr Clayfield exchanged glances with the
sympathetic Tony. 'And I'd like you to know, sir, that I am the
Member for Bursted&mdash;practically.'</p>

<p>The doctor looked at Tony questioningly: Tony shook his head,
and tapped his forehead.</p>

<p>'All people are mad,' said Dr Clayfield calmly. 'That is my
theory. It is borne out by experiment. You, sir,' he addressed
Tony impressively, 'are the only sane person I have met to-day.
Are you going to Bursted? Good &mdash;I go to Larchleigh which
is two stations beyond. Yes, sir, you are one of three sane
people I have met this week. Staying at Bursted?'</p>

<p>'Yes, doctor; I am thinking of buying a newspaper&mdash;the
<i>Rocket</i>.'</p>

<p>'You're mad!' said the doctor. 'Anybody who elects to live in
Bursted is a fool, anybody who pays threepence to read the
<i>Rocket</i> is an imbecile, but a man who buys it is
certifiably insane!'</p>

<p>So Tony came to Bursted, parting with Josias stiffly; with
the doctor mournfully. Josias heard of his possible entry into
the realms of country journalism with considerable
misgiving.</p>

<p>The circulation of the <i>Bursted Rocket</i> was a large one;
on the occasion of the opening of the new Parish Hall, as many
as a thousand copies were printed, though they were not all
sold. Covering, as it does, the villages of Blackpond,
Marblevale, Crasted, Mordon Hanel and Little Murstead, the organ
of public opinion may be said to enjoy the largest circulation
of any weekly journal published in a radius of twenty miles.
Such was Mr Murkle's proud claim. And if his detractors point
sneeringly to the fact that there is no other newspaper
published within a radius of twenty miles, all the more credit
to Mr Murkle that any is published at all.</p>

<p>The <i>Rocket</i> was issued from Mr Murkle's news and
stationery shop in the High Street. It was printed in a shed at
the back of the shop and advertisements for the current issue
were accepted over the counter up to the time of publication. If
the advertisement was big enough, it was accepted after
publication, the machines stopped, and the new advertisement
inserted.</p>

<p>Roffles, the local poet, complained bitterly that in such
circumstances it was invariably his contribution which was
lifted out &mdash;a somewhat unjust complaint, for Mr Murkle
invariably paid him the five shillings, whether the poem was
printed or not.</p>

<p>The people of Bursted took their views on the world's
happenings from the <i>Rocket</i> and naturally so, since in all
the county there was not a better informed man on public affairs
than Mr Murkle. He often admitted this much to those of his
friends who had the inestimable privilege of hearing, at first
hand, the views, which he expressed in more classic language in
the <i>Rocket</i>. The editor and proprietor of the
<i>Rocket</i>, and prospective Independent candidate for the
borough of Bursted, was a gentleman of sixty, with a
short-clipped white beard and shell spectacles. Dogbery, a
disappointed man, whose contributions to the <i>Rocket</i> had
again and again been rejected, to the knowledge of all, said
that Mr Murkle looked like almost anybody who has been cured by
a patent medicine, and had his picture in the papers.</p>

<p>'Dogbery doesn't like the article I had about the Liberals
last week,' said Mr Murkle, chewing contemplatively upon a
straw&mdash;he was standing at the door of the shop on a bright
afternoon, watching the pageant of life pass. And Bursted is a
busy place on Saturday evenings. Close observers have seen as
many as three cars passing down the street at one time. His
companion was a prospective advertiser.</p>

<p>'But then, Dogbery doesn't like anything. That attack I had
on the Americans the other day made him feel sick, so he says,
and my remarks about the Navy gave him a pain in his solar
regions. But Mr Walsh, I've got my duty to the country. That's
how I feel. The Americans don't advertise in the
<i>Rocket</i>&mdash;nor the Liberals. So far as the Navy goes,
I've had one three-inch across two columns in the last five
years!'</p>

<p>'As to that Geneva Conference,' Mr Murkle went on, 'I can't
allow it. Dogbery will be wild, but I've got my duty. Where is
Geneva, anyway? I never heard of it till this affair started. I
wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't in Russia... in Switzerland,
is it? They may say so, but you know what these Government
people are. Mark my words, they're keeping something back. Wait
till you see my leader next week! I've given it to the
Government hot and strong. I don't care what Dogbery says. I can
tell you all about that Lausanne conference, but it is entre
noo, which means that it mustn't go any further. I got it from
the right source&mdash;my daughter's married to a Government
official... yes, I know what Dogbery says... he says my
son-in-law cleans the windows at the Admiralty. It would surprise
Dogbery to know that he doesn't clean the windows&mdash;he
carries up the coal. If a man who wears brass buttons and a
uniform isn't a Government official, I don't know who is. But
that's neither here nor there. The <i>Rocket</i> knows. If you
see it in the <i>Rocket</i>, it's so. That's our motto... Eh?
Well, maybe another paper has it, too, but they copied it out of
the <i>Rocket</i>.'</p>

<p>'As to this here election that's coming along, I ain't
decided who I'm supporting. Maybe one side, maybe the other.
Which ever side I support will get in.'</p>

<p>In some respects, Mr Murkle maintained the style and
traditions of the London press.</p>

<p>'There's some talk about me standing as an Independent. I've
been asked. If I stand I'll get in. Longwirt is afraid of me an'
afraid of the <i>Rocket</i>. I don't blame him. You believe me,
Mr What's&mdash;your&mdash;name, that paper is going to make a
fortune one of these days. It's the only paper in the county
that's making money. That's something to say! The only paper
that's making money. You can take it from me sir, that when you
put money into advertisements in the <i>Rocket</i>, you're
pickin' it up as fast, an' faster than when you put it down. And
I've got a four inch double column solus on the leader page that
I'd like to keep for you, but I don't know that I can. Beecham's
is after it, an' Fry's Chocolates' fightin' for it and a motor
car company. Rolls something&mdash;never heard of 'um
before&mdash;they're after it. An' for forty-five shillings,
it's yours.'</p>

<p>The prospective advertiser murmured something about 'seeing'
and 'consulting my partner,' and melted away. Mr Murkle glared
after him murderously for a few minutes, then turned and walked
back into his shop, and for the first time became aware that a
customer had been waiting all this time.</p>

<p>'What can I do for you, sir?' asked Mr Murkle.</p>

<p>'My name is Newton, Anthony Newton,' said Tony. 'I've come
down in reference to your advertisement in the Stationers'
Gazette.'</p>

<p>'Come in,' said Mr Murkle and, seizing upon his possible
benefactor, led him to the parlour.</p>

<p>'I wouldn't sell it, Mr What's-your-name,' said Mr Murkle at
the end of an hour's bargaining, 'only I'm disgusted with the
Government. I'm going out of public life for good. So long as I
can do the printing, I'll let you have an office here for thirty
shillings a week; and ten per cent on all the ads. taken over
the counter is fair...'</p>

<p>Thus Tony Newton became the editor of the <i>Rocket</i>, and
Josias learnt of the happening with something akin to terror,
though it seemed remarkable that his only possible opponent
should have disposed of that important vehicle of public opinion
if he had any serious pretensions to Parliamentary honours.</p>

<p>Tony settled himself down to the business of journalism with
all the zest and enthusiasm of a scientifically minded child
possessed of a mechanical toy. He watched its workings with awe
and proceeded to delve into its interior to discover how.</p>

<p>Two numbers he issued, when the General Election exploded
like a bombshell upon Bursted and transformed an ordinarily
respectable community into frenzied, teeth-gnashing and
altogether hateful factions. And the first of the bills to
appear were those which extolled the merits, literary qualities,
administrative genius and political integrity of Mr
Murkle&mdash;'A Bursted Man for Bursted.' Mr Murkle was both
author and printer.</p>

<p>Tony, strolling along the High Street, met Mr Josias
Longwirt, and the young man was troubled.</p>

<p>'I say Anthony, that old devil isn't really standing, is he?'
he asked, anxiously. 'Not that it makes a lot of difference,
except that it is going to cost money.'</p>

<p>'I sympathise with you,' said Tony, 'and I will do what is
possible to relieve your mind. The bigger show old Murkle makes,
the more it will cost you to withdraw his candidature. The
locals say that Murkle has been a candidate in every election
for thirty years, and on each occasion he has withdrawn at the
last minute. It costs him nothing: he does his own printing and
bill posting. In fact, it is the jolliest scheme for ensuring a
steady income that I know.'</p>

<p>Josias pulled at his nose thoughtfully.</p>

<p>'I can't understand what the dooce made you come down,' he
said dubiously. 'I thought you had bought the <i>Rocket</i> to
slate me, but your article on me was jolly decent.'</p>

<p>'Decency is my weakness,' said Tony gravely. 'The great idea
behind my presence will one day be revealed. In the meantime,
what are you going to do with Murkle?'</p>

<p>'Buy him off, I suppose&mdash;every member has had to do it.
It's blackmail&mdash;what does he want?'</p>

<p>'Ask him,' said Tony significantly.</p>

<p>There was an interview between the candidates, and two days
before the nomination, Mr Murkle's bills were covered over by
white sheets of paper. That night, Tony made a pilgrimage of the
public houses and found many friends. What Tony did that night
can never be properly known. Such evidence as is available is
emphatic upon one point, namely, that he produced a paper which
he said was a petition for the reprieve of a man who was going
to be hanged, and every person he asked signed.</p>

<p>Mr Miller, a staunch Conservative, Mr Jordan, as staunch a
Liberal, Mr Hallingay, who had Communistic leanings&mdash;all
signed the 'petition'.</p>

<p>The day following, the excitement in Bursted fell to nothing.
The promised contest was not to eventuate. To the last there
were people who hoped against hope that Mr Murkle would
stand.</p>

<p>'No,' said Mr Murkle sadly, 'it's not to be. When I parted
with the <i>Rocket</i> I parted with ambition. It was a
mistake.'</p>

<p>He was entertained to dinner that evening by Tony. There were
no other guests, and the dinner was given in a private room at
the Wheatsheaf and Tony drank ginger ale. Mr Murkle, who did not
drink ginger ale, was political at eight o'clock, musical at
nine, boastful and tearful by turns at ten&mdash;at eleven he
grew immensely confidential, and told Anthony Newton the story
of his life...</p>

<p>Nomination day dawned brightly. To Mr Josias Longwirt it
seemed that heaven smiled upon his enterprise. What greatness
the day held for him he did not guess.</p>

<p>He had finished dressing (he was staying at the Roebuck, the
most important hotel in Bursted) when a letter came for him. It
arrived by the hands of a commissionaire and was heavily sealed
and bore over his name 'Secret and Confidential.' There was a
coat of arms on the back. Inside, written on stiff vellum and
bearing no address but the simple words The Inner Cabinet. Most
Secret.' was a letter:</p><br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr
Longwirt</span>,</p>

<p class="letter">A crisis has arisen. We are meeting at Malby
House, Blackpond, and require your immediate advice and
presence. Do not ask for S&mdash;B &mdash;or anybody by name. Do
not give your own name. Call yourself Nelson and ask to see the
King of Greece. Be sure to do this, and under no circumstances
mention names. THIS IS VITAL AND IMPORTANT. A&mdash;C &mdash;is
coming by special train. Remember not a word! Malby House is the
white house on the left of the road before you get to
Blackpond.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">S.B. (P.M.)</span></p><br>

<p>Mr Longwirt did not swoon. In his dreams such things had
happened. He went down and ordered his car.</p>

<p>'Draw the blinds,' he said firmly. His wondering chauffeur
obeyed.</p>

<p>Clear of the town, Mr Longwirt drew aside the curtains and
gave himself up to pleasant speculation. It seemed that the
burden of Empire had fallen upon him, for his face was grave and
his brows knitted. Nearing Blackpond (which he had once visited)
he saw the white house and signalled to his chauffeur. They
passed through heavy iron gates and drew up before the pillared
portico. Instantly the door was opened and a man in a white
jacket came out.</p>

<p>'I am Nelson,' he said in a low vibrant voice, 'and I wish to
speak to the King of Greece.'</p>

<p>The man nodded.</p>

<p>'Certainly, Admiral,' he said. 'Will you step in?'</p>

<p>Mr Longwirt found himself in a panelled office, and presently
a stout man came in. Mr Longwirt had a faint idea that he had
met him before.</p>

<p>'I am Nelson, and I wish to see the King of Greece,' he
said.</p>

<p>Dr Clayfield glared benevolently at the visitor. 'And you
shall see him, Admiral, and Napoleon and the Rajah of
Bhong!'</p>

<p>He rang a bell, and this time two men in white appeared.</p>

<p>'No. 8 Observation,' said the doctor briskly, and Mr Longwirt
went joyously forth.</p>

<p>A few minutes before noon, the returning officer waited for
the arrival of Mr Josias Longwirt. Instead, arrived Anthony
Newton, who laid a sum of money on the table and an extensively
signed nomination paper.</p>

<p>'I hadn't any idea you were standing, Mr Newton,' said the
officer in surprise.</p>

<p>'Neither had I,' said Tony.</p>

<p>It took three solicitors four hours to secure the release of
Mr Josias Longwirt from the Claverly Mental Hospital.</p>

<p>There's no sense in getting angry, my good man,' snarled the
doctor. 'When a fellow comes here calling himself Nelson and
asking to see august personages, I'm entitled to detain
him.'</p>

<p>'I'll sue you!' screamed Josias. 'I'll have questions asked
in the House of Commons.'</p>

<p>But he didn't.</p>

<p>Mr Anthony Newton, MP for the Borough of Bursted (unopposed)
advised him against such a course of action.</p>

<p>'It is unfortunate, Bug-face, but more unfortunate if I
reveal the bribery and corruption of old Murkle. Got it all down
in black and white. Come up and see me at Westminster one
day&mdash;I'll show you round!'</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="story10" id="story10">X. &mdash; THE JOKER</a></h2>

<h3>First published as "The Joke of a Lifetime," <i>The Novel
Magazine</i>, March 1923</h3>

<p class="first">MR ANTHONY NEWTON had enjoyed many experiences.
There were others which he had not enjoyed, but, rather, had
endured. He had, for example, enjoyed his return to Parliament
for a constituency which was very much surprised to find it was
represented in the House of Commons by a gentleman of whose
existence it was almost unaware. He had endured the petition for
his unseating and, after one hectic and not wholly happy week in
the Mother of Parliaments, he had applied for the Chiltern
Hundreds.</p>

<p>'Because, dear old boy,' said his legal adviser, 'it is
better to walk out than to be chucked out with a charge of
conspiracy to follow.'</p>

<p>One excellent result had followed Tony Newton's 'election' to
Parliament. He had secured for himself an extraordinary amount
of publicity and the consequences of this advertisement were to
prove both exhilarating and profitable. For he came under the
notice of Lammer Green. He was sitting in the lounge of his
hotel, smoking an after dinner cigar when the acquaintanceship
began. A pair of huge hands descended upon his shoulders, he was
lifted bodily from his chair and a raucous voice demanded:</p>

<p>'Give me back that shilling.'</p>

<p>The request was followed by a vigorous shake, at the end of
which time there was a clang of metal.</p>

<p>'Thank you,' said the voice, and Mr Lammer Green stooped and
picked up the shilling which had fallen down the leg of Tony's
trousers. Incidentally it had been slipped down between his
collar and his neck by the joker and the shaking had brought it
to the tiled floor.</p>

<p>Tony struggled to his feet, murder in his heart and glowered
into the grinning face of Lammer Green.</p>

<p>'Oh, it's you, is it?' he growled, for he knew the king of
practical jokers slightly.</p>

<p>The Hon. Lammer Green stood six feet four in his stockinged
feet, a large rawboned young man who lived for no other object
than to perpetrate practical jokes upon an unoffending world. It
was he who had appeared on board the French Cruiser 'Arlot' in
the guise of the Sultan of Muskwash and had fooled the admiral
into giving him a royal salute on his departure. It was he who
had arrived with a gang of labourers and had torn up the roadway
of Piccadilly Circus just before the theatres closed, and held
up the traffic in the heart of London for twelve hours. It was
Lammer Green who arrested the mayors of three prosperous
boroughs and brought them to London in a Black Maria built
specially for the purpose.</p>

<p>He was heir to a title, incredibly rich and a bachelor.</p>

<p>'Men have died for less than that,' said Tony, ruffled, 'sit
down, you long and useless slab.'</p>

<p>They had not met since their army days, a fact of which Tony
reminded his beaming companion.</p>

<p>'War isn't my game,' said Mr Green decidedly, 'there isn't a
joke in it, old boy. Give me peace! Did you hear about my
Greenwich coup? Nearly got three months for it, but, by gad, it
was amusing! I hired a fellow to climb up to the observatory
telescope and paint black spots on the lens. Sun spots, old
boy!'</p>

<p>He chuckled and slapped his bony knee in an ecstasy of
joyousness.</p>

<p>Tony looked at him wonderingly.</p>

<p>'I can't understand why a fellow like you, with all the money
in the world, should spend your time footling with life. Why the
devil don't you get married and settle down?'</p>

<p>'I should hate it, old boy,' said Lammer Green with a
shudder, 'I'm scared of women&mdash;scared of 'em, old man! If I
had a wife I'd be a slave&mdash;any woman could boss
me&mdash;that's my weakness.'</p>

<p>And then to Tony's surprise he began laughing again.</p>

<p>'Odd, deuced odd you should mention marriage. Newton, I've
been hearing about you.'</p>

<p>'About me?' said Anthony, startled, 'In connection with
marriage?'</p>

<p>Mr Green nodded violently.</p>

<p>'Do you remember fooling a lawyer johnny&mdash;a sort of
marriage broker?'</p>

<p>Tony remembered the incident perfectly.</p>

<p>'I heard about it&mdash;and this election joke of yours,'
said Mr Green, 'and thinking it over, said I to myself, "I must
see this Newton johnny."'</p>

<p>Now Tony Newton was anything but a practical joker. He
regarded such practices as had earned fame for Lammer Green as
childish and contemptible. The two men had served together in
the same regiment, but could not by any stretch of imagination
be described as friends. Green was looked upon as an amiable
fool, though a man of considerable courage. His was the last
acquaintance that Tony had any desire to renew, and even in the
days of his direst misfortune it had never occurred to him that
he might seek help in that quarter.</p>

<p>'The fact is, old boy, I've got a joke on,' said Lammer
Green, lowering his voice, 'a real topping joke, better than my
coup with the admiral. And in all the circumstances, it is
remarkable that you should have mentioned marriage. Do you know
old Gaggle?'</p>

<p>Tony shook his head.</p>

<p>'Made millions out of margarine,' explained Green rapidly,
got a country seat at Oxton, Bucks, and a knighthood and a
daughter of thirty with a face that would stop the traffic!
She's horrible, old boy. She's perfectly ghastly. Dyes her hair,
old man. Got feet like rowing boats. And old Gaggle's mad keen
to get her married into the aristocracy&mdash;do you get
me?'</p>

<p>His eyes were blazing with excitement, his voice was a squeak
at the thought of his splendid project. Tony could only look at
the fatuous young man open mouthed. He knew that it was Lammer
Green's practice to enlist the aid of supporters, but never in
his wildest dreams had he imagined that he would be so honoured.
And he was very curious. As Lammer Green saw a crude jest at the
end of all his schemings, so Anthony Newton saw money.</p>

<p>'What is the great idea?' he asked and it was some time
before the Joker could compose himself to answer.</p>

<p>'Old Gaggle is keen on lords; he openly states that if his
daughter marries one, he'll give her half a million. My father
heard about it and sent on the news to me&mdash;he loves a
joke.'</p>

<p>Lammer Green's father was Lord Latherton, who loved many
other things than jokes, if rumour did not lie.</p>

<p>'My scheme is this,' said Mr Green confidentially,
'accompanied by my faithful secretary&mdash;that's you, Newton,
old boy&mdash;I'll be touring in the neighbourhood and my car
will break down near old man Gaggle's house. I will say nothing.
You'll go for assistance and let slip the words 'his
highness'&mdash;get me? Old man Gaggle will invite us up to the
house. If I speak it will be in a foreign accent. Old man Gaggle
will say "Ah, ha! A foreign prince! Let's get him for
Gertie"&mdash;or whatever her name is. I will say, "Yes, I will
be married very quietly &mdash;nobody must know or I shall lose
my throne"&mdash;get me?'</p>

<p>'I get you,' said Tony, recovering his breath.</p>

<p>'Papa, prince and Gertie will travel to a house, parson
waiting &mdash;you'll have to fake the parson, one of your pals
will do it for you&mdash;and then prince has to go to town.
Mysteriously disappears. Papers full of it&mdash;"Romantic
Wedding. Disappearance of princely bridegroom-where is Prince
Opskotch?" What do you think of that?'</p>

<p>'And what happens to me&mdash;do I disappear too?' said
Anthony drily.</p>

<p>It was on the tip of his tongue to refuse all participation
in the fantastic 'joke' which did not err on the side of
kindness. Tony had a nice feeling for most women, even women
with 'feet like boats', and he was momentarily wrathful that
this futile jester should have thought that he would be a
willing agent.</p>

<p>But Tony was also a quick thinker and the rejection was not
made.</p>

<p>'It's a strange plan and rather cruel on the girl,' he said
mildly.</p>

<p>'Pshaw!' said the other contemptuously. 'What does that
matter? My dear old fellow, this is my chef d'oeuvre&mdash;the
inspiration&mdash;the grandest scheme that has ever come into my
head. The whole world will be talking about it. It will create
more sensation than anything that's been done before!'</p>

<p>'I'll think it over,' said Tony.</p>

<p>He thought it over to such purpose that when Mr Lammer Green
called the next day he found an apparently willing helper.</p>

<p>Sir Joshua Gaggle lived at Oxton Manor, a Georgian residence
that had once been the property of a Norman baron. But it was
less because of its ancient associations that Sir Joshua
purchased the estate than because of its title. For Sir Joshua
had been born and bred in another Oxton.</p>

<p>'Mark my words, Tilda, that's 'ow it ought to be spelt.
Personally I've never called 'Oxton any other way.'</p>

<p>His daughter was a slim woman of twenty-nine, whose rubicund
face shone with good health.</p>

<p>Such ruddiness might well have gone with a genial and
generous nature, but Matilda had a sharp tongue and a nature
embittered by the neglect of eligible bachelors. There were not
wanting young men who would gladly have led Matilda to the
altar, but she was a woman with ambitions.</p>

<p>'I don't know that this country manor idea is going to bring
anything,' she said petulantly, 'we'd better by half have stayed
at Hampstead, father&mdash;with your knighthood you'd have been
somebody in Hampstead, but this place is full of lords and
people and nobody thinks anything of a plain 'sir'. And when we
ask them to dinner they've always got other engagements.'</p>

<p>'Somebody will turn up, my love,' said Sir Joshua hopefully,
'you couldn't meet anybody at 'Ampstead except a few low-down
clurks and whippersnappers.'</p>

<p>'I don't even meet those here,' said Matilda plaintively.</p>

<p>They were sitting in the drawing-room overlooking the park
and her eyes were arrested by the sight of a stranger walking up
the drive.</p>

<p>He was young and well dressed. Moreover, he was good looking.
She got up and walked to the window.</p>

<p>'Who's that, father?' she asked and Sir Joshua joined
her.</p>

<p>'I don't know who it is,' he frowned and walked out into the
hall to await the stranger's arrival.</p>

<p>'I am sorry to trouble you. Sir Joshua,' said the stranger
respectfully, 'but his Highness&mdash;I mean my
employer&mdash;has had a slight fainting fit and I wonder if you
would allow him to rest here awhile?'</p>

<p>'Certainly... certainly!' said Sir Joshua urgently, 'ask his
Highness&mdash;what name did you say?'</p>

<p>Tony bit his lip.</p>

<p>'Did I say "highness"? How indiscreet of me,' he said,
obviously annoyed. 'My employer's name is Smith&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Exactly,' said Sir Joshua, 'will you tell his&mdash;Mr
Smith, that he is welcome.'</p>

<p>When Tony had gone, the agitated knight flew back into the
drawing-room, his eyes bulging.</p>

<p>'It's a prince!' he quavered. 'Tilda, it's an 'ighness! No,
not the man who came to the door&mdash;he's an understrapper or
something. The other fellow... 'ad a fainting fit outside and
wanted to know if he could come in.'</p>

<p>Miss Gaggle rose.</p>

<p>'Father, mind your "h's",' she warned, and swept out to the
door.</p>

<p>A magnificent car was coming up the drive, the young man at
the wheel, and in the back, wrapped in a fur-lined overcoat, a
tall and (as she afterwards described him) noble figure.</p>

<p>His eyes were closed, and when the car had stopped and Tony
had assisted him to alight, he appeared to wilt.</p>

<p>'It is goot of you, my dear yo'ng lady,' he murmured. 'We
shall not forget your kindness to us.'</p>

<p>Tilda dropped a curtsey.</p>

<p>'I'm sure we're very honoured, your&mdash;Mr Smith,' she said
breathlessly.</p>

<p>The newcomer was escorted to the guest room and a few minutes
later Tony descended, his face grave.</p>

<p>'I am afraid we shall have to trespass on your hospitality
for to-night&mdash;I simply cannot allow him to be moved. No, no,
he will not see a doctor,' he added hastily, as Sir Joshua made
a suggestion.</p>

<p>Mr Smith was destined to enjoy the hospitality of his host
for many days; and they were days of hope for Sir Joshua Gaggle
and hours of joy for his daughter.</p>

<p>'I don't know whether he's a prince or not,' she said to her
father in the seclusion of his study, 'but he's a
somebody&mdash;I've seen enough of nobodies to know that. And
such a fine big man too! And he'd be an easy man to manage,
father&mdash;he's almost scared of me.'</p>

<p>In the privacy of his own suite, the Hon. Mr Lammer Green
expressed his own hopes and fears.</p>

<p>'I hate bossy women, Newton, and she's the bossiest girl I've
ever met. We'd better get this over&mdash;I'm bored already.
Have you fixed a parson?'</p>

<p>Tony nodded.</p>

<p>'Then I'll propose to her to-morrow,' said the joker. 'Gosh!
She'll be surprised!'</p>

<p>'I think she will,' agreed Tony.</p>

<p>That night he sat up late with his host and after a few
preliminaries. Sir Joshua spoke.</p>

<p>'Look here, Mr Newton,' he said (Tony had given his real
name). 'I'm a plain man and I like to talk plainly&mdash;who is
his highness?'</p>

<p>Tony shook his head.</p>

<p>'I'm not at liberty to say,' he said.</p>

<p>'Is he&mdash;anybody? I mean is he really a titled
person?'</p>

<p>Tony nodded. If the prefix 'honourable' was a title, then
certainly the Hon. John Lammer Green was a titled person.</p>

<p>'That's all I want to know,' said Sir Joshua, 'has he got any
money?'</p>

<p>'Pots of it,' said Tony promptly and Sir Joshua seemed
disappointed.</p>

<p>'I was 'oping he was broke,' he said. 'The fact is my girl's
took a fancy to him. He's not married?'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'Look here, Mr What's&mdash;your&mdash;name, have you any
influence with him?'</p>

<p>'I think I have,' said Tony, and Sir Joshua took the
plunge.</p>

<p>'To put it plump and plain, if you could influence him to
marry my daughter, there's a couple of thousand pounds for
you.'</p>

<p>Tony looked at the tempter for a long time before he
spoke.</p>

<p>'I'm a business man too,' he said, 'and I'd like to have that
in writing.'</p>

<p>Sir Joshua put out his hand.</p>

<p>'Business is business,' he said cryptically, and, going to
his writing table produced with some labour a document which had
the advantage of being in plain English. 'That suit you?'</p>

<p>Tony read the document through and nodded.</p>

<p>'If this is carried through,' he said, 'you quite understand
that the wedding would have to be of a strictly private nature?
That it might even be necessary for my friend to marry in his
assumed name?'</p>

<p>'I've thought of that,' said the businesslike Sir Joshua. 'I
know a bit of law&mdash;you can't be successful in trade unless
you do&mdash;and I know that a marriage is a marriage whether
it's in one name or another. I know he's somebody because I got
my valet to look through his letters the other day&mdash;I
daresay you'll think I was taking a liberty, but I'd rather take
that than a risk&mdash;and he saw a letter with a crown or
coronet that began "My dear son."'</p>

<p>Tony was staggered for a moment. Evidently Sir Joshua was not
as foolish as Mr Lammer Green thought him to be.</p>

<p>'I'm not expectin' a prince for a son-in-law,' the stout
little man went on, 'and I'm willing to be pleasantly surprised.
Fix that marriage, my boy, and there's two thousand of the best
for you.'</p>

<p>Mr Lammer Green was reading in bed when Tony went into his
room that night.</p>

<p>'Shut the door,' said Mr Green, 'and have a look at the press
notices I've written. Get 'em typed after the wedding and send
'em round to the press. I shall tell her I'm the Grand Duke John
of Lithuania&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You won't be married in that name?' suggested Tony.</p>

<p>'Why not? That's the best part of the joke,' said the
surprised young man. 'Have you fixed the parson?'</p>

<p>'And the church,' said Tony and Mr Green sat up in bed.</p>

<p>'What?'</p>

<p>'I've got the loan of a church&mdash;a little wayside kirk
about twelve miles from here&mdash;it is attached to a bigger
parish and the parson only goes there once a week. My friend has
the keys.'</p>

<p>Mr Lammer Green threw himself on his pillow and shrieked with
joy.</p>

<p>'You're certainly the best assistant I've ever had,' he said,
wiping his eyes. 'It was an inspiration getting you, Newton. By
gad! This is going to make London howl! This is going to beat
the Piccadilly Circus stunt&mdash;'</p>

<p>'There is one thing I want to ask you,' interrupted Tony.
'Granted that this is the most wonderful practical joke that has
been played since the Albert Memorial was built, do you think
that you're quite playing the game? After all, this unfortunate
young woman has never done you any harm&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Hasn't she?' snorted the jester. 'She's trying to lure me
into marriage. And she's bossy! She orders roe about and I obey
so naturally that my blood runs cold! She's bossy, Newton! I
never met a bossier.'</p>

<p>Anthony left him to work out his part of the joke.</p>

<p>It was on the following afternoon that Miss Matilda Gaggle
heard her fate. The scene was the rosery and the principal actor
reclined on a long cane settee.</p>

<p>'Ah, Miss Giggles,' he sighed. 'We shall always remember zis
happy, happy time!'</p>

<p>He covered his eyes with a huge hand and the practical Miss
Gaggle thrust her handkerchief into his fingers.</p>

<p>'It has been happy,' she agreed. 'Don't move your foot or
you'll upset the grapes. Mr Smith, why don't you wear your hair
parted on the side&mdash;I don't like hair that's brushed
back.'</p>

<p>Lammer Green heard and quaked.</p>

<p>'And your valet hasn't brushed your coat,' she said, sweeping
it daintily with the tips of her fingers. Mr Lammer Green
shivered. She was certainly the bossiest girl he'd ever met.</p>

<p>'Matilda,' he murmured, and Matilda forgot to be tidy.
'Matilda... need we part?'</p>

<p>'I don't see why we should,' said Matilda and kissed him on
the ear... .</p>

<p>Tony Newton arranged everything.</p>

<p>'That young man has a future, my dear,' beamed Sir
Joshua.</p>

<p>'I daresay he has,' agreed Matilda briskly, 'though I don't
know that I shall want to see much of him after we're married.
The idea of delaying the honeymoon&mdash;'</p>

<p>'That was John's,' said her father, 'he has to go to town
immediately after the wedding to get the family jewels.'</p>

<p>'Why couldn't we both go?' demanded Matilda. 'No, I don't
like Mr Newton&mdash;he's a bit too bossy.'</p>

<p>Upon Tony, the bridegroom placed the heaviest of charges.
'Don't leave us alone, old boy,' he begged. 'She started kissing
my ear without the slightest encouragement. She's one of those
horrible women who simply can't be trusted. Keep with me, old
boy, until the ceremony. I promised you a hundred for the
job&mdash;I'll make it two hundred. But don't let her kiss
me.'</p>

<p>'A girl has her rights,' said Tony sternly. 'If she wants to
kiss you, she must.'</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he kept close company with his employer and
escorted him to bed on the eve of the ceremony, to the intense
annoyance of Miss Gaggle.</p>

<p>For Tony had something serious to say. 'I've been thinking
things over, Lammer Green,' he said, 'and it seems to me that
this little joke of yours is going to turn out very serious for
you&mdash;you know the law on the subject?'</p>

<p>'Blow the law!' said the scornful suitor.</p>

<p>'There's one chance of escaping a prison sentence,' said
Tony, 'and that is to prove that you were the victim and I the
villain of the piece.'</p>

<p>Tony explained his plan. On the morning on his way to church,
Mr Lammer Green was to stuff his ears with cotton wool.</p>

<p>'But, my dear old boy, I shall hear nothing!' protested the
bridegroom.</p>

<p>'That will save you,' said Tony. 'When I nod, you'll say
"yes." When I wink you'll say "I, so and so and so and so take
thee, etc." You'd better mumble the words&mdash;people always do
when they get married. If there's any fuss you can say you
didn't hear and that you thought you were acting as best man to
me&mdash;it will make a great story for the newspapers.'</p>

<p>They were at the church a quarter of an hour before the
arrival of the bride. She wore, by arrangement, a very plain
frock and Mr Lammer Green shuddered at the sight. But he was
immensely pleased with Tony. For the 'parson' looked like a
parson. He had a cold in the head, just as a real country parson
might have and his surplice was an old one and his fingers were
blue with cold; and he was obviously bored. Mr Lammer Green,
with his eye on Tony, said "Yes" as the ceremony demanded and he
mumbled huskily the necessary formula when hands were
joined.</p>

<p>As the happy couple passed into the vestry, Tony drew Sir
Joshua aside.</p>

<p>'I am afraid I shall have to leave early,' he said, and Sir
Joshua took a cheque from his waistcoat pocket.</p>

<p>'I saw two cars waiting outside,' he said, 'one of them
yours?'</p>

<p>'Hired,' said Tony laconically, 'I always hire a car when I
want to get away in a hurry.'</p>

<p>Sir Joshua hurried into the vestry in time to check the first
of many family quarrels.</p>

<p>'Your name is John Lammer Green,' said the new Honourable Mrs
Green shrilly. 'That's the name the marriage licence was issued
in and that's the name you were married in&mdash;so don't be
silly.'</p>

<p>Mr Lammer Green was very white and the hand that held the pen
shook. He had taken out the cotton wool and could hear quite
well.</p>

<p>He stared wildly at the parson.</p>

<p>'Excuse me... are you a clergyman?'</p>

<p>The clergyman inclined his head.</p>

<p>'I am curate of St Margaret's,' he said.</p>

<p>The bridegroom's jaw dropped.</p>

<p>'And I'm... married?'</p>

<p>'Of course... married by special licence&mdash;your friend
arranged it all.'</p>

<p>Mr Lammer Green breathed heavily through his nose.</p>

<p>'No friend of mine,' he wailed. 'No friend of mine!'</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="story11" id="story11">XI. &mdash; KATO</a></h2>

<p class="first">BRIGANDAGE, Mr Newton admitted, must be gentle
to be thoroughly effective. Only once in his life did he descend
to the other kind, and the memory of Kato and that ill-considered
burglary kept him supplied in nightmare material for
years afterwards.</p>

<p>The burglary was an error: its consequence almost turned
white the hair of one young man. If Mr Newton ever wrote his
autobiography he would probably omit all reference to Poltue and
his emerald; and to Kato who hated his master.</p>

<p>The story starts when two men sat upon two park chairs,
watching the procession of fashion and beauty along Rotten Row
one spring morning. They were well-dressed idlers of the type
which may be seen in Hyde Park on any such morning and they had,
apparently, no other interest in life than an examination of
humanity.</p>

<p>The two chairs had been so drawn together and so placed that
they were isolated from the remaining spectators, and they
might, as they did, carry on a conversation without any fear
that their words would carry to their nearest neighbours.</p>

<p>Tony Newton tilted his hat forward on his brow, and crossed
his well-tailored legs. Neither he nor his companion had the
appearance of birds of prey; yet, for the moment, society knew
fewer efficient, and none more amiable, hawk than he.</p>

<p>'There is our man. Bill,' said Tony, nodding his head
slightly in the direction of a stout horseman who was jogging a
painful way along the Row. 'Mr Poltue, the eminent millionaire
from Japan.'</p>

<p>'I knew he was a millionaire the moment I saw him,' said
Bill. 'He looks so darned uninteresting.'</p>

<p>Tony nodded.</p>

<p>'It is possibly because I am a brigand,' he said, carefully
choosing his words, 'and therefore, possessed of the artistic
temperament, that the sight of a fat millionaire upon a
beautiful Arab horse, invariably rouses all that is basest
within me. Lest that conscience of yours should grow active,
Bill, I will assure you that Mr Poltue is well deserving of the
doom that is about to overtake him.'</p>

<p>Bill Farrel started under the accusation.</p>

<p>'Conscience&mdash;me!' he protested hoarsely,
'listen&mdash;'</p>

<p>But Tony was a bad listener.</p>

<p>'Poltue has made millions out of everything,' he said. 'He
has made businesses and coal mines and ships&mdash;in fact, he's
made everything except sacrifices. At the outbreak of the war he
found himself in Japan, and got himself appointed as buying
agent for one of the Allies. That Ally he fleeced left and
right.'</p>

<p>'It seems right to me,' said Bill. 'Allies are made to be
fleeced, aren't they? What has he done which is really naughty?
Forgive me for asking the question, but I've been out of touch
with the crime reports, and I take very little interest in
sociological matters, anyway.'</p>

<p>'He's a bad egg,' said Tony, watching the retreating figure
of the portly Mr Poltue. 'He's not only a bad egg because he
made money which we didn't make&mdash;and that, heaven knows, is
sufficient offence. He not only put it together whilst we were
being taken apart, but he has a moral reputation which you could
cut with a knife. He runs a sort of establishment in Grosvenor
Square, and they say that when he left Japan he had to be
smuggled on board a boat to avoid the attentions of a number of
good natured sons of Nippon who were most anxious to&mdash;give
him a farewell presentation.'</p>

<p>'He's like that, is he?' said Bill, thoughtfully. 'It's rum
how these big gross devils manage to get away with that sort of
stuff. Now, what's the scheme?'</p>

<p>Anthony Newton lowered his voice by the fraction of a
tone.</p>

<p>'He has a Japanese servant named Kato,' he said, 'and I have
an idea that Kato has been almost as bad an egg as his boss. But
for some reason the rascals have quarrelled, and the other day
Mr Poltue gave Kato the licking of his life. Kato tried to put
some jiu-jitsu hooks on the big man, but Poltue knew the game
backwards, and the upshot of it was that Kato took the floor and
the count.'</p>

<p>'Where did you learn this?' asked Bill, without surprise.</p>

<p>'From Kato,' said Tony. 'I was engaged last week in the
beginnings of a great enterprise. Unfortunately, my objective
had to leave for America. It was annoying, because I had gone to
a lot of trouble and expense. For one week I have been arrayed
in the base uniform of a chauffeur, and as a chauffeur I used
the same Japanese restaurant as Kato. There's a place just off
Wardour Street&mdash;you know Ho Sing's restaurant&mdash;it was
there that I met Kato, having industriously followed quite
another Jap for weeks. Happily, the little chap speaks English,
or I should have been in the can, because my knowledge of
Japanese is restricted to about three bad words.'</p>

<p>'What was the result of it all?' demanded Bill.</p>

<p>The result of it all was that I have conveyed, by my subtle
and Machiavellian methods, the suggestion that I am really a
gentleman burglar.'</p>

<p>Bill looked at him a little startled.</p>

<p>'There are times when one must be frank,' said Tony, in his
more oracular manner. 'I have reached that point. Kato believes
that I am one of an American gang which has been working Paris,
and he takes almost a tender interest in my future career.'</p>

<p>Again his voice lowered until it was little more than a
murmur. 'Have you heard of Poltue's emerald?'</p>

<p>Bill shook his head.</p>

<p>'It is the most wonderful thing in the world,' said Tony,
with a tremble of enthusiasm. 'Its nett value to-day is fifty
thousand pounds. Doesn't that make your mouth water? And Poltue
keeps it in a little safe let into the wall by the side of his
bed. I tell you he is a great athlete, a dead shot with a
revolver, and that the safe is electrically wired, because it is
right that you should know these things, since you are going to
be asked to risk your life in securing this emerald of great
price.'</p>

<p>'Have you squared Kato?'</p>

<p>'Not yet,' admitted Tony, 'but he is on the way to being
squared, and then&mdash;'</p>

<p>Three hours later a businesslike young chauffeur with a
peaked cap on the back of his head turned briskly into Ho Sing's
restaurant. There was a sprinkling of lunchers, half of whom
were unmistakably oriental, the other half being European; for
Ho Sing's had a reputation which appealed to epicureans.</p>

<p>He nodded to a little man sitting at one of the tables, and
turned down the chair which had been tilted against the edge,
and the little man grinned sympathetically.</p>

<p>'I thought I would not be able to come,' he said, with a
slight accent, and in the staccato tone which the educated
Japanese employs when speaking English. 'But that pig he goes
riding, and after he lunches. Consider it! He lunches in his
riding clothes because he is a low swank.'</p>

<p>Tony was visibly amused.</p>

<p>'By golly!' said the Japanese, viciously. 'I'd like to see
him get a bad time! Suppose one day he lose that emerald, he be
a mighty sick fellow.'</p>

<p>His eyes were fixed on Tony and Tony nodded.</p>

<p>'I endorse all that you say, my amiable son of Nippon,' he
said. 'But how is he going to lose this wonderful emerald?'</p>

<p>The beady eyes of the Jap were fixed on the other in an
inscrutable stare.</p>

<p>'Suppose burglars come on Thursday night,' he said, 'through
the kitchen door, which would be open, and up the stairs? And
suppose they find a little Japanese lantern outside the door of
this pig's room?'</p>

<p>Only for a moment did Tony's heart quake.</p>

<p>That seems a fairly healthy possibility,' he said, to say
nothing of being somewhat ingenious. It would save all bother of
making plans of the house, or having a guide&mdash;in other
words, Kato, it would save you from being mixed up in the
affair.'</p>

<p>That is true,' said Kato calmly. 'I have thought of it very
carefully.'</p>

<p>'And suppose,' said Tony, 'we get away with the
emerald&mdash;when I say "we",' he corrected himself, 'I mean
this hideous burglar&mdash;and dispose of the stuff, where would
we send the share which would be due to the gentleman who left
the kitchen door open and put the little Japanese lantern in
front of Mr Poltue's door?'</p>

<p>The Jap shook his head.</p>

<p>'I don't want anything,' he said, emphatically. 'I'll be
pleased if this pig gets a bad time.'</p>

<p>'We'll give him a bad time!' said Tony. Then he asked
bluntly: 'What has he done to you, Kato?'</p>

<p>The man pressed his lips together and shook his head and it
seemed that Tony's curiosity was to be denied. Then he suddenly
burst forth in a torrent of broken English, and in low,
passionate tones told the story of yet another wrong which was
to be added to Poltue's unsavoury record.</p>

<p>'And I wasn't greatly impressed,' said Tony, relating the
circumstances that evening to his companion. 'Because Kato is as
bad as the other fellow, and I should say there was nothing very
much to choose between them. Kato was the man who carried out
all Poltue's dirty work in Japan, and be himself had to be given
police protection in the days before he shook the dust of his
native land from his feet. The fact that the two beggars have
quarrelled doesn't make very much difference except that it
helps us considerably in relieving this bloated Japanese
merchant of his ill-gotten gains&mdash;or some of them.'</p>

<p>'Is it Thursday, then?' asked the interested Bill, and Tony
nodded.</p>

<p>'Felt slippers, a car waiting at the entrance to the
mews&mdash;you'd better bring the fastest you can get, by the
way&mdash;masks and dummy revolvers, a few yards of thick rope
and some big silk handkerchiefs, in case the gentleman shows
fight. You'll attend to that, Bill?'</p>

<p>Bill hesitated.</p>

<p>'It sounds awfully like robbery with violence to me,' he
said, 'and I don't mind admitting that I'm a little shy of
it.'</p>

<p>'It's rather out of our line of business,' agreed Tony, 'but
the prize is so precious and the opportunity of avenging
outraged society&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Don't bother about that,' said Bill. 'The question is, how
are we going to dispose of the emerald when we get it?'</p>

<p>'Let's get it first,' suggested Mr Newton. And there they
were in complete agreement.</p>

<p>Thursday night was a rainy one&mdash;a night of wind and
drizzle &mdash;and this was all to the good, for the streets
were empty as the big car, containing the muffled figures of two
men, came to a halt at the end of the mews leading to the back
of Mr Poltue's palatial residence.</p>

<p>The mews itself was deserted.</p>

<p>Mr Poltue had apparently one virtue. He went to bed at nine
o'clock every night of his life and rose at six. He was,
according to Kato, a heavy sleeper; and, what was more
interesting and important, he insisted on the whole of his
household following his example. He was reputedly a single man,
which made matters easier, for it is womenfolk who keep houses
alight till two o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>The two men left the car and made their way down the mews
until they came to the little green door in the wall which led
through a narrow passage to the butler's offices. Tony pushed
the door gently and it yielded. He went in, closing the door
behind him, stopping to examine the lock and to make sure of his
exit being unimpeded.</p>

<p>Kato had done his work remarkably well. Every door opened
with a push, and they found themselves in the big entrance hall
of the house, with no other sound to disturb them than the
solemn ticking of a clock on the stairs.</p>

<p>Tony was wearing thick felt slippers and carried in one hand
a length of rope and in the other his torch. There was little
need, however, to use this, for a faint light came through the
big stained glass window at the head of the stairs. They went up
noiselessly and reached the first floor, but here there was no
sign of the promised Japanese lantern. They mounted another
flight, and here, as promised, the guiding light was
burning.</p>

<p>Tony waited only long enough to blow out the little candle
which burnt inside. His heart was thumping
painfully&mdash;burglary was distinctly unamusing.</p>

<p>The two men passed in, closing the door softly behind them.
It was difficult to see at first, but after a while, when their
eyes became accustomed to the darkness, and aided by the light
which came in narrow bands through the slats of the Venetian
blinds, they distinguished the various objects which constituted
the furniture of the room. They saw the bed. Its head rested
against the centre of the wall to the left of the door.</p>

<p>Tony stole forward. The carpet, he thought, must have been
designed by somebody who had an idea of helping midnight
intruders in their nefarious plans. It was so soft that it was
impossible that any sound could reach the ears of the sleeper.
Nevertheless, he moved forward with the utmost caution, whilst
his companion stood in the shadow of a big wardrobe, waiting
events.</p>

<p>Tony saw dimly the outline of a man upon the bed. He made no
sound or sign of movement; he reached the safe and felt gingerly
for the tiny wires which he knew connected the door with the
alarm. Kato had described the safe exactly. There was a soft
snick as the wires were cut, and deftly Tony manipulated the
moving dial of the combination. Here he had to use his lamp, but
only in brief flashes and the light was so guarded that it was
impossible that a ray could reach the sleeper.</p>

<p>The door swung open and he put in his hand, groping for the
big morocco leather case which Kato had told him contained the
emerald. His fingers closed round the big leather case. He did
not trouble to open it, for he knew by the weight and the shape,
that Poltue's emerald was in his hands. He slipped the case in
his pocket, but in doing so lost his grip on the lamp, which
fell with a clatter on the table by the bed.</p>

<p>He held his breath, but Poltue did not move. There was
something so ominous about this man's quietness that Tony
stooped, and, picking up his lamp, flashed it for a moment upon
the bed. Bill heard his gap and came forward.</p>

<p>'What is it?' he whispered.</p>

<p>'Look!' said Tony, and turned the light full upon the
man.</p>

<p>There was no need to make further enquiries. Poltue, the
millionaire, was dead. The haft of a knife was sticking out of
his side and the bed was smothered with blood.</p>

<p>'This looks like a trap,' said Tony, quickly. 'Get downstairs
as fast as you can.'</p>

<p>Silently they fled down the wide staircase and reached the
first door, where Bill gripped the other by the arm.</p>

<p>'There's somebody talking,' he said. 'Listen!'</p>

<p>'On the telephone,' said Tony, between his teeth.</p>

<p>They heard the faint tinkle of a bell and crept along the
passage until they came to a door, behind which was the murmur
of a voice.</p>

<p>Tony turned the handle softly. The room was illuminated, and
they saw the back of Kato crouching over a table, the telephone
in his hand, the receiver to his ear.</p>

<p>'Is that the police station?' he was saying. 'Come quickly to
Mr Poltue's house in Grosvenor Square. There has been a
murder... '</p>

<p>So far he got when Tony was on him with a leap. The telephone
fell with a crash as the two men went to the floor struggling,
Tony's hand over the Jap's mouth, his knee on his chest. It took
them the greater part of five minutes before they bound and
gagged him and time was precious.</p>

<p>'Carry him upstairs into the bedroom,' said Tony fiercely and
together they laboured up the stairs, the struggling body of the
man between them.</p>

<p>'Now unfasten the rope,' breathed Tony Newton, and his
companion wonderingly obeyed.</p>

<p>Tony walked to the wall and switched on the light.</p>

<p>'You've got a nerve,' he said grimly to the gagged man.
'You've blood on your hands, and you're calling for the police!
You thought you'd trap us&mdash;Carry out your private vendetta
and put the blame upon us?'</p>

<p>For answer the man sprang at him like some wild animal. Tony
stepped back a foot, brought his hand up and down again, and the
man fell in a heap at the foot of the bed where his victim
lay.</p>

<p>'Remove the gag,' said Tony. 'Step lively, and take off the
ropes.'</p>

<p>'What did you hit him with&mdash;the sjambok?'</p>

<p>Tony nodded, and slipped a short length of rhinoceros hide
into his pocket. It was the only weapon he ever carried and it
was usually effective.</p>

<p>They reached the ground floor and passed through into the
mews. Tony taking the key from the inside of the back door,
locking it and dropping the key down a handy grating. They
gained the car and moved off just as a car full of policemen
came swinging round the corner of the street.</p>

<p>'Well missed!' said Tony. He was very white.</p>

<p>'But he'll tell,' said the troubled Bill. 'He's bound to
tell.'</p>

<p>'Tell nothing,' said Tony, tersely.</p>

<p>'Where's the emerald?' asked the other. 'Did you get it?'</p>

<p>'I got it all right but I left it.'</p>

<p>'You left it!' gasped Bill. 'Where?'</p>

<p>'In Mr Kato's pocket,' said Tony. 'With a Japanese knife in
Poltue's side and Poltue's emerald in Kato's pocket, there
should be only one end to this adventure.'</p>

<p>And he spoke prophetically; for six weeks later Kato was
convicted of murder on circumstantial evidence.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="story12" id="story12">XII. &mdash; THE
GRAFT</a></h2>

<h3>First published as "Crooked Dealings" in <i>The Novel
Magazine</i>, April 1923</h3>

<p class="first">TONY NEWTON was an opportunist. And like most
opportunists, his equipment included the faculty for grasping
situations and acting upon his understanding with extraordinary
rapidity. The well-thought-out plan of battle, the laborious
strategy and patient attack which characterise the progress of
other successful men, were not for Tony. To him, life was full
of opportunities, most of which he instantly rejected: some
because they offered too little hope of reward, some because,
whilst the reward was sufficiently tempting, the means by which
the goal was to be reached seemed a little dubious.</p>

<p>It was only to be expected that the phenomenon of a young man
with no visible means of support, living well, dressing well,
and having plenty of money to spend should excite the curiosity
of other opportunists whose ways were not Tony's ways. From time
to time there swept into his orbit the aristocracy and gentry of
an unknown world. At least, they were unknown to Anthony.
Smartly dressed men, and women, too, also without visible means
of support drifted in upon him, sounded him skilfully, tempted
him with even greater ingenuity, and passed on. For Anthony
neither played cards nor visited gambling hells, nor fell to the
suggestion of easy money.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, they were intensely interesting to him, these
denizens of London's netherworld. They did not pretend to be
ladies or gentlemen; they were just 'good fellows'. And one, to
whom Anthony offered the tribute of a free dinner, gave a very
simple explanation. This was Jay Gaddit, expert cardsharper and
man-about-town.</p>

<p>'All these stories about gentlemanly crooks are rubbish,' he
said, smoking a meditative cigar after dinner. 'If you, whom I
will describe as a mug&mdash;'</p>

<p>Thank you,' said Anthony.</p>

<p>'There are only two kinds of people in the
world&mdash;thieves and mugs,' said the other calmly, 'so no
offence is meant. You, being a mug, meet one of the boys and
have dinner with him; and after dinner somebody suggests a game
of cards&mdash;probably some girl in the gang who drifts in.
Now, suppose the crook was a gentleman, and all through the
dinner you've been talking art and science and hunting and all
that sort of thing; and then he suddenly puts up the wheeze
about cards? The first thing you'd say to yourself is: "That
fellow must be a crook," because a gentleman wouldn't discuss
cards with a stranger. But suppose instead of being a gentleman,
he was a fellow like me&mdash;a bluff lad of the village, full
of fun and jollity, and the question of cards cropped up. You
wouldn't think twice about it. You'd look at me and say: "That
fellow's well dressed; I suppose he's got plenty of money. He's
a farmer, maybe, or a shopkeeper," and you'd trust me. Looking
expensive is part of my graft&mdash;and my graft is better than
others. Now look at that chap over there,' he pointed to a
good-looking, quietly and well dressed man. That's Sadbury&mdash;
at least, that's what he calls himself. Never touches a card. A
perfect gentleman if ever there was one&mdash;as far as his talk
goes.'</p>

<p>Anthony looked at the accomplished Mr Sadbury with
interest.</p>

<p>'What is his graft?' he asked, and the cardsharper chuckled
softly to himself.</p>

<p>'Bigamy,' was his startling reply, and Anthony gasped. 'He's
been married about six times, mostly to wealthy and middle-aged
widows,' he went on, and there was a note of reluctant
admiration in his voice. 'He picks them up on ships. Takes a
voyage to Australia; he's married within three or four days
after getting to Sydney. He's been married in Cape Town, Buenos
Aires, Ottawa, New York, Colombo, Vancouver and San Francisco.
He's never been caught because nobody's squealed on him. A woman
who's been robbed and fooled naturally doesn't make a squeal,
especially if she knows nothing about the others. I'm talking to
you as brother to brother.'</p>

<p>Anthony accepted the doubtful compliment with equanimity.</p>

<p>'Has he ever been in prison?'</p>

<p>'Three or four times,' said the other carelessly, 'but not
for bigamy. I can't say that it's a graft I like,' he said.
'Plain thieving and quick moving is my motto. Besides which, my
graft is less dangerous. One of these days somebody's going to
get onto Sadbury, and he'll be shot up, as sure as I'm sitting
here.'</p>

<p>Jim looked at the bigamist wonderingly. A black-haired man in
the late twenties, he was talking to his companion, a slovenly,
down-at-heels man, whose furtive eyes and trembling hand were
discernible even from that distance.</p>

<p>'That is hardly a prospective victim?' said Anthony.</p>

<p>Jay Gaddit shook his head.</p>

<p>'He's a poor dope&mdash;a fellow who takes sleep-stuff. What
Sadbury is doing with him, I can't guess.'</p>

<p>In the course of his wanderings about London, Tony came into
touch with almost every branch of those nefarious trades which
prey upon the unwary, the simple-minded and the super-clever. He
had no friends, few hobbies, but his evenings, so far from being
the dullest part of the day, were often the most
instructive.</p>

<p>To Anthony there was only one girl in all the world, and he
never let his mind rest upon her. For, although he was inclined
toward romanticism, it never occurred to him that Jane Mansar, a
millionaire's daughter, whose beauty was ever with him, and by
whom he compared all other women, was for such an adventurer as
he. He was no longer a penniless adventurer&mdash;thanks to a
number of enterprises which had proved more profitable than he
in his wildest dreams had ever imagined-but an adventurer.</p>

<p>He had met Jane at the commencement of his career. A car
accident, faked in order to bring him into close communion with
Mr Gerald Mansar, her hard-faced progenitor, had ended painfully
for him. The possibility of the acquaintance being renewed did
not seem likely. He did not even speculate upon such an
impossible happening. So Anthony Newton wandered alone through
the queer byways of London; learnt to know by sight and name men
who had a trick of disappearing for months at a time; heard the
gossip and scandal of the underworld and numbered amongst its
citizens at least two delightful acquaintances, who, when the
first misunderstandings had blown away and when they had
discovered that he was neither mug nor copper, were ready to
exchange confidences.</p>

<p>For some time after Anthony had dined with his criminal
acquaintance, Gaddit, the cardsharper, disappeared. He had 'gone
to the country', his friends told him politely. But three months
later, Tony learnt that he had gone to 'The Awful Place', and
'The Awful Place' is Dartmoor. Three or four days later came a
letter, written on blue paper, and headed 'HM Prison,
Princetown'. Anthony did not trouble to think how the man had
obtained his address. The knowledge of these things was part of
his stock-in-trade. The letter began:</p><br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr Newton</span>,</p>

<p class="letter">I hope you will pardon me addressing you, but
I've been put away for three years on false evidence. Anyway it
wasn't all true. Unfortunately, when I was taken I had very
little money, and I left my wife totally unprovided for I wonder
if it is too much to ask you to see if you can do anything for
her?'</p><br>

<p>It was a curious request, the like of which had never come to
Anthony before, but he never hesitated. Writing down the address
which the convict had given, he called a taxi, and in a few
minutes was deposited at the door of a block of flats in
Bloomsbury. The door of No. 69 was opened to his knock by a
tall, slender girl of 327, undeniably pretty. She glanced
suspiciously at Tony, but in a few words he explained his
errand.</p>

<p>'Come in Mr Newton,' she said, and ushered him into a small,
pretty drawing-room.</p>

<p>Tony had no idea how the wives of criminals behaved in
circumstances like these; but if he expected to find her
mournful, or showing signs of grief, he was to be
disillusioned.</p>

<p>'It only shows you the awful effect of drink. If he'd been
sober he wouldn't have been caught,' she said. 'And after all
the help I'd given him, it was a little disgusting for him to go
away and leave me only a hundred and fifty.'</p>

<p>Tony was staggered. With her quick perception the woman saw
the impression she had created and laughed.</p>

<p>'You didn't expect to find me crying, did you, Mr Newton?
After all, this isn't the first time Jay's gone to the country,
though he's never had a lagging before. As to money, I really
don't want any,' she said, after a few moments' thought. 'I'm
working with a friend of mine and I've just enough&mdash;if
Sadbury hadn't played me such a low trick, I should be well
off.'</p>

<p>The name was familiar to him,</p>

<p>'Oh, you mean the bigamist?'</p>

<p>'Bob told you all about him, didn't he? That man is certainly
no gentleman. After I'd put five days' honest work into him, he
went away without saying thank you, or anything.'</p>

<p>One thing Tony had learnt of these curious people, and that
was never to ask questions. He had to guess what was the 'honest
work' Mrs Gaddit had 'put into' Sadbury&mdash;and he was a bad
guesser.</p>

<p>He went back to his own hotel with a sense of relief. A
knowledge of the crooked fraternity had its embarrassing
moments. He was busy himself for about that time he was engaged
in one of innumerable enterprises. It was three months before he
again saw Mrs Gaddit, and then she was in the park. She was
driving in a beautiful car, with a chauffeur and footman in
attendance, and Tony smiled sympathetically at this proof of her
opulence.</p>

<p>It was the day after he had seen the woman driving in state,
that something happened which brought the heart into his throat
and the hue of the sunset to his face. He was walking down
Regent Street on his way to call upon his impecunious and
novel-writing lawyer friend, when somebody called him by name
and he turned.</p>

<p>At first that vision of radiant loveliness took his breath
away and he did not recognise her, thinking she had made a
mistake, but she came toward him, laughter in her eyes, her hand
outstretched.</p>

<p>'How are you, Mr Newton?'</p>

<p>For a second he was speechless, and could only shake Jane
Mansar's hand and gape at her.</p>

<p>'It is nearly a year since we saw you. You haven't called on
us.'</p>

<p>There was mischief in the lip trembling with suppressed
laughter and Tony surveyed her reproachfully.</p>

<p>'No, I haven't,' he said. His voice was a little husky, his
manner horribly gauche. 'The fact is I've been
busy&mdash;er&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Have they made you a Director of the Bank of England?' she
asked, innocently, and then: 'You can put your hat on. Apart
from the fact that you're drawing a great deal of attention to
yourself, you're liable to catch cold.'</p>

<p>Anthony with a muttered apology, put on his hat. He had not
been aware that he was bareheaded.</p>

<p>'We've often spoken about you,' she said, as they walked
slowly up the crowded street. 'Father and I, I mean. He thought
you were the cleverest of all of them.'</p>

<p>Anthony swallowed something, for he knew by 'all of them'
Miss Jane Mansar was referring to the unscrupulous young men who
had tried, by devious methods to obtain an introduction to her
wealthy parent.</p>

<p>'In fact, he wanted to see you,' she went on, and Anthony who
had recovered something of his self-possession, smiled.</p>

<p>'Does he want to send me to Brussels?' he asked, dryly.</p>

<p>'No, I don't think he does,' she said this time more
seriously. 'Your name cropped up when we were making out the
list of invitations to my wedding.'</p>

<p>Anthony stood stock-still.</p>

<p>'Your wedding?' he said, incredulously.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>'I'm marrying my cousin; I thought you knew; it was in the
papers.'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes,' said Anthony, trying to gain control of his voice.
Though why the news of her marriage should affect him so he was
at a loss to understand. 'I didn't know you had a cousin,' he
said, rather feebly, and she laughed.</p>

<p>'You don't know anything about me at all,' she answered, with
the old humour in her eyes, 'so don't pretend to, Mr Newton!
Though I have so few relatives that might have known Philip.
And, talking of-of angels, here is my beloved!'</p>

<p>There was nothing in her tone to suggest that Philip
Lassinger was particularly beloved by her. There was, indeed,
almost a savage vehemence in the word and Anthony turned to meet
a man whom he was prepared to hate.</p>

<p>Philip Lassinger was tall, fair, and his clean-shaven face
was more than ordinarily good-looking. Thereupon, Tony realised
that he hated all fair-headed men.</p>

<p>'This is Mr Newton,' introduced the girl, and they shook
hands.</p>

<p>'Surely not Mr Anthony Newton?' said Lassinger jovially. 'Oh,
boy, I've heard all about you!'</p>

<p>The girl sensed Tony's embarrassment.</p>

<p>Will you come to lunch with us, Mr Newton?' she said,
lowering her voice a little. 'I will brave father's annoyance,
though I don't think he'll be at all angry.'</p>

<p>Tony's first instinct was to refuse. He wanted to stalk
majestically away and commune with his broken heart, but he also
wanted lunch; and, more, he wanted the companionship of this
fairy-like dream that had so tragically materialised.</p>

<p>Mr Gerald Mansar was waiting in the palm court of the Carlton
when they came in, and at the sight of Anthony, his white
eyebrows went up.</p>

<p>'This is an unexpected pleasure,' he said, as he gripped
Anthony's hand ferociously. 'I think you owe me nine hundred
pounds.'</p>

<p>'You owe me an apology, which is worth much more than nine
hundred pounds to me,' said Tony coolly.</p>

<p>'I was stung, I admit it,' said Mansar apparently enjoying
the recollection. 'You know my nephew, Lassinger?'</p>

<p>He slapped Philip Lassinger on the back and it was easy for
Tony to see that the old man's admiration for the youth was
sincere. Before lunch ended, he realised that the marriage was
less agreeable to the girl than it was to her father. She seldom
spoke to her fiance and when she did it was only to make a
rejoinder to something he had said.</p>

<p>'What do you think of our prospective bridegroom, Newton?'
said the old man, pulling at his cigar after coffee was served.
'He's a world wanderer, my dear fellow... You turned out much
better than we ever expected, Phil.'</p>

<p>'I was a pretty bad egg as a boy wasn't I?' smiled Lassinger.
'I think wandering has put me straight, and the days I spent
alone on the ranch gave me a whole lot of time to think.'</p>

<p>It was not a pleasant meal for Tony, and long before they
parted he wished he had never come. When he got back to his
hotel that afternoon, it was to brood savagely upon the freak of
fate that had made this good-looking youth (Tony could not
honestly deny his good looks) an acceptable suitor to the one
girl in the world whom Anthony, in his secret heart,
worshipped.</p>

<p>He saw them together, driving down Piccadilly one day, and
Philip Lassinger was his own smiling self, but the girl seemed
paler, less vivid than when Tony had met her only a few days
before. He tried to forget her, but ever his mind wandered back;
and to tantalise him, the illustrated papers published full-page
photographs of the girl. Tony cut them all out and had them
pinned to the wall of his little bedroom.</p>

<p>The evening before the wedding he met her. It was a wet gusty
summer day, and in tune with the elements he was striding
savagely through Hyde Park, when he saw a figure ahead of him.
He would have passed without looking into the face of the girl,
only he heard her gasp of astonishment.</p>

<p>'This is fate,' she said, sombrely. 'Come and sit down.
There's a seat under those trees. The misguided park-keeper will
probably think we're courting, but if you can sustain that
horrible suspicion&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I can sustain anything in the world to-day&mdash;for you,'
said Anthony.</p>

<p>She sat down and looked at him, and anything less like a
bride-to-be Tony could not imagine. Her hat was wet through; she
had a bedraggled wisp of hair like a smear on her cheek; and her
eyes were bright and hard.</p>

<p>'I escaped from the preparations,' she said, 'and I nearly
came to your hotel only I wasn't quite sure which it was. What
do you think of it, Anthony Newton?'</p>

<p>'It's not a bad hotel,' began Tony.</p>

<p>'Please don't be humorous, or I shall scream!' she said.
'What do you think of my wedding?'</p>

<p>'I don't want to think about it,' said Tony, and a new light
came into her eyes.</p>

<p>'Do you really mean that?'</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>'I hate it,' she said in a low voice. 'But father has set his
heart on it. It was a short but tempestuous wooing&mdash;not of
me, I mean, but of father. And Philip is nice, and gallant and
never embarrasses me, and... but I don't want to marry him. I
feel like somebody in a condemned cell, and I'm counting every
minute, and oh! they pass so quickly, Tony!' There was a pause.
'Why I called you Tony, I don't know,' she said.</p>

<p>'Possibly because it is my name, but if there is any other
reason, I'll excuse you,' said Tony. 'Why do you get married,
Jane?'</p>

<p>'Why?... Well, father wants it... Of course, daughters do not
marry to please their fathers except in books and yet honestly
that is what I am doing. I can't hurt father.'</p>

<p>'You're going to hurt somebody more than your father,' said
Tony quietly. 'You're going to hurt me.'</p>

<p>She looked at him straightly.</p>

<p>'Do you mean that&mdash;too?'</p>

<p>He nodded, not trusting himself to speak. She was going to
say something, but suddenly she jerked herself to her feet.</p>

<p>'I can't stay any longer, or else I shall make a fool of
myself and, what will be more awful, I shall make you make a
fool of yourself! I'm going home to be a modern bride and total
up the wedding presents.'</p>

<p>She walked in silence to Prince's Gate, but the silence was
hers, for Tony pleaded, cajoled, even threatened.</p>

<p>'It's no good. Tony,' she said. 'Of course, I'm not in love
with you. It would be ridiculous to say I was. But I'm certainly
not in love with Philip. Perhaps you're the lesser of the two
evils. I'm sorry if that hurt you.' She squeezed his arm
affectionately and was gone before he realized that she had any
intention of leaving him so suddenly.</p>

<p>It was a sleepless night for Tony Newton. He was determined
not to go near the house or the church, but something stronger
than resolution took him, and he found himself one of a small
group of interested spectators outside the church at eleven
o'clock. As he stood watching with an aching heart the arrival
of the guests, a big car swept up to the awning and a man
stepped out, raising his hat to an acquaintance. It was Philip
Lassinger. He heard a 'tut' of impatience by his side, turned,
and to his amazement saw Mrs Gaddit, the cardsharper's wife.</p>

<p>'Hullo, Mr Newton!' she said. 'What do you think of that
grafter? For two bits I'd go over and blow the gaff. But you
don't know Sadbury.'</p>

<p>Tony's jaw dropped.</p>

<p>'Sadbury!' he gasped. 'You mean Lassinger?'</p>

<p>She nodded. 'That's his graft. It's a real cruel shame not to
go after him, though he'll leave her on the honeymoon.'</p>

<p>'But Sadbury's dark!' said Anthony hoarsely.</p>

<p>'I dyed his hair golden. It took five days, and he gave me
not a cent. I introduced him to that dope Lassinger&mdash;the
real Lassinger. He's supposed to have come back from South
America, but the real Lassinger's been in England for years.
Didn't Jay point him out to you?'</p>

<p>Then in a flash Tony remembered the seedy individual he had
seen dining with Sadbury.</p>

<p>'That's his graft, and he's some mover. He'll be careful with
this girl, otherwise he'll be getting a lifer&mdash;'</p>

<p>But Tony did not wait to hear any more. He saw the bridal car
turn into the broad road and in two seconds he was standing
under the awning. Mr Mansar handed out his daughter, a beautiful
figure in her wedding gown; and standing, while her train was
being adjusted, her eyes fell on Anthony. Mr Mansar saw him,
too, and frowned as Tony approached them.</p>

<p>'I want to speak to you, Mr Mansar.'</p>

<p>'I can't talk to you now, Newton,' said the other
impatiently.</p>

<p>This is a matter of life and death,' said Tony. 'The man you
call Lassinger is a crook named Sadbury.'</p>

<p>'You're mad!'</p>

<p>'Will you delay the wedding while the matter is investigated,
and I'll produce proof?'</p>

<p>'Certainly not,' said Mansar, going crimson with anger. 'Come
my love.'</p>

<p>But 'my love' did not move. 'Father, hadn't you better make
sure?'</p>

<p>'I will do nothing of the sort!' stormed Mansar, growing
furious as he found himself the centre of curious interest.</p>

<p>Reluctantly, the girl put out her arm to take her father's,
but Tony stepped in between them.</p>

<p>'Jane,' he said, and he spoke as one with authority, 'you go
home!'</p>

<p>For a second she hesitated, looking from her father to this
incongruous figure who had suddenly obtruded into the
festivities and then, without a word, she turned on her heel,
and, to the astonishment of the waiting footmen, stepped into
the car.</p>

<p>'Home!' she said, and Mr Mansar stood, paralysed with rage
and chagrin, as the car drove off.</p>

<p>'You scoundrel!' he hissed, shaking his fist in Tony's face.
'I'll have&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Produce your son-in-law,' said Tony, 'and I'll do all the
threatening that's necessary.'</p>

<p>The sound of the altercation brought the bridegroom to the
door of the church at that moment, and Tony beckoned to him.</p>

<p>'What the devil is the meaning of this?' he demanded.</p>

<p>'Sadbury, I want you,' said Anthony, and gripped the man's
arm professionally. And Mr Sadbury made the one mistake of an
otherwise blameless career.</p>

<p>'It's a cop,' he said. 'No rough stuff and I'll go
quietly.'</p>

<p>It was two months to the day when Tony Newton came to the
Branksome Tower Hotel at Bournemouth and walked into the private
suite of Mr Gerald Mansar with the air of the proprietor. Mr
Mansar had not returned from London. Tony hoped he would
not.</p>

<p>'Here's the full story,' he said. 'Sadbury made a confession.
He'd met Lassinger in London&mdash;Lassinger being a
ne'er&mdash;do&mdash;well who had been lost sight of for years.
When he heard of his relationship to your father, Sadbury got
himself made up and appeared in the role of a very successful
nephew.'</p>

<p>'He came into father's office one day, and daddy brought him
home,' said Jane; 'and, of course, he knew everything about us,
because the real Lassinger had told him. And I don't want to
know any more, Tony. Did you ask father?'</p>

<p>Tony nodded.</p>

<p>'Was he very angry?'</p>

<p>'A little,' said Anthony Newton cautiously. 'He raved a bit,
and cursed a bit&mdash;yes, he did, but in the end he said
"yes".'</p>

<p>She drew a long breath.</p>

<p>'I think you're wonderfully brave to beard the lion in his
den,' she said, and Anthony coughed and said nothing.</p>

<p>It was her father who told her that Anthony had asked for her
hand by telephone. For once Tony Newton's nerve had failed.</p>
