  <h2>HOLE-IN-THE-WALL BARRETT</h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p>If this story were not fact it would not be written. It is too incredible
  for fiction. The best proof of its reality is the very fact that it is
  incredible, but if further proof is wanted it may be obtained from the twelve
  good men and true who formed the jury at the trial of Harry McCurtney. If
  they will not do, certainly Judge Lorry is an unimpeachable witness.</p>

  <p>The story has to do with probably the oldest combination known to
  stories&mdash;a hero, a villain, and a beautiful woman. The hero was young,
  handsome, talented; the villain was middle-aged and rather stout, and smoked
  big black cigars; the beautiful woman was very beautiful.</p>

  <p>Whatever the reader may think, this is not a motion-picture scenario.
  However, it sounds so much like one that it might as well start in the movie
  way.</p>

  <p>The camera, therefore, opens on a close-up of the middle-aged villain. As
  the round spot of light widens, everyone can see that the man is a villain.
  The way he chews that long black cigar, for instance, emitting slow;
  luxurious puffs, is sufficient proof.</p>

  <p>No one but a villain really enjoys good tobacco; but to pile Pelion on
  Ossa, there are other proofs&mdash;lots of them. He has a square, bulging
  jaw, a straight-lipped, cruel mouth, a great hawk nose, and keen eyes buried
  under the overhanging shelter of shaggy brows. He is frowning in his
  villainous way and looking down.</p>

  <p>The spot of light widens still further and includes the beautiful woman.
  She is very, very beautiful; a black-haired type with questioning, dark eyes.
  She is dressed in black, too, filmy over the arms, so that the rose tint of
  flesh shines through. She reclines in an easy chair with her head pillowed
  gracefully and canted somewhat to one side, while she studies the villain and
  defies him.</p>

  <p>One notices her slender-fingered hand drooping from the arm of the chair,
  and compares it with the big fist of the villain, wondering how she can have
  the courage to defy him. She seems to know all about him. Well, she ought to.
  She is his wife.</p>

  <p>The camera now opens out to the full and one sees the room. It is very
  big. There is a soft glimmer of diffused light, which is brightest on the
  corner of the grand piano and the slightly gray head of the villain. His big
  feet are planted in the thick texture of a rug. An arched doorway opens upon
  a vista of other rooms fully as sumptuous as this one. Proof positive that
  the man is a villain! He is too rich to be good.</p>

  <p>The woman is talking. She leans forward with a smile that would win the
  heart of an armored angel&mdash;one of Milton's kind; but the man still
  frowns. It is easy to see that he is going to refuse her request&mdash;the
  beast! She concludes with a gesture of infinite grace, infinite appeal. This
  is what she said:</p>

  <p>"So you see, John, it was really a good act on the part of Harry to rid
  the world of that unspeakable uncle of his. Why, there isn't a soul in the
  city with a single kind word for that old miser, William McCurtney! He never
  did a gentle act. He broke the heart of his wife and killed her. He has kept
  poor Harry in penury."</p>

  <p>The villain removed the black cigar from his teeth with a singularly
  unattractive hand. It looked as if it had been used all his life for grabbing
  things&mdash;and then holding them. His eyes burrowed into the face of the
  beautiful woman as if it made not the slightest difference to him whether he
  was speaking to his wife or not.</p>

  <p>"This is the case," he said. "Harry McCurtney killed his uncle, William
  McCurtney. He did it by putting poison in the Scotch whisky which old William
  was drinking to the health of his nephew. A maid saw Harry put something into
  his uncle's glass. She afterward got hold of the vial of poison, out of which
  only a few drops had been poured. There was enough left to kill ten men. When
  old McCurtney died that night, the maid called in the police and had Harry
  arrested. She produced the vial of poison as evidence. The case was easily
  made out. A druggist has sworn that the poison was purchased from him by
  young Harry McCurtney. Tomorrow the jury is certain to bring a verdict of
  guilty against this man. That, in brief, is the case of the man you want me
  to defend."</p>

  <p>"Your brevity," said his wife, "has destroyed everything worthwhile in the
  case. You have left out the fact that William McCurtney was a heartless old
  ruffian&mdash;a miser, hated by everyone and hating everyone. You have left
  out the fact"&mdash;here her voice lowered and grew musically gentle as only
  the voice of a woman of culture can grow&mdash;"you have left out the fact,
  John, that Harry McCurtney is a rare soul, an artist, a man unequipped for
  battling with the world. With the fortune he inherits from his uncle he would
  lead a beautiful, an ideal existence. He would do good to the world. He
  is&mdash;he is&mdash;a chosen spirit, John!"</p>

  <p>"And he murdered his uncle," said John Barrett, "while old William was
  drinking his nephew's health and long life."</p>

  <p>"That is an absurd and brutal way of stating it," said Mrs. John Barrett.
  "You cannot reduce the troubles of a delicate and esthetic soul to such a
  bald statement of fact."</p>

  <p>"I should have to be a poet to do him justice?" "You would."</p>

  <p>"However it is a waste of time to attempt to defend this fellow. I've seen
  the evidence. He'll hang!"</p>

  <p>His wife rose from her chair and stood facing him. All the color went from
  her face; she seemed to have been painted white with a single stroke of an
  invisible brush.</p>

  <p>"He must not hang! John, you can defend him. I've seen you win more
  impossible cases than this! I remember the Hanover trial. John Hanover was
  guilty. All the world knew it; but all the evidence of his guilt came from
  one witness. On the last day, before the case went to the jury, you put the
  witness for the prosecution on the stand. I'll never forget it! You drew him
  out. You seemed hopeless of winning your case; you seemed to be questioning
  him simply as a matter of form to justify the collection of your fee. And the
  witness grew very confident. Finally you asked him the color of the necktie
  which Hanover was wearing when he committed the crime. The witness said
  without hesitation:</p>

  <p>"'A red tie with white stripes.'</p>

  <p>"With that you clapped your hand over your own necktie, sprang to your
  feet, pointed a melodramatic hand at the witness, and thundered in your
  courtroom voice:</p>

  <p>"'What color is the necktie that I'm wearing?'</p>

  <p>"The witness was dumfounded. He couldn't tell. Then you turned to the jury
  and discredited all that witness's testimony. You said you had been wearing
  the same necktie day after day in court, and the witness didn't know what its
  color was. Then how could he be sure of the color of the necktie which
  Hanover wore, when he had only seen Hanover for a few seconds, committing the
  murder? It showed that the man was giving valueless testimony; that he was
  lying out of hand. And the jury acquitted your man. John, you can do some
  miraculous thing like that now for my friend, Harry McCurtney. You'll find
  some way. Why else are you called Hole-in-the-Wall Barrett?"</p>

  <p>While she completed this impassioned appeal, John Barrett regarded her
  with utter unconcern. He might have been listening to the accomplishments of
  some fabulous character rather than to one of his own most spectacular
  exploits.</p>

  <p>"To be brief, Elizabeth," he said, "I won't take the case. I've other work
  planned for tomorrow."</p>

  <p>And he turned to leave the room.</p>

  <p>Who but a villain could have turned his back on such a woman and at such a
  time? She stiffened; her head went back; there was a tremor of coming speech
  in her throat. "She is about to play her last card," a gambler would have
  said, and she played it.</p>

  <p>"John!" she called.</p>

  <p>The villain turned only half toward her at the door. "There is another
  reason why you must defend McCurtney," she said. "I love him!"</p>

  <p>It sufficed to make the villain turn squarely toward her, but he showed
  not the least emotion. His head bowed a little, thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he repeated. "You love him?"</p>

  <p>And with that he shifted his glance up suddenly and met her eyes. She
  shrank back, trembling. One could see that she was expectant of a blow, a
  torrent of abuse. Instead, he smiled slowly at her.</p>

  <p>She made a little gesture. There seemed more appeal than anger in it. "You
  don't care, John? I knew you didn't care!"</p>

  <p>"If you love him," said the villain slowly, "I suppose I don't care."</p>

  <p>"You never have," she answered. "You merely bought me&mdash;with your
  courtroom eloquence, and your money&mdash;just as you would buy a fine piece
  of furniture. You wanted a decorative wife for your home&mdash;someone you
  could be proud to show."</p>

  <p>It was not a quarrel, you see. For it happened in the twentieth century;
  happened yesterday, in fact. Neither of them raised their voices. There fell
  a little silence, and silences always make a woman explain.</p>

  <p>"I've tried to love you," she said. "I've tried to break through that hard
  exterior you wear like armor. I've guessed at depths and tendernesses in you,
  but the only time I've heard poetry in your voice was when you said before
  the minister, 'I will!' Since then I've waited for a touch of that sound to
  come back into your voice, but it never has, and gradually I've learned the
  truth&mdash;you never really cared for me."</p>

  <p>John Barrett was a villain; also a vulgar man.</p>

  <p>"The proof of the pudding is in the eating," he said. "If I haven't seemed
  to love you, why&mdash;I haven't."</p>

  <p>And he grinned; it was not by any means a smile. She shuddered as if those
  hands of his, made for gripping great burdens, had closed on a vital nerve
  that ran to her heart. She turned away, veiling her eyes with her hand.
  Surely it was strange that a man could give up such beauty!</p>

  <p>"And will you defend him?" she asked in a whisper. "If you love him," said
  Barrett, "I shall set him free for you. Good night, Elizabeth!"</p>

  <p>He strode out of the room. She ran after him a few steps and followed him
  with her eyes down the long vista of the rooms; but the massive shoulders
  went on their way with characteristic swagger; the bowed thoughtful head
  never once cast back a glance toward her.</p>

  <p>"It is done!" said the beautiful woman, and sank into a chair.</p>

  <p>Her eyes were half closed, and she smiled&mdash;the smile of the
  twentieth-century woman, which is harder to read than the smile of the
  Sphinx.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p>THE next afternoon she sat in a front seat in the courtroom and bent eyes
  of sad sympathy upon Harry McCurtney. There were others who looked on him in
  the same way. They were not, to be sure, quite like the beautiful woman, but
  then they were fair enough to have filled up a motion-picture background.</p>

  <p>What woman under thirty could look upon him without some such sad emotion?
  He was very young; he was very handsome. The brown eyes were as soft and
  liquid as the eyes of a thoughtful Byron&mdash;or a calf. That tall forehead
  and that long, pale face&mdash;they brought home all the romantic melancholy
  of life to a woman under thirty. Even the twelve good men and true felt some
  ruth as they glanced on him who was about to die; but being hardheaded
  fellows, those twelve, they looked away again and cleared their throats and
  frowned. Metaphorically speaking, they were rolling up their sleeves and
  preparing to grasp the knife from the hands of blind justice.</p>

  <p>The hero knew it. He turned those large, soft eyes on the jurors, and then
  flicked them swiftly away and let them journey from one fair face to another
  along the benches of the courtroom. And at last, as one overcome by the woes
  of life, he bowed his head and veiled his eyes with his long, white,
  tremulous fingers. A beautiful hand! It should have rested upon velvet;
  should have toyed with locks of golden hair, or blue-black
  hair&mdash;Elizabeth's hair was blue-black.</p>

  <p>The crowd had not come to hear the plea of Hole-inthe-Wall Barrett, simply
  because it was not known until the last moment that he was taking over the
  case for the defense; but the moment his burly figure appeared, swaggering
  toward a chair, a hum and then a whisper and then a voice passed through the
  crowd. His honor removed his glasses and frowned. The clerk rapped for
  order.</p>

  <p>From that moment everyone waited; everyone was expectant. The prosecution
  was uneasy; the district attorney drank many glasses of water; the jurors set
  their teeth as if they were resolving their collective minds that they would
  not be budged from their duty even by a John Barrett. They scowled and nudged
  one another with assurances of immovability; they smiled upon the district
  attorney; they frowned upon Harry McCurtney and John Barrett.</p>

  <p>The proceedings passed quickly. The district attorney made a very eloquent
  speech, painting in colors of crimson and black the damnable crime of this
  treacherous boy who could poison his uncle while the murdered man was
  drinking his nephew's long life and happiness. The jury shook its collective
  head and scowled again on John Barrett, as if they dared him to come on and
  fight now. But all the time Hole-in-the-Wall Barrett sat teetering slowly
  back and forth in his armchair, staring blankly from face to face and picking
  his teeth. As has been said before, he was not only a villain, but a very
  vulgar man.</p>

  <p>The prosecutor's case was in. There was only the plea of John Barrett to
  be heard. The judge frowned his defiance on Barrett; the district attorney
  did likewise; the jury deepened its scowls; the fair mourners covered their
  faces and waited.</p>

  <p>Barrett rose in the most matter-of-fact manner, with the most unmoved
  face, and crossed to the table on which stood the damning exhibit, the vial
  of poison. He finished picking his teeth, but continued to chew the
  toothpick. Indeed, he was a very vulgar man.</p>

  <p>"Your honor and gentlemen of the jury," he said, "the prosecution has
  proved conclusively that certain drops from this bottle were poured by the
  defendant into a glass of whisky, which was drunk by William McCurtney, who
  thereafter died."</p>

  <p>It was like the fall of the first sods on the coffin. The defense was
  throwing down its cards. McCurtney raised his head; a greenish-yellow was
  invading the pallor of his poetic face. Something extremely un-poetic was in
  his eyes.</p>

  <p>"The court has been informed by various experts that the contents of this
  bottle are deadly poison. If they are, unquestionably the defendant is guilty
  of murder, most damnable murder."</p>

  <p>It was a strange exordium. The crowd frowned with wonder and waited for
  the appeal which must follow&mdash;sounding periods, moving eloquence. But it
  must be always remembered that our villain was a most vulgar man. He raised
  the little vial.</p>

  <p>"The proof of the pudding," he said, "is in the eating."</p>

  <p>And he drank the liquid in the vial&mdash;he drained it slowly to the last
  drop. Then he turned and extended an arm of command over the jury, which had
  arisen to the last man, staring upon him with pallid faces and open
  mouths.</p>

  </div>

  <p>"Now set that man free!" he thundered, and strode from the courtroom.</p>

  <p>The man was set free. The jury was out one and one-half minutes before it
  reached its verdict. And the first one to get to the acquitted man, who sat
  as if stunned, with wandering eyes, was Elizabeth Barrett. Love will find a
  way, even through a courtroom jam.</p>

  <p>A note was brought to McCurtney; they read it together.</p>

  <p>"Bring Elizabeth to my house, McCurtney," ran the note. "I have something
  to say to you both."</p>

  <p>As they sat in her car, she said:</p>

  <p>"He knows, Harry!"</p>

  <p>"Knows what?" asked Harry.</p>

  <p>"About us," said Elizabeth tenderly.</p>

  <p>"About which?" said the hero vaguely.</p>

  <p>"About our love, dear," explained the beautiful woman.</p>

  <p>"My God!" said the hero. "Stop the car! Turn it about!"</p>

  <p>"Harry!" cried the beautiful woman. "You aren't afraid?"</p>

  <p>"Afraid?" stammered the hero. "No, of course not!" "Poor dear! Of course
  that hideous trial has destroyed your nerves; but think of the long years of
  beautiful peace which we will spend together!"</p>

  <p>"John Barrett!" muttered the hero. "He knows?" "I told him."</p>

  <p>"Elizabeth, were you mad, to tell that brute of a man?"</p>

  <p>"He didn't care. In fact, that's how I induced him to defend you."</p>

  <p>The hero wiped his brow.</p>

  <p>"He won't oppose," said the beautiful woman, and she looked out the window
  with something of a sigh. "He won't hinder us in anything. I suppose&mdash;I
  suppose the divorce will be easily granted me. And then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes!" murmured the hero. "But let's talk about that later. The
  important thing now is John Barrett."</p>

  <p>"We'll talk to him in a moment. It won't take long. I suppose he wants to
  make the necessary arrangements for the&mdash;the divorce."</p>

  <p>She leaned back against the cushion and smiled that twentieth-century
  smile.</p>

  <p>"By Heaven!" said the hero, "I don't really know whether you're glad or
  sorry, Elizabeth."</p>

  <p>"Neither do I," she answered, and then, opening her eyes suddenly to the
  matter of fact: "Neither do I know whether I'm gladder to have my freedom, or
  sorrier to wade through the disgrace of the divorce court."</p>

  <p>"Hm!" said the hero.</p>

  <p>The car stopped in front of the columned entrance to the Barrett home.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you coming, Harry?" she asked with some impatience.</p>

  <p>"Give me time, dear," said the hero. "My wits are still back there in the
  courtroom waiting for John Barrett to begin his appeal."</p>

  <p>"And mine," said the beautiful woman, "are in the bright future!"</p>

  <p>And again she smiled the twentieth-century smile.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p>THEY entered, and a servant told them that Mr. Barrett expected them in
  his private library. They climbed to the third story.</p>

  <p>"This climb," smiled Elizabeth, when they arrived, a little breathless, at
  the door, "is the only thing, I'm sure, which keeps John from becoming
  stout."</p>

  <p>"Hm!" said the hero.</p>

  <p>They entered, and the door clicked behind them. It was a circular room,
  with a vaulted ceiling. The walls were lined with unbroken rows of books.
  There was not even a window; the air came through two ventilators. John
  Barrett stood in front of an open fireplace with his back to them, so that
  they could not tell, at first, exactly what he was doing there.</p>

  <p>"We are here, John," said Elizabeth in a rather thin voice.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" boomed Hole-in-the-Wall Barrett. "Are you here?"</p>

  <p>And as he turned half toward them they discerned his employment&mdash;he
  was heating the end of a stout poker in a bed of white-hot coals. "Good God!"
  whispered the hero.</p>

  <p>He seized the knob of the door; but it did not budge. He could not even
  elicit a rattle from it when he shook it frantically.</p>

  <p>"The door locks with a spring," explained John Barrett, turning squarely
  toward them, and still twirling the poker in the coals.</p>

  <p>"Help!" yelled the hero.</p>

  <p>"Harry!" said the beautiful woman in some disdain.</p>

  <p>"It is often necessary for me to hold the most secret conferences here,"
  said the villain, "and therefore I have had these walls built so thick that
  no sounds can enter or leave. The room is impervious to noise. It is
  necessary, because some really strange things have happened here."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" said the hero, his voice changed beyond
  recognition.</p>

  <p>"It is a suggestion," said the impassive villain, "for those who desire
  privacy. A room like this, for instance, would be ideal for writing your
  poetry, McCurtney."</p>

  <p>"John!" said the beautiful woman sharply. "What are you driving at?"</p>

  <p>In that vulgar atmosphere it was no wonder if she had learned to use
  slang. The hero, however, did not seem to notice it. His curiosity, for the
  moment, overwhelmed any other emotions.</p>

  <p>"How in the name of Heaven," he said, "did you survive that poison?"</p>

  <p>"Was it poison?" queried the villain. "Well, albumen coagulates and
  collects around certain poisons. I had swallowed several raw eggs just before
  I entered the courtroom. It is not a new trick. The moment I left I was taken
  by two doctors to a private room, and my stomach was pumped out."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" said the hero scornfully. "I thought it was some ingenious thing you
  did!"</p>

  <p>"Oh!" said the villain. "Did you?"</p>

  <p>"John, why have you sent for us?" said the beautiful woman.</p>

  <p>Barrett buried the poker in the coals so deep that it would not topple
  out, produced one of his villainous long cigars and lighted it. He then
  picked up a riding whip which had fallen to the floor, and hung it again
  above the fireplace.</p>

  <p>"It is about your leaving," said the villain, and took the handle of the
  poker.</p>

  <p>"Have you made up your mind to oppose me?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"If you love this man," he said in his calm voice, "I sha'n't raise a hand
  to stop you or to hinder your happiness. I would even drink poison again to
  help you along."</p>

  <p>"You?" said the beautiful woman.</p>

  <p>"Because I love you," said the villain.</p>

  <p>"You?" said the beautiful woman.</p>

  <p>"Rot!" said the hero.</p>

  <p>"But," went on the villain, "if you really care for this fellow
  here&mdash;this sneaking cur who makes my hand itch&mdash;if you really care
  for him, I'm sure that I can get along without you."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean&mdash;?" cried the hero.</p>

  <p>"I mean, Elizabeth," said the villain, "that I've probably made many
  mistakes in my treatment of you. I've never been a man of many
  words&mdash;outside the courtroom. I've usually depended on actions instead.
  After I married you, I didn't think you required more proofs of my love. If
  you do, I'll try to give them to you&mdash;not in words, because this is not
  a courtroom; but I want you to know that I've crossed the line from my old
  life and stepped into a new. This is the proof."</p>

  <p>He drew out the poker from the coals. It sparkled and glittered and
  radiated snapping sparks in showers. The iron indeed, seemed instinct with a
  terrible life, a volition of its own.</p>

  <p>"God!" whispered the hero, and cowered against the locked door.</p>

  <p>The beautiful woman said nothing at all.</p>

  <p>Coming to a point halfway across the room, the villain took the glowing
  iron and with it seared a smoking furrow, crooked and deep, across the
  polished wood from one side of the room to the other. The mark still fumed
  when he stepped back and cast the poker clanging on the hearth. It was an
  ugly mark, and a melodramatic thing to do, but the villain was a vulgar
  man.</p>

  <p>"If you doubt that I love you hereafter," said the villain, "don't wait
  for me to tell you, but come up here and look at this mark on the floor,
  Elizabeth. You've done to me what I've done here."</p>

  <p>"John!" whispered his wife.</p>

  <p>He turned his cigar and blew a cloud of smoke toward the ceiling. Truly, a
  very vulgar man!</p>

  <p>"Elizabeth!" groaned the hero. "Are you going to leave me?"</p>

  <p>"John!" whispered the beautiful woman, and she ran across the smoking
  furrow on the floor, stretching out her arms to her husband. He removed his
  cigar.</p>

  <p>"You will be able to open that other door," he said. She opened the door
  and went out.</p>

  <p>"And now?" asked the hero hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"And now," said the villain, "I have always been a man of few words."</p>

  <p>So saying, he took down the riding whip from above the fireplace. The room
  was impervious to noise. It was necessary, because some strange things
  happened there.</p>
