<h2><a name="c1" id="c1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p>This day my good friend William Elphinstone was laid to rest, in
the Lutheran churchyard on the east bank of the river, not five
cable-lengths from the hospital. Mr. Sparling, Surgeon-General of
Batavia, helped me into the boat; and two of his Malay servants
were waiting on the bank, with a litter to convey me to the
grave.</p>

<p>Two others of our little company, worn out by the hardships of
the voyage, and easy victims to the climate of Java, have preceded
Elphinstone to the churchyard. They were men of humble birth, but
Elphinstone should be well content to lie beside them, for they
were Englishmen worthy of the name. Lenkletter was one of the
<i>Bounty's</i> quartermasters, and Hall a cook. Mr. Sparling had
dosed them with bark and wine, doing everything in his power to
save their lives; but they had been through too much. Mr. Fryer,
the master, Cole, the boatswain, and two midshipmen, Hayward and
Tinkler, were rowed four miles up the river to attend the
funeral.</p>

<p>After we had paid our last respects to the master's mate, I was
grieved to learn that my friends had been informed by the Sabandar
that they were to sail for Europe on the morrow, with the last of
the <i>Bounty's</i> people, aboard the <i>Hollandia</i>, a ship of
the Dutch East India Company's fleet. Grieved for myself, I must
add, but glad for the sake of the others, whose longing for
England, after an absence of nearly two years, was as great as my
own. The deep ulcer on my leg, aggravated by the tropical climate,
renders it imprudent to take passage at this time; in Mr.
Sparling's opinion I shall be unable to travel for several months.
I am grateful for the friendship of my Dutch colleague and sensible
of the deep obligations he has placed me under, yet I am taking up
my pen to ward off the sense of loneliness already descending upon
me in this far-off place.</p>

<p>The seaman's hospital is a model of its kind: large, commodious,
airy, and judiciously divided into wards, each one a separate
dwelling in which the sick are accommodated according to their
complaints. I am lodged with the Surgeon-General, in his house at
the extremity of one wing; he has had a cot placed for me, on a
portion of his piazza shaded by flowering shrubs and vines, where I
may pass the hours of the day propped up on pillows--to read or
write, if I choose, or to sit in idleness with my bandaged leg
extended upon a chair, gazing out on the rich and varied landscape,
steaming in the heat of the sun. But now that my shipmates will no
longer be able to visit me, the hours will drag sadly. My host is
the kindest of men, and the only person here with whom I can
converse, but the performance of his duties leaves little time for
idle talk. His lady, a young and handsome niece of M. Vander Graaf,
the Governor of Cape Town, has been more than kind to me. She is
scarcely twenty, and the Malay costumes she wears become her
mightily: silk brocade and jewels, and her thick flaxen hair
dressed high on her head and pinned with a comb of inlaid tortoise
shell. Escorted by her Malay girls, she often comes of an afternoon
to sit with me. Her blue eyes express interest and compassion as
she glances at me and turns to speak with her servants, in the
Malay tongue. I have been so long without the pleasure of female
company that it is a satisfaction merely to look at Mme. Sparling;
were I able to converse with her, the hours would be short
indeed.</p>

<p>When we had buried Mr. Elphinstone, and I had asked the
Surgeon-General for writing materials, it was his wife who brought
me what I required. She took leave of me soon after; and since
night is still distant, I am beginning to set my memories in order
for the task with which I hope to while the hours away until I am
again able to walk.</p>

<p>Of the mutiny on board His Majesty's armed transport
<i>Bounty</i>, I shall have little to say. Captain Bligh has
already written an account of how the ship was seized; and Mr.
Timotheus Wanjon, secretary to the governor at Coupang, has
translated it into the Dutch language so that the authorities in
these parts may be on the lookout for the <i>Bounty</i> in the
unlikely event that she should be steered this way. He questioned
each of us fully as to what we had seen and heard on the morning of
the mutiny; I should be guilty of presumption were I to set down an
independent narrative based upon my own knowledge of what occurred.
But of our subsequent adventures in the ship's launch I feel free
to write, the more so since Mr. Nelson, the botanist, who informed
me at Coupang that he meditated the same task, died in Timor, the
first victim of the privations we had undergone.</p>

<p>Never, perhaps, in the history of the sea has a captain
performed a feat more remarkable than Mr. Bligh's, in navigating a
small, open, and unarmed boat--but twenty-three feet long, and so
heavily laden that she was in constant danger of foundering--from
the Friendly Islands to Timor, a distance of three thousand, six
hundred miles, through groups of islands inhabited by ferocious
savages, and across a vast uncharted ocean. Eighteen of us were
huddled on the thwarts as we ran for forty-one days before strong
easterly gales, bailing almost continually to keep afloat, and
exposed to torrential rains by day and by night. Yet, save for John
Norton,--murdered by the savages at Tofoa,--we reached Timor
without the loss of a man. For the preservation of our lives we
have Captain Bligh to thank, and him alone. We reached the Dutch
East Indies, not by a miracle, but owing to the leadership of an
officer of indomitable will, skilled in seamanship, stern to
preserve discipline, cool and cheerful in the face of danger. His
name will be revered by those who accompanied him for as long as
they may live.</p>

<p>On the morning of April 28, 1789, the <i>Bounty</i> was running
before a light easterly breeze, within view of the island of Tofoa,
in the Friendly Archipelago. I was awakened a little after daybreak
by Charles Churchill, the master-at-arms, and John Mills, the
gunner's mate, who informed me that the ship had been seized by
Fletcher Christian, the acting lieutenant, and the greater part of
the ship's company, and that I was to go on deck at once. These men
were of Christian's party. Churchill was armed with a brace of
pistols, and Mills with a musket. I dressed in great haste and was
then marched to the upper deck. It will be understood with what
amazement and incredulity I looked about me. To be aroused from a
quiet sleep to find the ship filled with armed men, and Captain
Bligh a prisoner in their midst, so shocked and stupefied me that,
at first, I could scarcely accept the evidence of my eyes.</p>

<p>There was nothing to be done. The mutineers were in complete
possession of the ship, and those who they knew would remain loyal
to their commander were so carefully guarded as to preclude all
possibility of resistance. I was ordered to stand by the mainmast
with William Elphinstone, master's mate, and John Norton, one of
the quartermasters. Two of the seamen, armed with muskets, the
bayonets fixed, were stationed over us; and I well remember one of
them, John Williams, saying to me: "Stand ye there, Mr. Ledward. We
mean ye no harm, but, by God, we'll run ye through the guts if ye
make a move toward Captain Bligh!"</p>

<p>Elphinstone, Norton, and I tried to recall these men to their
senses; but their minds were so inflamed by hatred toward Captain
Bligh that nothing we could say made the least impression upon
them. He showed great resolution; and, although they threatened him
repeatedly, he outfaced the ruffians and dared them to do their
worst.</p>

<p>I had been standing by the mainmast only a short time when
Christian, who had been chief of those guarding Mr. Bligh, gave
this business into the charge of Churchill and four or five others,
that he might hasten the work of sending the loyal men out of the
ship. It was only then that we learned what his plans were, and we
had no time to reflect upon the awful consequences to us of his
cruelty and folly. The ship was in an uproar, and it was a near
thing that Bligh was not murdered where he stood. It had been the
plan of the mutineers to set us adrift in the small cutter; but her
bottom was so rotten that they were at last persuaded to let us
have the launch, and men were now set to work clearing her that she
might be swung over the side. Whilst this was being done, I caught
Christian's eye, and he came forward to where I stood.</p>

<p>"Mr. Ledward, you may stay with the ship if you choose," he
said. "I shall follow Captain Bligh," I replied.</p>

<p>"Then into the launch with you at once," he said.</p>

<p>"Surely, Mr. Christian," I said, "you will not send us off
without medical supplies, and I must have some cloathes for
myself."</p>

<p>He called to Matthew Quintal, one of the seamen: "Quintal, take
Mr. Ledward to his cabin, and let him have what cloathing he needs.
He is to take the small medicine chest, but see to it that he takes
nothing from the large one."</p>

<p>He then left me abruptly, and that was my last word with this
misguided man who had doomed nineteen others to hardships and
sufferings beyond the power of the imagination to describe.</p>

<p>The small medicine chest was provided with a handle, and could
easily be carried by one man. Fortunately, I had always kept it
fully equipped for expeditions that might be made away from the
ship; it had its own supply of surgical instruments, sponges,
tourniquets, dressings, and the like, and a hasty examination
assured me that, in the way of medicines, it contained most of
those specifics likely to be needed by men in our position. Quintal
watched me narrowly while I was making this examination. I put into
the chest my razors, some handkerchiefs, my only remaining packet
of snuff, and half a dozen wineglasses, which later proved of great
use to us. Having gathered together some additional articles of
cloathing, I was again conducted to the upper deck. The launch was
already in the water; Captain Bligh, John Fryer,--the master,--the
boatswain, William Cole, and many others had been sent into her.
Churchill halted me at the gangway to make an examination of the
medicine chest. He then ordered me into the boat, and the chest and
my bundle of cloathing were handed down to me.</p>

<p>I was among the last to go into the launch; indeed, there were
but two who followed me--Mr. Samuel, the captain's clerk, and
Robert Tinkler, a midshipman. The launch was now so low in the
water that Mr. Fryer, as well as Captain Bligh himself, begged that
no more men should be sent into her; yet there were, I believe, two
midshipmen and three or four seamen who would have come with us had
there been room. Fortunately for us and for them, they were not
permitted to do so, for we had no more than seven or eight inches
of freeboard amidships. There were, in fact, nineteen of us in the
launch, which was but twenty-three feet long, with a beam of six
feet, nine inches. In depth she was, I think, two feet and nine
inches. Each man had brought with him his bundle of cloathing; and
with these, and the supplies of food allowed us by the mutineers,
we were dangerously overladen.</p>

<p>But there was no time, as yet, to think of the seriousness of
our situation. The launch was veered astern, and for another
quarter of an hour or thereabouts we were kept in tow. The
mutineers lined the <i>Bounty's</i> rail, aft, hooting and jeering
at us; but it was to Mr. Bligh that most of their remarks were
addressed. As I looked up at them, I found myself wondering how a
mutiny into which well over half the ship's company had been drawn
could have been planned without so much as a hint of danger having
come to the knowledge of the rest of us. I personally had observed
no sign of disaffection in the ship's company. To be sure, I had
witnessed, upon more than one occasion, instances of the rigour of
Captain Bligh's disciplinary measures. He is a man of violent
temper, stern and unbending in the performance of what he considers
to be his duty; but the same may be said of the greater part of the
ships' captains in His Majesty's service. Knowing the necessity for
strict discipline at sea, and the unruly nature of seamen as a
class, I by no means considered that Captain Bligh's punishments
exceeded in severity what the rules and necessities of the service
demanded; nor had I believed that the men themselves thought so.
But they now showed a passion of hatred toward him that astonished
me, and reviled him in abominable language.</p>

<p>I heard one of them shout, "Swim home, you old bastard!"</p>

<p>"Aye, swim or drown!" yelled another, "God damn you, we're well
rid of you!"</p>

<p>And another: "You'll flog and starve us no more, you..."</p>

<p>Then followed a string of epithets it may be as well to omit.
However, I must do their company the justice to say that most of
the jeering and vile talk came from four or five of the mutinous
crew. I observed that others looked down at us in silence, and with
a kind of awe--as though they had just realized the enormity of the
crime they were committing.</p>

<p>They had given us nothing with which to defend ourselves amongst
the savages, and urgent requests were made for some muskets. These
were met with further abuse; but at length four cutlasses were
thrown down to us, and for all our pleading we were given nothing
else. This so enraged Captain Bligh that he stood in his place and
addressed the ruffians as they deserved. Two or three of the seamen
leveled their pieces at him; and it was only the superior force of
his will, I believe, which prevented them from shooting. We heard
one of them cry out: "Bear off, and give 'em a whiff of grape!" At
this moment the painter of the launch was cast off, and the ship
drew slowly away from us. I cannot believe that even the most
hardened of the mutineers was so lost to humanity as to have turned
one of the guns upon a boatload of defenseless men, but others of
our number thought differently. The oars were at once gotten out,
and we pulled directly astern; but the ship was kept on her course,
and soon it was clear to all that we had nothing more to fear from
those aboard of her.</p>

<p>At this time the <i>Bounty</i> was under courses and topsails;
the breeze was of the lightest, and the vessel had little more than
steerageway. As she drew off, we saw several of the men run aloft
to loose the topgallant sails. The shouting grew fainter, and soon
was lost to hearing. In an hour's time the vessel was a good three
miles to leeward; in another hour she was hull down on the
horizon.</p>

<p>I well remember the silence that seemed to flow in upon our
little company directly we had been cast adrift--the wide silence
of mid-ocean, accentuated by the faint creaking of the oars against
the tholepins. We rowed six oars in the launch, but were so deeply
laden that we made slow progress toward the island of Tofoa, to the
northeast of us and distant about ten leagues. Fryer sat at the
tiller. Captain Bligh, Mr. Nelson, Elphinstone,--the master's
mate,--and Peckover, the gunner, were all seated in the stern
sheets. The rest of us were crowded on the thwarts in much the same
positions as those we had taken upon coming into the launch. Bligh
was half turned in his seat, gazing sombrely after the distant
vessel; nor, during the next hour, I think, did he once remove his
eyes from her. He appeared to have forgotten the rest of us, nor
did any of us speak to remind him of our presence. Our thoughts
were as gloomy as his own, and we felt as little inclined to
express them.</p>

<p>My sympathy went out to Mr. Bligh in this hour of bitter
disappointment; I could easily imagine how appalling the ruin of
his plans must have appeared to him at a time when he had every
expectation of completing them to the last detail. We had been
homeward bound, the mission of our long voyage--that of collecting
breadfruit plants in Otaheite, to be carried to the West
Indies--successfully accomplished. This task, entrusted to his care
by His Majesty's Government through the interest of his friend and
patron, Sir Joseph Banks, had deeply gratified him, and well indeed
had he justified that trust. Now, in a moment, his sanguine hopes
were brought to nothing. His ship was gone; his splendid charts of
coasts and islands were gone as well; and he had nothing to show
for all the long months of careful and painstaking labour. He found
himself cast adrift with eighteen of his company in his own ship's
launch, with no more than a compass, a sextant, and his journal, in
the midst of the greatest of oceans and thousands of miles from any
place where he could look for help. Small wonder if, at that time,
he felt the taste of dust and ashes in his mouth.</p>

<p>For an hour we moved slowly on toward Tofoa, the most
northwesterly of the islands composing the Friendly Archipelago.
This group had been so christened by Captain Cook; but our
experiences among its inhabitants, only a few days before the
mutiny, led us to believe that Cook must have called them
"friendly" in a spirit of irony. They are a virile race, but we had
found them savage and treacherous in the extreme, as different as
could be imagined from the Indians of Otaheite. Only the possession
of firearms had saved us from being attacked and overcome whilst we
were engaged in wooding and watering on the island of Annamooka.
Tofoa we had not visited, and as I gazed at the faint blue outline
on the horizon I tried, with little success, to convince myself
that our experiences there might be more fortunate.</p>

<p>Many an anxious glance was turned in Captain Bligh's direction,
but for an hour at least he remained in the same position, gazing
after the distant ship. When at length he turned away, it was never
to look toward her again. He now took charge of his new command
with an assurance, a quiet cheerfulness, that heartened us all. He
first set us to work to bring some order into the boat. We were, as
I have said, desperately crowded; but when we had stored away our
supplies we had elbowroom at least. Our first care was, of course,
to take stock of our provisions. We found that we had sixteen
pieces of pork, each weighing about two pounds; three bags of bread
of fifty pounds each; six quarts of rum, six bottles of wine, and
twenty-eight gallons of water in three ten-gallon kegs. We also had
four empty barricos, each capable of holding eight gallons. The
carpenter, Purcell, had succeeded in fetching away one of his tool
chests, although the mutineers had removed many of the tools before
allowing it to be handed down. Our remaining supplies, outside of
personal belongings, consisted of my medicine chest, the launch's
two lugsails, some spare canvas, two or three coils of rope, and a
copper pot, together with some odds and ends of boat's gear which
the boatswain had had the forethought to bring with him.</p>

<p>To show how deeply laden we were, it is enough to say that my
hand, as it rested on the gunwale, was repeatedly wet with drops of
water from the small waves that licked along the sides of the boat.
Fortunately, the sea was calm and the sky held a promise of good
weather, at least for a sufficient time to enable us to reach
Tofoa.</p>

<p>Reliefs at the oars were changed every hour, each of us taking
his turn. Gradually the blue outline of the island became more
distinct, and by the middle of the afternoon we had covered well
over half the distance to it. About this time the faint breeze
freshened and came round to the southeast, which enabled us to get
up one of our lugsails. Captain Bligh now took the tiller and we
altered our course to fetch the northern side of the island. Not
eighteen hours before I had had, by moonlight, what I thought was
my last view of Tofoa, and Mr. Nelson and I were computing the time
that would be needed, if all went well, to reach the islands of the
West Indies where we were to discharge our cargo of young
breadfruit trees. Little we dreamed of the change that was to take
place in our fortunes before another sun had set. I now cast about
in my mind, trying to anticipate what Captain Bligh's plan for us
might be. Our only hope of succour would lie in the colonies in the
Dutch East Indies, but they were so far distant that the prospect
of reaching one of them seemed fantastic. I thought of Otaheite,
where we could be certain of kindly treatment on the part of the
Indians, but that island was all of twelve hundred miles distant
and directly to windward. In view of these circumstances, Mr. Bligh
would never attempt a return there.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we proceeded on our way under a sky whose serenity
seemed to mock at the desperate plight of the men in the tiny boat
crawling beneath it. The sun dipped into the sea behind us, and in
the light that streamed up from beyond the horizon the island stood
out in clear relief. We estimated the peak of its central mountain
to be about two thousand feet high. It was a volcano, and a thin
cloud of vapour hung above it, taking on a saffron colour in the
afterglow. We were still too far distant at sunset to have seen the
smoke of any fires of its inhabitants. Mr. Bligh was under the
impression that the place was uninhabited. All eyes turned toward
the distant heights as darkness came on, but the only light to be
seen was the dull red glow from the volcano reflected upon the
cloud above it. When we were within a mile of the coast, the breeze
died away and the oars were again gotten out. We approached the
rocky shore until the thunder of the surf was loud in our ears; but
in the darkness we could see no place where a landing might be
made. Cliffs, varying in height from fifty to several hundred feet,
appeared to fall directly to the sea; but when we had coasted a
distance of several miles we discovered a less forbidding spot,
where we might lie in comparative safety through the night.</p>

<p>There was but little surf here, and the sound of it only served
to make deeper and more impressive the stillness of the night. Our
voices sounded strangely distinct in this silence. For all the fact
that we had not eaten since the previous evening, none of us had
thought of food; and when Bligh suggested that we keep our fast
until morning, there was no complaint from any of the company. He
did, however, serve a ration of grog to each of us, and it was at
this time that I had reason to be glad of putting the wineglasses
into my medicine chest, for we discovered that we had but one other
drinking vessel, a horn cup belonging to the captain. The serving
of the grog put all of us in a much more cheerful frame of
mind--not, certainly, because of the spirits it contained, but
rather because it was a customary procedure and served to make us
forget, for the moment at least, our forlorn situation. Two men
were set at the oars to keep the boat off the rocks, and Captain
Bligh commended the rest of us to take what rest our cramped
positions might afford. The light murmur of talk now died away; but
the silence that followed was that of tired but watchful men drawn
together in spirit by the coming of night and the sense of common
dangers.</p>

<h2><a name="c2" id="c2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p>Throughout the night the launch was kept close under the land. I
had as my near companions Elphinstone,--the master's mate,--and
Robert Tinkler, youngest of the <i>Bounty's</i> midshipmen, a lad
of fifteen. The forebodings of the older part of our company were
not shared by Tinkler, whose natural high spirits had thus far been
kept in check by his wholesome awe of Captain Bligh. He had no true
conception of our situation at this time, and it speaks well for
him that when, soon enough, he came to an understanding of the
dangers surrounding us, his courage did not fail him.</p>

<p>He had slept during the latter part of the night, curled up in
the bottom of the boat with my feet and his bundle of cloathing for
his pillow. Elphinstone and I had dozed in turn, leaning one
against the other, but our cramped position had made anything more
than a doze impossible. We were all awake before the dawn, and as
soon as there was sufficient light we proceeded in a northeasterly
direction along the coast. It was a forbidding-looking place,
viewed from the vantage point of a small and deeply laden ship's
boat. The shore was steep-to, and we found no place where a landing
might have been made without serious risk of wrecking the launch.
Presently we were out of the lee, and found the breeze so strong
and the sea so rough that we turned back to examine that part of
the coast which lay beyond the spot where we had spent the night.
About nine o'clock we came to a cove, and, as there appeared to be
no more suitable shelter beyond, we ran in and dropped a grapnel
about twenty yards from the beach.</p>

<p>We were on the lee side here, but this circumstance alone was in
our favour. The beach was rocky, and the foreshore about the cove
had a barren appearance that promised nothing to relieve our wants.
It was shut in on all sides by high, rocky cliffs, and there
appeared to be no means of entrance or exit save by the sea.
Captain Bligh stood up in his seat, examining the place carefully
whilst the rest of us awaited his decision. He turned to Mr. Nelson
with a wry smile.</p>

<p>"By God, sir," he said, "if you can find us so much as an edible
berry here, you shall have my ration of grog at supper."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid the venture is safe enough," Mr. Nelson replied.
"Nevertheless, I shall be glad to try."</p>

<p>"That we shall do," said Bligh; then, turning to the master,
"Mr. Fryer, you and six men shall stay with the launch." He then
told off those who were to remain on board, whereupon they
slackened away until we were in shallow water and the rest of us
waded ashore.</p>

<p>The beach was composed of heaps of stones worn round and smooth
by the action of the sea, and, although the surf was light, the
footing was difficult until we were out of the water. Robert Lamb,
the butcher, turned his ankle before he had taken half a dozen
steps, and thus provided me with my first task as surgeon of the
<i>Bounty's</i> launch. The man had received a bad sprain that made
it impossible for him to walk. He was supported to higher ground,
where Captain Bligh--quite rightly, I think--gave him a severe
rating. We were in no position to have helpless men to care for,
and Lamb's accident was the result of a foolish attempt to run
across a beach of loose stones.</p>

<p>The land about the cove was gravelly soil covered with coarse
grass, small thickets of bush, and scattered trees. The level
ground extended inland for a short distance, to the base of all but
vertical walls covered with vines and fern. Near the beach we found
the remains of an old fire, but we were soon convinced that the
cove was used by the Indians only as a place of occasional
resort.</p>

<p>Mr. Bligh delegated his clerk Samuel, Norton, Purcell,
Lenkletter, and Lebogue as a party to attempt to scale the cliffs.
Purcell carried one of the cutlasses, the others provided
themselves with stout sticks. Thus armed, they set out; and were
soon lost to view amongst the trees. They carried with them the
copper kettle and an Indian calabash we had found hanging from a
tree near the beach. The rest of us separated, some to search for
shellfish among the rocks, others to explore the foreshore. Nelson
and I bore off to the left side of the cove, where we discovered a
narrow valley; but we soon found our passage blocked by a smooth
wall of rock, thirty or forty feet high. Not a drop of water could
we find, and the arid aspect of the valley as a whole showed only
too plainly that the rainfall, on this side of the island at least,
must be scant indeed.</p>

<p>Having explored with care that part of the cove which Bligh had
asked us to examine, we sat down to rest for a moment. Nelson shook
his head with a faint smile.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bligh was safe enough in offering me his tot of grog," he
said. "We shall find nothing here, Ledward--neither food nor
water."</p>

<p>"How do you feel about our prospects?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I have not allowed myself to think of them thus far," he
replied. "We can, undoubtedly, find water on the windward side, and
perhaps food enough to maintain us for a considerable period.
Beyond that..." He broke off, leaving the sentence unfinished.
Presently he added: "Our situation is not quite hopeless. That is
as much as we can say."</p>

<p>"But it is precisely the kind of situation Bligh was born to
meet," I said.</p>

<p>"It is; I grant that; but what can he do, Ledward? Where in
God's name can we go? We know only too well what treacherous
savages these so-called 'Friendly Islanders' are: our experiences
at Annamooka taught us that. I speak frankly. The others I shall
try to encourage as much as possible, but there need be no
play-acting between us two."</p>

<p>Nelson talked in a quiet, even voice which made his words all
the more impressive. He was not a man to look on the dark side of
things; but we had long been friends, and, as he had said, there
was no need of anything but frankness between us as we canvassed
the possibilities ahead.</p>

<p>"What I think Bligh will do," he went on, "is to take us back to
Annamooka--either there or Tongataboo."</p>

<p>"There seems to be nothing else he can do," I replied, "unless
we can establish ourselves here."</p>

<p>"No. And mark my words--sooner or later we shall have such a
taste of Friendly Island hospitality as we may not live either to
remember or regret...Ledward, Ledward!" he said, with a rueful
smile. "Think of our happy situation a little more than twenty-four
hours back, when we were talking of home there by the larboard
bulwarks! And think of my beautiful breadfruit garden, all in such
a flourishing state! What do you suppose those villains will do
with my young trees?"</p>

<p>"I've no doubt they have flung the lot overboard before this," I
replied.</p>

<p>"I fear you are right. They jettisoned us; it is not likely that
their treatment of the plants will be any more tender. And I loved
them as though they were my own children!"</p>

<p>We returned to the beach, where we found that the others had
been no more successful than ourselves; but the exploring party had
gotten out of the cove, although how they had managed it no one
knew. Captain Bligh had found a cavern in the rocky wall, about one
hundred and fifty paces from the beach; and the hard, foot-trampled
ground within showed that it had been often used in the past. The
cavern was perfectly dry; not so much as a drop of water trickled
from the rocks overhead. One find we made there was not of a
reassuring nature. On a shelf of rock there were ranged six human
skulls which, an examination convinced me, had been those of living
men not more than a year or two earlier. In one of these, the
squamosal section of the temporal bone had been crushed, and
another showed a jagged hole through the parietal bone. I was
interested to observe the splendid teeth in each of these skulls;
there was not one in an imperfect condition. These relics, gleaming
faintly white in the dim light of the cave, were eloquent in their
silence; and I have no doubt that they might have been more
eloquent still, could they have conveyed to us information as to
how they came to be there.</p>

<p>Shortly after midday the exploring party returned, utterly
weary, their cloathing torn and their arms and legs covered with
scratches and bruises. In the kettle they had about six quarts of
water, and three more in the calabash. This they had found in holes
amongst the rocks; but they had discovered neither stream nor
spring, nor any sign of people. They had gone a distance of about
two miles over rough ground where it was plain, they said, that no
one had lived or could live. It was the opinion of all that the
island was uninhabited. We then returned to the launch, for there
appeared to be no chance of bettering ourselves here.</p>

<p>Again on the boat, we broke our fast for the first time since
leaving the <i>Bounty</i>. Each man had a morsel of bread, a tasty
bit of pork, and a glass of water. It was a short repast, and as
soon as the last man had been served, we got in the grapnel and
rowed out of the cove.</p>

<p>"We must try to get around to the windward side," said Bligh. "I
fancy we shall find water there. Do you agree, Mr. Nelson?"</p>

<p>"It seems likely," Nelson replied. "As we were approaching
yesterday, I observed that the vegetation appeared much greener to
windward."</p>

<p>The wind was at E.S.E., and as we drew out of the shelter of the
land it blew strong, with a rough, breaking sea. Close-hauled on
the starboard tack, the launch heeled to the gusts, while water
poured in over the lee gunwale and the people worked hard with the
bails. Bluff-bowed, and deeply laden as she was, our boat buried
her nose in each breaking wave, sending up great sheets of spray.
Even Mr. Bligh began to look anxious.</p>

<p>"Stand by to come about!" he shouted, and then: "Hard alee!"</p>

<p>The launch headed up into the seas, while the halyards were
slacked away and the gaffs passed around to the starboard sides of
the masts. The sails slatted furiously as we bore off on the other
tack.</p>

<p>Then, perceiving the danger in the nick of time, Bligh roared:
"Over the side with you--those who can swim!"</p>

<p>It was no pleasant prospect, leaping into a sea so rough; but
about half of our number sprang into the water to fend for
themselves. The launch was so heavy that she answered her helm but
sluggishly, and, though the foresail was backed, she was slow in
bearing off. Caught directly in the trough of the sea, I am
convinced that she would have foundered had we not obeyed Bligh
instantly.</p>

<p>By the grace of God and the captain's skill, she bore off
without filling. The swimmers scrambled in over the gunwales; the
sails were trimmed once more, and we ran back to the shelter of the
land.</p>

<p>We proceeded for several miles beyond the cove, and were
presently rejoiced to see a clump of coconut palms standing out
against the sky on the cliffs above us; but they were at such a
height that we despaired of reaching them; furthermore, there was a
high surf to make landing difficult. But young Tinkler and Thomas
Hall were eager to make the attempt, and Bligh consented that they
should try. We rowed as close to the rocks as we dared, and the
two, having removed their cloathes, sprang into the sea, carrying
with them each a rope that we might haul them back in case they
came to grief. We might have spared ourselves the anxiety. They
were as much at home in the water as the Indians themselves. We saw
them disappear in a smother of foam, and when next seen, they were
well out of danger and scrambling up the rocks. In less than an
hour's time they returned to the shore with about twenty coconuts,
which they fastened in clusters to the line, and we then hauled
them to the boat.</p>

<p>We rowed farther along the coast, but, toward the middle of the
afternoon, having found no shelter, nor any signs of water, Captain
Bligh deemed it best to return to the cove for the night. We
reached our anchorage about an hour after dark. It is hardly
necessary to say that every man of us was now ravenously hungry.
Captain Bligh issued a coconut to each person; and the meat of the
nut, together with the cool liquid it contained, proved a most
welcome, but by no means a satisfying, meal.</p>

<p>The following morning we made our third unsuccessful attempt to
get round by sea to the windward side of the island. The sky was
clear, but the wind was not diminished, and we were set to bailing
the moment we were out of shelter of the land. This third
experience made it only too clear that we could not hope to go
counter to a heavy sea in our deeply laden boat, and we were
thankful indeed that we had a refuge at hand. There was nothing we
could do but return to the cove.</p>

<p>Bligh was determined that we should keep our meagre supply of
food and water intact, and although, in view of the unsuccessful
expedition of the day before, we had little hope of finding
anything on this side of the island, we decided to try again.
Therefore, Mr. Bligh, Nelson, Elphinstone, Cole, and myself set out
to examine the cliffs once more, and we were so fortunate as to
discover a way to and from the cove evidently used by the Indians
themselves. In a narrow gully which had escaped earlier notice, we
found some large, woody vines firmly attached in clefts of the rock
and to trees overhead. We could see in the walls of the cliff
footholds which the Indians had constructed to assist them in
making the ascent. We stood for a moment examining this crude
ladder.</p>

<p>"Shall I try it, sir?" Elphinstone asked.</p>

<p>"You stand an excellent chance of breaking your neck, my lad,"
Bligh replied; "but if the Indians can do it, we can."</p>

<p>Elphinstone climbed a little way until he could reach the vines,
which were of the thickness of a man's forearm. Finding that they
could easily support his weight, he proceeded, while we watched him
from below. After an all but vertical climb of forty or fifty feet,
he reached a ledge of rock that gave him a resting place, where he
turned and called down to us.</p>

<p>It was, in all truth, a perilous climb, particularly so for
Cole, who was a heavy man and encumbered with our copper kettle,
which he carried over his shoulder. A series of gigantic natural
steps brought us at last to the summit, between three and four
hundred feet above the sea. The latter part of the climb had been
less difficult; but, for all that, we little relished the thought
of a return.</p>

<p>From this vantage point we had an excellent view of the volcano,
which appeared to rise from somewhere near the centre of the
island. The intervening country was much cut up by ridges and
gullies, and had an even more desolate look than when viewed from
the sea. Nevertheless, we set out in the direction of the central
mountain, and presently entered a deeper gully that appeared to
offer a promise of water; but all that we found were a few tepid
pools amongst the rocks, so shallow that it was tedious work
scooping the water into the kettle with our coconut-shell ladle. We
collected in all three or four gallons. Leaving our kettle here, we
went on; and presently came to some abandoned huts, fallen to ruin,
and near them what had once been a plantain walk, but so concealed
by weeds and bushes that it was a near thing we had missed it. We
got three small bunches of plantains, which we slung to a pole, for
carrying in the Indian fashion. We continued inland for another
mile, but the country became more and more arid, covered in places
by ashes and lava beds where only a few hardy shrubs found
nourishment. Evidently, we could hope for nothing more in this
direction, so we returned, taking up our kettle on the way, and it
was near noon before we reached the cliffs above the cove. Bligh,
Nelson, and myself had each a bunch of plantains, fastened across
our backs with pieces of rope. Elphinstone and Cole took charge of
the kettle of water, and I still wonder that they were able to
carry it down without, I believe, the loss of so much as a drop of
the precious supply.</p>

<p>It was but natural that the thought of food should by this time
be uppermost in every man's mind. Realizing the need of sustaining
our strength, Captain Bligh allowed us the most substantial meal we
had yet enjoyed, consisting of two boiled plantains per man, with
an ounce of pork and a wineglass of water. We had combed the beach
all round the cove for shellfish without finding so much as a sea
snail. As it was impossible to leave the cove on account of the
heavy sea, another exploring party was sent out after dinner, but
they returned at sunset without having had any success. There yet
remained one direction in which none of our parties had
gone--toward the northwest--and the following morning near half of
our party, who had spent the night in the cavern that they might
have a more refreshing sleep, were sent out in a last attempt to
secure food and water. Mr. Fryer was in charge of the expedition,
and Captain Bligh ordered him not to return until he was convinced
that we had nothing to hope for in that direction.</p>

<p>They were gone a full five hours, returning about ten o'clock,
empty-handed, and with Robert Tinkler missing. He had become
separated from the others, Fryer said, shortly before the decision
to return was made. Bligh flew into a passion at this news.</p>

<p>"What, sir?" he roared at Fryer. "Do you mean to say that you,
the ship's master, cannot keep a party of seven together? Damn your
eyes! Must I go <i>everywhere</i> with you? Get you back at once
and find him! Go, the lot of you, and don't come back without
him!"</p>

<p>Silently the men set out; but they had not reached the foot of
the cliffs when they heard a shout from above--and presently came
Tinkler, carrying an Indian calabash containing about a gallon of
water, and followed by an Indian woman and two men. The men had a
cluster of husked coconuts on a pole between them.</p>

<p>This good fortune came at a time when it was needed, and I was
glad to see that Bligh, who had been cursing the lad during his
absence, forgot his anger and commended him warmly. Tinkler was
pleased as only a boy can be who has succeeded in a matter in which
his elders have failed. He had discovered the Indians near a hut in
a small, hidden valley, and had made them understand that they were
to come with him, bringing food and water.</p>

<p>The men were strongly made, bold-looking fellows, and appeared
not at all surprised to find us there. They were unarmed, and naked
except for a kirtle of tapa about the middle. The woman was a
handsome wench of about twenty, and carried a child on her hip.
They put down their load of coconuts and squatted near by, looking
at us without the least sign of fear.</p>

<p>After our long sojourn at Otaheite, a good many of us had a fair
knowledge of the Indian language as spoken there. We had already
found that the speech of the natives of Annamooka, although allied
to that of the Otaheitians, differed greatly from it; nevertheless,
we could, after a fashion, converse with these people. Mr. Nelson
was the best linguist amongst us, and he now questioned the men,
asking first about the number of inhabitants on the island and the
possibility of procuring food and water. One of them replied at
length. Much of what he said was unintelligible, but we understood
that there was a considerable population on the windward side of
the island, and that little was to be had in the way of refreshment
on this side.</p>

<p>Presently they rose, giving us to understand that they would
fetch others of their countrymen. We were in no position to be
lavish with gifts, but Captain Bligh presented them with some
buttons from his coat, which they accepted stolidly and then
departed.</p>

<p>As soon as they had gone, Mr. Bligh made a collection of
whatever small articles we could spare from our personal
belongings, to be used in trade with the Indians. We gave buttons,
handkerchiefs, clasp knives, buckles, and the like. Mr. Bligh also
prepared us for defense. Fryer and five others were to remain in
the launch in readiness for any emergency. The master had one of
our cutlasses, and the others were to be carried by Bligh, Purcell,
and Cole, the strongest men of the shore party; the rest of us cut
clubs for ourselves, but these were to be kept hidden in the
cavern, and, if possible, our trading was to be done directly in
front of the cavern, so that we should always have the Indians
before us.</p>

<p>There were, then, thirteen of us on shore, with six men in the
launch at a distance of one hundred and fifty yards. We should have
been glad to keep the parties closer together, but Mr. Bligh
thought best to have the shore party where it could not be
surrounded, and we had the launch in view so we could watch over
the situation there. Thus prepared, we waited with anxiety for the
arrival of visitors.</p>

<p>They were not long in coming. I had often remarked, at Otaheite,
with what mysterious rapidity news spreads among the Indians. So it
was here; scarcely an hour had passed before twenty or thirty men
had come down the cliffs; others came by canoes which they carried
up the beach, and by the middle of the afternoon there were forty
or fifty people in the cove. They were like the natives we had seen
at Annamooka, well-set-up, hardy-looking men, with a somewhat
insolent bearing; but we were relieved to see that they were
unarmed, and their intent appeared peaceable enough. They were
going back and forth continually, now squatting on the beach
looking at the launch, now returning to the cavern to look at us.
Of food and water they had little, but before evening we had bought
a dozen of breadfruit, and several gallons of water. By means of
Captain Bligh's magnifying glass we made a fire near the mouth of
the cavern, where we cooked some of the breadfruit for our
immediate needs, the natives looking on and commenting, in what
appeared to be a derisive manner, on our method of doing so. No
women were amongst them, nor any of their chief men, but they gave
us to understand that one of these latter would visit us the next
day.</p>

<p>Shortly after sunset they began to leave the cove, and the last
of them had gone before darkness came on. This was an encouraging
circumstance; for had they intended mischief, we thought, they
would certainly have remained to attack us in the night. We supped
upon a quarter of a breadfruit per man, and a glass of water, in
better spirits than we had been at any time since the mutiny. A
guard was set at the entrance of the cavern, and the rest retired
to sleep, comforted by Captain Bligh's assurance that the morrow
would be our last day in this dismal spot.</p>

<h2><a name="c3" id="c3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p>Captain Bligh had the enviable faculty of being able to compose
his mind for sleep under almost any conditions. I have known him to
go without rest for seventy-two hours together; but when a suitable
occasion offered, he could close his eyes and fall at once into a
refreshing slumber, though he knew that he must be awakened a
quarter of an hour later. On this night he could hope for an
undisturbed rest, and scarcely had he lain down when his quiet
breathing assured me that he was asleep. As for myself, I was never
more wakeful, and presently left the cavern to join the sentinels
outside. They were stationed twenty or thirty yards apart, so that
they might command a view in whatever direction. It was a beautiful
night, and the cove, flooded with moonlight, seemed an enchanted
spot. To the north lay the open sea, at peace now, for the wind had
died away toward sunset. The long swells swept majestically in,
breaking first along the sides of the cove, the two waves advancing
swiftly toward each other and meeting near the centre of the beach,
where the silvery foam was thrown high in air.</p>

<p>As I looked about me I was reminded of certain lonely coves I
had seen along the Cornish coast, on just such nights, and I found
it hard to realize how vast an ocean separated us from home.</p>

<p>Mr. Cole was in charge of the guard; he stood in the deep shadow
of a tree not far from the cavern. I had a great liking for the
boatswain; we had been friends almost from the day the
<i>Bounty</i> left Spithead, and there was no more competent and
reliable seaman in the ship's company. He was a devout man, with a
childlike trust in God which only exceeded his trust in Captain
Bligh. He never for a moment doubted the captain's ability to carry
us safely through whatever perils might await us. It comforted me
to talk to him, and when I returned to the cave it was in a more
hopeful frame of mind.</p>

<p>I had a fixed belief in the treacherous nature of the misnamed
Friendly Islanders, and fully expected we should be attacked during
the night. I, of course, kept my misgivings to myself, and the
following morning they seemed a little absurd. We were astir at
dawn, and there was a feeling of hopefulness and good cheer
throughout the company. We even looked forward with pleasure to the
return of the Indians; knowing now our needs, we felt that they
would supply them, and that we should be able to leave the cove by
early afternoon.</p>

<p>The sun was two hours high before the first of the natives came
down the cliffs at the back of the cove; and shortly afterwards two
canoes arrived, with a dozen or fifteen men in each. We were
greatly disappointed to find that they had brought only a meagre
supply of provisions; we were, however, able to purchase a little
water and half a dozen breadfruit. One of the canoe parties treated
us with great insolence. They had with them half a dozen calabashes
filled with water,--much more than enough for their own needs
during the day,--but they refused to trade for any part of it. They
well knew that we were on short rations of water, and taunted us by
drinking deeply of their own supply while we stood looking on.
Fortunately it was Nelson and not Bligh who was attempting to trade
with this party. Bligh had little of the diplomat in his character,
and had he been present his temper might have gotten the better of
him; but Nelson remained cool and affable, and, seeing that nothing
was to be gotten from these men, soon left them to themselves.</p>

<p>Upon returning to the cavern, we found Bligh trying to converse
with a party, headed by an elderly chief, which had just arrived
from inland. The chief was a stern-looking old man, well over six
feet, whose robe of tapa cloth, draped in graceful folds about his
person, proclaimed his rank; but had he been naked he could have
been recognized at once as a man of superior station. In one hand
he carried a spear of ironwood, barbed with bones of the stingray's
tail, and tucked into a fold of his robe at the waist was what
appeared to be a comb with long wooden teeth. Bligh looked around
with relief at our approach.</p>

<p>"You have come in good time, Nelson; I was about to send for
you. See what you can make of this man's speech."</p>

<p>Nelson then addressed him in the Otaheitian language, while most
of our company and between thirty and forty of the natives stood
looking on. The chief replied with a natural grace and eloquence
common to the Indians of the South Sea, but there was a look of
cruelty and cunning in his eye that belied his manner. I gave him
close attention, but although I somewhat prided myself upon my
knowledge of the Otaheitian tongue, I found it of little use to me
in listening to the Friendly Island speech. Nelson, however, had a
quick ear to detect affinities and an agile mind to grasp at
meanings, and it was plain that he and the chief could make
themselves fairly well understood. Presently he turned to
Bligh.</p>

<p>"He has either seen us at Annamooka or had heard of our being
there," he said. "I can understand only about half of what he says,
but he wishes to know how we lost the ship, and where."</p>

<p>We were prepared for that question. Mr. Bligh had at first been
undecided how to account for our presence here, in case Indians
should be met with. We could not hope to be believed if we should
say that the ship was at hand, for they could see for themselves
that she was not; therefore, he instructed us to say that the
vessel had been lost, and that we alone had been saved from the
wreck. This, we knew, was a dangerous confession to make, but
circumstances forced it upon us.</p>

<p>I watched the man's face while Nelson was relating the story,
but he remained impassive, showing neither interest in nor concern
for our plight. Nelson was puzzled for a time by the man's next
inquiry, but at length grasped the meaning of it.</p>

<p>"He wishes to see the thing with which you bring fire from the
sun," he said. Bligh was reluctant to bring forth his magnifying
glass again, well knowing how the Indians would covet such a
precious instrument; nevertheless, he thought it best to humour the
chief. Some dry leaves were gathered and crumbled into a powder.
Our visitors gathered round, looking on with intense interest
whilst Bligh focused the rays of the sun upon the tinder; and when
they saw smoke emerge, and the small flame appear, a murmur of
astonishment ran through the crowd. The chief was determined to
possess this wonder worker, and when Bligh refused him, his
vexation and disappointment were only too apparent. He then asked
for nails, the most acceptable article of barter with the natives
of the South Sea, but the few parcels we possessed could not be
parted with, and Nelson was instructed to tell him that we had
none.</p>

<p>Whilst this conversation was taking place, other Indians were
arriving, amongst them a chief whose rank appeared to be equal to,
if not higher than, that of the first; he showed no deference to
the older man, and we observed that the crowd of natives around us,
immediately they saw him, opened a lane through their ranks so that
he and his followers might approach. He was a man of about forty,
of commanding presence. As he entered the open space where we
stood, he glanced keenly from one to another of us. Then he walked
up to Captain Bligh, but I noticed that he omitted, as the older
chief had done, the ceremony of rubbing noses--a formal courtesy
which had never been omitted heretofore, when we had the
<i>Bounty</i> at our backs.</p>

<p>None of us could recollect having seen either of these chiefs at
Annamooka. We learned that the name of the elder man was
Maccaackavow,--at least, that is as near as I can come to the sound
of the name,--and the other was called Eefow. We gathered that both
came from the island of Tongataboo. When Bligh informed them that
we proposed to go either to that island or to Annamooka, Eefow
offered to accompany us as soon as the wind and sea should
moderate. Bligh invited them into the cavern, where he presented
each with a knife and a shirt.</p>

<p>It was at this time that I took up one of the skulls we had
found there, and, bringing it to the chief Eefow, asked, in the
Otaheitian dialect, whence it came. His face lit up at the
question, and he replied: "Feejee, Feejee." He then went on, with
great animation, to explain about them; and we understood that he
himself had been the slayer of two of these victims. Captain Bligh
was greatly interested in this narration, for when he had visited
the Friendly Islands with Captain Cook he had gathered much
information about a great archipelago, unknown to Europeans, called
"Feejee" by the Indians, and which was not far distant from the
Friendly Islands. He had Nelson question Eefow at length about
Feejee, and was told the group comprised a vast number of islands,
the nearest of which lay about a two days' sail from Tofoa. When we
came out of the cavern, Bligh had Eefow point out their direction,
and the chief showed him what bearings should be taken to sail
toward them from Tofoa. The direction was to the west-northwest,
which confirmed what Bligh had already been told.</p>

<p>This conference in the cavern had gone most prosperously, and we
were encouraged to hope that our fears were groundless with respect
to the Indians' intentions toward us. Another favourable incident
occurred at this time: A man named Nageete, whom Mr. Bligh
remembered having seen at Annamooka, came forward and greeted him
in the most friendly manner. Although not a chief, he appeared to
be a personage of some importance, and Bligh made much of him,
taking care, however, to distinguish between his attitude toward
Nageete and that toward the chiefs. With this man's help we were
able to add considerably to our stock of water, enough for our
immediate needs, so that we could keep the launch's stock intact;
and we also purchased a few more breadfruit and a half-dozen large
yams; but our scant supply of articles for trade was soon
exhausted. Thereafter they would give us nothing; not so much as
half a breadfruit would they part with unless payment were made for
it.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, we were at a loss what to do; we had
parted with everything we could spare and were still in great need
of food and water. Bligh appealed to the chiefs, again explaining
our predicament. Nelson was as eloquent as possible, but the effect
was negligible.</p>

<p>When he had finished, Macca-ackavow replied: "You say you have
nothing left, but you have the instrument for making fire. Let me
have that and my people here shall give you all they have."</p>

<p>But this request Bligh could not, of course, comply with; we had
no flint and steel amongst us, and none of us was able to kindle
fire by friction, in the Indian fashion. Macca-ackavow became
sullen at our refusal to part with the magnifying glass.</p>

<p>Eefow then said: "Let us see what you have in your boat." But
again Bligh refused, for the few tools and parcels of nails we had
there were only less necessary than food itself.</p>

<p>So matters went until toward midday.</p>

<p>For our dinner we had each a small piece of cooked breadfruit,
and sliver of pork. Bligh invited the chiefs to join our meal,
which they did. It was a most uncomfortable repast. We were all
sensible of a change in the attitude of the Indians: small groups
conferred among themselves, and the two chiefs, whilst eating with
us, conversed in what appeared to be some special and figurative
speech, so that not even Nelson could understand a word that was
said.</p>

<p>Fifteen of our company were on shore at this time; Fryer, with
three men, remained with the launch, which still lay at a grapnel
just beyond the break of the surf. We estimated that there were
well over two hundred Indians around us, and not a woman amongst
them. Fortunately, only the chiefs and two or three of their
immediate retainers were armed.</p>

<p>The chiefs now left us and went amongst their people. Bligh took
the occasion to inform us of his plans and to instruct us as to
what our behaviour toward the natives should be throughout the
afternoon.</p>

<p>"It is not yet clear," he said, "that they have formed a design
against us, and we must act as though we had no suspicion of any
such intent; but be on your guard, every man of you...Mr. Peckover,
you shall select three men and carry what supplies we have to the
launch; but perform this business in a casual manner. Let there be
no haste in your actions. We shall leave the cove at sunset,
whether or no Eefow accompanies us, and make our way to Tongataboo,
but I wish the Indians to be deceived on this point until we are
ready to embark."</p>

<p>We had a fire going near the cavern, and the breadfruit had been
cooked as we bought it. Peckover chose Peter Lenkletter, Lebogue,
and young Tinkler to assist him, and they now began carrying down
the supplies, a little at a time. This was dangerous work, for they
had to run the gantlet of many groups of savages collected between
us and the launch, and it was performed with a coolness deserving
of high praise. Tinkler, who was no more than a lad, behaved
admirably, and he was immensely proud that he had been chosen for
the task over the other midshipmen. Meanwhile, Bligh sat at the
mouth of the cavern, keeping a watchful eye upon all that went on
and, at the same time, writing in his journal as quietly as though
he were in his cabin on the <i>Bounty</i>. The rest of us busied
ourselves with small matters, to make it appear that we expected to
spend the night ashore. Nageete, who had strolled away after our
midday meal, returned after a little time, apparently as well
disposed as ever. He asked what our intentions were, and was told
that 'we should wait until Eefow was ready to accompany us to
Tongataboo, but that we hoped, in case the weather favoured, he
would consent to go on the following day.</p>

<p>Nageete then said: "Eefow will go if you will give him the fire
maker; and you should let him have it, rather than Macca-ackavow,
for he is the greater chief."</p>

<p>Bligh might have resorted to guile, making a promise of the
coveted glass, but this he refused to do, telling Nageete that
under no circumstances could he part with it.</p>

<p>Presently the two chiefs rejoined us, and Bligh, with Nelson to
interpret, questioned them further about the Feejee Islands, doing
everything possible to keep our relations with them on a friendly
and casual footing.</p>

<p>Whilst this conversation was taking place, an incident occurred
that might easily have proved disastrous. There was a great crowd
of Indians along the beach. Of a sudden, a dozen or more of them
rushed to the line which held the launch to the shore and began to
haul it in. We heard a warning shout from Peckover, who was just
then returning with his party. Bligh, cutlass in hand, rushed for
the beach, the rest of us, including the chiefs, following. His
courage and force of character never showed to better advantage
than on this occasion. We were vastly outnumbered, and might easily
have been attacked and slain; but Bligh so overawed them by his
manner that they immediately let go the rope, and Fryer and those
with him hauled the launch back to its former position. This move
of the Indians was made, I think, without the knowledge of the
chiefs. However that may be, they at least ordered the men away
from that vicinity,--Bligh having insisted upon this,--and all
became quiet again.</p>

<p>It would have been well could we have embarked then and there;
and Bligh would have had us make a rush for it, I think, had it not
been that Cole and three others had been sent inland in the hope of
finding a few more quarts of water. They had not yet returned, so
we made our way back to the cavern to wait for them.</p>

<p>Then followed an anxious time. It became more and more apparent
that we were to be attacked, and that the savages were merely
biding a favourable opportunity. We were equally sure that the
chiefs were of one mind about this and that they had informed their
followers that we were to be destroyed.</p>

<p>"Keep well together, lads," said Bligh quietly. "See that none
of them comes behind us. Damn their eyes! What are they waiting
for?"</p>

<p>"I believe they're afraid of us, sir," said Fryer. "Either that,
or they hope to take us by surprise."</p>

<p>We had not long to wait for evidence of their intentions.
Savages, although they invariably recognize and respect the
authority of their chiefs, lack discipline, and when a course of
action is decided upon, are impatient to put it into effect. So it
was here. Shortly after this, we heard, from a distance, an ominous
sound: the knocking of stones together, which we rightly supposed
was a signal amongst them previous to an attack. At first only a
few of them did this, but gradually the sound spread, increasing in
volume, to all parts of the cove; at moments it became all but
deafening, and then would die away only to be resumed with even
greater insistence, as though the commoners were growing
increasingly impatient with their chiefs for withholding the signal
for slaughter. The effect upon our little band may be imagined. We
believed that our last hour had come; we stood together, a
well-knit band, every man resolved to sell his life as dearly as
possible.</p>

<p>It was late afternoon when Cole and his party returned with
about two quarts of water which they had collected amongst the
rocks. Mr. Bligh had kept a record of everything we had been able
to secure in the way of provision, and the water we had either
bought or found for ourselves had been just sufficient for our
needs. We had added nothing to our twenty-eight gallons in the
launch, but neither had we taken anything from that supply. Now
that the shore party was again united, we waited only for a
suitable opportunity before making an attempt to embark. Meanwhile,
the clapping of stones went on, now here, now there, and yet it was
necessary for us to keep up the pretense that we suspected
nothing.</p>

<p>Nageete, who had been with us during this time, was becoming
increasingly restless and was only seeking some pretext for getting
away, but Bligh kept him engaged in conversation. We were all
gathered before the entrance of the cavern in such a way that the
Indians could not pass behind us. For the most part, they were
gathered in groups of twenty or thirty, at some distance, and we
saw the two chiefs passing from group to group. Presently they
returned to where we stood, and I must do them the credit to say
that they were masters at the art of dissembling. We asked them the
meaning of the stone clapping, and they gave us to understand that
it was merely a game in which their followers indulged to while
away the time. They then attempted to persuade Captain Bligh and
Nelson to accompany them away from the rest of us, as though they
wished to confer with them in private, but Bligh pretended not to
understand. We were all on our feet, in instant readiness to defend
ourselves; nevertheless, I believe that we did succeed by our
actions--for a time at least--in convincing the chiefs that we were
ignorant of their intentions. Immediately they returned to us the
clapping of stones had ceased, and the ensuing silence seemed the
more profound.</p>

<p>Eefow then asked: "You will sleep on shore tonight?"</p>

<p>Captain Bligh replied: "No, I never sleep away from my boat; but
it may be that I shall leave a part of my men in the cavern." Our
hope was, of course, that we could persuade the Indians of an
intention to remain in the cove until the following day. I think
there must have been a difference of opinion between the two chiefs
as to when the attack upon us should be made, and that the elder
one was for immediate action and Eefow for a night attack. They
again conversed together in their figurative speech, of which we
understood nothing.</p>

<p>Bligh said to us, very quietly: "Be ready, lads. If they make a
hostile move, we will kill them both and fight our way to the
launch."</p>

<p>We were, of course, in the unfortunate position of not being
able to begin the attack, and yet we were almost at the point where
action, however desperate, would have seemed preferable to further
delay.</p>

<p>Eefow now turned again to Nelson. "Tell your captain," he said,
"that we shall spend the night here. To-morrow I will go with you
in your boat to Tongataboo."</p>

<p>Nelson interpreted this message, and Bligh replied: "That is
good." The chiefs then left us; but when they had gone a distance
of fifteen or twenty paces, Macca-ackavow turned with an expression
on his face that I shall not soon forget.</p>

<p>"You will not spend the night ashore?" he again asked.</p>

<p>"What does he say, Nelson?" asked Bligh.</p>

<p>Nelson interpreted.</p>

<p>"God damn him, tell him no!" said Bligh.</p>

<p>Nelson conveyed this message at some length, and in a more
diplomatic manner than Bligh had used. The chief stood facing us,
glancing, swiftly from side to side amongst his followers. Then he
again spoke, very briefly; and having done so, strode swiftly
away.</p>

<p>"What is it, Nelson?" asked Bligh.</p>

<p>Nelson smiled grimly. "'<i>Te mo mate gimotoloo</i>,'" he
replied. "Their intentions are clear enough now. It means: 'Then
you shall die.'"</p>

<p>Bligh's actions at this time were beyond praise. To see him rise
to a desperate occasion was an experience to be treasured in the
memory. He was cool and clear-headed, and he talked quietly, even
cheerfully, to us.</p>

<p>"It is now or never, lads," he said. "Halt, serve out quickly
the water Mr. Cole has brought in."</p>

<p>The calabash was passed rapidly from hand to hand, for we knew
it would be impossible to get the water to the launch; each man had
a generous sup, and it was needed, for we had been on short rations
for three days. All this while Bligh had kept a firm grip with his
left hand on Nageete's arm, holding his cutlass in his right. He
was determined that, if we were to die, Nageete should die with us.
The man's face was a study. I have not been able to determine in my
own mind, to this day, whether he was playing a part or was
genuinely friendly towards us. I imagine, however, that he had a
heart as treacherous as those of his countrymen.</p>

<p>Bligh had already instructed us in what order we should proceed
to the beach. Cole, also armed with a cutlass, took his station
with the captain on the other side of Nageete; and the rest of us
fell in behind, with Purcell and Norton bringing up the rear.</p>

<p>"Forward, lads!" said Bligh. "Let these bastards see how
Englishmen behave in a tight place!"</p>

<p>We then proceeded toward the beach, everyone in a kind of silent
horror.</p>

<p>I believe it was the promptness, the unexpectedness of our
action alone that saved us. Had we shown the least hesitation, we
must have all been slain; but Bligh led us straight on, directly
toward one large group of Indians who were between us and the
launch. They parted to let us through, and I well remember my
feeling of incredulous wonder at finding myself still alive when we
had passed beyond them. Not a word was spoken, nor was a hand
lifted against us until we reached the beach.</p>

<p>Fryer had, of course, seen us coming, and had slacked away until
the launch was within half a dozen paces of the beach, in about
four feet of water.</p>

<p>"In with you, lads! Look alive!" Bligh shouted. "Purcell, stand
by with me--you and Norton!"</p>

<p>Within half a minute we were all in the boat, save Bligh and the
two men with him. Nageete now wrenched himself free from Bligh's
grasp and ran up the beach. The captain and Purcell made for the
boat, wisely not attempting to bring in the grapnel on shore; but
Norton, who Bligh thought was immediately behind him, ran back to
fetch it. We shouted to him to let it go; but either he did not or
would not hear.</p>

<p>The Indians by this time had been roused to action, and they
were upon Norton in an instant, beating out his brains with stones.
Meanwhile we had hauled Bligh and Purcell into the boat and got out
the oars. The natives seized the line which held us to the shore;
but Bligh severed it with a stroke of his cutlass, and the men
forward quickly hauled us out to the other grapnel and attempted to
pull it up. To our dismay, one of the flukes had caught and two or
three precious minutes were lost before it was gotten clear. It was
fortunate for us that the savages were unarmed; had they been
possessed of spears, or bows and arrows, the chance of any man's
escaping would have been small indeed. The only spears amongst them
were those carried by the two chiefs. Macca-ackavow hurled his,
which passed within a few inches of Peckover's head and fell into
the water a dozen yards beyond us.</p>

<p>But whilst they had no man-made weapons, the beach offered them
an inexhaustible supply of stones, and we received such a shower of
these that, had we not been a good thirty yards distant, a number
of us might have met Norton's fate. As it was, Purcell was knocked
senseless by a blow on the head, and various others were badly
hurt. The speed and accuracy with which they cast the stones were
amazing. We protected ourselves as well as we could with bundles of
cloathing which we held before us. Meanwhile the men forward were
hauling desperately on the grapnel, which at last gave way and came
up with one fluke broken. Bligh, at the tiller, was in the most
exposed position of any; that he escaped serious injury was due to
the efforts of Elphinstone and Cole, who shielded him with floor
boards from the stern sheets.</p>

<p>We now began to pull away from them, but the treacherous
villains were not done with us yet. They got one of their canoes
into the water, which they loaded with stones, whereupon a dozen of
them leaped into her to pursue us. Our six men at the oars pulled
with all their strength, but we were so heavily laden that the
savages gained swiftly upon us. Nevertheless, we had got out of the
cove and beyond view of the throng on the beach before we were
overtaken. They now had us at their mercy, and began throwing
stones with such deadly accuracy that it seemed a miracle some of
us were not killed. A few of the stones fell into the boat and were
hurled back at them; we had the satisfaction of seeing one of their
paddlers struck squarely in the face by a stone cast by the
boatswain. However, that was a chance shot: we should have been no
match for them at this kind of warfare even had we possessed a
supply of ammunition.</p>

<p>In the hope of distracting their attention from us, Mr. Bligh
threw some articles of cloathing into the water; and to our joy
they stopped to take them in. It was now getting dark, and, as they
could have had but a few stones left in the canoe, they gave over
the attack, and a moment later disappeared past the headland at the
entrance to the cove. We were by no means sure that others would
not attempt to come after us, so we pulled straight out to sea
until we caught the breeze. With our sails set, we were soon past
all danger of pursuit.</p>

<p>I was busy during the next hour caring for our wounded, of whom
there were nine in all. Purcell was badly hurt. He had been struck
a glancing blow on the head, which laid open his scalp and knocked
him unconscious, but, by the time I was able to attend to him, he
was again sitting up, apparently but little the worse for a blow
that would have killed most men. An examination of the wound
assured me pretty well that the skull had not been fractured. It
was necessary to take half a dozen stitches in the scalp.
Elphinstone had had two fingers of his right hand broken while
protecting Captain Bligh, and Lenkletter had been deeply gashed
across the cheek bone. The other wounds were bruises, the worst
being that of Hall, who had been struck full on the right breast
and nearly knocked out of the launch.</p>

<p>It can be imagined with what feelings of gratitude to God we
watched the island of Tofoa dropping away astern. Now that we had
time to reflect, a truer sense of the horror of the situation from
which we had so narrowly escaped came home to us. The death of
Norton cast a gloom upon all our spirits, but we avoided speaking
of him then; the manner of his death was too clearly in mind, and
it seemed that we could still hear the yells of the savages who had
murdered him. Captain Bligh took his loss very much to heart and
blamed himself that he had not thought to inform us, beforehand, to
give no heed to the grapnel on shore. But he was by no means at
fault. What the situation would be on the beach could not have been
foretold, and poor Norton himself should have seen the folly of
trying to save the grapnel. Nevertheless, his was an act of heroism
such as few men would have been capable of attempting.</p>

<p>The wind, from the east-southeast, freshened as we drew away
from the land; the darkness deepened, and soon Tofoa was lost to
view save for the baleful glare from its volcano, reflected on the
clouds above. Meanwhile we had gotten the boat in order and had
taken the places Captain Bligh had assigned to us for the night.
With respect to food, we still had our one hundred and fifty pounds
of bread, short of a few ounces eaten at Tofoa, twenty pounds of
pork, thirty-one coconuts, sixteen breadfruit, and seven yams; but
both the breadfruit and the yams, which had been cooked on shore,
had been trampled under our feet during the attack. Nevertheless,
we salvaged the filthy mess and ate it during subsequent days. As
already related, we still had twenty-eight gallons of water--the
same amount we had carried away from the Bounty--but we had left
only three bottles of wine, and five quarts of rum.</p>

<p>I am not likely to forget the conference we then held to
determine our future course of action. We were running, of
necessity, before the wind, in a direction almost the opposite to
that of Annamooka or Tongataboo, and Fryer, who was the first to
speak, earnestly begged Captain Bligh to continue this course--to
proceed with us in the direction of home.</p>

<p>"We know what we have to expect of the savages, sir," he said.
"Without arms, our experience at Tofoa will only be repeated on
other islands, and we could not hope to come off so fortunate
again."</p>

<p>Other voices were joined to the master's; there was no doubt as
to the general desire of our company to brave the perils of the sea
rather than those certain to be met with on land. Bligh was willing
to be persuaded; in fact, I am sure that he himself would have
proposed this change of plan had no one else spoken of it.
Nevertheless, he wished us to be fully aware of the dangers ahead
of us.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Mr. Fryer," he asked, "how far we must sail before
we shall have any expectation of help?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly, sir."</p>

<p>"To the Dutch East Indies," Bligh went on; "and the first of
their settlements is on the island of Timor, a full twelve hundred
leagues from here."</p>

<p>A moment of silence followed. Not one of us, I believe, but was
thinking: "Twelve hundred leagues! What hope, then, have we?"</p>

<p>"Even so," said Bligh, "our situation is by no means hopeless.
Granted that every man of you gives me his full support, I believe
we shall reach Timor."</p>

<p>"That you shall have, sir!" said Peckover. "What do you say,
lads?" There was a hearty agreement to this.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Bligh. "Now let me tell you, briefly, what we
are likely to have in store. First, as to favouring elements: we
are at a most fortunate time of year; we can count upon easterly
winds for as long as we shall be at sea. The northwest monsoon
should not commence before November, and long before that time we
shall have reached Timor, or be forever past the need of reaching
it. The launch is stoutly built; deeply laden as we are, we need
not fear her ability to run before the wind. Her performance at
this moment is a promise of what she can do. As to the perils we
must meet--"</p>

<p>He paused while reflecting upon them. "Of those I need not
speak," he went on. "They are known to all of you. But this I will
say: If we are to reach Timor, we must live upon a daily allowance
of food and water no more than sufficient to preserve our lives. I
desire every man's assurance that he will cheerfully agree to the
amount I shall decide upon. It will be small indeed, but we can be
almost certain of replenishing our water many times before the end
of the voyage. However, that remains to be seen, and I shall not
anticipate doing so in deciding what each man's portion shall be.
Mr. Fryer, have I your solemn promise to abide by my judgment in
this matter?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Fryer replied promptly.</p>

<p>Mr. Bligh then called each man by name, and all agreed as Fryer
had done.</p>

<p>These matters having been decided, we fell silent, and so
remained for some time; then Cole, who was seated amidships, said:
"Mr. Bligh, we should be pleased if you would ask God's blessing
upon our voyage."</p>

<p>"That I shall do, Mr. Cole," Bligh replied.</p>

<p>Never, I imagine, have English seamen been more sensible of the
need for Divine guidance than the eighteen men in the
<i>Bounty's</i> launch. We waited, our heads bowed in the darkness,
for our leader to speak.</p>

<p>"Almighty God. Thou seest our afflictions. Thou knowest our
need. Grant that we may quit ourselves like men in the trials and
dangers that lie before us. Watch over us. Strengthen our hearts;
and in Thy divine mercy and compassion, bring us all in safety to
the haven toward which we now direct our course. Amen."</p>

<p>The watch for the early part of the night was now set, and the
rest of us arranged ourselves for sleep as well as we could. The
wind blew with increasing freshness, but the launch behaved well.
The moonlit sea before us seemed to stretch away to infinity.</p>

<p>"Slack away a little, Mr. Cole," Bligh called.</p>

<h2><a name="c4" id="c4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p>The sea was calm, though there was a fresh breeze at east. Now
that Tofoa had been lost to view, every man in the boat, I believe,
felt, for the first time since casting off from the <i>Bounty</i>,
a faint thrill of hope. I was fully aware of the immense remoteness
of the Dutch East Indies, and of the difficulties and dangers
through which we should be obliged to pass were we to reach those
distant islands; but Mr. Bligh's confident manner, and his calmness
during our perilous escape from the savages, convinced me of our
good fortune in being under his command.</p>

<p>Heavily laden as she was, and with only the reefed lug foresail
set, the boat sailed fast to the westward. Mr. Bligh was at the
tiller, with Peckover beside him; Fryer, Elphinstone, Nelson, and I
sat in the stern sheets. The two midshipmen on the thwart were
already asleep; but Tinkler, who had been chosen for Peckover's
watch, was making prodigious efforts to keep awake. The gunner
noticed the lad's yawns.</p>

<p>"Get you to sleep, Mr. Tinkler," he said gruffly; "I shan't need
you to-night."</p>

<p>There was little talk among the men forward, though nearly all
were awake. The slower-witted, I suppose, were only now arriving at
a full realization of what lay before us. I heard frequent groans
from those who were nursing bruises, and indeed my own injured
shoulder was so painful as to preclude the possibility of sleep. It
may be worthy of remark that the tincture of Arnica montana, of
which I had a small supply, proved of great value to those of us
who had been hurt.</p>

<p>Calm as the sea was, the launch was so deep that we shipped
quantities of water as we ran clear of the land and began to feel
the long roll of the Southern Ocean from east to west. Peckover set
two men--Lebogue and Simpson--to bailing. Toward midnight, as the
sea grew higher, they had all they could do to keep her clear of
water, and became so fatigued that Peckover ordered others to
relieve them. He pulled out his large silver watch, scrutinized it
intently, and returned it to his pocket.</p>

<p>"What hour have you, Mr. Peckover?" asked the captain. "I can't
make out, sir."</p>

<p>Bligh glanced up at the stars. "Mr. Fryer, you have had no
sleep?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not yet, sir."</p>

<p>"Take the tiller, if you please; I shall try to rest, and I
recommend you to do the same at four o'clock."</p>

<p>They changed places, moving gingerly in the pitching boat, and
Bligh made himself as comfortable as possible. Hayward and Hallet
rubbed their eyes as they were wakened to their turns at the
bailing; they drew their jackets around them, shivering at the
spray which flew constantly over the quarters.</p>

<p>Toward morning the wind chopped round from N.E. to E.S.E., and
blew very cold, while the sea grew high and confused, breaking
frequently over the stern of the launch. Mr. Bligh was aware of the
change instantly, and took the tiller from the master's hands. Four
men were now required to throw out the water, which came in sheets
over the transom and quarters of the boat. At dawn the sky was
overcast with low, dirty clouds, scudding fast to the westward, and
the sun rose red and ominous. We were a sorry crew in the light of
this Sunday morning; haggard-eyed, wet to the skin with salt spray,
and so stiff that some could scarcely straighten their legs. Nelson
tried to smile; his teeth chattered so violently that he stammered
when he spoke.</p>

<p>Mr. Bligh's face looked drawn in the gray light, but his eyes
were cool and alert. Each wave sent sheets of wind-driven spray
into the boat; presently a sea greater than the others swung us
high and curled over the transom. Above the roaring of the waves I
heard faint cries and curses from the men as a rush of water swept
forward in the bilges. Then, while I plied a coconut shell,
snatched up in an instant, I heard Bligh's voice, audible in the
calm of the trough. He was shouting to Hall, who sat with Lamb in
the bows:--</p>

<p>"The bread! The bread!"</p>

<p>The man had been crouching with his head in his arms, shivering
with the cold. He stared aft dazedly. Our bread had been stowed in
the bow of the launch, the place least exposed to the driving
spray. It was in three bags, and had been covered with the spare
mainsail.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir!" Hall shouted back, bending down to raise the
canvas and examine what was beneath. A moment later he straightened
his back. "One sack is wet, sir!" he shouted. "The lot will be
spoiled if it's left here!"</p>

<p>Bligh glanced fore and aft. "Mr. Purcell!" he called.</p>

<p>The carpenter was plying a scoop close beside his chest. Another
wave was passing beneath us, bringing fresh sheets of spray, but no
solid water this time. He passed the scoop to the man behind him,
who began to bail at once.</p>

<p>"Aye, sir," he said.</p>

<p>"Clear your chest of tools; place them in the bilges."</p>

<p>The carpenter removed the tray of small tools, and the heavier
ones beneath.</p>

<p>"Now, lads, look alive!" Bligh shouted when all was ready. "Wait
till I give the word. One sack at a time! Hall, you and Smith pull
out the first and pass it to Lebogue! Then aft to the chest, hand
to hand. Mr. Hayward, open the chest when the time comes. Mr.
Purcell will cut the seizing and dump the bread in loose. Work
fast! It'll be empty bellies otherwise!"</p>

<p>All but those bailing waited in suspense until the launch's bow
shot up and she jogged back into the next trough.</p>

<p>"Now!" shouted Bligh.</p>

<p>Off came the sail; the sack was passed swiftly aft from hand to
hand, cut open with a touch of the carpenter's clasp knife, and
dumped into the open chest. Hayward closed the lid with a snap. The
sail was safely tucked about the two remaining sacks before we felt
the lift of the following wave. In the momentary lulls between
succeeding waves, the other sacks came aft and their contents were
safely stowed.</p>

<p>Every man in the boat, I believe, must have drawn a sigh of
heartfelt relief. Small as our supply of bread was for such a
voyage as lay before us, it was all that stood between us and
certain death by starvation. It had been stowed in the chest not a
moment too soon.</p>

<p>The seas grew so high that our scrap of sail hung slack from the
yard when in the trough, filling with a report like a musket shot
as the following sea raised us high aloft. Then the launch would
rush forward dizzily, while water poured in over the quarters, and
the straining sail, small as it was, threatened to snap the
unstayed mast. Mr. Bligh crouched at the helm with an impassive
face, turning his head mechanically to glance back as each rearing
sea overtook us. Had he relaxed his vigilance for a moment, or made
a false motion of the tiller, the boat would have broached to and
filled instantly. All hands were now obliged to bail, those who had
nothing better throwing out the water with coconut shells. We were
greatly hampered by the coils of rope, spare sails, and bundles of
cloathing in the bilges. The force of the gale increased as it
veered back to east and to northeast; it was soon apparent to all
hands that our sail was too much to have set.</p>

<p>"We must lighten her, Mr. Fryer!" Bligh shouted above the roar
of wind and sea. "Each man may keep two suits of
cloathing--jettison the rest! And heave overboard the spare
foresail and all but one coil of rope!"</p>

<p>"Aye, sir!" replied the master. "Can we not shorten sail? I fear
we'll drive her under with but a single reef!"</p>

<p>Bligh shook his head. "No, she'll do. Over with the spare
gear!"</p>

<p>His orders were carried out with an alacrity which showed that
those under him realized the imminence of our danger. Though the
weight of what we cast away would scarcely have exceeded that of a
heavy man, the boat rode better for it, and the clearing of the
bilges enabled six of us, bailing constantly, to keep her dry. A
quarter of a cooked breadfruit, much dirtied and trampled during
our naval engagement with the Friendly Islanders, was served out to
each man with half a pint of water.</p>

<p><a name="0800411h-01" id="0800411h-01"></a>It was close on noon
when the wind veered once more to E.S.E.; and as we could do
nothing but run straight before it, the boat was now steered
W.N.W.--in which direction, the Indians had informed us, lay the
group of large islands they called Feejee. The sea was now higher
than ever, and the labour of bailing very wearisome, but I was
losing my dread of the boat foundering, for I perceived that since
we had lightened her she rode wonderfully well, and was in little
danger with a skillful hand at the helm. At twelve o'clock by the
gunner's watch, Mr. Bligh had his sextant fetched out, and with two
of us holding him propped up in the stern sheets, he managed to
observe the altitude of the sun. Elphinstone was at the tiller, and
I noticed with relief that he steered with confidence and skill.
Our lives, from moment to moment, depended upon our helmsman. Had
there been an awkward or timid man in his place, our chances would
have been small indeed.</p>

<p>"We have done well," said the captain, when he had returned to
the stern sheet..."Ah, well steered, Mr. Elphinstone! Damme! Well
steered!"</p>

<p>A great sea lifted us high and passed under the launch, roaring
and foaming on both sides. As we dropped into the calm of the
trough, Mr. Bligh went on: "You see how she behaves, lads? She'll
see us through if we do our part! By God, she will! Mr. Fryer, by
my reckoning, we have run eighty-six miles since leaving
Tofoa."</p>

<p>The wind was our friend as well as our enemy. Captain Bligh's
feeling for the launch was shared by every man of us; we were
beginning to love her, now that we knew something of her
qualities.</p>

<p>"We must have a log," Bligh added. "Mr. Fryer, I count on you
and the boatswain to provide us with a line, properly marked. Mr.
Purcell, see what you can do to make us a log chip."</p>

<p>When we had eaten our dinner of five small coconuts, the
carpenter took apart the tray from his chest; and from its
bottom--a piece of thin oaken plank--he sawed out a small triangle,
about six inches on a side. One side was weighted with a bit of
sheet lead, and a hole was bored at each corner. The whole made
what seamen call a "chip."</p>

<p>We had on board two stout fishing lines, each of about fifty
fathoms length. One was kept towing behind the boat with a hook to
which a bit of rag had been made fast. From the other, Fryer made a
bridle for the log chip, measured off twelve fathoms, and marked
the place with his thumb. The boatswain had been twisting some bits
of a handkerchief; as the master held out the line, he rove a bit
of the rag through the strands and knotted it fast. Then, with the
carpenter's rule, Fryer measured off very carefully twenty-five
feet. At this point the boatswain made fast another bit of rag,
with a trailing end, in which he tied one knot. This was repeated,
tying two knots, three knots, and so on until there were eight
knots in the last rag.</p>

<p>"Will eight be enough, sir?" Fryer asked.</p>

<p>The captain was at the tiller, glancing back over his shoulder
at the wave behind us. When it had passed under us, he replied in
the sudden calm: "Aye, eight will do. Mr. Peckover, take your watch
in the lee of the chest there, and practise counting seconds with
Mr. Cole. You'll soon have the hang of it, I'll be bound!"</p>

<p>I heard them for a long time, as we sank into the troughs
between the seas, counting monotonously: "One-an', two-an',
three-an', four-an'..." At last the gunner called back: "Mr.
Bligh!"</p>

<p>"Aye; are you ready?"</p>

<p>"We'll not be a second off, sir!"</p>

<p>"Then heave the log!"</p>

<p>Peckover coiled the line in his right hand to pay out freely,
while the boatswain took his place at the starboard quarter. At a
sign from the gunner he cast the log chip into the sea, and as the
twelve-fathom mark passed through his fingers he began to count. At
the fifteenth second he gripped the line and turned to Mr.
Bligh.</p>

<p>"Four and a half, sir," he reported, beginning to pull in the
line. "Good! From now on, let the mate of the watch heave the log
every hour. I shall reckon our longitude each day with the aid of
Mr. Peckover's watch, and we can check the results by dead
reckoning."</p>

<p>Crouched in the stern sheets, shivering and wet to the skin, I
caught Nelson's eye as I turned my back to the spray. His thoughts,
perhaps, like my own, were of the change in Bligh. He was above all
a man of action, and seemed happy only in situations which demanded
the exercise of his truly great qualities of skill, courage, and
resourcefulness. He was born to lead men in peril or in battle, and
now, in the boat, with the sea for enemy and his task the
preservation of his men's lives, he was at his best--cheerful,
kindly, and considerate to a degree I should have believed
impossible a fortnight before.</p>

<p>The weather continued very severe during the afternoon and
throughout the night; Captain Bligh held the tiller for eighteen
hours. Though we had not yet begun to suffer greatly for lack of
food, the night was a miserable one. At sunset the wind veered a
little to the southward and blew so chill that I found it
impossible to sleep. Laborious as the task of bailing was, we
seized the scoops gladly when our turns came, for the hard work
warmed us.</p>

<p>By nine o'clock the wind had blown the sky clear; the moon,
sinking toward the west, cast a cold, serene light on the roaring
sea. Each time the boat was flung aloft, we gazed out over miles of
angry water, tossing, breaking, and ridged with great waves running
to the west. Had not every bone in my body ached with the cold, I
think I might have felt a kind of exultation at the majesty of the
spectacle, and in the thought that our boat, small and frail as she
was, could carry us safely over such a sea. And I was aware of what
might be termed a cosmic rhythm in the procession of the waves.
They passed under us with great regularity, the interval being
about the time it took me to count ten, very slowly; they seemed to
be about two hundred yards from crest to crest, and I estimated
that they passed us at not less than thirty miles an hour. Hour
after hour we alternated between fierce wind and spray and the roar
of breaking water on the crests, and the calm of the black troughs,
where the launch all but lost steerageway.</p>

<p>Mr. Bligh was silent during the night; his task was too exacting
to permit of speech. He must have suffered more than any of us, for
the movements required to steer the boat were too slight to warm
his blood. The moon, sinking ever lower ahead of us, shone full on
his face; his expression was calm and alert, though he could not
suppress a strong shuddering.</p>

<p>At last the moon went down on our larboard bow. The stars shone
with the cold light of an autumn evening at home. The waves roaring
about us broke in sheets of pale fire, so that at times I could
distinguish the faces of my companions in the eerie light.</p>

<p>Nelson and I had returned to the stern sheets after a long trick
with the bails. We were in the calm between two seas at the time.
Glancing over the side, I saw swift shapes of fire gliding back and
forth alongside the boat: a dozen, a score of them--darting ahead,
veering this way and that, disappearing under the boat. One of them
came to the surface within a yard of us, snorted loudly, and shot
ahead.</p>

<p>"Porpoises!" Nelson exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Aye," said the captain; "my mouth waters at the thought of a
porpoise steak, no matter how raw!"</p>

<p>Gripping the gunwales, we gazed over the side, thinking less of
the beauty of the phosphorescent tracks than of the abundance of
food so near at hand--food we were powerless to secure. The seas
overtook us with a regularity that lightened Bligh's task at the
tiller. He seemed not to feel the piercing chill of the air that
penetrated our drenched cloathes. The splendid performance of the
launch engaged his whole attention. Though trembling with cold, I
caught something of his own exhilaration as I watched the great
seas rearing their backs in the starlight and sweeping toward
us.</p>

<p>"How well she rides!" said Nelson, between chattering teeth.</p>

<p>"I watched her building," Bligh replied proudly; "I inspected
every strake and frame that went into her! A stancher boat was
never built! Were she decked and reasonably laden, I could take her
round the world."</p>

<p>When our turn came to bail once more, my legs were so benumbed
that I had difficulty in getting forward, and Nelson had to be
helped to his feet. The sky was turning gray when we were relieved
once more.</p>

<p>The captain ordered a teaspoonful of rum to be served out. This
revived us wonderfully, and we breakfasted on some bits of cooked
yams found in the bottom of the boat. The weather was abating,
although the sea would still have appalled a landsman, and the
rising sun warmed us sufficiently to give us the use of our
stiffened limbs.</p>

<p>By eight o'clock, when the boatswain hove the log, the wind had
moderated to a fresh breeze, and so little spray was coming aboard
that those forward were able to dry their cloathes. Captain Bligh
glanced down at the compass and beckoned to Elphinstone.</p>

<p>"Take the helm," he said. "Keep her W.N.W. We should raise the
land soon, unless the Indians are liars."</p>

<p>He flexed the muscles of his arm, stiffened by cold and his long
night's work, and went on, addressing us all: "We have come through
a bad night. In these latitudes, we may sail all the way to Timor
without again being so sorely tried. You have borne up well, my
lads, and we can depend upon the launch. My word for it! If we
husband our provisions as agreed upon, we shall all reach
home!"</p>

<p>"Never fear, sir," Cole ventured to remark. "We're with ye to a
man. And thank God for Captain Bligh to lead us--eh, lads?"</p>

<p>There was a hearty chorus from the people: "Aye!"</p>

<p>"Well spoken!"</p>

<p>"Ye can lay to that!"</p>

<p>As the morning advanced we sighted several flocks of birds,
hovering over shoals of fish--a sure indication of land. Once we
passed through the midst of a school of tunnies, leaping and
thrashing the sea into foam, yet none would seize our hook. We were
now keeping a sharp lookout, and a little before noon land was
discovered--a small flat island, bearing southwest, about four
leagues distant. Other islands appeared, and by three in the
afternoon we could count eight on the horizon, from south around
through the west to north.</p>

<p>"The Feejee Islands," said Mr. Bligh, who had been awakened from
a refreshing sleep by the first shout of "Land!"</p>

<p>"We are the first white men to set eyes on them!"</p>

<p>"Can't we land here, sir?" asked the carpenter.</p>

<p>"Spoken like a fool, Mr. Purcell," said Bligh bluntly. "You've a
short memory if you've so soon forgotten Tofoa! We could commit no
greater folly than to land here. Captain Cook never saw these
islands; but when I was master of the Resolution, in 1777, he
learned much of their inhabitants from the Friendly Islanders. They
are known to be fierce and treacherous, and eaters of human flesh.
No. We shall keep well clear of these fellows!"</p>

<h2><a name="c5" id="c5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p>Toward evening we raised three small islands to the northwest,
about seven leagues distant, passing them at nightfall, when we
snugged down to a reefed foresail. Had our circumstances been
happier, I might have enjoyed more fully .the emotion aroused by
sailing an unknown sea, studded with islands on which no European
had hitherto laid eyes.</p>

<p>Nelson was possessed of that most precious of gifts: an
inquiring and philosophical turn of mind. Even in our situation,
with not one chance in a thousand, as it seemed, of seeing England
again, he was able to derive pleasure from the contemplation of the
sea and the sky by day, and the stars by night. He regarded each
island we passed, no matter how distant, with an inquiring eye,
speculating as to whether it was of volcanic or of coralline
formation, whether it was inhabited, and what vegetation might
spring from its soil. When we passed shoals of fish, he named them,
and the birds diving and hovering overhead. And what little I know
of astronomy was learned from Nelson during the long nights on the
<i>Bounty's</i> launch.</p>

<p>Though the wind freshened after dark and kept us pretty wet
throughout the night, the sea was not rough and we managed to get a
little sleep by putting ourselves at watch and watch, half of us
sitting up, whilst the others stretched out in the boat's bottom. I
found it a great luxury to be able to extend my legs, and, although
shivering with cold, I slept for nearly three hours, and awoke much
refreshed. At daybreak, all hands seemed better than on the morning
before. We breakfasted on a quarter of a pint of water each and a
few bits of yam, the last of those we had found in the bottom of
the boat.</p>

<p>During the early hours of the morning the wind moderated, and
Mr. Bligh ordered the chest opened in order to examine the bread.
One of the sacks was well dried, and the bread which had been wet
on the first night was spread out in the sun. When it had been
thoroughly dried, we carefully sorted our entire supply, placing
all that was damaged or rotten in the sack, to prevent the rot from
infecting what was still good. This damaged bread was to be eaten
first.</p>

<p>After Captain Bligh had taken his observation at noon, he
informed us that our latitude was eighteen degrees, ten minutes,
south, and that, according to his reckoning, we had run ninety-four
miles in the twenty-four hours past. It was cloudy to the westward,
but Lebogue and Cole, old seamen both, believed that they could
discern high land in that direction, at a place where the clouds
seemed fixed.</p>

<p>We had been through so much since leaving the <i>Bounty</i> that
I had scarcely given a thought to what I ate; now, casting up the
total of what I had had in the seven days past, I perceived that
the whole of it was no more than a hungry man, in the midst of
plenty, would have eaten at a meal. Our scant rations had had their
effect--cheeks were pinched and eyes unnaturally hollow and bright.
There were no complaints of hunger as yet; the men were cheerful as
they drank their sups of water and ate their bits of damaged
bread.</p>

<p>It blew fresh from E.S.E. in the afternoon, and the sea began to
break over the transom and quarters once more, forcing us to bail.
Though choppy, the sea was flat, and old Lebogue stood on the bow
thwart, shading his eyes with his hand as he gazed ahead. Suddenly
he turned aft.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bligh!" he hailed in a subdued voice.</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"There's a monstrous great tortoise asleep, scarce two
cable-lengths ahead! Let me conn ye on to him, sir, and I'll snatch
his flipper! Many a one I've caught in the West Indies!"</p>

<p>Bligh nodded, with his eyes fixed on Lebogue. "Let no man make a
sound," he said.</p>

<p>We were running at about four knots, and since the boat would
almost certainly have filled had we turned broadside to the sea,
there was no time to prepare a noose or to consult as to the surest
method of capturing the tortoise. I knew that the slightest sound
of our feet on the boat's bottom, or knock against her sides, would
awaken the animal at once and send him away in alarm. Bligh was
alert at the tiller, steering in accordance with the movements of
Lebogue's arm. Not a word was spoken; we scarcely dared turn our
heads. Once, glancing out of the corner of my eyes as the stern was
lifted by a breaking wave, I caught a glimpse of the broad, arched
back of the sleeping tortoise, close ahead on our starboard bow.
Lebogue waved to starboard a little and then raised his arms as a
signal to hold the course. Next moment he stepped softly down from
the thwart and leaned far over the gunwale, whilst I heard the
animal's powerful thrashing in the sea.</p>

<p>The tortoise was immensely heavy and strong, but Lebogue was a
powerful man and determined not to let go. Before Smith or
Lenkletter could seize his legs,--before any of us, in fact, could
realize what was happening,--the tortoise had pulled him clean over
the gunwale and into the sea.</p>

<p>A shout went up. With an oath, Mr. Bligh pushed the tiller into
the master's hands and sprang to the side. "Hold me!" he shouted to
Elphinstone, as he plunged his arms into the sea, straining every
muscle to hold fast to Lebogue, whom he had seized by the collar of
his frock. Three of us heaved the man in over the stern. He thought
nothing of the wetting, but cursed his bad luck in not having
captured the tortoise. Bligh praised his tenacity, and blamed the
men seated near him for not holding fast to their mate.</p>

<p>"Had you acted promptly," he said, "instead of sitting there all
agape, we should have had a feast to-night, and a supply of meat
for many days!...Get forward, Lebogue...Samuel, give him a spoonful
of rum! He has earned it, by God!"</p>

<p>Warmed by his sup of spirit, Lebogue sat with Peckover and Cole,
lamenting his lack of success, and planning what to do should
another tortoise appear. "A monster," I heard him remark; "all of
two hundredweight! Hold fast to my legs if we raise another--I'll
never let go! Damn my eyes! To think of the grub we've lost! Did
'ee ever taste a bit of calipee?"</p>

<p>Bligh turned to Nelson. "Calipee!" he said, with a wry smile.
"Were you ever in the West Indies, Mr. Nelson?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"I was four years in that trade, in command of Mr. Campbell's
ship <i>Britannia</i>. By God, sir, those planters live like
princes! When at anchor I was frequently asked to dine ashore. They
used to disgust me with their stuffing and swilling of wine.
Sangaree and rum punch and Madeira till one marveled they could
hold it all. And the food! Pepper pot, turtle soup, turtle steaks,
grilled calipee; on my word, I've seen enough, at a dinner for six,
to feed us from here to Timor!"</p>

<p>Nelson smiled ruefully. "I could do with one of those dinners
tonight," he said.</p>

<p>"I feel no great hunger," said Bligh, "though I would gladly
have eaten a bit of raw steak."</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>A little before sunset the clouds broke, and we discovered land
ahead--two high, rocky islands, six or eight leagues distant. The
southerly island appeared of considerable extent and very high;
though the light was too dazzling to see clearly, I thought it
fertile and well wooded. Desiring to pass to windward of the
smaller island, we hauled our wind to steer N.W. by N. At ten
o'clock we were close in with the land, and could see many fires
ashore. It was too dark to see more than that the island was high
and rugged, and that it was inhabited; by midnight, much to our
relief, we had left it astern.</p>

<p>We were cold and miserable during this night, and welcomed the
exercise of bailing, but toward morning the wind moderated and the
sea went down. At daybreak, islands were in sight to the southwest,
and from northwest to north, with a broad passage, not less than
ten leagues wide, ahead of us. Our allowance for this day was a
quarter of a pint of coconut water and two ounces of the pulp for
each man. We now suffered thirst for the first time in the
launch.</p>

<p>The islands to the southwest and northwest, between which we
were steering, appeared larger than any we had seen in this sea.
Though many leagues distant, their foreshores seemed richly wooded,
and I thought I could perceive vast plains and far-off blue
mountain ranges in the interior.</p>

<p>By mid-afternoon we were well between the two great islands. The
wind now moderated to a gentle breeze from the east, and the sea
became as calm as it is within the reefs of Otaheite.</p>

<p>Nelson could not take his eyes off the island to the south. "I
would give five years of my life," he said regretfully, "for an
armed ship and leisure to explore this archipelago."</p>

<p>"And I!" remarked the captain. "Yon island would make ten of
Otaheite! And the land to the north seems larger still. 'Five'
years! I would give ten for a ship! No such group has yet been
discovered in this seal"</p>

<p>Before sunset, we were amazed, on looking over the side, to
perceive that we were sailing over a coral bank on which there was
less than a fathom of water. Had there been the least swell to
break on the shoal, we should have been aware of it long before and
sailed clear. Since there was nothing to fear save grounding, we
continued on our course, keeping a sharp lookout ahead. The launch
moved slowly, through water clear as air; I could see every detail
of the bottom. It was flat as a table, strewn with dead coral, and
barren of life, seeming to extend for about a mile on either side
of us. Twilight was giving way to dark when we came to the end of
the shoal, which dropped off abruptly into deep water, as do nearly
all of the coral banks in the South Sea. A rain squall, that came
on after dark, wet us to the skin and was over before we could
catch more than a gallon of water. Then a cold breeze, like the
night wind the people of Otaheite call <i>hup&eacute;</i> blew down
from the great valleys of the high land south of us. Though the sea
was calm, we passed a wretched night, after a dinner of an ounce of
damaged bread.</p>

<p>At daybreak our limbs were so cramped that some of the men could
scarcely move. Mr. Bligh issued a teaspoonful of rum and a quarter
of a pint of water, measured in his little horn cup. There was some
murmuring when the morsels of damaged bread were served out.
Purcell finished his bit at a single bite and a swallow, and sat
shivering glumly on the thwart.</p>

<p>"Can't we have a bit more, sir?" Lamb begged in a low voice, of
Fryer. "I'm perishin' with famine!"</p>

<p>"Aye!" put in Simpson. "I'd as soon be knocked on the head by
cannibals as die slow the like o' this."</p>

<p>Bligh's quick ear caught their words. "Who's that complaining up
forward?" he called. "Let them speak to me if they've anything to
say." There was an immediate silence in the bows.</p>

<p>"I wish to hear no more such talk," Bligh continued. "We'll
share alike in this boat, and no man shall fare better than his
mates. Mind you that, all of you!"</p>

<p>A fresh breeze was making up from the east. We set the mainsail
and were running at better than five knots when they hove the log.
Distant land of great extent was now visible to the south and west,
and a small island, round and high, was discovered to the north.
The great island we had left, which bore more the appearance of a
continent than an island, was still in sight.</p>

<p>We had pleasant sailing that day. The roll of the sea from east
to west seemed to be broken by the land behind us; though the
breeze filled our sails and drove us along bravely, we shipped
scarcely any water. I exchanged places with one of the men forward,
and stationed myself in the bows, where I could watch the flying
fish rising before the launch's cut-water.</p>

<p>These fish were innumerable in the waters of Feejee; I forgot my
hunger, and our well-nigh hopeless situation, in the pleasure of
watching them. The large solitary kind interested me most, for it
was their custom to wait until the boat was almost upon them before
taking flight. A few powerful strokes of the tail sent them to the
surface, along which they rushed at a great pace with the body
inclined upward and only the long lower lobe of the tail submerged.
When they had gained sufficient speed, the tail left the water with
a final strong fillip, while the fish skimmed away through the air,
steering this way and that as it pleased.</p>

<p>The sun was hot toward noon, and, like the others, I suffered
from thirst, thinking much of the quarter of a pint of water I was
soon to enjoy. As I was turning to go aft, a flying fish rose in a
frenzy within ten yards, just in time to escape some large pursuer.
There was a dash of spray and a blaze of gold and blue in the sea.
The flying fish sped off to starboard, while a swift cleaving of
the sea just beneath showed where the larger fish kept pace with
its flight. It fell at last. I saw a flurry of foam, and a broad
tail raised aloft for an instant.</p>

<p>The boatswain was on his feet. "Dolphin!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>We were in the midst of a small school of them; the sea was
ablaze with darting blue and gold.</p>

<p>Cole went aft eagerly. "I'll put a fresh bit of rag on the hook,
sir," he remarked to Mr. Bligh. He began to pull in the line as he
spoke, and when the hook came on board, he opened his clasp knife
and cut off the bit of dingy red rag which we had hoped for so long
a fish might seize.</p>

<p>"Try this," said the captain, taking a handkerchief of fine
linen from his pocket.</p>

<p>We watched eagerly while the boatswain tore the handkerchief
into strips and seized them on to the shank of the hook, so that
the ends would trail behind in the semblance of a small mullet or
cuttlefish. When all was ready, he paid out the line, jigging the
hook back and forth to attract the attention of the fish.</p>

<p>"Damn my eyes!" said Peckover in a low voice. "They've left
us!"</p>

<p>"No, there they are!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>A darting ripple appeared just behind the hook and sheered off.
Cole pulled the line back and forth with all his art. The long
dorsal fin of a dolphin clove the water like lightning behind the
hook. The line straightened.</p>

<p>"I've got him!" roared Cole, while every man in the boat shouted
at once.</p>

<p>The fish rushed this way and that, leaping like a salmon; but
Cole's brawny arms brought him in hand-over-hand.</p>

<p>"Take care!" shouted Bligh; "the hook's nearly out of his
mouth!" Cole shortened his grip on the line and hove the fish
aboard in one great swing. While still in the air, I saw the hook
fall free; next moment the fish struck the floor of the shallow
cockpit. Whilst Hallet, who sat closest, was in the act of falling
on the dolphin with outstretched arms, it doubled up like a bow,
gave a single powerful stroke of its tail on the floor, and flew
over the gunwale and into the sea.</p>

<p>Tears came to Hallet's eyes. Miserably disappointed as I was, I
could scarcely restrain a smile at the sight of Cole's face. Bligh
gave a short, mirthless laugh. Those of the men who had risen to
their feet to watch sat down in silence, and for a long time no one
spoke. Cole let out his line once more, but the fish had left us,
or paid no further attention to the hook.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon, we hauled our wind to pass to the
northward of the long, high island to the westward. It may have
been one island, or many overlapping one another; in any case, it
appeared of vast extent, stretching away so far to the southward
that the more distant mountain ridges were lost in a bluish haze.
The land was well wooded, and as we drew near I could distinguish
plantations of a lighter green, regularly laid out. We were obliged
to approach the land more closely than we desired, in order to pass
through a channel that divided it from a small islet to the
northeast.</p>

<p>When in the midst of this channel and no more than five miles
from the land,--here distinguished by some high rocks of fantastic
form,--we were alarmed to see two large canoes, sailing swiftly
alongshore, and evidently in pursuit of us. They were coming on
fast when the wind dropped suddenly, forcing us to take to our
oars. The savages must have done the same, for they continued to
gain on us for an hour or more. Then a black squall bore down from
the southeast, preceded by a fierce gust of wind. It may convey
some idea of the rain which fell during this squall when I say that
in less than ten minutes' time, with the poor means of catching
water at our disposal, we were able to replace what we had drunk
from the kegs, to fill all of our empty barricos, and even the
copper pot. While some of the people busied themselves with this
work, others were obliged to bail to keep the water down in the
bilges. The squall passed on, and a fresh breeze made up at E.S.E.
We hastened to get sail on the launch, for as the rain abated one
of the canoes was perceived less than two miles from us and coming
on fast. She had one mast and carried a long narrow lateen sail,
something like those of the large Friendly Island vessels we had
seen at Annamooka. Had the sea been rough she would have overtaken
us within an hour or two, but the launch footed it fast to the
northwest, with her mainsail loosed and drawing well. I felt pretty
certain, from the accounts I had heard, that if captured we should
probably be fattened for the slaughter, like so many geese.</p>

<p>As the afternoon drew on, the canoe gained on us. Most of the
people kept their eyes fixed on her anxiously, but Bligh, who was
at the tiller, striving to get the most out of his boat, maintained
an impassive face.</p>

<p>"They may wish to barter," he said lightly; "yet it is better to
chance no intercourse with them. If the wind holds, night will fall
before they can come up with us."</p>

<p>Nelson scarcely took his eyes off the canoe, though interest,
and not fear, aroused him. The Indian vessel was at this time
scarce a mile away.</p>

<p>"A double canoe," he remarked, "such as the Friendly Islanders
build. See the house on the platform between. I spent a day at sea
in such a vessel when I was with Captain Cook. They are manoeuvred
in a curious fashion; instead of tacking as we do, they wear
around."</p>

<p>"I wish they would treat us to an exhibition of their skill," I
replied.</p>

<p>"How many do you reckon are on board of her?"</p>

<p>"Thirty or forty, I should say."</p>

<p>Just before sundown, when the canoe had come up to about two
cable-lengths astern of us, it fell dead calm. The land at this
time bore S.S.W. about eight miles distant, with a long submerged
reef, on which the sea broke furiously, jutting out to the north.
We were not a mile from the extremity of this reef, with a strong
current setting us to the west.</p>

<p>"Down with the sails, lads!" Bligh commanded. "To the oars!"</p>

<p>There was no need to urge the men; the halyards were let go in a
twinkling, and the strongest amongst us--Lebogue, Lenkletter, Cole,
Purcell, Elphinstone, and the master--sprang to the oars and began
to pull with all their might.</p>

<p>The Indians had wasted no time. Instead of paddling, as I now
perceived, they sculled their vessel in a curious fashion, standing
upright on the platform between the two hulls, and plying long
narrow paddles not unlike our oars, which seemed to pass down
through holes in the floor. Only four men were at these sculls, but
they were frequently relieved by others and drove the heavy double
canoe, not less than fifty feet long, quite as fast as our six
could row the launch. There was now much clamour and shouting
amongst the savages, those not sculling gazing ahead at us
fiercely. One man, taller than the others, and with an immense
shock of hair, stood on the forward end of the platform, shouting
and brandishing a great club in a kind of dance. His gestures and
the tones of his voice left no doubt as to their intentions.</p>

<p>Our oarsmen pulled their best, for every man in the boat felt
pretty certain that it was a case of row for our lives.</p>

<p>At the end of half an hour, Mr. Bligh perceived that the master,
a man in middle age, was weakening. He made a sign to Peckover to
relieve him, and the gunner took the oar without missing a stroke.
The sun went down over the empty ocean on our larboard bow, and the
brief twilight of the tropics set in. The Indians were still
gaining.</p>

<p>Working furiously at their sculls, they were driving their
vessel closer and closer to the launch. When twilight gave place to
dusk, they were not more than a cable-length astern. The tall
savage, whom I took to be their chief, now dropped his club and
strung a bow brought forward to him. Fitting an arrow to the
string, he let fly at us, and continued his practice for ten
minutes or more. Some of the arrows struck the water uncomfortably
close to the boat. One fell just ahead of us and floated past the
side; it was nearly four feet long, made of a stiff reed, and
pointed with four or five truly horrible barbs, designed to break
off in the wound.</p>

<p>As I glanced down at this arrow, barely visible in the dusk, I
heard an exclamation from Nelson, sitting next to me, and turned my
head. The moon was at the full, and it was rising directly behind
the Feejee canoe, throwing into relief the black figures of the
savages, some sculling with furious efforts, others prancing about
on her deck as they shouted like a pack of devils.</p>

<p>Then, for no reason we could make out, unless he acted in
accordance with some superstition concerning the moon, the chief
turned to shout unintelligible words to his followers. The scullers
ceased their efforts and began to row slowly and steadily; the
canoe bore off, turned in a wide circle, and headed back toward the
land. Ten minutes later we were alone on a vast, empty, moonlit
sea.</p>

<h2><a name="c6" id="c6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p>On the morning of May the eighth, I awoke from a doze to find
the sun half an hour high and rising in a cloudless sky. A more
blessed sight could scarcely be imagined, for we had been drenched
to the skin the whole of the latter part of the night. Nelson, who
was beside me, was already awake, and motioned me to silence,
nodding toward Captain Bligh, who was sleeping with his legs
doubled under him on the floor in the stern sheets, his head
pillowed on one arm, which rested on the seat. Fryer was at the
tiller, with Peckover beside him, and Cole and Lenkletter sat
forward by the mast. All the others were asleep. A gentle breeze
blew; the launch was slipping quietly along, and before us
stretched a great solitude of waters that seemed never to have
known a storm.</p>

<p>Not a word was spoken. We basked in the delicious warmth, and we
could see the huddled forms around us relax as they soaked it up in
their sleep. Captain Bligh was having his first undisturbed rest
since we had left Tofoa, and we were all desirous that he should
have the full good of it. His cloathing was as bedraggled as ours,
and his cheeks were covered with a ten days' growth of beard; but
although his face was pale and drawn, it lacked the expression of
misery which was becoming only too apparent upon the faces of the
others.</p>

<p>Nelson whispered to me: "Ledward, merely to look at him makes me
believe in Timor." I well understood what he meant. Waking or
asleep, there was that about Bligh which inspired confidence. Had
we been astride a log with him, instead of in the launch, I think
we might still have believed in Timor.</p>

<p>He slept for the better part of three hours, and, by the time he
awoke, most of the others were stirring, enjoying the precious
warmth of the sun, but taking good care to say nothing of our luck.
Even Nelson and I were seamen enough to know that the matter should
not be spoken of: that to praise good weather is to tempt it to
depart. As soon as we were thoroughly warmed and had dried our
clothing, we set to work cleaning the boat and stowing our
possessions away in better order than we had been able to do thus
far.</p>

<p>Captain Bligh took the occasion to provide himself with a pair
of scales for weighing our food. Thus far, our daily ration had
been measured by guess, but a more exact method was necessary, both
to prevent the grumbling of those who thought they had received an
amount smaller than their share, and also to ensure that our food
should see us through. Two or three pistol balls had been
discovered under the battens in the bottom of the boat. The weight
of these balls was twenty-five to the pound, and after a careful
estimate of our entire amount of provisions, Bligh decided that
each man's portion of bread at a meal should be equal to the weight
of one ball. For scales the half shells of coconuts were used,
carefully balanced against each other at the ends of a slender bar
of wood to which a cord was attached, a little off the centre, as
one of the coconut shells was a trifle heavier than the other. The
carpenter made the scales, which served our purpose admirably, but
it was a woeful sight to all to see how little of the bread was
needed to balance the pistol ball. Our allowance of food was now
fixed at one twenty-fifth of a pound of bread and a quarter of a
pint of water per man, to be served at eight in the morning, at
noon, and at sunset. What remained of the salt pork was saved for
occasions when we should be in need of a more substantial repast.
We still had several coconuts, and, while they lasted, used the
meat of these in place of bread, and the liquid in the nuts instead
of water; but, as I remember it, we ate the last of them on the
tenth of May.</p>

<p>The method of serving our food was this: A portion of bread, of
an amount about sufficient for the company, was taken from the
chest and handed back in a cloth to Captain Bligh, who usually
weighed out the eighteen rations, and they were then passed along
from hand to hand. The water, which was stored amidships, was
measured, usually by Fryer or Nelson or myself, while Mr. Bligh was
weighing the bread, the cup used being a small horn
drinking-vessel; and the water was then poured into one of the
wineglasses, and handed to the men as they received their bread. It
was curious to see the manner in which they accepted and dispatched
their food. It was "dispatch" indeed, with most of them; their meal
would be finished in an instant.</p>

<p>Purcell was among this number. No matter how miserable I might
be, I found relief in watching him receive his tiny morsel. It was
always with the same expression of amazement and injury. He would
hold the bread in the palm of his huge hand for a few seconds,
peering at it from under his shaggy eyebrows as though not quite
certain it was there. Then he would clap it into his mouth with an
expression of disgust still more comical, and roll up his eyes as
though asking heaven to witness that he had not received his due
allowance.</p>

<p>Some followed Mr. Bligh's example. He soaked his bread in a
coconut shell, in his allowance of water, and then ate it very
slowly so that he had the illusion, at least, of having enjoyed a
meal.</p>

<p>Samuel, Bligh's clerk, followed a practice that did, in fact,
provide him with what might be called the ghost of a meal. With the
exception of his breakfast allowance of water, he would save his
food and drink until the evening, when he had it all at once. This
was, of course, a legitimate privilege, but I think Samuel's reason
for exercising it was that he wished to gloat over his food while
some of his near companions looked hungrily on. I must give him
credit for his self-restraint; but in Samuel it did not, somehow,
appear to advantage. I can still hear old Purcell's exasperated
voice: "Damn your eyes, Samuel! Don't lick your chops over it! Eat
and be done with it like the rest of us!"</p>

<p>Cole never failed to say grace before he partook of his food,
however tiny the amount. His little prayer, delivered in a low
voice, was audible to those who sat next him in the boat. I heard
it, many's the time; and it was always the same: "Our Heavenly
Father: We thank Thee for Thy ever-loving care, and for these Thy
bounties to the children of men."</p>

<p>One might easily have imagined, from the simple, earnest manner
of the old fellow, that he had just sat down to a table spread with
all the good things of life, and that he considered such largess
far beyond his deserts.</p>

<p>The afternoon continued fine, with the same gentle breeze,
carrying us smoothly in the direction we would go. At midday Bligh
took our position. By our log we had sailed sixty-two miles since
noon of the seventh, the smallest day's run we had yet made; but we
were content that it should be so, for we had comfort from the
sun's warmth and rest from the weary work of bailing.</p>

<p>We had sailed five hundred miles from Tofoa, nearly one-seventh
of the distance to Timor; an average better than eighty miles per
day. That number, somehow, encouraged us; we made much of it,
passed it about in talk. Five hundred miles seemed a vast distance;
but we were careful to avoid speaking of the more than three
thousand miles that lay ahead.</p>

<p>On this day Mr. Bligh performed an act of heroism in having
himself shaved by Smith, his servant. There was neither soap nor
water to soften his beard. He sat on the floor in the stern sheets,
his head held between Peckover's knees, while Smith crouched beside
him cutting through the dry hair, stopping every moment to strop
his razor. The task required the better part of an hour; and none
of us, seeing Bligh's sufferings, was tempted to follow his
example.</p>

<p>"By God, Smith!" he said when the ordeal was over. "I would run
the gantlet of all the savages in the South Sea rather than go
through this again. Were you ever shaved by the Indians, Mr.
Nelson?"</p>

<p>"Once," Nelson replied. "Captain Cook and I both made the
experiment on the island of Leefooga. The native made use of two
shells, taking the hairs of the beard between them. It was a
tedious task, but not so painful as I had imagined it would
be."</p>

<p>Bligh nodded. "I've tried it myself; and I've heard that an
Indian mother can shave her child's head with a shark's tooth on a
stick, and make as close work of it as a man could do with a razor.
But I'll believe that only when I've seen it done."</p>

<p>"They've great skill, the Indians," said Peckover; "but my
choice is for our own way. I'd be pleased to be sitting this minute
in the chair of the worst hairdresser in Portsmouth. I'd call it
heaven, though he shaved me with a wood rasp."</p>

<p>"You'll see Portsmouth again, Mr. Peckover; never doubt it,"
said Bligh quietly.</p>

<p>A deep silence followed this statement. The men looked toward
him, a pathetic, wistful eagerness apparent on every face. All
wished to believe; and yet the chances against us seemed
overwhelming. But there was no shadow of uncertainty in Bligh's
voice or manner. He spoke with a confidence that cheered us
all.</p>

<p>"And another thing we will see there," he went on: "Fletcher
Christian hanging by the neck from a yardarm on one of His
Majesty's ships, and every bloody pirate that joined him."</p>

<p>"It will be a long day, Mr. Bligh, before we have that
satisfaction, if we ever do," Purcell replied.</p>

<p>"Long?" Bligh replied. "The arm of His Majesty's law is long,
mind you that! Let them hide as they may, it can reach and take
them by the neck. Mr. Nelson, where do you think they will go? I
have my own opinion, but I should like yours."</p>

<p>This was the first time since we had lost the ship that Mr.
Bligh had made more than a passing blasphemous reference to the
mutineers, or would suffer any of us to speak of them.</p>

<p>"I can tell you where I think most of them will wish to go,"
Nelson replied: "back to Otaheite."</p>

<p>"So I think," said Bligh. "May God make them bloody fools enough
to do it!"</p>

<p>"As they cast off the launch, sir, I plainly heard some of them
shout 'Huzza for Otaheite!'" Elphinstone put in. "There was much
noise at the time, but I couldn't have been mistaken."</p>

<p>"Whatever the others may decide to do," said Nelson, "there is
one too wise to stop there long: Mr. Christian."</p>

<p>Bligh started as though he had been struck in the face. He
glanced darkly at Nelson, his eyes blazing with suppressed
anger.</p>

<p>"Mr. Nelson," he said; "let me never again hear a title of
courtesy attached to that scoundrel's name!"</p>

<p>"I am sorry," Nelson replied quietly.</p>

<p>"Say no more," said Bligh. "It was a slip, that I know; but I
could not suffer it to pass in silence...I agree with what you say
of him. He is too wily a villain to remain in a place where he
knows he will be searched for. But you will see: the others will
not follow him; and we shall have them, like that!" He opened his
hand, closing it slowly and tightly as though he already had their
several throats within his clutch.</p>

<p>"Aye," said Purcell sourly. "And the leader of 'em will go free.
He'll never be found."</p>

<p>"Say you so?" Bligh replied with a harsh laugh. "You should know
me better than that, Mr. Purcell. I pray I may be sent in search of
him! There's not an island in the Pacific, charted or not, where he
can escape me! No, by God! Not a sandy cay in the midst of
desolation where I cannot track him down! And well he knows
it!"</p>

<p>"Where do you think he might go, sir?" asked Fryer.</p>

<p>"We will speak no more of this matter, Mr. Fryer," Bligh
replied, and there was an end to any discussion of the mutineers
for many a day. Bligh felt keenly the humiliation of losing his
ship, and although he rarely mentioned the <i>Bounty</i>, well we
knew that the thought of her was always present in his mind.</p>

<p>That same afternoon he gave us an account of what he knew of the
coastal lands of New Holland and New Guinea.</p>

<p>"This information is for you in particular, Mr. Fryer, and for
Mr. Elphinstone," he said. "Should anything happen to me it will
devolve upon you to navigate those waters, and you must know what I
can tell you of the course to follow. That ocean is but little
known; my knowledge of it I had from Captain Cook, when I was
master of the Resolution, on his third voyage. Our task then was
largely concerned with exploration in the Northern Hemisphere; but
we had much time on our hands at sea, and Captain Cook was kind
enough to inform his officers of his earlier explorations in the
western Pacific, and of his passage through what he named
'Endeavour Straits.' I listened with interest, but I little thought
I should ever have use for the information he gave us. Which only
goes to show, young man," he added, turning to Hayward, "that
knowledge of the sea never comes amiss to a seaman. Remember that.
You never know when you may have occasion to use it."</p>

<p>"Is there any other passage between those lands save by
Endeavour Straits?" Elphinstone asked.</p>

<p>"There may be," Bligh replied; "but if so, I've never heard of
it. I need not go into the details of my recollection of the
position as given by Captain Cook. You will find this marked on the
rough chart I made from memory whilst we were in the cave at Tofoa.
It is in my journal. That chart is all you will have to go by in
steering through what Captain Cook considered the worst area of
reef-infested ocean in the whole of the Pacific. This is the
important thing to bear in mind now: Whether we will or no, with
strong winds and a heavy sea we must run before them, very likely,
farther to the north than we wish to go. Therefore, in case you are
driven north of the twelfth parallel, take every opportunity to get
to the south'ard, so that you may strike the great reef along the
coast of New Holland in the region of thirteen south. It is
thereabout, as I recall it, that Captain Cook found the passage
which he named 'Providential Channel.' If you can strike it, you
can coast to the north'ard with a fair wind, in tolerably quiet
waters, till you round the northern cape of New Holland and pass
through Endeavour Straits. You shall then have open sailing all the
way to Timor."</p>

<p>"We shan't forget, sir," Fryer replied; "but God forbid that you
should not be the one to see us through!"</p>

<p>"God will forbid it, I believe," said Bligh, gravely; "but in
our situation it is best to provide for every possible mishap."</p>

<p>"Will there be islands, sir, inside the reef at New Holland,
where we can go ashore?" Hayward asked.</p>

<p>"I have a clear recollection of Captain Cook speaking of various
small lands scattered over the lagoons," Bligh replied. "He found
none that were inhabited, as I remember, although he believed they
were resorted to at times by the savages. We shall certainly stop
at some of them to refresh ourselves."</p>

<p>"How far will New Holland be from where we are, sir?" Hallet
asked.</p>

<p>"We will not speak of that, my lad," said Bligh in a kindly
voice. "Think if you like of the distance we have come, but never
let your mind run forward faster than your vessel. Lebogue is an
old seaman. Ask him if that is good advice."</p>

<p>"Aye, sir, the very best," said Lebogue, nodding his shaggy
head. "It's the only way for a quick passage, Mr. Hallet."</p>

<p>We fell silent again, watching Lebogue, who sat at our solitary
fishing line, which he had kept in the water nearly all the way
from Tofoa. We had no bait to spare, and Lebogue and the boatswain
had tried every conceivable kind of lure that our means afforded.
He was now using one made of the brass handle of a clasp knife and
some bits of red cloth torn from a handkerchief. It trailed after
the launch at a distance of forty or fifty yards, and was sometimes
drawn closer that we might better observe it. There had been
moments of breathless expectation when some fish of splendid size
would rush toward it; but they invariably recognized it as
belonging to nothing in nature, and sheered away. It was maddening
to see fish around us--often great multitudes--and never to be able
to catch one. But Cole and Lebogue were ever hopeful. They were
continually changing the lure; but the result was always the same.
On several occasions schools of small mulletlike fish had hovered
alongside of us for a few moments. Had we been possessed of a hoop
net we could, unquestionably, have caught some of them, they were
in such quantities, but the attempt to seine them up with our few
remaining hats had not been successful. For all our bitter
disappointments, both the fish and the occasional sea birds we met
with proved a boon to us. Attempts to catch them occupied our
minds. Our bellies, however, felt differently about the matter, and
would never agree that our unavailing attempts did more than add
insult to injury.</p>

<p>We now had both sails up; they were drawing well, and the sea
was so calm that we shipped no water. The sun went down, as it had
risen, in a cloudless sky, and darkness came on swiftly. Presently
the moon rose, flooding the lonely sea with a glory that
transfigured our little boat and everyone in her. Purcell, with his
dirty rags wound round his broken head, sat by the mast amidships,
facing aft. He looked a noble, even an heroic figure, in that
light. On the day of the mutiny, as we were rowing away from the
<i>Bounty</i>, I wondered how long one small boat would hold two
such men as Captain Bligh and himself before they would be at each
other's throats. There had long been a feud between them on the
ship. Purcell had a high opinion of his ability as a carpenter, and
considered himself a monarch in his own department. He was as
bullheaded as Bligh himself, but he had the good sense to know his
place and to realize that the captain of a ship was, after all, in
a position of higher authority than the carpenter. Secretly, as I
knew, he gloried in the fact that Bligh had lost his ship, and
considered it a just punishment for his tyrannical behaviour; and
yet there was no man more loyal to his commander. On the morning of
the mutiny there had not been a moment's hesitation in deciding
where his duty lay. In the launch it interested me to observe his
attitude toward Bligh, and Bligh's toward him. They hated each
other; but, in Purcell's case at least, hatred was tempered by
respect.</p>

<p>What a contrast the carpenter made to young Tinkler, who sat
beside him! He loved this lad as much as he hated Bligh, and being
an old seaman he invariably showed him great respect because of his
rank as midshipman, never omitting to address him as "Mr. Tinkler."
And Tinkler was worthy of respect as well as of affection. He was a
plucky lad. There was never a time, no matter how desperate our
situation, when he did not play his part like a man.</p>

<p>That night was the only one we had passed in any measure of
comfort since leaving Tofoa. Our cramped positions were no
pleasanter than they had been, but the boat, as well as our
cloathing, was dry, and we were able to have some hours of
refreshing sleep.</p>

<p>The ninth of May was just such a day as the eighth had been,
with a calm sea and a light breeze from the east-southeast. Bligh
had everyone roused at dawn, and as soon as we had worked a little
of the stiffness out of our limbs, he set Cole to work, with some
of us for helpers, in fitting a pair of shrouds for each mast.
Others assisted the carpenter, who was employed in putting a
weather cloth, made of some of our spare canvas, around the boat.
The quarters were raised nine inches by means of the stern seats
which were nailed to cleats along them, and the weather cloth was
of the same width, so that, when the task was finished, the boat
was as well prepared for rough weather as we could make her. This
was the carpenter's day, and he made the most of it; and I will do
him the justice to say that he did a thoroughly workmanlike
job.</p>

<p>I was glad to hear Mr. Bligh remark: "That will do very well,
carpenter."</p>

<p>It was high praise, coming from him; but Purcell would not have
been Purcell had he not replied: "Begging your pardon, sir, it
won't do well, but I can make no better with what we've got
here."</p>

<p>At noon, on the ninth, we were sixty-four miles farther on our
way. All of this day we saw neither fish nor bird.</p>

<p>Toward the middle of the afternoon, Nelson broke a silence that
seemed to have lasted for hours. "I am constrained to speak, Mr.
Bligh," he said, with a faint smile. "This sea is so vast and so
quiet that I am inclined to doubt its reality and our own as
well."</p>

<p>"That's a strange fancy, sir," Bligh replied; "but the sea is
real enough; I can promise you that."</p>

<h2><a name="c7" id="c7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p>I remember Captain Bligh saying to Fryer, about noon on May the
twelfth: "I think we've seen the worst of it."</p>

<p>"I am sure of it, sir," Fryer replied, but he believed no more
than Bligh in the truth of the statement. It had fallen calm about
half an hour before, but the sea, as viewed from the launch, was an
awe-inspiring sight. Fryer had just relieved Bligh at the tiller,
which he had held continuously for eighteen hours.</p>

<p>Our shrouds for the masts and the canvas weather cloth had been
fitted none too soon; on the evening of that same day,--May the
ninth,--at about nine o'clock, wind and rain had struck us
together, and all through the night four men were continuously
bailing, and there were times when every man of us save Bligh was
so employed. The sky was concealed by low gray clouds scudding
before the wind. So it remained all day and all night of the tenth,
the eleventh, and till near midday of the twelfth; and now,
although the wind had fallen, the sky was an ominous sight.</p>

<p>There was no break in the clouds, no signs of a lightening at
any point in the heavy canopy that overhung us, so low that it
seemed almost within reach. Nevertheless, it was calm, for the
moment, at least, and the sky withheld its rain. Our sail was
dropped into the boat.</p>

<p>"I want two men at the oars," Bligh said.</p>

<p>"I'll make one, sir," Lenkletter called out, and a dozen others
at the same time. All were eager for a chance to warm their
benumbed bodies. Lenkletter and Lebogue were first chosen, but
there were reliefs every quarter of an hour so that the rest of us
might enjoy the benefit of the exercise.</p>

<p>"Don't exert yourselves, men," said Bligh; "merely keep her
stern to the swell."</p>

<p>The boat had never seemed so small to me as she did then, and I
could imagine what a speck she would have appeared in that vast
ocean could one have observed her with a sea bird's eye. The long
swell, coming from the southeast, was of a prodigious height, but
without the wind there was no menace in it. The seas moved toward
us, rank after rank, with a solemnity, a majesty, that filled the
heart with awe; cold and wretched though we were, we had a kind of
solemn pleasure in watching them: seeing our little boat lifted
high on their broad backs, to find ourselves immediately after in a
great valley between them.</p>

<p>As a recompense for our sufferings, Captain Bligh issued an
allowance of rum, two teaspoonfuls for each man; and for our dinner
that day we had half an ounce of pork each, in addition to the
bread. This made our midday meal seem a veritable feast, and the
rum gave us a little warmth. It was the cold that we dreaded at
this time, fully as much as the sea; the wind, penetrating
cloathing perpetually drenched with rain, felt bitterly chill, as
though it were blowing from fields of ice. Thanks to Captain Bligh,
we now adopted a means of combating it that proved of inestimable
service. He advised us to wring out our cloathing in sea water. It
is strange that none of us had thought of this simple expedient
before, but the fact remains that we had not. The moment we tried
it we found ourselves wonderfully comfortable in comparison with
our miserable plight before, the reason being that salt water does
not evaporate in the wind so fast as fresh.</p>

<p>We passed the next two or three hours tolerably well; what
between taking our turns at the oars and wringing out our cloathes
from time to time, we broke the back of the afternoon, each man
secretly watching all the while for any change that would give us
reason to hope that better weather was in store; but the only
change was that the dull light became duller yet, as the day wore
on toward evening. And still there was no wind.</p>

<p>The silence made us uneasy. Our ears had been accustomed to the
deep roar of the wind and the seething hiss of breaking seas. God
knows, we wanted no more of such weather, but we did crave wind
enough to carry us on our way. The great swells went under us
noiselessly; the only sounds to be heard were the small human
sounds within the boat--a spoken word, a cough, a weary sigh as
someone shifted his position.</p>

<p>It must have been toward four o'clock in the afternoon that
there was mingled with the vast quiet what was, at first, the very
ghost of sound--and yet every man of us heard it. Elphinstone, who
was lying in the bottom of the boat just before me, raised his head
to look round. "What is that?" he said.</p>

<p>There was no need to reply. As we rose to the swell, every head
was turned to the eastward; and there, not half a mile distant, we
again saw approaching our remorseless enemy--rain.</p>

<p>It came on in what appeared to be a solid wall of blackness,
faintly lighted by a dull grayish glow from the sky before it.
There was no wind immediately behind; the slowness of its approach
assured us of that; therefore, we waited in silence, while the
sound increased and spread, now deadened as we fell into the
trough, more loud as we rose to the crest of the next wave. Then,
as though at the last moment it had leaped to make sure of us, we
were in the midst of it--drenched, half drowned, gasping for
breath, in a deluge such as we had never before experienced.</p>

<p>In an instant I lost sight of the men in the forward part of the
boat. This, I know, will scarcely be believed by those whose
experience of rain has been only in the northern latitudes, who
know nothing of the enormous weight of water released in a tropical
cloudburst. The fact remains that the launch vanished from my sight
save for the after part of it where I sat, and the men immediately
before my eyes were but shadows blurred by sheets of almost solid
water. I heard Captain Bligh's voice, faintly, above the hiss and
thunder of the deluge. The words were indistinguishable, but we
well knew what we had to do. We bailed with the desperation of men
who feel the water gaining upon them even as they bail; who feel it
cover their feet and rise slowly toward their knees. And it was not
sea water that we threw over the side. It was the pure sweet water
of clouds, which men, adrift in a small boat in mid-ocean, so often
pray for in vain, with blackening lips and swelling tongues; and we
hurled it away from us with bailing scoops, coconut shells, the
copper pot, with our hats, with our cupped hands, lest this
precious fluid, which Captain Bligh had, rightly, doled out to us a
quarter of a pint at a time, should be our death. There was irony
in the situation, though we had no time to think of it then.</p>

<p>The darkness in the midst of the storm was almost that of night,
but presently I could once more see the outlines of the boat and
the forms of the men, and knew that the worst was over. We were a
forlorn-looking crew: the water streamed from our cloathing, which
was plastered against our bodies; from our hair and beards; and we
were again chilled to the bone.</p>

<p>Mr. Bligh's voice sounded unusually loud against the ensuing
silence. "Look alive, lads! Mr. Cole, close-reef the foresail, and
get it on her. There'll be wind behind this."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," the boatswain called back. The rest of us, with
the exception of the men at the oars, continued bailing, for there
was a deal of water yet to be got rid of.</p>

<p>Lebogue was working beside me. "Aye," he muttered, at Bligh's
remark about wind; "we've summ'at to come, I'll be bound."</p>

<p>We bailed her dry, and then had time, for a few moments, to know
how cold we were. "Wring out your cloathes," said Bligh. We were
not slow to obey, and the men nearest Lamb and Simpson performed
this service for them, as they were too weak to do it for
themselves. Meanwhile the foresail had been double-reefed and
hoisted, Bligh again took the tiller, and we waited for the
wind.</p>

<p>We saw it coming from afar. The oily swells, that had been
smooth enough to reflect the gray light, were blackened under it.
We saw it leaping from summit to summit; but whilst it came
swiftly, there was no great weight of air at first. Our tiny bit of
sail, heavy and dark with rain, bellied out, and the launch
gathered steerageway once more. The dull light faded from the sky,
and soon what was left of it seemed to be gathered on the surface
of the sea, again streaked with foam and flying spray. Harder and
harder it blew. No watch was set for the night. We well knew there
was work and to spare at hand for all of us.</p>

<p>Nelson touched my arm and pointed overhead. A man-of-war bird,
its great wings outspread, wheeled into the wind and hovered over
us for a few seconds, seeming to stand motionless against that
mighty stream as it looked down at us. Of a sudden it tipped,
scudded away, and was lost to view.</p>

<p>Fryer was seated by Mr. Bligh, watching the following seas.
"Stand by to bail!" he shouted.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>I cannot recall the thirty-six hours that followed without
experiencing something of the horror I felt at the time. Wind and
rain, rain and wind, under a sky that held no promise of relief.
Bad as the hours of daylight were, those of darkness were
infinitely worse, for we could see nothing. It seemed a miracle to
me that Mr. Bligh was able to keep the launch before the seas, the
more so because the wind veered considerably at times, and he could
not depend upon the feel of it at his back to tell him how the
waves were approaching. He was helped to some extent by Fryer and
Elphinstone, who crouched on their knees beside him, facing aft,
peering into the darkness; but with the clouds of spray continually
in their faces, they could see little or nothing until a sea was on
the point of boarding us.</p>

<p>Never, I think, could the gray dawn have been welcomed more
devoutly than it was by us on the morning of May the fourteenth;
and, as though in pity of our plight, the wind abated shortly
after. There was even a watery gleam of light as the sun rose, but
our hopes and prayers for blue sky were unavailing. Nevertheless,
the clouds were higher and the look of them less menacing than they
had been for four days past.</p>

<p>As I looked into the faces about me I realized how frightful my
own must appear. Lamb, the butcher, and George Simpson, the
quartermaster's mate, appeared to be at the last extremity. They
lay in the bottom of the boat, unable to do aught for themselves;
throughout the night just past, the water we shipped continually
had been washing around them, and it was as much as they could do
at times to raise their heads above it. Nelson, too, was a pitiable
sight. Never a strong man, the privations and hardships we had
undergone had worn him down, but the spirit within the frail body
was as tough as that of Captain Bligh himself. Never a groan or a
word of complaint came from Nelson. Weak as he was, physically, he
was a tower of strength in our company. The men who showed the
fewest signs of suffering thus far were Purcell, Cole, Peckover,
Lenkletter, Elphinstone, and the three midshipmen. Captain Bligh
and the master, who had borne the brunt of our battle against the
sea, were gaunt and hollow-eyed, but Bligh seemed to have an
inexhaustible reserve of energy to draw upon. I must not omit to
speak of Samuel, Bligh's clerk, who I had thought would be among
the first to show the effects of hardship. He was city born and
bred, with the pale complexion and the soft-appearing body usually
found among men of sedentary occupations; nevertheless, he had
borne up amazingly well, both in body and spirit. He was a man
wholly lacking in imagination, and his belief in Captain Bligh was
like that of a dog in its master. He could not, I am sure, conceive
of any situation, however perilous, which Bligh was not more than
equal to. I envied him this confident trust, particularly at night.
Tinkler and Hayward were sturdily built lads, and youth gave them a
great advantage over some of the rest of us. Hallet lacked their
toughness of fibre, but for all that he played his part like a man,
and deserved the more credit in that he was compelled to fight
constantly against his terror of the sea. He was not the only one
with this fear at his heart. I admit freely that my spirits were
often far sunk because of it, although I did my best to conceal the
fact.</p>

<p>There had been times, at night, when no man of us, unless it
were Samuel,--no, not even Captain Bligh himself,--could have
believed that we should see another dawn. The fact that we had
survived the nights of the thirteenth and fourteenth gave us new
courage. We knew, now, what our boat could do.</p>

<p>We were on a course, N.W. by W. Of a sudden the gray sky to the
southwest lightened, and a few moments later there was a break in
the clouds. We had all around us, as we thought, nothing but empty
sea; but presently we saw, or thought we saw, pale-blue mountains
that seemed to be floating high in air. Tinkler was the first to
spy them, and before some of us could raise our heads to look, they
had again vanished in the mists. Those who had not seen could not
believe in the reality of the vision, but an hour later, there it
was again; and this time there was no doubt in anyone's mind.
Clouds of dense vapour lifted slowly, revealing a land of lofty
mountains that stood in cold blue silhouette against the gray sky.
At first we thought it one island; but as we approached we found
there were four, which bore S.W. to N.W. by W., and distant about
six leagues. The largest was, in Captain Bligh's judgment, about
twenty leagues in circuit.</p>

<p>We altered our course to pass a little to eastward of the most
northerly one. Bligh had only his recollection to serve him, but he
believed them a part of the New Hebrides, which Captain Cook had
named and explored during his second expedition to the South Sea,
in 1774. All through the morning we were sailing at about two
knots. The sea was now so calm that but two men were required at
the bailing scoops. The rest of us feasted our eyes upon the land.
Many an anxious and appealing glance was thrown in Captain Bligh's
direction, but he gave no hint as to what his plan was. By the
middle of the afternoon we had left the larger islands well astern,
and were no more than two leagues distant from the northerly one.
The wind was again blowing fresh, and our course was altered to
approach still closer. We could see the smoke of many fires rising
from the foreshore; the thought of their warmth increased our
misery.</p>

<p>The land was of a horseshoe shape. A ridge of high mountains,
falling steeply to the sea, enclosed a large bay with a
northeasterly exposure. We passed the entrance to this bay not more
than two miles off. In about half an hour we had rounded the
northern cape, and were well in the lee.</p>

<p>No word had been spoken during this time. We waited with deep
anxiety to learn what Captain Bligh's intentions were.</p>

<p>"Trim the sails," he ordered.</p>

<p>We headed up, approaching to within a quarter of a mile of a
small cove that resembled, in a general way, the one at Tofoa; but
here there was a smooth sandy beach instead of a rocky one, and the
vegetation was of, the richest green; indeed, the island seemed a
paradise to our famished, sea-weary eyes. The sail was dropped and
two men were set at the oars to keep us off the land.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Purcell," said Bligh, "we will repair our weather
cloth. Look alive, for I wish to lose no more time here than is
necessary."</p>

<p>Our weather cloth had been much damaged by the sea the night
before.</p>

<p>A deep silence followed this order. Purcell remained where he
was. Presently he raised his head, sullenly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bligh," he said, "if you mean to go on from here without
giving us a chance to refresh ourselves, I'm opposed; and there's
more that feels as I do."</p>

<p>For all the stiffness in his legs, Bligh got to his feet in an
instant. His lips were drawn in a thin line and his eyes were
blazing with anger, but as he looked at the forlorn figures before
him the expression on his face softened and he checked himself.</p>

<p>"There are more?" he asked quietly. "Who are they? Let them
speak up."</p>

<p>"I'm one, sir," Elphinstone replied in a hollow voice; "and I'll
ask you to believe I'm speaking for others more than myself."</p>

<p>"We are in a pitiful state, sir," Fryer put in. "A night of rest
on shore might be the means of preserving the lives of some of us.
There's sure to be food on so rich an island."</p>

<p>"There's coconut trees, sir," Lenkletter put in eagerly. "Look
yonder, halfway up the slope."</p>

<p>A clump of coconut palms could, in fact, be seen, raising their
plumed tops above the forests that covered the steep hillsides.
Bligh looked from us to the land, and back again; presently he
shook his head.</p>

<p>"Lads, we dare not risk it," he said. "You cannot suppose that I
do not feel for your sufferings, since I share them with you. God
knows I should be glad to rest here; but the danger is too great.
We must not!"</p>

<p>"There's no Indians here, sir," said Purcell. "That's plain to
be seen."</p>

<p>Bligh controlled himself with difficulty. "At the moment there
are none," he replied; "but we have seen the smoke of many fires,
and we were well within view as we passed the bay on the northern
side. Make no mistake, we have been seen; and I will say this,
which may cool your desire to go ashore: Captain Cook told me that
the savages of the New Hebrides are cannibals of the fiercest sort.
These islands must be a part of the same group."</p>

<p>"I don't fear them," Purcell interrupted, "whatever may be the
case with yourself."</p>

<p>Bligh jerked back his head, as though he had been struck in the
face. Purcell, always a cantankerous old rogue, had never before,
dared to speak in this fashion. Some allowance, perhaps, can be
made for him under the circumstances. Although he had borne
hardships well, it is possible that he felt the pangs of hunger
more keenly than any of us.</p>

<p>Mr. Bligh behaved with a forbearance I had thought him incapable
of exercising. Frequently, on the <i>Bounty</i>, I had seen him fly
into a passion upon slight provocation. Now that he had ample cause
for anger, he kept himself well in hand. The reason was, I believe,
that he knew how desperately weary we were and how bitter our
disappointment at being within view of what appeared to us Eden
itself, and forbidden to rest and refresh ourselves there. No
insult could have been more gross and unjust than that of the
carpenter, and he well knew it. For a moment Bligh did not trust
himself to speak. Then he said: "Set about your work, Mr. Purcell.
If you do not, by God you shall go ashore--with me, and with me
alone."</p>

<p>The carpenter, knowing that he was in the wrong, obeyed at once.
Those who had the strength assisted him; the rest of us kept watch
on shore.</p>

<p>Presently Lebogue exclaimed: "Aye, sir, we've been seen, right
enough! Look yonder!"</p>

<p>Half a dozen savages emerged from the thick bush and came down
to the water's edge, gazing out toward us. We were directly
opposite the entrance to the cove, and could see them plainly. They
were naked save for short kirtles about the middle, and were armed
with spears, bows, and arrows. About this same time, Tinkler and
Hayward discovered a path leading up one of the hills at the back
of the cove. At one point it was in plain view, where it rounded a
grassy knoll. Keeping watch upon this place, we saw more Indians
passing it as they hastened into the valley. The beach was soon
thronged, and we could faintly hear their shouts as they ran this
way and that, evidently in a state of great excitement. We had the
entire half circle of the beach within view; no canoes were to be
seen there, but we did not know what they might have concealed
amongst the trees.</p>

<p>In view of Purcell's bold statement of half an hour before, it
was interesting to observe his nervousness as the throng of savages
increased. Many an apprehensive glance did he throw in their
direction.</p>

<p>"Keep your eyes on your work, sir!" Bligh ordered. "Your friends
ashore will wait for you."</p>

<p>Presently Tinkler, who had the keenest eyes amongst us, informed
Bligh that he had seen three or four of the Indians running up the
hill, evidently returning to the large bay on the other side of the
mountains.</p>

<p>"They must be sending word to the people over there, sir," Fryer
remarked, anxiously. "No doubt they have canoes in the bay, and
mean to get at us by sea."</p>

<p>"I should think it more than likely, sir," Bligh replied,
quietly. "Nevertheless, we shall have time to finish repairing our
weather cloth."</p>

<p>Never, I fancy, had Purcell worked more earnestly than he did
upon this occasion. Bligh watched him grimly and would allow him to
skimp nothing.</p>

<p>Just as the work was finished, a large canoe, containing between
forty and fifty savages, appeared round the northern promontory,
about a mile distant. They had no sail, but, with ten or fifteen
paddlers on a side, they came on swiftly.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Purcell," said Bligh; "is it your desire that we let
them come up with us? You say you have no fear of them."</p>

<p>It was all but impossible for the carpenter ever to admit
himself in the wrong; but upon this occasion he swallowed his
stubborn pride at once.</p>

<p>"No, sir," he replied.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Bligh. "Get sail on her, Mr. Cole."</p>

<p>For all the stiffness of our limbs, the two sails were hoisted
in an instant, and we drew away from the land. For the moment, at
least, we forgot our hunger, our wet cloathing--everything was lost
sight of in the excitement of the race. At first the savages gained
rapidly, and it was plain from their actions that their intentions
were anything but friendly: those who were not paddling brandished
their weapons, and several of them shot arrows after us, some of
which fell only a little distance astern. Then we caught the full
force of the wind, and the space between us gradually increased.
Presently they gave up the pursuit; we saw them enter the cove
opposite which we had lain. We then stood away upon the old
course.</p>

<p>Never, I think, during the whole of our voyage, were our spirits
so low as upon this same afternoon. The sea stretched away, gray
and solitary, and we dared not think of the horizons beyond
horizons that remained to be crossed before we could set foot upon
any shore. Most of us knew that we were still far from halfway,
even, to the coast of New Holland. At the earliest we could not
hope to reach it before another fortnight had passed.</p>

<p>I now come to an incident concerning which I am most reluctant
to speak, and yet it must not be passed over in silence. There was,
it seems, one man in our company so lost to all sense of his duty
toward the others as to steal a part of our precious supply of
pork. The theft amounted to one two-pound piece, and was committed
during the night of this same day. With respect to the bread,
Captain Bligh had put temptation beyond the power of anyone: it was
kept under lock and key in the carpenter's chest. But the pork was
not so guarded. It was stored, wrapped in a cloth, in the bow. We
had passed a wretched night, with a strong northeast wind, a rough
sea, and perpetual rain. There had been no sleep for anyone. At
dawn the next morning, Captain Bligh ordered a teaspoonful of rum
and half an ounce of pork for our breakfast; and it was then that
the theft was discovered. I well remember the look of horror in Mr.
Cole's face as he reported it. "There's a piece missing, sir," he
said.</p>

<p>I should not have supposed that any man guilty of such a crime
against his comrades could have maintained an air of perfect
innocence upon the discovery of the theft; but so it was, here.
Captain Bligh questioned each of us by name, beginning with the
master:--</p>

<p>"Mr. Fryer, did you take this pork?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," Fryer replied, with a sincerity that no one could
doubt. The question was repeated seventeen times, and the seventeen
replies all carried conviction.</p>

<p>I remember having heard, or read, that men reduced to starvation
in company sometimes lose all sense of moral responsibility, and
that cases have been known where men of integrity, under normal
conditions, have committed such crimes without any qualms of
conscience, stoutly and indignantly denying them, no matter how
damning the evidence against them might be. With us there was no
evidence as to the possible culprit; most of our company had taken
turns at bailing in the bow during the night, which was so black
that one could not see one's next neighbour in the boat.</p>

<p>I shall say no more of this wretched affair except that the
thief, whoever he may have been, must surely have despised himself.
Captain Bligh brought home to him the enormity of the wrong he had
done his fellow sufferers in words that he could never forget.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>I believed, on the night of the fourteenth of May, that our
company had suffered to the limits of endurance. "Another night as
bad as this..." I had thought. And there were to be nine to
follow--nine days and nights, during which time we were
continuously wet and all but perished with cold. The wind shifted
from southeast to northeast, now blowing half a gale, now dying
away to a dead calm when the oars would be gotten out to keep the
launch before the sea. There were moments of fugitive sunshine, but
of such brief duration that they but added to our misery, for we
were never able to dry our cloathes.</p>

<p>Our situation on the afternoon of May twenty-third was so like
that of the twelfth that it seemed time had stood still. We rode
the same mountainous seas, under the same lowering sky. What added
to my confused sense that we were doomed to an eternity of misery
was that Mr. Bligh had again remarked to Fryer: "I think we've seen
the worst of it."</p>

<p>We had been on starvation rations for twenty-one days past, and,
during the whole of this time, wet to the skin and chilled to the
bone. Our bodies were covered with salt-water sores, so that the
slightest movement was agony, yet we were compelled to move
constantly for the purpose of bailing. Many of us were now too weak
to raise ourselves to our feet, but we crawled and pulled ourselves
about somehow, and, knowing that our lives depended upon it, we
could still manage to throw out water.</p>

<p>Never before had I realized what a torment the body could be.
But I must add this: neither had I realized the toughness, the
fineness, of the human spirit under conditions that try it to the
utmost. The miscreant who had stolen the pork served only as a foil
to the others, whose conduct was such during these interminable
hours of trial as has given me a new and exalted opinion of my
fellow beings. Whatever men may say in men's despite in the future,
or whatever unfortunate revelations concerning them may come under
my own observation, I shall think of the company in the
<i>Bounty's</i> launch and retain my firm belief that, in their
darkest hours, and in situations that bear upon them even past the
limits of endurance, most men show a heroism that lifts them to
heights beyond estimation. The cynic may smile at this. I care not.
I know whereof I speak. I have seen the matter put to the proof in
a company of eighteen whose members, with two exceptions,--Captain
Bligh and Mr. Nelson,--were men such as one might find in any
seacoast town in England.</p>

<p>I will not say that there had been no complaints, no urgent,
piteous requests for additional food. There were. I can understand
better now than I could then what strength Bligh needed to
withstand the entreaties of starving men. He fed the weakest upon
wine, a few drops at a time; but every demand for additional food
was refused save upon the occasions when a tiny morsel of pork
would be added to our mouthful of bread.</p>

<p>I have a vivid recollection of the events of the evening and the
night of May twenty-third. Bligh had been continuously at the
tiller for thirty-six hours, and he remained there until dawn the
following morning. I sat in the bottom of the boat facing him,
propped up against the thwart immediately forward of the stern
sheets. Nelson lay beside me with his head on my knee. He was
frightfully emaciated, and so weak that I believed he had not more
than twenty-four hours to live. The strongest of our number were
Mr. Bligh, Fryer, Cole, Peckover, Samuel, and the two midshipmen,
Tinkler and Hayward. The two latter were at the oars as the last of
daylight faded, keeping the launch before the sea.</p>

<p>It had been dead calm for more than two hours, but neither past
experience nor the look of the sky gave us reason to expect that it
would remain so. The last gray light faded quickly, and soon we
were in the complete darkness that had been our portion during so
many terrible nights.</p>

<p>About three hours after sunset I had fallen into a doze, and
only a moment later, it seemed, I was awakened by the deep humming
of the wind and the hiss and wash of breaking sea. I heard Bligh
calling to Cole, whose station was forward by the reefed foresail,
and immediately afterward solid water came pouring over our
quarters. Never had we come so near to foundering as at that
moment; indeed, for a few seconds I thought we were lost. Bligh
shouted: "Bail for your lives!" and so we did. Not a man of us but
realized that we were in the immediate presence of disaster.</p>

<p>The horror of that experience I shall not attempt to describe;
but it had this good effect: that it aroused even the weakest from
apathy, and called into play reserves of nervous force that we did
not know we possessed. As for Captain Bligh, he displayed,
throughout the whole of this night, a courage far above my poor
powers to depict. Now and then his emaciated form would be clearly
outlined for a second or two in a glare of lightning, then
swallowed up in darkness. When I had said to Nelson, at Tofoa; that
ours was a situation that Bligh was born to meet, I little realized
how truthfully I spoke. Worn down though he was by hunger and
hardship and lack of sleep, he showed no sign of weakening to the
strain. Indeed, the more desperate our situation, the more he
seemed to rejoice in it. I say this with no desire to exaggerate.
He displayed on this night an exhilaration of mind the more
striking in view of the peril of our situation. We passed through a
series of violent squalls accompanied by thunder and lightning, and
I shall never forget the vivid glimpses I had of him, one hand
gripping the tiller, the other the gunwale, the seas that
threatened to swamp us foaming up behind him and showering him with
spray.</p>

<p>And I can still hear his voice in the darkness, heartening us
all:</p>

<p>"We're doing a full six knots, lads! Let that warm your blood if
bailing can't do it--but don't stop bailing!"</p>

<p>Once, in a brief lull between storms, Fryer had suggested that a
prayer be said. "No, Mr. Fryer," he replied. "Pray if you like, but
to my way of thinking, God expects better than prayers of us at a
time like this." It was in this same lull, I remember, that Cole
called back, "Sir, shall I relieve you at the tiller?"</p>

<p>"Sit where you are, Mr. Cole," Bligh replied. "Do you think you
can handle her better than myself?"</p>

<p>"I know very well I can't," Cole replied. "I was thinking how
tired you must be."</p>

<p>A moment of silence followed; then we again heard Bligh's voice:
"You are a good man, Mr. Cole, and an able man. I wish there were
more like you in the service."</p>

<p>It was a handsome apology, and praise well deserved. I knew how
it must have warmed Cole's heart.</p>

<p>The pause between squalls was of short duration. There was more,
and worse, to come; and in the midst of it I saw Captain Bligh at
the summit of his career.</p>

<p>There was a blinding glare of lightning, followed by a peal of
thunder that seemed to shake the very bed of the deep. At that
moment a great sea flung the launch into an all but vertical
position. And there sat Bligh as on a throne, lifted high above us
all, exalted in more than a physical sense.</p>

<p>"Bail, lads!" he shouted. "By God! We're beating the sea
itself!"</p>

<h2><a name="c8" id="c8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p>During the following night the severity of the weather relaxed;
at dawn the sea was so calm that for the first time in fifteen days
we found it unnecessary to bail. I had managed to sleep for two or
three hours in a miserably cramped position. When I awoke, I lay
without moving for some time, gazing in a kind of stupor at what I
could see of the others in the boat.</p>

<p>Nelson lay beside me. His eyes were half opened, and with his
parted lips, looking blue in the morning light, his hollow cheeks
and sunken temples, I thought for a moment, until aware of some
slight sign of breathing, that he must have died during the night.
Captain Bligh sat in the stern, beside Elphinstone, who held the
tiller. Although reduced, like the rest of us, to skin and bone,
and clad, like ourselves, in sodden rags, there was nothing
grotesque in his appearance. Wear what he might, he was still a
noble figure, and suffering but added to the dignity and firmness
of his bearing.</p>

<p>"Come up here in the sun, Mr. Ledward," he said. "It will make a
new man of you."</p>

<p>I struggled to stand, but was unable to rise. Mr. Bligh helped
me to the seat beside him. He made a sign to Hayward and Tinkler to
help Nelson up. The botanist gave me a ghastly smile, designed to
be cheerful.</p>

<p>"I feel better already," he remarked in a weak voice.</p>

<p>The captain now addressed all hands. "Luck's with us," he said;
"we've left the bad weather behind. Off with your cloathes, before
the sun gets too high, and give them a drying while you've the
chance. The sun on our bare hides will be as good as a glass of
grog...Mr. Samuel, issue a teaspoonful of rum all round!" He
glanced about at the people appraisingly, and then added: "We'll
celebrate the good weather, lads! An ounce of pork with our bread
and water!"</p>

<p>Our cloathing, reduced to rags by soaking in rain and wringing
out in sea water, was hung along the gunwales to dry, and we now
presented a strange and pitiful spectacle. Our skins, from long
soaking in the rain, looked dead white, like the bellies of fish;
some of the men were so reduced that I thought it a wonder they
were able to stand. Nothing was more remarkable than their
cheerfulness in bearing their afflictions. The warm sun, not yet
high enough to scorch us, was exceedingly grateful, and our
breakfast, enriched by a bit of pork, was a cheerful meal.</p>

<p>The morning was as beautiful as any I have known at sea. The
breeze, at E.N.E., ruffled the sea to that shade of dark blue only
to be seen between the tropics, and filled our sails bravely,
without being boisterous enough to shower us with spray. The sky
was clear save for the small, tufted, fairweather clouds on the
verge of the horizon.</p>

<p>Mr. Fryer reached over the side and brought up a bit of coconut
husk, on which the first green beginnings of marine growth
appeared. He handed it to the captain, who examined it with
interest.</p>

<p>"This has been removed by man," he remarked. "And look! It has
not been overlong in the sea! We're close in with New Holland, not
a doubt of it!"</p>

<p>Nelson took it shakily from Bligh's hand. "Aye, the nut was
husked by Indians on a pointed stake. The growth of weed sprouts
quickly in these warm seas."</p>

<p>"Look!" exclaimed Elphinstone, pointing off to starboard.</p>

<p>Our heads turned, and we saw a company of the small black terns
called noddies, flying this way and that, low over the sea as they
searched for fish.</p>

<p>"Now, by God!" said the captain. "The land is not far off!"</p>

<p>The birds swung away to the west and disappeared. They were of
the size of pigeons, and their flight resembled a pigeon's
flight.</p>

<p>"The worst of our voyage is over," said Bligh. "We shall be
inside the reefs before the weather changes. You have borne
yourselves like true English seamen so far; I am going to ask for
further proofs of fortitude. I do not know certainly that there is
a European settlement on Timor, and should there prove to be none,
it would be imprudent to trust ourselves among the Indians there.
For this reason, I think all hands will agree that we had best
reduce our rations still further, in order to be able to reach Java
if necessary. My task is to take you to England. To make sure of
success, we must, from now on, do without our issue of bread for
supper."</p>

<p>I glanced at the men covertly, knowing that some were so reduced
that they might consider that Captain Bligh was cutting off the
means of life itself. I was surprised and pleased, therefore, to
see with what cheerfulness the captain's proposal was received.</p>

<p>"What's a twenty-fifth of an ounce of bread, sir?" asked old
Purcell, grimly. "I've no complaint! I'd as soon have none as what
we get. I reckon I could fetch Java with no bread at all!"</p>

<p>Bligh gave a short, harsh laugh. "I believe you might!" he
said.</p>

<p>"Once inside the reefs," remarked Nelson, "we'll need little
bread. There'll be shellfish, and no doubt we shall find various
fruits and berries on the islets."</p>

<p>Tinkler smacked his lips, and grinned. Like the other
midshipmen, he had withstood the hardships better than the grown
men. Even Hallet seemed to have grown but little thinner.</p>

<p>I had violent pains in my stomach through this day and suffered
much from tenesmus, as did nearly every man in the boat. Two or
three were constantly at the gunwales, attempting what they were
never able to perform, for not one of us, since leaving the
<i>Bounty</i>, had had evacuation by stool. At nightfall I lay down
in the bilges in a kind of stupor, till dawn. I was awakened by
Bligh's voice.</p>

<p>"Don't move!" he said.</p>

<p>Then I heard the voice of Smith, from the bows: "I'll have him
next time."</p>

<p>I opened my eyes and saw a small, black bird pass overhead,
looking down at the boat. Nelson was already awake, and whispered
weakly: "A noddy! Twice he's made as if to alight on the stem!"</p>

<p>"Hush!" said the captain, looking down at us.</p>

<p>The little tern passed overhead once more, set his wings, and
slanted down in the direction of the bow. Next moment I heard a
feeble shout go up from the people, and the sound of fluttering
wings.</p>

<p>"Good lad!" said Bligh to the man forward. "Don't wring his
neck!"</p>

<p>I managed to pull myself up to a sitting position while they
were passing a wineglass to Smith, who held the bird while Hall cut
its throat, allowing the blood to flow into the small glass, which
was filled nearly to the brim.</p>

<p>"Now pluck him," said Bligh, while the glass was being handed
aft. He motioned the midshipmen to help Nelson to sit up. "For you,
Mr. Nelson," he went on, giving Tinkler the glassful of blood.</p>

<p>Nelson smiled and shook his head. "Lamb and Simpson need it more
than I. Give it to them."</p>

<p>"I order you to drink the blood," said Bligh, with a smile that
robbed the words of sternness..."Mr. Hayward, hold the glass for
Mr. Nelson while he drinks."</p>

<p>The botanist closed his eyes and took the blood with a slight
grimace, raising a trembling hand to wipe his lips. The youngsters
made him as comfortable as they could by propping his back against
the thwart.</p>

<p>Fryer was at the tiller. The plucked noddy, no larger than a
small pigeon, was now handed to Mr. Bligh, who laid it on the
carpenter's chest, took a knife from his pocket, and divided the
bird into eighteen portions. It was done with the utmost possible
fairness, though a sixth portion of the breast was preferable to
one of the feet, and I should have preferred the neck to the head
and beak.</p>

<p>"Come aft, Mr. Peckover," said the captain..."Face forward, Mr.
Cole, and call out when Mr. Peckover gives the word."</p>

<p>The boatswain turned so that he was unable to see what went on.
Peckover looked over the shares of raw bird and took up a choice
bit of the breast.</p>

<p>"Who shall have this?" he called.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bligh!" replied Cole.</p>

<p>"No! No!" the captain interrupted. "There must be no precedence
here, Mr. Cole: you will begin with anyone's name, at random.
Should we catch another bird, the order must be changed. The
purpose of this old custom is to be fair to all."</p>

<p>Peckover laid down the bit of breast and took up a wing. "Who
shall have this?"</p>

<p>"Peter Lenkletter!"</p>

<p>The wing was handed to the quartermaster. When Bligh's turn came
he was so unfortunate as to get a foot with nothing on it but the
web and a shred or two of sinew where it had been disjointed, but
he gnawed this miserable portion with every appearance of relish,
and threw away nothing but the barest bones. The head and beak fell
to me; and it amazes me, as I write, to recollect with what
enjoyment I swallowed the eyes, and crunched the little skull
between my teeth as sucked out the raw brains. Small as the amount
of nourishment was, I fancied that it brought me an immediate
increase of strength. I was happy when Nelson got a rich, red
morsel of the breast. He wished to share it with me, and when I
refused, he lingered long over it. "The noddy eats well!" he said.
"No pheasant at home ever seemed better flavoured!"</p>

<p>Lamb was one of those men who seem born to make the worst of
every misfortune; he was unable to sit up, and had scarcely enough
strength to complain of the pain in his bowels. When his turn came,
he got the other foot; and Cole, who had just received a portion of
breast, handed it to him. "Here," he said gruffly. "Ye need this
more than me."</p>

<p>"Thankee, Mr. Cole, thankee!" said Lamb in a quavering voice as
he stuffed the bit of flesh into his mouth.</p>

<p>The weather continued fair throughout the day, with a calm sea
and a good sailing breeze at E.N.E. It was fortunate that we were
not obliged to bail, for many of us could not have undertaken the
task. Our log showed that we were making between four and four and
a ball knots. During the afternoon we passed bits of driftwood on
which the barnacles had not yet gathered, and Elphinstone picked up
a bamboo pole, such as the Indians use for fishing rods. It was
slimy with the beginnings of marine growth, but could not have been
more than two or three weeks in the sea. Purcell took the bamboo,
dried and cleaned it, sawed off the ends square, and set to fitting
and seizing a worn-out file into the large end, to make a spear for
fish.</p>

<p>Toward evening, a lone booby appeared astern, and circled the
boat for a long time, as if he desired to alight. We sat in
suspense for ten minutes or more. The bird was not unlike our
gannets at home, with a body as great as that of a large duck, and
a five-foot spread of wings. I held my breath each time his shadow
passed over the boat; I could hear Bligh's hearty, whispered curses
when the bird came sailing in as if to alight and then slanted
away.</p>

<p>At last young Tinkler whispered: "Let me try, sir--with the
bamboo. I've seen the Indians at Otaheite take them so, by breaking
their wings."</p>

<p>Bligh nodded. The bird had again turned away. The youngster
crept forward, took the spear from Purcell, and stood on a thwart.
The booby swung back toward the boat, while Tinkler waved his
bamboo back and forth gently. It was strange, as the bird turned
back toward the launch, to see how the moving spear aroused his
curiosity. He came on with a rapid flap of wings, turning his head
to see better, and passed over us very low, though still too high
to be reached. Tinkler continued to move the rod gently.</p>

<p>This time the booby did not rise, but turned and headed back.
The youngster held the spear with both hands, ready to strike. On
came the bird, lower than ever, his wings held rigidly. Tinkler
raised the rod to the full extent of his arms, and struck. The blow
caught the booby where one of the wings joined the body, and with a
grating cry he plunged into the sea.</p>

<p>"Hard up!" shouted Captain Bligh.</p>

<p>For the first time since leaving Tofoa, the boat was turned into
the wind. Her sails fluttered as she lulled and lost steerageway;
we made a board and came about on the other tack before we were
able to pick up the bird.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tinkler," said the captain; "your fishing with the Indians
was not wasted time!"</p>

<p>The launch shot up into the wind. Many eager hands went over the
gunwale to pick up the wounded bird. Lebogue caught him and tossed
him into the boat.</p>

<p>This time the blood was shared amongst Nelson, Lamb, and
Simpson, who received a full wineglass each; and when the
carcass--legs, head, bones, entrails, and flesh--was apportioned by
the method of "Who shall have this?" our shares were of a size to
make us feel that we were sitting down to a feast. Three flying
fish, each about seven inches long, were found in the bird's
stomach; they were fresh, and I was overjoyed when one fell to me.
I had eaten the raw fish prepared by the Indians of Otaheite, and
found it palatable when dipped in a sauce of sea water. I now
opened my knife and scaled the flying fish gloatingly, before
cutting it into morsels which I dropped into the salt water in my
coconut shell. Nothing was wasted; I even ate the entrails, and
quaffed off the bloody salt water in which the fish had soaked.</p>

<p>Though we sailed well, the weather remained serene that day and
during the two days following. On Tuesday we passed fresh coconut
husks and driftwood which appeared to have been in the water no
more than a week. We had the good fortune to catch three boobies on
this day; without their blood and raw flesh I am convinced that two
or three of us must have succumbed. The sun was so hot at midday
that I felt faint and sick. On Wednesday it was apparent to all
that the land was close ahead. The clouds to the west were fixed,
and there were innumerable birds about, though we could catch none.
The heat of the sun again caused much suffering.</p>

<p>"Soak what rags you can spare in the sea, and make turbans of
them!" said the captain, when he heard some of the people
complaining of the heat. He laughed. "English seamen are hard to
please! I'd rather be hot than cold any day, and dry than wet, for
that matter! Wring out your turbans frequently. The cool water'll
soon make you feel like fighting cocks. We should sight the reefs
to-morrow, with this breeze."</p>

<p>The boatswain smacked his lips. "There'll be fine pickings, sir,
once we find a passage. Cockles, and clams, and who knows
what!"</p>

<p>"We'll find a way in, never fear. From our latitude, we should
sight the land close to Providential Channel, through which Captain
Cook sailed the <i>Endeavour</i>."</p>

<p>Nelson lay on the floor boards, listening to the talk as coolly
as if dining with the captain aboard the <i>Bounty</i>.</p>

<p>"From what I have heard Captain Cook say," he remarked, "there
must be many passages leading in to the sheltered water. No doubt
we shall have several to choose from."</p>

<p>"So I believe," said Bligh.</p>

<p>At about nine o'clock that night, the captain lay down beside me
to sleep.</p>

<p>"Keep a sharp lookout, Mr. Cole," he said; "we may be closer to
the reefs than we suppose."</p>

<p>A swell from the east had set in, but the breeze was steady and
light, and there were no whitecaps to wet us with spray. I lay half
in a doze, half in a stupor, for several hours, listening to
Bligh's quiet breathing. At last I fell asleep.</p>

<p>It must have been a little past midnight when I was awakened by
the boatswain's voice:--</p>

<p>"Mr. Bligh! Breakers, sir!"</p>

<p>In an instant the captain was on his feet and wide awake. I
heard a distant, long-drawn roar; and Bligh's abrupt command: "Hard
alee!"</p>

<p>Three or four others were up by this time, ready for duty.
"Close-haul her!"</p>

<p>The moon was down, but the breakers were visible in the
starlight as we clawed off.</p>

<p>"She lays well clear," remarked the captain. "By God! What a
surf! Let it break! We'll find a way through when daylight
comes!"</p>

<p>Many of us in the bottom of the boat were too weak or too
indifferent even to raise our heads. Bligh noticed that I
stirred.</p>

<p>"The reefs of New Holland, Mr. Ledward! We'll be sailing calm
water soon, and stretching our legs ashore! You'll be feasting on
shellfish to-morrow, my word on it!"</p>

<p>I managed to turn on my side, and fell asleep once more, lulled
by a new sound: the crisp slap of wavelets under the launch's bow
as she stood off the land, close-hauled on the starboard tack.</p>

<p>At dawn, though the night had been warm and calm, most of the
people were dreadfully weak. The birds we had eaten had merely
prolonged our lives, without imparting any real strength. At the
first signs of daylight, Mr. Bligh gave word to slack away to the
west, but it was mid-morning before we again sighted the breakers.
The wind had shifted to S.E. during the night.</p>

<p>Two teaspoons of rum were issued before we drank our water and
ate our scant mouthful of bread. Heartened by the spirit and the
prospect of smooth water and food, I struggled to a sitting
position. Nelson was unable to sit up. Mr. Bligh had poured a few
drops of rum between his lips, but he had shaken his head weakly
when offered bread. I could see that the botanist, for all his
courage, was at the end of his tether; unless we could secure fresh
food for him, another day or two would see him dead. Lamb and
Simpson were in a piteous state, and several others were nearly as
bad.</p>

<p>Toward nine o'clock a line of tossing white stretched away as
far as we could see to the north and south. The vast roll of the
Pacific, broken by the coral barrier, thundered and spouted
furiously.</p>

<p>Not more than a hundred yards beyond the first break of the
seas, Bligh steered to the north, ordering Tinkler and Cole to trim
the sheets.</p>

<p>"There, lads!" he said. "That should put heart in you! Never
fear! We shall soon be inside!"</p>

<p>It was indeed a strange and heartening sight to men in our
situation to see, just beyond the barrier of furious breakers, the
placid waters of a vast lagoon, scarce ruffled by the gentle
southeast breeze. And it seemed to me that I could perceive the
outlines of land, blue and misty in the distance, far away across
the calm water.</p>

<p>We had rounded a point of the reef and coasted for some distance
in a northwesterly direction, when it fell calm for a few moments
and the wind chopped around to east. Bligh bore up and ordered the
sails trimmed once more, when we perceived that the reefs jutted
far out to sea ahead of us.</p>

<p>"Forward with you, Mr. Cole!" said Bligh, and, when the
boatswain stood in the bows with a hand on the foremast, "Can she
lay clear?"</p>

<p>Cole gazed ahead intently for a moment before he replied: "No,
sir! Can't ye point up a bit?"</p>

<p>Though close-hauled, the luff of the mainsail was shivering a
little at the time. Bligh shrugged his shoulders. "Hard alee!" he
ordered. "Let go the halyards and get her on the other tack!"</p>

<p>We had not sailed a quarter of a mile on the larboard tack, when
it was evident that we were embayed. The east wind had caught us
unaware, and we could not lay clear of the points to north or
south. We turned the launch north once more.</p>

<p>"Who can pull an oar?" Bligh asked.</p>

<p>Lenkletter, Lebogue, and Elphinstone attempted to rise, and sank
back ashamed of their weakness. Fryer, Purcell, Cole, and Peckover
took their places at the thwarts. They pulled grimly and feebly; in
spite of their courage, they had not sufficient strength to enable
us to clear the point of reef about two miles ahead.</p>

<p>"Now, by God!" Bligh exclaimed. "We must weather the point or
shoot the breakers--one of the two!...Mr. Tinkler! Are you strong
enough to steer? Take the tiller and point up as close as you
can!"</p>

<p>The captain set a tholepin on the lee side, ran out an oar, and
began to pull strongly and steadily.</p>

<p>The prospect of shooting the breakers was enough to make the
hardiest seaman pause. I could see, from time to time, the dark,
jagged coral of the reef, revealed by a retreating sea. A moment
later the same spot would be buried deep in foaming water, rushing
over the reef with the thunder of a mighty cataract. It was
incredible that our boat, small and deep laden, could live for an
instant in such a turmoil. As I glanced ahead my heart sank. Then
Tinkler shouted:--</p>

<p>"Mr. Bligh! There's a passage ahead, sir! Well this side of the
point!"</p>

<p>Bligh shipped his oar and rose instantly. After a quick glance
ahead, he turned to the men. "Cease pulling, lads," he said kindly.
"Providence has been good to us. Yonder lies our channel; we can
fetch it under sail."</p>

<h2><a name="c9" id="c9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>
The passage was less than a mile ahead, and as we were now able to
bear off a little and fill the sails, we were abreast of the
opening in about a quarter of an hour. It proved to be a good two
cable-lengths wide, and clear of rocks, with a small, barren islet
just inside. We entered with a strong current setting to the
westward; presently the roll of the sea was gone, and the launch
sailed briskly over waters as calm as those of a lake at home.

<p>I looked with longing at the islet close abreast of us. Though
small and barren, it was at least dry land. Purcell's longing got
the better of him.</p>

<p>"Let us go ashore, sir," he suggested, when it was apparent that
the captain was going to sail on. "Cannot we land and stretch our
legs?"</p>

<p>Bligh shook his head. "We should find nothing there. Look ahead,
man!"</p>

<p>Two other islands, one of them high and wooded, were now visible
at a distance of four or five leagues to the northwest; and close
beyond, I could see the main of New Holland--valleys and high land,
densely wooded in parts.</p>

<p>The afternoon was well advanced when we reached the first of the
two islands--little more than a heap of stones. The larger island
was about three miles in circuit, high, well wooded, with a
sheltered, sandy bay on the northwest side. From this bay, the
nearest point on the main was about four hundred yards distant. As
there were no signs of Indians in the vicinity, we beached the boat
at once. For twenty-six days we had not set foot on land.</p>

<p>Mr. Bligh was the first to step on shore, staggering a little
from weakness and the unaccustomed feel of firm ground. Fryer,
Purcell, Peckover, Cole, and the midshipmen followed. All these
could walk, though with difficulty. Hall, Smith, Lebogue and Samuel
managed to get out of the boat, and either staggered or crawled to
a place where the sand was soft and shaded by some small, bushy
trees. The rest of us were in such a state as forced our stronger
companions to help us ashore.</p>

<p>Mr. Bligh now uncovered, while those who were able knelt round
him on the sand; and if ever men have offered heartfelt thanks to
God for deliverance from the perils of the sea, surely we were
those men.</p>

<p>After a brief silence, Bligh cleared his throat and turned to
the master. "Mr. Fryer," he said, "take the strongest of the people
and search for shellfish. There should be oysters or mussels on the
rocks yonder...Mr. Peckover, you will accompany me inland...Mr.
Cole, remain in charge of the boat. Take care that no fires are lit
tonight."</p>

<p>Nelson and I had each had a small sup of wine, administered by
the captain's hand. This, together with the prospect of something
to eat and the delight of being once more on land, gave us fresh
strength. We lay side by side. The sand was pleasantly warm, and a
clump of dwarfish palms cast an agreeable shade.</p>

<p>We talked but little. We needed time to accustom ourselves to
the fact that we were still alive, and to lie outstretched on dry
land was a privilege so great that we could scarcely believe it
ours.</p>

<p>"Can you realize, my dear Ledward, that our troubles are over?"
Nelson asked, at length. "I have often heard Captain Cook speak of
his passage inside the reefs of New Holland. Among these islands we
shall find something to eat: shellfish, certainly, as well as
berries and beans that are fit for food. There should be water on
some of the larger islands."</p>

<p>"It is curious," I replied; "at present I feel not the slightest
desire for food. I would not exchange the rest we are enjoying for
the best meal that might be set before us."</p>

<p>"I feel the same," he said. "It is rest we need now above
everything."</p>

<p>We fell silent again, and remained so for a long time. A flock
of large birds, parrots of some sort, passed overhead with harsh
cries and disappeared in the direction of the main. I saw Nelson's
eyes roving this way and that as he studied the vegetation about
us.</p>

<p>"These palms are new to me," he said, "yet I feel certain that
their hearts, like those of the coconut palm, will provide
excellent salad."</p>

<p>Presently the sun went down, and far along the beach we saw the
foraging party returning. I knew how weary they must be, and felt
ashamed of my own lack of strength.</p>

<p>"We're a useless pair, Nelson," I said. "Why were we not given
stronger bodies?"</p>

<p>"Never fear," he replied. "We'll soon be taking our share of
labour. I feel greatly refreshed already."</p>

<p>The captain and Peckover had their hats partly filled with
fruits of two sorts.</p>

<p>"Have a look at these, Mr. Nelson," said Bligh. "By God! We've
found little for the length of the walk. I observed that the birds
eat freely of these berries. May we not do the same?"</p>

<p>"Aye, they look wholesome and good. I recognize their families,
but the species are new to me. These palms, sir--cannot some of the
people cut out a few of the hearts? We'll find them delicious, I'll
be bound."</p>

<p>"There, Peckover!" Bligh exclaimed, turning to the gunner. "That
shows the need for a botanist in every ship's company. We've walked
miles for a few berries, and Mr. Nelson finds food for us within a
dozen paces of the boat!"</p>

<p>"Aye," said Peckover. "I'd be pleased to have the knowledge
inside Mr. Nelson's head. We've found good water, Mr. Ledward, and
plenty of it. We can drink our fill while here."</p>

<p>Fryer and his men were coming up the beach--well laden, as I
perceived at a glance.</p>

<p>"We shall feast to-night," he called. "We've found oysters
galore! And larger and better tasting than those at home!"</p>

<p>"Come, lads," said Bligh; "let us turn to without waste of
time."</p>

<p>I have never been averse to the pleasures of the table, and have
had the good fortune to partake of many excellent meals; but never
do I recollect having supped with more pleasure than on this night.
Fryer had adopted the simple expedient of opening the oysters where
they grew, without attempting to loose them from the rocks. Our
copper pot held close to three gallons, and it was more than half
full of oysters of an amazing size, soaking in their own juice.
Some of the people had woven baskets of palm fronds, an art they
had learned from the Indians of Otaheite, and in these they carried
a supply of unopened oysters, prized off the rocks with a cutlass.
The fruits were excellent, particularly one kind which resembled a
gooseberry, but tasted sweeter; the palm hearts were like tender
young cabbage, eaten raw.</p>

<p>I recommended Nelson, Lamb, and Simpson to eat of nothing but
oysters that night,--a diet suitable to their distressed
state,--and I myself refrained from anything else. The night was
warm and clear. When we had supped, and drunk to our heart's
content of the cool, sweet water of the island, I composed myself
for sleep on the sand.</p>

<p>The firm ground seemed still to rock and heave. But it was
wonderfully agreeable to stretch my legs out to their full extent;
to lie on the warm sand and gaze up at the stars. I was sorry for
some of the people, who had been ordered to anchor the launch in
shallow water, near the sands, and to sleep aboard of her. Mr.
Bligh thought it not unlikely that Indians might be about.
Presently I closed my eyes to thank my Maker briefly for His
goodness in preserving us; a few moments later I fell into a
dreamless sleep.</p>

<p>I was awakened by the loud chattering of parrots, flying from
the interior of our island, where they appeared to roost, to the
main. Flock after flock passed overhead with a great clamour; the
last of them had gone before the sun was up. My companions lay
sleeping close by, in the attitudes they had assumed the night
before. I saw the boatswain wade ashore from the launch and kneel
on the wet sand while he repeated the Lord's Prayer in a rumbling
voice, plainly audible where I lay. He rose, stripped off his shirt
and ragged trousers, and plunged into the shallow bay, scrubbing
his head and shoulders vigorously. Longing to follow his example, I
managed to struggle to my feet, and was pleased to discover that I
could walk.</p>

<p>Still splashing in the sea, Cole greeted me. "No need to ask how
ye slept, Mr. Ledward! Ye look a new man!"</p>

<p>I felt one when I had bathed in the cool sea water and resumed
my tattered garments, which a London ragpicker would have scorned
to accept. The others were rising as I turned inland, walking with
the uncertain gait of a year-old child.</p>

<p>Nelson managed to stand at the second attempt, but was forced to
sink down again immediately, doubled up with a sharp pain in his
stomach. "I've a mind to ask you to physic me," he said with a wry
smile.</p>

<p>I shook my head. "It would be imprudent in our state of
weakness. Our pain and tenesmus are due to the emptiness of our
bowels."</p>

<p>Bligh joined us at that moment. "Sound advice, sir," he said;
"if a layman may express an opinion. To physic men in our state
would but weaken us still more. I have suffered from the same
violent pains. We'll be quit of them once our bellies are filled."
He turned to hail the boatswain. "Come ashore, Mr. Cole, the lot of
you."</p>

<p>Fryer was sent out with a party to get oysters, and two men
dispatched inland for fruit. Cole and Purcell were set to putting
the boat in order, in case we should find savages about. I was
among four or five whom the captain ordered to rest throughout the
morning. Nelson lay beside me in the shade.</p>

<p>"What the devil is Cole up to?" he remarked.</p>

<p>The boatswain was wading about the launch, moving in circles and
staring down into the water. After some time he came ashore with a
long face. Bligh was writing in his journal, and glanced up as Cole
addressed him.</p>

<p>"The lower gudgeon of the rudder's gone, sir," he said. "It must
have dropped off as we was entering the bay. It's not on the
sand--that I'll vouch for."</p>

<p>Bligh closed his journal with a snap, and stood up. "Unship the
rudder. Are you sure it's nowhere under the boat?"</p>

<p>"I've made certain of that, sir."</p>

<p>"Then lend Mr. Purcell a hand." He turned to Nelson. "We've
Providence to thank that this did not happen a few days ago! I had
grummets fixed on either side of the transom, as you observed, in
case we were forced to steer with the oars; but in severe weather
it would have been next to impossible to keep afloat with them. We
should have broached-to, almost certainly."</p>

<p>Presently the carpenter brought the rudder ashore.</p>

<p>"It's been under heavy strains, sir," he explained. "The 'screws
holding the gudgeon to the sternpost must have loosened in the
wood."</p>

<p>"Well, what can be done?"</p>

<p>Purcell held out a large staple. "I found this under the floor
boards. It will serve."</p>

<p>"Do your best, and see that it is stoutly set. We must beach the
boat and examine her bottom to-day."</p>

<p>The captain took leave of us and wandered inland to search for
fruit. Purcell hammered at his staple on a rock, fitting its curve
to the pintle of the rudder. I recommended the invalids to drink
frequently of water, taking as much as they could hold, and set
them an example by doing the same.</p>

<p>"It's grub I need, not water!" said Lamb, making a wry face as I
handed him a coconut-shellful.</p>

<p>"You'll have plenty of that shortly, my lad!" I said.</p>

<p>Simpson crawled off for another useless attempt to perform the
impossible. "Poor devil!" Nelson said. "I'll soon be doing the
same."</p>

<p>A little before noon the oyster gatherers returned with a
bountiful supply. Nelson and I had arranged a hearth of stones, and
found strength to gather a quantity of firewood. Bligh was soon on
hand to kindle the fire with his magnifying glass and supervise the
making of the stew--our first taste of hot food since leaving
Tofoa, nearly a month before. The people were gathered in a circle
about our fireplace, staring at the pot like a pack of wolves.</p>

<p>When all the oysters had been opened, we found that they and
their liquor filled the pot to within four inches of the brim.
Captain Bligh ordered Samuel to weigh out a twenty-fifth of a pound
of bread for each man, making three quarters of a pound in all. A
pound of fat pork was now cut up very fine and thrown into the
stew, already beginning to bubble over a brisk fire. I was sitting
with Nelson on the lee side, inhaling savoury whiffs of steam that
drifted past.</p>

<p>"Let us add a quart of sea water," said the master to Mr. Bligh.
"It will serve as salt, and make the stew go further."</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Fryer. What with oysters and the pork, it will be salty
enough as it is."</p>

<p>"We could add fresh water to make more of it. There'll not be
enough to go round."</p>

<p>"Not enough, with a full pint each?" said Bligh impatiently. "If
it will do for me, it will do for yourself, sir."</p>

<p>Fryer said no more.</p>

<p>Presently the stew was ready. It was served out in Bligh's own
coconut shell, known to hold exactly a pint. My own shell held
double that, and when I had been served I wished with the master
that the amount might have been more. The crumbled bits of bread
had boiled down to mingle with the liquor from the oysters and the
fat pork, forming a sauce an alderman might not have despised. I
tasted a small quantity with a little spoon I had whittled out of a
bit of driftwood.</p>

<p>"Damme, sir!" said Bligh, turning to Nelson. "Many's the time
I've eaten worse than this on His Majesty's ships."</p>

<p>"And many a better meal you have enjoyed less, I dare say,"
Nelson replied.</p>

<p>"I've served on ships," said Fryer, "where we'd not such a meal
for six months together."</p>

<p>"Aye," said the captain. "Hunger's the only sauce. It was damn
near worth starving for a month to have such a relish for
victuals...Do you mind what day it is, Mr. Nelson?"</p>

<p>"What day? I could not be sure of telling you within a
week."</p>

<p>"It is Friday, the twenty-ninth of May: the anniversary of the
Restoration of King Charles the Second. We shall call this
Restoration Island, in his memory. The name will serve in a double
sense. We have been restored, God knows!"</p>

<p>Employing some self-restraint, I managed to eat my share so as
to take a full half hour to finish it. Fryer, I observed, gulped
his down in an instant, and held out his shell for the few
spoonfuls left over for every man. Purcell and Lenkletter played
the gluttons as well, and I was forced to warn Simpson, still in a
very weak state, against swallowing his food too fast.</p>

<p>Nelson and I felt so much revived after dinner that we set out
for a tottering walk into the island. We found it rocky, with a
barren soil, supporting a growth of stunted trees. There were many
of the small palms whose hearts we had found good to eat; I
recognized the <i>purau</i>, of Otaheite, in a stunted form; and
there were other trees which Nelson informed me resembled the
poisonous manchineel of the West Indies. About the summit of the
island, not above one hundred and fifty feet in height, great
numbers of parrots and large pigeons were feeding on the berries
here growing in abundance, but though we tried to knock them down
with stones, the birds were as hard to approach as partridges in
England. We gathered a quantity of the better sort of berries,
which eat very well indeed, and as we wandered toward the eastern
side of the island we came upon two tumbled-down huts of the
Indians. These were ruder than any Indian habitations I had seen.
Nelson stooped over the blackened stones of a fireplace to take up
a roughly fashioned spear, with the sharp end hardened in the
fire.</p>

<p>At that moment I perceived in the sand the tracks of some large
animal, unlike the footprints of any beast known to me. Nelson
examined the tracks with interest.</p>

<p>"I think I can name the beast," he said: "Mr. Gore, Captain
cook's lieutenant, shot one at Endeavour River, south of here. It
was as great as a man, mouse-coloured, and ran hopping on its hind
legs. The Indians called it <i>kanguroo</i>."</p>

<p>"How could it have come here?" I asked. "Do they swim?"</p>

<p>"That I don't know. Perhaps; or it may be that the Indians stock
these islands with young ones, where they may be easily caught when
required."</p>

<p>"Is the flesh fit for food?"</p>

<p>"Cook thought it was good as the best mutton. The beasts are
said to be timid, and to run faster than a horse."</p>

<p>As we approached the rocky shore on the east side of the island,
Nelson chose himself a long, wide palm frond, and sat down, Indian
fashion, to plait a basket. I admired the deftness of his fingers
as they wove the leaflets swiftly this way and that; in ten minutes
he had completed a stout basket, handle and all, fit to hold a full
bushel.</p>

<p>"Now for the shellfish!" he remarked, as he rose shakily to his
feet. "Gad, Ledward! I feel a new man to-day!"</p>

<p>I set to work with the cutlass, opening the oysters growing here
and there on the rocks below highwater mark; with his Indian spear,
Nelson waded among the pools. I soon had three or four dozen
oysters in the basket. Nelson added two large cockles of the
Tridacna kind to our bag: the pair of them a meal for a man. It was
midafternoon when we took up our burdens and trudged back to the
encampment, halting frequently to rest.</p>

<p>Our stew that afternoon was a noble one--oysters, cockles, and
chopped-up heart of palm. This latter was added at Nelson's
suggestion, and was the cause of some murmuring.</p>

<p>"Are we to have no bread, sir?" asked the carpenter sourly.</p>

<p>"No," replied Captain Bligh; "we shall save our bread. Mr.
Nelson says these palm hearts are as good cooked as raw."</p>

<p>Fryer stood by with a gloomy face. "It will ruin the stew," he
said. "The bread was the making of it at dinner time."</p>

<p>"Aye, sir," put in Purcell, "give us but half the full amount.
It'll be poor stuff without the bread."</p>

<p>Bligh turned away impatiently. "Damn it, no!" he replied.
"You're grown queasy as young ladies on the island here! Wait till
you taste the stew, if you must complain."</p>

<p>Our meal was soon pronounced done, and each man received a full
pint and a half. The sauce seemed to me even better than that we
had eaten at dinner, and once the men tasted it all murmuring
ceased.</p>

<p>At sunset, when it fell dead calm, we observed several columns
of smoke at a distance of two or three miles on the main. Bligh
ordered some of the people to pass the night in the boat, and a
watch was kept on shore.</p>

<p>"We must be on our guard," he said; "though I believe there is
small danger of the Indians visiting us to-night. Our fire made no
smoke, and they cannot have seen the boat."</p>

<p>As darkness came on, Bligh went down to the beach, where Cole
was on watch, and remained for a long time seated on the sand
chatting with him, while the rest of us retired to our sleeping
places.</p>

<p>Nelson was asleep almost at once; but returning strength had
left me wakeful, and I lay for a long time gazing at the starlit
sky. Purcell and the master lay close by, conversing in low tones.
Perhaps they thought me asleep; in any event, I could not avoid
overhearing what they said. After a time, I perceived that their
talk had turned to the mutiny.</p>

<p>"Ungrateful?" the carpenter was saying. "Damn my eyes! What had
they to be grateful for? Christian was treated worse than a dog
half the time. I excuse none of 'em, mind! I'd be pleased to see
every man of the lot swinging at a yardarm; but I'll say this: If
ever a captain deserved to lose his ship, ours did."</p>

<p>"If that's your feeling, why didn't you join with Christian?"
said Fryer.</p>

<p>"It's no love for Captain Bligh that kept me from it, I'll
promise you that," said Purcell. "He's himself to thank for the
mutiny, and so I'll say if we've the luck to get home."</p>

<p>"He has his faults," said Fryer. "He trusts none of his officers
to perform their duties, but must have a hand in everything. But if
you think him a Tartar, you should sail with some of the captains
I've served under. There was old Sandy Evans! The last topman off
the yard got half a dozen with a colt. He called it 'encouraging'
them."</p>

<p>"I'd rather be flogged than cursed before my own men," growled
Purcell. "You mind what he called me before my mates in Adventure
Bay? And what he said to Christian, with all the people about, the
day before they seized the ship?"</p>

<p>"He's overfree with his tongue," admitted Fryer. "But what
captain is not? The Navy's no place for thin skins. Hard words and
floggings are what seamen understand." He paused for a moment.
"I've served under easier captains," he added. "He's a hard man to
please. But where would we be without him now? Tell me that. Whom
would you wish in his place in the launch?"</p>

<p>"I'm not saying he lacks his good points," the carpenter
admitted grudgingly.</p>

<p>When I fell asleep at last, their voices were still murmuring
on. I awoke feeling better than for many days past. Nelson was
already up, and a party was setting out down the beach in search of
new beds of oysters. Bligh was speaking to Purcell.</p>

<p>"I saw some good <i>purau</i> trees near the summit of the
island," he said. "Take your axe and see if you can find us a pair
of spare yards." He turned to the boatswain. "Mr. Cole, see that
the casks are all filled and placed in the boat."</p>

<p>I went off oystering with Nelson, both of us able to walk pretty
well by now. When we returned, preparations for dinner were under
way. Mr. Bligh held in his hand the last of our pork, a piece of
about two pounds' weight, well streaked with lean. He handed it to
Hall, motioning him to cut it up for the pot.</p>

<p>"We'll sail with full bellies," he remarked. "Since some villain
robbed his mates of their pork, we'll put it out of his power to
play that scurvy trick again."</p>

<p>He looked hard at Lamb as he spoke, and it seemed to me that the
man hung his head with some slight expression of guilt.</p>

<p>With plenty of oysters, about a couple of ounces of pork for
each man, and the usual ration of bread, we dined sumptuously; had
we had a little pepper to season it, the stew would have been
pronounced excellent anywhere. We had scarce finished eating when
the captain spoke:--</p>

<p>"We shall set sail about two hours before sunset. With this moon
coming on, we can avoid the danger of canoes by traveling as much
as possible by night. Mr. Nelson and I will remain to guard the
launch; the rest of you gather oysters for a sea store."</p>

<p>The master had just stretched out for a siesta after his dinner,
and he sat up with a gloomy expression at Bligh's words.</p>

<p>"Can we not rest this afternoon, sir?" he asked. "None of us has
his full strength as yet, and surely we shall find oysters at every
landing place."</p>

<p>"Aye," growled Purcell. "You promised us we should touch at many
islands before clearing Endeavour Straits."</p>

<p>"I did," said the captain; "but what assurance have you that we
shall find oysters on them? We <i>know</i> that there are plenty
here." He flushed, controlling his temper with some difficulty.
"We've naught but bread now, and little enough of that. Fetch what
oysters you wish, or none at all! I'm tired of your damned
complaints!" He turned his back and walked away as if fearing to
lose control of himself. Shamed into acquiescence, Fryer and the
carpenter now joined the others setting out along the shore.</p>

<p>The captain's clerk was strolling southward with a basket on his
arm, and I joined him, since Nelson was to remain with the
boat.</p>

<p>"You know your Bible, Mr. Ledward," remarked Samuel, when we
were out of earshot of the others. "Do you recollect the passage
concerning Jeshurun who waxed fat, and kicked?"</p>

<p>"Aye; and it falls pat on Restoration Island!"</p>

<p>Samuel smiled. "Where would they be, where would we all be,
without Captain Bligh? Yet they must murmur the moment their
bellies are full! I've no patience with such men."</p>

<p>"Nor I." Glancing at the clerk's formerly plump body, now
reduced to little more than skin and bones, and clad in rags, I
could not repress a smile.</p>

<p>"Though we kick," I said, "none of us could be accused of waxing
fat!"</p>

<p>Toward four o'clock we returned with what shellfish we had been
able to secure, and found all in readiness to sail. We took our
places in the launch, the grapnel was weighed, and we were getting
sail on her, when about a score of Indians appeared on the opposite
shore of the main, shouting loudly at us. The heads of many others
were discernible above the ridge behind them; but, to our great
content, they seemed to be unprovided with canoes. Owing to this
fortunate circumstance, we were able to pass pretty close to them,
with a fresh breeze at E.S.E. They carried long, slender lances in
their right hands, and in their left hands some sort of weapon or
implement of an oval shape and about two feet long.</p>

<p>These Indians were unlike any we had seen in the South Sea; they
were coal black, tall, and remarkably thin, with long, skinny legs.
Two of the men stood leaning on their spears, with one knee bent,
and the sole of the foot pressed against the inside of the other
thigh--an attitude comical as it was uncouth. Though too far off to
distinguish their features clearly, they seemed to me quite as ugly
as the natives of Van Diemen's Land.</p>

<p>The breeze freshened as we drew out of the lee, and the launch
footed it briskly to the north, while the hallooing of savages grew
fainter and finally died away.</p>

<h2><a name="c10" id="c10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p>Restoration Island had proved well worthy of its name. It might
as truthfully have been called Preservation Island, for there is no
doubt whatever that, had we been delayed a day or two longer in
reaching it, several of our number must have succumbed. Nelson and
I would have been two of these; we were drawing upon our last
reserves of strength when we passed through the channel into the
great lagoons of New Holland. But, after three days of rest and a
sufficiency of food, we were wonderfully restored; so much so, that
we could take interest and pleasure in the scenes before us.</p>

<p>Ours was, in fact, a great privilege, and I was grateful for the
fact that I had recovered strength enough to recognize it. We were
coasting the shores of a mighty continent, through waters and among
islands all but unknown to white men. Indeed, in so far as I knew,
Captain Cook alone had passed this way before us. On our left lay
the main, stretching away, we knew not how many hundreds or
thousands of leagues, and wrapped in a silence that seemed to have
lain there since the beginning of time--a deep, all-pervading
stillness like that of mid-ocean on a calm day. Not one of us, I
think, but felt the vastness of this presence.</p>

<p>We had in view a low, barren-looking coast that appeared a
complete solitude, uninhabited and uninhabitable; and yet we knew,
from our experience of the day before, that a few bands of savages,
at least, must find sustenance there. We saw more of them before we
had sailed many miles.</p>

<p>A number of small islands were in sight to the northeast.
Captain Bligh directed our course between them and the main. The
strait was no more than a mile wide, and as we were passing through
it, a small party of savages like those we had already seen came
down to the foreshore on our left hand and stood regarding us.</p>

<p>"Now," said Bligh, "I mean to have a closer view of those
fellows."</p>

<p>Accordingly, we steered inshore and laid the boat as close as
was prudent to the rocks. Meanwhile, the savages, observing our
intent, had run away to a distance of about two hundred yards.</p>

<p>Bligh shouted: "Come aboard, there!" and stood in the stern
sheets waving a shirt aloft; but not a foot would they stir from
their places. They were without a vestige of cloathing, and their
bodies looked as black as ink in the clear morning light, against a
background of sand and naked rocks. Their timidity was encouraging
in our unarmed and weakened condition; we felt that we had little
to fear from any small bands of these people.</p>

<p>"They'll never come," said Nelson, after we had lain at our oars
shouting and beckoning to them. "It's a pity, too, for they seem
harmless enough, and they must have ways of getting food that would
be most valuable to us could we learn what they are."</p>

<p>"No, we may as well proceed," said Bligh. "I should like to see
them near at hand. Sir Joseph Banks is most anxious to have a
description of the savages of New Holland. He shall have to be
content with the little I can tell him of their general
appearance."</p>

<p>"That is a curious-looking instrument they carry in their left
hands," I observed. "What can its purpose be?"</p>

<p>"In my opinion, it is some sort of a spear thrower," said
Nelson. "One thing you can tell Sir Joseph," he added: "There are
probably no savages in all the South Sea more ugly and uncouth than
these. What a contrast they make to the Indians of Otaheite!"</p>

<p>We again hoisted sail, and steered for an island in view before
us and about four miles distant from the main. This we reached in
about an hour's time. The shore was rocky, but the water smooth. We
made a landing without difficulty, and secured our boat in a little
basin, where it rode in complete safety. We brought everything
ashore, that the boat might be thoroughly cleaned and
dried--putting our water vessels and the carpenter's chest, with
its precious supply of bread, in the shelter of some overhanging
rocks.</p>

<p>When we had scrubbed out the boat, Mr. Bligh told off two
parties to go in search of shellfish. Purcell was placed in charge
of one of these; the other members were Tinkler, Samuel, Smith, and
Hall. These men stood waiting for the carpenter, who had seated
himself on the beach with the air of one who meant to pass the day
there. The other party, in Peckover's charge, had already gone
southward along the beach. Captain Bligh, who had accompanied them
a little distance, now returned to where the boat lay.</p>

<p>"Come, Mr. Purcell," he said brusquely; "set out at once with
your men. We have no time to lose here."</p>

<p>The carpenter remained seated. "I've done more than my share of
work," he said, in a surly voice. "You can send someone else with
this party."</p>

<p>Bligh glared down at him. "Do you hear me?" he said. "Get you
gone, and quickly!"</p>

<p>The carpenter made no motion to obey. "I'm as good a man as
yourself," he replied; "and I'll stay where I am."</p>

<p>Nelson, the master, and myself, besides the members of the
foraging party, were the witnesses of this scene. I had long
expected something of the sort to happen, and had only wondered
that an open break between Captain Bligh and the carpenter had not
come before this time. There was a deep and natural antagonism
between the two men; they were too much alike in character ever to
have been anything but enemies.</p>

<p>Bligh strode across the beach to where the carpenter's chest had
been placed, with two of the cutlasses lying upon it. Seizing the
weapons, he returned to where Purcell sat and thrust one of them
into his hand.</p>

<p>"Now," he said. "Stand up and defend yourself. Stand up, I say!
If you are as good a man as myself, you shall prove it, here and
now!"</p>

<p>There was no doubt of the seriousness of Bligh's intent. Despite
the gravity of the situation, as I think of it now, there was
something faintly comic in it as well. In the mind's eye I have the
scene clearly in mind: The sandy spit of beach, backed by the naked
rocks; the little group of spectators, their cloathes hanging in
rags on their emaciated bodies, looking on at these two, who,
despite starvation and hardships incredible, still had fight in
them. At least, so I thought at first; but the carpenter quickly
showed that his relish for it was faint indeed. He rose, holding
his cutlass slackly, and gazed at Bligh with a frightened
expression.</p>

<p>"Stand back, you others!" said Bligh. "Up with your weapon, you
mutinous villain! I'll soon prove whether you are a man or
not!"</p>

<p><a name="0800411h-02" id="0800411h-02"></a>He advanced
resolutely toward the carpenter, who backed away at his
approach.</p>

<p>"Fight, damn you!" Bligh roared. "Defend yourself or I'll cut
you down as you stand!"</p>

<p>Purcell, although a larger man than Bligh, had little of the
latter's inner fire and strength. Bligh was thoroughly roused; and
had the carpenter tried to make good his boast, one or the other of
them would, I am convinced, have been killed--and I have little
doubt as to which would have been the victim. But Purcell made a
complete about-face, and ran from his pursuer, who halted and gazed
after him, breathing rapidly.</p>

<p>"Come back, Mr. Purcell!" he cried. "You have even less spirit
than I gave you credit for! Come here, sir!...Now then; do you
retract what you have said?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Purcell replied.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Bligh. "Let me have no more of your insolence
in the future. Get about your work."</p>

<p>It is to Bligh's credit that he never afterwards mentioned this
incident. As for the carpenter, he was willing enough to have it
forever put out of mind. He had, I believe, flattered himself that
he was a match for his commander. From this time on, the relations
of the two men were on a better footing.</p>

<p>The island upon which we had landed was of a considerable
height. While the foraging parties were out, Mr. Bligh, Nelson, and
myself walked inland to the highest part of it for a better view of
our surroundings; but we could see little more of the main than
appeared from below. In our weakened condition the climb had been a
fatiguing one, and we took shelter in the shade of a great rock to
recover our breath. The lagoons were miracles of vivid colouring in
the clear morning light. We could plainly see the tiny figures of
the foraging parties as they made their way slowly along the
shallows, searching for shellfish. Almost directly below us was the
launch, looking smaller than a child's toy in the bight where she
lay.</p>

<p>"There she lies," said Bligh, gazing fondly at the tiny craft.
"I love every strake of planking, every nail in her. Mr. Nelson,
could you have believed that she could have carried eighteen men
such a voyage as we have come? Could you, Mr. Ledward?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking of just that," Nelson replied. "We have been
under God's guidance. It must have been so."</p>

<p>"Aye," said Bligh, nodding gravely. "But God expected us to play
our part. We should not have had His help, otherwise."</p>

<p>"What distance have we come, in all, sir?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I have this morning reckoned it up," said Bligh. "I think I am
not far out in saying that we have sailed, from Tofoa to the
passage within the reefs of New Holland, a distance of two
thousand, three hundred and ninety miles."</p>

<p>"God be thanked that we have so much of the voyage behind us,"
said Nelson, fervently. "This leaves us with one thousand miles
ahead, does it not?"</p>

<p>"More than that," Bligh replied. "As nearly as I can recollect,
we have between one hundred and fifty and two hundred miles to
coast New Holland before we reach Endeavour Straits; but once again
in the open sea, we shall have no more than three hundred leagues
between us and Timor."</p>

<p>Nelson turned to me. "Ledward, how long can a man go, in the
ordinary course of nature, without passing stool?"</p>

<p>"Ten days is a long period under more normal circumstances," I
replied, "but our situation is anything but a usual one. We have
had so little food that our bodies seem to have absorbed the whole
of it."</p>

<p>"So I think," said Bligh. "There could have been nothing in our
bowels until within a day or two past. You look another man, Mr.
Nelson, now that you have had rest and better food. We shall all
have time to gain new strength before we push off for Timor."</p>

<p>"I mean to survive," Nelson replied, smiling faintly; "if only
to defeat the purpose of the wretches who condemned us to this
misery."</p>

<p>"Spoken like a man, sir," said Bligh. A cold glint came into his
eyes and his lips were set in a thin line. "By God! I could sail
the launch to England, if necessary, with nothing but water in my
belly, for the sake of bringing them to justice!"</p>

<p>He rose to his feet and strode back and forth across the little
flat-topped eminence where we rested; then he halted before us.
Pale, hollow-eyed, his shreds of cloathing hanging loosely upon his
bones, he yet had within him a fund of energy that amazed me.
Mention of the mutineers had stirred him as the call of a trumpet
stirs an old cavalry horse. He laughed in his harsh mirthless way.
"They flatter themselves that they have seen the last of me," he
said; "the Goddamned inhuman, black-hearted bastards! But Divine
Providence sees them and will help me to track them down!"</p>

<p>Nelson threw a quick, quizzical glance in my direction. Bligh
was quite unconscious of the mixture of blasphemy and reverence in
his remark.</p>

<p>"Shall you endeavour to search for them yourself?" Nelson
asked.</p>

<p>"Endeavour? By God, I shall more than endeavour! I shall sit on
the doorstep at the Admiralty day and night until they give me
command of the ship that is to search them out and bring them to
justice. I have friends at home who will make my interest their
own. I shall not draw a quiet breath until I am outward bound, on
their trail."</p>

<p>"Your family may take a different view of the matter, sir," I
said. "If we are fortunate enough to reach England, Mrs. Bligh will
not wish to let you go so soon again."</p>

<p>"You know me little, Mr. Ledward, if you think I shall dawdle at
home with those villains unhung. Not a day shall I spend there if I
have my way. As for Mrs. Bligh, she is no ordinary woman. She will
be the first to bid me Godspeed...Let us go down," he added, after
a moment of silence. "I grudge every moment that we are not
proceeding on our way."</p>

<p>Nelson and I rose to follow him. Bligh stood looking toward a
small sandy cay that could be seen at a considerable distance to
the northward, and several miles farther from the main than the
island upon which we then were.</p>

<p>"We shall go there for the night," he said. "It will be a safer
resting place. The savages yonder must have seen us land here. They
seem harmless enough; and yet, without weapons to defend ourselves,
I mean to take no risks."</p>

<p>We went down by another way, to the northern side of the island,
stopping now and then to examine the shrubs and stunted trees that
grew out of the sand and among clefts in the rocks. We found
nothing in the way of food except wild beans, which we gathered in
a handkerchief.</p>

<p>"You are sure these are edible, Mr. Nelson?" Bligh asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, there is not the slightest danger," Nelson replied. "They
are dolichos. The flavour is not all that might be wished, but the
bean is a nourishing food. It is of the genus of the kidney bean to
which the Indian gram belongs."</p>

<p>"Good," said Bligh. "Let us hope that the others have collected
some as well as ourselves."</p>

<p>Upon reaching the beach, we discovered an old canoe lying bottom
up and half buried in the sand. We dug away around it, but our
combined strength was not sufficient to budge it, to say nothing of
turning it over. It was about thirty feet long, with a sharp,
projecting bow, rudely carved in the resemblance of a fish's head.
We estimated that it would hold about twenty men.</p>

<p>"Here is proof enough," said Bligh, "that the New Hollanders are
not wholly landlubbers. In view of this find, I am all the more
willing to proceed farther from the main. We must keep a sharp
lookout for these fellows. In our weakened condition they would
find us an easy prey."</p>

<p>We were now joined by Purcell and his party of foragers,
carrying our copper pot on a pole between them. They had had
splendid luck--the pot was more than half full of fine, fat clams
and oysters. Bligh put the carpenter at ease by greeting him in his
usual manner.</p>

<p>"It couldn't be better, Mr. Purcell," he said. "Every man shall
have a bellyful to-day. A stew of these, mixed with dolicho
beans--many a ship's company will fare worse than ourselves this
day."</p>

<p>I was pleased to find a healthy hunger gnawing at my stomach;
nothing could have looked more succulent than the sea food, and
every man of us was eager to be at the camp with the pot set over a
good fire. It was high noon when we joined the others. Peckover's
party had just come in with a supply of clams and oysters almost
equal in amount to that in the pot. They had also found, on the
south side of the island, an abundance of fresh water in hollows of
the rocks--more than enough to fill our vessels. Every circumstance
favoured us. The sun shone in a cloudless sky, so that Captain
Bligh was able, with his magnifying glass, to kindle a fire at
once. The oysters and clams were now dumped into the pot, together
with a quart and a half of dolicho beans. The requisite amount of
water was added, and to make our stew yet more tasty, each man's
usual amount of bread was added to it. Smith and Hall, our cooks,
had whittled out long wooden spoons with which they stirred the
stew as it came to a boil, sending up a savoury steam that made the
walls of our empty bellies quiver with anticipation. When the stew
had cooked for a good twenty minutes,--the time had seemed hours to
most of us,--the pot was set off the fire; and we gathered round
with our half-coconut shells, while the cooks ladled into each
man's shell all that it could hold of clams, oysters, beans, and
delicious broth; and when all had been served, there was still
enough in the pot for a half pint more, all round. The beans were
not so tasty as we had hoped, but we made a small matter of
that.</p>

<p>After our meal we rested for an hour in the shade of the rocks.
I had just fallen into a refreshing sleep when Mr. Bligh aroused
me. "Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Ledward," he said, "but we must push
on. We are too close to the main here, and I have no desire for any
night visits from the savages."</p>

<p>It was then about mid-afternoon. With a light breeze, we
directed our course to a group of sandy cays which lay about five
leagues off the continental shore. Darkness had fallen before we
reached them and, as we could find no suitable landing place, we
came to a grapnel and remained in the launch until dawn. All
through the night we heard the cries of innumerable sea fowl, and
daylight showed us that one of the cays was a place of resort for
birds of the noddy kind. We found that we were on the westernmost
of four small islands, surrounded by a reef of rocks, and connected
with sand banks whose surface was barely above high tide. Within
them lay a mirrorlike lagoon with a small passage, into which we
brought the launch.</p>

<p>This place, so far from the main, seemed designed by nature as a
refuge for men in our condition. Captain Bligh named it "Lagoon
Island," and gladdened our hearts by informing us that he proposed
to spend the day and the following night here. Unfortunately, the
cays were little more than heaps of rock and sand, covered with
coarse grass and a sparse growth of bush and stunted trees; but
there were enough of these latter to protect us from the heat of
the sun.</p>

<p>Our forces were divided so that some could rest while others
searched for food. The lagoon abounded in fish; but try as we
would, we could catch none. This was a great trial; after repeated
unsuccessful efforts, we were forced to fall back upon oysters and
clams and the one vegetable which these islands afforded--dolicho
beans. Even the shellfish were not abundant here, and the party
sent in search of them returned at about ten in the morning with a
very small number, so that our dinner this day did little more than
aggravate our hunger. During the long voyage from Tofoa we had been
so cold and miserable the greater part of the time that the pangs
of hunger were kept in check. Furthermore, the constant peril of
the sea had prevented us from dwelling upon the thought of food.
The case was altered now, and we thought of little else.</p>

<p>After our midday dinner, Elpinstone, with a party of four, was
sent to the islet adjoining that at which we lay, to search for sea
fowl and their eggs, for we had observed that the birds congregated
at that place. The rest of us were glad enough to take our rest,
crawling into the shade of bushes and overhanging rocks.</p>

<p>On this afternoon I enjoyed a long and undisturbed sleep which
greatly refreshed me; indeed, I did not waken until near sundown,
just as Mr. Elphinstone's party was returning. They came in all but
empty-handed, having gotten no birds and only three eggs. This was,
evidently, not the nesting season: they had found the islet
practically deserted; the birds were away fishing for themselves,
and the few they had seen were too wary to be caught.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, we must try again," said Bligh. "They will soon
be coming home with full gullets. We can be sure of catching them
at night, and there will be a good light from the moon to hunt
by...Mr. Cole, you shall try this time. Go warily, mind! Let the
birds settle for the night before you go amongst them."</p>

<p>"Aye, sir, we'll see to that," said Cole. Samuel, Tinkler, Lamb,
and myself were told off to make up his party; and, having provided
ourselves with sticks, we set out for the bird island.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful evening, cool and fresh now that the sun had
set. There was not a breath of air stirring, and the surface of the
lagoons glowed with the colours of the western sky. Our way led
over a causeway of hard-packed sand, laid over the coral reef. It
was scarcely a dozen paces across, and curved in a wide arc across
a shallow sea filled with mushroom coral that rose to within a few
feet of the surface. The bar connecting the islands was about two
miles long. Tinkler and Lamb were soon far ahead; the boatswain,
Samuel, and I followed at a more leisurely pace, stopping to
examine the rock pools along the reef for clams and oysters, though
we found nothing save a few snails, scarcely larger than the end of
one's thumb. Nevertheless, we gathered them into the bread bag we
had brought to carry back the birds.</p>

<p>Whilst in Mr. Bligh's company we had been careful to make no
reference to the mutiny. On one occasion, I remember, young Tinkler
had ventured to speak in defense of two of the midshipmen who had
been left behind on the <i>Bounty</i>; but Bligh had silenced him
in such a manner that no one else was tempted to bring up the
subject in his presence. But now, the three of us, freed from
restraint, fell naturally into talk of the seizure of the ship and
of what had led up to it.</p>

<p>"What puzzles me," said Cole, "is that Mr. Christian could have
made his plan without any of us getting wind of it."</p>

<p>"It was a sudden resolve on his part, I am fairly certain of
that," I replied.</p>

<p>"That's my opinion," said Samuel. "No doubt the villain had
plotted it long before, but he bided his time before opening his
mind to the others."</p>

<p>Cole nodded. "Aye, it must have been so," he said. "What could
have brought him to such a mad act, Mr. Ledward? Can you reason it
out? He'd no better friend than Captain Bligh, and he must have
known it in his heart." He shook his head, wonderingly. "I'd a
liking for Mr. Christian," he added.</p>

<p>Samuel stopped short and gazed at the boatswain in a horrified
manner.</p>

<p>"'Liking,' Mr. Cole?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Aye," said Cole. "He was hot-tempered and anything but easy
under Mr. Bligh's correction; but I never doubted him a gentleman
and a loyal officer."</p>

<p>"His Majesty can well spare gentlemen of Christian's kidney from
his service," I replied. "You're too lenient in your judgments, Mr.
Cole. Whatever else may be said of him, Christian is an intelligent
man. He must have known that he was condemning us to all but
certain death."</p>

<p>"Begging your pardon, Mr. Ledward, I don't believe he did know
it. He must have been out of his mind...This I will say: Mr.
Christian will never again know peace. He'll have us on his
conscience till the day of his death."</p>

<p>"He'll hang," said Samuel, confidently. "Hide where he may,
Captain Bligh will find him and bring him to justice."</p>

<p>"Let that be as it will, Mr. Samuel," said Cole. "I'll warrant
he's been punished enough as it is."</p>

<p>"Do you think God could forgive him, Mr. Cole?" I asked, out of
curiosity more than for any other reason.</p>

<p>"He could, sir. There's no crime so black that God cannot
forgive it if a man truly repents."</p>

<p>"Have you forgiven him?" I then asked.</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment as he pondered this question. Then,
"No, sir," he replied, grimly. "He shall never have my forgiveness
for the wrong he has done Captain Bligh."</p>

<p>We were now close to the bird island. Tinkler alone was awaiting
us there.</p>

<p>"Where's Lamb, Mr. Tinkler?" Cole asked. "I told both of you to
wait for us."</p>

<p>"He was here a moment ago. I ordered him to help me look for
clams while we waited. I'm damned if I know where he's got to."</p>

<p>"It's your place to know, Mr. Tinkler," said Samuel shortly.
"Captain Bligh shall hear of this if anything goes wrong."</p>

<p>"Now don't be a telltale, Samuel, for God's sake," said Tinkler
anxiously. "What did you expect me to do--throw him down and sit on
his head? He can't have gone far."</p>

<p>"The man's a fool," said Samuel. "He's not to be trusted out of
sight."</p>

<p>"Aye," said Cole, "if there's a wrong way of doing a thing, Lamb
will find his way to it. We may as well wait here. There's time
enough."</p>

<p>No Lamb appeared, for all our waiting. The afterglow faded from
the sky, and the moon, nearing the full, shone with increasing
splendour, paling all but the brightest of the stars. The birds
must have sensed the presence of enemies, for they were long in
settling. They circled in thousands over the island, filling the
air with their grating cries, but at last the deafening clamour
died away and we ventured to proceed on our expedition. The island
was, roughly, a mile long and about half as wide, and the birds
appeared to have congregated for the night on the farthest part of
it. We separated to a distance of about fifty yards and had gone
but a little way when the air was again filled with their cries and
the moon all but darkened by their bodies. I could guess what had
happened: the precious Lamb, without waiting for us, had blundered
in amongst the birds, to the ruin of our plans. I saw Tinkler and
the boatswain break into a run. My own legs were not equal to the
added exertion; indeed, I had so little strength that I had drawn
to the limit of it in reaching the bird island, and it was all I
could now do to walk, to say nothing of running. By pure chance I
managed to knock down two noddies that circled low over my head.
One of them was only slightly hurt, and fluttered away from me, but
I at length managed to capture it. Having done so, I myself fell
down, completely exhausted. Shortly afterward I felt an attack of
tenesmus coming on, but to my surprise and relief I discovered that
I was evacuating, for the first time in thirty-three days. Perhaps
I should pass over this matter in silence; it is not, under
ordinary circumstances, one to be referred to; but members of my
own profession will understand the interest I took both in the
performance of a function so long delayed, and the result of it.
The excrement was something curious to see--hard, round pellets not
so large as sheep's turds, and looking perfectly black in the
moonlight. The amount was woefully small, and yet I believe that it
was all my bowels contained at that time. It confirmed me in the
opinion I had ventured to Mr. Nelson--that our bodies had absorbed
all but an infinitesimal amount of the little nourishment they had
received.</p>

<p>With my two precious birds, I now walked feebly on after my
companions, whom I at length found in one spot, gathered around the
crouching form of the recreant Lamb.</p>

<p>"Look at this wretch, Mr. Ledward!" Samuel shouted, his voice
trembling with rage. "Do you see what he has done?"</p>

<p>Cole said nothing, but stood with his arms folded, gazing at the
man. Overhead, the noddies circled about in thousands; but they
were far beyond reach. Their cries were all but deafening; we had
to shout to make ourselves heard.</p>

<p>But no words were needed to tell me the tale of what had
happened. Lamb's face and hands were smeared with blood, and around
him lay the gnawed carcasses of nine birds which he had caught and
devoured. I must do him the credit to say that he had made a good
job of them; scarcely anything remained but feathers, bones, and
entrails. He was making some whining appeal that could not be heard
above the tumult of birds' cries. Of a sudden the boatswain gave
him a cuff that knocked him sprawling at full length in the sand.
Then Mr. Cole bent over him. "Stop here!" he roared. "If you move
from this spot, you rogue, I'll thrash you within an inch of your
life!"</p>

<p>We continued a quest that was now all but hopeless. The birds
were thoroughly alarmed, and although we waited for a full two
hours, they would not again settle. A few ventured down, but before
we could reach them they would take wing again. We caught but
twelve in all, though we should have returned with our bag
filled.</p>

<p>We trudged back slowly, worn out with the fatigue of the journey
and reluctant to reach our camp, for we well knew how bitter would
be the disappointment of those awaiting our return. This was the
first bird island we had met with, and we had looked forward to a
meal of roasted sea fowl with an expectation that might have been
laughable had it not been so pathetic.</p>

<p>Mr. Cole carried the hag, driving Lamb on before him. The man
persisted in his abject entreaties, begging that nothing be said of
the matter to Mr. Bligh:--</p>

<p>"I was out o' me head, Mr. Cole. I was, straight. I was that
starved--</p>

<p>"Starved?" said Samuel. "And what of the rest of us, you bloody
thief? Out of your head! You can tell that to Captain Bligh!" The
boatswain halted. "Mr. Samuel, we'd best not let him know the whole
truth of it."</p>

<p>"What?" exclaimed Samuel. "Would you shield such a villain? When
he's robbed some of us, it may be, of the very chance of life?"</p>

<p>"It's not that I'd shield him," said Cole, "but I'd be ashamed
to let Captain Bligh know what a poor thing we've got amongst
us."</p>

<p>"He knows already," Samuel replied. "Hasn't the man been a dead
weight to us all the way from Tofoa? He's done nothing but lie and
whine in the bottom of the boat all the voyage. We've him to thank,
I'll be bound, for the stolen pork!"</p>

<p>"I didn't touch it, sir! I didn't!"</p>

<p>"You did, you rogue! It must have been you! There's none but
yourself would have been such a cur as to steal from his
shipmates!" He was, in all truth, a wretched creature, the
inestimable Lamb. I have little doubt that Samuel was right in
surmising that he was the thief of the pork. But as that was gone,
and the birds as well, I agreed with Cole that nothing was to be
gained by disclosing Lamb's gorge of raw bird flesh. Tinkler sided
with us, and Samuel at length agreed to keep that point a
secret.</p>

<p>"But Captain Bligh shall know whose fault it was that the birds
were frightened," he said.</p>

<p>"Aye," said Cole. "We owe it to ourselves that that should be
told." And so it was agreed.</p>

<p>Captain Bligh was, of course, furious. He took the man's bird
stick and thrashed him soundly with it; and never was punishment
more richly deserved.</p>

<p>We were a sad company that evening. A fire of coals had been
carefully tended against our return, when the fowls were to be
roasted, and every man had promised himself at least two of the
birds. But when Mr. Bligh saw the miserable result of our
expedition, although the twelve birds were dressed and cooked, they
were carefully packed away for future use; and we had for supper
water, the handful of sea snails we had found, and a few oysters.
Elphinstone and Hayward were then set at watch, and the rest of us
lay down to sleep.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that I had no more than closed my eyes when I
was aroused to find the island in a glare of light. The night was
chill and the master had kindled a fire for himself at a distance
from the rest of us. Some coarse dry grass which covered the island
had caught from this, and the fire spread rapidly, burning fiercely
for a time. It was the last straw for Mr. Bligh. We made a vain
effort to beat out the flames, and when at last they had burned
themselves out, he gave the company in general, and Mr. Fryer in
particular, a dressing down that lasted for the better part of a
quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>"You, sir," he roared at Fryer, "who should set an example with
myself to all the rest, are a disgrace to your calling! You are the
most incompetent bloody rascal of the company! Mark my words! We'll
have the savages on us as a result of this! And serve you right if
we do! What are you worth, the lot of you? A more useless set of
rogues it has never been my misfortune to command! I send you out
for birds, to an island where they congregate in thousands. You
frighten them like a lot of children, and get none. I send you out
for shellfish. You get none. I set you to fishing. You get none.
And yet you expect me to feed you! And if I close my eyes for ten
minutes, you're up to some deviltry that may be the ruination of us
all! And you expect me to take you safe to Timor! By God, if I do,
it will be thanks to none of you!"</p>

<p>He quieted down presently. "Get you to sleep," he said gruffly.
"This may be our last night ashore till the end of the voyage, so
make the most of it."</p>

<p>I lay awake for some time. Nelson, who was lying beside me,
turned presently to whisper in my ear.</p>

<p>"What a man he is, Ledward," he said. "It comforted me to see
him in a passion again. We'll fetch Timor. I did him a great
injustice ever to doubt it."</p>

<p>I had precisely the same feeling, and I thanked God, inwardly,
that Bligh and no other was in command of the <i>Bounty's</i>
launch.</p>

<h2><a name="c11" id="c11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p>We were astir before daylight, greatly refreshed by six or seven
hours of sleep. Mr. Bligh awoke in the best of humours, intending
to embark immediately, but was irritated when he found that Lamb
was too ill to go into the launch.</p>

<p>"What ails the fellow, Mr. Ledward?" he asked, looking down at
the man with an expression of disgust.</p>

<p>Lamb was doubled up with cramps from his gorge of the night
before; there was no doubting the pain he suffered. I was tempted
to let Bligh know the truth of the matter, for my impatience with
this worse than useless fellow was equal to his own. I refrained,
however, and was about to purge him when he was seized with a
violent flux. Half an hour later he was carried into the boat and
we proceeded on our way.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful morning, with cloudless sky, and a fresh
breeze at E.S.E. This part of the coast of New Holland lies, as our
sailors would say, "in the eye of the southeast trades"; and during
the time we sailed within the reefs we had constantly a fine, fresh
sailing breeze abaft the beam.</p>

<p>Mr. Fryer was at the tiller. Captain Bligh sat beside him with
his journal open on his knees, engaged in his usual occupation of
charting the coast. He glanced frequently at the compass to obtain
bearings on the points, indentations and landmarks ashore; at short
intervals, without raising his eyes from his work, he would order
"Heave the log," and make a note of the launch's speed. Nelson had
told me, what I could readily believe, that Captain Cook, in spite
of Bligh's youth at that time, considered him among the most
skilled cartographers in England. And I am confident that the
officer who will one day be appointed to make a thorough survey of
this coast will be amazed at the accuracy of Bligh's chart, drawn
with only his sextant, a compass, and a rude log to aid him, in the
stern sheets of a twenty-three-foot boat, sailing fast to the north
with scarcely a halt.</p>

<p>All the time we sailed within the reefs of New Holland, Bligh
was absorbed in this work, to such an extent that for hours at a
time he seemed to forget our very presence. Mr. Bligh was an
explorer born, but his interest was less in the strange people and
natural curiosities to be found than in the charting of new coasts.
I feel assured that there were entire hours within the reefs when
he forgot the <i>Bounty</i>, forgot the mutiny, forgot that he was
in a small unarmed boat, half starved, at the mercy of savage
tribes, and hundreds of leagues from the nearest European
settlement. His expression of interest and happiness at these times
was such that it was a pleasure merely to look at his face.</p>

<p>We had sailed about two leagues to the northward when a heavy
swell began to set in from the east, leading us to suppose that
there must be a break in the reefs which protect most of this
shore. The sea continued rough as we passed between a shoal, on
which were two sandy cays, and two other islets four miles to the
west. Toward midday we sailed past six other cays covered with
fresh green scrub and contrasting with the main, which now appeared
barren, with sand hills along the coast. A flat-topped hill abreast
of us, Captain Bligh named "Pudding-Pan Hill"; and two rounded
hills, a little to the north, he called "The Paps." At two hours
before sunset we passed a large inlet, which Bligh longed to
explore. It appeared to be the entrance to a safe and commodious
harbour.</p>

<p>Three leagues to the northward of this inlet, we found a small
island where we decided to spend the night. The sea was rough, the
wind was now making up in gusts, and there was a strong current
setting to the north. Though well wooded, with low scrub, the
island appeared the merest pile of rocks, with only one poor
landing place in the lee of a point. A shark of monstrous
proportions swam alongside the boat for some time while we
approached the land, and as we rounded the point, some of the
people saw a large animal resembling a crocodile pass under the
boat.</p>

<p>"Bigger'n the launch, he was," said Cole when the captain
questioned him; "with four legs and a great long tail. A crocodile,
ye can lay to that, sir."</p>

<p>It was a wretched anchorage, for the coral dropped in a vertical
wall from the surface to a depth of two fathoms, and the bottom was
very foul. The wind was making up, and the current swept in fast
around the point.</p>

<p>Laying the boat alongside the rocks, Captain Bligh ordered Fryer
and some of the people to spend the night on shore, since the
anchorage was too uncertain for all to leave the boat in such
weather. As we drifted fast to leeward, the grapnel was dropped. It
dragged for a moment, and presently held as scope was paid out;
then, as the weight of the launch fetched up against it, the line
parted suddenly.</p>

<p>"Enough scope, you fools!" roared Bligh, not knowing what had
happened. "Damn you, boatswain! What are you about, there?"</p>

<p>"We've lost the grapnel, sir!" Cole shouted.</p>

<p>"To the oars!"</p>

<p>The men ran out their oars and pulled with a will, for they
realized as well as the captain the dangers of being blown
off-shore on such a night. Their utmost exertions were just
sufficient to gain slowly against current and wind. Bligh made his
way forward where Cole was examining the broken line.</p>

<p>"A rotten spot, sir," said the boatswain; "the rust of the
grapnel did it." He opened his clasp knife and cut away the rotten
line. Bligh was peering down into the water ahead. "Hold her here!'
he ordered without turning his head."</p>

<p>There was something ominous about the place, and the wild red
sunset; the thought of the monsters we had seen so short a time
before would have deterred most men from doing what Bligh now did.
He stripped off his ragged shirt and trousers, seized the end of
the grapnel line, and plunged into the sea.</p>

<p>Cole gazed after him anxiously; then, seeing that the people had
stopped rowing for a moment in their astonishment, he roared
out:--"Pull, I say! Do you want to drag the line out of the
captain's hands? Pull, damn your blood!"</p>

<p>He was paying out line as he shouted, and gazing earnestly down
into the water. Captain Bligh came to the surface, drew three or
four long breaths, and dived once more. Nearly a minute passed
before he reappeared. This time he swam to the stern of the boat
and pulled himself aboard. For a moment or two he sat on the
gunwale, breathing rapidly.</p>

<p>"By God, sir," I remarked. "I'm glad you did not ask me to
dive." He laughed grimly. "I was none too eager to go down; but
I'll ask no one to do what I fear to do myself. The thought of the
monstrous shark was never out of my mind." He shivered. "Nelson,
what was that other thing we saw--a crocodile?"</p>

<p>"I've little doubt of it," Nelson replied. "Captain Cook saw
what he believed were crocodiles in these waters."</p>

<p>Bligh shivered in spite of himself. "I'm as glad to be in the
boat again," he said. "We are in a bad position here, and these
currents are the devil; they seem to set four ways at once."</p>

<p>"You were fortunate to get down to the grapnel, sir," said
Peckover. "Aye, Mr. Peckover, the Indians of Otaheite are the men
for that work. I managed to get the line rove through its ring
before I had to come up to blow; but one of them would have stopped
down to bend it on. We whites are good for nothing under
water."</p>

<p>Dusk was setting in, and we profited by what remained of
daylight to eat our small portions of the half-dressed birds left
over from those obtained on Lagoon Island. In the strong wind and
current, the boat rode uneasily to her grapnel, and we passed a
wretched night. The moon, close on to the full, set sometime before
daylight; in the first gray of dawn, Captain Bligh and some of the
rest of us landed to see what we could obtain on shore, leaving
Cole and Peckover in charge of the launch.</p>

<p>Nelson had passed a pretty comfortable night in the lee of some
rocks; I found him awake, and he and I set out to explore the far
side of the island. As we crossed through the scrub, we found the
backs of many turtles, some of great size, and the fireplaces where
the Indians had roasted the flesh. I was engaged in a futile search
for clams on a small, sandy beach exposed to the east wind, when I
heard Nelson shout.</p>

<p>I swung about, and saw him trying to turn over a turtle of
immense size, which had just emerged from behind some bushes and
was making her way to the water's edge.</p>

<p>"<i>Ledward!</i>" he shouted again, in an agonized voice.</p>

<p>In an instant I was at his side, but our combined strength was
not enough to raise one side of the turtle from the sand. All the
time we struggled to turn her, she was plying her flippers
desperately, sending showers of sand over us and moving rapidly
toward the sea, only a few yards distant. Her strength was
prodigious; she must have weighed not less than four hundred
pounds. Perceiving the impossibility of turning her, we gave up the
attempt, and seized a hind flipper each, holding back with all our
might. But she had reached the damp sand by now, where her powerful
fore flippers could obtain a hold, and in spite of our utmost
exertions she dragged us, little by little, into the sea. Through
the shallows she went, while our grips weakened; then suddenly, as
she plunged into deep water, we were forced to let go.</p>

<p>Panting, and wet from head to foot, we had barely the strength
to make our way back to the sand. Once there, we sank down side by
side. After a long silence Nelson looked up at me with a wry
smile.</p>

<p>"That was tragedy! There was a fortnight's food in the beast,
Ledward!"</p>

<p>"All of that," I replied. "She may have laid some eggs. Let us
go and search."</p>

<p>Nelson shook his head. "No. I surprised her as she was beginning
to dig. She had just come up from the sea, for her back was still
wet."</p>

<p>We fell silent once more, and at last he said: "We'll say
nothing of this to the others, eh, Ledward?"</p>

<p>We walked slowly back across the island, halting on a bit of
rising ground to rest. A little to the left we could see the others
gathered on the beach near the launch. Nelson lay back for a
moment, his hands behind his head, and stretched out his legs at
full length.</p>

<p>"You'd best follow my example," he said. "It may be the last
chance we shall have."</p>

<p>"The last? Surely not!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Bligh thinks we shall be clear of the coast by to-morrow or the
day after."</p>

<p>I managed to smile somewhat dubiously. "Between ourselves,
Nelson, I'll confess that no man in the boat can dread the prospect
more than I."</p>

<p>"Dread it? I positively quake at the thought! God help us if we
have any more nights like those on the way to New Holland!"</p>

<p>We found Bligh awaiting us. The others had obtained nothing, so
he hailed the launch, and we soon set sail. The main at this place
bore from S.E. to N.N.W. half W., and a high, flat-topped island
lay to the north, four or five leagues distant.</p>

<p>On passing this island, we found a great opening in the coast,
set with a number of mountainous islands. To the north and west the
country was high, wooded, and broken, with many islands close in
with the land. We were now steering more and more to the west, and
Captain Bligh informed us that he was tolerably certain we should
be clear of the coast of New Holland in the course of the
afternoon.</p>

<p>Toward two o'clock, as we were steering toward the westernmost
part of the main now in sight, we fell in with a vast sandy shoal
which extends out many miles to sea, and were obliged to haul our
wind to weather it. Bligh named the place "Shoal Cape." Just before
dark we passed a small island, or rock, on which innumerable
boobies were roosting. There was no land in sight to the north,
south, or west.</p>

<p><br>
&gt;Three hundred leagues of empty sea now lay between us and
Timor.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>The six days we had spent within the reefs of New Holland had
allowed us to sleep in some comfort at night, and to refresh
ourselves with what little the islands afforded. And, above all,
the barriers of coral shielded us from the attacks of our old
enemy, the sea.</p>

<p>But the sea had not forgotten us, and lay in wait, on the far
side of Shoal Cape, armed with strong gales from the east and
deluges of rain, unabated for seven days. On the misery of that
week I shall not dwell.</p>

<p>On the morning of June tenth, I was lying doubled up in the
stern sheets. Lamb, Simpson, and Nelson were in a state as bad as
my own; and Lebogue, the <i>Bounty's</i> sailmaker, once the
hardiest of old seamen, lay forward with closed eyes. His legs were
swollen in a shocking manner, and his flesh had lost its
elasticity; when it was pinched or squeezed, the impression of
one's fingers remained clear.</p>

<p>The breeze was still fresh, though the sea had moderated during
the night, and only two men were at the bails. Elphinstone was
steering, with Bligh at his side. The countenances of both men
looked hollow as those of spectres; but while the master's mate
stared at the compass dully, the captain's eyes were calm. Our
fishing line was made fast close behind Bligh. We had towed it
constantly, day and night, for more than three thousand miles
without catching a fish, though Cole and Peckover had exhausted
their ingenuity in devising a variety of lures made from feathers
and rags. Peckover had seized a new one on our hook the night
before, employing the feathers of a booby Captain Bligh had caught
with his own hands on the fifth--the only bird we had secured since
leaving New Holland.</p>

<p>Bemused with weakness, I happened to glance at the line. We were
sailing at not less than four knots at the time, and I was
surprised to observe that the line, instead of towing behind us,
ran out at right angles to the boat. For a moment I did not realize
the significance of this. Then I said, in the best voice I could
muster: "A fish!"</p>

<p>Mr. Bligh started, seized the line, rose to his feet, and began
to haul in hand-over-hand, with a strength that surprised me.</p>

<p>"By God, lads," he exclaimed, "this one shan't get away!"</p>

<p>It was a dolphin of about twenty pounds' weight. The captain
brought it in leaping and splashing, swung it over the gunwale, and
fell to the floor boards, clasping it to his chest.</p>

<p>"Your knife, Mr. Peckover!" he called, never for an instant
relaxing his hold on the struggling fish.</p>

<p>In an instant the gunner had cut the cord beneath the gills, but
Mr. Bligh held fast to the dolphin while it blazed with the
changing colours of death and its shuddering grew weaker, till it
lay still and limp. The captain rose weakly, rinsed his hands over
the side, and sat down once more, breathing fast. Peckover looked
at him admiringly.</p>

<p>"No use his trying them jumping-jack tricks on you, sir!" he
said.</p>

<p>"You've Mr. Ledward to thank," said Bligh. "We've towed so long
without luck, that I'll be bound no other man would have noticed
it!" Peckover was gazing down longingly at the bulging side of the
fish, and Bligh went on: "Aye, divide him up--guts, liver, and
all."</p>

<p>Peckover knelt beside the fish, muttering to himself as he laid
out imaginary lines of division, and then changed his mind. At last
he began to cut. The people watched this operation with an
eagerness which might have been laughable under happier
circumstances. Only Elphinstone, at the tiller, had preserved an
attitude of indifference throughout the affair, gazing vacantly at
the compass and up at the horizon from time to time.</p>

<p>Under Bligh's direction, the gunner divided the fish into
thirty-six shares, each of about half a pound. Eighteen of these
were now distributed by our method of "Who shall have this?" A fine
steak fell to me; the captain got the liver and about two ounces of
flesh. Lebogue shook his head feebly when his share was offered
him, and whispered: "I'm past eatin', lad."</p>

<p>I managed to turn on my side when Tinkler handed me my fish in a
coconut shell, but I was now in such a state that the sight of raw
flesh revolted my stomach. Seeing that Nelson felt the same, I did
my best to make a pretense of eating before stowing my shell away
out of sight. I am not of a rugged constitution, and it irked me to
be so feeble when others were still able to bail and work the
sails. Nelson was close beside me, and he said in a low voice:
"Damme, Ledward, I cannot eat the fish."</p>

<p>"Nor I," I replied.</p>

<p>"No matter, we'll soon raise Timor."</p>

<p>"Mr. Samuel," said Bligh, "issue a spoonful of wine to those who
are weakest."</p>

<p>He was eating the dolphin's liver, and I could see that he
relished the food no more than I. But he forced himself sternly,
mouthful by mouthful, to chew and swallow it.</p>

<p>Toward noon, the wind shifted from E.S.E. to nearly northeast,
forcing us to lower our sails and raise them on the starboard tack.
Then a black rain squall bore down on us, filling our kegs and
permitting us to drink our fill. Those who were able wrung out
their sodden rags in salt water, and performed the same office for
their weaker mates. The sky was clouded over, and though there was
a long swell from the east, the wind was light and we shipped
little water over the stern. The boatswain was staring aft.</p>

<p>"Look, sir!" he exclaimed suddenly to Bligh.</p>

<p>Several of the people turned their heads; as I raised myself a
little to look, I heard Hallet say: "What's that?"</p>

<p>Directly in our wake and not more than a quarter of a mile away,
a black cloud hung low over the sea, with a sagging point that
approached the water in a curious, jerking fashion. And just
beneath, the surface of the sea was agitated as if by a small
maelstrom. Little by little, the sea rose in a conical point,
making a rushing, roaring noise that was now plainly audible;
little by little, the cloud sagged down to meet it. Then suddenly
the sea and cloud met in a whirling column which lengthened as the
cloud above seemed to rise rapidly.</p>

<p>"Only a waterspout," said Bligh, after a glance aft. "Look
alive, if I give the word."</p>

<p>For a time it seemed to remain stationary, growing taller and
thicker as if gathering its force. Then it began to move, bearing
straight down on us.</p>

<p>"Bear up," Bligh ordered the helmsman quietly. "Aye, so!" And,
as the sails began to slat, "To the sheets, lads! Trim them
flat!"</p>

<p>We changed our course not a moment too soon. The cloud, now
overhead, was as black as ink, with a kind of greenish pallor at
its heart; we had not sailed fifty yards, close-hauled, when the
waterspout passed astern of us, a sight of awe-inspiring
majesty.</p>

<p>All hands save Mr. Bligh stared at it in silent consternation.
The column of water, many hundreds of feet high and thicker than
the greatest oak in England, had a clear, glassy look and seemed to
revolve with incredible rapidity. At its base, the sea churned and
roared with a sound that would have made a loud shout inaudible. I
doubt if any man in the boat was greatly afraid; we had gone
through so much, and were so reduced by our sufferings, that death
had become a matter of little moment. But even in my own state of
weakness, I trembled in awe at this manifestation of God's majesty
upon the deep. Not a word was spoken till the waterspout was half a
mile distant and Bligh ordered the course changed once more.</p>

<p>"Ledward," remarked Nelson coolly, in a weak voice, "I wouldn't
have missed that for a thousand pounds!"</p>

<p>"I have seen many of them," said Bligh, "though never so close.
There's little danger, save at night..."</p>

<p>He shut his mouth suddenly and bent double in a spasm of pain.
Next moment his head was over the gunwale while he retched and
vomited. After a long time he rinsed his mouth with sea water, and
sat up ghastly pale.</p>

<p>"Some water, Mr. Samuel," he managed to say. "Aye, a full half
pint."</p>

<p>The water sent him to the gunwale once more, and during the
remainder of the afternoon Mr. Bligh was in a pitiable state. I
believe that the liver of the dolphin must have been poisonous, as
is said often to be the case; though it may be that Bligh had
reached the state I was in, in which the exhausted stomach can no
longer accept food. Though constantly retching and vomiting, and
suffering from excruciating cramps, he refused to lie down; he kept
an eye on our course between his paroxysms, and directed the
trimming of the sails. At sunset he took a spoonful of wine, which
his stomach retained, and seemed better for it.</p>

<p>Though I no longer felt hunger or much pain, the night seemed
interminably long. The moon came up at about ten o'clock, dead
astern of us, and shone full in my face. I dozed, awoke, attempted
to stretch my cramped legs, and dozed again. Sometimes I heard
Nelson muttering in his sleep. The captain managed to doze for a
time in the early hours of the night; when the moon was about two
hours up, he relieved Fryer at the helm. The moon was at its
zenith, from which I judged the time to be four in the morning,
when Bligh roused Elphinstone, and again lay down to sleep. The
wind was at east, and though the moonlight paled the stars, I could
see the Southern Cross on our larboard beam.</p>

<p>I had said nothing to the others of my fears, but for a day or
two past I had had reason to suspect that Elphinstone's mind was
giving way under the strain. He was as little wasted in body as any
man in the launch, yet his vacant eye, his lack of interest in what
went on about him, and his strange gestures and mutterings were
symptoms of a failing mind, although there was no reason to think
him unequal to his duties. When Bligh took him by the shoulder to
waken him, he said "Aye, sir!" in a dull voice, and took the tiller
mechanically.</p>

<p>It was Peckover's watch; turning my head, I could see him seated
with some others forward. His shoulders were bowed, and from time
to time he nodded and caught himself, making heroic efforts to stay
awake. A continual sound of faint groans and mutterings came from
the men asleep in the bottom of the launch; dreamless sleep had
been unknown to us for many days. Soon Bligh began to snore gently
and irregularly.</p>

<p>Elphinstone sat motionless at the tiller, staring ahead with a
vacant expression on his face. I could see his lips move as he
muttered to himself, but could hear no sound. Then for a time I
dozed.</p>

<p>It was still night when I awoke, though close to dawn. The
master's mate was hunched at the helm, seeming scarcely to have
moved since I glanced at him last. For a time I noticed nothing out
of the way; then, looking over the gunwale, I perceived that the
Cross was no longer on our beam. It was on the larboard bow; our
course had been changed from west to southwest. Elphinstone leaned
toward me.</p>

<p>"The land!" he whispered eagerly. "Yonder, dead ahead! Take
care! Don't waken Mr. Bligh!"</p>

<p>I struggled with some difficulty into a position which enabled
me to look forward. Peckover and the others sat sleeping, bowed on
the thwarts. Ahead of the launch was only the vast moonlit sea, and
an horizon empty save for a few scattered clouds.</p>

<p>"Timor," whispered Elphinstone, triumphantly. "God's with us,
Mr. Ledward! He caused the wind to shift to the northeast, so we're
dead before it still. You see it now, eh? The mountains and the
great valleys? A fine island, I'll be bound, where we'll find all
we need!"</p>

<p>He spoke with such sincerity that I looked ahead once more,
beginning to doubt my own eyes; but I saw only the roll of the
empty sea under the moon. Bligh stirred and struggled to a sitting
position. He took in the situation at a glance.</p>

<p>"What's this, Mr. Elphinstone?" he said in a harsh voice. "Who
ordered you to change the course?"</p>

<p>"The land, Captain Bligh! Look ahead! I steered for it when I
sighted the mountains an hour ago."</p>

<p>Bligh swung about to stare over the sea. "Land?" he said, as if
doubting the evidence of his own senses. "Where?"</p>

<p>"Dead ahead, sir. Can't you see the great valley yonder, and the
high ridge above? It looks an island as rich as Otaheite!"</p>

<p>Bligh gave me a quick glance. "Go forward, Mr. Elphinstone," he
ordered. "Lie down at once and get some sleep."</p>

<p>To my surprise, the master's mate said no more about the land,
but gave the tiller to Bligh and made his way forward amongst the
sleeping men. His face wore the mild, vacant expression of a man
walking in his sleep.</p>

<p>"Mr. Peckover!" called Bligh harshly.</p>

<p>The gunner started a little and straightened his back slowly.
"Aye, aye, sir!" he said.</p>

<p>"Don't let me catch you sleeping on watch again! You and those
with you might have been the ruin of us all!" The other members of
the watch were stirring, and the captain went on: "I'm going to
wear. To the halyards! Get her on the starboard tack!"</p>

<p>When the halyards had been slacked away and the yards of our
lugsails passed around to the larboard sides of the masts, Bligh
bore up to the west, and the men trimmed the sails to the northeast
wind.</p>

<p>This day, the eleventh of June, seemed the longest of my life.
They had eaten the last of the dolphin the night before, and at
sunrise a quarter of a pint of water and our usual allowance of
bread were issued. I drank the water, but could not eat the bread.
The captain made a grimace in spite of himself as he raised his
morsel of bread to his mouth, but he munched it heroically,
nevertheless, and contrived to keep it down. The boatswain had
administered a spoonful of wine to Lebogue, and was coming to do
the like for Nelson and me. Stepping over the after thwart with the
bottle in his hand, he came face to face with Bligh, while an
expression of horror came into his eyes.</p>

<p>"Sir," he said solicitously, "ye look worse'n any man in the
launch. Ye'd best have a drop o' this."</p>

<p>Bligh smiled at the old fellow's simplicity, and said: "I'll pay
you a handsomer compliment, Mr. Cole: you have lasted better than
many of the younger men...No, no wine for me. There are those who
need it more."</p>

<p>Cole touched his forelock and turned to serve me, shaking his
head.</p>

<p>I lay half dozing whilst the sun crawled interminably toward the
zenith. Sometimes I opened my eyes after what seemed the passage of
hours, only to discover that the shadow of the helmsman had
shortened by no more than an inch. My whole life, up to the time we
had left Tofoa, seemed but an instant beside the eternity I had
spent in the boat, and on this day, after a long process of slowing
down, I felt that time had come to a halt at last: I had always
been sailing west before a fresh easterly breeze, with the sun
stationary and low behind the launch, and would sail thus forever
and ever, on a limitless plain of tossing blue, unbroken by any
land. And Mr. Bligh would always hold the tiller--a scarecrow clad
in grotesque rags, with a turban made of an old pair of trousers on
his head.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>Noon came at last, and Cole took the tiller while the master and
Peckover held Bligh up to take the altitude of the sun. Owing to
his own weakness and that of the men supporting him, he had
difficulty in getting his sight; though not breaking, the sea was
confused, and the launch tossed and pitched uncertainly. After some
time, he handed his sextant to the master and sat down to work out
our position. Finally he looked up.</p>

<p>"Our latitude is nine degrees, forty-one minutes south," he
said; "that of the middle portion of Timor. By my reckoning, we
have traversed thirteen and one-half degrees of longitude since
leaving Shoal Cape,--more than eight hundred miles,--and to the
best of my recollection the most easterly part of Timor is laid
down in one hundred and twenty-eight degrees east longitude, a
meridian we must have passed."</p>

<p>"When shall we raise the land, sir?" the boatswain asked.</p>

<p>"During the night or early in the morning. We must keep a sharp
lookout to-night."</p>

<p>Toward sunset, when I awoke from a long doze, there were great
numbers of sea birds about. Lying on my back, I could see them
passing and repassing overhead. Tinkler contrived to strike down
one booby with the spare yard we had cut at Restoration Island, but
the others took warning at this and avoided the boat. The bird was
reserved for the next day, but I was offered a wineglass of its
blood, which I managed to swallow only to vomit it up instantly.
There was much rock weed around us, and coconut husks so fresh that
they were still bright yellow in colour.</p>

<p>Darkness came, and still the wind held steady and fair. Every
man able to sit up was on the thwarts, staring out over the tossing
sea ahead, dimly visible in the light of the stars.</p>

<p>Like a sentient being, aware that the end of her long journey
was at hand, the launch now seemed to surpass herself. With all
sail set and drawing, she raced westward, shipping so little water
that there was little need to bail. Sometimes the people were
silent; sometimes I heard them speaking in low tones. I was aware
of an undercurrent of new courage and confidence, of deep
contentment that our trials were so nearly at an end. Not once
during the long voyage had their faith in Mr. Bligh waned; he had
declared that we should raise the land by morning, and that was
enough.</p>

<p>It must have been nearly eleven o'clock when the moon rose,
directly astern of the launch: a bright half-moon, sailing a
cloudless sky. Hour after hour, as the moon climbed the heavens,
the launch ran westward, whilst we listened to the crisp sound of
water rushing under her keel.</p>

<p>Even old Lebogue revived a little at this time. No man of us had
endured more grievous suffering, and yet he had borne his part in
the work when others no weaker than himself lay helpless.</p>

<p>Bligh had taken the tiller at midnight, after an attempt to
sleep; and toward three in the morning, when the moon was high
above the horizon astern, young Tinkler stepped up on to the after
thwart to peer ahead. He stood there for some time, swaying to the
motion of the boat, with hands cupped above his eyes. Then he
sprang down to face the captain.</p>

<p>"The land, sir!" he exclaimed in a shaking voice.</p>

<p>Bligh motioned Fryer to take the helm, and stood up. I heard a
burst of talk forward: "Only a cloud!"</p>

<p>"No, no! Land, and high land too!" Then, as the launch reared
high on a swell, we saw the shadowy outlines of the land ahead:
pale, lofty, and unsubstantial in the light of the moon, a great
island still many miles distant, stretching far away to the
northeast and southwest. The captain stared ahead long and
earnestly before he spoke.</p>

<p>"Timor, lads!" he said.</p>

<h2><a name="c12" id="c12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p>There were some who doubted the landfall, who could not believe
that the goal of our voyage was actually in sight. For all Mr.
Bligh's quiet assurance, and the boatswain's repeated "Aye, lad!
There's the land--never a doubt of it!" they dared not believe,
lest day should come and the dim outlines melt into the shapes of
distant clouds. We hauled on a wind to the northeast, and those who
could stood on the thwarts from time to time, their confidence in
what they saw increasing from moment to moment. Some could do no
more than raise themselves to a sitting position in the bottom of
the launch, clinging to the thwarts or to the gunwales as they
stared ahead.</p>

<p>Veil after veil of moonlit obscurity was drawn aside, and at
last, in the clear light of early dawn, there it lay: Paradise
itself, it seemed, its lofty outlines filling half the circle of
the horizon, bearing from S.W. to N.E. by E. The sun rose, its
shafts of level, golden light striking across promontory after
promontory. We saw great valleys filled with purple shadow, and,
high above the coast, forests appeared, interspersed with glades
and lawns that might well have been the haunts where our first
parents wandered in the innocence of the world.</p>

<p>Our capacities for joy and gratitude were not adequate to the
occasion. Mr. Bligh was, I believe, as near to tears as he had ever
been in his life, but he held himself well under control. Others
gave way to their emotion, and wept freely; indeed, we were so weak
that tears came readily. Poor Elphinstone, alone of our company,
was robbed of the joy of that never-to-be-forgotten morning; his
sufferings had deprived him--temporarily, at least--of reason. He
sat amidships, facing aft, scanning the empty sea behind us with an
expression of hopeless bewilderment, an object of commiseration to
all. Despite our efforts, we could not convince him that the land
lay close ahead.</p>

<p>At the sunrise we were within two leagues of the coast. A land
more green and fair has never gladdened seamen's eyes; scarcely a
man of us did not long to go ashore at once. The coast was low, but
on the higher regions beyond, we saw many cultivated spots. Near
one of the plantations we observed several huts, but no people
there or elsewhere. Purcell and the master ventured to suggest to
Mr. Bligh that we land, in hopes of finding some of the
inhabitants, who might inform us as to the whereabouts of the Dutch
settlement.</p>

<p>"I can well understand your impatience, Mr. Fryer," said Bligh;
"but we shall take no unnecessary risks. If my recollection serves
me, Timor is all of one hundred leagues in extent. I have told you
that I am by no means certain that the Dutch have a permanent
outpost here. If they have, they may have subjected only a small
part of the island to their rule. The inhabitants are, I believe,
Malays, well known to be a cruel and treacherous race. We shall
place ourselves in their power only as a last resort."</p>

<p>There was no disputing the wisdom of this decision. What we
feared, of course, was that no European settlement existed on the
island; but we did not permit ourselves to consider this melancholy
possibility, and both Bligh and Nelson recollected that Captain
Cook had been informed that the most easterly station of the Dutch
was upon Timor.</p>

<p>We bore away again to the W.S.W., keeping close enough to the
coast to avoid missing any opening that might exist; but throughout
the morning neither cove nor bay did we see, nor any place where a
landing might have been effected, because of the great surf
breaking all along this windward shore.</p>

<p>At noon we were abreast of a high headland only three miles
distant, and, having passed it, we found the land still bearing off
in a southwesterly direction for as far as the eye could reach. Our
dinner was the usual allowance: one twenty-fifth of a pound of
bread, and a half pint of water--for Mr. Bligh was not the man to
relax his vigilance until assured that the need for vigilance was
past; but the bird we had caught the night before was divided in
the customary manner. I received a portion of the breast, which, a
week earlier, I should have considered a tidbit of the rarest sort;
but now my stomach revolted at the sight and tainted smell of the
raw flesh, and I could not eat it. I gave my portion to Peckover,
and merely to see the relish with which he devoured it upset me the
more, so that I fell to retching violently. Six or seven others
were in as bad a state. Mr. Bligh gave the weakest of us a swallow
of rum, of which we still had three quarters of a bottle.</p>

<p>All through the afternoon the weather was hazy, and we could see
no great distance before us, but were close enough in to observe
the appearance of the coast, which was low and covered with a
seemingly endless forest of fan palms. At this time we saw no signs
anywhere of cultivated spots, and, as we proceeded, the land had a
more arid look. Captain Bligh said nothing of the matter; but I
could see that he was worried lest we had gone beyond the habitable
part of the island. I know not how many times during this day we
had before us a distant promontory, beyond which nothing of the
island could be seen; but always, upon rounding it, we found
another far ahead, and the land still bearing away to the south. At
sunset, we had run twenty-three miles since noon; and in the
gathering dusk we brought to under a close-reefed foresail, in
shoal water within half a league of the shore.</p>

<p>We did not know how near we might be to the end of all our
troubles. Perhaps only a few miles farther, we thought, lay the
Dutch settlement; but we dared not risk sailing on, lest we should
run past it in the darkness. The excitement of the previous
eighteen hours had exhausted our little strength, and, had it been
possible, I believe that Captain Bligh would have landed here, if
only to give us the refreshment of stretching out our cramped and
aching limbs. The surf on shore was not great at this point, but we
were too weak to have run our boat through it; so we lay huddled in
the launch, most of us too far spent even for conversation. In my
own case, much as I regret to admit it, I was in a weaker condition
than any of the company save Lebogue, and I had a great ulcer on my
leg that kept me in constant torment. We were all of us, in fact,
covered with sores, due to the constant chafing of our emaciated
bodies against the boards of the boat, and kept open and raw by the
action of salt water. Nelson astonished me at this time; he looked
like a dying man, but he seemed to have drawn, merely from the
sight of Timor, a strength which he was, somehow, able to impart to
others. Together, he and Bligh took over the office of looking
after the sick, and I shall not soon forget their comforting,
heartening words as they made their way amongst us, helping some
poor fellow to change to a more comfortable position, and doling
out a few drops of rum or wine from the last of our precious
supply.</p>

<p>We were drawn together that night as never before. We had
suffered so much that we seemed of one body. Antipathies, whether
small or large, arising from our different characters, vanished
quite away, and a rich current of sympathy and common feeling ran
through our forlorn little company, making us, for that night at
least, brothers indeed. I had observed many different aspects of
Mr. Bligh's character, and, profoundly as I respected him, I had
not supposed that he had in him any deep feeling of compassion for
the men under his command. On this occasion he revealed a
gentleness which quite altered my conception of his nature. The
experience brought home to me the difficulty one has in forming a
true notion of any of one's fellow creatures. They must be seen
over a long period of time, and under many and varied conditions
not often presenting themselves in sequence to a single observer.
But some men are ever the same, unchanging and unchangeable as
rock, no matter what the conditions. Cole, the boatswain, was one
of these. Loyalty to his commander, devotion to duty, sympathy for
those weaker than himself, and an abiding trust in God were the
corner stones of his nature. All through that interminable night he
was ever on the alert to do some suffering man a kindness.</p>

<p>About two in the morning, we wore and stood close along the
coast till daylight. Seeing no signs of habitation, we bore away to
the westward, with a strong gale against a weather current, which
occasioned much sea and forced us to resume the weary work of
bailing. This fell chiefly upon Fryer, Cole, Peckover, and two of
the midshipmen, Tinkler and Hayward; others did what little they
could, sitting propped up against the thwarts.</p>

<p>By this time every man of us--save Bligh, perhaps--had a feeling
of mingled fear and hatred toward the sea: as though it were not a
mindless force but a conscious one, bent upon our destruction, and
becoming increasingly enraged that we had survived its cruelty and
were about to escape. Even Bligh must have had something of the
feeling, for I heard him say to the master: "She's not done with us
yet...Bail, lads!" he called. "I'll soon have you out of this."</p>

<p>Once more we had before us a low coast, with points opening to
the west; and again we were encouraged to think we had reached the
extremity of the island; but, toward the middle of the morning, we
found the coast reaching on to the south a weary way ahead. Even
the land, to my distorted fancy, appeared hostile unwilling to
receive us, tempting us on with false hopes only that we might be
the more bitterly disappointed.</p>

<p>Presently we discerned, to the southwest, the dim outlines of
high land, but in the moisture-laden air we could not be sure
whether or no it was a part of Timor. Seeing no break between it
and the coast we were following, Bligh concluded that it must be a
distant headland of the island; therefore we stood toward it, and
several hours passed before we discovered that it was a separate
island--the island of Roti, as we afterward learned.</p>

<p>Shortly after Mr. Bligh had altered our course to return to the
coast we had left, I lost all knowledge of what went on. The sun
had been extremely hot, and we had no protection from its rays. It
may be that I suffered a slight stroke, and this, combined with my
other miseries; had proven too much for me. At any rate, I sank
into a stupor which left me a dim consciousness of misery and of
little else. Now and then I heard the confused murmur of voices,
and I vaguely remember having been roused from frightful dreams,
when I thought I was struggling alone in the sea and upon the point
of drowning, to find that I was still in the launch, being raised
up to escape the water that came over the side. I was, indeed, far
gone, powerless to do aught for myself. Then followed a period of
complete darkness, when I was nothing but an inert mass of skin and
bones; and my next recollection was of someone repeatedly calling
my name. Try as I would, I could not rouse myself sufficiently to
reply. I heard Bligh's voice: "Give him the whole of it, Mr.
Nelson. He'll come round."</p>

<p>And so I did. A quarter of a pint of rum was poured down my
gullet. I remember how the heat and the strength of it seemed to
flow into every part of me, clearing my brain and giving me a
blessed sense of well-being; but oh! more blessed was the sound of
Nelson's voice: "Ledward! Ledward! We're here, old fellow!"</p>

<p>It was deep night, the cloudless sky sprinkled with stars dimmed
by the soft splendour of the waning moon. I found myself sitting
propped up in the stern sheets. Nelson was kneeling beside me, and
Cole supporting me with his arm around my shoulders. As I turned my
head, Cole said: "That's what was needed, sir; he's coming round
nicely."</p>

<p>I was conscious of a feeling of shame and vexation that I, the
<i>Bounty's</i> surgeon, should be in such a deplorable state--an
encumbrance instead of a help to the others.</p>

<p>"What's this, Nelson?" I faltered. "Damme! Have I been
asleep?"</p>

<p>"Don't talk, Ledward," he replied. "Look! Look yonder!...Turn
him a little, Mr. Cole."</p>

<p>The boatswain lifted me gently so that I sat half facing
forward. The sail had been lowered, and there were six men at the
oars, pulling slowly and feebly across what appeared to be the head
of a great bay, so calm that the wavering reflection of the moon
lay on the surface of the water. Outlines of the land were clearly
revealed; not half a mile away I could see two square-rigged
vessels lying at anchor, and beyond them, on a high foreshore, what
appeared to be a fort whose walls gleamed faintly in the mild
light.</p>

<p>"Easy, lads," Bligh called to the men at the oars, "don't exert
yourselves"; and then, to me: "How is it with you, Mr. Ledward? I
was bound you shouldn't miss this moment."</p>

<p>I could not speak. I hesitate to admit it, but I could not. I
was weak as a six-months' child, and now, for the first time, tears
gushed from my eyes. They were not tears of relief, of joy at our
deliverance. No. I could have controlled those. But when I looked
at Mr. Bligh, sitting at his old position with his hand on the
tiller, there welled up within me a feeling toward him that
destroyed the barriers we Englishmen are so proud of erecting
against one another. I saw him then as he deserved to be seen, in a
light that transfigured him. Enough. The deepest emotions of the
heart are not lightly to be spoken of, and no words of mine could
add to the stature of the captain of the <i>Bounty's</i>
launch.</p>

<p>I managed at length to say: "I'm doing very well, sir," and left
it at that.</p>

<p>The silence of the land seemed to flow down upon us, healing our
weary hearts, filling us with a deep content that made all speech
superfluous. The launch moved forward as smoothly as though she
were gliding through air, and the faint creak of the oars against
the tholepins and the gentle plash of the blades in the water were
sounds by which to measure the vastness of this peace.</p>

<p>It was then about three in the morning. Nearer we came and
nearer to the little town hushed in sleep; not even a dog was astir
to bay at the moon. As we drew in we saw that the two ships were
anchored a considerable distance to the right of the fort and about
a cable-length from shore. We made out a small cutter riding near
them, and not a light showing in any of these vessels.</p>

<p>We turned then to approach an open space on the beach that
appeared to be a point of embarkation for boats, and Mr. Cole made
his way to the bow. A fishing line with a stone attached served as
our lead line. At Mr. Bligh's order, Tinkler began heaving it. "Six
fathoms, sir," he called. We moved slowly on into shallower water.
In the moonlight we could now see the ghostly gleam of roofs and
walls, embowered in trees and flowering shrubs whose perfume
floated out to us with the cool, moist air that flowed down from
the valley of the interior.</p>

<p>"Way enough!" said Bligh, and then: "Drop the grapnel, Mr.
Cole."</p>

<p>The oars were gotten in; there was a light splash as the grapnel
went over the side. The boatswain paid out the line and made fast.
Our voyage was at an end.</p>

<p>There were but eight of our company strong enough to sit upon
the thwarts; the others were lying or sitting, propped up in the
bottom of the boat.</p>

<p>"Let us pray, lads," said Bligh. We bowed our heads while he
returned thanks to Almighty God.</p>

<p>We lay within thirty or forty yards of the beach. A little
distance to the right, the walls of the fort rose from their
ramparts of rock. All was silent there; not so much as a gleam of
light appeared anywhere in the settlement. Captain Bligh hailed the
fort repeatedly, with no result.</p>

<p>"Try your voice on 'em, Mr. Purcell," he said.</p>

<p>Purcell hailed, then the boatswain, then the two together; but
there was no response.</p>

<p>"By God," said Bligh, "were we at war with the Dutch, I'll
warrant we could capture the place, weak as we are, with nothing
but four rusty cutlasses. They've not so much as a sentinel on the
walls."</p>

<p>"We've roused someone at last," said Nelson. "Look yonder."</p>

<p>A strange-looking man was just emerging from the shadows of the
trees lining the road that led to the beach. He was clad only in
shirt and trousers, and had what appeared to be a white nightcap on
his head. He was exceedingly fat, and walked at a waddling
gait.</p>

<p>"Can you speak English, my good man?" Bligh called.</p>

<p>He came forward another pace or two, as though for a clearer
view of us, but made no reply.</p>

<p>"I say, can you speak English? You understand?"</p>

<p>Whether it were astonishment, or fear, or both, or neither, that
moved him, we were at a loss to know; but of a sudden he turned on
his incredibly short legs and waddled away at twice the speed with
which he had approached.</p>

<p>"Ahoy there!" Bligh called after him. "Don't go! Wait, I
say!"</p>

<p>The man turned, shouted something in a deep, powerful voice, and
disappeared under the shadow of the trees.</p>

<p>"Was it Dutch he spoke, Nelson?" Bligh asked.</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly," said Nelson; "but that is as much as I can
say...We shall fare well here, that's plain."</p>

<p>Bligh laughed. "Aye, so we shall, if that fellow is an average
specimen of the inhabitants. Damn his eyes! What possessed him to
run off like that?"</p>

<p>"Likely he's gone for help, sir. There may be English-speaking
people here."</p>

<p>"Let us hope so, Mr. Fryer. Possess your souls in patience,
lads. We must not go ashore without permission, and that we shall
soon have, I promise you. Dawn is scarcely an hour off."</p>

<p>In a little time the Dutchman returned with another man dressed
in a seaman's uniform.</p>

<p>"Ahoy, there! What boat is that?" called the latter.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" Bligh replied. "An Englishman?"</p>

<p>"Aye, sir."</p>

<p>"Is there an English ship here?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Then how came you in these parts, my man?" said Bligh, with
something of his old quarter-deck manner.</p>

<p>"I'm quartermaster's mate, sir, of the Dutch vessel yonder.
Captain Spikerman."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Bligh. "Listen carefully, young man! Tell your
captain--what's his name, again?"</p>

<p>"Spikerman, sir."</p>

<p>"Tell Captain Spikerman that Captain Bligh, of His Majesty's
armed transport <i>Bounty</i>, wishes to see him at his very
earliest convenience. Inform him that the matter is pressing. You
understand?"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir."</p>

<p>"Very well; carry him this message instantly. Don't fear to
rouse him. He will thank you for doing so."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir. He's sleeping ashore. I'll go this instant."</p>

<p>We must have waited a full three quarters of an hour, although
the time seemed immeasurably longer. The delay, as we were to
learn, was not Captain Spikerman's fault. He resided in a distant
part of the town, and came as soon as he could dress.</p>

<p>Dawn was at hand, and the people in the town were stirring out
of their houses, when we saw him approaching with two of his
officers and the man who had carried our message. Captain Bligh
stood up in the stern sheets. His clothing was a mass of rags
revealing his frightfully emaciated limbs; his haggard, bony face
was covered with a month's growth of beard; but he held himself as
erect as though he were standing on the <i>Bounty's</i>
quarter-deck.</p>

<p>"Captain Spikerman?" he called.</p>

<p>For a few seconds the little group on shore stared at us in
silence. Captain Spikerman stepped forward. "At your service, sir,"
he replied.</p>

<p>"Captain Bligh, of His Majesty's armed transport <i>Bounty</i>.
We are in need of assistance, sir. I will be grateful indeed if you
will secure us permission to land."</p>

<p>"You may come ashore at once, Captain Bligh. I can vouch for the
governor's permission. Your boat may be brought directly to the
beach."</p>

<p>"Haul in the grapnel, Mr. Cole. Two men at the oars." Tinkler
and Hayward hauled it in, Cole coiling the line neatly as they did
so. Peckover and Purcell took the oars, and the launch proceeded on
the last fifty yards of a voyage of more than three thousand, six
hundred miles. "Easy, Mr. Cole! Don't let her touch!"</p>

<p>The boatswain fended off with our bamboo pole and attempted to
leap out to hold her, but the poor fellow had forgotten his
condition. His legs gave way and he fell into the water, holding on
to the gunwale, until, with a grim effort, he managed to get his
footing. Tinkler threw a line ashore which the English seaman of
the Dutch ship took up. Captain Spikerman and his officers stood
for a moment as though powerless to move. Then, taking in our
situation, they themselves sprang into the shallow water to draw us
alongside.</p>

<p>"God in heaven, Captain Bligh! What is this? From what place do
you come?" Mr. Spikerman exclaimed.</p>

<p>"That you shall know in good time, sir," said Bligh; "but I must
first see to my men. Some of them are in a pitiable state from
starvation. Is there a place in the town where they may be cared
for?"</p>

<p>"You may take them directly to my house. One moment, sir."</p>

<p>Captain Spikerman turned to one of his officers and spoke to him
rapidly in the Dutch tongue. The young man made off at once, half
running along the road to the town.</p>

<p>By this time a crowd of the townspeople had collected about us,
and others came from moment to moment. They were of various
nationalities,--Dutch, Malays, Chinese, and people evidently of
mixed blood,--and they stared at us with expressions of mingled
horror and pity. Meanwhile, those of us who could had gotten out of
the launch; but more than half of the company had to be carried
ashore. We were taken a little way up the beach, where mats were
spread for us on the sand. There we waited the arrival of
conveyances which were to carry us to Captain Spikerman's house,
while the townspeople gathered in a wide circle, gazing at us as
though they would never have done.</p>

<p>Of our people, Lebogue was in the most serious condition. The
old fellow lay close beside me. He was no more than a skeleton
covered with skin; but his was a resolute spirit, and, weak as he
was, he yet had within him a strong will to live. Nelson, Simpson,
Hall, Smith, and myself were in a plight only a little less grave.
Nelson tried to walk ashore, but after a few steps his legs gave
way and he was constrained to allow himself to be carried. Hallet
was very weak, but managed to keep his footing. Poor Elphinstone's
disabilities were, as I have said, mental rather than physical. His
face still wore its vacant, puzzled expression, and he appeared to
have no knowledge of his surroundings.</p>

<p>In a short while, Mr. Spikerman's lieutenant returned with
litters and a score of Malay chair-men. They carried us into the
town, Mr. Bligh and the stronger of the company following on foot.
I have only a dim recollection of the way we went, past shops and
warehouses, and along shaded streets, till we came to a pleasant
house in an elevated situation where Captain Spikerman lived. He
and his officers were kindness itself; I shall ever have a feeling
of sincere liking for the people of the Dutch nation because of the
humane treatment we received from those members of it who resided
at Coupang. Such was the name of the haven--which I might better
call "heaven"--at which we had arrived.</p>

<p>When we had been bathed with warm water our sores were dressed
by Mr. Max, the surgeon of the town; whereupon we were placed in
beds and given a little hot soup, or tea, which was all that our
stomachs could receive at this time. I am speaking here of the
greatest invalids amongst us, who were cared for in one room.
Captain Bligh, when he had bathed and refreshed himself with food
and a few hours' sleep, accompanied Captain Spikerman to the house
of Mr. Timotheus Wanjon, the secretary to Mr. Van Este, the
governor of the town. Mr. Van Este was at this time lying very ill,
and incapable of transacting any business.</p>

<p>On this day I had the sweetest sleep I have ever enjoyed in my
life. The cooling ointment with which my sores had been dressed,
and the soft bed upon which I lay, lulled me to rest within half an
hour. I was aroused, toward evening, to take a little soup and
bread, but fell to sleep again immediately after, and did not waken
until about ten of the clock the following morning.</p>

<p>After four days of complete rest, we were wonderfully restored,
and all except Lebogue could rise from bed and walk a little in Mr.
Spiker-man's garden. His services to us were endless; he had put us
under obligations we shall never be able to repay, but we did not,
of course, wish to discommode him longer than was absolutely
necessary. All his rooms were taken up by our company, and he was
sleeping at the house of Mr. Wanjon. Captain Bligh found that there
was but one available house in the settlement. Having examined it,
he decided that we should all lodge there. Mr. Spikerman suggested
that the house be taken by Captain Bligh for himself and his
officers, and that the men be accommodated on one of the vessels
lying in the harbour, but Captain Bligh was not willing at such a
time to fare better than his men. Therefore, on our fifth day in
Coupang, we removed to our new quarters.</p>

<p>The dwelling contained a hall with a room at each end, and was
surrounded with a piazza. Above, there was a spacious, airy loft.
One room was reserved to Captain Bligh; Nelson, Fryer, Peckover,
and myself lodged in the other, and the men were assigned to the
loft. The hall was common to all of the officers, and the back
piazza was set aside for the use of the people. In order to
simplify the matter of our victualing, the three midshipmen readily
agreed to mess with the men. Through the kindness of Mr. Van Este,
the house was furnished with beds, tables, chairs,
settees--everything, in fact, of which we stood in need; and our
food was dressed at his own house and brought to us by his
servants.</p>

<p>Mr. Van Este expressed a desire to see Captain Bligh and some of
his officers. It was therefore arranged that Mr. Bligh, Nelson, and
myself should wait upon him, in company with Mr. Wanjon and Captain
Spikerman. We found the governor propped up in bed, so wasted by
his illness that he looked--as, indeed, he was--at death's door.
His voice was exceedingly weak, but his eyes were full of interest.
Captain Spikerman acted as our interpreter. He acquainted the
governor with the circumstances of the mutiny. Mr. Van Este was not
aware of the position of Tofoa and the Friendly Islands; in fact, I
believe that he did not know of their existence. When he had been
told that we had made a voyage in the ship's launch of above three
thousand, six hundred miles, he raised a thin white hand and said
but one word in reply. Captain Spikerman turned to Mr. Bligh.</p>

<p>"Mr. Van Este says 'Impossible,' Captain Bligh. You will
understand that this is only a manner of speaking, to convey his
astonishment. He does not doubt your word."</p>

<p>Bligh smiled faintly. "You may tell Mr. Van Este that he is
right: it was impossible; nevertheless, we did it."</p>

<p>He then conveyed, through Mr. Spikerman, our gratitude for the
kind and hospitable treatment we had received, and we took our
leave. The governor was far too ill to bear the fatigue of a long
conversation.</p>

<p>This day, June the nineteenth, was remarkable for still another
reason. Mr. Max, my Dutch colleague, and I had agreed that our
company need not be kept longer on a diet. Mr. Wanjon, who himself
overlooked the matter of our victualing, had provided a feast equal
to the greatness of the occasion; and he, Captain Spikerman, and
Mr. Max readily consented to join us at table. On our way from the
governor's house, we called for Mr. Max, and then proceeded to our
residence, where the men were already at their dinner on the back
piazza. Cole sat at the head of the table, with the midshipmen on
either side and the others below. Even Lebogue had sufficiently
recovered to be present. The table was loaded with food that would
have gladdened any seaman's eyes; it was a pleasure to see the
half-starved men stowing it away.</p>

<p>At Captain Bligh's entrance, they rose; but he at once motioned
them to be seated.</p>

<p>"Eat hearty, lads," he said. "There's no need to wish you good
appetites, that's plain."</p>

<p>"We're doin' famous, sir," Cole replied. A moment later, Captain
Bligh retired with our guests to the hall, while Nelson and I
remained for a little to look on at this memorable feast.</p>

<p>"I hope you'll not think we're goin' beyond reason, Mr.
Ledward," said Cole. "Better vittles I never tasted!"</p>

<p>"And well you deserve them, every man of you," I replied. "Eat
as much as you like."</p>

<p>"Aye, they'll do," said Purcell, grudgingly; "but I'd sooner set
down to a good feed of eggs and bacon. All these rich faldelals...I
don't well know what I'm eatin'."</p>

<p>"Trust old Chips to find fault," said Hayward.</p>

<p>"Here, Purcell; have some of the bread, if you don't like Dutch
food," said Hallet. "Pass it along to him, Tinkler."</p>

<p>"Mr. Nelson and Mr. Ledward would like some, I'm sure," said
Tinkler. "Try a little, Mr. Nelson."</p>

<p>He rose and took up a large platter, set high in the middle of
the table on four tall water-glasses. Heaped on the platter was
something that resembled nothing on earth save what it was: the
bread of the <i>Bounty's</i> launch.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm damned!" said Nelson, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Have just a crumb as an appetizer. We did, the lot of us," said
Tinkler. "Mr. Ledward, what about you?"</p>

<p>"Wait!" Hayward exclaimed. "Don't you give 'em a ration,
Tinkler, without weighing it. Where's Captain Bligh's scales?"</p>

<p>It warmed my heart to see them in such a merry mood, and the
<i>Bounty</i> bread--the sight of it, at least--was indeed the best
of reminders of misery past and done with.</p>

<p>"Is this, all that was left in the launch, Tinkler?" Nelson
asked. "Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"We've been making an estimate, Mr. Nelson," said Hayward. "What
you see on the platter would have lasted the eighteen of us another
eleven days, had we not had the misfortune of finding Coupang."</p>

<p>"Save for our abominable luck in landing amongst the Dutch, we
might even have got home on it," Tinkler added. "What do you think,
boatswain?"</p>

<p>Cole looked up from his plate, holding his fork erect in his
fist.</p>

<p>"I'll say this, Mr. Tinkler," he replied gravely. "If Captain
Bligh was forced to take us all the way to England in the launch,
with no more bread than what's on that plate, I'll warrant he could
do it if we'd back him up."</p>

<p>At Cole's words there was a cheer, in which every man at the
table joined heartily.</p>

<p>"But don't, for God's sake, suggest it, boatswain!" said Hayward
in a low voice. "He might want to try."</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>The dinner at the captain's table proceeded more soberly. There
was food, food, and more food: curried prawns with rice, baked fish
with rice, roast fowl with rice, and many other dishes, with
excellent wine and schnapps to wash all down. We of the
<i>Bounty's</i> launch had been so long accustomed to thinking of
wine and spirits as the most precious of commodities, to be taken
only a spoonful at a time, that it was hard to convince ourselves
that we need no longer be sparing of them. Captain Bligh, always a
moderate drinker, was still sparing; but the rest of us did better
justice to the good cheer; and our Dutch companions ate and drank
with as much zest as though they had been members of our company
all the way from Tofoa. Nelson threw a quizzical glance in my
direction, toward the end of the meal, when they were attacking new
dishes with undiminished appetite.</p>

<p>Our guests were naturally curious about the events of the
mutiny, but they soon realized that it was a sore subject with Mr.
Bligh, which he preferred not to discuss.</p>

<p>"You have our sworn affidavits, Mr. Wanjon," he remarked, at
this time. "The facts are there, attested to by every one of my
men. It is not likely that the villains will come this way, but
should they do so, seize and hold them. Let not one of them
escape."</p>

<p>"You may set your mind at rest on that score," Mr. Wanjon
replied; and with this the discussion of the mutiny was
dropped.</p>

<p>"I greatly desire to proceed homeward as soon as my men are fit
to ravel," Bligh remarked. He laughed in a wry manner. "We are a
company of paupers, Mr. Wanjon. We've not a shilling amongst us;
not a halfpenny bit!"</p>

<p>"Do not let that worry you, Captain Bligh. Mr. Van Este has
instructed me to provide you with whatever funds you may
desire."</p>

<p>"That's uncommon kind of him. I shall draw bills on His
Majesty's Government...Captain Spikerman, is there a small vessel
to be had hereabout--one fit to carry us to Batavia? I wish to
arrive there in time to sail home with your October fleet."</p>

<p>"There is a small schooner lying in a cove about two leagues
distant," Captain Spikerman replied. "She can be bought, I know,
for one thousand rix-dollars."</p>

<p>"Pretty dear, isn't it?" said Bligh</p>

<p>"She's well worth it, I assure you. She is thirty-four feet
long, perfectly sound, and would serve your purpose admirably.
Should you care to look at her, I can have her here for your
inspection within a day or two."</p>

<p>"Excellent," said Bligh. "I'll be greatly obliged to you."</p>

<p>The dinner was at an end, and presently our guests left us.
Nelson was in a jubilant mood. He had asked permission to botanize
the island in the environs of Coupang, and Mr. Wanjon not only
agreed but had offered to provide servants to accompany him on his
expeditions. Nelson was in no fit state to go abroad, and I
demurred strongly against the plan. However, he had won Captain
Bligh's consent and would listen to none of my objections. As a
matter of fact, I would gladly have gone with him, had it not been
that my ulcered leg made walking out of the question.</p>

<p>During the next ten days he was constantly away from Coupang,
returning only occasionally to bring in his specimens. At first he
appeared to thrive upon the work, but I soon realized that he was
exerting himself far beyond his strength. Early in July he came
down with an inflammatory fever which at last confined him to his
bed, whether he would or no. Mr. Max and I both attended him, but
his condition grew steadily worse. His weakened constitution had
been tried too severely, and it was soon plain to both of us that
he was dying.</p>

<p>He passed away on the twentieth of July, at one o'clock of the
morning. I need not say how his loss affected our company. He was
respected and loved by every one of us. In my own case, we had been
friends from the day of our first meeting at Spithead, and I had
looked forward to many years of his friendship. As for Mr. Bligh,
Nelson was, I believe, one of three or four men whom he held in his
heart of hearts. I think he would sooner have lost the half of his
company than to have lost him.</p>

<p>We buried him the following day. His coffin was carried by
twelve soldiers from the fort, dressed in black. Mr. Bligh and Mr.
Wanjon walked immediately behind the bier; then came ten gentlemen
of the town and the officers from the ships in the harbour; and the
<i>Bounty's</i> people followed after. Mr. Bligh read the service,
and it was as much as he could do to go through with it. The body
was laid to rest behind the chapel, in that part of the cemetery
set aside for Europeans.</p>

<p>I recall with little pleasure the remainder of our sojourn in
Coupang. Mr. Bligh was constantly employed about the business of
our departure, and the <i>Bounty's</i> people were daily aboard the
schooner he had bought, making her ready for sea. In my own case, I
was as useless now as I had been much of the time in the
<i>Bounty's</i> launch. My ulcer would not heal, and I was forced
to sit in idleness on the piazza of our dwelling, thinking of
Nelson, and how gladly he would have lived to go home with us.</p>

<p>The schooner was a staunch little craft, as Captain Spikerman
had assured us. Bligh named her <i>Resource</i>, and, as we were to
go along the Java coast, which is infested with small, piratical
vessels, he armed her with four brass swivels and fourteen stand of
small arms, with an abundance of powder and shot.</p>

<p>On the twentieth of August, being entirely prepared for sea, we
spent the morning in waiting upon our various Dutch friends, whose
kindness had been unremitting from the day of our arrival at
Coupang. Mr. Van Este, the governor, was lying at the very point of
death, and Captain Bligh was not able to see him. Mr. Wanjon
received us in his stead, and Mr. Bligh tendered him our grateful
thanks for the innumerable services he had rendered us. Mr. Max,
the surgeon, who had cared for our people when I was unable to do
so, would accept no remuneration for his attendance upon us, saying
that he had done no more than his duty. His action was typical of
that of others at Coupang who had been our hosts for more than two
months.</p>

<p>Throughout the afternoon our hosts became our guests on board
the <i>Resource</i>, and we showed them what small hospitalities
our poor means afforded.</p>

<p>Captain Bligh looked his old self again. He was now cloathed as
befitted his rank, and his hair was neatly dressed and powdered. As
he stood on the after-deck, talking with Captain Spikerman and Mr.
Wanjon, I could not but remark the contrast between his appearance
now and what it had been upon our arrival at Coupang. Nevertheless,
as I observed him, I was conscious of a curious feeling of
disappointment. It may be thought strange, but I liked him better
as he was in the <i>Bounty's</i> launch: rags hanging from his
wasted limbs, his hand on the tiller, the great seas foaming up
behind him, and the low scud flying close overhead. There he was
unique, one man in ten thousand. On the after-deck of the
<i>Resource</i>, he appeared to be merely one of the innumerable
captains of His Majesty's Navy. But well I knew in my heart the
quality of the man who stood there. Forty-one days in a ship's boat
had taught me that.</p>

<p>Toward four of the afternoon, the last of our guests returned to
the shore. The breeze favouring, we weighed at once and stood off
toward the open sea. The beach was thronged with people waving hats
and handkerchiefs, and as we drew away the air quivered with the
parting salute from the fort. Mr. Peckover, our gunner, was
rejoiced to be employed for the first time this long while in his
proper duties. Our brass swivels replied bravely to the Dutch
salutation.</p>

<p>As for the <i>Bounty's</i> launch, she was towing behind, with
Tinkler at the tiller, proud of the honour conferred upon him.
Peckover and I were standing at the rail, looking down upon her in
silence, thinking of her faithful service. We loved her, every man
of us, as though she were a sentient being.</p>

<p>Presently Peckover turned to me. "How well she tows," he said.
"She seems to want to come. Though we had no line to her, I'll
warrant she'd still follow Captain Bligh."</p>

<p>"By God, Peckover," I said, "I believe she would!"</p>

<h2><a name="c13" id="c13"></a>EPILOGUE</h2>

<p>On the first of October we cast anchor in Batavia Road, near a
Dutch man-of-war. More than a score of East Indiamen were riding
there, as well as a great fleet of native prows. The captain went
ashore at once, to call on Mr. Englehard, the Sabandar--an officer
with whom all strangers are obliged to transact their business; and
on the same evening we were informed that we might lodge at an
hotel, the only place in the city where foreigners are permitted to
reside.</p>

<p>The climate of Batavia is one of the most unwholesome in the
world. The miasmatic effluvia which rise from the river during the
night bring on an intermittent fever, or paludism, often of great
severity, accompanied by unendurable headaches. Weakened by our
privations, some of us fell immediate victims to this disorder,
which was to cost Lenkletter and Elphinstone their lives. The
hotel, where I resided with the other officers, though situated in
what is considered a healthy quarter of the city, and near the
river bank, was intolerably hot, and so ill arranged for a free
circulation of air that a man in robust health must soon have
succumbed to its stifling rooms.</p>

<p>After one night in this place, Mr. Bligh was taken with a fever
so violent that I feared for his life. I was unable to attend him,
since I was suffering from a fever as well as from the ulcer on my
leg, and Mr. Aansorp, head surgeon of the town hospital, was sent
for. By administering bark of Peru and wine, this skillful
physician so improved Captain Bligh that within a day he was able
once more to transact the pressing business on his hands.</p>

<p>We had been four days at the hotel when Mr. Sparling,
Surgeon-General of Java, had the kindness to invite Captain Bligh
and me to be his guests at the seamen's hospital, on an island in
the river, three or four miles from the town. This hospital is a
model of its kind, large enough to accommodate fifteen hundred men.
The sick receive excellent care and attention, and the wards are
scrupulously clean. Mr. Sparling, who had been educated in England,
listened with great interest to the account of our voyage, and
insisted that Captain Bligh send for those of his people who were
ill. Late one afternoon I was sitting on my colleague's shady
verandah. He was smoking a long black <i>cigarro</i>; I lay on a
settee with my bandaged leg stretched out on a stool. We were
discussing the medical phases of our sufferings, Mr. Sparling
expressing surprise that any man in the launch should have
survived.</p>

<p>"You say that three of the people were forty-one days without
evacuation?" he asked. "It is all but incredible!"</p>

<p>"So much so," I replied, "that I hope to write a paper to be
read before the College of Surgeons. What little we ate appeared to
be entirely used up by our bodies."</p>

<p>"It is a miracle that you are alive. But your constitutions have
been too much impaired to withstand such a climate as this. I am
concerned about Mr. Bligh. Should he stay long..." He shrugged his
shoulders, paused for a moment, and went on: "I have never known a
man of greater determination! With such a fever, most men would be
on their backs. Yet he goes daily into the town to transact his
business. I have spoken to the governor. Mr. Bligh will be
permitted to take passage, with two others, on the packet sailing
on the sixteenth of this month."</p>

<p>"You are kind indeed, sir! Mr. Bligh shared all of our
sufferings, and, in addition, the entire responsibility was his.
The strain has impaired his health gravely; I have feared more than
once that he might leave his bones here."</p>

<p>"That possibility is by no means remote," said Sparling. "There
is a high mortality here amongst Europeans. Mr. Bligh, I can see,
is a man who will attend to his duty even to the serious prejudice
of his health. Do what you can, Mr. Ledward, to urge upon him the
necessity for caution."</p>

<p>"I have, sir," I replied; "you may be sure of that; but he
cannot, or will not, take advice."</p>

<p>My colleague nodded. "He's a strong-headed man, that's plain. I
should imagine that he was a bit of a tartar on the quarter-deck?"
At that moment a Malay servant appeared in the doorway, bowed, and
spoke to his master. Mr. Sparling rose.</p>

<p>"Captain Bligh is disembarking now," he said, as he left me.
Presently he ushered Bligh to a chair and made a sign to the
servant, who brought in a tray with glasses, and a decanter of
excellent Cape Town wine.</p>

<p>"Let me prescribe a glass of wine," remarked Sparling. "There is
no finer tonic for men in your condition."</p>

<p>"Your health, sir," said Bligh, "and that of our kind hostess,
if I may propose it. I have had a hard day in the town; your house
is a haven of refuge for a weary man."</p>

<p>His face was gaunt and flushed, and his eyes unnaturally bright,
as he sat in one of Sparling's long rattan chairs, wearing an
ill-fitting suit of cloathes, made by a Chinese tailor in the
town.</p>

<p>"One of your men is very low," remarked the Surgeon-General
presently; "the one we visited this morning. I fear there is little
hope for him."</p>

<p>"Aye--Hall," said Bligh. "Poor fellow."</p>

<p>"The flux seems deadly in these parts," I observed.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Sparling. "Few recover from the violent form of the
disease. He must have eaten of some infected fruits in
Coupang."</p>

<p>We were silent for a time, while Bligh seemed to be brooding
over some unpleasant thought.</p>

<p>"Ledward, I've had to part with the launch!" he exclaimed at
last. "You've sold her, sir?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. And the schooner, too--but she meant little to me. As for
the launch, though I am a poor man, I would gladly give five
hundred pounds to take her home!"</p>

<p>"You could get no space for her on the <i>Vlydte?</i>"</p>

<p>"Not a foot! Damme! Not an inch! Not even for my six pots of
plants from Timor."</p>

<p>Sparling nodded. "There are never enough ships in the October
fleet," he remarked. "Every foot of space and every passage has
been bespoken for months. It was only through the governor's
influence that I got passage for you and your two men. Should my
wife desire to send a few gifts of native manufacture to her uncle
at the Cape of Good Hope, I declare to you it would be impossible
at this time!"</p>

<p>"I had hoped to take the launch," said Bligh. "She should be
placed in the museum of the Admiralty. A finer boat was never
built! I love her, every frame and plank!"</p>

<p>"How did you fare at the auction?" asked Sparling.</p>

<p>Bligh laughed ruefully. "Damned badly!" he replied. "If I may
remark upon it, sir, your method of conducting an auction strikes
me as inferior to ours."</p>

<p>"Yes, from the seller's standpoint. I have attended your English
auctions. Where the bids mount higher and higher, the bidders are
apt to lose their heads."</p>

<p>"You should have been there, Ledward," said Bligh. "They set a
high figure at first, which the auctioneer brings down gradually
until someone bids. Small danger of losing one's head when there
can be only one bid! Several Dutch captains were on hand; half a
dozen Malays, a Chinaman or two, and some others--God knows what
they may have been! There was one Englishman present besides
ourselves,--Captain John Eddie, commanding a ship from Bengal. He'd
come merely to look on, not to bid. The auctioneer put up the
schooner first, at two thousand rix-dollars. The figure came down
to three hundred, without an offer! By God, Mr. Sparling, a Scot or
a Jew would starve to death in competition with your seafaring
countrymen! At three hundred, an old Chinaman showed signs of
interest, casting shrewd glances at a Dutch captain standing close
by. At two hundred and ninety-five, Captain Eddie raised his hand.
By God! I was grateful to him for that! The price was not a third
of her value, but Eddie kept those bloody sharks from getting her.
It warmed my heart to see their disappointment."</p>

<p>"What did the launch fetch?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Let us not speak of her. Cole and Peckover were with me; they
felt as badly as I. If I could have left her here, in safe hands,
until there was a chance to send her home..." He sighed. "It
couldn't be arranged. It cost me dear to see her go!"</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>On the following day died Thomas Hall, our third loss since
leaving the <i>Bounty</i>. He had endured manfully our hardships in
the launch, only to succumb to the most dreaded of East Indian
diseases. Lenkletter and Elphinstone, destined also to leave their
bones in Batavia, were suffering with the same paludism that had
attacked Captain Bligh.</p>

<p>At this time the Sabandar informed us that every officer and man
must make deposition before a notary concerning the mutiny on board
the <i>Bounty</i>, in order to authorize the government to detain
her, should she venture into Dutch waters. Bligh considered this
unlikely; but his determination to see the mutineers brought to
justice was such that he left no contingency unprovided for.</p>

<p>On the morning of October sixteenth I was awakened long before
daylight by sounds in Mr. Bligh's room, next to mine. He was to be
rowed down the river to go on board the <i>Vlydte</i>, and I could
hear him, through the thin wall, directing his servant, Smith, how
to pack the large camphorwood box he had purchased some days
before.</p>

<p>In the gray light of dawn, Mr. Bligh knocked at my door and
entered the room.</p>

<p>"Awake, Ledward?" he asked. I struggled to sit up, but he
motioned me not to move.</p>

<p>"I've come to bid you good-bye," he said.</p>

<p>"I wish I were sailing with you, sir!"</p>

<p>He laughed his short, harsh laugh. "Damme! I'm by no means sure
you're not the luckier of the two! You may have the good fortune to
go home on an English ship. Yesterday I called on Captain Couvret,
aboard the <i>Vlydte</i>; we had some talk concerning the manner of
navigation. They carry no log, and scarcely steer within a quarter
of a point. No wonder they frequently find themselves above ten
degrees out in their reckoning! The state of discipline on board is
appalling to an English seaman. It will be a miracle if we reach
Table Bay; once there, I hope to transfer to an English ship."</p>

<p>"Permit me to wish you a good voyage, in any case."</p>

<p>At that moment Mr. Sparling called from the piazza: "Your boat
is waiting, Captain Bligh!"</p>

<p>Bligh took my hand in a brief, warm clasp.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Ledward," he said. "Don't fail to call on Mrs. Bligh
when you reach London."</p>

<p>"I shall hope to see you, too, sir."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "It's not likely. If I have my way, I shall
sail for Otaheite before you reach England."</p>

<p>He was gone--the finest seaman under whom I have ever had the
good fortune to sail. From the bottom of my heart I wished him God
Speed.</p>
