<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>EDITOR'S PREFACE ON THE DISCOVERY OF PRADO'S
<i>RELACI&Oacute;N</i> AND OTHER NEW AND IMPORTANT MATERIAL RELATING TO
QUIROS</h2>
<p>The recovery of the long-lost manuscript <i>Relaci&oacute;n</i> of Captain
Don Diego de Prado y Tovar, who accompanied Pedro Fernandez de Quiros on his
famous voyage of exploration in the South Seas in 1605-6, is undoubtedly the
most important "find" of virgin historical material made in modern times. It
furnishes us for the first time with a detailed account of the discovery of
Torres Strait and Northmost Australia, made during the continuation of the
voyage to Manila by Prado and Torres after the parting of the ships at the
Island of Espiritu Santo, whence Quiros returned to America.</p>
<p>In 1904 the Hakluyt Society published <i>The Voyages of Pedro Fernandez de
Quiros</i>, edited by the late Sir Clements Markham, which included everything
known up to that time about the expedition of Quiros as far as the Island of
Espiritu Santo and the continuation, presumably by Torres, of the voyage to
Manila. Very little was known of the details of the completion of that voyage
beyond the bare fact that Torres forced his way through the Strait which now
bears his name, and ultimately reached Manila. The knowledge (as revealed by
the new <i>Relaci&oacute;n</i>) that after the departure of Quiros the office
of Chief of the Expedition had devolved upon Prado under sealed orders opened
at the Island of Espiritu Santo, and that Torres was thereafter merely acting
as his navigating Captain, will come as a complete surprise to students of
historic geography. It has always been supposed, from the scanty evidence
hitherto available, that the voyage was completed by Torres alone.</p>
<p class="page">{Page x}</p>
<p>The voyage of Prado and Torres was one of the most eventful made since the
days of Columbus, although the great importance of its results has not been
fully recognised because so little has hitherto been known about it. Besides
giving a lengthy and graphic account of the voyage itself, Prado's
<i>Relaci&oacute;n</i> largely resolves the mystery which has prevailed for
more than three hundred years concerning the character and actions of Quiros,
and explains the reasons which caused him so suddenly to abandon his expedition
and return to America.</p>
<p>From a hitherto unrecorded Report of the Spanish Council of State made to
the King in September 1608 (a copy of which was unexpectedly secured from
Madrid whilst the present volume was in the press)we now learn for the first
time the reasons why so little information about the voyage of Quiros and its
continuation ever reached the world at large. Quiros by this time (1608) had
returned to Spain from America, and was dancing attendance at Court,
petitioning for further employment in order to continue his discoveries. The
Report states that "quite recently" there was laid before the Council a letter
from Luis Vaez de Torres (presumably his well-known letter of July 12th, 1607)
giving an account of what had been discovered in his voyage and how "likewise
were exhibited five maps which he sent of some ports and islands where he
landed." From this Report it is evident that the Council was in possession of
ample information both as regards the voyage of Quiros himself and its
continuation by Torres. The Report gives the Council's cogent reasons why the
recent discoveries should be kept secret, and why Quiros should not be
commissioned to make further voyages but should be kept employed in Spain as a
cosmographer, in order that he might not be in a position to give information
of his discoveries to the King's enemies. The discovery of this Report, which
adds so greatly to the interest of thepresent volume, was made just in time to
permit of the Spanish text being printed in full in the Appendix, together with
a translation into English.</p>
<p class="page">{Page xi}</p>
<p>Some few years ago, at the dispersal by auction at Sotheby's of the Spanish
Manuscripts collected by the late Sir Thomas Phillipps, my firm (Henry Stevens,
Son and Stiles) acquired a large number of miscellaneous papers bound up in
several thick volumes. As we were unable to deal immediately with this mass of
material the volumes were laid aside until an opportunity should occur to
examine the various papers in detail. Some time afterwards my partner, Mr
Robert E. Stiles, undertook to make a preliminary inspection of these
Manuscripts. Then it was that on going through one of the volumes he came
across this <i>Relaci&oacute;n</i> of Captain Don Diego de Prado, buried
amongst a quantity of comparatively unimportant documents relating to Portugal
and the Indies. He immediately recognised the fact that anything relating to
the continuation of the voyage of Quiros, after he himself had abandoned it and
returned to America, must be entirely new and unknown material, and
consequently of the utmost value to the history of maritime discovery.</p>
<p>A study of the aforementioned work by Sir Clements Markham, <i>The Voyages
of Quiros</i>, revealed the importance of the newly-recovered Manuscript.
Furthermore an examination of the facsimiles of the four Prado Maps appended to
Markham's book, and a comparison of the handwriting on them with that of the
<i>Relaci&oacute;n</i>, proved beyond doubt that the latter was entirely in the
autograph of Prado. The identification of the Manuscript being thus definitely
established, and Mr Stiles being unable on account of his health to continue
the investigation, the whole matter was turned over to me, but as my knowledge
of Spanish was quite inadequate to complete the work, I at once consulted an
eminent Spanish scholar in the person of my friend Mr G. F. Barwick, Keeper of
Printed Books, British Museum, 1914-1919. Mr Barwick, immediately realising the
vast importance of the <i>Relaci&oacute;n</i>, very kindly offered to translate
it into English.</p>
<p class="page"><b>{Page xii}</b></p>
<p>In the meantime a preliminary report embodying an abstract of the
<i>Relaci&oacute;n</i> had been prepared, and after some negotiation the
Manuscript was acquired by that indefatigable and zealous collector, Sir
Leicester Harms-worth, who, generously recognising that considerable
<i>kudos</i> attached to the discovery of such a valuable historical document,
kindly consented to its publication under my editorship.</p>
<p>Through the kind instrumentality of Dr Henry Thomas of the British Museum, a
photostat has just been obtained of a copy of the original Letter of Torres in
Spanish, preserved in the <i>Biblioteca Nacional</i> at Madrid. It is thus
possible to print for the first time the Spanish text of this important letter.
Mr Barwick has made an entirely fresh translation which is also given, and
which will be found to vary considerably from the hitherto accepted version. It
is to be hoped that the new translation will elucidate many of the doubtful
points which, ever since Burney's time (1806), have puzzled historians
endeavouring to interpret Torres' meaning.</p>
<p>To Mr Barwick is also due the re-discovery of copies of the four Prado Maps
in the Manuscript Department of the British Museum, where they have lain
practically unidentified for some eighty years, having apparently escaped
recognition by all writers on historical geography during that lengthy period.
They are fully described in the Bibliographical Notes at the end of the
introductory text (<i>Vide</i> p. <a href="#p76">76</a>).</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>NEW LIGHT ON THE DISCOVERY OF AUSTRALIA</h2>
<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h3>WHO DISCOVERED AUSTRALIA?</h3>
<p>Ask whom you will <i>Who discovered America</i>?--even the veriest tyro
would unhesitatingly reply <i>Christopher Columbus</i>, but to a similar
question <i>Who discovered Australia</i>? the answers would be surprisingly
diverse and uncertain. Many would confess at once <i>I don't know</i>, but a
few would probably add interrogatively <i>Wasn't it the French?</i> or
<i>Wasn't it the Portuguese?</i> Others again would exhibit equal uncertainty
by replying with a counter-question, <i>Wasn't it the Dutch in the Duifken?</i>
Some might even suggest <i>Captain Cook</i>, but he, of course, must be ruled
out absolutely, as obviously more than a hundred and fifty years too late.
Undoubtedly the majority of those having any pretensions to a knowledge of
historic geography would answer <i>The Spaniards under Quiros</i>, though a
few, still better informed, might attribute the discovery to <i>Torres</i>. It
is, however, safe to say that no one would have mentioned the name of that
comparatively unknown and hitherto much-maligned man <i>Captain Don Diego de
Prado y Tovar</i> (the author of the recently recovered
<i>Relaci&oacute;n</i>), to whom the honour of the first definite discovery of
Australia undoubtedly belongs, for, as will be seen, he succeeded to the
supreme command of the Quiros expedition under sealed orders opened at the
Island of Espiritu Santo, after Quiros himself had abandoned the voyage and
returned to America. This important fact, as revealed by the new
<i>Relaci&oacute;n</i>, is entirely new to history, for it has always hitherto
been supposed that the voyage was continued under the command of Torres alone.
We now learn that Prado, in company with Torres as his second in command,
completed the voyage to Manila, but instead of passing to the north of New
Guinea on the direct course, as provided for in the general orders, was
compelled by stress of weather to sail along the south coast. To that
fortuitous circumstance we owe not only the discovery of the tortuous passage
between New Guinea and Australia (now known as Torres Strait) but incidentally
the first definite discovery of Australia itself.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 2}</p>
<p>In case it should be thought that too much is being claimed for this new
<i>Relaci&oacute;n</i> in saying that it contains the first <i>definite</i>
account of the discovery of Australia, it will be sufficient to recall the fact
that whether Prado and Torres did, or did not, actually sight the mainland (on
which point historians differ), all the islands in the passage between New
Guinea and Cape York form part and parcel of Australia, for they are under the
jurisdiction of the Colony of Queensland. The Boundary of Queensland extends on
the north almost to the coast of New Guinea, including the Talbot Islands, and
on the \neast as far as the Great Barrier Reef, hence any islands discovered
within those lines, in latitudes higher than 9&deg; 20'S., may unquestionably
be claimed as Australia. The case is somewhat analogous to that of Columbus,
who discovered America in 1492. His landfall was certainly not on the mainland,
but on an island in the West Indies a long distance away from it, which island
has never been under the jurisdiction of any country on the mainland, and yet
no one would dispute the claim that Columbus discovered America. In the case of
Prado and Torres the islands they discovered, actually landed on and named, do
belong to the adjacent mainland of Australia, and many of them are only a few
miles away.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 3}</p>
<p>As the main object of the present volume is to reveal the new light shed by
Prado's <i>Relaci&oacute;n</i> on the voyage of Quiros, and more especially on
the discovery of Torres Strait and Australia, it does not come within our
province to discuss at any length the obscure problem of the gradual evolution
of the great continent from the "sea of darkness". Anyone wishing to follow the
general discovery of Australia in all its ramifications cannot do better than
consult Collingridge(*) in the first instance, for he discusses at great
length, in chronological sequence, every known or reputed voyage to <i>Terra
Australis</i> or <i>Australia</i> from the earliest times. There are of course
numerous other later historians whose works may also be consulted.</p>
<blockquote>[* Collingridge, George. <i>The Discovery of Australia</i>. 4to.
Sydney, 1895.]</blockquote>
<p>Australia is so large that the discovery at one period of any part of it has
little bearing on the discovery at other times of other portions which might
well be hundreds, if not thousands, of miles apart. There is of course some
sentimental interest in the vexed problem as to which nation first discovered
any part of the great continent, but all accounts of the earliest discoveries
are based more or less on supposition derived from insufficient or doubtful
evidence. Moreover the discoveries of the French and Portuguese, even if they
could be definitely authenticated, do not conflict in the slightest degree with
those of the Dutch and Spaniards, for those of the former are supposed to have
been made somewhere on the west side of Australia, whereas those of the latter
are definitely located on the north coast. Consequently it has not been thought
necessary to do more here than to touch very briefly on the claims made on
behalf of the French and Portuguese, but those of the Dutch, having more direct
relation to our subject, are discussed rather more fully. It will, however, be
realised that in setting forth in the present volume the immense importance of
the discoveries made by the Spaniards under Prado and Torres, one cannot
altogether ignore the rumoured previous discoveries of other nations, although
they were comparatively unimportant.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 4}</p>
<p>A good deal of the uncertainty existing as to the prime discovery of any
part of the great Australian continent appears to have arisen through the
confounding of the name Australia with the term <i>Terra Australis</i> as used
by the map makers of the sixteenth century to denote the lands depicted on
their charts in the austral regions. These imaginary lands were often shown as
completely encircling the antarctic region, and extending north in some places
to within fifteen degrees of the Equator. Hence the <i>Terra Australis</i>
supposed to have been discovered need not necessarily have been any part of the
Australia of to-day.</p>
<h4>A BRIEF RESUME OF THE CLAIMS TO THE EARLIEST DISCOVERY OF AUSTRALIA AS MADE
ON BEHALF OF THE FRENCH, THE PORTUGUESE AND THE DUTCH</h4>
<p><b>THE FRENCH</b>. Major in <i>Early Voyages to Terra Australis</i>, p.
xxiii, 1859(*), states "The earliest discovery of Australia to which claim has
been laid by any nation is that of a Frenchman, a native of Honfleur named
Binot Paulmier de Gonneville, who sailed from that port in June 1503 on a
voyage to the South Seas". Major devotes three pages to a recital of all that
was then known of Gonneville, but does not seem to give much credence to the
idea that his discoveries included Australia. In fact he appears to agree with
Burney(**) who says "let the whole account be reconsidered without
prepossession, and the idea that will immediately and most naturally occur, is,
that the Southern India discovered by Gonneville was Madagascar".</p>
<blockquote>[* Hakluyt Society, vol. xxv, 1859.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** Burney, James. <i>A chronological History of the Discoveries in
the South Sea or Pacific Ocean</i>. 5 vols. 4to. London, 1803. <i>Vide</i> 1,
379.]</blockquote>
<p>Little, if any, fresh evidence has come to light since Major's day, though
some modern historians seem to think that the maps of Pierre Descelier afford
indications that the French had some knowledge of land in the position of
Australia. Collingridge(*) on p. 93, in discussing the claim made for
Gonneville that he landed on the west coast of Australia in 1503, states that
it cannot be considered as having been established. In his Appendix, p. 210, he
deals with the matter in greater detail, and gives cogent reasons for his
conclusions that the French claim for Gonneville is untenable.</p>
<blockquote>[* <i>Op. cit. ante</i>, p. 3.]</blockquote>
<p class="page">{Page 5}</p>
<p><b>THE PORTUGUESE</b>. As to their supposed discovery of Australia, Major in
<i>Early Voyages</i>(*), p. xxi, 1859, thinks that a more reasonable claim than
that of the French may be advanced for the Portuguese, based on the evidence of
various manuscript maps still extant. He devotes over forty pages to a careful
analysis of the existing evidence, which is, however, merely cartographical. He
sums up his arguments concisely on p. lxiv as follows: "Our surmises,
therefore, lead us to regard it as highly probable that Australia was
discovered by the Portuguese between the years 1511 and 1529, and, almost to a
demonstrable certainty, that it was discovered before the year 1542". In 1861
Major strengthened his arguments, for in that year he published a Supplement to
his <i>Early Voyages</i> in which he announced the recent discovery in the
British Museum of a manuscript Mappemonde on which is marked a country "which I
shall presently show beyond all question to be Australia". Nevertheless, Major
at a later date, having come across fresh data in the meantime, seems to have
changed his mind, for he reverts to the subject in his famous book <i>Prince
Henry the Navigator</i> published in 1877, and therein sets forth his altered
views at great length.</p>
<blockquote>[* <i>Op. cit.</i> <i>ante</i>, p. 4.]</blockquote>
<p>Collingridge(*) on p. 93 states that in his opinion the claim to the
discovery of Australia on the western coast in 1601 by the Portuguese, under
Manoel Godinho de Eredia, cannot be considered as having been substantiated. In
his Appendix, p. 315, he discusses the question of the supposed earlier
discovery and quotes Major's altered views at some length. As far as the writer
is aware, no fresh evidence bearing on the Portuguese discoveries has come to
light since the time of Collingridge (1895).</p>
<blockquote>[* <i>Op. cit.</i> <i>ante</i>, p. 3.]</blockquote>
<p class="page">{Page 6}</p>
<p><b>THE DUTCH</b>. The claims for the French and Portuguese, as already
suggested, do not in any case conflict with those made for the Dutch and the
Spaniards, for the voyages were at different periods and the supposed landfalls
of the two former were at vast distances from those of the two latter. The
voyages of the Dutch and the Spaniards are, however, to a certain extent
intermingled, for they were contemporary (1606) and the places visited were
practically contiguous. The case for the Dutch is based on the supposed voyage
of the ship <i>Duifken</i>(*) in 1605-6, and the subject has been touched on
more or less extensively over a lengthy period by numerous writers on early
geographical discovery. An analysis of the opinions of four of them (perhaps
the best known of modern authorities), taken in chronological sequence, will be
sufficient to show that the question is still somewhat vexed, doubtless owing
to the fact that no actual contemporary documentary evidence is known to exist.
The story has consequently been deduced from sundry references to the voyage
made in documents of a later period, perhaps the most important of which bears
date as late as 1644. Nevertheless there are certainly good grounds for
believing that such a voyage was actually made, though the precise landfall in
Australia and even the definite date are both somewhat problematical.</p>
<blockquote>[* The spelling <i>Duifken</i> is copied from the Dutch as quoted
by Heeres. Other authorities give Duyfken, Duifhen, Duyfhen, etc.]</blockquote>
<p>1. <i>Collingridge</i>(*) (1895). Collingridge at the opening of his chapter
xl confesses that on entering upon the Dutch period of discovery in Australia
"we feel very diffident and ill at ease". He devotes nearly eight pages to a
lengthy analysis of the authenticity of the record of the <i>Duifken</i>, and
points out numerous discrepancies in the evidence on which the claim to the
discovery by that vessel is based. In particular he shows that the Journal of
Captain John Saris (as printed in <i>Purchas His Pilgrimes</i>, vol. 1, Part 2,
p. 385, 1625) does not actually mention the <i>Duifken</i> by name but refers
to another vessel called the <i>Little sunne</i>. In conclusion he states that
"the whole matter seems to resume (<i>sic</i>) itself into the examination of
the <i>provenance</i> or authenticity of the said documents" (i.e. the various
documents he has mentioned).</p>
<blockquote>[* <i>Op. cit.</i> <i>ante</i>, p. 3.]</blockquote>
<p class="page">{Page 7}</p>
<p>2. <i>Heeres</i>(*) (1899). Dr Heeres confesses that the Journal of the
voyage of the <i>Duifken</i> has not come clown to us, "so that we are fain to
infer its results from other data, and fortunately such are not wanting". He
then mentions some authentic documents of 1618, 1623 and 1644 which relate more
or less to the voyage of the <i>Duifken</i>. He refers to the Journal of
Carstensz of 1623 as containing important particulars of the voyages of his
predecessors in 1605-6, and mentions the fact that Carstensz had on board the
Chart of the <i>Duifken</i>, but was himself unable to find any open passage
such as appeared to be indicated on the said Chart. Heeres also describes the
recital of previous Dutch voyages which was prefixed to the Instructions issued
to Captain Abel Jansz Tasman in 1644, the first item of which actually
describes the voyage of the <i>Duifken</i> and its results. This document is
printed in full by Major in <i>Early Voyages</i>, pp. 43-4.</p>
<blockquote>[* Heeres, J. E. <i>The Part borne by the Dutch in the Discovery of
Australia, 1606-1765</i>. 4to. Leiden and London, 1889. In Dutch and
English.]</blockquote>
<p>3. <i>Heawood</i> (1912). Mr Edward Heawood, Librarian of the Royal
Geographical Society, in his concise and most useful reference manual,
<i>History of Geographical Discovery in the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries</i>(*), devotes several pages to the discovery of New Guinea and
Australia 1605 to 1642. He first discusses the voyage of the Dutch in the
<i>Duifken</i> and raises no doubt as to the credibility or reliability of the
collateral evidence relating thereto. Consequently his conclusion is "that the
priority of discovery undoubtedly belongs to the Dutch as compared with the
Spaniards under Torres".</p>
<blockquote>[* Cambridge, at the University Press, 1912. Cr. 8vo. <i>Vide</i>
chap. iii, pp. 70-1.]</blockquote>
<p class="page">{Page 8}</p>
<p>4. <i>Jack</i>(*) (1921). Mr R. Logan Jack in <i>Northmost Australia</i>
devotes several pages to the voyage of the <i>Duifken</i>. He merely repeats
and comments on the evidence already adduced by previous writers (principally
Heeres), but as he offers no new facts, it is not necessary to refer to him
further, especially as he expresses no definite opinion as to the credibility
of the evidence he re-exhibits or quotes.</p>
<blockquote>[* Jack, Robert Logan. <i>Northmost Australia. Three centuries of

<p>It is submitted that from the foregoing summary a reasonable deduction can
now be drawn that any claim for a French or Portuguese prime discovery may be
dismissed as too indefinite to be entertained. On the other hand the claim for
the Dutch in the <i>Duifken</i>, although not based on contemporary documents,
is so well supported by collateral evidence that it cannot well be doubted or
disproved. According to the evidence, the <i>Duifken</i> in 1605-6 sailed
eastward from Bantam along the south coast of New Guinea as far as the
beginning of Torres Strait, and then turning southward reached land on the west
coast of the Cape York Peninsula at about 13&frac34;&deg; S. Lat. Authorities
seem to be agreed that Willem Janszoon, the commander of the <i>Duifken</i>,
failed to recognise that there was a passage through to the east at the south
side of New Guinea, for it is generally supposed that he considered all the
land he had seen formed part of that great country.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 9}</p>
<p>The evidence hitherto existing on behalf of the voyage of the Spaniards in
1606 (i.e. the letters of Torres and Prado and the Prado maps) is now
enormously strengthened by the recovery of the lengthy <i>Relaci&oacute;n</i>
of Prado. All this evidence is not only firsthand but contemporary, and is thus
far more definite and convincing than the indirect accounts of the voyage of
the <i>Duifken</i>. The Dutch and Spanish voyages do not in any way conflict,
except on the one point as to which nation first sighted (quite unconsciously
in either case) the great continent of Australia. The Dutch approached
Australia from the west and returned without discovering or passing through the
strait. The Spaniards on the other hand came from the east, and by stress of
weather were forced into the eastern opening of the strait, through which they
picked their tortuous way amongst the numerous islands and shoals, and
ultimately completed the voyage to Manila along the south side of New
Guinea.</p>
<p>Taking all the circumstances into consideration it would appear that by
reason of the few months' priority in date, the honour of the first discovery
of any part of Australia cannot be denied to the Dutch. Let it be granted
therefore that the Dutch, coming from the west, were the first to discover
Australia on the west side of the strait, whilst the Spaniards, approaching
from the east, were the first to discover not only the strait itself but that
part of Australia adjacent thereto. But when we come to analyse the comparative
importance of the two voyages and the two discoveries, the palm must
unquestionably be awarded to the Spaniards, as the above brief contrast of the
results makes abundantly manifest. The Dutch in their own official recital of
the voyage of the <i>Duifken</i>, as prefixed to the Instructions to Tasman in
1644, practically admit the failure of that voyage, for it is stated that
nothing could be learned of the land or waters visited, so that "they were
obliged to leave the discovery unfinished". The Narrative is so interesting and
important that it may be as well to quote here the salient parts of it from
<i>Major's Early Voyages</i>, p. 43, where the document is printed in full.</p>

not learn anything of the land or waters, as had been desired of them, and, by
want of provisions and other necessaries, they were obliged to leave the
discovery unfinished; the furthest point of the land was called in their Map

<h4>THE SPANISH DISCOVERIES</h4>
<p>It is extremely difficult at this late date to trace the origin of the
popular myth that Quiros personally was the actual discoverer of of Australia.
The late Sir Clements Markham in his admirable work on the <i>Voyages of
Quiros</i> edited for, and published by, the Hakluyt Society in 1904(*),
summarises all that was known at that time about the voyage in 1605-6 when
Quiros set sail from Peru under a mandate from the King of Spain, in search of
unknown but rumoured lands in the southern seas. It is probable that the name
<i>Austrialia del Espiritu Santo</i>(**) which Quiros had given to a large
island discovered early in his voyage, and which he mistook for continental
land, may have become confounded as time progressed with the name
<i>Australia</i> afterwards popularly conferred on the great continent as we
know it to day. Be this as it may, the fable that Quiros was the discoverer of
the real Australia gained almost general acceptance, until Markham's book
showed conclusively that he had nothing whatever to do with the discovery and
never came within a thousand miles of the great continent.</p>
<blockquote>[* <i>The Voyages of Pedro Fernandez de Quiros, 1595 to 1606</i>.
Translated and edited by Sir Clements Markham, K.C.B., P.R.G.S., President of
the Hakluyt Society. In 2 vols. London. Printed for the Hakluyt Society 1904.
(Second Series, vols. xiv and xv.) Herein afterwards cited as Markham, <i>Op.
cit.</i>, or simply Markham or M.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** Cf. Markham, <i>Op. cit.</i> pp. xxv, xxx, 251, 442, 470, 487,
503, 507, etc.]</blockquote>
<p class="page">{Page 11}</p>
<p>Notwithstanding all that Markham wrote in 1904, the fiction still persists,
and seems actually to have gained ground during the last twenty years or so. It
will hardly be credited that one of London's leading daily journals, usually
well informed and reliable, printed, as recently as August 1928, a special
article on <i>The Discovery of Australia</i>, in which the long since exploded
Quiros myth was resuscitated, and supported by considerable plausible detail.
The article announced the recent acquisition by an American dealer of some
hitherto unknown documents relating to "<i>Pedro Fernandez de Quiros the
discoverer of Australia</i>", and a facsimile of his handwriting was given,
lettered "<i>The Signature of Pedro Fernandez de Quiros the discoverer of
Australia</i>". The article proceeded to give a brief account of how Quiros in
December 1605 set sail with two ships from Callao on a voyage of discovery in
the "<i>unknown austral regions of the South Sea</i>". We are then told that
"<i>The expedition discovered the islands which fringe the coast of Australia,
and the two ships becoming separated in a storm Quiros returned to Mexico while
the other ship went to Manila...It will be seen therefore that while Captain
Pedro Fernandez de Quiros came within sight of the great Australian Continent
and actually discovered the outlying islands he never reached the continent
itself</i>". What delightful romance, so plausible and convincing and yet all
pure imagination! The only grain of truth in the whole of the above quotation
is the distorted fact that the ships <i>did</i> become separated in a storm,
and that <i>Quiros did</i> actually return to Mexico, but the storm and the
departure for Mexico did not occur anywhere near Australia. Quiros must have
possessed the longest sight of any man on record if he really "<i>came within
sight of the great Australian Continent</i>", for the nearest point he ever
reached was the Island of <i>Espiritu Santo</i> in the New Hebrides group,
roughly some fourteen hundred miles away! It was at this island that the storm
occurred during which Quiros turned back to America.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 12}</p>
<p>The writer pointed out to the editor of the journal in question the
inaccuracy of its statements (as did at least one other correspondent), but, as
far as he is aware, no correction or retraction was ever vouchsafed. It can
only be presumed, therefore, that the editor and his contributor are still of
the opinion that Quiros discovered Australia, and are peacefully enjoying that
blissful state which Gray seems to suggest 'twould be folly to disturb. For
that reason this most amazing journalistic "bloomer" of modern times, which has
so amused the geographical world, is placed on record here as an excellent
example of the modern pernicious, but very prevalent, practice of writing on
historic subjects without first verifying the prime sources of information. By
the neglect of this precaution the erroneous deductions of the writers of one
generation become the accepted truths of the next. Fictions and the facts from
which they emanate become so inextricably mingled that often the original
modicum of truth is distorted, obscured and finally lost. Only by an
independent analysis of basic facts and the sweeping away of the superincumbent
fictions of successive writers quoting and enlarging one from another, can we
hope to arrive at a solution of some of the many mysteries which becloud early
geographical history. The present investigation, as will be seen, has brought
to light several curious and flagrant examples of the way in which historic
facts have gradually become distorted over a long period of years, owing to
mistranslations or misinterpretations of the meaning of the original
writer.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 13}</p>
<p>It was not until seven months after the article on <i>The Discovery of
Australia</i> had appeared in the journal in question, that the editor on
Easter Saturday, March 30, 1929 (perhaps the slackest day in the whole
journalistic year), published the writer's letter in much abbreviated form,
from which had been eliminated all direct correction or contradiction of the
error of August 1928, which it was no doubt thought had faded into oblivion in
the meantime. Only a preliminary announcement was made of the discovery of the
new manuscript and the intended publication of it in the present volume. By a
strange coincidence the same journal published on May 3, 1929, a leading
article on "The Long Bow", and cited several instances of bogus claims to
geographical discovery, e.g. Mandeville, De Rougemont, Dr Cook, etc., etc., but
curiously enough no reference was made to its own "long bow" in championing
Quiros as the Discoverer of Australia, a claim that poor Quiros never made for
himself.</p>
<p>Antiquarian booksellers seem also to be marching with the times, for they
are frequently responsible for the further propagation of the Quiros fable.
When offering for sale in their Catalogues material relating to Quiros they
generally make erroneous reference to his discovery of Australia. Book
auctioneers also seem to be imbued with this spirit of the times, for as
recently as June 24, 1929, Sotheby's Catalogue, under Lot 30, described Hessel
Gerritsz's Collection of the voyages of Hudson, Quiros and others, published at
Amsterdam in 1612, as "the first printed account of Hudson's discoveries in
North America and the second published account of the discovery of the Northern
Coast of Australia by Quiros".</p>
<p>These instances are mentioned as tending to show how deeply rooted and
widely disseminated is the Quiros myth, and how difficult it appears to be to
eradicate it. It is to be hoped that the new Prado <i>Relaci&oacute;n</i> will
now give the <i>coup-de-gr&acirc;ce</i> to this long-persistent Quiros hydra,
though it must not be forgotten that Theodore Hook once wrote that "a reply to
a newspaper resembles very much the attempt of Hercules to crop the Hydra
without the slightest chance of his ultimate success".</p>
<p class="page">{Page 14}</p>
<h4>THE <i>RELACI&Oacute;N</i> OF CAPTAIN DON DIEGO DE PRADO Y TOVAR</h4>
<p>It is greatly to be regretted that the discovery of the Prado manuscript was
not made in Sir Clements Markham's time, so that he could have included an
account of it in his book on the <i>Voyages of Quiros</i>. One can imagine how
overjoyed that eminent geographer would have been to have had the opportunity
of collating the new <i>Relaci&oacute;n</i> with the existing Narratives of
Belmonte Bermudez, Gaspar de Leza and Torquemada(*). At the same time we cannot
but realise how different would have been his estimate of the respective
characters of Quiros and Prado, after he had weighed impartially the new facts
in the entirely independent <i>Relaci&oacute;n</i> of the latter, against the
three above-mentioned narrations all apparently more or less inspired or
influenced by Quiros himself.</p>
<blockquote>[* All printed by Markham]</blockquote>
<p>It is not of course a congenial task to have to traverse the deductions
drawn by so eminent an authority as Sir Clements Markham from evidence existing
in his time. The <i>Relaci&oacute;n</i> of Prado is however so clear and
circumstantial, and is moreover so obviously confirmed by the letters of Torres
and Prado and the four Prado Maps already known and hereinafter reprinted(*),
that it is impossible to doubt that it bears the impress of truth.</p>
<blockquote>[* <i>Vide</i> Appendix]</blockquote>
<p>Prado's description of events up to the separation of the ships at
<i>Espiritu Santo</i> agrees in the main with the three existing Narratives,
but his account of the continuation of the voyage to Manila covers entirely new
ground. He gives a detailed record of events following the departure of %tiros,
hitherto only known from the very scanty account given by Torres in his letter
to the King dated from Manila, July 12, 1607, and from Prado's four maps, and
from his two letters sent home from Goa in 1613(*).</p>

<h4>TERRA AUSTRALIS INCOGNITA</h4>
<p>Before describing the newly discovered <i>Relaci&oacute;n</i> it may be as
well to state briefly what was apparently known about "<i>Terra Australis
incognita</i>" prior to the Voyage of Quiros in 1605-6, and also to give a
short r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the principal facts hitherto known respecting
that Voyage, as detailed by Sir Clements Markham in his aforementioned book or
recorded by other writers. Afterwards it is proposed to collate the existing
knowledge of the Voyage with the new information to be derived from Prado's
<i>Relaci&oacute;n</i>, and then to comment on the differences.</p>
<p>During the latter half of the sixteenth century, rumours which had long
prevailed as to the existence of a great Antarctic Continent, became so
persistent that the map makers of the period began to insert on their maps
large tracts of continental land in the Southern Seas, sometimes unnamed, but
generally marked "Terra Incognita", "Terra Australis", or "Terra Australis
nondum cognita", etc., etc. Amongst such world-maps may be mentioned those of
<i>Orontius Finaeus</i> 1531, <i>Vopelius</i> 1543, <i>Demongenet</i> 1552,
<i>Ortelius</i> 1570, <i>Gerardus de Jode</i> 1578, <i>Mercator</i> 1587,
<i>Gerardus de Jode</i> 1589, <i>Cornelius de Jode</i> 1593 and <i>Myritius</i>
1596. Reproductions of most of these maps may be seen in Nordenski&ouml;ld's
<i>Facsimile Atlas</i> published in 1889. There are of course many others, but
these will serve as examples.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 16}</p>
<p>The maps of Ortelius, Mercator and Gerardus de Jode (1589) show <i>Nova
Guinea</i> as a complete Island with a narrow strait between it and the
continental land marked <i>Terra Australis</i> etc. On the first two of these
maps the following two legends appear in identical terms: <i>Nova Guinea nuper
inventa que an sit insula an pars continentis Australis incertu est</i>--New
Guinea lately discovered whereof it is uncertain whether it be an island or
part of the Austral Continent--<i>Hanc continentem Australem, nonnulli
Magellanicam regionem ab eius inuentore nuncupant</i>--This Austral Continent
some call the Magellanic region from its discoverer. The second legend also
appears on the map of <i>Gerardus de Jode</i> 1589. On the hemispherical
world-map of <i>Cornelius de Jode</i> 1593, <i>Nova Guinea</i> is not marked at
all, but on that of <i>Myritius</i> it is laid down and named as actually
forming part of the mainland, which is lettered <i>Terra Australis nondum bene
cognita</i>.</p>
<p>In such of the above-mentioned maps as show a passage between New Guinea and
Terra Australis, the strait is never laid down in its true place between 9&deg;
and 11&deg; S. Lat., but always much farther south in varying positions between
18&deg; and 22&deg;. This fact alone tends to demonstrate that any knowledge of
the supposed strait had not been derived from actual observation, but was
merely hypothetical. Nevertheless some modern writers are inclined to the
belief that Torres had a definite knowledge of the strait and was making for it
on his voyage to Manila, but it is shown later on(*) that this conclusion
cannot be substantiated. It is clear, however, that there must have been
rumours of a supposed passage, for the strait is definitely mentioned by
Wytfliet in 1597 in the text of his book(**), but even his knowledge appears to
have been based on legendary supposition.</p>
<blockquote>[* <i>Infra</i>, pp. 46-7.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** <i>Vide</i> infra, p. 20]</blockquote>
<p class="page">{Page 17}</p>
<p>The curious hypothetical representations of various prime discoveries, which
occur more or less on all early maps, both manuscript and printed, are amongst
the most abstruse problems with which students of historic cartography have to
contend, for it is generally not only difficult to trace their origin, but
still more difficult to disprove them altogether. When, as frequently occurs,
these cartographical vagaries are used and quoted as definite evidence in
support of modern theories of early geographical discovery, the results are
often extremely ludicrous. An amusing example (somewhat analogous to the
present case of the supposed strait to the south of New Guinea) is that of the
American journalist who, when reviewing in 1903 the then recent publication of
the facsimile of the great Waldseem&uuml;ller map of 1507, emphasised the fact
that on that map the North and South American continents were not joined, and
that therefore the Panama Canal was merely the re-opening of the old channel
which must have become silted up during the intervening centuries.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most interesting of all the early maps relating to New Guinea
and the strait is the large-scale special one of "NOVAE GVINEAE Forma &amp;
Situs" which appears as No. 12 in Cornelius de Jode's Atlas of 1593 <i>Speculum
Orbis Terrae</i>. This map is so rare that it has been thought desirable to
reproduce it here in reduced facsimile(*). The east end of New Guinea is shown
with a wide strait between it and a large tract of unnamed continental land, in
the position of Australia, extending from the Tropic of Capricorn southward to
56&deg;, where it is cut off unfinished by the bottom border line. The east and
west sides are similarly cut off. It will be observed that the strait in its
narrowest part is here laid down between 20&deg; and 23&deg;, which fact alone
militates against the authenticity of the whole map. Consequently we cannot
accept the large tract of land to the south of the strait as representing a
continent actually known. This is unfortunate, for the interior of the country
is embellished with ranges of mountains, and pictures of a dragon, a lion, a
serpent, and a hunter armed with bow and arrows. If this map could have been
definitely identified as part of the continent we now know as Australia, we
should have here the very first pictorial representation of Australian
fauna.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 18}</p>
<p>The sea is similarly decorated with a ship in full sail and several
nondescript sea-monsters. In any case this map is an excellent example of the
methods employed by the map makers of the period to portray rumoured
discoveries from insufficient data. It shows also how it was the custom to fill
in vacant spaces with pictorial embellishments at the fancy of the draughtsman.
Further proof that this map cannot be considered as authentic is given in the
Latin inscription engraved on it in the interior of New Guinea, which
(translated) reads:</p>
<p class="quote">New Guinea. So called by the sailors, because its shores and
character greatly resemble the land of Guinea in Africa. Whether it joins on to
the Austral land or is an Island is unknown.</p>
<blockquote>[* <i>Vide</i> p. 19, size of the original 8&frac12; by 13 5/8
inches at the plate mark.]</blockquote>
<p>A long Latin description of the map, type-printed on the verso, states:</p>
<p class="quote">This Region up to the present day is almost wholly unknown,
for after the first and second voyage, navigation hither has been omitted, so
that up to this time it is doubtful whether it be mainland or an island. The
sailors called it New Guinea, because the shores, position and character of
this region greatly resemble the land of Guinea in Africa. It seems to have
been called Peccinacolij by, Andreas Corsalius. On the South of this region is
the great tract of the Austral land, which when explored may form the fifth
part of the world, so wide and vast is it thought to he. On the east it has the
Solomon Islands, on the North is the Archipelago of S. Lazarus, and it begins
at two or three degrees below the Equator. On the west, if it be not an island,
it is joined to the Austral land.</p>

<p>Unquestionably the most important and relevant maps of this period are the
two (here reproduced) which are found in Cornelius Wytfliet's <i>Descriptionis
Ptolemaicae Augmentum</i> first published in Latin at Louvain in 1597, for on
p. 101 of the descriptive text accompanying them is the following remarkable
passage, wherein the strait is definitely mentioned:</p>
<p class="page">{Page 19} [Map of NOVAE GVINAE--see below]</p>
<p class="page">{Page 20}</p>
<p class="quote">Australis igitur terra omnium aliarum terrarum australissima,

<p class="quote">The terra Australis is therefore the southernmost of all other
lands, directly beneath the antarctic circle; extending beyond the tropic of
Capricorn to the West, it ends almost at the equator itself, and separated by a
narrow strait lies on the East opposite to New Guinea, only known so far by a
few shores because after one voyage and another that route has been given up
and unless sailors are forced and driven by stress of winds it is seldom
visited. The terra Australis begins at two or three degrees below the equator
and it is said by some to be of such magnitude that if at any time it is fully
discovered they think it will be the fifth part of the world. Adjoining Guinea
on the right are the numerous and vast Solomon Islands which lately became
famous by the voyage of Alvarus Mendanius.</p>
<p>It will be observed that this translation varies considerably from that
given by Major in <i>Early Voyages</i>, p. lxix.</p>

<p>Wytfliet's statement, made in his book published as early as 1597, is so
very definite that it is difficult to believe he was not in possession of some
actual information on which to base it. On the other hand the strait is laid
down on his maps in the latitude of 18&deg; to 22&deg; S., whereas the actual
position of Torres Strait is approximately 9&deg; to 11&deg; S. Hence it would
appear that whatever knowledge Wytfliet possessed was merely suppositional. On
the contemporary English map by Emmerie Mollineux, published by Hakluyt in his
<i>Principal Navigations</i> in 1599, and generally considered to be the most
accurate world-map made up to that date, the south side of <i>New Guinea</i> is
shown incomplete and there is no sign of <i>Terra Australis incognita</i>.
Hence it may fairly be concluded that nothing definite was then known about the
south side of New Guinea and the strait between it and Australia, or Hakluyt
would have caused the details to be shown on his map.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 21}</p>
<h4>RESUM&Eacute; OF THE VOYAGE OF QUIROS AND ITS CONTINUATION AS HITHERTO
KNOWN</h4>
<p>In the year 1602 a Portuguese pilot and navigator, Captain Fernandez de
Quiros (often cited as De Quir), who had already made several voyages in the
Pacific Ocean, laid before the Court of Spain a grand project for a new voyage
of exploration in southern waters, in the hope of finding the rumoured great
Antarctic Continent of <i>Terra Australis</i> or other lands and islands. After
many months of negotiation, he so impressed the Spanish Court with his own firm
belief in the existence of such a continent, and the great importance to Spain
of its discovery (not only in the acquisition of new territory, but also in the
glory of the conversion of the inhabitants to the true faith), that King Philip
III eventually looked with favour on his proposals. By Royal Orders dated March
1603 the Viceroy of Peru was directed to furnish Quiros with two suitable
ships, properly equipped for the purpose of enabling the projected voyage to be
undertaken.</p>
<p>Quiros set out from Spain for Peru in the summer of 1603, but having been
delayed on the way by shipwreck and other unexpected causes, he did not arrive
in Lima till March 1605, and it was December 21 in that year before he actually
sailed on his momentous voyage from Callao, the Port of Lima. The expedition
consisted of two ships and a small launch or tender. The senior ship bore the
name <i>San Pedro y San Pablo</i> and was commanded by Quiros himself, with
Captain Don Diego de Prado y Tovar (the writer of the newly discovered
manuscript) as second in command. The second ship named the <i>San Pedrico</i>
was under the charge of Captain Luis Vaez de Torres. The launch was named
<i>Los Tres Reyes</i> and was captained by Pedro Bernal de Cerme&ntilde;o.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 22}</p>
<p>Quiros and Torres, attended by the launch, sailed in company towards the
west-south-west, discovering many small islands on their way, until on May 1,
1606, they found themselves in a large bay, which Quiros named St Philip and St
James, on the north side of a large island which he mistook for continental
land and to which he gave the name of <i>Austrialia del Espiritu Santo</i>. It
seems that Quiros and Prado could not agree, so that some few weeks before the
ships arrived at <i>Espiritu Santo</i>, Prado, by his own desire and with the
consent of Quiros, had transferred himself to the <i>San Pedrico</i>, at the
Island of <i>Taumaco</i>, and consequently was henceforth associated with
Torres. [<i>Vide</i> Prado's account of this incident quoted on <a href=
"#p29">p. 29.</a>]</p>
<p>The ships remained for several weeks in the Bay of <i>St Philip and St
James</i>, exploring in all directions, until on June 11 Quiros' ship, the
<i>San Pedro y San Pablo</i>, broke away in a gale and never afterwards
rejoined the <i>San Pedrico</i> and the launch. The island of <i>Espiritu
Santo</i> was the nearest point to the great continent of Australia (some
fourteen hundred miles away) ever reached by Quiros personally. For instead of
returning to the bay, or proceeding to the island of <i>Santa Cruz</i>, the
rendezvous he had himself appointed in case of the separation of the ships(*),
he shaped his course to the north and east and returned to America, arriving at
<i>Acapulco</i> on November 23, 1606. The mystery of the reasons which caused
Quiros suddenly to abandon the voyage and return to America has never hitherto
been satisfactorily explained. No less than three different narratives of the
voyage of Quiros as far as the island of <i>Espiritu Santo</i> and his return
to America are in existence(**), but not one of these offers any adequate
explanation, probably for the reason that they were all more or less inspired
by Quiros himself.</p>
<blockquote>[* Cf. Markham, pp. 184-5.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** All printed by Markham]</blockquote>
<p class="page">{Page 23}</p>
<p>As to what happened to the <i>San Pedrico</i> and the launch after the
departure of Quiros, and how the voyage was continued and completed, very
little has been known up to the present. All the evidence hitherto available
was derived from a letter which Torres wrote to the King of Spain from Manila
in July 1607, and from four maps made by Prado in 1606 now preserved at
Simancas, or from two very short letters which Prado sent home to the King from
Goa in 1613(*). From Torres' letter we learn that they remained in the bay for
fifteen days, when finding Quiros did not return "we took Your Majesty's orders
and held a consultation with the officers of the launch. It was determined that
we should fulfil them"(2). Accordingly they proceeded as far south as 21&deg;
S. Lat. in search of new lands, and not finding any, they followed their
instructions and turned to the north, shaping their course for Manila. They
were evidently intending to proceed on the direct known course to the north of
New Guinea, but Torres tells us in his letter that after falling in "with the
beginning of New Guinea,...I could not weather the east point, so I coasted
along to the westward on the south side"(**), that is to say on the side
directly opposite to Australia. To that lucky chance of failing to weather the
east point of New Guinea we owe the unconscious discovery of Australia. Torres
of course had no idea of the importance of the discoveries which were being
made to the south of New Guinea, for he devotes only a few lines to the mention
of this part of the voyage. But from the very meagre details he does give, many
geographers are agreed in supposing that in addition to discovering "islands
without number" in the strait, he must actually have sighted the great
continent of Australia, having presumably mistaken the narrow northern point of
Cape York for a large island. Torres definitely mentions that before they could
get clear of the shoals they sailed as far south as 11&deg; S. Lat., which is
considerably farther to the south than the latitude of Cape York. All doubts
and suppositions on these points are resolved by the lengthy details given in
Prado's <i>Relaci&oacute;n</i>.</p>

<h4>THE <i>RELACI&Oacute;N</i> OF CAPTAIN DON DIEGO DE PRADO Y TOVAR</h4>
<p align="center"><a name="p24" id="p24"></a><i>(Continued from <a href=
"#p15">page 15.</a>)</i></p>
<p>An account has already been given in the editor's preface as to how this
most important manuscript was recovered after having been lost to sight for
more than three hundred years, and how it was identified as being wholly in the
handwriting of Prado.</p>
<p>The manuscript is foolscap folio in size and consists of sixteen leaves,
very closely and neatly written on both sides, making thirty-two pages in all,
containing in the Spanish about nineteen thousand words, equivalent in the
English translation to about twenty-two thousand seven hundred and fifty words.
In condition it is clean and sound, doubtless due to the fact that it has been
preserved with numerous other Spanish manuscripts stitched together and bound
in a limp vellum cover, perhaps two hundred years or more ago.</p>
<p>As the present volume must necessarily be largely supplementary to the
<i>Voyages of Quiros</i> edited by the late Sir Clements Markham in 1904(*), it
has been thought desirable to print it in the same size (viz. demy 8vo). To
reproduce the entire manuscript in facsimile in the size of the original
(foolscap folio) would defeat that object, and would moreover add greatly to
the cost of the volume. Furthermore the manuscript, although very clear and
legible, is somewhat difficult to read owing to the spelling of the period, and
the numerous contractions used. Hence it has been thought best to print it in
the form of a transliteration into modern Spanish with the contractions
expanded. The first and last pages of the manuscript are reproduced in reduced
facsimile as illustrative plates (<i>Vide</i> pp. <a href="#illust-04">85</a>
and <a href="#illust-05">206</a>).</p>
<blockquote>[* <i>Vide</i> footnote, p. 10.]</blockquote>
<p class="page">{Page 25}</p>
<p>The title-heading(*) (translated) reads as follows:</p>
<p style="font-size: 90%" align="center"><i>JESUS MARIA JOSEPH</i></p>
<p class="quote"><i>Summary relation of the discovery begun by Pero Fernandez
de Quiros, a Portuguese, in the Southern Sea in the southern parts up to the
island of Irenei called by him the Great Astrialia of the Holy Spirit, and
completed for him by Captain Don Diego de Prado, now a monk of our father Saint
Basil the Great of Madrid, with the help of Captain Luis Baes de Torres in the
ship San Pedrico in the year 1607(**) up to the city of Manila on the 22 of May
of the said year, to the honour and glory of the omnipotent God, Amen.</i></p>
<blockquote>[* <i>Vide</i> the facsimile on p. <a href=
"#illust-04">85.</a>]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** Cf. p. <a href="#p42">42</a> and facsimile on p. <a href=
"#illust-04">85.</a>]</blockquote>
<p>Just above Prado's title-heading the following inscription in Spanish (but
here translated) appears in a later hand(*), doubtless written before the
volume was bound. It was evidently intended as a filing-heading, after the
manner of an ordinary endorsement.</p>
<blockquote>[* <i>Vide</i> the facsimile on p. <a href=

<p class="quote"><i>Discovery made by Pero Fernandez de Quiros in the Southern
land, and completed for him by Don Diego de Prado who was afterwards a monk of
the Order of S. Basil.</i></p>
<p>About one-quarter of the manuscript relates to events which took place
whilst Prado was still associated with Quiros as captain in the <i>San Pedro y
San Pablo</i>. A small portion describes what happened between the time of
Prado's transference to the <i>San Pedrico</i> about the middle of April 1606,
and the separation of the ships on June 11. The remainder gives a detailed
account of his continuation of the voyage to Manila in company with Torres. It
will thus be seen that about three-quarters of the whole manuscript is virgin
material.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 26}</p>
<p>The geographical record given by Prado in the first part of the manuscript,
of the discoveries made prior to the separation of the ships, covers much the
same ground as the existing narratives inspired by Quiros. But Prado's
<i>Relaci&oacute;n</i> was written from an entirely independent point of view,
hence the details he gives of certain events vary considerably from the other
accounts. The chief interest of his graphic narrative, down to the time of the
separation of the ships, lies, however, in the lengthy personal details he
gives of the character and actions of Quiros. Although his statements may not
be considered absolutely impartial, it must be admitted that they are
apparently written in good faith and in straightforward and definite terms.
Moreover they confirm in a remarkable manner certain other contemporary
independent documents which undoubtedly cast grave doubts on the <i>bona
fides</i> of Quiros. (Cf. the Letter of Torres, the Memorial of Dr Juan Luis
Arias, the Memorial of Don Fernando de Castro, etc., etc., all printed by
Markham.)</p>
<p>Notwithstanding that Markham refers to all these various documents, he sums
up Quiros as a very skilful pilot--a great navigator and idealist, but
unfortunate in his enterprises in not meeting with due recognition and
recompense for his great services--and a hardly used man, worn out by years of
wearisome and unsuccessful solicitation at the Court of Spain for further
employment as commander of another expedition to attempt further discoveries in
the Southern Seas. Entirely new and important information explaining the
reasons why Quiros met with such ill success at Court after his return from his
expedition of 1606, has come to hand in a Report of the Council of State to the
King in 1608, a copy of which has just (July 1929) been secured from Spain and
which is fully described on pp. 55-6 <i>infra</i>.</p>
<p>There has always been much uncertainty as to the reasons which caused Quiros
so suddenly to abandon his expedition and return to America, leaving the other
two ships to continue the voyage. A document preserved in the British Museum,
the <i>Memorial of Dr Juan Luis Arias</i> to Philip III King of Spain, written
about 1615, states the case most concisely even at that early date.
(<i>Vide</i> Markham, p. 525.)</p>
<p class="page">{Page 27}</p>
<p class="quote">For certain reasons (they ought to have been very weighty)
which hitherto have not been ascertained with entire certainty, Pedro Fernandez
de Quiros left the <i>Almiranta</i> [i.e. Torres' ship] and the launch in the
said bay [i.e. the Bay of St Philip and St James] and himself sailed with his
ship the <i>Capitana</i> for Mexico, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
<p>This doubt existing as early as 1615 has never been fully resolved until the
recent recovery of Prado's manuscript. Markham, evidently basing his
introductory story on the existing narratives, merely implies that the breaking
away of Quiros' ship was unavoidable, for the reason that Quiros himself was
too ill to come on deck and that the pilots, losing their heads in the
confusion caused by the storm, eventually stood out to sea before the wind and,
being unable to regain the Bay, decided to return to America(*). Torres in his
letter to the King from Manila, July 12, 1607, tells a very different tale(**),
as also does Prado in his letter to Antonio de Arostegui, the King's secretary,
dated from Goa, December 24, 1613(***). In this letter Prado definitely states
that the crew mutinied and carried off the ship with Quiros as prisoner.
Markham, commenting on the fact that Quiros does not mention any actual mutiny,
merely states that "his enemy Prado y Tovar, who must have got his information
from the men who remained at Mexico, and perhaps afterwards found their way to
the Philippines, makes the assertion ". But Markham does not seem to attach the
slightest credence to this assertion of Prado, although in the same letter he
(Prado) speaks of the incipient mutiny whilst he was still on board the
<i>Capitana</i> with Quiros. Here are Prado's own words: "I knew what took
place on board, took part in it, and as it was not in conformity with the good
of the service of Your Majesty I could not stay. So I disembarked at Taumaco
and went to the <i>Almiranta</i> [i.e. Torres' ship] where I was well
received".</p>
<blockquote>[* <i>Vide</i> Markham, pp. xxv and xxvi.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** <i>Vide</i> Appendix I]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[*** <i>Vide</i> Appendix II]</blockquote>
<p class="page">{Page 28}</p>
<p>Here then is the reason for finding Prado associated with Torres in the
second ship. In the newly discovered manuscript Prado relates this incident in
detail, telling how he and Torres had continually remonstrated with Quiros
about his actions and warned him of the imminent mutiny, until at last he
(Prado) was so disgusted at Quiros' dilatoriness and inattention to the orders
he had received for the King's service that he craved permission, which was
granted, to remove to Torres' ship. The transference took place about the
middle of April 1606.</p>
<p>Markham seems to have formed a most unfavourable opinion of the character of
Prado, in fact he goes so far as to accuse him of "stirring up mutiny and
disaffection on board" (Markham, p. xxii). Again on p. xxix he describes him as
a mutinous officer who was "sent on board the <i>Almiranta</i>" by Quiros. On
pp. xxxii and xxxiii, when mentioning the letters and maps sent home by Prado
from Goa, Markham returns to the attack and describes him as "the malignant
enemy of Quiros" and further states that "the abuse of Quiros by this
insubordinate officer can be taken for what it is worth".</p>
<p>It is submitted that from the evidence existing at the time, all of which he
exhibits in his book, Markham does not seem to have had any adequate foundation
for such very severe condemnation. He appears to have erroneously assumed that
Prado must have been a mutinous officer simply because, by his own statement,
he left the <i>Capitana</i> and went to the <i>Almiranta</i>, but it makes all
the difference in the world whether he transferred himself by permission or was
"sent on board the <i>Almiranta</i>" by Quiros, as Markham definitely states.
In the quotation from his letter given above, Prado, after referring to the
mutiny, simply says: "So I disembarked at Taumaco and went to the
<i>Almiranta</i> where I was well received ". The new <i>Relaci&oacute;n</i>
explains in full the circumstances of the transference and the reasons for it,
and clearly shows that Prado was anything but a mutinous officer. Instead of
stirring up mutiny he seems to have done his best to quell it. Here is the
story told in his own words:</p>
<p class="page">{Page 29}</p>
<p class="quote"><a name="p29" id="p29"></a>Captain Don Diego de Prado knowing
for certain that the men of the Capitana were going to mutiny informed the said
Quiros by way of confession through the Father Commissary of the Franciscans,
who told the said Don Diego that he also knew it and had informed him [i.e.
Quiros] and would do so again, but the said Quiros took no notice of it, so the
said Don Diego, seeing the little remedy that was to be expected, asked leave
of the said Quiros to pass to the <i>Almiranta</i>...he granted it to get rid
of the bother...The said Don Diego knew who were the mutineers and how they
wanted him for head, but he did not want to mix in such conflicts and lose the
honour which he had gained in the service of his Majesty, so he at once shifted
his things to the Almiranta, whereat the Captain thereof [i.e. Torres] was very
pleased. The next day the surgeon did the same. [<i>Vide</i> pp. 112-13.]</p>
<p>Prado's narrative is so circumstantial and clear throughout that it may be
said to carry conviction with it, and its truth is largely corroborated by the
aforementioned existing independent evidence. Surely, as no adequate reason has
ever been given for the defection of Quiros at <i>Espiritu Santo</i>, no one
who reads Prado's account (as quoted above) of the imminent mutiny at the time
he left the <i>Capitana</i>, can have any doubt that the mutineers carried off
the ship at the time of the storm on June 11 and compelled Quiros to return to
America. This view is amply confirmed by the account given by Prado near the
end of his <i>Relaci&oacute;n</i>, derived from information he received after
he reached Manila from some sailors who had been in the <i>Capitana</i> at the
time and had returned with Quiros to America and had since voyaged to the
Philippines. (<i>Vide</i> pp. 194-7.)</p>
<p>Little has hitherto been known of Prado beyond the very brief mention made
of him in the narratives of Belmonte Bermudez, Leza and Torquemada. But even
before the recovery of Prado's <i>Relaci&oacute;n</i>, his two short letters
sent home from Goa in 1613, addressed to King Philip III and to the King's
secretary, Antonio de Arostegui, make very grave charges against the character
and actions of Quiros.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 30} Markham seems to have regarded these letters merely
as the <i>ex parte</i> abusive statements of a mutinous officer, and yet he
admits the great interest and value of the four maps made by Prado in 1606. In
his detailed account of them Markham states (pp. 469-73) that "all the maps are
signed by Diego de Prado y Tovar, who thus claims to be their author. The
surveys were no doubt made by Torres himself or by his Chief Pilot
Fuentidue&ntilde;as". Markham further testifies to the accuracy of these maps
as proved by comparison with the surveys of modern times. Now if the accuracy
of the maps is thus proved and admitted, what reason can there be for doubting
the truth and accuracy of the descriptive legends upon them(*) which are
largely amplified in detail by the new manuscript Many of the places marked on
the maps are mentioned in the <i>Relaci&ograve;n</i>, as hereinafter noted.
Again, if the accuracy of the maps and their descriptions is admitted, what
reason can there be for questioning the truth of the other statements about
Quiros made by Prado in his letters to the King, the details of which are fully
set forth in the new manuscript? When we remember that Quiros returned direct
to Mexico after the separation of the ships instead of proceeding to Manila
(thereby entirely ignoring the orders and instructions he had himself
promulgated for the conduct of the expedition in such an event, and also
contravening the sealed orders given by the Viceroy of Peru for the conduct of
the expedition in case of the separation of the ships (<i>Vide</i> infra, p.
34), what reason can there he for doubting the very circumstantial account
given by Prado as to what took place, especially when it is corroborated by the
independent statements of Torres, Arias, Castro, Iturbe and others? (Cf.
Markham, pp. 525, 508, xxix, xxxiii, etc., etc.)</p>
<blockquote>[* <i>Vide</i> Appendix III; also Markham, pp. 470-3.]</blockquote>
<p class="page">{Page 31}</p>
<p>The truth and accuracy of the statements made by Prado being once
established, it is obvious that an entirely different estimate must henceforth
be formed of the character of Quiros, whose name can no longer be held to merit
the exalted position it now occupies in the annals of the world's greatest
pioneer discoverers. On the other hand Don Diego de Prado y Tovar becomes
revealed to the world as a great captain and discoverer, whose name has never
yet received due recognition. He must in future be placed in the ranks of the
great navigators and his name, henceforth freed from obloquy, coupled with that
of Torres as joint discoverer of Australia.</p>
<p>The character of Prado has been assailed by other writers since Markham's
time. For instance the late Mr Robert Logan Jack in his extensive work
<i>Northmost Australia</i>, published in 1921(*), with no more evidence than
was possessed by Markham in 1904, was yet able to heap additional discredit on
Prado. It is the old story of giving a dog an ill name, when each succeeding
writer takes for granted the accuracy of the deductions of his predecessors,
and enlarges upon them without making any attempt at an independent
re-examination of the basic facts.</p>
<blockquote>[* Jack, Robert Logan. <i>Northmost Australia. Three centuries of
exploration, discovery and adventure in and around the Cape York Peninsula
Queensland.</i> 2 vols. Royal 8vo. London, 1921.]</blockquote>
<p>Here is what Jack says of Prado:</p>
<p class="quote">The insubordination on the flagship had to be dealt with. The
ringleader was the Chief Pilot, or Captain, Juan Ochoa de Bilbaho, for whom
Quiros considered that a sufficient punishment was to be relieved of his office
and sent on board the <i>Almarinta</i>...A bitterly spiteful enemy of Quiros,
and necessarily a supporter of the disrated Captain, was Diego de Prado y
Tobar, who according to his own account, voluntarily accompanied Ochoa and
boarded the <i>Almiranta</i> at Toumaco. In allowing an officer of the flagship
to desert openly and to side with a degraded malcontent, it seems to me that
Quiros displayed a weakness which was most reprehensible...The assertion [by
Prado] that he was Captain is sheer impudence, as there can be no question that
the Captain was Ochoa. Prado was perhaps a "mate" of some sort. [Jack, p.
13.]</p>
<p>In another place (p. 15), Jack speaks of "the outrageous conduct of
Prado".</p>
<p class="page">{Page 32}</p>
<p>Here is manufactured history with a vengeance. Let us analyse it. The reader
is invited to collate these wild extravagant stories of Jack and the somewhat
milder censures of Markham, with the letters of Prado and Torres printed in the
Appendix (which constitute all the evidence which either of those writers had
to go upon), and then to form his own opinion as to whether or not their
aspersions are justified. Not a word of discredit is thrown on Prado in the
narratives of Belmonte Bermudez, Leza and Torquemada. As far as the writer is
able to judge there is no foundation whatever for Jack's statement that Prado
was a supporter of the "disrated Captain Ochoa", or that he "according to his
own account voluntarily accompanied Ochoa and boarded the <i>Almiranta</i>".
Prado made no such statement, for Ochoa is not even mentioned in either of his
two letters. Neither is there any ground for the charge that Prado deserted
openly, nor is there any evidence that Ochoa was captain. Prado was certainly
captain, as he himself states, whilst Ochoa was merely chief pilot, and is
frequently mentioned as such in the existing narratives. In confirmation we now
have the definite statement in the certificate appended to Prado's Relacidn
where Juan Ochoa de Vilbao is described as "chief pilot of this expedition ".
(<i>Vide</i> <i>infra</i>, p. 37. Cf. also p. 89.)</p>
<p>Prado's newly recovered <i>Relaci&oacute;n</i> definitely refutes all the
obloquy cast upon his name and further shows that his two letters from Goa were
accurate in their statements. It is therefore now evident that the tenor of
those letters was misinterpreted by historians, who, preferring to believe the
narratives of the associates of Quiros, necessarily discredited Prado, as both
versions could not be true.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 33}</p>
<h4>THE TRUE CHARACTER AND STATUS OF PRADO</h4>
<p>The writer, standing in the position of sponsor, as it were, for the newly
discovered <i>Relaci&oacute;n</i>, has felt it his bounden duty to employ every
possible means of refuting absolutely the calumnies hitherto showered upon
Prado. What credence could possibly be claimed even for such a wonderful
narrative as the <i>Relaci&oacute;n</i> whilst its author was held to be the
disreputable person characterised by modern historians?</p>
<p>Fortunately, from the internal evidence of the new manuscript and from
independent genealogical and heraldic researches, a very different estimate can
now be formed of the true character of this much-maligned man. Captain Don
Diego de Prado y Tovar, to give him his full title, belonged to one of the
noblest families of Madrid, and was a Knight of Calatrava, one of the oldest
and most distinguished of Spanish Orders of Chivalry, founded in 1158. He was
undoubtedly the most important and distinguished person in the whole
expedition, far above Quiros and all the other officers in rank and social
position, and was actually nominated by the Viceroy of Peru in his sealed
orders to succeed to the chief command in case of anything happening to Quiros
(<i>Vide</i> <i>infra</i>, p. 34). He evidently had a love for adventure, for
he mentions that he had previously served the King in the East and West Indies.
With such a record, surely he would have been the very last person to have
stirred up mutiny as Markham suggests. Moreover it is a significant fact that
in neither of the existing narratives is the slightest complaint or censure of
his behaviour expressed. His position at the commencement of the expedition was
captain of the <i>San Pedro y San Pablo</i>, that is to say he was second in
command to Quiros himself, whilst Torres was captain in a similar position in
the second ship, the <i>San Pedrico</i>. Prado's disagreements with Quiros, and
the reasons which caused him to transfer to the <i>San Pedrico</i>, have
already been explained.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 34}</p>
<h4>THE CONTINUATION OF THE VOYAGE AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF QUIROS</h4>
<p>It must now be recorded how Prado came to succeed to the supreme command
over the head of Torres, after the separation of the ships on June 11, 1606, a
fact entirely new to history. Prado tells us that Torres, after searching in
vain for the <i>San Pedro y San Pablo</i>, held a council, when it was decided
to wait in the <i>Bay of St Philip and St lames</i> until June 20, to see if
Quiros returned or whether any traces of the wreck of his ship could be found.
Meanwhile they searched the coast in both directions, but found nothing. The
sequel is best told in Prado's own words.</p>
<p class="quote">On the 25th [June], S. John's Day, Luis Baes [i.e. Torres]
again summoned a council and produced a closed and sealed paper, and said it
was from the Viceroy of Peru; in substance it contained and said that in case
any of the ships should go astray they should make every effort to go up to
20&deg; of S. altitude and see if there was any land in that region, and not
finding itshould go to the city of Manila and wait there for four months for
the other ships, as they also carried the same orders; and in case Pedro
Fernandez de Quiros should fail they were to take Captain Don Diego de Prado
for chief in order that he might direct that voyage...The said Don Diego
accepted the charge as committed to him, and thenceforth executed his office
[etc.]. [<i>Vide</i> <i>infra</i>, pp. 130-3.]</p>
<p>These sealed orders are absolutely in accordance with the King's mandate to
the Viceroy dated May 9, 1603, as given in Quiros' own narrative. (Cf. Markham,
pp. 171-2.) Torres himself makes mention of these orders in a somewhat
indefinite passage in his Letter, the exact meaning of which has not hitherto
been fully realised, because it was not known to what orders he was referring.
Speaking of what occurred in the great bay in the island of <i>Espiritu
Santo</i> after the departure of Quiros, Torres says:</p>
<p class="page">{Page 35}</p>
<p class="quote">I had to return to the Bay to see if perchance they [i.e.
<i>Quiros and his men</i>] had returned to it, all this I did for further
loyalty in this Bay, and I waited fifteen days for them at the end of which I
brought forth Your Majesty's orders and calling a council jointly with the
officers of the Launch, it was agreed that we should fulfil them, though
against the inclination of many, I might say of the majority, but my
condition(*), was different from that of Captain Pero Fernandez de
Quiros(**).</p>
<blockquote>[* <i>Condicion</i> in Spanish has the same variety of meanings as
in English.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** This translation is from the copy of the Spanish text recently
obtained from Madrid (<i>Vide</i> pp. 54-5) and printed herewith in Appendix I.
It varies considerably from the versions given by Markham and others, with
which it should be compared (<i>Vide</i> M. p. 462).]</blockquote>
<p>But Prado, although succeeding to the supreme command, seems to have
remained on the best of terms with Torres, and does not appear to have
interfered with him in his nautical captaincy. That is to say Prado was now the
chief of the expedition, whilst Torres was his captain, exactly in the same
position as Prado occupied when he was captain under Quiros, the former chief.
This is evident from the fact that on Prado's maps, which bear his name as
maker, all the discoveries laid down are attributed to Torres. (<i>Vide</i> the
facsimiles and the legends in the Appendix.) In this new manuscript, when
speaking of nautical matters, Prado usually uses the plural "we discovered",
"we drew out", "we coasted along", etc., etc., but when naming places he
generally speaks in the singular, " I gave the island the name of", etc., etc.,
and when taking possession of any lands in the name of the King of Spain he
uses the formula, "I Don Diego de Prado Captain and Chief take possession",
etc., etc.</p>
<p>Although it has hitherto been supposed that Torres was in command of the
voyage after the separation of the ships, it must be admitted (now that the
circumstances of the failure of Quiros have become known) that Prado's
succession to the chief command follows the customary course. For Prado was
originally the captain of the senior ship and would have been entitled to the
chief command by seniority, even if there had been no sealed orders from the
Viceroy.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 36}</p>
<p>Throughout his narrative it appears that Prado acted as an honourable man,
always carrying out his orders with the sole object of serving faithfully his
lord the King. Even after complaining of the conduct of Quiros he was still
loyal to him, for, as may be seen from the title-heading of his
<i>Relaci&oacute;n</i>, he states that it is a "summary relation of the
discovery begun by...Quiros...and completed <i>for him</i> by Captain Don Diego
de Prado...with the help of Captain Luis Baes de Torres...". He was no egotist,
and beyond stating the actual details of the events in which he was concerned,
he takes to himself no credit whatsoever for the important discoveries
made.</p>
<h4>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL DESCRIPTION OF PRADO'S <i>RELACI&Oacute;N</i> AND HIS
MAPS</h4>
<p>Before giving an abstract of the contents of the <i>Relaci&ograve;n</i> it
may be as well to describe it more fully in order to indicate that it is in the
handwriting of Prado, and to endeavour to show when and for what purpose it was
written.</p>
<p>There is no doubt whatever that Prado's four maps of 1606, now believed to
be preserved at Simancas, were the work of Prado himself, for they all bear an
inscription to that effect, and the handwriting of the place-names on them is
identical with that of the new manuscript, as may be seen by comparison
(<i>Vide</i> facsimiles in the Appendix). Furthermore the signatures agree,
save that the one on the fourth map is written in full, "Don Diego de Prado y
Tovar", whereas in the <i>Relaci&oacute;n</i> it appears in the abbreviated
form "Don Diego de Prado ". But in Spanish documents, the rubric, or
complicated flourish which was nearly always appended to signatures, is
considered even more characteristic than the signature itself. In the present
case the rubric places the question of the identity of the handwriting beyond
the possibility of doubt, for the two agree absolutely, although in the case of
the map it follows the name "Tovar", whilst in the manuscript it is appended to
"Prado".</p>
<p class="page">{Page 37}</p>
<p>The following most important certificate is appended to the
<i>Relaci&oacute;n</i> immediately below Prado's signature:</p>
<p class="quote">Luis Baes de Torres, Captain of the <i>Almiranta</i> called
<i>San Pedrico</i>; Gaspar de Gaya, master; Juan Bernardo Fontidue&ntilde;a,
pilot; Juan Ochoa de Vilbao, who was chief pilot of this expedition and
Francisco Rodrigues de Mazagaon notary thereof, certify that at the instance of
the Captain and Commander Don Diego de Prado we have seen this account which he
made of this discovery from the port of the Callao of Lima to that of Cabite of
Manila, and it is accurate and true, and we hold it for such because we have
compared it with others which we ourselves had, and in order that at any time
he may be able to send or give it to His Majesty or to the Lords of his Royal
Council of the Indies and they may give to it the credit it deserves, we sign
it with our hands and names and it is dated in Manila of the Philippines on the
6th day of the month of June of the year one thousand six hundred and eight.
Luis Baes de Torres. Gaspar de Gaya. Juan Bernardo Fontidue&ntilde;a. Juan
Ochoa de Vilbao Francisco Rodriguez de Mazagaon, Notary of the Ship.
[<i>Vide</i> facsimile, p. 206.]</p>
<p>From the fact that the five signatures to this certificate are in the
handwriting of Prado, it is clear that the whole manuscript is his own
holograph duplicate, but we have no knowledge of what became of the original,
for no such document is now known to exist. Hence this holograph duplicate has
the same importance as the lost original by reason of the absolutely virgin
historical material it contains.</p>
<p>If the original was ever sent home, it has been lost, but it is extremely
doubtful whether it was ever sent. It seems more probable that Prado carried it
with him when he returned home. His two letters from Goa, dated December 24 and
25, 1613, throw a little light on the subject (<i>Vide</i> Appendix II).</p>
<p>The letter of December 24 shows conclusively that Prado sent home a map, for
he says:</p>
<p class="page">{Page 38}</p>
<p class="quote">I send to your Majesty the Map of the discovery which Luis
Vaez de Torres, Captain of the <i>Almiranta</i> of Pedro Fernandez de Quiros
made...The discovery is of the island called by us the "Magna
Margarita"(*).</p>
<blockquote>[* New Guinea.]</blockquote>
<p>In the letter of December 25, Prado writes:</p>
<p class="quote">I send to Your Majesty the discovery of the great Margarita,
Southern Land, made by Luis Vaez de Torres, Admiral of Pedro Fernandez de
Quiros, for it is full time that it reached the hands of Your Majesty.</p>
<p>It seems impossible to determine definitely whether the word "discovery" in
the second letter was intended to mean "the Map of the discovery" as mentioned
in the first letter, or whether the <i>Relaci&oacute;n</i> (as an account of
the discovery) was referred to. Probably Prado was speaking of the map, for in
the same letter he states that when he had reached the Court and had kissed the
hand of the King he would "give a full and particular account". He would hardly
have written to that effect if he was sending on the <i>Relaci&oacute;n</i>
with the map. Would he not more probably have said "a fuller account" or "a
further account"? The inference appears to be that he carried his
<i>Relaci&ograve;n</i> with him, and that it was the "full and particular
account" he proposed to give.</p>
<p>Markham (p. xxvii) definitely states that "in 1613 Diego de Prado v Tovar
sent home <i>four maps</i> from Goa which throw considerable light on the
course of Torres's ship". But it is evident from the letters quoted above that
Prado only sent home one map, which from the wording of his letter of December
24 must have been a route map, probably of the whole voyage including New
Guinea, for he definitely says, "Your Majesty will see by the said Map that
which Pedro Fernandez de Quiros, the impostor, discovered were some reefs and
small islands, for his crew mutinied in the bay of the island of <i>Espiritu
Santo</i>". The four Prado Maps as we know them to-day are confined to four
separate places(*), but the route map such as referred to by Prado in his
letter quoted above and also mentioned at the end of his <i>Relaci&oacute;n</i>
has not as yet been re-discovered in the Spanish archives, although diligent
search has been made for it(**).</p>
<blockquote>[* <i>Vide</i> facsimiles at the end.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** <i>Vide</i> p. 40.]</blockquote>
<p class="page">{Page 39}</p>
<p>From the recently recovered Report of the Council of State of September 25,
1608(*), it appears that Markham(**) was mistaken in supposing that the <i>four
maps</i> made by Prado in 1606 were only sent home by him in his letters of
December 1613, for <i>five maps</i> were enclosed in the letter of Torres of
1607 as mentioned in the said Report. These maps had reached Spain more than
five years before the date of Prado's letters. It is not of course definitely
known that four out of the five maps sent home by Torres in 1607, as mentioned
in the Report, were the actual four maps of Prado as we know them to-day, but
it is very probable that they were. Neither is it known that the fifth one was
the missing route map, but here again the probability is very strong. It is
also impossible to say whether the map sent home by Prado in 1613 was a copy of
one of the five enclosed in the letter of Torres of I 607, or even whether it
was identical with the one referred to at the end of his
<i>Relaci&oacute;n</i>(***). The presumption is that it was a fresh map of the
route, for (if it was a map and not the <i>Relaci&oacute;n</i> that Prado was
referring to in his letter of December 25, 1613) he would hardly have written
"it is full time that it reached the hands of Your Majesty", if it had been a
copy of a map sent home in 1607, which he had no reason to suppose had not
already reached the King. All this is a matter of conjecture, for the Report of
September 1608 merely states:</p>
<blockquote>[* M. p. xxvii.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** <i>Vide</i> p. 26 <i>ante</i> and pp. 55-6 infra and Appendix
I.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[*** <i>vide</i> p. 40.]</blockquote>
<p class="quote">Some days ago there was laid before the Council a letter from
Louis Vaez de Torres...and likewise were exhibited <i>five</i> maps which he
sent of some ports and islands where he landed.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 40}</p>
<p>The aforementioned certificate of Torres and others(*) near the end of
Prado's <i>Relaci&oacute;n</i> is dated June 6, 1608, from which it is clear
that the route map mentioned immediately after the certificate could not have
been of an earlier date, and hence could not have been one of the actual five
sent home by Torres in 1607, unless the <i>Relaci&oacute;n</i> map was merely a
copy. The route map is thus referred to by Prado in the final paragraph of the
<i>Relaci&oacute;n</i>:</p>
<p class="quote">The black line which is marked on the map and begins from the
port of the Callao of Lima and ends in that of Cabite of Manilla, represents
and shows the route the ships made throughout the navigation, and the region
and places they passed until they reached the said port of Cabite of
Manilla.</p>
<blockquote>[* <i>Vide</i> p. 37 <i>ante</i> and facsimile, p. 206
<i>infra</i>.]</blockquote>
<p>It is possible that the fifth map mentioned in the Report of the Council in
1608 may have been another local map and not a route map at all. The Report
merely speaks of five maps of "some ports and islands" but makes no mention
whatever of any route map of the whole voyage. Presumably the route map was
prepared by Prado for his original <i>Relaci&ograve;n</i>, but like the
<i>Relaci&oacute;n</i> itself it has never come to light. It is greatly to be
regretted that no duplicate route map was found with the present duplicate
<i>Relaci&oacute;n</i>. Unfortunately no route map of the voyage, from whatever
source, is now known to exist, but Prado's graphic description, as quoted
above, would enable it to be instantly recognised if it should ever be found.
Here then is a chance for some indefatigable searcher of records. If that route
map still exists, he who recovers it after three hundred years will restore to
the world a document of supreme importance, second only to the chart of Juan de
la Cosa, the pilot of Columbus.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 41}</p>
<p>Reverting once more to the <i>Relaci&oacute;n</i> itself, it appears at
first sight that this duplicate was made at Manila in 1608, at the date of the
signing of the certificate. But a careful perusal indicates that it could not
have been made until after Prado had returned to Madrid. Certain references to
subsequent events make this evident. For instance, in the title Prado describes
himself as "now a monk of our father Saint Basil the Great of Madrid ". As this
was a new Order founded only in 1610 he could not have belonged to it until
after his return home. Exactly when he did return home is uncertain, but from
his letters, written from Goa in December 1613, we learn that he had been
delayed by the Governor of Manila who would not give him proper despatch, but
that he was now leaving Goa "for Ormuz on the 8th of February of next year
[i.e. 1614]...and thence by land with the caravan of the Venetian merchants,
journeying little by little to Aleppo, and thence to Venice and other places
until I reach this Court, kiss the hand of your Majesty and give a full and
particular account"(*). From this passage it seems likely that he was carrying
with him the original <i>Relaci&oacute;n</i> with the certificate attached.
From the length of the journey and the delays of transport he could hardly have
reached Madrid until late in 1614 or early in 1615.</p>
<blockquote>[* <i>Vide</i> Appendix II.]</blockquote>
<p>It seems probable that Quiros had to a certain extent made good at Court in
the meantime, for he had been despatched to Peru(*) with promises of further
employment before Prado could have reached Madrid with his
<i>Relaci&ograve;n</i>. They could hardly have met, for Quiros is reported to
have died at Panama in 1614(**), and it would have taken him some time to have
journeyed there from Madrid. Markham on pp. xxxiv-v discusses the action taken
at the Court of Spain with regard to Quiros, but some fresh valuable
information on this point will be found in the aforesaid Report of the Council
of State of September 1608, as fully detailed <i>infra</i> at pp. 55-6.</p>
<blockquote>[* <i>Vide</i> p. 56.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** Markham, p. 517. Cf. p. 57 <i>infra</i>.]</blockquote>
<p class="page">{Page 42}</p>
<p>We have no knowledge of what happened after Prado arrived in Madrid. As his
original <i>Relaci&oacute;n</i> is not known to exist we cannot say in what
state it reached the King, if at all. If it agreed with the present manuscript,
Prado must have made a fresh fair copy, for, as has already been said, this
duplicate contains some references to events later than the date of the
certificate. For instance, on the second page Prado describes his banner
bearing the Cross of Calatrava, which was hoisted with the banners of the other
captains when the expedition sailed from Callao in December 1605, and goes on
to say:</p>
<p class="quote">After the voyage, when the aforesaid reached the island of
Malta and the new city of Valetta, he had some roman characters written round
it saying, speaking with the Cross, With thee I have gone round the whole world
and have discovered new southern kingdoms, Lippis, Canais Suleis and
Hobania&ntilde;os for the great Philip, King of the Spains, and it is now in
the Chapel of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la Buena Ventura in the Church of S.
Basil the Great [etc.]. [<i>Vide</i> <i>infra</i>, pp. 90--1 .]</p>
<p><a name="p42" id="p42"></a>On the first page of the manuscript, in the
title-heading, the date 1607 has been altered to 1608 by a later hand, as may
be seen by the difference in the colour of the ink. The date 1607 is of course
correct, and the alteration was probably made to accord with the date of the
certificate at the end. There is a curious error made by Prado himself on p. 29
of the manuscript where he says (speaking of his arrival at Manila on May 22):
"with this our expedition ended, which lasted seventeen months from the 21st of
December 1606 to the twenty-second of May 1608". This is clearly a clerical
error, for it is well known that the expedition sailed from Callao on December
21, 1605, and reached Manila May 22, 1607 (cf. Markham, pp. xxii, 180, 181,
323, 466). Torres' letter to the King, dated from Manila July 12, 1607, states
that it was two months since his arrival. (<i>Vide</i> Appendix I.)</p>
<p class="page">{Page 43}</p>
<p>A similar clerical error, 1606 for 1605, occurs in the side-note on the
first page of the manuscript. But these errors are important as showing
conclusively that the manuscript in its present form could not have been
written in 1608, the date of the certificate. Had it been written at that time,
such errors would have been impossible, but a confusion of dates is quite
probable after an interval of seven years. Internal evidence proves without
doubt that these errors are purely clerical. The certificate is correctly dated
June 6, 1608, and near the end of the manuscript(*) there is an account of some
of Quiros' old crew having arrived at Manila from Mexico "at the beginning of
June", clearly meaning June of the same year as the arrival of Prado, which in
the preceding sentences he states was on May 22. This from other sources has
been shown to be 1607. No one would speak of the "beginning of June" in a
document certified on June 6, if it were in the same year. The certificate must
clearly have been dated a year after the return of the expedition to Manila,
and indicates that Prado and Torres and those who signed it were still there in
June 1608.</p>
<blockquote>[* <i>Vide</i> p. 193.]</blockquote>
<p>After careful consideration of all these facts the only logical conclusion
seems to be, that this manuscript is a fair copy in Prado's own handwriting
made (c. 1615) after his return to Madrid, embodying a copy of the original
certificate of 1608 as to the truth of the actual events of the great voyage,
but interpolating a few personal details of occurrences after he left
Manila.</p>
<h4>ANNOTATED ABSTRACT OF PRADO'S <i>RELACI&Oacute;N</i></h4>
<p>The enormous importance to geographic history of the new manuscript, by
reason of the mass of entirely new and unsuspected information it contains, may
readily be perceived from the following epitome and notes(*). From the
commencement of the voyage on December 21, 1605, to June 11, 1606, when the
ships parted company, Prado's account of the main events connected with the
discoveries made down to that time is much the same as that given in the three
existing Narratives as printed by Markham, but there are naturally considerable
variations in the details. Whilst Prado omits many things mentioned by the
others, he gives much new or additional information. This section of the
<i>Relaci&oacute;n</i> is particularly interesting and important by reason of
the entirely unsuspected light it sheds on the personal character of Quiros and
his wilful conduct, which caused Prado to transfer himself to Torres' ship and
led up to the subsequent mutiny and the parting of the ships.</p>

<h4>PRADO'S ACCOUNT OF THE VOYAGE AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF QUIROS</h4>
<p>From this point onwards the <i>Relaci&oacute;n</i> deals entirely with the
continuation of the voyage from the island of <i>Espiritu Santo</i> until the
expedition reached Manila, that is to say from June 11, 1606, to May 22, 1607.
Except from the short letters of Torres and Prado and Prado's maps preserved at
Simancas, practically nothing has hitherto been known of this most momentous
voyage. The recovery of this manuscript, giving the first detailed account of
one of the most remarkable voyages ever made in the Age of Discovery, may
therefore well be described as of inestimable value, and may be regarded as the
very corner-stone of Australian pioneer history.</p>
<p>Before continuing the Abstract it may be as well here to comment on and
brush aside some of the erroneous deductions which modern historians appear to
have drawn from the aforesaid letters of Torres and Prado and the Prado
Maps.</p>

<h4>MR R. LOGAN JACK'S OPINIONS ON THE LETTER OF TORRES, ETC.</h4>
<p>One of the latest writers, Mr R. Logan Jack, in his extensive work
<i>Northmost Australia</i>(*), devotes no less than thirteen pages to an
account of the voyage of Torres. His aspersions on the character of Prado have
already been shown to be not only entirely unwarranted but purely
imaginary(**), and some of his comments on the inaccuracies (as he supposes) in
Torres' own account of his voyage seem to be equally unreliable. Let us examine
them. Wytfliet's definite mention of a narrow strait between New Guinea and
Terra Australis has already been discussed(***), and the suggestion made that
it was at the best merely suppo- sitional. It is of course quite possible that
Torres was acquainted with the rumour that there was such a passage, but, as
will be seen, he was certainly not making for it on his voyage to Manila.
Nevertheless, on p. 21 of his book, Jack states that everything points to the
fact that Torres was making "for a passage regarding which he was already in
possession of some information ". On p. 18 he says that Torres "fell in with
the beginning of New Guinea", and after coasting to the west for five days
landed on what he named <i>Tiera de Buenaventura</i> on July 18, 1606. But this
is no evidence that Torres knew of the strait and was making for it. The
contrary is easily proved, for it is clear that Torres was planning to go to
the north of New Guinea. His standing orders from Quiros (as printed by
Markham, pp. 183-91) were that in the event of the separation of the ships they
were to rendezvous at the Island of Santa Cruz and wait for each other for
three months. If at the end of this time the other ships had not arrived,
Torres was to "steer S.W. as far as 20&deg;, thence N.W. to 4&deg; and on that
parallel he is to steer west in search of New Guinea; after coasting all along
that land he is to proceed to the City of Manila...in 14&deg; N.".</p>
<p class="page">{Page 47}</p>
<p>It is evident from these instructions that Torres could not strike the
<i>south</i> side of New Guinea on the parallel of 4&deg; S., for there is no
water in that latitude on the south side until towards the western end of the
island. Torres himself tells us in his letter that after sailing to the
south-west as instructed, and having no signs of land that way, "I stood back
to the N.W. to 11&frac12;&deg; S. Latitude: there we fell in with the beginning
of New Guinea...I could not weather the E. point so I coasted along to the
westward on the S. side".(****) Two things are evident from the two quotations
given above, <i>firstly</i> that Torres was endeavouring to follow his
instructions to pass along the north side of New Guinea, and <i>secondly</i>
that as he could not weather the east point he was <i>compelled</i> to coast
along to the west on the south side. It is thus clearly shown that Jack's
inference that Torres was making "for a passage regarding which he was already
in possession of some information" cannot be substantiated. Jack actually
quotes on p. 18 part of the paragraph in Torres' letter where he says he "fell
in with the beginning of New Guinea"(****), but if he had completed it "I could
not weather the E. point so I coasted along to the westward on the S.
side"(****) it would have been obvious to him that Torres intended to continue
to sail to the north-west up to 4&deg;, but was by force of circumstances
compelled at 11&frac12;&deg; to turn to the west along the south side. Prado's
<i>Relaci&oacute;n</i> confirms this but gives the latitude as 12&deg;. He
tells us that after</p>
<p class="quote">directing our route to south west until we reached
20&frac12;&deg; of altitude...and having carried out the order, we turned to
the north...and although the wind was south east and not much in our favour the
Lord God was pleased that at daybreak on the fourteenth of July we should find
land [<i>the side-note says</i> "the first land in 12&deg; altitude"], very
high, and the coast running very far both ways...We drew out and crowded sail
to go eastwards, [i.e. <i>towards the north side of New Guinea</i>], with
sunrise the wind blew a stiff breeze so that it was necessary to submit and to
go along the coast [i.e. <i>to the west along the south side</i>]. [<i>Vide</i>
pp. 132-5.]</p>
<blockquote>[* Cf. footnote, p. 8. ]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** <i>Vide</i> pp. 31-2 <i>ante</i>.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[*** <i>Vide</i> pp. 18-20 <i>ante</i>]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[**** Burney-Markham version.]</blockquote>
<p class="page">{Page 48}</p>
<p>On pp. 19 and 21 Jack(*) states that Torres gives impossible latitudes in
and about the Gulf of Papua. The present writer (working at first from the
translation given by Markham)(**) was himself greatly puzzled by the passage,
"We went over it [i.e. <i>a bank</i>] along the coast to 7&frac12;&deg;
latitude and the end of it is in 5&deg;". But the mystery as to 5&deg; appeared
to be solved when an analysis of the context seemed to indicate that 5&deg; was
doubtless a misinterpretation by the translator for 5 fathoms. The 9&deg;
quoted by Torres is apparently approximately correct, but 7&frac12;&deg; is
doubtless a trifle too far north, as it would have been right on the coast, or
actually inland, as compared with the more precise surveys of modern times. But
when we consider the difficulties of accurately determining the latitude during
such a tortuous voyage as this, a slight variation is not surprising. A
difference of only half a degree [i.e. 8&deg; instead of 7&frac12;&deg;] would
make Torres' narrative of the voyage in the Gulf of Papua quite feasible.
Prado's two maps of this part of the coast confirm the general accuracy of
Torres' statements. The question of 5&deg; or 5 fathoms is more fully argued
when Captain Bayldon's deductions arc discussed (<i>infra</i>, pp. 51-2).</p>
<blockquote>[* Northmost Australia.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** Markham, p. 463.]</blockquote>
<p>As to the 11&deg; mentioned by Torres as his southern limit, Jack (p. 21)
thinks this also is impossible "for the reason that it would have brought him
well into Queensland". Although it is quite possible for Torres to have reached
11&deg; if he had borne away sufficiently far to the west-south-west after
passing through Endeavour Strait, there was no necessity for him to have done
so, for he could have turned to the north-west in a lower latitude. It is far
more probable that here again there was a slight error in calculating the
latitude. A difference of only one-sixth of a degree [i.e. 10&deg; 50' instead
of 11&deg;] would have enabled him to pass between Prince of Wales Island and
Peak Point, the western extremity of the Cape York Peninsula, and then bear
away to the north-west without touching the mainland. The most southerly point
of Prince of Wales Island lies in 10&deg; 46', whilst the latitude of Peak
Point is 10&deg; 42'. Torres says "there were very large islands and there
appeared more to the southward". The "very large islands" may very well have
been Horn and Prince of Wales and others in the vicinity, whilst possibly the
west coast of the Cape York peninsula may have been mistaken for more islands
to the southward. (Cf. p. 73 <i>infra</i> where Prado mentions "other islands
towards the North and one bigger than the rest".)</p>
<p class="page">{Page 49}</p>
<p>Jack (p. 21) mentions nine practical passages through the islands and reefs
in Torres Strait, and raises the question as to which was used by Torres. He
suggests that "the Bligh Channel (10&deg; 20' S.)" most nearly accords with
Torres' description of his position when he was able to turn to the north-west.
But Jack's mention of the latitude of the Bligh Channel as 10&deg; 20' is
obviously an error (probably for 10&deg; 2'), for even on his own map A he
shows it in its correct position close to 10&deg;. If Torres actually used the
Bligh Channel he would have been practically a whole degree out in his stated
latitude, which would seem almost incredible having regard to his general
standard of accuracy. Moreover Prado in his <i>Relaci&ograve;n</i> mentions
that they landed on an island in 10&deg; and afterwards proceeded for many days
touching at numerous islands which he describes at some length, before "God was
pleased that we should henceforth find more water so that...the wind being a
strong breeze we went out towards the north". This description certainly does
not accord with Jack's theory that they went through the Bligh Channel, for had
they done so their course would have been practically due west until they were
actually through that passage. This point is amplified on p. 67. As there is no
reason to doubt Torres' <i>bona fides</i>, why not assume that his stated
11&deg; is <i>approximately</i> correct, in which case the only channel he
could have passed through would be that now known as Endeavour Strait?</p>
<p class="page">{Page 50}</p>
<h4>CAPTAIN BAYLDON'S CONCLUSIONS ON THE LETTER OF TORRES</h4>
<p>In the <i>Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Australian Historical
Society</i>, vol. xi, Part 3, pp. 158-94 (Sydney 1925), Commander Francis J.
Bayldon, F.R.G.S., R.N.R., gives a long technical analysis of the voyage of
Torres. This is evidently based on the translation of the letter of Torres of
1607 as printed by Markham, and develops a reasoned argument tending to
demonstrate that the stated latitude of 11&deg; S. could not be even
approximately correct, and consequently that Torres could not possibly have
sighted the mainland of Australia as some writers have held. Bayldon definitely
states his opinion that Torres coasted along the south side of New Guinea,
keeping as close in shore as the shoals would permit, passing False Cape and
continuing to the west and north until he struck the coast at 5&deg; S. in the
neighbourhood of Cape Steenboom. The arguments of Comdr. Bayldon (after his
fourteen years' personal experience in navigating through the waters of Torres
Strait and off the south coast of New Guinea, etc.) are of course entitled to
every possible respect and consideration, but when such arguments are mainly
based on the <i>supposed</i> statements of Torres, the whole superstructure
crumbles if it can be shown that the base is not well and truly grounded. That
is exactly what appears to have happened in this case. Bayldon (working
apparently from Markham's translation) quotes Torres as saying "we fell in with
a bank of from 3 to 9 fathoms...we went over it along the coast to 7&frac12;
degrees south latitude, and the end of it is in 5 degrees". The present writer
has already shown, when discussing Mr Logan Jack's deductions(*), how he
himself was greatly puzzled by this passage until he realised that the 5
degrees was a misinterpretation by the translator for 5 fathoms.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 51}</p>
<p>This became still more evident from Lord Stanley's translation of the same
passage, which varies considerably from the Burney-Markham version quoted
above. Stanley makes Torres say "at this point there begins a bank of from
three fathoms to nine, which stretches along the coast until seven degrees and
a half, and the extremity of it is in five (degrees?)". The fact that Stanley
places the word <i>degrees</i> within parentheses with a query mark, shows that
it did not appear in the original, and that he himself was in doubt as to the
interpretation to be put upon the final words of the sentence. We now know for
certain from our photostat of the Madrid copy, from which Lord Stanley made his
translation, that the Spanish text actually reads "el remate del es en sinco"
(<i>the end of it is in five</i>.) (<i>Vide</i> the Spanish as printed in the
Appendix, p. 230.)</p>
<blockquote>[* <i>Ante</i> p. 48.]</blockquote>
<p>Mr Barwick's re-translation of this passage reads "from here begins a bank
(<i>placel</i>) of three fathoms to nine which runs along the coast a hundred
and eighty odd leagues; we went over it along the coast to seven degrees and a
half, and the end of it is in five" (<i>Vide</i> p. 231). It will be observed
that this rendering varies somewhat from Stanley's, he having apparently
omitted the reference to the distance traversed.</p>
<p>Collingridge also, in <i>History of Australia</i> 1895, evidently suspected
an error here, for he puts + against 5&deg;, referring to a footnote where he
says: +"There is a mistake or miscalculation here, for the farthest northing
they could make, in the gulf they were in (Gulf of Papua), would be in about
8&deg; N." [<i>sic</i>, error for S.]. Collingridge apparently supposed that
the error lay in the number of the degree 5&deg; for 8&deg;, not that 5&deg;
was a misinterpretation for 5 fathoms.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 52}</p>
<p>If we analyse the sentence in question and collate it with the context, it
is clear that <i>five degrees</i> could not possibly be meant, for that
latitude lies some two hundred miles north in the interior of New Guinea. It is
stated that the bank "stretches along the coast until seven degrees and a
half". If Torres had intended to say that the end of the bank was in five
degrees, would he not have said at once "the bank stretches along the coast
until five degrees"? It must be remembered that there is no 5&deg; S. anywhere
in the Gulf of Papua, where the described bank lies. That Torres was still
referring to the Gulf of Papua is clear from the next sentence, whether we
adopt the Markham, the Stanley or the Barwick version. The first states "we
could not go farther on for the many shoals and great currents, so we were
obliged to sail out S.W. <i>in that depth</i> to 11&deg; S. latitude". Stanley
renders it "we could not go forward on account of the numerous shoals and
strong currents which there are throughout, so we had to go out by the south
west course <i>by the said deep channel</i> until eleven degrees, etc." The
latest version, by Mr Barwick, reads, "we could not go forward owing to the
many shoals and great currents which there are throughout it, so we had to go
out turning south west <i>in the said depth</i>, to eleven degrees, etc."
Whichever version we adopt, "<i>in that depth</i>", "<i>by the said deep
channel</i>" or "<i>in the said depth</i>", the analysis works out to the same
result, viz. that Torres meant that from the end of the bank in the Gulf of
Papua, where he found he could go no further, he sailed out south-west to
11&deg; S. in some depth already mentioned. The Spanish words--"<i>por el dicho
fondo</i>--in the said depth"--are so definite that it is no longer open to
doubt that the word <i>five</i> at the end of the sentence previously quoted
must mean fathoms and not degrees, otherwise to what does "<i>the said
depth</i>" refer? That the reference is to five fathoms and not to the
previously mentioned depth "from three fathoms to nine", is independently
confirmed by Prado when he says in his <i>Relaci&oacute;n</i> that the shoals
run out to sea southwards for 50 leagues in 4 or 5 fathoms of water
(<i>Vide</i> p. 67). Obviously Torres could not have sailed southwest from
5&deg; S. to 11&deg; S. before passing through the strait, for there is no
point in the Gulf of Papua lying in 5&deg; S. or within two or three degrees of
that latitude. The only spot in New Guinea lying in the latitude of 5&deg; S.
is on the south coast in the neighbourhood of Cape Steenboom, more than seven
degrees of longitude further west than the north-west corner of the Gulf of
Papua.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 53}</p>
<p>A south-west course from Cape Steenboom at 5&deg; to 11&deg; S. would have
carried Torres hundreds of miles to the west of the strait, that is to say to
approximately 134&deg; Long. E. How could he have sailed there if he had not
passed through the strait, and what would have been his object in turning
south-west again to 11&deg; S. in open water after he had actually worked up
north-west to 5&deg; S. on his way to Manila, which lies in 14&deg; N.? It is
obvious from the context that he had not already passed through the strait when
he turned to the southwest, for he proceeds to describe some of the islands he
saw or visited. There are no such islands on a south-west course from Cape
Steenboom. Hence, as regards the mention of the supposed five degrees, whether
we interpret it as referring to the end of the bank in the Gulf of Papua, or
indicating the neighbourhood of Cape Steen-boom, we arrive in either case at a
<i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, the moment we subject it to a critical analysis in
conjunction with the context. Bayldon's deductions respecting the mention of 5
degrees appear to be that Torres was referring to a continuous coasting voyage
close in along the south coast of New Guinea from the Gulf of Papua as far west
as 5&deg; S. Lat. near Cape Steenboom. He contends that Torres meant "they
sailed over the mudbank to the head of the Gulf [of Papua] which is in about 8
degrees, south of the many outlets of the Aird River, and...that the other, the
far end of it on the western coast off Cape Steenboom, is in 5 degrees south
latitude". But even this contention cannot possibly be correct, for Torres and
Prado both tell us that when they reached the place or Cape where the coast
turned to the north-east (i.e. False Cape in about 8&deg; S.) they sailed to
the north in twenty-five fathoms, so there is no evidence whatever that the
bank continued further west and north than this point, that is to say from
8&deg; to 5&deg;. On the other hand they both record that they did not follow
the coast to the north-east but cut across to the north in deep water until
they struck the coast at 4&deg;. So here again it is evident that they could
have gained no knowledge that the bank continued round the Cape and fringed the
coast to the north-east, for they did not follow it.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 54}</p>
<p>Heawood on p. 74 of his <i>History of Geographical Discovery</i> (1912) in
discussing the voyage of Torres, states in a footnote that " Torres's latitudes
have caused commentators some difficulty". In attempting to explain the
apparent paradox in the mention of "(degrees?)" he arrives at much the same
conclusions as subsequently reached by Bayldon 1925, both writers having failed
to realise that "5 (degrees?)" might equally well have been interpreted as 5
fathoms. It is to be hoped that our deductions set forth above, after a careful
analysis of this most interesting problem, will be accepted as conclusive.</p>
<p>Bayldon further considers that the letter of Torres was written in general
terms, not necessarily in chronological order, and that consequently the
meaning of certain statements could only be interpreted by reading them in
conjunction with other passages in previous or later portions of the narrative.
He points out that the different translations of Torres' letter vary
considerably, and are consequently unreliable, so that it is difficult to
deduce the true meaning, and therefore "one's own reason and knowledge must be
drawn on in the endeavour to obtain a correct interpretation ". He expresses a
wish (which every historian will echo) that a photographic copy of the letter
of Torres in Spanish could be obtained, in order that it might be
re-translated, in the hope that the exact meaning might be more definitely
determined. Fortunately this wish can now at length be gratified, for it is
with the greatest pleasure that the present writer is able to announce that a
photostat of Torres' letter in Spanish has just (July 1929) been obtained from
Madrid, taken from the copy preserved in the Biblioteca Nacional. This is the
copy used in 1868 by Lord Stanley for the translation appended to his work on
De Morga's <i>Philippine Islands</i>, which he edited for the Hakluyt Society
in that year (First Series, vol. xxxix). From this photostat it is now possible
to print herewith for the first time the original Spanish text of Torres'
letter(*). Mr Barwick has made an entirely new and independent translation(**),
which will be found to vary considerably from the several existing versions,
and which it is hoped will finally clear up a number of points hitherto open to
doubt and misconception.</p>
<blockquote>[* <i>Vide</i> Appendix I.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** <i>Vide</i> Appendix I.]</blockquote>
<p class="page">{Page 55}</p>
<p>When the Torres photostat was received from Madrid it was found, quite
unexpectedly, to be preceded by a copy of a covering letter or Report from the
Council of State to the King of Spain dated September 25, 1608, in which
valuable fresh information is contained, for the document does not seem to have
been hitherto recorded. It states that "quite recently" there was laid before
the Council a letter from Luis Vaez de Torres giving an account of what had
happened to him and what had been discovered in his voyage, and how "likewise
were exhibited <i>five</i> maps which he sent of some ports and islands where
he landed". The question of the identity of these five maps has already been
discussed(*).</p>
<blockquote>[* Pp. 39-40 <i>ante</i>.]</blockquote>
<p>Quiros was evidently at this time (1608) dancing attendance at Court
petitioning for further employment in order to continue his discoveries. In
this Report no reference is made to the sudden abandonment of his expedition of
1605-6, nor is any hint given of the mutiny, from which it may be inferred that
a true account of the voyage of Quiros had not yet reached the Council.
Nevertheless the Council placed before the King, in this Report, the following
cogent reasons for keeping secret the recent discoveries and for not
re-employing Quiros to make further explorations:</p>
<p class="quote">And now also has been considered in the Council...the proposal
made by...Quiros, what he has gone through in the said discovery and what he
seeks in order to continue it. And the Council...is of opinion...that what is
discovered in the Indies withdraws men from Spain, which is so short of men, as
is evident, it may be feared that fresh discoveries will lead to greater injury
and open a way for Your Majesty's enemies to go to occupy them, since besides
the lack of men...Your Majesty's treasury is so exhausted that there will be
much strain in retaining what has been discovered...This...Quiros has got it
into his head to be a second Columbus, and seeing that from what is aforesaid
his design cannot be encouraged, it is not desirable to drive him to despair on
account of...the risk there would be that he might have recourse to Your
Majesty's enemies to occupy it...taking for granted that it will be best not to
discuss this fresh discovery, it [i.e. <i>the Council</i>] is of opinion that
this man being so experienced should be retained here as cosmographer in order
that he may be of service in marine charts and globes...and in this way
everything will be settled, namely, not to make known or publish what this man
has discovered, nor to drive him to despair, and to avoid the difficulty about
his giving information to the enemies of this Crown, and to retain him and get
from him all the profit that may be possible in whatever may arise here in
respect of his profession.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 56}</p>
<p>The full text of the Report is printed in Appendix I. It confirms absolutely
the conclusions reached by Markham from other sources, for it appears that
during the next four or five years after the Report of 1608, Quiros was so
persistent with his memorials and petitions for further employment, that it was
finally decided that his presence in Spain was no longer desirable. Markham on
pp. xxxiv-v relates at some length how he was finally despatched to Peru in
company with the newly appointed Viceroy, Don Francisco de Borja, under the
implied promise that he would be employed on a fresh expedition as soon as
circumstances would permit, but Markham also records how the Viceroy received
secret orders to appear to entertain the proposals of Quiros but not to
despatch his business. Quiros seems to have remained to the last under the
mistaken idea, as Markham says, "that after years of wearisome solicitation his
grand ideas were to be realised. Fortunately for the brave enthusiast, he was
saved from the anguish of being undeceived by a timely death at Panama on his
way out". The date of his death is usually given as 1614(*), but it is recorded
that the Viceroy went out to Peru in 1615, arriving at Lima in December(**),
hence it would seem more probable that if Quiros accompanied him his death did
not occur until 1615.</p>

<h4>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTES ON THE SPANISH LETTER OF TORRES AND ITS
TRANSLATIONS</h4>
<p>Before continuing the analysis of Bayldon's deductions it may be as well
here to make another digression and give a few bibliographical details as to
what has hitherto been known about the original Torres letter and its
translations.</p>
<p>The letter of Torres was written to the King of Spain from Manila in July
1607, but seems to have remained entirely unknown to historians until 1762.
Major in his work <i>Early Voyages to Terra Australis</i>, edited for the
Hakluyt Society in 1859, gives (on page lxxv of his Introduction) the following
interesting account of its discovery:</p>
<p class="quote">A copy of this letter of Torres was fortunately lodged in the
Archives of Manila: and it was not till that city was taken, in 1762, by the
English, that the document was discovered by Dalrymple, who paid a fitting
tribute to the memory of this distinguished Spanish navigator, by giving to
this dangerous passage the name of Torres' Straits, which it has ever since
retained. The Editor [i.e. Major] has striven in vain to learn into whose hands
Dalrymple's copy of this letter has fallen. He has been compelled, therefore,
to reprint it from Dalrymple's translation, supplied to Admiral Burney as
inserted at the end of vol. II of his Discoveries and <i>Voyages in the South
Seas</i>.</p>
<p>Although it would thus seem that Dalrymple first discovered and translated
the letter of Torres, he does not appear to have made any historical use of it
himself. The letter, as so translated, was first printed by Burney as Appendix
No. I (pp. 467-78) to Part II of his <i>Chronological History of the Voyages
and Discoveries in the South Seas</i> published in 1806. The heading states
that it is "A Translation nearly literal, by Alexander Dalrymple, Esq. from a
Spanish Manuscript copy in his possession." On p. 272 of the same volume Burney
says,</p>
<p class="page">{Page 58}</p>
<p class="quote">Mr Dalrymple has in his possession a copy of the narrative
written by De Torres, of which he has made an English Translation. Among the
many instances of kindness, and assistance afforded me in the progress of this
work by Mr Dalrymple, I have to acknowledge the being favoured with the use of
this valuable manuscript.</p>
<p>The Dalrymple-Burney translation was again utilised by Major in 1859 in his
book already cited, and later by Collingridge in 1895 in his <i>History of
Australia</i>, and subsequently by Markham in <i>The Voyages of Quiros</i>
edited by him for the Hakluyt Society in 1904. Slight variations from the
Burney version appear in all these successive reprints, but they seem to be due
merely to the substitution here and there of alternative words, which were
doubtless considered more appropriate by the respective editors.</p>
<p>No fresh evidence (as far as the present writer is aware) has come to light
since Major's time (1859) as to what became of Dalrymple's copy of the Spanish
letter. Neither is the record clear as to what became of the contemporary copy
of the original of 1607 which was found at Manila in 1762, from which
Dalrymple's copy was derived. It is not believed that Dalrymple became
possessed of the actual document found at Manila, though there does not appear
to be any evidence either way.</p>
<p>It is generally supposed that Torres' original letter reposes peacefully in
the archives at Simancas, but enquiries made on more than one occasion have so
far failed to locate it. The copy preserved in the Biblioteca Nacional at
Madrid, from which our recent photostat has been made, is described by Lord
Stanley, in his work on De Morga's voyage already cited, as "mentioned by
Navarrete as existing at Simancas".</p>
<p class="page">{Page 59}</p>
<p>Navarrete in his <i>Biblioteca Maritima Espa&ntilde;ola</i> (11, 387, Madrid
1851) says that the letter of Torres of July 12, 1607 "formerly existed
(<i>existia</i>) in the <i>Archivo general</i> of Simancas...bundle labelled
Espa&ntilde;a--Castilla, a&ntilde;o 1608 1&deg; num 209". The fact that
Navarrete uses the imperfect tense <i>existia</i> seems to imply that the
letter of Torres was no longer to be found at Simancas in 1851. Enquiries made
on more than one occasion in recent times have failed to elicit any further
information as to its present location.</p>
<p>The independent translation made by Lord Stanley from the Madrid copy in
1868 varies considerably from the Dalrymple-Burney-Major-Collingridge-Markham
version, and also from Mr Barwick's fresh translation hereunto appended. Mr
Barwick is, however, of the opinion that the differences are due merely to the
fancy of the former translators, for in earlier days--say from fifty to one
hundred and fifty years ago--translations were made in a much freer and less
literal style than is required nowadays to comply with the modern standard of
accuracy. Should the Simancas original letter in Spanish ever become available,
it seems probable that it will agree with the transcript preserved at Madrid,
and that the supposed differences will be found not to lie in the Spanish
texts, but to be due merely to the license taken by the translators.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 60}</p>
<h4>BAYLDON'S CONCLUSIONS ON THE LETTER OF TORRES</h4>
<p align="center">[Continued from page 57]</p>
<p>After this somewhat lengthy bibliographical digression let us now resume the
analysis of the contents of the Torres letter, and contrast our interpretation
of it with the further deductions of Bayldon. It may be as well to mention here
that the present editor has had over forty years' practical experience in
examining, collating, abstracting and describing old historical manuscripts.
Except in a few instances where the <i>bona fides</i> of a writer has been
suspected or impugned, he has generally found that original statements of fact
are almost invariably correct, or approximately so to the best of their
author's knowledge and belief, and hence cannot lightly be set aside. Any
discrepancies in a narrative in the original language are usually traceable to
clerical errors when the context is weighed and analysed. In translations these
clerical errors of the original, if not detected and corrected, are
consequently repeated, and when, as has hitherto been the case with the Torres
letter, the original text has not been available for verification, they are
extremely puzzling. In other cases mistranslations or misinterpretations often
lead to renderings entirely different from the intended meaning of the author.
Therefore any suspected words or figures, whether in the original or in a
translation, cannot be held to be absolutely correct, when the more lengthy
context lucidly indicates an entirely different interpretation. In cases where
a suspected error cannot definitely be verified, it is of course not
permissible or safe to base a positive contra-argument thereon. Where, however,
the context definitely indicates the <i>inferred</i> error, any argument based
on the <i>supposed</i> correctness of the passage as it stands, is necessarily
weakened, or upset altogether, if it can be shown that the passage in question
cannot possibly be read to make sense with the context. Just such a case seems
to occur in Bayldon's further arguments on the passage where Torres is supposed
to have mentioned 5&deg; S. lat. for the second time:</p>
<p class="page">{Page 61}</p>
<p class="quote">We went along this bank for two months at the end of which
time we found ourselves in 25 fathoms and in 5&deg; S. latitude and 10 leagues
from the coast. And having gone 480 leagues here the coast goes to the N.E. I
did not reach it for the bank became very shallow. So <i>we stood to the N.</i>
and in 25 fathoms to 4&deg; latitude, where we fell in with a coast which
likewise lay in a direction E. and W. [Burney-Markham version.]</p>
<p>Lord Stanley's rendering varies slightly and reads as follows:</p>
<p class="quote">...We went along this shoal for two months. At the end of that
time we found ourselves in twenty-five fathoms water and in five degrees
latitude, and ten leagues from the coast, and we had gone four hundred and
eighty leagues. Here the coast trends to the north-east. I did not reach it,
because the bank is very shoal, so <i>I went on running to the north</i> in
twenty-five fathoms water as far as four degrees, when we fell in with a coast
which also stretched from east to west.</p>
<p>Mr Barwick's re-translation of this passage practically agrees with
Stanley's. The only difference worthy of note in these three renderings is in
the words printed in italic, viz., Markham "<i>we stood to the N.</i>" and
Stanley and Barwick "<i>I went on running to the north</i>". Comment on this
discrepancy is deferred for the moment, until the general meaning of the whole
passage has been elucidated, for by analysing it, whichever rendering we adopt,
we glean three definite facts:</p>
<p>1. That it is stated that at 5&deg; the coast went to the north-east.</p>
<p>2. That from this point (5&deg;) they "stood to the north" or "went on
running to the north" to 4&deg; S. Lat.</p>
<p>3. That at 4&deg; they fell in with a coast running east and west.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 62}</p>
<p>If we consult any map of New Guinea it immediately becomes evident that
there must be another error somewhere in the passage quoted above. There is
only one place on the south side of New Guinea where the coast does actually
turn to the north-east, and that is at False Cape, which lies approxmately in
8&deg; S. Lat. Hence it is suggested that the 5&deg; mentioned by Torres,
either in the original Spanish or in the translation, is a clerical error for
8&deg;. For the sake of argument let us assume for the moment that 5&deg; is
correct as it stands, and see how it works out. How could they possibly have
stood to the north or have gone on running to the north from 5&deg; to 4&deg;
as stated, when the coast between 5&deg; and 4&deg; runs practically east and
west, with only a very slight trend to the north-west permitting a course only
a point or so north of west? The only possible answer to this question confirms
the inferred error of 5&deg; for 8&deg;. Even Burney as early as 1806 noticed
the error in the mention of 5&deg;, for on p. 313 he says "this seems to be an
irregularity in the account of Torres, as the coast begins to turn to the N.E.
between the 8th and 9th degree of South latitude". Collingridge also suspected
the error, and seems to imply that the latitude intended to be mentioned was
8&deg; not 5&deg;, for he says:</p>
<p class="quote">The only portion of the coast trending N.E. in anything like
the latitude mentioned, is from False Cape to Cape Kolff, along Frederick Henry
Island; this portion of the coast line is, however, in 7&deg; or 8&deg;
latitude S. instead of 5&deg;. There is reason to believe that this is,
nevertheless, the portion of the coast described as going N.E., because, as we
have seen <i>ante</i>, the head of the gulf they had previously visited (Gulf
of Papua), the latitude of which corresponds to this same degree of latitude
south, is also said to be in 5&deg; S., whereas it is in 8&deg; South.</p>
<p>From this it would appear that Collingridge's opinion was that Torres'
mention of 5&deg; should in both cases read 8&deg;. Our contention is that the
first mention of "five", translated as <i>five degrees</i> or <i>five
(degrees?)</i>, was intended to be read as five fathoms, whilst the second is a
clerical error for 8 degrees. Hence it is suggested that both the references to
5&deg;, whether in the Spanish or in the translation of Torres' letter, are
errors, and that he never intended to mention five degrees at all. This
analysis has been worked out quite independently of the new Prado
<i>Relaci&ograve;n</i>, but when we read that account of the voyage in
conjunction with the letter of Torres, our interpretation of the latter is
confirmed in a remarkable manner, as will presently be seen. It is therefore
submitted that all Bayldon's arguments that Torres made the coast at 5&deg;
near Cape Steenboom, and that the bank extended to that point, are based on a
misinterpretation of the statements in Torres' letter as given in the
translation printed by Markham, from which he (Bayldon) appears to have worked.
Whatever may be the nature of the error, surely one word or figure cannot be
held to outweigh and take precedence over the gist of the context, which
indicates, clearly enough, that the mentioned 5&deg; was the place where the
coast turned to the north-east, and not 5&deg; on the south coast of the
mainland in the neighbourhood of Cape Steenboom, where the coast runs
practically east and west.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 63}</p>
<p>It will be remembered that in the Burney-Markham version it is stated that
at 5&deg; "we stood to the north", whereas Stanley and Barwick both give "I
went on running to the north ". The former yields no indication of the
direction from which Torres came when he reached the point where he found the
coast trended to the north-east. On the other hand the rendering "I went on
running to the north" presupposes that he had already been sailing in that
direction. That this interpretation is correct seems to be confirmed by Prado,
for when speaking of the most southerly point reached (i.e. approximately
11&deg;), he says,</p>
<p class="quote">we went out towards the north and discovered a lofty cape of
the great country, we steered towards it and saw on anchoring that the coast
ran in a different direction and perceived that there was an end of coasting.
[<i>Vide</i> <i>infra</i>, p. 165.]</p>
<p>Prado further states that the cape lay in 8&frac12;&deg; altitude, so here
again we have evidence that the bank or shoals did not extend beyond the cape.
From the latitude mentioned it is perfectly clear that the cape they saw was
False Cape, and that they had been running to the north from approximately
11&deg; before they reached it. This entirely negatives Bayldon's theory that
the bank extended to 5&deg; and that Torres had been coasting close in along
the south shore of New Guinea after leaving the Gulf of Papua, when his course
would obviously have been practically due west, certainly not north. Our
contention is that he coasted along outside the shoals in a south-westerly
direction down to nearly 11&deg; S., trying all the time to find a passage
through to the north and west.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 64}</p>
<p>Bayldon in his preliminary "Remarks" appears to suggest that the letter of
Torres was written in general terms not always in chronological sequence, hence
he seems to feel himself justified in basing and supporting his arguments on
various statements excerpted and pieced together in the order in which he
imagines the described events occurred. Whereas if Torres' letter is read, as
the present writer believes it should be, as a veracious and strictly
chronological narrative (with the first error in the translation "five degrees"
altered to five fathoms, and the second 5&deg; corrected to 8&deg;), a very
different result must necessarily be reached. Consequently it is submitted that
the statement of Torres that he sailed as far to the south-west as 11&deg; S.
must still be held to be approximately correct, and that it has not been
disproved by Bayldon's arguments, however technical and ingenious.</p>
<p>In support of his contention that after leaving the Gulf of Papua Torres
sailed west along the south side of New Guinea, keeping as close in shore as
possible, Bayldon amplifies his arguments by suggesting reasons why he (Torres)
could not possibly have reached a latitude even approximating to 11&deg;. He
contends that the winds, the weather, the reefs, currents and channels of
Torres' time are still practically unaltered at the present day, and that it
would therefore have been impossible, with the ships in use in his time, for
Torres to have prevailed against them and sailed south-west to 11&deg; as he
claims to have done. For these reasons Bayldon thinks it safer to assume that
the latitudes, the distances and the directions reported by Torres <i>must</i>
be incorrect, simply because he (Bayldon) considers it would have been
physically impossible for Torres to have done what he actually said he did.
Surely this is rather a dangerous argument, and one not likely to convince the
experienced student of historic geography without some definite proofs.
Bayldon's arguments that Torres could not have done all that he claims are
purely suppositional. Definite statements such as those of Torres cannot be
disproved merely by a contradiction based on supposition alone.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 65}</p>
<p>What evidence can Bayldon offer, to prove what was the nature of the winds
and the actual state of the currents, channels, and shoals more than 300 years
ago? The strait is not known to have been traversed again until towards the end
of the eighteenth century, when Cook passed through in 1770 followed by Bligh
in 1789. After 300 years surely the natural inference is that, owing to the
continual scouring of the violent currents, some at least of the channels would
be more open, easier, and deeper than in Torres' day. But this line of argument
need not be elaborated until geographers and historians have decided on the
exact interpretation to be put upon the newly-discovered <i>Relaci&ograve;n</i>
of Prado, after carefully collating it with the Letter of Torres. The
<i>Relaci&ograve;n</i> appears absolutely to confirm the latter, and in no
single instance does it seem to offer any contradiction.</p>
<p>Until the discovery of the new <i>Relaci&ograve;n</i>, the Letter of Torres
of 1607, the Prado Maps and the letters of Prado sent home from Goa in 1613
(<i>Vide</i> the Appendix) provided the only evidence we had of the discovery
of the south side of New Guinea and the islands in the passage (now known as
Torres Strait) between that country and Cape York, the most northerly point of
Australia.</p>
<h4>THE LETTER OF TORRES AND PRADO'S <i>RELACI&Oacute;N</i> COMPARED</h4>
<p>Let us now examine the new <i>Relaci&oacute;n</i> and collate it with the
Letter of Torres, in order to see to what extent it either confirms or refutes
Bayldon's conclusions. The whole Letter of Torres (<i>Vide</i> Appendix I)
extends roughly to about 3650 words, but the part relating to his passage
through the strait (from the time he struck the southeast point of New Guinea
at 11&frac12;&deg; S. Lat. until he reached 4&deg; on the south coast) is so
condensed that it occupies only about 400 words.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 66}</p>
<p>That part of the new <i>Relaci&ograve;n</i> covering the same ground extends
to about 6500 words out of a total for the whole manuscript of roughly
22,500(*). Consequently the <i>Relaci&oacute;n</i>, being so much more
detailed, yields us far more definite information than has hitherto been
available. It may again be emphasised that nowhere does the
<i>Relaci&ograve;n</i> in any way conflict with the statements of Torres. On
the other hand the additional information given not only confirms the general
short narrative of Torres, but clarifies it on several points which might be
considered as indefinite or ambiguous, and which previous writers have
apparently misinterpreted. It may justly be said that the narratives of Torres
and Prado complement and supplement each other in a remarkable manner. The
brief nautical details given without dates by Torres fit in admirably with
Prado's lengthy descriptions of the islands discovered, of which he does not
always give the latitudes although frequently recording the dates.</p>
<blockquote>[* <i>Vide</i> p. 24.]</blockquote>
<p>It has already been suggested (p. 48) that the latitude 11&deg; S.,
mentioned by Torres, may not be absolutely correct, but that an error of only
one-sixth of a degree, making it 10&deg; 50', would have made his stated course
quite feasible. He could then have passed through Endeavour Strait along the
south side of Prince of Wales Island, thus being for some time within sight of
the mainland of Australia. Unfortunately the <i>Relaci&ograve;n</i> does not
definitely state the highest latitude attained, but from the general
information given it may clearly be inferred that the 11&deg; mentioned by
Torres cannot be very far wrong.</p>
<p>The <i>Relaci&ograve;n</i> recounts the voyage to the west along the south
coast of New Guinea from the time the southeast point was struck in 12&deg; S.,
or as Torres says in 11&frac12;&deg;. Numerous islands and places, many of
which are laid down on the Prado Maps, II and III(*), are described. At the
west end of the Gulf of Papua it became necessary to turn to the south-west,
just as Torres says, and islands in 8&frac12;&deg;, 9&deg; and 10&deg; are
named and descriptions given. The highest latitude actually mentioned is
10&deg; at an island they named "Isla de los Perros".</p>
<blockquote>[* <i>Vide</i> facsimiles at the end.]</blockquote>
<p class="page">{Page 67}</p>
<p class="quote">From this island, which is lofty, we counted forty, all
situated among the shoals...we tried <i>again</i> [<i>bolvimos</i>] to go to
the great land [i.e. New Guinea], but the shoals were so large that we could
not get across. [<i>Vide</i> p. 61.]</p>
<p>The use of the word "again" in this passage certainly presupposes the fact
that they had previously tried unsuccessfully to get back to the coast of New
Guinea before reaching 10&deg; S.</p>
<p>An eclipse of the moon seen from this island on September 22 is then
mentioned, and the narrative proceeds to describe how they went on for many
days struggling with the currents amongst the shoals, and how</p>
<p class="quote">on the eve of S. Francis [i.e. Oct. 3] we found other islands
<i>towards the north</i> and among them one bigger than the rest; and at
nightfall we anchored in five fathoms at half a league from the island...God
was pleased that we should henceforth find more water so that we had not to
wait for the tides; the wind being a strong breeze we went out towards the
north and discovered a lofty cape of the great country, we steered towards it
and saw on anchoring that the coast ran in a different direction and perceived
that there was an end of coasting. We were among these rocks and shoals for 34
days, they run out into the sea as far as we could judge about fifty leagues in
a southern direction [the sidenote adds "in 4 or 5 fathoms of water"]. It
pleased God that at this cape we got away from the shoals. They gave it the
name Cabo de San Pablo, it is in 8&frac12;&deg; altitude. [<i>Vide</i> p.
165.]</p>
<p>From the above quotation we learn definitely that after passing 10&deg; they
proceeded for at least twelve days (from September 22 to October 4) before
finding sufficient water to enable them to turn towards the north. In those
twelve days it is not unreasonable to infer that they must have increased their
latitude very considerably, say approximately by 1 degree, always supposing
that they continued to sail south-west.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 68}</p>
<p>Presumably they did so, for in one of the quotations given above it is
definitely stated that at 10&deg; "we tried again to go to the great land, but
the shoals were so large that we could not get across", the inference being
that they tried to go west or north-west but could not get through, so had to
continue on their course to the southwest. Finally it is recorded that they
were among the shoals for 34 days and that the shoals ran out "into the sea as
far as we could judge about fifty leagues in a southern direction ". Obviously
they must have rounded the shoals at the most southern point, otherwise how
could they have reckoned that they extended fifty leagues in a southern
direction? Then again the lofty cape they discovered was clearly False Cape,
the latitude of which is roughly 8&frac12;&deg; as stated, and where the coast
<i>does</i> run in a different direction, exactly as also stated by Torres.
Could anything be clearer?</p>
<p>Continuing</p>
<p class="quote">from this Cape...we bore northwards...and for two days we saw
the coast of the land very far away...We were very pleased at having left the
land on the east side, and steering north after four days we again discovered
very high land ahead...We ran before the east wind...proceeding westwards along
the shore. [<i>Vide</i> pp. 165-7.]</p>
<p>They discovered two harbours which they named <i>S. Juan del Prado</i> and
<i>San Lucas</i>, which harbours are both laid down with these names on Prado's
map, No. IV. No latitude is mentioned in the <i>Relaci&ograve;n</i>, but on
Prado's map it is marked as 3 2/3&deg; S. These harbours have been identified
as the modern Triton Bay. Nowhere is any higher latitude mentioned in this part
of the <i>Relaci&ograve;n</i>, but Torres definitely states that they fell in
with the coast at 4&deg;, and that it ran east and west. The two narratives are
so much in accord that it appears to be morally certain that Prado and Torres
did not strike the coast until a long way west of Cape Steen-boom, the point
suggested by Bayldon as agreeing with the 5&deg; <i>supposed</i> to have been
mentioned by Torres.</p>
<p>After a careful and impartial weighing of all these points, it is submitted
that the <i>Relaci&ograve;n</i> confirms our</p>
<p>interpretation of the narrative of Torres practically as it stands, and
militates against the correctness of Bayldon's deductions that Torres coasted
along the south side of New Guinea to 5&deg; S. as close in shore as possible,
and consequently could never have sighted the mainland of Australia.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 69}</p>
<h4>PRADO'S ACCOUNT OF THE VOYAGE</h4>
<p align="center"><i>[Continued from page 45]</i></p>
<p>Reverting to Prado's <i>Relaci&ograve;n</i>, if we read his narrative in
conjunction with the letter of Torres, and a modern large scale chart, we can
form a very fair idea of the course they took until they cleared the shoals and
islands and were able to turn towards the north and resume their voyage to
Manila. It is perfectly clear that after striking the south-east point of New
Guinea in 11&frac12;&deg; S. as Torres says, or 12&deg; as recorded by Prado,
they coasted to the west along the south side, always decreasing their latitude
as the coast gradually trended towards the north. Finally they reached a point
towards the northwest corner of the Gulf of Papua (given by Torres as
7&frac12;&deg;), where, finding they could go no farther in that direction by
reason of the many shoals and great currents they encountered, they were
compelled to sail out south-west in 5 fathoms to 11&deg; S. as stated by
Torres. It must not be forgotten that the main object of the voyage was to
reach Manila, which they knew lay away to the north-west in about 14&deg; N.
Lat. Hence, when reaching approximately 7&frac12;&deg; S. after working up the
coast to the west and north from 11&frac12;&deg; S. where they first struck New
Guinea, they would not have turned back again so far south as 11&deg; S. if
they could have found a passage through to the west in any lower latitude.</p>
<p>It is of course impossible to say what was the actual course taken through
the shoals and islands after they turned to the south-west in the Gulf of
Papua. All we know is that it lay between the two latitudes quoted by Torres as
7&frac12;&deg; and 11&deg; S.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 70}</p>
<p>Unfortunately Prado, though giving lengthy accounts of many of the islands
they saw or visited, seldom quotes their latitudes, hence their positions
cannot even approximately be located. But it is more than probable that from
his descriptions of their physical features, some experienced navigator,
familiar with the islands in Torres Strait, might well be able to identify some
of those mentioned. Similarly some scientist acquainted with the district might
be able to draw conclusions from the details of natural history and ethnography
also given by Prado. If only one island (for instance the one with the extinct
volcano) could be definitely located it would probably serve as a key to the
relative positions of many of the others.</p>
<p>It has already been mentioned that all the islands in Torres Strait now form
part of Australia. The probability that Prado and Torres passed between Prince
of Wales Island and the mainland of Australia has also been demonstrated,
unless we are prepared to admit that Torres' mention of S. is not even
approximately correct. Hence, unless the contrary can definitely be proved, it
is clear that they must have been for a considerable time in sight of the north
coast of Australia, in the neighbourhood of Peak Point at the western extremity
of the Cape York peninsula, for the distance between Prince of Wales Island and
the mainland is less than ten miles. The west coast of Australia south of Peak
Point is doubtless what appeared to Torres as more islands to the southward. It
is curious to note that at the most southerly point reached Prado speaks of
"other islands towards the <i>North [not south]</i> and among them one bigger
than the rest". Might this not have been Prince of Wales Island, the largest of
all? Even if we admit for the sake of argument that Prado and Torres did not
even approach 11&deg; but struck one of the channels further north (say
Normanby or Prince of Wales between 10&deg; 30' and 10&deg; 35') in the
neighbourhood of Horn Island or Wednesday Island, they would still have been in
sight of the mainland, for Peak Point is only about ten miles from Wednesday or
Horn. Consequently in any case there can be little doubt that the mainland of
Australia was unconsciously sighted. Was ever so great a discovery missed by so
small a margin? [<i>Vide</i> the sketch chart at the end.]</p>

the south east so that it was necessary to submit and go along the coast [i.e.
<i>to the west along the south side</i> (cf. Torres' Letter)]--continued
coasting for five days--on seventh day saw some lofty islets like sugar loaves
and sending in a boat discovered a nice harbour in 10&frac12;&deg;--I gave it
the name of Port Lerma--long description of the harbour and the Indians they

Guinea</i>] given the name of MAGNA MARGARITA--[p. 155] very big pearl shells

storm--Island discovered in 9&deg;, two leagues in circumference, named it
MALANDANZA on account of the difficulty of navigation--another island in
10&deg; named ISLA DE LOS PERROS (<i>Isle of Dogs</i>) on account of the number
of barking dogs--numerous ornaments found carved from turtle shell--[p. 161]
reached an Island of very tall cannibals, skirmish with them and one killed
whose foot measured 12 inches and his body 8 ft 4 inches in height--weapons
"very strong bows which we could not bend and clubs of touchstone, with a
handle in the middle as thick as the wrist, 3 feet nine inches long, and about
forty pounds in weight"--numbers of skulls and bones of men they had eaten
found in a village--"from this island, which is lofty, we counted forty, all
situated among the shoals"--went to a small island with abundance of
trees--"tried again to go to the great land i.e. <i>New Guinea</i>], but the
shoals were so large that we could not get across".</p>
<p class="page">{Page 72}</p>
<p>This last statement is very important as it shows that although they had
gone well beyond 10&deg; S. Lat. they had not yet found a passage through to
the north-west. As will be seen below they still went on and on for many days
before they found more water "and went out towards the north ". From this may
it not fairly be inferred that Torres' mention of 11&deg; must have been
approximately correct? (Cf. our arguments, pp. 49 and 66-9.)</p>
<p class="quote">[p. 161 continued]: Sept. 22 another eclipse of the moon--next
night a tempest arose and they thought they were lost as one of the cables
broke, so they all made confession and prepared to die commending themselves to
Jesus, Maria, Joseph--at dawn the storm ceased and when weighing the second
anchor they recovered the broken cable with it, and "saw clearly the favour S.
Joseph had obtained from the child Jesus"--[p. 163] could not get free of the
shoals so proceeded slowly at low water with foresail only--after three days
proceeding thus, reached a flat island a league and a half in circumference
which was "full of pumice stone and seems to have had a volcano in former
times"--gave it the name ISLA DE VULCAN QUEMADO [<i>island of extinct
volcano</i>]--went on to other islands and reached the largest which greatly
resembled the hill of Our Lady of Monserrateit got the name of MONSERRATE--went
in search of other islands and anchored between two--great quantities of flies
so named the island ISLA DE LAS CANTHARIDES--contrary currents so strong that
it was necessary for eight days and nights to have two men at the rudder to
keep the ship's head against the stream--when currents ceased, proceeded
towards two islands of no great size passing along a very narrow channel--at
the end of two days found other islands towards the North and one bigger than
the rest--anchored in 5 fathoms but bumped in the night--lightened the deck and
escaped--more water then found so went out towards the North.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 73}</p>
<p>This is the end of Prado's description of his tortuous voyage through the
shoals and islands in the passage to the south of New Guinea, now known as
Torres Strait, during which he unconsciously discovered Australia. The
remainder of the manuscript (pp. 165-204) describes the completion of the
voyage along the south side of the western end of New Guinea and through the
Moluccas and Philippines to Manila. Although the description of that part of
the voyage is entirely new historical material and equally interesting, it is
not proposed to do more here than give a brief abstract sufficient to show its
importance. From this abstract it will be seen that there is ample material for
another volume dealing with the discovery of the south side of New Guinea. It
is to be hoped that some student interested in the history of maritime
discovery in that region may be willing to undertake the task. The scope of the
present volume was always intended to be limited <i>firstly</i> to the new
light revealed by Prado on the character and actions of Quiros and the reasons
which caused him suddenly to abandon his voyage at the Island of <i>Espiritu
Santo</i> and return to America, and secondly to that part of the
<i>Relaci&ograve;n</i> which describes the discovery of Torres Strait and
Australia by Prado and Torres.</p>

<p class="page">{Page 75}</p>
<p>This concludes the actual account of the voyage. Continuing, Prado relates
(<i>Vide</i> pp. 193-5) how "at the beginning of June there came from New Spain
the ship <i>San Pedro</i>, which was our <i>Capitana</i>, and in it some
sailors from among those of our expedition who related to us what occurred
about the mutiny". Then follows a circumstantial account of the mutiny
(<i>Vide</i> pp. 195-7). After this comes a long account of the island of Luzon
and the city of Manila and its people, churches, buildings, trade, produce,
etc. etc. The manuscript ends with a lengthy description of the provinces of
the island called the <i>Great Margarita</i> [i.e. <i>New Guinea</i>], with a
list of the various nations, description of its physical features, and natural
and ethnographical history. Prado concludes his <i>Relaci&ograve;n</i> by
expressing the hope that the country may be conquered for the King of Spain.
Then comes the signature "Don Diego de Prado" with his rubric(*), beneath which
is the Certificate(*), already quoted on p. 37, followed by the note as to the

<h4><a name="p76" id="p76"></a>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTES</h4>
<h5>THE PRADO MAPS IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM</h5>
<p>Whilst making researches in the British Museum in the hope of finding
further biographical information relating to Don Diego de Prado y Tovar and
Luis Vaez de Torres, Mr Barwick was fortunate enough to recognise copies of the
four Prado Maps preserved in the Manuscript Department, where they had lain
practically unidentified for a period of eighty years. He immediately called
the writer's attention to them, and in the excitement of the moment it was
thought that a great cartographical "find" had been made, for two of the maps
appeared to bear the original signature and rubric of Diego de Prado. A day or
two afterwards, however, when opportunity offered for comparing the signatures
and rubrics with those at the end of the <i>Relaci&ograve;n</i>, and also with
those on the reduced facsimiles of the maps preserved at Simancas(*), it was
somewhat disappointing to find that the Museum signatures and rubrics were not
originals, but merely imitations. Further comparison of the Museum maps with
the reduced facsimiles of the Simancas originals showed that the former were
not duplicate originals, as was at first supposed, but copies made about a
hundred years ago. There can be no doubt about this, for one of them is drawn
on laid paper bearing the watermark "9 J. Whatman 1808 W. Balston". All four
maps were acquired by the British Museum in a large collection of Spanish
manuscripts and maps purchased in December 1848 from M. Fr. Michelena y Roias.
Hence it is evident that these copies must have been made between 1808, the
date of the watermark, and 1848 when they were acquired by the British
Museum.</p>

<p>These maps appear to be much the same in size as the Simancas originals,
judging by the 3/8 scale facsimiles of the latter given by Markham. The
geographical configurations and the place-names appear to be practically the
same, with here and there a slight variation in the spelling, e.g. <i>cavo</i>
in the copy for <i>cabo</i> in the original, etc., etc. There is however
considerable difference in the embellishments. In the originals (<i>Vide</i>
Markham's facsimiles) the whole of the interior of the land is ornamentally
shaded, whilst in the copies only a small portion of each (marked with the
letter A) is shaded. The remainder is merely tinted, but otherwise left
entirely blank. An explanatory note states: "Nota. Todo deve estar como lo que
b&agrave; se&ntilde;alado con la letra A--<i>All this is to be like that
indicated by letter A</i>". In most cases the title-letterings in the copies
differ from the originals in having no ornamental ribbon-cartouches. The
complete circular compass-stars of the originals are not repeated in the
copies, which have merely a single north and south line with half a
north-pointer attached to one side only.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 78}</p>
<p>The Prado Maps in the British Museum appear to have entirely escaped the
notice of Markham and other historians who have written on the voyage of Quiros
and its continuation. The fact that these maps have lain there undisturbed for
a period of more than eighty years is perhaps not so surprising as may at first
sight appear. It must not be forgotten that when in 1848 the maps were
purchased, the name of Diego de Prado y Tovar was practically unknown, so that
there was not much apparent connection through Prado between the said maps and
the voyages of Quiros and Torres. The Spanish names of the places laid down on
these maps in 1606 were also quite unknown in modern times (except perhaps the
island of Espiritu Santo), for they had never come into general use, because
the original maps, and the manuscripts describing the places mentioned, lay
hidden in Spanish archives for two or three hundred years, during which period
those very places were re-discovered and re-named by modern navigators.</p>

<p>The Map No. III could not at first be found in the British Museum, for no
entry of it could be traced in either of the above-mentioned catalogues, but
after a search through the whole of the Michelena Collection it was discovered
in the volume Add. 17651, from whence the catalogue entry was traced backwards.
From this it appeared that the location of the country represented had been
entirely mis-identified by the cataloguer, for the entries read as follows:</p>
<hr align="center" width="10%">
<p><i>Catalogue of 1861</i>, p. 584.</p>
<p>AMERICA (Mexico) California "La gran baya de S. Lorenzo y puerta de
Monte-Rei", drawn by Don Diego de Prado y Tovar on a scale of 11/12 inch to a
Castilian league. 1 f. 10&frac12; in. x 1 f. 4 in. [No entry under Prado.] Add.
17651. r.<br></p>
<hr align="center" width="10%">
<i>Catalogue of 1868.</i>
<p><i>In the Index:</i> Monterey <i>in California</i>. Plan of the great Bay of
S. Lorenzo, and port of. 17651. [N.B. <i>No entry under Prado and not mentioned
under the entry of 17651 in the body of the Catalogue.</i>]<br></p>
<p class="page">{Page 80}</p>
<p>It is somewhat surprising that this map should have been wrongly identified
as <i>Monterey in California</i>, for the latitude 10 1/6&deg; S. is actually
stated on it, whereas the latitude of the Californian Monterey is roughly
36&deg; 40' N.</p>
<p>Needless to say, during the examination of the Michelena Collection, special
search was made for a copy of the route map which Prado in his letter from Goa
on December 24, 1613, says he sent home, and to which he also refers at the end
of his <i>Relaci&oacute;n</i>, but no trace of it could be found. (Cf. p. 40
<i>ante</i>.)</p>
<p>Recent enquiries made in Spain through the agent successfully employed by Dr
Henry Thomas of the British Museum to obtain the photostat of the copy of the
Torres Letter preserved at Madrid, have resulted in the assurance that the
route map has not yet been located either at Madrid or Simancas, nor has any
trace been found of the original of the Torres Letter supposed to be preserved
at Simancas(*). Further investigations are in progress in both cases.</p>
<blockquote>[* Cf. pp. 58-9]</blockquote>
<p>The descriptive legends appearing on the four Prado Maps preserved at
Simancas had to be omitted in the facsimiles published in the <i>Boletin</i>
(from which our facsimiles and those of Markham are reproduced), because the
reduction to 3/8 scale would have made them practically illegible. Consequently
they were transcribed and printed separately in the <i>Boletin</i>. Markham
(pp. 469-74) gives a translation of them, together with some valuable notes as
to the identification of the localities represented, deduced from a comparison
with the charts and surveys of modern navigators. It will be observed that the
translations of the four legends given in our Appendix III vary considerably
from those of Markham. They have been carefully revised by Mr Barwick from the
Spanish text as printed in the <i>Boletin</i>, collated with the transcriptions
on the copies of the Prado Maps preserved in the British Museum.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 81}</p>
<h4>THE JOURNAL OF LEZA THE PILOT</h4>
<p>There was also found in the volume Add. 17625 of the Michelena Collection of
Spanish MSS., acquired by the British Museum in 1848, a transcript of the
Journal of the Pilot Gaspar Gonzalez de Leza, which seems to have escaped the
notice of Markham and all other writers. At the commencement of the voyage Leza
was junior pilot under Quiros in the <i>Capitana</i>, but appears to have
succeeded Juan Ochoa de Bilboa as chief pilot after the latter had been
relegated to the <i>Almiranta</i> in circumstances detailed by Prado in his
<i>Relaci&ograve;n</i>. (<i>Vide</i> pp. 44-5 and 113--15. Cf. footnote, p.
195.)</p>
<p>Markham prints a complete translation of Leza's Journal in vol. II of <i>The
Voyages of Quiros</i> (pp. 321-403), and states on p. xiv that the manuscript
is in the Royal Library at Madrid (J. 2)(*) and that it was first printed by
Zaragoza(**). The British Museum transcript was made about a hundred years ago,
and the text appears to agree with the version printed by Zaragoza, from which
Markham's translation was presumably made.</p>
<blockquote>[* As this press mark J. 2 is the same as that of the volume
containing the letter of Torres, a photostat of which has just been secured
from the <i>Biblioteca Nacional</i> at Madrid, it is to be presumed that
Markham's citation <i>Royal Library</i> should now be amended.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** Zaragoza, Justo. <i>Historia del descubrimiento de las regions
australes hecho por el General Pedro Fernandez de Quiros.</i> 3 vols. Madrid
1876.]</blockquote>
<h4>ANOTHER QUIROS "MEMORIAL"</h4>
<p>The volume Add. 17625 also includes at folio 87 a transcript of a Memorial
by Quiros which seems to be entirely unknown, as no reference to it can be
traced. As it does not appear to contain any fresh information, it has not been
thought necessary to do more here than merely record the fact of its
existence.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 82}</p>
<h4>THE ROUTE OF PRADO AND TORRES</h4>
<p>In conclusion it only remains to be stated that in order that the course of
the voyage of Prado and Torres may be more easily followed, the writer has
prepared a rough sketch chart (afterwards redrawn to scale by Mr H. F. Milne)
deduced from the dates, latitudes and places mentioned by Prado in his
<i>Relaci&ograve;n</i> or by Torres in his letter.</p>
<p>On this chart the supposed route is indicated by a dotted line, but this of
course must be taken as merely approximate, for, although certain positions are
definitely mentioned, there is no evidence from which to determine any
deviations from the direct course made between one place and another by reason
of the shoals, currents, winds, etc.</p>
<p>The positions laid down on the chart are numbered to correspond with a
<i>Table of References</i> printed thereon. This table also serves as an index
to the book by giving the pages on which the various positions laid down on the
chart are mentioned.</p>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>NOTE ON PRADO'S <i>RELACI&Oacute;N</i></h2>
<p>The circumstances in which this manuscript was discovered are recounted in
the editor's foreword, and a description of it will be found on p.24
<i>ante</i>.</p>
<p>The 32 pages vary somewhat in size, the average being roughly 8 inches wide
by 10&frac34; long, irrespective of margin. The reduced facsimile of the first
page (opposite) gives a good idea of the general appearance of the MS., and
enables the handwriting to be identified with that on the four Prado Maps
preserved at Simancas, reduced facsimiles of which are included in the
Appendix. On p. 206 is a reduced facsimile of the smaller last page, containing
the signature and rubric of Prado, which can thus be compared with those on his
Map No. IV. This end page also contains the copy of the Certificate of Torres
and the other officers testifying to the truth of Prado's
<i>Relaci&ograve;n</i> (cf. p. 37). At the foot of the page is the Note
referring to the Route Map now unfortunately lost (cf. p. 40).</p>
<p>Owing to the numerous contractions used by Prado, the MS. is reprinted with
the contractions expanded, in order that the translation may be more easily
followed. Small letters at the beginning of paragraphs have been replaced by
capitals, and a few commas have been introduced where necessary.</p>
<p>The sixteen leaves of the original manuscript are numbered from 96 to 111 in
continuation of previous papers bound in the same volume. In the [Spanish text
of the] following reprint the beginning of each page is indicated by the mark
"|", whilst the corresponding numeration is inserted in the margin thus [96
<i>a</i>], [96 <i>b</i>], etc., etc., the <i>a</i> representing the recto and
the <i>b</i> the verso of the leaf. [The Spanish text has not been reproduced

<p>King Don Philip our lord, whom God preserve for long and happy years,
ordered the Count de Monterey, who was then Viceroy of the fertile and
extensive Kingdoms of Peru and Chile, to fit out two ships in the port of
Callao of Lima adequate for any work, and equip and supply them sufficiently
both with arms and munitions and provisions for one year and deliver them when
ready to the Captain and chief Pedro Fernandes de Quiros, a Portuguese, in
order that he may make the discovery of the unknown and Southern lands as he
has offered and has been ordered to do.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 89}</p>
<p>All this the said Viceroy fulfilled as His Majesty had commanded him, paying
all the men for one year. <b>The capitana was called the San Pedro y San Pablo,
it was of 60 tons</b> with the following crew: commander Pedro Fernandes de
Quiros, captain Don Diego de Prado, chief pilot Juan Ochoa de Bilbao, of
Seville, master Manuel Noble; accountant and overseer Juan de Iturbe; three
Franciscan Fathers, whose commissary was Father Juan de Bonilla; a surgeon and
doctor named Alonso Sanches of Seville and besides these sixty sailors
Spaniards, Portuguese and Flemings; armed with six pieces of bronze artillery,
three to four pounders; twenty muskets; forty arquebuses; four blunderbusses;
two roqueras(*); sixty jars containing an arroba of powder apiece; twenty round
shields; twenty pikes and halberds and small spears as needful; rope, lead and
iron shot in sufficiency, and enough biscuit and other provisions for a year,
with eight hundred jars of water.</p>
<blockquote>[* Possibly = <i>roqetes</i>, rammers for the guns.]</blockquote>
<p><b>Of the almiranta San Pedrico the captain was Luis Baes de Torres</b>, a
Breton; master Gaspar de Gaya; pilot Juan Bernardo Fontydue&ntilde;a; three
Franciscan Friars and forty sailors; six pieces of cast iron artillery of 3
pounds of ball; twenty muskets; twenty arquebuses, two roqueras(*); twenty
pikes, twenty round shields, fifteen halbards and small spears; forty cases of
powder, iron shot, lead and rope in sufficiency, with biscuit and the other
provisions in abundance and six hundred jars of water. <b>It was of forty
tons</b>.</p>
<blockquote>[* Possibly = <i>roqetes</i>, rammers for the guns.]</blockquote>
<p>And for greater abundance he gave him an English launch with twelve sailors,
very well equipped and armed, its captain and pilot was Pedro Bernal
Zerme&ntilde;o(*), <i>the launch was named Los Tres Reyes Magos</i>, and was
added in order that if God should be pleased that southern land should be
discovered, he should despatch it at once with the news with all the speed due
to His Majesty's service.</p>
<blockquote>[* = Cerme&ntilde;o.]</blockquote>
<p class="page">{Page 91}</p>
<p>After the ships were delivered to Pedro Fernandez de Quiros <b>he set out on
S. Thomas's Day</b>(*) from the port of Callao of Lima at four in the
afternoon, and passing in front of the capitana of Peru we saluted the Royal
Standard with all our artillery and arquebuses, and the said capitana duly
replied: the port of Callao was so full of people that it looked as though the
city were deserted to see a thing never seen before. The route was taken to the
islands of Las Hormigas nine leagues from Callao to the west south west with
the south wind which is the usual one on that coast.</p>
<blockquote>[* 21st of December 1606. The date of 1606 is a clerical error for
1605.]</blockquote>
<p>On reaching the large island which is in front of Callao the Captain and
<b>Commander Quiros hoisted his standard</b>. He did not do it sooner for the
Viceroy forbad it saying it was only permitted to Generals and as he was not
one it could not be allowed. It was of crimson damask in the shape of a scalene
triangle with a Christ crucified in the centre, with the Apostle S. Peter on
the right side and the globe of the world beneath the feet, and another royal
salute was given; then the captains hoisted their flags, that of Don Diego de
Prado was white with a cross of Calatrava in the centre and edged round with a
band more than half a span wide chequered yellow, red and blue. And after the
voyage, when the aforesaid reached the island of Malta and the new city of
Valetta, he had some roman characters written round it saying, speaking with
the Cross, With thee I have gone round the whole world and have discovered new
southern kingdoms, Lippis, Canais Suleis and Hobania&ntilde;os(*) for the great
Philip, King of the Spains; and it is now in the chapel of Nuestra Senora de la
Buena Ventura in the church of S. Basil the Great, for when it was hoisted it
was dedicated to the said Virgin. That night we reached the said islands of Las
Hormigas and the said Quiros ordered the said route of west south west to be
taken, and at <b>fifty leagues out he made west for us which is more in
favour</b>, and afterwards the wind came east which is the levant.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 93}</p>
<p>A fortnight after we left Callao they took the sun with the astrolabes and
found they were in sixteen degrees of south altitude. That night as it was very
clear we saw in the sky three clouds, each in the form of an altar-cloth, but
much larger, two were white and the other black as pitch smoke, in the
north-north-east quarter, the first was white like the Milky Way which in
Castile they call S. James's Way, and seemed full of very brilliant stars; the
altitude was taken with the cross-staff and it was found to be 30&deg; above
the horizon, some said that that altitude is over the hill of Potosi; the other
was black and much larger and diverted towards the north, also full of stars,
and this was 40&deg; above the horizon; the other was white and much larger and
higher than the others, in the direction of the black one, in 55&deg; above the
horizon; these were seen from the ships for the space of two months; <b>and
being 100 leagues at sea the wind came east</b>, which is the levant, and did
not leave us until after the tropic was passed; and following the said route on
the 14th of January they took the sun with the astrolabes and found we were in
24&deg; of altitude and different oceans were seen, for we had passed the
tropic with the wind favourable. On that day there was half a gale from west to
more than south-west; <i>in the afternoon were seen great and very dense masses
of cloud and mist which the earth is wont to discharge</i>, it was noted at
sunset that they broke up at the bottom and the sun did not appear again. The
following days it was noticed to be the same; they are signs of land and if
they are large it is a great country. I told Captain Quiros what occurred and
that it was a sign of great and lofty country, but as it had not come out of
his own head he did not take much account of it. I told the chief Pilot, as he
was a very practical sailor and very competent in his profession, that it
seemed to me that we were near land; he answered that he thought likewise and
had noticed the same thing. I also told it to other good sailors who came from
the ship(**) and they agreed, and the Pilot Fontidue&ntilde;a also when he came
to take the watchword said that he had noticed it; we all agreed that it should
be observed daily, and this was done until we reached 26&deg; of altitude and
it was found that the more we approached them the more they increased.</p>
<blockquote>[* Cf. <i>infra</i>, p. 201]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** i.e. from the San Pedrico.]</blockquote>
<p class="page">{Page 95}</p>
<p>In 25 days we reached that altitude, and on that day in particular the said
clouds were observed, and the sun entered them at half past 2 in the afternoon
and was not seen until the following day. The sky in all parts was clear of
clouds, only that part was overcast; wherein all assented, and were convinced
and said that it must be land and very large. We informed Pedro Fernandez de
Quiros thereof and convinced and persuaded him by evident reasons. He ordered
the chief and lower officers of the ships to be summoned in order that it might
be decided what was to be done. <b>They held a full council and after many pros
and cons they concluded that it was land and that we were near it and decided
that we should go to it</b>. I said to him that he should remember that when
the Viceroy of Peru took our oath of fealty, one of the things he most charged
us with was that if we should discover any land towards the south-west that in
every instance it should be approached to discover it, for he gave the
well-equipped launch for this purpose, and it would be a great service to his
Majesty; and he thus commanded all of us. He decided that we should go thither
on the following day and ordered that the route he took should be followed;
upon such a good decision all proceeded to their ships and the men were very
happy and contented. The Chief Pilot and an innkeeper, a relation of his, a
Portuguese(*), seeing that this would be a reason for lengthening the voyage to
the Philippines spoke secretly to the said Quiros and put before him such fears
and impediments as interested men are wont to adduce, and without further
consultation he gave orders at midnight that the course should be directed
north north west, at dawn we saw the almiranta and launch at a great distance
continuing their route.</p>
<blockquote>[* Pedro Lopez de Sojo (?).]</blockquote>
<p class="page">{Page 97}</p>
<p>If the weather had brought a fresher breeze they would doubtless have borne
away and lost sight of us. The interest of this man was that the Chief Pilot,
Juan Ochoa de Bilbao, for his good deeds had been sentenced to the galleys for
six years in Cartagena, and the Viceroy commuted this sentence on condition
that he should serve his Majesty in that voyage without pay, and on arriving at
Manila, the chief and capital city of the Philippine Islands, he should then
have completed his liability in regard to the galleys; but as this pilot had
many debts to merchants in Lima he was seized for 16,000 dollars(*) which they
had entrusted to him and which he had gambled away; and so that his Majesty's
service should not be hindered the said Viceroy agreed with the merchants that
the said <b>Quiros should be security and should undertake not to release him
in Manila, but to deliver him up in Seville, when please God the President and
Auditors of the Contrataci&oacute;n would ship and forward him to Lima and
deliver him to his creditors, which obligation the said Quiros undertook</b>.
(The innkeeper or grocer had shipped about two hundred jars of white wine,
knowing that it was at a high price in Manila and more than thirty dollars a
jar, and the said Quiros having ordered it to be shipped gave it to be
understood that he was interested therein, wherein he did disservice to his
Majesty and injury to all those on board, since to accommodate them they took
out those of fresh water which they brought for the crew, and this was the
cause that it was lacking at the due time as will be then shown.)</p>
<blockquote>[* <i>Vide</i> p. 113, 14,000.]</blockquote>
<p>The crew of the armada seeing the excellent resolution taken and the evil
one that had been carried out without any reason for it, took occasion
therefrom to raise a mutiny and pay the said Quiros what he deserved, for they
held it for certain that this armada would end like that of the Adelantado
Avenda&ntilde;o(*) whose Chief Pilot was the said Quiros when he went in search
of the Solomon Isles.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 99}</p>
<p>Seeing how great disservice had been done to his Majesty by not having gone
in search of land so near, as the council had decided, I told him how badly he
had acted, reproaching him as a man of little knowledge and who did not
consider the charge he held and what an evil account he was beginning to give
of himself, and other things conducive to his Majesty's service, and I put
before him that he should remember that when the Viceroy of Peru took our oath
of fealty the first thing he charged us with was that we should ascend to
30&deg; of altitude and see if there was any land in that region, and if we saw
evident signs we should go thither, and on having found it we should send the
launch which he gave us for that purpose, for therein we should do great
service to his Majesty. And what he answered me was, that he knew what he was
doing.</p>
<blockquote>[* <i>Sic</i> = Menda&ntilde;a.]</blockquote>
<p>I told him also that the people of the ship(*) know it and are saying that
his relation's jars of wine and other merchandise count for more than the
service of his Majesty, who has shown him such great favour in having honoured
him and placed him in this position, and that he might reckon for certain that
some day it would come to his knowledge and that he would reward him as he
deserved. From thenceforth he took the greatest dislike and towards me and said
to one of his friends(**) that he would leave me ashore on a desert island; I
replied that I had to be in his company for he was mistaken about any other
fate. So continuing the said route of north north west on the 22nd of January
<b>they discovered a flat island with short brushwood and a reef of sand-banks
which ran far out in the sea, and being late it was not approached</b>. The
next day he wished to go to it; the currents drove us so much that it was not
possible, for at midday a storm of wind from the south west came upon us with
heavy showers so that we were forced to lower the sails. This finished
undeceiving us and gave us to understand how near we were to the land we left.
The island would be about a league in circumference, it is in 24&frac12;&deg;
of altitude; it was the height of summer in that antarctic pole.</p>
<blockquote>[* i.e. the San Pedrico.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** Probably Pedro Lopez de Sojo.]</blockquote>
<p class="page">{Page 101}</p>
<p>Continuing then the said route on the 25th of January they discovered
another smaller islet and not finding any anchorage we passed in the open sea;
they gave it the name of Sin Provecho(*), it is in 23&deg; of altitude.</p>
<blockquote>[* = Useless]</blockquote>
<p><b>Continuing the said course on the 2nd of February very late we saw
another island of a league and a half in circumference; we reached it on the
day of San Blas(*) and they gave it that name; all were uninhabited, it is in
the altitude of 20&deg;.</b></p>
<blockquote>[* =Saint Blaze.]</blockquote>
<p>On the sixth of the same they discovered four islands with a cocoanut palm
in the largest of them, a boat's crew went but not finding people or water
therein we passed outside, they gave them the name of the Quatro Hermanas(*),
they are in the altitude of 19&frac12;&deg;.</p>
<blockquote>[* = Four Sisters.]</blockquote>
<p>On the 9th of the same they discovered a lofty island which would have two
leagues of circumference, <b>and as it was Saint Polonia's day they gave it her
name, it is in altitude 18&deg;</b> without harbour or anchorage or beach or
water; now already want of water was felt, for each one got two cuartillos(*) a
day, which was real misery; the reason was that it had been turned out to stow
the jars of wine of the grocer relation.</p>
<blockquote>[* = 2 pints.]</blockquote>
<p><b>The said Quiros seeing that they had not discovered any inhabited island
seemed to lose what judgment was left to him and summoning the crew of the ship
said to them in a doleful voice:</b> Brethren and Gentlemen, all these islands
which you have seen are signs of land close by; if God should grant that we
find some island, even though it may not contain more than just two Indians, I
give you my word that we shall be able to reckon ourselves the most fortunate
men who have gone forth from Spain, for I will give you as much silver and gold
as you can carry and such a quantity of pearls that you shall measure them by
hatfuls; for that of Peru and of New Spain is a very small matter compared with
what I am telling you.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 103}</p>
<p>He was asked if he had seen it and answered no. Someone answered him, Leave
that wind for a time of calms for then it will be useful, what we see is that
you do not know whither you are going, and it will be the same in future, and
since you did not choose to enjoy the favour which God would have given us at
26&deg; of altitude do not take us into shoals and rocks, since for the rest we
are already certain that everything will end in smoke as usual. <b>Sailing on
the same course on the eve of San Guillermo in the afternoon we discovered
land, we went to it and as it was a very flat and swampy island we were nearer
to it than we thought for; while carefully surveying the shore I saw smoke come
from the land, and I told the said Quiros, and that it was a sign that it was
inhabited, and at the end of half an hour we saw people moving along the shore,
and we pointed them out to the said Quiros, whereat he was pleased, as may be
imagined, and ourselves not less. It is in the altitude of 17&deg;</b> and that
name remained to it; it would be about 7 leagues in circumference, and is
mostly swampy when the tide rises; it has only one high portion where there are
some cocoanut palms and the village, the rest is covered with water and at low
tide a big lake is left in the centre, and as the wind was rough we got close
in but found no anchorage; the boat went ashore and our people got out; the
Indians received them with great joy kissing their hands, arms and breasts, and
never tired of looking at them, giving them many caresses and showing them the
village in order that they might go to it, but as it was very late they left
it; their chief came next day with two canoes and they gave him a jacket and
drawers of green taffety and a mirror, at which he made grimaces like a monkey,
but would never come on board the ship; he went ashore and sent in return a cap
of palm leaves and some red hairs of a woman which were dried in the sun,
wherewith the said Quiros was very pleased.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 105}</p>
<p>Following our route after two days <b>they discovered a very flat and low
island which would be two leagues in circumference, we reached it, but not
finding anchorage and it being uninhabited we passed outside, it is in
15&frac12;&deg; of altitude</b>, they gave it the name of Sinbentura(*).
<b>Twelve days after we left this island we discovered another which seemed to
be three islands; we went to it and Pedro Fernandes de Quiros said that he had
been in it and that he had marked it in the map, that it was called the island
of San Bernardo</b>; the men went to it in the boat and found that it consisted
of twenty-two islets, uninhabited and without water, trees or scrub for wood.
They brought some red fish and others green, which they call parrots, soft and
ill tasted, and some morenas(**) marked grey on white like grains of mustard,
and we perceived that it was not the one the said Quiros mentioned, it is in
10&deg; altitude.</p>
<blockquote>[* = No luck.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** A Spanish fish of the eel tribe.]</blockquote>
<p>Proceeding on the same route after three days <b>we saw a low island very
full of cocoanut palms</b>, six canoes came out and approached near to the
ships, the men were white and well-disposed and came near the ships but would
not come on board, and as the Almiranta was closer in it wished to anchor but
found no place; the launch being a smaller vessel reached further on shore and
anchored in about 10 fathoms as they said. The Indians liking the look of that
vessel dived and drew out the anchor and pulled the launch towards the shore by
the cable; the sailors perceiving what they were doing fired blunderbusses and
muskets at them and killing some they unwillingly relinquished the position;
more than three hundred Indians came out of the village and formed a long
squadron with their red banners to avenge the injury and defend themselves from
us. Forty shooters went ashore to seek fresh water, and on experiencing the
arquebuses they gave up the position and fled away tumultuously to the other
side of the island, crossing in boats a lake in the middle of it; we went to
the village which was of neat houses of reeds lined with palm mats, very well
made, of various colours; they found(*) a quantity of fish hooks of all kinds
made of mother of pearl and highly wrought, and many strings of sun-dried
oysters and when we eat them we found good pearls and seed pearls in them, very
much injured by opening the shells by fire; we did not find fresh water so
doubtless they subsisted on the water of the cocoanuts, and by collecting the
sap of the palms which is very thin like sugar juice. It would be three leagues
in circumference, there are no other trees in it except cocoanut palms; it lies
in 10&deg; of altitude.</p>
<blockquote>[* The word "hallaron" inserted.]</blockquote>
<p class="page">{Page 107}</p>
<p><i>Continuing the route to the west in three days' time we saw a quantity of
wolf-fishes in large shoals, which is a sign of low and swampy land, and many
birds, white rabijuncos(*), which have a long thin tail of a single feather of
two spans(**) long, and a quantity of rabiforcados(***), they are like kites
with long forked tails; also there appeared many snakes marked in yellow and
black with broad tails like morenas(****); all these are signs of land
near.</i> And continuing the said route <b>on the 22nd of March the moon was
eclipsed to a red colour approaching black, it began at eight o'clock at night
and ended at three in the morning.</b> Talking in Ternate with the Camp Master
Juan de Esquibel about this eclipse he said that our armada was then on the
route for Ternate, and they saw the eclipse and after the conquest of the
island the King of Ternate said that that eclipse denoted and announced the
loss of his country, and that as he was a Moor he gives much credit to matters
of the moon.</p>
<blockquote>[* =rushtails.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** = 16 inches.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[*** = forked tails.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[**** Morenas, see note 2 on p. 105]</blockquote>
<p><b>Proceeding on that course east west which is from the levant to the west,
it pleased God that on the 8th of April they should discover lofty land but not
very large</b>, and in the afternoon we anchored between some islets and the
land; a harbour of good depth and safe; they saw on one island many trees of
plantains, the ordinary fruit of the Indies; the boat went to the shore and
they brought back many very good plantains with which we were all refreshed. In
the morning after sunrise we set sail and went to anchor opposite the village
of this island which is called Taumaco, which is on a reef with shoals that are
very difficult to get between, with neat houses of beams and rushes, with its
streets and alleys very well laid out; the island is in the shape of an
equilateral triangle and would be about three leagues in circumference, it has
five other islands adjacent, all inhabited and mostly of the same size; this
island is very fresh, with pretty groves and very good springs of water; the
men are white with very handsome features, full bearded and good looking and
tall and big; they cover their private parts with loin cloths.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 109}</p>
<p>The village is situated on sandbanks which they have covered with rubble and
have built the village thereon, with some fruit trees round about; it measures
in the salt water about four hundred paces, with numerous reefs around, with
water up to the waist, so that in order to get to the land they have to pass
this arm of water. <b>Directly they saw our ships anchor they took the women
and children and old folks inland and put them in the woods</b>, and made ready
to fight. When they saw that our boats drew near within musket shot of the
village, the chief, called in their tongue the Tampitao, came through the water
nearly up to the boats and called out loudly Ha! ha! raising his hand and
dropping it he said pu! pu! yac! Captain Luis Baes understood perfectly that he
meant to say, Sir, make them put down the arquebuses; he answered him by signs
that he likewise should have the arrows put down; he went ashore and brought a
quantity of bows and arrows and coming to the boat delivered them to Luis Baes,
first raising his hands to heaven in token of peace and friendship, and he was
answered in like manner. Luis Baes told him by signs that he would like to land
in the village with the crew, and he answered with his head in our manner that
we should go.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 111}</p>
<p>We learned from what he said that he was in the island of Santa Cruz when
the soldiers of the Adelantado Avenda&ntilde;o(*) killed the Tampitao Malope
with an arquebuse, and thence knew the arquebuses which he called the pu, and
consequently came to us in peace in order to save his people from a like
fate.</p>
<blockquote>[* <i>Sic</i> = Menda&ntilde;a.]</blockquote>
<p>We disembarked at the village, placing our sentinels in the most necessary
positions, and our head quarters, and informed Captain Quiros of what had taken
place, and on the following day he came with three friars with the ornaments
for saying mass; we fitted up a good house of boards with an altar, and with
the pictures and images they brought it seemed as if that house had been
erected specially for a church. The Tampitao with a little son was always with
us. A Father put on his vestments and said the first mass, and whatever the
Spaniards did he(*) did the same, kneeling with great attention, standing up at
the holy gospel, kneeling again at the elevation of the most holy sacrament and
beating his breast, and standing up at the last gospel.</p>
<blockquote>[* i.e. the Tampitao.]</blockquote>
<b>On the following day four Indians came who were evidently some of the chiefs
and spoke to the Tampitao and were present at all the masses as if they had
been taught, and when they were ended we invited them to eat; they ate without
suspicion, but when they tasted the wine they made signs that it was good; and
after the meal they asked by signs what it was the friars had done and they
were told that it was God of Heaven, and they said Dios, Dios with bow and
reverence to the most holy name of God. Many of our people were moved at seeing
them, reflecting how easily they would become Christians.</b> And they asked
him what islands there were in that part and he indicated more than thirty in
different directions, and for those of cannibals he bit his arm; and pointing
to the West he said hu hu hu, raising his arms up and dropping them to the
ground, which meant a very great land having great animals with horns on their
heads which are buffaloes, which they worship as gods so that they may not harm
them, and this land which he described was that which we afterwards discovered,
as time and experience showed; <b>this island of Taumaco is in 10&deg;
altitude</b>.
<p class="page">{Page 113}</p>
<p>Captain Don Diego de Prado knowing for certain that the crew of the Capitana
were going to mutiny informed the said Quiros by way of confession through the
Father Commissary of the Franciscans, who told the said Don Diego that he also
knew it and had informed him and would do so again, but the said Quiros took no
notice of it; <b>so the said Don Diego, seeing the little remedy that was to be
expected, asked leave of the said Quiros to pass to the Almiranta with his
rations, which were the same as those of the said Quiros</b>; he granted it to
get rid of the bother, and Don Alonso de Soto-mayor went in his place. The said
Don Diego knew who were the mutineers and how they wanted him for head, but he
did not want to mix in such conflicts and lose the honour which he had gained
in the service of his Majesty, so he at once shifted his things to the
Almiranta, whereat the Captain thereof was very pleased. The next day the
surgeon(*) did the same. While our people were washing their clothes at a
spring he [i.e. Quiros] ordered the Chief Pilot Juan Ochoa de Vilbao(**) to be
seized and taken to the Almiranta with verbal orders that he should be
garrotted at once and cast into the sea after confession: Luis Baes de Torres
told me privately thereof, I told him that he should carry out nothing unless
it was given to him in writing, that he well knew how changeable and
untrustworthy the said Quiros was and that the said Pilot owed 14,000
dollars(***) to the merchants of Lima and how the said Quiros guaranteed to
deliver him to the President of the Contrataci&oacute;n of the Indies on
reaching Seville in order that they might send him back to Peru, and other
things which he ought to know, and if he did what the said Quiros sent to tell
him without having it in writing they would look to him about it; and the said
Quiros might say that he had not ordered such a thing, and they would call him
to account for the death and for the money.</p>
<blockquote>[* Alonso Sanchez of Seville. <i>Vide</i> p. 1.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** <i>Vide</i> p. 203, where Ochoa certifies this
narrative.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[*** <i>Vide</i> p. 97 <i>ante</i>, 16,000.]</blockquote>
<p class="page">{Page 115}</p>
<p>As a prudent man he was grateful for the good advice and himself asked for
the same in writing, but he would not give it nor would the other do it(*); and
when afterwards I learned privately from a friend of his(**) the reason which
had moved him it was that he complained of the said Pilot that by his steering
he had robbed him of a quarter of wind which means much way, and he had no
reason to say such a thing. I went with the said Luis Baes to the said Quiros
and with kind and gentle words we got from him the cause which had moved him to
do such a thing. I replied he is not in fault but you, for you were daily and
hourly at the binnacle watching the needle, if he did this wickedness you
should then at once have had him seized in the very act and punished and not
now after four months of navigation; and if he says, as is well known, that you
do not know where you are going, time has shown it to us, and from what you
have told us we are going very far out of our way; and I told him other things
so that he was worse than before; but they were for the service of his Majesty;
and thereupon we went ashore with our men. <b>In this village we found some
boats to hold 60 persons with which they navigate, very different from those of
Europe, and each one required as much sail as our ship, they are in the
following form</b>; on two concave beams inside, each 60 feet long and 18 feet
thick, I mean in circumference, they build their boat, that is 12 battens
crossing from one beam to the other, each 30 feet long and inserted in the said
beams, and each half a yard(***) thick; on these beams they put some curved
timbers of a span(****) each, 30 in number like an arch, with 8 planks across
on the sides, half a foot thick and a foot and a half wide, fastened with
strong cords of cocoanut fibre, these curved timbers are each about 16 feet
high; on this arch are other thinner planks crossed in a square in which they
make the upper deck of the vessel where the crew who manage the sail are
placed.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 117}</p>
<p>The flooring is a strong mat of rushes very well made, with a door for the
crew to go in and out, in the middle of these curved timbers they have other
planks like a platform, where they put the food and drink which they carry in
cane tubes, each tube holding half an arroba(*****) of water, very well laced
and stowed; in the laths which are in the water they fix stones for ballast;
from the laths in the water some planks project to the upper deck a yard
higher, they are well fastened and in them they fix a strong rail of stout
canes; the topmast is of three very stout canes with its pulley-block and sail
yard of cane fixed in the middle of the said vessel, which requires as much
sail as our ship; at the ends of the beams of the poop they have two high seats
with two great oars placed in them with which they steer the ship; with the
wind astern they will go well, if it is on the side on the bowline they are
worthless; they require little water and so do not need a boat for landing;
their bread is sago, and further on the manner of making it will be
described.</p>
<blockquote>[* Ochoa was not killed as he signed the certificate at the
end.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** Pedro Lopez de Sojo (?).]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[*** Yard = 33 inches.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[**** = 8 inches.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[***** = 4 gallons.]</blockquote>
<p>At the sides of the beams they have some small planks and seats from which
they row with their paddles, which are a kind of oars made like rackets, two
yards long, and these are used through all this country up to Borneo and in the
Moluccas. After supplying the ships with water and wood, eight days after
landing in the island Pero Fernandez de Quiros sent an order to Luis Baes who
was on shore to embark the crew at dawn and take with them four Indians of the
youngest and best disposed he could find, and he did so and among them he
shipped two nephews of the Tampitao; he went to the capitana and left two
Indians, the others he took to the almiranta, and on their arrival we set sail.
God permitted that within an hour they all went away, jumping into the sea and
swimming ashore. All rejoiced to see them go, for in payment of the good deed
they had done us in receiving us and supplying the ships he gave them that
recompense. It is after the custom of Portuguese India where the greater part
of the Bengal slaves they hold are captured in this way.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 119}</p>
<p>On the 19th of April we left this island on the route to the south west, and
<b>on the 21st we found an island which the natives call Chiquipia</b>, we
approached it and Indians came at once in their boats and invited us to go
ashore, and gave us two of their loin cloths with which they cover their
private parts, they are red and white and made of the bark of certain trees and
appear to be woven like lace stockings. The island has the shape of a crescent
with a large islet in the middle wherein is a good harbour, it is in 12&deg;
altitude, the people are like those of Taumaco and it would be about four
leagues round, more or less.</p>
<p>Continuing the route on the same course on the 25th of the said month <b>we
discovered land in the morning, we went to it and arrived late, it is a lofty
volcano which had already consumed the fire of the sulphur, and on account of
the many reefs and shoals around we did not anchor. We saw the villages and
people and well cultivated country. It would be three leagues in circumference,
is in altitude 13&frac12;&deg; and because we discovered it on Saint Mark's day
we gave it that name.</b></p>
<p>Sailing on the said course we reached another island which we reckoned to be
about twelve leagues in circumference, in shape almost square, very fresh with
pretty groves and streams running into the sea, we coasted it as far as time
allowed us and anchored in a pretty harbour where we stayed a night and a day;
the boats went to land and the Indians wanted to fight, and it happened to them
as to the others; they have poisoned arrows and are dusky people. <b>We took in
wood and water and left to seek another larger island; they gave it the name of
Santa Marina, it is in 14&deg; S.</b> altitude. According to the account given
by a Franciscan Father who was from Cadiz and said he had it from his father,
who was with the Adelantado Avenda&ntilde;o(*) in the first discovery which he
made of the Solomon Islands, having compared the altitude and from the courses
on which he came and the signs of the land, these are the so called Solomon
Islands for there are no others in this region.</p>
<blockquote>[* <i>Sic</i> = Menda&ntilde;a.]</blockquote>
<p class="page">{Page 121}</p>
<p>On the 29th of April we set sail and directed our course to the west and
struggled hard to reach this island as the wind was almost dead against us,
after a tack or two we reached on the first of May, the day of the Apostles S.
Philip and S. James, the point of a fine bay which would be about sixteen
leagues in circumference. Our ship the Almiranta entered it and approaching the
shore they kept sounding to find bottom and coasting towards the south for
about five leagues we found 20 fathoms in a small creek, with excellent fresh
water from springs and rills, and trees for wood; and, having anchored, the
launch went to report to Captain Quiros what we had found, for he was lying to
with the ship and not venturing to approach the shore; at the good news he came
to anchor in the said spot, and next morning we went to the land with our arms,
but did not go ashore on account of the numbers of Indians lurking among those
trees. <b>To this harbour or anchorage he gave the name of Vera Cruz</b>, from
having anchored in it on that day. Earlier next day we approached the land at a
more open part and went ashore; the Indians came at once with great shouting
and attacked us, and paid for their rashness, for about ten were left dead on
that ground; they are black and very ugly with their nostrils pierced sideways
and white bones put through them as big and long as the little finger; they
cover their private parts with a black loin cloth; they have poisoned arrows
which on drawing blood kill in less than twenty-four hours. The said Quiros
heard of the death of these and took it very ill, for he wished that they
should not kill any of them, as he gave to be understood in very peevish words.
He was answered that it was done because with such savages it is impossible to
use politeness, and in order that another time they should not be so rude to
Spaniards, to whom all the nations of the world pay respect, and if not they
compel them, even with regret. He could not swallow it, being a Portuguese.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 123}</p>
<p>On the approach of Whitsuntide he ordered an excellent bower of branches to
be erected on shore in front of the ships, and therein they said masses during
the days of the festival, and they celebrated those of Corpus Christi with
dances in Portuguese fashion and the artillery and arquebuses were fired, and
when they were ended they all went to the shade of the trees and ate what they
had, and when they had finished he called the Father Commissary of the Friars
and Pedro Bernal and Sojo his friend and told them privately what he wished to
do, which was the institution of the order of knighthood of the Holy Ghost,
which is the blue robe like that of the order of Montesa; he first called his
nephew and gave him the grand cross, which was of blue taffety; then Luis Baes
and Don Diego de Prado and Pedro Bernal; then he summoned the rest and gave
them robes down to the black drummer, that they might put them on their breasts
at once, which they did with the obligation that they were to defend the
Indians from their enemies and from the others who might wish to injure them,
and other absurdities which I omit to avoid tiresomeness; <b>I will only say
this as it is serious, namely that he resolved to build on the side of the
river a city to which the name of the New Jerusalem was to be given</b>; its
gates were to be of marble and he pointed out that it was to be got from a
white spot that was in a clay pit about two leagues off. And the great church
was to be of that marble and was to be such as to rival that of Saint Peter at
Rome, and the fences of the city and houses also were to be of that marble, for
he understood that that land had more than two thousand leagues of coast and
was thickly populated, and he was going to write to his Majesty to send him
three thousand friars to plant the holy catholic faith therein; and other
things very tedious to relate.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 125}</p>
<p>And having rested a little he appointed the officials both royal and
municipal; Luis Baes de Torres, Camp Master General; Juan(*) de Sojo,
Superintendent of Mines and Sergeant Major General, a new office in the
militia; Don Juan de la Pena, Factor and Overseer; the Chief Pilot, Treasurer;
Don Diego de Prado, Guardian and Trustee; and Juan Seraon, a Portuguese, Chief
Magistrate of Mines; Gaspar de Gaya, Ordinary Magistrate of the city and Don
Alonso de Soto, Chief Magistrate of the Gentry. It was all wind, both walls and
foundation, for he thought to cover up thus what he had promised on the way and
was mistaken. After all this was over I said to him before his friends, Sir
Commander or General you should well remember what was said about you when you
promised on the way that if God would give you but two Indians discovered you
would reckon yourself the most fortunate of all those who had gone forth from
Spain, for you would give us so much gold and silver that we could not carry
it, and the pearls should be measured by hatfuls; God has given you Indians,
not only two but thousands, as in the islands of San Guillermo, Las Palmas,
Taumaco, Chiquipia, San Marcos, Santa Marina, <b>and now this of Ireney which
you call the great Australia of the Holy Spirit</b>. We have only found the
black devils with poisoned arrows; what has become of the riches? We quite
understand that all your affairs are imaginary and as such have gone off in
wind; consider that you have not promised this to Indians but to Spaniards, and
that there are some who used to ask for alms in the hills of Ronda with their
gun in their hands; of those from the mud of Lisbon I say nothing for they are
just the same; look out for yourself for they will execute what they have
thought of when it is least expected.</p>
<blockquote>[* ? Error for Pedro.]</blockquote>
<p>He was angry at this but could make no reply; he ordered the assembly to be
sounded and said that he would take possession of all the land for his Majesty;
and all the men standing to arms they raised the standards, and uncovering his
head he spoke the following words "Be witnesses to me heaven and earth and sea
with all the elements and animals, birds and beasts, and you loyal vassals of
the King our lord, that I take possession of all this country discovered and to
be discovered in the name of His Holiness the Pope, and of King Don Philip our
lord, and of Saint Francis of Assisi and of Anton Martin de la Capacha and of
the successors to the royal crown of Castile".</p>
<p class="page">{Page 127}</p>
<p>I said to him in a loud voice "of the King our lord and of his predecessors
and not of others"; he answered "I know what I am doing". Among the others the
same reply was given to him. From here the men marched in order to a little
wood which was close by, the said Quiros placed himself in the middle and
finding some wild oranges he had some branches cut down saying they were to
make crosses to send to His Holiness the Roman Pontiff, and turned to go to the
shore and ordered that all the men should embark and go on board. At the
beginning of the month of June the boats went to catch pargos and they brought
back loads of fine fish which Messieurs the Magistrates distributed, taking two
parts to the capitana and the other to the almiranta and launch. <b>There was
in the almiranta an honest sailor called Saabedra, very experienced in the
coast of Havannah and New Spain, who said to Luis Baes and to me "Notice,
Gentlemen, that much of this fish is jaundiced, namely that which has black
teeth, and it is pure poison, do not eat it but throw it into the sea and only
eat that which has white teeth"; this was done and having cleaned out some of
those with black teeth they were eaten by two cats and two young pigs and they
all died within two days</b>. They gave this advice at once to the people of
the Capitana, but they called us gluttons, as if we wanted them for ourselves.
They all supped early and at midnight the boat came with the sergeant-major to
ask that the Fathers and the surgeon might go to the Capitana, for all the men
were prostrate on the upper deck, asking for confession because they were
dying. They went and did their duty and the surgeon took a jar of oil and gave
it to the sick to drink and they vomited the food. The remedy was opportune for
if they had delayed it would have done the same as to the cats and pigs; this
poison closes the ducts of the feces and urine and at once produces dementia,
and there were some who did not come to themselves for more than a
fortnight.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 129}</p>
<p>The said Quiros was so timid and nervous about this, that, although nothing
happened to him, as he did not eat of it, he resolved to leave that spot; after
the people recovered he started on the seventh of June to seek an island which
seemed to be near, but in two days he could not reach it as the east wind was
against him, so he decided to return to the place he had left; he veered and on
the eleventh reached the middle of the bay, and in the afternoon we wished him
a good voyage, and they took the watchword, and he ordered us to go to anchor
in the port of Vera Cruz from which we had set sail, and at seven in the
evening a fresh south wind came up and as we were near land compelled us to
lower the sails as we could not find anchorage, we only left the foresail in
order to go on lying to from one tack to another, at nine we made signal with a
torch and they replied, at twelve we repeated it and they did not reply, at one
we made it with two torches alight on the topmast and they did not reply; at
dawn we went to the harbour with the launch and anchored and the wind sank so
that we no longer perceived it. Seeing that the capitana did not appear they
suspected that it had become a wreck; I told them that they need not search,
for the crew had determined to mutiny if they saw an opportunity, the wind had
invited them and they had mutinied. How it happened and the manner of it we
knew two months after our arrival at the Philippines(*), because the capitana
came from New Spain and in it some sailors who were at the festival and told us
how it happened, as will be related in due time further on(**); seeing then
that the capitana did not appear Luis Baes de Torres went in the boat, well
equipped, along the coast of the bay to the north and the launch along the
other coast, hugging the land because if the vessel had made shipwreck they
would find plenty of pieces of planks along the coast, and if they found
nothing it would be certain that they had mutinied.</p>
<blockquote>[* Cf. p. 193.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** Cf. p. 195.]</blockquote>
<p class="page">{Page 131}</p>
<p>They found nothing, and went up to the top of the headlands which were
fairly high and saw nothing. We called a council about what we were to do
because the provisions were diminishing daily; they settled to wait until the
twentieth of the month and if it did not appear we would take another decision.
During this time there were two very great tremblings in the earth and in the
sea; they said that it threatened the coming of winter. The term(*) having
passed and seeing that we were losing time we called a second council and it
was decided that we should set sail from that place to seek a part where we
might obtain provisions and be able to winter. That day we made an incursion on
shore to look for some pigs to eat, and it was very unfortunate to us for so
many negroes came down upon us that with difficulty we got away from them, they
wounded four men with poisoned arrows, but they had reason to lament; among
those whom our people killed there was one they wounded in the mouth and in
trying their swords on him however many cuts and stabs they gave him they could
not cut his flesh, it was as though they struck a stout cuirass: he bore on his
arm a band of four fingers broad edged with snail shells, which must have been
the insignia of the captain or the charm that the swords might not cut. He was
entrusted to a sailor and was forgotten on shore; directly we were embarked and
in the open they came and put him on their shoulders and carried him off.
<b>And on the 26th we took in wood and water and set sail the following day
from the place, and as the wind was east, which is the levant wind, we went
directing our course to the west. This island, called the Australia of the Holy
Spirit, is in altitude 15&frac12;&deg;.</b></p>
<blockquote>[* i.e. 20th.]</blockquote>
<p class="page">{Page 133}</p>
<p>On the 25th, S. John's Day, Luis Baes again summoned a council and produced
a closed and sealed paper, and said it was from the Viceroy of Peru; in
substance it contained and said that in case any of the ships should go astray
they should make every effort to go up to 20&deg; of S. altitude and see if
there was any land in that region, and not finding it should go to the city of
Manila and wait there for four months for the other ships, as they also carried
the same orders; and in case Pedro Fernandez de Quiros should fail they were to
take Captain Don Diego de Prado for chief in order that he might direct that
voyage, and further on it said that after provisioning the ships in the said
Manila his Majesty ordered that they were to go to the Molucca islands and
thence to the Cape of Good Hope and to Spain, carefully noting that route and
putting it on a chart, in order to give an account of it all to his Majesty.
The said Don Diego accepted the charge as committed to him, and thenceforth
executed his office, and we went round the island as much as the east wind
permitted us and found that the opinion of Pedro Fernandez de Quiros was wrong,
for it would be about 30 leagues in circumference, and we turned our course for
greater altitude. (I do not want to pass on before mentioning the remedy we
took for the men who were wounded, which it is good should be known. Some
experienced men from Portuguese India said that as the wounded men complained
so much directly they were wounded there was no doubt that they would die
speedily unless they were aided with Chinese confection, which is human
excrement diluted with water, an ounce and a half to the dose; this was done at
once and they drank and vomited that poison and rapidly recovered. Among the
wounded there was a Portuguese who would never drink it, and he died when once
it seized him, and his wound was the smallest of all. The Chinese do this in
such cases; it is a secret unknown amongst our people(*).)</p>
<blockquote>[* This account is an insertion and is marked as such by the

<p class="page">{Page 135}</p>
<p>And directing our route to south west until we reached 20&frac12;&deg; of
altitude, we there found pleasant coolness, the sign of land in the vicinity,
and in parts many birds on trunks of trees. Our provisions did not permit us to
investigate it, and having carried out the order, we turned to the north,
commending ourselves most sincerely to God and to his most holy mother: and
although the wind was south east and not much in our favour <b>the Lord God was
pleased that at daybreak on the fourteenth of July we should find land, very
high, and the coast running very far both ways; and had the dawn been half an
hour later we should doubtless have gone on the shoals, where we should have
perished.</b> We drew out and crowded sail to go eastwards, with sunrise the
wind blew a stiff breeze so that it was necessary to submit and to go along the
coast, from which arose great smoke signals from all the villages of the
Indians, a practice much in use among them when they see ships in their seas.
We continued coasting for five days and in the afternoon at 5 o'clock we stood
out to sea and at sunrise we returned to the coast, and during all this time we
found no mouth by which to enter the land. It is so full of shoals that they
come out more than two leagues into the sea, and on the sixth day we saw some
lofty islets like sugar loaves and they reckoned that there would be an opening
there, and it was so; we sent the boat and it sounded with the lead and found
from 8 to 10 fathoms of water with clean bottom, we steered the ships thither
and reached the shore where we found a fine harbour of fourteen fathoms of
water on clean ground, and as we anchored Indians came to the shore; it is a
land of large handsome trees, good springs of water and above all very
sheltered from all winds. I gave it the name of port Lerma. <b>The beginning of
the land is in 12&deg; of altitude and this port is in 10&frac12;&deg;.</b></p>
<p>The next day we went ashore in pursuit of some Indians and came to a house
of rushes where there were many fishing nets and four cocoanut palms; the
Indians ran off up a hill and by following them we found some enclosures of
rushes with plenty of yams and potatoes which was a good refreshment; and from
there the sea appeared to be close on the other side.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 137}</p>
<p>The next day we put sixteen men in our boat and four in that of the launch,
and coasting along the west side, which is where we descried that bit of sea
from the hut, the Indians made signs that we should go thither. We stood out to
sea and at a third of a league from that spot there came from the mouth of a
harbour six canoes of twenty paddles a side with great cries and shouting and
with many banners and streamers, set in battle array. We went towards them and
being within gunshot we fired at them with our muskets and the bullets struck
in the midst of the said canoes; so seeing how far our arms reached they held a
council, and in a short time returned to the place they started from. The wind
came fresh in our favour and we hoisted sail in pursuit, and at the entrance of
the mouth they were awaiting us on shore well armed with round shields, clubs
and wooden swords. The mouth was about two hundred feet wide and on reaching
them we saluted them with our arquebuses and killed some, and when any fell
dead they gave them blows with their clubs to make them get up, thinking that
they were not dead; just then a bullet struck a shield and passed through it
and also through the Indian's body and he fell dead. This frightened them so
much that they abandoned the place, and more than three hundred came down from
the direction where they made signs we should go on shore, and they spoke with
the others and put the dead on their shoulders and went away silently; we
entered the mouth and took two canoes without crew. We surveyed the harbour,
and there were two opposite to one another; that on the east side is very
sheltered and could take three hundred ships of deep draught, that of the west
is smaller, with clean bottom.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 139}</p>
<p>We went to the point which the larger harbour makes towards the north with
three islets, where there is a large mouth which leads to a bay enclosed like a
lake, which would be more than thirty leagues in circumference, and the ebb and
flow of the waters of this bay and harbours all passes through the mouth which
we entered to the said harbours, and at the said point there was a village of
Indians, who through fear had abandoned it, with many trees full of cassia, and
two very large enclosed yards where they keep turtles or tortoises to eat. <b>I
gave the bay the name of San Milian</b>(*); here we saw numbers of parrots,
some very white with a crest of yellow feathers and the beak and feet black;
there are other larger ones of purple colour with yellow and red patches on the
body and green, yellow and red wing the beak and feet red; there are others
entirely</p>
<p>bright red(**), wonderfully beautiful; we saw some magpies with red feet and
bill, they are very black and larger than those of Castile, and their
chattering is like the human voice.</p>
<blockquote>[* <i>Vide</i> Map II.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** Tanagers (?).]</blockquote>
<p>After we had anchored for three days in the harbour, one day at dawn they
persisted in chattering thus, ay, ay, ay, aya, yaya, yaya, ay, so that I
thought they were Indians in ambush who were waiting for us, I caused the men
to be roused so as to be on the watch and in a few minutes these magpies came
out of the wood flying and chattering in the same way, which amused us for some
time. We also saw a very large field of ginger which God alone cultivates for
the natives do not know what it is; <b>here we killed an animal which is in the
shape of a dog smaller than a greyhound, with a bare and scaly tail like that
of the snake, and his testicles hang from a nerve like a thin cord; they say
that it was the castor, we ate it and it was like venison, its stomach was full
of ginger leaves and for that reason we ate it.</b> In all the parts we
traversed of these harbours and bay they made many smoke signals on land, which
is a sign that there were many villages therein. On the way back from these
harbours and bay we had one very bad time, for when coming out of the mouth the
tide was running out and with such force that there is no river current that
could be compared with it, for it raised waves more than three times a man's
height, so that we were obliged to get out and leave in the boat one man at the
helm and two at the oars, and fix a long rope to it which we pulled to prevent
the current carrying it away.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 141}</p>
<p>In this way we moved out with great difficulty until we got clear of the
current and then we got in a good way beyond the mouth. The same thing was done
with the canoe of the launch, and I assert that there is not a galley on the
sea, however strong, that can break through such a current, so formidable and
strong is it. At the distance of two leagues from the port of Lerma, there are
three islands and in the largest, which was two leagues in circumference, we
saw fires every night; we went to it with all the boats and the launch; the
Indians abandoned their position and went in boats to another: it has a neat
village of rush houses, very well made, with divisions. We found in them
numbers of well-made fishing nets and very large pearl shells, some hatchets
for chopping wood made of touchstone, fixed into handles. The island is well
cultivated with plenty of fruit trees, they drink water from a large, well-made
cistern as they do not know how to sink wells; we found small dumb dogs that
neither bark nor howl, and do not cry out even if beaten with sticks. The best
we found, and of which we were very glad, were nine very fine pigs, we killed
half and took away the rest alive, a most excellent provision. <b>I gave the
island the name of San Facundo(*) because it gave us such good help for several
days.</b></p>
<blockquote>[* <i>Vide</i> Map II. = Saint Abundant.]</blockquote>
<p>From this island up to the first land we discovered there are three nations
of people, namely the Boniguis, the Hunis and the Canaiis, as we were informed
by some Indians we captured in a canoe which came to that island and whom we
set at liberty immediately.</p>
<p>In this harbour we stayed fifteen days and two days before our departure God
provided us with four large fishes which we caught with the hooks used for
sharks, they are white with black spots and are called caellas, it is a
carnivorous fish of fine taste and flavour, with three rows of teeth in its
mouth, each would weigh about twenty five arrobas(*), and large pieces were
preserved with the salt we brought from Peru.</p>
<blockquote>[* From 5 to 6 cwt.]</blockquote>
<p class="page">{Page 143}</p>
<p>And before setting out from this harbour I caused all the men of the ship
and launch to collect together with their arms in their hands, and having set
two sentinels in good posts and the men in the form of a squadron, <b>I took
possession of all the land in the following form; having taken off my hat I
said, Be my witnesses noble and faithful vassals of the King our lord that I,
Don Diego de Prado, his Captain and Commander, do take possession of all this
land discovered and to be discovered in the name of the most invincible and
Catholic King Don Philip the Third our lord, King of the Spains and West and
East Indies, and of his predecessors(*) for ever and ever, amen.</b> And they
all responded three times in a loud voice, with heads uncovered, Long live the
King our lord, and I forthwith asked the notary of the ship for an attestation
and a royal salvo was fired with the artillery and arquebuses, and in the
evening there were illuminations and a Salve Regina was sung, giving thanks to
our Lord and to his blessed Mother for the favours received and praying him to
grant us a good voyage and every good success in that expedition to his honour
and glory, amen.</p>
<blockquote>[* <i>Sic</i>, quite correct. The usual Spanish formula. Cf. pp.
125, 155.]</blockquote>
<p>We set sail from this harbour coasting the land and taking our course to the
west, and because there are many shallows we determined to proceed by daylight
with a look-out in the bow-sprit, and at five in the afternoon to anchor in a
suitable spot; so following the coast <b>we anchored on the 12th of August at
an island in the shape of a razor, with fine and clear bottom and good shelter,
and as it was Saint Clara's day I gave it her name(*)</b>. We went ashore next
day and found an excellent village with numbers of very large sweet basils, and
some orange trees and other fruit trees; we captured some Indians in a canoe
who were ransomed for a fine big pig which others brought.</p>
<blockquote>[* Island of S. Clara. <i>vide</i> Map III.]</blockquote>
<p class="page">{Page 145}</p>
<p>On the day of the Assumption of Our Lady(*) we went ashore in the boats
towards a big river which runs from a corner towards the north, and near its
mouth we found a large village of well-disposed people, tall and white, and
though they saw us approaching they were not frightened, but waited for us and
saluted us after their fashion, raising both hands to heaven, like one who
gives thanks to God, and then sat down on the ground; we responded in like
manner and sat down. They continued looking at us as at people they had never
seen, and in a short time one of them, who must have been one of their chiefs,
rose up and asked us by signs what we wanted. He was answered by putting the
hand in the mouth, which is the sign for asking for water to drink. He at once
went to a good-sized house and brought a cane tube full of water, which would
hold about three azumbres(**) and our people drank; these are the vessels in
use throughout this country, tubes of very thick and large canes. Having
replaced the tube in the house he again asked by signs what we wanted further;
he was answered by blowing with the mouth as one blows a firebrand and he
brought it to him alight. Just then a very big pig, white with black spots like
those of pasture land, came across among the men, and a soldier asked him by
signs to give it to him, and he answered contemptuously that he might take it;
he put the match to his arquebuse and shot the pig below its ear and
straightway it fell dead. This caused them great astonishment. The said Indian
who had brought the water rose up and asked him for the arquebuse, and went
about twenty paces to a sty with a pig, which for sheer fatness could not move;
he pointed the arquebuse at it and with his mouth said "pu" with great force,
thinking that the soldier had killed the other in that fashion; and seeing that
he had not killed it he aimed at it again and raised his voice still more
saying puu, with the same result.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 147}</p>
<p>All the Indians, some fifty, who were awaiting the event, seeing that he had
not killed the pig began to roar with laughter so that it was a sight to see
the fun they made of it after their fashion. The Indian came back very much
ashamed, with his arquebuse so that he could hardly walk, and gave it back to
the soldier, who turned the other way and recharged it and asked the Indian by
signs that he should give him the pig, and he replied by signs that he might
take it; the soldier went to the sty and killed it, then the laughter was still
greater like men making fun of their companion.</p>
<blockquote>[* = August 15.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** = 3 half gallons.]</blockquote>
<p>While they were amusing themselves thus I caused both pigs to be taken to
the boat. I presented him with a Milanese bell hung from a silk ribbon, and
rang it for him before them all, which he highly esteemed; <b>and he in return
gave a bird larger than a swan of dark grey colour, with a sharp beak, that had
neither tongue nor wings, and in their place it had on each side five points
like porcupine quills black and white</b>; it ate pebbles, iron tarpauling
nails, pieces of linen and paper and when it drank sea-water it got drunk, and
then it was a sight to see the leaps and springs it made in the ship. At
Ternate I gave it to the Camp Master Juan de Esquibel, who valued it greatly.
There was plenty of wild fowl, larger than ours, of dark purple colour with
white spots, which live in the trees, and highly coloured pheasants, of which
there is abundance throughout this country, and numbers of peacocks. The
ordinary fruits are plantains, cocoanut palms, bread fruits of the size of a
large melon, durions and bifasas, a fruit as large as a quince, the rind of
which is covered with points like those of diamonds; the flesh is like puff
pastry very white and palatable. At nightfall we went to the ship intending to
come back again to the village, but at midnight it began to pour and continued
for a day and a half; the flow of the river was such that we were obliged to
move to another spot more than a league lower down, and left it as we could do
no more.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 149}</p>
<p><b>There are in this country some trees which in the New Kingdom of Granada
are called papayos, of the size of a cultivated pine, with grey bark; at the
beginning of spring they shed their leaves and the flower comes out, which is
like that of the lily and of pink colour; it comes out at sunrise and falls off
at dusk, so that it blooms afresh and the flowers of the said shape fall off
daily; and all day long it gives out a delightful scent and fragrance</b> to
praise the Lord God who is so wonderful in his works; and at the beginning of
winter the leaf comes forth, but it does not blossom until the summer. From
this village towards the west a plain begins which would be about twenty
leagues long and five wide, thickly inhabited and cultivated and full of the
fruit trees I have mentioned, with numerous brooks of good water which run to
the sea, at the end of that plain <i>five hills rise which appear to be one on
top of the other, so that the two hinder ones touch and are covered with mist
at sunrise and are not seen until sunset or at dawn; in my opinion they are
higher than Mongibelo(*) in Sicily or the range of Santa Marta(**), they arc
some of the highest mountains I have seen in the West or East Indies</i>; there
is no doubt whatever that they contain many mines of rich metals, as they are
at the altitude and parallel of the part of Peru which has the best mines of
gold. The quantity of cocoanut palms there is in this plain at the seashore is
very great, and where there are these trees they cannot suffer hunger. We
landed on this plain and loaded the boats three times with cocoanuts; and the
Indians came out to protect them, but they knew what arquebuses were and how
far they kill with the bullets. A negro belonging to the pilot
Fontidue&ntilde;a came ashore with us and taking a shield and a sword went
towards the Indians, and when he got near they ran off, more than three hundred
of them; we were astonished, but afterwards learned from the Indians we took
from the Island of San Bartolome(***) that there were near that part some
negroes who eat human flesh, and that they came in those parts, and killed the
Indians they caught and lighted a fire and roasted and ate them in sight of the
others, and consequently all those in those regions fled from them, and
thinking that this negro was one of the cannibals they fled in like manner.</p>

<p class="page">{Page 151}</p>
<p><b>From here we went along the coast as far as it was clear of shoals until
we reached them, when standing out we proceeded towards some islands which
appeared to the west; we reached them on S. Bartholomew's Day(*); the first is
uninhabited but very full of cocoanut palms, we went to the other which is
thickly populated, and to which we gave the name of the holy apostle(**); in
their language it is called the Ratiles [= Railes]</b>. We anchored quite close
to the shore owing to the safety of the harbour, and on the following morning
we landed and found more than a hundred Indians in ambush in a copse which was
near the water, and as they were discovered they went to seek the others who
were guarding the pass we had to go through to the village; it was about twelve
feet wide, on the one side, that is towards the sea, it had a great precipitous
rock and on the other the high hill, also precipitous; on coming within gunshot
we made them signs of peace after their manner. They responded by brandishing
their arms, namely lances and shields, which was a sign of battle;
notwithstanding this we again made signs of peace and they replied with shouts
brandishing their arms. Seeing that we were losing time by treating them with
further consideration we knelt down and saying a Pater Noster and an Ave Maria,
Cierra Espa&ntilde;a(***), we gave them a Santiago(****), and in that skirmish
some fell dead, and we seized their gate and pressed on, shooting them as they
fled; in order to flee more lightly they threw away their shields and lances
and on reaching the village they embarked in twenty-six boats, flying to the
great land of the Railes, and after embarking some were killed on the open sea,
and this caused them greater fright and terror, on seeing that they killed them
so far from land.</p>

<p class="page">{Page 153}</p>
<p>The village had about three hundred houses very well enclosed by planks and
big canes. They had withdrawn their women, children and old men and put them on
top of a cliff precipitous on three sides, with only a very difficult ascent on
the one at the end of the village, and on the sides it was cut off by the sea,
so that for our people to get to the ascent we had to pass below this fortress.
We made the signs to them that they should come down and they replied with
showers of stones, we passed with difficulty up to the ascent, and the Chief
Pilot(*) and a valiant Galician asked permission to go with their swords and
shields up the cliff; they were allowed, and half way up there fell upon them
such showers of stones that they came tumbling headlong to the bottom, without
shields or hats, and came to us. The Indians raised a great shout in sign of
joy but it lasted only a short time, for twenty shooters and others with
shields came up at once and made slaughter; the living and the wounded came
down, they would be about three hundred, three parts were women and I was sorry
to see so many dead children they were carrying in their arms. I selected
fourteen boys and girls of from six to ten years and sent them on board; the
rest I let go free and they ran up a hill like goats. We found a girl of about
fourteen years old with the most lovely face and eyes that could be imagined;
her whole body painted with stripes like a Milanese corselet and her private
parts covered with a red apron reaching to her knee, made of the bark of trees.
There were disputes about who was to take her to the ship, so considering that
some might fall away with her and offend God I delivered her up to a good old
woman of her own people; she thanked me greatly in her manner and wanted to go
off with the rest, which she did forthwith.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 155}</p>
<p>They sacked the fortress and found a quantity of cocoanuts and mats on which
they sleep, and fishing nets and very large pearl shells; the pearls because
they are round and have no handles they throw into the sea. This island is very
cultivated and full of the ordinary fruits I have mentioned; it would be four
leagues in circumference and is in 8&frac12;&deg; altitude. All those we
carried off were baptised in Manila to the honour and glory of God. The Fathers
taught them the prayers of the Pater Noster, Ave Maria, Credo and Salve Regina,
and the commandments and the articles of the catholic faith. These Indians
worship the sun which they call Nina and the moon Puri.</p>
<blockquote>[* Juan Ochoa de Vilbao.]</blockquote>
<p>In this island I took possession of all the country in the name of his
Majesty the King our lord in the manner aforesaid(*); and to the great land I
gave the name of the Magna Margarita because it was discovered in the time of
Queen Margaret our lady, for as she was great in her doings so is this land in
the circumference that can be imagined. These Indians have abundance of yams,
which are roots they sow like potatoes, as large as Cordovan olive tubs; they
are extremely good cooked in a pot with meat; plenty of sweet canes of which
they make sugar; sweet basils as big as a man which serve them for food; and
wild amaranths, green, yellow and red. We found numbers of very big pearl
shells(**) and learned afterwards from the Indians we carried off that they
throw the pearls into the sea because they are round and have no handles to
hang them by, and that they are sometimes as big as filberts. They worship the
sun which they call Nina and the moon Puri(**); they also worship the buffaloes
so that they may not harm them. Opposite these islands is the province of the
Railes, we did not reach it on account of the many shoals there are around. The
Indians who fled from the island of San Bartolome went thither and gave the
news that some men had reached their country who made fire by their mouths and
killed whomsoever they wished, and thinking we would go there they embarked in
more than forty boats and went to another part; we saw them pass out to sea
behind the said shoals. This we learned from some Indians we captured in a
canoe, who explained it to us by signs and said that that village of the Railes
is large, and we set them at liberty at once.</p>
<blockquote>[* <i>Supra</i>, p. 143.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** Repetition, <i>vide supra</i>.]</blockquote>
<p class="page">{Page 157}</p>
<p>On the 28th we set sail from these islands steering to the west, and finding
a mouth among the shoals we entered it, as the bottom was clear among the
shoals and the land high, with from seven to eight fathoms of water, and even
if there is a storm in the sea it does not come in here. So we went coasting
along until <b>we reached an island where we found good bottom and anchored. It
would be about a league and a half in circumference, they gave it the name of
San Juan Bautista; it is in 8&frac12;&deg; altitude; from here begins the
province of the Helabons.</b></p>
<p>On the 2nd of September we set sail from this island still following the
coast and anchored near a red island without brushwood or anything green, and
found a boat with women who were fishing with nets, and at dawn there came a
storm of wind which broke our cable and we lost an anchor. We ran without sails
until it ceased and continuing our route we entered a fine "pracel"(*) of six
or seven fathoms of water and went to anchor beneath a very lofty headland and
point which formed a fine bay. The next day desiring to follow the said route
we saw a great reef of rocks which ran towards the south with little depth so
that we were obliged to take another route until we found more water, but it
did not last long so that we again changed our course and made for an island
that would be about two leagues in circumference, here we went along with the
boat ahead sounding the bottom as it was very foul and full of shoals; we made
our way with difficulty and found a good depth. <b>We gave it the name of the
island of Malandanza(**), it is in 9&deg; and inhabited by tawny
people.</b></p>
<blockquote>[* Clean sandy ground, without stones]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** = Ill-going.]</blockquote>
<p class="page">{Page 159}</p>
<p>From it we went towards another island of the same size and anchored nearer
to the land, and all night the dogs were howling, which caused terror. In the
morning we went ashore and to the village, which was abandoned, and we found a
quantity of turtle of the sort greatly valued by the East Indians and worth in
Malacca as much as three hundred ducats a cwt., and a quantity of masks made of
the said turtle, very well finished, and a fish called albacora(*) imitated so
naturally that it seemed to be the very thing, and a half man-half fish of a
yard(**) and a half high, also made as a good sculptor might have finished it.
The soldiers killed a good-sized dog, the flesh of which was better than that
of venison, and it filled many with so much longing that they went in search of
the others, which got away more than half a league from us through some shoals
until we lost sight of them. When searching the island we met with a number of
women with two men who were guarding them very well disposed, and one of the
men climbed up a high tree and left a bow and arrows on the ground, and however
many signs they made to him he would not come down; they shot at him with the
arrows and he caught them all in his hand, an extraordinary thing. At last they
let off an arquebuse at him and he fell lifeless. We selected three of the
youngest women and put them on board for the service of the crew of the ship;
<b>they gave the island the name of Isla de los Perros(***); the inhabitants of
this as of others live on the turtle flesh, it is in 10&deg; altitude.</b></p>
<blockquote>[* = Small striped tunny.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** = 33"; <i>Vara</i> = 33".]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[*** = Isle of Dogs.]</blockquote>
<p class="page">{Page 161}</p>
<p>From this island we went on sounding in search of another among the same
shoals, with hard work; we anchored near shore as the bottom was clean. Two
ballasted canoes came out and up to our ship, with four very tall men in each;
afterwards they went to the launch and examined it at their pleasure, and it
seemed to them suitable for their service; they went ashore and fetched their
arms and came down upon it and attacked it, but being on the alert we fired
some musket shots at them and one was killed, the rest abandoned the canoes and
dived below the water and we saw them no more; <b>the dead one was a youth
without down on his lip, his foot was more than a span and a half long, and his
body twelve spans and a half in height;</b> their arms are very strong bows
which we could not bend and clubs of touchstone, with a handle in the middle as
thick as the wrist, 3 feet nine inches long(*), and about forty pounds in
weight, and in my opinion there is no helmet arquebuse-proof that could resist
the blow. We went ashore and found the village with numbers of skulls and bones
of men they had eaten; these are the negroes that they told us the Indians had
fled from when they saw our negro: they are not negroes as was ascertained from
the one they killed, but they stain themselves to appear more fierce. Those who
were in the village went to other islands when they saw us disembark. From this
island, which is lofty, we counted forty, all situated among the shoals. From
this we went to another small one, very fresh with abundance of trees; the
inhabitants had abandoned it; we tried again to go to the great land, but the
shoals were so large that we could not get across.</p>
<blockquote>[* = 5 cuartas= 5 x 9 inches.]</blockquote>
<p><b>On the 22nd of September there was another eclipse of the moon</b>, as
great as that of March(*), of the same colour, but it lasted an hour longer and
on the next night there came such a great wind and tempest while we were
anchored that it seemed as if all the elements had conspired against us; so
that at midnight we all made confession and prepared to die; of the two cables
with which we were anchored one broke, but in commending ourselves very truly
to Jesus Maria Joseph, Jesus was pleased to have mercy on us. So great was the
water and sand that entered along the bowsprit that the upper deck of the ship
was half blocked up. At dawn the storm ceased and the sea became as calm as if
there had never been anything. With the capstan we weighed the anchor and with
it came up the rope of the buoy of the other. In short we saw clearly the
favour that S. Joseph had obtained from the child Jesus. Hereupon we proceeded
to anchor in a safer spot.</p>
<blockquote>[* <i>Vide</i> p. 107.]</blockquote>
<p class="page">{Page 163}</p>
<p>Seeing that we could not get clear of these shoals we took counsel as to
what was to be done, and <b>decided not to weigh anchor until low water and to
go with the foresail only to direct the ship, because the waves would carry the
ships through the trough of the water, and to anchor at the flow of the tide.
The opinion was as if it had come from heaven, for in this way we secured the
ships and our lives.</b> Proceeding thus at the end of three days we reached a
flat island with good bottom where we anchored and found plenty of very large
pigeons all white and trees of plums they call of Nicaragua, they have big
stones and little flesh. <b>The whole island was full of pumice stone and seems
to have had a volcano in former times; they gave it the name of Isla de vulcan
quemado(*); it would be a league and a half in circumference.</b></p>
<blockquote>[* = Island of Extinct Volcano.]</blockquote>
<p>From this we went towards others and <b>reached the largest, which greatly
resembled the hill of Our Lady of Monserrate(*)</b>, and anchored there as it
was a sheltered and safe place. The inhabitants did not appear for they were on
the top of it. It got the name of Monserrate.</p>
<blockquote>[* In Barcelona.]</blockquote>
<p>We set sail from here in search of other islands and at the end of three
days we anchored between two islands to take in water; so great was the number
of flies they call cantharides that it seemed as if they wanted to eat the men
up. The Indians fled to the hills and we got a fine supply of very clear water.
On the following day the contrary currents were so great and so strong that it
was necessary to have two men at the helm to keep the ship's head against the
stream, and this lasted for eight days and nights. <b>It kept the name of Isla
de las cantarides.</b></p>
<p class="page">{Page 165}</p>
<p>After the said currents ceased we proceeded towards two islands of no great
size passing along a very narrow channel which formed some shoals; we did not
reach them for we did not need to; and at the end of two days on the eve of S.
Francis(*) we found other islands towards the north and among them one bigger
than the rest; and at nightfall we anchored in five fathoms at half a league
from the island; and at midnight the ship began to give bumps on the bottom,
which had it not been of clay would have smashed it to pieces, we lightened the
deck and loosed the cable and with this it righted; the launch was nearer to
the island but being a small boat escaped that danger.</p>
<blockquote>[* October 3.]</blockquote>
<p>God was pleased that we should henceforth find more water so that we had not
to wait for the tides; the wind being a strong breeze we went out towards the
north and discovered a lofty cape of the great country, we steered towards it
and saw on anchoring that the coast ran in a different direction and perceived
that there was an end of coasting. We were among these rocks and shoals for 34
days, they run out into the sea as far as we could judge about fifty leagues in
a southern direction. It pleased God that at this cape we got away from the
shoals. <b>They gave it the name Cabo de San Pablo, it is in 8&frac12;&deg;
altitude.</b></p>
<p>From this Cape of S. Paul we bore northwards thinking that we had finished
coasting this great land and for two days we saw the coast of the land very far
away; although we voyaged by night they sounded daily, morning, midday and
evening, and always found from twenty-five to twenty-six fathoms, with bottom
of clay which stuck to the plummet; it was blue and might serve as bright blue
colour for painters; it is a sign of land of rich minerals.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 167}</p>
<p>On the third day a man went up to the topmast to see if he could discover
land; he said that the coast was still visible with very high mountains and
that ahead we had many shoals of yellow and red colour, which are shoals above
the surface. <b>We lowered the sails and with only the low foresail we went
towards them, and the boat went in front sounding and entered among them and
found twenty-six fathoms with the said bottom; it came along-side and reported
that they were eggs of fishes which had spawned in that place, they occupied
about seven leagues of the region;</b> we passed through the middle of them
sounding and finding the same depth and bottom.</p>
<p>We were very pleased at having left the land on the east side, and steering
north after four days we again discovered very high land ahead and on reaching
it, as the sea was clear with good anchorage, we saw many villages and the
coast ran wide on both sides with numbers of rivers which ran into the sea,
with muddy water full of mud banks. We ran before the east wind which blew
fresh, proceeding westwards along the shore and at nightfall we stood out to
sea and were without sails; and in the morning we returned to the coast,
enjoying the delightful sight of so many woods and taking in water in some
places; <b>we discovered an island straight ahead near the land and went to it
and anchored in a good spot</b>; we went ashore and saw that they had houses of
rushes atop of very big trees, woven into the branches of the said trees, and
in them were the women and children and a few men, but however many signs we
made they took no notice of us. We found a very tine sucking pig weighing about
8 arrobas(*) and took it to the boat and to the ship and loaded up a lot of
very large fine oysters and some snails, each about two handfuls, which we ate
for many days and it was excellent food; a big canoe appeared thereabouts but
did not venture near our boat or the ships. The natives wage war upon one
another and the trees with the huts serve them as fortresses. I gave it the
name of Isla de los ostiones(**).</p>
<blockquote>[* 8 x 25 = 200 lb]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** = Island of the oysters.]</blockquote>
<p class="page">{Page 169}</p>
<p>From there we went coasting to the west and entered a very lovely harbour
with an island in the mouth which protects it from all winds. All the high
parts around were very red like the clay at the extremities of Portugal, and
the banks very green and filled with groves which smelt very sweet; they gave
it the name of port of San Juan del Prado(*); we anchored here in order that
the men might rest, as indeed they needed to do.</p>
<blockquote>[* See Map IV.]</blockquote>
<p>Next day we went along the coast and entered a narrow mouth, but suitable
for anchoring, with an island which made it a good harbour, and it was S.
Luke's Day(*) 18 October. At the side it had a good village with houses of
planks; the Indians came to the ship and we gave them biscuits and whatever we
had. This visit was to reconnoitre the ships, for four days afterwards they
came with eight big canoes crowded with warriors, with banners and arrows and
lances to attack us, but it availed them little, for at the first discharge of
the arquebuses they abandoned their canoes and jumped into the water and did
not venture to get into them until they had drawn them clear of that spot and
far from the ships. <b>I gave the harbour the name of San Lucas(**) on account
of having entered it on his day.</b> Every night at seven o'clock a caiman more
than forty feet long came to the ship, a fierce brute that doubtless was
accustomed to be fed at the Indian village and to eat some of them, as it was
punctual in its visit. I do not want to pass over in silence the description of
the manner in which the women in this country give birth. One of the three
women we brought from the Isla de los perros was pregnant, and in this harbour
the birth came on and when her pains began, which was at nightfall, she sat on
the open deck on a cannon and a negress fetched sea-water in a bucket and
poured it over her neck, back and breast with all her strength, this continued
until the strong pains of parturition came on her and then she came below on to
a gun-carriage, and taking sea water and pouring it on her neck and back as
aforesaid she did not stop until the child was born; and immediately afterwards
she took a bowl and filled it with water in which she washed herself and the
child, and threw the after-birth into the sea. And she covered herself with a
cloak which I caused to be given to her and I had her put below deck; she
nursed the child with all this comfort until she reached the Philippines, when
it died; and when she had learned to speak she said that the women of those
regions give birth in that way, for with the dashings of water they do not feel
the pains so much and have more strength to bring forth the children.</p>
<blockquote>[* See Map IV. Cabo de San Lucas.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** See Map IV.]</blockquote>
<p class="page">{Page 171}</p>
<p>On the 27th of October we left this harbour and coasting along we anchored
between some islets so as to be opposite a big island which jutted far out on
the south side; there was a strait between the great land and this island and I
sent the boat to sound the mouth, and it found that <b>on the south side, close
to the island, there was fine clear anchorage, and at rise of tide we entered
and passed easily, without danger, to the island. I gave it the name of
Navaja(*) because it had that shape, and to the strait La Boca de Tovar</b>; it
is in the altitude of the harbour of San Lucas.</p>
<blockquote>[* = Razor.]</blockquote>
<p>Coasting the land we entered, on the 30th of the said month, a very
beautiful bay; all the land, both hills and valleys, was red and looked like
painters' vermilion. Here we captured a canoe with six very dark Indians, some
with thick beards; we released five of them with the canoe and kept a fine big
youth, who after he learned to speak told us in Manila how that in that country
there were plenty of brilliant red stones like those worn by Spaniards in their
finger-rings, and because they did not know how to polish them they made no
account of them; they are either garnets or rubies. This is the country of
those they call Papuas, which begins at the spot where we turned to find it
before the Isla de los ostiones, and ends at the cape of the land. <b>I gave
this bay the name of La Baya(*) Bermeja(**).</b></p>
<blockquote>[* = Bahia.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** Red or Scarlet Bay.]</blockquote>
<p class="page">{Page 173}</p>
<p>From here we went to some lofty islands, seven in number; the largest ones,
where we anchored as it was late, are inhabited by black people with long hair
and beards. <b>We named them Islands of Saint Simon and Jude;</b> they are in
the same altitude. Here we found some shell-fish they call veneras(*), each a
yard(**) and a half long, a yard wide and a third thick; it holds about ten
pounds of meat and weighs about 4 arrobas(***). The Indians use these shells to
make hatchets for cutting wood, clubs for battle, for these Papuas fight with
clubs and round shields, and cane-tubes each a yard long and hollow like a
musket; they put quicklime in powder into them and when they come to close
quarters with their enemies they blow it into their eyes and capture them
blinded with that powder. And of these arms we found a quantity in some
villages and in those of this island.</p>
<blockquote>[* <i>lit</i>. Scallops.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** 33 inches long.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[*** = 4 x 25 =100 lb.]</blockquote>
<p>From here we went to other islands about eighteen leagues off, which are
five in number, where we anchored, they are in 2&frac12;&deg; altitude, <b>we
gave them the name of the Cinco Hermanas</b>(*). In the village we found an
iron harpoon, such as the Chinese use, and hooks and lines from China, and two
onions like ours, and some bellows made of two very large tubes of cane, and
pieces of dishes of china clay, which was a good indication to us to give up
the idea that we were lost, as we thought, and a sign that we were near where
the Chinese trade.</p>
<blockquote>[* = Five Sisters.]</blockquote>
<p>From here we went to nine islands which are about twenty leagues from those
in which there was the quantity of shell fish above mentioned of which we made
good store, they are in 1&frac12;&deg; altitude; here we took in a supply of
excellent water; we gave it the name of the Archipelago.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 175}</p>
<p>We set sail and ran along the coast and leaving the islands on the land side
we rounded them outside until we got back to the said coast and at 22 leagues
from these islands we found two very full of very big trees and among them much
mariac wood; we anchored between them, as the harbour was very good, at 3 in
the afternoon and at 4 a boat with an awning appeared with a man in the middle
clad in red, and coming near he asked in Portuguese what nation it was, he was
answered Portugal, and he said Portuguese do not come here. I caused the flag
to be run up to the top and he came closer and again asked what nation, he was
answered Spain, then he came to us at once and came on hoard and embraced us
and gave us welcome in Portuguese fashion and said Spain, valiant cavaliers
with swords of gold and they display an ardour that is astounding. He asked for
wine and drank three times with pleasant air; after he had rested he said that
Biliato, his lord, who was governor of two villages, had sent him, and if they
were friendly people he was to go on board the ships and ask leave for him to
go to them and take them provisions; if they were not friends he was to return
at once. And having given him the permission and asked him what land it was, he
replied, the end of the country of the low Papuas, and that we were five days
voyage in a carack from the Kingdom of Bachan, where there was a Father of the
Company of Jesus, and that Don Pedro de Acu&ntilde;a, Governor of the
Philippines, had seized the Molucca islands and the King of Ternate and had
carried him of to Manila, and that in his place the Camp Master Juan de
Esquibel, a great cavalier, had remained in Ternate; and he mentioned the names
of many captains, as he had been in the expedition with the Sangax of La Bua,
which is so to speak Count of La Bua, one of the Molucca islands. He also said
that between Bachan and Gilolo there was a strait through which we could go
quickly to Ternate.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 177}</p>
<p>To this the pilot(*) of the ship did not give credit, because in the chart
the island of Gilolo had three branches, and this is false as we found by
experience and will be stated further on. The ambassador returned to his boat
to give the answer to his master. It is impossible to exaggerate the pleasure
we all felt at such good news, and certainly for us he was like an angel, for
we already gave ourselves up for lost, and as in the modern maps they colour
this great land as mainland of the summit of the antarctic pole, we thought it
was so until this man told us where we were. <b>We gave great thanks to God for
such signal favour and gave the islands the name of Islas de las buenas
nuevas(**); they are in two thirds of a degree of altitude.</b></p>
<blockquote>[* Juan Bernardo Fontidue&ntilde;a.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** = Islands of Good News.]</blockquote>
<p>Next day at ten in the morning came the Governor Biliato with a
well-equipped carack and boat with abundant provisions of kids and pheasants,
which are wild fowls with wonderful colouring, and plenty of cocks and hens,
Spanish and native, and numbers of birds of paradise and red parrots and others
purple. With this Governor came a Moor marked on the cheek with the S and the
nail(*), who spoke Italian very well, and told us how they captured him in the
expedition of Don John of Austria when he was a boy and he was sold in Seville
to some merchants of Manila in the Philippines, and that in Manila he and six
others stole a boat and took the following route; from Cabite to Mindoro and to
the island of Panay and to that of the Negroes and to Mindanao and to that of
Sarrangan and to Panguisara and to the Meaos, and to that of Gilolo, to
Bocanora and Sabuga and thence to the Papuas where he now was with the
Governor. I asked him about the conditions of that country and he said it is
very rich in gold, but as it is soft they do not take much account of it, and
that there were many and large pearls, but not knowing how to pierce them they
do not value them, abundance of sandal wood, black pepper and red stones as
large as a thumbnail, but mostly much smaller, and that there was plenty of
pork and many buffaloes, ginger and cocoanut palms and that it was thickly
peopled.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 179}</p>
<p><b>And he gave us two eggs as large as a fist, which were from a bird called
tabon which is the size of a pigeon, and it lays them four spans(**) deep in
the sand, and when it lays them they are like those of a pigeon and they grow
in the sand until the chicks hatch out</b>; and that we should eat them quickly
for one already contained a large chick, almost ready to hatch out, and it was
better than the other which did not yet contain a chick; that we should fry
them in the pan and they did not need oil to fry them. This was done and it is
certainly very dainty food. The ships bartered much food for old shirts and
knives of little use and old shoes; and the Biliato was presented with a piece
of green taffeta and in return he gave a boy of about ten years, very graceful.
We made him a salvo of three discharges of artillery, and thereupon he embarked
in his carack. The Alfaqui(***) also told us that Chinese ships used to come in
those parts to barter gold, but they had not come for three years, and they
also traded for black pepper.</p>
<blockquote>[* = S + <i>clavo</i> = <i>esclavo</i>, i.e. slave.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** = about 12". The "palmo menor" = about 3".]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[*** i.e. the learned Mahometan = the above Moor.]</blockquote>
<p>At the end of three days after anchoring we set sail and coasted until we
reached the cape called by the natives Cape of Popan which makes a strait with
the cape of Gilolo, which would be about ten leagues wide, we did not pass
through it as we did not know the coast, and the pilot Fontidue&ntilde;a said
that the island of Gilolo has three capes or promontories, and that it was not
advisable to go to that which is in the middle, but that we should descend one
degree from the equinoctial in order not to be embayed between the two capes,
and that certain calms would come upon us and we should not get away in a
fortnight; and that we should not believe what the Moor(*) said. This was done
and we went to the island of Banda, mother of the nutmeg. Thus far the east
wind was with us, but the wind turned west and was the cause of our continuing
to lie to on one course and another for the space of eight days between Banda
and the island of Oby without being able to gain a league, because the currents
were contrary and to get forward we turned back so that it was necessary to
anchor at the island of Oby.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 181}</p>
<p>The next day we started with little wind and found a channel which the land
made with other leeward islands; we entered it in search of fresh water and
found a great cave from which ran a very large spring of it; <b>we anchored and
took in water and found a quantity of bats as large as young rabbits, measuring
more than two yards across the wings</b>. In Ternate they told us that they are
better than rabbits, and that they give them as food to the sick. The pilot(*)
said that as the wind was contrary for returning to the place we left we should
follow that channel, as the wind was in our favour and the channel broad, deep
and clear. We did so and next day at four in the afternoon we anchored at an
island near Bachan without being aware of it. In a quarter of an hour a covered
canoe appeared from there, with a man clothed in red and seated in the middle.
He came near and asked us what nation it was, he was answered Portugal. He
replied, you are nothing but Dutchmen. Then they hoisted the flag on the poop,
saying we are Spaniards and when he recognised the arms of Spain, being a
Portuguese, he came closer and assured himself that we were Spaniards and came
aboard and embraced us with much affection and satisfaction. The reason he did
not come on board at once was that in this place a Dutch ship had anchored
which carried 24 pieces of artillery, with only ten men, very sick, and left
eight days ago. I(**) thought this must be its consort and consequently I(**)
did not venture until I made certain; I am a servant of the King of Bachan,
lord of this country; the King my lord asks leave to come to the ship to see
you.</p>
<blockquote>[* Juan Bernardo Fontidue&ntilde;a.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** <i>Sic</i>.]</blockquote>
<p class="page">{Page 183}</p>
<p>He was answered that he would do us very great honour and that he might come
when he pleased and the ship and crew were all at his service. He went off with
the reply and at the Avemarias(*) the King came in a carack with the
Portuguese, and asked us not to fire guns as they terrified him. He came on
board and we all received him with a welcome and he sat in the gallery of the
poop on an old carpet we brought out. He was clad in a long blouse of purple
taffeta down to the knees, nothing on his head, nor shoes on his feet; he
brought twelve men from his guard and attendants, and his auditor and the
Portuguese, who acted as interpreter. The arms his guard bore were some
butchers' knives, and one man had a naked sword and a round shield, which are
the royal insignia used by the Kings of these regions; an attendant carried in
his right hand a silver cone with many holes filled with tobacco pipes, and in
the left a silver flask with native wine. After he sat down in his fashion,
which is like women, the first thing he asked was how was the King of Spain his
brother, I answered, In good health, glory be to God. What was his age? I said
25 years. How many children had he? At present two, the prince and an infanta.
If he was a great sportsman with the round net for catching sardines and other
fish? I replied, A fisher truly, but not of sardines but of kingdoms, and that
he had caught with his net more than half the world, with all the Indies, West
and East, and the Philippines and the Moluccas nearly up to Bachan. He said,
According to that, he is indeed a great fisherman. He asked for Spanish wine
and drank three times one after another and the rest of the night he drank(**)
tobacco until he went to sleep on the carpet. I put my men on guard throughout
the ship, for they told me that this King was baptized, and a renegade entirely
through carnal vice. I said he is not to be trusted nor his people, for he who
leaves God will do any wickedness. In the morning he said that we were not
comfortable in that spot and that we should go to the safe harbour of La
Bua.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 185}</p>
<p>He caused two caracks to come and with his own they towed the ships to the
harbour two leagues distant, where we anchored on the 6th of December, a year
less six days since we started from the Callao of Lima. From here I sent
advices to the Camp Master Juan de Esquibel, by a soldier in a vessel which the
King gave me, for from this harbour to Ternate is 24 leagues. He was well
received by him and hospitably entertained by all the Spaniards. He replied
that we should go thither forthwith, because it was for His Majesty's service,
as all that district was almost in revolt.</p>
<blockquote>[* i.e. at nightfall.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** i.e. inhaled.]</blockquote>
<p>The reply came on Christmas Eve and we received it through Father Fonseca,
of the Company of Jesus. The King asked us to go in his company on an
expedition he had to make against some subjects who had rebelled against him,
who were half way on the road. It was granted on condition that we were to
start after Christmas. He got ready his armada of four caracks with five
hundred men and we set out through some estuaries, very navigable as the wind
was right for getting out of the harbour. The next day we reached an island
with a good harbour which is called Tahabares and stayed two days owing to bad
weather. [Then we saw the strait between Gilolo and Bachan which the Moor from
the Papuas mentioned.]. From here we went to Cayoa and anchored in a fine bay
very early. The King at once sent a summons that they should come immediately
and render him obedience, if not he would devastate and burn them all. They
replied that they were seeking kids and hens to present to him and that in the
morning without fail they would go to render him obedience. All night they were
fixing stakes in the estuary which led to the village, and the blows were heard
clearly in the ships; they thought that unless we entered by the estuary we
should not reach the village. I told the King to order his men to get ready and
not to believe them, for they wanted to gain time to fortify themselves. Having
ordered that all the men should be ready in the morning and our men having
breakfasted, I selected thirty men with the drummer, and the King came with his
men and took us wading through a mango swamp, where the enemy did not suspect
us; I thought he was leading us to destruction, but he told us not to be
worried as it was the safest part and would soon end, as it did.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 187}</p>
<p><b>The enemies had established themselves in a square fortification of
stone, with a moat full of water round it and such that they could defend
themselves from two thousand.</b> I told the Sangax of La Bua, who was a
Christian and spoke Portuguese very well, to go forward with a handful of men
and sound to arms behind them and we with the King would take the position of
the gate.</p>
<p>This was done and the Sangax sounded to arms after we were in the said
position; shouting Santiago I gave them a volley of arquebuses; they were so
confounded with the name of Santiago and the noise of the drum and arquebuses
that they rushed out pell mell through a side door, abandoning the fort and
fleeing like deer; there were more than eighty corselets and a hundred and
fifty helmets. Our men entered and found a quantity of excellent cane pikes and
missile darts with charred points. The King went afterwards to the village and
caused it to be sacked and burned, and only left the mosque. It appeared ill to
a Biscay-an soldier that the King had left it unburned and he set fire to it,
and being of dry canes it was very soon reduced to ashes. The King sent me, by
a Bachan who spoke Portuguese, a request to punish that soldier for his
disrespect in having burned the mosque; I answered that I heard it. So having
collected my men I went off to the island of Maquien, the chief and most
important of those that have the drugs of clove and spice, and I anchored in
order that the men might rest and to wait for good weather. So great was the
report that the conquest of Cayoa spread through all the region that some of
the Kings of Gilolo, who were on the point of making friends with the refugees
of Ternate, at once sought the friendship of the Camp Master(*) and other
Spaniards of Ternate, as they held it impossible to be able to conquer that
island. <b>The island of Maquien is five leagues in circumference with a
quarter of a league around of shoals and rocks in three spans(**) deep of
water</b>; on the side of the Portuguese fort there is an "olla"(***) or hidden
port with a mouth through which a ship can enter, but if there is a slight
fresh north wind it will dash to pieces all the ships there might be inside, as
it has not good anchorage.</p>
<blockquote>[* Juan de Esquibel.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** 2 feet.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[*** = pot or saucepan.]</blockquote>
<p class="page">{Page 189}</p>
<p>In the morning we left Maquien and anchored in the island of 011as in a
harbour of the same sort but very sheltered, as the wind had turned in a
different direction, also the currents. Next day we went to anchor in that of
Tidore, and next day in Termite, and because the ships could not enter the
harbour formed by the ridge of rocks, on account of the shallowness of the
mouth, we made a salute to the city with all our artillery and arquebuses.
Thereupon a boat sent by the Camp Master(*) came with a lieutenant and told us
to go to El Fume which is an island near Tidore which forms a fine harbour.
Then in order to cover twelve leagues we were three days in that sea of great
currents, uncertain winds of short duration and very few places in which
toanchor. We went ashore to pay our respects to the Camp Master Juan de
Esquibel and the other captains, we were received with great joy by all and
hospitably entertained; we remained here until the 28th of April when the
supply of provisions they sent from Manila arrived, and it was the first they
had sent since that land was won.</p>
<blockquote>[Juan de Esquibel.]</blockquote>
<p>The islands which have the clove are four; Maquien which is below the
equinoctial line and is five leagues in circumference; Motiel, uninhabited
owing to the bad air, is two leagues in circumference; Tidore, thickly
populated, is four leagues in circumference; Ternate, with its active volcano,
is three in circumference. There are other islands round about and larger ones,
but they do not produce cloves, as they are flat. Those that produce the clove
have the shape of a high-crowned hat; on the top of these islands there are no
clove trees nor at the bottom; it is all at the mid-height of the hills.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 191}</p>
<p>The trees that bear the clove, called in Portuguese claveras, are large, the
bark is tawny tending to dark red, the leaves are like those of the strawberry
tree. The nutmeg trees are like cherry trees both in colour and leaf. There is
another strange tree of large size the leaves of which are like those of the
white cabbage, and when yellow are good to eat with meat in the pot, and they
have the same taste; they call it Molucca cabbage, and thus it is the
all-the-year-round cabbage. The fruits are plantains, a fruit known throughout
the Indies; there is another they call durions as large as a citron with a
green skin marked like diamond points, the flesh inside stinks like rotten
onions; the Portuguese say that it is the best in the world; I could never eat
it. There is another they call papayas, as large as small melons, they have the
same taste, the pips are like peppercorns and taste like cress; they cover them
when green with sugar and they taste like candied peel. There is another they
call mangoes as large as the fist, when ripe it has the taste of a peach, and
when green they pickle them, like olives, in brine, and they are more savoury
than olives. There is another they call granzones, as large as small hen's
eggs, when it is ripe it is white and transparent like cloudy crystal, the
taste is sour-sweet and very good; it has three stones in the middle like
pumpkin pips and of green colour, which embitter like aloes. There is abundance
of very good cocoanut palms. There is neither rice nor wheat. They eat bread of
sago; these are trees like palms but smaller and they have a soft pith; they
cut them in the middle and place a piece on top of a kneading trough, then pour
a stream of water on it from buckets and the pith it drives out stays at the
bottom. They take it out and put it in another; and when they want to make
bread they have square dishes of good earthenware, with hollows in them of two
fingers deep, and the same wide, these they put to heat at the fire, and when
very hot they withdraw them and put the sago in the hollows, and leave them a
little while and then empty them, and thus they make bread until the dish is
cold, then they take another and in a quarter of an hour they make bread enough
for twenty persons; it comes out like little biscuits(*) and only needs sugar
to make it as tasty.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 193}</p>
<p>On cutting down a tree another springs up which is ready for eating the next
year. The islands producing the clove are twelve leagues away. It rains at all
the conjunctions of the moon for twenty-four hours; the weather is always the
same, both summer and winter. The fragrance of sweet scent which comes from
those trees before sunrise is something to praise the Lord God for, and I
maintain that there is not the like in the world.</p>
<blockquote>[* Of light paste made with eggs.]</blockquote>
<p>On the first day of May we left Ternate on the course for Manila passing
along the islands of Sarrangan, Panguisara, Jolof, Taguima, the Mindanao and
the Rio de la Canela(*) where we traded for a large quantity; and thence to the
Catandianes(**), Panay, Mindoro, el Fraile and the island of Maribeles, to the
port of Cabite of Manila, where we anchored on the twenty-second of May and
were visited by the Factor Joanes de Egui and Captain Felippe Corso. We went to
the city to give notice of our arrival to the Audiencia, which was carrying on
the government, owing to the death of the Governor Don Pedro de
Acu&ntilde;a(***), and to ask them to provision us as speedily as possible for
continuing our voyage as His Majesty commanded. They replied that they had no
money for the purpose and required the ship for other things important to His
Majesty's service, and with this our expedition ended, which lasted seventeen
months from the 21st of December 1606(****) to the twenty-second of May 1608.
May the Lord God be praised for ever and ever, Amen.</p>

<p>At the beginning of June(*) there came from New Spain the ship San Pedro,
which was our capitana, and in it some sailors from among those of our
expedition who related to us what occurred about the mutiny, and it is as
follows. From the time when Pedro Fernandes de Quiros turned to the north west
and would not proceed to carry out what was decided in the council, when the
evident signs of land near appeared, the friends of the Chief Pilot said, This
man is selling us and does not know where he is going, he will do with us what
he did with the Adelantado Avenda&ntilde;o(**) when he went to the Solomon
Islands, for he is taking the same steps; let us go to New Spain and run the
ship ashore, and let us throw him and his nephews into the sea and thus we
shall get clear of this trouble, but this must be done when we find a place to
supply the ship with water. They wanted to carry it out in Taumaco when they
saw that you(***) had gone to the almiranta, and not finding the time suitable
they gave it up. In the Isla del Spiritu Santo when they set out to seek that
island and on the return in the middle of the bay that south wind came on us,
Bernal(****) said to Captain Quiros, General, we are lost unless we seek
anchorage; in the bay it is impossible, as you know, except in the harbour of
Vera Cruz, and we cannot go there as the wind is dead against us. Quiros said,
What can we do? Bernal said, Let us go to anchor behind the cape of San
Phelippe(*****) and when the wind drops we will enter the bay and harbour.
Quiros said, Let it be done, and went to sleep. We made such haste that at dawn
we lost sight of the island. Quiros came out at mid-day as usual from his
stern-cabin and asked why they had not anchored behind the cape, in reply he
was told to shut his mouth and go to his cabin, where they put the Portuguese
grocer and his nephews with guards, and they ordered the jars of wine belonging
to the Portuguese(******) to be brought out and to be divided among the
sailors; and they gave nothing either to him or to the grocer; and they gave
them to eat whatever they wanted. Thus the wine he thought to sell at a good
profit in the Philippines they took from him for nothing. But seeing how
submissive they were in their cabin they did not carry out what they had
projected. They reached the port of Acapulco and forsook the ship before it
anchored therein. They went to Mexico and gave report to the Viceroy about this
man, and his comrade and great friend informed the Viceroy of what the said
Quiros had discovered, and when he went to speak to him he took no notice of
him, holding him for a fool and a madman, and that he had deceived his
Majesty.</p>

<p class="page">{Page 197}</p>
<p>The island of Luzon, which is the chief of the Philippine Islands, is the
largest of all, and contains the city of the Spaniards called Manila, where the
Governor and Audiencia reside. It is situated on the sea coast, at t he side of
the hay, and on the other it has a great river so that for more than two parts
it k surrounded by water. The position is flat and calm, and in the shape of a
trapeze; at the point between sea and river it has a strongly-walled castle
with two bastions on the city side and a curtain, all the wall is of lime and
stone; and it has good artillery inside; it is called the Castle of Santiago.
The city has twelve thousand five hundred feet of wall, seven feet thick, and
on the land side from Vagunbaya there are five terraced bastions with their
curtains and two gates to go out into the country. It would have about eight
hundred houses of lime and stone with very straight streets of twenty feet
wide; there is a cathedral church with its archbishop, canons and prebends; a
fine monastery of Augustine Friars, another house of Recollets of Saint
Nicholas of Tolentino, another</p>
<p>convent of Dominican Recollets, another house of S. Francis and another of
the Company of Jesus, and a good hospital. Outside the wall it has the suburbs
Tondo and Minondo on the river side, and in front the Parian which is the
quarter of the Chinese merchants who come with goods, and of all who hold
offices for the service of the citizens. The suburbs of San Anton, Candelaria
and Vagunbaya all have rush houses like the Indians use. The churches in these
suburbs and the dwellings of the Friars are of stone and very prejudicial to
the fortification of the city, for if an enemy attacks it he can easily seize
the roads by which it can be relieved and so be soon lost. And for this the
Governors are to blame for having allowed it.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 199}</p>
<p>There is great trade in Chinese goods and delicacies; from Japan they bring
a quantity of wheat flour for bread, as this country does not produce it, but
only rice which is the ordinary bread of the natives and residents; there is
much wine of nippa and cocoanut palms; it is all white. The nippa trees are
short palms which grow in the salt estuaries and arms of the sea; from them
grow asparagus shoots about half a yard long, and as thick as the wrist; they
cut the points and bend them so that the liquor which comes out falls into
vessels they place underneath; they call it sura, it has the taste of sugar
water; they put it into large earthenware alembics, what comes out is white
nippa wine, as strong and hot as brandy; but if they do not distil it within
six hours it becomes vinegar, and very good, which they use with food, as it is
of pleasant taste. This sura recently drawn off is very good for liver disease
provided it be very fresh. The sura of cocoanut palms is drawn from the flower
in this manner: each palm tree produces three branches of flower, one they
leave for cocoanuts and two for wine. They tie each branch separately with thin
cords of cocoanut fibre, and cut the ends and under each they put a vessel
which receives the sura, they pass it through an alembic like the nippa and
wine comes out stronger than that of the nippa; and if they pass it twice it is
stronger than the best brandy made in Spain; and in order that the sura may
come out better they cut the ends every day about the thickness of paper, and
this they call gladdening them. When the asparagus of the nippa tree comes to
an end they cut it down for another to grow, and do the same with the flower of
the palm trees, and as there are plenty they pass the vessels on to others
until they end, and as long as the others already have shoots; and thus they
have wine all the year round, and it is of excellent flavour, colour and
odour.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 201}</p>
<p>The provinces of the island called the great Margarita, as I was informed by
the Governor Biliato and the morabito(*) who was with him, and the Indians I
took from there, are as follows: the Boniguis, Huniis, Suleis(**), Canais(**),
Lippiis(**), Railes, Elabons(***) Ovania&ntilde;as(**), Alomas, and High and
Low Papuas. The bread they eat in general throughout this country and that of
the Moluccas is sago. The meats are turtles, very large pigs, peacocks, native
fowls and those of Spanish breed, pheasants, doves and parrots; there are wild
buffaloes, but they do not eat them because they do not approve of killing
them, but rather worship them like gods. The fruits are durions, bifafas(****),
nancas, plantains, cocoanuts; it must have others which we did not see. The
roots are white, yellow and purple potatoes, yams and ginger; there is plenty
of sweet cane of which they make sugar in Spain, and of large size, black
pepper and cassia.</p>

<blockquote>[**** "bifasa." <i>Vide</i> p. 147.]</blockquote>
<p>The coast we discovered from the cape of Saint Buenaventura to the west up
to Cape Popan, end and termination of the land, is 680 leagues; that which runs
to the east, which is to the levant, is very great; all along this coast there
are many and very fine ports and anchorages, with clear bottom and free from
sharp sunken rocks; plenty of fresh water, wood, shell fish and ballast for
ships. Every time I went ashore I took care to look for the stones there might
be on that ground, and there were many of tawny colour which are from copper
mines, others sandy and purple like those from silver mines, and as this land
is in the parallel and altitude of the best mines of gold and silver there are
in Peru, I think they may be here also.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 203}</p>
<p>The navigation is easy from the port of Acapulco of New Spain, as this land
lies midway between Acapulco and Manila in the Philippines. Its conquest is
easy, for the people are docile and ill-armed; and in a land where there are so
many cocoanut palms people cannot die of hunger. May it please the Lord God to
put into the heart of our lord the King the desire and means to conquer it,
both for the salvation of the many souls there are in it and for the greater
increase of the Royal Crown of Spain. Amen.</p>

<h3>REPORT OF THE COUNCIL OF STATE. 25 SEPTEMBER 1608</h3>
<p>SIRE,</p>
<p>Some days ago there was laid before the Council a letter from Luis Vaez de
Torres, chief of one of the two ships which went from Peru for the new
discovery of the unknown parts of the South, wherein he gives an account of all
that happened to him and was discoveredin his voyage; and likewise were
exhibited five maps which he sent of some ports and islands where he landed,
and it was submitted to Your Majesty on the second of August last that it might
all be referred to the Council of the Indies, and that what it might submit
thereon should afterwards, at Your Majesty's pleasure, be laid before this
Council for it to indicate what might seem to it desirable, and now also has
been considered in the Council, according to Your Majesty's directions, the
enclosed report(*) from that [i.e. the Council] of the Indies respecting the
proposal made by Pedro Fernandez de Quiros, what he has gone through in the
said discovery, and what he seeks in order to continue it.</p>
<blockquote>[* This Report has not yet been found in the Spanish
Archives.]</blockquote>
<p>And the Council, having considered the matter with the attention which its
importance requires, is of opinion that the Council of the Indies is correct in
what it says, for it being certain that what is discovered in the Indies
withdraws men from Spain, which is so short of men, as is evident, it may be
feared that fresh discoveries will lead to greater injury and open a way for
Your Majesty's enemies to go to occupy them, since besides the lack of men
which exists in these kingdoms for fresh conquests, Your Majesty's treasury is
so exhausted that there will be much strain in retaining what has been
discovered, and the Council is not sure that with good conscience it is
possible to make these conquests of heathens who neither disturb nor attack
us.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 213}</p>
<p>That this Pedro Fernandez de Quiros has got it into his head to be a second
Columbus, and seeing that from what is aforesaid his design cannot be
encouraged, it is not desirable to drive him to despair on account of what he
has seen and discovered, and the risk there would be that he might have
recourse to Your Majesty's enemies to occupy it; and therefore, taking for
granted that it will be best not to discuss this fresh discovery, it is of
opinion that this man being so experienced should be retained here as
cosmographer in order that he may be of service in marine charts and globes,
through the Council of War, for the Council of the Indies does not help him as
he has not gone to the Indies by their order, but by that of the Council of
State; and in this way everything will be settled, namely, not to make known or
publish what this man has discovered, nor to drive him to despair, and to avoid
the difficulty about his giving information to the enemies of this Crown, and
to retain him and get from him all the profit that may be possible in whatever
may arise here in respect of his profession.</p>
<p>Your Majesty will order it [i.e. the Council] to consider and provide what
may most conduce to Your Majesty's service.</p>

<h3>THE LETTER OF TORRES. 12 JULY 1607</h3>
<p>Being in the city of Manila at the end of a year and a half of navigation
and discovery among the lands and seas in the unknown southern parts, and
seeing that in this Real Audiencia of Manila they have not hitherto thought fit
to give me dispatch for completing the voyage as Your Majesty commanded, and as
I was in hopes of being the first to give Your Majesty a relation of the
discovery, but being detained here and not knowing if in this city of Manila
they are to give me dispatch, I have thought proper to send a person to give
account to Your Majesty, namely Fray Juan de Merlo, of the Order of Saint
Francis, one of the three Religious whom I took in my charge, who, as a person
who was present throughout, will give a full relation to Your Majesty, the one
by me is the following.</p>
<p>We set out from the Port of Callao, of the city of Los Reyes del Peru, on
the twenty-first of December, with two ships and a launch, in the year sixteen
hundred and five, the commander thereof being Captain Pero Fernandez de Quiroz
and I his Almirante, and keeping well together we directed our course to
west-south-west, we went on this course eight hundred leagues, and in latitude
of twenty-six degrees, it seemed fit to our Commander not to pass on from here
because of certain changes in the weather, to which I gave a signed reply that
it was not a prudent thing to go down from there until reaching 30 degrees and
more, if the weather should permit us: my opinion was of no avail for from the
said 26 degrees we went down forthwith on the course of west-north-west. We
went on this route to 24 degrees and a half: in this situation we found a small
flat island about two leagues in length, uninhabited and without depth enough
to anchor the ships.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 217}</p>
<p>From here we set out, steering to the west a quarter to the north-west to 24
degrees: in this situation we found another island, uninhabited and without
anchorage: it would be about ten leagues in circumference, we named it San
Valerio: from here we set out steering to the west a quarter to the north-west
for one day; and then to the west-north-west until we reached the 21st degree
and a third. In this situation we found another little flat island, without
depth, uninhabited, divided in pieces: we passed on in the same course, and
having gone 25 leagues we found four islands in a triangle of s or 6 leagues
each, flat, and uninhabited and without depth; we named them Las Virgenes: here
the needle varied to north-east: from here we set out, steering to the
north-north-west to 19 degrees: in this situation we saw a small island on the
eastern side, distant from us about three leagues, it was similar to those we
had passed, we named it Santa Polonia. Coming down here half a degree we saw a
flat island with a point on the south-east, full of palms; it was in i 8
degrees and a half, we reached it, it had no anchorage, we saw people on the
beach, the boats went to the shore and when they reached it they could not land
owing to the heavy sea and rocks. The Indians called to them from the land, two
Spaniards swam ashore, whom they received very well; casting their weapons on
the ground they embraced them and kissed them on the cheek. With this
friendliness one of their chiefs came on board the Capitana to converse,
together with an old woman, to them they gave clothing and presents, and sent
them back on shore forthwith, for they were in great fear. In return for the
kindness they sent a bundle of hair, and some poor feathers and some wrought
shells of pearl oysters, this was all their treasures; a very wild people,
dusky and corpulent. The weapons they use are some very long and very thick
lances: as we could not land nor get anchorage we passed on, steering to the
west-north-west. We went on this course keeping in sight the land of this
island, we could not reach it beyond the beginning owing to contrary and rough
wind, with much rain; it was all very flat so that in places the water washed
over it.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 219}</p>
<p>From this place of 16 degrees and a half we went steering to the north-west
a quarter to the north to ten degrees and three quarters: In this situation we
saw an island which was understood to be that of San Martin, I mean of Sant
Bernardo, because it was in pieces, but it was not it from what we saw
afterwards: we did not find anchorage in it, although the boats went to shore
to see if there was water, which we were in want of, but they did not find it,
they only found some cocoanut trees, and those small. Our Commander seeing that
we wanted water, agreed that we should go to the Island of Santa Cruz where he
had been with the Adelantado Alvaro de Avenda&ntilde;o,(*) saying that we might
supply ourselves there with water and wood and it might be settled what would
most conduce to Your Majesty's service. At this time the crew of the Capitana
were mutinous, designing to go straight to Manila: for this reason he sent me
the chief Pilot a prisoner to my ship without putting him or the others to
trial, though I strongly importuned him to punish them or give me leave to
punish them as they had the name of traitors: but he did not choose to do it,
wherefrom there happened to him what Your Majesty will have known,(**) since
they made him turn out of his course, as will be stated, and he has probably
mentioned at Your Majesty's Court.</p>
<blockquote>[* i.e. Menda&ntilde;a.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[** From Merlo's account?]</blockquote>
<p>We set out from this aforesaid island to the west a quarter to the
north-west: here we found in this meridian that the needle varied north-east
very nearly a quarter. We reached by this course to ten degrees full: in this
situation we found a flat island of five or six leagues, swampy and without
depth, it was inhabited and the people and weapons were like those we had
passed, but different boats came close to the ships talking to us, taking what
we gave them and asking for more, and stealing what was hung from the ships,
thrusting at us with lances, it seeming to them that we could not do them harm,
seeing that there was nowhere to anchor, for lack of water, our Commander
ordered me ashore with the two boats and fifty men.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 221}</p>
<p>When I arrived on shore they opposed my entrance without ever desiring
peace, whereby they compelled me to skirmish with them. After having done them
some damage three of them came out to make peace with me, singing with branches
in their hands, and one with a lighted torch, and kneeling, I received them
well, and embraced them, and then clothed them for they were some of the
chiefs, and asking them for the water they would not show it to me; acting as
if I did not understand, keeping the three chiefs with me, I ordered the
Sergeant with twelve men to search for water, and on their finding it the
Indians came out again and attacked them and wounded a Spaniard: seeing their
treachery I attacked them and put them to flight without other harm whatever,
the land being in my power I went over the village without finding more than
only dried oysters and some fish and many cocoanuts with which the land was
well provided. I found no birds nor animals, but only little dogs: I found many
covered boats, with which they are accustomed to navigate to other islands,
with very curious lateen sails made of straw, of the same cloth the women are
clothed in their little shift and petticoat, and the men only round their
waists and private parts. From here we set out with the boats laden with water,
by the great swell they were swamped to the great risk of our lives, and so we
were obliged to go on without getting water at this island, giving it the name
of La Matanza(*).</p>
<blockquote>[* The Killing.]</blockquote>
<p>We set out steering on this parallel thirty-two days: in all this route we
found there were very strong currents and many drifts of wood and snakes, and
many birds, all of which were signs which indicated land on both sides of us:
we did not venture to search for it that we might not leave the latitude of the
Island of Santa Cruz, for it seemed to us to be always near, and with reason if
it had been where they had indicated it on the first voyage when they
discovered it; but it was much farther on, as will be seen by the account, so
about 60 leagues before reaching it and 1940 from the City of Lima, we found a
small island of about six leagues, very high and all round it very good depth,
and other small islands near it, under shelter of which the ships were
anchored.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 223}</p>
<p>I went with the two boats and fifty men to reconnoitre the people thereof,
and at a musket-shot distant from the island I found a village surrounded by a
wall, with only one entrance without a gate; staying near with the two boats
with the intention of attacking them, as they would not by signs indicate
peace: at length the chief came from within, the water up to his neck, and a
staff in his hand, and came without fear straight to the boats, whom I received
very well, and by signs which we very well understood, he told me that his
people had great fear of the muskets, and so he begged me not to land, that
they would supply the water and wood on giving him vessels. I told him that it
was necessary to remain five days on shore to rest. Seeing that he could not do
more, he quieted his people who continued very turbulent, and thus it was that
there was no hostility on either side. I went into the fort very safely and
calling a halt I made them give up their weapons, and ordered them to bring
from their houses their effects, which were all of no value, and they went with
him to the island to other villages which were there: they thanked me very
much, the chief always remained there with me, they then announced the name of
the country. All the chiefs came to me to make peace and be present with me,
making their people supply water and wood, and they took it on board the ships:
in this we spent six days: the people of this island were of very agreeable
conversation: we agreed very well, they desirous of learning our language and
teaching us theirs: they were very great seafarers, all very bearded, very
great archers and hurlers of darts: their very large boats could go a great
way: they gave us intelligence of more than forty islands great and small, and
all inhabited, naming them by their names, telling us that they were at war
with many of them.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 225}</p>
<p>They also gave us intelligence of the Island of Santa Cruz, and of what
happened there to the Adelantado Alvaro de Avenda&ntilde;o:(*) the people of
this island are of ordinary stature, there were amongst them people white and
red: other native Indians in colour like those of the Indies and others black
negroes and mulattos, they use slavery, their foods are some yams and fish,
they have many cocoanuts, they have pigs and fowls.</p>
<blockquote>[* i.e. Alvaro de Menda&ntilde;a.]</blockquote>
<p>This island was called Taomaco, and the name of its chief was pronounced
tomay. I took leave of them, having seized four Indians at which they were not
very pleased, and as we here got water and wood, we had no need to go to the
Island of Santa Cruz, which as I say was in this parallel sixty leagues farther
on. So we set out from here steering to the south-south-east to twelve degrees
and a half, where we found an island of the size of that of Taomaco of the same
people: it was called Chucupia: there was not in the whole of it more than one
small anchorage, and passing in the offing I went ashore in a small boat with
only two men: they came out to me to make peace and therewith presented to me
some bark of a tree which seemed to be a very fine cloth of four yards long and
three palms wide with which they clothe themselves: thereupon I took leave of
them: from here we set out steering to the south, we had a very rough wind from
the north which compelled us to tack about for two days at the end of which it
was thought that as it was winter we should not go to higher altitude than
fourteen degrees in which we were at present, though my opinion was always
quite contrary: it was agreed that we should seek the Islands named by the
Indians of Taomaco, wherefore we set out from this situation steering to the
west, and in one day's sail we discovered a very high and large volcano of more
than three leagues in circumference, very full of trees and with black people
with thick beards: to the west and in sight of this volcano some eight leagues
off was an island not very high, very pleasant in appearance: there were few
anchorages in it and very close to the shore: it was very full of black people:
here two were caught in some canoes, to whom we gave clothing and presents, and
on the next day they went ashore: in return for this they shot a flight of
arrows at a Spaniard, though it is true he was not in the same port, but a
musket-shot farther on: it is a people that in seeing their advantage never
miss it.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 227}</p>
<p>In sight of this island and around it were many islands very lofty and very
large: and to the southward one so large that we went to it, naming the one
where they wounded our man, Santa Maria: setting out from it to the south
towards this very large island which we saw, we discovered therein a very large
bay, thickly peopled and very fertile in yams, and many fruits, pigs and fowls:
they are all black people and naked, they fight with arrows, darts and clubs:
they would by no means make peace with us: though we frequently spoke to them
and I made them presents; never with their goodwill did I set foot on shore,
they always wanting to prevent it and fighting always much in our favour. This
bay is very fresh, and with many and very large rivers, it is in latitude of
fifteen degrees and two thirds: it would be about twenty-five leagues in
circumference: we gave it the name Bay of San Phelipe y Santiago(*), and the
land that of Espiritu Santo: here we remained fifty days, we took possession in
the name of Your Majesty; from within this bay and from the most sheltered part
of it the Capitana set out from us at one hour past midnight, without telling
us of it and without making signals that we might understand it by them: this
took place on the eleventh of June, and although at once on the following
morning I went out to seek it making the proper efforts, it was impossible to
find them; for they did not go on the route nor with good wills: so I had to
return to the Bay to see if perchance they had returned to it: all this I did
for further loyalty in this Bay, and I waited fifteen days for them: at the end
of which I brought forth Your Majesty's orders and calling a council jointly
with the officers of the Launch, it was agreed that we should fulfil them,
though against the inclination of many, I might say of the majority, but my
condition was different from that of Captain Pero Fernandez de Quiros.</p>
<blockquote>[* <i>Vide</i> Prado Map I.]</blockquote>
<p class="page">{Page 229}</p>
<p>At last I set out from this Bay in fulfilment of the order, but with
intention of sailing round this island; the season did not allow me owing to
the very great currents, but I ran along a great part of it; in what I saw it
consists of very large ranges of hills, it has many ports but some of them
small, throughout it much water of copious rivers: I had at this time nothing
but bread and water, and in the height of winter, and sea and contrary wind and
ill wills: all this was not strong enough to prevent me from reaching the
latitude of which I passed one degree, and would have gone further if the
weather had permitted; for the ship was good. It was right to act in this
manner for these are not voyages made every day, nor could Your Majesty be
informed, it is understood, by continuing to make this route to the latitude:
on the course of the south-west I did not find therein a sign of land; from
here I turned to the north-north-west to eleven degrees and a half; here I fell
in with the beginning of New Guinea, the coast of which runs from the east
west, a quarter of the north-west south-east. I could not weather it on the
east side, so I came coasting on the west, and on the south part all is land of
New Guinea. It is peopled with Indians not very white, naked, but their private
parts well covered with barks of trees resembling cloth much painted; they
fight with darts and shields and some clubs of stone very gay with a lot of
feathers; more islands and inhabited ones lie along the coast. There are in all
the coast many very large harbours, with very large rivers, many plains.
Outside these islands runs a reef of shoals, and between them and the mainland
lie the islands. There is a channel within.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 231}</p>
<p>In these ports we took possession in Your Majesty's name, the description
whereof goes with this.(*) Having gone along 300 leagues of coast, as I have
mentioned, and diminished two degrees and a half we came to a stop in nine,
from here begins a bank [<i>placel</i>] of three fathoms to nine which runs
along the coast a hundred and eighty odd leagues. We went over it along the
coast to seven degrees and a half, and the end of it is in five: we could not
go forward owing to the many shoals and great currents which there are
throughout it; so we had to go out turning southwest in the said depth, to
eleven degrees, and the bank goes lower: there were very large islands and they
seemed more on the southern part: they were inhabited by very corpulent black
people, naked: they have for weapons some very big and long lances, many
arrows, clubs of stone very ill-shaped: we could handle none of their weapons:
I caught in all this land twenty persons of different nations, in order with
them to make a better report to Your Majesty. They give much information of
other peoples, though as yet they do not make themselves well understood: we
went along on this bank for two months, at the end of them we found ourselves
in twenty-five fathoms of depth, and in five degrees of latitude, and ten
leagues from the coast, and having gone 480 leagues here the coast runs along
to the north-east: I did not reach it for the bank went very shallow; so I went
on running to the north and in 25 fathoms up to four degrees where we fell in
with a coast that also ran in the direction of east-west, we did not reach the
end on the eastern side, but from what we understand it joins that one of
further back, as the bank reaches it, and from the great smoothness of the sea:
this land is inhabited by black people different from all the rest.</p>
<blockquote>[* Probably referring to the accompanying maps mentioned in the
Report of the Council of State to the King. <i>Vide</i> p. 211.]</blockquote>
<p class="page">{Page 233}</p>
<p>It is a people better adorned, also they use arrows and darts and some very
large shields, and some sticks of bamboo filled with lime which discharges of
itself, with which when fighting they blind their enemies: finally we went
running to the west-north-west along the coast, always finding this people,
although we landed in many places: also in it I took possession in Your
Majesty's name. It was here in this land that I found the first iron and bells
from China, and other things from there, by which we understood more surely
that we were near the Moluccas, and so we went running along this coast about a
hundred and thirty leagues, so the end would lie 50 leagues; before reaching
the Molucca Islands, there is an infinity of islands on the south side and very
large ones, but for want of provisions I did not reach them, for I doubt if in
10 years it would be possible to inspect the coasts of all the islands we saw:
observation of the needle was taken in all this land of New Guinea to the
Moluccas; in all of it the needle when stationary rests in the meridian of the
Ladrone Islands with the Philippine Islands: at the end of this land we found
Moors clothed, having artillery for service, such as falconets and culverins,
muskets and side arms: they carry on conquests of the people they call the
Papuas, and preach to them the sect of Mahomet: these Moors had trade with us,
selling us fowls and goats and fruits, and some pepper and biscuit they call
sagu, which keeps for more than twenty years, but there was little in all, for
they wanted cloth and we had none, for all that had been given us for barter
was carried off by the Capitana, and even the tools and medicines and many
other things which I do not mention, as there is no help for it: but without
them Our Lord took care of us. These Moors gave news of the events at the
Moluccas, and of Dutch ships, though they did not reach here, although they say
that in all this land there is much gold and other things, good spices such as
pepper and nutmeg. From here to the Moluccas it is all islands, and on the
south side lie many that are met with, including those of Banda and [anbueno]
Amboyna, where the Dutch carry on trade: I arrived this way at the Islands of
[Vachan] Bachan, which are the first Moluccas, where I found a Theatine with
about a hundred Christians in the country of a friendly Moorish King, who
begged me to subdue for him one of the islands of Ternate, in possession of
revolted Moors, which Don Pedro de Acu&ntilde;a had conferred upon him in Your
Majesty's name to hold in lieutenancy; so I, having sent advice from here to
the Maestre de Campo, Juan de Esquibel, who was governing the Islands of
Ternate, of my arrival, and asked if it was expedient to give this assistance
to the King of Bachan; he answered me that it would do very great service to
Your Majesty if I brought force for that purpose.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 235}</p>
<p>Hereupon I decided on forty Spaniards and four hundred Moors of the King of
Bachan, then I made war against them and in only four hours I put them to
flight and took the fort, and put the King of Bachan in possession of it in
Your Majesty's name: to whom I administered the usual oaths stipulating with
him that he should never go against Christians, and should always be a faithful
vassal to Your Majesty.</p>
<p>I did not find this people so valiant in spirit as those we had passed, the
powerful hand(*) must have caused it that in the many labours and victories I
had, it was always made easy for me, and with only the loss of simply one
Spaniard in all my journeyings: I am not making a relation of them to Your
Majesty, for I hope to give it very fully: the King being put in possession I
set out to Terrenate which was twelve leagues from this Island, where Juan de
Esquibel was, by whom I was very well received, for he was very exhausted of
men, and the natives of Terrenate were in rebellion, to whom it caused great
fear to see help so encircling; and a few days later arrived that from Manila
which was much desired, as half of the people left by Don Pedro de Acu&ntilde;a
were no more, and there was scarcity of provisions; for, as I have said, the
natives of the Island were in rebellion: but by the prudence of the Maestre de
Campo Juan de Esquibel the affairs of these Islands are coming into very good
order, though there is much want of help in money: here I left the launch and
about twenty men as it was all expedient for Your Majesty's service.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 237}</p>
<p>From here I set out for the City of Manila, where they are giving me such
bad dispatch as I have stated, nor up to the present, namely for two months
past, any food for the crew; and so I know not when I shall be able to set out
from here to give account to Your Majesty, whom may Our Lord protect and
prosper for sovereign of the world. Done in Manila, on the 12th of July, in the
year 1607: Your Majesty's Servant, Luis Baes de Torres.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX II</h3>
<h4>TWO LETTERS FROM DIEGO DE PRADO SENT HOME FROM GOA IN 1613</h4>
<p>The following re-translations by Mr Barwick will be found to vary
considerably from the versions given by Markham (pp. 511-13), Lord Stanley of
Alderley in his De Morga's <i>Philippine Islands</i> (Hakluyt Society, XXXIX,
1868, p. 412) and Collingridge (pp. 256-9), etc.</p>
<p>The Letters are printed in Spanish by Zaragoza (11, pp. 187-90), also in the
<i>Boletin de la Sociedad Geogr&aacute;fica de Madrid</i> 1878 (iv, p. 62) and
by Collingridge (pp. 256-9). Markham in a footnote on p. 512 states that the
letter of December 25 is included in the collection of Mu&ntilde;oz, vol.
XXXVIII, and so reprinted in <i>Documentos In&eacute;ditos</i>, vol. v.
According to Zaragoza the original letters are preserved at Simancas (Leg&deg;
253 Archivo de Secretario de Estado). From the reference given by Lord Stanley
other copies are believed to be in the Biblioteca Nacional, Madrid, at MSS. J.

<blockquote>[* This heading is derived from the Spanish of
Zaragoza.]</blockquote>
<p>Through the Viceroy of India I send to Your Majesty the map of the discovery
which Luis Vaez de Torres, Captain of the <i>Almiranta</i> of Pedro Fernandez
de Quiros made, obeying the order given by the Count of Monterey. The discovery
is of the island called by us the "Magna Margarita",(*) which has 680 leagues
of coast. As Your Majesty will see by the said map, that which Pedro Fernandez
de Quiros, the impostor, discovered were some reefs and small islands, for his
crew mutinied in the bay of the island of Espiritu Santo. I went as Captain of
the ship <i>Capitana</i>, knew what took place on board, took part in it, and
as it was not in conformity with the good service of Your Majesty I could not
stay. So I disembarked at Taumaco, and went to the <i>Almiranta</i>, where I
was well received. The better to carry out their intention, on the 11th of
June, 1606, being in the bay, which we came to from an island that was near,
the wind coming rather fresh from the south, at 8 o'clock in the night, the
mutineers effected their evil plan; and it being dark and far from us, they
passed astern without that talker seeing it, for he was in his cabin aft. Next
morning the land they had left was out of sight. He did not dare to speak, for
they told him to keep in his cabin and hold his tongue, whereby they saved his
life, and they landed him at Acapulco. His own comrades told the Marquis of
Montes Claros(**) what sort of man he was, and that he might as well be
confined as a lunatic, and the Marquis treated him like one. I know not what
respect the Spaniards of Peru can have for one who was but yesterday a clerk of
a ship of merchants and Portuguese. If they know him as the Captain Alonso(***)
Corzo knew him, those Officers of State would understand that such low and
mendacious fellows ought to be of no account.</p>

<p>I leave for Ormuz on the 8th of February of next year, please God, to go by
land to Aleppo and thence to Venice, not stopping until I reach the Court to
kiss the hands of His Majesty. An Indian native of the land we discovered, as a
witness of its profitable character, is sent in charge of the late Viceroy of
India, Don Lorenzo de Tabora, with instructions not to deliver him to anyone
but by order of Your Majesty or mine. The death of the Secretary, Andres de
Prada, has caused me much sorrow, but it is a road we all have to go; to be
commended to God, and may He grant you the health which your servant desires.

<p><b>II</b></p>
<p>[Letter from Don Diego de Prado, addressed to His Majesty, dated at Goa,
December 25th, 1613. Received 12th of October, 1614.(*)]</p>
<blockquote>[* This heading is derived from the Spanish of
Zaragoza.]</blockquote>
<p>Send to Your Majesty the discovery of the great Margarita, Southern Land,
made by Luis Vaez de Torres, Admiral of Pedro Fernandez de Quiros, for it is
full time that it reached the hands of Your Majesty. The delay has been caused
by the Governor of Manila, Don Juan de Silva, who looks more to his own
interest than conduces to the service of Your Majesty, of which I will give an
account in due course. Being unable to embark in the ship in which the Viceroy
Ruy Lorenzo de Tavora went, owing to its having been lost with the ship <i>San
Andres</i>, I resolved to go to Hormuz, and thence by land with the caravan of
the Venetian merchants, journeying little by little to Aleppo, and thence to
Venice and other places, until I reach the Court, kiss the hand of Your
Majesty, and give a full and particular account.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 241}</p>
<p>Your Majesty should understand that the said Pedro Fernandez de Quiros is a
liar and a fraud; for, by his fault, he did not discover that which the Count
of Monterey most desired, namely, the crown of the Antarctic Pole, though we
were so near to it. Nor should Your Majesty give credit to a man who suffered a
mutiny in his ship, such as was raised by the sailors, he having been warned.
And so they treated him as the man he is, fit to be of the Rua Nova in Lisbon,
in whose mouth there is nought but lies, bragging, and disloyalty: and so I
advise Your Majesty to trust him as you would a clerk in a merchant ship; and
this man was the cause of the Adelantado Menda&ntilde;a being lost with his
fleet, as is alleged by Captain Felipe Corzo,(*) Chief Justice of the Port of
Cavite de Manila.</p>
<blockquote>[* Markham in a footnote on p. 513 gives the following particulars
of Corzo: "Felipe Corzo commanded the galeot <i>San Felipe</i>, in the second
voyage of Menda&ntilde;a (M. p. 15). He was an enemy of Quiros, who described
him as 'the Captain of the galeot who carried a great wood knife', and 'The
Captain with the wood knife', when the Camp Master was put to death (M. pp. 77,
79, 80). He parted company, on the voyage to Manilla, without orders (M. p.
105), and reached Mindanao (M. p. 135)".]</blockquote>
<p>I inform Your Majesty of this that your treasure may not be spent on such
people; and may our Lord spare your person for many years as this faithful
servant desires. From Goa, December(*) 25th, 1613. Diego de Prado.</p>
<blockquote>[* Markham gives the date as September, but as he does not state
from which copy of the Spanish text his translation was derived, it is not
possible to trace the origin of the discrepancy.]</blockquote>
<p><i>Resolution of the Council.</i> These letters to be kept, for such steps
to be taken with regard to their contents as may be desirable.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX III</h3>
<h4>THE LEGENDS ON THE FOUR PRADO MAPS, TRANSLATED FROM THE COPIES IN THE
BRITISH MUSEUM</h4>
<p>The original maps are believed to be preserved at Simancas. They were
reproduced in coloured facsimile on the reduced scale of three-eighths in the
Boletin of the Geographical Society of Madrid in 1878. The legends on the maps
would have been practically illegible on this reduced scale, so the places
occupied by them are merely lettered <i>Sitio de la explicacion</i>, while the
text is printed in full in the body of the Boletin.</p>
<p>Markham, in <i>Voyages of Quiros</i>, 1904, again reproduced the Maps in
colours from the <i>Boletin</i> facsimiles, and translated the legends from the
<i>Boletin</i> text, adding two pages of explanatory notes. He also gave a list
of the place-names on each map, but as all the names may be seen on the
appended facsimiles there is no need to repeat the list here. Many of the
places laid down are actually mentioned and described by Prado in his
<i>Relaci&ograve;n</i>, consequently it has been thought desirable to reproduce
the Maps yet again (this time uncoloured), in order that the narrative may more
easily be followed.</p>
<p>The following re-translation of the legends has been made by Mr Barwick from
the full-size copies of the maps preserved in the British Museum (as described,
pp. 76-80, <i>ante</i>). The Spanish text on them appears to agree with that
given in the <i>Boletin</i>, but Mr Barwick's translation will be found to vary
considerably in several important particulars from the version given by
Markham.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that although these maps are signed by Prado, who
in his <i>Relaci&ograve;n</i> is described as Captain and Chief of the
Expedition, Torres is mentioned on two of them (Nos. II and III) as "the
Captain and Chief Luis Vaez de Torres".</p>
<p class="page">{Page 243}</p>
<p><b>MAP I - THE GREAT BAY OF ST PHILIP AND ST JAMES</b></p>
<p>In the year 1606, in the end of April, Captain Pedro Fernandez de Quiros
discovered this island, and named it the Austrialia del Espiritu Santo.
Coasting with two ships and one launch, the Captain Luis Vaez de Torres, his
Admiral, entered this bay on the day of St Philip and St James, and therefore
this name was given to it. Sounding the coast, which lies N. and S., he found
the port and the rivers contained in it, and as he anchored on the day of the
Santa Cruz, they gave the name of Vera Cruz to the port. In the parts shown by
the anchors is the anchorage, very good and clear, with the soundings shown in
fathoms. The rest is without soundings, and rocky. It is peopled by a black
race, in the clothing they had when they left the wombs of their mothers, their
private parts covered with leaves of trees. Their arms are arrows, maces,
clubs, and darts with points of bone. Their food consists of yams, potatoes,
plantains, cocoanuts, oranges, and some pigs. Here the ship Capitana was lost
sight of by us on the 11th of June, and was not found again. It is in latitude
15 2/3&deg; S.</p>
<p><b>MAP II - PORTS AND BAYS OF THE LAND OF SANBUENAVENTURA</b></p>
<p>On the 18th of July, 1606, the Captain and Chief Luis Vaez de Torres
discovered this land and ports, and gave it the name of the Land of San
Buenaventura, having coasted along five days before, but, by reason of the
extensive and very dangerous reefs we could not reach the land until the said
day. It is peopled by a white race. They go naked, and cover their private
parts with cocoanut matting. Their food is yams, cocoanuts, some pigs, fish,
and shellfish. Their arms are clubs of wood, small darts and shields. It is in
10 2/3&deg; S. There is anchorage in all parts of the bays and ports, a clean
bottom without rocks or sharp stones, except that near the land there are
shoals of rocks, as is shown in the said parts. There is good water everywhere,
although there are no rivers. By Captain Don Diego de Prado y Tovar.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 244}</p>
<p>[<i>Note on the Large Bay to the North or Left.</i>] This bay has more than
40 leagues of circumference, and coming with the vessel beyond Cabo Fresco,
which is where the vessel could go out to the east, there is no hindrance
except some islands, by which it is reckoned that the bay has great openings.
But to the west we did not see an opening: all the land was high and closed in
and continued to the west. We left off coasting, not having a suitable
row-boat.</p>
<p><b>MAP III - THE GREAT BAY OF SAN LORENZO AND PORT OF MONTEREY</b></p>
<p>This bay of San Lorenzo and port of Monterey was discovered by the Captain
and Chief Luis Vaez de Torres on the 10th of August, 1606, and the port being
so good that name was given to it. Its distance from the port of St Francis is
20 leagues, more or less, to the westward. It is very beautiful and pleasant,
with a fine and clear bottom, for there is safe anchorage in all parts of it.
The land to the north consists of fine and well-cultivated plains with
abundance of water, and groves of cocoa-nut trees. There are roots of yams and
potatoes, plantains, and other unknown fruits, and many good pigs. The natives
are of the colour of mulattos, their bodies well-formed and strong, and all
circumcised like Jews. The men cover their members with mats, and the women
have petticoats down to the knees. Their arms are darts, clubs, and large
shields. It is in 10 1/6&deg; S, and it is the best land and the most fertile
for settling that has yet been discovered. By Captain Don Diego de Prado y
Tovar.</p>
<p class="page">{Page 245}</p>
<p><b>MAP IV - BAY OF SAN PEDRO DE ARLAN&Ccedil;A</b></p>
<p>This bay of San Pedro de Arlan&ccedil;a and port of San Lucas and of San
Juan del Prado, was discovered by the Captain Luis Vaez de Torres on the 18th
of October, 1606. It is the land of the Papuas, distant 270 leagues from the
port of St Francis. It is very deep in all parts, and the anchorage is near the
shore, which is very steep and mountainous, with great forests and no plains.
The people are black, and these are very few, owing to the rugged character of
the land. Some of them are brown, well built and robust. They have very little
variety of food, only having a few cocoanuts and roots. Their best nourishment
is from fish and shellfish. Their arms are darts, and arrows with bows of cane,
the arrows pointed with bone, and they have large shields, seven palmos long
and three broad, very well worked in half-relief. They cover their private
parts like the rest. It is latitude 3 2/3&deg; S. Here is found iron worked
into adzes and harpoons, and they have bellows of cane with nozzles of clay, by
means of which they work small things of iron. Water is not found in abundance
except in the so-called Spring of Argalas which rises under a very high and
rocky hill. Date, 13th of December, 1606. By the Captain Don Diego de Prado y
Tovar.</p>
