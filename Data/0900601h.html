<p>On looking over some old papers lately, I came across a journal of mine
written upwards of thirty years ago, giving an account of the many difficulties
and dangers which I experienced in taking up the now well-known pastoral
station of Mount Abundance, in the colony of Queensland; and in the hope of its
having sufficient interest to merit publication, I have compiled from this old
diary the following narrative.</p>
<p>In the year 1847 I was a struggling young squatter (<i>Anglic&egrave;</i>,
cattle and sheep owner) in the Gwydir district of New South Wales. My station,
called Keera, was on the Gwydir or Bundarra River (it had both names), and was
distant about three hundred miles from Newcastle, the seaport of the Hunter,
which is about seventy miles by sea from Sydney, so I was already some little
distance away from the capital.</p>
<p>My station, although of considerable extent (somewhere about a hundred
square miles), was of a very hilly&mdash;I may almost say in parts
mountainous&mdash;character, although the hills, dear to a Highlander by birth
and descent, were very unlike true Highland hills, in that they were covered
with grass and open forest to their summits. In short, Keera was justly
described by a friend of mine as a highly picturesque, but by no means
profitable, station&mdash;the reason being that it required too many shepherds
and stockmen to look after my flocks and herds, and economy of expenditure was
then, as now, the only mode of making squatting pay in Australia.</p>
<p>About the time I speak of, an old friend of my father's and mine&mdash;the
late Sir Thomas Mitchell, then Surveyor-General of New South Wales&mdash;had
just returned from one of his exploring expeditions into the interior of
Australia, which particular expedition he described in a book he afterwards
published in 1848, called "Tropical Australia," but long before he published
the book he had inspired me with a most vehement desire to seek "pastures new"
in the beautiful country which he had just discovered; but more particularly to
<i>sit down</i> upon a particular tract of country, which he afterwards
described in his work in the following glowing terms:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I ascended an elevated north-eastern extremity of Mount Abundance, and from
it beheld the finest country I had ever seen in a primeval state&mdash;a
champagne region, spotted with wood, stretching as far as human vision or even
the telescope could reach. It was intersected by river lines from the North,
distinguishable by columns of smoke. A noble mountain mass arose in the midst
of that fine country, and was so elongated in a S.W. and N.E. direction as to
deserve the name of a range."</p>
<p>Such a description was quite enough to inspire a sanguine young squatter
with a desire to seek out this goodly land, and to possess it&mdash;the right
of possession in those days, as to some extent at present, being first come
first served, the exclusive right being granted by the Government to the first
actual occupant with sheep and cattle; and the extent of his occupation being
pretty much left to his own moderation, if he had any, which a good many of the
earlier pioneers had not; and I am afraid I shall not be included amongst the
most moderate. They have changed all this now, and new runs are put up for
lease to the highest bidder, and are hemmed in with all sorts of regulations;
and new runs are now so far distant in the interior, and are generally so badly
watered and have so many disadvantages in comparison with the old ones, that
they may be said to be like a certain Highland laird's geese, hard to get, and
worth very little when they are got.</p>
<p>But it was not so in all the <i>forties</i>. The squatting districts of New
South Wales and Queensland were still in their golden prime, and a very few
thousands would then do the work in the way of founding a fortune which tens of
thousands will not do now. But even then it will be seen that, although there
were a good many prizes, there were a good many blanks too; and it was by no
means the first pioneers who generally reaped the golden returns, but those who
followed in their wake, and were prudent enough, and fortunate enough, to be
able to profit by the labours and toils of those who had borne the first heat
and burden of the day.</p>
<p>But I thought of none of these gloomy forebodings when I organised my first
expedition to Mount Abundance in the middle of the year 1847. I obtained from
Sir Thomas Mitchell a sketch of the route between the last occupied station in
New South Wales and the Land of Promise which I proposed to occupy. The
distance, after all, will not appear very great to people who are accustomed to
railway journeys in this country, as the whole distance from Keera to Mount
Abundance did not exceed 360 miles. But when it is remembered that there was
not a mile of road (in the home sense of the term) the whole distance; that
there was not the vestige of a bridge across a single river, creek, or gully
crossing the line of march; that there were scrubs of all kinds to drive
through&mdash;sometimes to cut through&mdash;for miles, and, added to all this,
various waterless wastes of greater or less extent; when, on the whole, five
miles a day was considered a good day's journey for cattle, sheep, and
teams&mdash;when all these things are taken into account, the difficulties of
such an expedition are by no means small, even when everything goes well and
there is neither a drought nor a flood on the journey. I had my own share of
both at different times&mdash;but this is anticipating.</p>
<p>My expedition started from Keera in the first days of July, 1847. It
originally consisted of upwards of twenty men and a superintendent besides
myself, of between eight and ten thousand sheep, of several hundred head of
cattle (I do not now exactly remember the numbers of either), of four drays
loaded with provisions drawn by ten working bullocks each, of a small horse
team, and of a considerable number of saddle horses. As is usually the case in
starting, the drays were fully too heavily laden, but I felt no doubt they
would be lightened a good deal before they reached Mount Abundance&mdash;a
prognostication which was very fully realised.</p>
<p>As a beginning of the end, I may say that it occupied nearly a fortnight to
get the whole expedition a distance of about five-and-thirty miles&mdash;lost
working bullocks, lost horses, lost cattle, and occasionally lost flocks of
sheep or parts of them, forming the detaining causes; but lost working bullocks
formed the greatest and most constantly recurring nuisance of all. At this time
it was necessary for me to leave the expedition in charge of the
superintendent, and to make a long journey on business into the Darling Downs
district, with the certainty that I should catch up the expedition again long
before it got into the new country.</p>
<p>I returned to the expedition after about a month's absence, during which
time I had ridden on an average twenty-five to thirty miles a day, and three
nights out of the four slept in the open air, which I preferred to the dirty
huts I should otherwise have had to have slept in. I thought myself specially
fortunate if my servant could find the horses in the morning without more than
an hour's hunt for them, during which time I prepared our rather rough
breakfast, or <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. I find the following entry in the diary
I always kept during these wearisome days: "21st August, 1847. Went thirty
miles to-day, to Weyland's Creek, a station of Mr. Richard Wiseman's, and
camped there. Heard dreadful news of my drays and expedition, viz., that two
drays had been left behind, and that half the bullocks were lost and the other
half knocked up." The vanguard of the party, stock, etc., had only advanced
about one hundred miles in a week short of two months, being an average of
about two miles and a half a day; and two of the drays were left behind about
fifty miles for want of bullocks. Here was a pretty business, and did not look
at all like reaching Mount Abundance in time for the lambing in October.
However, there was nothing to be done by taking it easily. I accordingly find
by another entry in my diary, 23rd August: "Sent back the superintendent to
endeavour to get on the other drays, and I myself started on a search in the
neighbourhood to endeavour to purchase or hire working bullocks to replace
those lost, and to assist the miserable remains of those which were left." It
will be remembered that they were forty strong, besides spare ones, at
starting. These delays, and waiting till the superintendent came up with the
two drays which had been left behind, occupied till the middle of September;
and, as yet, we had not accomplished half the journey to Mount Abundance.</p>
<p>I had by this time succeeded in purchasing a fine team of four Clydesdale
horses and a light dray, and rented one team of eight bullocks for the journey,
and bought some others; and again my shattered expedition was somewhat
recruited. But it was anything but plain sailing, even then. To begin with, the
farther I got on, the more the men's fears began to grow, as I drew near to the
confines of settlement&mdash;that is to say, towards the last occupied station
on the line to the far North and West.</p>
<p>By the end of September I contrived, by great personal exertions, to force
on the expedition to a natural rocky bar or ford across the River Balonne,
which had been called by Sir Thomas Mitchell, St. George's Bridge. A station
had recently been formed there for cattle, and it, and a neighbouring one, may
be said to have then constituted the outstations of New South Wales. The St.
George's Bridge station was distant about 220 miles from Keera, and I had still
about 150 miles before me&mdash;between it and Mount Abundance. The intervening
country was, at that time, wholly unoccupied by squatters, and bearing a
somewhat evil reputation for the numbers and character of the natives scattered
over its length and breadth. The fears of my men as to what <i>might</i> happen
to them in venturing into an unknown country, or known only to Sir Thomas
Mitchell and his party, increased daily. To say that they were mutinous and
insolent, and willing to do anything whatever except to look after the stock
and to do their work, is merely to say that they were what men generally are
under similar circumstances. But although the expression of "pegging away" had
not been invented in those days, the practice had, I can most positively answer
in my own case, fortified also by the additional determination to "keep on
never minding."</p>
<p>At St. George's Bridge, or a little beyond it, may be said to have been
commenced our journey into the unoccupied interior. By this time the lambing
season was approaching, and it was necessary to halt the ewes (about 5,000 in
number) till this process was over.</p>
<p>The whole expedition accordingly proceeded some twenty miles higher up the
Balonne River, where we erected temporary rough yards for drafting the sheep
preparatory to the division of the expedition.</p>
<p>I left the superintendent in charge of the lambing sheep, and prepared to
start with the remainder of the expedition for Mount Abundance under my own
charge, aided by an overseer.</p>
<p>By this time it was the first week in October, upwards of three months
having elapsed since the expedition first left Keera, and there were still
about 130 miles to accomplish to reach our destination.</p>
<p>After proceeding a few stages on the road with the diminished party, matters
getting on pretty well&mdash;although our progress was, as usual, very slow
indeed&mdash;I determined to leave the second party in charge of the overseer,
and to make a preliminary visit myself to Mount Abundance to see what the
country was like, and what would be the best line of route for the drays and
stock to take to get there. Accordingly, on the 11th of October I started on my
exploring expedition, accompanied only by my personal servant.</p>
<p>I find from my old diary that we took no pack-horse, but simply carried our
blankets and "about fifteen or sixteen pounds of damper, and a little bacon and
some tea and sugar in our saddle-bags," and prepared for what turned out to be
a ten days' absence from our party. We were, of course, armed also, but we
might have just as well, <i>in those days</i>, gone quite unarmed. The natives
were few in number, and I think we only came across small parties of them two
or three times in the course of our expedition. Of course they could not
understand us, or we them, but they seemed harmless enough, and to be a good
deal more interested in our <i>horses'</i> heads than in ours&mdash;much
surprised, apparently, that the voice came from the smallest head of the
two.</p>
<p>The only precaution we took was to tether our horses at night instead of
hobbling them or letting them graze loosely, as would have been the case at the
camp. Here is a memo. of our fourth day, 14th October: "Had great trouble
to-day with the horses. Having taken off the tethers while we were at
breakfast, they strayed out of sight on stony ground where we could not track
them, and at last, after a long hunt, we got them. Struck across the Cogoon
River to explore the Balonne River, which I presumed to be not far off. Could
not get across the range from the tremendously scrubby nature of the country.
Returned, following a waterless gully, through fine but poorly watered country.
Found horse tracks at junction, which I presumed to be either Dr.
Leichhardt's<sup>1</sup> or Mr. Charles Coxen's, as they had both expressed
their intention of exploring a road from Darling Downs to Fitzroy Downs. Camped
a little above the junction of waterless gully."</p>
<blockquote>[1. This was the well-known German explorer, who had already
distinguished himself by several expeditions into the interior of Australia. He
had just returned from the Gulf of Carpentaria, and was preparing to start on
his last expedition into the far West, from which he and his party never
returned. It was supposed they had all been killed by the blacks between one
and two hundred miles to the westward of Mount Abundance, the last place at
which he and his party were seen by white men, some time after the station had
been formed by me, during one of my absences at Keera.]</blockquote>
<p>"Friday, 15th October. Crossed the Cogoon River and came on the Eastern
Downs, facing Mount Abundance. A glorious prospect! Certainly the most
magnificent country burst upon view that it has ever been my lot to see in the
colony of New South Wales, from North to South, from East to West. Truly, I was
delighted, after all my troubles, to see the prospect of so splendid a
termination, so far as a station, at all events, was concerned."</p>
<p>I spent this and the next two days in surveying the country round and in the
neighbourhood of Mount Abundance, which I proposed to <i>take up</i> as a sheep
and cattle station; and I may say, once for all, that the <i>little farm</i>
which I subsequently claimed as a <i>run</i>, and which claim the Government
subsequently recognised, consisted of about thirty miles' frontage (and say
five to ten miles back) of the Cogoon River for a sheep station, and of twenty
miles' frontage to the creek I subsequently found out was called the
Bunjeywargorai Creek, on which, or near which, I think the modern township of
Roma is situate. The whole run, including the intermediate downs, consisted of
about 600 square miles, or say somewhere about 400,000 acres of the most
beautiful land that ever sheep's eyes travelled over. Beautiful undulating
downs covered with the richest barley grass, and intersected with creeks and
gullies, with just enough timber on their banks to give the whole breadth of
the downs&mdash;somewhere about twenty miles by thirty&mdash;the appearance of
a few scores or hundreds of gentlemen's parks rolled into one. Such was my
first impression of Mount Abundance.</p>
<p>On the ninth day I got back to the camp, and found they had not made much
progress on their route to our destination, but still had not remained actually
stock still during my absence.</p>
<p>Among the next entries in my journal, I find the following on the 24th
October (1847): "For four months now I have been sleeping every night under the
canopy of Heaven, with the exception of about ten days at intervals, as my
journal will show; and still, thanks be to God, I preserve my health, and hope
to continue to do so, although I suspect the next six months of my life will be
passed in much the same manner."</p>
<p>Here is the next entry in my journal: "25th October. Some few blacks made
their appearance in the evening, who fairly frightened my men into convulsions.
I laughed at them as cowards and faint-hearted creatures, and, as I might have
expected, got sulky looks and expressive growls for my pains. To show them how
little <i>I</i> feared the blacks, I told my men that in the morning I intended
to start ahead by myself, and to camp out <i>alone</i> for two or three nights,
exploring the water, and finding out the best spot for forming the head
station. One of the ringleaders remarked on this that 'if I was tired of
<i>my</i> life, he was not tired of his.'"</p>
<p>I, however, contrived to get them into better spirits&mdash;or at all events
better temper&mdash;and induced them to agree to move on, while I myself kept
to my resolution to spend a night or two with the proposed object.</p>
<p>These are the next two entries I find worth quoting: "26th October. Started
ahead by myself. Went in a straight direction to Mount Abundance, and then
followed the river or water-course every mile of the way up to its head in
Mount Bindyego. Found the water nearly run out at the place where Sir Thomas
Mitchell's sketch no longer shows its course; then followed the river back to
about four miles north of Mount Abundance. Camped there; saw blacks several
times to-day, but had no intercourse with them." "Wednesday, 27th October.
Started back to the drays and stock. Had an interview with thirty-two blacks
(all men). My horse dreaded them very much, and the blacks seemed to dread him
more than me, if possible. They were all armed, but seemed very well disposed,
but in tremendous fear of my double-barrelled carbine, of myself, and of my
horse. We, however, made signs to each other of peace&mdash;green bushes,
etc.&mdash;and they knew the words 'white fellow' and 'wheelbarrow' (their
corrupt word for <i>drays</i>)&mdash;words got from some semi-civilised tribes
on the Lower Balonne&mdash;and after more chat and friendly signs I left them.
Met the drays within about five miles of the spot I had fixed on for the head
station, and I accordingly made them come on to-night, viz., to a bend of the
river where there is a long reach of water, about one and a half miles south of
the south spur of Mount Abundance."</p>
<p>Here was the advanced guard (so to speak) of the expedition arrived at the
Land of Promise, and it now remains to be told what we did when we got there,
and all that followed till the eventual break-up of the station.</p>

<p>The following couple of months were spent in the usual occupations incident
to the formation of a new station&mdash;building huts&mdash;building sheep and
cattle yards&mdash;a little fencing&mdash;all, in fact, that was absolutely
necessary for the slightest of shelters for the men, and the necessary
accommodation for drafting the stock. Some out-stations were also formed,
including a cattle station&mdash;distant about twenty miles from Mount
Abundance&mdash;being the site of what is now the flourishing little inland
town of Roma, to which I am informed a railway from the city of Brisbane, the
capital of Queensland, is now in the course of construction.</p>
<p>Some very rough preparations had also to be made for the approaching
shearing, which would necessarily be very late; but still it was a case of
better late than never. There was not much doubt of getting shearers, even at
this great distance beyond the settled parts of the colony. A shearer in my
days (as a squatter) would go <i>anywhere</i> for a job, merely expecting so
much a score more in proportion to the distance of the station from the nearest
public-house. Many of these men, by two or three months' work during the
shearing season, earned, and no doubt earn still, not only sufficient to make
work unnecessary during the remaining nine months of the year, but sufficient,
if they so employed their earnings, to enable them to start in various
occupations on their own account. But to quote a witticism of their own, as a
general rule, their investments of their earnings were all "in
houses"&mdash;<i>public</i> being understood; and during the nine off months
they loafed about from station to station, sometimes doing a few weeks' work at
splitting, or fencing, or other odd jobs, but more generally travelling by slow
stages of a few miles a day from one station to another (living on the
hospitality extended to <i>all</i> travellers), but seldom doing much
work&mdash;working like horses for three months, spending like asses during
another&mdash;and living as they best could during the rest of the year. The
approaching shearing, then, was not my difficulty, but the fact that there was
only a sufficient amount of supplies to last the Mount Abundance establishment
till the end of February was a serious consideration.</p>
<p>I had hoped to have been able to discover and mark out a line of road
between Mount Abundance and the settled part of Darling Downs, which would have
reduced the distance to the nearest seaport&mdash;Brisbane, the present capital
of Queensland&mdash;to about 350 miles; but there was so much to be done in the
necessary business of forming the station, that it was impossible at this time
to attempt it; and, moreover, deaths and losses had reduced my working bullocks
to a mere handful.</p>
<p>I accordingly determined to return myself to Keera, to start more drays and
provisions from there, and at the same time to establish communications with
Brisbane by the longer but established road from the Barwin River, about
half-way between Mount Abundance and Keera.</p>
<p>Accordingly, on the 22nd December, 1847, I left Mount Abundance, with a
couple of saddle horses for my own use, in company with my horse team of four
powerful horses, and the empty dray and the driver. I may say that this
constituted the party, as I had, some time previously, sent my own servant to
Keera with letters, and no other man could be spared from the Mount, where we
were short-handed rather than otherwise. The weather at this time was fearfully
hot, and portended either a tremendous drought or a tremendous flood&mdash;both
were on the cards&mdash;but the <i>latter</i> turned up with a vengeance on
this occasion, as will be seen. We proceeded at the rate of about twenty miles
a day, which was about as much as we could accomplish. Fortunately, the horses
never strayed away, and at this time we were in no fear of the natives&mdash;at
least, <i>I</i> was not&mdash;and the driver did not <i>say</i> much about it,
whatever he thought. But the heat on the Balonne River, when we got there, was
such as I have never experienced, before or since, in any part of the world I
have ever been in, the Red Sea <i>not</i> excepted. Here is a note on the 26th
of December: "The hottest day I think I ever felt in my life. The loose horses,
which follow the dray of their own accord without being driven, were in a
lather of perspiration."</p>
<p>As we proceeded down the Balonne we came upon a new cattle station
(Fitzgerald's) which had been recently formed there, and found, so says my
journal, "that the blacks had already begun to kill his cattle, and that the
whole river abounded with harbours for them." I also found that another new
station (Hall's) had been formed higher up the Balonne, and distant about
seventy miles from Mount Abundance. So it appeared that we were gradually
getting neighbours.</p>
<p>We proceeded onwards on our way, making pretty good progress till the 4th of
January, 1848, and I do not think I can give a better idea of what a flood
means in the <i>Low Districts</i> of the interior of New South Wales than by
giving a few extracts from my journal:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Tuesday, 4th January. Started to go across from the Mooni Creek to
Grover's, on the Barwin River. Got over the first twelve miles of the road very
well; then (it having looked cloudy all the morning) it began to rain
violently. Further we could not move, the whole country becoming rapidly under
water, and the roadway being invisible. Having no tarpaulin with us, and as the
rain caught us before we could make a sort of tilt with blankets, everything
got wet through, and it rained violently and incessantly the whole of the
night."</p>
<p>"Wednesday, 5th. Managed to move on about three miles during the whole day,
the empty cart bogging up nearly to the naves of the wheels. Raining violently
off and on. Made a sort of a blanket tent, and stopped at a vile place,
surrounded on all sides but one by standing pools of water. Even in walking we
got up to our knees in mud. Obliged to walk without boots. Cart bogged in a
deep marsh."</p>
<p>"Thursday, 6th January. Again made a start by dint of making the horses draw
the cart backwards out of the marsh. Carried our little luggage and my trunk
and our bedding to a comparatively dry piece of ground. Went up to our knees
every step. I myself nearly exhausted, but do not care to show it. Got on, with
great difficulty, three miles further to the weir, four miles from Grover's, on
the Barwin. It cleared up bright, thank God; but the ground is so rotten that
the poor wretched horses, when <i>loose</i> from the cart, are up to their
knees in mud." The next day we contrived to get to Grover's "by tremendous
exertions&mdash;dray literally going axle deep, and horses breast deep, in mud
and water."</p>
<p>Here I determined to leave the dray and dray horses and driver, and push on
myself to Keera, leaving the driver to go on to Brisbane for the provisions,
etc., which he would find there, while I would start other drays and provisions
from Keera. To take leave of the dray, I may say that the floods increased so
greatly that I subsequently found that the driver had been obliged to wait
several weeks at Grover's before he could start for the Downs, and that he
himself and the rest of the occupants of the station had passed nine days and
nights on the <i>roof</i> of the hut, the whole country for sixty miles round
having been from three to six feet under water! People hear in this country
more of <i>Australian droughts</i> than <i>Australian floods</i>, but this
description may give an idea of what they are like in the low parts of the
interior&mdash;those parts which supply Sydney with its finest and fattest
beef.</p>
<p>To return to myself. Nothing daunted by rain or flood, after a single day's
rest, I started on the 9th of January on my homeward journey, having to ride,
walk, wade, and swim the 150 miles which intervened between the Barwin and
Keera. I continued my amphibious progress for a couple of days, wading through
a sea of mud, driving my poor saddle horses before me; and if I could have
laughed at anything at the time, it would have been at the fact that they
<i>could not</i> get away from me, because from the circumstance of my having
only <i>two</i> feet and a greater breadth of <i>sole</i> than they had; that
if it had come to a trial of speed in the mud, that <i>I</i> could have
distanced them, although they had no weight to carry but my saddle and
blankets!</p>
<p>In those days I had, certainly, rather a wiry constitution, but it seemed as
if I had just stretched it a little too far, as, on the third day of my
homeward journey (it having rained almost incessantly the two previous ones), I
was obliged to take a day's rest, or rather unrest, for I had serious
threatenings of a severe attack of fever and ague. I felt, however, that I must
press on, and hoped to get better as I got into the higher and drier country.
Higher it certainly got during my next week's journeyings, but drier certainly
not, so far as the heavens were concerned, as it rained nearly incessantly
every day. Of course, I had to swim every creek, gully, and water-course on the
route, and my horses got so used to it that they latterly seemed just as
comfortable <i>off</i> their legs as <i>on</i> them. Here is the memo. of:</p>
<p>"Tuesday, 18th January. By dint of violent exertions, bogging the whole way,
got home to Keera&mdash;i.e., I went first to Molroy, then followed the river
(the Gwydir) up on the same side to Keera, left my horses, etc. (the etc. on
this occasion including all my clothes), on the one side, and swam across,
where I found dry clothes, etc., which the people from the cottage, in answer
to my shoutings, had brought down. It was nine o'clock at night before I got up
to the cottage. It rained all night." I may observe that from the tremendous
force of the current I had the narrowest squeak for my life that up to that
time I had ever had, and but for the aid of a number of kindly blacks (camped
at the river) who helped me, I should not now be writing this narrative. It is
quite one thing to swim an odd dozen or two of creeks&mdash;quite another to
swim a great river like the "<i>Big River</i>" in a flood, as it used
familiarly to be called in that district.</p>
<p>Here is another curious memo. from my journal: "Found my lost horse, Don
Juan, had come in to Keera all the way, 360 miles from the Mount, by himself.
Reports at this time were rife at Keera that seven of my men had been killed by
the blacks, and that I myself had been wounded to death."</p>
<p>The arrival of the horse seemed to give colour to the story, but the curious
fact is that the horse had not travelled to Mount Abundance by the direct road,
because I had, as it will be remembered in the earlier part of my narrative,
performed a long detour, something like the loop of a 'D', round by Darling
Downs and back to the direct line of road; but the horse was too wise to take
such an unnecessary bend in coming back to the place of his birth, where one
morning he trotted up to the gate either to announce his return or to get a
piece of damper, of which he was particularly fond. Any way, his return caused
great consternation, and it had been seriously proposed to organise a party to
go out to Mount Abundance to see what had happened. Here are my next two
entries in my journal:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Wednesday, 19th January. Blacks got my saddle, etc., across the river.
Raining again most of the day. The cattle which are going to Mount Abundance
have been waiting to start for three or four weeks, and no likelihood yet of
their being able to move."</p>
<p>"Thursday, 20th January. Flood at its maximum to-day. Garden totally under
water. Flood within eight inches of the level of the house. Fencing and sawn
timber all swept away, also boilers and boiling-down place. Mount Abundance out
of provisions by the end of February next. When shall I be able to get supplies
there?"</p>
<p>This was the important question I had to solve&mdash;the penalty of
<i>not</i> solving it being probably the entire loss of the whole stock out
there, and the desertion of the stations. I knew perfectly well that when the
floods abated, and the country became moderately passable, that I should find
no difficulty whatever in getting hired carriers to take out any supplies that
were required, with the promise of return loads of wool, an arrangement
subsequently carried out. But the question was how was a single dray load to be
forced out, in spite of rain, floods, bogs, mud, and all other difficulties, on
or before the last days of February? To accomplish this difficult task, I felt
that I could trust no one but myself, and accordingly on the 1st of February I
find this entry: "At last started a dray with rations, which I accompany myself
to Mount Abundance."</p>
<p>The dray had ten bullocks, a bullock driver, an assistant, and a Keera black
called Jemmy, and was not heavily loaded; and I fondly hoped that if the rain
would only stop, that by dint of perseverance, I might force it out in time. I
will not give details of the miserable journey, but simply say that we
accomplished about 100 miles in three weeks. There I came across the driver of
the horse team on his way to Darling Downs, he having been detained up to that
time by the floods, as before narrated. Up to this time, although our progress
had been very slow, diversified by the usual amount of trouble from lost
bullocks (which, however, were always tracked and recovered by Black Jemmy),
still we <i>were</i> getting on; and the ground, though very soft and slushy,
was still passable. But now we were again getting into the horrible low, soft,
boggy country, and my troubles again began. As a sample of a day's work, which
might serve for a description of many days, I give an extract .from my journal
of "February 28th: Employed all day in getting part of the stores across the
Boomai River in a tub, and wrapped up the flour in the tarpaulin, and got the
bullocks to drag the dray through the shoalest part of the river. They,
however, stuck on the opposite bank, bogging up to their middle. With much
difficulty carried the flour on to the bank from the middle of the river, and
in vain attempted to get the dray on the west bank to-night. The bullocks being
too much exhausted, they turned in the stream, and, in spite of our efforts,
dragged back the dray to the other side, where we had to leave it for the
night, and let them out. Twenty-two times to-day did I swim
this&mdash;unpleasant&mdash;river myself, and, to sum up troubles, we had
another tremendous thunder shower. It was not expected, and the sugar was not
under shelter. I had to get up in the middle of the night, and with the
assistance of Jemmy got the bags under shelter; but still it got rather wet.
The men were on the other side of the river."</p>
<p>By dint of a good deal of persuasion I induced the men to keep on, and in
the course of ten days we contrived to get on by inches&mdash;so to
speak&mdash;about a dozen miles. I then resolved to leave the dray and the two
white men and Black Jemmy to get on by themselves when the ground got drier,
and to proceed by myself to Mount Abundance to announce that the supplies were
on the road, and to endeavour, if possible, to purchase or borrow some supplies
from the nearest of the Balonne stations if my station was actually <i>in
extremis</i> for the want of flour, tea, and sugar, etc. On the 25th of March I
reached Mount Abundance. "I found things much better than I expected; the men
were not grumbling much at the shortness of the rations, and our losses by the
wet weather had been absolutely nothing; but ten more working bullocks had been
lost, having got away from the rest of the cattle, so that out of all the
working bullock stock brought to Mount Abundance there are only six very
indifferent ones left." I found that from the delays occasioned by the floods
and other causes, the superintendent had not quite completed his shearing,
which, under ordinary circumstances, should have been finished three months
previously. But I was very particular in my enquiries as to how they had got on
with the blacks, and found that, up to this time, they had had little or no
intercourse with them; the fact being that my servants and the blacks were
mutually in great fear of each other, under which circumstances it occurred to
me that the less they came in contact the better, till they came to a better
understanding, which they could only do through the medium of friendly blacks
who understood both parties, who were rather difficult to find, as nearly every
large tribe has a separate dialect.</p>
<p>I, however, left Mount Abundance with a tolerably strong belief that the
blacks in the neighbourhood were not numerous, and that they were not disposed
to meddle with my people&mdash;who were certainly not disposed to meddle with
them&mdash;and I accordingly left, with a tolerably easy mind, for what turned
out to be an absence of upwards of six months, during which time I was under
the necessity of visiting Sydney, and remaining there some time.</p>

<p>On my return to Keera, I started at once for Mount Abundance, accompanied by
a number of new men&mdash;shepherds, etc.&mdash;to fill up the establishment
there, and also by my own servant, and by a civilised black named Charley, who
understood a good many native dialects, and who also spoke English as well as a
good many whites. I shall have a good deal to say about him, poor fellow, in
this narrative, and I may begin by saying that he was as brave as he was
intelligent, and faithful to the death. My own party started from Keera on the
8th of September, 1848, and we made fair progress on our route till we got near
St. George's Bridge, on the Balonne; on the 30th of September, when, in the
words of my journal of that date, "I heard of the severest misfortune it has
been my lot to encounter during the last thirteen or fourteen months. I met two
of the men in my employment at Mount Abundance, who stated that they had just
come in from there with the following news, viz., that on the 9th of September,
the day after the drays arrived at the station, the blacks had attacked Lowe's
stock of about 2,000 ewes in lamb; had killed Lowe (one of my shepherds), and
at the same time had gone to the sheep station within about three miles of the
head station, and killed Gore, the hut-keeper, and had taken away with them 800
to 1,000 sheep. They also informed me that the rest of the men (fifteen in
number) had compelled the superintendent to desert the station without any
attempt to deal with any of the blacks or to recover any of the sheep; and
that, accordingly, they had all left, taking with them the rest of the sheep
and the stores, but leaving behind all the cattle, and about thirty bales of
wool in the shed. On enquiring where the party were, I was informed that they
were all at the junction of the Cogoon and the Balonne, about fifty to sixty
miles on this side of Mount Abundance, and that they (my informants) had left
them there, being unwilling to remain any longer. They had met the party I was
taking up, who were a few miles ahead of me, but did not appear to have
succeeded in inducing them to bolt also." On getting on to the station at St.
George's Bridge I met another deserter from the Mount Abundance party, who
confirmed the horrid news.</p>
<p>I made what haste I could to join the routed band of faint-hearted pioneers
at the junction of the Cogoon and the Balonne, and succeeded in partially
calming their fears, and in inducing them to promise to return, under my
guidance, with the stock to Mount Abundance. I could not, however, induce any
one of them&mdash;my own servant being the first to refuse&mdash;to accompany
me on a preliminary visit to Mount Abundance to see how things were getting on
there, and, among other things, to ascertain whether the blacks had burned down
all the huts after the establishment had bolted, and also the temporary
wool-shed, wherein there were between thirty and forty bales of wool. The
<i>only</i> volunteer for this somewhat hazardous expedition was my friend
Black Charley, who, after applying to my whole party every possible term of
contempt that his knowledge (very considerable) of the English language
afforded, remarked, in the coolest manner, that "'neither master nor he wanted
such cowardly wretches with us; white wretch only in the road.' And,
accordingly, Charley and I started by ourselves, taking with us a semi-wild
Balonne black (mounted) to lead the pack-horse, and to find the horses in the
morning and to bring them to our camp."</p>
<p>We went the first day "to a lagoon near XIX. Camp, the Lake Turanonga of
Mitchell." (Had I been disposed to <i>pun</i> on this occasion, I might have
adopted the pronunciation given to it by my men on the way up, and called it
the Lake "Tired and Hungry.")</p>
<p>"Saturday, 7th. Left camp a little after seven a.m., having got breakfast
and got the horses early. No signs of blacks yet, but about one or two
o'clock&mdash;." And here follows the description of my first conflict with the
blacks&mdash;evidently the advanced division of a large party coming from Mount
Abundance to complete, if possible, the task they had begun a month before.</p>
<p>To any person of proper feelings, the remembrance of taking human life must
always be a painful one, even if taken in self-defence, or to protect the lives
of others, or as the recompense of murder under circumstances where the majesty
of the law is entirely powerless. I must own that it was a great consolation to
me in the <i>first</i> conflict we had with the natives (and it was not the
<i>only</i> one before we reached the Mount two days afterwards), that my
keen-eyed friend Charley found on the person of one of the blacks who had
fallen <i>a pocket-knife with the initials "J.G." engraved on the
handle</i>&mdash;being that of the poor hut-keeper, John Gore, who had been
brutally murdered, at the door of his hut, only a month before. Certainly, in
this case, if the retribution was not <i>swift</i>, it was at all events
sure.</p>
<p>On our arrival at Mount Abundance, on Sunday, 8th of October, "we found the
wool all safe and just as they had left it, and the huts unentered, proving
that the blacks were, if possible, greater cowards than my own men. We found
some milking cows and a few cattle about, and drove a steer into the
stock-yard, which I shot with a pistol, intending to cure it by cutting it into
strips and drying it (jerking it) in the sun, as we had no salt. Camped in the
larger hut or store, which was full of every sort of rubbish, showing the
disgraceful hurry in which the whole party had left. To make all sure, we put
three of the horses in the stock-yard to-night, leaving one outside."</p>
<p>Monday, 9th. Charley and I scouring the country round the Mount to ascertain
if there were any blacks lurking in the neighbourhood, and, finding the coast
clear for the time being, I determined to send Charley back the next day to the
camp to try and bring up a dray or two and some of the party at the junction,
to get things ready for the reception of the whole party when the lambing was
over. I may say that I had the greatest difficulty in persuading Charley to
agree to leave me at the Mount by myself (the Balonne black didn't count for
much), but he said <i>he</i> was willing to stop there till I could get up the
drays and party&mdash;an offer which of course I could not accept, as I looked
on the Mount as the post of danger. I accordingly passed the three following
days all alone but for the company of the Balonne black (Friday), who looked
after the horses. I passed most of these days in riding round the Mount in
search of signs of the blacks, which I will own I was <i>not</i> anxious to
see&mdash;at all events till the return of Charley, which took place on the
morning of Friday, the 13th of October. "He said he had been travelling day and
night since he left. He brought a letter from the superintendent and some young
horses with him. Charley said that two drays, with their drivers, and Dan (my
servant) would be here to-morrow night, but that he did not like to stop with
them longer for fear the blacks might be attacking me at the hut. He told me
with a grim smile that when he left the drays the drivers threatened to turn
back to the camp, but that he had told them 'plenty smoke behind,' meaning to
inform them that it was as safe to come on as to turn back." On the following
day the two drays and men arrived at eleven o'clock at night, having travelled
incessantly, without unyoking their bullocks, since they left the camp.</p>
<p>Between this time and the 27th of October, 1848, we contrived to get a
second detachment of men and some sheep from the camp at the junction of the
two rivers, a considerable body having to remain there on account of the
lambing. It was a curious coincidence that the Mount Abundance station may thus
be said on this day to have been reoccupied for the <i>second time</i> on the
very same day that it was first occupied by me the year before.</p>
<p>It now occurred to me that it would be in every respect desirable to find
out a practicable line of road for drays, etc., between Mount Abundance and
Brisbane, the seaport of Queensland, distant between 300 and 350 miles; the
unknown country, so to speak&mdash;that is to say, the distance between Mount
Abundance and Birrell's, on the Condamine or Upper Balonne&mdash;then being
estimated by me at about 130 miles. There was also a vague report from the
friendly Balonne blacks that <i>somewhere or other</i> to the east of my cattle
station (as I have before stated, the site of the present township of Roma), a
sheep station had been recently formed by people from the Darling Downs
district. With the double object, therefore, of finding the station, or at all
events of finding a practicable route to Darling Downs, I resolved at once to
start on this new expedition.</p>
<p>On the 29th of October, accordingly, I left Mount Abundance, taking with me
my friend Charley, an active stock-keeper of mine named John Byrnes (familiarly
known by the men as "Dublin Jack "), and the Balonne black, Friday. I need
scarcely say that we were fully armed, and we also took a pack-horse with eight
days' rather scanty supply of provisions, and I also took with me a Kater's
compass and a few simple necessaries for making a rough survey of the road. I
may say that in all my explorations I made a rough survey of the country and
plotted my work when and how I best could, the <i>basis</i> of the measurements
being my horse's footsteps, which I sometimes counted; and for rougher work
estimated his rate as fourteen, fifteen, or sixteen minutes to the mile,
according to the country travelled over, and the pace of the horse used. I was
also enabled, by cross bearings, to fix pretty accurately the positions of the
peaks of various hills on the line of route. I may say, once for all, that the
survey notes and sketches that I subsequently gave to the Surveyor-General's
Office, in Sydney, formed for a good many years afterwards the only plan in
that office of the country round Mount Abundance, and of the country between it
and Darling Downs. But this is anticipating. The first and second days of our
expedition were employed in hunting about for the supposed new sheep station in
the neighbourhood of my cattle station, and late on the evening of the third we
came across a dray track, which we followed as long as it was light; and here I
may as well quote my journal: "1st November, 1848. Started early this morning
upon the dray track, following its inland course. Came, in about three miles,
upon the evident signs of a station partially formed and afterwards deserted,
viz., a set of sheep-yards on the right bank of the Bungil Creek, and also sad
proof of the <i>cause</i> of the disaster&mdash;a grave, hastily dug, evidently
that of a white man! Who the unfortunate owner could be I could form no
conjecture. I could see no initials cut on trees, or any other signs to enable
me to form a guess as to the name of the owner of the stock, and consequently
determined to run the dray track coastways (eastwards), and find whether the
routed party had gone back to Darling Downs, or had mustered up resolution to
stop halfway."</p>
<p>I may say that I ascertained, by my survey, that the deserted station was
something under <i>fourteen miles</i> to the east of my cattle station. Had the
men at the two stations known of their mutual proximity, it might not only have
saved a good many lives, but its probable effect would have been to have saved
<i>two fortunes</i>&mdash;mine and my unfortunate neighbour's. On such
apparently trifling circumstances TEN THOUSAND A YEAR often depends in a new
country; <i>that</i> was the stake <i>I</i> was playing for, and very nearly
won it, too&mdash;only, unfortunately, <i>not quite</i>.</p>
<p>After examining all round the deserted station we found their return dray
tracks, in the direction of Darling Downs; and surveying as we went along, and
camping at night at suitable places, we followed the track for four days, at
the rate of about twenty-two miles a day, which was as much as we could do
without getting off the track, which was faint and worn out in places. The last
day we had nothing to eat but a small bit of dry crust each, in the
morning.</p>
<p>On the fifth day, "Sunday, 5th November. After about three miles' riding,
heard the welcome sound of a gun, and came upon a hut, which I found to be a
temporary station of Mr. Blythe, who turned out to be the unfortunate
individual who had been driven, by the ferocity of the blacks, and by the
abominable cowardice of his party, to desert the beautiful station he had taken
up on the right bank of the Bungil Creek, about S.E. by E. of my cattle
station, on the Bunjeywargorai. This is the second shearing since Mr. Blythe
had left the Mudgee district, where he had been a squatter, and since that time
he has been leading an erratic, or rather nomadic, sort of existence, seeking a
resting place and finding none. His men seemed, if possible, in a worse state
than even mine&mdash;lazy, insolent, overbearing ruffians, who seemed to be
killing Mr. Blythe by inches; he seemed quite worn out and broken-hearted, from
constant worry and care. As a sample of the character of the men by whom he was
surrounded, I may mention that when we had gone to bed, about nine or ten
o'clock, we heard great bursts of occasional laughter from the adjacent men's
hut, which we could not at first account for; but at last distinguished one
voice reciting the story of my mishaps at Mount Abundance, and particularly
dwelling upon the mode the blacks had adopted in killing the shepherd and
hut-keeper, on which he seemed to enter into all manner of horrid details. We
could hardly comprehend how this could be a source of pleasure or amusement to
these men, till we heard a stentorian voice shout out: 'Well, if this 'ere
don't keep up wages, I'm blowed!' This, of course, explained the mystery."</p>
<p>I spent a few days resting ourselves and horses at Mr. Blythe's, and, during
my stay, so says my journal, "I got a long and detailed account from Mr. Blythe
of the outrages the blacks had been perpetrating in this particular
neighbourhood. They had taken away the <i>whole</i> of Mr. Isaac's sheep, about
3,000, from their hut, which he had recently formed, on the head of the Emu
Creek; but had been followed by a party of seventeen men, who had tracked the
sheep from place to place, where the blacks had taken them, as far as the
Grafton Range, making bough-yards for them every night, as well as white men
could have done. The party came on the blacks at the edge of the Grafton Scrub,
and had recovered all of the sheep but about 150, which the blacks had eaten.
The blacks themselves, on being overtaken, all disappeared in the impenetrable
scrub; in number they (the blacks) were stated to be between three and four
hundred. A Mr. Birrell had also had a man recently killed, and a number of
sheep taken away; so also had a Mr. Ewer. Captain Barney, a new settler (a
brother of Colonel Barney, of Sydney), had had his station plundered while he
was preparing to take his wife and family there; and he was so disgusted with
this commencement that he had resolved to give up squatting and return to
Sydney. Numerous were the other mishaps and misfortunes all round which Mr.
Blythe related to me, but I cannot now record them."</p>
<p>Mr. Blythe having hospitably supplied us with an ample store of provisions,
I arranged for proceeding on my homeward journey, feeling that a good deal had
been accomplished, as we had found a perfectly good and practicable road
through good and fair country to a seaport just half the distance from Mount
Abundance that Newcastle is. On the third day of our homeward journey I find
the following entry in my journal:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Saturday, 11th November, 1848. Started this morning (which was cloudy, and
a little drizzling) intending, if possible, to have gone to my deserted cattle
station, and early to the Mount to-morrow, but to-day turned out one of the
most adventurous and hazardous, and also one of the most painful, of my life,
it having cost me my poor faithful friend Charley; and what made it the more
painful was the reflection that this sad occurrence was, in a great measure,
owing to my own reckless foolhardiness. Towards the middle of the day, just as
we were approaching an old camp of 31st October (within about three miles of
Mr. Blythe's deserted station), we came upon a considerable number of hostile
blacks, all in their war paint."</p>
<p>And here follows an account of a skirmish we had with them, in which we had
so far the best of it that they eventually retreated, and left us masters of
the field. As I now view the matter, I think that any sensible person would,
under the circumstances, have made the best of his way to Mount Abundance, out
of such a decidedly unpleasant neighbourhood; but as there were not above
thirty or forty warriors in the party who had retired, and as our horses were
rather tired, I resolved to camp for an hour at the blacks' camp by the side of
the creek, which I thought they would not be in a hurry to return to.
Accordingly (here again I quote my journal):</p>
<p>"I gave the (as it turned out to be) sad and unhappy order to turn out the
horses&mdash;taking off the pack and other saddles&mdash;and began to prepare
for dinner, rendered unusually sumptuous by the addition of an immense number
of fish (cooked and uncooked), roasted bandicoots, opossums, and though last,
not least, five <i>snakes</i> ready cooked, which we found at the fire and in
the mongas at the blacks' camp. Just as the saddles were all off, the horses
hobbled, and our quart pots on the fire boiling, Charley observed a black in
the distance, and called my attention to it, adding, 'You had best get up the
horses, as I think there are a <i>mob</i> coming.' Not in the least
anticipating what was to follow, but still believing Charley's advice to be
salutary, we each took up our bridles and proceeded in different directions to
catch our horses. Four of the horses (my own, Dublin Jack's, Friday's, and the
pack-horse) were pretty close to us on the same side of the creek as we were at
camp at. Charley's was just on the opposite bank of the creek, in sight also,
the animal having gone into the creek to drink. Just as I was going to lay my
hand on my horse's head I happened to turn round, and saw, with much surprise
and a little horror, an immense line of blacks drawn up in a semi-circle, of
which the radius was about 300 yards&mdash;the line of the creek, on the bank
of which I was standing, forming the diameter of the semi-circle. The blacks,
as nearly as I could guess in the <i>coup d'oeil</i> glance I gave them,
greatly exceeded 150. The moment they perceived I had observed them, they set
up a tremendous war shout, 'Waugh, waugh, waugh, tirrrr, tirrr, tirrr!' all in
unison, which fairly seemed to make the air vibrate; but they were not at this
moment advancing. I perceived just at this moment that Jack had caught his
horse, and that Charley was close to his horse on the other side of the
creek.</p>
<p>"My horse did not gallop off, as I feared he would, but stood gazing at the
black cordon with distended nostrils and fixed eyes, evidently in doubt whether
to run or to stand&mdash;as, although an old warrior, a war-cry sounded from
the throats of 150 blacks simultaneously was something new even to him. I took
advantage of his indecision, and, speaking gently to him, put on his bridle,
took off his hobbles, and led him up to my saddle just as Jack flew by me on
his horse with his gun in the air and his saddle girths flying loose, which it
appeared he had not taken time to buckle. The blacks by this time (i.e., about
three minutes after their first appearance and war-shout) had begun advancing
after their manner&mdash;two steps forward and one backwards&mdash;and, just as
Jack fired a shot at them, whizz came a shower of spears, boomerangs,
nulla-nullas, etc., they being still between one and two hundred yards from
where I was standing. As Jack flew by me I shouted to him to ask if he had
taken my gun, as it was not with my saddle, where I had left it. He shouted as
he passed, 'Charley took it.' Another minute had elapsed; I had girthed my
saddle and holsters, vaulted into my seat, and drawn a pistol&mdash;the blacks
within one hundred yards&mdash;and Jack just on the <i>outside</i> point of the
circle, I being at this moment at its <i>centre</i>. One black, seeing me
mount, rushed out of the ring towards me, and as I dashed at him he flung his
nulla-nulla at me, which just grazed my hat, and I at the same instant fired.
We were under twenty yards apart. Jack was at this moment just clear of the
ring. I charged through it at a hand-gallop&mdash;another shower of spears,
etc., passed me innocuously; but one spear passed between my bridle and the
horse's mane, and another grazed the crupper of my saddle, sundry others flying
by me just as I got up to Jack, nearly opposite to the spot where I last saw
Charley near his horse.</p>
<p>"The blacks wheeled round just as I cleared them, and the shower of spears
and the war-shouts frightened Jack's horse so that he had at this moment lost
his saddle and his gun, but, strange to say, he did not wholly lose his seat,
as he was very active and on his horse again in a twinkling; but at the moment
I observed that he had lost his saddle the blacks in force had closed on it, so
Jack and I dashed across the creek somewhat higher up than where Charley had
been seen by me close to his horse. All this occupied about five minutes from
the moment the blacks first appeared. Friday had disappeared unaccountably at
the moment Charley went for his horse. After a rapid search for Charley round
the spot where I last saw him (I could not persuade Jack to wait longer, as the
whole band were closing on us again) we proceeded slowly up the creek, just
keeping out of spear-shot of the blacks, and shouting 'Charley!'&mdash;Jack all
the while persisting that Charley had left us (as <i>he</i> saw him with his
hand on his horse's head before either he or I had caught ours), and that he
was confident that he would be at the cattle station (distant about fourteen
miles) before we should. We then proceeded slowly on, examining the ground for
his horse's tracks (as the blacks' shouts got fainter), and reached the
deserted hut several hours after sunset. There was a bright moon; but, alas! I
could see no fresh horse tracks&mdash;no signs of poor Charley.</p>
<p>"I forgot to mention that the two spare horses (<i>not</i> Charley's) dashed
up to us in hobbles just as I cleared the ring of the blacks, and I took off
their hobbles and drove them before us as we searched up the creek for Charley.
We then went on a few miles further, and camped about sixteen miles from Mount
Abundance. Sad was the night I passed in alternate hopes and fears as to poor
Charley's safety, not unmingled with fears for Friday also, although from his
being unarmed, and, so to speak, a next-door neighbour of the Fitzroy Downs
blacks, I was in hopes they might imagine that <i>he</i> was only compulsorily
accompanying us. If anything could have amused me on this painful occasion, it
would have been the one-sided virulence with which Jack abused the
<i>treachery</i> of the wild blacks. I endeavoured to explain to him that there
was not much <i>treachery</i> in the matter. We were at war with the blacks;
they had certainly killed my men and Mr. Blyth's, and driven away vast numbers
of sheep and cattle without any provocation on our part, but simply from the
desire to plunder. We certainly only wanted that our sheep and cattle should
eat some of the grass which was of no use to them; but then, on the other hand,
they no doubt thought they had a better right to the land than we had. Jack did
not seem to see the force of my reasoning; and as I thought an hour or two of
rest would be a pleasanter occupation than endeavouring to explain the law and
practice of civilised and uncivilised races to an Australian stockman, I
dropped asleep till my turn to watch came&mdash;being the first I had ever
thought it necessary to keep, or to have kept, in all my wanderings among the
tortuous waters of the Balonne system."<sup>1</sup></p>
<blockquote>[1. I fancy my readers will hardly fail to be struck with the
similarity of the event above described to one which recently happened in
Zululand which saddened all Europe.]</blockquote>
<p>"Sunday, 12th November. Arose early enough. Got horses easily&mdash;Jack
riding on my great coat by way of a saddle. Got in early to Mount Abundance;
found men in a great stew, as they had almost given us up. Determined to start
again <i>at once</i> to try to learn something of poor Charley's fate. Took
another Balonne black named Bobby, a white man named Paddy McEnroe, and Jack
with me (all fully armed and mounted of course), and proceed back to the
deserted cattle station to-night."</p>
<p>The next five days were spent in an ineffectual search for poor Charley,
and, I must also add, in sundry conflicts with the hostile blacks in the
neighbourhood of Blyth's station. We tracked Charley's horse from the place
where we last saw Charley near him, to where we actually came on the horse
grazing quietly with his hobbles still on; and the black, Bobby, maintained
that the horse had <i>fallen</i> in hobbles with Charley on his back, and
pointed out the place; but we could find no traces of Charley
himself&mdash;leaving still the hope, although a very faint one indeed, that he
<i>might</i> have escaped on foot and joined the sheep party below Mount
Abundance, a hope which, alas! was never realised.</p>
<p>Near the camp we came across the horribly mutilated body of a
black&mdash;the face so battered that we could scarcely recognise it; but Bobby
declared, with great lamentations, that it was his poor brother <i>Friday</i>,
whom his neighbours had not spared, though his only offence was that of being
with us and leading our pack-horse. I have since heard from the blacks that
Charley ran for miles after his horse fell with him (in hobbles), and that he
was killed near the Grafton Range.</p>

<p>Up to the end of December was spent by me at Mount Abundance in
superintending the preparations for the return of the whole sheep party and the
superintendent from the junction, in preparations for shearing, and in
collecting the scattered cattle, and those never-ending pests, the working
bullocks. By this time things had got pretty well into their ordinary course
again, and I thought I might with tolerable safety leave the establishment in
charge of the superintendent while I paid a visit to Keera on important
business connected with both establishments. On my journey to Keera, which
occupied about a fortnight, I had special occasion to notice a climatic feature
specially peculiar to the Northern districts of Australia, viz., the partiality
of the rainfall&mdash;here and there green oases of ten to twenty miles in
width, with burned-up deserts on each side.</p>
<p>By the end of January another party (of whose fate I shall have to speak
presently) left Keera <i>en route</i> for Mount Abundance with another herd of
cattle, and, in the middle of February, I myself started for Mount Abundance
with a friend of mine, with whom I proposed to make arrangements for the
management of both establishments during a projected visit of mine to Great
Britain. On our journey to Mount Abundance we passed the cattle party, and
arrived without accident at Mount Abundance by the end of February. On our
arrival "I found everything as wrong as could be expected; shearing not
finished&mdash;no grass to speak of near the Mount&mdash;but sheep still in
good condition from the myal and salt bush they eat." I saw plainly enough that
the matter was too hard for me&mdash;to keep on the sheep establishment at
Mount Abundance during my absence in Great Britain; and the shepherds declared
to a man that they would not remain an hour after their periods of engagement
expired. In vain I told them that I had recently met Mr. J. H. Durbin, the
newly-appointed Commissioner of Crown Lands for the new district (to be called
the Fitzroy Downs or Maranoa District), and that he said I might soon expect to
see him at Mount Abundance with a strong body of police, and that very probably
he would establish his head-quarters near there. It was all in
vain&mdash;perhaps if he had actually been there it might have been
different&mdash;but stay they would not any longer than till the shearing was
over; and, accordingly, on the 13th of March the superintendent started with
all the sheep on the return journey to Keera. I may say, in round numbers, that
my losses in sheep and lambs during these two years, from blacks, losses,
native dogs, and deaths of sheep and young lambs from overcrowding, etc., did
not amount to less than ten thousand; and, consequently, fewer sheep returned
to Keera than left on the 1st of July, 1847.</p>
<p>I determined, however, to keep up Mount Abundance as a <i>cattle</i>
station, which the promise of very high wages, and keeping up an extra number
of men, enabled me to do. Much of the wool had yet to be pressed, and
arrangements made for forwarding it to a seaport&mdash;Brisbane, if possible,
and if not to Newcastle. It was with a very sad heart that I saw the sheep
party start; but I hoped for better times when the Commissioner, with his
police, had established their head-quarters, and that then Mount Abundance
might for the THIRD time be re-established as a great sheep station. But it was
not to be&mdash;in my case, at all events. Things got worse and worse, as will
be seen. Becoming somewhat uneasy from the non-arrival of the cattle party from
Keera, which I had passed so long ago, on the 19th of March I "dispatched
Byrnes (Dublin Jack), the head stockman here, the most resolute man I had, to
meet the cattle party, and to hurry them on."</p>
<p>"Thursday, 22nd March, 1849. At about twelve o'clock <i>two</i> of the
cattle party came galloping in here on horseback, frantic with fear and horror,
bringing the horrible intelligence of the blacks having attacked their party on
the night before, and killed <i>two</i> out of the <i>five</i>, and they
believed <i>three</i>; the third being my poor stockman, Byrnes. The account
they gave of the attack was as follows:&mdash;The party with the cattle had
arrived at XXII. Camp (about twenty miles from Mount Abundance) about one hour
before sunset, horses and cattle quite knocked up, and unable to proceed any
further that day. Four of the party, they said (after their arrival at camp,
and after the horses were turned out), were walking round the cattle and
camping them, the fifth man being left in charge of the camp and the arms, the
whole of these four having been (according to the survivors' account) foolish
enough to leave the camp without arms, and to scatter, themselves about all
round, <i>on foot</i>. Suddenly they heard cries of 'Murder! murder!' at the
camp, and saw a large body of blacks rushing down upon them. Byrnes, the
stockman, who had a pistol, called out, 'Save yourselves&mdash;run for your
lives!' running himself at the same time. By this time, they said, it was dark,
and that they (the survivors, King and Ryan) managed to escape on foot; but the
last they saw of Byrnes, four or five blacks were pursuing him. They said they
walked about for several hours in the bush, not knowing where they were, but at
last they found themselves on the road between XXI. and XXII. Camps in the
middle of the night; that they hid themselves during the night, and in the
morning had gone on the road back to the 'Murder Camp,' where they found the
horses close to the place where the blacks had attacked them, which they
caught; that they then found the bodies of two of the men quite dead, but could
not see anything of Jack (Byrnes), whom they believed was also killed. They
said they found all the herd of cattle just as they left them; that the blacks
had taken away all their clothes, bedding, provisions, etc., but that they
found a couple of riding-saddles and the packsaddles, one of which last they
put over the body of one of the murdered men, and had then ridden as fast as
they were able along the road which they knew must lead to the head station of
Mount Abundance. While they were relating these horrible events, <i>I</i> was
mounting and arming a strong party to proceed to the scene of the murders, to
ascertain the worst, and to go on to the sheep party (lower down the river),
for fear the blacks might have gone straight there and attacked them after the
murders at XXII. Camp. I took with me seven mounted and well-armed white men
and a Balonne black. We were only an hour in getting ready, and thus got off by
about one p.m., leaving five men at the Mount, including the two who had
escaped out of the cattle party. We rode on to XXII. Camp and found the
horrible tale too true, finding the bodies of the two men (McCafferty and Ball)
as they had been described, but could find no signs of the third man, Byrnes.
We also found the cattle and horses just as they had been left. We buried the
two unfortunates in the best way we could, and then proceeded onwards as well
as our tired horses allowed (<i>some</i> of them at least being poor and done
up before starting), and arrived at the sheep party at XIX. Camp, Turanonga
Lagoon, about two hours before daylight on the morning of Friday, 23rd of
March. I had tried a good deal to persuade the party (ordered they would not
be) to camp about nine or ten miles before we reached the sheep, and I said if
they would do so I would <i>myself</i> ride on to the sheep party and put the
superintendent on his guard; and then, if there were any signs of blacks'
fires, I would at once return to them. If not, I would return after waiting at
the sheep camp an hour or two. They one and all said my object in not wanting
them to go with me was for fear they should tell the sheep party of what had
happened, and so alarm them and perhaps make them bolt and desert the sheep;
but promised, if <i>I</i> told the superintendent only, they would not say a
word to any of the men. As I saw they were determined to go whether I let them
or not, I thought it better to allow what I could not prevent."</p>
<p>After seeing the sheep party "through a small scrub on to the open plains
near XVIII. Camp, we ourselves returned to XX. Camp, or rather a few miles
beyond it, on our way back to collect the herd of cattle, and, if possible, to
find out the whereabouts of the blacks. Kept a double watch all night."</p>
<p>The next few days were spent with the double object above referred to, and
to some extent we succeeded. There were still, however, a number of cattle
missing, and I again took to my old habits of solitary exploration when I could
not spare a party to accompany me; but it would appear that on the 29th of
March I had induced one of the survivors of the cattle party to accompany me to
what got the name of the "Murder Camp" (twenty miles from Mount Abundance),
near which we found a number of the scattered cattle, and afterwards lost them
again as it was growing dark; "and I accordingly determined on camping where we
were, to the inexpressible horror and dismay of the man King, who loudly
expressed his fears that he would certainly be killed before morning. I was
unkind enough to laugh at his fears, and insisted on remaining. However, we
kept watch and watch, lighted no fire, and all was quiet till the middle of the
night, when I heard the horse which was tethered break its rope and gallop off
with great violence, the hobbled one following him. I quietly told King that
the horses had seen or heard the blacks, and, taking our arms, we followed in
the direction the horses had taken, which after a mile or two of a walk and a
good hour's search we found; and, as I thought it possible, it had been a false
alarm. To King's utter terror and disgust I returned to our camp, which we had
some difficulty in finding; and as he said he could not sleep another wink I
enjoyed the advantage of a sound sleep till morning, when&mdash;</p>
<p>"Friday, 30th March&mdash;to my great satisfaction the cattle I was in
search of came down to drink. Found another horse, being that of McCafferty,
one of the men who had been killed (a short distance from here), and returned
to Mount Abundance early with the cattle."</p>
<p>The following three weeks were spent in keeping a sharp look-out for our
friends the blacks, in collecting cattle, in preparing the wool&mdash;which was
not entirely packed&mdash;in the invariable business of hunting for working
bullocks (including those of two carriers who had brought up two dray-loads of
provisions and were to take down two loads of wool), and in preparing the hut,
stock-yard fencing, etc., for the use of the men who were to remain; more, so
to speak, to "hold the fort" than to look after the considerable herd of cattle
now on&mdash;or supposed to be on&mdash;the station. As up to this time there
were no news of Mr. Commissioner Durbin and his police, I determined to start
by <i>myself</i> to Hall's station, some seventy miles or more by the road, to
see if I could learn anything about him, and as my journey was a somewhat
adventurous one, I give an extract from my journal:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Saturday, 21st April. At three a.m. I started, armed to the teeth, riding
one horse and leading another to carry my blankets and something to eat, as I
felt confident that from the low condition of my over-worked horses, I should
have to camp one night at least at the junction of the Cogoon and Balonne
Rivers (distant fully fifty miles from Mount Abundance). Breakfasted at XXI.
Camp. Kept my horses saddled close to me, thinking some of my friends might
skulk down the ridge round me. Left about one p.m., being obliged to give my
horses some food and rest. Reached Lake Turanonga, a little beyond XIX. Camp, a
little after sunset. Determined to camp here, having travelled nearly fifty
miles, and my horses weak; but, before doing so, determined to examine all
round to see if there were any traces of blacks. I had seen the track of one
black some hours before. Just as I began my reconnaissance I saw, to my great
annoyance (as my horses were very tired), just at the back of the ridge (on the
edge of the lagoon), some seven or eight fires in a small scrub; but I hoped I
had not gone near enough to alarm the blacks, whom I was in no condition to
face with my tired horses, one of which would not stand fire well. I
accordingly moved off, and doubled and entangled my trail to throw out the
blacks if they followed it, and then went on about four miles in a straight
course. I once thought I saw the glare of fire-sticks behind me, but I was not
sure. I however hoped I had effectually dodged my friends (by spoiling my
trail), and led down my horses to a water-hole near XVIII. Camp to get a drink
and to get one for myself; and then going on a little further, a good way off
water, I short-tethered my horses, and lay down (without fire) for an hour or
two of sleep, which I much required. I might have slept till about midnight,
when I half awoke, and, jumping up, to my considerable disturbance saw one
fire-stick within two to three hundred yards of me, and the glare of several
others. Being only half awake I fancied I had my servant with me, and called to
him in a loud whisper to get up, as the blacks were round us. My own voice
thoroughly awaking me, I immediately remembered where I was, and saddling my
horses and mounting, moved off about three miles further, as near as I could
guess, it being almost dark, as there was no moon. I then sat down, keeping my
horses saddled and close to me till morning. Verily I had cause to thank God
that neither of them had neighed or made any noise while I was asleep, as the
blacks had evidently tracked my horses' footsteps (by aid of flaring
fire-sticks) from the lagoon; but from the crosses and bends in my trail they
had got weary, and laid themselves down on the trail intending to follow it up
in the morning. Had they persevered for three hundred yards further they must
inevitably have caught 'Muckadilla Maaster' (as they called me) napping, and
verily a nice spectacle they would have made of me&mdash;<i>but they have not
got me yet</i>!"</p>
<p>"Sunday, 22nd April, 1849. Started as soon as it was light across the Cogoon
(or Muckadilla, the native name for it) in a south-easterly course, to make the
Balonne. Had to go about eight miles, chiefly through a more or less thick
cypress pine scrub, before I made the river. I made it at a very bad
crossing-place, where there were very steep banks on both sides, and masses of
reeds near the edge of the water; but as the country was close on the right
bank, and the bush on fire in places near me; I strongly suspected either my
friends of last night had been before me, or had sent a messenger to announce
me to another party here. I therefore determined, <i>coute qui coute</i>, to
get across the river into more open forest country while the coast was clear,
and accordingly plunged into the river. Just as I got into mid-stream, which
was not very deep, I heard a 'C-r-r-r-r' in the reeds not very far from me, but
for my life I could not exactly say where. Thinking, however, prudence was the
better part of valour, I dashed at the opposite bank with my horses, although
it was so frightfully steep that under ordinary circumstances I should have
thought I ran a considerable risk of breaking my own neck and those of my
horses (in ascending it). Once on the bank I did not care, as I had the vantage
ground and clear country ahead. I then immediately dismounted, unslung my
double-barrel, and gave a series of shouts to my friends, determined to fire at
the first moving thing I saw in the reeds; but my friends' hearts either failed
them on seeing the advantageous position I had taken up, or they did not feel
themselves in sufficient force to face 'Muckadilla Maaster' <i>awake</i>. In a
couple of miles further I made Hall's road, about thirteen to fourteen miles
from the station. When within about seven miles of the station I met a couple
of Mr. Hall's stockmen, who informed me that Mr. Commissioner Durbin and his
party of police had arrived there three or four weeks before. On arriving at
Mr. Durbin's quarters he was greatly delighted to see me after all the
frightful stories he had heard of the terrible doings at Mount Abundance, and
told me he had been preparing shortly to come up to Mount Abundance with his
police. He promised, if I would wait a day or two here, that he and three of
his policemen would accompany me to the Mount; that he would do what he could
in restoring subordination among my men, and that when we were ready he and his
party would assist in escorting my wool teams safe out of the stronghold of the
Philistines."</p>
<p>There is a good deal of interesting matter in my journal during the next
week, but as my narrative is becoming rather lengthy I must hurry on towards
the conclusion. Suffice it to say, that when we arrived at the Mount we found
things nearly ready for a start, but for the same never-ending
nuisance&mdash;working bullocks. The carriers' two teams were now all found,
but a number of mine had got astray again, and it was impossible to make a
start with the wool till they were recovered; the carriers, however, grumbled
at the delay. I find the following entry in my journal of 30th of April: "We
told the carriers that my drays would start positively on this day week under
the escort of Mr. Durbin's party. The answer the carrier Foley gave was 'that
if he liked to chance his life that I might chance my wool; and that if I did
not give him the wool he could travel all the easier empty.' I certainly felt
that there was some risk, but as he and his mate came up safe before, I thought
that as he said he never intended to take out his bullocks till he got to the
junction (comparatively safe country) that it was well to let them go with the
wool as <i>without</i> it."</p>
<p>Accordingly the two carriers, Foley and Flaherty, started with their two
drays, and two teams of bullocks, and twenty-four bales of wool down the Cogoon
towards the junction, and we were preparing for a start with four drays loaded
with wool, and four teams of bullocks, when on the morning of Sunday, 5th of
May, "one of the cattle herdsmen came galloping in to the head station with the
horrid intelligence that one of Foley's working bullocks which he <i>knew</i>
had come into the herd with a spear in his shoulder. God knows how <i>I</i>
looked, but Durbin turned as white as a sheet, as we both instinctively knew
what had most probably happened, viz., that Foley and his mate had been
attacked and killed; as it was clear that even if the bullock had been speared
when out feeding that the men would have been here before looking for him, as,
from the description, it was one of his leading bullocks, which he could not do
without. Too late to start to-night."</p>
<p>"Sunday, 6th of May. Drizzling rain in the morning. Durbin and myself and
three mounted troopers, and his black, and two of my men, all mounted and
armed, started in the rain this morning, keeping our arms as dry as possible.
The rain ceased after we had got about a dozen miles down the river. We
proceeded along, narrowly examining the ground for traces of blacks or
footmarks of the carriers. We found no signs of either till we got about three
miles below XXII. Camp, when the following horrible scene presented itself to
our view:&mdash;The two drays a little off the road alongside the river; one
close to it with marks of the team having broken from it and dashed down the
bank; the other dray overset and two bullocks dead in the pole, and two more
fastened to it by the chains; the wool bales scattered in all directions, seven
or eight ripped up, the canvas taken away, and the wool scattered in large
piles on the ground; at the back of the dray the horse on his back, and his
body covered with wounds of spears, nulla-nullas, etc. Durbin uttered the
joyful exclamation, 'The men have escaped.' I said, 'Look under the wool.'
Under it&mdash;horrible to relate&mdash;we found the bodies of the two unhappy
men enveloped in piles of wool, mutilated in the most horrible manner, and in a
dreadful state of decomposition&mdash;one of the bodies being wholly stripped,
the other partially so. We also found under the wool their bulldog speared
through the body. Close to the drays we found the extinguished fires of a large
camp of blacks, and the remains of one or two of the bullocks which they had
roasted and eaten on the spot, having apparently camped there the night on
which the murders took place (which was probably last Wednesday). By what we
could observe, the men had <i>not</i> been at camp, but had apparently pulled
up to get a drink in the river, and had either gone down without arms or the
blacks had rushed upon them so suddenly that they had not been able to see
them, as the arms were not discharged. We found the arms and sundry papers,
hobbles, straps, and rags. The provisions and clothes the blacks had taken
away, as also one of the dray tarpaulins. As we had no means of burying the
unhappy men till we returned to Mount Abundance, we determined forthwith to
return there, and to bring back bullocks and an extra dray to bring back the
loose wool&mdash;which, by the way, we found the blacks had made an ineffectual
attempt to burn. Arrived at the Mount at about midnight, where of course the
<i>former</i> state of things among the men was <i>Heaven</i> to what it was
now."</p>
<p>The next day was spent in collecting working bullocks and horses, and on the
following day, Tuesday, May 8th, "got horses, as usual, late, and afterwards as
many working bullocks as were absolutely necessary; but it was late in the day
before we could get off, that is to say, Durbin, myself, his three policemen,
his black boy, and five of my men, eleven in all&mdash;leaving four men at
Mount Abundance&mdash;all of us armed, and most of us mounted. The bullocks
travelling slowly we could only get to Mount Inviting old sheep station
to-night, where we remained till two next morning; but I should mention that
just before we got there we saw the hut in a blaze. It appeared that although
we could make out no signs of the blacks yesterday (the rain having washed out
their tracks), they had not been far from us when we were at the drays. They
had followed us up, and some of them had camped in the hut, the thatch of which
had apparently caught fire during the night, as we found where they had made a
fire in the corner of the hut, and where they had broken a hole in the chimney
in their hurry to get out when the burning roof fell in on them. I fear I
should have been tempted to suggest to them not to hurry themselves had I been
there when it occurred. We sat down and rested ourselves 'by my own fireside'
till the moon rose, and&mdash;</p>
<p>"Wednesday, 9th May, at two a.m., we started by moonlight, Durbin and I
keeping ahead in hopes of seeing fires or other signs of our friends near the
river, and keeping beyond the noise of the drays and bullocks. We were quite
confident our friends were in the neighbourhood, although where we could not
exactly say. By a little after sunrise we reached the 'Murder Camp' (which
might well be so called, as within two months it and its immediate
neighbourhood had been the scene of <i>five</i> murders) and buried the two
poor men, over whom Durbin read prayers, keeping a mounted patrol of two men to
mind the horses and working bullocks, and to keep a look-out in case the blacks
might be lurking about in force. After burying the bodies we breakfasted, and
then commenced loading the loose wool as best we could. I do not think I ever
worked so hard in my life as I worked to-day while it lasted, and I must do my
men the justice to say they worked pretty well too. The wool was wet by the
recent heavy rain, and the whole atmosphere was polluted by the vapours from
the corpses and the carrion of the dead bullocks and the horse; and although we
had them dragged away by the other bullocks, the wool and everything round
exhaled ghastly odours of the charnel house. By dint of very hard work, at
half-past three p.m. we had everything packed up as well as we were able, and
ready to start again; but from the wetness of the wool and the heaviness of the
loads, and the short number and intractableness of the bullocks, it was past
midnight again before we reached the burned down sheep-station hut. It may be
imagined hardly a man of the party was able to keep his eyes open. Although the
men had a little sleep last night Durbin and I had none, and we have now had
forty-two hours of it straight off."</p>
<p>"Thursday, 10th May. Started at day-dawn to get the jaded horses and working
bullocks home to the Mount in order to let the latter out to grass, as they
have hardly had a mouthful to eat since the day before yesterday. Got to the
Mount early in the day."</p>
<p>The remainder of the month of May, as my doleful journal records, was spent
in making preparations to remove the wool down to Hall's station, where Mr.
Durbin had resolved to establish his head-quarters&mdash;for some time to come,
at all events. He remained at Mount Abundance all this time, and volunteered
(with his police) to escort my drays down when they were ready to start; and
even now I cannot refrain from expressing the great personal obligations I felt
myself under to him in the very difficult situation in which I was placed. He
certainly not only did his duty as a public servant, but a great deal more than
his duty.</p>
<p>It will be seen throughout this doleful narrative that no small portion of
my difficulties arose from losses and deaths of WORKING BULLOCKS. Transport of
produce and provisions was in those days&mdash;in the far interior, at all
events&mdash;as great a difficulty with pioneer squatters as provisioning an
army in a hostile country is with the Commissariat Department.</p>
<p>If those people who lived at home at ease and were always abusing the
Transport Service during the days of the Crimean War, and a later generation of
the same kind of critics who are now speaking their minds as to deficiencies in
the Transport Service in connection with the Afghan and Zulu Wars&mdash;if any
of these people had ever had any experience in forming a new station in the far
interior of Australia&mdash;perhaps they would be somewhat milder in their
denunciations of a branch of the military service of Great Britain which is
naturally kept at a low ebb in time of peace, and is necessarily overstrained
and overworked in time of war.</p>
<p>This is certainly rather a digression from my narrative of my fortunes, or
rather my misfortunes, at Mount Abundance; but I resume by saying that prior to
our departure I made up my mind that for some years to come&mdash;that is,
until the country between the Mount and Darling Downs became occupied by
squatters&mdash;I would only occupy the Mount as a cattle station, keeping what
was left of my sheep at Keera till quieter times. I left a sufficient amount of
men at Mount Abundance to keep possession, and then Mr. Durbin and I proceeded
on our journey to more civilised country after we had seen the drays with their
loads safe at his head-quarters. Shortly afterwards, for a consideration no
doubt, he induced another Commissioner of Crown Lands to exchange with him, and
I do not think he ever again visited the somewhat dangerous neighbourhood of
Mount Abundance.</p>
<p>I myself not very long afterwards returned to look after my patrimonial
acres at the foot of the Grampians in fair Perthshire, not very long after
married, and remained in Scotland till the middle of 1856.</p>
<p>During the interval the Keera station and the Mount Abundance station had
been carried on as such properties very frequently <i>are</i> carried on where
the owner is at the other end of the world&mdash;that is, very expensively and
very unprofitably. I felt it necessary to return to Australia to see how
matters were going on. What we did during our two years' absence, is it not
chronicled in a little book written by my wife on our return to Scotland,
called, "My Experiences in Australia, by a Lady"?</p>
<p>During our stay at my old head station of Keera, I found that, although
Mount Abundance was not <i>quite</i> such a dangerous place of abode as during
<i>my</i> time there, still it was <i>not</i> a place to which to take a young
wife and children; and accordingly after a good deal of consideration I
resolved to part with all my pastoral property in Australia for anything I
could get for it, and to return for good to the old country.</p>
<p>I have heard quite recently that my old station of the Mount is at the
present time in the hands of a company belonging to Aberdeen, and is producing
an enormous income to its present possessors; thus my toils, troubles, and
dangers as a Pioneer are only another proof of the truth of the proverb,
"<i>Sic vos non vobis</i>!"</p>
<p>I am now verging towards the period of the "<i>sere and yellow</i>." I have
several sons to start in life, and as that battle gets year by year harder and
yet more hard for those who have not much to rely on but their own energy in
fighting it, I cannot help feeling sometimes a pang of regret that, while I was
yet in the prime and vigour of life, I parted for a song with my beautiful
station of Mount Abundance.</p>
