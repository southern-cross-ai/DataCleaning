    The Kangaroo Finds Dot</b></h2>
  <p>Little Dot had lost her way in the bush. She knew it, and was very frightened.</p>
  <p>She was too frightened in fact to cry, but stood in the middle of a little
    dry, bare space, looking around her at the scraggy growths of prickly shrubs
    that had torn her little dress to rags, scratched her bare legs and feet
    till they bled, and pricked her hands and arms as she had pushed madly through
    the bushes, for hours, seeking her home. Sometimes she looked up to the sky.
    But little of it could be seen because of the great tall trees that seemed
    to her to be trying to reach heaven with their far-off crooked branches.
    She could see little patches of blue sky between the tangled tufts of drooping
    leaves, and, as the dazzling sunlight had faded, she began to think it was
    getting late, and that very soon it would be night.</p>
  <p>The thought of being lost and alone in the wild bush at night, took her
    breath away with fear, and made her tired little legs tremble under her.
    She gave up all hope of finding her home, and sat down at the foot of the
    biggest blackbutt tree, with her face buried in her hands and knees, and
    thought of all that had happened, and what might happen yet.</p>
  <p>It seemed such a long, long time since her mother had told her that she
    might gather some bush flowers while she cooked the dinner, and Dot recollected
    how she was bid not to go out of sight of the cottage. How she wished now
    she had remembered this sooner! But whilst she was picking the pretty flowers,
    a hare suddenly started at her feet and sprang away into the bush, and she
    had run after it. When she found that she could not catch the hare, she discovered
    that she could no longer see the cottage. After wandering for a while she
    got frightened and ran, and ran, little knowing that she was going further
    away from her home at every step.</p>
  <p>Where she was sitting under the blackbutt tree, she was miles away from
    her father&rsquo;s selection, and it would be very difficult for anyone to
    find her. She felt that she was a long way off, and she began to think of
    what was happening at home. She remembered how, not very long ago, a neighbour&rsquo;s
    little boy had been lost, and how his mother had come to their cottage for
    help to find him, and that her father had ridden off on the big bay horse
    to bring men from all the selections around to help in the search. She remembered
    their coming back in the darkness; numbers of strange men she had never seen
    before. Old men, young men, and boys, all on their rough-coated horses, and
    how they came indoors, and what a noise they made all talking together in
    their big deep voices. They looked terrible men, so tall and brown and fierce,
    with their rough bristly beards; and they all spoke in such funny tones to
    her, as if they were trying to make their voices small.</p>
  <p>During many days, these men came and went, and every time they were more
    sad, and less noisy. The little boy&rsquo;s mother used to come and stay,
    crying, whilst the men were searching the bush for her little son. Then,
    one evening, Dot&rsquo;s father came home alone, and both her mother and
    the little boy&rsquo;s mother went away in a great hurry. Then, very late,
    her mother came back crying, and her father sat smoking by the fire looking
    very sad, and she never saw that little boy again, although he had been found.</p>
  <p>She wondered now if all these rough, big men were riding into the bush to
    find her, and if, after many days, they would find her, and no one ever see
    her again. She seemed to see her mother crying, and her father very sad,
    and all the men very solemn. These thoughts made her so miserable that she
    began to cry herself.</p>
  <p>Dot does not know how long she was sobbing in loneliness and fear, with
    her head on her knees, and with her little hands covering her eyes so as
    not to see the cruel wild bush in which she was lost. It seemed a long time
    before she summoned up courage to uncover her weeping eyes, and look once
    more at the bare, dry earth, and the wilderness of scrub and trees that seemed
    to close her in as if she were in a prison. When she did look up, she was
    surprised to see that she was no longer alone. She forgot all her trouble
    and fear in her astonishment at seeing a big grey Kangaroo squatting quite
    close to her, in front of her.</p>
  <p>What was most surprising was the fact that the Kangaroo evidently understood
    that Dot was in trouble, and was sorry for her; for down the animal&rsquo;s
    nice soft grey muzzle two tiny little tears were slowly trickling. When Dot
    looked up at it with wonder in her round blue eyes, the Kangaroo did not
    jump away, but remained gazing sympathetically at Dot with a slightly puzzled
    air. Suddenly the big animal seemed to have an idea, and it lightly hopped
    off into the scrub, where Dot could just see it bobbing up and down as if
    it were hunting for something. Presently back came the strange Kangaroo with
    a spray of berries in her funny black hands. They were pretty berries. Some
    were green, some were red, some blue, and others white. Dot was quite glad
    to take them when the Kangaroo offered them to her; and as this friendly
    animal seemed to wish her to eat them, she did so gladly, because she was
    beginning to feel hungry.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><img src="0900681h-images/page003.jpg" width="582" height="750"></h3>
  <p>After she had eaten a few berries a very strange thing happened. While Dot
    had been alone in the bush it had all seemed so dreadfully still. There had
    been no sound but the gentle stir of a light, fitful breeze in the far-away
    tree-tops. All around had been so quiet, that her loneliness had seemed twenty
    times more lonely. Now, however, under the influence of these small, sweet
    berries, Dot was surprised to hear voices everywhere. At first it seemed
    like hearing sounds in a dream, they were so faint and distant, but soon
    the talking grew nearer and nearer, louder and clearer, until the whole bush
    seemed filled with talking.</p>
  <p>They were all little voices, some indeed quite tiny whispers and squeaks,
    but they were very numerous, and seemed to be everywhere. They came from
    the earth, from the bushes, from the trees, and from the very air. The little
    girl looked round to see where they came from, but everything looked just
    the same. Hundreds of ants, of all kinds and sizes, were hurrying to their
    nests; a few lizards were scuttling about amongst the dry twigs and sparse
    grasses; there were some grasshoppers, and in the trees birds fluttered to
    and fro. Then Dot knew that she was hearing, and understanding, everything
    that was being said by all the insects and creatures in the bush.</p>
  <p>All this time the Kangaroo had been speaking, only Dot had been too surprised
    to listen. But now the gentle, soft voice of the kind animal caught her attention,
    and she found the Kangaroo was in the middle of a speech.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I understood what was the matter with you at once,&rdquo; she was
    saying, &ldquo;for I feel just the same myself. I have been miserable, like
    you, ever since I lost my baby Kangaroo. You also must have lost something.
    Tell me what it is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost my way,&rdquo; said Dot; rather wondering if the
    Kangaroo would understand her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the Kangaroo, quite delighted at her own cleverness, &ldquo;I
    knew you had lost something! Isn&rsquo;t it a dreadful feeling? You feel
    as if you had no inside, don&rsquo;t you? And you&rsquo;re not inclined to
    eat anything&mdash;not even the youngest grass. I have been like that ever
    since I lost my baby Kangaroo. Now tell me,&rdquo; said the creature confidentially, &ldquo;what
    your way is like. I may be able to find it for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dot found that she must explain what she meant by saying she had &ldquo;lost
    her way,&rdquo; and the Kangaroo was much interested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she, after listening to the little girl, &ldquo;that
    is just like you Humans; you are not fit for this country at all! Of course,
    if you have only one home in one place, you must lose it! If you made your
    home everywhere and anywhere, it would never be lost. Humans are no good
    in our bush,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;Just look at yourself now. How
    do you compare with a Kangaroo? There is your ridiculous sham coat. Well,
    you have lost bits of it all the way you have come to-day, and you&rsquo;re
    nearly left in your bare skin. Now look at my coat. I&rsquo;ve done ever
    so much more hopping than you to-day, and you see I&rsquo;m none the worse.
    I wonder why all your fur grows upon the top of your head,&rdquo; she said
    reflectively, as she looked curiously at Dot&rsquo;s long flaxen curls. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
    such a silly place to have one&rsquo;s fur the thickest! You see, we have
    very little there; for we don&rsquo;t want our heads made any hotter under
    the Australian sun. See how much better off you would be, now that nearly
    all your sham coat is gone, if that useless fur had been chopped into little,
    short lengths and spread all over your poor bare body. I wonder why you Humans
    are made so badly,&rdquo; she ended, with a puzzled air.</p>
  <p>Dot felt for a moment as if she ought to apologise for being so unfit for
    the bush, and for having all the fur on the top of her head. But, somehow,
    she had an idea that a little girl must be something better than a kangaroo,
    although the Kangaroo certainly seemed a very superior person; so she said
    nothing, but again began to eat the berries.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must not eat any more of these berries,&rdquo; said the Kangaroo,
    anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Dot, &ldquo;they are very nice, and I&rsquo;m very
    hungry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Kangaroo gently took the spray out of Dot&rsquo;s hand, and threw it
    away. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if you eat too many of them,
    you&rsquo;ll know too much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One can&rsquo;t know too much,&rdquo; argued the little girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes you can, though,&rdquo; said the Kangaroo, quickly. &ldquo;If
    you eat too many of those berries, you&rsquo;ll learn too much, and that
    gives you indigestion, and then you become miserable. I don&rsquo;t want
    you to be miserable any more, for I&rsquo;m going to find your lost way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The mention of finding her way reminded the little girl of her sad position,
    which, in her wonder at talking with the Kangaroo, had been quite forgotten
    for a little while. She became sad again; and seeing how dim the light was
    getting, her thoughts went back to her parents. She longed to be with them
    to be kissed and cuddled, and her blue eyes filled with tears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your eyes just now remind me of two fringed violets, with the morning
    dew on them, or after a shower,&rdquo; said the Kangaroo. &ldquo;Why are
    you crying?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was thinking,&rdquo; said Dot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t think!&rdquo; pleaded the Kangaroo; &ldquo;I never
    do myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it!&rdquo; explained the little girl. &ldquo;What
    do you do instead?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I always jump to conclusions,&rdquo; said the Kangaroo, and she promptly
    bounded ten feet at one hop. Lightly springing back again to her position
    in front of the child, she added, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s why I never have
    a headache.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear Kangaroo,&rdquo; said Dot, &ldquo;do you know where I can get
    some water? I&rsquo;m very thirsty!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course you are,&rdquo; said her friend; &ldquo;everyone is at
    sundown. I&rsquo;m thirsty myself. But the nearest water-hole is a longish
    way off, so we had better start at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Little Dot got up with an effort. After her long run and fatigue, she was
    very stiff, and her little legs were so tired and weak, that after a few
    steps she staggered and fell.</p>
  <p>The Kangaroo looked at the child compassionately. &ldquo;Poor little Human,&rdquo; she
    said, &ldquo;your legs aren&rsquo;t much good, and, for the life of me, I
    don&rsquo;t understand how you can expect to get along without a tail. The
    water-hole is a good way off,&rdquo; she added, with a sigh, as she looked
    down at Dot, lying on the ground, and she was very puzzled what to do. But
    suddenly she brightened up. &ldquo;I have an idea,&rdquo; she said joyfully. &ldquo;Just
    step into my pouch, and I&rsquo;ll hop you down to the water-hole in less
    time than it takes a locust to shrill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Timidly and carefully, Dot did the Kangaroo&rsquo;s bidding, and found herself
    in the cosiest, softest little bag imaginable. The Kangaroo seemed overjoyed
    when Dot was comfortably settled in her pouch. &ldquo;I feel as if I had
    my dear baby kangaroo again!&rdquo; she exclaimed; and immediately she bounded
    away through the tangled scrub, over stones and bushes, over dry water-courses
    and great fallen trees. All Dot felt was a gentle rocking motion, and a fresh
    breeze in her face, which made her so cheerful that she sang this song:&mdash;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to go quick,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will tell you a trick<br>
    For the bush, where there isn&rsquo;t a train.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a hulla-buloo,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail a big kangaroo&mdash;<br>
    But be sure that your weight she&rsquo;ll sustain&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then with hop, and with skip,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She will take you a trip<br>
    With the speed of the very best steed;<br>
    And, this is a truth for which I can vouch,<br>
    There&rsquo;s no carriage can equal a kangaroo&rsquo;s pouch.<br>
    Oh! where is a friend so strong and true<br>
    As a dear big, bounding kangaroo?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Good bye! Good bye!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lizards all cry,<br>
    Each drying its eyes with its tail.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Adieu! Adieu!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear kangaroo!&rdquo;<br>
    The scared little grasshoppers wail.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;They&rsquo;re going express<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a distant address,&rdquo;<br>
    Says the bandicoot, ready to scoot;<br>
    And your path is well cleared for your progress, I vouch,<br>
    When you ride through the bush in a kangaroo&rsquo;s pouch.<br>
    Oh! where is a friend so strong and true<br>
    As a dear big, bounding kangaroo?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Away and away!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will certainly say,<br>
  &ldquo;To the end of the furthest blue&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the verge of the sky,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the far hills high,<br>
    O take me with thee, kangaroo!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will seek for the end,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the broad plains tend,<br>
    E&rsquo;en as far as the evening star.<br>
    Why, the end of the world we can reach, I vouch,<br>
    Dear kangaroo, with me in your pouch.&rdquo;<br>
    Oh! where is a friend so strong and true<br>
    As a dear big, bounding kangaroo? </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter 2<br>
    So Thirsty and so Frightened</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;That is a nice song of yours.&rdquo; said the Kangaroo, &ldquo;and
    I like it very much, but please stop singing now, as we are getting near
    the waterhole, for it&rsquo;s not etiquette to make a noise near water at
    sundown.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dot would have asked why everything must be so quiet; but as she peeped
    out, she saw that the Kangaroo was making a very dangerous descent, and she
    did not like to trouble her friend with questions just then. They seemed
    to be going down to a great deep gully that looked almost like a hole in
    the earth, the depth was so great, and the hills around came so closely together.
    The way the Kangaroo was hopping was like going down the side of a wall.
    Huge rocks were tumbled about here and there. Some looked as if they would
    come rolling down upon them; and others appeared as if a little jolt would
    send them crashing and tumbling into the darkness below. Where the Kangaroo
    found room to land on its feet after each bound puzzled Dot, for there seemed
    no foothold anywhere. It all looked so dangerous to the little girl that
    she shut her eyes, so as not to see the terrible places they bounded over,
    or rested on: she felt sure that the Kangaroo must lose her balance, or hop
    just a little too far or a little too near, and that they would fall together
    over the side of that terrible wild cliff. At last she said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Kangaroo, shall we get safely to the bottom do you think?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I never think,&rdquo; said the Kangaroo, &ldquo;but I know we shall.
    This is the easiest way. If I went through the thick bush on the other side,
    I should stand a chance of running my head against a tree at every leap,
    unless I got a stiff neck with holding my head on one side looking out of
    one eye all the time. My nose gets in the way when I look straight in front,&rdquo; she
    explained. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I know
    every jump of the way. We kangaroos have gone this way ever since Australia
    began to have kangaroos. Look here!&rdquo; she said, pausing on a big boulder
    that hung right over the gully, &ldquo;we have made a history book for ourselves
    out of these rocks; and so long as these rocks last, long long after the
    time when there will be no more kangaroos, and no more humans, the sun, and
    the moon, and the stars will look down upon what we have traced on these
    stones.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dot peered out from her little refuge in the Kangaroo&rsquo;s pouch, and
    saw the glow of the twilight sky reflected on the top of the boulder. The
    rough surface of the stone shone with a beautiful polish like a looking glass,
    for the rock had been rubbed for thousands of years by the soft feet and
    tails of millions of kangaroos: kangaroos that had hopped down that way to
    get water. When Dot saw that, she didn&rsquo;t know why it all seemed solemn,
    or why she felt such a very little girl. She was a little sad, and the Kangaroo,
    after a short sigh, continued her way.</p>
  <p>As they neared the bottom of the gully the Kangaroo became extremely cautious.
    She no longer hopped in the open, but made her way with little leaps through
    the thick scrub. She peeped out carefully before each movement. Her long
    soft ears kept moving to catch every sound, and her black sensitive little
    nose was constantly lifted, sniffing the air. Every now and then she gave
    little backward starts, as if she were going to retreat by the way she had
    come, and Dot, with her face pressed against the Kangaroo&rsquo;s soft furry
    coat, could hear her heart beating so fast that she knew she was very frightened.</p>
  <p>They were not alone. Dot could hear whispers from unseen little creatures
    everywhere in the scrub, and from birds in the trees. High up in the branches
    were numbers of pigeons&mdash;sweet little Bronze-Wings; and above all the
    other sounds she could hear their plaintive voices crying, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
    so frightened! we&rsquo;re so frightened! so thirsty and so frightened! so
    thirsty and so frightened!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they drink at the waterhole?&rdquo; whispered Dot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because they&rsquo;re frightened,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Frightened of what?&rdquo; asked Dot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humans!&rdquo; said the Kangaroo, in frightened tones; and as she
    spoke she reared up upon her long legs and tail, so that she stood at least
    six feet high, and peeped over the bushes; her nose working all round, and
    her ears wagging.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s safe,&rdquo; she said, as she squatted down again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Friend Kangaroo,&rdquo; said a Bronze-Wing that had sidled out to
    the end of a neighbouring branch, &ldquo;you are so courageous, will you
    go first to the water, and let us know if it is all safe? We haven&rsquo;t
    tasted a drop of water for two days,&rdquo; she said, sadly, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;re
    dying of thirst. Last night, when we had waited for hours, to make certain
    there were no cruel Humans about, we flew down for a drink&mdash;and we wanted,
    oh! so little, just three little sips; but the terrible Humans, with their &lsquo;bang-bangs,&rsquo; murdered
    numbers of us. Then we flew back, and some were hurt and bleeding, and died
    of their wounds, and none of us have dared to get a drink since.&rdquo; Dot
    could see that the poor pigeon was suffering great thirst, for its wings
    were drooping, and its poor dry beak was open.</p>
  <p>The Kangaroo was very distressed at hearing the pigeon&rsquo;s story. &ldquo;It
    is dreadful for you pigeons,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;because you can only
    drink at evening; we sometimes can quench our thirst in the day. I wish we
    could do without water! The Humans know all the water-holes, and sooner or
    later we all get murdered, or die of thirst. How cruel they are!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Still the pigeons cried on, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re so thirsty and so frightened;&rdquo;  and
    the Bronze-Wing asked the Kangaroo to try again, if she could either smell
    or hear a Human near the water-hole.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think we are safe,&rdquo; said the Kangaroo, having sniffed and
    listened as before; &ldquo;I will now try a nearer view.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The news soon spread that the Kangaroo was going to venture near the water,
    to see if all was safe. The light was very dim, and there was a general whisper
    that the attempt to get a drink of water should not be left later; as some
    feared such foes as dingos and night birds, should they venture into the
    open space at night. As the Kangaroo moved stealthily forward, pushing aside
    the branches of the scrub, or standing erect to peep here and there, there
    was absolute silence in the bush. Even the pigeons ceased to say they were
    afraid, but hopped silently from bough to bough, following the movements
    of the Kangaroo with eager little eyes. The Brush Turkey and the Mound-Builder
    left their heaped-up nests and joined the other thirsty creatures, and only
    by the crackling of the dry scrub, or the falling of a few leaves, could
    one tell that so many live creatures were together in that wild place.</p>
  <p>Presently the Kangaroo had reached the last bushes of the scrub, behind
    which she crouched.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a smell or a sound,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Get
    out, Dot, and wait here until I return, and the Bronze-Wings have had their
    drink; for, did they see you, they would be too frightened to come down,
    and would have to wait another night and day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dot got out of the pouch, and she was very sorry when she saw how terrified
    her friend looked. She could see the fur on the Kangaroo&rsquo;s chest moving
    with the frightened beating of her heart; and her beautiful brown eyes looked
    wild and strange with fear.</p>
  <p>Instantly, the Kangaroo leaped into the open. For a second she paused erect,
    sniffing and listening, and then she hastened to the water. As she stooped
    to drink, Dot heard a &ldquo;whrr, whrr, whrr,&rdquo; and, like falling leaves,
    down swept the Bronze-Wings. It was a wonderful sight. The water-hole shone
    in the dim light, with the great black darkness of the trees surrounding
    it, and from all parts came the thirsty creatures of the bush. The Bronze-Wings
    were all together. Hundreds of little heads bobbed by the edge of the pool,
    as the little bills were filled, and the precious water was swallowed; then,
    together, a minute afterwards, &ldquo;whrr, whrr, whrr,&rdquo; up they flew,
    and in one great sweeping circle they regained their tree tops. Like the
    bush creatures, Dot also was frightened, and running to the water, hurriedly
    drank, and fled back to the shelter of the bush, where the Kangaroo was waiting
    for her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jump in!&rdquo; said the Kangaroo, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s never safe by
    the water,&rdquo; and, a minute after, Dot was again in the cosy pouch, and
    was hurrying away, like all the others, from the water where men are wont
    to camp, and kill with their guns the poor creatures that come to drink.</p>
  <p>That evening the Kangaroo tried to persuade Dot to eat some grass, but as
    Dot said she had never eaten grass, it got some roots from a friendly Bandicoot,
    which the little girl ate because she was hungry; but she thought she wouldn&rsquo;t
    like to be a Bandicoot always to eat such food. Then in a nice dry cave she
    nestled into the fur of the gentle Kangaroo, and was so tired that she slept
    immediately.</p>
  <p>She only woke up once. She had been dreaming that she was at home, and was
    playing with the new little Calf that had come the day before she was lost,
    and she couldn&rsquo;t remember, at first waking, what had happened, or where
    she was. It was dark in the cave, and outside the bushes and trees looked
    quite black&mdash;for there was but little light in that place from the starry
    sky. It seemed terribly lonesome and wild. When the Kangaroo spoke she remembered
    every thing, and they both sat up and talked a little.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mo-poke! mo-poke!&rdquo; sang the Nightjar in the distance. &ldquo;I
    wish the Nightjar wouldn&rsquo;t make that noise when one wants to sleep,&rdquo; said
    the Kangaroo. &ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t got any voice to speak of, and the tune
    is stupid. It gives me the jim-jams, for it reminds me I&rsquo;ve lost my
    baby Kangaroo. There is something wrong about some birds that think themselves
    musical,&rdquo; she continued: &ldquo;they are well behaved and considerate
    enough in the day, but as soon as it is a nice, quiet, calm night, or a bit
    of a moon is in the sky, they make night hideous to everyone within ear-shot&mdash;&rsquo;Mo-poke!
    mo-poke!&rsquo; Oh! it gives me the blues!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As the Kangaroo spoke she hopped to the front of the cave.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I say, Nightjar,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a little sad to-night,
    please go and sing elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the Nightjar, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad I&rsquo;ve
    given you deliciously dismal thoughts with my song! I&rsquo;m a great artist,
    and can touch all hearts. That is my mission in the world: when all the bush
    is quiet, and everyone has time to be miserable, I make them more so&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
    it lovely to be like that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather you sang something cheerful,&rdquo; said the Kangaroo
    to herself, but out loud she said, &ldquo;I find it really too beautiful,
    it is more than I can bear. Please go a little further off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mo-poke! mo-poke!!&rdquo; croaked the Nightjar, further and further
    in the distance, as it flew away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What a pity!&rdquo; said the Kangaroo, as she returned to the cave, &ldquo;the
    Possum made that unlucky joke of telling the Nightjar it has a touching voice,
    and can sing: everyone has to suffer for that joke of the Possum&rsquo;s.
    It doesn&rsquo;t matter to him, for he is awake all night, but it is too
    bad for his neighbours who want to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Just then there arose from the bush a shrill wailing and shrieking that
    made Dot&rsquo;s heart stop with fear. It sounded terrible, as if something
    was wailing in great pain and suffering.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh Kangaroo!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;what is the matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said
    the Kangaroo, as she laid herself down to rest, &ldquo;is the sound of the
    Curlew enjoying itself. They are sociable birds, and entertain a great deal.
    There is a party to-night, I suppose, and that is the expression of their
    enjoyment. I believe,&rdquo; she continued, with a suppressed yawn, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
    not so painful as it sounds. Willy Wagtail, who goes a great deal amongst
    Humans, says they do that sort of thing also; he has often heard them when
    he lived near the town.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dot had never been in the town, but she was certain she had never heard
    anything like the Curlew&rsquo;s wailing in her home; and she wondered what
    Willy Wagtail meant, but she was too sleepy to ask: so she nestled a little
    closer to the Kangaroo, and with the shrieking of the Curlews, and the mournful
    note of the distant Mo-poke in her ears, she fell asleep again.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter 3<br>
    The Kookoobura and the Snake</b></h2>
  <p>When Dot awoke, she did so with a start of fear. Something in her sleep
    had seemed to tell her that she was in danger. At a first glance she saw
    that the Kangaroo had left her, and coiled upon her body was a young black
    Snake. Before Dot could move, she heard a voice from a tree, outside the
    cave, say, very softly, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid! Keep quite still, and
    you will not get hurt. Presently I&rsquo;ll kill that Snake. If I tried to
    do so now it might bite you; so let it sleep on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She looked up in the direction of the tree, and saw a big Kookooburra perched
    on a bough, with all the creamy feathers of its breast fluffed out, and its
    crest very high. The Kookooburra is one of the jolliest birds in the bush,
    and is always cracking jokes, and laughing, but this one was keeping as quiet
    as he could. Still he could not be quite serious, and a smile played all
    round his huge beak. Dot could see that he was nearly bursting with suppressed
    laughter. He kept on saying, under his breath, &ldquo;what a joke this is!
    What a capital joke! How they&rsquo;ll all laugh when I tell them.&rdquo; Just
    as if it was the funniest thing in the world to have a Snake coiled up on
    one&rsquo;s body&mdash;when the horrid thing might bite one with its poisonous
    fangs, at any moment!</p>
  <p>Dot said she didn&rsquo;t see any joke, and it was no laughing matter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To be sure <i>you</i> don&rsquo;t see the joke,&rdquo; said the jovial
    bird. &ldquo;On-lookers always see the jokes, and I&rsquo;m an on-looker.
    It&rsquo;s not to be expected of you, because you&rsquo;re not an on-looker;&rdquo;  and
    he shook with suppressed laughter again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where is my dear Kangaroo?&rdquo; asked Dot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She has gone to get you some berries for breakfast,&rdquo; said the
    Kookooburra, &ldquo;and she asked me to look after you, and that&rsquo;s
    why I&rsquo;m here. That Snake got on you whilst I flew away to consult my
    doctor, the White Owl, about the terrible indigestion I have. He&rsquo;s
    very difficult to catch awake; for he&rsquo;s out all night and sleepy all
    day. He says cockchafers have caused it. The horny wing-cases and legs are
    most indigestible, he assures me. I didn&rsquo;t fancy them much when I ate
    them last night, so I took his advice and coughed them up, and I&rsquo;m
    no longer feeling depressed. Take my advice, and don&rsquo;t eat cockchafers,
    little Human.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dot did not really hear all this, nor heed the excellent advice of the Kookooburra,
    not to eat those hard green beetles that had disagreed with it, for a little
    shivering movement had gone through the Snake, and presently all the scales
    of its shining black back and rosy underpart began to move. Dot felt quite
    sick, as she saw the reptile begin to uncoil itself, as it lay upon her.
    She hardly dared to breathe, but lay as still as if she were dead, so as
    not to frighten or anger the horrid creature, which presently seemed to slip
    like a slimy cord over her bare little legs, and wriggled away to the entrance
    of the cave.</p>
  <p>With a quick, delighted movement, she sat up, eager to see where the deadly
    Snake would go. It was very drowsy, having slept heavily on Dot&rsquo;s warm
    little body; so it went slowly towards the bush, to get some frogs or birds
    for breakfast. But as it wriggled into the warm morning sunlight outside,
    Dot saw a sight that made her clap her hands together with anxiety for the
    life of the jolly Kookooburra.</p>
  <p>No sooner did the black Snake get outside the cave, than she saw the Kookooburra
    fall like a stone from its branch, right on top of the Snake. For a second,
    Dot thought the bird must have tumbled down dead, it was such a sudden fall;
    but a moment later she saw it flutter on the ground, in battle with the poisonous
    reptile, whilst the Snake wriggled, and coiled its body into hoops and rings.
    The Kookooburra&rsquo;s strong wings, beating the air just above the writhing
    Snake, made a great noise, and the serpent hissed in its fierce hatred and
    anger. Then Dot saw that the Kookooburra&rsquo;s big beak had a firm hold
    of the Snake by the back of the neck, and that it was trying to fly upwards
    with its enemy. In vain the dreadful creature tried to bite the gallant bird;
    in vain it hissed and stuck out its wicked little spiky tongue; in vain it
    tried to coil itself round the bird&rsquo;s body; the Kookooburra was too
    strong and too clever to lose its hold, or to let the Snake get power over
    it.</p>
  <p>At last Dot saw that the Snake was getting weak, for, little by little,
    the Kookooburra was able to rise higher with it, until it reached the high
    bough. All the time the Snake was held in the bird&rsquo;s beak, writhing
    and coiling in agony; for he knew that the Kookooburra had won the battle.
    But, when the noble bird had reached its perch, it did a strange thing; for
    it dropped the Snake right down to the ground. Then it flew down again, and
    brought the reptile back to the bough, and dropped it once more&mdash;and
    this it did many times. Each time the Snake moved less and less, for its
    back was being broken by these falls. At last the Kookooburra flew up with
    its victim for the last time, and, holding it on the branch with its foot,
    beat the serpent&rsquo;s head with its great strong beak. Dot could hear
    the blows fall,&mdash;whack, whack, whack,&mdash;as the beak smote the Snake&rsquo;s
    head; first on one side, then on the other, until it lay limp and dead across
    the bough.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! ah! ah! Ah! ah! ah!&rdquo; laughed the Kookooburra, and said
    to Dot, &ldquo;Did you see all that? Wasn&rsquo;t it a joke? What a capital
    joke! Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! Oh! oh! oh! How my sides do ache! What a joke!
    How they&rsquo;ll laugh when I tell them.&rdquo; Then came a great flight
    of kookooburras, for they had heard the laughter, and all wanted to know
    what the joke was. Proudly the Kookooburra told them all about the Snake
    sleeping on Dot, and the great fight! All the time, first one kookooburra,
    and then another, chuckled over the story, and when it came to an end every
    bird dropped its wings, cocked up its tail, and throwing back its head, opened
    its great beak, and laughed uproariously together. Dot was nearly deafened
    with the noise; for some chuckled, some cackled; some said, &ldquo;Ha! ha!
    ha!&rdquo; others said, &ldquo;Oh! oh! oh!&rdquo; and as soon as one left
    off, another began, until it seemed as though they couldn&rsquo;t stop. They
    all said it was a splendid joke, and that they really must go and tell it
    to the whole bush. So they flew away, and far and near, for hours, the bush
    echoed with chuckling and cackling, and wild bursts of laughter, as the kookooburras
    told that grand joke everywhere.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the Kookooburra, when all the others had gone, &ldquo;a
    bit of snake is just the right thing for breakfast. Will you have some, little
    Human?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dot shuddered at the idea of eating snake for breakfast, and the Kookooburra
    thought she was afraid of being poisoned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t hurt you,&rdquo; he said, kindly, &ldquo;I took care
    that it did not bite itself. Sometimes they do that when they are dying,
    and then they&rsquo;re not good to eat. But this snake is all right, and
    won&rsquo;t disagree like cockchafers: the scales are quite soft and digestible,&rdquo; he
    added.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><img src="0900681h-images/page015.jpg" width="591" height="750"></h3>
  <p>But Dot said she would rather wait for the berries the Kangaroo was bringing,
    so the Kookooburra remarked that if she would excuse it he would like to
    begin breakfast at once, as the fight had made him hungry. Then Dot saw him
    hold the reptile on the branch with his foot, whilst he took its tail into
    his beak, and proceeded to swallow it in a leisurely way. In fact the Kookooburra
    was so slow that very little of the snake had disappeared when the Kangaroo
    returned.</p>
  <p>The Kangaroo had brought a pouch full of berries, and in her hand a small
    spray of the magic ones, by eating which Dot was able to understand the talk
    of all the bush creatures. All the time she was wandering in the bush the
    Kangaroo gave her some of these to eat daily, and Dot soon found that the
    effect of these strange berries only lasted until the next day.</p>
  <p>The Kangaroo emptied out her pouch, and Dot found quite a large collection
    of roots, buds, and berries, which she ate with good appetite.</p>
  <p>The Kangaroo watched her eating with a look of quiet satisfaction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;how easily one can live in the bush
    without hurting anyone; and yet Humans live by murdering creatures and devouring
    them. If they are lost in the scrub they die, because they know no other
    way to live than that cruel one of destroying us all. Humans have become
    so cruel that they kill, and kill, not even for food, but for the love of
    murdering. I often wonder,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;why they and the dingos
    are allowed to live on this beautiful kind earth. The black Humans kill and
    devour us; but they, even, are not so terrible as the Whites, who delight
    in taking our lives, and torturing us just as an amusement. Every creature
    in the bush weeps that they should have come to take the beautiful bush away
    from us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dot saw that the sad brown eyes of the Kangaroo were full of tears, and
    she cried too, as she thought of all that the poor animals and birds suffer
    at the hands of white men. &ldquo;Dear Kangaroo,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if
    I ever get home, I&rsquo;ll tell everyone of how you unhappy creatures live
    in fear, and suffer, and ask them not to kill you poor things any more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the Kangaroo sadly shook her head, and said, &ldquo;White Humans are
    cruel, and love to murder. We must all die. But about your lost way,&rdquo; she
    continued in a brisk tone, by way of changing this painful subject; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
    been asking about it, and no one has seen it anywhere. Of course someone
    must know where it is, but the difficulty is to find the right one to ask.&rdquo; Then
    she dropped her voice, and came a little nearer to Dot, and stooping down
    until her little black hands hung close to the ground, she whispered in Dot&rsquo;s
    ear, &ldquo;They say I ought to consult the Platypus.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Could the Platypus help, do you think?&rdquo; Dot asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I never think,&rdquo; said the Kangaroo, &ldquo;but as the Platypus
    never goes anywhere, never associates with any other creature, and is hardly
    ever seen, I conclude it knows everything&mdash;it must, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Dot, with some doubt in her tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The only thing is,&rdquo; continued the Kangaroo, once more sitting
    up and pensively scratching her nose. &ldquo;The only thing is, I can&rsquo;t
    bear the Platypus; the sight of it gives me the creeps: it&rsquo;s such a
    queer creature!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen a Platypus,&rdquo; said Dot, &ldquo;do tell
    me what it is like!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t describe it,&rdquo; said the Kangaroo, with a shudder, &ldquo;it
    seems made up of parts of two or three different sorts of creatures. None
    of us can account for it. It must have been an experiment, when all the rest
    of us were made; or else it was made up of the odds and ends of the birds
    and beasts that were left over after we were all finished.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Little Dot clapped her hands. &ldquo;Oh, dear Kangaroo,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;do
    take me to see the Platypus! there was nothing like that in my Noah&rsquo;s
    ark.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I should say not!&rdquo; remarked the Kangaroo. &ldquo;The animals
    in the ark said they were each to be of its kind, and every sort of bird
    and beast refused to admit the Platypus, because it was of so many kinds;
    and at last Noah turned it out to swim for itself, because there was such
    a row. That&rsquo;s why the Platypus is so secluded. Ever since then no Platypus
    is friendly with any other creature, and no animal or bird is more than just
    polite to it. They couldn&rsquo;t be, you see, because of that trouble in
    the ark.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But that was so long ago,&rdquo; said Dot, filled with compassion
    for the lonely Platypus; &ldquo;and, after all, this is not the same Platypus,
    nor are all the bush creatures the same now as then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned the Kangaroo, &ldquo;and some say there was no
    ark, and no fuss over the matter, but that, of course, doesn&rsquo;t make
    any difference, for it&rsquo;s a very ancient quarrel, so it must be kept
    up. But if we are to go to the Platypus we had better start now; it is a
    good time to see it&mdash;so come along, little Dot,&rdquo; said the Kangaroo.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter 4<br>
    The Home of the Platypus</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Kookooburra!&rdquo; cried Dot, as they left the cave; and
    the bird gave her a nod of the head, followed by a wink, which was supposed
    to mean hearty good-will at parting. He would have spoken, only he had swallowed
    part of the Snake, and the rest hung out of the side of his beak, like an
    old man&rsquo;s pipe; so he couldn&rsquo;t speak. It wouldn&rsquo;t have
    been polite to do so with his beak full.</p>
  <p>Dot was so rested by her sleep all night that she did not ride in the Kangaroo&rsquo;s
    pouch; but they proceeded together, she walking, and her friend making as
    small hops as she could, so as not to get too far ahead. This was very difficult
    for the Kangaroo, because even the smallest hops carried her far in front.
    After a time they arranged that the friendly animal should hop a few yards,
    then wait for Dot to catch her up, and then go on again. This she did, nibbling
    bits of grass as she waited, or playing a little game of hide-and-seek behind
    the bushes.</p>
  <p>Sometimes, when she hid like this, little Dot would be afraid that she had
    lost her Kangaroo, and would run here and there, hunting round trees, and
    clusters of ferns, until she felt quite certain she had lost the kind animal;
    when suddenly, clean over a big bush, the Kangaroo would bound into view,
    landing right in front of her. Then Dot would laugh, and rush forward, and
    throw her arms around her friend; and the Kangaroo, with a quiet smile, would
    rub her little head against Dot&rsquo;s curls, and they were both very happy.
    So, although it was really a long and rough way to the little creek where
    the Platypus lived, it did not seem at all far.</p>
  <p>The stream ran at the bottom of a deep gully, that had high rocky sides,
    with strangely shaped trees growing between the rocks. But, by the stream,
    Dot thought they must be in fairyland; it was so beautiful. In the dark hollows
    of the rocks were wonderful ferns; such delicate ones that the little girl
    was afraid to touch them. They were so tender and green that they could only
    grow far away from the sun, and as she peeped into the hollows and caves
    where they grew, it seemed as if she was being shown the secret store-house
    of Nature, where she kept all the most lovely plants, out of sight of the
    world. A soft carpet seemed to spring under Dot&rsquo;s feet, like a nice
    springy mattress, as she trotted along. She asked the Kangaroo why the earth
    was so soft, and was told that it was not earth, but the dead leaves of the
    tree-ferns above them, that had been falling for such a long, long time,
    that no Kangaroo could remember the beginning.</p>
  <p>Then Dot looked up, and saw that there was no sky to be seen, or tops of
    trees; for they were passing under a forest of tree-ferns, and their lovely
    spreading fronds made a perfect green tent over their heads. The sunlight
    that came through was green, as if you were in a house made of green glass.
    All up the slender stems of these tall tree-ferns were the most beautiful
    little plants, and many stems were twined, from the earth to their feather-like
    fronds, with tender creeping ferns&mdash;the fronds of which were so fine
    and close, that it seemed as if the tree-fern were wrapped up in a lovely
    little fern coat. Even crumbling dead trees, and decaying tree-ferns, did
    not look dead, because some beautiful moss, or lichen, or little ferns had
    clung to them, and made them more beautiful than when alive.</p>
  <p>Dot kept crying out with pleasure at all she saw; especially when little
    Parrakeets, with feathers as green as the ferns, and gorgeous red breasts,
    came in flocks, and welcomed her to their favourite haunt; and, as she had
    eaten the berries of understanding, and was the friend of the Kangaroo, they
    were not frightened, but perched on her shoulders and hands, and chatted
    their merry talk all together. The Kangaroo did not share Dot&rsquo;s enthusiasm
    for the beauties of the gully. She said it was pretty, certainly, but a bad
    place for Kangaroos, because there was no grass. For her part, she didn&rsquo;t
    think any sight in nature so lovely as a big plain, green with the little
    blades of new spring grass. The gully was very showy, but not to her mind
    so beautiful as the other.</p>
  <p>Then they came to a stream that gurgled melodiously as it rippled over stones
    in its shallow course, or crept round big grey boulders that were wrapped
    in thick mosses, in which were mingled flowers of the pink and red wild fuchsia,
    or the creamy great blossoms of the rock lily. Dot ran down the stream with
    bare feet, laughing as she paddled in and out among the rocks and ferns,
    and the sun shone down on the gleaming foam of the water, and made golden
    lights in Dot&rsquo;s wild curls. The Kangaroo, too, was very merry, and
    bounded from rock to rock over the stream, showing what wonderful things
    she could do in that way; and sometimes they paused, side by side, and peeped
    down upon some still pool that showed their two reflections as in a mirror;
    and that seemed so funny to Dot, that her silvery laugh woke the silence
    in happy peals, until more green-and-red Parrakeets flew out of the bush
    to join in the fun.</p>
  <p>When they had followed the stream some distance, the gully opened out into
    bush scrub. The little Parrakeets then said &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; and flew
    back to their favourite tree-ferns and bush growth; and the Kangaroo said,
    that as they were nearing the home of the Platypus, they must not play in
    the stream any more; to do so might warn the creature of their approach and
    frighten it. &ldquo;We shall have to be very careful,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;so
    that the Platypus will neither hear nor smell you. We will therefore walk
    on the opposite shore, as the wind will then blow away from its home.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><img src="0900681h-images/page019.jpg" width="584" height="750"></h3>
  <p>The stream no longer chattered over rocky beds, but slid between soft banks
    of earth, under tufts of tall rushes, grasses, and ferns, and soon it opened
    into a broad pool, which was smooth as glass. The clouds in the sky, the
    tall surrounding trees, and the graceful ferns and rushes of the banks, were
    all reflected in the water, so that it looked to Dot like a strange upside-down
    picture. This, then, was the home of that wonderful animal; and Dot felt
    quite frightened, because she thought she was going to see something terrible.</p>
  <p>At the Kangaroo&rsquo;s bidding, she hid a little way from the edge of the
    pool, but she was able to see all that happened.</p>
  <p>The Kangaroo evidently did not enjoy the prospect of conversing with the
    Platypus. She kept on fidgeting about, putting off calling to the Platypus
    by one excuse and another: she was decidedly ill at ease.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you frightened of the Platypus?&rdquo; asked Dot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear me, no!&rdquo; replied the Kangaroo, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d rather
    have a talk with any other bush creature. First of all, the sight of it makes
    me so uncomfortable, that I want to hop away the instant I set eyes upon
    it. Then, too, it&rsquo;s so difficult to be polite to the Platypus, because
    one never knows how to behave towards it. If you treat it as an animal, you
    offend its bird nature, and if you treat it as a bird, the animal in it is
    mighty indignant. One never knows where one is with a creature that is two
    creatures,&rdquo; said the Kangaroo.</p>
  <p>Dot was so sorry for the perplexity of her friend, that she suggested that
    they should not consult the Platypus. But the Kangaroo said it must be done,
    because no one in the bush was so learned. Being such a strange creature,
    and living in such seclusion, and being so difficult to approach was a proof
    that it was the right adviser to seek. So, with a half desperate air, the
    Kangaroo left the little girl, and went down to the water&rsquo;s edge.</p>
  <p>Pausing a moment, she made a strange little noise that was something between
    a grunt and a hiss: and she repeated this many times. At last Dot saw what
    looked like a bit of black stick, just above the surface of the pool, coming
    towards their side, and, as it moved forward, leaving two little silvery
    ripples that widened out behind it on the smooth waters. Presently the black
    stick, which was the bill of the Platypus, reached the bank, and the strangest
    little creature climbed into view. Dot had expected to see something big
    and hideous; but here was quite a small object after all! It seemed quite
    ridiculous that the great Kangaroo should be evidently discomposed by the
    sight.</p>
  <p>Dot could not hear what the Kangaroo said, but she saw the Platypus hurriedly
    prepare to regain the water. It began to stumble clumsily down the bank.
    The Kangaroo then raised her voice in pleading accents.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s such a little Human! I have
    treated it like my baby Kangaroo, and have carried it in my pouch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This information seemed to arrest the movements of the Platypus; it had
    reached the water&rsquo;s edge, but it paused, and turned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; it said in a high-pitched and irritable voice, &ldquo;that
    all Humans are alike! They all come here to interview me for the same purpose,
    and I&rsquo;m resolved it shall not happen again; I have been insulted enough
    by their ignorance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I assure you,&rdquo; urged the Kangaroo, &ldquo;that she will not
    annoy you in that way. She wouldn&rsquo;t think of doing such a thing to
    any animal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As the Kangaroo called the Platypus an animal, Dot saw at once that it was
    offended, and in a great huff it turned towards the pool again. &ldquo;I
    beg your pardon,&rdquo; said the Kangaroo nervously. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
    mean an altogether animal, or even a bird, but any a&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;.&rdquo; She
    seemed puzzled how to speak of the Platypus, when the strange creature, seeing
    the well-meaning embarrassment of the Kangaroo, said affably, &ldquo;any
    mammal or <i>Ornithorhynchus Paradoxus</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said the Kangaroo, brightening up, although she hadn&rsquo;t
    the least idea what a mammal was.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, bring the little Human here,&rdquo; said the Platypus in a
    more friendly tone, &ldquo;and if I feel quite sure on that point I will
    permit an interview.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Two bounds brought the Kangaroo to where Dot was hidden. She seemed anxious
    that the child should make a good impression on the Platypus, and tried with
    the long claws on her little black hands to comb through Dot&rsquo;s long
    gleaming curls; but they were so tangled that the child called out at this
    awkward method of hairdressing, and the Kangaroo stopped. She then licked
    a black smudge off Dot&rsquo;s forehead, which was all she could to tidy
    her. Then she started back with a hop, and eyed the child with her head on
    one side. She was not quite satisfied. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if
    only you were a baby Kangaroo I could make you look so nice! But I can&rsquo;t
    do anything to your sham coat, which gets worse every day, and your fur is
    all wrong, for one can&rsquo;t get one&rsquo;s claws through it. You Humans
    are no good in the bush!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind, dear Kangaroo,&rdquo; said the little girl; &ldquo;when
    I get home mother will put me on a new frock, and will get the tangles out
    of my hair. Let us go to the Platypus now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Kangaroo felt sad as Dot spoke of returning home, for she had become
    really fond of the little Human. She began to feel that she would be lonely
    when they parted. However, she did not speak of what was in her mind, but
    bounded back to the Platypus to wait for Dot.</p>
  <p>When the little girl reached the pool, she was still more surprised, on
    a nearer view of the Platypus, that the Kangaroo should think so much of
    it. At her feet she beheld a creature like a shapeless bit of wet matted
    fur. She thought it looked like an empty fur bag that had been fished out
    of the water. Projecting from the head, that seemed much nearer to the ground
    than the back, was a broad duck&rsquo;s bill, of a dirty grey colour; and
    peeping out underneath were two fore feet that were like a duck&rsquo;s also.
    Altogether it was such a funny object that she was inclined to laugh, only
    the Kangaroo looked so serious, that she tried to look serious too, as if
    there was nothing strange in the appearance of the Platypus.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am the <i>Ornithorhynchus Paradoxus</i>!&rdquo; said the Platypus
    pompously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am Dot,&rdquo; said the little girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now we know one another&rsquo;s names,&rdquo; said the Platypus,
    with satisfaction. &ldquo;If the Kangaroo had introduced us, it would have
    stumbled over my name, and mumbled yours, and we should have been none the
    wiser. Now tell me, little Human, are you going to write a book about me?
    Because, if you are, I&rsquo;m off. I can&rsquo;t stand any more books being
    written about me; I&rsquo;ve been annoyed enough that way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t write a book,&rdquo; said Dot, with surprise inwardly
    wondering what anyone could find to make a book of, out of such a small,
    ugly creature.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite sure?&rdquo; asked the Platypus, doubtfully, and
    evidently more than half inclined to dive into the pool.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite,&rdquo; said Dot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll try to believe you,&rdquo; said the Platypus, clumsily
    waddling towards some grass, amongst which it settled itself comfortably. &ldquo;But
    it&rsquo;s very difficult to believe you Humans, for you tell such dreadful
    fibs,&rdquo; it continued, as it squirted some dirty water out of the bag
    that surrounded its bill, and swallowed some water beetles, small snails
    and mud that it had stored there. &ldquo;See, for instance, the way you have
    all quarrelled and lied about me! First one great Human, the biggest fool
    of all, said I wasn&rsquo;t a live creature at all, but a joke another Human
    had played upon him. Then they squabbled together one saying I was a Beaver;
    another, that I was a Duck; another, that I was a Mole, or a Rat. Then they
    argued whether I was a bird, or an animal, or if we laid eggs, or not; and
    everyone wrote a book, full of lies, all out of his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way Humans amuse themselves. They write books about
    things they don&rsquo;t understand, and keep the game going by each new book
    saying the others are all wrong. It&rsquo;s a silly game, and very insulting
    to the creatures they write about. Humans at the other end of the world,
    who, never took the trouble to come here to see me, wrote books about me.
    Those who did come were more impudent than those who stayed away. Their idea
    of learning all about a creature was to dig up its home, and frighten it
    out of its wits, and kill it; and after a few moons of that sort of foolery
    they claimed to know all about us. Us! whose ancestors knew the world millions
    of years before the ignorant Humans came on the earth at all!&rdquo; The
    Platypus spluttered out more dirty water, in its indignation.</p>
  <p>The Kangaroo became very timid, as it saw the rising anger of the Platypus,
    and whispered to Dot to say something to calm the little creature.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A million years is a very long time,&rdquo; said Dot; unable at the
    moment to think of anything better to say. But this remark angered the Platypus
    more, for it seemed to suspect Dot of doubting what it said.</p>
  <p>It clambered up into a more erect position, and its little brown eyes became
    quite fiery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say a million; I said millions! I can prove by a bone
    in my body that my ancestors were the Amphitherium, the Amphilestes, the
    Phascolotherium, and the Stereognathus!&rdquo; almost shrieked the little
    creature.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><img src="0900681h-images/page023.jpg" width="589" height="750"></h3>
  <p>Dot didn&rsquo;t understand what all these words meant, and looked at the
    Kangaroo for an explanation; but she saw that the Kangaroo didn&rsquo;t understand
    either, only she was trying to hide her ignorance by a calm appearance, while
    she nibbled the end of a long grass she held in her fore paw. But Dot noticed,
    by the slight trembling of the little black paw, that the Kangaroo was very
    nervous. She thought she would try and say something to please Platypus;
    so she asked, very kindly, if the bone ever hurt it. But this strange creature
    did not seem to notice the remark. Settling itself more comfortably amongst
    the grass, it muttered in calmer tones, &ldquo;I trace my ancestry back to
    the oolite age. Where does man come in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Dot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; replied the Platypus, contemptuously,
    &ldquo;Humans are so ignorant! That&rsquo;s because they are so new. When they have
    existed a few more million years, they will be more like us of old families;
    they will respect quiet, exclusive living, like that of the <i>Ornithorhynchus
    Paradoxus</i>, and will not be so inquisitive, pushing, and dangerous as
    now. The age will come when they will understand, and will cease to write
    books, and there will be peace for everyone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Kangaroo now thought it a good opportunity to change the subject, and
    gently introduced the topic of Dot&rsquo;s lost way, saying how she had found
    the little girl, and had taken care of her ever since.</p>
  <p>The Platypus did not seem interested, and yawned more than once whilst the
    Kangaroo spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The question is,&rdquo; concluded the Kangaroo, &ldquo;whom shall
    I ask to find it? Someone must know where it is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said the Platypus, yawning again, without so much
    as putting its web foot in front of its bill, which Dot thought very rude,
    or else very ancient manners. &ldquo;Little Human,&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;tell
    me what kind of bush creatures come about your burrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We live in a cottage,&rdquo; she said, but seeing that the Platypus
    did not like to be corrected, and that the Kangaroo looked quite shocked
    at her doing so, she hurriedly described the creatures she had seen there.
    She said there were Crickets, Grasshoppers, Mice, Lizards, Swallows, Opossums,
    Flying Foxes, Kookooburras, Magpies, and Shepherd&rsquo;s Companions&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; interrupted the Platypus, with a wave of its web foot; &ldquo;that
    is the right one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; asked the Kangaroo and Dot anxiously, together.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The bird you call Shepherd&rsquo;s Companion. Some of you call it
    Rickety Dick, or Willy Wagtail.&rdquo; Turning to the Kangaroo especially,
    it continued, &ldquo;If you can bring yourself to speak to anything so obtrusive
    and gossiping, without any ancestry or manners whatever, you will be able
    to learn all you need from that bird. Humans and Wagtails fraternise together.
    They&rsquo;re both post-glacial.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I knew you could advise me,&rdquo; said the Kangaroo gratefully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! Platypus, how clever you are!&rdquo; cried Dot, clapping her
    hands.</p>
  <p>Directly Dot had spoken she saw that she had offended the queer little creature
    before her. It raised itself with an air of offended dignity that was unmistakable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The name Platypus is insulting,&rdquo; it remarked, looking at the
    child severely, &ldquo;it means <i>broad-footed</i>, a vulgar pseudonym which
    could only have emanated from the brutally coarse expressions of a Human.
    My name is <i>Ornithorhynchus Paradoxus</i>. Besides, even if my front feet
    can expand, they can also contract; see! as narrow and refined as a bird&rsquo;s
    claw. Observe, too, that my hind feet are narrow, and like a seal&rsquo;s
    fin, though it has been described as a mole&rsquo;s foot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As the Platypus spoke, and thrust out its strangely different feet, the
    Kangaroo edged a little closer to Dot and whispered in her ear. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
    getting angry, and is beginning to use long words; do be careful what you
    say or it will be terrible!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Dot; &ldquo;I did not wish to hurt
    your feelings, Para&mdash;Pa&mdash;ra&mdash;dox&mdash;us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Ornithorhynchus</i> Paradoxus, if you please,&rdquo; insisted
    the little creature. &ldquo;How would you like it if your name was Jones-Smith-Jones,
    and I called you one Jones, or one Smith, and did not say both the Joneses
    and the Smiths? You have no idea how sensitive our race is. You Humans have
    no feelings at all compared with ours. Why, my fifth pair of nerves are larger
    than a man&rsquo;s! Humans get on my nerves dreadfully!&rdquo; it ended in
    disgusted accents.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She did not mean to hurt you,&rdquo; said the gentle Kangaroo, soothingly. &ldquo;Is
    there anything we can do to make you feel comfortable again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is nothing you can do,&rdquo; Sighed the Platypus, now mournful
    and depressed. &ldquo;I must sing. Only music can quiet my nerves. I will
    sing a little threnody composed by myself, about the good old days of this
    world before the Flood.&rdquo; And as it spoke, the Platypus moved into an
    upright position amongst the tussock grass, and after a little cough opened
    its bill to sing.</p>
  <p>The Kangaroo kept very close to Dot, and warned her to be very attentive
    to the song, and not to interrupt it on any account. Almost before the Kangaroo
    had ceased to whisper in her ear, Dot heard this strange song, sung to the
    most peculiar tune she had ever heard, and in the funniest of little squeaky
    voices.</p>
  <p>The fairest Iguanodon reposed upon the shore<br>
    Extended lay her beauteous form, a hundred feet and more.<br>
    The sun, with rays flammivomous, beat on the blue-black sand;<br>
    And sportive little Saurians disported on the strand<br>
    But oft the Iguanodon reproved them in their glee,<br>
    And said, &ldquo;Alas! this Saurian Age is not what it should be!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, forth from that archaic sea, the Ichthyosaurus<br>
    Uprose upon his finny wings, with neocomian fuss,<br>
  &ldquo;Oh, Iguanodon!&rdquo; he cried, as he approached the shore,<br>
  &ldquo;Why art thou thus dysthynic, love? Come, rise with me, and soar,<br>
    Or leave these estuarian seas, and wander in the grove;<br>
    Behold! a bird-like reptile fish is dying for thy love!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, through the dark coniferous grove they wandered side by side,<br>
    The tender Iguanodon and Ichthyosaurian bride<br>
    And through the enubilious air, the carboniferous breeze,<br>
    Awoke, with their amphibious sighs, the silence in the trees.<br>
  &ldquo;To think,&rdquo; they cried, botaurus-toned, &ldquo;when ages intervene,<br>
    Our osseous fossil forms will be in some museum seen!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bemoaning thus, by dumous path, they crushed the cycad&rsquo;s growth,<br>
    And many a crash, and thunder, marked the progress of them both.<br>
    And when they reached the estuary, the excandescent sun<br>
    Was setting o&rsquo;er the hefted sea; their saurian day was done.<br>
    Then raised they paraseline eyes unto the flaming moon,<br>
    And wept&mdash;the Neocomian Age was passing all too soon!</p>
  <p>Oh, Iguanodon! oh, earth! Oh, Ichthyosaurus!<br>
    Oh, Melanocephalous saurians! Oh! oh! oh! </p>
  <p>(Here the Platypus was sobbing)</p>
  <p>Oh, Troglyodites obscure&mdash;oh! oh! </p>
  <p>At this point of the song, the poor Platypus, whose voice had trembled with
    increasing emotion and sobbing in each verse, broke down, overcome by the
    extreme sensitiveness of its fifth pair of nerves and the sadness of its
    song, and wept in terrible grief.</p>
  <p>The gentle Kangaroo was also deeply moved, seeing the Platypus in such sorrow,
    and Dot mastered her aversion to touching cold, damp fur, and stroked the
    little creature&rsquo;s head.</p>
  <p>The Platypus seemed much soothed by their sympathy, but hurriedly bade them
    farewell. It said it must try and restore its shattered fifth pair of nerves
    by a few hydrophilus latipalpus beetles for lunch, and a sleep.</p>
  <p>It wearily dragged itself down to the edge of the pool, and looked backwards
    to the Kangaroo and Dot, who called out &ldquo;Good-bye&rdquo; to it. Its
    eyes were dim with tears, for it was still thinking of the Iguanodon and
    ichthyosaurus, and of the good old days before the Flood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It breaks my heart to think that they are all fossils,&rdquo; it
    exclaimed, mournfully shaking its head. &ldquo;Fossils!&rdquo; it repeated,
    as it plunged into the pool and swam away. &ldquo;Fossils!&rdquo; it cried
    once more, in far, faint accents; and a second later it dived out of sight.</p>
  <p>For several moments after the Platypus had disappeared from view, the Kangaroo
    and Dot remained just as it had left them. Then Dot broke the silence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear Kangaroo,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;what was that song about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the animal wistfully, &ldquo;no one
    ever knows what the Platypus sings about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was very sad,&rdquo; said Dot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dreadfully sad!&rdquo; sighed the Kangaroo; &ldquo;but the Platypus
    is a most learned and interesting creature,&rdquo; she added hastily. &ldquo;Its
    conversation and songs are most edifying; everyone in the bush admits it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does anyone understand its conversation?&rdquo; asked Dot. She was
    afraid she must be very stupid, for she hadn&rsquo;t understood anything
    except that Willy Wagtail could help them to find her way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is the beauty of it all,&rdquo; said the Kangaroo, &ldquo;the
    Platypus is so learned and so instructive, that no one tries to understand
    it; it is not expected that anyone should.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter 5<br>
    The Native Companions Dance</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Now we must find Willy Wagtail,&rdquo; said the Kangaroo. &ldquo;The
    chances are Click-i-ti-clack, his big cousin who lives in the bush, will
    be able to tell us where to find him; for he doesn&rsquo;t care for the bush,
    and lives almost entirely with Humans, and the queer creatures they have
    brought into the country now-a-days. We may have to go a long way, so hop
    into my pouch, and we will get on our way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Once more Dot was in the kind Kangaroo&rsquo;s pouch. It was in the latter
    end of autumn, and the air was so keen, that, as her torn little frock was
    now very little protection to her against the cold, she was glad to be back
    in that nice fur bag. She was used now to the springy bounding of the great
    Kangaroo, and felt quite safe; so that she quite enjoyed the wonderful and
    seemingly dangerous things the animal did in its great leaps and jumps.</p>
  <p>With many rests and stops to eat berries or grass on their way, they searched
    the bush for the rest of the day without finding the big bush Wagtail. All
    kinds of creatures had seen him, or heard his strange rattling, chattering
    song; but it always seemed that he had just flown off a few minutes before
    they heard of him. It was most vexatious, and Dot saw that another night
    must pass before they would be able to hear of her home. She did not like
    to think of that, for she could picture to herself all those great men, on
    their big rough horses, coming back to her father&rsquo;s cottage that night,
    and how they would begin to be quiet and sad.</p>
  <p>She thought it would not be half so bad to be lost, if people at home could
    only know that one was safe and snug in a kind Kangaroo&rsquo;s pouch; but
    she knew that her parents could never suppose that she was so well cared
    for, and would only think that she was dying alone in the terrible bush&mdash;dying
    for want of food and water, and from fear and exposure. How strange it seemed
    that people should die like that in the bush, where so many creatures lived
    well, and happily! But then they had not bush friends to tell them what berries
    and roots to eat, and where to get water, and to cuddle them up in a nice
    warm fur during the cold night. As she thought of this she rubbed her face
    against the Kangaroo&rsquo;s soft coat, and patted her with her little hands;
    and the affectionate animal was so pleased at these caresses, that she jumped
    clean over a watercourse, twenty feet at least, in one bound.</p>
  <p>It was getting evening time, and the sun was setting with a beautiful rosy
    colour, as they came upon a lovely scene. They had followed the watercourse
    until it widened out into a great shallow creek beside a grassy plain. As
    they emerged from the last scattered bushes and trees of the forest, and
    hopped out into the open side of a range of hills, miles and miles of grass
    country, with dim distant hills, stretched before them. The great shining
    surface of the creek caught the rosy evening light, and every pink cloudlet
    in the sky looked doubly beautiful reflected in the water. Here and there
    out of the water arose giant skeleton trees, with huge silver trunks and
    contorted dead branches. On these twisted limbs were numbers of birds; Shag,
    blue and white Cranes, and black and white Ibis with their bent bills. Slowly
    paddling on the creek, with graceful movements, were twenty or thirty black
    Swans, and in and out of their ranks, as they passed in stately procession,
    shot wild Ducks and Moor Hens, like a flotilla of little boats amongst a
    fleet of big ships. All these birds were watching a pretty sight that arrested
    Dot&rsquo;s attention at once. By the margin of the creek, where tufted rushes
    and tall sedges shed their graceful reflection on the pink waters, were a
    party of Native Companions dancing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In these times it is seldom we can see a sight like this,&rdquo; said
    the Kangaroo. &ldquo;The water is generally too unsafe for the birds to enjoy
    themselves. It often means death to them to have a little pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As the Kangaroo spoke, one of the Native Companions caught sight of her,
    and leaving the dance, opened her wings, and still making dainty steps with
    her long legs, half danced and half flew to where the Kangaroo was sitting.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good evening, Kangaroo,&rdquo; she said, gracefully bowing; &ldquo;will
    you not come a little nearer to see the dance?&rdquo; Then the Native Companion
    saw Dot in the Kangaroo&rsquo;s pouch, and made a little spring of surprise. &ldquo;Dear
    me!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what have you in your pouch?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Human,&rdquo; said the Kangaroo, apologetically; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
    quite a little, harmless one. Let me introduce you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So Dot alighted from the pouch, and joined in the conversation, and the
    Native Companion was much interested in hearing her story.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you dance?&rdquo; asked the Native Companion, with a quick turn
    of her head, on its long, graceful neck. Dot said that she loved dancing.
    So the Native Companion took her down to the creek, and all the other Companions
    stopped dancing and gathered round her, whilst she was introduced, and her
    story told. Then they spread their wings, and with stately steps escorted
    her to the edge of the water, whilst the Kangaroo sat a little way off, and
    delightedly watched the proceedings.</p>
  <p>Dot didn&rsquo;t understand any of the figures of the dance; but the scenery
    and the pink sunset were so beautiful, and the Native Companions were so
    elegant and gay, that Dot caught up her ragged little skirts in both hands
    and followed their movements with her bare brown feet as best she could,
    and enjoyed herself very much. To Dot, the eight birds that took part in
    the entertainment were very tall and splendid, with their lovely grey plumage
    and greeny heads, and she felt quite small as they gathered round her sometimes,
    and enclosed her within their outspread wings. And how beautiful their dancing
    was! How light their dainty steps as their feet scarcely touched the earth;
    and what fantastic measures they danced&mdash;advancing, retreating, circling
    round&mdash;with their beautiful wings keeping the rhythm of their feet!
    There was one figure that Dot thought the prettiest of all&mdash;when they
    danced in line at the margin of the water; stepping, and bowing, and gracefully
    gyrating to their shadows, which were reflected with the pink clouds of evening
    on the surface of the creek.</p>
  <p>Dot was very sorry, and hot, and breathless, when the dance came to an end.
    The sun had been gone a long time, and all the pink shades had slowly turned
    to grey; the creek had lost its radiant colour, and looked like a silver
    mirror, and so desolate and sombre, that no one could have imagined it to
    have been the scene of so much gaiety shortly before.</p>
  <p>Dot hastily returned to the Kangaroo, and all the Native Companions came
    daintily, and made graceful adieus to them both. Afterwards, they spread
    their great, soft wings, and, stretching their long legs behind them, wheeled
    upwards to the darkening sky. Then all the birds in the bare trees preened
    their feathers, and settled down for the night; and the Kangaroo took her
    little Human charge back to the bush, where there was a cosy sheltering rock,
    under which to pass the night. Here they lay down together, with the stars
    peeping at them through the branches of the trees.</p>
  <p>They had slept for a long time, as it seemed to Dot, when they were awakened
    by a little voice saying,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wake up, Kangaroo! You are in danger. Get away, as soon as possible!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The moon was shining fitfully, as it broke through swift flying clouds.
    In the uncertain light, Dot could see a little creature near them, and knew
    at once that it was an Opossum.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; said the Kangaroo, softly. &ldquo;Blacks!&rdquo; said
    the Opossum. And as it spoke, Dot heard a sound as of a half dingo dog howling
    and snapping in the distance. As that sound was heard, the Opossum made one
    flying leap to the nearest tree, and scrambled out of sight in a moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wish he had told us a little more,&rdquo; said the Kangaroo. &ldquo;Still,
    for a possum, it was a good-natured act to wake me up. They are selfish,
    spiteful little beasts, as a rule. Now I wonder where these blacks are? I
    shall have to go a little way to sniff and listen. I won&rsquo;t go far,
    so don&rsquo;t be afraid, but stay quietly here until I come back.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter6"></a>Chapter 6<br>
    Dot and the Native Bear</b></h2>
  <p>It was terrible to Dot to see the Kangaroo hop off into the dark bush, and
    to find herself all alone; so she crawled out from under the ledge of rock
    into the moonlight, and sat on a stone where she could see the sky, and watch
    the black ragged clouds hurry over the moon. But the bush was not altogether
    quiet. She could hear an owl hooting at the moon. Not far off was a camp
    of quarrelsome Flying Foxes, and the melancholy Nightjar in the distance
    was fulfilling its mission of making all the bush creatures miserable with
    its incessant, mournful &ldquo;mo-poke! mo-poke!&rdquo; As Dot could understand
    all the voices, it amused her to listen to the wrangles of the Flying Foxes,
    as they ate the fruit of a wild fig tree near by. She saw them swoop past
    on their huge black wings with a solemn flapping. Then, as each little Fox
    approached the tree, the Foxes who were there already screamed, and swore
    in dreadfully bad language at the visitor. For every little Fox on the tree
    was afraid some other Flying Fox would eat all the figs, and as each visitor
    arrived he was assailed with cries of, &ldquo;Get away you&rsquo;re not wanted
    here!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is my branch, my figs!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go and find figs for yourself!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;These figs are not half ripe like the juicy ones on the other side
    of the tree!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then the new-comer Flying Fox, with a spiteful squeal, would pounce down
    on a branch already occupied, and angry spluttering and screams would arise,
    followed by a heavy fall of fighting Foxes tumbling with a crash through
    the trees. Then out into the open sky swept dozens of black wings, accompanied
    by abusive swearing from dozens of wicked little brown Foxes; and, as they
    settled again on the tree, all the fighting would begin again, so that the
    squealing, screaming, and swearing never ended.</p>
  <p>As Dot was listening to the fighting of the Flying Foxes, she heard a sound
    near her that alarmed her greatly. It was impossible to say what the noise
    was like. It might have been the braying of a donkey mixed up with the clattering
    of palings tumbled together, and with grunts and snorts. Dot started to her
    feet in fright, and would have run away, only she was afraid of being lost
    worse than ever, so she stood still and looked round for the terrible monster
    that could make such extraordinary sounds. The grunts and clattering stopped,
    and the noise died away in a long doleful bray, but she could not see where
    it came from. Having peered into the dark shadows, Dot went more into the
    open, and sat with her back to a fallen tree, keeping an anxious watch all
    round.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;It is the blacks. What would
    they do if they found me? What will happen if they have killed my dear Kangaroo?&rdquo; And
    she covered her face with her hands as this terrible thought came into her
    head. Soon she heard something coming towards her stealthily and slowly.
    She would not look up she was so frightened. She was sure it was some fierce
    looking black man, with his spear, about to kill her. She shut her eyes closer,
    and held her breath. &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;he will not
    see me.&rdquo; Then a cold shiver went through her little body, as she felt
    something claw hold of her hair, and she thought she was about to be killed.
    She kept her eyes shut, and the clawing went on, and then to her astonishment
    she heard an animal voice say in wondering tones:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s fur! How funny it looked in the moonlight!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then Dot opened her eyes very wide and looked round, and saw a funny native
    Bear on the tree trunk behind her. He was quite clearly to be seen in the
    moonlight. His thick, grey fur, that looked as if he was wrapped up to keep
    out the most terribly cold weather; his short, stumpy, big legs, and little
    sharp face with big bushy ears, could be seen as distinctly as in daylight.
    Dot had never seen one so near before, and she loved it at once, it looked
    so innocent and kind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You dear little native Bear!&rdquo; she exclaimed, at once stroking
    its head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am I a native Bear?&rdquo; asked the animal in a meek voice. &ldquo;I
    never heard that before. I thought I was a Koala. I&rsquo;ve always been
    told so, but of course one never knows oneself. What are you? Do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a little girl,&rdquo; replied Dot, proudly.</p>
  <p>The Koala saw that Dot was proud, but as it didn&rsquo;t see any reason
    why she should be, it was not a bit afraid of her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I never heard of one or saw one before,&rdquo; it said, simply. &ldquo;Do
    you burrow, or live in a tree?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I live at home,&rdquo; said Dot; but, wishing to be quite correct,
    she added, &ldquo;that is, when I am there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then, where are you now?&rdquo; asked the Koala, rather perplexed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not at home,&rdquo; replied Dot, not knowing how to make
    her position clear to the little animal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you live where you don&rsquo;t live?&rdquo; said the Koala; &ldquo;Where
    is it?&rdquo; and the little Bear looked quite unhappy in its attempt to
    understand what Dot meant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost it,&rdquo; said Dot. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where
    it is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You make my head feel empty,&rdquo; said the Koala, sadly. &ldquo;I
    live in the gum tree over there. Do you eat gum leaves?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. When I&rsquo;m at home I have milk, and bread, and eggs, and
    meat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said the Koala. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all new to one.
    Is it far? I should like to see the trees they grow on. Please show me the
    way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Dot; &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t grow
    on trees, and I don&rsquo;t know my way home. It&rsquo;s lost, you see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; said the native Bear. &ldquo;I never can
    see far at night, and not at all in daylight. That is why I came here. I
    saw your fur shining in the moonlight, and I couldn&rsquo;t make out what
    it was, so I came to see. If there is anything new to be seen, I must get
    a near view of it. I don&rsquo;t feel happy if I don&rsquo;t know all about
    it. Aren&rsquo;t you cold?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I am, a little, since my Kangaroo left me,&rdquo; Dot said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now you make my head feel empty again,&rdquo; said the Koala, plaintively. &ldquo;What
    has a Kangaroo got to do with your feeling cold? What have you done with
    your fur?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I never had any,&rdquo; said Dot, &ldquo;only these curls,&rdquo; and
    she touched her little head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you ought to be black,&rdquo; argued the Koala. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
    not the right colour. Only blacks have no fur, but what they steal from the
    proper owners. Do you steal fur?&rdquo; it asked in an anxious voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do they steal fur?&rdquo; asked Dot.</p>
  <p>The Koala looked very miserable, and spoke with horror. &ldquo;They kill
    us with spears, and tear off our skins and wear them, because their own skins
    are no good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not stealing,&rdquo; said Dot; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s killing;&rdquo; and,
    although it seemed very difficult to make the little Bear understand, she
    explained: &ldquo;Stealing is taking away another person&rsquo;s things;
    and when a person is dead he hasn&rsquo;t anything belonging to him, so it&rsquo;s
    not stealing to take what belonged to him before, because it isn&rsquo;t
    his any longer&mdash;that is, if it doesn&rsquo;t belong to anyone else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You make my head feel empty,&rdquo; complained the Koala. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
    sure you&rsquo;re all wrong; for an animal&rsquo;s skin and fur is his own,
    and it&rsquo;s his life&rsquo;s business to keep it whole. Everyone in the
    bush is trying to keep his skin whole, all day long, and all night too. Good
    gracious! What is the matter up there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A terrible hullabaloo between a pair of Opossums up a neighbouring gum tree
    arrested the attention of both Dot and the Koala. Presently the sounds of
    snarling, spitting, and screaming ended, and an Opossum climbed out to the
    far end of a branch, where the moonlight shone on his grey fur like silver.
    There he remained snapping and barking disagreeable things to his mate, who
    climbed up to the topmost branch, and snarled and growled back equally unpleasant
    remarks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you bring in gum leaves for to-morrow, instead of
    sleeping all day and half the night too?&rdquo; shouted the Opossum on the
    branch to his wife. &ldquo;You know I get hungry before daylight is over,
    and hate going out in the light.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get them yourself, you lazy loon!&rdquo; retorted the lady Opossum. &ldquo;If
    you disturb my dreams again this way, I&rsquo;ll make your fur fly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take care!&rdquo; barked back her husband, &ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll bring
    you off that branch pretty quickly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better try!&rdquo; sneered his wife. &ldquo;Remember
    how I landed you into the billabong the other night!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The taunt was too much for the Opossum on the branch; he scuttled up the
    tree to reach his mate, who sprang forward from her perch into the air. Dot
    saw her spring with her legs all spread out, so that the skinny flaps were
    like furry wings. By this means she was able to break her fall, and softly
    alighting on the earth, a moment after, she had scrambled up another tree,
    followed by her mate. From tree to tree, from branch to branch, they fled
    or pursued one another, with growls, screams, and splutters, until they disappeared
    from sight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How unhappy those poor Opossums must be, living in the same tree,&rdquo;  said
    Dot; &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t they live in different trees?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t be happy,&rdquo; observed the Koala, &ldquo;they
    are so fond of one another.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then why do they quarrel?&rdquo; asked Dot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because they live in the same tree of course,&rdquo; said the Koala. &ldquo;If
    they lived in different trees, and never quarrelled, they wouldn&rsquo;t
    like it at all. They&rsquo;d find life dull, and they&rsquo;d get sulky.
    There&rsquo;s nothing worse than a sulky possum. They are champions at that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They make a dreadful noise with their quarrelling,&rdquo; said Dot. &ldquo;They
    are nearly as bad as the Flying Foxes over there. I wonder if they made that
    fearful sound I heard just before you came?&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><img src="0900681h-images/page035.jpg" width="588" height="750"></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;I expect what you heard was from me,&rdquo; said the Koala; &ldquo;I
    had just awakened, and when I saw the moon was up I felt pleased.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was all that sound and many noises yours?&rdquo; asked Dot with astonishment,
    as she regarded the shaggy little animal on the tree trunk.</p>
  <p>The Koala smiled modestly. &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; it said; &ldquo;when I am
    pleased there is no creature in the bush can make such a noise, or so many
    different noises at once. I waken every one for a quarter of a mile round.
    You wouldn&rsquo;t think it, to see me as I am, would you?&rdquo; The Koala
    was evidently very pleased with this accomplishment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t kind of you to wake up all the sleeping creatures,&rdquo; said
    Dot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked the Koala. &ldquo;You are a night creature,
    I suppose, or you wouldn&rsquo;t be awake now. Well, don&rsquo;t you think
    it unfair the way everything is arranged for the day creatures?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But then,&rdquo; said Dot. &ldquo;there are so many more day creatures.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t make any difference,&rdquo; observed the Koala.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But it does,&rdquo; said Dot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked the native Bear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because if you had the day it wouldn&rsquo;t be any good to you,
    and if they had the night it wouldn&rsquo;t be any good to them. So your
    night couldn&rsquo;t be their day, and their day couldn&rsquo;t be your night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You make my head feel empty,&rdquo; said the Koala. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;d
    think differently if a flock of Kookooburras settled on your tree, and guffawed
    idiotically when you wanted to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As you don&rsquo;t like being waked yourself, why do you wake others
    then?&rdquo; asked Dot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because this is a free country,&rdquo; said the Koala. While Dot
    was trying to understand why the Koala&rsquo;s reason should suffice for
    one animal making another&rsquo;s life uncomfortable, she was rejoiced to
    see the Kangaroo bound into sight. She forgot all about the Koala, and rushed
    forward to meet it.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter7"></a>Chapter 7<br>
    The Blackfellows&rsquo; Borroboree</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you have come back!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
  <p>The Kangaroo was a little breathless and excited. &ldquo;We are not in danger
    at present,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but one never knows when one will be,
    so we must move; and that will be more dangerous than staying where we are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then let us stay,&rdquo; said Dot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; replied the Kangaroo, &ldquo;This is
    the conclusion I have jumped to. If we stay here, the blacks might come this
    way and their dingo dogs hunt us to death. To get to a safe place we must
    pass their camp. That is a little risky, but we must go that way. We can
    do this easily if the dogs don&rsquo;t get scent of us, as all the blacks
    are prancing about and making a noise, having a kind of game in fact, and
    they are so amused that we ought to get past quite safely. I&rsquo;ve done
    it many times before at night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dot looked round to say good-bye to the Koala, but the little animal had
    heard the Kangaroo speak of blacks, and that word suggested to its empty
    little head that it must keep its skin whole, so, without waiting to be polite
    to Dot, it had sneaked up its gum tree and was well out of sight.</p>
  <p>Without wasting time, Dot settled in the Kangaroo&rsquo;s pouch, and they
    started upon their perilous way.</p>
  <p>For some distance the Kangaroo hopped along boldly, with an occasional warning
    to Dot to shut her eyes as they plunged through the bushes; but after crossing
    a watercourse, and climbing a stiff hill, she whispered that they must both
    keep quite silent, and told Dot to listen as she stopped for a moment.</p>
  <p>Dot could hear to their right a murmuring of voices, and a steady beating
    sound.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Their camp is over there,&rdquo; said the Kangaroo, &ldquo;that is
    the sound of their game.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we go some other way?&rdquo; asked Dot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered
    the Kangaroo, &ldquo;because past that place we can reach some very wild
    country where it would be hard for them to pursue us. We shall have to pass
    quite close to their playground.&rdquo; So in perfect silence they went on.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><img src="0900681h-images/page037.jpg" width="570" height="750"></h3>
  <p>The Kangaroo seemed to Dot to approach the whereabouts of the black fellows
    as cautiously as when they had visited the water-hole the first night. Dot&rsquo;s
    little heart beat fast as the sound of the blacks&rsquo; corroboree became
    clearer and clearer, and they neared the scene of the dance. Soon she could
    hear the stamping of feet, the beating of weapons together, and the wild
    chanting; and sometimes there were the whimperings of dogs, and the cry of
    children at the camp a little distance from the corroboree ground.</p>
  <p>The Kangaroo showed no signs of fear at the increasing noise of the blacks,
    but every sound of a dog caused it to stop and twist about its big ears and
    sensitive nose, as it sniffed and listened.</p>
  <p>Soon Dot could see a great red glare of firelight through the trees ahead
    of their track, and she knew that in that place the tribe of black men were
    having a festive dance.</p>
  <p>If they had gone on their way it is possible that they would have slipped
    past the blacks without danger. But although the Kangaroo is as timid an
    animal as any in the bush, it is also very curious, and Dot&rsquo;s Kangaroo
    wished to peep at the corroboree. She whispered to Dot that it would be nice
    for a little Human to see some other Humans after being so long amongst bush
    creatures, and said, also, that there would be no great danger in hopping
    to a rock that would command a view of the open ground where the corroboree
    was being held. Of course Dot thought this would be great fun, so the Kangaroo
    took her to the rock, where they peeped through the trees and saw before
    them the weird scene and dance.</p>
  <p>Dot nearly screamed with fright at the sight. She had thought she would
    see a few black folk, not a crowd of such terrible people as she beheld.
    They did not look like human beings at all, but like dreadful demons, they
    were so wicked and ugly in appearance. The men who were dancing were without
    clothes, but their black bodies were painted with red and white stripes,
    and bits of down and feathers were stuck on their skin. Some had only white
    stripes over the places where their bones were, which made them look like
    skeletons flitting before the fire, or in and out of the surrounding darkness.
    The dancing men were divided from the rest of the tribe by a row of fires,
    which, burning brightly, lit the horrid scene with a lurid red light. The
    firelight seemed to make the ferocious faces of the dancers still more hideous.
    The tribe people were squatting in rows on the ground, beating boomerangs
    and spears together, or striking bags of skin with sticks, to make an accompaniment
    to the wailing song they sang. Sometimes the women would cease beating the
    skin bags, to clap their hands and strike their sides, yelling the words
    of the corroboree song as the painted figures, like fiends and skeletons,
    danced before the row of fires.</p>
  <p>It was a terrifying sight to Dot. &ldquo;Oh, Kangaroo!&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;they
    are dreadful, horrid creatures.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re just Humans,&rdquo; replied the Kangaroo, indulgently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But white Humans are not like that,&rdquo; said Dot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All Humans are the same underneath, they all kill Kangaroos,&rdquo;  said
    the Kangaroo. &ldquo;Look there! They are playing at killing us in their
    dance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dot looked once more at the hideous figures as they left the fire and behaved
    like actors in a play. One of the black fellows had come from a little bower
    of trees, and wore a few skins so arranged as to make him look as much like
    a Kangaroo as possible, whilst he worked a stick which he pretended was a
    Kangaroo&rsquo;s tail, and hopped about. The other painted savages were creeping
    in and out of the bushes with their spears and boomerangs as if they were
    hunting, and the dressed-up Kangaroo made believe not to see them, but stooped
    down, nibbling grass.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What an idea of a Kangaroo!&rdquo; sniffed Dot&rsquo;s friend, &ldquo;why,
    a real Kangaroo would have smelt or heard those Humans, and have bounded
    away far out of sight by now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s all sham,&rdquo; said Dot; &ldquo;the black man couldn&rsquo;t
    be a real Kangaroo.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then it just shows how stupid Humans are to try and be one,&rdquo; said
    her friend. Humans think themselves so clever,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;but
    just see what bad Kangaroos they make&mdash;such a simple thing to do, too!
    But their legs bend the wrong way for jumping, and that stick isn&rsquo;t
    any good for a tail, and it has to be worked with those big, clumsy arms.
    Just see, too, how those skins fit! Why it&rsquo;s enough to make a Kangaroo&rsquo;s
    sides split with laughter to see such foolery!&rdquo; Dot&rsquo;s friend
    peeped at the black&rsquo;s acting with the contempt to be expected of a
    real Kangaroo, who saw human beings pretending to be one of those noble animals.
    Dot thought the Kangaroo had never looked so grand before. She was so tall,
    so big, and yet so graceful: a really beautiful creature.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s over!&rdquo; remarked the Kangaroo, as one of
    the blacks pretended to spear the dressed-up black fellow, and all the rest
    began to dance around, whilst the sham Kangaroo made believe to be dead. &ldquo;Well,
    I forgive their killing such a silly creature! There wasn&rsquo;t a jump
    in it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After more dancing to the singing and noise of the on-lookers, a black fellow
    came from the little bower in the dim back-ground, with a battered straw
    hat on, and a few rags tied round his neck and wrist, in imitation of a collar
    and cuffs. The fellow tried to act the part of a white man, although he had
    no more clothes on than the old hat and rags. But, after a great deal of
    dancing, he strutted about, pulled up the rag collar, made a great fuss with
    his rag cuffs, and kept taking off his old straw hat to the other black fellows,
    and to the rest of the tribe, who kept up the noise on the other side of
    the fires.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now this is better!&rdquo; said the Kangaroo, with a smile. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
    very silly, but Willy Wagtail says that is just the way Humans go on in the
    town. Black Humans can act being white Humans, but they are no good as Kangaroos.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dot thought that if men behaved like that in towns it must be very strange.
    She had not seen any like the acting black fellow at her cottage home. But
    she did not say anything, for it was quite clear in her little mind that
    black fellows, Kangaroos, and willy wagtails had a very poor opinion of white
    people. She felt that they must all be wrong; but, all the same, she sometimes
    wished she could be a noble Kangaroo, and not a despised human being.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wish I were not a white little girl,&rdquo; she whispered to the
    Kangaroo.</p>
  <p>The gentle animal patted her kindly with her delicate black hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are as nice now as my baby Kangaroo,&rdquo; she said sadly, &ldquo;but
    you will have to grow into a real white Human. For some reason there have
    to be all sorts of creatures on the earth. There are hawks, snakes, dingoes
    and humans, and no one can tell for what good they exist. They must have
    dropped on to this world by mistake for another, where there could only have
    been themselves. After all,&rdquo; said the kind animal, &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t
    do for every one to be a Kangaroo, for I doubt if there would be enough grass;
    but you may become an improved Human.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How could I be that?&rdquo; asked Dot, eagerly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never wear kangaroo leather boots&mdash;never use kangaroo skin rugs,
    and&rdquo;&mdash;here it hesitated a little, as though the subject were a
    most unpleasant one to mention.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never do what?&rdquo; enquired Dot, anxious to know all that she
    should do, so as to be improved.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never, never eat <i>Kangaroo-tail soup!</i>&rdquo; said the Kangaroo,
    solemnly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I never will,&rdquo; said Dot, earnestly, &ldquo;I will be an improved
    Human.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This conversation had been so serious to both Dot and the Kangaroo, that
    they had quite forgotten the perilousness of their position. Perhaps this
    was because the Kangaroo cannot think, but it quickly jumped to the conclusion
    that they were in danger.</p>
  <p>Whilst they had been peeping at the corroborees, and talking, the dingo
    dogs that had been prowling around the camp, had caught scent of the Kangaroo;
    and, following the trail, had set up an angry snapping and howling.</p>
  <p>The instant this sound was heard by the Kangaroo, she made an immense bound,
    and as she seemed to fly through the bush, Dot could hear the sounds of the
    corroboree give place to a noise of shouting and disorder: the dingo dogs
    and the Blacks were all in pursuit, and Dot&rsquo;s Kangaroo, with little
    Dot in her pouch, was leaping and bounding at a terrific pace to save both
    their lives!</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter8"></a>Chapter 8<br>
    The Chase in the Night</b></h2>
  <p>It was fortunate that the Kangaroo could not think of all that might befall
    them, or she never could have had courage for the wonderful feats of jumping
    she performed. Poor little Dot, whose busy brain pictured all kinds of terrible
    fates, was so overcome with fear that she seemed hardly to know what had,
    happened; and the more she thought, the more terrified she became.</p>
  <p>The Kangaroo did not attempt to continue the upward ascent, but followed
    a slope of the rugged hill, leaping from rock to rock. This was better than
    trying to escape where the trees and shrubs would have prevented her making
    those astonishing bounds. But the clouds had left the moon clear for a while,
    so that the black fellows and dogs easily followed every movement, as they
    pursued the hunt on a smoother level below. The blacks were trying to hurry
    on, so as to cut off the Kangaroo&rsquo;s retreat at a spur of the hill,
    where, to get away, she would have to leave the rocks and descend towards
    them. In the meantime Dot&rsquo;s ears were filled with the sounds of snarling
    snaps from the dingo dogs, and hideous noises from the blacks, encouraging
    the animals to attack the Kangaroo. But what pained her most were the gasps
    and little moans of her good friend, as she put such tremendous power into
    every leap she made for their lives; crashing through twigs, and scattering
    stones and pebbles, in the wild speed of their flight.</p>
  <p>Then Dot&rsquo;s busy little brain told her another thing, which made her
    more miserable. It was quite clear that the poor Kangaroo was getting rapidly
    exhausted, owing to her having to bear Dot&rsquo;s weight. Her panting became
    more and more distressing, and so did her sad moans and flecks of foam from
    her straining lips fell on Dot&rsquo;s face and hands. Dot knew that her
    Kangaroo was trying to save her at the risk of her own life. Without the
    little girl in her pouch, she might get away safely; but, with her to carry,
    they would both probably fall victims to the fierce blacks and their dogs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kangaroo! Kangaroo!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;put me down; drop Dot
    anywhere, anywhere, but don&rsquo;t get killed yourself!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But all Dot heard was a little hissing sound from the brave animal, which
    sounded like, &ldquo;Never again!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will be killed,&rdquo; moaned Dot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Together!&rdquo; said the little hissing voice, as another great
    bound brought them to the spur of the hill; and then the Kangaroo had to
    pause.</p>
  <p>In that moment Dot seemed to hear and see everything. They were perched
    on a rock, and the moonlight lit all their surroundings like day. To the
    right was a deep black chasm, with a white foaming waterfall pouring into
    the darkness below. In front was the same wide chasm, only less wide, and
    beyond it, on the other side of the great yawning cleft in the earth, was
    a wild spread of morass country&mdash;a gloomy, terrible-looking place. To
    the left was a steep slope of small rocks and stones, leading downwards to
    the hollow of sedgy land that fringed the cliffs of the chasm. The only retreat
    possible was to pass down this declivity, and try to escape by the sedgy
    land, and this is what the black huntsmen had expected. It was a very weird
    and desolate place; and everything looked dark and dismal, under the moonlight,
    as it streamed between stormy black clouds. In that light Dot could see the
    blacks hurrying forward. Already one of the dogs had far outrun the others,
    and with wolfish gait and savage sounds, was pressing towards their place
    of observation.</p>
  <p>The panting, trembling Kangaroo saw the approaching dog, also, and leaped
    down from the crag. As she dropped to earth, she stooped, and quickly lifted
    Dot out of her pouch, and, almost before Dot could realize the movement,
    she found herself standing alone, whilst the Kangaroo hopped forward to the
    front of a big boulder, as if to meet the dog. Here the poor hunted creature
    took her stand, with her back close to the rock. Gentle and timid as she
    was, and unfitted by nature to fight for her life against fierce odds, it
    was brave indeed of the poor Kangaroo to face her enemies, prepared to do
    battle for the lives of little Dot and herself.</p>
  <p>So noble did Dot&rsquo;s Kangaroo look in that desperate moment, standing
    erect, waiting for her foe, and conquering her naturally frightened nature
    by a grand effort of courage, that it seemed impossible that either dogs
    or men should be so cruel as to take her life. For a moment the dingo hound
    seemed daunted by her bravery, and paused a little way off, panting, with
    its great tongue lolling out of its mouth. Dot could see its sharp, wicked
    teeth gleaming in the moonlight. For a few seconds it hesitated to make the
    attack, and looked back down the slope, to see if the other dogs were coming
    to help; but they were only just beginning the ascent, and the shouting black
    fellows were further off still. Then the dog could no longer control its
    savage nature. It longed to leap at the poor Kangaroo&rsquo;s throat&mdash;that
    pretty furry throat that Dot&rsquo;s arms had so often encircled lovingly,
    and it was impatient to fix its terrible teeth there, and hold, and hold,
    in a wild struggle, until the poor Kangaroo should gradually weaken from
    fear and exhaustion, and be choked to death. These thoughts filled the dog
    with a wicked joy. It wouldn&rsquo;t wait any longer for the other dingo
    hounds. It wanted to murder the Kangaroo all by itself; so, with a toss of
    its head, and a terrible snarl, it sprang forward ferociously, with open
    jaws, aiming at the victim&rsquo;s throat.</p>
  <p>Dot clasped her cold hands together. Tears streamed down her cheeks, and
    her little voice, choking with sobs, could only wail, &ldquo;Oh! dear Kangaroo!
    my dear Kangaroo! Don&rsquo;t kill my dear Kangaroo!&rdquo; and she ran forward
    to throw herself upon the dog and try to save her friend.</p>
  <p>But before the terrified little girl could reach the big rock, the dog had
    made its spring upon her friend. The brave Kangaroo, instead of trying to
    avoid her fierce enemy, opened her little arms, and stood erect and tall
    to receive the attack. The dog in its eagerness, and owing to the nature
    of the ground, misjudged the distance it had to spring. It failed to reach
    the throat it had aimed at, and in a moment the Kangaroo had seized the hound
    in a tight embrace. There was a momentary struggle, the dog snapping and
    trying to free itself, and the Kangaroo holding it firmly. Then she used
    the only weapon she had to defend herself from dogs and men&mdash;the long
    sharp claw in her foot. Whilst she held the dog in her arms, she raised her
    powerful leg, and with that long, strong claw, tore open the dog&rsquo;s
    body. The dog yelped in pain as the Kangaroo threw it to the ground, where
    it lay rolling in agony and dying; for the Kangaroo had given it a terrible
    wound. The other dogs were still some distance below, and the cries of their
    companion caused them to pause in fear and wonder, while the black men could
    be seen advancing in the dim light, flourishing their spears and boomerangs.</p>
  <p>It was quite impossible to retreat that way; and where Dot and her Kangaroo
    were, they were hemmed in by a rocky cliff and the deep black chasm. The
    Kangaroo saw at a glance where lay their only chance of life. She picked
    up Dot, placed her in her pouch, and without a word leaped forward towards
    that fearful gulf of darkness and foaming waters. As they neared the spot,
    Dot saw that the hunted animal was going to try and leap across to the other
    side. It seemed impossible that with one bound she could span that terrible
    place and reach the sedged morass beyond; and still more impossible that
    it should be done by the poor animal with heavy Dot in her pouch. Again Dot
    cried, &ldquo;Oh! darling Kangaroo, leave me here, and save yourself. You
    can never, never do it carrying me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All she heard was something like &ldquo;try,&rdquo; or &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll
    die.&rdquo; She could not make out what the Kangaroo said, for the crashing
    of the waterfall, the whistling of the wind, and the scattering of stones
    as they dashed forward, made such a storm of noises in her ears. She could
    see when they reached the grassy fringe of the precipice, where the Kangaroo
    was able to quicken her pace, and literally seemed to fly to their fate.
    Then came the last bound before the great spring. Dot held her breath, and
    a feeling of sickness came over her. Her head seemed giddy, and she could
    not see, but she clasped her hands together and said, &ldquo;God help my
    Kangaroo!&rdquo; and then she felt the fearful leap with the rush through
    the air.</p>
  <p>Yes! they had reached the other side. No! they had not quite: what was the
    matter? What a struggle! Stones falling, twigs and grasses wrenching, the
    courageous Kangaroo fighting for a foothold on the very brink of the precipice.
    What a terrible moment! Every second Dot felt sure they would fall backward
    and drop deep into the gully below, to be dashed to pieces on the rocks and
    the tree tops. But God did help Dot&rsquo;s Kangaroo; the little reeds and
    rushes held tightly in the earth, and the poor struggling animal, exerting
    all her remaining strength, gained the reedy slope safely. She staggered
    forward a few reeling hops, and then fell to the earth like a dead creature.
    In an instant Dot was out of the pouch and had her arm round the poor animal&rsquo;s
    neck, crying, as she saw blood and foam oozing from her mouth, and a strange
    dim look in her sad eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t die, dear Kangaroo! Oh, please don&rsquo;t die!&rdquo; cried
    Dot, wringing her hands, and burying her face in the fur of the poor gasping
    creature.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dot,&rdquo; panted the Kangaroo, &ldquo;make a noise! Cry loud! Not
    safe yet!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The little girl didn&rsquo;t understand why the Kangaroo wanted her to make
    a noise, and she had, in her fear and sorrow, quite forgotten their pursuers.
    But now she turned, and could hear the blacks, urging on their dogs as they
    were making an attempt to skirt round the precipice, and gain the other side
    of the chasm. So Dot did as she was told, and screamed and cried like the
    most naughty of children; and the gasping Kangaroo told her to go on doing
    so.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><img src="0900681h-images/page045.jpg" width="588" height="750"></h3>
  <p>Then what seemed to Dot a very terrifying thing happened; for she soon heard
    other cries mingle with hers. From the desolate morass, and from the gully
    in darkness below, came the sound of a bellowing. She stopped crying and
    listened, and could hear those awesome voices all around, and the echoes
    made them still more hobgoblinish. The Kangaroo&rsquo;s eyes brightened,
    as she restrained her panting, and listened also. &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; she
    said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re safe now,&rdquo; so Dot made more crying, and her
    noises and the others would have frightened anyone who had heard them in
    that lonely place, with the wind storming in the trees, and the black clouds
    flying over the moon. It frightened the black fellows directly.</p>
  <p>They stopped in their headlong speed, shouting all together in their shrill
    voices, &ldquo;The Bunyip! The Bunyip!&rdquo; and they tumbled over one another
    in their hurry to get away from a place haunted, as they thought, by that
    wicked demon which they fear so much. At full speed they fled back to their
    camp, with the sound of Dot&rsquo;s cries, and the mysterious bellowing noise,
    following them on the breeze; and they never stopped running until they regained
    the light of their camp fires. There they told the gins, in awe-struck voices,
    how it had been no Kangaroo they had hunted, but the &ldquo;Bunyip&rdquo;,
    who had pretended to be one. And the black gins&rsquo; eyes grew wider and
    wider, and they made strange noises and exclamations, as they listened to
    the story of how the &ldquo;Bunyip&rdquo;  had led the huntsmen to that dreadful
    place. How it had torn one of the dogs to pieces, and had leaped over the
    precipice into Dead Man&rsquo;s Gully, where it had cried like a picaninny,
    and bellowed like a bull. No one slept in the camp that night, and early
    the next morning the whole tribe went away, being afraid to remain so near
    the haunt of the dreaded &ldquo;Bunyip.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dot saw the flight of the blacks in the dim distance, and told the good
    news to the Kangaroo, who, however, was too exhausted to rejoice at their
    escape. She still lay where she had fallen, gasping, and with her tongue
    hanging down from her mouth like that of a dog.</p>
  <p>In vain Dot caressed her, and called her by endearing names; she lay quite
    still, as if unable to hear or feel. Dot&rsquo;s little heart swelled within
    her, and taking the poor animal&rsquo;s drooping head on her lap, she sat
    quite still and tearless; waiting in that solitude for her one friend to
    die&mdash;leaving her lonely and helpless.</p>
  <p>Presently she was startled by hearing a brisk voice: &ldquo;Then it was
    a human picaninny, after all! Well, my dear, what are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dot turned her head without moving, and saw a little way behind her a brown
    bird on long legs, standing with its feet close together, with the self-satisfied
    air of a dancing master about to begin a lesson.</p>
  <p>Dot did not care for any other creature in the Bush just then but her Kangaroo,
    and the perky air of the bird annoyed her in her sorrow. Without answering,
    she bent her head closer down to that of her poor friend, to see if her eyes
    were still shut, and wondered if they would ever open and look bright and
    gentle again.</p>
  <p>The little brown bird strutted with all important air to where it had a
    better view of Dot and her companion, and eyed them both in the same perky
    manner. &ldquo;Friend Kangaroo&rsquo;s in a bad way,&rdquo; it said; &ldquo;why
    don&rsquo;t you do something sensible, instead of messing about with its
    head?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo; whimpered Dot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give it water, and damp its skin, of course,&rdquo; said the little
    Bird, contemptuously. &ldquo;What fools Humans are,&rdquo; it exclaimed to
    itself. &ldquo;And I suppose you will tell me there is no water here, when
    all the time you are sitting on a spring.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m sitting on grass,&rdquo; said Dot, now fully attentive
    to the bird&rsquo;s remarks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, booby,&rdquo; sneered the bird, &ldquo;and under the grass
    is wet moss, which, if you make a hole in it, will fill with water. Why,
    I&rsquo;d do it myself, in a moment, only your claws are better suited for
    the purpose than mine. Set about it at once!&rdquo; it said sharply.</p>
  <p>In an instant Dot did what the bird directed, and thrust her little hands
    into the soft grass roots and moss, out of which water pressed, as if from
    a sponge. She had soon made a little hole, and the most beautiful clear water
    welled up into it at once. Then, in the hollows of her little hands, she
    collected it, and dashed it over the Kangaroo&rsquo;s parched tongue, and,
    further instructed by the kindly though rude little bird, she had soon well
    wetted the suffering animal&rsquo;s fur. Gradually the breathing of the Kangaroo
    became less of an effort, her tongue moistened and returned to the mouth,
    and at last Dot saw with joy the brown eyes open, and she knew that her good
    friend was not going to die, but would get well again. Whilst all this took
    place, the little brown bird stood on one leg, with its head cocked on one
    side, watching the Kangaroo&rsquo;s recovery with a comic expression of curiosity
    and conceit. When it spoke to Dot, it did so without any attempt at being
    polite, and Dot thought it the strangest possible creature, because it was
    really very kind in helping to save the Kangaroo&rsquo;s life, and yet it
    seemed to delight in spoiling its kind-heartedness by its rudeness. Afterwards
    the Kangaroo told her that the little Bittern is a really tender-hearted
    fellow, but he has an idea that kindness in rather small creatures provokes
    the contempt of the big ones. As he always wants to be thought a bigger bird
    than he is, he pretends to be hard-hearted by being rough; consequently,
    nearly all the Bush creatures simply regard him as a rude little bird, because
    bad manners are no proof of being grown-up; rather the contrary.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you feel now?&rdquo; asked the Bittern, as the Kangaroo presently
    struggled up and squatted rather feebly on her haunches, looking about in
    a somewhat dazed way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m better now,&rdquo; said the Kangaroo, &ldquo;but, dear
    me, how everything seems to dance up and down!&rdquo; She shut her eyes,
    for she felt giddy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That was rather a good jump of yours,&rdquo; said the Bittern, patronizingly,
    as if jumps for life like that of Dot&rsquo;s Kangaroo were made every day,
    and he was a judge of them!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, I remember!&rdquo; said the Kangaroo, opening her eyes again
    and looking round. &ldquo;Where is Dot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Umph, that silly!&rdquo; exclaimed the Bittern, as Dot came forward,
    and she and the Kangaroo rejoiced over each other&rsquo;s safety. &ldquo;Much
    good she&rsquo;d have been to you with the blacks, and their dogs after you,
    if we Bitterns hadn&rsquo;t played that old trick of ours of scaring them
    with our big voices. He! he! he!&rdquo;  it chuckled, &ldquo;how they did
    run when we tuned up! They thought the Bunyip had got them this time. Didn&rsquo;t
    we laugh!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was very good of you,&rdquo; said the Kangaroo gratefully, &ldquo;and
    it is not the first time you have saved Kangaroos by your cleverness. I didn&rsquo;t
    know you Bitterns were near, so I told Dot to make a noise in the hope of
    frightening them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Bittern was really touched by the Kangaroo&rsquo;s gratitude, and was
    delighted at being called clever, so it became still more ungracious. &ldquo;You
    needn&rsquo;t trouble me with thanks,&rdquo; it said indifferently, &ldquo;we
    didn&rsquo;t do it to save you, but for our own fun. As for that little stupid,&rdquo; it
    continued, with a nod of the head towards Dot, &ldquo;her squeals were no
    more good than the squeak of a tree frog in a Bittern&rsquo;s beak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you were very kind,&rdquo; said Dot, &ldquo;and showed me how
    to get water to save Kangaroo&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Bittern was greatly pleased at this praise, and in consequence it got
    still ruder, and making a face at Dot, exclaimed, &ldquo;Yah!&rdquo; and
    stalked off. But when it had gone a few steps it turned round and said to
    the Kangaroo, roughly, &ldquo;If you hop that way, keeping to the side of
    the sedges, and go half a dozen small hops beyond that white gum tree, you&rsquo;ll
    find a little cave. It&rsquo;s dry and warm, and good enough for Kangaroos.&rdquo; And
    without waiting for thanks for this last kind act, it spread its wings and
    flew away.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter9"></a>Chapter 9<br>
    The Kangaroo&rsquo;s Story</b></h2>
  <p>The Kangaroo, hopping very weakly, and little Dot trudging over the oozy
    ground, followed the Bittern&rsquo;s directions and found the cave, which
    proved a very snug retreat. Here they lay down together, full of happiness
    at their escape, and worn out with fatigue and excitement, they were soon
    fast asleep.</p>
  <p>The next day, before the sun rose, the Bittern visited the cave. &ldquo;Hullo,
    you precious lazy pair! I&rsquo;ve been over there,&rdquo; and it tossed
    its beak in the direction of the blacks&rsquo; camp. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
    off northward. Too frightened to stay. I thought you might like the news
    brought you, since you&rsquo;re too lazy to get it for yourselves!&rdquo; and
    off it went again without saying good-bye.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now isn&rsquo;t he a kind little fellow?&rdquo; said the Kangaroo. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
    his way of telling us that we are safe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thanks, Bittern! thanks!&rdquo; they both cried, but the creamy brown
    bird paid no attention to their gratitude: it seemed absorbed in looking
    for frogs on its way.</p>
  <p>All that day the Kangaroo and Dot stayed near the cave, so that the poor
    animal might get quite well again. The Kangaroo said she did not know that
    part of the country, and so she had better get her legs again before they
    faced fresh dangers. Neither of them was so bright and merry as before. The
    weather was showery, and Dot kept thinking that perhaps she would never get
    home, now she had been so long away, and she kept remembering the time when
    the little boy was lost and everyone&rsquo;s sadness.</p>
  <p>The Kangaroo too seemed melancholy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What makes you sad?&rdquo; asked Dot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am thinking of the last time before this that I was hunted. It
    was then I lost my baby Kangaroo,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! you poor dear thing!&rdquo; exclaimed Dot, &ldquo;and have you
    been hunted before last night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Kangaroo with a little weary sigh. &ldquo;It
    was just a few days before I found you. White Humans did it that time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell me all about it,&rdquo; said Dot. &ldquo;How did you escape?&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><img src="0900681h-images/page049.jpg" width="581" height="750"></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;I escaped then,&rdquo; said the Kangaroo, settling herself on her
    haunches to tell the tale, &ldquo;in a way I could have done last night.
    But I will die sooner than do it again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; repeated Dot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is not much to tell,&rdquo; said the Kangaroo. &ldquo;My little
    Joey was getting quite big, and we were very happy. It was a lovely Joey.
    It was so strong, and could jump so well for its size. It had the blackest
    of little noses and hands and tail you ever saw, and big soft ears which
    heard more quickly than mine. All day long I taught it jumping, and we played
    and were merry from sunrise to sunset. Until that day I had never been sad,
    and I thought all the creatures must be wrong to say that in this beautiful
    world there could be such cruel beings as they said White Humans were. That
    day taught me I was wrong, and I know now that the world is a sad place because
    Humans make it so; although it was made to be a happy place. We were playing
    on the side of a plain that day, and our game was hide and seek in the long
    grass. We were having great fun, when suddenly little Joey said, &lsquo;strange
    creatures are coming, big ones.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hopped up to the stony rise that fringed the plain, and I thought
    as I did so that I could hear a new sound on the breeze. Joey hid in the
    grass, but I went boldly into the open on the hillside to see where the danger
    was. I saw, far off, Humans on their big animals that go so quickly, and
    directly I hopped into the open, they raised a great noise like the blacks
    did last night, and I could see by the movement in the grass that they had
    those dreadful dogs they teach to kill us: they are far worse than dingoes.
    Joey heard the shouting and bounded into my pouch, and I went off as fast
    as I could. It was a worse hunt than last night, for it was longer, and there
    was no darkness to help me. I gradually got ahead in the chase, and I knew
    if I were alone I could distance them all; for we had seen them a long way
    off. But little Joey was heavy, though not so heavy as you are, and in the
    long distance I began to feel weak, as I did last night.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I knew if I tried to go on as we were, that those cruel Humans (doing
    nothing but sit quietly on those big beasts, which have four legs and never
    get tired) would overtake us, and their dogs (which carry no weight and go
    so fast) would tear me down before their masters even arrived, for I was
    going gradually slower. So I asked Joey if I dropped him into a soft bush
    whether he would hide until I came back for him. It was our only chance.
    I had an idea that if I did that he would be safe&mdash;even if I got killed;
    as they would be more likely to follow me, and never think I had parted from
    my little Joey. So we did this, and I crossed a creek, which put the hounds
    off the scent, and I got away. In the dusk I came back again to find Joey,
    but he had gone, and I could not find a trace of him. All night and all day
    I searched, but I&rsquo;ve never seen my Joey since,&rdquo; said the Kangaroo
    sadly, and Dot saw the tears dim her eyes.</p>
  <p>Dot could not speak all she felt. She was so sorry for the Kangaroo, and
    so ashamed of being a Human. She realised too, how good and forgiving this
    dear animal was; how she had cared for her, and nearly died to save her life,
    in spite of the wrongs done to her by human beings.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When I grow up,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I will never let anyone hurt
    a bush creature. They shall all be happy where I am.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But there are so many Humans. They&rsquo;re getting to be as many
    as Kangaroos.&rdquo; said the animal reflectively, and shook her head.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter10"></a>Chapter 10<br>
    The Search for Willy Wagtail</b></h2>
  <p>The fourth day of Dot&rsquo;s wanderings in the Bush dawned brightly. The
    sun arose in a sky all gorgeous in gold and crimson, and flashed upon a world
    glittering with dewy freshness. Sweet odours from the aromatic bush filled
    the air, and every living creature made what noise it could, to show its
    joy in being happy and free in the beautiful Bush. Rich and gurgling came
    the note of the magpies, the jovial kookooburras saluted the sun with rollicking
    laughter, the crickets chirruped, frogs croaked in chorus, or solemnly &ldquo;popped&rdquo;  in
    deep vibrating tones, like the ring of a woodman&rsquo;s axe. Every now and
    then came the shriek of the plover, or the shrill cry of the peeweet; and
    gayer and more lively than all others was the merry clattering of the big
    bush wagtail in the distance.</p>
  <p>As soon as the Kangaroo heard the Bush Wagtail, she and Dot hurried away
    to find him. No Christy Minstrel rattling his bones ever made a merrier sound. &ldquo;Click-i-ti-clack,
    click-i-ti-clack, clack, clack, clack, clack, click-i-ti-clack,&rdquo; he
    rattled away as fast as he could, just as if he hadn&rsquo;t a moment to
    waste for taking breath, and as if the whole lovely world was made for the
    enjoyment of Bush Wagtails.</p>
  <p>When Dot and the Kangaroo found him, he was swaying about on a branch, spreading
    his big tail like a fan, and clattering gaily; but he stopped in surprise
    as soon as he saw his visitors.</p>
  <p>After greetings, he opened the conversation by talking of the weather, so
    as to conceal his astonishment at seeing Dot and the the Kangaroo together.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lovely weather after the rain,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the showers
    were needed very much, for insects were getting scarce, and I believe grass
    was rank, and not very plentiful. There will be a green shoot in a few days,
    which will be very welcome to Kangaroos. I heard about you losing your Joey&mdash;my
    cousin told me. I was very sorry; so sad. Ah! well, such things will happen
    in the bush to anyone. We were most fortunate in our brood; none of the chicks
    fell out of the nest, every one of them escaped the Butcher Birds and were
    strong of wing. They are all doing well in the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then the vivacious bird came a little nearer to the Kangaroo, and, dropping
    his voice, said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, friend Kangaroo, I&rsquo;m sorry to see you&rsquo;ve taken up
    with Humans. You know I have quite set my face against being on familiar
    terms with them, although my cousin is intimate with the whole race. Take
    my word for it, they&rsquo;re most uncertain friends. Two Kookooburras were
    shot last week, in spite of Government protection. Fact!&rdquo; And as the
    bird spoke he nodded his head warningly towards the place where Dot was standing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This little Human has been lost in our Bush,&rdquo; said the Kangaroo; &ldquo;one
    had to take care of her, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course, of course; there are exceptions to all rules,&rdquo;  chattered
    the Wagtail. &ldquo;And so this is really the lost little Human there has
    been such a fuss about!&rdquo; added he, eyeing Dot, and making a long whistle
    of surprise. &ldquo;My cousin told me all about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then your cousin, Willy Wagtail, knows her lost way,&rdquo; said
    the Kangaroo joyfully, and Dot came a little nearer in her eagerness to hear
    the good news.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course he does,&rdquo; answered the bird; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
    nothing happens that he doesn&rsquo;t know. You should have hunted him up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know where to find him,&rdquo; said the Kangaroo, &ldquo;and
    I got into this country, which is new to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why he is in the same part that he nested in last season. It&rsquo;s
    no distance off,&rdquo; exclaimed the Wagtail. &ldquo;If you could fly, you&rsquo;d
    be there almost directly!&rdquo; Then the bird gave a long description of
    the way they were to follow to find his cousin Willy, and with many warm
    thanks the Kangaroo and Dot bade him adieu.</p>
  <p>As they left the Bush Wagtail they could hear him singing this song, which
    shows what a merry, happy fellow he is:</p>
  <p>Click-i-ti, click-i-ti-clack!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clack! clack! clack! clack!<br>
    Who could cry in such weather, &lsquo;alack!&rsquo;<br>
    With a sky so blue, and a sun so bright,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing &lsquo;winter, winter, winter is back!&rsquo;<br>
    Sportive in flight, chatter delight,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click-i-ti, click-i-ti-clack!</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;m so glad that I have the knack<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of singing clack! clack! clack!<br>
    If you wish to be happy, just follow my track,<br>
    Take this for a motto, this for a code,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing &lsquo;winter, winter, winter is back!&rsquo;<br>
    Leave care to a toad, and live a la mode!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click-i-ti, click-i-ti-clack! </p>
  <p>They had no difficulty in following the Wagtail&rsquo;s directions. They
    soon struck a creek they had been told to pursue to its end, and about noon
    they found themselves in very pretty country. It reminded Dot of the journey
    they had made to find the Platypus, for there were the same beautiful growths
    of fern and shrubs. There were also great trailing creepers which hung down
    like ropes from the tops of the tall trees they had climbed. These ropelike
    coils of the creepers made capital swings, and often Dot clambered into one
    of the big loops and sat swinging herself to and fro, laughing and singing,
    much to the delight and amusement of the Kangaroo.</p>
  <p>Swing! swing! a bird on the wing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not more happy than I!<br>
    Stooping to earth, and seeking the sky.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swing! swing! swing!<br>
    See how high upward I fly!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, midst the leaves I swing;<br>
    Then, as fast to my swing I cling,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down I come from the sky!<br>
    Swing! swing! a bird on the wing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is not more happy than I! </p>
  <p>Thus sang little Dot, tossing herself backwards and forwards, and the Kangaroo,
    squatting below, came to the conclusion that there was something very sweet
    about little Humans, and that Dot was certainly quite as nice as a Joey Kangaroo.</p>
  <p>In the middle of one of these little swinging diversions, a bird about the
    size of a pigeon, with the most wonderfully shiny plumage, flew to the tree
    from which Dot&rsquo;s creeper swing hung. Dot was so struck by the bird&rsquo;s
    beautiful blue-black glossy appearance, and its brightly contrasting yellow
    beak and legs, that she stopped swinging at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You <i>are</i> a pretty bird!&rdquo;  she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am a Satin Bower Bird,&rdquo; it said. &ldquo;We heard you singing,
    and we thought, therefore, that you probably enjoy parties, so I have come
    to invite you to one of our assemblies which will take place shortly. Friend
    Kangaroo, we know, is of a somewhat serious nature, but probably she will
    do us the pleasure of accompanying you to our little entertainment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall have great pleasure in doing so,&rdquo; said the Kangaroo; &ldquo;I
    have not been to any of your parties for a long time. You know, I suppose,
    that I lost my Joey very sadly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We heard all about it,&rdquo; replied the Bower Bird in a tone of
    exaggerated, almost ridiculous sadness, for it was so anxious that the Kangaroo
    should think that it felt very deeply for her loss. &ldquo;We were in the
    middle of a meeting at the time the Wallaby brought the news, and we were
    so sad that we nearly broke up our assembly. But it would have been a pity
    to do so, really, as the young birds enjoy themselves so much at the &lsquo;Bower
    of Pleasure&rsquo;. But,&rdquo;  said the Satin Bird, with a sudden change
    of tone from extreme sorrow to one of vivacious interest, &ldquo;I must show you
    the way to the bower, or you would never find it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dot jumped down from the swing, and she and the Kangaroo, guided by the
    Satin Bird, made their way through some very thickly-grown bush. The bird
    was certainly right in saying that they would never have found the Bower
    of Pleasure without a guide. It was carefully concealed in the most densely
    grown scrub. As they were pushing their way through a thicket of shrubs,
    before reaching the open space where the Satin Birds&rsquo; bower was built,
    they heard an increasing noise of birds all talking to one another. The din
    of this chattering was enhanced considerably by the shrill sounds of tree
    frogs and crickets, and the hubbub made Dot feel like the little Native Bear&mdash;as
    if her &ldquo;head was empty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This will be a very pleasant party,&rdquo; said the Satin Bird, &ldquo;there
    is plenty of conversation, so everyone&rsquo;s in a good humour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you think anyone is listening, or are they all talking?&rdquo;  enquired
    the Kangaroo timidly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nobody would attempt to listen,&rdquo; answered the Satin Bird, &ldquo;it
    would be impossible against the music of the tree frogs and crickets, so
    everyone talks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I should tell the tree frogs and crickets to be quiet,&rdquo; said
    Dot,  &ldquo;no one seems to care for their music.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, without music it would be very dull,&rdquo; explained the Satin
    Bird. &ldquo;No one would care to talk. You understand, it would be awkward,
    someone might overhear what was said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As the bird spoke the trio reached the place where the bower was situated.</p>
  <p>Dot thought it a most curious sight. In the middle of an open space the
    birds had built the flooring of twigs, and upon that they had erected a bower
    about three feet high, also constructed of twigs interwoven with grass, and
    arranged so as nearly to meet at the top in an arched form.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a new bower, and more commodious than our last,&rdquo; said
    the Satin Bird with an air of great satisfaction. &ldquo;What do you think
    of the decorations?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In a temporary lull of the frog and cricket band and the conversation, Dot
    and the Kangaroo praised the bower and its decorations, and enquired politely
    how the birds had managed to procure such a collection of ornaments for their
    pleasure hall. Several young bower birds came and joined in the chat, and
    Dot was surprised to see how different their plumage was from the satin blue-black
    of the old birds. These younger members of the community were of a greenish
    yellow colour, with dark pencillings on their feathers, and had no glossy
    sheen like their elders.</p>
  <p>Each of them pointed out some ornament that it had brought with which to
    deck the bower. One had brought the pink feathers of a Galah, which had been
    stuck here and there amongst the twigs. Others had collected the delicate
    shells of land snails, and put them round about the entrance. But the birds
    that were proudest of their contributions were those who had picked up odds
    and ends at the camps of bushmen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That beautiful bright thing I brought from a camp a mile away,&rdquo;  said
    a bird, indicating a tag from a cake of tobacco.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t so pretty as mine,&rdquo; said another, pointing
    to the glass stopper of a sauce bottle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or mine,&rdquo; chimed in another bird, as it claimed a bright piece
    of tin from a milk-can that was inserted in the twigs just above the entrance
    of the bower.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense, children!&rdquo; said a grave old Satin Bird, &ldquo;your
    trifles are not to be compared with that beautiful object I found to-day
    and arranged along the top of the bower. The effect is splendid!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As he spoke, Dot observed that, twined amidst the topmost twigs of the construction
    was a strip of red flannel from an old shirt, a bedraggled red rag that must
    have been found in an extinct camp fire, judging by its singed edges.</p>
  <p>The day Dot had lost her way she had been threading beads, and she still
    had upon her finger a ring of the pretty coloured pieces of glass. She saw
    the old Satin Bird look at this ring longingly, so she pulled it off, and
    begged that it might be added to the other decorations. It was instantly
    given the place of honour&mdash;over the entrance and above the piece of
    milk tin.</p>
  <p>This gift from Dot caused an immediate flow of conversation, because every
    bird was pleased to have something to talk about. They all began to say how
    beautiful the beads were. &ldquo;Quite too lovely!&rdquo; said one. &ldquo;What
    a charming little Human!&rdquo; exclaimed another. &ldquo;Just the finish
    that our bower required,&rdquo;  was a general remark, and a great many kept
    exclaiming, &ldquo;So tasteful!&rdquo; &ldquo;So sweet!&rdquo; &ldquo;How
    elegant!&rdquo; &ldquo;Exquisite!&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a love!&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
    a dear!&rdquo; and so on. A great deal more was said, but the oldest bower
    bird, thinking that all the adjectives were getting used up, told the frogs
    and crickets to start the music again, so as to keep the excitement going,
    and all further observations were drowned in the noise.</p>
  <p>Presently the younger birds flew down to the bower, and began to play and
    dance. Like a troop of children, they ran round and round the bower, and
    to and fro through it, gleefully chasing each other. Then they would assemble
    in groups, and hop up and down, and dance to one another in what Dot thought
    a rather awkward fashion; but she was thinking of the elegance and grace
    of the Native Companions, who can make beautiful movements with their long
    legs and necks, whilst these little bower birds are rather ungainly in their
    steps.</p>
  <p>What amused her was to see how the young cock birds showed off to the little
    hens. They were conceited fellows, and only seemed happy when they had five
    or six little hens looking admiringly at their every movement. At such times
    they would dance and hop with great delight; and the little hens, in a circle
    round them, watched their hops and steps with absorbed interest. Immensely
    pleased with himself, the young dancer would fluff out his feathers, so as
    to look as big as possible, and after strutting about, would suddenly shoot
    out a leg and a wing, first on one side and then on the other, then spring
    high into the air, and do a sort of step dance when his feet touched the
    earth again. Endless were the tricks he resorted to, to show off his feathers
    and dancing to the best advantage; and the little hens watched it all with
    silent intentness.</p>
  <p>In the meantime the frogs and crickets stopped to rest, and Dot could hear
    the conversation of some of the old birds perched near her. A little party
    of elderly hens were discussing the young birds who were dancing at the bower.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I must say I don&rsquo;t admire that new step which is becoming so
    popular amongst the young birds,&rdquo; said one elderly hen; and all her
    companions rustled their feathers, closed their beaks tightly, and nodded
    their heads in various ways. One said it was &ldquo;rough,&rdquo; another
    that it was &ldquo;ungainly,&rdquo; and others that it was &ldquo;unmannerly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As for manners,&rdquo; said the first speaker, &ldquo;the bower birds
    of this day can&rsquo;t be said to have any!&rdquo; and all her companions
    chorused, &ldquo;No, indeed!&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><img src="0900681h-images/page057.jpg" width="586" height="750"></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;In my young day,&rdquo; continued the elderly hen, and all the group
    were sighing, &ldquo;Ah! in our young days!&rdquo; when a young hen perched
    on a bough above them, and interrupted pertly, &ldquo;Dear me, can&rsquo;t
    you good birds find anything more interesting to talk about than ancient
    history?&rdquo; At this the group of gossips whispered angrily to one another, &ldquo;Minx!&rdquo; &ldquo;Hussy!&rdquo; &ldquo;Wild
    cat!&rdquo;  etc., and the rude young bird flew back to her companions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What I object to most in young birds,&rdquo; said another elderly
    hen, &ldquo;is their appearance. Some of them do nothing all day but preen
    their feathers. Look at the over-studied arrangements of their wing flights,
    and the affected exactness of their tail feathers! One looks in vain for
    sweetness and simplicity in the present-day young bower birds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even that is better than the newer fashion of scarcely preening the
    feathers at all,&rdquo; observed another of the group. &ldquo;Many of the
    young birds take no pride in their feathers whatever, but devote all their
    time to studying the habits of out-of-the-way insects.&rdquo; A chorus of
    disapproval from all present supported this remark. &ldquo;Studies that interfere
    with a young hen&rsquo;s appearance should not be permitted,&rdquo; said
    one bird.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is the good of knowing all about insects, when we live on berries
    and fruit!&rdquo; exclaimed another.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The sight of insects gives one the creeps!&rdquo; said a third.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am thankful to say all my little hens care for nothing beyond playing
    at the Bower and preening their feathers,&rdquo; said an affectionate bower
    bird mother. &ldquo;They get a deal of attention paid to them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>No young Satin Bird would look at a learned little bower-hen, said the bird
    who had first objected to untidy and studious young hens. &ldquo;For my part,
    I never allow a chick of mine even to mention insects, unless they are well
    known beetles!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dot thought this chattering very stupid, so she went round a bush to where
    the old fathers of the bower birds were perched. They were grave old fellows,
    arrayed in their satin blue-black plumage, and she found them all, more or
    less, in a grumbling humour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Birds at our time of life should not have to attend parties,&rdquo;  said
    several, and Dot wondered why they came. &ldquo;How are you, old neighbour?&rdquo;  said
    one to another. &ldquo;Terribly bored!&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;How long
    must we stay, do you think?&rdquo; asked another. &ldquo;Oh! until these
    young fools have finished amusing themselves,&rdquo; answered its friend.
    The only satin birds who seemed to Dot to be interested in one another, were
    some engaged in discussing the scarcity of berries and the wrongs done to
    bower birds by White Humans destroying the wild fig and lillipilli trees.
    This grievance, and the question as to what berries or figs agreed best with
    each old bower bird&rsquo;s digestion, were the only topics discussed with
    any animation.</p>
  <p>Dot soon tired of listening to the birds, and returned to the Kangaroo,
    who asked her if she cared to stay longer. The little girl said she had seen
    and heard enough, and, judging by this one, she didn&rsquo;t care for parties.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Neither do I,&rdquo; whispered the Kangaroo; &ldquo;they make me
    feel tired; and, somehow, they seem to remind one of everything one knows
    that&rsquo;s sad, in spite of all the gaiety.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is it gay?&rdquo; enquired Dot, hesitating a little in her speech,
    for she had felt rather dull and miserable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, everyone says it&rsquo;s gay, and there is always a deal of
    noise, so I suppose it is,&rdquo; answered the Kankaroo.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather be in your pouch, so let us go away,&rdquo; entreated
    Dot; and they left the bower place without any of the birds noticing their
    departure, for they were all busy gossiping, or discussing the great berry
    or digestion questions.</p>
  <p>It was towards evening when they reached an open plain, and here they met
    an Emu. As both Dot and the Kangaroo were thirsty, they asked the Emu the
    way to a waterhole or tank.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am going to a tank now,&rdquo; replied the Emu; &ldquo;let us proceed
    together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you think it will be safe to drink to-night;&rdquo; enquired the
    Kangaroo anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, to tell the truth,&rdquo; said the Emu lightly, &ldquo;it is
    likely to be a little difficult. There is a somewhat strained feeling between
    the White Humans and ourselves just now. In consequence, we have to resort
    to a little strategy on our visits to the tanks, and we avoid eating anything
    tempting left about at camping places.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are they laying poison for you?&rdquo; asked the Kangaroo in horrified
    tones.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They are doing something of the kind, we think,&rdquo; answered the
    Emu airily, &ldquo;for some of us have had most unpleasant symptoms after
    picking up morsels at camping grounds. Several have died. We were quite surprised,
    for hitherto there has been no better cure for Emu indigestion than wire
    nails, hoop iron, and preserved milk cans. The worst symptoms have yielded
    to scraps of barbed wire in my own case. But these Emus died in spite of
    all remedies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I heard,&rdquo; said the Kangaroo, &ldquo;that Emus were protected
    by the Government. I never understood why.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We are protected,&rdquo; said the huge bird, &ldquo;because we form
    part of the Australian Arms.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So do we,&rdquo; said the Kangaroo, &ldquo;and we are not protected.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said the bird, &ldquo;but the Humans can make some money
    out of you when you are dead, whereas we serve no purpose at all, excepting
    alive, when we add a charm to the scenery; and, moreover, each of our eggs
    will make a pound cake. But the time will come, friend, when there will be
    neither Emu nor Kangaroo for Australia&rsquo;s Arms; no creature will be
    left to represent the land but the Bunny Rabbit and the Sheep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hate sheep!&rdquo; said the Kangaroo, &ldquo;they eat all our grass.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have not studied them as we have,&rdquo; answered the Emu. &ldquo;They
    are most entertaining. We have great fun with them, and we&rsquo;ve learnt
    some capital sheep games from those dogs Humans drive them with. It&rsquo;s
    really exciting to drive a big mob, when they want to break and scatter.
    We were chasing them, here and there, all over the plain to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like sheep!&rdquo; said Dot, &ldquo;they are so stupid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So they are,&rdquo; agreed the Emu, &ldquo;and that is what puzzles
    me. What is it about the sight of sheep that excites one so? When one gets
    into a big flock, one has to dance, one can&rsquo;t help oneself. We had
    a great dance in a flock to-day, and the lambs would get under our feet,
    so I&rsquo;m sorry to say a good many of them were killed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Men will certainly kill you, if you do that,&rdquo; said Dot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We know it,&rdquo; chuckled the Emu; &ldquo;that is why the tank
    is not quite safe just now. But this evening I will show you a new plan by
    which to learn if Humans are camped at a tank, or not. We have played the
    trick with great success for several nights.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Conversing thus, the Emu, the Kangaroo, and Dot wandered on until the Emu
    requested them to wait for a few minutes, whilst it peeped at the tank, which
    was still a long way off.</p>
  <p>It presently returned and said that it felt quite suspicious, because everything
    looked so clear and safe. &ldquo;From his point of high ground,&rdquo;  said
    the bird, &ldquo;you can watch our proceedings. I will now give the signal
    and return to my post here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Emu then ran at a great pace along the edge of the plain, and emitted
    a strange rattling cry. After disappearing from sight for a time, it returned
    hurriedly to where Dot and her friend were waiting.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, see!&rdquo; said the Emu, nodding at the distant side of the
    plain.</p>
  <p>Dot&rsquo;s eyes were not so keen of sight as those of an Emu; but she thought
    she could see something like a little cloud of dust, far, far away across
    the dry brown grass of the plain. Soon she was quite sure that the little
    cloud was advancing towards her side of the plain, and in the direction of
    the tank. As it came nearer she could see the bobbing heads of Emus, popping
    up above the dust, and she could see some of the birds running round the
    little cloud.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is the cause of all that dust?&rdquo; she asked the Emu.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sheep!&rdquo; it answered with a merry chuckle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But what are the Emus doing with the sheep?&rdquo; asked Dot and
    the Kangaroo, now fully interested in the Emu&rsquo;s manoeuvre.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They are driving them to water at the tank,&rdquo; said the bird,
    highly delighted with the scheme. &ldquo;The sheep will soon know that they
    are near water, and will go to it without driving. Then we shall watch, and
    if they quietly drink and scatter, it will be safe for us, but if they see
    anything unusual and break, and run&mdash;well, we shan&rsquo;t drink at
    the tank to-night. There will be Humans and dogs there, and we don&rsquo;t
    cultivate their society just now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Really that is the cleverest thing I have heard for a long time,&rdquo;  said
    the Kangaroo, full of admiration for the trick. &ldquo;How did you jump to
    that conclusion?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The idea sprang upon us,&rdquo; answered the Emu, with an immense
    hop in the air, and a dancing movement when it came to the ground again. &ldquo;Dear
    me!&rdquo;  it exclaimed, &ldquo;the sight of those sheep is beginning to
    excite me, and I can hardly keep still! I wonder what there is so exciting
    about sheep!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dot could now see the advancing flock of sheep, with their attendant mob
    of Emu, quite well. The animals had got scent of the water, and with contented
    bleatings were slowly moving with a rippling effect across the dusty plain.
    The mob of Emu soon left the sheep to go their own way, and, grouped in a
    cluster, watched, with bobbing heads, every movement of the flock.</p>
  <p>Dot, the Kangaroo, and the Emu looked towards the tank with silent interest. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
    stationed here,&rdquo; whispered the bird, &ldquo;to give a warning in case
    there is any danger in this direction. Emu are posted all round the tank
    on the same duty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dot could see the whole scene well, for beyond a few low shrubs on the opposite
    side of the sheet of water, there was no sheltering bush near the great tank
    which had been excavated on the bare plain.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><img src="0900681h-images/page061.jpg" width="580" height="750"></h3>
  <p>Onward came the sheep, and quite stationary in the distance remained the
    Emu mob. Just as the first sheep were descending the deep slope of the tank,
    a Plover rose from amongst the bushes with a shrill cry. The Emu started
    at the sound, and whispered to the Kangaroo, &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be no
    drink to-night. Watch!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The cry of the Plover seemed to arrest the advance of the timid sheep. They
    waited in a closely-packed flock, looking around. But presently the old leader
    gave a deep bleat, and they moved forward towards the water. &ldquo;Shriek!
    Shriek!&rdquo; cried the Plover from the bushes, screaming as they rose and
    flew away; and suddenly the flock of sheep broke and hurried back to the
    open plain. At the same instant Dot could hear the sharp barking of a sheep-dog,
    a noise that produced an instant effect on the creatures she was with. With
    lightning speed the Kangaroo had popped her into her pouch and was hopping
    away, and the Emu was striding with its long legs as fast as it could for
    the cover of the Bush.</p>
  <p>Just as they entered the Bush shelter, Dot peeped out of the pouch, across
    the plain, and could see the mob of Emu in a cloud of dust, running, and
    almost out of sight.</p>
  <p>When they had reached a place of safety, the friendly Emu bid the Kangaroo
    and Dot good night. &ldquo;We shall have to be thirsty to-night,&rdquo; it
    said, &ldquo;but there will be a heavy dew, and the grass will be wet enough
    to cool one&rsquo;s mouth. That pretty trick of ours was such a success that
    it is almost worth one&rsquo;s while to lose one&rsquo;s drink in proving
    it.&rdquo; Turning to Dot it said, &ldquo;You will be able to tell the big
    Humans that we Emus are not such fools as they think, and that we find their
    flocks of silly sheep most useful and entertaining animals.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Chuckling to itself, the Emu strode off, leaving Dot and the Kangaroo to
    pass another night in the solitudes of the Bush.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter11"></a>Chapter 11<br>
    The Animals&rsquo; Court of Justice</b></h2>
  <p>The next day they travelled a long distance. At about noon they came to
    a part of the country which the Kangaroo said she well knew. &ldquo;But we
    must be careful,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;as we are very near Humans in this
    part.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As Dot was tired (for she had had to walk much more than usual) the Kangaroo
    suggested that she should rest at the pretty spot they had reached, whilst
    she herself went in search of Willy Wagtail. Dot had to promise the Kangaroo
    over and over again, not to leave the spot during her absence. She was afraid
    lest the little girl should get lost, like the little Joey.</p>
  <p>After many farewells, and much hopping back to give Dot warnings, and make
    promises of returning soon, the Kangaroo went in search of Willy Wagtail;
    and the little girl was left all alone.</p>
  <p>Dot looked for a nice shady nook, in which to lie down and rest; and she
    found the place so cheerful and pretty, that she was not afraid of being
    alone. She was in the hollow of an old watercourse. It was rather like an
    English forest glade, it was so open and grassy; and here and there were
    pretty shrubs, and little hillocks and hollows. At first Dot thought that
    she would sit on the branch of a huge tree that had but recently fallen,
    and lay forlornly clothed in withered leaves; but opposite to this dead giant
    of the Bush was a thick shrub with a decayed tree stump beside it, that made
    a nice sheltered corner which she liked better. So Dot laid herself down
    there, and in a few minutes she was fast asleep; though, as she dropped off
    into the land of dreams, she thought how wonderfully quiet that little glade
    was, and felt somewhat surprised to find no Bush creatures to keep her company.</p>
  <p>Some time before Dot woke, her dreams became confused and strange. There
    seemed to be great crowds of them, and the murmur of many voices talking
    together. As she gradually awakened, she realised that the voices were real,
    and not a part of her dreams. There was a great hubbub, a fluttering of wings,
    and rustling of leaves and grass. Through all this confusion, odd sentences
    became clear to her drowsy senses. Such phrases as, &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better
    perch here?&rdquo; &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t your place!&rdquo; &ldquo;Go over
    there!&rdquo; &ldquo;No! no! I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m right! the Welcome
    Swallow says so.&rdquo; &ldquo;Has anyone gone for the opossum?&rdquo; &ldquo;He
    says the Court ought to be held at night!&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make
    such a noise or you will wake the prisoner!&rdquo; &ldquo;Who is to be the
    judge?&rdquo; This last enquiry provoked such a noise of diverse opinions,
    that Dot became fully awake, and sitting up, gazed around with eyes full
    of astonishment.</p>
  <p>When she had fallen asleep there had not been a creature near her; but now
    she was literally hemmed in on every side by birds and small animals. The
    branches of the fallen tree were covered with a feathered company, and in
    the open space between it and Dot&rsquo;s nook, was a constantly increasing
    crowd of larger birds, such as cranes, plover, duck, turkey-buzzards, black
    swan, and amongst them a great grave Pelican. The animals were few, and apparently
    came late. There was a little timid Wallaby, a Bandicoot, some Kangaroo Rats,
    a shy Wombat who grumbled about the daylight, as also did a Native Bear and
    an Opossum, who were really driven to the gathering by a bevy of screaming
    parrots.</p>
  <p>Dot was wide awake at once with delight. Nearly every creature she had ever
    heard of seemed to be present, and the brilliant colours of the parrots and
    parrakeets made the scene as gay as a rainbow in a summer noonday sky.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! you darlings!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;how good of you all to
    come and see me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This greeting from Dot caused an instant silence amongst the creatures,
    and she could not help seeing that they looked very uncomfortable. There
    was soon a faint whispering from bird to bird, which rose higher and higher,
    until Dot made out that they were all saying, &ldquo;She ought to be told!&rdquo; &ldquo;You
    tell her!&rdquo; &ldquo;No, you tell her yourself, it&rsquo;s not my business!&rdquo; and
    every bird&mdash;for it was the birds who by reason of their larger numbers
    took the lead in the proceedings&mdash;seemed to be trying to shift an unpleasant
    task upon its neighbours.</p>
  <p>Presently the solemn Pelican waddled forward and stood before Dot, saying
    to the assemblage, &ldquo;I will explain our presence.&rdquo; Addressing
    the little girl it said, &ldquo;We are here to place you on trial for the
    wrongs we Bush creatures have suffered from the cruelties of White Humans.
    You will meet with all fairness in your trial, as the proceedings will be
    conducted according to the custom of your own Courts of justice. The Welcome
    Swallow, having built its nest for three successive seasons under the eaves
    of the Gabblegabble Court House, is deeply learned in human law business,
    and will instruct us how to proceed. Your conviction will, therefore, leave
    you no room for complaint so far as your trial is concerned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All the birds clapped their wings in applause at the conclusion of this
    speech, and the Pelican was told by the Welcome Swallow that he should plead
    as Prosecutor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean by &lsquo;Plead as Prosecutor?&rsquo;&ldquo; asked
    the Pelican gravely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to get the prisoner convicted as guilty, whether
    she is so or not,&rdquo; answered the Swallow, making a dart at a mosquito,
    which it ate with relish.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the Pelican, doubtfully; and all the creatures looked
    at one another as if they didn&rsquo;t quite understand the justice of the
    arrangement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the Pelican, hesitating a little, &ldquo;suppose
    I don&rsquo;t think the prisoner guilty? She seems very small, and harmless.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter at all, you&rsquo;ve got to get her made
    out as guilty by the jury. It&rsquo;s good human law,&rdquo; snapped the
    Swallow, and all the creatures said &ldquo;<i>Oh!</i>&rdquo; &ldquo;Now for
    the defence,&rdquo; said the Swallow briskly; &ldquo;there ought to be someone
    for that. Who is friendly with the Queen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the Queen?&rdquo; asked all the creatures breathlessly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a bigger Human than the rest, and everybody&rsquo;s business
    is her business, so she&rsquo;s always going to law.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said the Magpie, and she piped out six bars of &ldquo;God
    save the Queen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are the one for the defence!&rdquo; said the Swallow, quite delighted,
    as were all the other creatures, at the Magpie&rsquo;s accomplishment; &ldquo;you
    must save the prisoner from the jury finding her guilty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; objected the Magpie, &ldquo;how can I, when only last
    fruit season my brother, and two sisters, and six cousins were shot just
    because they ate a few grapes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter! you&rsquo;ve got to get her off, I tell
    you!&rdquo; said the Swallow, irritably. &ldquo;Go over there, and ask her
    what you are to say.&rdquo; So the Magpie flew over to Dot&rsquo;s side,
    and she at once began to teach it the rest of &ldquo;God save the Queen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I like this game,&rdquo; Dot presently said to the Magpie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; said the Magpie with surprise. &ldquo;It seems to
    me very slow, and there&rsquo;s no sense in it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why are the birds all perching together over there?&rdquo; asked
    Dot, pointing to a branch of the dead tree, &ldquo;since they all hate one
    another and want to get away. The Galahs have pecked the Butcher Bird twice
    in five minutes, the Peeweet keeps quarrelling with the Soldier Bird, and
    none of them can bear the English Sparrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><img src="0900681h-images/page065.jpg" width="591" height="750"></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;The Swallow says that&rsquo;s the jury,&rdquo; answered the Magpie. &ldquo;Their
    business is to do just what they like with you when all the talking is done,
    and whether they find you guilty or not, will depend on if they are tired,
    or hungry, and feel cross; or if the trial lasts only a short time, and they
    are pleased with the grubs that will be brought them presently.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How funny,&rdquo; said Dot, not a bit alarmed at all these preparations
    for her trial, for she loved all the creatures so much, that she could not
    think that any of them wished to hurt her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If this is human law,&rdquo; said the Magpie, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t
    funny at all; it is mad, or wicked. Fancy my having to defend a Human!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At this point of their conversation, the ill-feeling amongst the jury broke
    out into open fighting, because the English Sparrow was a foreigner, and
    they said that it would certainly sympathise with the Humans who had brought
    it to Australia. This was just an excuse to get rid of it. The Sparrow said
    that it wanted to go out of the jury, and had never wished to belong to it,
    and flew away joyfully. Then all the rest of the jury grumbled at the good
    luck of the Sparrow in getting out of the trial&mdash;for they could see
    it picking up grass seed and enjoying itself greatly, whilst they were all
    crowded together on one branch, and were feeling hungry before the trial
    had even begun.</p>
  <p>There was great suspense and quiet while the Judge was being chosen. Although
    Dot had eaten the berries of understanding, it was generally considered that,
    to be quite fair, the judge must be able to understand human talk; and, amidst
    much clapping of wings, a large white Cockatoo was appointed.</p>
  <p>The Cockatoo lost no time in clambering &ldquo;into position&rdquo; on the
    stump near Dot. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite sure you understand human talk?&rdquo; said
    the little Wallaby to the Cockatoo. It was the first remark he had made,
    for he had been quite bewildered by all the noise and fuss.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My word! yes,&rdquo; replied the Cockatoo, who had been taught in
    a public refreshment room. Then, thinking that he would give a display of
    his learning, he elevated his sulphur crest and gabbled off, &ldquo;Go to
    Jericho! Twenty to one on the favourite! I&rsquo;m your man! Now then, ma&rsquo;am;
    hurry up, don&rsquo;t keep the coach awaiting! Give &lsquo;um their &lsquo;eds,
    Bill! So long! Ta-ra-ra, boom-di-ay! God save the Queen!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All the creatures present looked gravely at Dot, to see what effect this
    harangue in her own language would have upon her, and were somewhat surprised
    to see her holding her little sides, and rolling about with laughter.</p>
  <p>The Cockatoo was quite annoyed at Dot&rsquo;s amusement. He fluffed out
    all his feathers, and let off a scream that could have been heard a quarter
    of a mile away. This seemed to impress every one with his importance, and
    the whole Court became attentive to the proceedings.</p>
  <p>At this moment the Swallow skimmed overhead, and having caught the words &ldquo;God
    save the Queen,&rdquo; called out, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to do it!
    keep that up&rdquo;  and the Cockatoo, thinking that the Swallow meant him
    to scream still more, set up another yell, which he continued until everyone
    felt deafened by the noise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We have chosen quite the right Judge,&rdquo; said an elegant blue
    crane to a wild duck; &ldquo;he will make himself heard and respected.&rdquo; Whereat
    the Cockatoo winked at the Crane, and said, &ldquo;You bet I will!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Pelican now advanced to the space before the stump, and there was a
    murmur of excitement, because it was about to open the trial by a recital
    of wrongs done to the Bush creatures by white humanity.</p>
  <p>Dot could not realise that she was being tried seriously, and was delighted
    that the Pelican had come nearer to her stump, so that she had a better view
    of him. She thought him such an old, old looking bird, with his big bald
    head, and gigantic beak. She could not help thinking that his beak must be
    too heavy for him, and asked if he would like to rest it on the stump. The
    Pelican did not understand Dot&rsquo;s kindness, and gave her a look of offended
    dignity that was quite withering; so Dot did not speak to him again; but
    she longed to feel if the bag of skin that drooped under his beak had anything
    in it. The Pelican&rsquo;s legs seemed to Dot to be too frail and short to
    bear such a big bird, not to mention the immense beak; and, when the creature
    stood on one leg only, she laughed; whereat the Pelican gave her another
    offended look, which effectually prevented their becoming friends.</p>
  <p>The Pelican was beginning to open his beak to speak (and, being such a large
    beak, opening it took some time), when the Welcome Swallow fussed into court,
    and said that &ldquo;nothing could be done until they had some horsehair!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This interruption, and the Swallow&rsquo;s repeated assurance that no human
    trial of importance could take place without horsehair, set all the creatures
    chattering with astonishment and questions. Some said the Swallow was joking;
    others said that it was making senseless delays, and that night would fall
    before they could bring the prisoner to justice. There was much grumbling
    on all sides, and complaints of hunger, and the jury began to clamour for
    the grubs that they had been promised, at which the Magpie whispered to Dot
    that she certainly would be found guilty. The fact was now quite clear to
    the jury before the trial began.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><img src="0900681h-images/page067.jpg" width="589" height="750"></h3>
  <p>But the Swallow persisted that they must have horsehair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; asked everyone, sulkily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see for yourselves,&rdquo; squeaked the Swallow,
    excitedly; &ldquo;the judge looks like a Cockatoo.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, of course he does,&rdquo; said all the creatures. &ldquo;He
    is a Cockatoo, so he looks like one!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried the Swallow, &ldquo;but you must stick horsehairs
    on his head. Human justice must be done with horsehair. The prisoner won&rsquo;t
    believe the Cockatoo is a judge without. Good Gracious!&rdquo; exclaimed
    the Swallow, &ldquo;just look! The prisoner is scratching the judge&rsquo;s
    poll! We really must have horsehair!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dot, seeing the Swallow&rsquo;s indignation, drew away from the stump, and
    the Cockatoo tried to look as if he had never seen her before, and as if
    the idea of having his poll scratched by the prisoner was one that could
    never have entered his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, if we do put horsehair on the Cockatoo&rsquo;s head,&rdquo; argued
    the creatures, &ldquo;what will it do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It will impress the prisoner,&rdquo; said the Swallow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; they all asked curiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because the Cockatoo won&rsquo;t look like a Cockatoo,&rdquo; replied
    the Swallow, with exasperation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then what will he look like?&rdquo; asked every creature in breathless
    excitement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t look like any creature that ever lived,&rdquo; retorted
    the Swallow.</p>
  <p>Perfect silence followed this explanation, for every bird and animal was
    trying to understand human sense and reason. Then the smallest Kangaroo Rat
    broke the stillness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If,&rdquo; said the Kangaroo Rat, &ldquo;only a little horsehair
    can do that, surely the prisoner can imagine the judge isn&rsquo;t a cockatoo,
    without our having to wait for the horsehair. Let&rsquo;s get on with the
    trial.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This idea was received with applause, and the Swallow flew off in a huff;
    whilst the Kookooburra, on a tree near the Court, softly laughed to himself.</p>
  <p>Once more the Pelican took up his position to open the trial. The Cockatoo
    puffed himself out as big as he could, fluffed out his cheek feathers, and
    half closed his eyes. His solemnly attentive attitude won the admiration
    of all the court, and the absence of horsehair was not felt by anyone. The
    Welcome Swallow, having got over its ill temper, returned to help the proceedings;
    and the jury all put their heads under their wings, and went to sleep.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fire away!&rdquo; screamed the Cockatoo, and the trial began.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My duty is a most painful one,&rdquo; said the Pelican; &ldquo;for&rdquo; (&ldquo;whereas,&rdquo;  said
    the Swallow) &ldquo;the prisoner known&rdquo; (&ldquo;named and described,&rdquo; added
    the Swallow), &ldquo;as Dot is now before you,&rdquo; (&ldquo;to be tried,
    heard, determined and adjudged,&rdquo; gabbled the Swallow) &ldquo;on a charge
    of cruelty&rdquo; (&ldquo;and feloniously killing and slaying,&rdquo; prompted
    the Swallow) &ldquo;to birds and animals,&rdquo; (&ldquo;the term not applying
    to horse, mare, gelding, bull, ox, dog, cat, heifer, steer, calf, mule, ass,
    sheep, lamb, hog, pig, sow, goat, or other domestic animal,&rdquo;  interposed
    in one breath the Swallow, quoting the Cruelty to Animals Act) &ldquo;she
    is&rdquo; (&ldquo;hereby,&rdquo; put in the Swallow) &ldquo;brought to trial
    on&rdquo; (&ldquo;divers,&rdquo; whispered the Swallow) &ldquo;charges&rdquo; (&ldquo;hereinafter,&rdquo; said
    the Swallow) &ldquo;to be named and described by the&rdquo; (&ldquo;aforesaid,&rdquo; interjected
    the Swallow) &ldquo;birds and animals,&rdquo; (&ldquo;hereinbefore mentioned,&rdquo; stated
    the Swallow) &ldquo;the said animals being denizens of the Bush&rdquo; (&ldquo;and
    in no wise relating to horse, mare, gelding, bull, ox&mdash;&rdquo; began
    the Swallow again, when the Cockatoo raised his crest, and screamed out &ldquo;STOP
    THAT, I TELL YOU!&rdquo; and the Pelican continued stating the charge.) &ldquo;Bush
    law&rdquo; (&ldquo;enacts,&rdquo; said the Swallow) &ldquo;that&rdquo; (&ldquo;whereas,&rdquo; prompted
    the Swallow) &ldquo;all individual rights&rdquo; (&ldquo;whatsoever,&rdquo;  put
    in the Swallow) &ldquo;shall be according to the statute Victoria&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Victoria! Twenty to one against the field,&rdquo; shouted the judge.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Between you two,&rdquo; said the Pelican, looking angrily at the
    Swallow and the Cockatoo, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve forgotten everything I was going
    to say! I shan&rsquo;t go on!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said the Swallow cheerfully, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
    said quite enough, and no one has understood a word of the charge, so it&rsquo;s
    all right. Now then for the witnesses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As the Swallow spoke, there was a great disturbance amongst the creatures.
    The swan, ducks, cranes, and water fowl, besides honeysuckers, and many other
    birds, were all fanning the air with their wings, and crying, &ldquo;Turn
    him out!&rdquo; &ldquo;Disgusting!&rdquo; &ldquo;I never heard of such a
    thing in my life! the smell of it always gives me a headache!&rdquo; and
    there was such a noise that the jury all woke up, and Dot covered her ears
    with her hands. The Cockatoo, seeing Dot&rsquo;s distress at the screams
    and hubbub, and thinking that she wanted to say something, but could not
    make herself heard in the general riot, decided to speak for her; so he screamed
    louder than all the rest, and shouted, &ldquo;Apples, oranges, pears, lemonade,
    cigarettes, <i>and</i> cigars! I say! what&rsquo;s the row?&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><img src="0900681h-images/page069.jpg" width="621" height="750"></h3>
  <p>When quiet was restored, it was explained that the Opossum had brought into
    Court a pouch full of gum leaves, which it was eating. It had also given
    some to the Native Bear, and Wallaby, and in consequence the whole air was
    laden with the odour of eucalyptus.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; said Dot, &ldquo;it smells just like when I have
    a cold!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eating eucalyptus leaves in Court is contempt of Court,&rdquo; cried
    the Swallow and everyone echoed, &ldquo;Contempt of Court! Contempt of Court!
    Turn them out!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But they are witnesses,&rdquo; objected the Pelican.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter!&rdquo; shouted the Waterfowl, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
    a disgusting smell! Turn them out!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; shouted the Wallaby, as it leaped off. &ldquo;What
    luck!&rdquo;  laughed the Opossum, as it cleared into the nearest tree. &ldquo;I
    am glad,&rdquo; sighed the Koala, as it slowly moved away; &ldquo;that trial
    made my head feel empty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, there go three of the most important witnesses,&rdquo; grumbled
    the Pelican.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My eye, what a spree!&rdquo; said the judge.</p>
  <p>A Galah amongst the jury, wishing to be thought intelligent, enquired what
    charge the Wallaby, Native Bear, and Opossum were to bear witness to.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is a matter of skins, included in the fur rugs clause, and the
    wickedness known as &lsquo;Sport&rsquo;,&rdquo; answered the Pelican.</p>
  <p>Whilst the Pelican was making this explanation, the judge, who had been
    longing to have his poll scratched again, sidled up to Dot, and whispered
    softly, &ldquo;Scratch Cockie&rsquo;s poll!&rdquo; But, just as he was enjoying
    the delicious sensation Dot&rsquo;s fingers produced amongst his neck feathers,
    as he held his head down, the Pelican caught sight of the proceeding. The
    Pelican said nothing, but stared at the judge with an eye of such astonishment
    and stern contempt, that the Cockatoo Instantly remembered that he was a
    judge, and, getting into a proper attitude, said hastily, &ldquo;Advance
    Australia! Who&rsquo;s the next witness?&rdquo; And again the Kookooburra
    laughed to himself on the tree.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fur first!&rdquo; exclaimed a white Ibis. &ldquo;Call the Platypus!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Platypus won&rsquo;t come!&rdquo; cried the Kangaroo Rat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I never!&rdquo; exclaimed the judge.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It says that if a Court is held at all, it should be conducted by
    the representative of Antediluvian custom, the most ancient and learned creatures,
    such as the Iguana, the Snake, and <i>Ornithorhynchus Paradoxus</i>. That
    it would prefer to associate with the meanest Troglodite, rather than appear
    amongst the present company. I understood it to say,&rdquo; continued the
    Kangaroo Rat, &ldquo;that real law could only be understood by those deeply
    learned in fossils.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Pon my word!&rdquo; ejaculated the judge. &ldquo;Shiver my
    timbers. What blooming impudence!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh you naughty bird to use such words!&rdquo; exclaimed Dot. But
    all the Court murmured &ldquo;How clever!&rdquo; and the Cockatoo was pleased.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Native Cat, next!&rdquo; shouted the white Ibis. But at the first
    mention of the Native Cat nearly every bird, and all the small game, prepared
    to get away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you call the Dingo at once?&rdquo; laughed the Kookooburra,
    who was really keeping guard over Dot, although she did not know it. &ldquo;Humans
    kill Dingoes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Dingo! The Dingo!&rdquo; every creature repeated in horror and
    consternation; and they all looked about in fear, while the Kookooburra chuckled
    to himself at all the stir his words had made.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite true that animals and birds kill one another,&rdquo; said
    the Magpie, who thought he ought to say something in Dot&rsquo;s defence,
    as that was his part in the trial, &ldquo;therefore it is the same nature
    that makes Humans kill us. If it is the nature of Humans to kill, the same
    as it is the nature of birds and animals to kill, where is the sense and
    justice of trying the prisoner for what she can&rsquo;t help doing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said the Welcome Swallow, &ldquo;argued like a lawyer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At this unexpected turn of the trial the Judge softly whistled to himself, &ldquo;Pop
    goes the weasel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to us about nature and justice and sense,&rdquo; replied
    the Pelican, contemptuously. &ldquo;This is a Court of law, we have nothing
    to do with any of them!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Court all cheered at this reply, and the Magpie subsided in the sulks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Call the Kangaroo!&rdquo; cried the white Ibis.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good,&rdquo; jeered the Kookooburra.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kangaroo and Dot are great friends. She won&rsquo;t come if you called&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Till all&rsquo;s blue!&rdquo; interrupted the judge and he went on
    with &ldquo;Pop goes the Weasel.&rdquo; This news caused a buzz of excitement.
    Everyone was astounded that the Kangaroo, who had the heaviest grievances
    of all, wouldn&rsquo;t appear against the prisoner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is it possible,&rdquo; said the Pelican, addressing the Kookooburra
    in slow stern accents, &ldquo;Is it possible that the Kangaroo has forgiven
    all her grievances?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All,&rdquo; said the Kookooburra.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The hunting?&rdquo; asked the Pelican.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the Kookooburra.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The rugs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The boots?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; said the Pelican, still more solemnly and slowly, while
    all the Court listened in breathless attention, &ldquo;and has she forgiven <i>Kangaroo-tail
    Soup?</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! she&rsquo;s forgiven that too,&rdquo; answered the Kookooburra
    cheerfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the Pelican, hotly, &ldquo;I throw up the case,&rdquo; and
    he spread his huge black wings, and flapped his way up into the sky and away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What a go!&rdquo; said the judge; and he might have said more, only
    Dot could not hear anything on account of the racket and confusion. The trial
    had failed, and every creature was making all the noise it could, and preparing
    to hurry away. In the middle of the turmoil, Dot&rsquo;s Kangaroo bounded
    into the open space, panting with excitement and delight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dot! Dot!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found Willy Wagtail,
    and he knows your way! Come along at once!&rdquo; And, putting Dot in her
    pouch, the Kangaroo leaped clean over the judge and carried her off!</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter12"></a>Chapter 12<br>
    Willy Wagtail to the Rescue</b></h2>
  <p>Although the Kangaroo was longing to hear the reason why so many Bush creatures
    had collected round Dot whilst she was away, she was too anxious to carry
    her to Willy Wagtail before nightfall to wait and enquire what had happened.
    Dot, too, was so excited at hearing that her way home had been found, that
    she could only think of the delight of seeing her father and mother again.
    So the Kangaroo had hopped until she was tired and needed rest, before they
    spoke. Then Dot described the Trial, and made the Kangaroo laugh about the
    Cockatoo judge, but she did not say how it had all ended because the Kangaroo
    had forgiven Dot for Humans making rugs of her fur, boots of her skin, and
    soup of her tail. She was afraid of hurting her feelings by mentioning such
    delicate subjects. The Kangaroo never noticed that anything was left out,
    because she was bursting to relate her interview with Willy Wagtail.</p>
  <p>She told Dot eagerly how she had found Willy Wagtail near his old haunt;
    how that gossiping little bird had told all the news of the Gabblegabble
    town and district in ten minutes, and how he had said he believed he knew
    Dot by sight, and that if such were the case he would show Dot and the Kangaroo
    the way to the little girl&rsquo;s home. Then Dot and the Kangaroo hurried
    on their way again, the little girl sometimes running and walking to rest
    the kind animal, and sometimes being carried in that soft cosy pouch that
    had been her cradle and carriage for all those days.</p>
  <p>It was quite dusk by the time they arrived at a split-rail fence, and heard
    a little bird singing, &ldquo;Sweet pretty creature! Sweet pretty creature!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is Willy Wagtail making love,&rdquo; said the Kangaroo, with
    a humorous twinkle in her quiet eyes. &ldquo;Peep round the bush,&rdquo; she
    said to Dot, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll see them spooning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dot glanced through the branches, and saw two wagtails, who looked very
    smart with their black coats and white waistcoats, sitting on two posts of
    a fence a little way off. They were each pretending that their long big tails
    were too heavy to balance them properly, and they seemed to be always just
    saving themselves from toppling off their perch. Occasionally Willy would
    dart into the air, to show what an expert flyer he was; he would shoot straight
    upwards, turn a double somersault backwards, and wing off in the direction
    one least expected. Afterwards he would return to his post as calm and cool
    as if he had done nothing surprising and say &ldquo;Pretty pretty Chip-pi-ti-chip!&rdquo; that
    name meaning the other wagtail. Then Chip-pi-ti-chip showed off <i>her</i> flying,
    and they both said to one another &ldquo;Sweet pretty creature!&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><img src="0900681h-images/page073.jpg" width="582" height="750"></h3>
  <p>At the sound of Dot and the Kangaroo&rsquo;s approach Chip-pi-ti-chip hid
    herself in a tree, and Willy Wagtail, not knowing who was disturbing them,
    scolded angrily; but when he saw the Kangaroo and the little girl, he gave
    them the most cordial greeting, and wobbled about on a rail as if he must
    tumble off every second.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is Dot,&rdquo; said the Kangaroo a little anxiously, and rather
    breathless with the speed she had made.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just as I had expected!&rdquo; exclaimed Willy Wagtail, with a jerk
    of the tail which nearly sent him headlong off the rail. &ldquo;I should
    know you anywhere, little Human, though you do look a bit different. You
    want preening,&rdquo;  he added.</p>
  <p>This last remark was in allusion to Dot&rsquo;s appearance, which certainly
    was most untidy and dirty, for, beyond an occasional lick from the Kangaroo,
    she had been five days without being tidied and cleaned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t do it better,&rdquo; said the Kangaroo apologetically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter at all,&rdquo; said Dot, putting her tangled
    curls back from her eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well! I know where you live,&rdquo; gabbled off the Wagtail. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
    the second big paddock from here, if you follow the belt of the she-oak trees
    over there. It&rsquo;s a house just like those things in Gabblebabble township.
    There&rsquo;s a yellow sheep dog, who&rsquo;s very good tempered, and a black
    one that made a snap at my tail the other day. There is an old grey cart
    horse, an honest fellow, but rather dull; and a bay mare who is much better
    company. There is a little red cow who is a great friend of mine, and she
    had a calf a few days before you were lost. Dear me!&rdquo; exclaimed the
    gossiping bird, &ldquo;what a fuss there has been these five days over trying
    to find you! I&rsquo;ve been over there every day to see the sight. Such
    a lot of Humans! And such horses. I enjoyed myself immensely, and made a
    lot of friends amongst the horses, but I didn&rsquo;t care so much for the
    dogs; I thought them a nasty quarrelsome lot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I went a couple of days with the whole turn out to see the search.
    Goodness, the distances they went, and the noise and the big fires they made.
    It <i>was</i> exciting fun! They brought over some black Humans&mdash;&rsquo;Trackers&rsquo; is
    what they are called, at least the Mounted Troopers&rsquo; horses told me
    so (my word the Troopers&rsquo; horses are jolly fellows!) Well, these black
    trackers went in front of each party just like dogs, with their heads to
    the ground, and they turned over every leaf and twig, and said if a Human,
    a horse or a Kangaroo had broken it or been that way, they would have found
    your track fast enough, but one evening it came to an end quite suddenly,
    and weren&rsquo;t they all surprised! I heard from a Trooper&rsquo;s horse&mdash;(such
    a nice horse he was!)&mdash;that the trackers and white Humans said it was
    just as if you had disappeared into the sky! There was just a bit of your
    fur on a bush, and nothing anywhere else but a Kangaroo&rsquo;s trail. No
    one could make it out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That was when I took you in my pouch!&rdquo; exclaimed the Kangaroo.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the Wagtail, &ldquo;most of them have given up the
    search. Just this evening Dot&rsquo;s father and a few other Humans came
    back, and the yellow sheep dog told me the last big party is to start at
    noon to-morrow, and after that there will be no more attempt to find Dot.
    Only the sheep dog said he heard his master say he would go on hunting alone,
    until he found her body. I haven&rsquo;t been over there to-day,&rdquo; wound
    up the bird, &ldquo;they are all so miserable and tired, it gave me the blues
    yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What are we to do? It is quite dark and late!&rdquo; asked the Kangaroo.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You had better stay here,&rdquo; counselled the Wagtail. &ldquo;One
    night more or less doesn&rsquo;t matter, and I don&rsquo;t like leaving Chip-pi-ti-chip
    at night-time. She likes me to sing to her all night, because she is nervous.
    I will go with you to-morrow morning early, if you will wait here until then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Having found your lost way so far!&rdquo; said the Kangaroo to Dot, &ldquo;it
    would be a pity to risk losing it again, so we had better wait for Willy
    Wagtail to guide us to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To tell the truth, the Kangaroo was very glad of the excuse to keep Dot
    one night more before parting from her. &ldquo;It will seem like losing my
    little Joey again, when I am once more alone,&rdquo; she said sadly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you will never go far away,&rdquo; said Dot. &ldquo;I should
    cry, if I thought you would never come to see me. You will live on our selection,
    won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the Kangaroo looked very doubtful, and said that she loved Dot, but
    she was afraid of Humans and their dogs.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><img src="0900681h-images/page075.jpg" width="593" height="750"></h3>
  <p>After a supper of berries and grass, Dot and the Kangaroo lay down for the
    night in a little bower of bushes. But they talked until very late, of how
    they were to manage to reach Dot&rsquo;s home without danger from guns and
    dogs. At last when they tried to sleep, they could not do so on account of
    Willy Wagtail&rsquo;s singing to his sweetheart, &ldquo;Sweet pretty creature!
    Sweet pretty creature!&rdquo; without stopping for more than five minutes
    at a time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wonder Chip-pi-ti-chip doesn&rsquo;t get tired of that song,&rdquo; said
    Dot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She never does,&rdquo; yawned the Kangaroo, &ldquo;and he never tires
    of singing it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sweet pretty creature,&rdquo; sang Willy Wagtail.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter13"></a>Chapter 13<br>
    Home at Last</b></h2>
  <p>Two men were walking near a cottage in the winter sun-light of the early
    morning. There came to the door a young woman, who looked pale and tired.
    She carried a bowl of milk to a little calf, and on her way back to the cottage
    she paused, and shading her eyes, that were red with weeping, lingered awhile,
    looking far and near. Then, with a sigh, she returned indoors and worked
    restlessly at her household duties.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It breaks my heart to see my wife do that,&rdquo; said the taller
    man, who carried a gun. &ldquo;All day long she comes out and looks for the
    child. One knows, now, that the poor little one can never come back to us,&rdquo; and
    as the big man spoke there was a queer choking in his voice.</p>
  <p>The younger man did not speak, but he patted his friend&rsquo;s shoulder
    in a kindly manner, which showed that he too was very sorry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even you have lost heart, Jack,&rdquo; said the big bushman, &ldquo;but
    we will find her yet; the wife shall have that comfort.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never do it now,&rdquo; said the young fellow with a
    mournful shake of the head. &ldquo;There is not an inch of ground that so
    young a child could reach that we have not searched. The mystery is, what
    could have become of her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what beats me,&rdquo; said the tall man, who was Dot&rsquo;s
    father. &ldquo;I think of it all day and all night. There is the track of
    the dear little mite as clear as possible for five miles, as far as the dry
    creek. The trackers say she rested her poor weary legs by sitting under the
    blackbutt tree. At that point she vanishes completely. The blacks say there
    isn&rsquo;t a trace of man, or beast, beyond that place excepting the trail
    of a big Kangaroo. As you say, it&rsquo;s a mystery!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As the men walked towards the bush, close to the place where Dot had run
    after the hare the day she was lost, neither of them noticed the fuss and
    scolding made by a Willy Wagtail; although the little bird seemed likely
    to die of excitement.</p>
  <p>Willy Wagtail was really saying, &ldquo;Dot and her Kangaroo are coming
    this way. Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t shoot them with that gun.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Presently the young man, Jack, noticed the little bird. &ldquo;What friendly
    little chaps those wagtails are,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and see how tame
    and fearless this one is. Upon my word, he nearly flew in your face that
    time!&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><img src="0900681h-images/page077.jpg" width="613" height="750"></h3>
  <p>Dot&rsquo;s father did not notice the remark, for he had stopped suddenly,
    and was peering into the bush whilst he quietly shifted his gun into position,
    ready to raise it and fire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I saw the head of a Kangaroo a moment
    ago behind that iron-bark. Fancy it&rsquo;s coming so near the house. Next
    time it shows, I&rsquo;ll get a shot at it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Both men waited for the moment when the Kangaroo should be seen again.</p>
  <p>The next instant the Kangaroo bounded out of the Bush into the open paddock.
    Swift as lightning up went the cruel gun, but, as it exploded with a terrible
    report, the man, Jack, struck it upwards, and the fatal bullet lodged in
    the branch of a tall gum tree.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Great Scott!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack, pointing at the Kangaroo.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dot!&rdquo; cried her father, dropping his gun, and stumbling blindly
    forward with outstretched arms, towards his little girl, who had just tumbled
    out of the Kangaroo&rsquo;s pouch in her hurry to reach her father.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hoo! hoo! ho! ho! he! he! ha! ha! ha! ha!&rdquo; laughed a Kookooburra
    on a tree, as he saw Dot clasped in her father&rsquo;s great strong arms,
    and the little face hidden in his big brown beard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wife! wife!&rdquo; shouted Dot&rsquo;s father, &ldquo;Dot&rsquo;s
    come back! Dot&rsquo;s come back!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dot&rsquo;s here!&rdquo; yelled the young man, as he ran like mad
    to the house. And all the time the good Kangaroo sat up on her haunches,
    still panting with fear from the sound of the gun, and a little afraid to
    stay, yet so interested in all the excitement and delight, that she couldn&rsquo;t
    make up her mind to hop away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dadda,&rdquo; said Dot, &ldquo;You nearly killed Dot and her Kangaroo!
    Oh if you killed my Kangaroo, I&rsquo;d never have been happy any more!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said her father. &ldquo;How
    did you come to be in the Kangaroo&rsquo;s pouch?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;ve got lots and lots to tell you!&rdquo; said Dot; &ldquo;but
    come and stroke dear Kangaroo, who saved little Dot and brought her home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That I will!&rdquo; said Dot&rsquo;s father, &ldquo;and never more
    will I hurt a Kangaroo!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor any of the Bush creatures,&rdquo; said Dot. &ldquo;Promise, Dadda!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; said the big man, in a queer-sounding voice, as
    he kissed Dot over and over again, and walked towards the frightened animal.</p>
  <p>Dot wriggled down from her father&rsquo;s arms, and said to the Kangaroo, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
    all right; no one&rsquo;s ever going to be shot or hurt here again!&rdquo;  and
    the Kangaroo looked delighted at the good news.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dadda,&rdquo; said Dot, holding her father&rsquo;s hand, and, with
    her disengaged hand touching the Kangaroo&rsquo;s little paw. &ldquo;This
    is my own dear Kangaroo.&rdquo; Dot&rsquo;s father, not knowing quite how
    to show his gratitude, stroked the Kangaroo&rsquo;s head, and said, &ldquo;How
    do you do?&rdquo; which, when he came to think of it afterwards, seemed rather
    a foolish thing to say. But he wasn&rsquo;t used, like Dot, to talking to
    Bush creatures, and had not eaten the berries of understanding.</p>
  <p>The Kangaroo saw that Dot&rsquo;s father was grateful, and so she was pleased,
    but she did not like to be stroked by a man who let off guns, so she was
    glad that Dot&rsquo;s mother had run to where they were standing, and was
    hugging and kissing the little girl, and crying all the time; for then Dot&rsquo;s
    father turned and watched his wife and child, and kept doing something to
    his eyes with a handkerchief, so that there was no attention to spare for
    Kangaroos.</p>
  <p>The good Kangaroo, seeing how happy these people were, and knowing that
    her life was quite safe, wanted to peep about Dot&rsquo;s home and see what
    it was like&mdash;for Kangaroos can&rsquo;t help being curious. So presently
    she quietly hopped off towards the cottage, and then a very strange thing
    happened. Just as the Kangaroo was wondering what the great iron tank by
    the kitchen door was meant for, there popped out of the open door a joey
    Kangaroo. Now, to human beings, all joey Kangaroos look alike, but amongst
    Kangaroos there are no two the same, and Dot&rsquo;s Kangaroo at once recognised
    in the little Joey her own baby Kangaroo. The Joey knew its mother directly,
    and, whilst Dot&rsquo;s Kangaroo was too astonished to move, and not being
    able to think, was trying to get at a conclusion why her Joey was coming
    out of a cottage door, the little Kangaroo, with a hop-skip-and-a-jump, had
    landed itself comfortably in the nice pouch Dot had just vacated.</p>
  <p>Then Dot&rsquo;s mother, rejoicing over the safe return of her little girl,
    was not more happy than the Kangaroo with her Joey once more in her pouch.
    With big bounds she leapt towards Dot, and the little girl, suddenly looking
    round for her Kangaroo friend, clapped her hands with delight as she saw
    a little grey nose, a pair of tiny black paws, and the point of a black little
    tail, hanging out of the pouch that had carried her so often.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; exclaimed Dot&rsquo;s mother, &ldquo;if she hasn&rsquo;t
    got the little Joey Jack brought me yesterday! He picked it up after a Kangaroo
    hunt some time ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s her Joey; her lost Joey!&rdquo; cried Dot, running to
    the Kangaroo. &ldquo;Oh, dear Kangaroo, I am so glad!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for
    now we are all happy; as happy as can be!&rdquo; Dot hugged her Kangaroo,
    and kissed the little Joey, and they all three talked together, so that none
    of them understood what the others were saying, only that they were all much
    pleased and delighted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wife&rdquo; said Dot&rsquo;s father, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what&rsquo;s
    mighty queer, our little girl is talking away to those animals, and they&rsquo;re
    all understanding one another, as if it was the most natural thing in the
    world to treat Kangaroos as if they were human beings!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I expect,&rdquo; said his wife, &ldquo;that their feelings are not
    much different from ours. See how that poor animal is rejoicing in getting
    back its little one, just as we are over having our little Dot again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To think of all the poor things I have killed,&rdquo; said Dot&rsquo;s
    father sadly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never do it again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said his wife, &ldquo;we must try and get everyone to
    be kind to the bush creatures, and protect them all we can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This book would never come to an end if it told all that passed that day.
    How Dot explained the wonderful power of the berries of understanding, and
    how she told the Kangaroos all that her parents wanted her to say on their
    behalf, and what kind things the Kangaroo said in return.</p>
  <p>All day long the Kangaroo stayed near Dot&rsquo;s home, and the little girl
    persuaded her to eat bread, which she said was &ldquo;most delicious, but
    one would get tired of it sooner than grass.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Every effort was made by Dot and her parents to get the Kangaroo to live
    on their selection, so that they might protect her from harm. But she said
    that she liked her own free life best, only she would never go far away and
    would come often to see Dot. At sunset she said good-bye to Dot, a little
    sadly, and the child stood in the rosy light of the after-glow, waving her
    hand, as she saw her kind animal friend hop away and disappear into the dark
    shadow of the Bush.</p>
  <p>She wandered about for some time listening to the voices of birds and creatures,
    who came to tell her how glad everyone was that her way had been found, and
    that no harm was to befall them in future. The news of her safe return, and
    of the Kangaroo&rsquo;s finding her Joey, had been spread far and near, by
    Willy Wagtail and the Kookooburra; and she could hear the shouts of laughter
    from kookooburras telling the story until nearly dark.</p>
  <p>Quite late at night she was visited by the Opossum, the Native Bear, and
    the Nightjar, who entered by the open window, and, sitting in the moonlight,
    conversed about the day&rsquo;s events. They said that their whole rest and
    sleep had been disturbed by the noise and excitement of the day creatures
    spreading the news through the Bush. The Mo-poke wished to sing a sad song
    because Dot was feeling happy, but the Opossum warned it that it was sitting
    in a draught on the window sill and might spoil its beautiful voice, so it
    flew away and only sang in the distance. The Native Bear said that the story
    of Dot&rsquo;s return and the finding of Kangaroo&rsquo;s Joey was so strange
    that it made its head feel quite empty. The Opossum inspected everything
    in Dot&rsquo;s room, and tried to fight itself in the looking glass. It then
    got the Koala to look into the mirror also, and said it would get an idea
    into its little empty head if it did. When the Koala had taken a timid peep
    at itself, the Opossum said that the Koala now had an idea of how stupid
    it looked, and the little bear went off to get used to having an idea in
    its head. The Opossum was so pleased with its spiteful joke that it hastily
    said good night, and hurried away to tell it to the other possums.</p>
  <p>Gradually the voices of the creatures outside became more and more faint
    and indistinct; and then Dot slept in the grey light of the dawn.</p>
  <p>When she went out in the morning, the kookooburras were gurgling and laughing,
    the magpies were warbling, the parrakeets made their twittering, and Willy
    Wagtail was most lively; but Dot was astonished to find that she could not
    understand what any of the creatures said, although they were all very friendly
    towards her. When the Kangaroo came to see her she made signs that she wanted
    some berries of understanding, but, strange as it may seem, the Kangaroo
    pretended not to understand. Dot has often wondered why the Kangaroo would
    not understand, but, remembering what that considerate animal had said when
    she first gave her the berries, she is inclined to think that the Kangaroo
    is afraid of her learning too much, and thereby getting indigestion. Dot
    and her parents have often sought for the berries, but up to now they have
    failed to find them. There is something very mysterious about those berries!</p>
  <p>During that day every creature Dot had known in the Bush came to see her,
    for they all knew that their lives were safe now, so they were not afraid.
    It greatly surprised Dot&rsquo;s parents to see such numbers of birds and
    animals coming around their little girl, and they thought it very pretty
    when in the evening a flock of Native Companions settled down, and danced
    their graceful dance with the little girl joining in the game.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It seems to me, wife,&rdquo; said Dot&rsquo;s father with a glad
    laugh, &ldquo;that the place has become a regular menagerie!&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><img src="0900681h-images/page081.jpg" width="591" height="750"></h3>
  <p>Later on, Dot&rsquo;s father made a dam to a hollow piece of ground near
    the house, which soon became full of water, and is surrounded by beautiful
    willow trees. There all the thirsty creatures come to drink in safety. And
    very pretty it is, to sit on the verandah of that happy home, and see Dot
    playing near the water surrounded by her Bush friends, who come and go as
    they please, and play with the little girl beside the pretty lake. And no
    one in all the Gabblebabble district hurts a bush creature, because they
    are all called &ldquo;Dot&rsquo;s friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2><b><a name="Finale"></a>Finale</b></h2>
  <p>Before putting away the pen and closing the inkstand, now that Dot has said
    all she wishes to be recorded of her bewildering adventures, the writer would
    like to warn little people, that the best thing to do when one is lost in
    the bush, is to sit still in one place, and not to try to find one&rsquo;s
    way home at all. If Dot had done this, and had not gone off in the Kangaroo&rsquo;s
    pouch, she would have been found almost directly. As the more one tries to
    find one&rsquo;s way home, the more one gets lost, and as helpful Kangaroos
    like Dot&rsquo;s are very scarce, the best way to get found quickly, is to
    wait in one place until the search parties find one. Don&rsquo;t forget this
    advice! And don&rsquo;t eat any strange berries in the bush, unless a Kangaroo
    brings them to you.</p>
