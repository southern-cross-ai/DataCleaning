  <h2><a name="chap1"
     id="chap1">CHAPTER ONE. &mdash; CHARLES GATHERGOOD</a></h2>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;Curious, the way things do jump out of nothing. This
  affair seems to have been begun by a hat blowing off.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>To Gathergood, as he said this, sitting on his bungalow verandah at Cuava
  with the temperature over a hundred in the shade and his whole body
  perspiring with the slightest movement, there came the sudden realisation of
  unpopularity. He had been conscious of it, at times, before; but never quite
  so definitely. He wondered if the planters had been telling tales against
  him, but he did not trouble himself much with the possibility; it was far too
  hot&mdash;­an hour for anything rather than unpleasant speculation. He added,
  stiffening his glance as he met the eyes of the man across the table-top:
  &ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s bad enough, in the result, but I&rsquo;m not so
  sure that as much underlies it as you think.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mentioned something about a hat blowing off?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Morrison&rsquo;s hat. He was walking down from the club after
  tiffin, and just there&rdquo;&mdash;­he pointed with a jerk of the
  head&mdash;­&ldquo;where the path curves round the cliff his hat blew into
  the sea. He called to a native down below on the quayside to get it for
  him&mdash;­a young Cuavanese named Naung Lo&mdash;­but the fellow
  didn&rsquo;t hear him, apparently. Morrison then scrambled down the cliff
  himself and made a scene. That&rsquo;s as far as we can get before the
  evidence begins to be conflicting.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A planter named Franklyn was with Morrison, I
  understand?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. Of course it&rsquo;s on Franklyn&rsquo;s evidence that Naung
  Lo was arrested. He says Naung Lo pushed Morrison into the sea.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, is there any doubt of it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Naung Lo says he didn&rsquo;t push him. He says he didn&rsquo;t
  hear what Morrison had shouted, that Morrison then came down and hit him,
  that there was a bit of a struggle on the edge of the quay, and that Morrison
  suddenly toppled over. He also says that Morrison was drunk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I take it you accept this version of what happened in
  preference to Franklyn&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, not altogether. I daresay Naung Lo may have pushed&mdash;­I
  don&rsquo;t see how, if there was a struggle, he could have avoided
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Franklyn says Naung Lo hit first.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Gathergood was silent a moment. Then he replied, rather slowly:
  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too hot to take you to the scene of the affair or
  you&rsquo;d realise that Franklyn, being thirty yards away at least, may not
  have been in the best position for seeing exactly what did happen. Naturally
  he was indignant about the death of his friend.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You wish me to infer that his evidence is false?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By no means, Humphreys,&rdquo; answered Gathergood sharply.
  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suggest anything of the kind. But Franklyn admits that
  he stayed on the path up above, while Morrison climbed down to the edge of
  the quay where the whole thing took place.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But he doesn&rsquo;t admit that Morrison was drunk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. Drunkenness is perhaps a matter of opinion. I can only say that
  I should have called him drunk when he left the club&mdash;­I was there and I
  saw him. But that, of course, was half an hour earlier. Some men quickly
  throw off the effects.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A long silence followed, which Gathergood broke by adding: &ldquo;I think
  I should point out also that Naung Lo is slight in build, while Morrison was
  a six-footer. It seems unlikely, on the face of it, that the smaller man
  would begin the attack, without weapons&mdash;­ and no weapons were found on
  or near him afterwards.... And, of course, Morrison&rsquo;s death was in some
  sense an accident, anyhow&mdash;­he certainly wouldn&rsquo;t have drowned if
  his head hadn&rsquo;t struck a stone that stunned him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Franklyn went to the rescue, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. And Naung Lo stood by and gave what help he could. A point in
  his favour, I should be inclined to think.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, now we&rsquo;ve had all the points in his
  favour&mdash;­unless there are some more&mdash;­perhaps we can consider those
  against him. He&rsquo;s been in prison, they tell me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, several times&mdash;­for theft. I don&rsquo;t claim that
  he&rsquo;s a highly moral character in any way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And he was once in the employ of Morrison, but got the
  sack?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Morrison had to sack a good many natives. So have all the
  planters round here, with rubber down to fourpence a pound. The biggest item
  of evidence against the youth&mdash;­I&rsquo;ll tell you to save you the
  trouble of finding it out for yourself&mdash;­is that he&rsquo;s undoubtedly
  been heard to utter threats against Morrison. Morrison thrashed him once, and
  he swore to get even with him. He probably deserved the
  thrashing&mdash;­though, on the other hand, Morrison was rather noted for
  that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, it establishes a motive, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The two men, Gathergood the Agent and Humphreys the Vice-Consul from the
  mainland, faced each other again in a lengthy silence. Then Humphreys said:
  &ldquo;Of course, Gathergood, people are rather expecting you to do something
  about it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Agent replied quietly, scarcely moving a muscle in the almost
  intolerable noonday heat: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing what I can, Humphreys.
  I&rsquo;m trying to find out if there were other witnesses of the
  affair.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Still, you know, witnesses or not, the awkward fact remains that
  here you have an Englishman dead and a native somehow or other responsible.
  These things have a way of leading to trouble if they&rsquo;re not smartly
  dealt with. What&rsquo;s the present position?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Naung Lo&rsquo;s in jail awaiting trial, or perhaps I should rather
  say, awaiting sentence. Cuavanese law is primitive, but quite brisk on these
  occasions. As soon as the Sultan decides that he&rsquo;s guilty, he gets his
  head chopped off right away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Humphreys raised his eyebrows with a certain blandness. &ldquo;And may I
  enquire if you have seen fit to offer His Highness any advice in the
  matter?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Gathergood answered, still without movement: &ldquo;The Sultan asked me if
  I thought the youth should be put to death and I said not yet, at any rate,
  because it seemed to me there were doubts.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose you know your own business best&mdash;­or should
  do. But in these days, with all these political crimes everywhere&mdash;­
  India, Burma&mdash;­&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, quite, but I don&rsquo;t think this has anything to do with
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re by nature an optimist, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Gathergood half-smiled. &ldquo;No, I wouldn&rsquo;t say that. I
  wouldn&rsquo;t call myself a pessimist, either. I just think one ought to
  preserve one&rsquo;s sense of proportion, that&rsquo;s all....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Humphreys stayed on for a few days and then took the coastal boat back to
  the mainland.</p>

  <p>Gathergood was forty-nine, and had spent a quarter of a century in various
  parts of the East. He had never married, nor had rumour ever associated him
  with a woman, white or coloured. He was aware that women did not particularly
  care for him, and he had never found their indifference hard to endure. With
  men, individual men, he had sometimes wished he could become more intimate,
  but even the wish for this had rarely been enough to make for keen
  disappointment. He knew, as indeed it was impossible not to know, that his
  intrusion into Cuavanese society had scarcely been a social success. He was
  neither gallant enough for the planters&rsquo; wives nor sufficiently
  alcoholic to be considered a good fellow by the planters themselves; whilst
  among the natives a reputation for fair dealing was outweighed by an
  unwillingness to give a dollar tip when half a dollar was ample. Moreover,
  all these negations were much emphasised by his having come to Cuava in 1927,
  after Bullenger, whose reputation for hard drinking and hard wenching had
  fitted easily into the spacious prosperity of the rubber boom, so that those
  golden years were still remembered in some such phrase as: &ldquo;Ah, that
  was in poor old Bullenger&rsquo;s time.&rdquo; A tribute, wistfully
  inaccurate, since the man had been neither poor nor old, but had died wealthy
  and prematurely of cirrhosis of the liver; and a censure, by implication, on
  the stiff, more difficult fellow whose succeeding regime had coincided with
  Cuava&rsquo;s decline from affluence to penury.</p>

  <p>In appearance Gathergood was tall, spare, and nearly as brown-
  complexioned as some of the Malays; he had fine teeth and a strong chin, but
  was not otherwise good-looking; his chill blue eyes repelled more often than
  they attracted. In speech he was decisive, but rather slow; indeed, his eyes
  more often commanded than his voice.</p>

  <p>After the departure of Humphreys he went on with his job, which was not
  normally very onerous, and was decidedly not among the plums of the service;
  apart from acting as go-between for British merchants doing trade with Cuava,
  giving occasional advice to the Sultan, and attending to such matters as
  quarantine and the immigration of British Chinese from Hong-Kong, there was
  not a great deal to do. His bungalow, which included an office, stood on a
  spit of land just above the water-front, and was chiefly built of reed and
  thatch after the local fashion. A few of the planters had been able to afford
  Europeanised bungalows out of the profits of the boom years, but on the whole
  Cuava was still primitive in these matters&mdash;­owing chiefly, no doubt, to
  the fact that it remained a native state, under a Sultan who enjoyed a more
  than technical independence of the authorities at Singapore and Batavia,
  though faintly compelling eyes were often cast upon him from those
  quarters.</p>

  <p>Cuava, capital of the island and state of the same name, was the only
  white settlement, and its white population, due to the slump in rubber, was
  rather rapidly decreasing. Perhaps forty or fifty survivors of a once
  prosperous community lived on the two hills that lay behind and above the
  native kampong; a few of them had their wives, but most were considerate
  enough to make do with the resources of the locality. There was a Welsh
  doctor who shared his activities between Cuava and another island a
  day&rsquo;s journey distant; and there had once been an American missionary
  who had been converted from missionary work by the superior opportunities of
  buying up rubber estates. Occasionally a European sea-captain came ashore and
  spent a few days drinking and yarning at the club. This latter institution,
  inevitable where two or three Englishmen are gathered together, was the
  centre of Cuavanese society, the fount of its corporate wisdom, the source of
  its rumours, and the sounding- board of its various opinions. It stood on the
  hill nearest the estuary, adjacent also to the plantations, and surrounded by
  billowy land which enthusiastic new-comers always dreamed of turning into a
  golf-course until they had their first experience of the sweltering Cuavanese
  summer.</p>

  <p>Down in the native kampong on the water-front there was reckoned to be a
  mixed population of some ten thousand Malays, Chinese, and Sikhs. Many of
  them had been attracted from overseas when work and pay on the plantations
  were both plentiful; now, with these conditions at an end, an existence not
  far above the starvation line was somehow contrived. They lived in ramshackle
  huts on the edge of the river-mud, and except when they caught cholera or
  smuggled gin authority was glad enough to leave them alone.</p>

  <p>Authority, indeed, resided five miles inland, well removed from the
  commercial and maritime atmosphere. There, enclosed by primeval jungle, was
  situated the Sultan&rsquo;s palace, with its private apartments, its imperial
  harem, and its government offices, council chamber, prison, and military
  arsenal; a mysterious and legendary place to the white planter who rarely or
  never visited it.</p>

  <p>Gathergood had acted for four years as a species of liaison officer in
  this complicated and peculiarly balanced society, and that he had not
  achieved the personal popularity of his predecessor did not by any means
  signify his failure at the job. On the contrary, he had comfortably
  surmounted all the various minor difficulties that had arisen from time to
  time; his relations with the Sultan were good, and his periodic reports to
  Singapore models of humdrum neatness. His job was not the kind that all men
  would have envied, but he himself had no particular complaint to make of it.
  The Sultan&rsquo;s government was strong and fairly free from corruption; his
  own health was excellent; he was used to loneliness; and, perhaps most
  fortunately of all, he had no investments in the local estates and his salary
  did not depend on the price of rubber. Yet, during the days that followed the
  departure of Humphreys, he was aware of a changed note, a feeling of tension
  in the air, not lessened, he guessed, by talks which Humphreys had had with
  the leading planters during his visit. As he dictated business letters to his
  one Eurasian clerk he did not fail to observe the look of feverish enquiry in
  the violet-brown eyes that stared above the typewriter-roller. Recent events
  had provided sensation for bungalow and kampong alike; already the dead
  Englishman was beginning to acquire among the planters the legendary
  habiliments of martyrdom. And among the natives, too, there were hints,
  rather than evidences, of trouble; wage reductions on the estates had
  prepared a soil well suited to the flowering of unrest. All this Gathergood
  sensed with an involuntary stirring of distaste; he lacked sympathy with the
  jingo impulsiveness of the planters nearly as much as with the Bolshevist
  nonsense that was beginning to permeate the mob.</p>

  <p>With relief, when he had discharged his daily routine of duties, he turned
  as a rule to his botanical specimens, of which during his years in Cuava he
  had made a large and varied collection. It was probably, he sometimes
  thought, the most complete of its kind in the world, since the island seemed
  to have been just as unaccountably neglected by naturalists as by explorers.
  That range of mountains, for instance, barely visible on a very clear day
  from the rubber estates&mdash;­curious, he thought, that none of the planters
  ever desired to climb or investigate them. Gathergood had done so several
  times, struggling through difficult miles of mangrove swamp and jungle.
  &ldquo;Was it worth while?&rdquo; he was once asked on his return. &ldquo;Did
  you strike any gold reefs, buried treasure, tin deposits?&rdquo; He had
  answered, with a simplicity so odd that it was misread as a pose:
  &ldquo;Hardly that, but I did find two quite remarkable things on the
  summit&mdash;­a small lake that always had ice on it in the early mornings,
  and little blue forget-me-nots, growing just as they do in England.&rdquo;
  Which was a type of remark that proceeded rather eccentrically from the mouth
  of a British Agent in a club-room of rubber-growers.</p>

  <p>One morning, while his enquiries into details of the Morrison case were
  still pending, one of the younger planters, not long out from home, called on
  him and remarked with candid indiscretion that the planters were not at all
  satisfied with the way matters were developing. &ldquo;And neither was that
  fellow Humphreys,&rdquo; continued the youth, even more indiscreetly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And neither am I,&rdquo; added Gathergood.</p>

  <p>The youth went on: &ldquo;Not of course that Morrison was a saint, by any
  means, but, still, the poor beggar&rsquo;s dead, and we&rsquo;ll have the
  whole pack on top of us if we let &rsquo;em get away with a thing like that.
  It&rsquo;s the example to the rest that&rsquo;s so damned
  dangerous.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope not, if we all keep our heads.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t help things much, with the tappers already talking
  revolution. Perhaps you heard of the strike of coolies this
  morning?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Some small trouble over a shipment. It&rsquo;s settled now.
  There&rsquo;s trouble all over the world, for that matter. We mustn&rsquo;t
  get excited.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You keep on saying that, sir, while all the time things are heading
  for a crisis.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Gathergood smiled, more charmed than displeased by the frankness of the
  outburst. He guessed a little of the resentment smouldering behind the
  youth&rsquo;s words, that dream of being lordly and prosperous that had
  wilted during a few months&rsquo; experience of dragooning natives on a
  nearly bankrupt plantation. Gathergood felt sorry for him. He touched his
  arm&mdash;­a rare thing for him to do to anyone&mdash;­and answered:
  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. When I next see the Sultan I&rsquo;ll indicate to
  him, if I can, the desirability of keeping his kampong hotheads under
  control. He doesn&rsquo;t want trouble, remember, any more than we
  do.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll get it, though, if he&rsquo;s not mighty careful, sir.
  It&rsquo;s pretty obvious he&rsquo;s shielding Morrison&rsquo;s murderer. It
  can&rsquo;t go on. Everyone knows these native states are
  ana&mdash;­ana&rdquo;&mdash;­he stumbled over the half-known word and added,
  more confidently&mdash;­&ldquo;out-of-date.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was a certain pathos, to the Agent, in the triteness of all that. It
  was rather like saying &ldquo;I do think flowers are lovely&rdquo; at a
  horticultural show. On the club verandah it was the everlasting small change
  of minor grousing; while in Singapore civil servants had grown grey in
  turning it into Blue Book prose. Gathergood did not conceive it his duty
  either to have or to express an opinion on the subject. Cuava was Cuava; he
  was content to accommodate himself to the system as it existed. He took
  little interest in politics, and had no passionate conviction that direct
  control from Singapore would be an improvement. He said, comfortingly:
  &ldquo;All the same, I shouldn&rsquo;t worry, if I were you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But the youth&rsquo;s remarks had made him feel that he might, perhaps,
  expedite his visit to the Sultan. He went that evening.</p>

  <p>Gathergood had no car; the lack of roads in Cuava made one an unnecessary
  expense. There was, it is true, a track of sorts leading steeply up to the
  Sultan&rsquo;s palace, but the Agent preferred the more tranquil if slower
  method of having his native boys paddle him upstream to a point from which
  the palace lay but half an hour&rsquo;s walk uphill. He had travelled thus on
  many occasions, and had perfected a pleasurable technique in sparing his boys
  as much expenditure of energy as possible. He first let the canoe drift
  across the estuary with the incoming tide; then he steered his way amongst
  the slow channels of the mangrove swamps, thus escaping the force of the
  current in midstream. It was possible, except at the height of the dry
  season, to traverse almost the entire distance in this manner; the journey
  took time, but there was rarely any particular reason for hurry. Nor did
  Gathergood find the scenery tedious as others might have done; the swamps
  were certainly desolate, but he could find plenty of interest in them, the
  more so as their tangles of rotting foliage had often yielded important
  additions to his naturalist&rsquo;s collection. He liked the play of light,
  especially towards sunset, on the pale, sword-like nippa leaves; and the
  swish of the wind through them amused him sometimes by its likeness to human
  whispering.</p>

  <p>That night he arrived at the Sultan&rsquo;s private landing-place amid the
  warm scents of twilight. He climbed the wooden stairs, crossed the jetties of
  split palm-trunks, and took the ascending path to the palace. When at last he
  reached it, the widespread litter of buildings, with lights here and there,
  was shrouded in mystery, but it did not affect him; he knew it well enough,
  and after a few words to a turbanned sentry was admitted through familiar
  entrances into familiar rooms. Most of them were of the same type, though
  larger than the ordinary Cuavanese but; and only the throne-room, into which
  he was finally ushered, presented any original features. It was a lofty
  wooden apartment, lit with oil-lamps and hung with mats and strips of red
  cotton sheeting; it also exhibited, apparently as an objet d&rsquo;art, a
  three-year-old business calendar advertising a San Francisco insurance
  company.</p>

  <p>Gathergood, thin and ghost-like in his white ducks, waited for several
  moments without impatience. He was a man who did not object to waiting, and
  to whom the mere saving of seconds seemed of little value without some
  definite use for the time saved. It was this attitude of mind which, though
  he had never thought out the question, gave him ease in dealing with
  Orientals and made him often appear stiff and dilatory before the
  quick-dealing Westerner.</p>

  <p>At length a door opened and Gathergood made a profound bow. An old, an
  almost incredibly old man was tottering forward. His body, which had once
  been very tall, now stooped to a mere five feet above the ground; his head,
  wrinkled and shaven, was partly covered by a turban of green silk; while the
  rest of his attire revealed itself, to all outward conjecture, as the
  badly-fitting uniform of a liner-steward.</p>

  <p>Yet, with every inelegance and incongruity, there was a quality in the old
  man that made Gathergood&rsquo;s bow a fitting gesture. Pathetic dignity
  reposed in the slowly raised head and in the grim, toothless smile; the nose
  and lips, strong and sensual at one time, had been thinned by age to a
  sharpness which, with the small, gleaming eyes, reminded Gathergood of
  newspaper pictures of Philip Snowden.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the Sultan of Cuava held out his hand with a brave imitation of
  the western salutation. Gathergood offered his own hand, and the old man held
  it limply for a moment. &ldquo;Your Highness is well?&rdquo; queried
  Gathergood, and a cracked, scarcely audible voice replied: &ldquo;Very well,
  Tuan.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But it was rather obvious that he was not. He was wheezy, asthmatic, and
  unsteady on his legs; only with assistance from Gathergood and two personal
  attendants did he finally seat himself on the royal throne, which was a
  shabby wooden affair, decorated with strips of coloured cloth. He was,
  indeed, immensely old&mdash;­some said over a hundred, though that was
  probably an exaggeration. It was well established, however, that he had
  feasted on human flesh during his earlier manhood, and that he had begotten
  several children since becoming a great-grandfather; nor was it impossible,
  as legend asserted, that he had once slaughtered with his own hands two
  hundred prisoners captured in battle. One could imagine sometimes that the
  memory of such exploits gleamed in his brilliant eyes; and, in fact, most
  white visitors (such as government officials from Singapore) were so apt to
  imagine things of this sort that they scarcely ever managed to treat him as a
  human being. Gathergood, however, was not a man of imagination, nor, in his
  relations with the Sultan, was he troubled by reflections sinister or
  abstruse. It did not occur to him that His Highness&rsquo;s nondescript
  clothing and enormously developed stomach made him comic, or, at least, any
  more comic than his own notorious chastity must seem to the Sultan. The two
  of them, one so old and the other no longer young, respected each other.
  Sometimes they talked about plants, birds, and insects; the Sultan was
  interested in Gathergood&rsquo;s expeditions to the interior and had always
  used his influence to further them. His eyes forgot their years during such
  interviews, and the Agent, shouting the lilting Cuavanese dialect into the
  old man&rsquo;s ear, chatted with no more difficulty than with some deaf old
  crony in an English bar-parlour.</p>

  <p>That evening their talk was protracted longer than usual. Bright-turbaned
  attendants brought the Agent a long ceremonial cigarette, and lit beside him
  two large, beeswax candles. The first question, raised by the Sultan himself,
  concerned a letter he had recently received from an American university,
  offering to confer on him the degree of Doctor of Literature in return for a
  registration fee of a hundred dollars. The Sultan, sincerely proud of the
  distinctions that civilised countries had already granted him, asked
  Gathergood&rsquo;s advice; and the latter returned a simple negative. It was
  thus that they had dealt with many problems during the past four years.</p>

  <p>Then they touched upon the future of Naung Lo, still in the Sultan&rsquo;s
  prison in connection with the Morrison affair. The Sultan had been deeply
  perturbed by the tragedy, and was willing, indeed eager, to behead somebody.
  Gathergood described his continuing investigations, adding: &ldquo;It still
  doesn&rsquo;t seem to me that the case has been proved.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Sultan inclined his head. &ldquo;Very well, Tuan. He shall
  wait.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then Gathergood outlined, as well as he could, the difficulties that might
  arise out of unrest in the kampong. He suggested that the Sultan should
  increase the native police force, put an extra tax on the sale of gin, and
  issue an official edict denouncing the doctrines of Russian and Chinese
  communism. The Sultan, who had been very pro-British during the War, and
  whose habit of mind was inclined to be fixed, could not entirely escape the
  conviction that he ought at once to arrest and behead the crew of a German
  sailing-ship loading cutch in the estuary; but at the end of
  Gathergood&rsquo;s explanation he signified an earnest and cordial agreement
  with all the main points.</p>

  <p>After that, as the old man was obviously fatigued, Gathergood made to
  depart. But there was one other matter which the Sultan broached with almost
  a child&rsquo;s shyness. &ldquo;Tuan,&rdquo; he croaked, holding
  Gathergood&rsquo;s hand again, &ldquo;I have some pictures for you.&rdquo; He
  took out of his jacket pocket a small Kodak, from which, with a smile, the
  Agent removed the used film. It was the Sultan&rsquo;s principal hobby, and
  though many of his snapshots tended to be either obscure or obscene was
  always ready to oblige by developing them in his little improvised dark-room
  at the bungalow. &ldquo;I will bring them to you next week,&rdquo; he
  answered, and the Sultan responded, with conventional courtesy: &ldquo;Good
  night, Tuan Bezar. Your visit has made me very glad.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Events, however, prevented Gathergood from keeping his promise. That very
  night, while he was asleep under his mosquito-net, a score or more planters,
  fully armed, marched on the Sultan&rsquo;s palace, forced an entrance,
  kidnapped Naung Lo from his prison-cell, and hanged him from a tree in the
  jungle less than a mile away.</p>

  <p>Gathergood did not hear of this till the morning, when his house-boy
  brought him the sensational news. He was, for him, immensely disconcerted. He
  was even, when he had begun to consider it, appalled. In all that the
  Morrison case had so far meant to him, there had been simply the question of
  the accused man&rsquo;s probable guilt or innocence. Of the tangled interplay
  of motive, racial and political, that might lie beyond that straightforward
  issue, he had been remotely aware, but he had shrunk from it; he lacked
  intricacy of vision, and his instinct was always to ignore the intangible.
  Now, at a stroke, the merely judicial question had been transformed into a
  matter of vaster significance which he took some time to comprehend. He sat
  for over an hour before his office-desk, thinking things out with an entire
  absence of personal passion that concealed, nevertheless, a growing inward
  uneasiness. The day was warming up; clammy and so far sunless, it sent hardly
  a ripple of sea moving over the sandbars of the estuary, and the tops of the
  rubber-planted foothills soared into a creamy haze. Towards midday he sent a
  boy with written messages to all the planters, asking them to meet him in the
  club-house during the afternoon. That done, he deliberately wrote business
  letters as usual and gave the daily orders to his Chinese cook; after which,
  having taken a drink and a sandwich, he walked up the hill to the
  club-house.</p>

  <p>The planters awaited him there in a mood of sultry, half-shamed
  truculence. It was possible that already, in the light of day, their exploit
  seemed less wholly estimable. But this reaction was itself counterbalanced by
  an intensifying of their feeling towards the Agent; sprawling over the chairs
  and tables, they faced him as if whatever might be unstable in an unstable
  world, their hatred of him was sure. They clung to it, for defence, for
  companionship, for very love of one another; and seeing them, Gathergood
  suddenly felt himself a scapegoat for all the trouble that had visited Cuava
  since his predecessor left it&mdash;­for untapped trees and rebellious
  labourers and bankrupt companies, for dread movements on distant stock
  exchanges, for doom that could sweep as swiftly as pestilence. He, the Jonah,
  had come to Cuava as a human symbol of unluck, so that upon him, it seemed,
  the rage of men against events must now be concentrated.</p>

  <p>He was not a good talker in public, but he had prepared what to say, and
  it was, as he said it, very simple. The night&rsquo;s escapade, he began,
  without preamble, was as dangerously mistaken as it was utterly
  unjustifiable. At this there was much dissent, and he waited quietly for
  silence. It was typical of him that the arguments he developed had an almost
  legal precision; Cuava, he reminded them, was the Sultan&rsquo;s territory,
  and the attack on his palace could only be regarded as equivalent to an act
  of war. Neither the home government nor that at Singapore could or would
  defend them in such a matter. Here a shout of &ldquo;We can defend
  ourselves&rdquo; stung him to a retort which, being impromptu, was more
  humanly pungent: &ldquo;Perhaps, then, you&rsquo;ll tell me how a few dozen
  whites can hold out against twenty thousand natives if the latter make a
  concerted attack?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He talked for some time, dealing with interruptions and questions as they
  arose; he was calm throughout, and perhaps this calmness, as much as
  anything, became eventually impressive. He stirred misgiving in their minds,
  then doubt, then a touch of panic, and, last of all, a chastened mood in
  which one of them could ask, almost humbly: &ldquo;Well, Gathergood, granted
  that there may be something in what you say, what would you recommend us to
  do about it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Agent had his reply ready. &ldquo;Choose one of yourselves as a
  representative, and let him come with me to the palace immediately&mdash;­
  we&rsquo;ll smooth things down as best we can.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At this, as Gathergood had expected, there was a further uproar of dissent
  and defiance; he stood watching and hearing it emotionlessly, his eyes remote
  and implacable. All he said when the shouting subsided was: &ldquo;Well,
  gentlemen, it&rsquo;s for you to decide. You asked my advice and I gave it. I
  know the Sultan is reasonable; if he can be convinced that no personal insult
  was intended, and that you were merely carried away by your feeling about
  Morrison, a good deal of the harm may yet be undone. Think it over.&rdquo;
  Suddenly, at that, he turned and left them, walked out of the club, and back
  through the oven-heat to his bungalow.</p>

  <p>Till evening he rested; then a deputation of planters came to see him. He
  received them on his verandah, offering drinks, which they declined. They
  announced without courtesy, their decision to take his advice, and Franklyn,
  who had been Morrison&rsquo;s particular friend, was the representative they
  had chosen. He was a tall, sallow-faced man of about fifty; he lived with his
  wife in the largest bungalow on the hill, and had never troubled to disguise
  his dislike of Gathergood. The latter now glanced at him and replied:
  &ldquo;Very well. If you&rsquo;re ready, Franklyn, we&rsquo;d better go up
  now, without delay.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Franklyn laughed with forced cynicism. &ldquo;All right, if it&rsquo;s got
  to be done. You guarantee a safe return, I suppose, Gathergood? No doubt
  you&rsquo;re in a position to&mdash;­the old boy&rsquo;s rather a pal of
  yours by all accounts? So long as I don&rsquo;t get pushed overboard, like
  Morrison, or stuck by a kris.... If I do, you&rsquo;ll be responsible.
  Personally, it seems to me a damsilly thing to go bootlicking to a
  nigger.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Gathergood did not reply. He was calling his house-boy and giving orders
  about the journey.</p>

  <p>They went, not by canoe, but in Franklyn&rsquo;s Ford, driven by the
  planter himself up the winding, rutted track amongst the hills. Little was
  spoken; the fact that Franklyn&rsquo;s apology would be completely insincere
  did not, of course, matter much, but it made for Gathergood an extra discord
  between them. As the journey progressed the Agent became conscious of the
  hairline precariousness of the entire situation, and of the alarming extent
  to which he had personally become involved in it. He tried to think if at any
  point he had taken an incautious step, or had come to an unwise decision; but
  everything he had decided seemed preferable to the likely results of doing
  otherwise. He even in a certain sense looked forward to meeting the Sultan;
  it might be comforting to talk things over quietly with that serene old
  patriarch. A reasonable man, Gathergood stressed to himself; whatever else, a
  REASONABLE man....</p>

  <p>But once again the march of events had tragically forestalled. What
  happened is best described in Gathergood&rsquo;s own phrases, as he had to
  compose them for a later audience. When he and Franklyn arrived at the
  Sultan&rsquo;s palace they were admitted, not to the Sultan, but to a
  congress of sons and grandsons, by whose orders they were promptly arrested
  and flung into prison, without any chance of explaining their mission. The
  aged Sultan, it appeared, had died of an apoplectic fit caused by the
  excitement of the previous night&rsquo;s attack on his domain.</p>

  <p>The two prisoners were without weapons; they tried the walls in vain for
  any means of escape, and at length lay down on the mud floor in sheer
  weariness. Towards midnight by Gathergood&rsquo;s watch Franklyn was led out
  by armed guards, with whom the Agent expostulated and struggled in vain. The
  planter&rsquo;s subsequent fate was never definitely established&mdash;­the
  exact manner of his death, that is to say. Gathergood, however, was released
  later on during the night&mdash;­apparently on account of his friendship with
  the late Sultan. To his enquiries, entreaties, and protests about Franklyn,
  he could obtain nothing but evasive replies.</p>

  <p>Driving back to his bungalow as fast as the Ford would take him,
  Gathergood might well have wished that no such distinguishing clemency had
  been shown him. That he did not, that he steered unhesitatingly down the
  craggy hillsides, was clue to the curious singleness of mind that permitted
  him only one purpose at a time. He felt the seriousness of the situation
  rising round him like a gale, but he had no conception of the force of the
  wind or of the general direction in which it was blowing. Turned now, by
  logical process, into a man of action, he drove through the dark jungle
  tunnels with one thought new and foremost in his mind&mdash;­the deliverance
  of Franklyn. He did not then know or suspect that the planter was dead, but
  the fact of his being held a prisoner was serious enough. And he began,
  thinking clearly during that summer dawn, to make plans for contriving or
  enforcing a release. He perceived that the entire English colony in Cuava
  must now be mobilised for defence, that help would have to be summoned from
  the mainland, and that in these matters there was not a moment to be
  lost.</p>

  <p>When he reached the water-front not far from his bungalow he found that
  hostilities had already broken out between the whites and the natives. His
  first instinct, even amidst so many greater urgencies, was for the
  suppression of disorder nearby, and when he could no longer drive the car, he
  jumped out amongst the mob of drink-inflamed coolies and knocked down one man
  whom he saw looting a store. He was himself hit and badly battered, and might
  have suffered more severely had not the crowd been scattered by a volley of
  rifle-shots from the surrounding hills, where the planters had already
  improvised a firing-line. Several natives were killed and wounded, and
  Gathergood was unlucky enough to get a bullet through his leg.</p>

  <p>So began one of those apparently spontaneous outbreaks which from time to
  time acquaint the British taxpayer with the extent and variety of his
  responsibilities. The trouble at Cuava, resulting in the death of one
  Englishman (Franklyn) and fifteen Chinese and Cuavanese, made a sufficiently
  startling headline for the London breakfast-table, whither it was served
  along with the tactful information as to where and what Cuava was. A question
  was later asked in the House of Commons, in reply to which the Under
  Secretary for the Colonies announced that a cruiser and two gunboats had
  already arrived at Cuava from Singapore, that order in the affected districts
  had been completely restored, and that a full and exhaustive enquiry would be
  held as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>At that enquiry Gathergood was, of course, a principal witness.</p>

  <p>He had been ill of a fever following his wound, and as if that were not
  enough, a dose of malaria had pushed further the attack on his normally
  robust health. During the days before the cruiser could take him on board he
  had been looked after by his Chinese cook&mdash;­ the only person who, in
  that emergency, had seemed to care what happened to him. Afterwards, at
  Singapore, he had spent a month in the government hospital&mdash;­until
  nearly the time of the enquiry. He then engaged a room at the Adelphi. He
  found the bustling and expensive life of the place a strange and soon a
  tiresome contrast from Cuava. He had never cared much for cities or for the
  gaieties they offered, and Singapore, during the hot season, with its
  gaunt-chested rickshaw- men sweating along the tarred, sticky roads, made him
  long for the enquiry to begin and end so that he might get away. He was
  lonely, too&mdash;­a condition he had never known in Cuava, but which the
  crowded public rooms of the hotel induced unfailingly. He knew nobody, though
  he was uncomfortably aware that he was known to many by sight&mdash;­the
  trouble on the island having been featured so prominently in all the local
  newspapers. He had read them in hospital, of course, and knew by now that
  Franklyn&rsquo;s death must be presumed. It had been a tragic blow, not so
  much on account of the man personally, as of the revelation it gave of a
  world in which folly led to folly and violence begat violence. If there were
  anyone whose death he did personally mourn, it was the aged Sultan. All would
  have ended happily had he been alive, and the Agent thought with sympathy of
  the old, wrinkled potentate whose life- interests had so pleasantly
  progressed from cannibalism to photography.</p>

  <p>The enquiry, held in one of the government buildings, began on the hottest
  day of the year; the stifling atmosphere, impregnated with the smells of dust
  and leather and teak panelling, affected everyone with fatigue or
  peevishness, and even the chairman seemed once or twice on the point of
  falling asleep over his opening oration. He was a pale and elderly civil
  servant, rather obviously timid in the presence of his colleagues, one of
  whom, a red- faced, bristling, stiff-backed major, had an air of challenging
  even the temperature to a trial of endurance. The rest of the committee
  comprised two members of the local legislature and a naval commander, a
  lithe, careless- looking Irishman with a nearly bald head and impudent eyes.
  In attendance on the five were a mixed bevy of white and Eurasian
  shorthand-writers and newspaper-men; while a small gallery at the rear was
  occupied by such members of the public as had been fortunate enough to secure
  cards of admission. There had been a keen demand for these among the friends
  of the committee, and the result was a quite fashionable audience, mainly of
  women eager for drama. Conspicuous in the front row, a single touch of black
  amongst the prevalently brighter colours, sat Franklyn&rsquo;s widow.</p>

  <p>The chairman spoke long and tediously, and it was not till the second day,
  during which a heavy thunderstorm broke, that the gallery occupants could
  feel their patience rewarded. Late in the afternoon Gathergood was called. He
  had not been permitted to attend the earlier sessions, but newspaper reports
  had already given him some idea what to expect. Yet though he had thus
  prepared himself for the small insolences of cross-examination, it had
  certainly never struck him that he would be treated less like a witness than
  a prisoner on trial. Grimly, after his first hour of questioning, he
  perceived that things were to be even worse than had seemed possible. His
  words were being misquoted, his actions misdescribed, and his motives
  misinterpreted. With all his awareness of unpopularity, he had never guessed
  that even the bitterest dislike could frame such a conspiracy, or that, if
  framed, it could prevail with reasonable persons. But perhaps the men and
  women facing him were not reasonable. They represented him, for instance, as
  having condoned the murder of a white man by a native, and of having
  interceded with authority on the latter&rsquo;s behalf. It was implied that
  he had definitely taken the part of the native Cuavanese in a matter
  affecting white prestige. His mission of pacification to the Sultan was held
  up as an act of humiliating unwisdom equivalent to handing a hostage to the
  enemy. He had, it was to be inferred, deliberately led Franklyn to his death.
  At this point in the proceedings Mrs. Franklyn broke down and sobbed audibly
  for several moments, while the chairman stuttered out a few sentences of
  sympathy. When the cross-examination was continued, Gathergood was
  uncomfortable as well as grim, and created a definitely bad impression on
  listeners already predisposed to receive one; his very carefulness in
  choosing words, which was normal to him, was taken for over-
  subtlety&mdash;­as when, for instance, he answered: &ldquo;No, it
  wasn&rsquo;t that I thought Naung Lo innocent; I only thought that he might
  not be guilty.&rdquo; This, spoken in slow, deliberate tones, sent a hot
  draught of exasperation across the room.</p>

  <p>He was asked, of course, about that final tragic pilgrimage to the
  Sultan&rsquo;s palace with Franklyn, and he described it with an exactness
  that made no glimmer of appeal for sympathy. The truth was, his anger, always
  slow to rise, was now engulfing him in the blackest bitterness of soul. He
  would not, by a word or by a movement of a muscle, plead with these people
  who were so obviously bent on vilifying him. He sat rigid in the
  straight-backed seat, his blue eyes fixed in a stare that only occasionally
  quickened, and only at one spectacle&mdash;­the clock that ticked away his
  ordeal. Once or twice, faint with the heat, he found his attention wandering,
  and generally it was some outdoor scene that flashed momentarily before him,
  some remembered spot on one of his jungle expeditions, the place where he had
  found the sciuropterus or that Polypodium carnosum. And then, breaking in
  upon such ill-timed tranquillities, would come the chairman&rsquo;s rasping
  monotone: &ldquo;Are we to understand, Mr. Gathergood... So, Mr. Gathergood,
  it amounts to this, that you... Now, Mr. Gathergood, let&rsquo;s be quite
  clear about it&mdash;­you say you ... &rdquo; And so on.</p>

  <p>Yet the Agent was never near breaking down under the strain. He was upheld
  by his bitterness; relentlessly he gave reasons why he had done this or had
  omitted to do that, and even the major&rsquo;s querulous: &ldquo;But surely,
  man, you must have realised ... &rdquo; only drew from him a quiet: &ldquo;I
  didn&rsquo;t realise it, anyway.&rdquo; Once the naval commander interjected,
  apparently to the assembly in general: &ldquo;Of course we must all remember
  how easy it is to be wise after the event&rdquo;; and Gathergood gave him a
  swift glance in which just more was visible than mere assent. But on the
  whole he preserved an outward emotionlessness that antagonised his hearers as
  much as it disappointed them. The commander tried sometimes to counter this
  by skilfully leading questions; he remarked, for instance, at one juncture:
  &ldquo;I should think, Gathergood, you must be feeling yourself rather an
  unlucky fellow. Things seem to have gone persistently wrong in all your
  calculations&mdash;­a sort of chapter of accidents, eh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Gathergood began to respond: &ldquo;Yes, and as a matter of fact...&rdquo;
  and then checked himself sharply; whereat the major, pouncing to the
  occasion, barked out: &ldquo;Continue with what you were going to say, Mr.
  Gathergood.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing of any consequence&mdash;­a mere reflection of my own that
  can hardly matter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never mind, let&rsquo;s have it,&rdquo; snapped the major, enjoying
  himself; and the chairman nodded emphatically.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was only thinking that the whole thing began with an
  accident&mdash;­ quite a trifling one&mdash;­Morrison&rsquo;s hat blowing
  into the sea&mdash;­&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Again the wave of exasperation passed across the faces. But the end was
  near. On the afternoon of the fifth day Gathergood was suddenly informed that
  he need not stay further or attend again. He bowed to the chairman and
  walked, briskly limping, from the room. He felt that the manner of his
  dismissal was that of a conviction and sentence all in one. Even the Eurasian
  attendant with whom he had left his hat treated him with barely concealed
  superciliousness.</p>

  <p>That evening, while he was taking coffee in a corner of the hotel lounge,
  he was surprised to be accosted by the naval officer who had been a member of
  the committee. His name was Holroyd, and after a few perfunctory remarks he
  planked himself down at the same table. Gathergood, though not especially
  anxious for company, offered a drink, and they chatted together for some
  time, but without mentioning the enquiry; then Holroyd suggested that the
  Agent should stroll over with him to his hotel, the De la Paix, for another
  drink. Gathergood agreed and they finally sat up in Holroyd&rsquo;s private
  room till nearly midnight. The commander, in this more intimate atmosphere,
  was breezily candid. &ldquo;I daresay you&rsquo;ve guessed by this time,
  Gathergood, that you&rsquo;re going to get all the blame&mdash;­which I
  don&rsquo;t suppose you deserve&mdash;­nobody does deserve what he gets in
  this world, whether of blame or anything else.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Gathergood said very little in reply; he had explained himself
  exhaustively and in public for four days, and had no desire to go all over
  the ground again. He merely sipped his whisky and let Holroyd go on
  talking.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The question is,&rdquo; continued the commander, &ldquo;what are
  you going to do now that the show&rsquo;s over?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That was the question, undoubtedly; and from the moment of his dismissal
  from the enquiry-room Gathergood had seen it confronting him. He answered, a
  trifle curtly: &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t want to stay here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should jolly well think not.... How&rsquo;re you feeling now, by
  the way? Pretty rotten, I expect, after your leg-smash and all the strain of
  the talky-talky.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My leg&rsquo;s healed well and I feel all right.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How about putting in for a spell of sick leave, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t consider myself really ill.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Holroyd grunted. &ldquo;Well, Gathergood, if you won&rsquo;t take the
  hint, it&rsquo;s no use beating about the bush. I&rsquo;m here, speaking
  quite frankly, to make a definite suggestion to you&mdash;­put in for leave
  and get away back home. Not necessarily to England&mdash;­in fact, on the
  whole, I&rsquo;d say not England, for the time being. Take a long foreign
  holiday somewhere&mdash;­nice little places in France or Italy... anyway,
  clear off pretty quick out of this rotten hole. There&rsquo;s going to be a
  hell of a rumpus when the report comes out, and if you take my tip, you
  won&rsquo;t wait for it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m due to retire next year, you know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then it fits in rather well, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather have served out my full time. Not in Cuava, of
  course, but&mdash;­&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Holroyd shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m damned sorry, Gathergood, but you
  can wash out all idea of that. Absolutely no point in mincing matters, is
  there? But if I were you, I wouldn&rsquo;t fret about it. &rsquo;Be damned to
  you&rsquo;&mdash;­that&rsquo;s the feeling to have when fate gives you a
  knock in the eye.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; replied the Agent quietly. For the first time then he
  showed signs of emotion, though only for a few seconds. His mind received the
  full impact of the future, recoiled a little, and then steadied itself.
  &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he added, in control again, &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s
  just about my own attitude too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That midnight, as soon as he was back in his own bedroom, he wrote out a
  formal application for leave, received an affirmative reply by return of
  post, booked his passage on a French liner bound for Marseilles, and sent his
  former Chinese cook two hundred dollars and instructions for the packing and
  transhipment of his belongings from Cuava to a furniture depository in
  London.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap2"
     id="chap2">CHAPTER TWO. &mdash; FLORENCE FAULKNER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;Oh, dear, now it all begins again,&rdquo; thought
  Miss Faulkner, scampering along the platform with her usual smile of
  sprightly welcome. She had a mixed collection of books and papers under her
  arm. She nearly always had. And she was nearly always smiling, or scampering,
  or both. The clanking carriages drew slowly in, pulled by an electric engine
  that stood at the far end ticking like an enormous clock. Faces appeared at
  windows&mdash;­windows that bore the labels of an English travel
  organisation, and Miss Faulkner, still scampering, shouted out: &ldquo;Hello,
  everybody&mdash;­is the train early, or am I late?&rdquo; which was the kind
  of remark which, in her estimation, put people at their ease immediately and
  helped them to begin a holiday in the right spirit.</p>

  <p>The train was from Calais; its passengers had been travelling all night
  and the day before. The women looked heavy-eyed and bedraggled, the men were
  blue-chinned after two days without a shave. They came from the vague
  hinterlands of suburb and provinces, urged across eight hundred miles of land
  and water by an enterprise which was not their own, but that of a limited
  liability company working for profit and earning (in normal years) some
  fifteen per cent. This organisation, after the manner of its age,
  manufactured the demand which it afterwards proceeded to supply. Its
  brochures were superb examples of art-printing and chromo-lithography, and
  its well-known advertisement of a pretty girl smiling over the rail of a
  Channel steamer in excessively calm and sunny weather had been painted by a
  R. A. At the other end of the business, however, expenditure was less lavish.
  The usual practice was to charter a second-rate hotel for the season at such
  a price that its proprietors, to make any profit at all, had to supply
  inferior food. Another economical plan was to employ, instead of full-time
  guides and couriers, a semi- amateur staff of part-time workers, most of them
  school-teachers, who were willing to work during their summer holidays for
  very little more than pocket- money.</p>

  <p>Miss Faulkner was one of these people. She was small-built, pert-faced,
  bright-eyed, and aged thirty-seven. Just the person for the job, most people
  said: by which they meant that her London Matriculation French was understood
  by foreign railway-porters who knew English, that she possessed a sheepdog
  aptitude for yapping (though pleasantly) at people&rsquo;s heels till they
  had all climbed into the right vehicles, and that her smile was of the kind
  usually described as &ldquo;infectious.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well, it&rsquo;s a nice day, that&rsquo;s something,&rdquo;
  thought Miss Faulkner, marshalling the arrivals and seeing them installed in
  a couple of late-Victorian horse-omnibuses. &ldquo;Yes, aren&rsquo;t they
  sweet?&rdquo; she said cheerfully. &ldquo;I believe there&rsquo;s some talk
  of putting them in the local museum.&rdquo; People always laughed at that.
  She darted about, answering questions, giving orders, ticking names on a
  list, already memorising faces; really an exceptionally capable woman. And
  smiling all the time. A rather wide smile, showing good teeth, but (if one
  bothered to notice such things) a smile that did not cause much to happen to
  the rest of her face. &ldquo;Yes, Mrs. Walsh, your bag will be all
  right&mdash;­all the luggage is coming along afterwards,&rdquo; she sang out;
  and Mrs. Walsh, a granitic matron who might otherwise have given trouble, was
  instantly captivated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been having it quite hot here lately,&rdquo; continued
  Miss Faulkner, in the omnibus, launching the regulation chitchat about the
  weather. &ldquo;And I see from the papers it&rsquo;s been cold and rainy in
  England.... Yes, we get all the English papers here a day late.... There,
  that&rsquo;s the Jungfrau&mdash;­that big one over there. Rather fine,
  isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; And privately to herself she reflected: &ldquo;I must
  write to George immediately after lunch, or I shall never get a
  chance.&rdquo;...</p>

  <p>Just as the horses turned out of Interlaken&rsquo;s main thoroughfare into
  the side-street leading to the hotel, a man stepped off the kerb and would
  have been run down had not a shaft caught his arm and jerked him back. One of
  the horses half-stumbled, and the driver pulled up and began to shout angrily
  in German. There seemed here the makings of an awkward little scene, and it
  was in just such an emergency that Miss Faulkner was at her best. Climbing
  down from the omnibus she first commanded silence from the driver and then
  approached the pedestrian. He was well-dressed, she noticed, and she was
  relieved to find that he was English. &ldquo;It was entirely my own
  fault,&rdquo; he admitted, calmly. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t looking where I was
  going at all. Fortunately I&rsquo;m not hurt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, well, if that&rsquo;s the case, there&rsquo;s really nothing
  more to be said, is there?&rdquo; replied Miss Faulkner, flashing her smile.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re all right. Good morning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man raised his hat and walked off, and Miss Faulkner, continuing her
  smile to her people in the omnibus, climbed in again. &ldquo;Really,&rdquo;
  she said, as the journey was resumed, &ldquo;if people WILL do these
  things&mdash;­&rdquo; Somebody cried: &ldquo;Day-dreamin&rsquo;, that&rsquo;s
  what he must have been doin&rsquo;,&rdquo; and Miss Faulkner echoed:
  &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s just it!&rdquo; with an air of finding the remark a
  perfect and wished-for expression of her own feelings. There was thus a
  second person captivated.</p>

  <p>When the hotel was reached, Miss Faulkner presided briskly over the usual
  commotion about rooms; then came lunch, during which, from the head of the
  long table, she made the speech she always made at first meals. It was one of
  carefully mingled exhortation and facetiousness&mdash;­all about being
  punctual, making the best of things, keeping together on party expeditions,
  and taking warm clothing on the mountain trips. &ldquo;Oh, yes, and
  there&rsquo;s just one other thing&mdash;­ some of you may already have
  discovered that foreign hotels don&rsquo;t supply soap. If you haven&rsquo;t
  brought any with you, there&rsquo;s a chemist&rsquo;s shop just round the
  corner where they speak English.&rdquo; Somebody cheered. Miss Faulkner
  smiled. And then: &ldquo;Perhaps we&rsquo;d better not plan anything for this
  afternoon, as I daresay many of you feel tired after the journey and would
  like to rest.&rdquo; She gazed round the tables with a look of slightly
  intimidating enquiry, and the response came easily to her bidding, in the
  form of mumbled assent. &ldquo;All right. Then we&rsquo;ll meet again at
  seven-thirty for dinner.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thank goodness, she thought, escaping through the crowd&mdash;­that left
  her free for the afternoon. She went up to her bedroom and dragged a wicker
  chair to the window. The view was not of the Jungfrau, as all the
  advertisements would have led one to assume, but of a row of similar windows
  overlooking a small well-like courtyard in between. Free for the afternoon,
  Miss Faulkner echoed to herself, as she got out pen and paper and began to
  write. The letter was to her brother, who worked in a stockbroker&rsquo;s
  office in Old Broad Street. She wrote:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;DEAR GEORGE,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks for sending on my correspondence. The weather here has been
  hot, which I don&rsquo;t mind, except that it makes people dawdle, and I have
  to keep on chivvying them to catch their trains. They&rsquo;ve been a rather
  dull crowd so far, and this week&rsquo;s new arrivals don&rsquo;t seem much
  different. Still, I suppose it&rsquo;s all to the good that they should come
  out here instead of going to Margate or Blackpool or places like that.
  I&rsquo;m sorry you didn&rsquo;t like the Virginia Woolf&mdash;­I thought it
  quite marvellous. Mrs. Ripley writes that she&rsquo;d like to borrow my notes
  on Silesian minorities to use in a paper she&rsquo;s getting up, so if she
  calls, they&rsquo;re in the third drawer of my bureau desk, but please
  don&rsquo;t mix up the other papers in it. I expect I shall be returning
  to-day fortnight. I hope you&rsquo;re managing all right in the flat, and
  don&rsquo;t forget to leave the cats their milk when you go out in the
  mornings. This is in haste, as I simply haven&rsquo;t a moment to spare.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your affectionate sister,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;FLORENCE.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That done, and the envelope sealed and addressed, Miss Faulkner wrote half
  a dozen other letters, after which she packed them under her arm with her
  usual mixed collection of books and papers, and went downstairs to the
  post.</p>

  <p>There was a box inside the hotel lobby, but she preferred the short walk
  to the little blue letter-box fixed to the lamp-post down the road. She
  scampered out, through the swing-doors, into the warm glare of the pavement.
  The sun was shining out of a sky that really was the blue of the picture-
  postcards, and even the Jungfrau looked somewhat like the advertised
  Jungfrau. Miss Faulkner, however, was not normally a person to rhapsodise
  over such matters. She walked straight to the lamp-post, inserted the
  letters, and walked back. Just as she climbed the hotel steps she noticed a
  man sitting on the terrace outside the Hôtel Oberland, the bigger and much
  more aristocratic hotel immediately opposite her own, which was the Hôtel
  Magnifique de l&rsquo;Univers. She felt sure he was the man whom the omnibus
  had nearly driven down, and in seeking to verify the recognition she stared
  so hard that when he chanced to glance up she felt that the only thing
  possible to do was to smile. And having smiled, and having received in return
  a slight but courteous bow, she felt she must at least say something to
  excuse the smile. So she ran across the road and began: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so
  sorry about the omnibus dashing into you like that&mdash;­I do hope you
  weren&rsquo;t really hurt. And I must say, even though it may be true that
  you weren&rsquo;t looking, that man does drive round corners rather
  recklessly. It was very kind of you, anyhow, to take it as you did. I mean,
  it saved a lot of delay and argument.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man seemed surprised to be accosted thus and with such volubility.
  &ldquo;I assure you I haven&rsquo;t even a bruise to show for it,&rdquo; he
  answered, looking her down with very blue eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad.... It&rsquo;s marvellous weather, isn&rsquo;t
  it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, great,&rdquo; he replied.</p>

  <p>Miss Faulkner, smiling again, recrossed the road to her own hotel.
  Obviously a gentleman, she had confirmed; his clothes, his accent, his
  manner, all were satisfactory. For she had belonged to the Left Wing of the
  English Labour Movement long enough to know that though you might attack
  gentlemen, as a class, and even, as a measure of social reform, seek to
  abolish them, they yet remained, as individuals, most charming and agreeable
  people.</p>

  <p>For the rest of the time before dinner she busied herself with the
  findings of a commission whose bulky minority report she had been somewhat
  pointlessly carrying about all day.</p>

  <p>Miss Faulkner was the headmistress of a council-school in Bermondsey. She
  was clever, successful, and possessed an abundance of energy as well as that
  immense capacity for taking pains which, whatever else it is, certainly is
  not genius. But, genius apart, she was a talented woman; she could speak
  fluently at meetings, serve effectively on committees, and bully a
  school-inspector into overlooking the fact that her children, though skilled
  at clay-modelling and pastel-drawing, were unfortunately less able to read
  and write. Her ambition was some clay to become an M.P., and to this end she
  was already associated with many of the movements and campaigns of advanced
  Socialism. Not that she was by any means insincere. A passion almost
  flame-like in its intensity sustained her in her many activities; she really
  did possess a love for humanity, and the further removed humanity was, both
  in space and time, the more she loved it. Her favourite school lesson, for
  instance, was one in which she described the sufferings of the little boy
  chimney-sweeps in the early nineteenth century; and in modern times a Chinese
  famine, especially when documented by Blue Book or White Paper statistics,
  could move her to genuine tears of compassion. With the local unemployed she
  would probably have sympathised almost as warmly had not so many of them
  approached her for personal help. &ldquo;My good man, I can&rsquo;t give to
  everybody,&rdquo; she would say; which was true enough, for four hundred a
  year did not go far when one had a half-share of a flat in West Kensington,
  and when even the telephone- bill often came to ten shillings a week. She
  was, anyhow, continually giving money away, more often in guineas than
  coppers, and her chief reason for spending August as she did was to obtain a
  healthful holiday of a kind and duration that she could not otherwise have
  afforded.</p>

  <p>Besides, as she often remarked to friends in England, it was a means of
  doing good to others as well as to herself. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why the
  loveliest places in the world should only be visited by the rich,&rdquo; she
  would say, with that clear-voiced truculence especially designed by nature
  for the painless extraction of &ldquo;hear-hear&rsquo;s&rdquo; from an
  audience. &ldquo;We get the middle classes as a rule, you know, and though
  they may be a little tiresome at times, one does feel that one is helping
  them to enjoy experiences they ought to have. Sometimes we even get actual
  working- men&mdash;­we had a most intelligent engine-driver only the other
  week. I think that sort of thing is just splendid.&rdquo; Miss Faulkner
  always spoke of working-men as of some astonishing natural phenomenon which
  she had studied for a university doctorate.</p>

  <p>That evening she saw the man at the &ldquo;Oberland&rdquo; again. He was
  taking coffee on the terrace after dinner, and from the crowded lobby of the
  &ldquo;Magnifique&rdquo; she could observe him whenever anyone pushed open
  the swing-doors to go out or come in. He was reading a paper and smoking a
  cigar, and in the light of the orange-shaded lamp at his elbow she could see
  that his hair was greyish. Elderly, therefore. And by himself. On business?
  But no; she had not thought he looked a business man. And suddenly, perhaps
  because the report she had lately been reading was connected with it, she
  imagined him as having something to do with the League of Nations. Its
  headquarters were at Geneva; what more likely than that its personnel should
  take trips to Interlaken? But that, of course, raised a possible doubt as to
  his nationality; his accent might be perfect, but might not a League official
  have a perfect English accent without being necessarily English? He must be
  Nordic, on account of his blue eyes; and she therefore imagined him a German,
  because she had an emotional pity for Germans and because at one moment, when
  she glanced at him, she thought he looked rather sombre. Pondering, perhaps,
  on the iniquities of the Treaty of Versailles or on the problem of the Polish
  Corridor.</p>

  <p>Later that evening, after he had left the terrace, she went out for a
  short stroll and, on the way back, stopped to chat a while with the uniformed
  porter of the &ldquo;Oberland,&rdquo; whom she knew quite familiarly, and who
  graciously permitted the exercise of her French. After discussing the chances
  of the next day&rsquo;s weather she said, abruptly: &ldquo;Oh, by the way,
  who is that man who was taking coffee on the terrace just now&mdash;­sitting
  by himself at the table near the lamp?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An Englishman,&rdquo; replied the porter, with half a wink.
  &ldquo;A Mr. Brown, of London.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Miss Faulkner was disappointed. Her pitying thoughts of a derelict schloss
  in the Rhineland and of a family starved to death in the blockade subsided
  painfully; as a Mr. Brown, of London, he was clearly less remarkable. And
  then, entering the hotel on the other side of the road, she added, what was
  quite obvious, that it was of absolutely no consequence who or what he was,
  and that he would probably be gone to-morrow, anyway.</p>

  <p>But he had not gone on the morrow. He was seen (by Miss Faulkner) having
  breakfast on the terrace while she shepherded her party to catch the train
  for the Schynige Platte. She smiled and he nodded. It was another lovely day,
  pleasantly cool on the mountain-top, though hot down below. She functioned
  with her usual sprightliness, smiling at least a hundred times as she gave
  advice as to the purchase of drinks and picture-postcards. On the way back
  she could not help wondering if Mr. Brown, of London, had yet left the
  &ldquo;Oberland.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He had not. She saw him that evening on the terrace, but he was engrossed
  in a book and did not look her way.</p>

  <p>The next morning there was no sign of him, and she was surprised in the
  afternoon to discover, from a casual question to the porter, that he was
  still staying. It did not matter, of course. She smiled hard throughout
  dinner and gave a pithy little lecture, in her best schoolmistress manner,
  about the Gorges of the Aar that were to be visited on the following day.</p>

  <p>She saw nothing of him then, either. But on the day after that, the
  Wednesday, by sheer chance they met on the train to the Jungfraujoch. It was
  an expensive excursion, costing over two pounds extra, and for that reason
  she had only half a dozen of the party under her charge. They had already
  entered the train and she had climbed in after them and found a vacant seat
  before noticing that he was opposite her. &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; she
  said, with brisk eagerness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

  <p>He had a book open on his knee, and she obeyed a natural impulse to
  decipher the title upside down. It was Shaw&rsquo;s &ldquo;Intelligent
  Woman&rsquo;s Guide to Socialism.&rdquo; Her eyes glinted; surely it was a
  good sign when a man was found reading Shaw in a train. She meant (for she
  was already aware that he interested her) that it was so much the more likely
  that they would have tastes in common. And she slightly revised her picture
  of him as a German delegate to the League of Nations; perhaps, if the Shaw
  were any evidence, he was in the International Labour Office. &ldquo;A
  fascinating book,&rdquo; she commented, keenly.</p>

  <p>He looked up and answered, after a pause: &ldquo;Personally, I&rsquo;m
  finding it rather dull.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; She yet contrived to smile. She knew there were lots
  of people nowadays who thought Shaw a back number, and she remembered once
  hearing a pert Communist at a committee meeting say that Shaw&rsquo;s book
  would have been much more interesting had it been an Intelligent
  Socialist&rsquo;s Guide to Woman.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course Shaw&rsquo;s getting very old,&rdquo; she said, with a
  hint of unutterable drawbacks.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, he must be.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And then she remarked in the casual way she had so often found effective:
  &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I was ever impressed with him myself. He talks at
  you rather than to you, and it gets on one&rsquo;s nerves after a time. At
  least it did on mine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here, of course, his obvious cue was to express surprise that she had
  actually met Shaw, and the fact that he didn&rsquo;t only disappointed her
  until she realised that he was probably so used to meeting famous people
  himself that it had hardly struck him as remarkable. She became quite
  certain, at that moment, that he was &ldquo;somebody.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>All he said was the one word &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She was just a little discouraged by this, and did not speak again until
  they had to change trains at Lauterbrunnen. Then, amidst the warming
  sunshine, she thought, with sudden boldness: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested in
  him and would rather like to get to know him; why shouldn&rsquo;t I, then,
  deliberately enter the same carriage and sit next to him in the new
  train?&rdquo; After all, nobody would ever blame a man for doing that, if he
  were interested in a girl.... That final argument, with all that it implied
  in connection with the equality of the sexes, clinched the matter. Miss
  Faulkner waited till the man had chosen a seat in the train that goes up to
  Wengen and Scheidegg, and then led her small party in after him. &ldquo;Here
  again,&rdquo; she exclaimed brightly, banging the window down. He
  smiled&mdash;­ a rather slow, cautious smile, as if for the first time he
  were taking real notice of her. &ldquo;You are going up to the Joch?&rdquo;
  he queried.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. Are you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long journey, but well worth it. Is this your first
  visit?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She felt rather glad of that. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be impressed, on a day
  like this. I was, tremendously, when I first came. In fact, I always
  am.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You come pretty often, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Once a week during August.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You see, I&rsquo;m only here for the month. This is really my
  holiday....&rdquo; And in a quarter of an hour&mdash;­before the train
  reached the green slopes and red-roofed chalets of Wengen&mdash;­she had told
  him all about her job, her school in Bermondsey, and her friendship with
  Bertrand Russell. He listened politely, without saying very much. At
  Scheidegg, where there was another change of trains, she kept the
  conversation going so incessantly that it would have been nearly impossible
  for them not to re-seat themselves together. All this time she had been
  somewhat neglectful of her party, but as soon as the train set off she rose
  and delivered, in her very best style, a short account of the building of the
  Jungfrau Railway, its cost, difficulties, and the number of lives lost during
  its construction. When she had finished she smiled at everybody, and then,
  sitting down, bestowed a little private smile upon the man next her. &ldquo;I
  hope you weren&rsquo;t startled by my sudden burst into professional
  activity,&rdquo; she began.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;On the contrary, it was most
  interesting&mdash;­all that you said. A marvellous piece of engineering...
  And another thing interested me too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The way&mdash;­if you&rsquo;ll excuse my being personal&mdash;­the
  way you managed to make yourself heard above the noise of the train without
  shouting. I&mdash;­I could never manage to do that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She laughed. &ldquo;Have you tried?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not exactly in trains. But I&rsquo;ve had other experience. I
  suppose it&rsquo;s partly knack and partly the voice one&rsquo;s born
  with.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Surely not THAT,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Babies can always make
  themselves heard anywhere. At least, my babies can.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This time it was he who laughed. &ldquo;Yes, of course.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A moment later it occurred to her to add: &ldquo;I meant my official
  babies, you know&mdash;­the children of four and five at my school. I
  haven&rsquo;t any other kind of babies.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Accepting the information, he seemed a little pensive afterwards, and by
  the arrival of the train at the terminus Miss Faulkner thought she had
  progressed distinctly well, though she was forced to confess that she knew
  scarcely anything more about him. And yet to have led the conversation to
  babies! She smiled with extra emphasis as she gave her people the usual
  cautions about wearing sun-spectacles and not over-exerting themselves at the
  unaccustomed altitude. Babies, indeed! For she had a sense of humour, no less
  acute because it sometimes and for long intervals deserted her
  completely.</p>

  <p>Few places could have been more helpful to the ripening of acquaintance
  than the Jungfraujoch. In the restricted area round the station and hotel
  there was little to do except send off picture-postcards, peer through the
  telescopes at distant skiers, and enjoy the novel combination of blazing
  sunshine and deep snow. Miss Faulkner found renewed opportunities of talking
  to Mr. Brown, and Mr. Brown no opportunities at all of escape. It was typical
  of her that, however much she might let her imagination soar as to his
  possible identity, she perceived quite clearly that he was not&mdash;­not
  yet, at any rate&mdash;­attracted by her. Probably, she decided, he was not a
  man who cared for women at all. But she was far from being daunted. If you
  wanted to get anything in this world, she had discovered, you usually had to
  set out in pursuit of it&mdash;­quite shamelessly, if need be. This certainly
  applied to such things as headships of schools, presidencies of societies,
  and political candidatures; no doubt also to friendship. She had once read
  somewhere that liking other people was half the battle towards making them
  like you, and the theory gave her confidence to go &ldquo;all out&rdquo; in
  getting to know this man. Why not, if she wanted to?</p>

  <p>She certainly made the most of her time during that long, hot afternoon
  two miles high. Not only were the topographical but also the meteorological
  circumstances favourable; there was something exquisite in that hard, dry,
  sunlit brilliance, some sense of being suspended above and beyond the normal
  earth. She basked with him on the edge of a rock and gazed over the
  ten&mdash;­or was it twenty?&mdash;­ miles of snowy wilderness; then they
  turned their tinted glasses on the knife-edge of the Jungfrau summit, its
  outline crystal-yellow against a storm-green sky. Mr. Brown talked about
  mountains and said he would like to do some climbing in the Alps; he had had
  a little experience elsewhere, though not where there was snow. Some young
  climbers at his hotel, he said, had asked him to join their expeditions, but
  he had so far declined because he felt it might be too strenuous for him;
  after this, however, he thought he might perhaps give himself a trial if he
  were invited again. Which gave her the chance of asking: &ldquo;Are you
  staying long, then?&rdquo; And he answered: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really know.
  I&mdash;­at the moment, that is&mdash;­I haven&rsquo;t decided.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She could not resist a further probe. &ldquo;Of course, if you&rsquo;re
  taking a rest-cure, or recovering from an illness, or anything like that, I
  daresay you oughtn&rsquo;t to climb.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s no reason of that kind.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;re one of those lucky people who&rsquo;re never
  ill?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But for occasional bouts of malaria, I keep pretty well, I must
  say.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Malaria&rsquo;s bad, isn&rsquo;t it? I suppose you picked it up out
  East?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Er&mdash;­yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;During the War? I know several men who did.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He said that almost rudely. But she did not mind. They travelled back to
  Interlaken together, and all the way she kept the conversation going,
  somewhat to the continued neglect of her people. She did not mind that,
  either. She felt she had badgered the man quite enough about his private
  affairs, and must now set herself out to make up for it by being interesting
  and amusing. She more than partially succeeded, for she was well-informed,
  and had a good command of words as well as a retentive memory for the bright
  sayings of others. Her account of Soviet Russia, for instance, which she had
  visited for ten days on a lightning tour of co-operative societies, made him
  laugh several times. At the end, when they separated for their respective
  hotels, she said, with an air of suddenly realising it: &ldquo;I say, I do
  hope I haven&rsquo;t bored you. I&rsquo;m afraid I sometimes get rather
  carried away by these big topics.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; he answered, gravely, and added, with a ready
  smile: &ldquo;At least you&rsquo;ve given me plenty to think about.... Good
  night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps we shall meet again if you&rsquo;re staying on
  here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps so. Yes, certainly we may.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She hastily changed for dinner and faced at the dining-table a group of
  faces that eyed her none too cordially. The story that she had spent most of
  the day talking to a man from the hotel opposite had evidently spread. She
  decided to be particularly charming; indeed, she was&mdash;­she was almost
  radiant. Then, if not before, her case could have been definitely
  diagnosed.</p>

  <p>Miss Faulkner was by no means ignorant of love. She had been in love, and
  she had also read about it, not only in novels, but in physiological and
  psychological text-books. She had skimmed through the better-known works of
  Freud, Jung, Adler, Krafft-Ebbing, Havelock Ellis, Malinowski, and Stopes;
  she knew all about the Trobriand Islanders, and she was aware that the
  perception of beauty in moonlight or Mozart was largely an affair of the
  glandular secretions. Like most women possessed of her type of ambition, she
  fully realised the likelihood that she would never marry; nor did the
  prospect worry her much. Apart from the fact that she could not do so and
  keep her job, the ordinary routine of married life&mdash;­shopping, babies,
  and cinema matinées&mdash;­gave her no thrills of anticipated bliss. If she
  were ever to accept a man, he would have to be of an exceptional kind, and as
  that kind was not very likely to come her way, she was quite reconciled to
  remaining single. She liked children, but in mass rather than individually;
  and though she was certainly not undersexed, a good deal of what might have
  been sexual went out of her in other forms of energy. Sublimation, of course;
  that was another of the things she knew all about. And besides, in these days
  (1930) one need not be a prude. She did not object to an occasional
  flirtation, and she had, in her late twenties, adventured rather more than
  tentatively with a certain university extension lecturer who was now a Labour
  M.P. It had been her one practical experiment in a subject which she knew
  well enough in theory, and she had been hit pretty hard when he left her for
  a fat-legged Jewess who had written a banned novel. For a few days afterwards
  she had been unconsolable, weeping a good deal, and explaining to her
  teaching staff that she was on the verge of a breakdown from overwork. By the
  following week, however, she had salvaged most of her serenity at the cost of
  a rather greater urge to sublimation than ever. It worked well, indeed, this
  doing without men; and its very success reinforced her determination to make
  no surrender but to the most superior applicant.</p>

  <p>Miss Faulkner&rsquo;s attitude towards Mr. Brown was governed, therefore,
  by conditions perfectly well known to herself. She was attracted, and she was
  aware that the attraction was to a large extent physical; she liked the
  man&rsquo;s tallness, his distinguished, if not exactly handsome, features,
  his quiet voice, his rare but satisfying smile. The fastidious and slightly
  snobbish part of her was also attracted; she liked his well-dressed dignity,
  his accent, his courtesy, his old-fashioned readiness to treat her as a lady
  for no other reason than that she was a woman. Thinking the matter over in
  bed that night, she was very candid with herself. She was smitten; yes, most
  decidedly; indeed, she couldn&rsquo;t get the man&rsquo;s image out of her
  head. The way he had sat with her at the Jungfraujoch; no doubt it would give
  her a pang whenever she saw the place again. On the other hand, facing facts
  quite squarely, she came to the rather depressing conclusion that he probably
  wasn&rsquo;t very clever. His finding Shaw&rsquo;s book dull, for
  instance&mdash;­ not that that by itself proved much, but it linked itself
  with other things&mdash;­notably the fact that he hadn&rsquo;t made one
  really intelligent remark to her during the whole of their talks. He had
  listened; he had often made some &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; comment; he had
  certainly never said anything stupid; but of wit, of originality, of anything
  subtle or scintillating, there had been nothing. Miss Faulkner was
  disappointed, but she knew it could not be helped. After all, she met
  charming people far less often than clever ones, and how devastating for her
  if Mr. Brown had chanced to be both! She turned out the light, deciding that
  the really satisfactory conclusion would be for him to invite her to spend a
  week in Paris with him; she would accept, and they would thus live happily
  ever afterwards&mdash;­without each other.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately for this pleasant possibility, Mr. Brown had so far shown no
  sign of desiring even friendship, much less amorous adventure. Miss Faulkner
  admitted this, but without despair. She had, in her time, surmounted barriers
  that had at first seemed just as forbidding; and she surmised, too, that, in
  most men as in most women, love was largely a question of having the idea put
  into their heads when they had nothing else to do. Besides, it was fun trying
  to get what she wanted, particularly when it didn&rsquo;t matter a great deal
  if she were unsuccessful. It was even fun to try and imagine things about
  him, though she gave up her vision of a high Genevan official and substituted
  that of a retired bank manager whom his wife had left because she found him
  too much of a bore.</p>

  <p>And then, the very next morning, she made her great discovery.</p>

  <p>She had received by the first post a further batch of correspondence
  forwarded from England, and among its items was a monthly paper issued by
  some society to which she belonged&mdash;­one of those organisations for the
  protection, abolition, or propagation of something or other. The paper was a
  meagre product in its own particular class of journalism, badly printed and
  on poor quality paper, but its centre page did contain a sufficiently
  recognisable photograph of Mr. Brown. And underneath was the caption:
  &ldquo;Mr. Charles Gathergood, late British Agent at Cuava, Broken on the
  Wheel of Capitalist Imperialism.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Miss Faulkner knew, of course, all about Gathergood. She had followed the
  whole business in the daily Press; she had even proposed in public a
  resolution of protest against the shooting down of defenceless Cuavanese by
  British sailors. Her sympathy with the Cuavanese was naturally intense, since
  she had never seen them, and since all her respected sources of information
  assured her that they were the persecuted victims of sadistic rubber-planters
  in league with a cynical white bureaucracy. Gathergood, according to the
  unanimous and almost automatic decision of left-wing authority, had stood up,
  one solitary man against a system, to champion a stricken and exploited
  subject-race. He had refused consent to Prussianised methods (only, of
  course, one must not say &ldquo;Prussianised&rdquo; any more), and had in
  consequence been put to the cruel farce of an enquiry at which the real
  villains had sat in the judgment- seat and condemned him. Quite a vociferous
  section of English opinion held these views, and for some time after the
  issue of the report working-men hecklers at their opponents&rsquo; meetings
  had been in the habit of shouting: &ldquo;What erbaht Gathergood of
  Kewarver?&rdquo;&mdash;­just as they might similarly ask about the Zinovieff
  Letter, Amritsar, or any other disputed phenomenon.</p>

  <p>Upon Miss Faulkner, therefore, the unmasking of that heroic name behind
  the prosaic pseudonym came like a spark to dry tinder. She sat for a long
  time in her wicker chair under the bedroom window, holding the revealing
  photograph in her hand. Yes, she was sure it was he; the nose, mouth, and
  forehead were unmistakable, and even the eyes and hair were as confirmatory
  as could be expected from a newspaper print. And then, too, it fitted in with
  his own queer vagueness and reticences, with his mention of malaria, with the
  sombre look that she had noted in his eyes sometimes, with&mdash;­yes, yes,
  of course it did&mdash;­even with the very thing that had caused her
  misgiving. For how could he be expected to respond to stimulating
  conversation if his mind were still clouded with the memory of undeserved
  censure? And how could he feel in any mood for a display of mental agility
  after such storms as had lately broken over his head? Besides, however clever
  he might or mightn&rsquo;t be, he was principally a man of action, a hero.
  Normally Miss Faulkner was not very keen on heroes (she had always thought
  there was something a little vulgar about winning the V.C.); but
  Gathergood&rsquo;s heroism was clearly different; he had championed the
  oppressed, which was to say, the non-British; indeed, since the stand taken
  by the conscientious objectors during the War, Miss Faulkner could not call
  to mind anything more inspiring.</p>

  <p>She came down to breakfast with eyes ablaze, and when, in fear lest he
  were gone, she looked through the hotel doorway across the road, there he
  was, taking his coffee and rolls as usual, but, oh, how much more to her
  now&mdash;­this Gathergood of Cuava, man of such magnificent sorrow, already
  more than canonised in her heart.</p>

  <p>She had to escort her party to Brienz that day, but before setting out she
  scribbled a hasty note to her brother.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wonder if you would mind looking out and sending me back-numbers
  of the &lsquo;Record&rsquo; dealing with the Gathergood case&mdash;­you know,
  the man who refused to shoot the native rubber-workers in Cuava. I think Miss
  Totham gave me some cuttings about it as well&mdash;­they&rsquo;re probably
  in the cupboard under the gramophone. You might send them along with the
  papers and also the report of the Singapore Enquiry which was held recently.
  I daresay you can get it at the Stationery Office for a few shillings.
  It&rsquo;s a shame to bother you with all these things, but I know you
  won&rsquo;t mind. I&rsquo;d tell you why I want them, but it&rsquo;s rather a
  long story and I must dash away to collect my people for a train that leaves
  almost immediately. In great haste therefore,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your affectionate sister,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;FLORENCE.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>All the time she was piloting her party round the wood-carving shops at
  Brienz, Miss Faulkner was exulting over her discovery. Now, more than ever,
  she craved the friendship of the lonely, blue-eyed man at the
  &ldquo;Oberland&rdquo;; but now her desire was tinged with the thrill of a
  secret shared between them, with the pursuit of all her cherished ideals,
  with&mdash;­yes, with love. Indeed, for a moment there in the main street of
  Brienz she became quite dazed with her new vision and could only stare
  stupidly when she heard one of her party addressing her. &ldquo;Yes, they are
  rather sweet, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; she managed to answer at last, and to
  show a belated interest in her surroundings she picked up something
  haphazardly from the wood-carver&rsquo;s counter and pretended to examine it.
  She put it hastily back, however, on perceiving it to be a musical-box
  disguised as a toilet-roll.</p>

  <p>There was, of course, the question of immediate tactics to be settled;
  should she, or should she not, declare her knowledge? The fact that he was
  staying at the hotel under an assumed name seemed to indicate a wish not to
  be identified, which was quite understandable in the circumstances; on the
  other hand, might he not be glad of the sympathy that could be given him by
  one, such as herself, who understood and admired the real man? Still, Miss
  Faulkner felt a little doubtful about it. He did not look to be a person who
  would like anyone to find out something he had taken special precautions to
  conceal. Besides, might there not be a species of heaven-sent tact in knowing
  and yet pretending not to know? Might there not come a moment when Mr.
  Brown-Gathergood would think: &ldquo;What a marvellous woman&mdash;­she
  guesses, yet she respects my desire for privacy; I will therefore tell her
  everything.&rdquo; ... At the thought of that, Miss Faulkner decided quite
  definitely that she would adopt the more cautious policy. It certainly would
  be wonderful if he eventually told her himself, and she imagined a
  conversation which would end by her exclaiming: &ldquo;But, my dear, why
  should you have been afraid to tell me? Did you think I didn&rsquo;t guess it
  all the time?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At sunset that evening occurred the phenomenon known as the Alpine
  glow&mdash;­a momentary transfiguration of the mountains that turned their
  snow-slopes into the appearance of pink blancmange. All Miss Faulkner&rsquo;s
  party rushed out of the hotel into the middle of the roadway to stare hard,
  Miss Faulkner with them. And there, on the terrace opposite, the
  man&mdash;­her man&mdash;­was staring hard like everyone else. Miss
  Faulkner&rsquo;s heart experienced a sudden Alpine glow of its own; she knew,
  at that moment, that the world was full of beauty, that Switzerland was
  marvellous, that the Jungfrau was superb, that even the orchestrola tinkling
  away from the neighbouring bar was in tune with her own emotions at the sight
  of that saffron summit. Never had she experienced such a sensation of being
  at one with everything, part of the tumultuous earth; her eyes filled up as
  she edged her way through the crowd to the line of shrubs that fringed the
  &ldquo;Oberland&rdquo; terrace. &ldquo;Wonderful, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she
  breathed.</p>

  <p>The man looked down at her. &ldquo;Oh, good evening. ... Yes, it&rsquo;s
  great. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind being up there now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes... yes.... Oh yes....&rdquo; Trite remark and trite reply, yet
  how impossible it seemed for either of them to have said anything more, less,
  or different.</p>

  <p>A moment later the glow had faded into the cool grey distance, and the
  crowd was filtering back into the hotel. But Miss Faulkner stayed
  talking&mdash;­talking less fluently than usual, for she was struggling for
  mastery with forces that seemed to split her sentences in two just as she had
  them nicely shaped. It was queer; there was something now that made the
  barrier higher and more difficult than ever, and her emotion was a pain as
  well as a pleasure. The mountain-spectacle had made her feel that she must,
  at any cost, secure a repetition of that magic day with him&mdash;­not at the
  Joch again (which would doubtless be impossible to contrive), but somewhere,
  anywhere that would give them time and opportunity to talk. &ldquo;Have you
  made any plans for to-morrow?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I rather thought of going for a long walk somewhere beyond
  Lauterbrunnen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Splendid idea! There are some lovely paths along the
  valley.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was a few minutes later, re-entering her hotel, that she began to lose
  her sense of humour. She had already arranged a trip to Kandersteg for the
  following day, but she suddenly came to a new decision and announced there
  and then, to those of her party who were in the hotel lobby, that Kandersteg
  was &ldquo;off.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather a long trip, you see, and as most of you are
  leaving for England by the evening train I thought that a shorter one might
  be more suitable&mdash;­the Trummelbach Waterfall; we could leave comfortably
  during the morning and be back for tea.&rdquo; She felt quite victorious when
  they all agreed. For the waterfall was just beyond Lauterbrunnen, and there
  was only one road along the valley, so that if he were to be taking his long
  walk....</p>

  <p>But the next morning it was raining hard. She took her people to the fall
  and they all got soaked to the skin and there was no sign of the pedestrian
  hero. When she returned in the late afternoon she found that, like a sensible
  person, he had stayed indoors all day. It was the friendly porter of the
  &ldquo;Oberland&rdquo; who told her that. And he added: &ldquo;He was asking
  me about you this morning, miss.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Miss Faulkner could not repress a start of joy. &ldquo;He WAS? Was he
  REALLY? I hope&mdash;­I do hope you gave me a good character.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The porter grinned. &ldquo;Oh, yes, miss. I said you were very
  clever&mdash;­ could speak French, German, Italian,
  Spanish&mdash;­&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What nonsense!&rdquo; she interrupted, with gay indignation. But
  she was not without hope that the porter&rsquo;s account of her might have
  been nearly as impressive.</p>

  <p>The party went back to England that evening, having presented Miss
  Faulkner with an embroidered handbag and received in return her customary
  speech of thanks and farewell. She saw them off on the Calais train at the
  station. The next morning she met the incoming train with its load of new
  arrivals, &ldquo;Oh, dear, now it all begins again,&rdquo; she thought,
  scampering along the platform with her usual smile of sprightly welcome. She
  had a mixed collection of books under her arm. The clanking carriages drew
  slowly in, pulled by an electric engine that stood at the far end ticking
  like an enormous clock. Everything outwardly was the same as a week
  ago&mdash;­the labels on the carriage windows, the unshaven faces of the men,
  the two horse-omnibuses waiting in the station yard, the sky and the
  mountains and the level-crossing gate like a barber&rsquo;s pole that seemed
  so ridiculously confident of being able to hold up a Simplon express. All was
  the same, except Miss Faulkner, and she was different. She was in love.</p>

  <p>There could be no doubt of that. The affair with the university extension
  lecturer had been nothing to it. It caught up the urge of physical attraction
  and the drive of ambition and the devouring flame of her love for abstract
  humanity, and fused them all together into one transcendent and compulsive
  entirety. It turned Interlaken into the New Jerusalem and the Hôtel Oberland
  into the ark of all Miss Faulkner&rsquo;s covenants. &ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ve
  been having it quite hot here lately,&rdquo; she said in the omnibus.
  &ldquo;There&mdash;­that&rsquo;s the Jungfrau&mdash;­the one that has all the
  snow. ...&rdquo; But she felt she was dreaming, and talking in a dream.</p>

  <p>Sunday; she did not see him. The porter told her he had gone out early
  with some young men for a long walk and climb. As she returned with her
  people in the afternoon from Grindelwald, the church bell at Lauterbrunnen
  was tolling for a funeral, and she wondered if it were for some intrepid
  climber killed on the mountains. There was a wait of three-quarters of an
  hour at the station, and she left her party and hurried to the churchyard,
  feeling curiously warm and sentimental as she passed all the English names on
  the tombstones. She wanted to find some simple outlet for all her emotions,
  and she was quite disappointed when she reached the open grave and saw from
  the coffin-lid that the dead person was one Johanna Zimmermeister, aged
  eighty-seven.</p>

  <p>That evening she felt that she could not keep her secret any longer; she
  must tell somebody, anybody. So she wrote to her brother:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The reason I asked for the papers about Gathergood is because
  Gathergood is here, staying at the hotel across the road under an assumed
  name. I recognised him from a photograph. He is a very quiet man and
  naturally not anxious to mix up with people. But I have already got to know
  him, though of course he doesn&rsquo;t know I know who he is. We had a
  wonderful day together last week at the Jungfraujoch. I hope I may be able to
  help him eventually, because he&rsquo;s bound to feel very deeply all that
  has happened&mdash;­you have only to look at him to see that. I am sure you
  would like him; he is tall and rather slim, and has very blue eyes. I
  don&rsquo;t think I have ever seen a man who gives such an impression of
  brooding power, if you know what I mean. One would rather expect that, from
  the attitude he took up. I don&rsquo;t, of course, even hint at the subject
  of Cuava with him, but he did confide in me that he had been in the East. I
  want to read up the case so that when does feel inclined to tell me
  everything (as I think he will) I shall be able to show him how completely I
  understand. Perhaps the papers and things will arrive by to-morrow
  morning&rsquo;s post&mdash;­I do hope so....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They did, and she spent the whole of breakfast-time perusing them,
  forgetting her smiles, forgetting her small talk at table, and&mdash;­ most
  serious of all&mdash;­forgetting that the train for the Schynige Platte left
  at a quarter past ten. It was the first time she had ever made such a
  blunder, and she was compelled to fix up the impromptu alternative of a trip
  by lake steamer to Isseltwald and Giesbach. Her people sensed that she had
  mismanaged things, and were scarcely mollified when they observed her poring
  over a bulky paper-backed volume at every available moment. But Miss Faulkner
  was past caring for things like that. Her mind was roaming like molten metal
  into the vast ramifying moulds of human injustice, and the very loveliness of
  lake and mountain only served to throw her visions into more dazzling focus.
  It was terrible, and lovely, and nearly unendurable. Her body and spirit felt
  like a single raw nerve; she was in pain with pity, with an aching
  tenderness, with this love of hers. All over the earth the endless panorama
  of suffering humanity called her, and she yearned towards it, and in yearning
  saw the face of a man. Her man; the only man who was &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to all
  her eagerness and &ldquo;no&rdquo; to all her fears. If only she could make
  him respond a little! Had he not already, however unsusceptible at first,
  begun to interest himself in her? His questioning the porter about her seemed
  a good sign. And it was really unlikely that they could have progressed much
  faster, he with his natural shyness and she with that dawdling cavalcade
  always at her heels. But they had had that day together at the Jungfraujoch
  and he must have realised then how much they shared in common. Miss
  Faulkner&rsquo;s heart beat more hopefully when she reckoned up all this; no,
  it was not at all impossible; indeed, if fate but yielded an opportunity of
  overcoming the first impediments, the rest might almost be considered
  probable. Nor, quite honestly, could she imagine a more satisfactory match
  for either of them. He probably had money&mdash;­not very much, but enough to
  let her give up her job and devote herself wholeheartedly to &ldquo;the
  cause&rdquo;; in fact, as the wife of Gathergood ("You know, my dear, the man
  who&mdash;­&ldquo;) her chances and prospects would be greatly enhanced. And
  he too, reinforced by her capabilities, might go very far. She pictured the
  two of them, working together in perfect community of ideas and ideals,
  sitting perhaps for adjacent constituencies (she for Chester-le-Street, say,
  and he for Houghton-le-Spring), and living in some mellow Georgian house in
  Chelsea, with a big workroom full of white-painted bookshelves and a
  tradition of Sunday tea-parties for the intelligentsia. A sort of Sidney and
  Beatrice Webb business, but with moments during which even the Fabian
  bloodstream might race. And at this, the mere possibility of it, Miss
  Faulkner felt herself deliciously flushing. Absurd, of course, to let herself
  dream in such a way. And yet... and yet... there WAS the chance, the minute,
  incalculable chance that she had to seize if she could.... &ldquo;Oh yes, the
  tickets&mdash;­I have them, of course,&rdquo; she stammered, in confusion as
  the collector approached. But there was another hitch about that; she had
  thirty-three in her party and had bought tickets for only thirty-one. After
  complicated countings and reckonings she paid the difference; but it was
  another thing that had never happened before.</p>

  <p>That evening she watched the terrace at intervals from eight o&rsquo;clock
  till eleven; then she went across, trembling with almost physical
  apprehension, and began to chat with the porter. Mr. Brown had gone away that
  afternoon, he said, and at that she had a queer sensation as though she were
  on a Channel steamer and about to be sick. Before leaving, the porter
  continued, Mr. Brown had asked him for the name of a good hotel in Mürren,
  and he had recommended the &ldquo;Edelweiss.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You see, miss, Mürren is a better centre for climbing. Mr. Brown
  seemed to get very keen on it these last few days&mdash;­I think his trip to
  the Jungfraujoch impressed him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did he say so?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, miss. He said he would always remember it as one of the most
  marvellous days of his life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He DID? REALLY?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Miss Faulkner spent an excited and nearly sleepless night, and came down
  in the morning to the perfect sunshine and blue sky that she had dreaded.
  For, if the weather were thus fine, she had to take some of her people for
  that same Jungfraujoch excursion. She felt suddenly that she could not bear
  to go there again, to make her little speech about the construction of the
  railway, to watch the skiers through the telescopes, to see that ledge of
  rock overlooking the snow. She felt, indeed, as she faced her people at
  breakfast, that she could not endure anything, even a continuation of life
  itself, without relaxing the strain that held her passionately taut. And it
  was then, during breakfast, that the last vestige of a sense of humour
  deserted her.</p>

  <p>She left the table abruptly, dashed upstairs to her room, packed a small
  handbag with a few necessities, ran out of the Hôtel Magnifique de
  l&rsquo;Univers without saying a word to anyone, scampered to the station,
  and booked a single ticket to Mürren.</p>

  <p>In the funicular that climbs up the mountain from Lauterbrunnen, Miss
  Faulkner became calm enough to face certain obvious realities of the
  situation. She had, she perceived, most comprehensively burned her boats.
  Even after the greatest ingenuity of explanation, she could scarcely hope to
  escape condemnation for leaving her people in the lurch. Poor things, some
  arrangements would be made for them, no doubt; but they would certainly
  complain to the travel agency, and she would never be offered a cheap August
  holiday again. It didn&rsquo;t matter, of course. Nor did it matter that she
  owed the hotel a few small sums for tips and extras, while they, on the other
  hand, had possession of most of her clothes. Details of that sort could all
  be ignored for the time being, since far more urgent was the problem of what
  to do when she arrived at Mürren.</p>

  <p>One thing was clear enough: having burned her boats, she must make the
  burning worth while by risking everything, if necessary. It was no time for
  half-measures. She would have the great advantage of being free, at any
  rate&mdash;­no longer tied to a routine of times and places. And her
  programme was, in a sense, quite simple. She would go to the
  &ldquo;Edelweiss&rdquo; like an ordinary private visitor, book accommodation,
  and then&mdash;­well, she would meet him. She was bound to, staying at the
  same hotel in a small place like Mürren. She would have to compose some
  plausible story to account for her being there&mdash;­lies, of course, but
  again that didn&rsquo;t matter. (Afterwards, in that sublime imagined
  afterwards which her efforts were to make real, how good it would be to
  confess all these subterfuges&mdash;­to say: &ldquo;My dear, you&rsquo;ve no
  notion how utterly unscrupulous I was&mdash;­I lied right and left&mdash;­I
  was absolutely conscienceless about you. Do you forgive me?&rdquo; And he,
  perhaps, would make a return confession that he had gone to Mürren to forget,
  if he could, an attraction by which, at that early stage, he had been
  unwilling to be enslaved.... Oh dear, oh dear, how wonderful it would all be
  then!)</p>

  <p>She arrived at Mürren before noon, and walked from the station to the
  hotel. In that midday glory of sunlight the mountains across the valley
  dazzled and were monstrous. She had seen them from Mürren before, but never
  on such a day and with such eagerness to yield to rapture. She put on her
  sun-glasses and found them wet immediately with tears that had sprung to her
  eyes; oh, this beauty, this beauty everywhere and in everything&mdash;­did it
  really exist, apart from her sensing it?&mdash;­was it all no more than Freud
  or Havelock Ellis could explain in half a page? And this pity she felt for
  every suffering being, for soldiers in trenches and work-girls in asbestos-
  factories and the pigeons at Monte Carlo and the hunted stag on
  Exmoor&mdash;­was all this, too, conditioned by no more than secretions and
  ductless glands? She was passing a shop and went inside to buy a two-
  day&rsquo;s-old English newspaper&mdash;­anything to break the spell of such
  intolerable sensitiveness; but the spell took hold of the printed words and
  flaunted them like banners&mdash;­ Famine in China; Heavy Selling on Wall
  Street; Nottingham Tram-Driver Inherits Fortune; Lover Shoots Sweetheart,
  Then Himself; Rioting in Bombay; New Prima Donna Creates Furore; Plight of
  Alabama Flood Victims; Dance-Hall Proprietress Wins Action Against Commercial
  Traveller; New York Gangster&rsquo;s £20,000 Coffin... the whole
  world&rsquo;s crashing symphony, to which, with one&rsquo;s own heart-cry,
  one added but the faintest demi-semiquaver.</p>

  <p>In such a mood she came in sight of the Hôtel Edelweiss, and just then, as
  she approached, he came out of it. He was in heavy climbing boots and thick
  tweeds, and puffed at a pipe. She began to run towards him involuntarily,
  like a silly, excited child, though she hasn&rsquo;t yet thought of any story
  to tell, or any initial plan of conversation to adopt. It seemed enough, just
  then, to face him breathlessly, with her bright, terrible smile.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hullo, hullo...&rdquo; he answered, halting with a clank of his
  iron-tipped boots on the road.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good morning.... I&mdash;­I&mdash;­I&rsquo;ve just
  arrived.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So I see.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And then there came a curious silence, during which they both stared hard
  at each other. He KNOWS, her heart whispered; he knows <i>I</i> know; and he
  is angry for the moment, but that will pass. She went on:
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;­I&rsquo;m staying here&mdash;­in Mürren&mdash;­for
  several days. On business, you know. It&rsquo;s&mdash;­it&rsquo;s odd that we
  should meet again... isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, very odd .... Well, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me, I must get
  along&mdash;­I&rsquo;m meeting some people at another hotel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May I&mdash;­may I walk with you to it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose you may.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He set off at a good swinging pace, without continuing the talk. It
  occurred to her then that it might be her last chance, that she had bungled
  the encounter so far, and could do little worse by plunging straight into the
  depths. At least she would secure the advantage of surprise&mdash;­unless, of
  course, he HAD already guessed that she knew, in which case it might be a
  relief to him to learn how safe his secret was in her hands. She went on, in
  a low, desperate voice: &ldquo;You must think it strange of me to approach
  you like this, but I feel I can&rsquo;t keep silence any longer. To you, I
  mean. Others needn&rsquo;t know, of course.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;WHAT?&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known the&mdash;­the truth for some time. And believe
  me, I&mdash;­I honour&mdash;­and&mdash;­and admire you&mdash;­for
  it&mdash;­&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;WHAT? What are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You... YOU... you see, I know who you really are. I&rsquo;ve known
  for quite a long time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You say you know who I really am?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes... Mr. Gathergood... of Cuava... .&rdquo; She felt herself
  almost fainting as she uttered the words.</p>

  <p>He suddenly stopped and towered above her. &ldquo;Good God, woman, this is
  becoming preposterous! I don&rsquo;t know what sort of microbe has bitten
  you, but if you take my advice you&rsquo;ll catch the tram over there and get
  back to your proper business. Where are all your tourist
  people&mdash;­haven&rsquo;t you got THEM to look after?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I left them&mdash;­to come here and tell you. I felt I had to let
  you know what I knew. It was terrible for me, waiting. And I don&rsquo;t care
  how angry you are with me&mdash;­so long as you DO know. You can&rsquo;t deny
  it&mdash;­not to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Deny what?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That you ARE him&mdash;­really. Gathergood&mdash;­British Agent at
  Cuava&mdash;­&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He struck his heel sharply on the ground. &ldquo;Gathergood? GATHERGOOD?
  Why should I be him, whoever he is?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you ARE. I know you want to keep it secret&mdash;­I can
  understand and sympathise&mdash;­but to me, now that I know&mdash;­oh, you
  must tell me the truth!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, my good woman, that&rsquo;s just what I AM doing! I&rsquo;m
  sorry to disappoint you if this Gathergood man was someone you wanted to
  meet, but you must pull yourself together and be sensible. And if it&rsquo;s
  really any concern of yours, my name is Stuart Brown, I live in England, and
  on my passport I&rsquo;m put down as a company-director. Perhaps you&rsquo;d
  like to see it? No? Well, there you are, anyhow. This sort of thing
  won&rsquo;t do, you know, following men about and pestering
  them....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>With a quiet little cry of dreadfulness she put her hand to her head and
  scampered away. But when she was a few dozen yards off she swung round,
  flashed him her ever-bright smile, and called out: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all
  right. All my mistake....&rdquo; Then she broke into a shrill peal of
  laughter that echoed faintly across the valley to the green-blue glaciers. A
  few heads looked out of windows, saw the puzzled man and the laughing woman,
  and wondered what kind of joke, private or public, lay between them. But it
  all seemed of small consequence, on that blazing August noontide in Mürren.
  And a moment later Miss Faulkner turned the corner by the tramway-station and
  was gone.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap3"
     id="chap3">CHAPTER THREE. &mdash; STUART BROWN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">In the restaurant-car between Belfort and Paris, Stuart
  Brown got into conversation with a dark-haired and very good-looking young
  man sitting opposite. To Brown, who liked young men and who had lost an only
  son, there was always pleasure in these encounters, the more so as their
  transience minimised the risk of boredom. And at this particular moment Brown
  was bored enough with his own company and with the world in general to
  welcome any such attractive diversion. The deplorable issue of a recent
  business visit to Italy, plus that annoying incident in Switzerland, had
  induced what was for him an unwontedly darkened humour.</p>

  <p>The two chance travellers began to exchange commonplaces during the soup;
  by the coffee stage the youth had proffered a visiting-card which declared
  him to be a M. Palescu, of Bukarest. Brown did not reciprocate the intimacy,
  but he put the card away in his pocket-book and congratulated Palescu on his
  excellent English. &ldquo;You speak so well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I
  wasn&rsquo;t at all sure you weren&rsquo;t one of my countrymen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well, you see, my mother was English, and I have always had
  many contacts with English people. I have had jobs in India, Malta, and
  Egypt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must have travelled a good deal.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The youth smiled. &ldquo;That is one of the things I have been&mdash;­a
  traveller. What you call in England a &lsquo;commercial&rsquo;. Until
  recently I worked for my uncle, who was the head of a big firm in Bukarest.
  Then, early this year, owing to the crise mondiale, the firm went smash and
  he killed himself. My parents are both dead and my sisters&mdash;­&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Brown toyed with his cigar, sympathetic but a little disappointed. He had
  heard so many &ldquo;hard luck&rdquo; stories, and though he was by no means
  cynical about them, he could not but prefer a conversation that did not so
  soon and so inevitably drift into one. To his surprise and relief, however,
  Palescu went on quite cheerfully: &ldquo;My sisters have a little money,
  which is lucky for them, and I&mdash;­ well, I never wanted to settle at one
  thing for long. There&rsquo;s so much I want to do, and at present I&rsquo;m
  my own master, at any rate, though I&rsquo;m not yet making a
  fortune.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Brown found this optimism in adversity rather refreshing, and his own
  spirits willingly responded to it. He had always been a naturally optimistic
  person himself; even during the darkest days of the War he had not despaired,
  and throughout the post-War years of disappointments and disillusionments he
  had found comfort in a steadfast if rather vague belief that things were
  bound to take a turn for the better when they had finished taking turns for
  the worse. Even so, however, the events of the first half of 1930 had given
  his nerves one or two severe jolts, and in Italy he had just had a singularly
  unpleasant experience.</p>

  <p>Still, he could exclaim, only those few weeks afterwards to his casual
  acquaintance in the Paris train: &ldquo;Splendid! It&rsquo;s good to hear a
  fellow of your age talking so hopefully. Most of the young chaps in England
  nowadays ...&rdquo; He was about to enter upon his usual remarks about
  demoralisation caused by the dole, but reflected that a Roumanian, even an
  intelligent one with an English mother, might not comprehend them very fully.
  Besides which, the youth had just mentioned the word
  &ldquo;engineering,&rdquo; and at this Brown instinctively recoiled again,
  since he was in the engineering line himself, and sufficiently well-known in
  it for pushful young men to buttonhole him sometimes, in trains and hotels,
  and ask for jobs. Which, of course, was always very awkward and
  uncomfortable. He therefore remarked, rather cautiously across the table:
  &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s your profession, I don&rsquo;t altogether envy
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s pretty hard just now. But there&rsquo;s always room
  for new ideas&mdash;­especially in my branch of the trade.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Brown was not so sure, despite the fact that he had often echoed the
  platitude at meetings and public dinners. But Palescu&rsquo;s charming manner
  and almost sensational good looks were potent enough to overcome such a very
  minor misgiving, the more so as Brown was quite satisfied that the youth had
  no notion who he was. &ldquo;Provided you realise that an idea isn&rsquo;t
  necessarily good because it&rsquo;s new,&rdquo; he countered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, of course. But a really GOOD new idea. ... For instance, has it
  ever occurred to you, sir, why air-travel isn&rsquo;t yet really popular with
  the general public?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should say one of the reasons most people have is a rooted
  objection to being roasted alive.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, no&mdash;­not that&mdash;­not nowadays!&rdquo; Palescu laughed
  with a most attractive heartiness. &ldquo;What <i>I</i> mean is rather
  this&mdash;­suppose an aeroplane holds thirty people, all bound from London
  to Paris, yet you yourself don&rsquo;t want Paris at all&mdash;­you&rsquo;re
  going to Chantilly, say, for the races. The aeroplane, of course, won&rsquo;t
  come down at Chantilly just for you alone, out of the thirty. So what do you
  have to do?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear boy, don&rsquo;t ask me&mdash;­I never fly, I never go to
  races, and nothing would induce me to do either.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Palescu smiled slowly. &ldquo;I must explain then. The trouble about
  flying is that very often it doesn&rsquo;t save much time&mdash;­because it
  dumps you where you don&rsquo;t want to go. People talk of flying from London
  to Paris in so many hours, but unless you happen to live at Croydon and have
  business at Le Bourget, you often find that your total hours from place to
  place are not much less than by train and boat. And what if your business
  happens to be in some town that you actually fly over on the
  way&mdash;­wouldn&rsquo;t you feel: &rsquo;Ah, if I could only get down to
  it&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I daresay, but the same might happen on an express train that
  dashes through a place you really want to get to and takes you on to a big
  station miles beyond.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Except that on railways you can have what is called in England, I
  think, a slip-carriage.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s sometimes done. Of course I quite see that
  there&rsquo;s no possible parallel to that in the air.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But that isn&rsquo;t what I want you to see at all.&rdquo; The
  youth&rsquo;s dark, eager eyes expressed a certain merry ecstasy in the
  revelation he was approaching. &ldquo;As a matter of fact, there could be
  something like an aerial slip-carriage&mdash;­that&rsquo;s not a bad
  description of it. And&mdash;­and it happens to be a particular invention of
  mine that I&rsquo;m busy with just now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For the third time Brown&rsquo;s pleasure was momentarily retarded.
  Inventors were a tribe that had bothered him a good deal in the past; he
  counted them, on the whole, an even bigger nuisance than job-seekers. He
  remembered one fellow, during the 1928 boomlet, who had tried to get him
  interested in some new idea for burglar-proof bicycle-pumps.... But Palescu
  was talking on, with insurgent enthusiasm: &ldquo;My invention is a sort of
  aluminium cigar, not much bigger than a man, and quite light in construction,
  so that a large aeroplane could easily carry half-a-dozen of them. Each one
  would contain a very small petrol-driven motor at one end, quite as small and
  compact as a motor-cycle two-stroke, together with a system of gyroscopic
  controls embodying certain new ideas of my own. All the alighting passenger
  need do would be to get into one of these things at any point he found
  convenient, have himself launched from the tail of the machine in full
  flight, and come to earth. The &lsquo;gyrector,&rsquo; which is the name I
  have given to it, would descend in gradual spirals, and, when sufficiently
  near the ground, could be steered and brought to rest in any desired
  spot&mdash;­even, if need be, in a square or street in the middle of a town,
  or on the roof of a building. The cost&mdash;­&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His fluency suggested that the specifications had grown familiar to him by
  repetition, and Brown smilingly interrupted: &ldquo;What I should like to
  know is the degree of skill required in the person doing this steering
  job?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No more than in driving a car.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Some of us prefer a chauffeur, even for that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Palescu shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Ah, but the modern
  man&mdash;­&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You think he&rsquo;s likely to take kindly to your aluminium cigar,
  eh? I doubt it. Personally, I&rsquo;d rather lose half an hour and get
  carried on to Le Bourget, or wherever it is&mdash;­assuming I were compelled
  to go up in the air at all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, sir, I believe it would revolutionise air-travel. I
  estimate that if a gyrector were released from an aeroplane over Croydon, it
  could land on any fairly large London roof within ten minutes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Brown proffered his gold cigarette-case and then a
  match. He was, in a sort of way, enjoying himself. How infinitely charming
  was this spectacle of youthful ambition, and what a tender cruelty there was
  in deflating it! &ldquo;How would the poor fellow inside be spending his time
  during those ten minutes?&rdquo; he continued, banteringly. &ldquo;Would he
  be sitting or standing or what? Kneeling, of course, would be most
  appropriate.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He would be lying comfortably face forwards&mdash;­&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On his stomach? I wouldn&rsquo;t call that comfortable. Besides, it
  would crease all his clothes. You can&rsquo;t seriously expect any man over
  fifty to want to do gymnastic exercises in mid-air. Would he be able to see
  anything?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. He&rsquo;d have to see in order to steer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, I&rsquo;d forgotten those gyroscopic controls you mentioned.
  And also the little two-stroke engine puffing away at his heels. He
  couldn&rsquo;t smoke, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not. Though no doubt&mdash;­&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You might add a special smoking compartment later on,
  perhaps?&rdquo; Brown began to chuckle, and was pleased when Palescu joined
  in the laugh against himself. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re taking
  me very seriously, sir,&rdquo; said the latter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, well, my dear boy, you mustn&rsquo;t mind if I concentrate on
  a few flaws in your otherwise brilliant idea. And this estimate of yours,
  about landing on a roof in ten minutes&mdash;­what&rsquo;s it based on?
  Tangents and decimals and what not, I suppose, all worked out on paper. There
  haven&rsquo;t yet been any practical demonstrations, have there?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, because I can&rsquo;t find the money. But the plans are all
  complete&mdash;­I have them in my pocket now&mdash;­&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s always this consolation&mdash;­Providence, by
  keeping you hard up, is probably sparing your life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Maybe, sir, but I hope I shall soon find someone who holds a
  different opinion. My uncle&rsquo;s firm would have financed me, if times
  hadn&rsquo;t been so difficult. I&rsquo;m now trying to interest a French
  aeronautical firm&mdash;­that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m on my way to
  Paris.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good! I wish you luck&mdash;­joking apart, I do sincerely. And even
  if this idea of yours doesn&rsquo;t come to anything, don&rsquo;t
  despair&mdash;­you&rsquo;re young and you&rsquo;ll have many more
  chances.&rdquo; Brown paid his bill, adding an adequate but not extravagant
  tip, and then stared through the window. &ldquo;Chaumont, wasn&rsquo;t that?
  We ought to be in Paris by five. ... Well, good-bye&mdash;­it&rsquo;s been
  pleasant to have a talk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Palescu shook hands, and Brown responded very cordially. Charming youth,
  he reflected, as he made his way back along the swaying corridors to his own
  first-class compartment, and he further reflected, almost with amazement,
  that his own boy, had he lived, would now be in his middle thirties.</p>

  <p>Brown stayed in Paris overnight and continued the journey to London the
  following day. He took a room at his club in Piccadilly. There was no
  particular hurry to go on to his home in Cheshire, for his wife and daughter
  were away, the household staff were not expecting him yet, and the house
  would probably be in the hands of decorators.</p>

  <p>At the club he met Mathers, one of his co-directors. They shook hands and
  took coffee together in the lounge. &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m not sorry to be
  back in some ways,&rdquo; Brown said, &ldquo;though I do rather wish it
  hadn&rsquo;t been my first visit to Italy. I&rsquo;m bound to have collected
  a few unfortunate impressions.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mathers nodded sympathetically. He was a shrewd man-about-city and a great
  friend of Sir George Parceval, the chairman of the company; so that he knew
  that Brown had been to Italy after some money which, for all the likelihood
  there was of extracting it, might as well have been down the throat of
  Vesuvius. &ldquo;Any chance of salvage from the wreck?&rdquo; Mathers
  queried.</p>

  <p>Brown shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not. Looks as if Parceval
  will have to wipe the whole thing off as a bad debt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How much does it amount to&mdash;­roughly?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Between fifty and sixty thousand pounds.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I say... he won&rsquo;t like that. Why can&rsquo;t they
  pay?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The slump has hit them. They&rsquo;re old customers of
  ours&mdash;­quite honest. People give you the same answer
  everywhere&mdash;­the crisis; it seems to be the universal reason for
  everything.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Brown felt irritable as he discussed the matter; it was as if there were
  in the very atmosphere, of Mayfair no less than of Turin, some noxious
  element which he could not dispel, combat, or even identify. Changing the
  subject, he went on: &ldquo;I took a short holiday in Switzerland on my way
  back.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, that must have been more cheerful. Where did you
  stay?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Interlaken, to begin with. My first experience of really high
  mountains. Of course, when I was in India I often saw the Himalayas, but
  somehow they don&rsquo;t really count&mdash;­they might be a theatre back-
  cloth for all the use they are to the ordinary person. But Switzerland has
  tamed everything so magnificently&mdash;­railways and funiculars to take you
  everywhere and hotels to give you whatever you want in most unlikely
  places&mdash;­yes, I found it all very enjoyable. I should have stayed there
  longer, only a rather odd business happened that spoilt things just a bit
  towards the end, and made me leave suddenly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll laugh when I tell you. Some woman&mdash;­a guide to
  one of those tourist-parties they have&mdash;­apparently mistook me for
  somebody else and fairly pestered the life out of me. My hotel happened to be
  opposite hers, and I simply daren&rsquo;t show myself without her dashing out
  to talk. One awful day she got into the same train with me going to the
  Jungfrau mountain&mdash;­that&rsquo;s a wonderful trip, by the way&mdash;­and
  never stopped chattering for seven hours. Really, I&rsquo;m not exaggerating.
  In the end, I left Interlaken and went up to Mürren, chiefly to get away from
  her, and bless me if she didn&rsquo;t follow me there. Then it turned out
  she&rsquo;d thought I was someone else&mdash;­or so she said&mdash;­somebody
  named Gathergood, who&rsquo;d been a British Agent somewhere or
  other&mdash;­I think she was probably a little off her head, if you ask
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean the Gathergood who got into trouble over the
  Cuava outbreak a few months ago?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t always see things in the papers.
  What about him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There was some bother with the natives, and he funked pretty badly
  and caused the death of a white planter&mdash;­that&rsquo;s roughly what I
  seem to remember, though I wasn&rsquo;t very interested in the
  case.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, it doesn&rsquo;t seem much of a compliment to be mistaken for
  him, then. Anyhow, I could see there&rsquo;d be no holiday worth while if I
  stopped anywhere within reach of the woman, so I packed up and came away
  before my time. Odd sort of thing to have happened.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not so odd as you might think. The world is full of queer women.
  Did I ever tell you about the one who accosted me once in&mdash;­&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mather&rsquo;s stories were long and strictly conformable to type. They
  invariably depicted him as the object of perfervid passion on the part of
  some female, a passion whose fruits he had somewhat nonchalantly gathered,
  but only after a most fastidious scrutiny as to ripeness. There was a
  ripeness, indeed, about Mathers himself. Short in stature, with chubby
  cheeks, a completely bald head, and a rather quick-firing smile, his nickname
  amongst his business associates was unprintable, but implied a certain
  popularity. He was the type that rotary clubs offer to the world as
  ambassadors of goodwill towards men, and the fact that he made, on the whole,
  more friends than enemies may perhaps be held to justify the choice. Brown
  liked him well enough.</p>

  <p>Mathers said, finishing his yarn a quarter of an hour later: &ldquo;So,
  you see, Brown, that kind of woman is fairly common everywhere. If
  she&rsquo;d been pretty it might have been rather fun for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She wasn&rsquo;t pretty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, anyhow, she gave you a memorable
  experience&mdash;­that&rsquo;s something to have happened on a holiday. I
  don&rsquo;t suppose you met anyone else who&rsquo;ll stick in your mind as
  well, eh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Probably not. There were some fellows at Interlaken whom I got to
  know, but I didn&rsquo;t find them very interesting. Quite the pleasantest
  person I did meet was a young Roumanian on the train to Paris&mdash;­a really
  delightful youth who was on his way to try and sell an invention to a French
  aeroplane firm. Had an English mother, he said, so he spoke English
  perfectly. And he was full of that same cheeky sort of optimism
  that&mdash;­that my own boy used to have. You never met him, did you? He was
  just like that&mdash;­had the most amazing ideas that weren&rsquo;t of any
  practical use, yet he always believed quite firmly that they were going to
  make his fortune and turn the world upside down.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What was this Roumanian&rsquo;s bright idea?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, what he called a &lsquo;gyrector&rsquo; to land passengers from
  aeroplanes.&rdquo; Brown gave a sketchy and slightly satirical exposition.
  &ldquo;Perfectly mad, of course. I should think the Frenchmen will have a
  pretty good laugh over it, though they won&rsquo;t be able to help being
  charmed by the fellow personally.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t try to get you to take it up, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Naturally, I was careful not to let him guess who I was.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They both laughed and then went on talking about other matters.</p>

  <p>Not that Brown was anyone of any special importance. He was merely the
  head of the firm of Brown and Company, recently absorbed in Amalgamated
  Engineers, Limited. Brown and Company was quite an ancient concern of its
  kind, having been founded by an ancestral Brown at the beginning of the
  nineteenth century; its detailed history, indeed, would provide a useful
  epitome of the Industrial Age itself. Brown the First had begun as a workman
  in the famous firm of Boulton and Watt; with initiative to launch out
  independently and the luck to do so at the right moment and on a rising
  market, he had ended as a fairly rich proprietor of a small but prosperous
  business. Throughout the Victorian era that prosperity had developed, not by
  leaps and bounds, but with an intermittent progress that made the
  privately-held shares a more acceptably gilt-edged investment year by year.
  After 1900, when the firm became a public company, profits had fallen off a
  little, but during the War years munitions contracts had made Brown little
  less than half a millionaire. Then had come the slump, the long years of
  deepening depression, until in 1928 he had met Sir George Parceval and been
  induced to join up with a group of similar companies to form the
  merger-combine, Amalgamated Engineers, Limited. That promises of a quick and
  automatic return to prosperity had not been fulfilled was due, no doubt, to
  the world-crisis, against which even a Parceval could not contend.</p>

  <p>This Stuart Brown, great-great-grandson of the founder, was not much like
  that fiercely individualist pioneer. By the time it reaches a fifth
  generation, a dynasty usually manages to produce some divergence from
  original type, and Brown the Fifth was certainly divergent. In appearance he
  was tall, slim, clean- shaven and blue-eyed; a flatterer might even have
  added, distinguished-looking. But a detractor could equally have specified a
  forehead that was not quite decisive, and a general air of casualness that
  just escaped the excuse of elegance. Born a Northerner, well educated in the
  usual public-school tradition, and of intellect sufficient not to have
  absorbed that tradition too thoroughly, Brown was a likeable and even
  interesting personality, but he wore an almost constant air of observing life
  rather than participating in it, and his frequent pose of being the
  hard-headed business man was merely amusing to his friends. His tastes were
  quiet; he liked his garden, and music, and certain kinds of books; he did not
  care for sport, and was bored by much of the ordinary routine of
  pleasure-seeking. He was, in fact, too lazy to be fashionable in these
  matters. But he had a discriminating affection for good clothes, good food,
  good wine, good farming, good gramophone records, a good cigar, and, amongst
  men, good company. Women bored him as a rule, though he was devoted to his
  wife. She was an American of an old and quite poor Virginian family; he had
  somewhat spoilt her, and their one surviving child, though pretty, was both
  snobbish and extravagant. Both wife and daughter usually spent the summer
  months across the Atlantic, and during such periods Brown could always fall
  back into club-life and bachelorhood with a scarcely perceptible bump.</p>

  <p>It was since their departure in June that everything had seemed to go
  wrong. Even now, after his return from Italy, he was only slowly beginning to
  discover how wrong they were, and when he took his seat at the long mahogany
  table for the September board-meeting, his face expressed no greater concern
  than a general peevishness at the continuing malaise of the world. He felt
  rather tired and uncomfortable, but then he always did at those
  board-meetings. The sleek panelled room in the palatial offices in Finsbury
  Square struck such a different note from the one he had been used to in
  pre-amalgamation days, when he and a few friends had settled Brown and
  Company&rsquo;s affairs by means of a weekly gossip in the works-office at
  Stockport. Those cosier and more intimate scenes were linked in his mind with
  prosperity, while this cold, Persian-carpeted magnificence was a background
  to constantly expanding trouble. In some ways he wished he had never joined
  the combine; it seemed pointless, anyhow, to attend the meetings, for he
  rarely spoke or made suggestions. Between a dozen and a score other directors
  sat with him, and he scarcely knew all of them yet by sight, much less
  personally. They had all been brought in like himself; heads of individual
  firms, they had yielded to the blandishments of Parceval&rsquo;s talk about
  rationalisation, with the perhaps appropriate result that their only function
  nowadays seemed to be to listen to Parceval and vote as he told them.</p>

  <p>Not that Brown distrusted Parceval. On the contrary, he felt towards him
  an admiration that positively throve on their private antipathies. Sir George
  was most things that Brown was not. He was brisk, intense, and possessive;
  always immaculately turned out, he presided at board-meetings like the high-
  priest of some excessively stately ritual. He knew more about finance than
  engineering, and his arrangements of the combine&rsquo;s balance-sheet had
  certainly put it beyond the comprehension of most people except accountants.
  Brown was hopelessly fogged; he had long since ceased to wonder how much he
  himself was worth, except that he knew he had exchanged Government securities
  for shares in the combine&mdash;­a bad bargain, as revealed by 1930 stock-
  market valuations. But if he ever expressed misgiving, Parceval would say, in
  that boomingly bland way of his: &ldquo;My dear Brown, the combine has saved
  you already. If you&rsquo;d stayed out of it, it would have undercut and
  bankrupted you by now.&rdquo; Which seemed to Brown a rather depressing
  argument.</p>

  <p>During that first board-meeting after his return, Brown had as much of a
  tiff with Parceval as was possible between two persons of such differing
  temperaments. It arose out of the Italian debts which Brown had failed to
  collect. Brown asserted that the debtors, though unable to pay, were
  perfectly honest; Furnival appeared doubtful.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But damme, man,&rdquo; Brown exclaimed, heatedly,
  &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve been clients of ours for thirty years, and their fathers
  before them!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>To which Parceval responded: &ldquo;They owe us fifty-six thousand pounds,
  and it was on your recommendation that we allowed them credit to such an
  amount. I don&rsquo;t think I need say any more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And Brown, after that, both looked and felt like a rebuked schoolboy.</p>

  <p>Parceval, however, had one more thing to say that was of importance; an
  announcement that the current year&rsquo;s preference dividend would have to
  be passed. Brown, hardly calm after his previous outburst, was again
  indignant. &ldquo;Surely&mdash;­&rdquo; he began, and then found that he
  could think of nothing to express his feelings but another reference to
  history. &ldquo;For half a century Brown&rsquo;s have paid the dividends on
  their six per cent preferences. Never have they defaulted once! And the
  shareholders were induced to exchange into the combine&rsquo;s seven per
  cents by being assured that their dividends were going to be even safer!
  It&rsquo;s scandalous!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The money cannot be paid,&rdquo; answered Parceval coldly, and a
  few of the other directors, whose companies could not boast of such a record
  as Brown&rsquo;s, supported him. &ldquo;With large sums of money owing to us,
  we are bound to protect ourselves, and we shall do so in future, I hope, by
  greater care in the extension of credits to customers overseas.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Brown subsided again. &ldquo;Oh, have it your own way, then,&rdquo; he
  muttered, under his breath. Parceval always did have his own way, anyhow.</p>

  <p>After the meeting, however, the great man seemed anxious to make any
  necessary amends. He accompanied Brown in the lift and to a taxi, chatting
  affably meanwhile. &ldquo;I was glad to hear you had a good time in
  Switzerland,&rdquo; boomed the voice that had squashed so many awkward
  interruptions at shareholders&rsquo; meetings. &ldquo;Mathers was telling me.
  He also said you met a young Roumanian on the way home&mdash;­chap with some
  kind of aeroplane gadget he wanted to sell&mdash;­ wasn&rsquo;t that
  it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Brown forced himself to explain the matter briefly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answered Parceval, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m connected with a
  company that manufactures aeroplanes, you know, and I don&rsquo;t want to
  miss anything good.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think his idea was at all good. Quite impracticable,
  it seemed to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;MIGHT have something in it, though&mdash;­you never can be sure
  with these inventor fellows. I don&rsquo;t know if you could get in touch
  with him easily, but if he cared to call at my office in London I
  wouldn&rsquo;t mind hearing him talk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only got his address in Bukarest. He&rsquo;s probably
  back there by now.&rdquo; Brown searched a moment in his pocket-book and
  found the visiting-card, &ldquo;Here you are, if it&rsquo;s any use to
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks. When I write, if I do, I&rsquo;ll mention your name and
  your meeting with him, if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The devil you will,&rdquo; thought Brown, gloomily, but he lacked
  the energy to dissent, nor was there really much reason why he should. It
  had, however, suddenly occurred to him that he and his wife were the joint
  holders of forty-eight thousand preference shares in Amalgamated Engineers,
  Limited, and that the passing of the dividend would reduce their income
  during the current year from about six thousand to a little over four.</p>

  <p>That evening, at the club, he wrote a long letter to her, emphasising the
  poor state of trade, but avoiding the mention of any particular item of bad
  news. Time enough for her to learn the truth when she got home, he thought.
  After he had posted the letter he went to the second house of a music-hall,
  drank plenty of whisky, and went to bed. It was an unsatisfactory world, he
  decided, trying to sleep. He thought of his father and his grandfather and
  his great-grandfather, all living their lives quite comfortably in a more
  ordered age&mdash;­buying raw material and labour, selling the finished
  product, and pocketing the difference as neatly and as regularly as
  clockwork. All plain sailing in those days. You just made some useful
  article, charged a fair price for it, and there you were&mdash;­with a steady
  income for life. And, what was more, you could go on making and selling
  without worry. Golden days! But now, with passed dividends and bad debts
  abroad and currency losses and income- tax.... Good God, what were things
  coming to? And he thought, for one supremely mournful moment: &ldquo;Perhaps
  it&rsquo;s as well my boy didn&rsquo;t survive to carry on the firm, since
  the firm may not survive to be carried on.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>What troubled him most were the family and household economies that would
  have to be made. His own personal wants were simple, but his wife and
  daughter spent a good deal; he would have to be unpleasantly frank with them
  when they came home. Perhaps one of the three cars could be dispensed with;
  his wife might use the big Daimler in future and he himself could make do
  with a season- ticket on the railway... But by this time his natural tendency
  to look on the brighter side of things had begun to reassert itself, and he
  fell asleep tranquilly, hopefully, and a little drunk.</p>

  <p>About a fortnight later Brown was still in London and Parceval rang him up
  at the club one morning. &ldquo;Oh, hello, Brown. I&rsquo;ve just arrived in
  town again after a flying visit to Paris. Literally a flying visit. I had to
  meet the steel cartel... . By the way, I took the chance of looking up your
  Roumanian friend. Nice fellow, as you said.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He was still in Paris?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, and very glad to see me. It seems the French firm had just
  told him there was nothing doing, so he was pleased enough to try his luck
  somewhere else.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, what did you think of his idea?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh... interesting, you know. And probably no good. Most interesting
  ideas are like that. But I told him he could make a model of his tin-can
  arrangement down at my works at Chelmsford, if he cared to come over, so I
  expect he&rsquo;s quite happily packing now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you surely don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything in it, do
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, we shall know more about that when he shows us how it works,
  shan&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;you mean to say he&rsquo;s going to let himself be thrown
  out of an aeroplane in the thing?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose he is. He won&rsquo;t find anyone else in a hurry to
  volunteer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;­I don&rsquo;t much like it. He&rsquo;ll kill
  himself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say that. He needn&rsquo;t take a very big
  risk&mdash;­he can make his trial descents over some lake, with boats to
  bring him in if anything goes wrong.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should hope so.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course&mdash;­oh, of course. I like him very much, I may say. A
  delightful personality. ...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Brown had little time to think of the charming Roumanian during the
  next few weeks. Further cuts into his already straitened income seemed quite
  likely; added to which there came a rather peremptory request from his
  bankers to reduce a loan secured on shares of the combine. They had evidently
  got wind of the Italian and other losses, and were playing for safety. He
  couldn&rsquo;t blame them, but he thought it was damned bad luck for
  everything to come crowding on top of him all at once. Of course he must meet
  them somehow&mdash;­offer them some more shares or give them a mortgage on
  his Cheshire establishment, or something. He interviewed various high bank
  officials and found them sympathetic but definitely unwilling to accept any
  but gilt-edged securities as further cover for the loan, while his
  stockbrokers were even pessimistic about being able to dispose of some of his
  other shares at all. As for the house, the utmost he could raise on it was
  four thousand, and the bank people were asking for fifteen thousand
  immediately. Like most men who do not habitually worry, the sensation, being
  unfamiliar, turned quickly to panic. He tried to borrow from Mathers and
  several other friends, but either they didn&rsquo;t possess the money or
  wouldn&rsquo;t take the risk of lending. Finally, in complete desperation, he
  went to Furnival. But Sir George, though rich enough, did not by any means
  whip out a cheque-book and scribble with the alacrity of the copybook friend
  in need. He asked many questions with great minuteness and merely said, at
  the end: &ldquo;I shall have to think it over, Brown, and let you know.
  It&rsquo;s rather a big thing to ask, in these days... though of course
  I&rsquo;d like to help you, naturally. By the way, your Roumanian friend is
  nearly ready. Could you possibly manage to come over to Chelmsford on Friday?
  There might be something to show you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Brown promised to go. He spent most of the intervening days in a state of
  persistent and devitalising worry over his money affairs. It was not like him
  to fear the worst, but he could not subdue the waves of occasional despair
  that passed over him. His wife and daughter had already left Virginia on
  their way home, and the imminence of his meeting with them and of subsequent
  confessions reduced him to even deeper depression. For years he had had the
  habit of smiling cheerfully whenever his fellow business men were doleful;
  now he wondered if his cheerfulness had been based on a privately sheltered
  financial position which he had been lucky enough to occupy, and whether he
  would be any less doleful than the rest as soon as the tide of his personal
  ruin began to lap at his own doors. The newspapers, with their chatter of
  rationalisation and improved selling methods, made him feel sick. How the
  devil could he COMPEL customers to buy oil-pumps and water-tube boilers and
  reciprocating engines and all the other things that the firm manufactured?
  And how could he, as an ordinary man, be expected to pick his way amidst such
  pitfalls as frozen credits, depreciated exchanges, high tariffs, and
  defaulting clients?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Really, Parceval,&rdquo; he exclaimed, in the car to Chelmsford,
  &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not enough to be a mere business man in these days.
  You&rsquo;ve damned well got to be a Svengali and a Sherlock Holmes in
  addition.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Parceval laughed. &ldquo;Quite true. Anyone can make things, but it often
  requires genius to sell them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not a genius, and I can&rsquo;t help wishing
  I&rsquo;d been born fifty years ago, when one could do a decent day&rsquo;s
  work and draw a decent day&rsquo;s pay for it without any worries.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come now, Brown, you know you&rsquo;ve never done a decent
  day&rsquo;s work in your life, for all your talk.&rdquo; Parceval laughed
  again; such frankness, but slightly insolent, was a favourite manner of his
  with those whom he need be at no particular pains to conciliate. He went on,
  enjoying himself still more: &ldquo;What you&rsquo;re sighing for is a
  comfortable income without working for it at all, and you&rsquo;re cross
  because the world&rsquo;s beginning to wonder why you should have it.
  You&rsquo;ve got to face facts, my dear chap&mdash;­the easy-going days are
  all over. And that celebrated ancestor of yours would have said
  &lsquo;Hooray&rsquo; to that, I fancy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I often wonder what he would have done in times like
  these.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can tell you. He&rsquo;d have done now what he did
  then&mdash;­adapted himself to the circumstances of the age and made a
  fortune.... Well, here we are&mdash;­this is the spot I&rsquo;ve chosen for
  our young friend to make his hit or miss. And, by the way, I haven&rsquo;t
  arranged it as a public spectacle. There&rsquo;s only you here, myself,
  Mathers, and a few workmen pledged to secrecy. Time enough for the flourish
  of trumpets, if any, later on.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The car pulled into the side of a narrow lane in rather pleasantly rural
  country. Parceval led the way across a few fields to a prettily situated
  sheet of water fringed with tall reeds. Amidst the sudden tranquillity of the
  scene, and under that cloudless October sky, Brown felt happier than he had
  been for days. Perhaps money did not matter so much, after all, so long as
  there were still such things as fields and sunshine. He wondered how much of
  England there was, secret and lovely like this, within a few hundred yards of
  the roads along which he so often motored. He sniffed the warm, hay-scented
  air and felt all his worries relax in almost muscular contentment.</p>

  <p>Presently Mathers joined them and Parceval explained his plans for the
  afternoon&rsquo;s experiment. &ldquo;The plane&rsquo;s taking off from a
  field several miles away; I said we&rsquo;d all be here by three
  o&rsquo;clock. I don&rsquo;t think the fellow will want to waste time.
  He&rsquo;s very keen and plucky. Of course it&rsquo;s a chancy business, but
  if he keeps over the water I think he can&rsquo;t hurt himself much. The
  thing&rsquo;s airtight enough to come to the surface.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>To Brown the waiting, the shimmer of sunlight on the lake, and the
  spaciousness of that unknown countryside, seemed all a part of some very
  strange dream. He could hardly believe he was about to witness an actual and
  perhaps exciting event, and he missed even the approaching aeroplane till his
  attention was drawn to it by Parceval. Then, as he heard it zooming overhead,
  he felt a tense agitation rising in him. Twice the machine made a circuit of
  the lake, while the three principal spectators stared upwards.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll do it soon,&rdquo; said Parceval.</p>

  <p>Brown&rsquo;s heart began to beat more quickly still, and then all at once
  to ache with a peculiar and almost intolerable apprehension. His own son had
  been killed like that&mdash;­pioneering in the air in the early days of
  flying. He called to mind that dreadful day before the War; and then he
  called to mind the eager, smiling face across the table in the French
  train&mdash;­he saw it continually, that smile of such undaunted belief in
  things that Brown was more than a little doubtful about. He thought as he
  stood: &ldquo;We are old men, Parceval, Mathers, and I; and we stay here,
  safe and contemplative, watching that youngster risk his life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Just then something that looked like an elongated drop of quicksilver
  detached itself from the tail of the aeroplane and began to slew round in a
  wide circle. It moved at first too fast for Brown to see anything but its
  shape and colour; but after a few seconds it swooped nearer to the
  water-level and exhibited details of whirring propellers and fins that
  glistened in the sunlight. &ldquo;Like a baby Zepp, by Jove!&rdquo; exclaimed
  Mathers, trying to focus it in his binoculars. Then, in the midst of
  seemingly effortless cruising, it checked its horizontal motion and all at
  once plunged headlong. It was perhaps thirty or forty feet high when that
  happened, and the dive took it just beyond the lake into a swamp at the
  water&rsquo;s edge, where it buried itself nose-foremost with only the
  tail-propeller visible above the reeds.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s get him out!&rdquo; yelled Brown, and began to
  run towards the scene, the others hastening after him. Striding up to his
  knees in mud and water, he kept thinking: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s there, he&rsquo;s
  in that thing&mdash;­it&rsquo;s all my fault&mdash;­it wouldn&rsquo;t have
  happened if I hadn&rsquo;t met him on that train&mdash;­I MUST get him
  out&mdash;­what CAN be happening to him all this time?&rdquo;...</p>

  <p>He and the workmen tore and tugged at the metal monstrosity for nearly a
  quarter of an hour before they finally succeeded in dragging it to firm
  ground. Then they prised open the small entrance door, which had jammed, and
  pulled out a limp and huddled occupant. He was pale and unconscious, though
  not visibly injured.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s an ambulance?&rdquo; Brown cried to Parceval.
  &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you think of having one ready? Damnation, man, tell me
  where I can send to for one....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But there was no need, after all, with the two cars at hand; and in less
  than half an hour the youthful experimenter was being treated quite
  satisfactorily in a nearby hospital.</p>

  <p>That evening Brown, Parceval, and Mathers motored to London and dined at
  Parceval&rsquo;s town house in Belgrave Square. They had already received a
  telephone message from the hospital to the effect that Palescu was suffering
  from no more than shock and very slight concussion, and would doubtless be
  quite well again in a week or so. Brown was mollified and relieved, but still
  rather retrospectively indignant. The good news made room again, too, for his
  own personal anxieties, the more so as Parceval hadn&rsquo;t yet given him
  any answer about the loan.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, Parceval,&rdquo; he said, when the servants had gone out and
  they could talk freely, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;re all glad that the
  boy&rsquo;s all right. He&rsquo;s had a lucky escape, and we&rsquo;re lucky
  too, I should say, in not being partly responsible for a tragedy. As for the
  precious invention he risked his life over, it seems to be exactly what I
  said&mdash;­not of the least practical use.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; Parceval queried. &ldquo;I thought myself it
  wasn&rsquo;t too bad for a pioneer attempt. After all, it didn&rsquo;t drop
  like a stone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Small consolation HOW a man drops if he DOES drop. Personally, I
  don&rsquo;t see how you could ever expect people to trust themselves to such
  a terrifying contraption, even if it were made to work properly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Parceval filled up Brown&rsquo;s glass. &ldquo;Well, I certainly admit
  that Palescu&rsquo;s gyrector doesn&rsquo;t look like having many commercial
  possibilities.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then for heaven&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s encourage the
  fellow to run any more risks with it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Parceval turned to Mathers. &ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mathers agreed with Brown that there should be no more experiments if
  there were definitely nothing practical to hope for from them, which he
  feared was the case. &ldquo;Unless, of course, the idea should be adapted to
  some other sort of use.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Such as?&rdquo; Parceval said quickly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well... perhaps the landing of mails, for instance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see. I was wondering if by any chance you and I had been struck
  by the same notion.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come on, Sir George, let&rsquo;s have it. Your notions are usually
  sound ones.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This may not be a sound one at all. It&rsquo;s completely up in the
  air&mdash;­in more senses than one.&rdquo; Parceval half-smiled, and then
  continued, speaking to Mathers, though it was on Brown that his beady,
  heavy-lidded eyes were turned more frequently. &ldquo;Briefly this. There may
  be, as you hint, other uses besides the one our Roumanian friend seems to
  have thought of. There may even be uses outside the world of commerce
  altogether. Just let me put a hypothetical question. What would have happened
  if that gyrector, as he calls it, had been filled with explosives, and
  instead of coming clown into some soft mud in the middle of Essex had dropped
  from three or four miles high on to the roof of the Bank of
  England?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mathers and Brown spoke instantly and together. Mathers said: &ldquo;I
  don&rsquo;t see anything very new in that&mdash;­the Germans used aerial
  torpedoes in the War, didn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Brown exclaimed: &ldquo;You mean if&mdash;­if it had been filled with
  explosives instead&mdash;­of&mdash;­of having a man inside it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Parceval shook his head to each of them separately and then jointly to
  them both. &ldquo;No. Not at all. I mean explosives and the man. The man to
  steer, of course&mdash;­that&rsquo;s the whole point of the invention. You
  see? You see, Mathers? Hardly something that even the Germans thought of, eh?
  I think you&rsquo;ll admit that it is a rather&mdash;­novel&mdash;­sort of
  idea.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>After a long pause Mathers responded thoughtfully: &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s
  an idea, Sir George. By Jove, yes, it is an idea.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Brown said: &ldquo;Good God, what an appalling notion!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Later, in arm-chairs in the long leathery room which Parceval called the
  library, and with coffee and liqueurs before them, they discussed the matter
  further. Parceval argued that it would be, on the whole, a very humane
  weapon, since it would remove all necessity for promiscuous bombing of
  defenceless cities. The gyrectors would be aimed unerringly at the objects
  they were intended to destroy&mdash;­docks, railways, government buildings,
  and so on&mdash;­not houses, hospitals, or crowded streets.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And though, as you say, Brown, it means certain death for
  the&mdash;­ er&mdash;­the operator, in what way does that introduce any new
  or especially dreadful element into warfare? Isn&rsquo;t it common enough for
  soldiers to face certain death? And it would be instantaneous, remember. No
  suffering, no mutilations, no lingering for days on barbed wire. A clean
  death, you may call it.&rdquo; He paused impressively and lit a cigar. And
  there was, he said, another thing in its favour. It had always seemed to him
  that one of the most terrible features about war was the way it took toll of
  the strongest and most virile among the world&rsquo;s manhood. Wasn&rsquo;t
  it curiously obtuse that the survival of the fittest, nature&rsquo;s harsh
  but salutary law, should be reversed by civilised nations whenever they
  fought in battle? &ldquo;This development I&rsquo;ve been trying to sketch
  out would make for the redressing of that unfortunate balance.&rdquo; He
  spoke suavely, as to a company of invisible shareholders. &ldquo;It would
  give the physically second- rate man a chance to serve his country and
  display heroism no less than the first-rate.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was at this point that certain troubled emotions in Brown, combined
  with the undoubted fact that he had drunk too much, became articulate in the
  guise of a rather macabre whimsicality. &ldquo;Hear, hear,&rdquo; he cried,
  banging his liqueur-glass on the table-top in mock applause. &ldquo;You make
  a damn fine speech, Parceval. Call up the C3s in the next war! And then
  we&rsquo;ll have all the old ladies writing to The Times to complain of the
  number of UN-fit men they see in mufti! But perhaps you&rsquo;d organise your
  suicide club on a voluntary basis? Let &rsquo;em all register in peace-time
  and draw a dole and wear an armlet or something.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, if you MUST joke about a serious matter&mdash;­&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Brown&rsquo;s fingers suddenly snapped the stem of the empty glass he was
  holding, and there was a pause while he muttered an apology and bound his
  thumb, which had been cut slightly. Then he went on, more steadily:
  &ldquo;D&rsquo;you really think, Parceval, and you too, Mathers, that a
  fellow boxed up in a tin coffin is going to spend his last moments caring
  whether what he hits is the right roof or the wrong one?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not? Is it any harder than going over the top? Or than a gun-
  crew trying to register hits even though they know the enemy cruiser is bound
  to blow them to atoms within the next half-hour?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo; Brown&rsquo;s voice sank to a
  whisper, then sharply rose as he added: &ldquo;But, anyhow, I know what
  I&rsquo;D do if you were a brass-hat and I was a Tommy inside one of the
  damned things. I&rsquo;d steer it miles and miles behind the lines till I
  found you and then chase you with it!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Parceval smiled quite tranquilly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a humourist, Brown,
  I can see. But the fact remains&mdash;­and in this I&rsquo;m quite serious,
  even if you aren&rsquo;t&mdash;­that we have here something that may have
  possibilities. MAY&mdash;­I won&rsquo;t say more than that. What we saw this
  afternoon was, of course, little better than a fiasco, yet&mdash;­&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to have that fellow risking his neck again,
  surely?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Parceval&rsquo;s voice cut suddenly icy. &ldquo;Not HIM, Brown, I promise
  you that. Perhaps somebody else whom you&rsquo;ve never met and aren&rsquo;t
  likely to worry about. You&rsquo;re only a sentimentalist, you
  know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;WHAT?&rdquo; It was certainly the last accusation Brown would ever
  have levelled against himself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A sentimentalist, I said. You&rsquo;re also quite drunk, and your
  thumb&rsquo;s still bleeding, by the way.... Now listen to me. This invention
  may or may not be capable of the adaptation I have outlined. The chance,
  however, seems to me worth taking. What I propose is that we&mdash;­the three
  of us&mdash;­should form ourselves into a small syndicate for its
  development. You, Mathers, with your motor-factory, would be a great
  help&mdash;­that is, of course, if the venture appeals to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It does, Sir George. Decidedly, it does.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good! But it isn&rsquo;t all quite plain sailing yet. First of all,
  we must buy out Palescu&rsquo;s rights. We want to be absolutely fair to the
  young man, but at the same time we must protect ourselves, and it will be
  equitable, I take it, if we bid for what he has offered us&mdash;­namely, the
  rights of his invention as a means of landing passengers from aeroplanes. Any
  other value it may subsequently acquire as a result of OUR efforts will
  clearly have nothing to do with him at all&mdash;­which is why we must
  negotiate cautiously. I know what inventors are like&mdash;­I&rsquo;ve had
  experience of them before now. Once our charming young friend suspects that
  the War Departments of the world may be interested in him, he&rsquo;ll begin
  to fancy himself a Hiram Maxim right away. Nevertheless, as I said, we must
  be scrupulously fair. What would you suggest, Brown, as a rough estimate of
  the COMMERCIAL value of the invention?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you damned before I have anything to do with the
  business at all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Parceval&rsquo;s lips tightened. &ldquo;Very well. Then it rests between
  me and Mathers. I&rsquo;m sorry you feel inclined to miss the boat in this
  affair, Brown. I should have thought you&rsquo;d have been rather glad of a
  chance to make a little spare cash just now. However&mdash;­&rdquo; He paused
  meaningfully, and then continued: &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t see why you
  need be so cantankerous about it, anyway. There&rsquo;s no particular reason
  why you should join us if you don&rsquo;t want to&mdash;­I merely offered you
  the chance because it was through you that I got into touch with Palescu, and
  also because I wanted to put something good in your way. I can&rsquo;t think
  why you should be so bad-tempered about it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Neither could Brown. He could not have explained, at that moment, exactly
  what was causing his mood of quite hellish exasperation. Was it the
  cumulative effect of losing money, of becoming steadily poorer and poorer for
  ten years? Was it the combine&rsquo;s recently issued balance-sheet, which
  had seemed more puzzling the oftener he sought to interpret it? Was it
  Parceval, whom he had never liked, but who had never before stirred him to
  such a pitch of mental and temperamental soreness? It was hardly likely to be
  any scruples as to the ethics of manufacturing war material, since Brown and
  Company had been doing this for years whenever they got the chance. Nor could
  it be the prospect of a sharp deal with Palescu, for Brown had learned by
  sufficient experience that if you did not outwit inventors they would
  joyfully outwit you. None of these reasons separately could account for his
  feeling, and yet all of them together might have induced it, plus something
  else that was vaguer and hardly analysable&mdash;­just a general awareness
  that the world was rotten, hopeless, something to hold one&rsquo;s nose over
  while one made a business of scrabbling in the muck in search of... well,
  what? Money?</p>

  <p>And at that point Brown found himself yielding a bemused attention to
  Parceval&rsquo;s eloquence as he described the possible success of the new
  enterprise. Profits&mdash;­fabulous and unbogus, mystic entities that had
  become almost as rare in the business world as strawberries in
  January&mdash;­dividends by the hundred per cent, orders that would reopen
  workshops, concessions that would entice a trickle of gold from all the
  corners of the earth. Rottenness festering in the sun and producing, for a
  few who were lucky enough, this precious yellow flower. A world that could
  refuse to buy such things as water-tube boilers and articulated compounds,
  yet could not, because it dare not, decline the purchase of a new weapon of
  self-destruction. The supreme, the Midas lure&mdash;­something for which no
  government would ever hesitate to tax, to starve, and to pawn. Helpless,
  hopeless... and yet, what could one do?</p>

  <p>His mood, as transient as it was instinctive, had moved him to an effort
  of imagination which his natural indolence soon began to repel; after all, he
  reflected, a moment or two later, perhaps he HAD been rather foolishly
  snappish with a man who had only been trying to help him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come in with you,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;if
  you&rsquo;ll give Palescu five thousand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Five thousand? My dear Brown, I&rsquo;m delighted that you&rsquo;ve
  changed your mind, but really&mdash;­five thousand! Remember what it is
  we&rsquo;re paying for&mdash;­merely the commercial value of something that
  hasn&rsquo;t really a commercial value at all!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Brown retorted, with a last despairing petulance: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
  care about that. You&rsquo;ve been talking about possible hundreds of
  thousands for us. Surely five isn&rsquo;t too much for him. He&rsquo;s
  young&mdash;­he can do with it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We can all do with it, for that matter. But the chief objection is
  that any such large offer would immediately put the fellow on his
  guard&mdash;­don&rsquo;t you see? Still, though it&rsquo;s a risk, I&rsquo;ll
  double the sum I had originally in mind and say a thousand. I call that
  generous, and so, I think, will Palescu. And we must have our interview with
  him as soon as possible. You&rsquo;ll join us then, and you agree to a
  thousand as an outside offer?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, all right, have it your own way,&rdquo; answered Brown, as he
  had answered once before. He was suddenly tired, and with his tiredness there
  came a faint renewal of optimism, the drug to which he was accustomed.</p>

  <p>By the time the three negotiators met the Roumanian a few days later,
  Brown was once again in a mood to see most things cheerfully. Parceval had
  definitely promised him the loan as soon as the Palescu business was settled;
  the bank had agreed to a short delay in repayment; and Parceval, too, had
  been assiduous in kindling hopes for the future. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind
  admitting, Brown, that you can be a great help to me in my negotiations with
  the fellow.&rdquo; (It was already &ldquo;me&rdquo; and &ldquo;my&rdquo;, but
  that, after all, was only to have been expected.) &ldquo;In fact, if you
  hadn&rsquo;t joined in with us, I fear he would have thought it so peculiar
  that we might have had trouble in coming to terms at all. I&rsquo;ll do the
  talking, of course, but you&rsquo;ll be there as
  a&mdash;­a&mdash;­&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As a guarantee of good faith?&rdquo; suggested Brown, not very
  tactfully, and Parceval laughed and replied: &ldquo;Well, if you put it that
  way, perhaps yes. You see, he likes you&mdash;­more than he does me or
  Mathers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He LIKES me?&rdquo; echoed Brown, with sudden shyness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;­seems to have taken quite a fancy to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Brown blushed with happiness. To be liked by this youth seemed somehow
  more satisfying than to have won the favour of any woman.</p>

  <p>They all met Palescu at an hotel in Bloomsbury where he was staying, and
  the youth&rsquo;s welcoming smile made Brown feel that the interview was
  probably going to be a very pleasant one for everybody. He hoped so; he would
  enjoy it if it were; and, in fact, mightn&rsquo;t it actually represent the
  beginning of a new era of prosperity for himself, for his wife and daughter,
  for the workpeople at his factory, for the firm&rsquo;s shareholders, and, of
  course, for Palescu too? A thousand pounds, as Parceval had said,
  wasn&rsquo;t so bad. &ldquo;You all right now?&rdquo; he began, admiring, as
  he had done first of all in the train, the boy&rsquo;s extraordinary good
  looks. &ldquo;Feeling quite fit again? That&rsquo;s good. We&rsquo;re all
  going to go out and dine somewhere, I think.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Parceval and Mathers subjoined their enquiries and felicitations; then
  they hustled into a taxi and drove to the Café Royal. Parceval&rsquo;s
  choice; and it reminded Brown of the old days, when he and his son had
  enjoyed themselves in London together; the Café was the place they had gone
  to, often enough&mdash;­no, not really often enough&mdash;­that was the
  point. That flying smash had happened so abruptly, cutting into the life of
  the father no less than of the son&mdash;­making everything ever afterwards a
  little vague and unfinished. ... He had the queer feeling now that a part of
  him was living over again in that twenty-year-old past, and that Palescu,
  smiling and chattering, was something more to him than a foreign stranger met
  for only the second time.</p>

  <p>During the meal conversation, at Parceval&rsquo;s previous suggestion, was
  kept on general topics; and Brown felt that Palescu was avoiding no less
  carefully the subject which must be uppermost in his mind, as in theirs too.
  The youth talked quite amusingly, though, and kept appealing particularly to
  Brown, as if he, among them all, were an especial friend. Brown warmed to
  such an attitude, and was in a pleasantly flattered mood when at last he lit
  Palescu&rsquo;s cigarette and then his own cigar.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Parceval said at length, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re all
  delighted to find you none the worse for what happened last week. And now, as
  perhaps you&rsquo;ve already guessed, we&rsquo;re ready for a chat about one
  or two matters arising out of that little adventure.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Palescu nodded, smiling at them all, but especially at Brown.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Parceval resumed, &ldquo;we realise, as you must
  do also, that the demonstration you gave was hardly a complete success. We
  were naturally a little disappointed....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And so it went on. Parceval was at his suavest, mellifluously and
  deprecatingly reasonable. But somehow, Brown sensed, Palescu was seeing
  through the reasonableness&mdash;­not, of course, to any accurate perception
  of what lay behind it, but with a sufficient clairvoyance of the need for
  wariness. The smile faded a little from his face; he became alert, tense,
  unmoving. He kept nodding, saying &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and
  waiting for Parceval to go on speaking&mdash;­ perhaps hoping he would give
  himself away. Parceval was naturally in no danger of doing that. But the
  youth&rsquo;s attitude could not but disconcert him a little; he had thought
  it would be fairly easy to come to terms. Several times, like two
  chess-players gradually becoming conscious of each other&rsquo;s ability,
  they fell into a mutually baffled silence, and during one of these intervals
  Brown interjected, not very sensibly, he was aware, but with some idea of
  relieving his own private tension: &ldquo;Jolly plucky to try out the thing
  at all, anyway. Damned uncomfortable to be stuck in the mud like that, I
  should think.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, damned uncomfortable,&rdquo; answered the youth, with a
  mocking but somehow friendly smile. Then he turned to Parceval and the
  contest of wits was continued.</p>

  <p>At last Parceval got as far as saying: &ldquo;Still, you mustn&rsquo;t
  feel that we regret having interested ourselves in you. What are your plans
  for the future?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. It depends on several things.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you propose to carry on with your invention&mdash;­I mean, do
  you intend to try to bring it to some degree of success?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Palescu answered: &ldquo;I consider I have already done THAT.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was something cold and a little contemptuous in the retort that gave
  Brown a tiny thrill of admiration. How tepid and occasional, he reflected,
  was his own impatience of Parceval in comparison! He said: &ldquo;Quite
  right, my boy, you haven&rsquo;t done so badly&rdquo;&mdash;­and felt
  marvellously indifferent to the cautionary glare with which Parceval favoured
  him.</p>

  <p>Parceval, however, made haste to agree. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, of
  course, as Brown says. Please don&rsquo;t misunderstand me. You&rsquo;ve hit
  on an interesting idea&mdash;­interesting, certainly&mdash;­I don&rsquo;t
  think anyone could deny that. And you&rsquo;ve also put a good deal of work
  into it, and even if it hasn&rsquo;t done all that we hoped, it
  might&mdash;­sometime&mdash;­ give someone else an inspiration that might
  possibly be of use. To be quite frank, I and my friends here are prepared
  to&mdash;­well, in a sense, to gamble on that slender chance. To the extent
  of a small sum, I mean. We wouldn&rsquo;t object to paying you&mdash;­oh, say
  five hundred pounds&mdash;­for the full rights.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you wish to buy,&rdquo; answered Palescu very calmly, &ldquo;my
  price is ten thousand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Parceval leaned back in his chair with an elaborately forced smile.
  &ldquo;Utterly ridiculous! We&rsquo;re wasting our time, then, if you really
  mean that. I&rsquo;m sorry, personally, for it would have given me pleasure
  to think that you were making a little profit, but of
  course&mdash;­&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mathers gave Palescu a shrewd and not unkindly glance. &ldquo;Take my tip
  and don&rsquo;t overreach yourself,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;If you really
  don&rsquo;t want to sell, all right, but if you&rsquo;re merely in a
  bargaining mood you might as well bid for the moon as try to put it over a
  business man like Sir George here, or myself.&rdquo; He added, by way of
  polite afterthought: &ldquo;Or Brown.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Palescu smiled. &ldquo;You Englishmen are no doubt the cleverest men in
  the world.&rdquo; He glanced at Parceval and then at Brown, and Brown knew
  suddenly, with a further thrill, that the youth not only disliked Parceval
  but knew that he, Brown, disliked him too.</p>

  <p>Finally, over an hour later, a compromise was reached at six thousand five
  hundred. While Parceval was writing the cheque, Brown occupied the silence by
  chattering: &ldquo;When my son was your age&mdash;­he&rsquo;s dead
  now&mdash;­he was rather like you in some ways&mdash;­having bright ideas and
  risking his life over them. In the end he lost his life. Flying,
  yes&mdash;­twenty years ago, in the pioneer days. ...&rdquo; But Palescu was
  hardly listening; he was prudently reading through the document that Parceval
  had handed him to sign.</p>

  <p>With the transaction complete, the general tension dissolved into a more
  festive atmosphere. Brown called for a celebratory bottle of champagne, and
  there was much more drinking and chattering before the party separated. Brown
  was the liveliest of the four. He was quite boyishly elated, and when he bade
  goodbye to the Roumanian on the pavement outside, he shook hands with much
  fervour. &ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;re ever in England again you must let me
  know,&rdquo; he said. He could not, at that stupid moment of farewell, think
  of anything warmer to say, though he felt it; and with a fussy little gesture
  he searched in his pocket and reciprocated Palescu&rsquo;s first
  intimacy&mdash;­a visiting-card.</p>

  <p>A few days later, as he motored to Liverpool through the pleasant Cheshire
  countryside, he was still free from all misgiving. Parceval had lent him the
  necessary money, and he had had quite a cheery interview at the bank on the
  previous day. Moreover, his wife and daughter were due to arrive on the
  Berengaria during the late afternoon, and he was warmly looking forward to
  meeting them.</p>

  <p>A lovely blue-golden day, with the fields and villages shining with
  autumn. Just the time for welcome and home-coming.</p>

  <p>When, towards sunset, he stood on the landing-stage smoking a cigar and
  watching the liner curve importantly into the estuary, his heart pulsed
  happily within him. Wife, girl, money, the future&mdash;­ everything looked
  all right again. He found it easy to think so, and that the world, after his
  recent bad dreams about it, wasn&rsquo;t really so bad. Even Parceval
  wasn&rsquo;t. He didn&rsquo;t care for the man a great deal, but he had to
  admit he was a smart fellow.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap4"
     id="chap4">CHAPTER FOUR. &mdash; SYLVIA SEYDEL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The club-house at Santa Katerina followed the Amerind
  tradition of pink adobe; it stood on the edge of a cliff, overlooking the
  milk-blue Pacific, and from the long, round-arched sun-balcony the
  millionaires&rsquo; yachts and speed-boats could be observed in all their
  toy-like diversions. On the landward side a path led along a steep arroyo
  through eucalyptus woods to a Greek temple and a so-called natarium, both of
  white marble and designed in the classic Ionic style. The whole estate, which
  included an eighteen-hole golf-course and a bathing beach by the sea and
  tennis-courts and a landing-ground for aeroplanes, belonged to an exclusive
  and expensive country club which in the spring of 1929 had exuded dollars,
  both corporately and individually; and the result, after commissioning an
  architect of genius, was principally the club- house. It rose up like some
  fantastic dream-palace amidst the white yucca blossom, at sunset rosy-red and
  rather unbelievable against the background of sky and hills. That, of course,
  was if one approached it from the sea. From the land, however, it displayed a
  peculiarity; part of the central block, to some extent obscured by trees, was
  still unfinished, so that a gap of naked steelwork intervened between the two
  ten-storey wings. This gap was a legacy of the Wall Street crash in the
  autumn of 1929, and the consequent discovery that even the purses of
  film-magnates and realtors were not quite bottomless.</p>

  <p>But, even so, the club-house at Santa Katerina stood for the peak
  achievement of a civilisation; or perhaps for a ripeness which by the summer
  of 1931 had turned to over-ripeness. There had been rumblings and mutterings
  from afar, recorded on that seismograph of calamity, the ticker-tape; for
  instance, Sylvia Seydel, the movie-actress, was supposed to have dropped a
  million dollars in General Motors stock. So much was probably no more than
  she had earned during the past two years, but she was over thirty now;
  salaries were being cut; younger rivals were coming along; the future was
  less reckonable than had seemed likely. Still, as she walked from the
  club-house to the natarium on a perfect June afternoon, an observer would not
  have sensed her misgivings. That little procession&mdash;­the film-star with
  her retinue of friends, secretaries, and miscellaneous
  hangers-on&mdash;­approached the swimming-pool through the heavily scented
  woods, splitting the sunshine as it fell in slabs across the path, and
  stirring the green dusk with their talk and laughter. But there was another
  sound, a murmur that swelled into a roar as they reached the sun-drenched
  colonnade; voices threaded into pattern by the ribbon-melody of jazz; Santa
  Katerina en fête for a water-party. Sylvia had seen such spectacles many
  times before&mdash;­far too often for her to be impressed particularly on
  this occasion; yet it was, in fact, a scene of almost breath-taking
  loveliness. The architect who had chosen just that spot for a swimming-pool,
  and had made his employers pay for white Carrara marble, had shown mystic
  insight; there was a pagan rapture in the poise of the slim columns reflected
  lambently in the water; to be alone there, at midnight under a high moon,
  would have put one amid the ghosts of dead Hellas. Yet to be there in the
  throng that afternoon was more&mdash;­it was perhaps to see Hellas come to
  life again.</p>

  <p>Never, it might be, for two and a quarter millenniums, since the days of
  Pericles and Plato, had there been such efflorescence of form and colour.
  Less than a thousand persons, men and women, but hardly any children, were
  clustered around the blue-green pool. Most were in brilliant-hued
  swimming-suits; some of the girls wore coloured frocks and wide-brimmed hats;
  a few of the men were robed in silk gowns of exotic design; but all, when the
  screen-star stepped into view, seemed to hold, for that extra moment, a
  position they had reached in some magical and impromptu ballet. There was a
  burst of cheering. Two men in immaculate cream flannels made some little
  purring speech that was lost in the general chatter; the saxophones blared;
  Sylvia was led to a basket-chair on the marble dais. She smiled&mdash;­her
  well-advertised, million-dollar smile. An enormous pink and blue umbrella,
  like the roof of a pagoda, was hoisted over her; she threw out more
  individual smiles here and there, as she caught sight of friends; she laughed
  and gossiped to her neighbours on either side, while the programme was
  volleyed out by massed microphones. Swimming, trick-diving, water-polo,
  <i>etc</i>....</p>

  <p>Throughout the long slow-dying afternoon it continued, a golden pantomime
  reigned over by the sun. It was the sun that gave prismatic harmony to the
  crudely mingled colours; its strong slanting blaze filled the air, absorbed
  the rhythms of the jazz band into a single pattern of sight and sound;
  kindled the splashes made by the divers till the air was full of trembling
  rainbows. One had the feeling that the sun, as on ancient Attic hills, was
  ripening its children as they lay there, half naked under its rays.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, indeed, even Ancient Greece could not have shown such profusion
  of physical beauty. That group of living humanity might have been a
  eugenist&rsquo;s dream of what all mankind could achieve, were it to allow
  itself to be bred for half a dozen centuries as rigidly as horseflesh. The
  women with their laughing oval faces and gleaming teeth, the men of massive
  thigh and torso, the young girls with their bud-like breasts and exquisite
  apricot legs&mdash;­had there ever in all history been such a triumphant
  assembling of the body? For the world had been ransacked for these people;
  or, rather, they had drained into this paradise by every trickle of human
  migration. Tall blondes from Sweden and Finland, brunettes from Spain and the
  Argentine, dago litheness and Siegfried magnificence&mdash;­all were merged
  here by the common desire to capitalise their excellences into earnings. They
  stared at one another with frankly physical appraisement, displaying their
  own personal charms as shamelessly as an applewoman displays ripe apples.
  Even the water-contests were valued less for their own sake than as an excuse
  for physical exhibitionism; it was the ritual of gaily-coloured silks,
  scented ointments, and sprawling sun-baskings that mattered most. Certainly
  none of the various diving competitions and polo-matches stirred as much
  excitement as the item that came last of all&mdash;­the fin fleur of this
  Henry Ford Hellenism&mdash;­a beauty show for men.</p>

  <p>Sylvia Seydel was cast for the role of adjudicator in this culminating
  affair. The competitors, most of them fresh from their water-games, paraded
  before her, smiling with that touch of harlotry that is in all athletic
  prowess; sun-bronzed and superb, they posed like kings&mdash;­kings under a
  matriarchy. Not all were film-actors, by any means; some were camera-men,
  servants, job-seekers, nondescript vivandieres in Hollywood&rsquo;s
  international army. In this inverted world it was the man, as often as the
  woman, whose looks could break down social barriers and unlock the doors to
  innumerable pleasaunces; and that he knew this was in every posturing, from
  the stiff games-master slouch of the public-school Britisher to the strutting
  pertness of the Italian chauffeur.</p>

  <p>Sylvia, three times married and twice divorced, would have been
  sufficiently equipped for the task in any case; but after ten years of film-
  work, five of which had been a rough-and-tumble fight for any job that came
  along, she was something of an expert; she knew a man&rsquo;s points as a
  trainer knows those of racehorses. She had, moreover, the skilled camera eye;
  she saw that this face, though handsome enough, would photograph badly from a
  side-position, or that those well-muscled flanks, though finely virile, were
  too short for elegance in evening clothes. She scrutinised with dispassionate
  intentness&mdash;­the whole thing was only a sort of &ldquo;rag,&rdquo; no
  doubt, but she did not see why, since she had to pick a winner, her choice
  should not be justifiable. But when two-thirds of the procession had passed,
  there came a competitor who left her in no remaining doubt at all; whatever
  else the rest might show, he was her man.</p>

  <p>He was very young, and offered no impressively masculine display of sinew;
  his arms and legs suggested Pan-like grace rather than strength; and his
  glance, as she appraised him, had in it a touch of mockery. She had not
  noticed him in any of the water-games, but he wore a cerise-coloured
  swimming-suit that contrasted quaintly with his brown limbs. His eyes were
  almost violet in their depths, and his lips and straight nose might have been
  copied from the Greek statues that adorned the garden temple. She guessed him
  to be Spanish or Italian, and she was surprised when, as she placed the
  chaplet of laurel on his head amidst thunderous applause, he made her a
  pretty little speech in English that had a rather English accent. Who was he?
  she wondered idly; but she did not trouble to enquire. She was a busy woman;
  she met so many men whose names and identities were of no consequence to her;
  she was more than a little worried, too, about other matters. Indeed, during
  most of that blazing afternoon at the water-party, she had been turning over
  in mind the problem of whether to accept her broker&rsquo;s advice and sell
  for twenty-three dollars the Montgomery Ward stock that she had bought
  originally for a hundred and thirty-seven.</p>

  <p>But the next morning she found out who he was, for on the front page of
  the newspaper she read, in huge block-letter headlines: &ldquo;Lois
  Palmer&rsquo;s Secretary Judged Handsomest Man. Laurels for Roumanian Prince.
  Sylvia Seydel&rsquo;s Choice at Santa Katerina.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sylvia was furious. The Palmer woman was, of course, only one of a hundred
  professional rivals, but her age and the rapidity of her recent rise to fame
  had made her, to Sylvia, a symbol of all the vaguely menacing future. Lois
  was twenty-two; her contract with Vox&rsquo;s had already been renewed at
  some fantastically increased figure; her fan-mail was reckoned to be bounding
  up by hundreds a week. It was exasperating to Sylvia to think that her own
  unwitting action should have presented Lois with free publicity in every
  newspaper in America. Two years ago, Sylvia could have laughed at such a
  thing, could even have congratulated the scorer of such an amusing point. But
  the Sylvia of 1931 was less inclined to laugh. Her world had changed; she
  could feel it, without altogether understanding how or why. It was as if she
  were on a throne that might topple at any moment; and her arrogance before
  the big film-magnates became more and more consciously an effort as each time
  she wondered if they might suddenly decide to call her bluff. That last
  picture, &ldquo;Her Husband&rsquo;s Wife,&rdquo; had done well enough, yet
  somehow not quite as well as had been hoped, and for the moment she was not
  engaged on any picture at all, though there was talk of another. Moreover,
  her high-figure contract expired six weeks hence.</p>

  <p>She called up her publicity agent immediately after breakfast. He was a
  shrewd little Scotsman with bright ideas that were never above
  anybody&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s put it over you all
  right,&rdquo; he sang out quite cheerfully over the wire from Los Angeles.
  &ldquo;But of course she couldn&rsquo;t have counted on you picking out the
  fellow. All she did was to seize the chance that you gave her
  yourself&mdash;­you can&rsquo;t blame her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not blaming her,&rdquo; Sylvia retorted, &ldquo;but that
  doesn&rsquo;t mend matters. Look here, I want you to find out about this
  Roumanian prince&mdash;­find out all you can about him, will you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He said he would.</p>

  <p>A fortnight later Sylvia was taking tea in her private suite on the tenth
  floor of the Santa Katerina clubhouse. She owned a fabulous palace at
  Beverley Hills, but she usually preferred Santa Katerina when she was not
  working on a picture. It was another of those flaming days of the Californian
  June, and through the open windows across the balcony rail the Pacific shone
  a deep turquoise blue. She had just signed over a hundred postcard
  photographs that were to be sent off by her secretary to admirers all over
  the world, when her maid entered with a card on which was inscribed
  &ldquo;Prince Nicholas Petcheni,&rdquo; with an address in Los Angeles.
  &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll see him,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>He entered, and watching him from her chair, she observed that his walk
  and clothes were fittingly exquisite. She did not trouble, then, to study his
  face, for she had already done that; but when he stooped to touch her fingers
  with his lips she noticed his dark, slightly curling hair and the absolute
  symmetry of his head. &ldquo;This is indeed a charming sequel to our last
  meeting, Miss Seydel,&rdquo; he began, smiling.</p>

  <p>Yes, she thought, he was damned good-looking enough for anything; almost
  absurd, really, the way everything was RIGHT about him.... &ldquo;Do sit
  down, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll take
  tea?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He thanked her, and during the course of that dainty little ceremony he
  talked of the weather, of how much he liked America, of his interest in the
  film-industry, and his desire to study it at close quarters by actually
  working at Hollywood, and of his admiration for Santa Katerina above all
  other places. With a quick-witted tact which Sylvia could not help but
  admire, he did not mention the name of his employer. His chatter was amusing,
  and he knew English so perfectly that it was natural for her to compliment
  him on it. &ldquo;But then, I have been in England a good deal,&rdquo; he
  answered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yet you still have your home in Roumania?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo; He sighed slightly. &ldquo;Things are not what they
  were, though. The&mdash;­the&mdash;­crise mondiale&mdash;­what do you call
  it?&mdash;­the world-crisis?&mdash;­has hit my country very hard. My family
  have lost much money. We of the younger generation must look to the future,
  not to the past. That is why I have come here, where everything points so
  surely ahead.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sylvia was by no means certain that everything in her own life was
  pointing surely ahead, but she nodded. &ldquo;I suppose your family is a very
  old one?&rdquo; she remarked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not so old as some in my country, though my ancestors were ruling
  their provinces when America was still undiscovered. But what does all that
  matter now?&rdquo; He shrugged his shoulders expressively. &ldquo;In America
  it is of to-morrow that one thinks, not of yesterday. And, for myself, I must
  say that I prefer the attitude. It is more hopeful, more
  democratic.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All the same, as a prince, you must have been rather surprised to
  receive an invitation from a mere commoner like myself to call and see her?
  Didn&rsquo;t you think that was a little TOO democratic?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He smiled pleasantly. &ldquo;Not at all. I was surprised, it is true, but
  I was also delighted. What prince would not be honoured by a command from a
  queen?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You turn your compliments very prettily, but I think it&rsquo;s
  time to put an end to the farce. I&rsquo;ve caused enquiries to be made about
  you, and I known perfectly well that you aren&rsquo;t a prince at all. Your
  name is Palescu, and you were in Paris last year trying to sell an invention.
  We aren&rsquo;t all such fools over here as you seem to think, monsieur, or
  mein Herr, or whatever it ought to be.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He suddenly laughed, and she felt a pang of almost fearful admiration when
  she noticed that he showed not a trace of embarrassment. Indeed, his
  attitude, if anything, was even easier when he replied: &ldquo;I perceive, at
  least, that you are not a fool, Miss Seydel. But, since you wish to call me
  by my real name, shall I not return the compliment and call you Mrs.
  Schmidt?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll perhaps be in time to do so if you hurry,&rdquo; she
  retorted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m expecting my divorce at any moment.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He laughed again. &ldquo;I think you are really a very clever
  woman.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cleverer than Lois Palmer, I suppose you mean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, with meaning in his eyes. &ldquo;Yes, far
  cleverer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then what if I tell her the truth? What if I tell
  everybody?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing, except that I shall laugh. I don&rsquo;t mind. It&rsquo;s
  all been pretty good fun.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; she said, intently. &ldquo;I work it out like
  this. If I give you away, the laugh is against Lois, for being taken in, and
  against you, for being found out. But if you were to leave her employment and
  come to me, the laugh would only be against her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you want the laugh to be against her, Miss Seydel?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t object.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then will you pay me two hundred dollars a week? Miss Palmer gives
  me one-seventy-five.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t afford nearly so much. Besides, as a bogus
  article, you aren&rsquo;t worth it. Come to me for a hundred and twenty, or
  be exposed. Those are my terms.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A hard bargain.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m a hard bargainer. As a matter of fact, I don&rsquo;t
  know that I&rsquo;m not being too generous. What can you do,
  anyway?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Anything you wish. Sing, dance, play the piano, entertain your
  friends, invent publicity for you, answer your letters, create an impression
  on people who matter; also, I can swim, drive a car, fly an aeroplane, play
  most games tolerably well&mdash;­&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Only tolerably? That&rsquo;s disappointing of you, surely?
  Nevertheless, I&rsquo;m willing to take you on at the figure I said. And if
  you&rsquo;ve any sort of contract with Miss Palmer, see my lawyer and
  he&rsquo;ll get you out of it. Can you move over at once?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Within a few days the newspapers were featuring the story of the princely
  Apollo&rsquo;s change of employment. Their reporters interviewed him; he gave
  them drinks, an amusing half-hour, and&mdash;­ what was most of
  all&mdash;­perfectly good copy which they did not need to embellish for
  themselves. His most quoted remark was that at last, in his new job, he had
  made contact with all that was most promising in the art of the cinema, and
  Miss Seydel was naturally pleased. Not only was the publicity good, but
  Nicky, as she called him, proved an immediate success in many other ways. At
  her parties his immaculate clothes and accent, as well as his extraordinary
  facility in saying things that were considered clever (sometimes they really
  were clever), made her, she felt, the envy of every other actress in the
  film- world. He was such a brilliant improviser on any given theme, and quite
  the most consummate liar she had ever met. He had to lie, doubtless, to
  sustain his reputation as a person of rank and pedigree; but his technique in
  doing so was a little awe-inspiring as well as unnecessary at times; he
  invented, for instance, a whole family for himself&mdash;­ father, mother,
  brothers, uncles, all of them fantastically titled; and the strange thing was
  that even Sylvia, who knew them to be spoof, found herself accepting them at
  least as readily as the characters in some rather well-written novel. Once,
  in the midst of a very amusing family saga with which he was enthralling her
  guests, she interjected suddenly: &ldquo;Of course, Nicky, I don&rsquo;t
  really believe you&rsquo;re a prince at all. You&rsquo;re much too good a
  talker.&rdquo; Which everyone seemed to think a very daring sally.</p>

  <p>It was at the same party that a very gushing lady asked him: &ldquo;Oh,
  yer Highness, would you ever be willing to marry morganatically?&rdquo;
  Instantly, with a little bow across the table to her, he replied:
  &ldquo;Certainly, madam&mdash;­and Pierpont Morganatically too, if I
  could.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Afterwards, when the guests had gone, Sylvia congratulated him on a
  witticism which would doubtless go the usual rounds. He smiled and answered:
  &ldquo;But what on earth made you say that you didn&rsquo;t believe I was a
  prince at all?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Merely an insurance premium, Nicky. If anyone finds you out, or if
  you leave me and I have to get my own back, I shall then be able to call
  witnesses that I suspected you all along.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Clever of you, Sylvia.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not so very&mdash;­only just a bit wise. Fetch me a drink.
  I&rsquo;m tired.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He could, in addition to his numerous other accomplishments, invent and
  mix the most satisfying potions. She looked at him over the rim of the glass
  a moment later and was rather startled to reflect how well they were getting
  on together. She had so few illusions about him, or about anyone, for that
  matter. She knew that sooner or later some inquisitive person would look up
  the Almanach de Gotha or something and find out the fiction of his ancestry;
  indeed, she was a little surprised that such a thing hadn&rsquo;t happened
  already. Still, it was being good publicity while it lasted, and it would do
  her no harm, provided she wouldn&rsquo;t be left to look a fool. And apart
  from his status, he was no doubt worth his wages. His company was amusing and
  his talents were useful; and her own experience of three husbands had
  disposed her to think that that was higher praise than could be accorded most
  men.</p>

  <p>Once, sitting at her feet in the bright starshine of her balcony, with the
  beat of the Pacific surf a murmur far below, he gave her a long account of
  the circumstances that had led to his coming to America. &ldquo;You see, I
  was in Russia doing business for my uncle, who was head of a firm of
  engineers in Bukarest. In Moscow I met a young engineer who was dying; he
  gave me plans of an aeroplane invention of his; he wanted me to take them out
  of the country, because otherwise the Soviet people would get hold of them
  and pay nothing at all. I said I would, and I took them first of all to
  Germany, where I actually studied aeronautics to make myself understand the
  business. It was a method of landing from an aeroplane in flight&mdash;­a
  sort of torpedo that you climbed into and steered down to the ground. Mighty
  risky, I thought, but I was hard up, and it looked as if there were just a
  chance of making some money out of it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But of course,&rdquo; she interrupted, &ldquo;nobody was such a
  fool as to give you any.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He laughed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just where you&rsquo;re wrong, Sylvia. A
  good many weren&rsquo;t, but in the end I sold it to three Englishmen. I met
  the first of them, rather a nice chap, in a train in France, and when he got
  to England he must have told two of his friends. One was quite a big
  gun&mdash;­knight or baronet or some kind of title. He was a keen business
  man all right&mdash;­his keenness nearly killed me, in fact. He had me make a
  model of the thing and try it out myself from an aeroplane. It came down
  head- foremost into some mud, and that was nearly the end of me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, my dear Nicky, why ever did you let yourself do it? Surely it
  wasn&rsquo;t worth risking your life for?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I suppose not, but, to tell you the truth, I got so interested
  in it I almost believed in it myself by that time. You see, I&rsquo;d posed
  as the inventor, and in the end I think I must have come to feel as an
  inventor does feel&mdash;­rather proud, you know, and confident.... Do you
  understand?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It would be too much of an effort to try. But go on. What did the
  Englishmen say when you were nearly killed?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They took me out to dinner and said quite a lot&mdash;­too much,
  indeed, if they&rsquo;d only known. For I could see that although they talked
  of the thing as a failure, they were really quite keen on having it. Heaven
  knows why, but, naturally, I wasn&rsquo;t going to object. They offered me
  five hundred pounds, after a lot of chatter&mdash;­if there hadn&rsquo;t been
  that, I might have accepted it. As it was, I bluffed hard and asked for ten
  thousand. We came to terms at last just a little bit more than half-way. Then
  I packed up and came over here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On the proceeds of selling a dud invention to three keen business
  men? You&rsquo;re a genius, Nicky. Have you still got the money?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I lost half of it right away on Wall Street.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not such a genius, then, after all. No cleverer than the rest of
  us, in fact.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, but it won&rsquo;t happen again like that. One can do anything
  once&mdash;­there&rsquo;s no blame in a first time. But if one does anything
  more than once, then in my opinion it ought to be the devil of a fine thing
  to do.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How old are you, Nicky?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Twenty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t believe you.&rdquo; She began to laugh.
  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really believe anything you&rsquo;ve been saying. Well,
  perhaps not more than half, anyhow. You&rsquo;re such an extraordinary
  liar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you mind?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not a bit. So long as you continue to be so much more agreeable
  than most people who tell the truth, I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What DO you care about?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not very much.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thought not,&rdquo; he answered meditatively. &ldquo;Very
  sensible, no doubt, but I wonder if it&rsquo;s altogether the right attitude
  for you? I went to see your last picture the other day and I wondered what it
  was that just missed fire. Now I know.... Sylvia Seydel with the
  million-dollar smile and the don&rsquo;t-care eyes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re suggesting that for a publicity slogan, I&rsquo;ll
  consider it. And what is caring, anyway?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should say it&rsquo;s a sort of general excitement that helps one
  to see and hear, not only with the eyes and ears, but with the solar plexus
  as well. This view&mdash;­the sea down there&mdash;­the eucalyptus
  woods&mdash;­those yellow cactus flowers in the moonlight&mdash;­don&rsquo;t
  you feel it just a little bit in your tummy? <i>I</i> do.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Funny creature you are, Nicky!&rdquo; she cried, laughing at him;
  and then added, with a sudden change of voice: &ldquo;As a matter of fact,
  I&rsquo;m tired of it all&mdash;­it is wonderful, I know, but I&rsquo;ve seen
  it for years and years, and it&rsquo;s done nothing but just go on being
  wonderful. You forget that I&rsquo;m thirty, not twenty&mdash;­I want more
  than views and moonlight.&rdquo; She checked herself and went on, forcing
  herself to laugh again: &ldquo;At present, for instance, I want a drink. Do
  go and get me one, or I shall howl.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The truth was, she had begun to be really worried about her future. In a
  sense, of course, she had nothing much to worry about; she was one of the
  half- dozen best-known stars in the world; her name was almost a household
  word; and she was worth at least a million dollars, even after all possible
  losses on stocks. She could retire in six weeks&rsquo; time, when her
  contract expired, and spend the rest of her life in luxurious comfort at Palm
  Beach or on the French Riviera; nor, if she did, would her name fade
  completely from the public memory. She was on the edge of history; she would
  never cease to be&mdash;­&ldquo;Sylvia Seydel&mdash;­don&rsquo;t you
  remember?&mdash;­the girl who was in &lsquo;Home from the Sea&rsquo; and
  &rsquo;Fidelity&rsquo;.&rdquo; From the difficult peak of her profession she
  could look back upon twelve years of such protracted girlhood&mdash;­ever
  since, in her late teens, she had run away from a department store in
  Philadelphia. She had fought her early battles in that rough-and-tumble age
  before the cinema began to give itself airs and a Chaplin première became an
  international event; she had known Hollywood as a small colony less than a
  quarter its present size; she remembered when cultured people still felt they
  had to excuse themselves for being seen at the movies. How people would laugh
  now, if &ldquo;Fidelity&rdquo; were to be revived&mdash;­the picture which,
  in its day, had broken every record and had made Sylvia&rsquo;s the second
  best-known smile in the world! And compare the crude obviousness of
  &ldquo;Home from the Sea&rdquo; with the sophisticated wit and polished
  intricacy of &ldquo;Her Husband&rsquo;s Wife&rdquo;! Marvellous advance in
  less than a decade; and yet, looking back, she could not but feel a halcyon,
  garden- of-Eden quality in those pioneer days. Silent films, then, of course;
  which, by an odd paradox, gave her memories principally of noise&mdash;­of
  producers yelling through megaphones, of creaking floors and clattering
  scenery; you could laugh, whistle, sneeze, or cough without anyone bothering;
  there seemed, in retrospect, a gloriously impromptu freshness about it all.
  And then those mornings setting out at dawn on location work, the whole
  company in open cars like an enormous picnic party; driving forty or fifty
  miles into the San Jacinto mountains; grape-fruit and coffee under the trees
  in some lonely sunburnt valley; then the job of the day, which usually
  involved sheriffs, horses, revolver-shooting, and kisses in almost equal
  proportions. And lastly the drive home in the evening, under the big
  Californian moon, tired and hungry, with everyone laughing and telling yarns.
  ...</p>

  <p>But now the skyscraper offices of the film companies soared upwards to
  tell the world that the cinema was no longer an amusement for children.
  Aesthetic Germans and Russians swarmed everywhere with their chatter of
  &ldquo;montage&rdquo; and &ldquo;values&rdquo;; camera-men no longer had
  Bowery accents and chewed cigars; the vast studios, with their time-clocks
  and their silence rules, were the churches of a new and colder ritual. Not
  that Sylvia particularly disliked the talkies. Her voice and accent were
  acceptable, and she had accommodated herself well enough to the change-over.
  Her feeling was vaguer than dislike, but also less conquerable&mdash;­a
  regret for times that were gone, for triumphs hardly to be repeated.</p>

  <p>She felt sometimes, too, that she had had her day and might better
  abdicate with dignity than be pushed eventually from the throne. The younger
  stars, brought up in the talky tradition, already counted her a back number;
  and the more famous producers evidently did not consider her worth their
  attention. That was partly the trouble with her last picture; nobody had
  really believed in it, neither the Vox people nor herself. It has been made
  because she was under contract, and because the name &ldquo;Sylvia
  Seydel&rdquo; still had immense drawing power, not because anyone had been
  terribly interested in the job itself. It piqued her a little to find that
  Nicky had diagnosed the deficiency so promptly.</p>

  <p>Well, should she yield her position while the manoeuvre could still be
  performed with grace? Twelve years was a long span; she had done her
  lifework, or served her life-sentence, whichever way one chose to look at it.
  She could leave the future to those who were better equipped to deal with
  it&mdash;­a future, incidentally, which she need hardly envy them. She did
  not particularly study affairs, but she was dimly aware that she had sailed
  to fortune on the crest of a wave, and that her successors must make what
  they could out of the slough. In her private mind she felt quite certain that
  when she met the Vox people after the expiry of her present contract they
  would agree to a renewal only at a very much lower figure. She knew it, and
  was in a way reconciled; yet she knew also that the blow, when it fell, would
  come crushingly and with a revelation of failure. Yet it could be
  forestalled, if she chose, by an announcement of her impending retirement.
  Then there would be farewell parties, speeches in her honour, a last blaze of
  publicity throughout the world, and for ever afterwards&mdash;­not quite
  oblivion.</p>

  <p>All this was in her mind one evening when she and Nicky went to a Chinese
  party at the Statlers. Statler owned an oil-field and was married to a pretty
  Chicagoan who had but recently been a student at Berkeley; there was
  something odd, but not wholly unattractive, in the relationship between the
  rough, almost illiterate man of fifty and the cultured girl in her very early
  twenties. She had sold herself to him, no doubt; but then, too, there was a
  sense in which he had also sold himself to her. He was childishly devoted,
  rather like a fierce wolf-hound that she had tamed; it was amusing to watch
  him going round saying &ldquo;Howdy&rdquo; to all her exquisite friends.
  Sylvia rather liked him, and was by no means put out by his occasionally
  Rabelaisian humours.</p>

  <p>The Statler home had a fantastically lovely garden-roof overlooking the
  sea, and here, since the night was warm and there was a bright moon, the
  party took place. Sylvia was a Manchu princess, Nicky a mandarin&mdash;­not
  especially original of either of them, but their costumes and looks made them
  conspicuous even in a gathering where wealth and beauty were flaunted rather
  than displayed. Statler had been a &ldquo;bear&rdquo; operator on Wall Street
  since the autumn of 1929, and was reputed to have made himself a
  multimillionaire out of the slump; certainly when his wife gave a party his
  cheque-book was always opened wide beforehand. All the servants were genuine
  Chinese, and padded round, as dusk fell, lighting real Chinese lanterns;
  there was an authentic Chinese musician with his yueh-chin, or moon guitar,
  plucking notes that seemed to dissolve into the air as they were sounded; and
  another marvellously-gowned fellow with a drum on which the painted dragons
  looked actually writhing, so strange was the compulsion of movement and
  rhythm. Heaven knew where all these persons and properties had been
  obtained&mdash;­or, rather, Statler&rsquo;s bankers knew. And there was, to
  Sylvia, a curious feeling of unreality and impermanence about it all,
  symbolised by that roof-top islanded above the sea and shore. As the lanterns
  swayed in the breeze, and the surf-smell rose to mingle with that of
  sandalwood incense, she felt suddenly that the whole artifice of the scene,
  with all its beauty, was but a flower of catastrophe; that Statler, standing
  a little apart from his guests, was the chance beneficiary of some vast and
  nearly universal doom. She saw behind the flickering coloured globes and the
  laughing couples the darker pageant of headline news&mdash;­ruined homes and
  bankrupt farms, closed factories, bread lines, apple-sellers on the Fifth
  Avenue kerb. The vision was partly born of her own big losses. Two million
  dollars altogether, she reckoned; it had all gone somewhere, perhaps into an
  abyss from which Statler and his kind had had the magic knack of rescue. It
  half-amused her to think of him as the man who had somehow taken her money.
  He was standing near the guitar-player, slightly absurd in a presumably
  military uniform, and gazing down at the musician with a simplicity nearly as
  inscrutable as the Oriental&rsquo;s. She went over to him and chatted for a
  time; he had a rather pathetic air of being honoured by her attention, and
  she felt comfortingly that at least he belonged to the generation for whom
  Sylvia Seydel was still the greatest name on the screen.</p>

  <p>She knew him well enough to ask, at length: &ldquo;Tell me, Mr. Statler,
  d&rsquo;you think Steel Common are going down any more?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; he answered, with dove-like gentleness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You think I ought to sell, then? I bought mine at a hundred and
  forty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yeah, you sure oughter sell.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You seriously mean that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yeah, I surriously do.&rdquo; After a little pause he went on:
  &ldquo;I dunno your Chinese friend, Miss Seydel. He came up to me a moment
  ago but I guess he don&rsquo;t understand our lingo very well.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She began to laugh. &ldquo;Oh, you mean Nicky&mdash;­he must have been up
  to one of his games! Prince Nicholas Petcheni&rsquo;s his full name, and he
  speaks quite perfect English.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mean to tell me that guy isn&rsquo;t Chink at all?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, of course not. He&rsquo;s a Roumanian.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Acts for the movies, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s my secretary.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, Miss Seydel, all I can say is, you&rsquo;ve gotten a durned
  fine actor as a sekertary. Look at him now....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They both looked. Nicky was dancing with a tall, pale girl who was
  convulsed with laughter, apparently by something he had just said or done.
  But his antics were more than merely laughable. He had, in some extraordinary
  fashion, converted himself into the almost real thing; his chinoiserie was
  more than improvised, it was stylised. From the little tippling movements of
  his feet to the slightly bent shoulders and slanted head, he WAS the
  Celestial; he had even managed to alter the contour of his features, while
  from his lips there came a sharp bubbling treble that was in itself a perfect
  caricature.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sylvia slowly, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s rather good,
  isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She liked to add her own careful and discriminating praise of him to the
  keener enthusiasm of others. In her troubled reckonings and assessments of
  herself and her future, he at least must be counted a triumph; it was
  something, anyhow, to have snatched him away from the Palmer woman and to
  have installed him amongst her own entourage. He was well-known now all round
  the film-colony; he went everywhere, sometimes with her, often with others;
  the women were wild about him, and even among the men he was rather
  surprisingly popular. Probably, she reflected, people were saying that she
  and he were living together. She hardly minded; it was the kind of rumour
  that did a film- star no harm, provided she hadn&rsquo;t always to be put to
  the trouble of substantiating it.</p>

  <p>Sylvia&rsquo;s experience of men had been both considerable and, on the
  whole, unfortunate. Her first husband, whom she had married at seventeen, was
  a production manager in one of the old and now defunct film companies; they
  had had an idyllic honeymoon and a fairly happy year, after which he had
  capriciously thrown up his job to become a realtor in Kansas City. She
  declined to accompany him there, so he left her and found some other woman
  eventually; thus she got her first divorce. This experience made her decide
  that if ever she married again it would be for money, not for love. Three
  years passed, and then one day an exceedingly rich corset-manufacturer from
  New Jersey visited Hollywood, met her, became preposterously amorous, and
  found that her terms were marriage and the continuance of her professional
  work. He agreed, and built a house on Millionaire Drive at Pasadena in token
  of complete submission. He was an Italian of between forty and fifty, with a
  swarm of children accumulated from vaguely complicated previous alliances;
  there were still a houseful of them even after three had been killed in a
  motor-smash. Sylvia disliked most of them intensely and soon came to dislike
  their father too, especially when he insisted on her providing them with
  additional half-brothers and sisters. At last, after many squabblings and
  turbulences, the crisis was reached; she left him, and in due course he
  discovered a state that was willing to give him a divorce for mental cruelty.
  But though matrimonially a failure, she did not count her year with the
  corset-manufacturer a wholly wasted effort. Its results were manifest, even
  if not in the semblance he would himself have preferred; it was his money
  that helped her to establish a social status in the film-world, to say
  nothing of its fruition in the form of the house at Pasadena, and a new
  corset-factory Los Angeles.</p>

  <p>Her next marriage came after her big success, when she was a world-famous
  personage and had a growing fortune of her own. She decided this time that
  she would marry into her own class&mdash;­i.e. a film-actor; and she chose
  Jeremy Baxter (né Schmidt), who was almost as world-famous as herself. She
  did not exactly fall in love with him; rather it might be said that she
  manoeuvred herself, with a little strain, into that condition. She had a hazy
  idea that they might set up a ménage of slightly notorious
  domesticity&mdash;­something, perhaps, after the Pickford-Fairbanks model.
  Unfortunately Jeremy was not the ideal husband even if she had been the ideal
  wife. Her synthetic affection for him did not survive the first night, nor
  her tolerance the first week; she was hardly straitlaced, but after he had
  been involved in a court case over some girl whom he had stripped naked and
  tarred and feathered on a speedway, she thought her lawyers might as well do
  the rest.</p>

  <p>Her third set of divorce papers arrived during those weeks at Santa
  Katerina, those weeks of indecision about her future. &ldquo;There you are,
  Nicky,&rdquo; she said, tossing him the lawyer&rsquo;s letter.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m through with men now, thank God.&rdquo; He laughed and
  stooped to her bare shoulder with his lips. The relationship between them was
  peculiar&mdash;­so peculiar that she decided it must be a part of him, not of
  her, and therefore, like so much else that was his, completely
  incomprehensible. She liked him, and assumed that he must like her too; he
  flirted with her occasionally, and she did not object. She permitted him many
  intimacies which with other men might have been impossible, except at a
  price; their bedrooms were on the same floor, and he wandered in and out at
  all times of the day and night. It wasn&rsquo;t that she had any particular
  faith in his honourable intentions; indeed, she was never quite certain what
  he would do next, or to what fantastic gallantry he might eventually be
  impelled. There was a childlike quality in him which made nonsense of all the
  usual gradations of amorous dalliance; yet she was aware that this quality
  might well be just as bogus as his princeliness. She was not exactly on her
  guard against him, but she was determined never to expect too much or to be
  prepared for too little. Meanwhile, so long as it lasted, she could enjoy his
  company and take whatever he offered that she found acceptable.</p>

  <p>Then, quite suddenly, there was a development. They had gone for a long
  week-end&rsquo;s motor-trip to Monterey, and there, on that extraordinary
  bleak promontory, the languorous south seemed to end up with a shudder; there
  was a hint of foreboding in the darkly waving cypresses and the wind that was
  nearly a gale. Nicky stood for a long time on the cliff-edge, gazing far out
  over the ocean; and it was then, all at once, that the idea approached her in
  the guise of a problem&mdash;­could he really be accused of always posing
  when it was so natural for him to pose? For, in that changed scene, his whole
  attitude was changed; she could see his face in profile against the wind, and
  it was full of a majestic seriousness; his forehead seemed almost to slope
  back more nobly; certainly his lips and nostrils were quivering in new
  contours. &ldquo;Nicky,&rdquo; she cried, astonished, &ldquo;what ARE you
  doing? Come and help me unpack the food.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He turned and walked towards her with slow, deliberate steps. &ldquo;If
  you really want to know what I was doing, Sylvia, I was imagining myself an
  Indian, chased westward by the white man, and coming at last over the
  mountains to this terrific end of the world.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, Nicky, that&rsquo;s amazing&mdash;­you LOOKED like an
  Indian&mdash;­you&rsquo;re still looking like one! If only you had some
  feathers and a blanket...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thus the idea was born. They talked about it all the rest of that day, and
  throughout the next, fanning each other&rsquo;s enthusiasm till they both
  returned to Santa Katerina considerably on fire.</p>

  <p>Sylvia had always been fascinated by Indians. Racial problems of all kinds
  interested her; she had had many friendships with Japanese and Chinese, and
  even to negroes she felt much less than the physical repugnance she found it
  politic to assume. But of all the ethnic types in America, the native red man
  attracted her most and stirred her to the largest measure of sympathy; often,
  seeing them from the train-windows at Albuquerque, Espanola, and other
  stations on the Santa Fé railroad, she had sensed the tragedy of their
  survival into a machine-ridden age, and had wondered why the subject had not
  attracted more attention from writers. In the early days of her career she
  had once gone to New Mexico to make a cowboy film with real Indians in it,
  but they had been rather degenerate specimens, hard drinkers and bad actors.
  That was part of their fate; they were a dumb, stricken race, perishing by
  the bounty of the conqueror no less than formerly by his sword. As Sylvia
  pondered on the theme, it seemed to her that here she had something she had
  never had before&mdash;­the seed of a possibly gigantic picture, one that
  would transcend the usual distinctions between lowbrow and highbrow in an
  appeal that might be universally American. Such a picture must present the
  whole pageant of conquest and subjection, not with any bitterness against the
  conquerors, but in the new spirit of national self-questioning that had been
  so rapidly engendered since 1929. She felt, intuitively, what she could not
  thoroughly expound&mdash;­that the God&rsquo;s-own-country type of American
  had withered under the shock of crumbling markets; and that the 1931 model
  was a charier being, more darkly sceptical and less eager to accept
  statistics of car- loadings as the final touchstone of civilisation.</p>

  <p>It gave Sylvia a keen pleasure to work out details of the picture. She
  decided it must be based on a simple framework&mdash;­the story of an Indian
  family through several generations, beginning with warfare against the
  covered-waggoners and ending with the ignominious semi-captivity of the
  present. Nicky, of course, would take the part of a modern Indian youth,
  proud of his Chinookan or Seminole ancestry, yet toying with the civilisation
  of the invader, going to college, acquiring culture, falling in love with a
  city girl, and finally, to complete the cycle, returning to his own people
  unfitted for happiness in either their state or any other. For that last
  scene she had in mind a constant recollection of an Indian she had once seen
  at Silver City, waiting forlornly at the depot as her train halted&mdash;­a
  tall, lonely figure with blue-black hair and hot, restless eyes, tragi-comic
  in a black suit, linen collar, and patent shoes. But behind the personal
  picture there must always be the background of the ever-westward thrust of
  skyscraper and railroad, the growth of little one-street townships into great
  cities, the absorption stage by stage of the last outposts of the
  Amerind.</p>

  <p>Nicky was no less taken with the idea than she was, but enthusiasm alone
  would not get them far; and as soon as they had settled the preliminary
  details they left Santa Katerina for Beverley Hills, to be nearer the scene
  of action. Sylvia in all this was a new woman, lovelier than ever in her
  eagerness, and she was really very lovely; there was no thought in her mind
  of retirement now; she would stage a magnificent &ldquo;come-back&rdquo; with
  by far the best thing she had ever done; the world would be at her feet
  again. She was sure that, as the American girl in love with the Indian, she
  could act as she had never acted before, quickened emotionally by the
  interest she felt in the problem behind the story. Nor did she now fear the
  day when her contract with Vox&rsquo;s was due to expire. On the contrary, a
  week beforehand she drove up arrogantly in her ten-thousand-dollar
  Pierce-Arrow and interviewed Vox himself. He was a cultured Jew, clever,
  coldly polite, and rather deprecatory on principle. As soon as she had
  sketched out her idea he told her quite definitely that it would never do.
  Nor did her claim to have discovered a new male star rouse him to any degree
  of rapture. Good ideas and good actors, he indicated, were nearly at
  giving-away prices; what a film had to have, in the first place, was a
  reasonable chance of securing the dollar-support of the public. And hers
  hadn&rsquo;t. The public, he declared, took no interest whatever in the
  Indian problem. It was true that Sylvia herself still had a name, but she
  would certainly sacrifice it all if she allowed herself to be featured as an
  American woman mixed up with a coloured man. People simply wouldn&rsquo;t
  stand it; in fact, it might even lead to race-riots and be prohibited.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Pocohontas marry a white man?&rdquo; she
  interrupted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, and &lsquo;Othello&rsquo;s&rsquo; a story about a nigger and a
  white girl,&rdquo; he retorted, &ldquo;but you daren&rsquo;t talk about it in
  the Carolinas.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s an entirely different matter. The Indian is as
  white as the Italian or the Spaniard. He&rsquo;s as white as the Californian
  will be in a few more generations.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dispute it, Miss Seydel,&rdquo; answered Vox, with a
  shrug of the shoulders. &ldquo;But I still tell you, quite candidly, that to
  appear in public in such a picture as you suggest is simply professional
  suicide for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that it need be. After all, why shouldn&rsquo;t
  we be proud of the Indian traditions? They&rsquo;re part of our country. And
  even by white standards, a great many Indians are fine-looking, don&rsquo;t
  you think? As for sex-appeal, if the public wants something new in that
  direction, I can promise it from the young Roumanian I&rsquo;ve got in mind
  to take the chief part.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear Miss Seydel, if it were all a matter of only that, I could
  produce at least a dozen niggers that have more of it than any white man I
  know. And there are plenty of women who&rsquo;d be thrilled by &rsquo;em
  easily enough in the safety of a dollar-seat at the movies. The trouble is
  that we don&rsquo;t want certain things to happen in real life, and
  that&rsquo;s why we have to keep them off the stage and screen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re still talking about niggers. ...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was no use arguing, however. She left quite convinced that she could
  expect no support from any of the well-known producing companies. She was too
  scornful of their attitude to feel defeat; indeed, her scorn fed fuel to her
  keenness. Yet, if what Vox had said were true, the outlook did not appear
  very hopeful. Only gradually did she accept the notion that she must
  undertake the task herself. At first, this would have seemed preposterous,
  for she, of all persons, knew the immense technical difficulties of
  picture-making on a large scale. The cost, too, and the big risk of financial
  failure, made the project seem particularly mad; it was too huge a stake to
  play for, after all her Wall Street losses. And yet, when she continued to
  think about it, it was those Wall Street losses that finally urged her on; so
  much of her money had melted away into nothing, surely she could adventure a
  fraction of the residue in something, in something that was both big and
  real? Almost without awareness that she had already made the decision, she
  began to look about for possible colleagues in the enterprise; and her final
  misgivings disappeared when, to her great surprise, she found Statler
  sympathetic. Not only that; he offered to join her financially in the venture
  on a fifty-fifty basis. The fact that the film-companies wouldn&rsquo;t touch
  it didn&rsquo;t disturb him in the least. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made my pile by
  doing just what the other guy doesn&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And
  I&rsquo;ve found out another thing, too&mdash;­that there ain&rsquo;t no
  fools like those that think they know their own business best.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As for Nicky, he was sheerly delighted with the prospect of such new and
  exciting activities. He read books about the Indians, took flying visits into
  Arizona and New Mexico in search of good locations, and absorbed all the
  colour and tradition he could get hold of. He also practised before the
  camera and microphone, and was successful enough to enjoy himself very
  thoroughly. Sylvia was equally busy, engaging camera-men,
  production-managers, art-directors, dialogue-writers, and all the hordes of
  miscellaneous camp-followers required for such a job. These preparations were
  complete by the end of August, and the actual filming began a fortnight later
  at Sabinal, New Mexico.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Amerind,&rdquo; as Sylvia decided to call the picture, was in many
  ways a unique production. Not wholly original in treatment (it owed obvious
  debts to the great Griffiths canvases and also to the more recent all-negro
  &ldquo;Hallelujah"), it nevertheless broke as much new ground as could be
  expected from a single work. It cost money, and there was no stinting, but
  for size and scope it was probably one of the cheapest films ever made.
  Sylvia and Nicky drew salaries which, by Hollywood standards, were quite
  small, and the producer was a young Russian of genius, but not yet of
  reputation, who was glad enough to take his chance for less than the pay of a
  swell gangster. Except for Sylvia, nobody had a name already well-known to
  the world. There was about the entire enterprise, indeed, a prevalent
  atmosphere of youth and eager ambition; the whole company were aware,
  intuitively even if they did not think it out, that they were engaged in a
  pioneer adventure, something different in character from the conventional
  Hollywood job.</p>

  <p>But &ldquo;Amerind&rsquo;s&rdquo; greatest triumph, of course, was Nicky.
  As soon as the first few scenes had been shot, Sylvia was aware that he would
  prove to be all that she had hoped, and more. Not only was his acting superb,
  but he had an extraordinary success with the real Indians of the locality. He
  seemed to make them realise that the picture was intended to dignify and not
  travesty their race; he conquered their shyness, induced them to share in the
  general zest and excitement, and made a few of them into quite excellent
  actors. None of the big scenes&mdash;­the fight with the settlers, the Indian
  dance, the trek to the reserved territory&mdash;­would have been half so
  effective without his guidances and persuasions. It was noticeable that the
  Indians accepted him as one of themselves as they did no other; in the native
  village he strolled in and out of the small adobe huts as unceremoniously as
  (Sylvia reflected) he was liable to stroll in and out of her own and
  doubtless anyone else&rsquo;s bedroom. He was like that. She felt it was
  probably his most successful pose, that of having no pose at all.</p>

  <p>She was surpassingly happy during those crowded, hard-working weeks at
  Sabinal. They were something like a miracle to her, bringing back what she
  had believed entirely lost, the glamour of her early film-days. There were
  the same cries and shoutings, the same smells of dust and horses and
  camp-fire cooking, the same flaunted landscape-colours. Impossible to capture
  these directly for the film, but they were somehow imposed, she hoped, on
  every cadence and movement of those who were there amongst them the flaming
  ocotillo and lemon- yellow cactus, the ash-grey sage-brush against that
  background of pale mauve desert and violet horizon. Those September dawns
  when they all set out early, in cars as far as the road took them, then on
  horseback trails into the mountains, cast a spell over memory; made vivid all
  that she had ever had of happiness or excitement, and blacked out every qualm
  and trouble of more recent years. At that mile-high altitude, under the
  copper sky as the sun rose, one could sniff the future, one felt alive in the
  morning of the world. This was America, she felt, in a sense that might mean
  more to Americans if ever some day their skyscraper civilisation should fall
  away. She herself throve in it; her body freshened and grew taut with new
  ardours. Once, when Nicky kissed her, she returned his caress with a passion
  that overwhelmed them both, but him only with a curious wayward ecstasy. She
  had never met anyone the least like him before, and was sure she never would
  again. She was by no means confident that he was entirely sane. Certainly he
  was the only man she had ever known whose genius took in everything that he
  WAS as well as a few things that he HAD. The warm and sombre dignity of his
  Indian characterisation touched her as she felt sure millions of others would
  be touched; and it was perhaps natural that after his sublimities before the
  camera he should fly to the quaintest extremes when off duty. But on duty or
  off, he seemed alive to her in a sense in which most other people were dead;
  even his created self, the Indian of the film, lived more than all her
  far-away acquaintances of club-house and studio.</p>

  <p>She had very few acting scenes at Sabinal; most of hers were interiors to
  be shot later on in Hollywood. In these she was to take the part of the
  modern New York girl enamoured of the Indian, meeting him in drawing-rooms,
  yet seeing behind his tamed elegance the splendour of the untameable. It was
  a part that she looked forward to throughout those long, burning days in the
  desert; yet when at last the camp broke up and she waved farewell to the
  Indians from the window of the Los Angeles express there came over her a
  feeling of simple misery, as for a child&rsquo;s party that was over.</p>

  <p>The month that followed of studio-work, cutting, and final arrangement,
  might have been anti-climax but for her growing consciousness of success. Her
  acting surprised herself; when she compared it with that in her last film, it
  was as though she had grown into someone else. The love-scenes with Nicky
  were quite perfect, and his brooding tenderness set the key for what she felt
  sure would sound a new motif in screen-passion. Scores of men had made love
  to her, both before the camera and otherwise, but not one had impressed with
  such flawlessness of technique. Yet she found herself entirely incapable of
  judging whether this flawlessness in Nicky were due mainly to instinct or to
  experience. As a critic of love, she was puzzled; but as an exhibitionist she
  could not but admire the virtuosity of a performance which gave her own
  talents such full and confident scope. Never, indeed, had celluloid recorded
  her in better form.</p>

  <p>When the last shot had been taken (one morning in October) she had
  everyone she could think of called up on the telephone and invited to an
  impromptu party at her house that same evening. She felt recklessly
  triumphant, and took vast delight in the excitements and complications of
  such large-scale planning at short notice&mdash;­the servants clearing the
  big rooms for dancing, hired waiters unpacking crockery, the armies of
  electricians festooning coloured lights from the eucalyptus trees in the
  garden. She gave her bootlegger the largest private order he had had for
  months, and told the leader of a jazz-band over the San Francisco telephone
  that he could fly his men across at any expense; she wanted the best
  saxophones on the Pacific slope that night and was prepared to pay for them.
  All this kind of thing was reminiscent of more profligate days, but there was
  an intention in her mind that made profligacy appear worth while: it was a
  gesture to announce that Sylvia Seydel was still rich, just as later her
  picture could do its own announcing that she was not only still great but
  greater than ever.</p>

  <p>Between two and three hundred persons arrived, few of them personal
  friends, most mere acquaintances, some scarcely even that. She stirred to an
  inward contempt as she regally shook hands and accepted their chattering
  congratulations; but the contempt was in some sense a luxury to which she was
  treating herself as reward. She knew the mood of these people and the
  thoughts they had been exchanging about her ever since the disappointment
  (she could allow the word now) of her last picture. She knew that most of
  them thought that she had lost her head and was about to lose what was left
  of her money also; she knew that they had been laughing at her, reckoning her
  losses, scandalising her relationship with Nicky, whom they probably regarded
  as just the usual gigolo foreigner trading on his title and good
  looks&mdash;­a queen&rsquo;s favourite even if not already a prince-consort.
  Such knowledge gave her a cool and calculating arrogance; she would show
  these people the kind she really was and the kind Nicky really was. That he
  was attractive, witty, and clever, had been demonstrated often enough; but
  how much more was there that they would soon have to concede? She felt a
  stormy, half-proprietary pride in him as she caught over his shoulder
  fleeting stares of other dancers&mdash;­their inquisitive, envious, slightly
  ill-wishing eyes. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d enjoy themselves like this at my
  funeral,&rdquo; she whispered to Statler, during an interval, and he
  answered, in his softly cooing voice: &ldquo;I guess they think this is your
  funeral, Miss Seydel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Supper was taken in the huge panelled dining-room which had been cleared
  of all furniture except long buffet-tables. For over an hour the roar of
  conversation and popping of corks gathered impetus; there were torrents of
  champagne, and a few of the guests soon began to get noisily tipsy. The
  bootlegger supplying the wines had sent also, as a friendly tribute to the
  movie-queen, the equipment of a new game of his own invention; it consisted
  of life-size rubber heads of gloomily-featured persons labelled
  &ldquo;Depression,&rdquo; &ldquo;Unemployment,&rdquo; &ldquo;Stocks
  Slump,&rdquo; and so on, and the game was to shy balls at these figures till
  they toppled over and rang a bell. But there were not enough balls to go
  round, and some of the crowd pelted the figures with apples, empty bottles,
  and ice out of the champagne buckets, till the floor and walls at that end of
  the room were splashed and littered with debris. Whenever the bell did ring
  pandemonium raged for minutes on end, amidst which the tipsier among the
  throwers aimed their missiles wildly. Minor casualties resulted from these
  commotions, and a man&rsquo;s arm was badly gashed with broken glass; there
  also developed a noisy fight on the lawns between two hastily organised
  gangs, ending by the pushing of a garden-roller into an ornamental pond. Some
  rather valuable plants were destroyed and miscellaneous other items of damage
  done before the warriors of both sexes selected their partners, filled up
  their hip-flasks, and retired to amorous seclusion in the cars parked in the
  avenue. Indeed, there could be no doubt that the party was proving a thorough
  success.</p>

  <p>Towards midnight the surviving merrymakers called for a speech from
  Sylvia, who was still dancing with Nicky, and the cry was taken up so
  boisterously that guests came rushing in from their various preoccupations in
  other parts of the house and gardens. Sylvia, with her arm through
  Nicky&rsquo;s, mounted the dais amongst the jazz-players and skimmed a few
  sentences serenely above the hubbub. She said very little about the new film,
  except that it was finished, and that she was sure it was going to be a
  success. But she praised Nicky and insisted that all the credit was due to
  him rather than to her. At this there was some slightly mocking applause, to
  which she responded by adding: &ldquo;Well, anyhow, you&rsquo;ll all be
  seeing the picture, so you&rsquo;ll soon have a chance of judging the kind of
  person he really is.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>To her surprise, Nicky flushed and appeared put out by the remark.
  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I particularly want all these people to know
  the kind of person I really am,&rdquo; he answered, in a tone that began with
  lazy insolence and ended in a note of shrill rage. Then, in the excited hush
  that followed, he gave a sudden laugh, shook himself free from Sylvia, and
  pushed his way out of the room.</p>

  <p>Four hours later Sylvia slowly undressed amidst the perfumed and unguented
  luxury which had been photographed for so many art magazines and beauty-cream
  advertisements. She had not seen Nicky since his abrupt departure from the
  dance-room, and she was trying hard to feel that he had not meant to snub her
  publicly, but had only been a little more capricious than usual after too
  much champagne. Harder still, she tried to feel that it did not really matter
  what his reason had been, since he had behaved rudely to her, and must be
  left either to realise it for himself or not at all. It was by no means the
  first squabble they had had, but it was the first time they had ever given a
  public exhibition. She felt hurt, cross, and achingly tired after the stress
  of the evening and the sharp deflation of her triumph. The house and gardens
  were still full of sounds of the servants clearing things away, and one
  always wondered at such a time if it had all been worth while. On the whole
  she thought it had&mdash;­at any rate, up to the scene with Nicky.
  Fortunately, everybody had been more or less tight when that had happened.
  Perhaps Nicky too, poor boy. She had better make up her mind, she reflected,
  whether she was chiefly sorry or angry.</p>

  <p>She got into bed and soon found physical languors too comforting to
  resist; she was nearly asleep when suddenly the door opened and Nicky
  entered. He wore one of his brightly futurist dressing-gowns over green silk
  pyjamas, and smoked a cigarette that drooped obliquely from the corner of his
  mouth. There was nothing of his usual elegance about him; his face, on the
  contrary, was flushed and unquiet, and his hair tumbled over his forehead in
  picturesque confusion. After switching on the light he closed the door
  noisily and, without looking towards the bed, strode over to the
  dressing-table and began to use one of her hair-brushes. He did not speak,
  though of course that might be because he thought she was asleep; in which
  case, she considered, it had been rather bad-mannered of him to switch on
  lights and make such a racket. &ldquo;Well, Nicky,&rdquo; she said quietly,
  &ldquo;where have you been?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He swung round and answered in a clipped and rather peevish voice:
  &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t stand that infernal crowd, so I went out, got drunk
  on my own, and then had a bathe in the pool.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rather silly of you, really. Just the way to take a chill and die
  of pneumonia.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She was surprised, but able to keep quite unperturbed. She had been
  prepared for his meeting her with bland forgetfulness, or even with some sort
  of an apology; that he might continue the flare-up had hardly suggested
  itself. But then he always did what one least expected, she thought, calmly
  watching him.</p>

  <p>He went on, rather loudly; &ldquo;Look here, Sylvia, all this&mdash;­the
  sort of thing that happened to-night&mdash;­has got to stop. Don&rsquo;t say
  you don&rsquo;t know what I mean. You DO know. You were patronising me. You
  had me on a bit of string and kept trailing me round to be shown off to all
  your confounded friends. I won&rsquo;t have it. I belong to myself, and I
  won&rsquo;t be made a tame monkey of. I tell you I won&rsquo;t have it. And
  don&rsquo;t imagine I shall be restrained by any feelings of&mdash;­of
  gratitude&mdash;­or chivalry&mdash;­or&mdash;­&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear Nicky, those are the last motives I should ever suspect in
  you. I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re still rather drunk or you wouldn&rsquo;t
  be talking such nonsense.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t nonsense. You know perfectly well that all this
  evening you&rsquo;ve been doing nothing but parade me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s all you can give as a reason for making a scene in
  public? Just because I said something quite harmless and not very important
  that didn&rsquo;t happen to take your fancy? Do you ever care a damn whether
  I always like the things you say?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s different. You went round acting the proud mamma with
  the infant prodigy!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Nicky, you&rsquo;re too funny! Even if I was acting, which I
  don&rsquo;t feel inclined to admit, haven&rsquo;t I as much right to an
  occasional pose as you have? Don&rsquo;t you ever act? Aren&rsquo;t you
  acting just a little bit now? Why, you&rsquo;re just lashing yourself into a
  temper to enjoy the result, that&rsquo;s all. I&rsquo;ll allow you&rsquo;re
  managing it rather well, but I&rsquo;m doing my share too,
  remember&mdash;­your smart dialogue wouldn&rsquo;t come out so pat if I
  didn&rsquo;t hand you the right cues. And, by the way, I don&rsquo;t think
  the hairbrush gestures are quite in keeping&mdash;­put it down and try
  something else.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He suddenly collapsed on to the bed and began to shout and shake with
  laughter. &ldquo;Oh, Sylvia, whatever makes you so adorably acute?&rdquo;
  Every cadence in his voice was changed, and as he went on laughing he stooped
  and buried his lips and nose in the gentle hollow of her throat. &ldquo;Do I
  smell of champagne, darling, or doesn&rsquo;t it matter? Oh, what a lovely
  and clever woman you are! Lovely, yet you&rsquo;ve got a mind like a surgical
  knife.... I like the mixture, I must say.&rdquo; His lips roamed to her
  mouth, and he added, in between deep kisses: &ldquo;Yes, I do... DO...
  like... it....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She flung her arm round his neck and stroked his face, instantly
  forgetting the ridiculous little tiff, and submitting to his fondling with
  rich contentment. Her sensuality was of a kind of which she felt no shame and
  which she saw no need to suppress. &ldquo;Nicky, I&rsquo;m&mdash;­I&rsquo;m
  glad you like me.&rdquo; That sounded silly. She had only said it to hear
  herself say it; her real answer was with her body. And her body felt, if it
  were possible, amused. It occurred to her all at once that here they were,
  the two of them, engaged in these rather abrupt and intimate diversions,
  without ever having exchanged a word of love. That was modern, surely. In the
  old days, to judge from novels, love was largely a matter of protestation,
  and an author had to work his characters up to a fantastic pitch of verbose
  sentimentality before he could close the final chapter with a chaste embrace.
  Rather unhealthy, she thought; she remembered going through the phase in her
  teens&mdash;­ perhaps most girls did at that age. Anyhow, the mere idea of
  talking love with Nicky made her feel quite comically gigglish. It was all
  right for the films, but they would be too well aware of each other&rsquo;s
  technique to take themselves seriously in private. In the midst of her cool,
  roving thoughts she passed from mere amusement to sharp, quicksilver delight.
  Marvellous boy! And how wonderful those days had been at Sabinal&mdash;­long,
  brick-red days in the sun, Nicky hallooing the Indians, sausages frying over
  picnic-fires, the rusty-rose of the sky when they all returned to camp in the
  evenings. And the scarlet ocotillo that was like a spurt of flame, and the
  big blots of lilac and lemon on the hillsides. ... She was never quite
  certain whether colours made her happy, or whether she always noticed them
  most when she was happy. For she liked Nicky tremendously&mdash;­as much as
  she had ever liked any man, if you could call him a man.... But to LOVE
  him... well, anyway, he didn&rsquo;t ask you to. If he wanted to kiss, he
  did, and if you felt in a similar mood, all right; he didn&rsquo;t insist on
  adding a huge significance to it. And what WAS love, for that matter? Only a
  word to mean anything you liked; drinking too much champagne, sleeping with
  somebody, dying on the battle-field, going to church&mdash;­ you did it all
  for what could be called by the name. An unprecise term, therefore, to use in
  an argument.... But she was at Sabinal again, its colours before her eyes and
  its warmth lapping her like a tide; and she knew at last that whether she
  loved Nicky or not (an absurd problem), his coming had made a difference
  beyond her power to calculate, and that without him now she would be
  struggling amongst the elbows of the world. She had had her day, there was no
  real doubt of it; but his profound and lovely foolery could give her the
  illusion of a second chance.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap5"
     id="chap5">CHAPTER FIVE. &mdash; NICHOLAS PALESCU</a></h2>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to stay here long,&rdquo; said
  Nicky, driving his two-seater on Fifth Avenue; and Sylvia, sitting next to
  him, purred comfortably: &ldquo;Sure, Nicky&mdash;­after the next picture
  we&rsquo;ll go to Europe for a season, or Japan, or just anywhere you
  like.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He pulled up sharply and the surrounding items of the traffic-block seemed
  to stoop over him in menace. It was an extravagantly low-built car, the last
  word in silver-gadgeted opulence, and a recent gift from Sylvia; there had
  been photographs of it and of them throughout the Press, and the makers, for
  publicity, had let it go at half-price. But Nicky already felt that he had
  given away several thousand dollars&rsquo; worth of advertisement in return
  for nothing but the sensation of being a large baby who must not only travel
  in a bassinette but propel himself in one. Just now, for instance, the
  occupants of adjacent cars immediately noticed him, and there was a concerted
  craning of necks and muttering of comments until, with a jerk, the traffic
  moved on.</p>

  <p>Nicky had come to New York with Sylvia after the successful première of
  &lsquo;Red Desert.&rsquo; The fact was, at the trade-show the film&rsquo;s
  obvious merits had caused several distributing companies to bid for it, and
  Sylvia, after much haggling and consultation with Statler, had disposed of
  half her rights for a hundred thousand dollars. As this was nearly as much as
  the whole film had cost to produce, and as the services of nation- wide
  distributors were bound to result in larger profits, she felt she had driven
  a good bargain. True, the distributors insisted on making a few slight
  alterations in the film as it stood. Besides the change of title, it was also
  decided to add a few supplementary studio scenes revealing the fact that the
  Indian was not really an Indian after all, but a bank-president&rsquo;s son
  whom his parents believed to have been drowned as a baby, but who had
  actually been rescued by Indians and brought up as one of themselves. The
  timely discovery of his true ancestry made possible a new and happier ending
  for the picture, and the final scene showed Nicky and Sylvia bringing
  paternal tears to the eyes of an old man in a bath-chair. Apart, however,
  from these additions, and the shortening of a kiss by two seconds in the
  interests of public morality, &lsquo;Red Desert&rsquo; was substantially the
  same work as the projected &lsquo;Amerind.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>The revised version represented, it might be said, a victory for
  reasonableness and common sense on all sides. Sylvia had been at first
  reluctant to consent to any changes at all, but the unmistakable enthusiasm
  of the film-magnates for the production as a whole convinced her that it
  would be merely quixotic to stand out, particularly as Statler favoured
  agreement and Nicky offered no objections. Only the Russian producer proved
  thoroughly intransigeant, but since he had no direct financial interest in
  the film&rsquo;s success it was easy to discount his attitude. Nor could it
  be denied that the cautious editing imposed by the distributors seemed amply
  justified in the reception given to &ldquo;Red Desert&rdquo; by the cinema-
  going public. The dish had been well salted by preliminary publicity, and the
  story of how Raphael Rassova, the new Roumanian film-star, had originally
  masqueraded in Hollywood as a Roumanian prince, and how Sylvia Seydel had
  found him out but had refused to give him away, evoked delighted comments
  from the gossip-paragraphists. &ldquo;A wonder film,&rdquo; quoted the blurb
  compiled from assorted newspaper criticisms. &ldquo;Something new in
  cinematography.... Raphael Rassova is marvellous, and Sylvia Seydel is
  lovelier than ever.... At one bound the Roumanian Romeo steps into the front
  rank of heart-throbbers.... Miss Seydel has surpassed herself.... To take a
  single glance at Rassova is to know instantly why girls leave home....
  Rassova is a revelation. Not since Valentino has there risen such a star in
  the firmament...&rdquo; The film&rsquo;s triumph was definitely clinched when
  a Baptist minister in Athens (Arkansas) described it in a sermon as &ldquo;a
  shameless aphrodisiac, fit only for a nation of birth-controllers and
  evolutionists.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>On Sylvia, at least, the effect of such rather stupendous success was
  completely tonic. She had always (until the Wall Street slump) considered
  herself a good business-woman, and she was in her element now with the shoals
  of offers that began to pour in on her, not only for film-work, but for such
  remunerative side-issues as newspaper-articles, recommendations of
  face-cream, magazine-interviews, <i>etc</i>. All her depressions had lifted
  at last; she had &ldquo;rung the bell&rdquo;; her &ldquo;come-back&rdquo; had
  been practically all that she had ever hoped&mdash;­practically,
  yes&mdash;­and the impractical residue had been fairly easy to forget. She
  was still a queen in her own right and on a safe throne; besides which, she
  had had the genius to marry Nicky. That, in the opinion of Hollywood&rsquo;s
  coolest critics, was a prudent fortification of the dynasty.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You see, Nicky,&rdquo; she was saying, that afternoon on Fifth
  Avenue, when the next traffic-block gave her the chance, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve
  made such a wonderful hit that it&rsquo;s terribly important to follow up
  quickly with another. Terribly important for you too. So many people
  won&rsquo;t take you seriously till you&rsquo;ve done a thing
  twice&mdash;­they&rsquo;re always afraid the first time may be only a
  fluke.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, so it may be. And, anyhow, who wants to be taken
  seriously?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I know, but when people begin handing you dollars by the
  hundred thousand you can&rsquo;t treat the matter entirely as a joke. That
  offer of Vox&rsquo;s this morning was pretty good, and I think he&rsquo;ll
  give more if we hold out. I cabled him that we&rsquo;d accept two-fifty, but
  I expect it&rsquo;ll end by splitting the difference.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Nicky assented rather vaguely. He took little interest in the complicated
  financial problems that had arisen since his ascent into fame; beyond the
  knowledge that he was now rich enough to buy anything he wanted in shops, he
  was glad to leave all that side of the business in Sylvia&rsquo;s hands. It
  was not that he couldn&rsquo;t bargain shrewdly himself; he could, when he
  wanted to&mdash;­which was to say, when he felt that the issue could possibly
  matter to him. He had, for instance, enjoyed the haggling with those
  Englishmen about the aeroplane invention, and with Sylvia about his original
  salary as secretary, because in those days he had needed money and could
  bother about it. But now he found it difficult to raise any keen excitement
  about the exact digits that were to precede the row of noughts in his new
  contract.</p>

  <p>When they reached their suite at the Plaza a cabled reply from Vox awaited
  them. Sylvia&rsquo;s eyes, as she tore it open, conveyed the news.
  &ldquo;Nicky!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s accepted! He&rsquo;s not
  even arguing about it! We&rsquo;re signing for two hundred and fifty thousand
  dollars!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He smiled, and tried to think, as a mere essay in the whimsical, what the
  sum of a quarter of a million dollars might do. It might buy a scrap of
  frontage on Broadway, the whole Ziegfeld chorus for an experiment in
  companionate marriage in Honolulu, a large-sized howitzer, or a seat on the
  New York Stock Exchange; it could endow a professorship of ventriloquism at
  Harvard, equip a scientific expedition to Mongolia, or pay the interest on
  the world&rsquo;s debts for about ten minutes. What was quite certain,
  however, was that the quarter-million handed over by Vox would be employed in
  none of these thought-provoking pursuits. He said, after his reverie:
  &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s not too bad, is it? But it&rsquo;s got to be earned
  yet, remember. How many pictures are we promising?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Three.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Three, was it? Thirty-three would have appeared to concern him no
  more&mdash;­and no less. For he knew then, quite definitely, that he
  didn&rsquo;t want to make another film at all. He was bored, with a boredom
  like a hot chafing that would soon break into a sore. &ldquo;I think
  I&rsquo;ll go out for a walk,&rdquo; he said, desperately seeking relief.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, Nicky, dear, if you wouldn&rsquo;t mind, there are just a few
  things that you simply must do. ...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This time it was autograph-books that had to be signed. There was a whole
  heap of them awaiting the scribbled &ldquo;Raphael Rassova&rdquo; which,
  since it would inevitably convert the mere admirer into the devotee, was
  considered well worth the trouble both by Sylvia, with her experience, and by
  Nicky&rsquo;s new private secretary, with his. This latter person was a
  hearty, hand-shaking New Yorker, specially recommended by Vox for the
  education of rising stars in the way they should twinkle.</p>

  <p>Nicky filled his fountain-pen and set dismally to work. Just before he had
  finished the secretary admitted a girl journalist who wanted to know his
  life-story, how it felt to be famous, and his opinion of American womanhood.
  A few of her questions he answered frivolously, and afterwards Sylvia warned
  him against this; for it appeared that journalists were dangerous people,
  with immense power to injure him if they conceived themselves slighted. He
  was, he realised, a much more vulnerable person now than ever
  before&mdash;­an idol, it would seem, only so long as he skilfully avoided
  becoming a target. He grumbled for a time, but there was soon the need to
  dress for a dinner and reception that were being held that evening in his
  honour. He went in a state of grudging resignation induced by several
  cocktails, shook hands with between four and five hundred people, made a
  short speech, signed menu-cards by the dozen, and drank some rather bad
  brandy. As he crossed the pavement afterwards with Sylvia to reach their car,
  a crowd of girls who had apparently been waiting in the rain for some hours
  rushed forward. His coat was torn slightly and one girl put her arms round
  his neck and pulled his hat off. He rode back to the hotel ruffled, sombre,
  and hardly soothed by the sight of a monster sky- sign spelling out his
  pseudonym in letters of vivid scarlet. Sylvia, of course, had been marvellous
  throughout the entire evening&mdash;­marvellous herself, and marvellous in
  the way she had tried to spare him the kind of things he disliked. It was the
  one axiom he forced himself to admit on every possible occasion&mdash;­the
  marvellousness of Sylvia. That she was beautiful, clever, and immensely
  capable of running their married life as a going concern, were facts so
  indisputable that he could not easily decide what else there was that she
  could have been. Perhaps not very much. And yet... his mood of growing
  dissatisfaction seemed just to touch her, as it were, while his back was
  turned, and to recoil swiftly whenever he caught himself at it.</p>

  <p>That night, in their bedroom, she remarked that he had talked very little
  during the evening, and asked if he had been tired. The question, coming
  then, focused all his complicated discomforts into a single pinpoint of
  misery, so that he answered, rather amazed at the extent of his own
  suffering: &ldquo;Yes, I was tired. The people didn&rsquo;t interest me, and
  I didn&rsquo;t want to bother with them. Why should I bother with people if I
  don&rsquo;t feel like it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Only that you always used to be so amusing in company,
  Nicky&mdash;­&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He flared up suddenly at that. &ldquo;Oh, God, must I always be what I
  always used to be? That&rsquo;s the fault of everything&mdash;­to have to go
  on doing the same thing, being the same thing&mdash;­it&rsquo;s like that
  with films&mdash;­because of one, you&rsquo;ve got to go on making two,
  three, four, five, six!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nicky, my dear, I don&rsquo;t know why you should let yourself get
  in such a rage. Just because your success has been
  wonderful&mdash;­&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I know it&rsquo;s because of that. It&rsquo;s only the happy
  failures who have freedom to swop grooves. If you&rsquo;re unlucky enough to
  be a success, you&rsquo;re expected to stay where you&rsquo;re put so that
  mass- hysteria knows where to find you.... Oh yes, it&rsquo;s wonderful all
  right. But I remember I once said that the Californian scenery was wonderful,
  and you told me that you were tired of it because it just went on being
  wonderful. A wise remark, that, Sylvia.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was despondent in those days, if that&rsquo;s what you mean. I
  remember how I envied you your eagerness for things&mdash;­you had plenty of
  it then.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t envy you yours now. I could stand you enjoying
  all this success if you were only a little privately amused by it. But I
  don&rsquo;t think you are. I think you really believe that &rsquo;Red
  Desert&rsquo;s&rsquo; a masterpiece.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I certainly haven&rsquo;t reached the point of despising it, as you
  apparently have.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t despise it&mdash;­I just think it&rsquo;s ridiculous.
  The idea of the Indians was all right to begin with, but the ending you let
  them stick on was utterly fatuous. Of course if it was merely money you
  wanted, that&rsquo;s a sound reason, I admit. But why go on pretending that
  the thing&rsquo;s still any real good?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You agreed to the change of ending yourself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I&rsquo;d have agreed to anything. To tell the truth, I
  was so damnably bored by the whole business by that time
  that&mdash;­&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Even the squabble, he reflected heavily, was proceeding with the
  orderliness of routine. They had had many such, during their four months of
  married life, and all had left their sincere affection for each other
  entirely unimpaired. But now he felt only saddened instead of slightly
  exhilarated by the quick-fire exchange, because he could sense behind it the
  pull of so many tenuous threads of emotion. He felt uneasy, exacerbated,
  aware of a host of irritating tendernesses. He said, pacifying himself:
  &ldquo;Oh, what&rsquo;s the good of all this wrangling, Sylvia? I&rsquo;m in
  a filthy temper. I think I&rsquo;d better work it off on some of those
  signatures. There are still about a million of them to be done.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t bother, darling, if you feel tired. They can
  wait.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, no, I couldn&rsquo;t sleep if I tried&mdash;­I may as well get
  on with them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He put on a dressing-gown and passed through the adjoining rooms into the
  one that had been fitted out as a temporary office. Here, on a large table,
  lay his job&mdash;­mysterious and cabalistic, the writing of two curious
  words, with his own hand, on pieces of paper&mdash;­ the last lip-service to
  personality demanded by a rubber-stamp world&mdash;­and even then the
  personality was bogus. The trouble with modern fame, he decided, wielding his
  fountain-pen, was that it so soon became humourless. It had been fun, at
  first, being fêted by celebrities and having money enough to buy
  fur-overcoats and Cadillacs; just as it had been fun at first, in fact rather
  a lark, to go picture-making in the mountain-deserts of New Mexico. New
  sensations were always interesting up to a point, but the point was so
  fatally often that at which they ceased to be new. He swung round to the
  window&mdash;­it was on the thirtieth floor or so&mdash;­and watched the
  glittering panorama which represented the strange world that he had
  conquered. But had he conquered it, or had it only conquered him? On a desk
  near by lay an enormous heap of unopened letters, forwarded from the film
  company&rsquo;s headquarters in Los Angeles and all addressed to him by
  unknown admirers. It was his secretary&rsquo;s job to deal with them, of
  course; the usual procedure was to send a polite reply enclosing one of the
  signed postcard photographs. But he opened half a dozen himself, in mere
  curiosity, and glanced through their contents&mdash;­ill-spelt appeals for
  money, hard-luck stories from out-of- works, maudlin sentimentality from
  schoolgirls, passionate unburdenings from bourgeois wives in big cities... .
  He threw them back into the heap after a few moments, in a mood of utter
  nausea. And these letters, he realised, came by every post, all the year
  round, and not only to him, but to Sylvia and every other screen-idol. They
  were his fan-mail, individually of no importance, but to be carefully counted
  and classified as an index-figure of his rise or fall in the public esteem.
  He took up his pen and scribbled &lsquo;Raphael Rassova&rsquo; once more, but
  the name, facing him now so absurdly on all sides, transfixed him into panic
  as he thought of the three more films that he was promising to make. He
  couldn&rsquo;t do it; he knew now that he couldn&rsquo;t and wouldn&rsquo;t.
  To have to stereotype himself like that, with the same theme always repeated
  da capo al fine&mdash;­was it not all a sort of harlotry, standardised
  harlotry for those standardised brothels of the machine-mind&mdash;­the
  cinemas? The phrase, pleasing him intellectually, converted his momentary
  cowardice into rebellion. He suddenly felt a vast grudge against those who
  were offering him, under the guise of success, this rigid and dingy slavery.
  He was to become a part of the huge mass-production plant of Fordised
  emotions, a rare and expensive raw material surrendered to the machine. It
  made him think of a paragraph he had seen in a woman&rsquo;s journal a few
  days before, suggesting that Raphael Rassova would soon be second only to the
  Prince of Wales as an object of feminine adoration; and the recollection gave
  him a quickening sympathy with that enigmatic figure across the ocean, a man
  nearly old enough to be his father, yet condemned to everlasting
  Peter-Panhood by a country haunted by the spectre of its own old age. But he,
  anyhow, had been born to it, had had half a lifetime in which to get used to
  seeing his photograph, like that of a rather forlorn head-prefect, on
  magazine-covers and chocolate-boxes. It was harder to accept such bondage
  voluntarily, and for no visible reward except the power to spend money with
  as little genuine freedom as one had been permitted to earn it.</p>

  <p>The spectacle of that future, dimly menacing as it had been for weeks,
  revealed itself more monstrously as he sat pondering alone. He saw its
  tentacles closing in on him with every moment; already the giant machine was
  being prepared for his bodily insertion. He felt as if it were about to pulp
  him into nothing but a phallic symbol to be held up before the stiffening
  glare of the mass-mind. That phrase pleased him too; he felt protected,
  somehow, by his own power of mental invective. A little cheered, he turned
  more tranquilly to thoughts of Sylvia. He liked her, and would have liked her
  nearly as much if she had been a man. The little difference, never important
  to him, had grown less so with familiarity. Perhaps in that sense it was a
  mistake for him to have become anybody&rsquo;s husband, even a fourth one. A
  sudden consciousness of his own personal tragedy came over him at that
  moment. He was rootless, like so many of that war-spoilt generation; without
  parentage, nationality, or religion, he had developed a sacred petulance of
  spirit which was all he could confidently call his own. But it was too
  fragile to bear the imposition of outside ties. The thought of himself as a
  father, or as an old man, made him fret uneasily; he had no reserves of
  stability, his only happiness lay in movement, though whether, in the long
  run, he was chiefly pursuing or escaping, he could never be quite sure. Just
  now, at any rate, he wanted definitely to escape&mdash;­from New York and
  America altogether; yet, if he did, he wondered if Sylvia could possibly
  understand that he was no more tired of her than an explorer is tired when he
  moves on. All he hoped was doubtless the impossible, that she could let him
  go as joyfully as he, if she were but joyful at all, could leave her.</p>

  <p>He went to bed, slept badly, and rose in the morning restless as from a
  series of nightmares; after breakfast he left Sylvia busy with maids and
  secretaries and took a brisk walk along the pavements, wearing his hat and
  overcoat as disguisingly as he could. Even that, for instance, had been an
  exciting sensation at first&mdash;­the continual expectation of being
  recognised by strangers; but by now it had become nothing but a fierce
  unpleasantness. He walked fast, eyeing shop-windows furtively, and managed to
  remain unnoticed for a time; but along Broadway some girls coming out of a
  department-store identified him. There were shrill cries of
  &ldquo;Rassova,&rdquo; and before he could gather his wits he was hurrying
  along with a shouting and cheering mob at his heels. He turned into a side-
  street, increasing his pace and throwing a smile to his pursuers; a woman
  seized his hand and shook it vehemently; then, with the smile still streaked
  across his face, he saw an open doorway and swerved into it, blindly pushing
  open the inner doors to which it gave access. To his surprise he found
  himself in a church. It was too dark to see clearly, but he caught a distant
  glimpse of another occupant and hurried towards him. &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo;
  he began, rather breathlessly, &ldquo;but is there a different exit out of
  here? I want to get away from a crowd that&rsquo;s following me&mdash;­you
  see, I&rsquo;m Raphael Rassova.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Despite the urgency of the matter, he could not restrain a thrill of
  pleasure when he found that the man had clearly never heard of the name.
  &ldquo;Rassova, the movie-actor,&rdquo; Nicky explained, and the man
  answered, in a quite unimpressed voice: &ldquo;Oh, I see.... I&rsquo;m afraid
  you&rsquo;ll have to go out by the way you came in, but there&rsquo;s a room
  where you could wait for a time. I&rsquo;ll tell the crowd to clear off, if
  you like.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Nicky. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m terribly obliged to
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Only then, as his eyes grew accustomed to the gloom of the interior, did
  he perceive that his rescuer wore clerical costume, and a few minutes later,
  sitting by the fire in a comfortably furnished vestry, he realised from
  pictures on the wall that the church was Roman. After an interval the priest
  rejoined him and began to chat casually and still without the slightest
  inquisitiveness. When Nicky out of courtesy volunteered further information
  about himself, he merely said: &ldquo;Oh, yes, I understand&mdash;­ some of
  the people in the crowd told me about you.&rdquo; He spoke in a way that
  rather charmingly avoided both contempt and any excessive interest.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps you didn&rsquo;t believe me till then?&rdquo; Nicky
  suggested.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, it did just enter my mind that you might be an escaped
  gunman.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And even so, you&rsquo;d have asked me in here to wait?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; He laughed, and Nicky laughed, and they were
  instinctively aware of liking each other. He was about thirty, Nicky
  supposed; a sandy-haired, rather stockily-built man with very bright
  grey-blue eyes and a pale, pleasantly absent-minded face. An Irishman named
  Byrne, he said, and not attached to that particular church&mdash;­merely a
  friend of the priest in charge. He himself was shortly going out to a parish,
  if it could be called such, in South America&mdash;­a tract of swamp and
  jungle that he could not cross in less than a fortnight, so he would have
  plenty of work. He was sailing at the end of the week, on the Megantic. After
  he had talked for some time about his own affairs, he seemed to recollect
  that Nicky had his too, and remarked that it must be annoying to be so famous
  that one daren&rsquo;t walk about the streets&mdash;­ &ldquo;Though, of
  course,&rdquo; he added, shrewdly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s good advertisement for
  you, I suppose, so you can&rsquo;t really object to it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I loathe it,&rdquo; answered Nicky, and began to say a great many
  things that were in his mind. Gradually, however, as he talked, there came
  upon him a curious and entirely novel sensation&mdash;­the sensation that
  somebody else was not overwhelmingly interested in him. It was not that the
  priest was inattentive, or showed any signs of boredom or displeasure; it was
  merely his very gentle air of having had, all along, more pressing matters to
  think about, and of still, despite Nicky, contriving to have them. Nicky was
  puzzled. All his life he had been used to occupying the centre of the stage;
  his good looks and wits had won it for him, equally from men and women, and
  though he was always prepared for hostility, the one thing he never expected
  was indifference. Yet this man did seem, in a sort of way, indifferent. It
  was agreeable to find him unmoved by the name of Raphael Rassova, but less so
  to find him equally unmoved by the bitterest unmasking of that personage. All
  he said, in reply to a particularly eloquent fulmination, was: &ldquo;Yes,
  you must find it very tiresome. But of course it&rsquo;s in your power to
  give it up just as soon as you like.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They chatted for some time longer and exchanged cordial good wishes before
  Nicky took a cab back to the hotel.</p>

  <p>That night he told Sylvia that he must go. But the strange thing was that,
  in the very telling, he was aware of a sense in which he would have to leave
  something behind, in which he would be linked to her always; indeed, he felt
  a touch of excitement in the romantic possibility that he might even some day
  come back. And what had seemed likely to be a grand emotional climax turned
  out, after all, a mere businesslike discussion of holiday plans. She said she
  had noticed his need of a change&mdash;­a complete change; and though it
  would necessarily upset a good many arrangements, Vox and those other people
  would have to put up with it. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use you staying here and
  having a breakdown, is it?&rdquo; Then, almost unimportantly, she added:
  &ldquo;Do you want me to come with you? I don&rsquo;t suppose you
  do&mdash;­you like having adventures on your own, I know. And I shall be very
  busy&mdash;­probably Vox will have work for me to do.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He gazed at her as at some miracle being enacted before his eyes.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; he said at length.
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re really enjoying yourself here, aren&rsquo;t you, amongst
  all this fame?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pretty well,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re evidently
  not, so you&rsquo;re quite right to take a rest from it. Where, by the way,
  do you think of going?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thought of Buenos Aires, to begin with. I&rsquo;ve never been to
  South America.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have. You&rsquo;ll like it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He had two more days in New York&mdash;­amply filled by the joyous
  preparations for departure. No public announcement was issued, and careful
  attempts were made for at least a partial incognito on board. Sylvia, who had
  had much experience of these matters, was full of useful help and
  suggestions; she bought him books for the voyage, and superintended all the
  details of tickets, passport, and luggage. On the last night before the
  Megantic was due to sail they went out to dine at a fashionable
  dancing-restaurant, and some of his lost enthusiasm returned to him as he
  gazed across the table at his wife. HIS WIFE. He thought her very adorable,
  and the joke of their being married was perhaps, after all, as good as most.
  His humour rose into exultation as the night proceeded; he did not even
  object when the spotlight was turned on them and, in response to calls from
  the other diners, he had to get up and make a little speech. At that very
  moment, he was thinking, the cabin-trunks were on board, and his valet might
  be laying out his day-clothes for the last time.</p>

  <p>Later, at the hotel, she said: &ldquo;You know, Nicky, you were wrong when
  you said I&rsquo;m not privately amused by this success of yours. I AM. I DO
  think it&rsquo;s funny. And I think you are, too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He laughed, and answered, to a question she hadn&rsquo;t asked:
  &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s queer&mdash;­the way I always get tired, and want to
  change, and do something else. I feel rather sick with most things, after a
  time. I can&rsquo;t settle myself. Not that I particularly want to, of
  course.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What DO you want? Do you know?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not in the least. Except that, in a general sort of way, I want to
  be ME.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re YOU all right. You needn&rsquo;t have any fears about
  that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, YOU&rsquo;RE another YOU. We&rsquo;re quits at the rather
  silly game.... Which is all talking nonsense, of course.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, all nonsense. Good night, Nicky.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good night, Sylvia.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The next day, on board, he renewed his acquaintance with the priest, and
  as the voyage progressed they became good friends. Byrne, however, was still
  far from showing signs of being impressed by Nicky, and Nicky was still
  rather delightedly puzzled over the phenomenon. And yet the Irishman by no
  means discouraged the youth&rsquo;s more impulsive companionship. He had an
  air of slightly detached tolerance that was a little less than chilly, though
  not quite warm; and Nicky felt again that the root of the attitude was the
  simple fact that he himself was not, and never could be, a salient feature of
  this man&rsquo;s life. Nevertheless, or perhaps because of it, he was the
  more tempted to be frank, and he did not disguise, but rather even paraded,
  the fact that his brief past had contained many incidents of which the
  stricter moralist might disapprove. During those lengthening days in southern
  waters, with the coast of Brazil looking sometimes no more than a
  stone&rsquo;s throw away, the two talked a good deal between adjacent
  deck-chairs; or more accurately, Nicky confided, and Byrne listened. It was a
  new and somewhat difficult experience for Nicky to tell the exact truth; yet
  his life-story, even without the embellishments he usually added to it, was
  quite a vivid chronicle. Born after his father&rsquo;s death, he had lost his
  mother at the age of five; she had died during the flight of refugees when
  the Germans invaded Roumania in 1916. The family had originally had money,
  but it was all lost; and a tragic childhood had merged inevitably into
  disturbed and fitful youth. He was luckier than most in having had two
  thief-proof assets&mdash;­brains and good looks; and during his boyhood he
  had sensed that his only chance of survival, let alone of happiness, lay in
  the exploitation of these for what they would fetch. In a world of paupers
  and profiteers he had contrived a technique of living, and that this
  technique was not too squeamish in what it permitted itself must, he argued,
  be laid to the charge of a society that offered him nothing he wanted on any
  other terms. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t grumble at the tricks fate has played on
  me; but I do say that I&rsquo;ve never been able to discern in them any moral
  code obliging me to abide by its rules in return.&rdquo; He gave Byrne
  various examples of unregretted misdeeds and seemed surprised when the priest
  was neither shocked nor condemnatory. &ldquo;As for personal lies about
  oneself, I almost hold that one is entitled to them&mdash;­ they&rsquo;re a
  protective covering in the choice of which one may show good or bad taste
  just as in clothes. I happen to be telling the truth now, to you, but
  that&rsquo;s merely for the novel sensation of nakedness.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said Byrne quietly, &ldquo;I think I find your
  experiences rather more interesting than your philosophy. Tell me, if you
  like, about where you&rsquo;ve been.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;WHAT I&rsquo;ve been might surprise you more. I&rsquo;ve had jobs
  as a waiter, a ship&rsquo;s steward, an air-mechanic, a translator of English
  books into Russian for the Soviet Government, and a commercial traveller. Oh,
  and an inventor. I MUST tell you about that. It&rsquo;s rather funny,
  and&mdash;­incidentally&mdash;­it explains how I ever managed to arrive in
  Hollywood.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Byrne seemed amused by the story, especially by the description of the
  gyrector experiment in England. &ldquo;I give you good marks for pluck,
  anyhow,&rdquo; he commented, and then, with a suddenness that was
  characteristic of him, took up a book and would talk no more.</p>

  <p>They had many such conversations and arguments, which Nicky enjoyed the
  more completely because Byrne&rsquo;s replies were rarely of a kind that
  interrupted the copious torrent of his own confessions. Once, after he had
  been chattering for some time, and had paused at a point that invited some
  remark from the other, Byrne looked up quietly and exclaimed:
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but I was thinking of something else for the
  moment&mdash;­you&rsquo;ll have to go over that again, I&rsquo;m afraid, if
  you want me to grasp it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I really don&rsquo;t think I could possibly remember it
  all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps it doesn&rsquo;t matter then.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Nicky laughed. &ldquo;Of course it doesn&rsquo;t. Nothing matters that I
  say&mdash;­ sparks from fused wires, that&rsquo;s all. Much more interesting
  is what you were thinking about that monopolised all your
  attention.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Byrne answered, as almost from a dream: &ldquo;I was thinking of some work
  that awaits me. When I get to Buenos Aires I have a three-weeks&rsquo;
  journey up-river to the frayed edges of civilisation and beyond. Yet only two
  centuries ago, in that same region, my predecessors were carrying out what
  was perhaps, all things considered, the most successful social experiment in
  history. In those days cathedral bells rang out over rich provinces, the
  native Indians lived in cosy homesteads and their children went to school and
  were taught Spanish&mdash;­a whole nation enjoyed peace and good-humour under
  the rule of a few wise and elderly men in black uniforms&mdash;­the same, by
  the way, that I wear at this moment. History tells us, too, that the art of
  music throve especially, and that violins were brought over from Europe to be
  played in the churches instead of organs. I often try to think what that must
  have meant. Mid-eighteenth century, remember&mdash;­too early for Mozart, but
  there would be Bach and Corelli. Entrancing picture, isn&rsquo;t it? Most
  people think of civilisation as something that goes on spreading
  inevitably&mdash;­but it&rsquo;s really much more like a tide that can ebb as
  well as flow. That land where once there were Calderon plays and Bach sonatas
  is now a fever-ridden waste inhabited by a few half-barbarous tribes, while
  the old cathedrals, stripped of their bells and ornaments, are almost hidden
  away. More terribly than Debussy&rsquo;s, too, because their sea is a green
  one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re going?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. I understand that the grand tradition still partly lingers,
  mixed up with the older and younger traditions of poisoned arrows and gin. A
  friend of mine, a brother-priest, was there a few years ago and found the
  natives very glad to have their baptisms and marriages and burials re-
  solemnised by him. He couldn&rsquo;t stay, unfortunately.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But YOU&rsquo;LL stay?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That was the day before the Megantic turned into the grey estuary of the
  Plate. The next morning, with Buenos Aires in sight, Nicky sought out Byrne
  for what must necessarily be their last talk on board. &ldquo;Where do you go
  when you get on shore?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To Rosario by train, and then by river-boat to Asuncion. It leaves
  to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have still another thousand miles or so after that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can I&mdash;­may I come with you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good heavens, no&mdash;­it would be the poorest sort of rest- cure
  imaginable.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want a rest-cure, except from crowds and women and
  cities.&rdquo; With sudden emotion in his voice, Nicky added: &ldquo;I shall
  be unhappy when you&rsquo;ve gone. I&rsquo;d like to see those lost
  cathedrals. And if you won&rsquo;t have me, I can&rsquo;t think of anything
  else to do. Buenos Aires is just another place where I&rsquo;d be found out
  and fêted within a week.... You don&rsquo;t really mind if I come with you,
  do you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Byrne answered, after a long pause: &ldquo;I suppose I can&rsquo;t
  physically prevent you, but I strongly advise you not to come. You&rsquo;ll
  find it a tedious, hot, and probably unpleasant journey leading in the end to
  nowhere that you may think at all thrilling.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I want to come.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll certainly want to go back as soon as you get
  there.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, even so, I&rsquo;d still want to come.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s no stopping you, evidently.&rdquo; He smiled and
  added: &ldquo;For my part, of course, I shall be pleased to have your
  company.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They went ashore together and spent the rest of the day in necessary
  preparations. Most of Nicky&rsquo;s luggage was unsuitable for such a trip,
  and he had to make many purchases, among them being a revolver.</p>

  <p>Next day they began the journey upstream in the small white-funnelled
  steamer of the Argentine Navigation Company. Nicky was possessed by a deep
  tranquillity of mind that he could hardly account for; there was nothing much
  to see, and still less to do, yet the slowly unwinding panorama of grey water
  and green shore gave him a sense of having found at last some fragment of
  what, without knowing it, he had all along been seeking. Byrne was happy
  also, but with a more definite eagerness for the future; they talked a good
  deal during the warm, lazy hours, uneventful save for an occasional passing
  of villages and tobacco-plantations, or the glimpse of alligators basking in
  the shallows. The nights were less pleasant, with swarms of flies and
  mosquitoes that clustered about the electric globes; but the mornings, misty
  and delicate, were lovely preludes to the long, leisurely days. As the miles
  unfolded northward changes, imperceptible at first, became definitely
  noticeable; the narrowing of the river till it no longer seemed an endless
  lake, and the gradual merge of climate and scenery from temperate to
  sub-tropical. But there was something else less easy to define&mdash;­an
  atmosphere of deepening mystery suggested sometimes by a high tree visible in
  the distance, or a curving sun- hazy tributary wandering in from left or
  right. The sky at midday was more brazen; the vegetation thickened and
  paddled its roots more confidently into the stream; and the hot winds from
  the north came freighted with a curious flavour, subtle and even pleasing,
  yet less so if one were alone or had too much of it&mdash;­a hint of the vast
  crepuscular decay of the forests. Nor was it nature only that supplied the
  faintly sinister undertone, for soon the ship entered Paraguayan waters, and
  there could be seen the scarcely inhabited levels of that inland republic,
  with here and there, even after sixty years, reminders of a tragedy to which
  the history of no European nation affords a parallel&mdash;­a madman&rsquo;s
  war that killed more than half the entire population. The sun-blistered ruin
  of the church at Humaìta seemed a fitting symbol of bloodshed almost
  pathologically hideous.</p>

  <p>Soon, however, such darker memories were quenched in the idle charm of
  Asunçion. Here it was necessary to change vessels, and as the one proceeding
  farther upstream did not depart for a couple of days, Nicky and Byrne had a
  chance to explore the tree-shaded avenues and lounge in the open- air cafés.
  Nicky enjoyed this last taste of elegance; there was little that was ugly or
  blatant in the colourful, indolent civilisation. Even amongst shops and
  electric trams, there was a feeling of immensities near by, and at evening,
  in the cool patios, a certain wistfulness was imaginable, as of a city that
  remembered the Conquistadores.</p>

  <p>Seventeen days later, amidst the dusk of a thunderstorm that refused to
  break, Nicky and Byrne stepped off the launch that had brought them to
  Maramba.</p>

  <p>This Maramba, far from any railhead, and the end of river-navigability for
  anything larger than a canoe, was the point at which they must take to the
  land. It was scarcely a pleasant place. It represented, as Byrne had said,
  the frayed edges of civilisation, and also the equally frayed edges of
  barbarism; but the meeting was disappointingly unpicturesque. The town
  looked, as indeed it was, an outpost of an army that had partly given up the
  fight. A few clustered buildings rose up from the river-bank, and beyond
  them, on the higher levels, various constructions of timber and corrugated
  iron littered the scene as far as the dark semi-circle of jungle. The entire
  settlement could hardly have been posed more effectively as a symbol of
  defeat. Grass pushed between the cobbles of the quays; the stucco peeled off
  the houses in ochreous strips; and, to clinch the impression, a clearing
  beyond the town was heaped with rusting machinery, festooned already by
  undergrowth&mdash;­excavators and tip-waggons and a crane that upheaved above
  the jungle grass like some menacingly poised snake.</p>

  <p>But most evident of all to the few arrivals by the launch that afternoon
  was the heat. It was not ordinary heat. Nicky had been in India and the Red
  Sea without an experience of anything approaching it. It was a heat that
  seemed to have size and weight, to lean on the air like something actual and
  fleshly. The sky billowed with thunder-clouds, but the heat poured through
  them and met a deeper, angrier heat that rose like an emanation out of the
  earth itself.</p>

  <p>Even the proprietor of the single scorched hotel admitted that the weather
  was exceptional. He was a chocolate-eyed, dark-skinned Brazilian, who served
  them with beer on a sizzling verandah and showed amazement at their projected
  journey. Apparently the route had not been traversed for some years, and they
  must expect stretches of practically unexplored jungle, as well as casual
  encounters with jaguars, anacondas, and hostile Indians. All of which might
  have been perfectly well known to Byrne, judging by the way he received the
  information. After the man had gone, he said to Nicky: &ldquo;Well, I
  didn&rsquo;t exaggerate the unpleasantness of the trip, did I?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Nicky only smiled, and the smile returned him by the older man was a
  complete settlement of the matter. Throughout the long and less comfortable
  journey from Asunçion, their intimacy had ripened; they had talked less, but
  had reached deeper and more silent stages of friendship. Nicky&rsquo;s
  happiness had grown to be of a kind that discomfort hardly affected; he who
  in New York had been at the mercy of trivial annoyances, found that here, in
  this dark-hearted country, physical irritations, such as heat and
  mosquito-bites, were endurable by the body without clamouring to the brain
  for rage. And this, in some strange and hidden way, was due to Byrne. The man
  tranquillised his mind as women had sometimes tranquillised his
  body&mdash;­lent him deep reserves of security from some secret store. They
  never talked religion, nor did Byrne&rsquo;s attitude ever exceed the
  supposition that Nicky was a mere adventuring tourist, seeking new thrills
  which he must take the risk of not finding. Yet they found much in common,
  even on such a basis. Both had courage, Nicky of a sharp, excitable kind, and
  Byrne more implacably; they had shown this on an occasion during the river
  journey, when a piranha, freshly caught, had flapped about on deck. Nicky,
  with no experience of the small but madly voracious freshwater-fish, had not
  troubled to keep out of its way, and the tearing teeth had closed into his
  arm as he stooped over it. Byrne, ordering him to keep perfectly still, had
  then, with calm dexterity, pulled the jaws apart at the risk of having
  fingers bitten off. Afterwards they had laughed over the incident, but it had
  revealed to both of them a quality in each other which reassured.</p>

  <p>Nicky even contrived to be happy during that first sweltering evening at
  Maramba. It was likely to take a few days to make arrangements for continuing
  the journey on land, and the prospect of waiting in such a place was not
  outwardly pleasing. The hotel was dirty; the bedrooms reeked of stale, oily
  distillations; the food was bad; the mosquitoes proved to be of some new and
  fiercer variety; and over it all, scarcely less oppressive when night had
  fallen, was the heat. Yet the storm did not break. Mutterings could sometimes
  be heard in the distance, and the trees stirred fitfully in gusts of wind
  that were hotter than the stillness; there was a heavy smell in the air, that
  smell of rotting vegetation with which Nicky had already grown familiar, but
  here stiffened and coagulated. Another smell pervaded it intermittently, that
  of some faintly aromatic furnace; Nicky thought of forest-fires, but Byrne
  said that the forests were uncombustible&mdash;­that, in fact, being the
  great obstacle to colonisation. Suddenly, while they were talking in the
  hotel lobby, an extra whiff lent identity to the odour&mdash;­it was like
  burning coffee, Nicky decided. Later the proprietor told them that that was
  exactly what it was&mdash;­coffee being destroyed on the plantations because
  there was no market for it. He gave them also a long account of other local
  calamities&mdash;­of the English concessionaires who had hoped to obtain
  manganese and had left all their machinery behind after a year of fruitless
  operations, of tobacco-plantations abandoned by Jap settlers&mdash;­and that,
  he indicated, with an expressive shrug, was anywhere the last stigma of
  hopelessness. No, there was nothing in Maramba in these days. It had been
  different during the rubber boom, which he could remember as a
  boy&mdash;­those golden years when the trickle of wealth had poured over the
  Matto Grasso from the Xingu and the Tapajoz. But now there was nothing,
  except the declining river-trade and the small activities dependent upon the
  frontier garrison. As for this cursed weather, he had been in Maramba for
  twenty-five years, and did not think he could remember anything to equal
  it.</p>

  <p>Before turning in, Nicky strolled with Byrne about the streets, deserted
  and eerily brilliant in the almost continuous sheet-lightning. They stood on
  the quays by the shabby-magnificent customs-house and stared at the low line
  of jungle across the river&mdash;­ sinister even in the theatrical glare of
  the flashes. Once they saw a tarantula scampering, if that were the word,
  over some timber-stacks, its dark, leathery body compact of evil liveliness.
  Nicky was excited and wanted to approach the monster, but Byrne would not let
  him. &ldquo;There are some things best kept out of one&rsquo;s mind as long
  as possible,&rdquo; he said, with a close arm-grip. The thrill had set them
  both sweating heavily, and just at that moment, over the flat roofs, came the
  sound of a woman&rsquo;s shriek. Instantly, a rain of other sounds scattered
  after it&mdash;­cries of birds, voices in the distance, the bang of a sharply
  closed door. Then silence again. &ldquo;This is really a rather dreadful
  place,&rdquo; said Nicky, a little hysterically. &ldquo;Everything feels as
  if it&rsquo;s waiting for something to happen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It will be better after the storm,&rdquo; Byrne answered.</p>

  <p>After a short saunter they reached the hotel again. They slept badly; the
  mosquitoes were troublesome, and Nicky imagined tarantulas in the
  room&mdash;­perhaps it had been wise, after all, to have missed seeing the
  brute at closer quarters. The hours crawled through to morning, but the usual
  chill before dawn did not come, nor was the storm any nearer breaking.
  Indeed, the clouds seemed to have dissolved in readiness for the daylight,
  leaving behind them a thick steamy haze through which the sun shone as
  through soiled muslin. Even at breakfast it was far hotter than at any time
  during the previous day.</p>

  <p>As they lingered over cups of maté, they were visited by the
  customs-officer, a heavy-jowled, slouching fellow in a sweat-sodden uniform.
  He knew no English, and Byrne and he conversed in a stilted mixture of
  Spanish and Portuguese. There was a hitch at first owing to the fact that
  Nicky had grown a beard that did not appear in his passport photograph, but
  this was eventually explained, and with many bowings and clinkings of glasses
  the man became quite cordial. Byrne questioned him about porterage, and
  received, after expressions of astonishment at the proposed journey, a
  promise to have ready a few likely applicants, if he would call at the
  customs-house later in the morning. Byrne said he would, which was the signal
  for further civilities and bottles of lukewarm beer. As the officer left, he
  said something with great vehemence which Byrne afterwards, with a smile,
  translated as: &ldquo;He says he thinks it&rsquo;s going to be a rather hot
  day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They wilted back into chairs in the shuttered hotel parlour and tried to
  ignore the glare that burst through the slats. It was easier not to move; the
  mere exchange of words and sentences evoked fresh streams of perspiration
  from every pore; and the thought of the customs-officer crossing those
  blazing pavements to the quay-side was oppressive even to the inward eye that
  pictured the scene. There were no sounds of life in the hotel, or in the
  street outside, or in the whole town, for that matter. Yet, beneath the still
  and utterly silent surface, there was a sense of brooding, of life that was
  not extinct, but drugged into unconsciousness between the answering heats of
  earth and sky. Byrne read a book, but Nicky preferred to sit motionlessly
  pondering. How curious, it might be thought, that anyone in his right mind
  should deliberately leave civilised luxury for a place like this! It was
  madness, perhaps, and if so, it must be a greater madness for him to be
  eager, as he was, to push on, deeper and farther into this merciless country,
  with Byrne. He was puzzled to decide what it was that chiefly attracted him
  in the man&mdash;­it must be more, he thought, than his half-reluctant
  friendliness and calm intelligence. A kind of sureness, perhaps, that he
  had&mdash;­sureness of background, of being in a tradition, something that
  made Nicky feel that he himself was not so much sharing an adventure with a
  man as marching with an army on a crusade.</p>

  <p>Towards midday Byrne said he must go over and see the customs-officer, as
  he had promised; but he insisted on going alone. Nicky was by no means
  anxious to face the heat, yet as soon as Byrne had gone he wished desperately
  that he had gone with him. He felt suddenly afraid, with a renewal of
  perception that all was not lifeless as it seemed. He sat for a few moments,
  found he could no longer endure the waiting, and then strolled into the hotel
  lobby. He was shivering slightly, and wondered if he were falling ill; the
  hall-floor, as well as his legs, appeared to quiver as he approached the
  street. Seen from inside, the doorway was a slab of yellow, sickly to the
  eye; but as soon as he entered the glare he felt a new and more fearful
  nausea, for the sky above the opposite roofs was no longer even white, but an
  angry, opaque carnelian.</p>

  <p>He stood there, increasingly spellbound by dread, while the whole world
  seemed poised for some uniquely terrible reckoning. Then all at once there
  began a distant growling that came rapidly nearer like the roar of a train
  crossing a metal bridge at full speed. He was so puzzled by it that he was
  scarcely able to be astonished when he saw, a few yards away across the
  street, a length of parapet toppling from a first-floor balcony. It fell with
  such disarming grace, and so soundlessly amidst the greater noise, that the
  dust- cloud spraying upwards from the smashed stucco seemed no more than
  necessary proof that the thing had really happened. Not even yet could he
  think of a reason for both the roar and the fallen parapet, and his
  perplexity held him aloof from fear until, with a shudder of foreboding, the
  truth rushed at him, and with it also a sight incredibly
  grotesque&mdash;­that of the houses opposite waving like banners, and a hole
  widening in the roadway as if it were being munched by some enormous and
  invisible mouth. Then he was struck between the eyes, and staggered
  back....</p>

  <p>... When he recovered consciousness he began to cough and vomit. Behind
  the clouds of blinding, acrid smoke that swirled about him, patches of
  copper- hot sky could be seen; the time, from the look of it, was
  mid-afternoon. Timber and masonry surrounded him in a soaring jumble, but
  though he felt dazed and ill, he did not think that he had been seriously
  hurt, if at all. His arms were movable; he could feel his cigarettes and
  revolver still in his pocket. He stirred his legs carefully from under a beam
  that had fallen miraculously short of crushing them; they were stiff, but
  after a few moments he could drag himself upright and climb a heap of debris
  to survey a little more of the catastrophe. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he kept
  thinking, as he strove to regain his numbed senses, &ldquo;now you know what
  an earthquake is like.&rdquo;...</p>

  <p>Then he thought of Byrne and began to clamber amongst the litter in
  impulsive search for his friend. But of course, as he soon reflected, the
  priest wouldn&rsquo;t be anywhere near the hotel; he had gone down to the
  quay- side to visit the customs-officer. Nicky scrambled a few yards over a
  pyramid of brickwork and caught sight of what looked to be a large red-violet
  flower growing amidst the rubble. As he approached, the violet spurted out in
  all directions, leaving the red by itself, and he saw then what it really
  was&mdash;­the shambled body of a man, with flies above it, waiting to re-
  settle. He felt sick again, and shook his head vaguely as the cries of
  wounded came to him from left and right. As fast as he could he hastened over
  the ruins Co the river-front. He must look for Byrne first. He saw a few
  uninjured or slightly injured persons on the way, but they stared at him with
  half-crazed eyes as he passed them by. He reached the customs-house at
  last&mdash;­a mountain of rubbish enclosed by jagged sections of wall. There
  were several bodies near by, but nowhere that of Byrne. Then he discovered
  that his hair was clotted with blood, and that blood was also streaming from
  his left arm. Queer, that was; he hadn&rsquo;t felt any pain. He sank down to
  rest for a moment, but the sun flared before his eyes and he felt the world
  re-vanishing....</p>

  <p>... When he recovered consciousness a second time it was night, and there
  was a full moon in the crimsoned sky. He heard the river lapping near him; he
  felt thirsty, and dragged himself a few yards forward to scoop the water into
  his hands. Refreshed after that, he stood up, breathing the hot, smoky air,
  and saw that sporadic fires had broken out over the ravaged town. Again, in
  the face of this new peril, his thought was of Byrne. But his choked lungs
  and smarting eyes led hint instinctively away from the vortex to the outer
  ring of the inferno. Byrne, alive or dead, might be anywhere here. He
  clambered over some wreckage, and as he did so there came a curious tinkling
  sound from his feet. &ldquo;Good God, what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he whispered,
  aloud, and was no less amazed when a cackling laugh answered him and a voice
  followed it with: &ldquo;You play tune, betcherlife, heh?&rdquo; Then he saw
  that his feet had touched the keys of a half-smashed piano, and that a few
  yards away a face regarded him with a wide and glittering smile. It was an
  ugly face, sagging and pewter-coloured in the moonlight, but at that moment
  Nicky was glad to see it. &ldquo;Hullo, John,&rdquo; he said, grinning back.
  &ldquo;You one of the lucky ones, too?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But the Chinese, though possessing a smattering of English, did not appear
  to comprehend. He merely continued to smile, jerking his thumb in the
  direction of the town, and chattering: &ldquo;Betcherlife, all velly dead
  there, heh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Nicky nodded, and was about to pass on when the man strode towards him and
  gripped his arm. &ldquo;You want drink, heh?&rdquo; He produced a flask and
  offered it, with his smile still broadening.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; Nicky swallowed the raw spirit without a second
  invitation. It was good, and he felt grateful. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a
  sportsman, John,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>But the Chinese would not let him go at that. He hovered about, muttering
  and grinning; his English was insufficient to explain the extent of his own
  share in the general tragedy, but Nicky guessed that, like himself, he might
  be searching the ruins for someone he had known. Nicky felt a keen desire to
  show sympathy and friendliness, or at least appreciation of the drink, but
  all he could think of was to perform the comic pantomime of smacking his lips
  and rubbing his stomach. The Chinese cackled delightedly. There was a sense
  in which the very enormity of the catastrophe all around them imposed this
  infantile good humour upon the survivors. The springs of the mind were
  numbed, and behind the numbness one could be companionable, even jocular. The
  Chinese was evidently in such a mood, and Nicky found it easy and pleasant to
  respond. He had nothing to offer in return for the drink except a few
  cigarettes that had been badly crumpled in his pocket, but the gift proved
  highly acceptable. The Chinese produced matches, and they leaned together
  amicably over the flame. &ldquo;Now we go looksee together, heh,
  betcherlife!&rdquo; he gabbled, puffing ecstatically.</p>

  <p>They entered thus upon a sort of half-comprehended partnership in the
  search of the locality. If either of them found a body he would call the
  other&rsquo;s attention to it, and even in waning moonlight it was easy for
  Nicky to decide that none of them could possibly be that of the priest. The
  task of the Chinese was naturally more difficult, for there had been many of
  his compatriots in Maramba and precise identification could not always be
  easy. In several instances he had to examine articles in pockets before he
  could pass on with his quest still unfulfilled. During those hours of
  probings and ransackings Nicky came quite to like his companion; the man was
  so unfailingly jolly, despite the grimness of their joint occupation.
  Sometimes they paused to light fresh cigarettes, and once the Chinese offered
  another swig of the harsh, but exceedingly heartening, spirit. Nicky wished
  they could talk, but he had discovered that the other knew even less English
  than had appeared at first&mdash;­his phrases being more expletive than
  meaningful. Still, it was company to have the fellow so near, humming and
  muttering as he paddled up to his knees in crumbled stucco. The glow over the
  higher parts of the town was fiercer now....</p>

  <p>Suddenly there sounded a sharp cry, and a man in uniform, hatless, but
  carrying a revolver, came lunging towards them, apparently from nowhere.
  Nicky could not comprehend a word of his voluble shouts, but felt
  instinctively that the advance was both frenzied and hostile. The man
  approached to within a few yards, continuing to shout; while Nicky waited for
  him, unable to decide whether it would be worth while to shout back in any of
  the languages that he knew. A sense of the growing absurdity of the situation
  overspread him, together with regret that he had not learned a few simple
  phrases in whatever tongue was spoken by uniformed ruffians in Maramba after
  an earthquake. There were times, and this was one, when his mind seemed to
  stand a little way off from his body and stare quizzically at a spectacle for
  which it did not care to accept responsibility.</p>

  <p>Abruptly the oncomer swung round and transferred his shouts to the
  Chinese, who&mdash;­with tact rather than courage, Nicky thought&mdash;­was
  slinking away. Soon the Chinese broke into a scamper, and at that the other
  raised his revolver and fired after him instantly.</p>

  <p>This had an extraordinary effect on Nicky. He heard the Chinese yelp as he
  was hit, and saw him stagger on with a hand held to his thigh. He saw the man
  in uniform raise his weapon to fire again, and at that moment the clench of
  his own fingers in his pocket reminded him that he was armed himself. And he
  was swept with a raw, overpowering indignation. As if there had not been
  enough killing. As if there were not enough agony and mutilation amongst
  these blood- drenched ruins. All the horrors he had seen during the past
  night and day were seen again, far more vividly, in that glimpse of a
  Chinaman&rsquo;s pain; because it was something so needless, heaped so
  maddeningly on what had had to happen. He found it unendurable, this
  comprehension of the lust and wantonness of things; he yelled as the man was
  about to fire again; then, in sheer illogical rage, he drew his own revolver
  and pointed it.</p>

  <p>The man&rsquo;s eyes and hand swerved together; and two further shots,
  nearly simultaneous, rang out over the moon-grey desolation.</p>

  <p>They lay there, the three of them, Nicky and the uniformed man quite close
  together, and the Chinese about a dozen yards away, where he had fallen.
  Nicky had shot his assailant dead, and the latter, who had fired only a
  second earlier, had struck the youth in the groin. He felt little actual
  pain, merely a hot, numbing weariness as he drew breath. He did not fear that
  his injury was serious, but he knew, without making the effort, that he could
  not move away unaided. Something confusing had been done to his inside by
  that bullet, he reckoned. He would have to wait till somebody found him, and
  the curious thing was that he had full confidence that somebody would.
  Probably already there were armies of rescuers on the way&mdash;­wasn&rsquo;t
  that what always happened after these big disasters? President Hoover would
  send a warship, and the League of Nations would vote condolences. Police,
  doctors, nurses, Y.M.C.A., all sorts of people would soon begin to arrive.
  Also soldiers, firemen, ambulance-men, insurance-assessors, journalists,
  photographers, government officials, seismologists&mdash;­the whole crowd
  would be here shortly....</p>

  <p>He turned to the dead man near him. Quite dead. A very small patch of
  blood stained the tunic over his left breast, that was all. People would call
  that a mighty good shot, by Jove, yes. It was the first man he had ever
  killed, though once before, in Russia, he had aimed at someone and missed.
  And the joke of it was that in this case he hadn&rsquo;t aimed at all; he
  hadn&rsquo;t really meant to fire even; everything had happened so damned
  quickly.</p>

  <p>He wondered who the man was. He could not see clearly; the moon had gone
  down. But the first smear of dawn was in the eastern sky, like a
  child&rsquo;s breath on a window-pane; he would be able to see everything
  soon. There was still that smell of smoke and burning coffee in the air, and
  the Chinese was howling softly, like a dog outside a closed door.
  &ldquo;Hello, John,&rdquo; Nicky cried, and was surprised to hear his own
  voice diminished to a whisper.</p>

  <p>What a piece of work was man, indeed! And what a still greater piece of
  work was a bullet! No marvel of physical excellence, no superbity of brain or
  character, could stand against that exquisite fragment of metal. Shakespeare,
  Cervantes, Galileo, Mohammed, Goethe, Mozart, Rembrandt, Michelangelo, the
  whole who&rsquo;s-who parade of history, could all be mown down with a
  machine- gun in a few minutes.</p>

  <p>He wondered what had happened to Byrne. Dead, probably. He had liked that
  man. There had been some point in knowing him. That was the drawback to most
  intimacies; you came to like people, you got wildly keen about them, and then
  suddenly realised that you had wasted a lot of energy over emotions that
  didn&rsquo;t matter. But knowing Byrne hadn&rsquo;t been like that. Indeed,
  it was as if, in knowing him, one had been on the brink of knowing something
  else....</p>

  <p>It was lighter now, and he could see the Chinese quite clearly against the
  rosy-tinted sky. The man was lying on his face, and his pockets had
  emptied&mdash;­there were coins and purses and a watch and chain. Queer
  fellows, Chinamen; but this one had been all right. Nicky wished there were
  still enough in the flask for another drink for both of them.</p>

  <p>He kept remembering things he thought he had almost forgotten&mdash;­that
  scene, for instance, in the Odessa restaurant that might just as well have
  ended in his being shot there and then as here and now. And if he had been,
  if that Soviet Commissar had killed him, in what strange ways the world would
  have been minutely different&mdash;­no gyrector experiments in England, no
  &ldquo;Red Desert&rdquo; at Sabinal, no &ldquo;Raphael Rassova&rdquo;
  anywhere. And so also, supposing he were now to die, a thousand other remote
  and unreckonable things would be withdrawn from possibility. What clue was
  there, or wasn&rsquo;t there any, to this mystic template of men and
  bullets?</p>

  <p>He looked at the dead man, clear-outlined now in the growing daylight; a
  big fellow, with terrific moustaches, and revealed, by a glance at his
  uniform, as just a simple soldier&mdash;­probably one of the local frontier
  garrison. On guard? Patrolling? Watching for smugglers across the border?
  Then suddenly the idea came.... Good God, it wasn&rsquo;t contraband the
  fellow had suspected, but looting! He had seen the two of them poking about
  the wreckage in the middle of the night, and had taken them for thieves! Why,
  certainly, it was a likely theory, the likeliest of all, for it explained why
  he had fired so promptly when the Chinese made to run away.</p>

  <p>As Nicky digested the revelation he was filled with a bemused tenderness
  that included now both the Chinese and the dead soldier. So it had all, then,
  been a mistake, a pardonable misunderstanding, nobody&rsquo;s fault but that
  of the bullets for boring so fast and so far? If he and the soldier had had
  only sticks in their hands, they would now be apologising to each other for
  bruises instead of draining their blood into the dust. And the thought came
  to him that if ever, some day, mankind should invent a machine big and
  powerful enough to destroy the whole world, it would probably be touched off
  in just such casual error. He wished he could bring the dead man back to
  life, if only to talk to him about it, and he would have liked to shout, if
  his voice had been strong enough: &ldquo;I say, John, this fellow thought we
  were a couple of looters&mdash;­that&rsquo;s why he was so ready with his
  gun!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And then another thought occurred, of such benign simplicity that he
  accepted it with astonishment that it had come only so late. The Chinaman was
  a looter. Why, of course, he must be. The way he had been searching the
  pockets of the victims, and that fine collection of swag that lay beside him
  now, spilled from his pockets. Nicky found himself wanting to smile.
  &ldquo;John, you old rogue,&rdquo; he cried to himself, &ldquo;you took me in
  all right. Reckon I was dazed with that knock on the head, or I&rsquo;d have
  spotted your game!&rdquo; Then he looked at the Chinese, who had ceased to
  yelp and was lying quite still; and he suddenly knew that he was dead.</p>

  <p>The sun rose, comforting at first, but soon too hot to the throat and
  lips; a drink was all that he really wanted now. In the sunlight he saw what
  he had missed before&mdash;­a stream of his own blood, seeping away from his
  side across a large flat stone. The stream moved slowly, replenished from the
  wound, but the stone was warm and the blood readily congealed. He thought,
  watching it: &ldquo;If it gets to the edge, I shall die; if it doesn&rsquo;t,
  I shall live.&rdquo; That made everything so much easier to understand. It
  was a faith, anyhow, a philosophy, a theory of the universe, cause and effect
  linked together no more illogically than in the long, invisible chain of
  human destiny. He went on watching: a slight stir of his body lent a swell to
  the viscous tide; it rolled faster for a while, a red, advancing caterpillar.
  And he thought, with certitude: &ldquo;I am dying by inches... literally by
  those inches.&rdquo; ...</p>

  <p>Then his brain, that had always been poised hawk-like over words, swooped
  down and gave him the answer: &ldquo;Yes, but I have lived by miles.&rdquo;
  ...</p>

  <p>The phrase pleased him and made him able to absorb more calmly the gusts
  and cyclones of pain as they now assaulted. He closed his eyes and wondered
  if he could sleep. The stream must nearly have reached the edge by now, but
  he wouldn&rsquo;t bother to look.</p>

  <p>Then, at the last, he suddenly remembered Sylvia.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap6"
     id="chap6">CHAPTER SIX. &mdash; LEON MIRSKY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Leon Mirsky rode into Maramba on a white horse five days
  after the second earthquake had completed the ruin of the town. He was a
  tall, thin, and ascetic- looking person, with a face remarkable for two
  things&mdash;­its smoke- grey, deep-set eyes, and a fair, girlish skin that
  even the climate of tropical South America had not yet impaired.
  High-cheekboned and slender-nostriled, he had an air of rather unsure
  aloofness, as if he did not quite know what to make of anything; and he
  certainly did not know what to make of the Maramba earthquake.</p>

  <p>The only son of pre-Revolution aristocrats, he had reached the New World
  from Russia in 1919, after typical experiences. A little money saved from the
  wreck had enabled him to settle down and acquire American citizenship; and
  for ten fairly comfortable years, darkened only by memories, he had lived in
  a quiet part of New York and established a minor reputation as a poet and
  writer of highbrow art criticism. He had been for a time engaged to an
  heiress, but she had broken it off, with no greater effect than to make him
  write a rather foolish novel, satirising women in general, which no one had
  wanted to publish. His art criticism, however, was good, and he had written a
  pleasant little book on El Greco. Then in 1929 had come his second
  revolution&mdash;­and perhaps quite as unsettling as the first, for he was
  twelve years older, and more deeply grooved. It was a financial one; his
  small income, derived from investments in apparently cast-iron stocks,
  dwindled rapidly to less than half, forcing him to face the immediate
  necessity of earning a living. Journalism naturally occurred to him, and at
  first he had nourished a secret confidence that any of the great American
  dailies would snap him up with eagerness. A few months had taught him
  differently, and at length, through friendship with a proprietor and a slight
  knowledge of Portuguese, he had obtained the post of newspaper-correspondent
  in Rio. He had been in Rio a week, without finding anything to write about
  except the development of baroque design in Brazilian architecture, when news
  came of the earthquake and he had almost simultaneously received a cable from
  New York to proceed to Maramba at once and send reports.</p>

  <p>Hence his somewhat anxious look as he came upon the scene of ruin after a
  fantastically unpleasant journey. &ldquo;What our average reader
  wants,&rdquo; the newspaper-owner had told him, with impressive warning,
  &ldquo;is news that he can digest between stops in a crowded subway-car,
  while he holds the paper in one hand, strap-hangs with the other, and uses up
  eighty per cent of his limited intelligence in sub-consciously thinking of
  something else. Remember that his mental age is about twelve, so that he
  can&rsquo;t understand anything difficult, doesn&rsquo;t like long words or
  sentences, and simply won&rsquo;t have highbrow stuff at any price. So for
  God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t be too clever. Write things that are just clever
  enough for him to think how clever he is for managing to see the point of
  them. And, above all, go for the human note. People aren&rsquo;t naturally
  interested in cathedral stained-glass, for instance, but if a window-cleaner
  were to fall through some and cut his head off, then I reckon they might
  be&mdash;­for about a couple of days. You see what I mean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mirsky was not quite sure, and his anxieties quickened as he engaged
  accommodation in a corrugated-iron shelter that had been hastily improvised
  as a sort of residential press-club. He was not, of course, the only
  journalist in Maramba. On the contrary, the place seemed full of
  them&mdash;­dark-skinned Brazilians and Argentines, a few Americans, and one
  very gnarled Scotsman from Reuter&rsquo;s. A few had come by air, but most,
  like himself, had made the trip from Rio on train and horseback. They were
  all rather noisily companionable, but though he tried to fraternise, he was
  aware that he was not their type, and that they knew it as well as he
  did.</p>

  <p>Well, what could he cable his paper about the earthquake, anyway? The
  hurrying subway-crowds knew already that there had been one, that Maramba was
  somewhere in South America, and that therefore, in a sense, the whole thing
  was pure nonsense and didn&rsquo;t matter. Their interest, accordingly, would
  be strictly regulated by the degree to which he could awaken their
  humanitarian impulses. He could imagine his friend the proprietor saying:
  &ldquo;Sob- stories, my boy&mdash;­that&rsquo;s what we want. Talk to the
  survivors. Get them to tell you what happened to THEM. Some little yarn about
  the faithful dog still howling above the ruins, or prisoners from the local
  jail who did heroic rescue-work.&rdquo; ...</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, to detail but one of the many negations that awaited,
  Maramba didn&rsquo;t appear to have possessed a jail. Nor, when he began to
  interview survivors, did he obtain anything that seemed worth cabling to New
  York at so many cents a word. (Incidentally, he couldn&rsquo;t cable from
  Maramba; the lines were down, and the nearest accepting-office was at Harama,
  two days&rsquo; horseback-journey away.) Perhaps the trouble was partly his
  Portuguese, which proved slighter than ever now that he had left Rio; but
  doubtless also it was in his manner, which was too academic to adjust itself
  readily to such tragic intimacies.</p>

  <p>Still, he must cable something&mdash;­that was obvious. He was, indeed,
  quite apprehensively keen to justify himself, since if he failed to do so he
  could expect to be recalled pretty quickly, and it would be hard to find
  another job of any kind. He had a sister living in France who earned just
  enough money as a music-teacher to keep herself; but he had no other near
  relatives, and no distant ones that were not in as tough a position as
  himself. So he must, it was clear, discover the exact angle from which
  earthquake-news would catch the eye of Manhattan.</p>

  <p>On his second day at Maramba he interviewed the chief of the militarised
  police that had been sent to maintain order in the afflicted area. Already
  Mirsky had discovered that here, as in Russia, officials were not above being
  paid for their information, and in this case a fairly large tip purchased the
  usual garrulous but almost entirely unprofitable conversation. Keeping the
  human factor well in mind, he asked how many persons were believed to have
  perished in the catastrophe, and the chief replied that the bodies already
  found numbered between two and three thousand, most of them probably victims
  of the second quake, which had been much more severe than the first. Mirsky
  continued to cross-examine, but when he asked (perhaps not so tactfully) if
  the death-roll had included any important personages, the chief of police
  threw up his arms with a gesture of irritation and answered: &ldquo;My God,
  yes, the King of England and Jack Dempsey, naturally! Whom did you expect to
  find in Maramba during the hot season? Three thousand bodies, man&mdash;­do
  you think we have had time to carve all their names on tombstones yet? But
  yes, you shall certainly see things for yourself. It is not a pretty sight,
  but you shall see it, since you are so interested. This permit will admit you
  to the mortuaries.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It is not always easy to detect the note of irony in a foreign language,
  which was no doubt the reason why, a few moments later, Mirsky allowed
  himself to be ushered into an adjoining shed well-guarded by soldiers. Bodies
  were still being carried in, while numerous officials were hard at work on
  their various gruesome tasks. The disaster had been so complete that whole
  families had perished, and there were comparatively few uninjured survivors
  to assist in identifying the victims. It was a memorably unpleasant sight,
  that long, gloomy shed, and after a few seconds inside it Mirsky suspected
  the rather macabre trick that had been played on him. He had seen horrors in
  Russia, but nothing quite so concentrated as this. His fastidiousness was
  revolted, and he was just about to leave as quickly as possible when his
  attention was drawn to one of the bodies by reason of its more than averagely
  elegant clothing. Even beneath blood and dust, the shimmer of silk was
  noticeable, and silk shirts were doubtless rare in Maramba.</p>

  <p>The body was that of a youngish man with a dark, stubbly beard. The feet
  and the lower part of the trunk had been badly crushed, but the head was
  unhurt. Near by, in a neat pile, lay the contents of the pockets, ready for
  subsequent identification; they included cigarettes, a wallet, and a smashed
  compass-watch of obviously expensive make. Not quite the possessions of an
  average Maramban. Mirsky picked up the wallet; the maker&rsquo;s stamp gave
  an address in Los Angeles. An American victim, then? Was it possible that he
  had discovered something to cable about at last? Without further hesitation
  he looked at what was inside the wallet and found a Roumanian passport issued
  to one Nicholas Palescu. He raised his eyebrows over that, for the name
  conveyed something to him, though he could not immediately think how or
  what.</p>

  <p>Then he recollected that a friend of his in California, a Russian film-
  producer, had written to him recently about a young Roumanian whose real name
  was Palescu, and who had achieved sudden success in the cinema-world as
  &ldquo;Raphael Rassova.&rdquo; Raphael Rassova! Mirsky rather prided himself
  on film-ignorance, but even he had heard of that meteor-ascent into fame.
  Rassova! Was it possible? Though why on earth should the fellow have grown a
  beard and been visiting Maramba?</p>

  <p>Anyhow, if it were so, if Rassova really had been killed in the
  earthquake, it would assuredly be a tremendous piece of news to cable
  exclusively to the paper&mdash;­a heaven-sent journalistic scoop, indeed. But
  WAS it true?</p>

  <p>By the time he left the mortuary-shed, Mirsky had almost satisfied himself
  that it was. Apart from the passport, which was fairly conclusive evidence in
  itself, there were papers in the wallet showing that their owner had lately
  sailed from New York. There was also a gold-tipped cigarette-holder
  monogrammed &ldquo;R. R.&rdquo; So many pure coincidences were nearly
  unthinkable, and complete finality seemed established when, at a later
  meeting with the Scotsman from Reuter&rsquo;s, Mirsky led the talk to films
  and remarked: &ldquo;By the way, I wonder what that fellow Rassova will do
  next? He made a great hit recently with that Indian picture.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Scotsman was delighted to prove himself better-informed. &ldquo;The
  last I heard was that he&rsquo;d gone off to the Argentine. He soon had
  enough of the Seydel woman. Funny thing, that woman can&rsquo;t keep
  husbands&mdash;­or else, maybe she don&rsquo;t want to. Rassova was her
  fourth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Mirsky was not interested in these glimpses into Rassova&rsquo;s life;
  all he was concerned with was his death, which he now deemed himself to have
  settled. It had been an amazing piece of luck, and it was up to him now to
  exploit it to the full. He must, then, set out for Harama immediately and
  despatch the cable. Unfortunately, just as he was about to begin the arduous
  journey, news came of the bursting of the Orica dam. This further disaster,
  resulting from the earthquake stresses, had the effect of cutting all
  communications between Harama and the east; and there was likely to be a
  week&rsquo;s delay before the telegraph-line could be restored. Learning
  this, a few of the journalists flew back to Rio, but Mirsky, though he made
  several offers, could not negotiate for the air-trip with them.</p>

  <p>Not being by nature a man of action, he was the more impetuous now that he
  had decided on doing something. He felt that his whole future depended on
  getting his message through to New York, and that fate, having put the chance
  of a lifetime in his way, was being particularly malign in depriving him of
  it by means of a dam-burst. For delay was dangerous, since at any time the
  identity of the dead youth might be discovered and the whole story become
  common property. Mirsky felt irritated to desperation as he sat drinking beer
  in a shanty which was all that Maramba now possessed in the way of an hotel.
  The weather was hot, food and lodging were unpleasant, everything was
  fabulously expensive, nor was it by any means certain that the earthquakes
  had finished their activities. He stared disconsolately at his pocket-map, on
  which Maramba wanted a good deal of finding. Harama, being at railhead,
  appeared more conspicuously, and the Orica dam, presumably, was in the hills
  a few miles to the north. Whichever way one looked at it, Maramba was
  awkwardly placed. Then suddenly, from the map, the notion came to him that
  there must surely be other ways of egress to civilisation. After all, it
  didn&rsquo;t matter whence he sent his cable, provided he sent it. Could he
  not engage someone to transport him downstream to the nearest
  river-settlement that had a telegraph-office?</p>

  <p>He spent an hour in fruitless enquiries on the debris-littered water-
  front, and only gave up the idea when he found that no place on the river
  nearer than Asunçion possessed a telegraph-line that did not pass through
  Harama.</p>

  <p>Then he looked at the map again, and the final but very obvious
  alternative came to him. Why, in all these plans for getting the news
  through, should he only have thought of the country to the EAST of the river?
  Wouldn&rsquo;t a western journey do equally well? With a thrill of
  satisfaction, and in some amazement that he had not thought of it before, he
  found on the map a place called San Cristobal that was scarcely further in
  the one direction than Harama was in the other. And San Cristobal, moreover,
  was the terminus of a railway leading to the Andean uplands, so that it was
  sure to have the telegraph.</p>

  <p>It looked about eighty miles or so, measured roughly with the finger, and
  he reckoned on three or four days for that&mdash;­perhaps less if the country
  proved easy going.</p>

  <p>Leon Mirsky would have been called a man of imagination, but he had
  omitted to imagine South America. Till a fortnight before, he had never set
  eyes on it, and his journey up from Rio had not impressed him with much more
  than the extreme tiresomeness of the country. Actually, when he had crossed
  the river from Maramba, he thought himself lucky in that the path immediately
  plunged into the forest.</p>

  <p>He had told no one of his plan to reach San Cristobal, thinking that if he
  did he might be delayed by enforced companions. He had taken, of course, all
  obvious precautions&mdash;­he carried a revolver and a shot-gun, as well as
  food and tobacco sufficient for several days. He had also, amongst other
  articles, a pocket-compass, a map which merely gave the names of the two
  places, with no hint of the kind of country between; and a small edition of
  Theocritus. With this equipment, and a water-bottle to fill from wayside
  streams, he thought he had remembered everything.</p>

  <p>He must have looked a rather striking figure as he cantered those first
  pleasant miles. No doubt some of the Jesuit fathers, trekking along that same
  forest-path two centuries before, had worn a similar aspect, that of the
  scholar-adventurer; but the Jesuits did not travel alone. Mirsky, however,
  was inclined to be especially happy for that very reason. He had always lived
  a rather solitary life, and he could always thoroughly enjoy his own thoughts
  and introspections. As he pushed his way on through the suave green tunnel,
  with the gathering sunlight scarcely visible above the tree-tops, he felt
  quite entranced with the prospect before him. He was not much of a
  nature-worshipper, but he perceived that nature here was certainly at her
  best and liveliest. He gave her, as it were, full marks and a nod of
  approval, feeling that she would do very nicely as a background to his
  satisfying emotions during the next few days. And perhaps when he DID get his
  sensational message through to New York it would still further add to his
  credit that he had performed this journey as a romantic prelude. Yes, he felt
  particularly serene as he appraised this shaded loveliness after the hot,
  dust-blown ruins of Maramba, and his own silences after the friendly but
  foolish conversation of his fellow- journalists.</p>

  <p>And his scoop would be a memorable one. He pictured the placards:
  &ldquo;Raphael Rassova Killed in Earthquake. ... Sensational Discovery at
  Maramba.... Our Special Correspondent&rsquo;s Graphic Cable....&rdquo; Yes,
  this business would certainly establish his reputation, and it mattered to
  him tremendously that it should. Yet there was another sense in which he was
  quite certain it did not matter at all. Cinemas and cheap journalism and all
  that stuff&mdash;­it wasn&rsquo;t art&mdash;­a single square millimetre from
  a canvas by Ribuera or Morales was worth all the celluloid in Hollywood. He
  was, indeed, in the position of a man desperately trying to score a goal in a
  game he rather despised. But there was no doubt of the desperation. It was
  nourished by a private conceit that made him anxious to show how easily a man
  of higher intelligence could succeed at a job that was really beneath him.
  This chasing of news, this seeing of everything from the &ldquo;human&rdquo;
  standpoint, this persistent titivation of the mental palate of the
  multitude&mdash;­it was all confusing at first to any man of culture, because
  he couldn&rsquo;t bring himself down to its level; but when and if he did,
  why, it became child&rsquo;s play.</p>

  <p>Mirsky was a highbrow by disposition. Born amidst a society that had since
  collapsed, he was sincerely convinced that the inroads of democracy upon the
  aristocratic principle had been the inroads of the new barbarism upon
  civilisation. The world of 1931 seemed to him full of proofs of
  this&mdash;­so full, indeed, that he had long given up contemplating them.
  The most resounding proof, to himself, was naturally the personal
  one&mdash;­that here he was, forced to do quite ridiculous things to earn a
  living, when all the time there was in him the capacity to write a great book
  on Spanish painting, or perhaps a few sonnets. His demands, surely, were not
  excessive&mdash;­a roof over his head, food, clothing, a few cultured
  luxuries&mdash;­in dollars equal to perhaps a hundredth part of the earnings
  of this Rassova fellow, whose death was to plunge so many millions in
  despair. Yet the world, to whom Spanish painting and sonnets were much less
  important than a film-star&rsquo;s eyelashes, would not yield him even that
  minimum tribute. In an aristocratic society, of course, all that would have
  been different; he would either have had money himself, or would have found a
  patron. An excellent system, he considered, under which the arts had
  flourished as perhaps never under any other. His own family had themselves
  been patrons of such a kind during pre-Revolution days; which seemed to
  indicate a double loss to the world as a result of their downfall.</p>

  <p>But Mirsky, though a highbrow and an artist, was by no means devoid of
  robuster qualities. It was merely that, unless he were compelled, he did not
  bring them into use. He was a good shot, for instance, but he did not care
  for the more murderous forms of sport; and though his body was strong and in
  good condition, this was through careful living rather than any attention to
  athletics. Perhaps also he had a little more than the average man&rsquo;s
  personal courage.</p>

  <p>He needed it, even during that first morning in the forest. Suddenly, in
  the midst of his comfortably meandering thoughts, his horse started violently
  beneath him, stopped dead, and began to quake with fear. He patted the animal
  reassuringly, but without effect; the shivering continued, though, so far as
  he could take in at a rapid survey, there was no reason for it. The vista of
  dark green thickets festooned with trailing lianes was quite unchanged from
  similar scenes that he had been traversing for some hours. There was
  certainly, now that movement of man and beast had stopped, a curious
  tenseness in the air, and a hint, more than a statement, of the terrific heat
  that was pouring on the tree-tops a few dozen feet above. And a hum of
  insects filled the silence, as of a million small instruments tuning up for a
  symphony. But otherwise everything seemed to Mirsky quite unremarkable.</p>

  <p>All at once, however, there came from somewhere in front a faint,
  slithering rustle, and his heart gave an immediate jump, for not more than a
  score yards away, in outline scarcely to be seen against the background of
  undergrowth, there appeared an enormous snake. Its flat, spoon-like head
  swayed with nonchalant grace about a man&rsquo;s height above the ground,
  while its body, thickening and thinning as it drew itself forward, showed yet
  no visible ending.</p>

  <p>The tremors of the horse were verging now on pitiful collapse. Mirsky
  tried to coax the animal to turn tail and run, but it would not stir; it was
  almost hypnotised. The blood was pulsing in his own veins quite as
  disturbingly, and as he stared at the advancing monster, with its glittering
  eyes and wide, drooling jaws, he felt a swift sympathy with the beast beneath
  him as well as a spasm of personal panic. He knew very little about reptiles,
  except that not all were poisonous, and that most were more timid than they
  looked. He knew, too, that the South American anaconda, or boa-constrictor,
  killed its prey by crushing; and from its size he thought it likely that the
  creature facing him was of this species.</p>

  <p>But there was no time for speculation in the matter. With scarcely any
  plan of action in mind, except that it was probably better to do anything
  rather than nothing, he dismounted, drew his revolver, and took a few paces
  forward. The long procession of curves halted, like a chain of vehicles held
  up suddenly by a policeman. For a fraction of a moment the ill-matched
  adversaries faced each other as if in mutual uncertainty; then Mirsky fired,
  aiming for the head. Owing to nervousness, he missed, but the sound of the
  shot evidently frightened the anaconda, if it were one, for with a sort of
  disdainful hurry it swerved sideways and disappeared into the
  undergrowth.</p>

  <p>After pacifying his horse, Mirsky continued the journey. The incident had
  broken into the serenity of his thoughts, and though he felt he had acquitted
  himself well enough, he was left with a small sub-current of uneasiness. He
  kept glancing about him, determined not to be taken unawares again, but the
  effort was physically as well as mentally fatiguing, though he was rewarded
  with many gay glimpses of parakeets and macaws, and superbly marked orchids
  trailing from branches overhead. The track was often hard to trace, and
  nowhere did he come across any sign of human visitation, much less a fellow
  traveller. He was somewhat surprised not to reach some native village, for he
  had expected the country to be fairly well populated with Indians. At an
  absurdly high figure he had bought from a Maramba woman a string of coloured
  beads, with which he had some idea of mollifying a hostile tribe if he should
  encounter them. It was the sort of thing he had read of in travel-books, and
  he thought it rather enterprising of him to have remembered it.</p>

  <p>But there were no Indians, or, at any rate, he did not see any. Far more
  troublesome were the myriads of small stingless bees that buzzed around his
  head as he rode, and tried to fly into his mouth when he ate; and there were
  ticks that got under his skin and caused intense itchings; and once, when he
  paused to give his horse a rest, he noticed a giant spider halted on the
  ground beside him, its attitude one of obscene curiosity. When he rode on, it
  moved also, waddling alongside at an equal rate, and this, after a time, got
  on his nerves so much that he used his revolver again. This time his aim was
  good and the monster seemed to cave in like a pricked blister, its hairy
  tentacles waving in impotent malice as he passed out of sight.</p>

  <p>He was satisfied that he was covering the miles, however, and as evening
  came and he was able to fill his water-bottle at a stream, he felt that he
  could easily endure a couple more days of it. An hour later, in the sudden
  twilight, he halted at a convenient-looking spot and pitched his camp. For a
  short time, then, his satisfaction recurred; the flame of the sky had
  quenched itself quickly, and night would be cool under trees that were
  themselves under the stars. He set about to make a fire, for he had always
  read that fires keep off wild animals; but he soon found that much of the
  wood lying to hand was completely unburnable, and the search for the right
  kinds used up a good deal of his spare enthusiasm. At length the fire was
  lit, and he made coffee and cooked some rice, those being the only human
  foods it had been possible to buy in Maramba. He ate, drank, smoked a pipe,
  looked after his horse, and then rigged up the mosquito-net, under which he
  crawled with his sleeping-bag. Then he made the disagreeable discovery that
  mosquito-netting did not keep out the smallest and most troublesome insects.
  He kept waking up with the buzz of wings in his ears, to find new bodily
  irritations as he waved the intruders away. At such moments he was impressed
  with a peculiar quality of awe in the silence that surrounded him; beyond the
  light of his small, flickering fire the trees began their sable mystery; he
  felt that the whole forest, though silent, was not asleep, but watching. The
  moments on his radium-pointed watch crawled more slowly than he had ever
  known, and long before midnight he was eager for the dawn&mdash;­ eager to
  push on and cover more miles. Probably, he thought, he had already traversed
  the worst section of the journey; for San Cristobal, being railhead, was
  likely to be the centre of more developed country. At any rate, he had done
  twenty miles or so in the right direction. When he woke up after short spells
  of sleep he found himself so badly bitten and stung that he decided it was
  worth while to stay awake and protect himself, and he tried to kill time by
  reciting verses in Russian, French, and English; after which he set himself
  various mental tasks, such as the enumeration of a certain number of places
  in various countries. ...</p>

  <p>When dawn at last appeared, he made more coffee, packed his gear, and rode
  away with much relief. But it was soon noticeable that his horse was jumpy
  and unable to maintain such a good pace as on the previous day. The track,
  too showed a tendency to curve northward; yet it was so clearly a track that
  he was reluctant to leave it. But after it had taken him for at least a mile
  due north, he came to the conclusion that the parting must be made, and
  plunged accordingly into the more difficult terrain to the left. Here the
  path, such as it existed at all, was encumbered with rotting tree-trunks and
  masses of dense undergrowth, while the foliage above was often so thick that
  he had to dismount. It was pretty hard work to traverse even a few yards in
  this sort of country, and he was uneasily conscious that he was not ticking
  off the miles as he had hoped and planned. Moreover, the air was quiveringly
  hot, with a moist and sickly-scented heaviness; yet, despite the moisture,
  there was a scarcity of water. Both he and his horse were suffering from
  thirst by the time they eventually reached a pool whose water was cold but
  very brackish. It was a rather lovely, tree-fringed pool, and he longed to
  take off his clothes and bathe in it; yet something prevented him, a curious
  inward warning as he saw his reflection in its ebony depths. He passed on
  without discovering why or even whether he had been wise to do so.</p>

  <p>By the second nightfall he was definitely unhappy behind a mask of
  peevishness. The forest, so far from giving any hint of approaching
  civilisation, seemed to grow denser and less hospitable with every yard. He
  was utterly tired out, and though he estimated the day&rsquo;s mileage as ten
  or so, he had a private misgiving that it might in reality be very much less.
  He was also worried about his horse, which seemed rather more than fatigued.
  He suspected that insect-bites, which the beast had rubbed into open sores,
  had set up some kind of fever. He doctored the sores with salt and water
  before preparing his small and not very appetising meal. There was no
  pleasant excitement now as he gathered wood for a fire and rigged up the
  mosquito-net. The preliminaries to the long vigil of darkness had lost all
  their picnic flavour, and he was deeply depressed as he saw the forest,
  changeless all around him, merge swiftly from grey into black. He was
  dreading the night, and, with even greater fear, he knew that he was dreading
  it. Perhaps, after all, it would have been better to have made some enquiries
  at Maramba about the sort of country this was&mdash;­better even, it might
  be, to have invited a companion. And he was already beginning to be aware of
  certain deficiencies in his equipment. He could have felt easier in mind, for
  instance, with a few extra boxes of matches, for the firelighting had not
  been so simple as he had counted on. And some good ointment for sores and
  bites would have been another boon.</p>

  <p>He was so tired that he fell asleep rather quickly, despite the stinging
  ticks; but some time later he woke up suddenly to hear his horse whimpering.
  The fire had gone out, and when he looked at his watch he saw that it was
  still hours from dawn. He felt instinctively, from the note of the cry, that
  something quite terrible was happening. After a few seconds of indecision he
  got up, took his revolver, and felt his way through the darkness. He struck a
  match, but the blackness after it went out made everything more impenetrable
  than before, and he dared not empty the box by striking others. Clammy fronds
  brushed his face as he stumbled through the foliage, guided by the continual
  whimpering; the unseen vegetation touched and recoiled as if it were alive in
  almost an animal sense. He was alone on the stage of a vast, pitch-black
  theatre, acting a pitiful little play before an audience that could see in
  the dark and was just beginning to be attentively hostile. That was how it
  felt. At last he reached his horse and patted its flanks; it was trembling,
  and he was thoroughly alarmed when his hand came away wet and sticky. Then,
  with a sinister commotion of wings, something cold and leathery struck him in
  the face and disappeared into the branches overhead.</p>

  <p>He could not guess what it had been until the morning, when, after hours
  of partly conquered horror, he went to the horse again and saw, in the first
  light of dawn, an appalling transformation. The beast stood forlornly where
  he had tethered it the night before, but its sides and hindquarters were
  ribboned with blood, and its whole carcass was shrunken like a deflated
  bladder. There was no interest or vitality in its wandering, hot-lidded eyes.
  He tried to think what could have happened; at first he pictured an attack by
  some marauding jaguar, but there was no sign of serious flesh-
  wounding&mdash;­merely an immense loss of blood and that look of deathly
  exhaustion. Then he remembered the scramble of wings in the night, and the
  thing that had touched him as it fled. Was there no limit of hideousness in
  these forest secrecies? He was not particularly squeamish, and he had few
  physical compunctions, but the idea of this vampire creature gorging itself
  on blood throughout the long black hours, stirred him to an icy shiver.</p>

  <p>Grimly he tended the suffering animal, relit the fire to boil water, and
  packed for the day&rsquo;s journey. But there was no zest in what he did,
  despite his anxiety to be off; he felt that part of himself was still too
  numb to take in the full unpleasantness of the situation. A further shock
  awaited him when he mounted to ride away; the horse half-turned to him
  beforehand, as if in warning of the inevitable, and then, since he persisted,
  collapsed gently where it stood. He was torn between sympathy and a sudden
  cold lunge of personal fear. He made the horse get up, but did not attempt to
  mount again. Since it could not carry him, it must carry the baggage and be
  led; and if the forest ended soon, perhaps all would be well. Or perhaps
  there was a native village not far ahead, where he could buy another animal.
  Surely he must be near some exit from this appalling country. He dragged the
  horse for a little distance before remembering to take compass bearings; then
  he found that he had been heading south-east instead of west. That small loss
  of time, space, and energy sent him into a passion of rage; he doubled back
  on his tracks and returned to the spot where lay the remains of his burnt-out
  fire. To be there again, seeing his own recent footprints, lifted him to
  panic; he swerved blindly into the new direction, crashing through the
  thickets, and so keen to thrust the yards behind him that he did not even
  brush away the always hovering insects. He grew quieter after a while, and
  halted at the first stream to fill up his water-bottle. The horse browsed
  placidly while he stooped over the pool; it was so weak that he did not
  trouble to tie it up. He was right in thinking the precaution unnecessary,
  for when he turned round he saw that it had slid to the ground and that flies
  already clustered over it in evil-looking rosettes.</p>

  <p>The horse died and he was alone. There by the pool amidst the heat of
  noonday, he forced himself to be very calm and think things out. New reserves
  of power came to him at such urgent summoning; he perceived now, even if he
  had refused to accept the fact before, that he was matched against a very
  considerable adversary. He sorted out his baggage and made various careful
  decisions. There were still left a few handfuls of rice and coffee and a
  score or more matches. The shot-gun and revolver were absolute necessities.
  But the mosquito-net had proved of little use, and as it was cumbersome to
  carry, it had better go. He also at this point abandoned the pocket
  Theocritus, which so far he had not even opened.</p>

  <p>Then he pushed on. He was drenched with sweat, and soon his clothes hung
  in shreds, so that the countless stinging insects had access to all parts of
  his body. He was thirsty, yet he did not dare to empty his water-bottle with
  the deep swigs that he craved. Watching the compass-needle almost
  continuously, he staggered forward, bruising his shins against fallen logs,
  sinking knee-high into decaying leafage, thrusting aside the straggling pulpy
  lianes. If he stopped for a moment he could hear the forest in its full,
  drowsing chorus, with his own heart beating time to that whirr of insect-life
  and that faint whisper of tree-tops under the scorching sun. The whole green
  world lay hushed and trance-like, awaiting the mysterious liveliness of
  night.</p>

  <p>By afternoon he was aware that his chief preoccupation was thirst. It
  mattered more now than any ticks, snakes, tarantulas, or vampire-bats; it lay
  over him in raw, enveloping desire, nourished by every step. His water-bottle
  was empty; he had sipped its last drops with exquisite niggardliness, and now
  his throat and lips were beginning to be like flame. Yet there was such ripe
  greenness everywhere that it seemed impossible that he could go far without
  finding some pleasant oozing mud with a stream trickling through the middle
  of it. Pictures such as that began to obsess his mind till he could almost
  believe them real, and could think that he heard the sound of a bubbling
  rivulet beyond the next limit of sight. He wondered if there were leaves or
  stems from which he could suck the juices; he wondered also what a death from
  thirst would be like. Then his mind began to play over the past and present
  in hot, roving confusion, and he thought of his horse, and that shed at
  Maramba full of shattered bodies, and the lights of Rio, and New York, and a
  glass of beer at a restaurant.... His brain swung dizzily at that last summit
  of bliss, and he felt something give way under him; he staggered and fell on
  his knees, staring at the tangled, rich-hued greenery through which small
  shafts of sunlight made lace-like patterns. The load on his back weighed him
  down, and the shot-gun, slung over his shoulder, rifle-fashion, had made a
  long ridge of sores which the flies constantly attacked. He thought abruptly:
  &ldquo;I am going to die of thirst. Extraordinary! I, Leon Mirsky, formerly
  of Rostov-on-Don, sometime lieutenant in the Fifteenth Imperial Hussars, and
  lately correspondent in Rio of the &lsquo;New York Mail,&rsquo; am about to
  die of thirst at a point somewhere between Maramba and San Cristobal, South
  America....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He had his revolver, anyhow, for the last extremity. But surely, surely he
  was a long way from that. He had heard of persons going waterless for several
  days, and he himself had had less than twelve hours. He upbraided himself for
  giving way so soon; at least he must stick it out till the next day. Then,
  looking round and upwards, he saw a large bird swooping low overhead, and his
  first thought was of the astonishing prescience of vultures. But the bird
  passed, and after a moment the same or a similar bird flew back again. Could
  it be that there was water near by, some pool to which the bird had flown to
  drink? He had noted the direction; it was downhill. With the idea once in his
  mind he could almost sniff the water, and all at once he sprang to his feet,
  flung his pack and weapons on the ground, and raced forward with arms
  outstretched. There was water, and he would find it.</p>

  <p>He did. Less than fifty yards away he ran into a sun-caked gully that had
  been a stream during the rainy season, but was now a series of slimy puddles.
  He lay belly downwards on the edge of one of these and paddled his lips and
  face. He lay for many minutes, caring for nothing but the relief of liquid
  coursing in the dried canals of his body. Birds came near him to drink, too
  thirsty to have fear, or to wait for him to go. Then it grew dark and was
  night. He fell asleep, and thousands of ticks and flies had their will of
  him. Sometimes, in the midst of wild dreams, he woke suddenly, startled by
  the movement of some bird or beast in the pool. He was in pain now, as if
  fire was in his stomach; and in the morning he could move only with great
  difficulty. His first thought was of the guns and pack which he had left a
  short way off in the forest; he must find them, fill up his water-bottle, and
  then press onward. He stumbled a few yards into the undergrowth before
  realising, with a sort of numbed panic, that he had not the slightest idea
  where to look, and that a search of the whole possible radius was far beyond
  the limit of his bodily strength.</p>

  <p>He slid back into the gully and watched without resentment the flies that
  preyed on every inch of his exposed skin. An insect new to him, rather like a
  scorpion, approached to within a little space of his arm, and then scurried
  away when he made to touch it. His brain felt perfectly clear, clearer than
  at any time since that first day after leaving Maramba. He even philosophised
  over the flies and insects, reflecting how the health of their small bodies
  depended on his own sores and illness, and wondering whether life itself
  might not be nourished similarly on some greater, unknown matter in a state
  of unhealth. As ticks and microbes were to men, so were men to what? No
  answer; just as, perhaps, a bacillus in the cancerous throat of a prima-donna
  could have small conception of an aria by Mozart. A universe, then, in which
  life was a symptom of pain and breakdown in some larger structure?</p>

  <p>He felt quite calmly reconciled to the fact of death, provided only that
  it were not to be death of thirst. But then it seemed as if a last malignant
  miracle were performed before his eyes, for he looked down at the pool and
  saw that it had dried. Somehow he had never thought of that, though it was
  really as likely as that puddles dry on city pavements. The last of the green
  scum had oozed away during the night, and now the sun was scorching up the
  final moisture. A bird swooped down, pecked at the caking mud, and seemed to
  share his discomfiture so comically that he burst into a loud laugh and
  scared it away. He went on laughing, as at some monstrous Rabelaisian humour,
  his finger- nails scrabbling in the cocoa-brown earth. And the cream of the
  jest was that his revolver lay somewhere a few yards away&mdash;­yards that
  might as well have been miles. Suddenly, thinking about it, he waved his
  fists at the green encircling wall and began to shriek and shriek....</p>

  <h2><a name="chap7"
     id="chap7">CHAPTER SEVEN. &mdash; MAX OETZLER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The Oetzler House in New York represented a last-minute
  triumph of good taste over wealth. Aged sixty-eight, Oetzler was a sallow,
  bald-headed, small- statured German Jew who had sold newspapers as a small
  boy, and still, it might be said, sold newspapers. His fortune was reckoned
  to be in the seven-figure category, much of it invested in real estate; and
  he had the reputation of having forecast the stock-market slump long, perhaps
  too long, before it had happened. He was shrewd, acid, a fancier of men
  rather than books, and as good a judge of wine as of either. He had gathered
  a typical crowd around his dining- table that March
  evening&mdash;­Wolfe-Sutton the banker, Mrs. Drinan the actress, Lanberger
  the latest lion among the novelists, Russell just back from the Andes, Lady
  Celia Rivers on her way to Hollywood, and so on. Twelve in all, including
  himself. His cousin had come up from Long Island to act as hostess; she was
  rather &ldquo;out of things&rdquo; intellectually, but she made up for it by
  a few mundaner talents which the great ones often lacked. Oetzler was just
  conventional enough himself to appreciate the fact that introducing people
  without getting their names mixed up required brains of a kind, even if one
  did prefer the Ziegfeld Chorus to &ldquo;Strange Interlude.&rdquo; His
  attitude towards his guests was pleasantly cynical; he liked to hear them
  talk, and took care never to believe much of anything they said. It was, as
  he reckoned it, a shop-window world, in which it would have been a breach of
  etiquette to attempt to purchase the goods displayed. The real stuff of the
  mind was housed in cellars, where one need not advertise it.</p>

  <p>He recognised a familiar scene as he glanced down the table at the
  alternating array of creamy neck and white shirt-front. Like most
  celebrities, they seemed to him ruthlessly self-centred; their talk spurted
  into the air like fireworks, and he was always fascinated to notice how
  little real connection the brightest salvos had with anything that had gone
  before, yet how cunningly the skilled conversational practitioner could
  devise an apparent sequence. And there were several skilled practitioners at
  work to-night, he noted. Indeed, he thought it very possible that no more
  brilliant talk was being manufactured anywhere in New York at that moment.
  The participants were all so cold and experienced; they shot their service so
  unerringly over the net; though one did get a little fatigued, as at
  tournament tennis, by the constant swivel of attention. Extraordinary fruit
  of civilisation, these tricks of verbal jugglery, played for a couple of
  hours over the silver and cut glass of a dining-table. To eat and
  talk&mdash;­who had first thought of elaborating the simultaneous technique?
  Oetzler was indifferently aware that he himself was but a poor hand at the
  game; his words had a distressful habit of meaning something, which was why,
  rather than spoil the play, he usually preferred to be a listener. He liked,
  for example, to listen to Lanberger talking of the world-slump, envisaging
  the breakdown of civilisation as casually as he might announce the discovery
  of a new Czecho-Slovakian ballerina. He liked nearly as well to hear
  Wolfe-Sutton jauntily seconding a remark which, if true, must necessarily
  spell doom for them all; was there something fine, or else merely fatuous, in
  the way these people daintily improvised while so many Romes were burning?
  The ball of chatter kept on flip- flopping backwards and forwards, never
  missing a score, yet just as reliably never getting anywhere; once it seemed
  in danger of stopping, but Wolfe-Sutton rescued it at the last moment by
  interjecting: &ldquo;Curious, isn&rsquo;t it, the growing gulf between what
  we can all say, privately like this, and what we dare write and speak in
  public? We dope the millions with stuff that doesn&rsquo;t even win from us a
  cynical smile.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lanberger, red-haired and bronze-eyed, nodded. &ldquo;Yes, and our host,
  if he won&rsquo;t mind our being personal, is an example. In his newspapers
  he organises optimism like a drill-sergeant, but one of the few people he
  can&rsquo;t influence is himself. Do we count him a hypocrite? Not at all. As
  a matter of fact, we hardly notice the discrepancy. We accept the fact that
  cheerfulness has to be dished out to the multitude just as we know that a
  boxer before a fight daren&rsquo;t express the least doubt about
  winning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Russell&rsquo;s turn now. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure, though, that the
  multitude is really taken in.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You think they see through it?&rdquo; queried Mrs. Drinan, in her
  brittle voice. &ldquo;You really think they don&rsquo;t believe all that they
  read in Mr. Oetzler&rsquo;s newspapers?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Oetzler answered her mockery with an amused: &ldquo;Good God, I hope they
  don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Russell turned to him with a smile. &ldquo;Probably people everywhere are
  developing resistance to mass-suggestion&mdash;­after all, even the stupidest
  of us don&rsquo;t rush to do all that the advertisements command us to. And I
  rather suspect that this matter of organised optimism is a case in point....
  You know, perhaps, that I&rsquo;ve just come back from the wilds&mdash;­after
  twelve months away. Last night I went to a restaurant where there was a band
  playing optimistic songs. All about shouting for happiness and putting your
  troubles on the shelf&mdash;­that sort of stuff. There was a pathos about it
  in 1930, when people took it with a sort of half- prayerful
  boisterousness&mdash;­rather like a lot of drunks singing in a thunder-storm
  to keep their courage up. By last year the pathos had turned to obvious
  derision. But last night, mouthed by whispering baritones and crooning
  tenors&mdash;­&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Neo-Bantu castrati,&rdquo; interjected Lanberger.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&mdash;­it all struck me as different again. The folks
  weren&rsquo;t cheered by it, they weren&rsquo;t depressed by it, they
  weren&rsquo;t even cynical about it. They just carried on with their ordinary
  business, which was eating and drinking and flirting, with no more attention
  than if the words had been a funeral lament.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Russell then resigned the ball to be tossed about by others. He was a man
  of nearer sixty than fifty; grey-haired, short-bearded, and inclined to
  mellow after a grim middle age and a somewhat riotous youth. He was fairly
  well off, unmarried, and good company&mdash;­ circumstances which had enabled
  Oetzler and himself to enjoy for years an acquaintanceship which, though it
  hardly warmed into friendship, was yet unhampered by all the more fruitful
  causes of estrangement. And, in a sense, one could not easily be a FRIEND of
  Odo Russell. A wanderer, a woman-hater, a writer of unconventional
  travel-books, and a man of intense physical courage, he had progressed beyond
  mere disillusionment to a state at which he might have been called
  unillusioned. It was magnificent, doubtless, but it was not lovable.</p>

  <p>Oetzler leaned forward and spoke to him across Mrs. Drinan, who was
  arguing vividly with someone at the other end of the table. &ldquo;By the
  way, Russell,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;while you were out there, did
  you happen to hear anything of that fellow I wrote you about?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Russell looked up. &ldquo;The Russian youth? Yes. I found him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s alive?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s alive all right.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then he certainly ought to write to his sister in
  Paris&mdash;­she&rsquo;s worried to death. I don&rsquo;t particularly blame
  him for letting me down if he found something better to do out
  there&mdash;­we&rsquo;ve all got to look after ourselves&mdash;­&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Russell interrupted: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not quite so simple as all that,
  unfortunately. In fact, it&rsquo;s rather a long story, so that
  perhaps&mdash;­&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, you must tell me about it afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The general conversation continued, and Oetzler pondered. So that Russian
  fellow was alive? Oetzler was glad; he had quite liked him, though he had
  never thought much of his art journalism. He remembered once, in a whimsical
  mood, offering him a salary of a hundred dollars a week if he could explain,
  simply and convincingly to the ordinary reader, just why a Botticelli was
  better art than a magazine-advertisement of a Marmon straight-eight ... and
  he would have been worth the money, too, if he&rsquo;d been able to do
  it.</p>

  <p>Oetzler had no further chance of speaking to Russell until later in the
  evening, when all the others had gone except Lanberger, who was staying the
  night. Then, as the three sat over the library fire with drinks and cigars,
  he said, recollecting the matter: &ldquo;So you found Mirsky, then, did
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Russell gave a half-glance at Lanberger. &ldquo;I did, but it&rsquo;s a
  complicated story, and&mdash;­&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So you said before, but that doesn&rsquo;t matter. We can put you
  up for the night, if you get too tired for the journey to your
  hotel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s also&mdash;­in a way&mdash;­rather confidential. I
  don&rsquo;t know if&mdash;­&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lanberger took the hint and rose at once, but Oetzler checked him.
  &ldquo;I think we can accept a pledge of secrecy, eh, Russell? That is, of
  course, if you think it&rsquo;s the sort of story that would interest a
  novelist?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It might.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, go ahead.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Russell took a sip of his drink, glanced for a moment at his two
  listeners, and began. His voice was pleasant, he spoke with easy fluency, and
  in conversation he had the same flair for words that had made his
  travel-books very readable. &ldquo;I got your letter addressed to San
  Cristobal, Oetzler. And I must confess I was amused by your saying in it that
  perhaps I could make enquiries because you&rsquo;d looked up San Cristobal on
  the map and had found that it was quite near Maramba. Well, I suppose it is
  quite near, judged by your standards, which are doubtless those of a private
  saloon-coach on the New York Central. As a matter of fact, the distance is
  about a hundred and twenty miles. There&rsquo;s no road between the two
  places, no river, and not even a direct track. The trip has been done, at
  various times, but it&rsquo;s about as rare as a crossing of Arabia or Tibet.
  That&rsquo;s the sort of thing people don&rsquo;t easily realise. Those
  hundred and twenty miles are more of a separation than any mountain range or
  ocean. They&rsquo;re covered with forest, much of it dense and waterless in
  the dry season, and they&rsquo;re the haunt of a dreadful little pest called
  the ihenna&mdash;­a minute fly that can get through any mosquito-net and
  through most sorts of clothing. There are also such minor inconveniences as
  snakes, tigers, and native tribes who still use poisoned arrows. Finally
  there&rsquo;s no particular reason why anybody should ever want to get from
  Maramba to San Cristobal. Maramba does all its trade with the south and east,
  San Cristobal with the north and west&mdash;­ they&rsquo;re in different
  spheres altogether. That&rsquo;s what puzzled me so much when you wrote that
  the authorities in Maramba believed that Mirsky had crossed the river. I
  couldn&rsquo;t think what his reason might have been. It was the maddest
  thing to do, and anyone in Maramba would have told him so. Two Canadians, by
  the way, attempted the journey last year and were never heard of again. Their
  bones are whitening somewhere in the forest, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Probably, after the earthquake, the Maramba people weren&rsquo;t
  much interested in giving warnings,&rdquo; put in Oetzler.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Maybe that was it. Anyhow, as soon as I got your letter, I made a
  few enquiries here and there&mdash;­not really expecting to be told of
  anything. I talked to innkeepers, traders and people who might have heard any
  tales that were about. My own theory was that Mirsky had probably crossed the
  river out of mere curiosity, and perhaps ridden a little way into the forest
  and been killed somehow or other&mdash;­there are a hundred ways of getting
  killed in that sort of country, particularly for that sort of youth. You
  didn&rsquo;t give me much of a description of him, but he hardly seemed to me
  the pioneering type.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly not that, but he wasn&rsquo;t a ninny, by any means, you
  know. He was in the Russian Revolution&mdash;­I think he fought in one or two
  battles.... But go on&mdash;­don&rsquo;t let me interrupt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Russell drank again. &ldquo;I may as well get to the point of the story
  quickly. To my surprise, when I began to ask questions, I did hear, quite
  soon, of a rumour circulated by some Indians who had been in the town lately.
  They had mentioned a strange white man who was living in the middle of the
  forest in a native hut, and I gathered that the affair had been discussed by
  them as a sensation of some piquancy. That was just the vague impression I
  got, mind you, hearing the story third-hand like that. Naturally I asked for
  more details, but I only received doubtful replies, and it began to seem
  unlikely that I could trace the thing any further. Then, altogether by
  accident, I ran into a young fellow prospecting for the Standard Oil Company.
  He was one of those keen, eager youths that represent the very best that
  America has to offer the world&mdash;­I don&rsquo;t know how the company
  finds them all&mdash;­&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because it looks for them,&rdquo; interposed Oetzler.
  &ldquo;Because it finds the men who can do a job and then gives them a job to
  do. If the whole country were run half as well, we should be a good deal
  better off.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Russell nodded. &ldquo;Yes, I daresay you&rsquo;re right. I heard someone
  once say that Standard Oil was one of the three most wonderful institutions
  the world had ever known&mdash;­the other two being the Papacy and the
  pre-War German army. They also, by the way, are well represented in San
  Cristobal. In fact, you won&rsquo;t find any spot in the world where the
  hardships are too much for that extraordinary trio&mdash;­the Roman
  missionary, the oil man, and the German ex-officer in search of a job.
  They&rsquo;re cells of faith, hope, and efficiency in places where everybody
  else is sinking into a sort of sulky fatalism. Indeed, if our civilisation
  does crash, as we were all talking about at dinner, I&rsquo;ll even back the
  triumvirate to build up another one.... However, that&rsquo;s rather
  wandering from the point. What I was about to say was that this youth, Dyson
  by name, told me not only that he also had heard the rumour about the mystery
  man, but that the chap was supposed to be camped out fairly close to where
  the oil-men had lately been prospecting.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They hadn&rsquo;t seen him?&rdquo; queried Oetzler.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d had something more important to do than look for him,
  I should imagine. But the name of their place was Yacaiba, and that&rsquo;s
  where I set out for a few days afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope it didn&rsquo;t upset your plans a lot?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was interested. I didn&rsquo;t mind. Yacaiba was a two
  day&rsquo;s journey away, travelling on mule-back. There&rsquo;d been heavy
  rains that had swollen the rivers, and what ought to have taken two days took
  eleven. You&rsquo;ll find the place marked on the Government large-scale maps
  as if it were about the size of Denver, or Salt Lake City, but in reality
  it&rsquo;s a collection of adobe huts inhabited by less than a hundred
  scrofulous Chiriqui Indians. Rather an extraordinary tribe, the Chiriquis, as
  I&rsquo;ll tell you later. I&rsquo;m giving you these details so that
  you&rsquo;ll feel some meaning in those hundred and twenty miles between San
  Cristobal and Maramba. Yacaiba is less than half-way and a little bit off the
  straight line. Well, I got there and was hospitably entertained by some more
  young fellows of the same type as Dyson&mdash;­they were terribly busy, and
  hadn&rsquo;t come across the oil they were looking for, so I didn&rsquo;t
  bother them much with my questions. All they could say was that the Indians
  talked of a gringo living somewhere in the jungle with one of their own
  women.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; exclaimed Oetzler.</p>

  <p>Russell smiled. &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s where you home-bred Americans
  prick up your ears. You&rsquo;ve all got an anti-miscegenation complex. Six
  months in parts of South America would do you good&mdash;­you&rsquo;d find
  that the mating of white and native races isn&rsquo;t thought of everywhere
  as it is in Tennessee and Alabama. Whole nations south of the Canal have been
  reared out of the first intermixtures of Spaniard and native Indian, and in
  Bolivia the half-breeds, the cholos, are in some respects the most promising
  stocks. So don&rsquo;t think that the mere notion of a white man and an
  Indian woman was likely to shock anybody in Yacaiba.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re too squeamish, I admit,&rdquo; said Lanberger. &ldquo;I
  wonder if we oughn&rsquo;t to look to complete world-freedom in intermarriage
  as an ideal? It will probably come, when the European stocks have been
  overthrown from their quite temporary domination. After all, modern transport
  is making the world so small that this rigid and continuous in- breeding of
  the white races is almost beginning to look incestuous.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Oetzler said curtly: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like half-breeds.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear fellow, I don&rsquo;t myself particularly care for Poles
  and Lithuanians and Greeks, but I&rsquo;m bound to confess that the whole
  gigantic mix-up of Teuton, Latin, Slav and Semite has given America its new
  note of vitality in the world. Why, then, must we suppose that a further
  admixture of Chink and Jap, or even pure nigger, wouldn&rsquo;t add to the
  newness and the vitality?... But I don&rsquo;t want to hold up the
  story.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d got to Yacaiba, hadn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; Russell continued.
  &ldquo;Well, there was an Indian there who thought he knew where we could
  find the happy couple, so I engaged him as a guide and we set out into the
  forests. He said we&rsquo;d be riding for a day, but once again calculations
  went all wrong; it took four days. And I&rsquo;ll say this, having had three
  nights in it, that I consider that forest one of the most hellish things
  I&rsquo;ve ever struck. Let me compare my own situation then with what must
  have been Mirsky&rsquo;s when he entered from the other end. He was alone; I
  had an Indian who was supposed to know the place. He had no experience of
  pioneer hardships; I&rsquo;ve had forty years of them. He was setting out to
  do over a hundred miles; my trip was less than thirty. He had a horse (so the
  Maramba people said, didn&rsquo;t they?); I was on a mule, which is a much
  more reliable animal in such conditions. Also, he was new blood to all the
  insects; I&rsquo;ve been so well inoculated that I&rsquo;ve sometimes
  imagined that the brutes see me coming and deliberately keep off. On the
  whole, I&rsquo;m glad I had those days and nights in the forest. They helped
  me to understand the sort of thing that he must have gone through before he
  was found.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Oetzler. &ldquo;He was found, then.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, but I seem to be getting a bit ahead with my story. On the
  fourth day we came to a few native huts by the side of a stream. The village,
  or whatever it deserves to be called, was completely empty, and the reason
  was obvious&mdash;­the stream had recently overflowed and washed out the
  inhabitants. But about a mile away, on higher ground, surrounded by a small
  clearing which was in turn surrounded by the forest, there was this
  interesting ménage in full swing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Russell paused, relishing his own technique of narrative. He went on,
  eventually: &ldquo;There was a rough timber hut with no windows, a large
  opening for a door, and a roof made of some kind of palm-leaf. The floor was
  just the earth, which chickens had scratched into inches of filth and dust. A
  very small maize field rose on sloping ground at the back&mdash;­right up to
  the edge of the forest. There were a few rather scraggy cattle in a stockaded
  corral. It was dull and raining when I saw the place first, and the
  impression of the forest all around, a complete wall of black, was that of
  some huge, crouching animal waiting to pounce. Probably, had it been a fine
  day, I&rsquo;d have thought it all looked very cheerful and homy. Anyway,
  there it was, and your friend Mirsky, dressed native-fashion in slip-slop
  trousers and nothing else, was chopping wood in the doorway.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course, I couldn&rsquo;t be certain, then, that he was Mirsky.
  He had a beard and a moustache, his hair was long, he was very dirty&mdash;­
  he didn&rsquo;t look a bit like the man your letter had described. There was
  nothing for it but the &lsquo;Doctor-Livingstone-I- presume&rsquo; gambit, so
  I went up to him, held out my hand, and said: &rsquo;Is your name
  Mirsky?&rsquo; He didn&rsquo;t take my hand, he didn&rsquo;t answer, and he
  gave me a look that I can&rsquo;t really portray, but it showed me this much
  instantly&mdash;­he was off his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We stood there for a minute or so, facing each other without words.
  Then suddenly a woman came out of the hut and looked at us. That gave me my
  second shock. You know, Oetzler, I&rsquo;m probably the last man in the world
  who could he called sentimental, especially about women, and you can imagine
  that I hadn&rsquo;t been picturing any romantic affair between a stranded
  white man and a lovely sepia princess. I was prepared for the average Indian
  female, who generally isn&rsquo;t good-looking to begin with, ages very
  rapidly, and has several diseases. But this creature wasn&rsquo;t even that.
  She was the most incredibly ugly human creature I think I ever saw in my
  life. She had the usual flat nose and broken teeth and barrel-shaped body.
  She may have been old or young&mdash;­one simply couldn&rsquo;t guess. But
  the whole effect was made much worse by her being an out-size. She was big
  even by our standards&mdash;­to the Indians, who are rather a stunted race,
  she must have seemed a regular giantess. She made Mirsky look puny, and he
  certainly wasn&rsquo;t under average. Of course I could understand as soon as
  I saw her why the Indians at Yacaiba had all seemed rather lewdly amused at
  the situation&mdash;­ there&rsquo;s always something a bit comic about the
  amours of a hefty woman.... Well, there you are&mdash;­there&rsquo;s your
  picture. I ought to add that she was quite as dirty as she was ugly, and that
  when she came up close she had a queer, ammoniacal smell that happens to be
  one of the few unpleasantnesses that I&rsquo;ve never managed to get used
  to.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lanberger reached for more whisky. &ldquo;As you say, Russell, you could
  hardly call yourself a sentimentalist.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Russell went on. &ldquo;Well, she looked me up and down, and I smiled
  politely, and then Mirsky said something to her in the native lingo, and I
  gathered it was by way of general introduction. I&rsquo;d already given him
  my own name, of course. When I said he was off his head, I don&rsquo;t mean
  that he was a raving lunatic. Far from it. His first instincts were quite
  naturally hospitable, and he motioned me to enter the hut out of the pouring
  rain. I did so, with him following me, and the woman following after him. My
  Indian guide stayed outside, watching events with much curiosity. The inside
  of that hut was pretty dreadful. It had about twenty smells, among them being
  those of chickens, drying pemmican, peppery cooking, and filth. There was a
  sort of wooden bench on which Mirsky invited me to sit. The woman went into a
  corner and squatted on some straw; I couldn&rsquo;t see her properly, but I
  could feel that her eyes were still on me, and I had an additional feeling
  that she didn&rsquo;t altogether like me or approve of my visit. Meanwhile I
  was rather waiting for Mirsky to say something, or at least to confirm the
  fact that he was Mirsky. He didn&rsquo;t; but he asked me what he could do
  for me, if I had lost my way, did I wish for food, or anything. Quite
  courteous, indeed. I said: &rsquo;No. I came deliberately to see you. I was
  told you were here. I should like to talk to you.&rsquo; He smiled at that
  and said he didn&rsquo;t know that we could find much to talk about. I
  didn&rsquo;t fence around any longer then, but said outright that his friends
  were greatly concerned about him, and that I&rsquo;d been sent by them to
  bring him back. To which he replied, equally outright: &rsquo;You&rsquo;ll
  spare yourself a lot of trouble if you take my word once and for all that
  I&rsquo;m not coming.&rsquo; Quietly just like that. There was nothing
  precisely in his tone, or words, or manner, to suggest that he wasn&rsquo;t
  perfectly sane. But when I looked at him I saw his eyes again. They were the
  danger-signal. They were&mdash;­I can only think of one adjective&mdash;­they
  were HOT.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Naturally, I didn&rsquo;t launch into arguments right away. To
  begin with, I wasn&rsquo;t ready with any. It hadn&rsquo;t really occurred to
  me that the fellow wouldn&rsquo;t jump at the chance of quitting such a life.
  I just said: &lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s how you feel, is it?&rsquo; and let the
  matter drop for the time being. He was instantly courteous again, and offered
  me food and drink, which I decided to accept. I&rsquo;m not particularly
  fastidious&mdash;­I haven&rsquo;t had to be in my life&mdash;­but I confess
  that I heaved a bit over that meal. Just to see that woman eating was enough
  to turn one&rsquo;s stomach. We drank chicha, which is made from maize, and
  is pretty alcoholic if you have too much of it. Afterwards both Mirsky and
  the woman chewed coca, but I declined to join in&mdash;­not from any
  scruples, but because I don&rsquo;t much care for the drug. We talked a
  little, just the two of us. Sometimes Mirsky said a word or so to the woman,
  but I gathered that he didn&rsquo;t understand her language very completely.
  My attitude, which I thought was the best possible in the circumstances, was
  to pretend that the whole situation was the most natural in the world. From a
  good deal of our talk we might have been lunching at the Ritz-Carlton. Except
  that whenever I mentioned anything about the outside world he shut me up
  instantly&mdash;­telling me he wasn&rsquo;t interested. Nor would he talk
  about the recent past. He seemed to be living in a sort of &lsquo;here-
  now&rsquo; world, as if he either couldn&rsquo;t or wouldn&rsquo;t exercise
  his brain over space and time. I&rsquo;m not a psychologist, still less an
  alienist, and I don&rsquo;t really profess to understand the man&rsquo;s
  mental condition. But it did seem to me that his mind was somehow twisted.
  I&rsquo;ll give you an instance of it later on.... I hope, by the way, you
  don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m spinning this out too much? There isn&rsquo;t a
  great deal more to tell, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; Oetzler said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a most extraordinary
  story.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose it is. I&rsquo;ve known men go native before, but as
  a rule it&rsquo;s drink or women that lead them to it, and they&rsquo;d most
  of them give their eyes to get back, if anyone offered to help them. Mirsky,
  however, was a rather studious type, wasn&rsquo;t he, not much given to the
  pleasures of the flesh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Oetzler nodded. &ldquo;He certainly didn&rsquo;t drink heavily, and as for
  women, I should have reckoned him under rather than oversexed. Finnicky, in
  fact.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re thinking of that woman,&rdquo; Russell answered.
  &ldquo;There was nothing undersexed about her, I can assure you. She was
  almost, if you take my meaning, a caricature of the thing. What&rsquo;s the
  name of that English Jew who does queer sculptures that get his name in the
  pictures? Yes, Epstein, that&rsquo;s it. She was Sex as Epstein might have
  personified it. I don&rsquo;t say that, of course, merely because she was
  ugly. There was something else&mdash;­something powerful and elemental and
  rather, to me, horrific in her. One somehow expected to see her surrounded by
  an enormous litter of children. Yet, so far as I could judge, she
  hadn&rsquo;t any. Afterwards, when I got back to Yacaiba, I discovered that
  this was by no means remarkable, since the Chiriqui women vastly outnumber
  the men&mdash;­sometimes by as big a ratio as ten to one. Nobody quite knows
  why, but it is so. The only theory I can advance is that just as during a War
  the will to survive produces an excess of males, a corresponding excess of
  females must represent a subconscious will to die. As a matter of fact, some
  of the tribes are dying&mdash;­very rapidly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It must make the men rather proud of themselves,&rdquo; said
  Oetzler.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I daresay. But most of them are only weedy little runts that
  sit around all day doing nothing, while the women work. Contrary to what you
  might expect, the men are by no means objects of worship by the women. The
  disproportion is so great that the women seem rather to despise them.
  There&rsquo;s polygamy, of course, if you like to call it that, but
  it&rsquo;s really more like promiscuity. Few of the children know their own
  fathers. The men&rsquo;s function is just &lsquo;service,&rsquo; in the
  stud-book sense, and I can&rsquo;t say it adds to their dignity, even if it
  does to their importance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And the women?&rdquo; queried Lanberger. &ldquo;Do they play
  fair&mdash;­share and share alike? Or do the good-looking ones, if there are
  any, elbow the others out of the way?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So far as I could judge from very casual observation in Yacaiba,
  the women seemed to be pretty sensible about it. Perhaps they&rsquo;d arrived
  at the soundest possible basis for a sexual relationship&mdash;­ that of not
  expecting faithfulness. Still, the bad-lookers do get left
  out&mdash;­that&rsquo;s natural enough.&rdquo; He took a fresh cigar, paused
  while he lit it, and then added: &ldquo;Which brings me back to the
  point&mdash;­that woman. I should guess that SHE&rsquo;D been left out, until
  she met Mirsky. Or, rather, she didn&rsquo;t exactly meet him&mdash;­she must
  have found him, probably when he was half-dead and half- mad of thirst in the
  forest. He didn&rsquo;t deny that that was what had happened, when I put it
  to him the following day. Oh, yes, I stayed the night there. I&rsquo;m afraid
  I&rsquo;m telling this story rather badly. I stayed the night because I had
  to&mdash;­the heavy rains had swollen the river so much that it was quite
  impossible to make the crossing. Mirsky walked down with me to look at it and
  then invited me to return with him and wait till the morning. I can&rsquo;t
  say I was pleased, because we&rsquo;d already had a long and exhausting
  argument and I could see that persuasion was useless.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, quite useless. When a man says the sort of things that Mirsky
  said, and with that queer sort of danger look in his eyes, you can&rsquo;t
  feel very optimistic about changing his mind. When I told him about his
  sister in Paris and how worried she was about him, all he said was:
  &lsquo;She needn&rsquo;t be. I&rsquo;m well enough here.&rsquo; &lsquo;But do
  you mean to say she&rsquo;s never going to see you again?&rsquo; I asked, and
  he answered: &rsquo;She can see me here, if she comes. There&rsquo;s room
  enough for her.&rsquo; After that it didn&rsquo;t seem worth while to say
  much more. He talked a lot of wild nonsense about hating civilisation. Even
  art, too. He was in a mood to have put his foot through the canvas of the
  Monna Lisa if it had been anywhere near. He pointed to a rather repulsive
  looking beetle we saw crawling over the mud and said to me: &rsquo;You see
  that beetle? What is it? It&rsquo;s a beetle, that&rsquo;s all. What is it
  doing? Nothing particular that we know of. It&rsquo;s just being a beetle.
  Well, that&rsquo;s how I want to be a man.&rsquo; All that sort of
  talk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not especially original,&rdquo; commented Lanberger. &ldquo;I begin
  to suspect that Mirsky must have had a complete set of the works of D. H.
  Lawrence somewhere in that hut.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Russell laughed. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t read much of Lawrence, so I
  can&rsquo;t say, but of course the whole thing was absurd. Civilised man
  can&rsquo;t go back to savagery all at once&mdash;­he&rsquo;s too self-
  conscious. The very last thing a savage ever does is to explain himself
  introspectively, as Mirsky was doing then. But he wasn&rsquo;t altogether
  sane, remember. Those days and nights in the forest&mdash;­ exactly how many
  before the woman found him, I couldn&rsquo;t quite gather&mdash;­they&rsquo;d
  done that much for him. As we came in sight of his hut on the way back he
  said something else that stuck in my mind. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got everything a
  man needs,&rsquo; he said, &rsquo;food, drink, a roof over my head, and a
  woman.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Lanberger, reflectively, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a
  point of view, at any rate. I can imagine many people who&rsquo;re by no
  means mad agreeing with him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not offering it as a proof of his madness,&rdquo;
  Russell retorted. &ldquo;And I could give you far better ones than that, in
  any case. ... But I must tell you now how we spent the night. Mirsky and the
  woman slept together at one end of the hut, my Indian guide was in the
  middle, and I was at the other end near the doorway. As it wasn&rsquo;t a
  large hut we were all fairly closely huddled. There was no artificial light,
  so we turned in as soon as it got dark. Of course I didn&rsquo;t
  undress&mdash;­I didn&rsquo;t even take my boots off. There was only straw to
  lie on, full of fleas and insects. Usually I don&rsquo;t get bitten much, but
  Mirsky must have been breeding an especially ferocious type. They and other
  things kept me awake, though there was every reason for me to be as tired as
  the guide, who began snoring almost instantly. I smoked a pipe or two and
  thought what a confoundedly queer world it was&mdash;­to have sent a Russian
  aristocrat turned Yankee art-critic to sleep on straw in the middle of a
  tropical swamp with that monstrous female. As a matter of fact, it rather got
  on my nerves&mdash;­the thought of them there, like that, only a few feet
  away. Of course I&rsquo;m quite aware that I ought to allow for my own
  personal kink in such a matter. Frankly, I don&rsquo;t care for women. I
  don&rsquo;t even think that their naked bodies are beautiful&mdash;­all those
  rather foolish curves and cushions. Now a man&rsquo;s body, on the other
  hand... but I mustn&rsquo;t digress. I want to tell you about that night. It
  was not quite pitch-dark&mdash;­there was a small moon when the clouds let it
  be seen. I suppose, despite the fleas and the smells and the general
  uncomfortableness of things, I must have dropped off to sleep before
  midnight, because when I woke I had a distinct middle-of-the-night, as
  opposed to nearly-time-to-get-up feeling. I&rsquo;m rather good at that sort
  of instinct; I also have an instinct for danger&mdash;­ it&rsquo;s saved my
  life several times. In fact&mdash;­which is what I&rsquo;ve come to at
  last&mdash;­I think it did so that night.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I woke up with a queer sensation that something was happening or
  about to happen&mdash;­I felt it even before I remembered my whereabouts. And
  then, when I looked up, I saw, very faintly against the slightly pale oblong
  of the open doorway, a sight more terrifying to me than snakes or
  panthers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lanberger tittered. &ldquo;Do we have to guess what it was? I suggest it
  was Mirsky being a beetle... . Sorry, Russell, I&rsquo;m not really poking
  fun&mdash;­it&rsquo;s just that your quite frightful story begins to make me
  feel hysterical. I can&rsquo;t help it. But do go on.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Russell continued: &ldquo;The woman was standing over me. I could feel and
  smell, more than I could see her. And if, by the way, I had happened to be an
  admirer of women, I think that might have been enough to cure me for ever. I
  can get now, when I think of it, some of the fearfulness of that presence
  near me&mdash;­once again, in the darkness, I had an impression of something
  elemental, and in a rather dreadful way, obscene. I won&rsquo;t elaborate it,
  though. Perhaps more to the point is the fact that she was carrying something
  in her hand&mdash;­something which, dimly outlined, looked to me very much
  like the axe that Mirsky had been using to chop wood.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I rather pride myself, you know, on keeping my head at these
  awkward junctures. After my first spasm of terror, I felt quite calm. The
  woman, I could see, was watching me, but I doubted whether she knew I had
  wakened. My revolver was touching my hand&mdash;­ if she intended murder I
  could forestall her by the merest pressure of a finger. I don&rsquo;t know
  that I&rsquo;d have felt much compunction about it, either&mdash;­I&rsquo;ve
  killed men for less, and I certainly didn&rsquo;t feel in a chivalrous mood
  just then, even if I ever did. Anyhow, to cut the story shorter, I gave her
  the chance and she took it. I staged a noisy yawn, and saw her slink back,
  axe and all, into the shadows at the other end of the hut.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As you can guess, I didn&rsquo;t go to sleep again that night. I
  lay awake thinking things over, and the best plan, in the circumstances,
  seemed a pretty quick exit in the morning. I just didn&rsquo;t like the idea
  of that woman. The Indian tribes, you know, aren&rsquo;t particularly
  intelligent, but they&rsquo;re reputed to employ several highly original
  methods of slaughter, and I wasn&rsquo;t sure that I knew them all. So at
  dawn I got up, waked my guide, and ordered him to prepare for the return
  journey. Mirsky and the woman heard me, and also got up. Mirsky protested
  against my going so soon, and wanted me to take a meal first, but I
  declined&mdash;­to tell the truth, though it may sound ridiculous&mdash;­I
  had a fear of poison. You see, I&rsquo;d figured it out that the woman knew,
  whether he&rsquo;d told her so or not, that I was scheming to take him away
  from her. It&rsquo;s the sort of motive that grows with thinking about, and I
  reckoned on her feeling more murderous than ever after that
  middle-of-the-night fiasco. I didn&rsquo;t hint anything of this to Mirsky,
  of course. I merely said that as it hadn&rsquo;t rained during the night, I
  was anxious to take the chance of crossing the river. Mirsky said it would
  still be impossible to cross, but I said I would go down and try, anyway. So
  he went with me. My good-bye to the woman was somewhat frigidly polite.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about a mile downhill from the hut to the fording-
  place, and Mirsky and I carried on a rather one-sided conversation most of
  the way. It was then that I said I supposed the woman had found him half-dead
  in the forest, and he just looked at me sardonically and shrugged his
  shoulders. I also said: &rsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what sort of report I can
  make about you when I get back.&rsquo; He said: &rsquo;Why not tell the
  truth?&rsquo; I answered: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s too ghastly.&rsquo; He then said:
  &lsquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s the woman that makes you say that.&rsquo; I
  admitted as much, and he laughed in a sort of crackling way and answered:
  &rsquo;That&rsquo;s just the trouble. You shouldn&rsquo;t think about her.
  You shouldn&rsquo;t think about women at all. They&rsquo;re not made for
  it.&rsquo; I said they were generally considered to be of some importance in
  a man&rsquo;s life. He said: &rsquo;Important, yes. So are the colon and the
  pylorus. But you only think about them when they&rsquo;re not functioning
  properly. Thought is Mishap. That&rsquo;s a decent sort of Proudhon
  definition anyway. Look at your world when you return to it&mdash;­compare it
  with the almost thoughtless world of the amoeba, or with the totally
  thoughtless orbit of Betelgeuse.&rsquo; &rsquo;All very well,&rsquo; I
  retorted, &rsquo;but the fact remains that what you&rsquo;re saying now is
  very much the product of thought. You seem to have the disease as badly as
  anyone else.&rsquo; He laughed again at that, and we went on talking till we
  reached the river. I can&rsquo;t remember a lot that he said. As you remarked
  just now, Lanberger, it probably wasn&rsquo;t anything really original. But
  it would no doubt pass for originality if Mirsky were to come back here on a
  lecture tour, grizzled beard and Indian squaw complete. I can see the
  women&rsquo;s clubs in Cincinnati and Akron, Ohio, going wild about
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d certainly make a bigger hit than he did as a highbrow
  art-critic,&rdquo; agreed Oetzler. &ldquo;But unfortunately you weren&rsquo;t
  able to persuade him to such an interestingly new career, I
  gather?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, but he nearly persuaded me to go back with him to the hut. He
  said the river was very deep and had dangerous cross-currents, so that
  I&rsquo;d probably lose all my tackle if not my life. The Indian guide was
  rather doubtful about it, too&mdash;­the stream certainly was running pretty
  high. I was half-preparing myself to accept the inevitable&mdash;­after all,
  I thought, I&rsquo;ve got a revolver and know how to use it&mdash;­when I
  happened to give another glance at Mirsky, and all at once my guardian
  instinct stepped in again. I can&rsquo;t really describe the look that was in
  his face. It was just&mdash;­if the oxymoron conveys anything&mdash;­pure
  evil. I was aware then, as clearly as if I&rsquo;d been told so outright,
  that he knew all about the woman&rsquo;s planned attack on me, that
  he&rsquo;d been a party to it, and that he wanted to get me back to the hut
  for a second and more successful effort. Of course, you can say if you like
  that I couldn&rsquo;t possibly deduce all these things from a mere look, but
  I say I could and DID. And it made me settle quite finally that I&rsquo;d got
  to cross that stream somehow or other. I told him so. He laughed and said he
  supposed I had a right to drown myself if I chose. Then he suddenly cried
  out, excitedly: &rsquo;You&rsquo;re not going! You&rsquo;re coming back with
  me!&rsquo; I answered, as calmly as I could: &rsquo;My dear Mirsky, nothing
  on earth would induce me to do that. If I can&rsquo;t get across now,
  I&rsquo;ll camp out here on the bank until the water lowers.&rsquo; He said:
  &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t like my establishment, then?&rsquo; I answered rather
  recklessly&mdash;­perhaps you know how sometimes an idea comes to you which,
  if you thought about it twice, you&rsquo;d reject, but it just captures you
  before you have time for the second thought. That&rsquo;s what was happening
  to me then, as I said: &rsquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mind your establishment at
  all, but I do object to being murdered in my sleep.&rsquo; I guessed that
  would bring things to a climax, but the precise climax it did lead to
  wasn&rsquo;t among those I was prepared for. A rather curious change came
  over him. He just nodded his head, very slowly; and, believe me, Oetzler, it
  was as if, for a moment, the curtain lifted and he became as sane as you or
  me. &lsquo;She&rsquo;s a devil, that woman is, Russell,&rsquo; he said, in
  quite a calm voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;you know, it rather got me, moved me in a sense&mdash;­his
  saying that, and the way he said it&mdash;­and I&rsquo;m not a very easy
  person to move. Perhaps it was partly his calling me by my name, for the
  first time. I put my hand on his dirty, sun-browned shoulder and said:
  &rsquo;Mirsky, don&rsquo;t be a fool&mdash;­come with me now&mdash;­this
  instant&mdash;­ let&rsquo;s both of us cross this damned river and get away.
  Come on&mdash;­ don&rsquo;t think of her again&mdash;­just come with
  me.&rsquo; I kept on talking, urging, waiting for him to say something in
  reply, and what he said at length was just the one
  word&mdash;­&rsquo;Clothes&rsquo;&mdash;­in a half-dazed voice. &lsquo;Oh,
  that&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; I replied. &rsquo;I can lend you things, and
  we&rsquo;ll get you a full rig-out in San Cristobal.&rsquo; &lsquo;San
  Cristobal?&rsquo; he echoed, as if the name reminded him of something. And
  then he made a remark which made me think, as I told you before, that his
  mind and memory must have undergone some peculiar twist. He said: &rsquo;I
  must send a cable when I get to San Cristobal. Raphael Rassova is dead. Did
  you know that?&rsquo; Well, of course I knew it, as everybody else does. I
  just made some vague answer, not wishing to begin any irrelevant argument.
  What I was most anxious for was to have him on the other side of that river.
  And I honestly think I should have succeeded but for one of those appalling
  mischances that change the entire pattern of fate. Hearing a sound in the
  distance, we both looked to see what it was, and there, waddling down the
  forest-track as fast as she could come, was that woman.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Russell leaned forward a little and took another drink; talking so much
  had made him a trifle husky. &ldquo;I assure you solemnly, Oetzler, that I
  very nearly killed her at that moment. And I suppose, by every civil and
  moral law, it would have been plain murder if I had done. Yet she seemed to
  me, as she approached, much more than someone who had tried to take my life.
  As a matter of fact, I almost forgot about that. She seemed more than any
  merely human personality&mdash;­rather the incarnation of all that keeps men
  enslaved, chained down. Do you know what I mean when I say she was too
  FEMALE?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lanberger nodded. &ldquo;Your kink again, Russell. But I do know what you
  mean. I wonder if women ever think a man is too MALE? Perhaps those chaps are
  that you see photographs of in the physical culture papers. ... But I&rsquo;m
  too interested in your yarn to want to interrupt it again. Do
  continue.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s very little left. Of course her coming made
  everything hopeless. The curtain re-descended on Mirsky&mdash;­he began to
  rant and shout, and though I tried to pacify him, it was clearly going to be
  no use. Then the woman said something, and instantly he went on again about
  the dangers of the water-crossing and how much better it would be if I were
  to return with him to the hut and wait a while. That sudden change of
  attitude, at the woman&rsquo;s bidding, struck me so sinisterly that I gave
  an immediate order to the guide, jumped on my mule, and plunged into the
  river. As a final proof that I had done wisely, the crossing turned out to be
  perfectly simple. There were no treacherous currents at all, and the water
  wasn&rsquo;t nearly as deep as Mirsky had made out. When I reached the other
  side I took what I guessed was a last look at him and shouted good-bye. But
  he was talking to the woman and didn&rsquo;t answer. Then I headed my beast
  into the forest and began the return journey to Yacaiba. That&rsquo;s
  all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He sighed gently as he prepared to let the other men talk. But for several
  minutes neither of them did so, and Oetzler merely pushed across the whisky
  and cigar-box. It was Lanberger who finally broke the silence. &ldquo;Well,
  at any rate,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I think any reasonable person will agree
  that you couldn&rsquo;t have done more. Not many would have done as
  much.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Oetzler nodded. &ldquo;I second that. It&rsquo;s a business I
  shouldn&rsquo;t myself have cared to face at all. A strange experience for
  you, Russell. I hope you feel that the mere uniqueness of it is some reward
  for its unpleasantness while it lasted.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; answered Russell, smiling. &ldquo;It will fit very
  nicely into my autobiography, I admit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Meanwhile,&rdquo; Oetzler went on, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s one awkward
  problem left over from it. What am I going to write to the girl in
  Paris?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;His sister? H&rsquo;m... that is a problem. What sort of person is
  she?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t much idea, but I gather she&rsquo;s the widow of a
  Frenchman, has no money, and supports herself by some rather paltry job. The
  usual emigré tragedy. She and her brother are all of the family that have
  survived. She seems to be very much attached to him&mdash;­for the last few
  months she&rsquo;s been writing to me constantly, asking where he is and why
  she hasn&rsquo;t heard from him. I don&rsquo;t suppose, but for her,
  I&rsquo;d really have bothered you to make any enquiries.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Does she know he went to Maramba?&rdquo; Lanberger asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I told her all that. And his last letter to her was from
  Rio, saying he was just about to set out for the earthquake zone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;ll feel inclined to tell her
  the exact truth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good God, no! She probably wouldn&rsquo;t believe me, and even if
  she did, she&rsquo;d only want to go out there right away and discover things
  for herself. But I shall be compelled to tell her something, after my promise
  to have enquiries made.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They discussed the matter for some time, but Russell did not join in; he
  seemed fatigued after his narration, and at length rose to go. Oetzler went
  down with him to the front door, leaving Lanberger in the library. They
  chatted a moment till the arrival of a cab, and then shook hands. Probably
  Russell would have visited a good many other outlandish places before they
  met again, Oetzler reflected.</p>

  <p>As he climbed again the short flight of stairs to rejoin his guest, he
  rather wished that Lanberger were not staying with him. The man had been
  amusing enough at dinner, but he was too tiresomely decorative for a
  conversation à deux. No doubt at that very moment he was thinking of
  something clever to say. Oetzler felt he would rather have been alone. The
  evening had left him with a curious feeling of depression&mdash;­curious
  because he could not, as so often, whisk it away by a merely cynical twist of
  thought. The talk at dinner and Russell&rsquo;s long story somehow balanced
  each other in his mind&mdash;­two pictures of a world that made him glad he
  was an old man.</p>

  <p>When he entered the library Lanberger had lit a fresh cigar and was
  evidently ready for an eager resumption of the conversation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An extraordinary yarn, Oetzler,&rdquo; he began, puffing excitedly.
  &ldquo;Most good of you to let me in for it. As a novelist, I found it
  horribly fascinating. But, you know, the character in the story that
  interested me most of all was not Mirsky, nor even the woman, but Russell
  himself. What a man! It&rsquo;s rare that you get a real self-revelation like
  that. His kink about the woman... most remarkable. He admitted himself that
  we must make allowance for it. On the whole, I think it&rsquo;s a pity he
  didn&rsquo;t bring back a few photographs.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because she mightn&rsquo;t have looked, to us, quite so awful as he
  made out. I&rsquo;m not suggesting that she was a beauty, of
  course&mdash;­merely that the peculiar quality of horror that Russell managed
  to convey to us may not have been so much in the woman&rsquo;s body as in his
  own mind.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; said Oetzler. He walked to the window, pulled back
  the curtains, and gazed upwards to a string of lights crowning the dark
  oblong of a neighbouring skyscraper. He felt very restless. What a bore these
  brilliant talkers were apt to be, when you had them all to yourself! He felt,
  as he sometimes did when he spent too much time in the atmosphere of his own
  newspaper office, the astonishing futility of words. There was a spate of
  them now, as never before in history&mdash;­newspapers, books, the
  radio&mdash;­yet in the whole lot was there as much eternal truth as in, say,
  the single statement of the Binomial Theorem? Which, by the way, was as far
  as he had ever got in mathematics. He sighed as he thought of his own giant
  presses at that moment preparing the word-stream which, in a few short hours,
  would suffuse the mentalities of millions of breakfasters and travellers to
  business. Never had there been more skilled manipulators of the thousands of
  items in the vocabulary; indeed, the game of everlasting permutation and
  combination and repetition had reached the dimensions of a giant industry.
  Yet was there more truth in the world, or a keener perception of the meaning
  of things, than if mankind had been created deaf and dumb?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not that that spoils the tale,&rdquo; Lanberger added, pendantly to
  his previous remark. &ldquo;On the contrary, it&rsquo;s the interplay of the
  first-personal with the third-personal that makes the &lsquo;I&rsquo;
  technique so interesting. I know that well enough, as a novelist. I wonder if
  Russell really intends to use the story?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should think he does,&rdquo; answered Oetzler, with a smile.
  &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a word-hound like yourself, you know. Well, perhaps not
  quite like yourself. He&rsquo;s one of those writer-men-of-action who go
  rooting about the world so that we can all sit in arm-chairs at home and
  enjoy their discomforts. Schadenfreude&mdash;­isn&rsquo;t that what we
  Germans call it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a talented writer, I should imagine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You say that disparagingly?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not in respect of Russell personally, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of writers in general, then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Oetzler laughed. &ldquo;Perhaps a little. As a matter of fact, such an
  evening as we&rsquo;ve just spent puts me in mind of Huxley&rsquo;s little
  illustration about the monkey and the typewriter&mdash;­do you remember it?
  He said that if one were to allow a monkey to fool about with a typewriter
  for long enough, sooner or later, according to the laws of probability, the
  creature would type out all the books that have ever been written.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By pure chance?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. That&rsquo;s mathematically quite sound, I understand. And, so
  far as I can see, it seems just as true that, sooner or later, the monkey in
  the same way would type out, not only all the stuff that has been written,
  but also some equally wonderful stuff that hasn&rsquo;t. Limiting ourselves a
  little, shall we say a sonnet fit for the best highbrow monthly with thick
  paper and wide margins?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What an amusing idea!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, and it&rsquo;s even more amusing when you reflect that by the
  laws of chance this sonnet-phenomenon is just as likely to take place
  immediately as a million or a trillion years hence. So that if we were to set
  our monkey at work to-night, it&rsquo;s just possible that we might come down
  to-morrow morning to find a genuine addition to literature all
  complete.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, what does it prove?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing at all, my dear Lanberger, except that genius, talent, and
  all that sort of thing is a little quicker in its results than a chance-
  impelled monkey. Quicker, I admit; but I don&rsquo;t think we can say surer.
  And who knows if mere quickness is any particular virtue in a universe where
  there seems to be time as well as space enough for everything?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I change my mind about your theory being amusing. I think
  it&rsquo;s infinitely depressing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps. But please don&rsquo;t call it MY theory&mdash;­I&rsquo;m
  not nearly mathematician enough. As a matter of fact, I first heard it
  advanced&mdash;­not very seriously&mdash;­by an Englishman named Elliott who
  was over here for the War Debts negotiations in &rsquo;twenty-three. He came
  here one night and thawed out wonderfully after dinner, as Englishmen very
  often do. Interesting fellow&mdash;­I see, by the way, that he&rsquo;s just
  been given a post in the British Cabinet... Well, well, Lanberger, after all
  that I really think we ought to go to bed. Not quite the hour to turn to
  metaphysics....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A few moments later, as they were both on their way to their respective
  rooms, Oetzler suddenly decided what he had better write to the girl in
  Paris.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap8"
     id="chap8">CHAPTER EIGHT. &mdash; PAULA COURVIER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">All day Paula had been very busy, for the delegations were
  due to arrive that evening, and they had engaged the whole of the first and
  second floors.</p>

  <p>The Hôtel Corona occupied a well-chosen position at the fashionable end of
  the city. From its green-uniformed porters who waited at the railway- station
  to its lions couchant on either side of the main portico, it radiated a faint
  flavour of the pre-War Baedeker. Almost one expected to find its halls
  crowded with moustached Englishmen in tweed ulsters enquiring the times of
  diligences. It had five storeys, between three and four hundred apartments,
  and a dining-room that had at one time or another ministered to the wants of
  most Europeans over fifty and possessed of a yearly income exceeding a
  hundred thousand francs. Since the War its original air of quite Britannic
  majesty had been tinged from a more distant source, and there was now a
  cocktail-bar of immense sophistication as well as iced water for the
  asking.</p>

  <p>Looking at the Hôtel Corona in the spring of 1932, one could not but feel
  a tide in the affairs of men that was lapping round it in a new direction,
  preparatory, maybe, to leaving it altogether. It still faced the lake like a
  starched shirt-front, living to all outward appearances that life of
  perpetual evening-dress for which it had been designed. But inside, the
  atmosphere was changed. For eighteen months the third and fourth floors had
  been closed entirely, and for a year the grand dining-room had been used only
  for occasional festivities. The grey-bearded head-porter stood in the lobby
  with a forlorn air of waiting for grand-dukes that might arrive at any
  moment. But the grand-dukes no longer arrived. The most that were now to be
  expected were diplomatists with leather satchels, hustling journalists who
  asked for beer at dinner, and that new post-War phenomenon&mdash;­the typist
  cocotte.</p>

  <p>Still, the &ldquo;Corona&rdquo; survived if it did not flourish, and its
  suave proprietor, M. Capel, was by no means disposed to object to the new-
  fashioned invasion. On the contrary, he had reopened the dining-room, engaged
  extra waiters and chambermaids, arranged special rooms for meetings, and laid
  in copious stocks of hotel notepaper. Nor had he shown much agitation when
  the president of the Polish delegation had rung him up from Warsaw and
  threatened to cancel bookings if the Soviet delegation were to be housed on
  the same premises. M. Capel knew that at an international conference such
  preliminary roulades were to be expected; and, what was more to the point he
  knew that the Polish delegation comprised only thirty odd, while the Russians
  numbered over eighty. Hence he had accepted the ultimatum resignedly and had
  straightway communicated with the Germans in Berlin and undercut the
  quotation of his rival, the Grand Hotel Moderne, along the road.</p>

  <p>It was all fixed up, therefore, that the Germans and Russians were to have
  the whole of the first and second floors, and Paula Courvier, who was one of
  the extra chambermaids, had thus been kept busy from very early morning on
  that sunny day in May.</p>

  <p>Not only the hotel, and all the other hotels, but the whole city and
  district were in a similar froth of excitement. International conferences
  were no novelties, but this one promised to be a record both for size and
  duration. Which meant that everything and everyone was prepared and
  expectant&mdash;­shops, theatres, newspapers, railways, taxicabs, the post
  office&mdash;­not a trade in the city, from laundries to lung-specialists,
  but looked for an augmentation of prosperity. Already during the fourteen
  years of the new era a considerable vested interest in peace had arisen, not
  dissimilar to that of Essen or Creusot in war; the municipality, indeed,
  might well have changed its motto to &ldquo;Ex Pace Lucellum.&rdquo; For some
  days before the official conference-opening, the advance-guard had been
  arriving by every schnell-zug and train de luxe&mdash;­secretaries,
  publicists, interpreters, experts representing various interests, social
  hangers-on, and bevies of demi-mondaines from Berlin and Paris who were
  prepared to intersperse their pleasantries with trifles of eavesdropping and
  minor espionage. Peace had its victories a little less than war, and though
  the decorativeness of old- style diplomacy might be lacking, these
  morning-coated Metternichs and tweed- suited Talleyrands had their raffish
  moments&mdash;­ often of a kind to shock the respectable bourgeois
  inhabitants of the neighbourhood. Was it really possible that the celebrated
  authors of memoranda and draft-protocols were THAT sort of person? Alas, it
  was possible; but if one sold malmaisons or had shares in the local brewery,
  it was also possible to be tolerant.</p>

  <p>So, from the ends of the earth, during those spring days, there gathered
  together the hirelings and the subordinates, followed in due course by the
  principals themselves. It was a General Council of the new and so far
  unestablished Faith&mdash;­a Faith that had not yet had its Nicæa, much less
  its Trent. The streets were brilliant with flags and banners, and noisy with
  chatter in many languages; a stroll of ten minutes&rsquo; duration had much
  of the interest and few of the inconveniences of a world-tour. Here an
  immaculate Japanese was buying a picture-postcard at a kiosk; there a group
  of German journalists, elaborately shabby, sat clinking glasses at a café
  table. Finally, towards sunset on the day before the conference-opening, a
  train of teak-brown coaches arrived from the east and disgorged on to the
  station platform a last consignment of hierarchy. Debonair even after their
  long journeys, they spilled into taxicabs and tipped according to the degree
  of lavishness with which their governments had endowed them.</p>

  <p>By a different train, about an hour earlier, there had arrived the usual
  day-mail from Marseilles, and most evenings, towards seven o&rsquo;clock, it
  was Paula&rsquo;s habit to slip out, if she could manage it, across the road
  to the post office and enquire if there were anything &ldquo;poste
  restante&rdquo; for her. She did so on this occasion, and with the usual
  result. When she re- entered the Hôtel Corona by a side-door, the delegations
  were just arriving by the front, and all was in commotion. She went up
  immediately to attend to her duties on the second floor.</p>

  <p>These duties were arduous, but simple. Over her head, as she sat in an
  alcove at one end of the long corridor, were eighteen numbered bells,
  representing the eighteen rooms under her charge. If there was a ring, she
  had to hasten to the corresponding room; but during the often long intervals
  of waiting she could read or sew if she cared. In the evenings, however, the
  corridor light was so poor that she usually did nothing at all, except fall
  into a doze. Her hours were from 6 a.m. until 2 p.m. and from 2 p.m. until
  midnight, on alternate days, and with only short pauses for meals. M. Capel
  had known how to drive a hard bargain.</p>

  <p>She had been at the &ldquo;Corona&rdquo; for just a week, and it was her
  first experience of such work. Before that, there had been nightmarish months
  of slowly encroaching poverty, as her income as a music-teacher had felt the
  full blast of the world-slump. Before that, she had had for a time the post
  of governess to an epileptic child; and before even that, she had been the
  wife of a casino-croupier, who had finally left her with nothing of any
  commercial value except French nationality. And in the days before wifehood
  there had been the gradual, bitterly reluctant acceptance of changed times
  and facts&mdash;­the bartering of jewels in back-parlours of shops, the
  signing of &ldquo;Paula Mirsky&rdquo; with less and less of a flourish as one
  came to realise how little it counted. Farthest of all, came those ancient
  days before 1917, and still more anciently before 1914&mdash;­one dreamed of
  them sometimes, but one tried not to remember.</p>

  <p>Paula was now thirty-three&mdash;­tall, dark-haired, sombre-eyed,
  slender-nosed, always rather pale. Her husband, a swaggering Provençal, had
  been consistently unfaithful, but that had not mattered much, because she had
  married only in the first panic of finding herself without money. After two
  years of him she had had enough of men, and the enoughness was written
  genuinely in her face.</p>

  <p>As she took her post at the end of the corridor that evening she felt, in
  the same genuine way, that she had probably had enough of life as well. Still
  no letter from Leon. Still no information about him from anyone. She sat down
  on the small, cane-bottomed chair and faced the now familiar vista of doors
  and carpet. There was a murmurous stir from below&mdash;­sounds of voices, of
  luggage being moved, of lift-doors clanging, the whine of the ascending
  compartments. Soon the noise invaded her own corridor, but it did not concern
  her yet; she sat motionlessly, while porters passed her with heavy trunks,
  page- boys skipped ahead of men in large travelling overcoats who sauntered
  along with their hands searching for small change. The delegations, she
  thought, in a kind of daze. Then, inevitably, the bells above her head began
  to ring.</p>

  <p>For an hour or more after that she was continually busy. There was no
  running water in the second-floor bedrooms, and as most of the arrivals
  wanted to wash, she had to fill cans of hot water from the tap adjoining the
  bathrooms. Some of the men were obvious Germans and looked pleased when she
  replied to them in that language, which she spoke fairly well; but her
  accommodation had been automatic. She had little interest in personal
  identities; they were all no more to her than the occupants of certain rooms.
  She felt fatigued and listless; her legs took her backwards and forwards, but
  her mind all the time was clogged with wondering about Leon and why he had
  not written. In one of the rooms, Number Two-five-seven, a man began some
  long story about his luggage having gone astray; he spoke in school-book
  French, and had a deep, rather husky voice which somehow did not match his
  face, which was very round and red and shining. He went on with his story,
  which finally led to a request for some soap. &ldquo;Soap?&rdquo; she echoed,
  picking up the trail of a speech to which she had not really been listening.
  But then he suddenly said: &ldquo;Pardon, m&rsquo;mselle, you look ill.
  Don&rsquo;t bother about the soap&mdash;­I can do without it for the time
  being.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But no, I can get you some.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When she brought it to his room he was talking in German with a group of
  other men; he just said &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; and she left it on the
  wash-hand basin. Then she went back to her chair in the alcove. Most of the
  arrivals had already gone down to dinner; it would be a slack time now until
  about ten o&rsquo;clock. She closed her eyes, and the feeling came to her
  once more that life was just no good at all unless she were soon to hear from
  Leon.</p>

  <p>She had not seen him since 1927, when he had been over on a short holiday
  from New York, but he had always (until of late) written to her regularly,
  and had sometimes helped her by small remittances. She had cherished all
  along the most confident belief in his genius, and had read and re-read the
  art-critiques which he sent her from time to time. Her feeling for him was
  somehow deeper than that of sister for brother, deeper even than that of one
  survivor of a family for the only other. He represented, to her, the bare
  chance of rising, phoenix-like, out of the ashes of disaster; he was the only
  living link between the past and any sort of a future. The very fact that,
  but for his one short visit, she had not seen him since the darkest days of
  all, gave emphasis to this symbolism; for he alone, it seemed, had acquired a
  second status after events had robbed him of his first. To become a famous
  New York art-critic instead of a wealthy landowner near Rostov-on-Don was not
  too bad an exchange; it was possible, anyhow, to think of it hopefully. And
  she had been thinking of it hopefully for ten years. It stood for all that
  was &ldquo;not quite&rdquo; in the totality of ruin.</p>

  <p>The long evening began; the man who had asked for the soap passed with his
  friends on the way to the lift, still talking animatedly. She did not often
  notice faces, but she could not help looking at his&mdash;­it was so cheerful
  and pink, like a grown-up choir-boy&rsquo;s, she thought.... Then, after the
  clang of the lift-gate, she was alone in the muffled silence. It was at such
  moments that, though she tried to forbid them, the memories came&mdash;­of
  Yalta, in the Crimea, where her parents had had a villa when she and Leon
  were children; of Eastertide in St. Petersburg; of hotels like the
  &ldquo;Corona&rdquo; at which she had stayed as a girl. For her father had
  been extremely rich, and she and Leon had already seen a good deal of Europe
  before 1914. She had many memories of Switzerland, the Rhine, Vienna, Berlin,
  Dresden, and Rome; of her father, tall and fur-coated, losing his temper with
  railway- porters, and of her mother dutifully pacifying him; and of Leon in
  his cultured voice instructing them during their perambulations of Italian
  picture- galleries. But her most poignant memory was of Leon in the
  tight-fitting, gold- laced uniform of his crack regiment. Only the fact that
  he didn&rsquo;t sympathise with it had prevented him from fighting heroically
  in the war against the Germans; she was sure of that, and sure also that his
  attitude had been thoroughly right. For had not that war, after all, led
  directly to the Revolution? Oh, if only... if only...</p>

  <p>It always came to that, in the end. Pictures raced through her mind, like
  a worn and flickering cinema-film, meaningless except for that single
  torturing motif&mdash;­if only.... So much of all that had happened could
  have been avoided; so much of it very nearly hadn&rsquo;t happened. If, for
  instance, the English had burst through the Dardanelles and taken
  Constantinople in 1915? Or if Denikin had had just a featherweight of better
  luck in 1919? If only these, to take but two of the vividest near-happenings,
  had eventuated, then she would not be listening for bells in a hotel corridor
  in 1932, nor Leon have been sent to the edge of the world to report an
  earthquake.</p>

  <p>She fell into a doze and did not waken till one of the bells began to
  tinkle. It was after ten; she would be busy from now on, carrying more hot
  water. Just before midnight, when her duty ended, the man with the choir-boy
  face passed her alone, going to his room. &ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; he called
  out. &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re feeling better now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, thank you,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Good night,
  sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He had a pleasant smile, she thought, as she undressed a few minutes later
  in the drab attic which she shared with another hotel servant.</p>

  <p>In the morning it was her turn to begin work at six. Two hours later she
  tapped on the door of Number Two-five-seven and received a deep-voiced,
  cheerful reply. She filled a can of hot water and placed it on the mat
  outside the door. Next the boots brought along a pair of brown brogue shoes.
  Then the waiter arrived with coffee and croissants. Finally came the porter
  bringing a trunk and suit-cases&mdash;­evidently the luggage that had gone
  astray the previous evening. She felt what she so rarely felt&mdash;­a tinge
  of personal curiosity, in return, as it were, for the man&rsquo;s previous
  enquiry about her. She glanced casually, in passing, at the labels on the
  luggage; they bore the name &ldquo;Tribourov&rdquo; and the emblematic seals
  of the U.S.S.R.</p>

  <p>That gave her a shock. She had assumed, without ever wondering much, that
  the man was German. And then the labels on the bags, names of Russian cities
  printed in Russian characters... they brought her face to face with something
  she was hardly prepared for. She had known, of course, as all the staff knew,
  that the Russian delegation were coming to the hotel, and she had known, too,
  if she had ever considered the matter, that they would all be Reds (what else
  could they be, indeed?), yet somehow she had not expected their identities to
  concern her any more than those of other hotel visitors.</p>

  <p>This man Tribourov was, incidentally, the first Soviet personage of any
  consequence whom she had ever seen. Before 1919, when she had escaped from
  Russia, her contacts had all been with soldiers, minor officials, and
  miscellaneous ruffiandom; such men as Lenin, Trotsky, Kameneff, Radek and the
  rest, were mere names to her as to the rest of the world, though she felt for
  them a fierce, blistering detestation that was shared by most of her
  companions in exile. The so-called hatreds of the actually warring nations
  were mild beside it, and proved their mildness by collapsing like pricked
  balloons after the Armistice, leaving no greater soreness than between ally
  and ally. But the loathing of White for Red, of the dispossessed for the
  aggrandisers, was a darker, more searing thing, a poison in the blood, which
  ten years of banishment had sharpened rather than assuaged. There were men in
  Paris, in Berlin, and along the coastline of the Riviera, whom a chance-seen
  photograph of Lenin could suddenly intoxicate with rage; they hated that
  dome-like Mongol face with a hate that came less from their heads than from
  their bowels. And in their waking dreams they saw themselves warriors
  recrossing frontiers of time as well as space, wading back through rivers of
  blood to the gilded salons of 1914. The least thing could quicken the ferment
  of such anticipations&mdash;­a glass of Clicquot stood them by a friend, a
  glimpse of glittering epaulettes, the sound of a band playing
  Tchaikovsky.</p>

  <p>And if this were true of men, it was doubly so of the women, whose
  dispossessions had often been more humiliating. There came a day in their
  lives when they had sold the last jewel to the last Jew, when they found that
  the tale of gentle birth merely bored where it did not antagonise; then,
  taking the plunge, they became French, German, Swiss, burying the past in its
  own black memories. Sometimes, like Paula Mirsky, they married foreigners and
  acquired a new nationality in law. By their neighbours, employers, and
  new-found companions the past was not only unknown, but unsuspected; and even
  in their own souls it might seem to die. Then, abruptly, something would set
  the old fires re-flickering.</p>

  <p>This happened to Paula when she saw the labels on Tribourov&rsquo;s
  luggage. There were similar labels on other men&rsquo;s luggage, but only
  Tribourov&rsquo;s affected her, because only Tribourov had made her aware of
  him personally. The rest were mere embodiments of room-numbers; he alone was
  a man, and as a man he invaded her life. He was, she had thought at first,
  like a grown-up choir-boy, and the rather impressionist description still
  stood when she noticed him further. And it was perhaps appropriate that his
  first contact with her had been in connection with a demand for soap. For his
  face looked always as if it had just been scrubbed; there was that ripe,
  schoolboyish freshness about his skin. It was in his manner, too; he was
  always cheerful, brisk, jauntily good-humoured. He had a deep laugh, and
  seemed very popular, not only with his fellow-delegates, but with Germans and
  visitors of other nationalities. Usually, as he came striding along the
  corridor, he wore a black felt hat that was pushed a little too far back on
  his head, and smoked a cheap Maryland cigarette which, as often as not, he
  threw away half-finished into the plant-pot near the lift. There was nothing
  really striking about him; he was average in height and figure for the
  middle-aged man that he was, and it seemed somehow irrelevant as well as
  impossible to decide whether his looks were good or otherwise. He was
  certainly not handsome in any conventional sense.</p>

  <p>She felt, in observing him, a sensation that was partly one of horror, and
  she had the same feeling when she was attending to his room. Cheerfully he
  strode, as it seemed to her, over the ruined lives of such as herself; and
  with that same jaunty briskness he held control of the blood-guilty machine.
  She avoided his eyes when they met, and never answered his occasional remarks
  with more than the minimum of words. Even contact with his possessions
  stirred her inwardly; there was a photograph of a woman which he had put on
  his dressing- table, and she felt a contempt for both the pictured face and
  for the sentimentality of the man who carried such a reminder about with him.
  His wife, she presumed, if men such as he had any use for the term; and she
  imagined them living in absurd magnificence in some mansion that had belonged
  to a pre- Revolution aristocrat. Probably the silver frame of the photograph
  had a similar history.</p>

  <p>Once, when she brought him hot water before dinner, he said suddenly:
  &ldquo;I heard you talking in German this morning to the man across the
  corridor. You speak it very well.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She smiled slightly without replying.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Better talk in German to me in future,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;My
  French isn&rsquo;t very good.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you prefer, certainly, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He then continued, in fluent and well-accented German: &ldquo;They work
  you long hours in this place.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve nothing to complain about.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No? Do you get decently fed?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Quite.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He threw his half smoked cigarette into the empty fire-grate&mdash;­
  where, she reflected, she would later on have to clear it up. &ldquo;Look
  here, I&rsquo;m not talking to you as a superior to an inferior. If you find
  my questions impertinent, you can say so&mdash;­and, on the other hand, if
  you don&rsquo;t find them so, you can answer them with more than &lsquo;Yes,
  sir,&rsquo; and &lsquo;No, sir.&rsquo; I&rsquo;m interested in the wages and
  conditions of hotel-workers, because a little while ago I carried out a
  reorganisation of the hotel industry in Moscow and other big cities in the
  Union.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Still she made no reply, and after a pause he went on, abruptly:<br>
  &ldquo;Well, thank you for bringing me the water.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She had snubbed him, she told herself as she left his room; and her heart
  glowed with a nearer approach to ecstasy than she had felt for a long
  time.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the Conference was in full swing, providing daily columns for
  hundreds of newspapers throughout the world. Paula, however, did not often
  read newspapers. That core of inward bitterness left her little feeling of
  concern with the strange hazards and groupings of the post-War nations, and
  it was quite by chance that she saw Tribourov&rsquo;s name and photograph in
  a local journal, together with a report of a speech he had made. She read it
  scornfully, finding in it all kinds of unlikeable qualities, from hypocrisy
  to errors of style. Yet the odd thing was that while she was reading she
  could both see and hear the man&mdash;­could hear his deep voice uttering
  certain words as she knew he would utter them, and could see his round,
  glistening cheeks bulging with excitement as she knew they would.</p>

  <p>One afternoon he met her in the post office, where she had just received
  the usual reply that no letters had arrived for her. He raised his hat and
  passed some comment on the weather, after which she saw him walk over to the
  telephones. Two heavily-built men accompanied him across the crowded floor
  and stood outside the door of the box.</p>

  <p>That evening, when she made her usual visit to his room, he said
  cheerfully: &ldquo;Oh, did you notice my bodyguard this afternoon? The
  Government insists on it&mdash;­for my safety.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; She had betrayed interest before she could check
  herself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I understand they&rsquo;ve discovered a plot to kill me. But
  I&rsquo;m not worrying, though it&rsquo;s a nuisance to have those two hefty
  fellows at my heels wherever I go. They&rsquo;re downstairs now, smoking long
  cigars and trying not to look like the most obvious plain-clothes detectives
  you ever set eyes on. It makes a man feel such a child.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She thought that he LOOKED like a child, too&mdash;­at that moment a child
  just slightly cross over a trifle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;as I said, I&rsquo;m not worrying. If
  they want to get me and try hard enough, I suppose they will. But they
  won&rsquo;t achieve anything much by it. There are plenty of others to carry
  on my work.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But it would be a gesture,&rdquo; she said quietly.</p>

  <p>He showed surprise at her remark&mdash;­the first one of any individuality
  that she had yet made. &ldquo;Oh, yes, I suppose you could call it
  that,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;But the world is tired of gestures. It cries
  out for acts that have a meaning in themselves. This
  Conference&mdash;­&rdquo; He stopped, laughed suddenly, and added:
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I should soon bore you if I were to begin talking
  about it. As you say, my assassination would be a gesture. And perhaps it
  couldn&rsquo;t happen more appropriately than here&mdash;­in this city of
  gestures.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As she arranged the towels on his wash-hand stand he went on:
  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky, anyhow, that I have no personal dependents.&rdquo;
  Her eyes strayed for an instant and he was quick to see and interpret the
  glance. &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ve noticed the photograph? That&rsquo;s my
  mother. She died ten years ago, in one of the influenza epidemics.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It had been little use snubbing him after all, she reflected later, during
  the long hours of waiting in the corridor. But his talk of assassination had
  curiously impressed her; and when, on the following morning, she looked out
  of one of the second-floor windows and saw him drive off in his car to the
  Conference, she had half-thoughts that she would never see him again. And,
  rather oddly, just about the middle of the morning there was great excitement
  among a group of waiters and chambermaids on one of the landings, and when
  she approached them she was sure they were going to tell her that the
  occupant of Number Two-five-seven had been killed. But it was only some
  business about a Spanish lottery in which one of the waiters thought he held
  a winning ticket.</p>

  <p>In the evening when she entered Tribourov&rsquo;s room he was writing at
  the small table under the window.</p>

  <p>She performed her various duties as quietly and quickly as possible and
  was about to go away when he swung round and called out: &ldquo;Hi, just a
  minute!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She stopped, with her hand on the door-knob.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be in such a hurry to go. I want to ask you something.
  Close the door again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She did so, and moved a few paces across the room towards him. He lit a
  cigarette and grinned that rather chubby, babyish smile. &ldquo;Look here...
  when you came in just now, I caught sight of your face in the mirror, and
  your look said: &lsquo;Oh, so he&rsquo;s still alive.&rsquo; Yet you
  didn&rsquo;t say anything. Don&rsquo;t you ever speak your mind?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She said, after a pause: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t wish to interrupt you in
  your work.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Or to be interrupted in yours, either, no doubt. You&rsquo;re not
  very encouraging. By the way, we must introduce ourselves. My name&rsquo;s
  Tribourov, as perhaps you already know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Courvier is mine,&rdquo; she answered, reluctantly but
  inevitably.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Courvier? That&rsquo;s French?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yet you speak German perfectly? You&rsquo;ll forgive my remarking
  that you aren&rsquo;t quite the usual type of person in this kind of
  job.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;­I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He laughed his deep, booming laugh. &ldquo;Well, I do know. And I should
  say, too, that you&rsquo;ve had a good education.... All this is leading
  somewhere, I assure you&mdash;­it isn&rsquo;t just inquisitiveness on my
  part. The fact is, I was talking to our local trade representative this
  morning&mdash;­he wants someone in his office with a thorough knowledge of
  German. So you see... it just occurred to me that the job might suit you
  better than this.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She stared at him in half-stupefied astonishment; it was the last thing
  she had ever expected, and the irony probed till she hardly knew whether she
  were feeling pleasure or pain, or being merely goaded to hysteria.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very kind of you,&rdquo; she managed to say at length.
  Just for a wild second she had the idea of telling him who she was, of making
  some kind of scene which would mean her leaving the hotel immediately. That
  she, of all persons, should be offered a post under the Soviets! That she
  should draw, as wages, a paltry fraction of the money that had been stolen
  from her! And yet, so complicated was life, here was this man contriving such
  a bitter jest out of what could only be pure kindliness of heart. She was
  angry, touched, and out of her depth in a sea of unfamiliar emotions; so that
  suddenly, standing there before him, she began to cry. She had rather thought
  that nothing more could ever make her do that. He sprang out of his chair at
  once and put his arm about her comfortingly, which made her cry all the more.
  &ldquo;Now, now,&rdquo; he kept saying, gruffly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that,
  don&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo; And again he performed that characteristic
  movement of throwing away the half-smoked cigarette.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she said, as soon as she could speak.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sorry? Oh, no, no, don&rsquo;t say that. It&rsquo;s all right. You
  mustn&rsquo;t upset yourself. As for the job, just think it over and let me
  know by the end of the week. No&mdash;­don&rsquo;t talk about it
  now&mdash;­there&rsquo;ll be plenty of time later on. Sit here a moment and
  let me show you something. These have just arrived from Moscow. They&rsquo;re
  photographs of a huge technical college that&rsquo;s nearly finished. Tell
  me, have you ever seen anything like it anywhere else?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was talking with a new eagerness, partly, she guessed, to fix her
  attention while she regained control of herself; but also with a personal
  enthusiasm that was obviously real. And here she was, again in this world of
  irony, admiring the vistas of class-rooms, and the palatial open-air
  terraces, as he described them to her in such exultant detail. &ldquo;This is
  going to be the finest technical college in the world. It&rsquo;s built on a
  site that used to be crowded with slums, and its entire yearly upkeep
  won&rsquo;t be as much as the rents that used to be paid to the
  slum-landlords. Perhaps you are interested in housing, by the way? I have
  some rather wonderful pictures of the new workmen&rsquo;s flats we&rsquo;re
  building&mdash;­let me show you&mdash;­&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But at that moment she heard the distant tinkle of one of her bells.
  &ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; she cried, getting up. &ldquo;Someone has rung for
  me. Thank you&mdash;­&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not at all. We must have another talk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But as soon as she was outside in the corridor she vowed that there should
  never be another talk. She was disturbed in mind as she had not been for
  years; all the emotions that she had buried deeply were raw and uncovered by
  such an encounter. She could not sleep that night, and the next day, when it
  came near her time for going on duty in the afternoon, she found herself in
  positive fear of that likely meeting with him again. Panic-stricken, she
  sought M. Capel and asked if she could be transferred to another floor. He
  was furious and refused to consider such a change; in that case, she said,
  she would have to leave, because the work was too hard in the rooms that had
  no running water. She had to think of some reason to give him. At this,
  however, he offered her a job in the hotel laundry, at a lower wage; which
  she accepted, on condition that she could go to it immediately.</p>

  <p>She felt out of a great danger when she had moved over. It was harder
  work, if anything, but at least it protected her from Tribourov. That,
  indeed, was the pitch to which she had been driven. She was fast becoming
  completely obsessed with the man. She seemed to find his name in every
  newspaper; that eager, apple-red face haunted her as soon as she closed her
  eyes. He represented, in her mind, all that she most passionately hated; yet
  the torture was in thinking of him also in a different way, as someone who
  had been kind to her. It upset all the neatly docketed past, the almost
  comfortable loathings and detestations that had held up the fabric of a
  decade&rsquo;s exile. But the worst was over now, she felt; and if she did
  not see him again, the fire would doubtless die down after a while and leave
  her as before.</p>

  <p>Then one morning, several days after she had begun her new work, Capel
  sent her a message that &ldquo;M. Tribourov, the gentleman in Number Two-
  fiveseven,&rdquo; would like to speak to her, and would she call on him in
  his room shortly before dinner that evening? She returned no answer, but
  registered a firm decision not to go. Yet throughout the day a storm of
  uncertainty raged behind the outward mind that she had made up; there was a
  wavering of the body that had no connection with head or brain. At six, when
  the day&rsquo;s work ended, she went to her attic bedroom and changed, as
  usual, into off-duty clothes. All the time she was doing this, she knew
  subconsciously that she was going to see Tribourov, though she still urged
  herself otherwise. At a quarter to seven she went to his room and knocked at
  the door. &ldquo;Entrez,&rdquo; she heard him call out, in his shamelessly
  bad accent.</p>

  <p>She went in. He was reading a newspaper and, as he saw her, flung the
  sheets aside with that familiar wave of the arm and rose to his feet. His
  voice, his movements, his round and smiling face&mdash;­how well-known they
  appeared, after such small acquaintance with them; her heart ticked them off,
  as it were, while she sank into the instant comfort of his presence.
  Recognising in that a new sensation, she was amazed to think what it
  proved&mdash;­that she had actually been wanting and longing to see him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve come...&rdquo; he began, striding towards her.
  &ldquo;What on earth possessed you to... run away... like that...?&rdquo; His
  words slowed down as if they had been braked by something in her eyes; for
  the first time she was returning his glance with a full one of her own. Then
  they moved to each other, in a curious, stumbling way. He asked her name.
  &ldquo;Your first name, I mean. WHAT? PAULA?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yours,&rdquo; she whispered, losing the last
  ache of mind and body in his caresses.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;PAUL.&rdquo; He shouted the word as if it were a command to an
  army. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny, isn&rsquo;t it?... But, Paula, why on
  earth... Capel, you know, told me about it....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to see you again&mdash;­that was
  why.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;THAT was why, eh?&rdquo; He began to laugh. &ldquo;Well, why
  THAT?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why anything? Why did you ask me here just now? Why did I come? Why
  did you ever talk to me, take any interest in me at all? Why couldn&rsquo;t
  we leave each other alone?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He answered, more seriously: &ldquo;Perhaps because we&rsquo;re flesh and
  blood in this city of desiccated lawgivers. For my part, after I&rsquo;ve
  heard my speeches translated three times&mdash;­first into French, then into
  English, then into German&mdash;­I feel... but no, don&rsquo;t let me talk
  about it. It&rsquo;s extraordinary, Paula&mdash;­this&mdash;­you, I mean. I
  was attracted from the beginning, but I had no idea... and I didn&rsquo;t
  care to...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She interrupted, half-hysterically: &ldquo;I know. You mean that
  you&rsquo;re not the type that goes about seducing chambermaids in hotels.
  You&rsquo;re a good man. A good Bolshevik.&rdquo; She laughed. &ldquo;But is
  it such a laughing matter, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He kissed her again, more gently, soothingly, as if aware that she was on
  the verge of complete emotional collapse. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go out,&rdquo;
  he said, abruptly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll drive somewhere. Will you come with me?
  PLEASE, Paula....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She nodded, every nerve endorsing the decision.</p>

  <p>She met him by arrangement half an hour later, at a spot nearer the
  outskirts of the city; he was alone, muffled up, in a big open Mercedes
  touring- car. &ldquo;Jump in,&rdquo; he cried, with the excitement of a boy
  setting out for a picnic. &ldquo;I had a job to persuade my bodyguard not to
  follow, but I guess they&rsquo;ll have a fine chase if they try to.&rdquo;
  She clambered in and sat beside him.</p>

  <p>Her whole being responded to that drive in the starlight. It was as if for
  years certain of her nerves and muscles had been tightly clenched, and were
  now moving with painful, exquisite stiffness into freedom. The sensation of
  speed, of roadway and bright lights slipping past, the softness of the fur
  rug drawn up over her knees, the blue-black dimness of hill and
  mountain&mdash;­all were as candles lighting up the various caverns of
  memory. Yet memory was endurable because, for the first time in all her
  womanhood, it was balanced by anticipation; they would go somewhere inland to
  dine, he had suggested, and those few minutes and hours of the future were
  enough to turn the scale.</p>

  <p>He drove very fast, without talking much; and she sensed, as he sat close
  and silent, the deep personal power of the man. He was dynamic; he forged
  ahead, as he was making the car forge ahead now; he drove with zest, but had
  never less than complete control. His eyes, slate-blue and gentle, scattered
  a swift, ruthless benignity over the world. She felt that he could look at
  death, his own or another&rsquo;s, without a qualm; that he could order an
  execution, perhaps, with no more emotion than he would soon be ordering
  dinner. It was something to have wrung from such a man the confession that he
  had been attracted. Only of course, she hadn&rsquo;t wrung it; he had given
  it freely, almost casually. She felt that though he had been concerned enough
  to worry Capel about her, there were strict limits beyond which he would not
  advance an inch unless she were there to meet him. How enviable to be so
  calm, so assured, so blandly economical of one&rsquo;s desires! And with what
  mountainous simplicity he had indicated, in not quite so many words, that he
  hadn&rsquo;t realised she was the kind of woman who would let herself be
  petted! The recollection of it made her feel at once ashamed and passionately
  shameless....</p>

  <p>She had no idea where they were driving, and did not recognise the
  quaintly-built upland village at which they stopped. Some kind of fair or
  festival was in progress, and the hotel was crowded with revellers drinking
  and celebrating. Not the Conference, however; it was a relief to have escaped
  from the atmosphere of that. A youth with a mandolin was playing and singing
  one of those shrill, lilting tunes that had innumerable verses known to his
  audience; through occasional gaps in the din a loud-speaker shouted from
  Radio-Toulouse. The proprietor, even amidst the press of business, was not
  disposed to turn away two chance visitors in such an opulent-looking car. He
  rose to the situation gallantly and supplied an excellent dinner on a
  first-floor terrace that was a bower of pink geraniums tinted more deeply in
  the matching shade of the table-lamp.</p>

  <p>Tribourov waved aside the proprietor&rsquo;s apologies for the noise
  downstairs. &ldquo;I like it,&rdquo; he exclaimed, with deep gusto, and went
  on to explain further; but as the man quite obviously could not understand
  his stilted French, he turned to Paula and cried: &ldquo;Tell him I like it
  because I like real people&mdash;­tell him that after a week at the
  Conference&mdash;­no, no, better not mention that&mdash;­but tell him why I
  like it&mdash;­you know what I mean.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Afterwards he went on: &ldquo;These people shouting and singing make me
  feel as I do when I&rsquo;m in Russia&mdash;­living a life, not just acting
  in some rather bad charades. People&mdash;­just ordinary people all the world
  over&mdash;­always make me feel like that. How fine they are compared with
  the humbugs that govern them! Paula, to be here, with you, and amongst all
  this noise, is like returning to some sort of sanity. All week I&rsquo;ve
  felt like a rude boy in front of a lot of weary schoolmasters. So weary, they
  are&mdash;­so wearily scornful of what they haven&rsquo;t the faith to
  believe in or the energy to hate. They haven&rsquo;t even the energy to hate
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There are some who seem to have,&rdquo; she said quietly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Those who are supposed to be plotting to kill you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He laughed. &ldquo;Oh, a few half-crazed survivors of the old
  régime&mdash;­ yes, I grant you them. But theirs is only a sort of private
  feud.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You despise it for that reason?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s big enough to
  matter&mdash;­taking the long view, of course.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s a big thing to have to begin life
  afresh in a foreign country? Don&rsquo;t you ever fear the hate of those
  who&rsquo;ve been driven to it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If they begin life afresh, they have no time for hate. And if they
  hate, it shows they aren&rsquo;t beginning afresh. They&rsquo;re merely
  wasting time, letting memories turn sour inside them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I know what you mean,&rdquo; she answered, and gazed across
  the table with new and darker perception. She was aware that she loved and
  hated him simultaneously, with passion that clamoured equally for
  satisfaction of either emotion. She felt him, more than ever, part of the
  architecture of all her private and personal misery; yet as someone also who
  held the power of magic cancellation. Until that moment she had looked
  forward to the denouement, some time, of telling him who she was; but now,
  she realised, there would be no point in it; he had diagnosed her position,
  without knowing it was hers. She had let memories turn sour&mdash;­it was a
  true indictment. But what else, after all? Was every injustice to be
  forgotten and forgiven in the cold radiance of this man&rsquo;s benevolence?
  Or must one always, like nations, be wearied by debts owed and owing?</p>

  <p>Yet behind the stir of her thoughts her body was in many ecstasies. The
  food, the Liebfraumilch &rsquo;21, the velvet glow of the lamplight on the
  flowers, the murmur of voices and the brittle flan-flan of the
  mandolin&mdash;­all touched her with sheerly physical reminders. Life was
  short; twelve years of exile, and then this night&mdash;­how could one
  balance them, or need they balance at all? Something he had once said
  recurred to her: &ldquo;The world is tired of gestures; it cries out for acts
  that have a meaning in themselves.&rdquo; She felt again a strange power in
  him, reaching out in conquest that was partly rescue; and at that moment,
  from below, came the slur of a tango, wistful, gently insinuating. It made
  her lean forward across the coffee-cups and lay her hand over his wrist.
  &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand much more,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had enough of the music, Paula? If so,
  I&rsquo;ll&mdash;­&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, no, it isn&rsquo;t that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;ve had enough of me and my continual
  chatter?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, nor that either.&rdquo; She told him of his victory with her
  eyes. &ldquo;On the contrary, Paul.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good news. And a good dinner, too.... What would you
  like to do next?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her fingers tightened over his hand as she replied, in a slow, deliberate
  whisper: &ldquo;What would you like to do, Paul?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A few hours later he said, almost crossly: &ldquo;So you still won&rsquo;t
  tell me anything about yourself?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered, with tender finality. He had been
  questioning her relentlessly for some time. &ldquo;No, Paul, no. Not even in
  exchange for your own life-history. Let&rsquo;s both do without
  confessions.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They were in the small first-floor bedroom whose pine furniture and
  flowered window-boxes distilled a pleasant mixture of perfumes. All revelry
  below had long since ended, leaving only the church-bell to sprinkle the
  quarters over roofs that seemed to echo them almost metallically in the
  silence. Those chimes had marked the seconds in the short moment of
  ecstasy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you won&rsquo;t come back with me to Russia?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good heavens, no!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not joking, if that&rsquo;s what you think.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear Paul, I don&rsquo;t think and I don&rsquo;t
  care.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I suppose you don&rsquo;t love, either?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If this is love, then I do, for the time being. But don&rsquo;t you
  feel, Paul, that some things are only just to be touched? If you grasp them,
  they either break or escape.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s to be with you and me? Only the
  touch?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, if we&rsquo;re wise. You don&rsquo;t really care for women. I
  don&rsquo;t really care for men either. You have so many other
  interests&mdash;­so have I. It would be a great mistake for either of us
  to&mdash;­to exaggerate&mdash;­this.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see. You want me to regard you as if you were just any ordinary
  woman who might have come along?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Much more sensible, Paul, if you did.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Except that any ordinary woman wouldn&rsquo;t have even begun to
  attract me. You&rsquo;re quite right&mdash;­I&rsquo;m not particularly keen
  on women, as rule. But YOU... well, I find I want more of you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps if you are ever here at another of these big
  conferences&mdash;­&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I said MORE, not again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;More? What makes you suppose there is any more?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I believe there is, and I intend to make sure. By knowing you, I
  mean. I think we might find a fair amount of happiness in each
  other.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You think so?&rdquo; she cried, mockingly. &ldquo;You think
  <i>I</i> could?&rdquo; Suddenly she broke into hysterical sobbing. &ldquo;Oh,
  no, no, no&mdash;­I couldn&rsquo;t possibly stand you like that! Already
  you&rsquo;ve made nothing else matter to me for days and
  days&mdash;­you&rsquo;ve made me forget everything&mdash;­why, I even forgot
  to-night&mdash;­last night&mdash;­something that was always on my mind before
  I met you&mdash;­&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She told him then about her brother in America, and his confident,
  dominating manner changed at once to a pacifying tenderness. He took her into
  his arms and comforted her with intimacies that were childlike in their
  simplicity. &ldquo;But, my dear Paula, why on earth didn&rsquo;t you mention
  it? I had no idea you were so worried. We could easily have called at the
  post office on our way. But we&rsquo;ll go there first thing in the morning,
  anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was so kind, and she hated him for it almost as much as she loved him.
  &ldquo;But I FORGOT&mdash;­don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo; she cried, with sombre
  emotion.</p>

  <p>In the morning they drove back through spring sunshine and showers. He put
  her down at the post office and then drove himself on to the Conference. She
  had promised a further meeting, but had declined to fix any definite
  arrangements.</p>

  <p>When she asked if there were any letters and the clerk handed her one, she
  went very pale. It had the New York postmark.</p>

  <p>She opened and read it. Then she went out into the street and walked along
  past the shop-windows.</p>

  <p>An hour later she was still walking, vaguely from street to street. Her
  mind gave her questions that were like hammer-blows. Why had he ever gone to
  Maramba? Why had he gone to Rio, to America at all? What had driven him so
  far from his own home, to these fantastic places? Oh, if only... if
  only...</p>

  <p>She came to the post office again and went to the counter with the
  envelope. &ldquo;Can you tell me when this arrived?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yesterday afternoon,&rdquo; replied the clerk, glancing at it. He
  knew her by sight and added: &ldquo;It was here at the time you usually
  call.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She went out, trembling in a way that attracted attention from several
  persons who saw her.</p>

  <p>All that night the letter had been there waiting for her... all that
  night.</p>

  <p>A half-crazed survivor... and Leon dead....</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap9"
     id="chap9">CHAPTER NINE. &mdash; HENRY ELLIOTT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">When Elliott came downstairs on the morning of his sixtieth
  birthday, he felt glad to have been born at the right side of the year. It
  was all very well when you were young, having birthdays in late summer or
  autumn; but when you entered the seventh decade you wanted the leaves to be
  fresh on the trees and no sign of decay to greet you. There was enough of
  that in your own body, even if you were what was called a
  &ldquo;well-preserved&rdquo; man. Elliott, taking a mirrored glimpse of
  himself as he crossed the hall to the breakfast-room, could certainly
  congratulate himself on being that. He was tall, with not even the beginnings
  of a stoop, and no trace of a paunch either; and his hair was even more of an
  adornment than before it had turned grey. &ldquo;I ought to be good for
  another ten years,&rdquo; he reflected, blinking in the sunlight that poured
  through the mullioned windows. After all, Disraeli was premier at
  seventy-four, Gladstone at eighty-four... and Pitt at twenty-four, for that
  matter. Good heavens, think of it. It all proved, if it proved anything at
  all, that age didn&rsquo;t matter.</p>

  <p>As he entered the breakfast-room the Sealyhams scrambled around him, and
  his host&rsquo;s children, John and Rose and Elizabeth, got up rather shyly;
  the two girls smiled, but John, who was eleven and the eldest, spoke up:
  &ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Elliott. Many happy returns of the day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, John, thank you,&rdquo; he answered, in his rich, mellow
  voice; and then he bowed to his hostess, a tall, fair, beautiful woman of
  scarcely middle age, and said, with the quietness of old friendship:
  &ldquo;Good morning, Fanny.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Morning, Harry. I say the same as John, you know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He smiled and thanked her, and saw that the children were still shyly
  standing. &ldquo;Do please sit down,&rdquo; he added, and then, with a laugh:
  &ldquo;No, no, Fanny&mdash;­I&rsquo;ll serve myself&mdash;­I&rsquo;m not an
  old crock yet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thank goodness, he thought, as he gave himself an egg and some bacon, he
  could still eat like everybody else&mdash;­no fads about orange juice and
  rye-biscuits and that sort of thing. He carried the plate to the table and
  then saw that the cloth nearabouts was heaped with parcels tied up in
  coloured ribbon and each with a little label on it. He was surprised,
  scarcely realising what it all meant, at first; it hadn&rsquo;t somehow
  occurred to him that this would happen. &ldquo;To Mr. Elliott, with love from
  John.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To Harry, from Fanny, with best love.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To Harry, from Bill....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He knew that the children&rsquo;s eyes were intent on him.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to open a single one till your father comes
  down,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and then we&rsquo;ll all look
  together.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Father&rsquo;s in his bath,&rdquo; said John, with pluck.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know he is. He wished me many happy returns before any of
  you.&rdquo; And he laughed again. He was happy, and a little sad, because of
  all this birthday business.</p>

  <p>The Kennersleys&mdash;­Lord and Lady Kennersley&mdash;­were among his
  oldest friends. The family had helped him as a boy; it was in this same
  house, in the library, that he had received his first big encouragement. He
  had been a junior clerk in the company office then, at twenty-four&mdash;­the
  same age that Pitt was premier. &ldquo;I hear you&rsquo;re working for a
  scholarship to Oxford, Elliott. I hope you do well. And if it would help, you
  can take time off from now till the examination&mdash;­with pay, of
  course.&rdquo; That had been the old man, whom everyone had supposed to be so
  ferocious. Elliott had been very nervous of HIM, and nervous, too, of the big
  rooms and the fine furniture. And now, he reflected, the old man&rsquo;s
  grandchildren were actually nervous of him. They kept looking at him over the
  rim of their cups, and looking away when he caught them at it.</p>

  <p>Lord Kennersley entered, crisp, jovial, plus-foured for the day&rsquo;s
  activities. &ldquo;Hullo, kids. Undone the parcels yet, Harry?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m waiting for all of you to help me,&rdquo; Elliott
  answered.</p>

  <p>Kennersley was five years his junior; they had been friends at Oxford, and
  during Elliott&rsquo;s early career had shared bachelor rooms in London. Not
  until ten years after succeeding to the title had Kennersley married, and
  then, rather surprisingly to his friends, he had chosen a musical comedy
  actress, very much younger than himself, of no family, small education, but
  immense vivacity and charm. She had (it was currently reported) been his
  mistress first of all, and then, a eugenist malgré lui, he had very sensibly
  made her the mother of his heirs. The marriage had proved a quite astounding
  success. She had fitted herself to aristocratic domesticity as easily as to a
  new part in a play that was going to run for ever, she made an excellent wife
  and mother, and she had become delightfully popular amongst all
  Kennersley&rsquo;s intimates. Since his own wife&rsquo;s death, Elliott could
  certainly count her his greatest woman friend.</p>

  <p>Breakfast was held up indefinitely by the opening of the parcels. There
  was a gold cigarette-case from Bill, a leather wallet from Fanny, a tie-press
  from John, Blake&rsquo;s poems from Rose, and a leather-bound address-book
  from Elizabeth. Elliott thanked them all. How nice they were to him, but he
  wished the children weren&rsquo;t so shy. John blushed when Fanny said:
  &ldquo;He WOULD buy you a tie-press, Harry. He said you needed
  one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There seem to be about a million other things for you in the
  hall,&rdquo; said Kennersley, grinning. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to get
  Jevons to help you through with them afterwards. I had them all shoved on one
  side, so that you wouldn&rsquo;t be detained on the way clown. After all, we
  think we ought to come first.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You do,&rdquo; said Elliott sincerely.</p>

  <p>Then they all went on with their food, excited and happy after the little
  scene. Kennersley helped himself to enormous quantities of eggs and bacon and
  kidneys and sausages. &ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the programme to-day?&rdquo;
  he asked, at length.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the meeting at Sibleys at eleven. Then the executive
  at half-past five. To-night, of course, there&rsquo;s the big
  dinner.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not much of a birthday for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never mind. It&rsquo;s begun well.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He saw the cyclist newsboy pedalling up the drive with the morning papers,
  and a minute later the butler brought them in. Kennersley gave him his
  choice; he took The Times, but only glanced at the middle page. Kennersley
  took the Mail. &ldquo;Anything fresh?&rdquo; called out Fanny, as she poured
  more coffee. &ldquo;No, doesn&rsquo;t seem to be anything,&rdquo; muttered
  her husband, chewing hard.</p>

  <p>Elliott smiled to himself. War in China; Revolution in Salvador;
  Conference Hitch.... No, doesn&rsquo;t seem to be anything. Staring out of
  the window again, he could understand. It really did look as if Chilver were
  in the middle of a world in which nothing happened. The lawns sloped down to
  a belt of trees beyond which, at a mysteriously unreckonable distance, a line
  of wavy green-brown hills met the blue. There was no sound except the distant
  clank of a horse-drawn roller. Exquisite world! For centuries there had been
  no war at Chilver, no revolution, no hitch of any kind; but could one be sure
  that none was now threatening? Elliott felt suddenly oppressed with all the
  knowledge that these people did not share. This fine, friendly fellow, not
  much more than an overgrown boy, with his income of many thousands a year
  derived largely from coal-mining royalties, which he spent profusely on
  running model farms that did not pay and on giving employment to grooms,
  harness-makers, and jockeys; this charming girl-woman, daughter of a Notting
  Hill tobacconist, whose chief interest in life, next to her three lovely
  children and her husband, was the breeding of Sealyhams&mdash;­how casual and
  planless their lives were, and how unsure of survival in a world that might
  decide to take itself with scientific seriousness! Perhaps that sort of a
  world was coming. And then, whimsically, it occurred to him that even if it
  did come, England might, as usual, contrive some queer compromise, some
  amazing non sequitur like the British Commonwealth or the Thirty-Nine
  Articles.</p>

  <p>So Elliott&rsquo;s thoughts ran on, as he glanced through the newspaper,
  half-seeing the printed words, but half-watching the children watch him. He
  was very fond of children. He took up the volume of Blake&rsquo;s poems and
  smiled at Rose, who had given it him. &ldquo;This is a good book,&rdquo; he
  said. Then Fanny looked up and began to talk about poetry. She was really
  much more at home with dogs, but it was a weakness of hers to pretend that
  she was passionately interested in all &ldquo;cultured&rdquo; things. Bill
  made no such pretence, but he had a wholesome respect for what he believed to
  be his wife&rsquo;s superior enlightenments, and Elliott would have done
  anything rather than disabuse him. Charming and delightful Fanny&mdash;­and
  never more charming than when she was talking nonsense about literature.
  Elliott listened to her with an amused affection that made him want to ruffle
  her sunlit hair and ask her where she had learned it all. &ldquo;Yes,
  it&rsquo;s fine stuff&rsquo;,&rdquo; he agreed, when she made a pause.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wonder, Harry, if you would read the children
  something&mdash;­that marvellous poem&mdash;­you know the one I
  mean&mdash;­I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;d never forget it if you
  did&mdash;­&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Elliott wondered if he dare wink, very slightly, at John. He was sure they
  would never be allowed to forget it. It was another of Fanny&rsquo;s pleasant
  weaknesses&mdash;­like the visitors&rsquo; book in which everybody had to
  write something &ldquo;original.&rdquo; (Elliott had once rather shocked her,
  after a week-end, by writing: &ldquo;Thoroughly satisfied. At Cooking and
  Everything Tip-Top. Can cordially recommend Chilver to anyone who likes a
  real Home from Home.&rdquo;) He knew that years hence she would be saying at
  her dinner-parties: &ldquo;Do you remember, Rose, that morning when Mr.
  Elliott&mdash;­you know, THE Mr. Elliott&mdash;­read us that poem of
  Blake&rsquo;s out of the book you gave him for his sixtieth
  birthday?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he replied, and turned to the well-known lines
  which he guessed were probably all of Blake that Fanny had ever read. He
  began in a mood of gentle raillery, thinking of her, and wondering if the
  children were principally awed or bored, and noticing how the dogs
  half-asleep in front of the fire looked up curiously as they heard the
  different intonation. He had a beautiful voice, and he knew it, quite simply
  and without conceit. But when he came to the lines: &ldquo;I will not cease
  from mental fight, Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand,&rdquo; he was caught
  up by something both in himself and in the words. He was the fighter still,
  at sixty. He would not cease from mental fight, nor would his sword sleep in
  his hand, till he had built Jerusalem in England&rsquo;s green and pleasant
  land.... He finished, a little moved by the beauty of the words, but more by
  the beauty of the scene out-of- doors and by Rose&rsquo;s face turned to
  him.</p>

  <p>During the recital Jevons, his secretary, had quietly entered the room and
  now made his salutations. He was a slim, handsome, and extremely clever youth
  of thirty or so, with a well-bred cynicism that disguised emotion and opinion
  alike.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a grand poem,&rdquo; said Kennersley, to whom anything
  was poetry that had rhymes and was read in an odd sort of voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s good, Kennersley,&rdquo; said Jevons, dexterously
  slicing an egg on to his plate. &ldquo;But I always catch myself boggling at
  the word &lsquo;Jerusalem.&rsquo; It gives the poem a faintly Zionist
  flavour. And, anyhow, when you&rsquo;ve seen Jerusalem, you wouldn&rsquo;t
  want to build it anywhere.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Elliott laughed. &ldquo;My point, if it comes to that, is that I
  wouldn&rsquo;t want to build any city&mdash;­there are far too many already.
  I&rsquo;d leave the green and pleasant land alone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And so they went on rather frivolously chatting, until Kennersley&rsquo;s
  big Daimler, garlanded with pink rosettes, drove up to the front entrance.
  &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Kennersley said, seeing them off, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll
  have an enjoyable drive&mdash;­for the first twenty miles, at any rate. I
  hope everything goes along all right. We&rsquo;ll all be listening in to you
  at eight-thirty, and I&rsquo;ll be up when you get back. Goo&rsquo;bye.
  Goo&rsquo;bye, Jevons.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Elliott was thinking, as he swished through the lanes and villages:
  &ldquo;This is my constituency.&rdquo; ... He found it rather hard to
  realise. Those labourers in the field over there, and the man lowering the
  sun-blind outside that shop, were, by the inexorable casualness of English
  politics, installed for a moment as high instruments of fate. It had happened
  peculiarly. In a recent general election Elliott had won an industrial seat
  by a small margin. Then, several weeks later, when he had got well to work at
  his new Cabinet post, somebody had discovered certain technical
  irregularities that rendered the contest invalid. There had been no
  suggestion of moral culpability, and an Act of Indemnity had been rushed
  through Parliament to save him from the quite crippling fines to which he was
  liable; but no Act could spare him the trouble and expense of re-election.
  Nor was it beyond doubt that, with such a small majority, he would be
  re-elected. In this emergency, the machine of English politics had been swung
  to another angle, with the apparently inconsequent result that an elderly
  member for an exceptionally safe seat had applied for the Chiltern Hundreds.
  It had been hoped that Elliott would be elected without a fight, but at the
  last moment the local opposition party had put up a candidate.</p>

  <p>Thus Elliott found himself motoring on this May morning of his sixtieth
  birthday through the constituency of East Northsex. Occasionally, on small
  boards and in windows, he noticed the familiar command &ldquo;Vote for
  Elliott.&rdquo; He was certain to get in, for the Kennersley influence was
  still strong in the almost feudal countryside. There was only one place,
  Sibleys, in which he might expect opposition; it was on the edge of a mining
  area, and had a few factories, at one of which he had arranged to address a
  lunchtime meeting of workpeople.</p>

  <p>A freakish arrangement, when one came to think about it, he reflected.
  Fate might make of him the pivot on which the wheel revolved through Paris,
  Rome, Washington, Geneva; but England, parochial to the last, insisted on
  this geographical attachment to its own hills and vales. Whatever he was,
  history- maker or world-spokesman, he must remain the member for East
  Northsex, and in all his plans for the regeneration of mankind he dare not
  forget that Sibleys wanted power to run omnibuses or that Chilver was
  disappointed with its sewage arrangements. Perhaps it was not a bad method,
  in the way it worked out. But he despaired of explaining or justifying it to
  any highly intelligent foreigner.</p>

  <p>The sky was clouding over and drops of rain already speckled the car-
  windows. He looked out upon the changing scene, talked a little to Jevons,
  slit open envelopes and glanced through letters, turned to the newspaper
  again. The rich fields and unspoilt villages merged into a more urbanised
  area; tram-lines began; a horizon of coal-tips and chimneys lifted up. He had
  never been in this part of the country before, yet he was going to represent
  it&mdash;­ what a haphazard business! He said to Jevons, pointing ahead:
  &ldquo;Surely I don&rsquo;t take in all that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jevons laughed. &ldquo;Lucky for you you don&rsquo;t, sir. That&rsquo;s
  Loamington. Sibleys, which is where you end, is this side of it&mdash;­a sort
  of suburb.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The traffic thickened in narrowing, mud-splashed streets; rows of
  industrial cottages straddled a nearby hill like flying buttresses, and in
  the trough below it the flat roof of a factory gleamed pewter-coloured in the
  rain. &ldquo;Sibleys,&rdquo; said Jevons. Elliott looked out with interest,
  commenting: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever been here
  before.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No? But I thought you were a native of this county, sir?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So I am. I was born at Creeksend, about twenty miles the other side
  of Chilver. But I never came here in those days&mdash;­so far as I can
  recollect. Nor during any of my visits to Chilver since.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s hardly a spot they&rsquo;d take you to for a
  picnic, I admit. But don&rsquo;t tell the crowd it&rsquo;s your first visit.
  You see, we&rsquo;ve made a lot of your being a local man. A Northsex man for
  Northsex&mdash;­ you know the tag.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Elliott laughed. &ldquo;Dear me, Jevons, couldn&rsquo;t you think of
  anything more original?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I could; but I was very careful not to. Originality has lost many
  an election-contest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What a game it is... WHAT a game....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He felt a little weary, as he usually did, on the eve of a meeting. Not,
  of course, that he had any doubts or apprehensions about it. He had probably
  addressed some thousands of political gatherings during his career, and no
  amount of hostility or heckling ever bothered him. He had a good platform
  manner, a strong voice, and a quick brain that could turn a point against an
  interrupter without making a lifelong enemy of him. He was what was called
  &ldquo;popular.&rdquo; The cartoonists liked his hair, which they always
  converted into a sort of halo; thousands of people all over the country
  referred to him as &ldquo;Harry.&rdquo; He had no personal enemies that he
  knew of and all his privacies were public&mdash;­that his father had been a
  country schoolmaster, that his married life had been idyllic, that his two
  sons had been killed in the War, and that he enjoyed a good cigar.</p>

  <p>The car was threading a steep street in between rows of huddled, meanly-
  built dwellings, in some of whose windows he could see the display of his own
  name and photograph. Men and women stood at their doors, a few of them giving
  a cheer as he went by. The factory at the foot of the hill loomed suddenly
  close. &ldquo;Is this the place?&rdquo; he asked Jevons.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. You&rsquo;ll find them a pretty easy lot&mdash;­there WAS a
  time when they&rsquo;d have been FOR you to a man, but lately they&rsquo;ve
  come under the Loamington influence a little. Loamington&rsquo;s a hotbed, of
  course.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This place looks bad enough. Is there anything special I ought to
  know about it&mdash;­local unemployment, or anything?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jevons had been working in the constituency for some days and was, in this
  as in all other connections, a complete encyclopædia with the unencyclopædic
  knack of giving only as much information as was really wanted.
  &ldquo;Sibleys,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;depends on the factory, which
  makes machine-tools, and is on halftime at present. You&rsquo;ll probably
  hear a lot of complaints about housing. The trouble is, all this property is
  nearly a hundred years old and the landlords nowadays can&rsquo;t afford to
  do repairs. It&rsquo;s mostly leasehold. The Kennersleys own the ground
  rents.... Oh, and there&rsquo;s one other thing you might make a note
  of&mdash;­there&rsquo;s a fellow named Collins in the Loamington football
  team&mdash;­he comes from Sibleys and the folks are very proud of him....
  That&rsquo;s all, I think.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Elliott nodded. Invaluable fellow, Jevons. The car swung through wide open
  gates into an ugly courtyard and pulled up outside a block of offices. A fat
  man in morning coat and spats, looking rather ridiculous as he stood in the
  rain, seized the door-handle and gave Elliott an effusive welcome. Elliott,
  who was dressed in an ordinary and, if anything, rather shabby lounge-suit,
  remembered him as Sir Compton Turnpenny, one of the New Year&rsquo;s knights.
  They had met before; Elliott had trained himself to have a good memory for
  faces. He offered congratulations, introduced Jevons, and then passed into
  the offices, where there were introductions of various other men, whom he
  similarly and quite automatically memorised for the future. He chatted about
  the weather and declined a drink. Fortunately, just before the time arranged
  for the meeting, the rain stopped, and he walked out, with Turnpenny, Jevons,
  and the rest, to an improvised platform in an inner yard with a littered
  horizon of bricks and slates. England&rsquo;s green and pleasant land... he
  could not help thinking, not with irony, but with deep compassion for anyone
  compelled to live amidst such scenes who hated them as much as he did. The
  employés began to swarm out of the surrounding buildings, men, women, and
  girls; they had all been allowed time off with pay, so there was a guaranteed
  audience. Elliott climbed up and gave them that good-tempered smile without
  which his entire career would probably have been undistinguished. Some of the
  girls began to cheer noisily and shout &ldquo;Good old Harry.&rdquo; He gave
  them an especial smile.</p>

  <p>Turnpenny introduced him in a fulsome speech that jarred as many another
  speech had jarred during Elliott&rsquo;s quarter-century of political life,
  but he had cultivated as tough a hide for compliments as for abuse, and
  neither could get him rattled. Most of the time he let his thoughts wander,
  while he distantly contemplated what he was going to say. He never prepared
  much beforehand, except on very important occasions in the House. He had the
  gift of smooth, extempore speech on any subject; the words came easily, yet
  not prosily. Turnpenny, on the other hand, was thumping his fists like a
  stage orator, and nothing, perhaps, but his position as managing director of
  the firm prevented the crowd from openly jeering. Elliott almost wished they
  would. He felt in a curiously wilful mood&mdash;­as if he wanted to do
  something unusual, a little shocking. Turnpenny&rsquo;s emphatic assurances
  that a vote for Elliott was a vote for the abolition of unemployment, cheaper
  food, higher wages, British world-supremacy, and various other items, made
  him feel wistfully sympathetic with the half-listening crowd. He looked at
  their faces and tried to catch the glance he wanted to see&mdash;­that of
  alertness, independence, the sublime you-be-damnedness of free-souled men.
  Instead, he saw cynicism here and there, vapid approval in a few places, but
  for the most part only apathy and weariness. They too, perhaps, knew what a
  game it all was. Then suddenly the vagrant idea came to him&mdash;­suppose he
  were to give them, instead of the usual meaningless stuff, the simple truth,
  so far as he knew it? Suppose he were to begin: &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen,
  I&rsquo;m afraid I haven&rsquo;t very much good news for you, and I
  can&rsquo;t make you any exciting promises. Frankly, I&rsquo;m a little
  pessimistic about things in general. The world&rsquo;s in a pretty bad way,
  and perhaps it isn&rsquo;t quite so much a matter of supremacy as of
  survival. One man can do little in the face of events, but of course I shall
  try, as I&rsquo;ve tried all along. Owing to the rather absurd machinery of
  the English electoral system I have to ask you for your votes; and I must
  confess I don&rsquo;t know why on earth you should give them to
  me&mdash;­certainly not, I should hope, because I&rsquo;m a Northsex man. Of
  course, if you agree with my policy, that&rsquo;s a reason; but then my
  opponent&rsquo;s policy isn&rsquo;t so bad, either, and I&rsquo;m sure his
  intentions are just as honest as mine. And then I&rsquo;m afraid in a lot of
  ways you don&rsquo;t know my policy, and wouldn&rsquo;t understand it if I
  told you&mdash;­all this business about foreign affairs and the gold standard
  and so on. Also, there&rsquo;s the disquieting possibility that my policy may
  be wrong after all. Frankly, I can&rsquo;t think why you should give me such
  a big blank cheque, except that somebody has to have one, and if it
  weren&rsquo;t me, it might be someone even less reliable. But remember, I
  can&rsquo;t honestly promise anything. I can&rsquo;t even promise not to make
  awful mistakes. Some little thing I do, with the best will in the world, may
  start a war long after I&rsquo;m dead&mdash;­a war that may perhaps claim the
  lives of your children. Remember that, when you&rsquo;re shouting &lsquo;Good
  old Harry.&rsquo; And remember, too, that I shan&rsquo;t have much time to be
  bothered about you once you&rsquo;ve elected me....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>What a sensation, he thought, impishly, if he were to address them like
  that? He could imagine Turnpenny&rsquo;s horror, the gasps of a million
  newspaper-readers the next morning, the outraged eyes of the Prime Minister
  when he heard about it.... It would doubtless be the end of him, politically.
  Well, well, he wasn&rsquo;t exactly anxious for that. He smiled to himself
  and wondered what had come over him that he should even think such things.
  Perhaps it was a sixtieth birthday feeling.</p>

  <p>Of course, when the time came, he made a vastly different speech. He did
  not hold out too many promises, but he sounded a note of cautious optimism,
  and remembered to bring in Collins, the Sibleys footballer. He sensed
  familiarly the crowd&rsquo;s change of mood from sulky hostility to tolerant
  good-humour. Most of them would go away and say he seemed &ldquo;a good
  sort.&rdquo; Probably no one would support him who had already decided not
  to, but he might secure a few dozen votes that would otherwise not have been
  given at all.</p>

  <p>During the latter half of his speech a clerk from the offices approached
  the platform and whispered something to Jevons, who immediately climbed down
  and disappeared with him. A few moments later Jevons returned, touched
  Elliott on the elbow, and passed him a slip of paper. Elliott stared at it,
  automatically continuing a sentence meanwhile. In Jevons&rsquo;s neat
  scribble he read: &ldquo;Important message from London. Should end up soon if
  I were you.&rdquo; With the very slightest inclination of the head, Elliott
  handed back the slip. He went on talking for three or four minutes, finishing
  with a brisk peroration that earned the first gust of enthusiasm that had yet
  been born upon that dreary scene. It was typical of him that even an acute
  observer or listener could hardly have suspected any curtailment, so smoothly
  did the words and sentences succeed each other. During the quite lively
  cheering that followed, Jevons leaned across anxiously and whispered in his
  ear: &ldquo;Trunk call from the F.O., passed on through Chilver. Rather bad
  news about the Conference. Tribourov&rsquo;s been shot and everything&rsquo;s
  in a hell of an upset ... yes, SHOT. The P.M. wants you in town at
  once.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; exclaimed Elliott, under his breath, and went a
  little pale.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I took the liberty, sir, of ringing up the aerodrome
  people.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Quite right... quite right. We&rsquo;ll get away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He signalled to Turnpenny and murmured a few words that set the latter on
  his feet to announce pompously that their future member had to dash away on
  important business, but that before he left they would all wish to give him
  three rousing cheers, <i>etc</i>., <i>etc</i>.</p>

  <p>Five minutes later, as the big car slewed through the factory gates,
  Elliott said: &ldquo;Now you can tell me all about it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not much to tell as yet, sir. It&rsquo;s only just
  come through&mdash;­just the bare message without details. It seems he was
  fired at during the Conference session this morning. A woman did it, and shot
  herself immediately afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, but Tribourov&mdash;­is he dead?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t killed outright. Neither of them were. That&rsquo;s
  all the information there is, so far.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who &rsquo;phoned you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tommy Luttrell. He seemed to think it might have serious
  repercussions.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Elliott nodded. &ldquo;Yes, of course, there are all sorts of things it
  might lead to.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then for a long time he was silent. Through the car-windows now the words
  &ldquo;Vote for Elliott&rdquo; on hoardings conveyed a touch of mockery in
  their insistence. Soon, however, he had passed the limits of his constituency
  and was in Loamington. How innocent everyone looked to him&mdash;­the
  policeman on point-duty, the streams of hurrying passers-by, the
  tram-conductor exchanging badinage with a lorry-driver&mdash;­innocent as had
  been the crowds in London and Berlin on that morning of Sarajevo. And he,
  threading through their midst, was their appointed leader. At that moment he
  felt more like a blind engine-driver in charge of a train for whose journey
  the points had been set by lunatic signalmen.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I ever met him,&rdquo; he said at length.
  &ldquo;He must be one of their new men&mdash;­capable, I should say, from his
  speeches. Poor chap.... You know, Jevons, it makes one realise what a chancy
  thing history is. A mere quarter-inch in the track of a maniac&rsquo;s bullet
  can alter everything.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;­and also when the pistol refuses to work, like
  Clive&rsquo;s. I often wonder exactly how different things would be to-day if
  he HAD done himself in. No Ind. Imp. And no Amritsar. Perhaps even no
  Gandhi.... Though I suppose the really big things in history would mostly
  have happened anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Would they? Or does blind chance play a bigger part in affairs than
  we can easily reckon?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Still, sir, even if Columbus HADN&rsquo;T discovered America,
  somebody else would certainly have committed the indiscretion sooner or
  later. That&rsquo;s what I mean. And the war with Germany&mdash;­I should say
  that was fairly inevitable, too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Elliott paused to light a cigar. &ldquo;I might grant you your first
  example, but definitely not your second. We were just as near war with France
  over Fashoda or with Turkey over Chanak as we were with Germany at the end of
  July &rsquo;fourteen. A few hair&rsquo;s breadths might have steered us clear
  of that as they did of the other two.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you think it had to happen some day?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t see why. Frankly, I&rsquo;m chary of believing in
  these big inevitabilities, except in the sense that if you play cards often
  enough, it&rsquo;s inevitable that you&rsquo;ll some time get a hand with
  four aces in it. Looking on history as a mathematician rather than as a
  historian, it seems to me that the most trivial things have led up to the
  most colossal... for instance, just to take one example out of many, I could
  easily demonstrate that the War was really won on the 10th of August, 1911,
  by the Archbishop of Canterbury.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy it,&rdquo; answered Jevons, laughing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I remember that day as one of record heat for this
  country&mdash;­ninety-seven in the shade, or something like that. The House
  of Lords were taking the vote on the Parliament Bill, and the Archbishop,
  whose attitude till then had been doubtful, decided to vote in favour, and
  took eleven bishops with him. As the FOR majority was only seventeen, he may
  be said to have turned the scale. Well, now, consider&mdash;­merely as an
  essay in the pluperfect subjunctive&mdash;­ what would have happened had he
  voted AGAINST. The Bill would have been thrown out. We know now that in such
  an event the King would have created four hundred new peers&mdash;­all
  Liberals, of course. And a Liberal House of Lords would certainly have passed
  the Irish Home Rule Bill without delay. Which, in turn, might very well have
  led to the coercion of Ulster and such disaffection in the army that we could
  not have entered the War against Germany as promptly as we did, even if at
  all. And if the British Expeditionary Force had not been in France just when
  and where it was would the miracle of the Marne have taken place? And if
  Germany had won that battle, isn&rsquo;t it arguable that she would have
  taken Paris and been able to dictate a victorious peace?... So, you see, in
  this particular sense, an Archbishop voting on a hot day in the English House
  of Lords held in his hands the future destiny of the world.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ingenious, sir. Yet you could hardly say he caused the defeat of
  Germany.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh no, that would be an obvious misinterpretation. We really want a
  word for something that leads quite logically to something else, yet in a way
  that both moralists and historians decide to ignore. Of course, the example I
  gave you seems remarkable, because we can trace it and see it, but there must
  be millions of similar threads which we can&rsquo;t trace at all, even though
  our entire lives are woven out of them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jevons laughed again. &ldquo;All of which seems to show that History, as
  Henry Ford said, is bunk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t go as far as that, but I&rsquo;d perhaps agree
  that history professors should take a short course in the mathematics of
  chance and probability.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Or would it be less bother, sir, to teach history to insurance
  actuaries? Still, it&rsquo;s an impressive idea, though I&rsquo;m not quite
  certain where it leads to, unless straight back to Calvinism and
  predestination.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, good heavens, no&mdash;­not by any means! If only Calvin had
  been a bridge-player he&rsquo;d have known better, because life is as much
  like a card-game as anything else&mdash;­if you can imagine a game in which
  the cards are unlimited and the players can&rsquo;t agree on having any
  rules.... But you&rsquo;re encouraging me to be platitudinous, Jevons. Did
  the aerodrome people say they could have a machine ready?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. And it&rsquo;s fine weather down south, they told me, so we
  ought to have a quick and pleasant journey.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Shortly after noon they pulled up on the concrete arena in front of the
  hangars. An R.A.F. machine stood near by, slowly ticking over. Elliott
  chatted to the pilot while the latter helped him on with his flying kit. He
  knew Captain Hartill well, having been piloted by him many times before, and
  he climbed with Jevons into the small cabin with some eagerness for the
  familiar sensations. He liked flying, and liked also the type of man that the
  new profession was breeding. If he had been younger he would certainly have
  learned to fly himself. One reason he favoured air-travel was because it
  seemed a return to smallness and individuality after a century&rsquo;s trend
  towards bigger and bigger units; compared with the train and the ocean liner,
  it suggested independence, the sturdy freedom of solitary man. In that sense
  he had accepted Lindbergh&rsquo;s as a more epic achievement than
  Columbus&rsquo;s, though it had also occurred to him that this very
  independence might some day make for the breakdown of society. It did not
  require a great deal of imagination to picture a world in which power had
  passed into the hands of Al Capones with their private bombing squadrons. An
  appalling possibility, but it undoubtedly existed. To Elliott, as he watched
  the fields diminishing till his view was like that of a fly on a ceiling
  looking down on a patchwork quilt, it did seem that everywhere the forces of
  lawlessness and disintegration were gaining ground; but that in England,
  though a strong attack was in progress, the social fabric was holding out
  with a toughness that proved its quality. His thoughts ran on, and set him
  wondering whether that toughness lay somehow rooted in the million
  absurdities that belonged, not to a Five Years&rsquo; Plan, but to five
  centuries&rsquo; planlessness. This very by-election, for instance, forced on
  him by technicalities over which even he, a lawyer, had unwittingly stumbled;
  and the vast paradox of an empire, in population chiefly non-white and
  non-Christian, governed by a minority whose peculiar gift to the world had
  been the principles of democracy. No Home Rule for India, yet an Indian might
  sit in the English Parliament for a constituency within a tram-ride of the
  House itself! But England was like that, and like so many other things as
  well; just when, in mind, one had fixed her with what seemed an adequate
  generalisation, she suddenly sprang some terrific freakishness that shook any
  logical scheme to bits. And throughout history this same freakishness had
  abounded, from the time she had allowed a king&rsquo;s debaucheries to decide
  her religion, to the fourth decade of the twentieth century, when her people
  could still wonder whether an Act of 1781 ought to prevent them from seeing a
  cinema-show on Sunday.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, rising above the thin vapours, the plane plunged into sunlight
  as into a warm, golden bath. Elliott, in the midst of a sandwich-lunch,
  smiled exultantly at Jevons; the roar of the engines was too loud for
  conversation. He felt lifted, at that moment, to an extraordinary pitch of
  serenity; flying always made him feel like that, as if, in leaving the
  physical world, he had literally left its troubles behind. Tribourov, the
  Conference, the by- election&mdash;­how easily, if spuriously, one could
  purchase the sensation of escape from it all!</p>

  <p>The flight had lasted over an hour when he noticed an occasional
  spluttering amidst the steady thrum-thrum of the engines. Once Hartill stared
  round and gave a jerky shrug of the shoulders that might have meant anything.
  Elliott was not alarmed, but he was surprised when he realised from the
  return to mistiness that the plane must be losing height. The spluttering
  continued, and soon, as through a window abruptly uncurtained, he saw land
  below&mdash;­that same patchwork of greens and browns, with the shadow of the
  plane crawling across them like some strange insect. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
  descending,&rdquo; he shouted in Jevon&rsquo;s ear, and Jevon shouted back:
  &ldquo;Yes, I think something&rsquo;s gone wrong with one of the
  engines.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; thought Elliott, munching his last
  sandwich, &ldquo;if we&rsquo;re killed, we&rsquo;re killed&mdash;­it&rsquo;s
  as good a way as Tribourov&rsquo;s, anyhow.&rdquo; He felt beatifically calm.
  The machine continued to swoop, till the landscape was almost scampering
  underneath&mdash;­fortunately it was open country&mdash;­fields, hedges, a
  few trees, a lane, more fields and hedges&mdash;­all swimming in misty
  sunlight. &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s trying to land,&rdquo; Jevons shouted;
  and Elliott nodded, still without much feeling of concern. It occurred to
  him, with a flash of perception, that he was at that moment trusting Hartill
  just as all over the country millions of people, Hartill included, were
  having to trust HIM. He thought: &ldquo;Yes, &lsquo;Vote for
  Elliott&rsquo;s&rsquo; all right, but just now Hartill&rsquo;s my
  man&mdash;­good old Hartill. Vote for Hartill....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A few seconds later the pilot made a perfect landing in a field of barley.
  After he had shut off the engines and clambered out, he helped his two
  passenger to alight also. He apologised profusely for having had to come
  down, and gave some technical reason which Elliott did not understand.
  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing serious, but I couldn&rsquo;t carry on without
  making the repair. I hope you weren&rsquo;t alarmed, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; Elliott replied, smiling. &ldquo;I think I ought
  to congratulate you on such a fine impromptu landing.&rdquo; Then he looked
  about him. He could see nothing but a field, hedges, and that milk-blue sky.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only slightly worried about the delay. Do you think it would
  be quicker for me to hire a car and get to the nearest big railway
  station?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hartill considered. &ldquo;On the whole, sir, I think if I were you
  I&rsquo;d take a chance of finishing the trip this way. If the trouble is
  only what I think it is, I ought to be able to put it right quite
  soon&mdash;­especially if Mr. Jevons can give me a hand. And this is a good
  place for taking off.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ll help,&rdquo; said Jevons. &ldquo;But where are
  we, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hartill shook his head. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t say, exactly. I&rsquo;ve
  been flying mostly by the compass, and in this misty kind of weather
  it&rsquo;s difficult to get one&rsquo;s bearings. I should say somewhere
  about the middle of England.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Elliott said he would wait. He took off his flying-kit, lit a cigar, and
  watched the preliminary activities of the others. After the roar of the
  engines his ears were conscious of a peculiar, deep silence, a silence that
  seemed alive in the earth. He walked round the machine in a wide circle,
  scanning the horizon not very intently and filling the still air with the
  aroma of his smoke. Probably, he reflected, someone had seen the descent, and
  a farmer or farm-servant would be along soon. He would have to pay something
  for the damage to the crops.... A rabbit loped across the corner of the
  field, and he felt glad that he had decided not to look for a railway
  station&mdash;­much pleasanter to stay where he was and take the chance, as
  Hartill had advised. The chance, yes&mdash;­it was chance again. What
  incalculable millions in odds, for instance, had lain against his ever seeing
  this field and that rabbit. He went to the hedge and looked over, but the
  view was only of another field and another hedge. He walked along by the side
  of the barley till he came to a gate that had a smooth and gnarled top-bar,
  as if it had served for decades of anonymous musings. He climbed up and
  joined the invisible company, smoking in deep contentment. The silence and
  sunshine and scents had all the vivid rapture of a dream-memory of boyhood,
  so that when he asked the question &ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; an answer seemed
  necessary in time as well as space. But where, after all, WAS he? Hartill had
  said &ldquo;Somewhere about the middle of England,&rdquo; but that scarcely
  conveyed very much. He called out across the field: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
  for a stroll to see if I can find out where we are,&rdquo; and Jevons looked
  up and shouted back: &ldquo;All right, but don&rsquo;t be too
  long&mdash;­Hartill says we&rsquo;ll be ready in half an hour.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Waving cheerfully to them both, Elliott clambered over into the next
  field, walked across it, and then another field, till he came to a copse of
  beech-trees bordering a lane. He wondered which way led to the nearest house.
  It was a narrow lane, with cart-ruts marked here and there by motor-tyres,
  and in both directions it curved to give no horizon but of hedges. But the
  hedges were full of pink may-blossom, and Elliott thought it one of the
  loveliest views he had ever seen. He turned to the right, half-facing the
  sun, and began to walk on; after a few hundred yards the lane twisted again,
  and he saw a signpost ahead. Ah, he thought, that would tell him everything;
  and besides, someone would certainly pass by if he waited a few moments at a
  cross-roads. He quickened his steps and soon perceived that it was a very old
  sign-post, tipsily aslant, and with lettering so weather-worn that no passing
  motorist could possibly have read it. Nor did it mark a cross-roads, but only
  a junction of another lane that looked neither more nor less important. And
  one of its arms had fallen off, while the remaining two pointed so vaguely
  that their intentions were far from clear. Elliott could just decipher, on
  one arm, &ldquo;To Upeasy 1/2 m.,&rdquo; and on the other, &ldquo;To
  Beachings Over 2 m.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Of course he had never heard of either place. He could not even guess at
  their county. But if Upeasy were only half a mile away, he wondered if he
  might have time to walk there, make enquiries, and return. He stood on tiptoe
  and looked over the hedge. A little way off he saw a round green rise, hardly
  to be called a hill, with a tiny spire pricking gently into the blue. Upeasy,
  that must be. It looked a long half-mile, even if the lane were not as
  meandering as it promised to be; so perhaps he had better not set out to walk
  there, after all.</p>

  <p>A little girl with very bright golden hair came into view and gazed at him
  timidly as she approached. He smiled and asked her several questions about
  the locality, hoping to elicit the name of some neighbouring place that might
  be known to him; but she was shy, or perhaps too young to understand; and all
  he could obtain were repeated mentions of Upeasy, whither it appeared she was
  on her way to school. Then he reflected that it would be quite simple to look
  the matter up in some book of reference when he reached London, so he need
  not bother any more. He smiled at the child again and gave her sixpence,
  which she accepted very doubtfully, and then held tightly in her hand as she
  scampered off along the lane. When she was nearly out of sight behind the
  curve of the hedge she looked back, and Elliott waved his hand, but she took
  no notice.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, alone again, he was stirred by echoes of the words he had read
  out at breakfast that morning, and as he glanced again at the names on the
  signpost, he felt that all the glory of England lay in them, far more than in
  palm and pine and the rest of the showy Kiplingerie of empire. And if, he
  thought, England should some day perish, other countries might grow to be
  stronger, wiser, or richer, but none would ever have the absurd and exquisite
  tenderness of English villages, linked by the hedge-bordered lanes.</p>

  <p>He looked at his watch&mdash;­five to two. Perhaps he ought to be
  strolling back. He put out his hand and touched the old wood of the signpost
  as if to receive some mystic blessing in farewell; and the whimsical
  remembrance came to him that his political opponents had sometimes called him
  &ldquo;a little Englander.&rdquo; What a phrase&mdash;­and how like England
  to use her own name thus derisively! He spoke the words softly to himself as
  he walked back along the lane&mdash;­little England&mdash;­LITTLE England....
  Then, in a mood of strange enchantment, he vowed that he would never probe
  the secret; the atlas should keep its trivial knowledge, while he himself
  clung to Upeasy and Beachings Over as symbols of things not to be expressed
  in any other words.</p>

  <p>When he reached the field Jevons had been looking for him. &ldquo;Oh,
  there you are, sir. We wondered if you&rsquo;d got lost. Everything&rsquo;s
  all right now. Did you find out where we are?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Elliott. &ldquo;I still haven&rsquo;t the
  slightest idea.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t seen a soul either. Dead-and-alive sort of place,
  wherever it is.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s quiet enough,&rdquo; Elliott said, happily
  regarbing himself for the journey.</p>

  <p>Just over an hour later, after a fast flight, the plane landed at Hendon.
  He motored with Jevons to the Foreign Office immediately, buying on the way
  the afternoon papers that were just on sale. They gave no news except what he
  already knew, though they spun it out with an account of Tribourov&rsquo;s
  career and of similar outrages in the past.</p>

  <p>Tommy Luttrell, one of the parliamentary undersecretaries, was waiting for
  him in his private room. &ldquo;Glad you could manage it, Elliott&mdash;­the
  Chief thought you ought to be on the spot. Rotten thing to have happened just
  when the Conference looked like doing something.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s often the way,&rdquo; said Elliott calmly. &ldquo;Any
  more news?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The woman&rsquo;s dead, but there&rsquo;s no further information
  about Tribourov. The Russians are threatening to leave the
  Conference.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, one rather expected that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Luttrell nodded. &ldquo;Little as I like them, I&rsquo;m bound to admit
  they have a case. It seems the dead woman was a Russian emigrée&mdash;­
  belonged to an aristocratic family in Tsarist days&mdash;­and she&rsquo;d got
  herself into a job of chambermaid at the very hotel where Tribourov was
  staying. Pretty slack on the part of the authorities, you know. You&rsquo;d
  have thought they&rsquo;d have taken a few obvious precautions, especially as
  they knew that threats had already been made against the fellow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But she didn&rsquo;t shoot him in the hotel, did she?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. Might have done, I suppose, but probably she wanted
  publicity&mdash;­that kind of maniac is like that. It was in the corridors of
  the Conference building, with scores of people looking on. Incidentally, she
  was a French subject by marriage, which might have complicated matters if she
  hadn&rsquo;t had the tactfulness to die. There ought to be a message from
  Walton soon about Tribourov&mdash;­I should guess they&rsquo;re probably
  waiting for some report from the hospital&mdash;­maybe after an
  operation.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a damnable sort of business, Luttrell.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Luttrell answered, as befitted a younger man, in the younger idiom.
  &ldquo;Yes, perfectly bloody. Did you know him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not personally.... Of course, if the Russians do leave, everything
  goes to pot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, looks like it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d better see Lindley. Where is he?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Over the road, waiting for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Right, I&rsquo;ll go along. You might stay here, Jevons, and
  telephone Barrowby I shan&rsquo;t be able to get to the dinner to-night.
  Smooth him down if you can&mdash;­he&rsquo;ll be pretty sick about it. Tell
  the broadcasting people too, and then wire Kennersley that I can&rsquo;t be
  back at Chilver for a few days. He&rsquo;ll probably guess what&rsquo;s
  happened.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very good, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>An hour later Elliott left the house in Downing Street. He would have
  liked a walk in the Park, but at that time of day there would be too many
  there who recognised him, and he didn&rsquo;t care for ostentatious shadowing
  by detectives. He hailed a taxi and asked to be driven slowly round Hyde
  Park, by the inner road; he wanted an hour or so alone to think over what the
  P. M. had said. It had been disquieting, though not absolutely unexpected, to
  learn of important forces in England opposed to the Conference, and ready to
  welcome the Russian withdrawal, if it took place, as an excuse for British
  withdrawal too. Lindley had mentioned the names of certain newspapers and big
  industrialists. The position was complicated by the fact that at the moment
  Elliott was technically a nobody; until East Northsex actually made him its
  member he could neither speak in the House nor take part officially in
  Cabinet councils. For six more days he would be thus muzzled, and during such
  an interval much&mdash;­too much&mdash;­might happen.</p>

  <p>Anyone who chanced to look into the cab as it skimmed past the crowds on
  the sidewalks, would have seen an old man, white-haired and hatless, leaning
  in a corner with his chin resting in the palm of one hand. A thoughtful,
  perhaps slightly troubled attitude, and one that emphasised the years.
  Sixty&mdash;­spent in a struggle that was not yet over.... At fifteen, after
  a grammar-school education, he had begun in the office of the Creeksend
  Colliery; at twenty-five, Oxford, attained by means of mathematical
  scholarships; at thirty, admittance to the Bar; from thirty to forty,
  lawyering and political work; M.P., after five unsuccessful tries, at a
  by-election in 1912; the War; the peace; but the struggle continued. There
  had been nothing absolutely sensational in such a career&mdash;­no Limehouse
  or Sidney Street to tie a label on it. He doubted whether he could feel sure
  of being mentioned in any history exam-paper of the year 2032. He was not
  particularly modest, but he was far too self-critical to be conceited. On the
  whole, he did not think his life could be counted a failure; he was certainly
  not a Lloyd George or a Disraeli, but he was perhaps near the front of the
  second rank. He had worked hard and had usually managed to do the jobs he had
  tackled. He had kept himself free in thought, cautious in speech, and
  practical in action. He had altered his opinions, not once, but constantly;
  he had changed parties; he had been illogical and inconsistent, and had grown
  used to being called, from right and left respectively, a woolly-headed
  visionary and a hard-boiled legalist. Sincerely hating war, he got on rather
  better with soldiers and sailors than, as a rule, with professional
  pacifists; privately something of a sceptic, he nevertheless disliked
  blasphemy and would always defend religion. In these and other ways he had
  for three decades offered discrepancies of belief and behaviour which hostile
  critics could and did denounce as hypocrisy, but which he himself knew to be
  nothing of the sort. The fact was (as he often joked) he was English, and
  therefore handicapped by race for the task of governing England&mdash;­a
  remark which he would amplify by claiming to be the only member of the
  Cabinet who wasn&rsquo;t wholly or partly Scottish, Irish, Welsh, or Jew.</p>

  <p>But this Conference fretted him a little. It was, in a sense, the fruition
  of the policy of reasonableness which he had always championed; it was an
  attempt to find a common denominator in European politics that would attract,
  not the visionary and the diehard, who must be left to cancel each other out,
  but the vast body of experienced practical opinion in every country. And to
  see it all jeopardised, at the last moment, by a bullet! He wished he had
  gone out to the Conference himself, instead of Walton; Walton was a good
  fellow, but not perhaps over-supple in an emergency. After a third circuit of
  the Park he gave the driver the name of his club in Pall Mall, and on arrival
  rang up the Office and spoke to Jevons. But there had been no more news.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dining here and will look in later on,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>Petrie, who had the Colonies, was at the next table, and asked him how the
  by-election was going. Then they discussed the Tribourov affair and politics
  generally. Petrie said that any revolutionary government that had used the
  weapon of assassination before its rise to power must expect the same weapon
  to be turned against it afterwards; and Elliott agreed, but added that he
  thought assassination all the more terrible because it was really so logical.
  &ldquo;If you believe quite passionately that a certain person is a social
  menace, what more meritorious than to risk your life in ridding the world of
  him? Perhaps the chief reason why we in England aren&rsquo;t much given to
  that sort of thing is that we don&rsquo;t believe passionately enough. After
  nearly a thousand years of nationhood, we&rsquo;re sure enough of ourselves
  to admit our own private doubts.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I think that&rsquo;s rather true. Which reminds me, Elliott,
  talking of passion and the lack of it, I had a visit from that fellow
  Gathergood the other day. You remember the case?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;GATHERGOOD? I do seem to have heard of the name,
  but&mdash;­&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He was the Agent at Cuava and mishandled some native trouble that
  cropped up. The Court of Enquiry sat on him pretty heavily.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, that was it. And as a result of the Enquiry, we&rsquo;ve
  more or less annexed Cuava, haven&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Annexed&rsquo; is a pre-War word, Elliott. Say rather
  we&rsquo;ve accepted a mandate to look after the place, though it
  isn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m afraid, going to be the brightest jewel in the British
  Crown; on the contrary, there&rsquo;s already a deficit of a hundred thousand
  or so in the local budget. We&rsquo;re building roads and bridges as if the
  Pax Britannica were going to last for ever, and the natives are taking all we
  give them and hating us for it. Lord knows why we do these things... but I
  was mentioning this chap Gathergood. A queer fellow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It seemed to me at the time, I remember, that he&rsquo;d been
  unfortunate rather than blameworthy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more or less what he told me himself. Very chilly,
  strong-jawed type&mdash;­absolutely without emotion&mdash;­a. Frenchman or an
  Italian or a Russian would probably have been in tears or shaking their fists
  over the business.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I should have guessed him to be cool-headed. What did you do
  for him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What could I? Nothing fails like failure, and there are still a few
  messrooms where, if you say &lsquo;Gathergood,&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll get an
  immediate explosion. Even a first-rate civil service has to have its
  occasional scapegoats&mdash;­Pontius Pilate, for instance.... D&rsquo;you
  feel equal to a liqueur brandy upstairs, by the way?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks, I don&rsquo;t mind. But I must look in at the Office again
  soon. Perhaps Walton will have &rsquo;phoned through.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your opinion of Walton? Do you think it was a wise
  choice to send him out?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a sound fellow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you think a somewhat younger man&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then, for the first time, Elliott&rsquo;s voice was raised a tone.
  &ldquo;Good God, Petrie, he&rsquo;s only sixty-four&mdash;­a man&rsquo;s not
  on the shelf at that age. Why, I&rsquo;m sixty myself&mdash;­sixty to-
  day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Petrie laughed. &ldquo;Congratulations. I&rsquo;m glad you mentioned
  it.&rdquo; Then, summoning the waiter, he added: &ldquo;Wash out that order I
  gave, and bring Napoleon brandy&mdash;­in the big glasses.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Extravagance!&rdquo; said Elliott, smiling.</p>

  <p>Towards ten o&rsquo;clock he walked across Horse Guard&rsquo;s Parade.
  There was a full moon, and all was very still and peaceful; the traffic along
  the Mall was only a glittering, murmuring horizon. He noticed a young man
  embracing a girl in the shadow between two lamp-posts, and for a moment he
  envied them their ecstasy, but more so their ease of mind and unconsciousness
  of time. He knew, from such envy, that he was doing what he rarely did: he
  was worrying. This Conference business ... if it all broke down, nothing very
  dreadful was to be expected immediately, or even soon; but years hence,
  probably long after he was put to earth, something MIGHT happen... or
  mightn&rsquo;t. Then why bother? One made all these efforts, one ached over
  these hopes and anxieties, and all the time one grew older&mdash;­forty,
  fifty, sixty&mdash;­while the world went on with an apparent heedlessness of
  whether one cared about it or not. Life was too short for an ordinary man of
  affairs (which was all he reckoned himself) to touch the wheel of destiny
  with more than a finger-tip; while even a Napoleon or a Mussolini could get
  no more than half a hand-grip&mdash;­for half a second.</p>

  <p>Just as he climbed the steps to enter the Office Jevons ran down almost
  into his arms. &ldquo;Hullo, sir, I &rsquo;phoned the club and they told me
  you were walking over. I was coming to meet you. There&rsquo;s just been a
  message from Walton....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; said Elliott, leading him towards the silver
  emptiness of the Parade.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good news, sir. Tribourov&rsquo;s only slightly
  hurt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh.... Oh.... Thank God....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And apparently he&rsquo;s using his influence to calm things down.
  Walton&rsquo;s seen him. Walton thinks the situation will be smoothed
  over.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And so on... Elliott was suddenly, in the midst of his relief, aware that
  the day had been strenuous, and that he was rather tired. Jevons continued to
  talk, but Elliott was only half-listening; he would have to get him to go
  over everything again later on&mdash;­perhaps in the morning. But he felt,
  beyond his relief and his tiredness, something more fugitive&mdash;­a certain
  communion of spirit with a man hundreds of miles away whom he had never seen,
  and whose language he could not speak&mdash;­something that made him exclaim,
  as he took Devon&rsquo;s arm: &ldquo;Tribourov sounds a good
  fellow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s certainly not monkeying, anyway, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps I shall meet him some day. I hope so. I can&rsquo;t tell
  how you relieved I feel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know. I could see you were bothered. But you always take things
  pretty calmly&mdash;­more than I often can. I had a terrific wind-up this
  afternoon, for instance, when that plane began to come down.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was picturing both our obituaries in the papers&mdash;­two
  columns for you and an inch paragraph for me.... I say, that&rsquo;s
  love&rsquo;s young dream, if you like, isn&rsquo;t it&mdash;­just over
  there?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very much so. I noticed them as I came along just now. Charming,
  Jevons&mdash;­quite charming. Laugh if you want, but you&rsquo;ll feel more
  like crying when you&rsquo;re my age.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He had been young with Petrie, but Jevons made him feel grandfatherly.
  They passed into Birdcage Walk and across Victoria Street to Elliott&rsquo;s
  house. All the way Jevons talked, and Elliott was nearly silent; he felt too
  tired to know anything but that his birthday had been, on the whole, a
  success. In his arm-chair over a final cigar, after Jevons had said
  good-night, he reviewed the hours and how variedly they had
  progressed&mdash;­breakfast at Chilver, the meeting at Sibleys, sandwiches in
  mid-air, that winding lane to Upeasy, tea with the P. M., the club dinner,
  and now this last good news... so much could happen in a day, and so little
  in a lifetime. Sixty years of doing and being, of threading blindly into the
  pattern, yet with eyes that never lost their hope of sight. And sometimes, as
  just now, one felt a touch in the darkness beyond the everlasting criss-cross
  of chance&mdash;­a touch that, in an earlier and more faithful age, would
  have sent one to one&rsquo;s knees.</p>

  <p>Elliott did not kneel. But when he went to bed a little later, he fell
  asleep as quickly and as peacefully as a child.</p>
