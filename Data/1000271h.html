  <h2><a id="book1">BOOK ONE</a></h2>

  <h2><a name="ch1"
     id="ch1">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Miss Sadie Loyes, the manageress of the Hotel Weltmore
  Typewriting and Secretarial Bureau, set down the receiver of the telephone
  which had its place upon her desk and studied thoughtfully the eleven young
  ladies who comprised her present staff. She stood there, an angular,
  untidy-looking person, tapping a pencil against her teeth, unconscious
  arbitress, not only of the fate of two very interesting people, but also of
  the fate of a great nation. Portentous events depended upon her decision. A
  man's life in this teeming city of New York was a small enough matter of
  itself. The life of this prospective client of hers, however, waiting now in
  his suite on the eleventh floor for the help which he had summoned, was hung
  about with destiny. Meanwhile, Miss Sadie Loyes continued to tap her teeth
  with the pencil, and reflect. Which should it be? The nearest and apparently
  the most industrious? Her eyes rested disparagingly upon Miss Bella Fox's
  golden-brown coiffure. These were dressy days in New York and style was all
  very well in its way, but there was no mistaking the abbreviations of the
  young lady's costume&mdash;very low from the throat downwards and displaying
  a length of limb in a manner which, although perhaps sanctioned by fashion,
  paid no excessive tribute to modesty. Miss Fox's jewellery, too, was a little
  in evidence, and there were rumours about dinners at the Ritz! On the whole
  perhaps it would be better to keep this particular young lady back for one of
  these western millionaires. Dorothy Dickson might do: a young woman of far
  more modest appearance, but a little careless with her shorthand. Possibly it
  was as well not to risk her on an important assignment. Then there was
  Florence White&mdash;expert enough, but a little mysterious in her private
  life, and the recipient of too many boxes of candy and offerings of roses
  from her clients to inspire her employer with thorough confidence as to her
  commercial ability. Then the pencil stopped. Miss Borans! Nothing whatever
  against her; efficient, self-contained, reserved alike in dress and
  demeanour, but with an air of breeding which none of these others possessed.
  Absolutely an obvious choice!</p>

  <p>"Miss Borans," the manageress called out, in a shrill tone, "just step
  this way, please."</p>

  <p>The young lady addressed rose with composure, pushed her chair back into
  its place, and approached her employer. Space was limited in the Hotel
  Weltmore and the Typewriting and Secretarial Bureau was really a railed-off
  portion of the lounge on the first floor reserved for "Ladies Only."</p>

  <p>"I guess you'd better slip up to number eleven hundred and eighty," Miss
  Loyes directed. "I'll send a machine and the rest of the stuff right
  along&mdash; gentleman there in a hurry&mdash;his secretary caught the fever
  while he was in Washington. Samara, his name is&mdash;the Good Lord knows
  where he got it!"</p>

  <p>The girl seemed to stiffen.</p>

  <p>"Samara, the Russian envoy?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"You've got it, honey. Speaks with an English accent, though, you could
  cut with a knife."</p>

  <p>"I would rather not work for Gabriel Samara," the girl declared.</p>

  <p>It took a great deal to surprise Miss Sadie Loyes, but this newest recruit
  to her secretarial staff had certainly succeeded.</p>

  <p>"How?" she exclaimed. "What's that?"</p>

  <p>Miss Borans had not in the least the appearance of a young woman of
  mercurial or changeable temperament. Nevertheless, she seemed already to be
  repenting her rather rash pronouncement.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon, Miss Loyes," she said. "That was perhaps a foolish
  speech of mine. Number eleven hundred and eighty, you said. I will go there
  at once."</p>

  <p>"Say, do you know anything of this Mr. Samara?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing personally," was the prompt reply.</p>

  <p>"You haven't worked for him before? He hasn't tried to be familiar with
  you or anything of that sort?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not."</p>

  <p>"Then what's the idea, eh?"</p>

  <p>Miss Borans hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I am of Russian descent," she confided. "One has prejudices. It was
  foolish."</p>

  <p>Miss Sadie Loyes had had a great deal of experience of the younger members
  of her sex, and she studied her employee for a minute thoughtfully. Miss
  Catherine Borans conformed to no type with which she was familiar. She was a
  young woman of medium height, slim and with the promise of a perfect body
  beneath the almost Quaker-like simplicity of her gown. She was rather full-
  faced, with a broad forehead, dark silky eyelashes and clear brown eyes. Her
  features were distinguished by reason of their clean-cut clarity, her mouth
  was perfectly shaped although her lips were a little full. Her expression was
  not to be reckoned with, for during the few weeks she had been employed at
  the Bureau she had wrapped herself in a mantle of impenetrable reserve.</p>

  <p>"I guessed you were a foreigner," Miss Sadie Loyes remarked finally.
  "Well, anyways, this Mr. Samara is a great guy over there, isn't he? The New
  York Press, at any rate, seems to be giving him an almighty boom."</p>

  <p>Miss Sadie Loyes had spent a busy life in narrow ways, and leaving out
  England, France and Germany, "over there" represented for her the rest of
  Europe.</p>

  <p>"In his way I have no doubt that he is a great man," Miss Borans
  acknowledged coldly. "I was foolish to have any feeling in the matter."</p>

  <p>She passed on with her notebook in her hand, a noticeable figure in the
  bustling promenades of the hotel, both from the quiet distinction of her
  appearance and her utter indifference to the cosmopolitan throngs through
  which she passed. She took her place in the crowded elevator, ascended to the
  eleventh floor, received a pleasant nod from the young lady seated on guard
  at the corner of the corridor, and touched the bell of number eleven hundred
  and eighty.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Samara's right there now," the latter observed from behind her desk.
  "I guess he's needing help badly, too. They're talking of having to take his
  secretary away to the hospital. Stomach trouble, I guess. These foreigners
  eat different to us."</p>

  <p>The door in front of them was suddenly opened. Miss Borans was confronted
  by a somewhat alarming looking personage; a man of over six feet in height
  and broad in proportion, florid, blue-eyed and of truculent appearance. Not
  even the studious sombreness of his attire could bring him into line with any
  recognised types of domestic servitor. He stared at this visitor without
  speaking.</p>

  <p>"I have come from the Typewriting Bureau downstairs to do some work for
  Mr. Samara," she announced.</p>

  <p>Typists, especially of this order, were unknown quantities in the world
  where Ivan Rortz had spent most of his days, but he stood aside and ushered
  her through the little hall to the sitting-room beyond. It was of the
  ordinary hotel type, but flooded with light, overheated, and, as it seemed to
  her in those first few seconds, almost overcrowded with flowers. Everywhere
  they flaunted their elegance against the uncouth decorations of the room; a
  queer contrast of exotic beauty and pretentious ugliness. A man swung round
  from a writing-desk to look at her&mdash;a man who she knew at once must be
  Samara.</p>

  <p>His study of her was superficial and incurious. She, on the other hand,
  brought all her powers of observation to bear upon the man whom it was her
  daily lesson to learn to hate. The illustrated Press of many countries had
  made his features in a sense familiar&mdash;yet, in a further sense, they had
  never done him justice. She saw a man of well over middle height,
  broad-shouldered yet with a tendency to stoop. His face was as hard as
  granite, cruel, perhaps, and as expressionless as her own, yet redeemed by a
  mouth which had wonderful possibilities of tenderness and humour. His hair
  was black and short, his eyebrows too heavy, his clear grey eyes almost
  unduly penetrating.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he exclaimed curtly.</p>

  <p>"I am from the Typewriting Bureau," she announced once more.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Where is your machine?"</p>

  <p>"On the way up."</p>

  <p>He pointed towards the book she was carrying.</p>

  <p>"You write shorthand?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly."</p>

  <p>"Take down some letters. Sit where you please. I usually walk about. Some
  I will give you direct on to the typewriter, when it arrives."</p>

  <p>She seated herself deliberately at the end of the table, opened her book,
  and glanced at her pencil to be sure that it was sharpened. Then she waited.
  He rose to his feet and stood with his back to her, looking out of the
  window. Presently he swung round, took up a sheaf of letters from the desk,
  and grunted as he inspected them.</p>

  <p>"Rubbishy work," he declared, "but it must be done. Invitations to every
  sort of a function under the sun. One reply will do for the lot&mdash;'Mr.
  Gabriel Samara regrets that he is unable to accept the invitation,' etc.,
  etc.," his thick eyebrows almost meeting in a heavy frown. "Got that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she answered.</p>

  <p>He threw a selection of the letters on the table before her, destroying
  the remainder. Then he made his way back to the desk and loitered there with
  his hands in his pockets.</p>

  <p>"I can't do these until the typewriter arrives," she reminded him.</p>

  <p>"Naturally," he replied drily. "I was wondering about the rest of the
  work. Here is your machine."</p>

  <p>There was a knock at the door and a boy arrived with the typewriter, which
  he set upon the table. Catherine Borans began her task. Presently the
  telephone bell rang. Samara motioned her to answer it.</p>

  <p>"A gentleman from the <i>New York Hemisphere</i> would like to see you,"
  she announced.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You can answer all applications from journalists in the same manner," he
  said. "Just tell them that Mr. Samara has nothing to communicate to the
  Press&mdash; with one exception, mind. A Mr. Bromley Pride will ring up from
  the <i>New York Comet.</i> I will accord him an interview. And, whilst we are
  on this subject, be so good as to inform the young lady outside that I will
  not have people waiting about in the corridor to waylay me when I come out.
  My lips are sealed. I have nothing to say to anyone."</p>

  <p>Miss Borans carried out her instructions faithfully. Then she recommenced
  her task. Suddenly Samara paused in his restless perambulation of the room
  and looked at her intently.</p>

  <p>"Are you to be trusted, young lady?" he inquired brusquely.</p>

  <p>She abandoned her typing for a moment and looked up at him.</p>

  <p>"I should say not," she replied.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch2"
     id="ch2">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Samara was distinctly taken aback. His expression was one of
  incredulous surprise, mingled with some irritation.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"My reply to your question," she explained, "was truthful, though of
  course relative. I should not, as a matter of fact, care to be trusted with
  any of your important political correspondence."</p>

  <p>"And why not?"</p>

  <p>"I prefer not to discuss the matter further."</p>

  <p>He smiled with gentle sarcasm.</p>

  <p>"May I ask if this self-advertised untrustworthiness is universal amongst
  the young ladies of the Bureau from which you come?"</p>

  <p>She considered for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Of course you can send for some one else if you like," she said. "I would
  not trust any one of them with confidential documents, though. Your private
  secretary is the person to deal with them."</p>

  <p>"But my private secretary," he confided, "is ill. They are talking of
  taking him to hospital."</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"That is unfortunate," she admitted. "Still, you have an Embassy in
  Washington and a Russian Consul here. Surely they should be able to help
  you."</p>

  <p>"You are without doubt a young lady of resource," he declared with an
  indulgent smile. "Nevertheless, there are reasons why I do not wish to avail
  myself of the services of anyone having an official connection with my
  country."</p>

  <p>"Then," she advised, "I should write my letters myself."</p>

  <p>He stood looking down at her, his hands in his pockets, his thick eyebrows
  almost meeting in a heavy frown. She felt her heart beating a little more
  quickly. Notwithstanding her even manner and her very equable poise towards
  life, she was conscious of something in this man's presence which was akin to
  fear.</p>

  <p>"Your candour," he said, "inspires me with a certain amount of confidence.
  I hate writing letters. My brain moves so much more quickly than my clumsy
  fingers, that anything which I put on paper is generally illegible. There is
  a boat leaving to-night for Cherbourg where I have a special agent waiting.
  It is necessary that I send an account of my negotiations here. What is to be
  done?"</p>

  <p>"I can only repeat that, if your report has to do with your negotiations
  with the President, I should write it by hand and hope for the best," she
  rejoined coolly.</p>

  <p>His eyes flashed. For a moment he seemed almost to lose control of
  himself.</p>

  <p>"What in the name of all the Holy Saints of Russia do you know about my
  negotiations with the President?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Nothing more than a few other million people of the city," she replied.
  "I am an intelligent student of the daily Press, like most American
  girls."</p>

  <p>He looked at her suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"I am not at all sure that you are an American girl," he growled.</p>

  <p>"I have lived in New York for twenty-three years," she said meekly. "You
  may not think it, but I can assure you that has not left me much time to
  imbibe the instincts of other nationalities."</p>

  <p>He sat at the opposite end of the table, staring at her, his hands still
  in his pockets, his expression curiously dominated by the uncertain curve of
  his lips. For a brief moment she wondered whether he were not laughing at
  her.</p>

  <p>"Are all the young ladies of the Weltmore Typewriting Bureau gifted with
  such glib tongues?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"By no means," she assured him. "Believe me, I am quite an exception. I
  think I was sent because I was considered the most serious minded."</p>

  <p>"Heaven help the others!" he muttered. "Now listen. I am going to trust
  you to a certain extent against your own advice. I shall dictate to you all
  except the vital part of my communication. A great deal of what you are going
  to take down I should prefer you to forget. The most private part of all I
  shall write in my own hand, and God grant that some one at the other end will
  be able to read it."</p>

  <p>Catherine Borans thrust a new sheet of paper into the typewriter and bent
  over her task. For half-an-hour or more the man opposite to her dictated.
  Then he took the sheets which she had typed over to his desk and drew pen and
  ink towards him.</p>

  <p>"You can go on with the other work," he enjoined, commencing to write.</p>

  <p>The scratching of his pen ceased almost as she addressed the last of her
  envelopes. He turned in his chair just as she had risen to her feet.</p>

  <p>"Don't go yet," he begged, throwing another pile of letters upon the
  table. "There are all these to be attended to and it is necessary for some
  one to be here to answer the telephone. Besides, I have a question to ask
  you."</p>

  <p>"A question?" she repeated doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I am a stranger in your country and I hope that you will gratify my
  curiosity. If I had dictated the vital part of this letter to you, wherein
  lay the fear of your probity? Do you mean that you would have sold its
  contents to the Press?"</p>

  <p>"That would have been a temptation," she confessed, carelessly tapping the
  keys of her typewriter. "I am a working girl, you know, and am supposed to be
  well paid at thirty dollars a week. I think that any newspaper in New York
  would probably give ten thousand dollars for a true account of your
  conversation with the President and the arrangement at which you arrived.
  Fancy the clothes I could have bought and the countries I could have visited
  with ten thousand dollars!"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he admitted thoughtfully, "I suppose I was running a certain amount
  of risk. By the by, I presume it would have been the Press with whom you
  would have dealt?"</p>

  <p>"With whom else?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"There are others," he observed, watching her keenly; "politicians, shall
  we call them?&mdash;who would be curious to know the precise conclusions at
  which we arrived in Washington yesterday."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," she assented.</p>

  <p>"Even in Europe," he went on, "this business of secret societies and
  international espionage is a little on the wane. One nation only continues to
  use it as her great weapon. In America I never dreamed of coming across
  anything of the sort. Have I by some chance stumbled upon the unexpected,
  Miss&mdash; I beg your pardon, I have forgotten what you told me your name
  was."</p>

  <p>"I have not told you my name."</p>

  <p>"Please repair the omission."</p>

  <p>"I do not see the necessity," she objected. "I am the young lady typist
  from the Hotel Bureau. You have been unfortunate inasmuch as I am the only
  one in the office likely to be interested in your mission and its results.
  To- morrow you had better ask for some one else. There are two or three
  there, perhaps not more trustworthy than I, but who will take down anything
  you dictate without a glimmer of comprehension. I should recommend Miss Bella
  Fox."</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The name is sufficient," he declared. "I should dislike Miss Bella Fox
  and I could not dictate to her. I shall ask for you. Tell me how to do
  so."</p>

  <p>"My name is Catherine Borans."</p>

  <p>"And if I had dictated to you what I have written with my own hand, what
  would have been the nature of the risk I should have run?"</p>

  <p>"I decline," she said, "to answer your question."</p>

  <p>The telephone at her elbow rang whilst Samara stood scowling down at her.
  She turned and took the call. As she listened she frowned slightly.</p>

  <p>"Tell me your name again, please?" she asked.</p>

  <p>The name was apparently repeated. The girl spoke into the receiver.</p>

  <p>"Please wait," she begged. "I will tell Mr. Samara that you are here."</p>

  <p>She laid down the receiver and pushed the instrument a little away. Then
  she turned towards her companion.</p>

  <p>"There is a gentleman downstairs who says that his name is 'Bromley
  Pride,' and that he has called from the <i>New York Comet</i> to see
  you."</p>

  <p>Samara nodded.</p>

  <p>"That is quite in order," he assented. "He can come up. Please tell him
  so."</p>

  <p>She did not at once obey. She was evidently perplexed.</p>

  <p>"Since you are so much interested in my affairs," her companion continued,
  "I will tell you that the President himself, looking upon the paper which I
  understand Mr. Bromley Pride represents, as his official mouthpiece, has
  suggested that I confide to him a certain portion of the result of our
  negotiations."</p>

  <p>"Indeed," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"Recognising to the full," he went on, with a faint note of sarcasm in his
  tone, "and thoroughly appreciating your kindly interest, I would yet point
  out that this is a matter which is already decided. Will you please therefore
  ask Mr. Pride to step up."</p>

  <p>"I would do so," she replied, dropping her voice a little and holding the
  telephone receiver still further away, "but, as a matter of fact, he is not
  there."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I happen to know Mr. Bromley Pride quite well," she explained. "I am also
  very well acquainted with his voice. The man who is impersonating him
  downstairs is a stranger!"</p>

  <h2><a name="ch3"
     id="ch3">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Gabriel Samara seemed for a moment puzzled and unable to
  appreciate the significance of his companion's words.</p>

  <p>"In any case," he rejoined, "beg whoever is down there to come up. Mr.
  Pride has probably sent a substitute."</p>

  <p>Catherine leaned over the instrument with an expressionless face.</p>

  <p>"Is it Mr. Bromley Pride himself speaking?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"You are to come up, then."</p>

  <p>She laid down the receiver without remark.</p>

  <p>"Well?" Samara demanded impatiently.</p>

  <p>"The man who is below insists on it that he is Mr. Bromley Pride," she
  announced.</p>

  <p>"And you still don't believe him?"</p>

  <p>"I know that he is not," she replied. "I have worked for Mr. Bromley
  Pride. We are old acquaintances."</p>

  <p>"Some journalistic dodge, perhaps," he muttered. She began gathering
  together the paraphernalia connected with her machine.</p>

  <p>"It is not my business," she continued quietly, "to offer you advice. I am
  not sure that I am disposed to do so, but as a matter of common sense I must
  say that I wonder at you admitting to your apartments a man who is visiting
  you under a fake name when you have a document, presumably of some interest
  to the world, lying there on your desk."</p>

  <p>Samara looked at her with wide-open eyes.</p>

  <p>"But my dear young lady," he protested, "we are in the very centre of
  civilisation. This is New York."</p>

  <p>"A city of which you are evidently extremely ignorant."</p>

  <p>Her attitude suddenly inspired him with disquietude. He began to
  reflect.</p>

  <p>"There are some people, of course," he muttered, "who would give the price
  of a kingdom to know this before I got home. But
  surely&mdash;here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She interrupted him.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Samara," she said quietly, "I have read several biographies of you.
  In every one of them, the chronicler has observed that, for a diplomatist of
  world-wide fame, you are possessed of a remarkably unsuspicious nature. I
  agree with your chroniclers. Good morning."</p>

  <p>"Stop!" he begged her.</p>

  <p>There was the sound of the bell. It was rung in quite an ordinary manner,
  but to both of them there seemed something sinister in its drawn-out summons.
  She looked at him.</p>

  <p>"Your servant?"</p>

  <p>"He is sitting with my secretary, Andrew Kroupki."</p>

  <p>"I will answer the door," she announced.</p>

  <p>"And remain, if you please," he insisted.</p>

  <p>She turned away, threw open the outside door, and returned a moment later,
  ushering in a visitor. She made no comment as she stood on one side to let
  him pass, but both she and Samara himself studied the new-comer curiously. He
  was a pleasant-looking man, neatly dressed, with an amiable expression, and
  the shoulders of an athlete. He carried a black portfolio under his arm,
  which he set down carefully upon the table, close to the typewriter, before
  proceeding to introduce himself. His voice, when he spoke, was distinctly a
  home product and free from any foreign accent.</p>

  <p>"I am very pleased to meet you, Mr. Samara," he said, as he gripped the
  latter's hand. "This is an honour I appreciate very highly."</p>

  <p>Samara motioned his visitor towards a chair. He was wondering why his
  dislike had been of such quick conception.</p>

  <p>"I must tell you, Mr. Pride," he explained, "that my own desire was to
  have kept absolutely secret the nature of my negotiations with your
  Government until I had had an opportunity of setting them before my advisers
  in Moscow. Your President, however, thought that complete reticence as to my
  mission would be too much to ask of your Press, and that therefore an idea of
  the arrangement concluded had better be given to a representative journal
  such as your own."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," the visitor murmured. "My paper holds almost an official
  position here."</p>

  <p>"May I ask what post you occupy upon it?" Samara inquired.</p>

  <p>"I am a member of the Board of Directors," was the prompt reply. "I am
  also leader-writer on international affairs."</p>

  <p>"And your name is Pride?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;James D. Bromley Pride. You can speak right out to me. No need
  to keep a thing back!"</p>

  <p>A quiet voice from the other end of the room suddenly intervened. The
  words themselves seemed harmless enough, but their effect was
  cataclysmic.</p>

  <p>"There is surely some mistake. Mr. Bromley Pride of the <i>New York
  Comet</i> is in Philadelphia."</p>

  <p>Samara himself was a little taken aback by the unexpected intervention of
  his temporary secretary. The expression on his visitor's face was momentarily
  illuminative.</p>

  <p>"My name is Catherine Borans," was the composed announcement. "I belong to
  the Typewriting Bureau downstairs. I have often worked for Mr. Pride. You are
  not he."</p>

  <p>The pseudo Mr. Pride had regained his presence of mind. He pointed to the
  card which he had laid upon the table.</p>

  <p>"This young woman's interference is impertinent and absurd," he declared.
  "If I am not Bromley Pride of the <i>New York Comet,</i> how is it that I am
  here at all? I received my instructions from the editor himself this
  morning."</p>

  <p>Samara looked across towards Catherine.</p>

  <p>"Telephone the editor of the <i>New York Comet,"</i> he directed. "Ask him
  to send some one round to identify this gentleman. I do not wish to be
  offensive," he went on, turning to his visitor, "but your identity is a
  matter upon which I must be entirely assured."</p>

  <p>The sang-froid of this caller of disputed personality was amazing. Before
  Catherine could take off the receiver he stepped quickly towards the
  telephone and faced them both.</p>

  <p>"The young lady has spoken the truth," he confessed. "I am not Bromley
  Pride. I am, as a matter of fact, the representative of a rival newspaper.
  You do not need to be told, Mr. Samara, that here in New York a live
  journalist will go further than assume another man's name to get hold of a
  big scoop&mdash;and then some! He will risk more even than being thrown down
  eleven flights of stairs! Is there any price you are inclined to name, sir,
  for the particulars which you were about to hand on to the <i>New York
  Comet?"</i></p>

  <p>Samara's eyes flashed and his frown was menacing.</p>

  <p>"An impostor!" he exclaimed. "I request you to withdraw at once from my
  apartment."</p>

  <p>"And I decline," was the prompt reply. "I may tell you right away that I
  am prepared to go to any lengths to secure this information from you."</p>

  <p>"Indeed," Samara scoffed. "May I ask in what direction you propose to make
  your effort?"</p>

  <p>The visitor stretched out his hand backwards and, from one of the folds of
  that harmless-looking black portfolio which he had left propped up against
  the typewriter, he drew out an automatic pistol of particularly sinister
  appearance. His mask of amiability had gone. There was a malicious gleam in
  his eyes, a cruel twist to his mouth.</p>

  <p>"Gabriel Samara," he announced, "I am no journalist at all. I am, as a
  matter of fact, in another line of business altogether. It is up to me to
  discover what arrangements you have come to with the President, and how far
  such arrangements are going to help you with your plans in Russia. I do not
  desire to alarm either you or the young lady, but I am going to have the
  truth."</p>

  <p>Samara smiled contemptuously. There was not a flicker of expression in
  Catherine's face.</p>

  <p>"Pray set your mind at ease so far as we are concerned," he begged.
  "Neither the young lady nor I are in the least alarmed at your braggadocio.
  As a matter of curiosity," he went on, "supposing I were disposed to submit
  to this highway robbery, how do you know that I should tell you the
  truth?"</p>

  <p>The intruder pointed to the typewriter and to the written sheets on the
  desk.</p>

  <p>"There is only one task upon which you could be engaged this morning," he
  said. "I guess those sheets will do for me, anyway."</p>

  <p>"And supposing by any remote chance I should refuse to give them to you,"
  Samara persisted, "is it your purpose, may I ask, to assassinate me?"</p>

  <p>"To be candid, yes," was the blunt reply. "But for the fear of canonising
  you in your own country, you would have been assassinated long ago. To-day
  things are different. Even Russia can spare you. Let the young lady fetch the
  papers and hand them to me."</p>

  <p>"The young lady will do nothing of the sort," Samara declared firmly. "So
  much of the result of my mission as I propose to make public at present you
  can read in the <i>New York Comet</i> to-morrow. Now, if it is your intention
  to assassinate me, you had better get on with it."</p>

  <p>The gun was slowly raised to a horizontal position. The face of the man
  behind it was hideously purposeful.</p>

  <p>"What you don't realise," he said deliberately, "is that I am in earnest.
  You are a marked man, Gabriel Samara, less popular in your own country than
  you were, and hated in mine. Sooner or later this would have been your end
  anyway, but listen&mdash;I'm telling you&mdash;your time has come now, unless
  you place those papers on the table in front of you&mdash;before I count
  five. Before I count five, mind, or I shall shoot!"</p>

  <p>Samara looked around the room quickly. There was no fear in his face, only
  the reasonable search of a man who loves life for some means of escape. There
  was none which he could apprehend. His assailant was between him and the
  bell, and the breaking of a window on the eleventh floor&mdash;even if it
  attracted any attention in the street&mdash;would be unlikely to bring help
  in time. All the while the young woman behind the typewriter was watching
  him, with steady eyes and unmoved expression.</p>

  <p>"One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't worry," her quiet voice interrupted soothingly. "That gun
  will not hurt you."</p>

  <p>There was a second's stupefaction, then the sound of a harmless click. The
  silence which followed seemed intolerable, broken though it was in a matter
  of moments by the piercing shrillness of the whistle which Catherine held to
  her lips. For the first time Samara himself was dumbfounded; so was his
  would- be murderer, who was staring open-mouthed at his useless weapon.</p>

  <p>"You see," the young woman who had dominated the situation explained to
  Samara, "this bungling conspirator&mdash;really he ought to take a lesson
  from one of the novelists&mdash;put down his satchel behind the cover of my
  typewriter, having opened it himself first&mdash;to get at his gun easily, I
  suppose. I saw the glitter, so whilst he was indulging in one of his little
  bursts of eloquence, I slipped out the cartridge roll."</p>

  <p>She held it up. Outside there was the sound of a key in the door.</p>

  <p>"I have a smaller gun of the same pattern at home myself, so I understand
  all about them," she went on equably. "And I hope you don't think I was
  blowing that whistle for its musical properties. It belongs to the hotel
  detective. What are you going to say to him, I wonder?"</p>

  <p>The door was thrown open and a stalwart, broad-shouldered man entered
  hastily. He was in plain clothes but the stamp of officialdom was
  unmistakable.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch4"
     id="ch4">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"I'm Brown, the hotel detective," the newcomer announced
  sharply. "What's wrong here?"</p>

  <p>The pseudo Mr. Pride shrugged his shoulders resignedly.</p>

  <p>"I'm a free-lance journalist," he declared; "got connections with half-a-
  dozen New York papers. I wanted Mr. Samara's news and I tried to bluff him
  into giving it to me."</p>

  <p>"A little more than that, I fancy," Samara observed. "There wasn't much
  bluff about your automatic."</p>

  <p>"Are you carrying firearms?" the detective asked.</p>

  <p>The man who called himself Pride handed over his gun.</p>

  <p>"I'm through," he confessed. "If I could have bluffed Mr. Samara into
  giving me a report of his interview in Washington yesterday it would have
  been worth fifty thousand dollars to me. I failed and I guess it's up to me
  to take the consequences."</p>

  <p>The detective was impressed, but non-committal. He appealed to Samara.</p>

  <p>"Is this all there is to it?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>Samara shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The man threatened to assassinate me and appeared to be in earnest," he
  replied. "If the young lady there had not withdrawn the cartridges from his
  automatic pistol, he would probably have done so. I do not believe that he is
  a journalist at all. It is, I imagine, a political affair."</p>

  <p>The detective turned to Catherine. Her deep brown eyes were filled with
  what appeared to be amazement. She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Samara was naturally alarmed," she said, "but I do not believe that
  he was in any actual danger."</p>

  <p>The detective looked quickly from one to the other of the three people in
  the little tableau. Their faces were an interesting study. Both Samara and
  his would-be assassin were obviously surprised; the latter, however, quickly
  concealed his emotion.</p>

  <p>"You don't think that he meant business, then?" the detective asked.</p>

  <p>"My impression is that he was only bluffing," was the confident reply.</p>

  <p>"Then why did you blow that whistle?" her questioner persisted.</p>

  <p>"I am rather a nervous person," she confided. "I hated the thought that
  there might be trouble while I was in the room."</p>

  <p>Samara's amazement was genuine and sincere. He came a little farther into
  the centre of the apartment and stood looking down at Catherine.</p>

  <p>"You didn't hear the click, then, when he pulled the trigger of his
  gun?"</p>

  <p>"Did he pull it?" she asked. "Well, after all, it wasn't loaded."</p>

  <p>He pointed to the roll of cartridges.</p>

  <p>"But you admitted yourself that you took those out of his gun."</p>

  <p>She smiled enigmatically.</p>

  <p>"This has been rather a shock to you, hasn't it?" she said. "I was quite
  worked up myself. I think we probably took the whole matter too
  seriously."</p>

  <p>The self-styled journalist who, during the last few moments, had been
  suffering from an amazement equal to Samara's, recovered himself and played
  up to his cue.</p>

  <p>"Of course," he declared, "it is ridiculous to imagine that the whole
  thing was more than a bluff. I wanted the news and I failed. Well, there you
  are! Fine or prison, it's all the same to me. I'll pay the price!"</p>

  <p>"Have you any charge to offer, sir?" the detective inquired of Samara.</p>

  <p>The latter considered the matter under its new aspect.</p>

  <p>"If you will undertake," he stipulated, "to keep that man under
  surveillance until I am out of the country, that will satisfy me. I am
  convinced, however, that he is a dangerous person and, notwithstanding all
  that has been said, I am also convinced that he is capable of making a
  deliberate attempt upon my life. Under the circumstances, however, I can make
  no charge. If you take my advice, you will inquire into his antecedents and
  his connection with journalism. You may experience some surprises."</p>

  <p>The detective was inclined to be disappointed at this tame conclusion to
  the affair.</p>

  <p>"I guess we'll take you to police headquarters," he decided, turning to
  Bromley Pride's impersonator. "The clerk can ask you a few questions and
  we'll have you held. I'll take care of your gun, if you don't mind, and you
  can hand me over those cartridges, young lady. Will you step across with us
  to police headquarters, Mr. Samara, and state your case?"</p>

  <p>Samara shook his head.</p>

  <p>"In face of the young lady's story," he observed drily, "I don't think
  that my evidence is necessary. Do what you will about the man. I have told
  you the truth about him."</p>

  <p>The detective and his charge left the room. As the latter neared the
  threshold he looked curiously back at Catherine. Her face, however, was
  inscrutable. The door closed upon them. Samara and his temporary secretary
  were alone. The former took a cigarette and lit it.</p>

  <p>"In the first place, young lady," he began, "will you permit me to thank
  you for having saved my life. In the second place, unless you wish me to die
  of curiosity, will you tell me at once why you gave false evidence to the
  detective and placed me in a rather absurd position?"</p>

  <p>Catherine continued her task of collecting her belongings.</p>

  <p>"If you have no more work for me," she said, "the office will be expecting
  me to report. They will charge you for this extra half an hour as it is."</p>

  <p>"I engage you for the day," he declared, frowning.</p>

  <p>"You must arrange that with Miss Loyes," she replied coldly. "I have an
  appointment at three o'clock."</p>

  <p>He took up the telephone receiver.</p>

  <p>"Typewriting Bureau&mdash;urgent," he demanded. . . . "Good. Mr. Samara
  speaking. Can I secure the services of the young lady who is with me now for
  the rest of the day? . . . Good! Certainly."</p>

  <p>He replaced the receiver and turned round with a faint smile of
  triumph.</p>

  <p>"You belong to me for the day," he announced.</p>

  <p>Her fingers strayed over the keys of her machine.</p>

  <p>"My secretarial accomplishments," she reminded him. "Not my
  confidence."</p>

  <p>Samara had never been more than a casual observer of women, had never
  studied them intimately, had certainly never appreciated them. Other passions
  had lain more closely entwined with his life. He scrutinised Catherine for
  the first time with half-reluctant interest, realising the finer qualities of
  her, the delicate femininity, coupled with an amazing self-reliance. He
  realised, too, that in the subtlest of all ways she was beautiful.</p>

  <p>"Did you know that assassin whose cause you suddenly espoused with such
  vigour?" he begged. "Tell me why you chose to sit there and tell deliberate
  falsehoods for his sake?"</p>

  <p>"It happened to amuse me," she observed, smiling. "After all, you have
  nothing to complain of. I saved your life and subsequently I prevented your
  taking vengeance upon your would-be murderer. We might call it quits, I
  think."</p>

  <p>Samara was immensely puzzled. He frowned down at her moodily.</p>

  <p>"Sheer sentimentality," he muttered. "I hate cut-throats. It's a dirty
  business shooting at unarmed men."</p>

  <p>"He wasn't a pleasant person," she agreed. "I disliked his moustache and
  the colour of his tie. Shall we decide to forget him? I am at your disposal
  for the rest of the day. Have you letters to give me?"</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders. It was a novelty this, to find a woman with a
  will as strong as his own. Then he glanced at his watch.</p>

  <p>"I have to go out for half-an-hour," he announced. "I shall be glad if you
  will arrange the typewritten sheets I gave you and pin in the pages I wrote
  by hand in the proper order."</p>

  <p>She looked at him in surprise.</p>

  <p>"But this is the document all the trouble has been about!" she exclaimed.
  "I might read it!"</p>

  <p>He crossed the room to the desk where he had been writing, collected the
  sheets and brought them over to her.</p>

  <p>"My dear young lady," he said, "you are welcome to read my little
  contribution&mdash;if you can."</p>

  <p>She studied the closely-written pages with an apparently puzzled air.</p>

  <p>"So that is Russian," she remarked.</p>

  <p>He nodded. "Looks terrible, doesn't it? Here is my servant back again.
  Ivan, bring me my coat and hat, and watch over this young lady whilst I am
  away. With Ivan Rortz about the place," he continued, "no one will be likely
  to disturb you. I shall give orders outside, too, that no visitors are
  permitted to enter."</p>

  <p>She was still gazing at those sheets filled with strange-looking
  words.</p>

  <p>"Very well," she assented, "I will have this all in order by the time you
  get back."</p>

  <p>To all appearance nothing had happened when Samara returned from his visit
  to a great banking house in Wall Street. He gave his coat and hat to Ivan who
  was sitting&mdash;a grim, silent figure&mdash;in the little hall. Then he
  passed into the inner room where Catherine, having apparently completed her
  task, was leaning back in her chair, turning over the pages of the document
  which she had pinned together.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he asked with sardonic pleasantry. "Did you make anything of
  it?"</p>

  <p>She laid it down and glanced up at him.</p>

  <p>"Naturally," she replied. "I read it."</p>

  <p>"But the Russian part?"</p>

  <p>"The Russian part, of course. It was the most interesting."</p>

  <p>He stared at her. "What do you mean?" he demanded. "You can't read
  Russian?"</p>

  <p>She laughed. "What an accusation!"</p>

  <p>For a moment he looked at her. All the time he had been troubled by a
  sense of a vague likeness; not, perhaps, to any particular person, but to a
  type.</p>

  <p>"Surely you told me that you were an American?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," she replied. "I told you that I had lived in America for twenty-
  three years."</p>

  <p>"Then what are you?"</p>

  <p>"As much Russian as you are," she assured him, smiling.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch5"
     id="ch5">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Samara, though a great statesman and undoubtedly a great
  ruler, was a man of unsuspicious temperament and had more than once committed
  what might have turned out to be diplomatic blunders. He was also, however,
  at all times a man of action. He locked the door behind him, drew a chair in
  front of the telephone and sat facing the young lady whom he had engaged to
  be his secretary for the day.</p>

  <p>"I think," he said, "we will have an explanation."</p>

  <p>She smiled graciously.</p>

  <p>"As I now know exactly the arrangements you have made with the Government
  of this country," she remarked, "I am perfectly willing to tell you anything
  you want to know."</p>

  <p>"In the first place then," he asked, "are you a spy, and, if you are, in
  whose interests are you working?"</p>

  <p>"I am nothing of the sort," she assured him. "I am in effect exactly what
  I seem to be. I am a young lady of New York City, of scanty means, earning a
  living by typewriting and secretarial work."</p>

  <p>"But you are Russian?"</p>

  <p>"My father and mother were both Russians," she acknowledged. "I recognise
  it as my country. I have lived here all my life, however."</p>

  <p>"We are getting on," he said. "Is Borans your real name?"</p>

  <p>"A sufficient portion of it," she answered. "The rest of it is not
  important."</p>

  <p>"Will you explain to me," he went on, "why you first saved my life and
  then behaved so strangely with regard to my would-be murderer?"</p>

  <p>"Now that I have read this document," she said, touching it with her
  fingers, "I am disposed to explain to you. I am not a spy in any sense of the
  word, but I am a patriotic Russian. I belong to a little circle of Russians
  living here, who are filled with one idea as regards our country. We have not
  even the dignity of being a secret society. Everyone knows everything about
  us and everyone laughs at us. We look upon you with respect but as a very
  obstructive person."</p>

  <p>"Upon me?" he exclaimed. "And you call yourself a patriot! Don't dare to
  tell me that you are a Bolshevist!"</p>

  <p>"I am not," she replied indignantly. "I am free to confess that you have
  wiped Russia clean of a great curse. You have done a splendid work, but you
  have not done it our way."</p>

  <p>"What, in God's name, are you then?" he asked impatiently. "What party do
  you represent? I have dragged Russia out of the slough. I have re-established
  her institutions, her economic position. Already she is lifting her head
  amongst the nations of the world."</p>

  <p>"I admit that freely," she acknowledged. "It is because I realise what
  Russia owes you that you are alive. I do not wish, however, to tell you any
  more at present about myself and my political views. I saved your life
  because I believe that you are still necessary to Russia, but in a certain
  sense, I and your would-be assassin are alike. We share one great grievance
  against you. We resent&mdash;or perhaps some might say fear&mdash;your great
  scheme of demilitarisation."</p>

  <p>Samara laughed a little harshly.</p>

  <p>"Really," he said, "I never imagined that life in New York could be so
  interesting. The atmosphere of this room, however, is getting on my nerves. I
  have been through all I can stand for one morning. I can hear the click of
  that wicked-looking pistol even now. Young lady, where are your friends? Why
  do I not know them? I thought most of the Russians in New York who had aims
  or views had been to see me."</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "Not all," she told him. "There are still a few of us
  who hold aloof."</p>

  <p>"Miss Borans," he invited, "will you please do me the honour of taking
  lunch with me?"</p>

  <p>She rose to her feet with alacrity.</p>

  <p>"Not in the hotel," she begged. "It isn't allowed. Anywhere else with
  great pleasure. I warn you, though, that my morning's work has given me an
  absurd appetite."</p>

  <p>"I shall be proud to minister to it," he assured her.</p>

  <p>They lunched at a secluded table in the balcony of the Ritz Carlton.
  Gabriel Samara, like many another man whose life is immersed in his work, and
  who finds himself committed to an unusual action in his everyday routine, was
  conscious of a curious light-heartedness. He felt as if he were a schoolboy
  at play. He, Gabriel Samara, taking his companion of a morning to luncheon in
  a restaurant!</p>

  <p>"It intrigues me," she remarked, "to think that notwithstanding all your
  diplomats here and Mr. Bromley Pride of the <i>New York Comet</i>&mdash;who,
  by the way, telephoned to say that he is on his way back from Philadelphia
  and will see you this afternoon&mdash;I am the only person in the world with
  whom you can discuss the result of your mission to Washington."</p>

  <p>"What I shall do with you, I can't imagine," he groaned. "Everything will
  come out in due course, naturally, but premature disclosure before I get back
  might do an enormous amount of harm. I have a very strenuous opposition to
  face, as you may realise."</p>

  <p>"You need not be afraid," she assured him. "If you are really going to
  give me <i>lobster newburg</i> I shall keep your secret! I warn you that if I
  thought that disclosure would aid our own cause, not all the precious stones
  in your mines could keep me silent, nor all the gold which will soon be
  flowing into your banks. As it is you are safe."</p>

  <p>"That is something to be thankful for, at any rate," he declared. "Miss
  Borans, treat me with confidence. You interest me. Let us talk frankly. If
  indeed you are a patriotic Russian, and have studied in any way the history
  of our times, you will know that I, too, am one. Wherein does my policy of
  reconstruction differ from yours? Why don't you approve of demilitarisation?
  Why should I consent to my country keeping under arms the greatest war
  machine in Europe to pull the chestnuts out of the fire for another
  nation?"</p>

  <p>"There I agree," she admitted. "There must be no more wars."</p>

  <p>"But for my errand here," he continued, "there would have been war within
  a few years. You cannot keep four million men under arms indefinitely without
  trouble. If you knew the tension at the present moment, the stream of
  proposals, the envoys who have been continually sent to me!"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Don't tell me too much about them," she warned him. "You might find that
  I am not so much on your side as you think."</p>

  <p>"But this demilitarisation," he persisted. "You must approve of that. We
  have three perfectly trained armies, of a million men each, ready to fight at
  a moment's notice? Why? You know why, and so do I. Isn't it a sane thing to
  disband a million according to my arrangements, now that I have been able to
  obtain a credit in Washington for the reconstruction of the industries for
  which we can use their labour? Think! In six month's time, not a man of that
  million will be bearing arms. They will be miners, or on the land, working in
  factories, on the railways, or road making, just according to their natural
  bent. Why, it's blood and bone in the country; a million productive toilers
  instead of a million wastrels!"</p>

  <p>"Theoretically I agree," she acknowledged. "It is because I agree that I
  saved your life."</p>

  <p>"Then why did you take his side?" he demanded bluntly.</p>

  <p>"Because, although our point of view and ultimate aim are entirely
  different," she replied, "your would-be assassin stands, in a sense, for the
  same things that we do."</p>

  <p>Samara gave the waiter an order and leaned back in his place.</p>

  <p>"Explain," he insisted. "In as few words as possible, please. I am weary
  of not understanding."</p>

  <p>"Why should I explain?" she murmured. "It is all very simple. We grant you
  that you have lifted Russia out of the slough, but we do not believe that
  your methods, that your system of government will place her back where she
  has a right to be."</p>

  <p>The light broke in upon him then.</p>

  <p>"I see!" he exclaimed. "Who are your friends here? Can I meet them?"</p>

  <p>A sudden deepening of the little lines at the corners of her eyes and the
  twitching of her lips betrayed a genuine amusement.</p>

  <p>"What a sensation I should cause if I took you to see them!" she laughed.
  "I see their faces when I present you! It would be amazing!"</p>

  <p>"Risk it," he begged. "Why not? I am proud to look any Russian patriot in
  the face and tell him who I am."</p>

  <p>She was interested.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose you do feel like that," she observed, after a moment's
  pause. "Why shouldn't you? Sometimes I, myself, make almost a hero of you.
  I'm quite sure that I shall always be proud to think that I have lunched with
  the great Samara. I shall be grateful, too, for other reasons. Do you find me
  very greedy?"</p>

  <p>"Delightfully so," he admitted. "All healthy people are greedy. The vice
  of it only creeps in with the lack of self-restraint."</p>

  <p>"I suppose," she remarked, "my manners are good, but if you only knew how
  I longed to see whether he has remembered the olives with the chicken. Hold
  tight to your chair now, please, and prepare for a shock. I am going to ask
  you a sickeningly obvious question. Tell me how you like America?"</p>

  <p>Gabriel Samara looked around him thoughtfully. He answered the spirit
  which prompted the question rather than the question itself.</p>

  <p>"I venerate America," he declared. "Why shouldn't I? In a sense I am the
  champion of modern democracy. America is a shining light to all other
  nations, yet I maintain that Russia, with its unified population, has a
  better chance of reaching the supreme heights."</p>

  <p>"I sometimes wonder," she sighed, "whether the true spirit of a republic
  can flourish in a land which knows such terrible extremes of wealth and
  poverty?"</p>

  <p>"It is a drawback," he agreed. "That is where we in Russia have an
  advantage. We are framing a new constitution. Our laws are adapted to meet
  existing circumstances. Communism is dead, but we shall never tolerate the
  multi-millionaire."</p>

  <p>"Do you think," she asked, "that Germany will ever let you become really
  powerful?"</p>

  <p>"Not willingly," he replied, "but the monarchical sentiment in Germany is
  not strong enough yet to upset the government of the country. Germany, of
  course, will bitterly resent the success of my mission over here, but she
  will have to get rid of her republic before we need take the war scare
  seriously."</p>

  <p>She looked at him across the table.</p>

  <p>"Do you think that the monarchist party in Germany is gaining ground?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I know nothing about German internal affairs," he answered evasively. "I
  have more than enough to do to keep in touch with the trend of opinion in my
  own country."</p>

  <p>The thread of conversation appeared to be suddenly broken. Samara began to
  ask questions about the people by whom they were surrounded. The restaurant
  on this fine spring morning seemed like a great nosegay of brilliant flowers.
  Three-quarters of the guests were women and it was a season of abandonment in
  colour, with yellow and pink predominating. New York, too, no less than
  Paris, was a city of subtle perfumes, cunningly distilled and exotic. Samara,
  smoking his cigarette with the air of an epicure, found much to interest him
  in his environment.</p>

  <p>"These people are like Russians in one way," he remarked. "They spend
  their money."</p>

  <p>"I have a German friend here," she confided, "who argues that there is
  always more extravagance under a republic. His point is that the bourgeoisie
  make money easily and spend it readily. The aristocrat who has to keep up a
  great appearance is compelled to be more miserly, apart even from the
  question of good taste."</p>

  <p>"Is this the prelude to a discussion upon the ethics of government?" he
  suggested, smiling.</p>

  <p>"Indeed, no," she replied. "I am not so presumptuous. My principles are
  matters of instinct with me. I do not argue about them. I accept them."</p>

  <p>She helped herself to one of his proffered cigarettes, and he paid the
  bill.</p>

  <p>"Quite the monarchical touch," he observed. "If you are postponing your
  return to your native land, however, until there is a Tzar upon the throne, I
  am afraid you are doomed to a very long spell of homesickness."</p>

  <p>"Who knows?" she exclaimed carelessly. "Revolutions are rather the fashion
  just now. I may return to find you in chains and the knout cracking once
  more."</p>

  <p>She had spoken lightly enough, but he chose to take her seriously.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact," he confided, "there is a certain amount of very
  disquieting truth in what you say. I have stamped out Bolshevism in Russia
  for ever. The spirit of anarchistic communism, at any rate, is dead, but I
  honestly believe that, especially amongst the peasantry, there is an
  unwholesome sort of craving for the burdens of Tzardom."</p>

  <p>"That is almost the most interesting thing that you have said," she
  remarked, as they rose to go. "Thanks very much for my wonderful luncheon. Do
  you really require my services this afternoon?"</p>

  <p>"Without a doubt," he insisted. "I am going on from here to pay a call. At
  four o'clock I shall be back in my rooms. Let me find you there, if you
  please."</p>

  <p>They were about to part in the hallway of the restaurant, when Mrs. Saxon
  J. Bossington intervened. She sailed down upon them with the air of taking
  both into custody; ample, fashionably dressed, a triumph of artificiality,
  forty&mdash;or perhaps fifty&mdash;lisping with the ingenuousness of
  childhood.</p>

  <p>"Why, if this isn't our little working girl!" she exclaimed, gripping the
  none too willing hand of Samara's companion. "Well, well, is this where you
  young women who earn your livings lunch as a rule? The number of times I've
  asked you to make one of our little luncheon parties here, Catherine, and you
  have always told me 'nothing doing in working hours.'"</p>

  <p>Catherine presented the appearance of a young person of good breeding,
  striving to be polite whilst in bodily pain.</p>

  <p>"To-day is an exception," she said. "I am lunching with a fellow-
  countryman."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Saxon J. Bossington smiled graciously. She had just sufficient
  discernment, born of her social craving, to appreciate distinction even when
  it did not conform to type.</p>

  <p>"Present your friend," she suggested.</p>

  <p>Catherine, with a deprecating glance at her companion, murmured his name.
  Samara bowed&mdash;a little lower perhaps than was usual in a city where
  handshaking is almost sacramental. He did not seem to notice, however, the
  pearl-gloved hand so frankly extended.</p>

  <p>"You're not Mr. Gabriel Samara, who has come over from Russia to see our
  President?" she exclaimed breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"My name," he replied, "is Gabriel Samara. I know of no other. I have just
  come from Washington where your President was good enough to receive me."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Saxon J. Bossington simply quivered with excitement. It was without a
  doubt a most thrilling meeting.</p>

  <p>"I want to tell you, Mr. Samara, right now," she declared, "that you've
  met the one woman in New York who has read every line that's been written
  about you since you landed and who has been just crazy to meet you. This is
  going to be wonderful. Catherine's bringing you to-night, of course?"</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," he observed, genuinely perplexed. "I have not the
  honour&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Catherine? Miss Borans, of course&mdash;you will come to-night with her?
  It's the meeting, you know. Why, it will be great! Prince Nicholas is coming,
  General Orenburg, Colonel Kirdorff, the dear Grand Duchess&mdash;all of them!
  It's most opportune!"</p>

  <p>Samara turned to his companion. He was guilty of a gross breach of
  manners. He addressed her in Russian.</p>

  <p>"What is this woman talking about?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Bossington was delighted. She rippled on before Catherine had a
  chance to reply.</p>

  <p>"Such a wonderful language!" she exclaimed. "Sometimes they talk it in
  conclave, and I can assure you, Mr. Samara, it just thrills me. Some people
  call it harsh. I love it. Don't you think, Catherine dear," she went on, her
  tone becoming almost wheedling, "that you could persuade Mr. Samara to come a
  little earlier and dine with us first to-night&mdash;just a very small
  affair&mdash; twenty covers or so? Joseph would be tickled to death."</p>

  <p>Catherine laid her hand upon the arm of her loquacious acquaintance.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Bossington," she said, "I am afraid you don't quite understand. Mr.
  Samara is a Russian, of course, and a very distinguished one, but his aims
  are scarcely the aims of our friends. I do not think we should agree. It
  never even occurred to me to bring Mr. Samara to the meeting."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Bossington was horrified.</p>

  <p>"My dear," she cried, "you're crazy! There you are, a dozen of you, all
  Russians, out of a home and out of a country and longing to get back again.
  Why, here's a man who can help you. Get together and talk it over. I'm only
  thankful it's my turn to entertain you. I should be the proudest woman in New
  York to think that Mr. Samara had paid me a visit. If we could only fix up
  that dinner!"</p>

  <p>Gabriel Samara was a little weary. His glance was straying through the
  windows to the sunlit streets. The close atmosphere of the lounge, the heavy
  perfumes, the din of conversation were beginning to nauseate him.</p>

  <p>"I have a call to make in the hotel, Miss Borans," he reminded her. "If
  you and Mrs.&mdash;Mrs. Bossington, I believe&mdash;will excuse me, I will
  take my leave. The Ambassador from my country is expecting me at half-past
  two."</p>

  <p>His would-be hostess gripped him by the arm.</p>

  <p>"Not one step do you move from here," she insisted, "until you have
  promised to come and see these good people to-night."</p>

  <p>"So far as that is concerned," he replied, "I am in Miss Borans' hands. If
  it is her wish&mdash;if they are country-people of mine who desire to meet
  me&mdash;I shall be charmed."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Saxon J. Bossington had attained her object. She saw some friends to
  whom it was necessary that she should immediately communicate the fact that
  she had been discussing Russian politics with Mr. Gabriel Samara. With a
  little shower of farewells she departed. Catherine glanced up at her
  companion. There was something of mutual comprehension in their smile.</p>

  <p>"It appears to be our fate to spend the evening together," he
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"We shall see," she murmured. "Shall I expect you about four?"</p>

  <p>"I shall not be later," he promised.</p>

  <p>Samara watched his departing companion as she passed through the little
  throng of gossiping women on her way to the street. Amongst all this
  flamboyant elegance, these vivid splashes of colour, and elaborate toilettes,
  there was something almost aloof in her still drabness&mdash;her disdain of
  all those freely displayed arts. Yet, so far as sheer femininity was
  concerned, Samara felt the spell of her so strongly that not one of the many
  attractive women by whom he was surrounded, several of whom looked at him
  with friendly curiosity, seemed in any way comparable to her. He watched her
  disappear and turned back into the hotel to keep an appointment with the
  Ambassador of his country, who had followed him from Washington the night
  before. His eagerness for the approaching discussion, however, had suddenly
  evaporated.</p>

  <p>"I am, after all, a pagan," he muttered, as he stepped into the lift to
  make his call. "For the moment I had forgotten Russia."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch6"
     id="ch6">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Catherine, on her return to Samara's suite at the Hotel
  Weltmore, found the sofa in the sitting-room occupied by a young man who
  stared at her with curious eyes as she entered. He was tall, phenomenally
  thin and phenomenally sallow. The hollows in his cheeks were so pronounced
  that the higher bones themselves seemed almost on the point of pushing their
  way through the flesh. His coal-black hair was long and dishevelled, and his
  unshaven condition added to the wildness of his appearance. Catherine, with
  the instinct of her sex, took note only of his obvious ill-health, and her
  tone as she addressed him was kindly.</p>

  <p>"You must be Andrew Kroupki, Mr. Samara's secretary," she said, removing
  the cover from her typewriter. "Mr. Samara scarcely expected that you would
  be well enough to get up to-day."</p>

  <p>"I cannot lie in bed here," he declared feebly. "I become nervous. It is
  terrible to be ill so far from home. There is only Ivan, and Ivan hates
  me."</p>

  <p>"Why should he do that?" she asked soothingly.</p>

  <p>"Because he and I live closest to the Chief," was the impatient reply.
  "Ivan is jealous. He is very foolish. It is his strength which protects, and
  my brains. We are allies, but he will not have it so. Have you been working
  for the Chief?"</p>

  <p>"All the morning," she answered. "I still have a long list of invitations
  to decline. He is returning at four o'clock."</p>

  <p>"Do you know anything about a despatch for Cherbourg?" he continued. "My
  brain was on fire this morning. I could not even ask."</p>

  <p>"The despatch is finished and Mr. Samara took it away with him," she
  confided. "Part of it I typed and the more important part he wrote in by
  hand."</p>

  <p>The young man closed his eyes for a moment.</p>

  <p>"It is terrible to be like this," he groaned, "when one is needed."</p>

  <p>She rose from her seat and came over to the couch, laid her hand for a
  moment upon his head and felt his pulse.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen a doctor?" she inquired.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he answered; "I am taking some medicine. He told me to lie in bed
  and let my brain rest."</p>

  <p>"Would you like a drink? Some iced water?"</p>

  <p>He made a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"I hate it," he muttered. "In Russia we do not drink water."</p>

  <p>She drew a phial of eau de Cologne from her bag, soaked her handkerchief
  with it and laid it upon his head.</p>

  <p>"That is very pleasant," he sighed gratefully.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," she suggested, "would you care for some tea&mdash;tea with
  lemon, freshly made and clear coloured?"</p>

  <p>"Wonderful," he assented eagerly.</p>

  <p>She sent for the floor waiter, procured some materials, and busied herself
  for a few moments with the equipage which he brought. The young man sipped
  the beverage when she handed it to him with something approaching
  ecstasy.</p>

  <p>"I have had nothing like this since the fever came," he told her. "What is
  your name?"</p>

  <p>"Catherine Borans."</p>

  <p>He looked at her with wide-open eyes. Already there was a gleam of
  something more than admiration in them.</p>

  <p>"Where do you come from?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The Weltmore Typewriting Bureau downstairs," she replied. "Now try to go
  to sleep for a little time. Do you think that the sound of the typewriter
  will disturb you? If so, I will write some of these letters by hand. I do not
  think that Mr. Samara would mind."</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It will not disturb me," he assured her. "I should like to lie here and
  watch you work. You are a very wonderful person. Are you an American?"</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"You are not to talk any more," she enjoined. "Close your eyes and try to
  sleep."</p>

  <p>"I like to watch you," he murmured.</p>

  <p>Catherine was a person unaffected with self-consciousness, so she
  continued her work methodically, although every time she looked up she found
  his eyes upon her.</p>

  <p>"More tea," he begged once.</p>

  <p>She gave him another cup, and renewed the eau de Cologne on her
  handkerchief. Presently he closed his eyes. When Samara returned he was
  sleeping peacefully.</p>

  <p>"You didn't tell me that I was to be hospital nurse as well as typist,"
  she remarked, speaking in an undertone.</p>

  <p>Samara crossed the room and looked down at the young man.</p>

  <p>"You've done very well with him," he said. "His respiration is better, the
  fever is down. What have you been giving him? Tea? It smells very good. I
  should like to try it myself."</p>

  <p>She made some more and he drank it gratefully. He appeared a little tired;
  his interview had not been altogether satisfactory.</p>

  <p>"You have the Russian touch for tea," he told her. "There is nothing like
  it in the world. I drink wines and spirits&mdash;everything&mdash;but tea
  like this is better than all."</p>

  <p>"And better for you," she observed.</p>

  <p>"Sometimes its exhilaration is not rapid enough," he said.</p>

  <p>The young man stirred in his place. His master's tone was suddenly kind as
  he turned towards him.</p>

  <p>"You are feeling better, Andrew?" he asked in Russian.</p>

  <p>"Much better," was the eager reply. "This lady has been very good to me.
  Did you find her by accident, sir?"</p>

  <p>"By accident," Samara assured him.</p>

  <p>"She is intelligent?"</p>

  <p>"She is adequate," was the expressionless reply. "I need your help,
  though, Andrew. Get well quickly."</p>

  <p>"I am almost well now," the young man declared, sitting up. "In a few days
  I shall be able to do anything. It in fortunate for you, master," he went on,
  still speaking in his own language, "that you hate women."</p>

  <p>"I do not hate them," Samara protested. "I simply do not appreciate
  them."</p>

  <p>"You hate them," Andrew repeated emphatically. "Even when you play with
  them you show it in your manner. It is fortunate for you. This young lady
  might cause you trouble."</p>

  <p>Samara glanced behind uneasily. Catherine was continuing her task with
  immovable face.</p>

  <p>"I am going to take you to your room now, Andrew," he announced. "Your
  leaving it was against the doctor's orders."</p>

  <p>"I am content," the young man assented. "I am very weary, but I feel sleep
  coming."</p>

  <p>They crossed the room together, the young man leaning on Samara's arm. At
  the door he turned back.</p>

  <p>"Thank you very much, miss," he said in English.</p>

  <p>"Get well quickly," she enjoined, with a smile.</p>

  <p>Samara returned a few minutes later. Catherine leaned back in her
  chair.</p>

  <p>"Thank you for being kind to Andrew," he said.</p>

  <p>"He seems delicate," she remarked.</p>

  <p>"A little neurotic, and, I am afraid, consumptive," Samara agreed. "He is
  the son of one of my great friends, the man who first helped me fight against
  the anarchists. When he died I took the lad to work for me. He is able and
  devoted, but he has exaggerated ideas of everything. Your kindness has been
  good for him. He is already asleep."</p>

  <p>"He is very devoted to you," she said.</p>

  <p>"Almost foolishly so," he admitted. "There are times when I have trouble
  with him. Tell me now about these friends of yours. I see that I was right in
  my assumption. You and your companions are amongst those who hope for the
  impossible things."</p>

  <p>"If I may, I will explain," Catherine suggested. "My mother died in this
  country when I was three years old and left as my patroness the exiled Grand
  Duchess Alexandrina Sophia of Kossas. I have been brought up, therefore,
  indirectly attached to a strange little circle. Would you really like to know
  about them?"</p>

  <p>"Most certainly," he assured her emphatically. "They are Russians."</p>

  <p>"Very well, then," she continued. "There are six of them. We live in an
  apartment house a long way the other side of Central Park. We all share a
  sitting-room for purposes of economy. Every one is poor, every one is shabby,
  every one is miserable. Now, if you wish, I shall tell you about them, one by
  one."</p>

  <p>"If you please," he murmured.</p>

  <p>"First of all, then, there is Nicholas Imanoff," she began. "He is the
  nearest living descendant of the last Tzar. He is twenty-five years old, was
  educated with great difficulty at Harvard, and ekes out an embittered
  existence selling bonds on commission for a New York stockbroking firm. He
  calls himself Mr. Ronoff, but every one knows who he is, and I think it very
  probable that the little business he gets is because he appeals to people's
  curiosity. He is rather bad-tempered, does not take enough exercise, drinks a
  little more than is good for him, but is quite capable at times of justifying
  his descent."</p>

  <p>"An admirable sketch," Samara declared. "Proceed, please."</p>

  <p>"I will speak of my patroness, the Grand Duchess," Catherine continued.
  "She is a fair, fat old lady of sixty-eight. She dresses abominably, her walk
  is almost a waddle, she takes no care of her person, and she earns a few
  dollars a month by making artificial roses. She calls herself Mrs.
  Kossas."</p>

  <p>"Less interesting," Samara commented. "Proceed."</p>

  <p>"There is Boris Kirdorff," she went on. "Sometimes I believe he uses an
  obsolete title of 'Colonel.' I think that he has more brains than any of the
  others, and certainly less conscience. He comes from a great family, as I
  dare say you know. His is a cold, unattractive personality, but he is a born
  schemer and if ever the others have hopes it is through him they are
  expressed. He is secretary to a very <i>bourgeois</i> card club, but I think
  the greater part of his small earnings is spent in gambling."</p>

  <p>"General Orenburg is a more pleasing personality, but he is older. He is
  the only one who has any money and that is a very small amount. He puts it
  into the common stock. He spends his whole day at the libraries, and he has
  fifteen different schemes for bringing about a monarchist rising in
  Russia."</p>

  <p>"Any other young people?" Samara inquired.</p>

  <p>"There is Cyril Volynia Sabaroff of Perm and his sister, Rosa. Cyril is
  interested in the sale of automobiles. His income varies a great deal,
  though. Rosa is engaged as reception clerk at a photographer's shop. They are
  less serious than the rest of us, and, if only they had money, I think they
  would be content to stay in this country for the remainder of their days. The
  others of us, as you may have gathered, have only one desire in life, and
  that is to return to Russia."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" Samara observed. "You are all Russians. You have a perfect
  right to live in your native land."</p>

  <p>There was a moment's silence. Catherine was gazing across the top of her
  typewriter at her companion. Samara was lounging on the other side of the
  table, his hands in his pockets, a cigar which he had lighted, without
  remark, between his lips.</p>

  <p>"You seem to forget," she said quietly, "that there is such a thing as a
  decree of banishment against the absentee aristocracy of Russia."</p>

  <p>"Rubbish!" he exclaimed. "Out of date! Antediluvian! I'll revoke it the
  day I get back. You can consider it revoked now. Mind you," he went on,
  striking the table a mighty blow with his fist, "there is another decree in
  Russia which will never be suspended. It is my aim to make Russia the most
  free country in the world, but if I find an anarchist in caf&eacute;, street
  or public meeting, he is shot within the hour. Against anarchists the law of
  Russia is as the law against vermin&mdash;death; summary, unquestionable!
  There is no one else calling himself a Russian who is not welcome to take his
  place amongst the community."</p>

  <p>"Will you repeat this to my friends?" she asked, and there was very nearly
  a tremor in her tone.</p>

  <p>"Take me to them," he invited.</p>

  <p>"I shall call for you at nine o'clock," she promised. "Please let us work
  now. I feel that I am wasting your time."</p>

  <p>It was a dejected, almost a pathetic little crowd gathered round the
  sparsely laid dinner-table in a back apartment of the Amsterdam Avenue
  Private Hotel. The furniture, the table appointments, the faded carpet upon
  the floor were all according to type. The prospect from the solitary window
  was of brick and masonry and a jumble of telegraph wires. Occasionally the
  room shook with the thunder of an elevated train passing near by. A coloured
  servant, whose dress seemed to have been put on in scraps, was serving the
  meal from the sideboard. There were two jugs of water and a carafe of light
  beer upon the table; in its centre a little vase with a handful of cheap
  flowers. General Orenburg sat at one end and Alexandrina of Kossas at the
  other. Conversation was intermittent. They all appeared to be engrossed in
  their own thoughts.</p>

  <p>"Catherine is late to-day," Alexandrina observed.</p>

  <p>"Catherine is late, but here," the young lady in question remarked,
  opening the door in time to hear the sound of her own name.</p>

  <p>They all looked at her with interest. She seemed somehow or other to
  represent the vitality of the little circle, which brightened visibly at her
  coming. Kirdorff, whom nothing in this world escaped, watched her curiously,
  as she took her place. His was a queer, hawklike face with black eyes and
  indrawn lips. His hair, thin about the temples and carefully brushed, was
  unexpectedly light-coloured.</p>

  <p>"Catherine has something to tell us," he observed.</p>

  <p>"I have something very wonderful to tell you," Catherine confessed, as she
  pushed aside a bowl of very unappetising soup. "You need not bother about my
  dinner. I lunched at the Ritz Carlton, and I shall eat a great many of Mrs.
  Saxon J. Bossington's sandwiches later on. Listen to me, everybody. Of all
  men in this world, with whom do you think I lunched? It is absurd to ask you
  to guess. I lunched with Gabriel Samara!"</p>

  <p>A thunderbolt through the roof could have scarcely created a greater
  sensation. There were exclamations in every key. Then, with the passing of
  that first wave of astonishment, came a fierce interest. Kirdorff leaned
  across the table, his fists clenched, his eyes protuberant. The Grand Duchess
  talked to herself in broken sentences. Nicholas Imanoff spoke.</p>

  <p>"How came you to meet Samara?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"In the most natural way possible," Catherine explained. "He telephoned to
  the Bureau for a typist&mdash;his secretary has been taken ill. The
  assignment was given to me. My work pleased him. He invited me to lunch."</p>

  <p>"You lunched with that man!" Nicholas muttered.</p>

  <p>"There are very few men I wouldn't lunch with at the Ritz Carlton,"
  Catherine rejoined coolly, "but I will tell you this now of Gabriel Samara.
  He stands for other principles than ours, but he is a man. He is what Cyril
  Volynia here, when he came back from England, called a 'sportsman.' We met
  Mrs. Saxon J. Bossington, and she spoke of to-night. Samara asked who my
  Russian friends were, and I told him. Then listen to what he said. 'They are
  Russians. Why do they live in New York? Why do they not go back to
  Russia?'"</p>

  <p>"Samara said that!" Kirdorff intervened.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely!" Catherine continued. "I reminded him of the decree of
  banishment. He scoffed at it. He undertook that it should be revoked. He has
  told me in plain words that you are all of you free to return to Russia."</p>

  <p>There was an almost awed silence. Alexandrina was sobbing quietly into her
  handkerchief. Kirdorff was drumming upon the table.</p>

  <p>"Free to return!" he muttered. "Why not? If one could only breathe
  there&mdash; could live&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Or die." General Orenburg interrupted fervently, "so long as it was in
  Russia!"</p>

  <p>"There is surely a living to be made there as well as here," Cyril Volynia
  declared. "Perhaps my firm would let me open a branch dep&ocirc;t at
  Moscow."</p>

  <p>"Listen," Catherine warned them, "you must make up your minds to this. It
  is necessary and it may lead to great things. You must meet Samara."</p>

  <p>The Grand Duchess left off sobbing. The suggestion was so astounding that
  the words themselves seemed to convey no definite meaning to her.</p>

  <p>"Meet Samara!" Kirdorff reflected. "He will want to know our attitude
  towards his Government, of course. He will require pledges."</p>

  <p>"I have not the faintest idea what he will say to you," Catherine
  observed. "I can only tell you this. He is a brave man. He is rash. He is
  broad- minded. He is ingenuous. He does not in the least resemble one's idea
  of a democratic leader."</p>

  <p>Nicholas Imanoff looked across the table. There was a note of covert
  jealousy in his tone.</p>

  <p>"Does he know who you are?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"He does not, and I desire that he should not know," she rejoined. "I have
  spoken of Alexandrina of Kossas as my patroness."</p>

  <p>"Tell us this," Kirdorff asked quietly, the instincts of the conspirator
  already stirring within him. "In the course of your work to-day did you come
  to any conclusion as to the success or failure of his mission over here? Have
  you formed any idea as to how far he means to go with this mad scheme of
  his?"</p>

  <p>"We will talk of that later," Catherine replied. "It is better for you to
  know nothing to-night. What I want you all to remember now is that in
  half-an- hour's time we leave here to hold one of our formal meetings under
  the roof and patronage of Mrs. Saxon J. Bossington."</p>

  <p>"You are coming with us, Catherine?" the Grand Duchess demanded.</p>

  <p>"I am going back to the hotel to fetch Mr. Samara," was the unexpected
  rejoinder.</p>

  <p>Nicholas half rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I will escort you," he declared.</p>

  <p>Catherine smiled at him coldly.</p>

  <p>"You will do nothing of the sort, Nicholas," she said. "If you take my
  advice, you will remember what I say. So far as Gabriel Samara knows, I am a
  typist from the Weltmore Secretarial Bureau. It is my wish that he knows no
  more than this. Kindly remember that."</p>

  <p>Kirdorff nodded approvingly.</p>

  <p>"Our little sister knows best," he pronounced.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch7"
     id="ch7">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Mrs. Saxon J. Bossington dispensed hospitality in a Fifth
  Avenue palace, built by a multi-millionaire of world-wide fame and purchased
  by her obedient spouse at the time of the last oil combine. She entertained
  lavishly and indiscriminately. Society, diplomacy, and even artists were all
  alike welcome. Her peculiar fancy, however, was acting as hostess to what she
  was endeavouring to make known as the "Russian Circle."</p>

  <p>"My dear Saxon," she explained to her husband, "no one knows who these
  people are. All we do know is that they are aristocrats. There's the Grand
  Duchess, of course, and the General, and Colonel Kirdorff&mdash;they are the
  bluest blood in Russia, but those others aren't pulling the wool over my
  eyes, though they call themselves plain 'Mr.' and 'Mrs.' and 'Miss.' It's my
  belief there's more of the Royal Family than one in that little crowd. And
  Saxon&mdash;there's Prince Nicholas now, an Imanoff&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What is an 'Imanoff,' anyway?" Mr. Bossington interrupted, giving his
  coat tails a pull.</p>

  <p>"The family name of the Russian Royal Family," his wife declared in a tone
  of awe.</p>

  <p>Mr. Bossington appeared unimpressed.</p>

  <p>"Thought they were all wiped out in a cellar or somewhere," he
  objected.</p>

  <p>"All the direct branch were assassinated&mdash;murdered," his wife agreed,
  "in a cellar. The details were too horrible. Some of the others, however, got
  away, and one or two escaped out of the country. Prince Nicholas is the next
  heir to the throne of those left alive."</p>

  <p>"Well, there isn't going to be any throne," Mr. Bossington observed.
  "Russia's doing thundering well under her new Republic. That fellow Samara
  has set her going again. I had an offer for some oil concessions from his
  Government to-day, made me through Washington. I shall have to send a man
  over next week."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Bossington deemed that the time had come for her great
  announcement.</p>

  <p>"Saxon," she said, "to-night I want you to be at your best. Gabriel
  Samara, the greatest man in Russia, is coming here."</p>

  <p>"You don't say!" Mr. Bossington exclaimed, properly impressed at last.
  "Does he know anything about oil, I wonder?"</p>

  <p>"You can cut out that stuff," his wife enjoined angrily, with a brief
  relapse into the verbiage of past years. "What I mean, Saxon, is that I want
  you to be the perfect gentleman to-night&mdash;the broad-minded American
  host. We may get asked to Russia. Come right along into the library now.
  They'll be here before we know where we are."</p>

  <p>"What I want to know," Mr. Bossington demanded, as they crossed the hall,
  "is how our friends and this man, Samara, are likely to pull together, and
  where on earth did you come across him?"</p>

  <p>A butler in command motioned to a footman, who threw open the door of a
  magnificent library. It was an apartment which much resembled the interior of
  a chapel, with vaulted roof, stained-glass windows, and an organ in the far
  end. There were divans and chairs, a round table at which a score of places
  were set, and a sideboard, groaning with edibles of every sort, flanked by a
  long row of gold-foiled bottles. Mrs. Bossington looked around her
  critically.</p>

  <p>"I guess this is cosy enough for them, Saxon," she observed.</p>

  <p>"There's plenty of the stuff, anyway," he remarked, with a glance towards
  the sideboard. "But how did you get hold of this fellow Samara? Those others
  all seem as if they had stepped out of a dime show, but Samara's the real
  goods!&mdash;as big a man, in his way, as our President!"</p>

  <p>"I met him with that little Catherine Borans, the typewriting girl,
  lunching at the Ritz Carlton," Mrs. Bossington explained. "Of course it's all
  nonsense about her being really a working girl. There isn't one of them has a
  better air than she has. They are close-mouthed and all," she went on,
  listening for the bell. "I tried to get the old General, the other day, to
  tell me who she was. He just smiled and shook his head. The Duchess seemed on
  the point of telling me and then she pulled herself up. 'She is of our order,
  Mrs. Bossington,' was all I could get her to say."</p>

  <p>The door was suddenly thrown open. The little stream of expected guests
  began to arrive; a curious company in their way, but each with his own
  peculiar claim to distinction. General Orenburg, who first bent over his
  hostess' hand, was ponderous and bulky, his shabby dinner clothes carefully
  brushed, the ends of his black tie a little shiny. Nevertheless he bore
  himself as a man with a great past should. He was accompanied by Prince
  Nicholas, whose irritation had departed for the evening, but whose manner was
  still stiff and abstracted. The Grand Duchess entered the room directly
  afterwards. She had changed her gown since dinner-time and her hair was
  parted and brushed so smoothly back that it seemed almost like a plastered
  wig. Cyril Volynia Sabaroff of Perm followed, with his sister Rosa. Behind
  them came General Kirdorff. They all stood in little groups whilst a footman
  served coffee and liqueurs. Mrs. Saxon J. Bossington flitted from one to the
  other, with much to say concerning their expected guest. Her husband listened
  to the description of a new automobile which some friends of Cyril Sabaroff
  were soon to put on the market.</p>

  <p>"If this isn't too sweet to see you all together!" their hostess
  exclaimed. "Now I do hope you'll make yourselves comfortable and have your
  little chat just as though no one were here. There's a table you can sit
  round and a bite of supper for you later on. I hope you gentlemen will pay a
  visit to the sideboard whenever you like."</p>

  <p>Prince Nicholas detached himself from the others.</p>

  <p>"Your hospitality is wonderful, madam," he declared. "We beg that you will
  not leave us. Colonel Kirdorff has promised to talk to us to-night about the
  probable result of the Samara type of government, and the General has a few
  remarks to make concerning these rumours of demilitarisation in Russia."</p>

  <p>"Very interesting, I'm sure," Mrs. Bossington murmured, sailing away to
  greet some fresh arrivals&mdash;an elderly professor and his wife.</p>

  <p>"Will Samara back out, do you think?" General Orenburg asked his neighbour
  anxiously.</p>

  <p>Kirdorff shook his head.</p>

  <p>"If he promised, he will come," he declared confidently. "I have that much
  faith in him, at any rate. He is not likely to break his word."</p>

  <p>The greater part of the little company was now assembled. They were about
  a dozen outside the circle of Catherine's immediate entourage; all Russians
  and ardent Monarchists, but of various types and positions in the world. They
  were barely settled in their places round the table, when the eagerly
  expected event happened. The door was opened and the butler made his
  announcement.</p>

  <p>"Miss Catherine Borans&mdash;Mr. Gabriel Santara!"</p>

  <p>The newcomers advanced towards their hostess. They exchanged a few words
  of salutation whilst Samara bowed low and raised her somewhat pudgy fingers
  to his lips. Then Catherine led him towards the table.</p>

  <p>"Please, all of you," she said, "I have ventured to bring a visitor to see
  you. We have been very curious about him, very critical, sometimes
  censorious. After all, though, we must remember that he is a fellow-
  countryman."</p>

  <p>There followed a few moments of intense silence. They were all engrossed
  in their study of this man, the foremost figure in their country; the man
  who, from their somewhat narrow point of view, stood between them and their
  desire. Certainly so far as appearance went he was at a disadvantage with
  none of them. He was well groomed, his evening clothes were impeccable, and
  he possessed to the fullest extent the natural dignity of a man holding a
  great place in the world.</p>

  <p>"Samara! Gabriel Samara," Alexandrina murmured, studying him through her
  lorgnettes.</p>

  <p>"Samara!" the fair-haired Rosa Sabaroff exclaimed, looking at him with
  undisguised awe.</p>

  <p>"Gabriel Samara!" the General said, under his breath, stiffening
  insensibly.</p>

  <p>The attitude of the little gathering towards their visitor could scarcely
  be called hospitable. The General and Prince Nicholas both inclined their
  heads, but did not offer their hands. Samara, however, showed no signs of
  taking offence. His bow to Alexandrina had been the bow of a courtier. He was
  himself too interested in his own contemplation of the rest of the party to
  appreciate their lack of cordiality. Mr. Bossington, as though he judged the
  moment propitious, introduced himself into the circle.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Samara," he said, "glad to meet you, sir. Saxon Bossington, my
  name&mdash; glad to be your host. There's a proposition about oil they were
  asking me to look into, somewhere north of the Caspian Sea."</p>

  <p>Samara smiled.</p>

  <p>"You are without doubt, sir, one of the capitalists whom your President
  mentioned to me," he rejoined politely. "Russia has need of your brains and
  your money. We think that we can repay all that you have to offer. Our
  greatest necessity just now is to find employment for a large number of
  men."</p>

  <p>"You are really going to demilitarise then!" Colonel Kirdorff
  intervened.</p>

  <p>Samara, who had been standing a few feet apart, turned once more towards
  the table.</p>

  <p>"You seem to be all my country people," he observed. "Why should I have
  secrets from you? It is my intention immediately on my return to Russia to
  demobilise the whole of our Third Army, consisting of about a million men. I
  should have done so before if I could have been sure of finding employment
  for them. My mission over here was to arrange something of the sort."</p>

  <p>"What about the Germans?" Prince Nicholas demanded bluntly.</p>

  <p>Some part of the geniality seemed to depart from Samara's manner. There
  was a note almost of hauteur in his reply.</p>

  <p>"The armies of Russia," he said, "have been trained by and perhaps learned
  their vocation partly from German officers. Those German officers have been
  well paid for their labours. For anything else, the army consists of Russian
  soldiers, bound together for one purpose, and one purpose only&mdash;the
  defence of their country. In my opinion and in the opinion of my counsellors,
  the necessity for their existence on so large a scale no longer exists."</p>

  <p>Samara was still standing. The General rose to his feet and indicated a
  chair.</p>

  <p>"Will you join us, sir?" he invited.</p>

  <p>There was a breathless pause&mdash;the remainder of the handful of
  Monarchists sat spell-bound. With a grave bow to the General, Samara accepted
  the invitation. Prince Nicholas was on his left, the Grand Duchess a little
  lower down.</p>

  <p>"This is a strange day," the General continued. "We never thought to
  welcome amongst us the head of the Russian Republic. I and my friends, Mr.
  Samara, represent a broken party; yet a party which has yielded everything
  except hope. We do not desire to begin our acquaintance under the shadow of
  any false pretence. Prince Nicholas of Imanoff here, we acknowledge as the
  hereditary ruler of Russia. We cannot recognise any other government."</p>

  <p>Samara bowed his head.</p>

  <p>"You have every right to your convictions," he admitted. "If I believed
  that it was for the good of Russia to enter once more a period of Tzardom, I
  should myself immediately accept the monarchical doctrine. But I tell you
  frankly that I do not believe it. I am a Russian by birth and descent and I
  think that I have earned the right to call myself a patriot. I have
  worked&mdash;I still work&mdash;for my country's good as I see it. That is
  why, with a clear conscience, I have accepted this invitation to come and
  visit you."</p>

  <p>"Our friend speaks well," the General declared, looking around him. "After
  all, we must not forgot that he has accomplished a great deed. He has freed
  Russia from the Bolshevists, he has destroyed Soviet rule. If the form of
  government which he has set up does not wholly appeal to us, it is still a
  million times better than the one which he has crushed."</p>

  <p>"That is common sense," Kirdorff agreed. "Yet it leaves us with this
  reflection. Bolshevism and Soviet rule were impossibilities. From that
  hateful extreme we expected the pendulum to swing back to the conditions of
  our desire. Samara here has intervened. He has intervened&mdash;happily,
  perhaps, for Russia&mdash; but disastrously for us. While he lives our cause
  will languish."</p>

  <p>There was a tense silence. The significance of those words "while he
  lives" seemed to make itself felt everywhere. Samara looked around with a
  faint smile upon his lips&mdash;a smile about which there was already a
  shadow of defiance. It was a strange scene: the eager faces of the little
  crowd gathered round the table, the wonderful room with its great spaces and
  unexpected flashes of almost barbaric magnificence, the lavish hospitality
  displayed upon the huge sideboard, Mr. and Mrs. Saxon J. Bossington, almost
  grotesque in their position of host and hostess, seated in the background,
  waiting.</p>

  <p>"A true accusation," Samara admitted. "But after all I can honestly assure
  you that I, who know the temper of the country personally better than you can
  by the offices of correspondents, have seen few indications of a desire on
  the part of the people to submit themselves once more to the domination of a
  monarchy. I had no idea until a few hours ago that I was to have the honour
  of meeting you this evening&mdash;you, Prince Nicholas, or you, General,
  whose name is still remembered in Russia, or you, Colonel, or your Royal
  Highness. Let me say this to you, if I may. The Bolshevist days and the days
  of insane hatreds are over. Russia is a free country&mdash;as free to you as
  to me. Why not come back and live in it?"</p>

  <p>"Come back!" the General groaned. "My estates&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My mines!" Kirdorff muttered.</p>

  <p>"They took from me five hundred thousand English pounds," Alexandrina
  sighed wearily.</p>

  <p>"I will be frank with you all," Samara continued. "There is a new code of
  laws in Russia to-day. We are prospering to an amazing extent, but we have
  taken upon our shoulders an immense burden. The Russia of to-day desires to
  pay the debts of the past. If I alone had power, I would add to those debts
  the sums and estates of which the Bolshevists deprived you. But in that
  desire I am almost alone. I spoke of it and my own people listened in
  silence. But I believe&mdash;I believe from the bottom of my heart&mdash;that
  the day will come when Russia will repay you every farthing which you have
  lost."</p>

  <p>"If one could dream of such a thing!" the General faltered.</p>

  <p>"My mines are being worked by a Japanese Company," Kirdorff sighed.</p>

  <p>"There will be difficulties," Samara admitted, "but we shall overcome
  them. In the meantime, why live in exile? Russia is your country. Russia is
  open to you. I am not afraid to invite you all freely and whole-heartedly to
  return; the sentence of banishment against absentee Monarchists, I promise
  you, shall be revoked. I am not afraid of your influence. If Russia, at any
  time, should want a monarchy, let her have it. I will buy a villa in the
  south of France, be myself an exile, and grow roses. I am but the servant of
  the will of the people."</p>

  <p>"Rienzi said that before he climbed over their shoulders into power,"
  Kirdorff reminded him, with a curious flash in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Rienzi was a man of more ambitious temperament than I," Samara retorted.
  "Besides, his scheme of government in those days was less wide-flung. He was
  a dreamer as well as an idealist; I am a practical man. I desire what is good
  for Russia, and it is certainly not for her good that any of those who might
  be foremost amongst her citizens are living in exile. General, return to
  Russia, and an Army Corps or a post at the War Office is yours. You, Colonel
  Kirdorff, shall have a division whenever you choose to apply for it. There is
  not one of you who shall be deprived of the opportunity of doing useful work
  for your country. Why sit here and weave impossible dreams? Why not attune
  your patriotism to the music of real labour?"</p>

  <p>"What about me?" Nicholas asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>Samara reflected for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Prince," he confided, "I will be frank with you. We are living too near
  the shadow of regrettable days. Come if you will and be sure of my
  protection, so far as it goes. You shall have a commission in the army, but
  an Imanoff, in Russia, even to-day, must take his chance."</p>

  <p>Nicholas nodded. Catherine, who had moved round to his side, looked across
  at Samara.</p>

  <p>"Remember this," she insisted. "If the tide of feeling should flow, at any
  time, towards the re-establishment of Russia's real ruler, it is upon
  Nicholas here that the people's choice must fall."</p>

  <p>Samara listened indifferently. Perhaps in that hour of his magnificent and
  superabundant vitality, when his brain was at its zenith, his vision
  unerring, the idea of any serious rivalry between himself and this pale-faced
  young man of peevish expression seemed an incredible thing.</p>

  <p>"All I can say is," he replied, "that if Prince Nicholas cares to come, he
  is welcome. Such protection as I can afford him he shall have. If he plots
  against my Government and his plots are discovered, he will be shot. If, by
  open election of the people or by vote of the Duma, a monarchy is desired,
  then I shall never lift a hand against him."</p>

  <p>The General stroked his grey imperial. Something of the weariness had gone
  from his face. Something of the languor, indeed, seemed to have passed from
  each one of them. They had listened to a wonderful message. Samara read their
  thoughts. He rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I thank you, General, and all of you for your reception. I fear that in
  the past you have counted me an enemy. Wipe that out, please. The greatest of
  possible ties binds us together&mdash;our country!"</p>

  <p>He bowed low and moved away. Mrs. Bossington arose from her chair and came
  bustling towards him.</p>

  <p>"Now, my dear Mr. Samara," she exclaimed, "I am sure all this talking must
  have tired you. What it's been about neither Saxon nor I have the slightest
  idea, for on an occasion like this we make it a rule to keep ourselves to
  ourselves. One thing, however, I insist upon, you must take a little
  refreshment before you go."</p>

  <p>Samara suffered himself to be piloted by his hostess to the sideboard, ate
  p&acirc;t&eacute; sandwiches and drank champagne. Presently they were joined
  by her husband, who was curious about the oil-producing centres of Southern
  Russia. From the table behind came a drone of subdued but eager voices.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch8"
     id="ch8">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Miss Sadie Loyes set down the telephone receiver upon the
  instrument with a little bang. She was obviously annoyed.</p>

  <p>"Miss Borans," she announced sharply, "eleven hundred and eighty wants you
  again. Keep a record of your time."</p>

  <p>Catherine rose to her feet and placed the cover on her machine. Miss Loyes
  watched her with critical eyes.</p>

  <p>"Crazy about you seemingly," she continued. "They're making such a fuss
  about him in the papers this morning, I thought I'd go up myself for an hour
  or so. Knows his own mind, anyhow&mdash;you or nobody. What kind of work is
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Not work you'd enjoy very much, I think, Miss Loyes," Catherine replied,
  smiling faintly as she thought of the previous morning, "correspondence and
  documents and that sort of thing. Yesterday afternoon Mr. Bromley Pride
  interviewed him for the <i>New York Comet.</i> He didn't get much of a story,
  though."</p>

  <p>"These foreigners leave me cold," the manageress declared. "What we
  Americans make such a fuss about them for I don't know. They just come over
  here for what they can get. One of the papers this morning said that this Mr.
  Samara has fixed up a loan with the President of something like two hundred
  millions. Keep your time carefully, Miss Borans. There's one thing about
  these Russians, they aren't mean!"</p>

  <p>Catherine descended the stairs into the hall and made leisurely progress
  towards the lift. On the way the fancy seized her to call in at the florist's
  shop and buy a single dark red rose which she pulled through the waistband of
  her dress. The elevator man, who had scarcely noticed her before, watched her
  disappearing figure with undisguised admiration.</p>

  <p>"She sure is some girl, that!" he remarked to one of the messenger boys,
  as he stepped back into the elevator.</p>

  <p>The young lady seated behind the desk at the entrance to the corridor
  wished her good morning with a faint air of surprise. She called to her
  associate at the other end of the place and motioned after Catherine.</p>

  <p>"Did you see that pale-faced ninny from the typing room, all dolled out,
  this morning?" she demanded. "She's got a beau all right. I never noticed
  that she was so stylish."</p>

  <p>It was a very different sitting-room which Catherine presently entered.
  There were half-a-dozen men present and conversation was a little vehement.
  At her entrance it subsided. Samara motioned her to a chair at the smaller
  table and proceeded to dismiss his callers.</p>

  <p>"I agree," he said. "It seems cowardly, but perhaps you are right. At one
  o'clock Carloss, and at three o'clock the bank president. Louden can make all
  the arrangements. He had better bring an automobile here and cable
  Cherbourg."</p>

  <p>They drifted away, one by one, Samara himself escorting them through the
  little hall to the door. Presently he returned and threw himself into an
  easy- chair.</p>

  <p>"Trouble at home, here, and everywhere," he remarked grimly. "I've got to
  hurry home."</p>

  <p>"About your demilitarisation scheme?" she inquired.</p>

  <p>"Half the unrest is owing to German influence," he answered with a nod.
  "We've had so many commitments to her in the past that she's grown to look
  upon these armies as her own. Our people over here are quite right, though. I
  must get back at once and make a tour through the military district. In the
  meantime, I am going to cable over a proclamation. Ready?"</p>

  <p>"Quite," she answered.</p>

  <p>He dictated rapidly for half an hour or more. As soon as he had finished
  he went to a cupboard in which was an array of bottles, mixed himself a drink
  and tossed it off. Then he sat in his easy-chair with his hands in his
  pockets and a frown upon his forehead, while she gathered up the loose pages
  of her work.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," he asked abruptly, "what did your friends think of me last
  night?"</p>

  <p>"They were surprised," she admitted.</p>

  <p>"Favourably or unfavourably?"</p>

  <p>"On the whole, favourably. Your offer to them all has made a great stir in
  their quiet lives."</p>

  <p>"It was a serious one," he declared, rising to his feet and pacing the
  room. "There is no reason why they shouldn't come back. I have nothing
  against the Monarchists so long as they accept the situation and desist from
  plots. The people against whom I wage war to the death are the anarchists.
  They are a waning force, but I have not done with them yet. I am a humane
  man, but I would kill an anarchist as I would a fly, because of the poison
  they carry with them."</p>

  <p>She looked at him thoughtfully, but she made no remark. Presently he
  stopped in front of her chair.</p>

  <p>"Don't you agree with me&mdash;I mean about your people?" he demanded.
  "Don't you think I was right to ask them to come back? They are, after all,
  Russian citizens."</p>

  <p>"I think you are right," she replied, "with one exception."</p>

  <p>"One exception!" he repeated.</p>

  <p>"Nicholas Imanoff. If you allow him to return, I don't think I should have
  him in the army. You know what the Russian peasant soldier is. Communism is a
  meaningless cry to him, although he may shout for it if he is bidden. God and
  the Tzar are still in his blood."</p>

  <p>"You are giving me advice against your own people!" he exclaimed
  suddenly.</p>

  <p>The faintest tinge of colour stole for a moment under the creamy pallor of
  her cheeks. The same idea had flashed in upon her.</p>

  <p>"I am tired of plots and rebellions," she exclaimed. "Changes of
  government should be worked out by the will of the people. If the people call
  for a Tzar&mdash;well, there is Nicholas. But if he is once in the army,
  there will be plots. It isn't for our own good. I should like to see the
  monarchy re- established, but I should like to see it re-established by
  orthodox means."</p>

  <p>"You tell me that Alexandrina of Kossas is your patroness," he said. "Does
  that mean that you, too, are an aristocrat?"</p>

  <p>"By inclination," she confessed. "You must remember that it is not only
  the aristocracy who would support monarchy. I am one of those who consider it
  the sanest form of government. Would you like me to do anything with this
  proclamation?"</p>

  <p>He took the sheets from her and glanced them through, made a few
  alterations in pencil, and laid them down again. Afterwards he resumed his
  restless perambulation of the room. She leaned back in her chair and waited.
  Samara was evidently disturbed. Occasionally he muttered to himself. Once he
  stood for quite five minutes gazing out of the window, down into the windy,
  sunlit streets.</p>

  <p>"I am sailing this afternoon, Miss Borans," he announced, suddenly turning
  around. "My people are all emphatic and they are right. There is danger here
  and trouble to face at home."</p>

  <p>She did not attempt to conceal her interest.</p>

  <p>"I read your interview in the <i>New York Comet</i> this morning," she
  said, "but after all it told us very little. As the General was saying last
  night, you are still outside the Pact of Nations. You can demobilise the
  whole of these first million men and still remain, on paper at any rate, the
  greatest military power in Europe."</p>

  <p>"I could," he assented. "But that is not my intention. I want my Russian
  people back on the land instead of behind the guns, and I'm going to have
  them there. That's all I can say. Later on I have a scheme of my own for a
  citizen army&mdash;the only sort of army any country ought to have. Miss
  Borans, will you go back to Russia with me?"</p>

  <p>"Will I do <i>what?"</i> she asked, looking at him intently.</p>

  <p>"Precisely what I have asked," he persisted. "What relatives have you
  here?"</p>

  <p>"A sort of aunt," she replied, "and a second cousin."</p>

  <p>"Good! You work now for the management of this hotel. Work for me instead.
  I need a secretary like you. If your friends accept my offer, you'll have
  company over there. You won't clash with Andrew. He has his own line of
  work."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I could not work for you, Mr. Samara," she said.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" he demanded roughly. "You are a Russian patriot. So am I."</p>

  <p>"Our ideas of patriotism might not be the same," she pointed out. "If
  there were a movement in favour of the re-establishment of the monarchy in
  Russia, for instance, I should join it."</p>

  <p>"Join it and welcome," he answered. "I'm not at all sure that you would,
  though, if you were on the spot. Russia to-day is leaping onward towards
  prosperity. I can prove that to you. What do you want a monarchy back for?
  Not for the sake of the Russian people. They'd be no better off. Who are you
  for, Miss Borans&mdash;the people or one particular class?"</p>

  <p>"That one particular class is a section of the people," she reminded
  him.</p>

  <p>"An infinitesimal one," he scoffed. "Majorities count. You must work for
  the good of the greatest number."</p>

  <p>"All the same," she said, "I am not disposed to be your secretary."</p>

  <p>His face darkened almost into a scowl.</p>

  <p>"Don't be absurd!" he protested angrily. "It's a good offer. You can name
  your own salary in reason. You would be able to live in your native country
  instead of being an exile."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"It is an impossibility," she assured him.</p>

  <p>He glared at her for a moment furiously. Then, without further reference
  to it, he abandoned the subject.</p>

  <p>"Take down these letters," he directed. "Take copies, but be sure you give
  them to me."</p>

  <p>"I am quite ready," she murmured.</p>

  <p>He dictated for an hour. When he had finished, he read the letters she
  handed him with almost meticulous care, signed them and watched her as she
  placed them in their envelopes. Then he took the copies, looked them through
  and locked them up in a despatch-box.</p>

  <p>"How is Mr. Andrew Kroupki this morning?" she inquired.</p>

  <p>"Better," he answered shortly. "He will not be able to travel with me,
  though. It is most annoying."</p>

  <p>She glanced at the clock.</p>

  <p>"What time does your boat sail?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Eight o'clock," he told her, "but I am going on board at six. It seems
  that although the police released our friend of yesterday morning, a hint or
  two of what he was after got about. I'm practically being smuggled out of the
  country."</p>

  <p>"You have appointments at one o'clock and three," she reminded him. "Is
  there anything more that I can do for you, before I leave?"</p>

  <p>"There is only one thing you could do for me, and you won't do it," he
  growled. "I'm not a woman's man and I never learned how to talk to them, but
  you're the sort of human being it does one good to work with. I believe in
  you. You could help me."</p>

  <p>"There are many others who could do that," she assured him.</p>

  <p>"I don't meet them," he answered. "My biographers have written a lot of
  nonsense about me. Because I have swept clean the roads of life and driven
  the masses along the appointed way, they talk about my magnetism, my intense
  sympathy with human beings. It's all rubbish! I have no sympathy. Men and
  women are mostly puppets to me and life is a chess-board. If I could find
  someone who would teach me tolerance, someone whom I could trust, for whom I
  could feel human things, I could accomplish greater deeds than I have ever
  accomplished yet. There are times when I am frightened of my own materialism.
  I have thought all my life universally, in composite blocks. The world is
  becoming like a doll's house to me. I have a fancy that you might be able to
  change this. Will you come and try?"</p>

  <p>Again she shook her head. "It is an impossibility," she repeated.</p>

  <p>"That ends it, then!" he pronounced abruptly. "Tell your people to send an
  account for the typing into the hotel. The Embassy are arranging to pay my
  bill after my departure. All the evening papers are announcing that I leave
  on Saturday. You will perhaps consider what I have told you concerning my
  movements as confidential."</p>

  <p>"I will remember," she promised.</p>

  <p>She rose to her feet. He glowered across the room at her.</p>

  <p>"Some day," he concluded, "you may see that you've wasted a great
  opportunity. No woman ever had a greater. You've read of me and my work, but
  you don't know. When I crushed Bolshevism, the heart and soul of Russia began
  to beat again. The work's only begun. You and your little monarchist plots!
  Why don't you lift your head and see the greater things? You could help."</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry," she sighed, as she turned away.</p>

  <p>He heard the door close. Then he crossed the room towards the cupboard. .
  . . Help in his task from any human being seemed to be the one thing in life
  always denied him.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch9"
     id="ch9">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">They were all gone at last. Samara was alone in his
  capacious stateroom with a single companion&mdash;Bromley Pride, the <i>bona
  fide</i> representative of the <i>New York Comet.</i> Samara listened to the
  receding footsteps with a frown. Outside was turmoil. The bugle had just
  sounded the last call for departing visitors.</p>

  <p>"This sort of thing," he declared, "would soon drive me mad."</p>

  <p>Bromley Pride smiled tolerantly. He was a largely made, athletic-looking
  man, clean-shaven and forcible. In New York he was considered to be an
  authority on Russian affairs.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid these last two hours have seemed rather like an ante-
  climax," he observed. "All the same, I am convinced that precautions were
  necessary. The Chief of the Police sent for me himself this morning and
  begged me, if I had any influence with you, to persuade you to leave the
  country without delay. There are all sorts of rumours about."</p>

  <p>"They warned me in Washington," Samara acknowledged gloomily, "and of
  course there was yesterday's little affair."</p>

  <p>"Yesterday's little affair," Bromley Pride repeated with emphasis, "was
  only the beginning. I honestly believe," he went on, "that the Germans, over
  here at any rate, look upon the proposed demobilisation of your armies as an
  act of absolute treachery to them. You don't read the New York papers, I
  suppose, but the German-owned ones have passionate articles this morning,
  denouncing your visit here and attacking your whole policy. Whatever one can
  find to say against the Germans they are not cowards. Five years ago you were
  a little god in Germany. To-day you have about forty million enemies."</p>

  <p>Samara nodded with darkening expression.</p>

  <p>"You're right, of course, Pride," he admitted, "but my progress from the
  Hotel Weltmore to the boat was more like the passage of one of those hated
  plutocrats of old through the dangerous part of his capital than the
  departure of one who has brought freedom to a great country, from the city
  which has canonised that particular quality. Twenty plainclothes policemen
  walking along the customs shed and me in the middle! A sickening sight!"</p>

  <p>"If it had been Saturday instead of to-day," Pride observed, "the chances
  are ten to one you'd have had a bomb in the midst of the lot of you."</p>

  <p>There was the sound of cheering, a sense of gliding motion, the screaming
  and panting of tugs. Samara drew a breath of relief.</p>

  <p>"Well, thank God we're off," he exclaimed. "Can I go on deck now and get a
  breath of fresh air?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet," the other begged. "Two detectives from police headquarters are
  going through the passenger list with the purser now. As soon as they send me
  word down 'O.K.' you can do what you like. You must remember that you haven't
  told me much yet, sir. I'm not only a New York journalist, you know&mdash;I'm
  a friend of Russia."</p>

  <p>"My mission was a success," Samara declared. "That's all there is to be
  said about it. My task lies ahead. Forty years ago, Russia&mdash;the best
  part of Russia&mdash;was trying to drill the military spirit into Russian
  peasants. To- day I have got to knock it out. The Bolshevists were wise
  people in their generation. They kept a great army going without the
  slightest difficulty. The soldiers were fed whilst the peasants starved. Who
  wanted to work on the land, without enough to keep body and soul together,
  when there was good food and wine and beer in the army? They're an obstinate
  race, our peasants, you know, Pride. I've got the capital now to make them
  productive units of the nation, at work in the factories and fields, and to
  pay them good money. It's quite another matter to make them see that it's for
  their benefit, though. That is where the difficulty may come in."</p>

  <p>"You'll do it in the end," Pride prophesied hopefully. "You've achieved
  greater impossibilities."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I shall do it," Samara assented. "I shall do it if I can keep
  intrigue out of the Duma and the Press and the Army. I shall do it if I'm
  given a fair show."</p>

  <p>Pride was gazing out of the porthole at the passing panorama of docks and
  walls.</p>

  <p>"One would pray for you, Samara, if one knew how or to whom. There's a
  soul in your work&mdash;something that reaches out of life&mdash;out of the
  mud of politics and man's ambition. The Jews are the only ones left who
  really pray. I rather wish you were a Jew, Samara."</p>

  <p>"You think that I need faith."</p>

  <p>"It isn't that, but you need an inexhaustible stock," was the quiet reply.
  "You have no one to depend upon but yourself. Russia has not produced a
  single great statesman yet to stand by your side. You carry on your shoulders
  a burden so enormous that it makes the hearts of us who watch grow faint. How
  must it be for yourself?"</p>

  <p>Samara was looking into space. They were moving more rapidly
  now&mdash;moving all the time away from New York.</p>

  <p>"I am forty-four years old, Pride," he confided. "I came into this fight
  when I was nineteen. I have never looked back. I have never relaxed or felt
  fear, but there has been one moment, and that not so long ago, when I almost
  weakened&mdash;if it is weakening to crave for help. I thought I saw
  something wonderful. It was just the mirage."</p>

  <p>There was a knock at the door. A detective entered. He smiled the smile of
  a man who has accomplished good work.</p>

  <p>"Everything 'O.K.' now, sir," he declared. "Mike's got 'em&mdash;one from
  Chicago, one from Washington. They've got the bracelets on and the guns are
  in Mike's pocket. They had a stateroom nearly opposite to you, too, sir," he
  added, turning to Samara.</p>

  <p>"You think they were really after me?" the latter asked.</p>

  <p>The detective laughed confidently.</p>

  <p>"They were after someone on board, sir, and they had a plan of your
  stateroom. Not a paper between them, and scarcely any luggage. One's a
  Russian&mdash; a red-hot Bolshevist still, they say, whom we've had under
  observation for years. The other's a German. They won't trouble you any more,
  sir. As for the rest of the passengers, I think they're all right. The
  stewards and the crew, of course, we can't vouch for."</p>

  <p>"Should I be running any grave risk," Samara inquired, "if I invited you
  to visit the smoke-room with me?"</p>

  <p>The detective accepted the idea with enthusiasm, but ventured upon an
  amendment.</p>

  <p>"I'd try that bell, sir, instead," he suggested, "and a word to the
  steward."</p>

  <p>At last came the clanging of a bell which, this time, brought them to a
  dead stop. Samara watched his visitors depart; Pride, with his cheerful
  carriage and buoyant air; the two detectives with their quarry; finally the
  pilot into his little rowboat on the other side.</p>

  <p>The great semicircle of lights had flashed out through the windy twilight.
  The freshness of the sea was a marvellous tonic after the spring lassitude of
  the town and the overheated rooms. Samara strode the deck with a sense of
  reawakening life in his veins. These croakers had gone. He was his own man
  again, free to muse upon his great achievement, to revel in the exhilaration
  of the voyage. Behind him lay New York&mdash;and what else? It was an
  absurdity, but he was heavy-hearted.</p>

  <p>The clamorous dinner bugle left him undisturbed. His anticipations of the
  coming night, the long roll of the ship, the scent of the sea, and the wind
  upon his face elated him. And then, in the midst of his long, swinging walk,
  he came to a sudden standstill. A woman was leaning over the rail. He had
  passed her several times without notice. Now, something in her figure, the
  poise of her head, startled him with a flood of ridiculous memories. She
  turned and faced him. For once in his life, he, the man of many words, was
  speechless.</p>

  <p>"You see, I changed my mind," she said, with a quiet smile. "I wish you'd
  go and see the purser about my stateroom." . . .</p>

  <p>They dined together half an hour later at the little table in a secluded
  corner of the saloon which Samara had bespoken for himself. Catherine was
  very frank.</p>

  <p>"It has been the dream of my life to visit my own country," she confided,
  "but all the same I had not the faintest idea of accepting your offer. When I
  got downstairs after leaving you, I found Kirdorff waiting for me. You may
  not realise it, but Colonel Kirdorff is a great schemer."</p>

  <p>"You are to spy upon me!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I rather think that is the idea," she assented. "You little know what you
  have brought upon yourself by your candour last night. They are all planning
  to return&mdash;even Nicholas. When I told Kirdorff of your offer, he thought
  that I should be mad to decline it. You mustn't be angry with them, Mr.
  Samara. They are getting old and the idea of intrigue stirs them as nothing
  else in life could. They are not to be ignored, but they are scarcely to be
  feared."</p>

  <p>"And you?" he asked. "Are you going to spy upon me?"</p>

  <p>"I may," she admitted. "I shall make you no promise. I want to see what
  you have made Russia. I want to travel about there and to talk to those
  people who understand. Maybe you will convert me. If you do not, I shall give
  you fair warning. In the meantime I hope you will find me plenty of work and
  pay me enough money to buy some clothes directly we land. These dear friends
  of mine hurried me off with little more than a handbag."</p>

  <p>"How is it that you are so intimate with all these people?" he inquired.
  "You are one of them, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Don't ask me," she begged. "Let me remain a mystery. I am a working girl
  and I am going to be a very good secretary. Isn't that enough? Tell me, do
  you live in a palace at Moscow and what will become of me there?"</p>

  <p>"I live in a portion of the old palace," he replied. "We call it now
  Government House. You can have your quarters there, or look after yourself
  outside, whichever you like. Then you can also have an office in Government
  Buildings where Andrew does most of his work."</p>

  <p>"It sounds delightful!" she declared. "We are impulsive people, you and I!
  You haven't had any references about me, and as for you&mdash;well, I know
  that you are Gabriel Samara and that is all. I don't even know whether you
  are married."</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"I think you do," he said. "In case I am wrong, I will tell you. I am
  unmarried and I have no women friends. As to references, I asked none from
  you; you must place a similar trust in me."</p>

  <p>She returned his smile understandingly.</p>

  <p>"I think," she confided, "that I have made up my mind to do that."</p>

  <p>Catherine went to her stateroom early, and Samara, after a brief visit to
  the smoking-room, struggled out on to the rain-splashed deck. They were
  facing the Atlantic now, with a gale blowing, driving the spray in blinding
  sheets across the ship. He found a comparatively sheltered place where the
  thunder of the wind was heard rather than felt, and where he could watch the
  flecks of foam leap into the dazzling light and pass away into the black gulf
  beyond. He was on his way back, his mission accomplished; the second part of
  the great struggle of his life begun. There was never a time when he needed
  clearer vision, a more detached and concentrated grasp upon the great
  realities. Courage he had in plenty, even to rashness; his will no one had
  ever questioned; yet in the midst of his content he was troubled with a queer
  sense of some indeterminate quality in his thoughts, some disposition to find
  less vitally important the great issues of life. His mental balance had been
  disturbed. Another element had entered into the background of his sensations
  beside the joy of achievement. He filled his pipe and smoked savagely,
  staggered down the deck and took a stiff drink at the bar, came out again and
  crawled even farther towards the bows, until the music of the wind was in his
  ears like the crack of thunder, and the hiss of the sea, as the waves were
  parted by the mighty bow of the ship, seemed like an unearthly scream. There
  were stars shining here and there through a filmy lacing of clouds; a promise
  of the moon from behind the jagged pieces of black cloud, these latter so low
  down that it seemed as though the tall mast rising from the top of the sea
  was almost stabbing into their bosom. Gusts of rain swept into his face. The
  seamen who passed him were wrapped in oilskins and silent. The singing in his
  pulses continued, the exhilaration of spirit, which he tried in vain to
  believe came from the knowledge that this journey of his, towards which the
  eyes of the world had been directed, had met with a success which he alone
  had prophesied.</p>

  <p>And all the time he knew that there was something else&mdash;another
  problem to be faced; a personal self creeping into life, demanding, nay,
  insisting upon recognition. It was all fancy, he told himself, born of the
  winds and the stars and the romance of travel. He suddenly realised upon what
  a trifle the whole great machinery of his mind had been engaged.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was not until the middle of the next morning that Gabriel
  Samara appeared on deck. A long line of semi-somnolent passengers watched him
  with interest; Catherine, who was sipping some beef-tea, looked up
  expectantly. He did not, however, pause in his promenade, but touched his hat
  slightly and passed on, his hands thrust into the pockets of his greatcoat,
  his underlip a little protruding, a general air of unapproachability about
  him. If there were not actually newspaper men on board, there were men
  connected with newspapers, and they looked at him wistfully&mdash;even
  followed him at a respectful distance along the deck, seeking an opportunity
  to venture upon a friendly word. They were, however, doomed to
  disappointment. Samara, after a restless night, had no desire for the
  amenities of life. He climbed to the higher deck where few people were
  disposed to face the wind, and, assured of a certain measure of solitude
  there, he leaned against the rail, looking down into the steerage. Again, as
  on the previous night, he felt the scrutiny of a little company of
  white-faced, black-eyed shadows of men, with skulking movements and general
  air of furtiveness. One of them he watched in particular, with something more
  than ordinary curiosity. The man looked over his shoulder twice and, although
  his expression was entirely passive, there was recognition in those stealthy
  glances. Soon he disappeared behind a ventilator, and Samara, after a few
  minutes' hesitation, recommenced his promenade. This time, however, it was
  speedily interrupted. The First Officer, who was descending from the bridge,
  caught sight of him and waited for his approach at the bottom of the
  steps.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Samara," he said, saluting, "may I have a word with you?"</p>

  <p>Samara nodded.</p>

  <p>"Certainly."</p>

  <p>"We are very pleased and proud, of course, to have you as a passenger,
  sir," the officer went on, "but I wish very much you had followed the example
  of some other over-popular statesmen who travel with us, and done so
  incognito."</p>

  <p>"My friends arranged my passage," Samara explained. "I came on board, as
  you know, quite unexpectedly."</p>

  <p>"Just so," the other assented. "That would have been all right if they had
  used a little more discretion. The trouble of it is that we have at least a
  score of your country people in the steerage&mdash;red-hot Bolshevists, every
  one of them&mdash;who came out here and haven't been allowed to land. They've
  been at Ellis Island for some time and now we've orders to take them back to
  Naples."</p>

  <p>"I think I've recognised one or two of them," Samara remarked drily.</p>

  <p>"We are taking every precaution," the officer continued. "Not one of them
  will be allowed to land until after you have left the ship and we have
  stationed a guard at each of the communicating passages leading from the
  steerage aft. I'd have a care if I were you, Mr. Samara, and particularly,
  I'd lock both my doors at night. Yours is rather an exposed suite."</p>

  <p>"I am very much obliged for the warning," Samara said. "I don't think that
  my attitude towards life is exactly that of a fatalist, but so far as regards
  these repeated attempts upon my person, I have grown just a little callous,
  I'm afraid. Or perhaps it is that I have faith."</p>

  <p>"It's a fine thing to have," the other observed gravely, "but some of the
  greatest men in the world have been struck down by the most utter miscreants.
  We will do our best to take care of you, sir."</p>

  <p>"I am sure you will," was the slightly more cordial reply.</p>

  <p>The morning wore on. Some of the ship's passengers indulged in sports.
  Down in the steerage a man who called himself a Hungarian, but who had been
  christened "Simon the Jew," was doing tricks with knives, to the amazement of
  a little group of spectators. He pinned a piece of paper on the wall and from
  twenty paces he threw short-bladed, ugly-looking knives into a perfect
  circle. He threw them into the air and caught them by the handles, three or
  four at the same time, the sun shining upon the blue steel of their blades.
  Some of the women turned away. Even the men&mdash;and they were used to
  knives&mdash;shivered a little. The man was a magician.</p>

  <p>Back on the promenade deck, Catherine was conscious of a vague sense of
  annoyance. Samara had not been near her all the morning. Once or twice, as
  she passed along the deck, she had seen him sitting in a corner of the
  smoking-room- -smoking a pipe and reading. It was not until after the bugle
  had sounded for luncheon that she met him in the companion-way.</p>

  <p>"I thought," she said, a little coldly, "that I was supposed to be here as
  your secretary."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"No work this morning," he declared.</p>

  <p>"I had no intention of coming," she continued, "simply for a sea voyage.
  May I ask whether there will be work to do this afternoon?"</p>

  <p>The gruffness passed from his manner. He looked at her abstractedly. She
  was wearing a long jumper of a distinctive shade of green, a cap of the same
  colour, and the wind had brought a wholesome touch of pink to her cheeks. Her
  tone was almost severe, but her lips were already framing for a smile.</p>

  <p>"There is a despatch," he announced, "which I wish to prepare for
  forwarding to London. We will commence it at three o'clock, if that suits
  you."</p>

  <p>"It suits me very well indeed," she assured him.</p>

  <p>They separated without further speech. A few minutes later, as he sat at
  his corner table from which the other chair had already been removed, he saw
  her coming towards him. This time there was a distinct frown upon her
  face.</p>

  <p>"I understand," she said, "that you have told the second steward to give
  me a place somewhere else."</p>

  <p>"I thought it would be more agreeable to you," he replied.</p>

  <p>"You were entirely wrong," she confided. "I shall sit with you or take my
  meals on deck."</p>

  <p>He rose at once to his feet and summoned a steward.</p>

  <p>"Kindly relay this table," he directed. "Mademoiselle will share it with
  me."</p>

  <p>She seated herself and looked at him severely.</p>

  <p>"Why do you desire to dispense with my society after having made use of so
  much eloquence to obtain it?" she inquired. "I can assure you that I am a
  very desirable companion. I can be silent. I can be an eager listener&mdash;
  especially if you talk of Russia&mdash;or I can talk nonsense. You have only
  to name your humour, and I can respond to it. But I will not sit with that
  noisy crowd of fat, curious women, and their male belongings."</p>

  <p>"You are very welcome here," he conceded, trying to conceal his own
  satisfaction. "The arrangement I proposed was largely for your sake. I
  thought that you would like to make acquaintances on board."</p>

  <p>She drew herself up and looked at him with a smile, half amused, half
  haughty.</p>

  <p>"Why? Acquaintances?"</p>

  <p>His retort was prompt.</p>

  <p>"As a young lady typist from the Bureau of the Weltmore Hotel, taking her
  first ocean trip," he began&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The trick is to you," she interrupted. "I don't like the sarcasm, though.
  Are you sure that you still believe in me, Mr. Samara?"</p>

  <p>"Ought I to?" he retorted unexpectedly.</p>

  <p>"We will waive the question," she decided, after a moment's
  deliberation.</p>

  <p>The second steward came up to pay his respects and to suggest special
  dishes for dinner that night or luncheon on the morrow. The wine followed
  with news of some old brandy for which Samara had inquired, and his place in
  turn was taken by the First Officer, who paused for a moment or two on his
  way out.</p>

  <p>"I trust, Mr. Samara," he said, "that you are keeping the matter in mind
  about which I spoke to you this morning."</p>

  <p>"It is scarcely a matter which slips easily from one's memory," was the
  somewhat grim reply.</p>

  <p>"What was he talking about?" Catherine asked, glancing curiously after the
  retreating figure.</p>

  <p>"A gang of Bolshevists on board, being returned to their native country
  with thanks. They hate me like poison, of course, every one of them."</p>

  <p>She looked troubled.</p>

  <p>"I am sure I saw some of them," she confided, "when I was looking over
  into the steerage this morning. Even though they are my own country people, I
  thought they were horrible."</p>

  <p>"There's nothing to fear from such cattle," he said shortly. "You'll have
  to get used to believing that I am immune from that sort of thing, if you
  work for me. You have had a dose of it already. As for these fellows, they
  are no good without organisation. They may hate me like poison, but there
  isn't one of them would have the courage to risk his own life by trying to
  get rid of me for the sake of his fellows. The Bolshevist hasn't altruism
  enough for that."</p>

  <p>After luncheon they parted for a time, and at three o'clock, preceded by a
  steward carrying her typewriter, Catherine presented herself in the little
  sitting-room attached to Samara's suite. He was already there, talking to
  Ivan, or rather the latter was talking and Samara was listening. Ivan had
  apparently worked himself into a state almost of passion. The words came from
  his lips in a little stream; his fists were clenched. His master pushed him
  out of the room with a few soothing words.</p>

  <p>"Ivan's been down in the steerage," he explained, turning to Catherine
  with a smile. "Been running amuck with some of the scum there, I expect. He
  thinks that they'd do me a mischief if they could. So would a hundred
  thousand more of them, but they don't get the chance."</p>

  <p>"I have not quite made up my mind about you yet," she said, as she seated
  herself at the table. "One thing I am quite sure about, though; I do not wish
  you to be assassinated whilst I am around, or indeed until I am convinced
  that your work for Russia is over. So far as you have gone, I look upon you
  as the greatest Russian benefactor we have ever had. If only you would
  complete the work!"</p>

  <p>"Restore the monarchy?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Some day we will argue the matter," he promised. "Now take down the text
  of my communication to the English Cabinet."</p>

  <p>They worked for several hours, Catherine fascinated by the substance of
  what she wrote, the directness and lucidity with which Samara expressed
  himself. Sometimes he was at a loss for a word and at her suggestion he
  supplied her with a Russian one. They drifted now and then into the habit of
  exchanging remarks in that tongue.</p>

  <p>"It seems odd to think that you have never actually been in your own
  country since you were old enough to remember!" he said abruptly.</p>

  <p>"I spent three very strenuous years there, according to my mother," she
  confided. "My impressions are naturally a little mixed."</p>

  <p>He returned to work and dismissed her only when the bugle sounded an hour
  before dinner. Afterwards he walked outside for a few minutes alone. It was
  already dusk, quieter than on the previous night, but still with a long swell
  and half a gale blowing on the windward side of the ship. He paced the almost
  deserted deck once or twice thoughtfully. A whistle sounded from the bridge.
  Presently the boatswain came up to him and saluted.</p>

  <p>"The Captain's compliments, sir, and would you speak to him for a moment
  in his room?"</p>

  <p>Samara followed the man on to the covered deck and into the Captain's
  quarters. The latter, who had been changing for dinner, came out of his
  room.</p>

  <p>"You will take a cocktail with me, Mr. Samara?" he invited.</p>

  <p>"With pleasure."</p>

  <p>In a moment there was the sound of the ice clinking in the shaker, and the
  Captain's steward appeared with two frosted glasses full of amber liquid.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't think us a lot of old women, Mr. Samara," the Captain begged,
  as he pushed the cigarettes across, "but I tell you frankly that we're rather
  nervous about you. We've got a rotten steerage on board, and I'm going to ask
  you not to walk these decks after dusk. If you care to come up on the bridge
  while the weather is in any way decent and clear, I shall be delighted.
  Plenty of exercise there, and all the wind you could want in the world."</p>

  <p>Samara smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>"I have to stick it out in Moscow, you know, and a good many other places
  which I visit in my own country," he reminded his companion.</p>

  <p>"Precisely," the Captain agreed, "but permit me to point out a very vital
  difference. In your own country, for one man who would raise his hand against
  you there are a million to whom you are something like a god, and any
  would-be assassin would have to face the fact that he would probably be torn
  to pieces in a matter of seconds. On board this ship it is a very different
  affair. My First Officer tells me that we've got a score or more of the worst
  of your country people on board, who honestly believe in an ignorant way that
  they've got a grudge against you. It excites them to think that you are so
  near. They feel that they have a chance of getting at you they wouldn't have
  on land. I'm one of your great admirers, Mr. Samara, but there's a selfish
  side to this, too. I should hate anything to happen on my ship."</p>

  <p>"I'll take every care," Samara promised. "Give me a cocktail like that now
  and then, and I'd almost promise to hide in my stateroom!"</p>

  <p>The Captain smiled as he divided the remainder.</p>

  <p>"It will take a load off our minds if you'll promise to be careful," he
  said. "We watch those fellows day and night, but they're as slippery as eels.
  Even now my boatswain tells me there's one of them he can't account for."</p>

  <p>"Have they any firearms?"</p>

  <p>"Not now. We've taken seven revolvers away from them&mdash;not a bad haul
  for less than a score. In one respect they are not as bad as the
  Dagos&mdash;they haven't all a knife up their sleeves."</p>

  <p>Samara was escorted back to his quarters by the boatswain. Ivan, who was
  busy brushing his clothes, was still disturbed and anxious.</p>

  <p>"I do not like this ship," he declared, as he shook out his master's coat.
  "There are evil men upon it."</p>

  <p>"Turn on my bath, Ivan. Even evil men without arms in their hands can do
  no more than think evil thoughts," his master reminded him. "What in hell's
  name is that?"</p>

  <p>There was a strange fugitive glimpse of a white face pressed against the
  large, square window which took the place of a porthole; a face which slowly
  appeared from underneath the frosted lower part and came into sight
  gradually&mdash; a mass of black matted hair, sunken eyes, sunken cheeks, an
  expression scarcely human. Samara sprang forward, but Ivan held him back with
  all his giant strength. He pushed his master on one side and hastened to the
  door.</p>

  <p>"It is for me, this, Master," he cried.</p>

  <p>He was out on the deck in an instant. Samara snatched up a pistol from the
  drawer of his writing desk and followed him. There was not a creature in
  sight. He looked up and down. Ivan crept underneath the boats. The place
  appeared to be deserted. Samara, with a shrug of his shoulders, returned to
  his stateroom. Ivan stood still on the deck; a giant figure, his long hair
  blowing about in the wind, the muscles of his right arm taut, rage in his
  heart.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Catherine had just finished a morning's work which even she
  found severe. She leaned back in her chair with a little sigh of exhaustion.
  Her fingers were stiff, her arms numb, there was a slight dizziness at the
  back of her head. Outside, too, as though to tantalise her the more, the wind
  had gone down and the great liner was ploughing its level way through a blue
  sea as smooth as a carpet and bespangled with sunlight. Samara, with the
  inspiration of his last few sentences still in his brain, was like a man
  removed altogether from the world. He, too, was looking through that
  wide-flung porthole, but with the air of one who seeks something beyond the
  swelling sea and the narrow boundaries of the blue horizon. Catherine,
  watching him with curious eyes, forgot for a moment her fatigue. He had
  indeed the air of a prophet. There was no follower of the cause which lay
  next to her own heart like this, she reflected sorrowfully. With a momentary
  pang she thought of Nicholas and that little circle back in New York, even
  now making their plans. The recollection failed altogether to exhilarate
  her.</p>

  <p>The sound of the luncheon bugle brought their feet back to the ground.
  Samara turned swiftly around. For the first time that morning, as it seemed
  to Catherine, he looked at her as though she were a human being.</p>

  <p>"You are tired," he exclaimed, "of course you are tired! I have worked you
  for three hours without a pause. Ivan!"</p>

  <p>The man appeared, silently for all his bulk, and without a moment's delay.
  His master gave him a rapid order in Russian.</p>

  <p>"If I am tired, it is a pleasure to feel so," she assured him. "I feel
  mentally as you feel physically when you return from a long day's hunting.
  Only, if you will give me an hour's rest after luncheon, I shall sleep in the
  sunshine."</p>

  <p>"I shall not work again to-day," he declared. "I've got rid of much that
  was in my mind. These thoughts collect in their little cells. One must bring
  them into shape or sometimes they slip away."</p>

  <p>Ivan returned with two glasses full of frosted liquid on a tray. Catherine
  took one gratefully. Samara tossed his off at a draught.</p>

  <p>"Come out into the sunshine for ten minutes before lunch," he invited.</p>

  <p>She finished her <i>ap&eacute;ritif</i> and followed him willingly enough
  on to the deck. They walked up and down once or twice. Then Catherine sank
  into her steamer chair and, after a moment's hesitation, he seated himself by
  her side.</p>

  <p>"One scarcely needs exercise," she murmured. "The sun and this air are so
  wonderful and the decks are crowded. Besides, I hate walking. Tell me, Mr.
  Samara, if you will&mdash;you write openly enough of the second stage in your
  great struggle for the regeneration of Russia. What is it?"</p>

  <p>"Can't you imagine?" he answered, a little gloomily. "The escape from our
  obligations, written and unwritten, to Germany."</p>

  <p>"Germany!"</p>

  <p>She repeated the word. The full understanding of his announcement evaded
  her.</p>

  <p>"Don't you see," he pointed out, "in the early days of Bolshevist
  Government, Germany obtained almost a stranglehold upon Russia. The best of
  her industries were seized upon and worked by Germans. These profiteers made
  piles of money, but instead of investing it to develop Russia's resources,
  they kept it for themselves, to spend in their own country when they had
  sucked the thing dry. German capital was used freely enough but not for
  Russia's ultimate good. The fortunes made went abroad. Russian resources,
  Russian cheap labour, were merely the cat's-paw of German capitalists. The
  same thing in a different manner applied to our armies. It is quite true that
  German officers and German efficiency have made us a military power far in
  advance of our requirements, but for what purpose were those armies to be
  used, do you suppose? Not for Russia's benefit. That is why&mdash;"</p>

  <p>It was precisely at that moment that an incredible and amazing thing
  happened&mdash;seen first, to Samara's preservation, by Catherine. Scarcely
  fifteen feet from them was hung a boat, covered by a tight canvas covering.
  There was hardly a breath of wind, and yet Catherine's attention had been
  attracted by the inexplicable movement of one of the knotted ends of rope
  which tied it down; an end which disappeared underneath the canvas as though
  drawn there by invisible fingers. There was a sudden gap in the folds of the
  canvas itself, and swiftly following, black tragedy, pregnant with fate; the
  instantaneous reappearance of that horrible face, first seen by Samara
  through the window of his cabin, and now more than ever like some diabolical
  jack-in-the-box, the top part of a body, collarless, clad in a grey flannel
  shirt only, a long skinny arm, gripping in its yellow fingers something that
  gleamed like silver in the sunlight.</p>

  <p>It was an affair of seconds. Catherine never knew the instinct which
  prompted her. She caught hold of Samara by the neck and dragged his face
  against hers. Even as she did so something flashed across those fifteen feet
  of space like a silver thunderbolt; something that hissed in the air and
  buried itself in the woodwork where Samara's head had been&mdash;buried
  itself almost to the hilt, and stayed there quivering. There were people
  walking both ways. They paused in amazement. Samara felt the fiery grip of
  Catherine's fingers released. He sprang to his feet, just as the misshapen
  little figure leaped out from the gap in the boat, jumped on to the deck and
  turned towards the steerage. Samara, large and loose-limbed though he was,
  was no less nimble. One long leap&mdash;and the man was in his grasp. It was
  like a rat in the grip of a well-conditioned sporting dog. Afterwards, it
  seemed to Catherine, sitting there numbed and motionless, that these things
  could scarcely have happened. A matter of seconds saw the beginning and end
  of an episode which might have changed the world's history. Samara, shaking
  with a great anger, held his miserable captive high over his head, shouted
  one word to him&mdash;a Russian word, harsh and uncouth it
  sounded&mdash;strode to the rail, held him for a moment poised, in full sight
  of half-a-hundred shivering and paralysed passengers, and flung him out into
  the sunlight, far away from the ship's side, into the soft blue bosom of the
  sea. Even people who had not seen, heard the splash and ran to the side of
  the boat. Samara leaned with the others over the rails. He became suddenly a
  spectator. Behind him, embedded three inches deep in the woodwork, the knife
  was still quivering, the sunshine reflected from it like gleams of
  lightning.</p>

  <p>Pandemonium followed, but pandemonium through which ran a thread of order.
  There was the clanging of the gong from the Captain's bridge, the sudden
  shock of reversed engines, a boat in the sea almost before people realised
  its lowering&mdash;a boat which seemed to be left far behind as the liner
  drifted on with her own momentum. A hundred glasses watched it. A hoarse
  murmur ran all down the line of anxious passengers. Samara felt a hand, as
  cold as ice, clutch his. Catherine was standing by his side.</p>

  <p>"Have they picked him up?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"These fellows have the lives of cats," he observed resignedly. "I quite
  thought that I had broken his neck when I threw him over."</p>

  <p>A little crowd had gathered round the sinister-looking knife; others
  watched the return of the boat with the half-drowned man. In the background
  people gazed with awe and wonder at Samara&mdash;a man who had escaped death
  by a miracle, and the taking of life by a second one. He was momentarily
  engaged in tying a handkerchief round his right hand from which a few drops
  of blood were falling.</p>

  <p>"The fellow tried to bite me when I got hold of his neck," he explained.
  "I shall go and see the doctor. Any one who touches this carrion needs
  disinfectants."</p>

  <p>People made way for him right and left. The sight of that amazing
  retaliation of his had imbued him with a grotesque, yet heroic, air. It was
  like a deed from a book of the Sagas. Then into that blazing atmosphere of
  tragedy there intervened a readjusting note. With puffed-out cheeks and
  earnest manner, a pallid young man produced from a shining bugle the call for
  luncheon. Untoward and unexpected events are coldly looked upon on board
  ship. Routine and discipline are paramount. When Samara returned from the
  doctor's room with his hand neatly bandaged, he found most of the passengers,
  including Catherine, already seated at luncheon.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The knife thrower brooded, so far as his narrow mind allowed
  him, in irons, for the remainder of the voyage, without even the solace of a
  word from his cowed companions. Samara, with Catherine always at hand to
  help, worked for several hours each morning, preparing a detailed report of
  his proceedings in New York. The other passengers loafed and flirted their
  time away, very much in the usual fashion. Three uneventful days brought
  peace of mind to the Captain and to the First Officer.</p>

  <p>"Am I a good secretary?" Catherine asked one evening at the completion of
  a long day's work.</p>

  <p>"The best I ever had," he admitted promptly. "I am not so sure, after all,
  that we shall be able to work together for very long."</p>

  <p>Her eyebrows were slightly raised.</p>

  <p>"It should not be for you to say that," she protested. "If I am useful
  here, why should not I be equally so in Moscow? Andrew Kroupki, you tell me,
  will not be able to leave New York for more than a month."</p>

  <p>"That is true."</p>

  <p>"There is some one else in Moscow, perhaps?" she persisted.</p>

  <p>"There is no one else," he assured her. "I have never had a woman
  secretary."</p>

  <p>"Some one in your household would object to my presence?"</p>

  <p>He frowned irritably.</p>

  <p>"There is no woman whatever in my household," he said, "except an old
  housekeeper who was my nurse when I was a boy. It is not that. The bald truth
  is that you are not the sort of secretary for a man like myself."</p>

  <p>"Because of our political lack of sympathy?" she asked. "I can't help
  being a Monarchist, but as against that you have done Russia a magnificent
  service by freeing her from Bolshevism. I could never forget that."</p>

  <p>"It is not a matter of politics at all," he confessed. "Can't you realise
  that I dislike having women around me as women? I prefer to keep an unbiassed
  mind. Women belong to the arts and graces of life. They have no place in our
  serious moments and enterprises."</p>

  <p>She looked at him with gentle pity.</p>

  <p>"Dear Mr. Samara," she said, "it is terrible to hear a man of intelligence
  like yourself talk such absolute nonsense. You are looking out on life with
  one eye shut."</p>

  <p>"No great man was ever cumbered with womenkind," he declared. "Those who
  were, fell."</p>

  <p>"If you quote Mark Antony and Napoleon to me I shall shriek," she
  threatened. "I wish we were entirely of the same way of thinking in other
  matters. I would soon convert you as to this."</p>

  <p>"You should accept my obduracy as a compliment," he said. "If association
  with you had not its effect upon me I should automatically forget your
  sex."</p>

  <p>"I should never let you," she assured him.</p>

  <p>They were promenading the deck together. It was during the hour before
  dinner, and they climbed to the boat deck and walked on the windward side to
  avoid the crowd. Here they were almost alone.</p>

  <p>"My mind this afternoon," Catherine confided, "has, in intervals of work,
  been engrossed by thoughts of my own future. When do we reach Monte
  Carlo?"</p>

  <p>"Next Thursday," he replied.</p>

  <p>"How long do we stay there?" she inquired.</p>

  <p>"At least a week," he answered. "One of my ministers is coming from Moscow
  to meet me, and there will be an emissary from a foreign country waiting for
  me."</p>

  <p>"And after that?"</p>

  <p>"We shall go to Moscow <i>via</i> Naples and Budapest. As far as you are
  concerned, when we arrive there, you will naturally be your own mistress. I
  hope, however, that you will continue to help me, at any rate until Andrew
  returns. I do not like to speak of money in connection with such services as
  you have rendered me, but I shall of course see that financially you are
  unembarrassed."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," she said. "In any case I quite intend to come to Moscow with
  you."</p>

  <p>He was silent, for a cause which, had she known it, would have flattered
  her.</p>

  <p>"When you asked me to come with you, and I, by the way, refused," she
  continued, "I knew nothing about Monte Carlo. I took it for granted that I
  should be taken direct to Moscow."</p>

  <p>"You are disappointed?"</p>

  <p>"Not I," she laughed. "What girl in the world would be disappointed at the
  chance of seeing Monte Carlo for the first time in her life! All the same, I
  am looking forward very much indeed to returning to my own country. Thanks to
  you, my friends are coming. The Grand Duchess has offered me a home, and I
  have no doubt that Nicholas would give me a post as his secretary if I asked
  him. Tzars have to have secretaries, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"Nicholas Imanoff will never be Tzar," he told her grimly. "I haven't
  saved Russia from the Bolshevists to hand it back to one of his breed."</p>

  <p>"Really," she murmured. "Well, Nicholas quite thinks he is going to be.
  He'd look rather wonderful, wouldn't he, in white uniform and a crown?"</p>

  <p>"For an exceedingly sensible young woman you talk a lot of nonsense," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"When I'm in the mood," she confided, "no one can stop me. Still, if you
  don't press me to remain with you after we get to Moscow, I shall always
  believe that it is because you are afraid of me."</p>

  <p>"You will be quite right," he confessed. "I am already."</p>

  <p>She laughed softly and turned to the Captain whom they had just
  encountered.</p>

  <p>"Such a confession, Captain!" she exclaimed. "Mr. Samara here, who fears
  no cut-throat, laughs at bullets, and despises bombs, is afraid of poor
  me."</p>

  <p>"I do not wonder," was the prompt reply. "It is his peace of mind which is
  in danger."</p>

  <p>"It may be that," she reflected. "It is at any rate a flattering
  thought."</p>

  <p>"What are we to do with your Russian lunatic?" the Captain inquired,
  turning to Samara.</p>

  <p>The latter shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"What do I care? Keep him in irons until I have left the ship, and then,
  whatever you will. You'd much better have left him where I sent him."</p>

  <p>The Captain smiled.</p>

  <p>"Sometimes," he admitted, "I think that the ways of a few hundred years
  ago were the better."</p>

  <p>He passed on, and Samara and his companion continued their walk.</p>

  <p>"I have quite made up my mind as to my future," Catherine declared. "I
  wish to come to Moscow with you, to find apartments in the city pending the
  arrival of my friends, and to continue my work as your secretary&mdash;your
  junior secretary, of course&mdash;until that unfortunate young man in New
  York recovers. I am deeply interested in your outlook. I think there are
  certain aspects of the life and evolution of my country which you understand
  better than any living person. Don't send me away from you, please, Mr.
  Samara. Remember that you are entirely responsible for my coming."</p>

  <p>"Why the devil shouldn't I?" he demanded with sudden harshness. "You'll
  leave me as soon as you've learnt all you want to learn. You haven't come at
  all in the spirit in which I appealed to you to come. You patronise my
  outlook. In your heart you despise it."</p>

  <p>She contrived to keep by his side without loss of dignity, although he had
  turned abruptly around and was making for the steps.</p>

  <p>"You are very severe all of a sudden," she complained. "Where are you off
  to in this tremendous haste?"</p>

  <p>"To the smoking-room to drink cocktails," he growled. "Beware of me at
  dinner-time. I may have a few home truths to tell you."</p>

  <p>"I shall come with you," she declared. "I need sustenance myself. I wish I
  did not look so strong. Then you would perhaps be more sympathetic. And as
  regards those cocktails you are a very fraudulent person. Nothing that you
  ever drink makes the slightest difference to you."</p>

  <p>He laughed hardly.</p>

  <p>"You are quite right," he admitted. "It doesn't. Still there are times
  when I like the fire in my veins, even when it leads nowhere. Come if you
  wish to, by all means."</p>

  <p>They sat at a corner table in the smoking-room, the object, as usual, of a
  great deal of attention, although few people at any time ventured upon more
  than a respectful salute. When she had finished her <i>ap&eacute;ritif,</i>
  Catherine rose.</p>

  <p>"Go and change now, please," she begged. "I feel that our conversation at
  dinner-time may be interesting, and I don't want you to sit here and drink
  more cocktails and be half an hour late."</p>

  <p>He rose to his feet, but only to let her pass. For a few minutes after she
  had gone, he remained silent. To the bartender, who paused before him in
  expectation of a further order, he only shook his head. He told himself that
  a certain minor crisis in his life was arising, and that he must meet it with
  a cool brain. He had been conscious of its near approach ever since he had
  found it more easy to remember the cling of Catherine's arm around his neck
  than the hiss of the knife with its sickening little stab, from which she had
  saved him. Even now there was a strange and unfamiliar sensation of pleasure
  as he recalled the clasp of her fingers, the touch of her cheek against his.
  Folly for any man. Lunacy for him!</p>

  <p>Yet, at its very outset the spontaneity of their dinner conversation was
  ruined by an untoward and ugly episode. The second steward bore down upon
  them almost as soon as they had taken their places, whilst Samara was still
  stroking the green-eyed cat, who came to his chair every evening. He was
  carrying a silver tureen which he set down upon the table.</p>

  <p>"Our under-<i>chef</i>," he confided, "has sent you some Russian Bortsch
  soup, with some cream sauce. He was in service once with a Russian family at
  Nice, and learnt something of their cooking."</p>

  <p>"Very good, if it is really Bortsch," Catherine remarked. "Am I to have a
  little?"</p>

  <p>The steward smiled reassuringly.</p>

  <p>"The <i>chef</i> has prepared plenty, madam," he said, as he served it. "I
  was specially to recommend the sauce."</p>

  <p>Samara poured some of the latter a little absently into his plate and held
  it towards the cat.</p>

  <p>"You'll never get rid of him if you give him cream, sir," the man
  observed, as he turned away.</p>

  <p>Samara held out his hand towards Catherine, who was about to commence her
  dinner.</p>

  <p>"Wait," he insisted, "just one moment."</p>

  <p>She saw the horror creep into his face, and leaned over. The cat lay on
  its side. Already its eyes were half closed and its limbs were stiffening.
  The second steward, who had been talking at a table close at hand, came
  hurrying back.</p>

  <p>"Why, what's wrong with the cat, sir?" he exclaimed. "Seems as though he
  was going to have a fit."</p>

  <p>"It is your <i>chef's</i> specially prepared dish that is the matter with
  the cat," Samara said drily. "You had better take the rest of it to the
  doctor."</p>

  <p>The man's face was white with horror.</p>

  <p>"Just a moment, sir," he begged. "I've got to get down to the kitchens
  first. I wonder whether you'd mind coming with me?"</p>

  <p>Samara rose and followed him. Two of the stewards carried out the cat. The
  chief steward himself came and removed the dishes from the table. There was a
  babel of conversation. No one knew exactly what had happened.</p>

  <p>There was a certain drama in the little scene below, although Samara
  himself was chiefly conscious of a sense of bitter anger. The under<i>-
  chef</i>, in his soiled white clothes and white cap, stood with folded arms,
  leaning against the wall in the doctor's little consulting-room. The doctor
  was present, also the second steward and the Captain. The latter wasted
  little time upon the matter.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said to the young man, "you declare that there was nothing
  harmful in the soup or the sauce you sent up for Mr. Samara."</p>

  <p>"It was made as I have always made it," was the sullen reply. "As for the
  cat, he has fits. It was that and nothing else."</p>

  <p>"Very well," the Captain continued. "There is the sauce upon the table.
  Doctor, I dare say you can find a wine-glass. You shall drink a wine-glassful
  and we will believe you."</p>

  <p>Something of the <i>chefs</i> bravado left him. He watched the sauce
  poured into a medicine-glass which the doctor held out towards him. He took
  it into his hands and hesitated for a moment. Then he dashed it on to the
  floor.</p>

  <p>"I will not drink it," he declared. "You cannot force me to."</p>

  <p>The Captain nodded to a sailor who had been waiting close at hand.</p>

  <p>"Put him in irons at once," he ordered.</p>

  <p>The man made a sudden spring for the door, but the steward caught him by
  the collar and swung him round. He stood shivering, helpless, but with a look
  of hate in his eyes. He glared at Samara and the desire to kill was mingled
  with the hate.</p>

  <p>"I may fail and others may fail," he cried, "but some day, someone will
  succeed!"</p>

  <p>Samara's anger seemed to have passed. He looked at his would-be assassin
  curiously.</p>

  <p>"You are a Russian?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," was the sullen reply.</p>

  <p>"Why should you try to kill me&mdash;you and these others you speak of? I
  have worked hard for Russia."</p>

  <p>The man spat upon the floor.</p>

  <p>"You have worked hard for yourself," he snarled. "You are an autocrat,
  worse than any Tzar who ever ruled at Peterhof! You're a tyrant, an enemy of
  Soviet Government. That is why we hate you. You stand for the personal; I,
  and all real Russian patriots, for the Republic!"</p>

  <p>They led him away. There was a look almost of sadness in Samara's eyes as
  he turned to leave the cabin. The man was obviously one of an ignorant band
  of anarchists, ill-educated, filled with poisonous doctrines. Yet a gleam of
  truth sometimes flashed out from unexpected places.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Catherine, a morning or so later, leaned over the white rail
  of the boat deck and watched the blue fire playing about the wires
  overhead.</p>

  <p>"These Marconi people must bless you, Mr. Samara," she observed.</p>

  <p>"I think they are more disposed to curse me," he answered. "They've had
  very little rest for the last twenty-four hours."</p>

  <p>She looked at him meditatively. He was, without a doubt, notwithstanding a
  certain uncouthness and an ungraceful stoop of his broad shoulders, a fine
  figure of a man. The touch of sunburn acquired during the last few days
  became him. She approved of the few grey hairs by his ears, the inflexible
  mouth, his eyes so full of colour.</p>

  <p>"I never thought I should like a man with blue eyes," she said
  irrelevantly.</p>

  <p>"Do you like me?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"What a question! Why else should I be here, putting myself, as one of
  these dear old ladies said the other morning, 'in a most difficult
  position&mdash; private secretary to, and travelling alone, with an unmarried
  man?' They don't know what a tower of strength you are, do they?"</p>

  <p>"I hope," he answered gruffly, "that they have sense enough to realise
  that I have something else to think about these days besides playing the
  gallant."</p>

  <p>"One loses one's sense of proportion out here at sea," she ruminated. "I
  am inclined sometimes to forget that you are a very important person. This
  sort of thing reminds me," she added, pointing to the wires overhead. "How
  many messages have you received to-day?"</p>

  <p>"I have not counted," he answered. "The last one from England is the most
  important. For the first time I am inclined to regret that this is not a
  Southampton boat. I think that I must go to London."</p>

  <p>"Delightful!" she murmured. "I can't believe that it compares with New
  York, but I should like to see it."</p>

  <p>"You probably will, then," he assured her. "The Prime Minister has invited
  me to visit him before I return to Moscow."</p>

  <p>"If I were Andrew Kroupki," she remarked suggestively, "you would go a
  little further and tell me just what he wants to discuss with you."</p>

  <p>"There is no reason why you should not know," he observed, after a
  moment's hesitation. "Your own common-sense can very likely visualise the
  situation. Naturally what I am doing is of immense interest to England. For
  the last fifteen years the Russian armies have been the greatest menace to
  peace in Europe. I have realised that myself, although I have been powerless
  to act. The rumoured demobilisation of even a portion of them is an event of
  the utmost importance to England and France."</p>

  <p>"I quite understand that," Catherine declared, "but tell me, are any of
  those messages from Berlin?"</p>

  <p>A smile parted his lips, a smile which she was beginning to look for and
  appreciate. It was like the grin of a boy who sees mischief ahead. He pointed
  to the blue fires which were still snapping away above them.</p>

  <p>"Hell!" he confided. "Hell and every kind of fury!"</p>

  <p>"What fun!" she murmured. "When do we face the storm?"</p>

  <p>"The first breath of it in Monte Carlo," he replied. "Von Hartsen is
  meeting me there, and I don't think he's exactly carrying the olive
  branch."</p>

  <p>A messenger from the Marconi office brought Samara still another despatch.
  He tore open the envelope and read it carefully.</p>

  <p>"From the War Office at Moscow," he remarked. "They're deluged with
  inquiries from Berlin. I must send them a short reply."</p>

  <p>He strolled away and climbed the steps into the Marconi room. Catherine
  descended to the lower deck and made her way to her chair. She had scarcely
  seated herself before she became aware of a new neighbour on her left-hand
  side- -a middle-aged man with dark beard and moustaches, wearing
  tortoise-shell rimmed spectacles and a travelling cap with long flaps. At her
  approach, he laid down the book he had been reading and glanced cautiously
  around.</p>

  <p>"I have been looking for an opportunity of a word with you, Miss Borans,"
  he said, speaking with a thick guttural accent. "It is very difficult to find
  you alone."</p>

  <p>"Who are you and what do you want?" she asked coldly.</p>

  <p>"My name is Lorenzheim," he told her. "Karl Lorenzheim. I am a friend.
  Look at this, please."</p>

  <p>He handed her a crumpled-up visiting-card of Kirdorff's. On the back was a
  line scrawled in pencil:</p>

  <p>"Lorenzheim is a friend. You can treat him with confidence."</p>

  <p>"So you know Colonel Kirdorff," she remarked.</p>

  <p>"I am a member of the Club of which he is secretary," her new acquaintance
  confided. "He is a Russian and I am a German, but we are friends. He desired
  me to make myself known to you when a safe opportunity occurred."</p>

  <p>"You are very mysterious," she observed. "What do you mean by a 'safe
  opportunity?'"</p>

  <p>"When Mr. Samara is not around," was the significant reply.</p>

  <p>She twisted the card which he had given her in her fingers and returned it
  to him.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Samara is on the upper deck attending to some Marconigrams," she
  said. "He will be back directly."</p>

  <p>"Marconigrams, eh!" Mr. Lorenzheim repeated. "You see
  them&mdash;what?"</p>

  <p>"I know what some of them are about," she assented.</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"You are very cautious," he declared. "I do not blame you, but you can
  trust me. Mr. Samara," he went on, "is a very great man, but he is a great
  man for his own people&mdash;not for yours or mine."</p>

  <p>"I know nothing about his relations with your country," she said. "So far
  as regards my own friends he has treated them with great generosity."</p>

  <p>"Generosity!" Mr. Lorenzheim scoffed. "What is this you say? Generosity,
  indeed! There is Nicholas Imanoff, who should to-day be ruler of Russia,
  selling bonds in New York. Who rules the country in his stead? Samara! Oh,
  you all say he's a great man because he drove out the Bolshevists. I tell you
  that the Bolshevists committed suicide with their follies and excesses. If
  Samara had not dealt them their death-blow, Russia would have reverted to a
  monarchy fifteen years ago."</p>

  <p>"That may be," she replied. "I still say that Samara has acted generously
  in summoning my friends back to Russia."</p>

  <p>Mr. Lorenzheim took off his spectacles and polished them.</p>

  <p>"We must not quarrel, you and I," he said tolerantly. "You call it
  'generosity.' I call it 'folly.' Never mind! I have been looking for you to
  ask you a question. What you tell me is as though you told it to Kirdorff
  himself. We want to know whether Samara has any idea of tampering with the
  Second Army, and whether his messages from Moscow have spoken of any
  disaffection amongst the soldiers themselves."</p>

  <p>Catherine moved a little uneasily in her chair. She was suddenly conscious
  of a sense of immense repugnance to this intruder, to his message and all its
  suggestions. It was with almost a feeling of horror that she realised how
  entirely it was taken for granted that she was occupying her present position
  under false pretences, that she was in reality a spy upon the man for whom
  she was supposed to be working. Her tone when she spoke lacked all
  enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing definite at present which I can impart to you," she
  declared.</p>

  <p>He turned and looked at her through his bespectacled eyes.</p>

  <p>"You do not doubt my credentials?" he asked. "Kirdorff has known me for
  many years."</p>

  <p>"It has not occurred to me to doubt anything that you have said," she
  replied. "I am not used, however, to have my new occupation taken so much for
  granted."</p>

  <p>"Occupation?" he repeated, mystified.</p>

  <p>"As a spy."</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Those who toil for great causes," he said, "must stoop sometimes to
  displeasing methods. Pardon if I return to my book. We speak again together.
  Mr. Samara approaches."</p>

  <p>Samara carried more despatches in his hand. He paused in front of
  Catherine's chair.</p>

  <p>"Come and walk with me," he invited a little abruptly. "I have something
  to say to you."</p>

  <p>She rose at once and he led the way to a sheltered corner aft where there
  were usually some empty chairs. He ensconced her in one and remained himself
  standing beside her.</p>

  <p>"We shall land in three days," he announced. "It is essential that after
  my meeting with Von Hartsen I should go at once to Moscow, or remain in Monte
  Carlo for a few days. There is, however, this invitation from the Prime
  Minister of England to be dealt with. Will you undertake a commission there
  for me?"</p>

  <p>They were nearing the Straits and she looked thoughtfully out across the
  sea to the bare, rocky coast of North Africa. Samara watched her with
  impatience.</p>

  <p>"I wonder whether you realise," she said at last, "that it is less than a
  fortnight since I came to your rooms from the Hotel Weltmore Typewriting
  Bureau to work for you?"</p>

  <p>"Twenty-seven hours less than a fortnight," he assented. "What of it?"</p>

  <p>"You have already entrusted me with a great many of your secrets," she
  reminded him, "and the little you know of me is not altogether, from your
  point of view, a recommendation. I belong, in fact, to a political party
  opposed to your views and your system of government. Don't you think that you
  are placing a little too much trust in me?"</p>

  <p>"I do not," he answered, "or I should not ask you to undertake this
  mission to London. You are a patriot and even though your sympathies are
  still engrossed in a romantic but hopelessly out-of-date cause, you admit
  that I have done a great work for Russia. Why should I not trust you? When I
  find you embroiled in a monarchist plot, it will be time enough for me to
  send you to a fortress."</p>

  <p>"Will you ever have the heart to do that?" she whispered, looking at him
  with a provocative gleam in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Heart!" he repeated gruffly. "I have no heart. If you betrayed my
  confidence, I should see that you had what you deserved."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless," she persisted, with a return to her more serious manner,
  "I think you are disposed to put too much trust in me."</p>

  <p>He looked down at her with the momentary irritation of an elder towards a
  child.</p>

  <p>"Neither a guarantee of secrecy," he declared, "nor absolute immunity from
  theft can ever be purchased or built up with bolts and bars. Trust,
  considered and calculated trust, is safety. To know where to bestow it is, I
  admit, a form of genius. If I seem to you flamboyantly trustful, it is your
  judgment that is wrong. I believe in your sense of honour and my own
  instinct. Kindly let that end the discussion."</p>

  <p>That night they were anchored in the Bay of Gibraltar, in the shadow of
  the great Rock ablaze with its thousand pin-pricks of fire. Samara was
  summoned from the dinner-table to receive a call from the Governor who had
  come aboard in his launch, and Catherine leaned for some time over the side
  of the ship, watching the little boats below with their wares of fruit and
  flowers and tinselly merchandise. Presently room was made at the foot of the
  gangway for the Governor's launch, and he and Samara stood for a moment or
  two at the top of the stairs, talking.</p>

  <p>Then the former took his leave and soon after Samara found his way to her
  side.</p>

  <p>"Come on the upper deck," he invited. "These people below are so
  noisy."</p>

  <p>She obeyed at once. They sat on one of the fixed seats with their back to
  the Fortress and as far removed as possible from the hubbub of the
  extemporised market. She asked him a question about the Governor.</p>

  <p>"A pleasant man and very friendly," he told her. "Naturally, as an old
  soldier, he was interested in the demobilisation of our armies. He was very
  anxious for me to go and spend the night at Government House."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you?" she asked idly.</p>

  <p>He made some casual answer, but his sudden realisation of the truth was a
  shock to him. A celebrated French traveller was staying there whom he was
  anxious to meet, and an English writer whose works had interested him, yet
  the desire not to leave the ship was paramount. He frowned as he looked
  meditatively across the Bay to the lights of Algeciras.</p>

  <p>"I shall go to London if you wish me to," she announced abruptly.</p>

  <p>"I imagined you would," he replied. "Your mission, of course, will be more
  personal than official, but at the same time I shall entrust you with a
  message to the Prime Minister which I do not care to send through our own
  representatives there. We have three days more to talk of that, though."</p>

  <p>"I wish it were longer," she confessed.</p>

  <p>"You do not regret having come, then?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I have never regretted it for an instant," she assured him. "All the
  same, to me this voyage seems to grow in unreality every day. I can't really
  believe that I have left New York behind, that we are here in European
  waters, and that I am working day by day with you. It doesn't seem part of my
  life&mdash; like something detached, something which might have happened, but
  didn't."</p>

  <p>She turned to catch a glimpse of an expression in his face which startled
  her. There had been moments lately when she had been almost terrified of
  him.</p>

  <p>"It has been an unusual experience for me," he admitted. "I have never
  worked with a woman before."</p>

  <p>She suddenly laughed. His way of alluding to their association appealed to
  her sense of humour as she thought of the long nights they had sat on deck,
  with the rushing of the wind around, the leaning stars and the long golden
  pathway to the moon; of their long talks and their long silences. More than
  once, tragedy, passing by, had lifted them out of the world of commonplace
  things and forced them into a position of more than ordinary intimacy. Was it
  his sense of honour, of guardianship, she wondered, which had kept him always
  so aloof, or was it that she herself made no appeal to him? She had remained
  all the time perfectly natural, had made no effort at any artificial reserve.
  Vaguely she found herself somewhat resenting his attitude. Many of the men on
  board had, in their own way, directly or indirectly, done their best to
  intimate the fact that they found her attractive. Samara had never once even
  looked at her as though he recognised the desirability which made other men
  hang round her chair and seek her company. An irresistible longing to evoke a
  more personal note in him assailed her.</p>

  <p>"You find it as easy to work with me as with a man?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I have never noticed the difference," he answered calmly. "You are very
  efficient."</p>

  <p>Her lips relaxed and she smiled at him.</p>

  <p>"I am a great deal nicer to look at than your other secretary," she said
  reflectively. "I do you more credit, too."</p>

  <p>"In what way?"</p>

  <p>"Poor Andrew Kroupki," she murmured. "He looks half-starved and very
  miserable. I, on the other hand, look well fed and content. No one would
  suspect you of ill-treating me."</p>

  <p>"One does not choose a secretary for his personal appearance," he
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"Some men do, I am afraid," she replied.</p>

  <p>He looked at her and she was not so sure of herself. In the darkness his
  face seemed more dominant than ever, his mouth almost cruel in its strength.
  Only his eyes were a little disturbing.</p>

  <p>"You don't imagine that that sort of thing would appeal to me?" he asked
  scornfully.</p>

  <p>"I wonder what does appeal to you," she sighed. "Evidently I don't."</p>

  <p>"How do you know that?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"How does a woman generally know?" she retorted.</p>

  <p>She had an indefinable sense of disaster&mdash;or triumph. She suddenly
  felt the clasp of his arm around her waist, the touch of his fingers upon her
  hair and cheek. She had not before doubted her ability to meet any situation
  which might arise, but in this moment of trial she failed utterly and
  helplessly. She was suddenly weak in all her limbs. She made not the
  slightest resistance to a thing which had never yet happened to her, which
  she had never, for a moment, contemplated. His eyes seemed like fires, but
  softer&mdash;softer every moment. The cruel lines of his mouth, too, seemed
  to have relaxed. His lips touched hers firmly, yet softly, lingered there
  whilst passion grew. She was almost swooning in his arms.</p>

  <p>He released her quite gently yet with a certain abruptness. He rose to his
  feet and stood looking down at her, massive, unemotional, yet with some
  subtle air of the conqueror. She returned his gaze, helpless, her hands
  gripping the back of her chair. Her lips were still quivering. It was not for
  her to know that a new light in her eyes had suddenly made her more beautiful
  than ever before.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Samara!" she gasped.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," he answered, "but I am also glad!"</p>

  <p>She heard his receding footsteps along the deck, saw him knock at the door
  of the Captain's quarters, enter and disappear. Below there was still the
  subdued hubbub of the hucksters. In a more distant boat a swarthy Spanish
  woman was singing a love-song to the music of a guitar.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">An Englishman seated upon a divan in one of the lofty rooms
  of the Salons Priv&eacute;s nudged on the arm his companion, newly arrived
  from England. He was by way of being showman and had been pointing out the
  notabilities of the place. "Do you see the fair young man moving round the
  table on the left?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Good-looking fellow with a scar on his face? Yes. Who is he?"</p>

  <p>"In his way a very interesting person," was the earnest reply. "That is
  Prince Frederick of Wehrenzollern. They say that he is the most popular young
  man in Germany."</p>

  <p>"I was reading about him only last week," the other observed. "One of the
  papers was saying that he had modelled himself entirely upon our present King
  when he was the same age&mdash;goes in for all sorts of sports and is always
  doing something thoroughly democratic."</p>

  <p>"If Germany is ever foolish enough to discard her republic, there goes the
  future Kaiser," his companion announced.</p>

  <p>The young man in question made a very slow progress through the rooms. He
  apparently met friends at every moment, with most of whom he stopped to talk,
  and although he seemed scarcely in the place for the purpose of gambling, he
  occasionally risked a twenty-franc piece at the tables. Presently he passed
  out of the ken of his two observers, and, having completed a tour of the
  rooms, as though in unsuccessful search of some one, collected his hat and
  cane in the cloakroom and strolled out. He was greeted everywhere with a
  great deal of attention, and he was obviously exceedingly careful to return
  all salutations. As soon as he was alone, however, a somewhat supercilious
  smile took the place of his apparent bonhomie, and he yawned once or twice on
  his way to the Sporting Club. Here he was again received with great
  consideration, and made his way up the stairs into the roulette rooms. An
  elderly man of exceedingly aristocratic appearance moved eagerly towards him
  from one of the little groups. Prince Frederick welcomed him with a sigh of
  satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"I have been looking everywhere for you, General," he declared. "Come and
  tell me the news."</p>

  <p>They moved off towards the bar.</p>

  <p>"There is no news," the older man replied. "He has not yet arrived."</p>

  <p>Prince Frederick seemed disappointed.</p>

  <p>"I thought the boat was due in yesterday," he observed.</p>

  <p>"It was due," the General assented, "but it has been delayed by bad
  weather. I am expecting to hear at any moment that it is in the bay."</p>

  <p>The two sat in a corner of the bar. In his own country the Prince always
  drank beer. Here, he called for a mixed vermouth. They spoke for a little
  time upon incidents connected with his journey. It seemed that he had only
  reached Monte Carlo that afternoon.</p>

  <p>"It is a relief," the General declared with a little sigh, "to be in a
  place like this, my dear Frederick, where you and I can meet and talk openly.
  Even though I was your tutor, people whisper in Berlin if we are seen much
  together, especially since I became a member of the Government. You have been
  as busy as usual, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>Prince Frederick yawned.</p>

  <p>"Last week," he confided, "I opened two flower shows, unveiled a statue,
  opened a tennis tournament and played in it myself, took the chair at the
  Flying Club dinner, and joined in the parade, visited a new fencing academy
  and fenced the first bout, and attended two commercial banquets. Not so bad,
  considering that I had to show up at the bank each day. Lucky no one knows
  how little work I really do there."</p>

  <p>"It is not necessary for you to do any at all. The directors are all our
  friends and members of our party."</p>

  <p>"All the same," the young man declared, sipping his vermouth, "it is a
  grind. That dear English relative of mine in whose footsteps Lam supposed to
  be treading, only had to pose as a democrat in sentiment&mdash;not to
  transform himself into a bank clerk. I hate the atmosphere of these places.
  The camp and the barracks are my home."</p>

  <p>His mentor smiled tolerantly.</p>

  <p>"You must remember, my dear Frederick," he said, "that until our day comes
  it is as well for you to keep your military instincts as far as possible in
  the background. The <i>bourgeoisie</i> would be shaking their heads and
  likening you to your respected great-grandfather if you gave them the
  opportunity. That side of it will come later. All that I pray is that I may
  live to see it."</p>

  <p>"All good Germans must pray for that," the Prince agreed, lighting a
  cigarette. "We have become giants of commerce during the last twenty years,
  simply because we are a great people and bound to succeed in anything we
  undertake, but at heart we are a military nation."</p>

  <p>The General looked at his pupil and smiled fondly.</p>

  <p>"It is in the blood," he murmured.</p>

  <p>"Tell me the latest news of this man Samara," the latter demanded a little
  abruptly.</p>

  <p>The General frowned.</p>

  <p>"It is very hard to speak of the matter coolly," he declared. "We Germans
  made Russia a military nation. We trained their men, we made their guns and
  flying machines, we taught and equipped them from conscript to general. We
  constructed a mighty engine of destruction ready for our use when the time
  came. It suited the old r&eacute;gime. The soldier was the only man who could
  be sure of regular food and comfortable living, and everyone wanted to be in
  the army. Now, under the new order, everything is changed. Industrially and
  agriculturally Russia is forging ahead, and now, without warning to anybody,
  Samara calmly announces to the world that he desires to reduce his army to
  the proportions suggested by the League of Nations, and insists that he needs
  the soldiers for industrial developments. His representative in Moscow told
  Baron Gusman plainly a few days ago that the Russian Government no longer
  recognised any military understanding with Germany."</p>

  <p>"What about our own Cabinet?" the Prince asked eagerly. "How do they take
  the matter?"</p>

  <p>"Their attitude," the General replied, "is, so far as it goes,
  satisfactory. I am here as a special envoy, instructed to formally protest
  against any further demobilisation of the Russian armies, to remind Samara of
  our previous agreements, and to demand an explanation of his present policy.
  Except for a handful of socialists, the motion in favour of my mission was
  carried unanimous."</p>

  <p>"They say Samara is a great autocrat," Prince Frederick reflected.
  "Supposing he takes high ground?"</p>

  <p>His companion was silent. He glanced around the room, and although they
  were in a retired spot, he dropped his voice.</p>

  <p>"Then he may bring the day of fulfilment nearer," he said. "Samara's hold
  upon the people is as yet unproved and propaganda amongst the army has
  already commenced."</p>

  <p>A young man who had been standing upon the threshold, as though in search
  of someone, suddenly recognised the General and advanced. He bowed
  respectfully to Prince Frederick and handed a despatch to the former.</p>

  <p>"A wireless from the American boat, sir," he announced. "She is in sight
  and expects to land her passengers within the hour."</p>

  <p>The General tore open the envelope and read its contents.</p>

  <p>"Samara will see me at six o'clock to-night at the H&ocirc;tel de Paris,"
  he announced. "Excellent!"</p>

  <p>"Then, by dinner-time to-night," the Prince began slowly&mdash;</p>

  <p>"By dinner-time to-night," the General interrupted, "I shall know what is
  at the back of Samara's mind. If he intends to play us false&mdash;well, it
  will mean a complete reversal of our present foreign policy. It may lead to
  even greater changes than that."</p>

  <p>A very beautiful and world-famous young woman looked in at the door and,
  recognising Prince Frederick, smiled at him. He rose at once to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I go to play baccarat with Mademoiselle," he announced. "We have an
  arrangement."</p>

  <p>His mentor-in-chief, laid a hand upon his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Amuse yourself," he said tolerantly, "but remember&mdash;these little
  escapades are as well kept secret. There are gossips amongst our newspaper
  men, and the Princess Freda is exacting in some matters."</p>

  <p>The young man smiled.</p>

  <p>"Even my sainted prototype," he remarked, as he turned away, "had a
  weakness for beautiful ladies."</p>

  <p>General von Hartsen played roulette for a time, took a stroll along the
  terrace, watching the great American steamer which had just arrived, and
  finally presented himself at the H&ocirc;tel de Paris at the appointed hour.
  Samara was engaged in the task of sorting his letters with Catherine's help.
  He received his visitor at once, however, shook hands with him and motioned
  him to a seat.</p>

  <p>"Is this a visit of courtesy, General?" he demanded, "or am I to consider
  it, in any sense of the word, official?"</p>

  <p>"Friendly, if you please, sir," was the slightly formal reply, "but also
  official. I am the bearer of representations from the Government in whose
  labours I have the honour to share, to the Chairman of the Council of the
  Russian Republic."</p>

  <p>Samara shrugged his shoulder and turned away from the letters. He had the
  air of one preparing to receive battle.</p>

  <p>"In that case, General," he begged, "pray proceed. I am entirely at your
  service."</p>

  <p>The latter glanced courteously but questioningly towards Catherine.</p>

  <p>"The young lady," he began&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Let me present you," Samara interrupted. "General von Hartsen&mdash;Miss
  Borans, my secretary."</p>

  <p>The General bowed low, but his expression was still a puzzled one. His
  eyes remained fixed upon Catherine.</p>

  <p>"Miss Borans," he repeated, "you will pardon me, I am sure, but I am under
  the impression that we must have met before."</p>

  <p>"I think not," Catherine replied, shaking her head slightly.</p>

  <p>"Unless you have ever been a visitor to the United States, it is
  improbable," Samara intervened. "Miss Borans has lived there all her
  life."</p>

  <p>"In that case I am doubtless deceived by a likeness," the General
  confessed. "You will forgive my adding, Mr. Samara, that our present
  conference must be a private one."</p>

  <p>"I have no secrets from my secretary," Samara insisted. "Miss Borans is
  discretion itself. She would in any case handle any report of our interview
  which I might have to submit to my Council."</p>

  <p>Von Hartsen bowed.</p>

  <p>"Very well, sir," he said, "I will proceed. I am directed by the ministers
  of the German Republic to ask you for full particulars concerning this
  proposed demobilisation of a portion of your armies, and further to inquire
  what change of policy such a step is meant to indicate. I think I need not be
  more explicit."</p>

  <p>"Not the slightest need of it," Samara acquiesced. "Pray sit down. Smoke a
  cigar if you will, and I'll tell you all about it. I'll tell you just what
  are my plans and hopes for the future of Russia, and, incidentally, at the
  risk of shocking you, you shall learn my exact views as to the establishment
  of what I term mercenary armies."</p>

  <p>The General's face grew a shade sterner. He put back the cigar which he
  had been in the act of clipping, and folded his arms.</p>

  <p>"I am at your service, sir," he announced.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The General listened with more or less patience to all that
  was in Samara's mind, and found the situation a great deal worse than he had
  expected. Towards the conclusion of their interview he became very angry
  indeed.</p>

  <p>"I consider that the course of action which you propose, Mr. Samara, is
  entirely at variance with your obligations towards my country," he
  announced.</p>

  <p>"I recognise no obligations towards your country," was the brusque reply.
  "I have from the beginning warned you that it was my intention at the
  earliest opportunity to rid myself of the great armies which my misguided
  predecessors, aided by you, have brought into being. To have done so would
  have been my first action on coming into power if it had been possible to
  have found the men employment. I have now made arrangements which will enable
  me to put half-a- million men on the land and half-a-million into industrial
  pursuits. Demobilisation of the Third Army will commence the day I return to
  Moscow."</p>

  <p>"And what about the First and Second?" the General demanded.</p>

  <p>"I shall follow suit with the Second almost at once," Samara answered. "I
  look upon a trained army as an incentive to militarism, and I don't intend to
  maintain one. Since you are here I may as well inform you that my Government
  will issue a proclamation before the end of next month, requiring all
  officers of German nationality to resign their commissions and leave the
  country. A certain bonus will be allotted to them, but that will be a matter
  of adjustment."</p>

  <p>General von Hartsen found self-control an exceedingly difficult
  matter.</p>

  <p>"You recognise, I trust, Mr. Samara," he said, "that such a proceeding
  will be considered by my Government as an unfriendly act?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not afraid that you'll go to war about it, if that is what you mean,"
  was the prompt retort. "You won't waste your resources on us whilst England
  and France are upon the face of the earth. And to be perfectly frank with
  you, General, if it was ever in your mind to use any part of the Russian Army
  for any German military enterprise, I can assure you that the idea was
  hopeless from the first. I do not intend that during my tenure of office the
  blood of a single Russian peasant shall be shed upon the battlefield. There
  was too much of that in nineteen-fifteen and sixteen."</p>

  <p>"You're more of a pacifist than I ever believed possible for a man of
  vigorous action, Mr. Samara," the General sneered.</p>

  <p>"That may easily be so," Samara assented. "I'm a pacifist at any rate so
  far as this, that I do not intend to support a standing army. Every Russian
  citizen, as he grows up, will be taught how to fight in his country's
  defence, if ever it should become necessary. Beyond that&mdash;nothing."</p>

  <p>Von Hartsen rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"You realise, Mr. Samara, I suppose," he said, "that even at home you will
  have to face something like a cataclysm. Your men do not wish for
  demobilisation."</p>

  <p>"They will wish for it fast enough when they see what I can offer them,"
  was the confident reply. "America has lent me enough money to provide for a
  million of them, and Great Britain has asked me to explain my needs so far as
  regards the others. I am sending an envoy there to-morrow."</p>

  <p>The General bowed coldly to Catherine and to Samara without extending his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"I shall report the issue of our conversation to my Government, Mr.
  Samara," he announced. "They will probably make further representations to
  you."</p>

  <p>He took his leave. Samara, with his hands in his pockets, walked to the
  window and stood looking out at the great front of the Casino and at the
  gardens below, whistling softly to himself.</p>

  <p>"Well," he remarked presently, "it's a stupid game. German diplomacy is
  always so obvious. As though any one couldn't see that our armies were meant
  to be the cat's-paw to snatch out of the fire the chestnuts of revenge.
  Russia will never fight in my day except in self-defence."</p>

  <p>"You might have civil war," Catherine reminded him calmly.</p>

  <p>Samara swung round on his heel.</p>

  <p>"Civil war," he growled. "About as much chance of it as the end of the
  world. The whole fault of the Russian as a politician is that he's too
  indifferent. That's why the Bolshevists were able to keep going as long as
  they did. The Russian wants peace and to go on as he is going. It is the aim
  of my life to see that he gets his wish. Miss Borans, listen to me for a
  moment, please."</p>

  <p>"I am listening," she assured him.</p>

  <p>"I hear from the Chief of the Police that inquiries are being made in
  Moscow for suitable accommodation for pretty well the whole of your Royalist
  friends. Well, I told them that they should be welcome back at Russia and
  they are welcome, but I want it to be clearly understood that they must live
  and behave as ordinary citizens. They must recognise and observe the law and
  the government of the country."</p>

  <p>Catherine inclined her head.</p>

  <p>"That seems reasonable," she admitted.</p>

  <p>"I do not imagine for a moment that they are foolish enough to entertain
  the idea of anything in the nature of a definite conspiracy," Samara
  continued, "but if they did attempt anything of the sort, I should be quite
  powerless to help them. You will drop them a hint perhaps."</p>

  <p>"I will certainly do so if I think it necessary," she promised.</p>

  <p>They parted a little stiffly, Samara to interview an emissary from Moscow,
  Catherine to spend a delightful hour, wandering about the gardens and terrace
  of the little principality. She returned about eight o'clock, dined alone in
  the spacious <i>salon</i> attached to Samara's suite, and was standing at the
  window gazing rather longingly at the curving arc of lights along the
  Terrace, when Samara himself suddenly entered the room.</p>

  <p>"You?" she exclaimed. "I thought you were dining with your man from
  Moscow."</p>

  <p>"I have dined with him," Samara answered. "I have sent him back home to-
  night. General von Hartsen's attitude does not disturb me in the least, but
  it is necessary to prepare them at the War Office."</p>

  <p>"And you?" she inquired.</p>

  <p>"I have other affairs to attend to here and shall await your return from
  London. You will leave tomorrow morning, or rather midday."</p>

  <p>"Do you wish to work now?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Don't be absurd," he scoffed. "Who ever works on his first night in Monte
  Carlo? I wish to take you to the Casino and to the Club, but you must be
  differently dressed."</p>

  <p>"Indeed," she murmured with a smile. "Well, you didn't give me much chance
  to bring clothes along, did you?"</p>

  <p>"You must be able to do something," he insisted impatiently.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact," she confided, "I have bought a little black frock
  this evening whilst I was wandering about. It is very simple and I don't know
  that it has come yet."</p>

  <p>"Go and put it on," he directed, "and meet me here in half an hour's
  time."</p>

  <p>She moved towards the door but on the threshold she looked back at him
  reflectively.</p>

  <p>"I am not at all sure," she declared, "that I wish to go out with
  you."</p>

  <p>He returned her gaze without moving a muscle.</p>

  <p>"Because I kissed you and haven't apologised?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"Not quite that," she admitted.</p>

  <p>"What then?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>Her eyes mocked him inscrutably.</p>

  <p>"What an <i>ing&eacute;nu</i> you are when you leave your own world for a
  minute," she said, disappearing through the door.</p>

  <p>An hour later they were seated side by side on a divan in the Sporting
  Club. People were standing three and four deep around the tables and play was
  for the moment impossible. Catherine, serenely beautiful, and with her
  intense curiosity concealed by the force of habit, was entirely content.
  Samara was moodily interested.</p>

  <p>"But who are these people?" she asked him. "I've never seen such jewels
  even at the opera at New York. And the men&mdash;here at last is a new
  type."</p>

  <p>Her companion smiled.</p>

  <p>"I am a poor showman," he admitted. "I have been here twice before in my
  life, but even I recognise some faces. There is Prince Artelberg, the
  Austrian Premier, the man who has very nearly made a country of Austria
  again."</p>

  <p>"But the lady with him, in blue silk?"</p>

  <p>"One seldom recognises the ladies," Samara answered drily. "The two men
  passing by are English. The nearer one is in the British Embassy at Moscow.
  The tall man with the grey beard and the small order is the King of Gothland.
  Alas, I am recognised! He is coming to speak to me."</p>

  <p>The King detached himself from a small group of friends and crossed the
  room towards Samara, who had risen to his feet.</p>

  <p>"A most amazing meeting!" the former exclaimed, holding out his hand. "You
  are on your way home from America, I presume?"</p>

  <p>"I landed this evening, your Majesty," Samara replied.</p>

  <p>"You will accept my heartiest congratulations on the success of your
  mission," the King begged. "But what about my cousins? What will they have to
  say to your altruistic efforts?"</p>

  <p>Samara shook his head.</p>

  <p>"One can but hope," he said, "that they will appreciate the advance of the
  inevitable."</p>

  <p>The King smiled.</p>

  <p>"I fancy that you will find General von Hartsen rather a handful," he
  remarked. "He has been here waiting for you for days, fuming like a madman
  most of the time. Present the young lady, if you please."</p>

  <p>"With your Majesty's permission," Samara replied, "Miss Catherine Borans,
  my temporary secretary&mdash;the King of Gothland. Miss Borans has been good
  enough to replace Andrew Kroupki, who was taken ill in New York."</p>

  <p>The King bowed and held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"To be secretary to Mr. Samara," he said, "is to stand behind the curtains
  of the diplomatic world. I congratulate you, Miss Borans."</p>

  <p>"I find the work exceedingly interesting, your Majesty," she observed.</p>

  <p>The King looked at her curiously.</p>

  <p>"You are an American?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"I have lived there most of my life," she answered.</p>

  <p>"It is curious," he continued. "You have a family likeness to some friends
  of mine. You stay here for long, Mr. Samara?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps four days, sir," was the reluctant reply.</p>

  <p>"I am at the H&ocirc;tel de Londres," the King announced. "If you have the
  leisure, please sign your name in my book."</p>

  <p>He bowed to Catherine, nodded to Samara and passed on. The two resumed
  their seats.</p>

  <p>"I am quite sure," the former said demurely, "that Miss Loyes would have
  come up to your room herself if she had realised that it might mean a trip to
  Europe and an introduction to a king."</p>

  <p>"There is worse to come," Samara muttered, glancing apprehensively at two
  approaching figures. "I thought this fellow, at any rate, was never going to
  speak to me again."</p>

  <p>General von Hartsen clicked his heels, bowed and held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Samara," he said, "my young friend here desires the advantage of a
  personal acquaintance with you. Will you pardon my taking this opportunity?
  Prince Frederick of Wehrenzollern&mdash;Mr. Samara."</p>

  <p>Samara studied the young man with interest as he shook hands. The latter
  smiled frankly.</p>

  <p>"My name may convey to such a world-famed democrat as you, sir," he
  observed, "unpleasant reminiscences. I have resumed my title, it is true, but
  I am a German citizen and a faithful subject of the Republic. I work in a
  bank. The General tells me that you have just arrived from Now York."</p>

  <p>"This afternoon," Samara assented.</p>

  <p>"You will do me the honour, perhaps," Prince Frederick continued, "of
  presenting me to the young lady."</p>

  <p>Samara acquiesced without comment.</p>

  <p>"Prince Frederick of Wehrenzollern&mdash;Miss Borans of New York."</p>

  <p>"Is it possible that you are an American, Mademoiselle?" the young prince
  murmured as he bowed low over her hand.</p>

  <p>"I have lived there all my life," Catherine assured him.</p>

  <p>"And this your first visit to Monte Carlo?"</p>

  <p>"My first visit to Europe."</p>

  <p>"It is amazing," he murmured. "You stay for some time here, I hope?"</p>

  <p>Catherine was imbibing the atmosphere of diplomacy.</p>

  <p>"It is uncertain," she replied.</p>

  <p>"You will permit me, perhaps," he ventured, with another bow, "to show you
  the Rooms? Mr. Samara will not object?" he added turning to the latter.</p>

  <p>"By all means."</p>

  <p>The two young people strolled off together, without waiting for Samara's
  somewhat surprised acceptance of the situation. General von Hartsen watched
  them critically.</p>

  <p>"Magnificent!" he exclaimed. "The blue-blooded aristocracy of the east and
  the red-blooded aristocracy of the west. Mademoiselle is doubtless the
  daughter of one of these great American millionaires."</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle's income, so far as I know," Samara replied drily, "is
  thirty dollars a week, the salary I pay her. She happens to be my secretary.
  I should perhaps have mentioned the fact."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch16"
     id="ch16">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"What the hell's this?" Samara demanded, as he entered the
  <i>salon</i> on the following morning and found a cardboard box the size of a
  washing basket on the table.</p>

  <p>"Roses," Catherine replied, raising her head from the interior which she
  had been examining. "The most wonderful I have ever seen in my life. For me,
  too! And from a prince! I'm glad I came to Europe!"</p>

  <p>"A prince who is also a bank clerk!" Samara scoffed. "Believe me, the
  world has finished with princes."</p>

  <p>"This one was very pleasant," Catherine confided. "He invited me to spend
  the greater part of to-day with him."</p>

  <p>"You told him you were going to London, of course?" Samara asked
  quickly.</p>

  <p>"I certainly did not. Ought I to have done so? I rather thought that was
  between you and me."</p>

  <p>Samara nodded his approval.</p>

  <p>"They wouldn't suspect you of being a real envoy," he observed. "That is
  one reason why I am sending you. Still, there is no need to run unnecessary
  risks. You have had your coffee?"</p>

  <p>"An hour ago," she answered, "and packed my things, and walked on the
  Terrace."</p>

  <p>"With your princeling?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"He was invisible," she sighed. "Of course it may have been that he didn't
  know that I was going to be there. He spoke of a party at the Carlton last
  night, wherever that may be. Perhaps he was late."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he was," Samara agreed.</p>

  <p>"It seems a little unfortunate," she murmured, as she poured out the
  coffee, "that I am leaving Monte Carlo so soon. I was never so great a
  success at the Hotel Weltmore in New York. On my first day here, a king has
  told me that I reminded him of some friends of his, and a prince has invited
  me to luncheon and sent me roses."</p>

  <p>"Just as well you're leaving," Samara growled. "Your head would soon be
  turned."</p>

  <p>"I am very well balanced," she assured him.</p>

  <p>"How about your memory?" he asked. "I hope your flirtatious successes
  haven't driven the serious matters out of your head altogether."</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," she confessed. "What am I going to London for? I am sure I
  don't know."</p>

  <p>"In that case you had better stay behind," he suggested gruffly.</p>

  <p>She laughed in derision.</p>

  <p>"My dear master," she said, "there isn't a word or a point of the whole
  thing that isn't in my brain. As an envoy I'm going to be the greatest
  success of modern times. I shall be irresistibly logical, delicately
  persuasive. What sort of a man is the British Prime Minister, please?"</p>

  <p>"A married man with a large family and serious views," Samara warned her,
  "and as for politics he is as sincere a democrat as I am."</p>

  <p>"I won't expound my little hobbies about government, then," she promised.
  "What a pity you aren't coming with me."</p>

  <p>"If I could make the journey," he replied coldly, "there would be no need
  for you to go."</p>

  <p>"I hope you won't get into trouble here, while I'm away," she sighed. "It
  really is a most attractive place."</p>

  <p>"There is seldom any trouble here except of one's own making," was the
  somewhat curt rejoinder. "Monte Carlo is a sort of sanctuary for all the
  criminals of the world. They meet here and exchange notes, but they look upon
  it as a sort of neutral ground. To attempt evil against a man in Monte Carlo
  is almost a breach of etiquette."</p>

  <p>He accompanied her presently to the railway station. Her bag had been sent
  on and they walked through the gardens, bathed in sunshine, along the terrace
  and waited a few moments for the lift. Catherine, humming softly to herself
  from sheer despair at her companion's silence, was looking amazingly
  beautiful. It was as though all the youth of her nature had responded to the
  entrancing change in the conditions of her life. In her neat travelling
  dress, with a great bunch of the roses in her hand and her almost lizard-like
  absorption of the glinting sunshine, she seemed to have imbibed with it the
  joyous spirit of her surroundings and the passing hour. The drabness of
  cities and of cramped labour were things utterly discarded. She was a young
  princess of the coming day; eager yet gracious. Samara, on the contrary, was
  not altogether at his best. His clothes, as was often the case, needed
  brushing, his hair and chin needed the services of a barber. There was a
  streak of red in his eyes, too, and a shadow underneath them, as though the
  night had gone ill with him. Catherine, as the lift rattled up, paused in her
  humming and looked at him critically.</p>

  <p>"Were you late last night?" she inquired.</p>

  <p>"Moderately. I had a great many despatches to read."</p>

  <p>"You had no bad news from Moscow?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"None at all. Politically everything seems to be reasonably quiet. It is
  from outside all the disturbance will come for some time. Our own people have
  scarcely realised yet the change which has come into their lives."</p>

  <p>They were alone in the lift. She drew a little nearer to him.</p>

  <p>"You are afraid of Germany, perhaps?"</p>

  <p>He brushed aside the suggestion scornfully.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid of no one," he answered. "A certain clique of statesmen in
  Germany will be furious and will start an agitation against us. I doubt
  whether they will do any good. As I have already warned you, they will watch
  London closely. That is why I prefer to send you there in this manner,
  without letters or documents, rather than to make you the bearer of any
  written proposition."</p>

  <p>"You are placing a great trust in me," she reflected, as they watched the
  approach of the train.</p>

  <p>"There is no success in life possible for anyone who has not learned to
  trust," he declared.</p>

  <p>The train came thundering in. Catherine's seat was found without
  difficulty. Samara stood in the corridor for a moment, looking in at her.</p>

  <p>"You are a strange person," she said, holding out her hand, "rather a
  bully and terribly unreasonable sometimes, but I shall be glad to see you
  again. Promise me that I may come back here, that you will not send word for
  me to go direct to Moscow or anything of that sort."</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"A statesman is always at the mercy of circumstances," he reminded her,
  "but the Duma is not summoned to meet until the week after next, and my
  arrival in Moscow before then would be premature. I think you may take it
  that I shall be here, awaiting your return on Saturday night."</p>

  <p>He backed away at the last urgent call and stood on the platform whilst
  the train rolled out. There was nothing to be seen of Catherine, and he gazed
  carelessly into the passing windows. Suddenly he gave a start. A young man
  who had boarded the train at the last moment was leaning breathlessly down
  from the platform of his car, waving his hand to a friend. As he recognised
  them, Samara's frown grew blacker. An entirely new and unwelcome sensation
  sent him back to the hotel with a curse upon his lips.</p>

  <p>Catherine was by no means a secretive person, but she had received a
  letter that morning of which she had said nothing to Samara. As soon as the
  train had started she took it from her handbag, spread it out and re-read it,
  a smile of amusement upon her lips. It was dated from the H&ocirc;tel de
  Paris on the preceding night:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>Mademoiselle!</i><br>
    <br>
    The roses which I shall send you to-morrow as soon as the shops are opened
    bring too tardy a message. I cannot rest to-night without sending you a
    line to beg for your gracious permission to see you at the earliest
    possible opportunity, to assure you that since the moment we met, only a
    few hours ago, every other thought has been driven from my mind, every
    other woman's face into which I have ever looked has become a blank. Please
    believe in my sincerity as I believe in you. There is no one so adorable in
    the world!<br>
    <br>
    Forgive my presumption! It comes from a heart overfull! I count the minutes
    until I shall see you again!<br>
    <br>
    Frederick.
  </blockquote>

  <p>The smile deepened. Catherine laughed softly to herself. She tore the
  letter into small pieces, held her hand out of the window and let them go
  fluttering by. Then, whilst her handbag was open, she looked at herself in
  the little mirror, handled her powder-puff lightly for a moment, closed the
  bag and leaned back in her place. For a time she watched with interest the
  unfamiliar landscape. Presently, however, she yawned, closed her eyes and
  dozed. She was awakened by the soft opening of the door of her compartment.
  She sat up and recognised the intruder with amazement.</p>

  <p>"Prince Frederick!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>He held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"Please not," he begged earnestly. "Even if you are angry with me let it
  be 'Frederick.' I am not&mdash;not exactly supposed to be here."</p>

  <p>"I should think not," she agreed with decision. "Why are you?"</p>

  <p>He closed the door and with some diffidence took the seat opposite to
  hers.</p>

  <p>"For the reason, mademoiselle," he confessed, "that I tried to express in
  my letter."</p>

  <p>"But this is absurd," she protested. "I am going to England."</p>

  <p>"I know it," he answered. "So am I."</p>

  <p>She looked at him for a moment steadfastly. Then she glanced out of the
  window.</p>

  <p>"You did not mention your intention yesterday," she said.</p>

  <p>"I had no idea of it myself," he assured her.</p>

  <p>"Do you wish me to understand that I am in any way connected with your
  journey?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I beg of you not to be angry, mademoiselle," he rejoined almost humbly.
  "You are the sole cause of it."</p>

  <p>"Then if you will allow me to tell you so," she said deliberately, "I
  think that you are mad."</p>

  <p>"I think so myself," he acknowledged. "I thought so all night. I have
  thought so every moment since we first met. But it is, after all, a glorious
  madness."</p>

  <p>She looked at him steadily. He was a personable young man, dressed in grey
  tweeds cut after the English fashion, with shiny brown shoes of the shade she
  liked, fine linen and a well-chosen tie. His features were good, if a little
  over-reminiscent of an unpopular ancestry. There was weakness in his face,
  but nothing much that was bad. So far as it was possible for any one to
  judge, he seemed to be in earnest.</p>

  <p>"Would it cure you," she inquired, "if I told you that this madness of
  which you speak is not in the least reciprocated?"</p>

  <p>"That would be too much to hope for," he admitted. "I am content to wait.
  I have not had a chance to speak to you seriously."</p>

  <p>"Seriously? How on earth could you be more serious?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>He hesitated. He had sufficient tact to be aware that he was on delicate
  ground. Young American ladies, he knew, were used to a great deal of freedom,
  and this one had doubtless been a little spoiled. It was scarcely a case for
  rushing tactics.</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle," he said, "the idea of my devotion is a new one to you. You
  have not accustomed yourself to it. Will you remember at least that we do not
  meet as strangers? I may claim the privileges of a travelling companion?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose there is nothing to prevent your doing that," she acquiesced,
  "but I might point out that the remaining three seats in this compartment
  have been engaged in my name."</p>

  <p>"I shall leave according to your instructions, mademoiselle," he promised.
  "The whole of the corresponding compartment next door is mine."</p>

  <p>Catherine began to laugh to herself. He watched her questioningly.</p>

  <p>"You see it is my first visit to Europe," she explained. "I had no idea
  that such things as this really happened."</p>

  <p>"Far more wonderful things than this happen," he assured her earnestly.
  "Your American men, mademoiselle&mdash;pardon me, but they have no sentiment.
  They would not throw convention to the winds as I have done&mdash;abandoned
  all my engagements to follow the person whom I adore on the merest chance of
  a kindly word, to the one city in the world which I detest."</p>

  <p>"I'm not so sure," she reflected. "Some of these American young men are
  fairly rapid."</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"They are not capable of sentiment so intense," he declared.</p>

  <p>"The one I am engaged to is quite headstrong when he is roused," Catherine
  remarked.</p>

  <p>Prince Frederick glanced at her with a flash in his blue eyes which made
  him seem almost like a man.</p>

  <p>"Engaged! You engaged!" he cried. "That is nothing."</p>

  <p>"My young man thinks that it's a great deal," she observed. "He very much
  disliked my coming to Europe. He's on his way over here now."</p>

  <p>"Who is he? What is he?" Prince Frederick demanded. "I must know all about
  him."</p>

  <p>"He is called Nicholas," she confided, "and he is&mdash;well, he's very
  much what you are."</p>

  <p>"A banker!" her companion exclaimed. "But that is only a blind. I have
  taken a position in commerce so as to establish myself as a German
  citizen."</p>

  <p>"You have other ideas?" she asked him curiously.</p>

  <p>He pulled himself up.</p>

  <p>"That is of no account," he replied. "When does this young man arrive?
  You're not going to England to meet him?"</p>

  <p>"I don't even know what boat he is on," she declared.</p>

  <p>The blue-liveried steward paused for a moment at the door with his
  customary announcement.</p>

  <p>"<i>Le d&eacute;jeuner est servi, madame et monsieur."</i></p>

  <p>Prince Frederick rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"You will at least do me the honour of lunching with me, mademoiselle?" he
  begged.</p>

  <p>"I think I may go so far without indiscretion," she assented.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch17"
     id="ch17">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Catherine's first impressions of England were delightful
  ones. She sat in the very comfortable armchair of a well-hung Pullman and
  looked out upon a patchwork of tender greens, of woods bottomed with
  bluebells, of spinneys and railway banks yellow with primroses, and orchards
  in which pink, waxy blossoms were already beginning to form. She was far too
  interested to notice the almost savage gloom of the young man who sat in the
  opposite chair.</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle Catherine," he exclaimed at last.</p>

  <p>She turned reluctantly away from the sun-bathed panorama of fertile
  country.</p>

  <p>"My name is 'Miss Borans,'" she told him. "I do not appreciate the use of
  my Christian name."</p>

  <p>"You are brutal," he declared.</p>

  <p>She looked at him without kindness, scarcely even with friendliness.</p>

  <p>"You are a very absurd and spoilt young man," she said. "You seem to fancy
  yourself aggrieved because I am not able to reciprocate in any way your very
  ridiculous feeling for me. You have no common-sense. It is rather I who
  should be aggrieved. I did not encourage you to follow me. For the small
  services you have rendered me upon the train and the boat, I am much obliged,
  but I should have preferred being without them. If you wish to remain on
  terms of friendship or acquaintance with me, please abandon that expression
  and talk like a reasonable human being."</p>

  <p>His face showed no signs of lightening. He seemed indeed thoroughly
  dejected and miserable.</p>

  <p>"Why are you so cruel?" he begged. "Why can you not be just a little
  kinder? What is there about me repugnant?"</p>

  <p>"You're not in the least repugnant to me," she assured him. "You simply do
  not interest me very much, and so far as my affections are concerned, they
  are engaged elsewhere."</p>

  <p>He watched the flying landscape for a moment, as though he hated the speed
  it indicated. For the hundredth time he tried to find courage.</p>

  <p>"I've always heard that you American girls are so practical," he said.
  "Why should you remain the secretary of a man like Samara? I am very rich,
  mademoiselle. I am very fond of travel. It is not my intention to marry for
  years. Reasons which I cannot confide to you forbid it. There are secondary
  titles belonging to some of my estates. I always thought those sort of things
  appealed to Americans," he mumbled as a gleam in her eyes almost froze the
  words upon his lips.</p>

  <p>"They tell me that you have re-established duelling in Germany. Is it
  true?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"It is true," he admitted.</p>

  <p>"I have a friend in America," she went on, "who is on his way over here
  now, who is supposed to be a very expert swordsman. I fancy that I failed to
  grasp your meaning just now. We are perhaps a little out of sympathy. I
  propose to read."</p>

  <p>She buried herself in an illustrated paper. Her companion rose to his
  feet, kicked a footstool out of his way, and with a scowling face retreated
  into the smoking car. He ordered a drink and threw himself into a vacant
  chair.</p>

  <p>"A little American typist!" he muttered. "A typist from the Hotel
  Weltmore!"</p>

  <p>He struck the table with his fist. The few people in the car looked up in
  surprise. He only scowled.</p>

  <p>"I want that drink," he shouted to the steward.</p>

  <p>At Victoria Catherine smiled at him quite pleasantly, but she had already
  engaged a porter. As she was stepping into the taxi-cab, however, to which he
  insisted upon escorting her, she vouchsafed a few disconcerting words of
  farewell.</p>

  <p>"You can tell your little friend," she said, "or General von Hartsen's
  friend, that I am very much obliged for the careful way he handled my
  belongings when he searched my bag, and you can also congratulate him upon
  his amazing stealthiness when he entered my compartment last night and went
  through my luggage. I should like to know where he got his master-key
  from."</p>

  <p>"I do not know what you are talking about," the young man exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"That is possibly true," she admitted. "At the same time, the fact remains
  that I hate spies. You can also tell him this, that for the whole of the
  sixty seconds he was in my compartment, he was on the brink of eternity. I
  had a small revolver pointed at him through the bars of my bedstead and I am
  not sufficiently used to firearms for my finger to be absolutely steady upon
  the trigger, especially when one is travelling at fifty miles an hour."</p>

  <p>"If what you have suggested has really happened," Prince Frederick
  declared eagerly. "I promise you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You need promise me nothing," she interrupted. "I suppose if I undertake
  a political mission I must risk the consequences. I am only surprised that
  people think this sort of thing worth while nowadays. But let me tell you
  this," she concluded, leaning out of the taxi-cab window, "when the door
  first opened last night and I saw the covered light of the torch, I thought
  that it was you, and if I hadn't realised that it wasn't the second I
  did&mdash;well, I was too close to have missed. Good-bye!"</p>

  <p>"A damned little American typist!" Prince Frederick muttered once more
  under his breath as the taxi-cab rolled off.</p>

  <p>Catherine drove to a small hotel in a quiet but fashionable neighbourhood
  where she found a room reserved and a letter awaiting her, the latter a
  formidable-looking document, in a large square envelope, with a coat of arms
  at the back. She tore it open and read:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>Downing Street,</i><br>
    <br>
    April 21st.<br>
    <br>
    Dear Madam:<br>
    <br>
    The Prime Minister desires me to say that he has heard from Mr. Samara of
    your presence in London and, should you wish for an interview with him, he
    will be at liberty at five o'clock this afternoon, or at eleven o'clock
    to-morrow morning.<br>
    <br>
    He asks me in the meantime to suggest that if by any chance the nature of
    your mission, if any, should have been mentioned and you should be
    approached by representatives of the Press, it would be as well for you to
    preserve the strictest secrecy as to any communications you may have to
    make.<br>
    <br>
    Faithfully yours, dear madam,<br>
    <br>
    FRANK S. PEACOCK,<br>
    <br>
    Private Secretary.
  </blockquote>

  <p>Catherine glanced at the clock, summoned a maid and ordered a bath. In an
  hour's time she descended into the small lounge of the hotel. She was
  accosted immediately by a page-boy carrying an enormous bunch of flowers.</p>

  <p>"I am taking these up to your room, madam," he announced. "The gentleman
  who left them is over there."</p>

  <p>Prince Frederick stepped eagerly forward. He was immaculately dressed in
  town clothes and he carried a silk hat and cane in his hand. His expression
  was anxious and woebegone. He had decided to change his tactics.</p>

  <p>"I have ventured to call," he said, "to beg for your forgiveness in case
  you should have misunderstood anything I said this afternoon."</p>

  <p>"Very well," she conceded. "I am willing to believe that it was, as you
  suggest, a misunderstanding."</p>

  <p>"You are alone here," he went on eagerly. "You do not know London. I, on
  the other hand, am well acquainted with it. Permit me the great honour of
  offering you dinner and escorting you to a theatre. I assure you that I will
  say nothing which could possibly offend, or even embarrass you."</p>

  <p>Catherine hesitated. She was, after all, as fond of a good dinner and a
  theatre as any girl of her age, and her hotel, though highly respectable, had
  a museum-like appearance. The young man saw her hesitation and hastened to
  pursue his advantage.</p>

  <p>"Madame Ronet is singing at the opera," he announced, "or there are two
  good musical comedies. If you would not mind dining early we could have
  supper afterwards, and perhaps dance if you care about it. I shall promise to
  be nothing but your attentive and most respectful cavalier."</p>

  <p>"Very well, then," she assented graciously. "If you will find out from the
  hotel people at what time I have returned from the visit I am about to pay, I
  will be ready in an hour after that."</p>

  <p>She passed on with a gracious little nod and entered the taxi which the
  hall porter had called for her.</p>

  <p>"Where to, madam?" the man asked.</p>

  <p>"To the Houses of Parliament," she directed at random.</p>

  <p>The man started off. At the corner of the street she put her head out of
  the window:</p>

  <p>"Number 10, Downing Street, please," she told him.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch18"
     id="ch18">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A very alert and polite young secretary, who had met
  Catherine in the hall, took her at once into the presence of his Chief, Mr.
  Philip Rossiter, erstwhile Foreign Minister, and now Premier of England. Mr.
  Rossiter was a middle-aged man of quiet, introspective manner. He welcomed
  his visitor with easy cordiality, and if he felt any surprise at her
  appearance he effectually concealed it.</p>

  <p>"My friend Samara has already written to me the circumstances to which I
  owe the pleasure of this visit," he said, as he settled himself comfortably
  in an easy-chair opposite to hers. "Andrew Kroupki would have come, of
  course, but for his unfortunate illness. A very brilliant young man, that. I
  met him when I visited Moscow three years ago."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Kroupki would have come no doubt with wider discretion," Catherine
  remarked. "I am sure you understand that I am here only as a messenger."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," the other murmured. "All great men have their hobbies and
  aversions, and Samara's particular aversion has always been documents and
  diplomatic correspondence. We have come to an excellent understanding many
  times through an interchange of visits. I hope Mr. Samara has told you to
  talk to me quite frankly. I know all about his visit to America&mdash;in
  fact, I am not at all sure that I did not put the idea into his head."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Samara has told me certain things," Catherine acknowledged. "He has
  given me a insight into the arrangements he has made and why he has made
  them. Then he has gone on to tell me that whatever I know I may tell you. So
  you see I shall reply quite openly to any questions you ask me concerning his
  success in America. But I must warn you to start with that I am a newcomer, a
  stranger to all matters of diplomacy. I know nothing, even, of Mr. Samara's
  Government. Considering that I have been working for him assiduously during
  the last three weeks, it is amazing how little I know of him."</p>

  <p>The Premier smiled. The subject of Samara was one which always interested
  him.</p>

  <p>"Your Chief is one of the remarkable men of this generation," he declared.
  "Fifteen years ago, Bolshevism seemed to have its fangs deep into the very
  heart of Russia. It didn't seem possible for anyone to prevail against it.
  Samara has worked miracles. To-day Russia is, if not entirely herself again,
  well on the way towards reconstruction. Financially, industrially and
  economically she is making gigantic strides. Samara is daring, but he has the
  right ideas. Russia will be one of the great powers again long before his
  work is at an end. Personally&mdash;I have told Samara this myself&mdash;I
  see but one danger, and that is his tendency towards idealism. It is a great
  thing to mount the ladder, but one should set one's feet upon the rungs with
  care."</p>

  <p>Catherine looked at her host intently.</p>

  <p>"You don't believe in this demobilisation scheme?" she asked quickly.</p>

  <p>"Theoretically, I think it wonderful," he answered. "Tell me&mdash;I think
  I know, but still tell me&mdash;the Washington visit was a success?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," she assured him. "Mr. Samara granted certain concessions and
  he has arranged for a loan of two hundred million dollars. The whole of the
  Third Army will be demobilised within six months, and employment will be
  found for every soldier."</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea as to the feeling amongst the militarists?" he
  inquired.</p>

  <p>"So far as the Third Army is concerned, the men are perfectly willing to
  submit to disbandment," she replied. "The officers are mostly German and they
  resent it. Still, Mr. Samara is very much in earnest. They will have to go,
  as the works are established, the mines opened and the machinery being
  shipped."</p>

  <p>The Premier looked at his visitor with interest.</p>

  <p>"You seem to have a very sound grasp of this subject, considering your
  recent connection with it," he said. "Are you an American, might I ask?"</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"I was born in Russia," she admitted. "I have lived in America, however,
  all my life. It is my knowledge of Russian, of course, which has given me the
  opportunity to be of so much use to Mr. Samara."</p>

  <p>He continued to study her with curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Your people were amongst the refugees?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>The Premier turned to some papers by his side. Something in Catherine's
  tone told him that, so far as she was concerned, that subject was at an
  end.</p>

  <p>"What have you to say to me, Miss Borans?" he asked succinctly.</p>

  <p>"Mr Samara desires me to present this subject for your consideration," she
  said. "England was a heavy loser at the time of the Russian
  <i>d&eacute;bacle.</i> There are many works and industries still languishing
  which were started with English capital and upon which he considers England
  still has a claim. It is his wish to demobilise as well as the Third also the
  whole of the Second Army. He therefore needs&mdash;it is Russia's greatest
  need to- day&mdash;a further development of her resources. He asks if you
  will appoint a committee of business men, preferably those connected with the
  various enterprises in which English shareholders have lost money, and send
  them over to treat with him in Moscow."</p>

  <p>"To what end?" Mr. Rossiter inquired.</p>

  <p>"To arrange with them," she continued, "for further considerable advances
  which will enable many of the industries and works which have been closed
  down to be reopened. Mr. Samara does not pretend that he will be able to pay
  in full those debts incurred in the days of the monarchy and ignored&mdash;in
  fact, repudiated altogether&mdash;by the Bolshevists. He considers, however,
  that some sort of a fund&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A sinking fund," Mr. Rossiter suggested.</p>

  <p>"That is the term he used," Catherine acquiesced&mdash;"could be
  established, so that in time a portion of the old debt could be repaid to
  English creditors, by means of the renewal of the particular industries in
  which their money had been lost. They would, of course, in the meantime, be
  making the profits to which they were entitled on the new business."</p>

  <p>"I see," the Premier murmured. "I gather from the nature of these
  suggestions that there is very little unemployment in Russia."</p>

  <p>"Scarcely any," she assured him. "Nearly every industry is flourishing.
  All that the farmers need is more machinery and more workers. Mr. Samara has
  pointed out to me that the trouble in the demobilisation of these armies is
  that quite half of the men are not attracted by the idea of working upon the
  land. That is why it is so necessary to provide them with other means of
  earning a livelihood."</p>

  <p>"I quite understand," Mr. Rossiter said. "Did your Chief suggest any
  particular enterprises connected with previous British undertakings?"</p>

  <p>She drew a paper from her handbag.</p>

  <p>"Here is the list, sir," she pointed out, "of industries brought to a
  standstill during the Bolshevist epoch, all of them launched in the first
  instance with British capital, which Mr. Samara thinks might be
  reconstituted. It is the only document I have brought with me."</p>

  <p>Mr. Rossiter adjusted his eyeglass and read down the list. Then he rose to
  his feet and consulted for some time with his secretary who was writing at
  the further end of the room. Presently he returned to his place.</p>

  <p>"I cannot, of course, give you a definite reply, Miss Borans," he said.
  "But my impression is that there would not be the slightest difficulty in
  launching this scheme and finding the capital required. When do you return to
  Russia?"</p>

  <p>"I am leaving here on Friday morning, sir," she told him, "to rejoin Mr.
  Samara at Monte Carlo."</p>

  <p>"Between now and then," Mr. Rossiter promised her, "you shall have the
  names of the committee I suggest and approximately the amount which the
  Government will be likely to vote by way of a subsidy. I have now a question
  to ask you, the reply to which may not be in your scale of information. What
  military force does your Chief intend to retain under arms?"</p>

  <p>"I know nothing definite," Catherine replied, "but I believe that it is
  Mr. Samara's idea to do away with the whole of the military establishment of
  Russia."</p>

  <p>Mr. Rossiter fingered his penholder.</p>

  <p>"Your Chief," he remarked, "does not believe in war."</p>

  <p>"Not against Russia, at any rate," she assented. "He considers that Russia
  is geographically impregnable. Apart from that, he considers that the folly
  of warfare has been proved. I have heard him say that the campaign of
  nineteen-fourteen&mdash;nineteen-twenty was more disastrous to the allies who
  won it than to the German Empire who lost it."</p>

  <p>"Perfectly sound," Mr. Rossiter agreed. "The trouble of it is we have all
  learnt something since then. I don't mind telling you this," he went on. "If
  the Germans had been victorious, they would have found means of making
  England and France pay. They would never have been gulled by this higher
  economic doctrine and gone without their booty. To-day if there were war and
  Germany won, I have not the faintest doubt that she would know how to extract
  every penny of what she considered due to her and get full advantage of her
  victory."</p>

  <p>"I do not understand economics," Catherine confessed. "I only know that
  Mr. Samara does not fear anything of the sort."</p>

  <p>The Premier was silent for several moments. When he spoke again he seemed
  almost to be talking to himself.</p>

  <p>"Samara is right up to a certain point," he declared. "The German Republic
  are not out for war. They know very well that the first breath of it would
  bring them internal division. To us, who watch such things closely, however,
  there are very dangerous symptoms in German politics. We should not be
  surprised any day to hear of a monarchical plot."</p>

  <p>"But Germany is so prosperous under present conditions," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"Precisely," the other rejoined. "But there is nothing breeds discontent
  quicker than undue prosperity. You must remember, too, that the racial and
  fundamental temperament of a nation can never be changed. Russia, France and
  Germany, all three of them, have the instinct amongst their peasants and
  <i>bourgeoisie</i> for monarchical government. So far as France and Russia
  are concerned, at any rate, I think they are right. The Frenchman is too
  easily swayed. So long as he believes he is part of the government, he is all
  the time tearing his hair and changing his mind. That sort of person always
  makes a loyal and submissive subject. The Russian peasant is in the same
  position for a different reason. He doesn't want his liberty. He doesn't want
  to be made to think for himself. He wants to be taken care of. He, too, wants
  to be ruled. Germany, I must admit, I am not so sure about. The German
  martial instinct seems to me to be the one great thing which might call back
  a Kaiser."</p>

  <p>"Who would he be?" Catherine asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Without a doubt, Prince Frederick of Wehrenzollern," was the prompt
  reply. "He is the youngest son of the late Crown Prince and by far the most
  popular&mdash;reminds one rather of our own King, when he was young&mdash;a
  sportsman, a ladies' man, a democrat and a ruler. I don't know much about
  Prince Frederick, of course, although he manages to keep himself pretty well
  in the limelight, but I do believe that he is nursing the
  monarchy&mdash;playing to the people all the time."</p>

  <p>"Am I to tell Mr. Samara from you that you think he had better leave that
  First Army alone?" she asked bluntly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Rossiter took a cigarette from a box by his side and tapped it
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"My advice to your very distinguished Chief would be to watch internal
  Germany," he said. "I quite agree with him that the German Republic are not
  bellicose. On the other hand, a German monarchy would at once seek to justify
  its existence by a war. Samara knows as much about this, though, as I do. Let
  him deal with the Third and Second Armies as he will. I think I can safely
  promise him that the commission I send over to Moscow will be able to start
  industries which will absorb the whole of the surplus labour."</p>

  <p>Catherine rose to her feet. The Prime Minister followed suit.</p>

  <p>"I am happy to have had the pleasure of receiving you, Miss Borans," he
  declared. "Tell Mr. Samara from me that I greatly approve of his new
  diplomatic methods. You propose to remain in London, I understand, until
  Friday. Is there any way in which we can be of service to you?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever, thank you," she replied frankly. "I have never been in
  London before. I shall very much enjoy doing a little exploring on my own
  account."</p>

  <p>"I sympathise with you entirely," Mr. Rossiter concluded. "We will show
  you our greatest kindness&mdash;kindness, in this instance, because it is a
  real deprivation&mdash;by leaving you alone. Present my compliments to your
  Chief and don't forget that one word of warning&mdash;watch for a monarchist
  plot in Berlin. I do not need to tell him to protect himself in Moscow.
  Peacock, show Miss Borans to her car."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch19"
     id="ch19">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Catherine, with the major part of her mission successfully
  accomplished, devoted herself, with an abandon which at times amazed her
  companion, to the spending of a thoroughly frivolous evening. They dined
  exceedingly well at Maridge's, saw the last two acts of a popular musical
  comedy, and went on to a select and fashionable club restaurant, where
  dancing was already in full swing. During the whole of the evening, Prince
  Frederick's behaviour was entirely correct. He had adopted the attitude of
  the wistful but silent lover. He devoted himself entirely to telling his
  companion the names of the various notabilities by whom they were surrounded
  and relating anecdotes about some of them. With regard to himself he spoke
  scarcely at all and he did not ask her a single question concerning her
  mission to London. On the three or four occasions when he was greeted or
  addressed by acquaintances his manner was genial and full of bonhomie.
  Catherine watched him with amusement.</p>

  <p>"You seem to have a good many acquaintances over here," she remarked.</p>

  <p>"I was at Eton for two terms and Oxford for a year," he reminded her. "I
  have made it my business to understand something of English life and English
  people."</p>

  <p>"With what object?" she asked him point-blank.</p>

  <p>His smile for a moment seemed almost sinister.</p>

  <p>"We disinherited ones of the world," he answered, "have to keep friends
  with everybody. Unless I am strictly incognito I keep away from the Court, of
  course. I was known over here as Frederick von Burhl, the name under which I
  started my commercial career in Berlin after leaving school. That is eight
  years ago, however, and to-day the prejudices against the aristocracy have
  declined."</p>

  <p>"Do you believe," she inquired, "that imperialism is dead in Germany?"</p>

  <p>He raised his eyebrows slightly.</p>

  <p>"Is that a question which I could possibly answer?" he protested.
  "Especially to the confidential secretary of one of the world's great
  democrats."</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"Please don't think that I have designs upon your secrets if you have
  any," she begged. "I asked merely for curiosity. There was an article in one
  of the reviews I read on the steamer in which it spoke of a reawakening of
  the monarchical impulse in Russia, Germany and even France."</p>

  <p>"The writer was, I should think, well-informed," Prince Frederick answered
  cautiously. "I believe the impulse is there. That is why Samara shows so much
  more than appears on the surface in setting himself to destroy the militarism
  of his country. A standing army is always on the monarchical side."</p>

  <p>Catherine's attention was suddenly diverted by an amazing occurrence. She,
  like most others in the room, was watching the entrance of two people who
  were being received with every mark of distinction. One was a very beautiful
  woman, wearing a Russian head-dress and amazing jewellery. The young man with
  her, to Catherine's bewilderment, was Nicholas.</p>

  <p>Catherine laid her hand on her companion's coat sleeve.</p>

  <p>"Please tell me who these are?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>Prince Frederick leaned forward. The woman seemed to be watching for a
  sign from him. His expression remained stony.</p>

  <p>"That is Adele Fedorleys, the ballet dancer," he confided. "She is half a
  Pole and half a Russian. Her companion I do not know."</p>

  <p>"I do," Catherine exclaimed in delight, as she watched the blank amazement
  in Nicholas' face change to pale fury. "He is quite a friend of mine."</p>

  <p>"A Russian himself, by the look of him," Prince Frederick observed. "Tell
  me," he went on curiously, turning towards his companion, "how is it that
  you, who describe yourself as an American typist engaged by Mr. Samara from
  the Weltmore Hotel Secretarial Bureau, are acquainted with a young man in
  this country who is in a position to know and entertain Madame
  Fedorleys?"</p>

  <p>"A quaint coincidence," she admitted. "Almost as quaint as the fact that
  you two should be in the same room. That is the young man I spoke
  of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She broke off suddenly. Nicholas, having escorted his companion to their
  table, was crossing the room towards them.</p>

  <p>"He is much bigger than I," Prince Frederick whispered. "I am
  terrified!"</p>

  <p>"You are safe&mdash;here," she laughed. "I may have to smuggle you out the
  back way when you leave."</p>

  <p>The young man who had come to a standstill before the table certainly
  presented a somewhat formidable appearance. He seemed to have grown in
  stature and importance since he had left New York. The pastiness of his
  complexion had gone&mdash;replaced by a touch of becoming sunburn. His burly
  shoulders, closely- cropped hair and a certain heaviness of feature
  suggested, in an indeterminate sort of way, the professional pugilist, an
  impression, however, which was modified by the keenness of his blue eyes, the
  levelness of his eyebrows and a certain breadth of forehead. He bowed very
  low and raised Catherine's fingers to his lips. Then he spoke to her
  hurriedly in Russian, his voice thick with anger.</p>

  <p>"What is this? How is it that I find you here in London, alone with this
  young man? Samara is in Monte Carlo. I have news of him."</p>

  <p>"Contain yourself, my dear Nicholas," she answered in the same language.
  "I am here on an errand for Mr. Samara, and my companion is an acquaintance
  whom you will be glad to know."</p>

  <p>There was nothing in Nicholas' face to indicate any prospective pleasure.
  His expression was indeed forbidding in the extreme. Catherine turned to her
  escort and spoke in English.</p>

  <p>"This," she said, "is a most extraordinary meeting. The strangest part of
  it, perhaps, is that you two should never have met and that it should be left
  to an insignificant person like myself to make you acquainted. Which takes
  precedence, I wonder? Such things are a mystery to me in my station of life,
  so I must take my chance. This is Prince Frederick of Wehrenzollern, better
  known in this country as Frederick von Burhl&mdash;Prince Nicholas Imanoff,
  whom I knew in New York as Mr. Ronoff."</p>

  <p>Prince Frederick had risen to his feet. The two young men, after a moment
  or two of blank surprise, looked at each other with very natural curiosity.
  Then Nicholas extended his hand.</p>

  <p>"I should have recognised you by your pictures," he said.</p>

  <p>"And I you by your likeness to your House," was the courteous reply. "I
  understood that you had settled down in New York."</p>

  <p>"There is only one country in which I shall ever settle down," Nicholas
  answered with some dignity. "I am on my way to visit it now."</p>

  <p>"You are allowed to enter Russia!" Frederick exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"At Samara's invitation. It is humiliating, but it is still a generous
  action. A great friend of my House, Kirdorff of Riga, is with me in London.
  My aunt, the Grand Duchess, and various others of my friends and relatives
  are following me by the French route."</p>

  <p>"This is wonderful news," Frederick remarked. "Samara is a brave man,
  though. It seems to me that he has chosen a curious time to give you
  permission to return. I should like very much to talk to you, Nicholas. You
  will pass through Germany on your way to Russia. I should like you to meet
  some friends of mine."</p>

  <p>"You have already, I see, met one of mine," Nicholas observed.</p>

  <p>"I have met in Monte Carlo this young lady, calling herself Miss Borans,
  the private secretary of the Russian President," Frederick replied eagerly.
  "Her story is that she came from a typists' office in New York."</p>

  <p>Catherine shrugged her shoulders. A faint smile flitted across her
  lips.</p>

  <p>"After all, it does not perhaps matter very much," she observed. "You had
  better present me, Nicholas."</p>

  <p>The latter turned to Frederick.</p>

  <p>"You have the honour," he said, "to have made the acquaintance of the
  Princess Catherine of Russia, hereditary Grand Duchess of Urulsk. The
  Princess, I may add, is my fianc&eacute;e."</p>

  <p>"I was," Catherine murmured sweetly, "but that young lady over there will
  take a great deal of explanation. I have lived so long in America that I have
  imbibed the <i>bourgeois</i> view as to proceedings of this sort."</p>

  <p>An angry light flashed for a moment in Nicholas' eyes.</p>

  <p>"The young lady is a fellow-countrywoman and a great patriot," he said.
  "You remind me of my duty as host. I will return."</p>

  <p>He bowed and turned away. Catherine watched him with a smile. The whole
  episode had appealed to her immensely. It was the young American woman who
  leaned back in her seat and laughed.</p>

  <p>"Some shock for poor Nicholas!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"And for me!" Frederick groaned.</p>

  <p>"I have been an idiot," Frederick declared bitterly, towards the close of
  the evening.</p>

  <p>Catherine smiled with amused tolerance.</p>

  <p>"I do not think that you are to be blamed," she conceded. "Why should you
  not believe what you are told? Besides, it is quite true that I am a typist.
  Not one of us out there had any money. Nicholas himself was selling bonds for
  a Wall Street stockbroker, and Alexandrina earned a few dollars making
  artificial roses. My engagement by Mr. Samara and my coming to Europe were
  entirely matters of chance."</p>

  <p>"It is true," he demanded, "that you are betrothed to Nicholas?"</p>

  <p>"It is perfectly true," she acknowledged, "only I am not at all sure that
  I shall marry him."</p>

  <p>"You must not," was the low reply. "You must marry me."</p>

  <p>She turned to answer this with a jest and was amazed at his expression. He
  was very pale and his eyes seemed to have sunken. The hand which clutched his
  wine-glass was shaking.</p>

  <p>"I have thought of nobody else since the first moment I saw you," he went
  on. "You have driven everything else from my mind. I followed you here to
  London blindly. I never dared to hope that this might be possible. Now I
  realise that it is. It does not matter about money. I have plenty, and who
  knows, there may be a great future for us."</p>

  <p>She listened for a moment to the music, gazing a little absently across
  the room. She had the air of looking through the walls into space. For a
  moment, indeed, her thoughts had strayed to the city of her dreams as it had
  been pictured to her, with its gilded roofs, its palaces and its hovels side
  by side.</p>

  <p>"There is a chance of that, too, for Nicholas," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"His chance is nothing to mine," Frederick insisted harshly. "For me the
  ground has been prepared, year by year and month by month. We have machinery
  at work. The time is close at hand. For Nicholas there are nothing but
  dreams. We have no Samara in Germany."</p>

  <p>She rose to her feet.</p>

  <p>"You are too much in earnest," she whispered. "People are watching you. I
  believe they guess that you have proposed to me. It is most embarrassing. I
  insist upon dancing."</p>

  <p>His hand as he touched her fingers was cold. No trace of colour returned
  to his cheeks, even after the exercise.</p>

  <p>"Are you not feeling well?" Catherine inquired, as they sat down.</p>

  <p>"You can cure me with a word," he answered passionately. "Listen. Give me
  hope and I will return to Berlin to-morrow. I will send you a welcome from
  those who count. I will give you proof of what is to come."</p>

  <p>"Is it possible that you are really in earnest?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"In deadly earnest," he groaned.</p>

  <p>Her real nationality suddenly asserted itself. There was a vein of cruelty
  in her race and it sprang into being. She leaned back in her place and
  laughed.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch20"
     id="ch20">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Catherine, after she had descended from the train at Monte
  Carlo, lingered for a moment upon the platform, dazzled by the sunshine. She
  had left London in a mantle of grey, Paris in a rain and wind storm, and now,
  after a long night in a <i>salon-lit,</i> she seemed to have stepped out into
  a new world of enchantment. The sea and sky seemed bluer than ever, the
  houses whiter and cleaner, the great stucco-like Casino more of a joke,
  resembling rather a child's toy dragged from its play-box than a serious
  abode of drama, an arena for the most sordid of men's passions. And to add to
  it all, as she leaned back in her little victoria, the music from the distant
  orchestra at the Caf&eacute; de Paris came with real sweetness through the
  scented air. She sat forward and watched the people eagerly as she crossed
  the square. There was the same atmosphere about them all, a geniality and
  sense of relaxation which after many years of New York was strangely
  attractive to her. No one was in a hurry; every one appeared to enjoy not
  having to be in a hurry. There was plenty of time for the amenities of
  life.</p>

  <p>It was a busy hour at the hotel, but each member of the staff seemed to
  find leisure to welcome her back after her brief absence. A reception clerk
  persisted in conducting her upstairs; the lift-boy's smile and bow made her
  feel that she had come home.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Samara is walking on the Terrace with some friends, madam," the clerk
  announced. "I think that he scarcely expected you until to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Catherine nodded.</p>

  <p>"I meant to stay in Paris for a day," she explained. "I changed my mind.
  The weather was intolerable."</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle was wise," the man declared, with a farewell bow. "Yesterday
  we had rain, but to-day, as mademoiselle sees, it is perfect."</p>

  <p>Catherine unfastened her coat and glanced around the room before going to
  her own apartment. She noticed with tolerant disapproval that it was
  untidy&mdash;a little pile of discarded envelopes upon the table, cigar-ash
  upon the mantelpiece. Suddenly, however, the tolerance faded from her face.
  On the table was a woman's glove. An odour which she hated became more
  insistent&mdash;an odour of scented cigarettes. There were some crushed
  flowers, too, upon the table. She rang the bell and pointed out the state of
  the room to the chamber-maid. The woman smiled as she apologised.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur was late last night," she explained. "And he only rose an hour
  ago. I did not wish to disturb him. I will now do all that is necessary."</p>

  <p>Catherine went thoughtfully to her room, changed her clothes, bathed and
  rested for a time. She was conscious of a curious sense of disappointment and
  depression for which she could in no way account. She knew perfectly well
  that the private life of Gabriel Samara was outside her ken. Save for that
  wild moment on the steamer when he had kissed her&mdash;a moment alluded to
  only once since&mdash;not one of his actions towards her or any one else had
  indicated the slightest interest in her sex. When she had left she was quite
  sure that he had not a woman acquaintance in the place. And now everything
  betokened at least the beginning of an intrigue on his part. After all, he
  was a Russian, a genius, a person of passion and temperament. There was
  nothing so strange about it, even from the point of view of her strict
  bringing-up. Samara, as she told herself, lying on her bed with her hands
  clasped behind her head, was not of her world. Already she was beginning to
  realise the great forces which must eventually draw them apart, the grim
  possibility that her association with him, her knowledge of his affairs,
  might before long become the measure of her usefulness to her own people, its
  betrayal the sacrifice she might have to offer to her own future. Was he
  perhaps in some respects different to her preconceived ideas? He was an
  idealist without a doubt. His two books on Russia, written before his
  political prominence, every line of which she had read, were supreme evidence
  of it. But of his private life she knew very little. There was only her own
  observation and instinct to guide her. In the foreground of the picture of
  him which had somehow grown up in her mind, that long glove, the crushed
  flowers, and the scented cigarette-tips were like an ugly blur.</p>

  <p>When Samara returned from his walk, he found Catherine seated at her
  typewriter finishing the copying of some reports on which she had been
  engaged before she had left. The room had been put in order and swept, the
  windows were wide open. On the table, however, the glove still remained and
  the little ash- tray of cigarette-ends. He banged the door behind him, came
  over to her side and shook her hand.</p>

  <p>"Congratulations, my wonderful emissary," he declared, with one of his
  rare smiles. "I defied all diplomatic usage and you have justified me. An
  hour ago I received a cable with the names of the commission. They start on
  Thursday week."</p>

  <p>"I am glad," she said.</p>

  <p>He stood away from her for a moment, looking over her head out of the
  window.</p>

  <p>"Everything is now in trim," he continued. "We leave here on Wednesday.
  The Duma is summoned for the following Tuesday. I shall announce to the
  representatives my intentions with regard to the army, issue an authorised
  edict the following day and commence demobilisation the next week. Your
  adopted country-people are prompt in their payments. We have already ten
  millions of American dollars in the Treasury, and Argoff, my Minister for
  Home Affairs, is collecting a staff to open three of the Southern Silver
  Mines."</p>

  <p>"You have no fear, then," she inquired, "but that the Duma will agree with
  your policy?"</p>

  <p>He laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"Wait until you have lived a year in Russia," he said, "and you will not
  ask that question. The Russian of to-day means well enough, but he has little
  mind. The Bolshevists have crushed that. All that he asks is to be led."</p>

  <p>"So that you are, in point of fact, almost a dictator," she remarked.</p>

  <p>"So much the better for Russia if I am," he answered shortly. "No one
  knows better what is good for her. No," he went on, "all the opposition will
  come from outside, and who cares? They think I don't realise it. Idiots!"</p>

  <p>She glanced at him questioningly. He walked to the mantelpiece, struck a
  match and lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"They think I don't know what was at the back of their minds, those others
  who rattle their war sabres so foolishly!" he exclaimed. "Russian armies,
  poor, patient Russian peasants, trained so zealously and carefully, not for
  their country's defence, but to play the mercenary on foreign soil, to be
  pushed to the front in dangerous places, that German soldiers might be
  spared! They are furious here. Von Hartsen scarcely leaves me. He has tried
  everything&mdash; argument, menace, bribes."</p>

  <p>He ceased his restless perambulations and came back to her side. His eyes
  fell upon the glove and the little ash-tray of cigarette-tips. He scowled at
  them for a moment.</p>

  <p>"The evidences of my profligacy," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"I had noticed them," Catherine acknowledged. "I am rather sorry that she
  smokes scented cigarettes."</p>

  <p>"Foul things," he assented. "Still, I suppose women must have their
  whims."</p>

  <p>She recommenced her typing. He stopped her with an impatient protest.</p>

  <p>"Don't do that," he exclaimed. "It's time for lunch. We'll go out
  somewhere. Get your hat."</p>

  <p>"The persuasiveness of your invitation," she murmured, "almost carries me
  off my feet."</p>

  <p>"Don't be sarcastic," he replied. "I want to talk to you."</p>

  <p>"What about?"</p>

  <p>He pointed to the glove.</p>

  <p>"About that."</p>

  <p>Catherine knew that she was losing an opportunity, but nevertheless she
  yielded. She should have laughed at the idea that the presence of the glove
  might in any way interest her. She did nothing of the sort. She went meekly
  to her room, put on her most becoming hat and walked by Samara's side across
  the square.</p>

  <p>"So you want to know about the glove, eh?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>She looked around at the people sipping their <i>ap&eacute;ritifs</i>
  under the umbrella-tented tables and listened for a moment to the music.</p>

  <p>"Does it need an explanation?" she asked. "I suppose you're very much like
  other men and the atmosphere of this place is a little relaxing."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you find it so then?" he demanded. "Nothing seems to change
  you. From whom did you inherit your magnificent imperturbability?"</p>

  <p>She smiled. Her own moment had arrived.</p>

  <p>"How you misjudge me!" she sighed. "As a matter of fact, I have been
  behaving rather badly myself."</p>

  <p>"That young princeling," he muttered furiously. "I saw him on the
  train."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"He came all the way to England entirely on my account," she confided.
  "Not only that, but I dined alone with him at Maridge's in London."</p>

  <p>"A nice sort of diplomatic envoy you are," he scoffed. "Did you take him
  with you to Downing Street?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be absurd," she replied. "I devoted to him only my moments of
  frivolity."</p>

  <p>Samara remained for a few moments in a moody silence. They had reached the
  end of the Arcade and were promptly ushered to a table on the glass- enclosed
  balcony of the famous restaurant. Catherine took off her gloves, looked out
  at the sea, and listened to a violinist in the street below. Notwithstanding
  a slight feeling of depression she felt very kindly towards the world.</p>

  <p>"The glove belonged to Olga Kansky, <i>premi&egrave;re danseuse</i> in the
  Russian Ballet here," her companion confessed abruptly.</p>

  <p>Catherine smiled</p>

  <p>"A Russian!" she exclaimed. "Naturally she had to pay her respects."</p>

  <p>"She came for nothing of the sort," he declared brusquely. "She had supper
  with me here. I invited her to my sitting-room afterwards."</p>

  <p>There was a slight change in Catherine's manner. Her tone became almost
  haughty. She looked at her <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> with slightly upraised
  eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"There are some situations," she reminded him coldly, "which do not
  require explanation."</p>

  <p>"This one does," he retorted. "Especially to you, as you are in a measure
  responsible for what happened."</p>

  <p>"Surely my own sins," she began&mdash;</p>

  <p>"In plain words," he interrupted, "I found that I was thinking a great
  deal too much about you. I don't want to think too much about any woman,
  especially one of your type. I have my own theories about the place for women
  in the world. I meant to carry them out. That is why I invited Olga Kansky to
  supper."</p>

  <p>"And did you&mdash;carry them out?" she asked breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"A ridiculous attack of sentimentality," he confessed. "Just a
  memory&mdash;a windy night, the boom of the sea, a moment of accursed
  opportunity. I wanted to kiss Olga Kansky&mdash;I couldn't."</p>

  <p>Catherine laughed, without changing a muscle of her face&mdash;laughed
  inwardly, conscious of an unreasonable joy.</p>

  <p>"You kissed me quite nicely," she reflected demurely.</p>

  <p>"That was the madness of a moment," he declared. "It will not happen
  again."</p>

  <p>"I wonder," she speculated.</p>

  <p>"You need not. I am no woman worshipper, but I know how to tabulate them.
  You suit me as a secretary. You don't fit elsewhere. That's the end of that!
  Olga Kansky leaves for Nice to-morrow. Tell me about the Prime Minister."</p>

  <p>Their conversation drifted away from the personal note. As they lingered
  over their coffee however, she brought it back.</p>

  <p>"You are rather a fraud, you know," she said.</p>

  <p>"How?" he asked suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"You allot women their place in life&mdash;a very inferior place&mdash;and
  when you meet any one who deserves something better you pretend not to
  recognise the fact. You know very well that I was not made to be any one's
  plaything. Why am I not worthy to be a companion?"</p>

  <p>He watched his glass filled with old brandy&mdash;held it out for a double
  portion&mdash;then he selected the strongest cigar he could find. Before
  lighting it he leaned across the table.</p>

  <p>"I find you companionable," he admitted. "I treat you as a companion. If I
  needed a plaything, I should look elsewhere."</p>

  <p>"In plain words," she observed, "when you seek recreation you walk in the
  garden where only exotics grow, like Olga Kansky."</p>

  <p>"I hate allegories," he growled. "In plain words, I intend neither to
  marry nor to give any woman that place in my life which might be the
  equivalent of marriage."</p>

  <p>Catherine was looking out of the window. The train from Paris had just
  arrived. The buses were beginning to rumble up the hill. A young man passed,
  seated in a little carriage. Catherine smiled. She had recognised Prince
  Frederick.</p>

  <p>"My fate," she murmured, motioning downwards. "I really believe he has
  followed me back again. I adore perseverance and, after all, I suppose even a
  Kaiserin gets some fun out of life!"</p>

  <p>The conclusion of luncheon brought a pleasant surprise to Catherine. At
  the end of the Arcade a powerful motor-car was standing, into which Samara
  ushered her.</p>

  <p>"You have seen nothing of this country," he said. "I have a fancy to take
  you to a spot of my own discovery."</p>

  <p>"This makes me very happy," Catherine acknowledged, with a grateful smile.
  "Like every one else in my adopted country, I am a born tourist."</p>

  <p>They turned a little towards Mentone, mounted to the clouds and paused for
  a moment at the summit of a parapeted road. Catherine looked downwards at the
  panorama below with amazed delight; Samara, with unassumed indifference.</p>

  <p>"It is wonderful," he admitted, with a note almost of tolerance in his
  tone. "Here and there in wilder countries nature has distorted landscape into
  even more majestic outlines, but here comes the touch of humanity to
  interpose a strange element. It is man with his craving for luxury, not his
  desire for the beautiful, who has dotted these hills with villas, planted
  exotic gardens and brought his yachts through the storm into the harbour
  there. Marvellous, of course, beautiful in its way, but with the slur of
  paganism everywhere, the note of theatricality, from the gingerbread
  structure of the temple of men's need to the lights and shadows which play
  beneath the clouds on the mountains behind. Perhaps you don't see it as I do.
  Why should you? Now I shall take you to the place I love."</p>

  <p>"Sometimes I wonder," she said thoughtfully, as they went on their way,
  "whether I am not more of a pagan than you. You keep your real self so well
  hidden. Those gardens, for instance, to which you pointed a little
  scornfully. I worship their masses of colour and forget the twenty gardeners
  who toiled to produce the effect. And against that blue sea even the Casino
  itself appeals to me&mdash;perhaps to my sense of humour more than anything
  else, but it pleases me."</p>

  <p>He looked at her with an unusually kind smile.</p>

  <p>"There is the difference of a whole cycle of humanity between us," he
  reminded her, his voice growing a little sad as he proceeded. "You are
  younger even than your years&mdash;you have lived behind the high fences. I
  am older than mine, because life came to me in strong doses before I had time
  to make up my mind how to deal with it."</p>

  <p>They descended to the sea-level, passed through Nice with its amazing,
  flamboyant loveliness, through the old, mysterious, disreputable, picturesque
  town of Cagnes, and turned to the right along a narrower road which wound its
  way into the bosom of softer hills than those which towered upon Monte Carlo.
  Here were vineyards, and many small homesteads, planted around with olive
  trees, each with their strip of meadow and arable land, and a sheltered
  corner in which grew a little clump of orange and sometimes lemon trees. The
  soil became redder, the grass greener. To Catherine it seemed that there was
  a gentler quality in the air, something more languorous than the keen
  atmosphere of the rockbound principality. Then the car drew up at a bend in
  the road a few kilometres above a quaint, tumble-down stone village. Samara
  alighted.</p>

  <p>"Just a yard or two this way," he invited.</p>

  <p>She followed him along a short cypress grove, scrambled up a knoll
  fragrant with the perfume of late mimosas, and uttered a little cry of
  delight. A short distance away was an old white stone house, half villa, half
  ch&acirc;teau, with close-drawn green shutters and a familiar tower at either
  end. It faced due south and one side was covered with wistaria and drooping
  magenta bougainvilia. Such gardens as there had been had run riot, but there
  was still a wealth of roses growing promiscuously with the olive trees and
  the mimosa right up to the edge of the vineyard which stretched towards the
  valley. Inland, a range of fertile hills with many small villages clustered
  in their clefts, rose to the skies, and beyond towered the pale outline of
  the snow- capped Italian Alps. A vista of meadowland and vineyard, of small
  homesteads and picturesque groups of farm buildings, stretched down to the
  old town of Cagnes itself, standing upon its pedestal of rock, unreal in the
  grey perfection of its rugged outline. And beyond, the great foreground of
  the Mediterranean, blue and placid. Something different from the ordinary
  light of admiration crept into Catherine's eyes as they wandered over the old
  house and lingered lovingly upon the tangled masses of flowers.</p>

  <p>"I did not understand you a few minutes ago," she confessed. "I do now. I
  think that this is more beautiful than anything I have ever seen."</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"I am not sure," he confided, "that there is not poison in this
  atmosphere. I came here by accident, with a fever of fighting in my blood,
  scheme after scheme forming in my brain&mdash;for Russia, for the
  world&mdash;and before I had been here half an hour I felt something of the
  spell of the lotus-eaters numbing my brain. I found myself
  speculating&mdash;wondering whether it was all worth while, how far one must
  travel through the toil of life before rest came. It was because this place
  spelt rest for me&mdash;spelt it differently, spelt it without ignominy,
  spelt it with beauty instead of sloth. Peace, after all, is the end of all of
  us."</p>

  <p>She was more moved than she had believed possible.</p>

  <p>"It seems so strange to hear you talk like that," she murmured. "You,
  Samara, the man of action, the ruler of a nation, with a great fight looming
  up before you."</p>

  <p>"Have I ever told you?" he asked&mdash;"I forget. I believe in God. This
  might be His compensation for failure."</p>

  <p>She was too bewildered to speak, but curiously conscious of an utterly
  untranslatable emotion. He turned away after a farewell glance around.</p>

  <p>"And so," he went on, as he led her back to the car, "I did perhaps the
  strangest thing I have ever done in life. I found this place for sale and I
  bought it. I signed the papers this morning. We walk down my own avenue, and
  I will give you," he concluded, stooping and picking a rose from a bush which
  had clambered half-way up an olive tree, "the first rose from my garden."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch21"
     id="ch21">CHAPTER XXI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">On the afternoon of the day fixed for their departure Samara
  was wandering aimlessly around and Catherine was screwing up her typewriter
  in the sitting-room, when the floor waiter knocked at the door and announced
  a visitor. General von Hartsen, who had followed close behind the waiter,
  entered and bowed stiffly.</p>

  <p>"Come to bid me a last farewell, General?" Samara asked.</p>

  <p>"You will excuse me, sir, but my visit is not to you," was the unexpected
  reply. "Pending an official response to the queries which I have placed
  before your Government, I have nothing more to say."</p>

  <p>"Not to me?" Samara repeated. "To what, then, do I owe the honour of this
  visit?"</p>

  <p>"My visit is to mademoiselle," the General announced.</p>

  <p>Catherine looked up from her work a little unwillingly.</p>

  <p>"To me?"</p>

  <p>Von Hartsen bowed once more.</p>

  <p>"If Mr. Samara permits," he continued, "I shall be glad of five minutes'
  conversation."</p>

  <p>"What sublime effrontery!" Samara exclaimed. "Do you want to suborn my
  secretary before my face?"</p>

  <p>"My visit is not political," the General confided, "but I confess that it
  would give me greater satisfaction to pursue it in your absence."</p>

  <p>Samara was in an evil mood. The trivial business of preparing for
  departure had irritated him and he had other causes for self-dissatisfaction.
  He turned on his heel and, without a word, marched through the connecting
  door into his bedroom.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Samara is not in a very good temper," Von Hartsen observed. "He would
  perhaps be in a worse one if he know the object of my visit."</p>

  <p>"Won't you sit down?" Catherine invited.</p>

  <p>The General shook his head. He moved, however, to the further end of the
  room, and stood upon the hearth-rug. One could almost hear the clank of his
  sabre as he walked. Without uniform he seemed somehow an unreal figure.</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle," he said, "I am an ambassador."</p>

  <p>"The prince?" Catherine asked calmly.</p>

  <p>"Precisely."</p>

  <p>Catherine continued her task of opening the drawers and collecting her
  oddments of stationery.</p>

  <p>"You won't mind my doing this whilst you talk, will you?" she begged. "Our
  train leaves at three o'clock."</p>

  <p>"It is part of the object of my visit," the General pointed out, "to
  persuade you not to take that train."</p>

  <p>"But I must," she replied. "All our arrangements are made. We are going
  straight through to Moscow."</p>

  <p>"I am in hopes that if you give a favourable hearing to my mission," the
  General persisted, "you will not go to Russia at all."</p>

  <p>"A plot?" she inquired.</p>

  <p>"Scarcely that," he protested. "On behalf of my ward, Prince Frederick of
  Wehrenzollern, I have the honour to ask for your hand in marriage."</p>

  <p>Catherine shut her despatch-box with a click.</p>

  <p>"You know all about me, then," she said coolly.</p>

  <p>"Prince Frederick has confided in me. I should like to point out to you
  that my young ward is making you this proposal entirely from reasons of
  sentiment. He is, if I may say so, very greatly attracted. Since your first
  coming here, he whom I have always found so docile, has been entirely
  unmanageable. It was the wish of his friends that he should marry Princess
  Freda of Bavaria. Up till now he has been acquiescent. Last night,
  extravagant though his language was, he convinced me that the scheme had
  better be abandoned."</p>

  <p>"Is she anything like her pictures?" Catherine asked.</p>

  <p>"The Princess is personable," was the somewhat brusque reply.</p>

  <p>"She doesn't look it," Catherine declared. "I should have said that she
  was fat."</p>

  <p>"It is to be admitted," the General acknowledged, "that she has not Your
  Highness' claims to good looks."</p>

  <p>Catherine frowned angrily and glanced towards the door through which
  Samara had disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Please do not address me in such a way again," she requested. "My name is
  Catherine Borans and I am a typist whom Mr. Samara has brought home from New
  York. I prefer for the present to remain as such. As for Prince Frederick's
  offer, I beg leave to decline it."</p>

  <p>"To decline it?" the General exclaimed in amazement.</p>

  <p>"Precisely. Life in Berlin as the wife of a banker would not amuse
  me."</p>

  <p>The General looked quickly round the room as though to be sure that there
  was no possibility of their being overheard.</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle," he said, dropping his voice a little, "there are great
  things afoot in Europe. It is not Prince Frederick's destiny to remain for
  ever a banker in Berlin. There is no man in this world with such a
  future!"</p>

  <p>Catherine shook her head doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"I do not think that you will ever be able to restore the monarchy in
  Germany," she declared.</p>

  <p>Von Hartsen smiled a smile of supreme confidence.</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle," he assured her, "it is as good as done."</p>

  <p>"You dazzle me," Catherine observed, with irony so faint that her visitor
  was unable to detect it. "Kaiserin of Germany! It is hard to refuse."</p>

  <p>"It is impossible to refuse," the General persisted.</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped her.</p>

  <p>"Let me complete my mission," he begged. "For the first time Russia and
  Europe generally has been made aware of the existence of Prince Nicholas of
  Imanoff. That young man has never apparently visited his native country. He
  is unknown to the people&mdash;unregarded. Prince Frederick, on the other
  hand, has been brought up in his own country. He is a democrat, seemingly,
  and one of the most popular young men in Germany."</p>

  <p>"You are trying to point out to me, I suppose," Catherine said, "that
  whereas Prince Frederick has every chance of becoming Kaiser of Germany,
  Prince Nicholas has no chance whatever of becoming Tzar of Russia."</p>

  <p>"That is the truth," Von Hartsen insisted. "Prince Nicholas has no hold
  upon the affections of his people, and except in the army there is no
  Royalist following in Russia. The only chance Prince Nicholas would have
  would be if he remained friends with Frederick. Then, in the future, who can
  tell what might happen?"</p>

  <p>Catherine smiled.</p>

  <p>"Subtly put, General," she acknowledged, "but I am afraid that I can do no
  more than repeat my first answer."</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"You see," Catherine continued, "notwithstanding the Russian blood in my
  veins, I was brought up and educated in America. I have earned my own living
  there. I have caught something of the spirit of the country. I should not
  dream for a moment of marrying any man for whom I had no affection. Prince
  Frederick has inspired me with no such sentiment."</p>

  <p>The General looked at her steadfastly.</p>

  <p>"It is strange," he muttered, "to hear one of your race speak in such a
  fashion."</p>

  <p>"Times change, General," she reminded him. "To-day the pomp of life
  appeals less; the desire for decorous living appeals more. I am a Royalist by
  instinct and conviction, but I should never share even a throne with a man
  whom I did not love."</p>

  <p>"This Nicholas," the General began&mdash;</p>

  <p>The typewriter and despatch-box were there, but Miss Catherine Borans had
  vanished from the face of the earth. It was the Princess who corrected her
  visitor.</p>

  <p>"General," she pronounced, "the interview is at an end. I hope that next
  time I meet Prince Frederick this matter will have been forgotten."</p>

  <p>Samara came out from his room, wearing his travelling coat and carrying
  his hat.</p>

  <p>"Still here, General?" he said. "You'll have to excuse us. The omnibus is
  waiting below."</p>

  <p>A gleam of malice shone in the General's face. He realised Samara's
  ignorance.</p>

  <p>"I thank you for your consideration, Mr. Samara," he said. "I need not
  detain either of you any longer. I am sorry to tell you that my errand was in
  vain."</p>

  <p>"What errand?" Samara demanded.</p>

  <p>"I am here on behalf of Prince Frederick of Wehrenzollern," the General
  explained. "I was the bearer of a proposal of marriage which I regret to say
  that Her Highness has declined."</p>

  <p>"Her Highness?" Samara repeated. "What the devil do you mean?"</p>

  <p>Von Hartsen's expression of surprise was excellently simulated.</p>

  <p>"It is incredible," he exclaimed, "that you have not discovered the
  identity of this young lady! I have the honour, then, to present you to the
  Princess Catherine Helena Zygoff, Grand Duchess of Urulsk, Countess of
  Borans, and hereditary ruler of the lands of Utoff."</p>

  <p>Samara stood perfectly still. His eyes were fixed upon Catherine's face.
  She smiled at him very pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"Rather too bad of the General to give me away like this," she complained.
  "I hope you don't mind."</p>

  <p>"One accepts the inevitable," he answered coldly.</p>

  <p>"Her Highness has just refused the hand of Prince Frederick of
  Wehrenzollern," the General continued. "It would be interesting to learn her
  future plans."</p>

  <p>Catherine picked up her despatch-box and laid her fingers lightly upon
  Samara's arm.</p>

  <p>"My dear General," she said, "I must congratulate you on your acquaintance
  with my titles, which you have remembered more or less correctly, but I am
  also Miss Catherine Borans from the Weltmore Typewriting Bureau, temporary
  secretary to Mr. Samara. I think," she went on, looking up at her companion,
  "we ought to hurry, or we shall miss the train."</p>

  <p>"You mean that you are coming with me?" Samara demanded.</p>

  <p>"Coming?" she repeated. "Of course I am. We mustn't forget to send them up
  for the typewriter. Good-bye, General."</p>

  <p>Von Hartsen gazed across at her fiercely.</p>

  <p>"So you are a renegade," he muttered.</p>

  <p>Once again he sank into insignificance at her parting glance.</p>

  <p>"I have been brought up in a country," she replied, "where a girl learns
  to think and act for herself and men do not insult women!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch22"
     id="ch22">CHAPTER XXII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Nicholas, with his guide and counsellor, Boris Kirdorff,
  stood upon the balcony of an apartment on the third floor of Berlin's premier
  hotel and gazed downwards at the swaying crowds. In the distance a flag was
  flying from the roof of the Reichstag building. There was a general air of
  holiday-making. Nicholas, who was a little bored, yawned.</p>

  <p>"Do you know," he asked, "why Von Hartsen was so anxious for us to stay
  over for the day?"</p>

  <p>"I have an idea," his companion admitted. "I am not sure. That is his
  knock, however. He will probably explain."</p>

  <p>He stepped back into the room and met the General who had just been
  ushered in. The three men stood together upon the balcony, the newcomer in
  the middle. The pavements below were crowded. Policemen of decidedly military
  appearance were riding back and forth. Occasionally a car passed down the
  middle of the guarded way, greeted now and then with a faint murmur of
  applause.</p>

  <p>"You would like to understand, perhaps," Von Hartsen said, "why I have
  persuaded you to remain here till to-morrow morning's boat to Moscow. Well, I
  will tell you. I will tell you because there is something which I wish to
  point out to you which is in a sense an allegory to all of us. To-day, as you
  may know, is the opening of the Reichstag."</p>

  <p>Kirdorff nodded.</p>

  <p>"So much as that we know," he admitted. "To follow your politics, however,
  seems almost impossible. You appear to have seven parties struggling all
  against the other, of whom the socialists, who were once the strongest, have
  become the weakest. How can you form a coherent government with such a
  muddle?"</p>

  <p>Von Hartsen smiled.</p>

  <p>"You ask a sage question," he said. "Many of the shrewdest men in Germany
  are asking the same. The parties will not coalesce. Only one unification is
  possible."</p>

  <p>"And that?" Nicholas asked.</p>

  <p>"Wait," was the prompt rejoinder. "Now listen. Here is the automobile of
  Herr Mayer, the leader of the socialist party, once the most popular man in
  Germany. See to-day how the people greet him."</p>

  <p>The car rolled by, the man who was its solitary occupant&mdash;elderly,
  grey and worn&mdash;looking neither to the right nor the left, seated with
  folded arms as one who faces an ordeal. Here and there was a faint murmur of
  applause; here and there distinct hisses. Of enthusiasm there was none at
  all.</p>

  <p>"There passes a grave danger," Von Hartsen declared. "Twenty-five years
  ago, during the aftermath of the Great War, the socialists came rapidly to
  the front in the country. They reached the zenith of their power in nineteen-
  thirty. Since then their influence has steadily declined. To-day they are a
  forgotten force. Watch again. Here comes the automobile of the President. He
  is fairly popular. Is there a single real shout of welcome? Watch the
  people's faces. Who amongst them cares whether that man comes or goes?"</p>

  <p>The car proceeded on its way. Many hats were lifted to its occupant, but,
  although there was all the time an undertone of applause, again there was no
  enthusiasm. These were the involuntary marks of respect paid by a law-abiding
  nation to its ruler. A dozen other cars passed by, containing deputies from
  various political parties. Some were greeted in silence; some with a few
  courteous salutations; one or two with a little hum of interest. Then Von
  Hartsen leaned forward.</p>

  <p>"The Prime Minister of Germany," he announced. "The leader of our
  Government. He rides to his doom&mdash;his political doom, that is to
  say."</p>

  <p>Again hats were raised here and there, but a stony silence prevailed. Then
  came a new type of deputy&mdash;a General wearing his uniform, seated upright
  in his car, with his fingers resting as though by accident upon his
  sword.</p>

  <p>"The Baron von Elderman!" Von Hartsen exclaimed. "Listen! Watch the
  people!"</p>

  <p>A little forest of heads were uncovered and hats waved. This time there
  was a real hoarse murmur of applause. More than once the General saluted in
  response to the greetings.</p>

  <p>"The Baron," Von Hartsen explained, "is Commander-in-Chief of the German
  armies. He is also deputy and leader of the monarchist party&mdash;so far as
  we permit it to be known that there is a monarchist party. Does it seem
  strange to you that republican Germany should find applause for him that it
  denies to all others?"</p>

  <p>"Republican Germany is a misnomer," Kirdorff declared. "The soul of
  Germany has never been with the Republic."</p>

  <p>"You speak well," was the other's solemn admission.</p>

  <p>A few more cars passed, attracting varying degrees of notice. Then, from
  the distance, came a volume of welcoming voices, swelling into a roar of
  enthusiasm. At last the people were moved. Down the middle of the avenue came
  a single open motor-car, in which was seated a young man in uniform,
  alone.</p>

  <p>"Frederick!" Nicholas exclaimed. "What does he do here?"</p>

  <p>"He was elected a deputy only a few weeks ago," Von Hartsen explained. "He
  is coming to take his seat."</p>

  <p>"But in uniform!" Nicholas muttered. "I thought that was prohibited."</p>

  <p>"He is wearing only the uniform of a Cadet Corps," the General pointed
  out. "Strictly speaking, it is against the law. We risk it. Listen to the
  people! What do you think that means?"</p>

  <p>The applause was almost deafening; coming nearer and nearer like an
  inbreaking wave. Kirdorff's pallid face had become set and rigid. There was a
  streak of colour in Nicholas' cheeks. The car passed like a flash below and
  went on its way. Every moment or so the young man inside raised his right
  hand to the salute.</p>

  <p>"For you," Kirdorff declared, "it can mean but one thing. It means the
  return of the great days. If Berlin can speak like that, what of the rest of
  Prussia?"</p>

  <p>Von Hartsen smiled once more as he turned away from the window.</p>

  <p>"It is finished," he announced. "We shall find wine in the further room.
  It was to see what you have seen that I begged you to stay over. What is
  coming in Germany," he went on earnestly, "can come also in Russia. We are
  willing to help, but, like every one else in the world, we have our price. A
  glass of wine with you, gentlemen. Afterwards I myself must go to the
  Reichstag."</p>

  <p>They passed into an inner room where refreshments were handed round. When
  the glasses were filled, Von Hartsen briefly dismissed the waiters.</p>

  <p>"Listen," he began, as soon as they were alone, "I do not promise that I
  myself can do for you, Nicholas Imanoff, what I have done for Frederick, but
  I can put you in the way of doing it for yourself. The seeds are already
  sown. To- day, in your First and Second Armies there is an active monarchist
  propaganda going on hour by hour. Samara knows it well enough&mdash;hence his
  hurried return from America. It is not altrusim alone which has influenced
  him in this great scheme of demilitarisation. It is because he knows that if
  ever the monarchy is restored to Russia it will be through the army. You have
  permission to return, Prince Nicholas?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," the young man assented. "We all have&mdash;even
  Orenburg."</p>

  <p>"It is a brave step of Samara's; I think a foolish one. Since you have the
  chance, however, show yourself openly everywhere. Ask Samara's permission to
  join the army. The whole machinery of propaganda is there. There is no reason
  why Russia should not revert to the only logical form of government within a
  year from to-day."</p>

  <p>"You spoke of a price for your aid," Kirdorff reminded him.</p>

  <p>"Naturally. Germany is suffering from peace. She needs war. We need your
  First and Second Armies before Samara can disband them."</p>

  <p>Nicholas frowned.</p>

  <p>"How can anyone of my race," he asked, "draw his sword against
  France?"</p>

  <p>"It might happen," Von Hartsen replied, "that if you were not prepared to
  do so, you might have no sword to draw. But consider&mdash;the France of to-
  day has nothing in common with the France who was once your great ally. She
  is avaricious to a degree. Ascend the throne, re-establish imperial rule in
  Russia, and, before a month has passed, France will claim from you countless
  milliards, the whole debt of your country to her. The Alliance, now that
  Austria has passed away, has ceased to exist. Discard it! Germany and Russia
  are natural and inevitable allies. Make up your mind to it!"</p>

  <p>A cannon sounded from somewhere in the neighbourhood. Von Hartsen finished
  his wine hastily.</p>

  <p>"This is a great day for Germany," he concluded. "I must be there to see
  Prince Frederick take his seat. Deputy to-day; what he pleases by this time
  next year! Listen to me now and remember my words. The people will be ruled.
  No democrat has ever learned the art of kingship. Republics have made laws.
  They have never governed. It is the will of the people which is calling
  Frederick back to the throne of his ancestors."</p>

  <p>He hurried off, leaving behind him a queer sense of excitement. Kirdorff's
  eyes were glittering. Nicholas seemed transformed.</p>

  <p>"The will of the people!" he repeated ecstatically. "We, too, shall hear
  that call, Kirdorff! From Berlin to Odensk is not so far!"</p>

  <h2><a id="book2">BOOK TWO</a></h2>

  <h2><a name="ch23"
     id="ch23">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Catherine paused for a moment in her task, listened, rose to
  her feet and moved towards the window. She was in a plain official-looking
  apartment, separated by a glass partition from many others upon the same
  floor. She might really have been working in the American office of some
  great mercantile undertaking. She was, as a matter of fact, on the top storey
  of a building in a Square of Moscow, given over to the Foreign Department of
  the Russian Government and entitled Government Buildings. It was exactly
  fourteen months since she had arrived in Moscow from Monte Carlo.</p>

  <p>Down in the Square a great crowd of people had gathered, and through them
  marched, still in fours, but without any attempt at military discipline, a
  long line of men in ordinary civilian clothes. Here and there the spectators
  raised their hats; now and then came a wave of applause. As they passed the
  house at the corner of the Square, which was Samara's official residence,
  many of the marchers paused and looked upwards with something which was
  equivalent to a salute.</p>

  <p>Andrew Kroupki, on his way to his office, saw Catherine standing by the
  window, hesitated for a moment, then entered and crossed the room towards
  her. He had recovered from his illness, but he had still the air of an
  invalid; tall and thin, with sunken cheeks, a mass of black hair&mdash;a
  typical visionary. She greeted him with a little nod.</p>

  <p>"What does it mean, Andrew?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Before he could reply, Bromley Pride had joined them, his keen, clean-
  shaven face alight with interest, restless as ever, swinging his
  tortoise-shell spectacles in his hand, apologising for his cigar and pointing
  out of the window in the same moment.</p>

  <p>"Pride knows more about it all than I do," Andrew declared. "At any rate
  he is more up-to-date. I have been in Warsaw for three weeks&mdash;three
  dreary weeks," he added, dropping his voice a little and glancing appealingly
  at Catherine.</p>

  <p>"Is it really so long?" she observed indifferently. "Well, that accounts
  for my having got a little behind the times. I have had your work to do as
  well as my own."</p>

  <p>"I know all about these fellows," Pride declared, moving closer to
  Catherine's side and pointing downwards. "They are the last of Russia's Third
  Army. Yesterday they came up from barracks, marched over to the other side of
  the city, left their uniforms, were provided with civilian clothes, and now
  they are on their way to their jobs, wherever they may be. The last of a
  million men, Miss Borans! A wonderful piece of administration!"</p>

  <p>Catherine, standing between the two men, watched the crowds with interest.
  There was a brief silence whilst they listened to the tumult shouting and
  cheering.</p>

  <p>"It's a fine view, this," Pride continued. "It works in with the stuff I
  am writing. Do you know, Miss Borans, they sent me over here to see whether
  Samara could pull this thing through&mdash;and he's done it! There isn't a
  statesman in our country or in Europe either could have tackled the
  proposition. It isn't much more than a year since he issued the first notice
  and came over to New York to borrow the money, and since then he's just taken
  a million men from shiftless and unproductive idleness and got 'em all
  working like bees in a hive. If that isn't a triumph I'd like to meet one.
  I'm going to shake hands with President Samara to-night and tell him what I
  think of it."</p>

  <p>"Are you going to the banquet?" Catherine inquired.</p>

  <p>"I should say so!" was the emphatic reply. "I wouldn't miss it for
  anything. I've heard most of our own great speakers and a good many of the
  Englishmen, but Samara has them beaten to a frazzle. I guess he'll tell us
  to- night a few things that all Europe's waiting to hear."</p>

  <p>"And perhaps he will not," Andrew Kroupki observed drily. "My master tells
  the world too much. He lays the cards too easily upon the table. It is
  magnificent, but sometimes it is not diplomacy."</p>

  <p>"Please go, both of you," Catherine enjoined, turning reluctantly away
  from the window and moving towards her desk. "I have the French President's
  speech in the Chamber last night to translate for Mr. Samara and he wants it
  before this evening."</p>

  <p>"Make me a copy," Pride begged. "I've only seen extracts and my French is
  ghastly."</p>

  <p>"You journalists are much too lazy," she declared. "You'll get it all in
  English to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"To-morrow's no good to me," Pride persisted. "Slip another carbon in your
  machine, Miss Borans. It won't take you any longer. I'll wait till you've
  finished and we'll have a little dinner."</p>

  <p>Catherine shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Impossible," she regretted. "You forget that I am now officially
  recognised as Andrew's assistant in the position of private secretary to Mr.
  Samara. I couldn't possibly be seen dining with an American journalist who is
  reputed to give pearl necklaces, motorcars or millions for news."</p>

  <p>"Bunkum!" he scoffed. "You've got another date."</p>

  <p>"That may be," Catherine sighed gently. "I am much sought after. I'll make
  you a copy of the speech, Mr. Pride, but you mustn't take it as a precedent.
  Andrew, please come in and see me before you go. I shall want you to take
  these notes to Mr. Samara."</p>

  <p>Andrew made no direct reply beyond a little bow. The two men left the room
  together and paused for a moment in the main corridor of the floor. The
  journalist gazed around with an exclamation of admiration.</p>

  <p>"This is certainly a live place!" he pronounced. "Might be a stock
  operator's paradise in Chicago. What's the kiosk at the far end with the open
  roof and the funnel?"</p>

  <p>"Office to receive and decode private wireless," Andrew explained. "They
  are in direct communication with the Intelligence Department on the floor
  below."</p>

  <p>Pride gripped his companion by the arm tightly.</p>

  <p>"Look here, young man," he said, "I expect you're wise to what I want to
  know. I've got to get my cable off in half-an-hour. Those Englishmen aren't
  over here again for nothing. I want to give them an idea on the other side as
  to whether the President is going to speak about the Second Army
  to-night."</p>

  <p>"You should have asked Miss Borans," Andrew replied, "she is preparing his
  notes."</p>

  <p>"I might as well have asked the sphinx," the other retorted impatiently.
  "That's the worst of a woman. She doesn't think&mdash;she obeys. It can't
  matter a cent to any one whether I am in a position to say that the President
  is going to talk about it or that he isn't&mdash;but you can't get that young
  lady to understand."</p>

  <p>"You've tried her then?"</p>

  <p>Pride shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I did just mention it this afternoon," he admitted. "Nothing doing!"</p>

  <p>"Nor with me," Andrew observed shortly. "The Chief!" he exclaimed, in an
  altered tone. "If he speaks to you, you can ask him for yourself."</p>

  <p>The main door of the hall had been suddenly thrown open by Ivan Rortz,
  admitting Samara. Pride stood to attention respectfully, hoping for a
  salutation, but Samara passed every one with absolutely unseeing eyes. At the
  far end of the broad passage was a heavy oaken door. This, too, Ivan,
  hurrying by his master, opened, and Samara disappeared into his private room.
  The American looked a little disconcerted.</p>

  <p>"No luck!" he grumbled. "I'll have to wait until to-night. For the
  greatest democrat in the world," he went on ruefully, "Samara is a perfect
  wonder at keeping us all just where he wants us."</p>

  <p>"The Chief does everything his own way and it is a good way," Andrew
  declared. "He would never be able to stir a yard if he allowed every one to
  speak to him whenever they chose. Any one from any country in the world may
  obtain an audience with him in due course, but no one may speak to him or
  even recognise him without permission. That is the only way he is able to
  move about amongst us without trouble or hindrance. You'll excuse me, Mr.
  Pride. I've some work which I must hurry on. I did not know that the Chief
  was expected here to- day."</p>

  <p>There came a sudden flash in his eyes and he remained a moment where he
  was, looking through the glass partition into Catherine's office. He saw her
  answer the telephone, replace the instrument, pick up a note-book, and move
  towards the door. He watched her pass along the passage until she reached the
  door of the room which Samara had entered. Ivan, who was standing outside on
  guard, admitted her without question. All the time the American was studying
  his companion.</p>

  <p>"Say, Mr. Kroupki," he observed, "I sometimes wonder whether you ever
  regret that month's illness of yours in New York."</p>

  <p>It was a purposeful stroke, designed to bring about trouble of a certain
  sort. The young man's dark eyes were black pools of anger now, his lips
  quivered. Nevertheless he spoke in a subdued tone.</p>

  <p>"It had to happen," he muttered. "It will not last."</p>

  <p>Without farewell Andrew Kroupki swung abruptly round and disappeared into
  his office. Pride stood for a moment looking after him. Then he, too, turned
  away and opened a door, over which was printed in white letters:</p>

  <p align="center"><i><b>SALON No. II.</b></i></p>

  <p align="center"><b>For Accredited Representatives of the Foreign
  Press.</b></p>

  <p>"A tough job to get a pull here!" he soliloquised, throwing himself into a
  comfortable chair and lighting a cigar. "I've offered to immortalise Samara
  or marry the girl. There seems to be only Andrew left. What about Andrew, I
  wonder?"</p>

  <p>Pride smoked steadily on, his eyes fixed upon the ceiling. He was face to
  face with the eternal problem of his profession. His own instinct had scented
  trouble and brought him to Moscow. He was perfectly convinced that there
  would be news enough and to spare before many months had passed, but news
  which was shared with rivals was to Bromley Pride no news at all. Catherine
  was hopeless, and Samara divulged only what he wished to be known. Complete
  failure was a condition, the possibility of which he never admitted. There
  was still Andrew&mdash; Andrew, impervious to bribes, impeccable at heart,
  but plunged suddenly into a maelstrom of passion!</p>

  <p>"Crazy about the girl and madly jealous of her at the same time," he
  reflected. "Something should come of the combination!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch24"
     id="ch24">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Samara, that afternoon, was for some reason excited. He
  showed it in the manner peculiar to him; his cheeks were a little paler, his
  eyes seemed clearer and filled with sombre fire. He sat upright in his
  high-backed chair, his fingers drumming upon the table in front of him. He
  did not even light a cigarette, generally his first action when he called at
  Government Buildings after leaving the Duma. The box stood by his side
  unnoticed. All the time his fingers tapped the table and his eyes asked
  Catherine questions.</p>

  <p>She had paused upon the threshold after Ivan had closed the door behind
  her. Then she advanced a little farther into the room. Finally, she stood
  almost by his side, her hand resting upon the back of a chair.</p>

  <p>"You sent for me," she reminded him.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he answered. "Sit down."</p>

  <p>She resented his tone, as she frequently did, but in his present mood,
  obedience from others seemed to become automatic and inevitable. She sat down
  and, after a moment or two spent in turning over the pages of her notebook,
  looked up inquiringly.</p>

  <p>"Tell me about your people over here?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"My people!" she murmured.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he went on impatiently. "The Grand Duchess Alexandrina Sophia of
  Kossas, your much-to-be-esteemed aunt, and Kirdorff the Muscovite, the self-
  elected champion of the young man who has left off selling bonds in New York,
  and General Orenburg, the patriarch, and those two others&mdash;the young man
  who was trying to make an honest living selling automobiles, and his sister.
  They are all here, aren't they?"</p>

  <p>"They are all here now," she admitted. "You yourself gave them permission
  to return. Nicholas came first and the others have followed him in
  relays."</p>

  <p>"Where did they get the money from?"</p>

  <p>"Count Sabaroff&mdash;I might, perhaps, call him Cyril, as he is my
  cousin&mdash;is doing exceedingly well selling Ford cars," she announced.
  "His sister has started a milliner's shop."</p>

  <p>Samara laughed shortly&mdash;not altogether pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"A touch of Western democracy come to my capital," he observed. "And the
  others?"</p>

  <p>"Well," she hesitated, "I am not quite sure that I feel free to discuss
  their financial position, even with you."</p>

  <p>"Don't be foolish," he protested. "They have become citizens of my
  republic. I have the right to know all I choose about them&mdash;I and my
  ministers. There is curiosity in certain quarters as to their means of
  livelihood."</p>

  <p>Catherine smiled at him. She was silent for a moment, thinking that she
  rather liked his appearance when he was inclined to be angry; his mouth, hard
  and dominant, his eyes, with all their kindness veiled, keen and insistent,
  his tone the tone of a ruler.</p>

  <p>"I think I shall tell you," she decided. "It may put you in a better
  humour. They are being financed by Mrs. Saxon J. Bossington."</p>

  <p>"What the devil do you mean?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Well, it does sound rather extraordinary, doesn't it?" she continued.
  "Almost like the plot of a musical comedy. There was a wonderful Englishman
  who lived some years ago&mdash;Gilbert, his name was&mdash;who would
  certainly have jumped at the idea. Nevertheless it is true. Mrs. Bossington
  is one of those Western Americans, rapidly becoming extinct, to whom a title
  is as the hallmark of divinity. She advanced the money for every one to come
  back to Moscow and settle down here."</p>

  <p>"On the chance, I suppose," he suggested swiftly, "that some day or other
  they might, under more beneficent legislation, regain their estates and be in
  a position to reward in courtly fashion their generous benefactor."</p>

  <p>"Rather high-flown," Catherine remarked, with a smile, "but still I have
  no doubt that it is a very fair analysis of what is in the back of Mrs.
  Bossington's mind. So far as I am concerned, I am glad that Andrew Kroupki's
  illness gave me an opportunity of getting here without such aid. I strongly
  disapprove of the manner in which some of them&mdash;Nicholas Imanoff in
  particular&mdash; draw upon the Bossington exchequer."</p>

  <p>Samara stretched out his hand, took a cigarette from the box and lit it.
  It was, for him, a good sign.</p>

  <p>"Listen," he said. "I am one of those men who like to move down the
  highway of life alone, but I am always open to the advice of my counsellors,
  who speak to me freely whensoever they choose. Only this afternoon one of my
  ministers, just as I was leaving the Duma, called me into his room. He wished
  to consult me upon no less a matter than you."</p>

  <p>"That meddlesome policeman, I am sure," Catherine sighed. "He dislikes me
  immensely. I had to take him over some reports for you only last week, and he
  seemed shocked to think that I should have been trusted to type them."</p>

  <p>"General Trotsk is no fool," Samara pronounced. "He pointed out to me that
  having succeeded in crushing Communism, there was yet one other danger&mdash;
  less a danger to-day, I believe, than a danger in years to come&mdash;of
  which we must take account. There is no recognised imperialistic party at
  present, but I've a shrewd idea that there's one in embryo. Trotsk goes
  farther than that. He believes that the party is already in existence,
  working chiefly in the great cities and amongst the army, and assisted by
  German agents. Incidentally he asked me frankly whether I thought I was wise
  in having for my trusted secretary a young woman who was in close association
  with the Imperial family of Russia."</p>

  <p>"I think I do the work very well," she said. "Did you explain that you
  took me from the Weltmore Typewriting Agency?"</p>

  <p>"I did. Trotsk suspects that there was a design in your being sent to
  me."</p>

  <p>"Then Ivor Trotsk is wrong," Catherine declared firmly. "I was chosen
  entirely by accident and, to be quite candid, I at first refused to come. If
  you think," she went on, "that my family associations, of which you know more
  than any one, render me unfit to be your secretary, send me away. Andrew
  Kroupki would be very glad so far as the work is concerned."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by 'so far as the work is concerned'?" Samara
  demanded.</p>

  <p>She deliberated for a moment.</p>

  <p>"I begin to think," she confessed, "that notwithstanding your stony
  attitude towards me, I must be quite attractive to a number of male human
  beings. Andrew is very deeply in love with me. I foresee that I shall have
  great difficulty with him."</p>

  <p>"Better tell him the truth about your identity," Samara advised drily.
  "That will cure him."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I am not at all sure that I wish him to be cured," she observed. "Every
  well-brought-up girl expects to have at least one man in love with her. Did
  you send for me, Mr. Samara, merely to tell me of Ivor Trotsk's suspicions,
  or is there any work I can do for you?"</p>

  <p>"I wish to call upon your aunt," Samara announced. "My car is at the door.
  Show me the way, if you please, to where she is living."</p>

  <p>Catherine was a little startled.</p>

  <p>"My aunt will be honoured," she said. "Do I understand that you expect me
  to accompany you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," was the curt reply.</p>

  <p>"Whilst I put my hat on," she suggested, "I wonder whether you would care
  to see Bromley Pride for a moment. He is aching for a word with you."</p>

  <p>"He can come in for three minutes," Samara assented. "Do not keep me
  longer. Tell Ivan as you go out that he can be admitted."</p>

  <p>Catherine left the room a little thoughtfully. She knocked at the glass
  panelling of the office where Pride was sitting. He came out at once, his
  cigar in his hand.</p>

  <p>"I've earned that pearl necklace or whatever it was you hinted at," she
  told him. "The Chief will see you for exactly three minutes. Don't keep him
  any longer. We're going out motoring together."</p>

  <p>Pride laid down his cigar and moved eagerly away.</p>

  <p>"Say, I'm awfully obliged, Miss Borans," he declared. "See you later."</p>

  <p>He hurried off to the audience chamber. Catherine moved towards the
  telephone.</p>

  <p>"What do you want, Pride?" Samara asked, as the journalist entered. "Sit
  down, unless you can talk quicker standing. You can stay for exactly three
  minutes."</p>

  <p>"Standing, please," was the prompt reply. "I've been looking into the
  streets. I saw the last of a million soldiers go their way. What about the
  others?"</p>

  <p>"Read the report of the Peace Conference, Wednesday week," Samara
  suggested. "I am going to London to attend it."</p>

  <p>"I want to know beforehand," the journalist rejoined eagerly. "My paper
  likes definite forecasts. I see those two Englishmen are over here
  again&mdash;Lord Edward Fields and Edgar Hammond. It's their third visit. I
  guess there's something doing this time. Can't you put me wise, Samara, just
  a few hours before the others? We want to be in the know&mdash;not to make
  absolute statements, but to prophesy&mdash;and then to be right."</p>

  <p>"Excellent from the point of view of your paper," Samara observed drily.
  "It doesn't happen to suit me. I can tell you nothing."</p>

  <p>"Not a hint?" Pride persisted.</p>

  <p>"Not a hint. Understand from me now, please, that I have come to the
  conclusion that it would not be in the interests of the Russian Republic for
  word of our projected plans to become public property until I give the
  signal. That's final!"</p>

  <p>Pride sighed.</p>

  <p>"Nothing else for me?" he asked a little wistfully.</p>

  <p>"My God, man, what do you want!" Samara demanded. "Here you are, most
  favoured of all correspondents in the world. You have seen to-day the passing
  of that first million. Can't you write about that? Isn't that dramatic enough
  for you? A million fire-eating monsters dissolved into thin air; a million
  sturdy, self-respecting Russian peasants bending over their toil, earning
  food and dwelling and clothes and savings for their womenkind and children!
  Feet on the earth, head to the skies&mdash;men, not puppets any longer! Go
  and write about it. Finished! Please tell Miss Borans to wait in her office
  until I fetch her."</p>

  <p>Samara waved his visitor away. He never shook hands; seldom indulged in
  the ordinary amenities which pass between men. He spoke for a moment on the
  telephone, frowned and laid down the instrument. Then he took up his hat and
  gloves, left his office and, followed by Ivan, walked rapidly along the broad
  central passage. Catherine was waiting for him on the threshold of her own
  apartment. He motioned her impatiently to step back, entered and closed the
  door behind him.</p>

  <p>"To whom have you been telephoning?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>She looked at him for a moment with immovable face. Then she smiled
  faintly.</p>

  <p>"To my aunt," she replied.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"To tell her to be sure and see that there were hot cakes for tea," she
  confided.</p>

  <p>"You think that I believe that?" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Why not? It happens to be the truth."</p>

  <p>Samara's manner to older women possessed a charm of which he seldom, in
  his general intercourse with the other sex, gave any indication. His bow to
  the Grand Duchess was the bow of a courtier; his few words of welcome were
  admirably spoken. For the first ten minutes no serious subject was mooted. It
  was Alexandrina herself who introduced another note. She was suddenly deeply
  and intensely in earnest.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Samara," she said, "I should like you to know that in making possible
  this return to my own country, you have given an elderly woman the greatest
  happiness life could offer. I recognise the generosity of it. I wish to pay
  my tribute to it. It is not an easy thing for me to say to you, but I do say
  it&mdash;I thank you."</p>

  <p>Samara bowed gravely.</p>

  <p>"Duchess," he pronounced, "it is one of the theories of my life that every
  man and every woman, too, lives more naturally and to the best account in his
  native land."</p>

  <p>He paused for a moment, but was obviously about to continue, when Colonel
  Kirdorff was announced, and immediately afterwards General Orenburg. They
  both welcomed Samara respectfully, but perhaps with some measure of
  constraint. A few minutes later the latter rose to take his leave.</p>

  <p>"My visit," he explained, turning a little towards the newcomers, "was
  intended to be one of courtesy to Her Highness. Since I have been fortunate
  enough to find you, Colonel Kirdorff, and you, General Orenburg, here
  together, let me make further use of it. I want to say that I am happy to
  welcome you back to Russia, and I am glad if I have been able to make your
  coming possible. So long as you all pursue the lives of Russian
  citizens&mdash;you, General, and you Colonel, in the army, and Your Highness
  as a Russian lady of society&mdash;you will, I am sure, find no one to
  venture to interfere with you. But I rule, not for myself, but for my people,
  and I tell you frankly that my espionage system is good. If I wished, I could
  not exclude you from its activities. I desire, therefore, to give you this
  warning. If by any chance any one of you should be discovered plotting
  against the State, the fact that I brought you here would count for nothing.
  If you enter into any conspiracy of any sort you will be discovered and no
  representations to me would be of the slightest avail. I did not put you on
  your parole when I asked you back. I did not do so purposely. I ask you even
  now for no promises. Live as you think well and shape your futures as you
  choose, but even though mine has the name of being a humane Government, it
  has no mercy upon those who plot against it."</p>

  <p>There was a moment's silence. No one seemed anxious to reply. Samara,
  looking round at their expressionless faces, found his mind wandering off to
  trifles. He realised that the room was small and overheated and the
  atmosphere heavy with the perfume of musk. Alexandrina was wearing an
  unbecoming gown, but some wonderful old jewellery. The two men had changed
  since the New York days. Kirdorff stood differently upon his feet, looked
  differently out of his eyes. The General seemed years younger. As Samara
  watched them, he was conscious that there was a mutual and silent
  understanding between them all from which he was excluded. He glanced swiftly
  at Catherine. She, too, was in it. She was of them- -belonged to them. He was
  a fool to hope even for her fidelity! In the end it was Alexandrina who
  spoke. There was a slight stiffness in her manner. "One might conspire in New
  York," she remarked.</p>

  <p>"In the <i>salon</i> of Mrs. Bossington, perhaps," he scoffed. "Your
  conspiracies there would very surely end in dreams, but to-
  day&mdash;listen&mdash;there is a line which reaches even from this room,
  Madame la Duchesse, to the Headquarters of the Second Army at Odensk. I think
  if I were you I would snap the line."</p>

  <p>Again there was a tense silence in the little room. The two men stood like
  graven images. Alexandrina had picked up a paper fan and was wielding it
  mechanically. Even Catherine seemed for a moment to have lost her <i>savoir
  faire.</i> With a curt little gesture of farewell, Samara took his leave.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch25"
     id="ch25">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Bromley Pride and Andrew Kroupki dined together that evening
  in the Savoy Grill Room&mdash;not the Savoy of the Strand, but the Savoy of a
  certain street leading off one of the newly-developed boulevards in Moscow.
  It was a meal which distinctly lacked all the characteristics of a festival.
  No two personalities in all the city could have been so ill-attuned. Andrew
  was neurotic, almost neurasthenic; distracted at the same time by his passion
  for Catherine and his insane jealousy of her. Bromley Pride, full of vigorous
  common-sense, sane, healthy and indefatigable in his profession, saw life as
  a confirmed materialist, desired only the possible things, and had scant
  sympathy with the emotional wear and tear to which his companion continually
  subjected himself. Nevertheless they ate and drank together and made
  conversation up to a certain point like any other two men brought together in
  the daily affairs of life.</p>

  <p>"One of the by-laws for which I suppose your President is responsible,"
  Pride remarked, tapping the menu which was printed in Russian.</p>

  <p>Andrew glanced at it and nodded.</p>

  <p>"A reasonable edict," he declared. "Any one who chooses may print his wine
  list or menu in French, but it must also be printed in Russian. Why not? We
  are in Moscow. We like French food, we like French wines, but we want to take
  them as Russians, not as French people. A nation may be adaptive and
  appreciative, but must not be coalescent."</p>

  <p>"I guess you're right," Pride admitted. "Russia's a well-governed country
  to-day&mdash;a country with a definite identity. During the last ten years
  you have broken loose from the greatest danger any nation ever experienced.
  You have shaken off German thraldom and German influence."</p>

  <p>"Without warfare, too," Andrew added eagerly. "By just, discriminating
  legislation. The man who makes money in Russia, out of Russian industries or
  Russian mineral wealth, must spend his money here or face a different scale
  of taxation. We have had enough of foreigners tapping our supplies of wealth,
  drawing off the profits and flitting to some other country."</p>

  <p>"Does it ever occur to you," Pride remarked, "that you are gradually
  making an enemy of Germany?"</p>

  <p>"Better that," his companion retorted hotly, "than to be her tame monkey,
  ready to pull the chestnuts out of the fire when she gave the word. That is
  what we were under the Communists. Five years more of their government and
  the Germans would have marched our armies from Russia to the French frontier
  and not a soul could have stopped them."</p>

  <p>"And now," Pride observed, "it seems that you will very soon have no
  armies to march anywhere."</p>

  <p>"Why should we need armies?" Andrew demanded. "Invasion of our country is
  no longer to be feared. The Peace Conference has tied most of the nations of
  the world hand and foot. Germany, through her own cunning, remains outside,
  but what would it profit her to cross our frontiers? Where would she strike,
  at what, and with what object? The frontiers of France have been a brazen
  defiance to Germany for fifty years. All her coal-fields, her manufacturing
  towns, her winegrowing districts are there, like Naboth's vineyard&mdash;a
  stone's throw across the frontier for jealous eyes to gaze upon. We have
  nothing like that to offer the invader. A military establishment for us is a
  farce."</p>

  <p>"I heard Samara speak at Geneva," Pride remarked drily.</p>

  <p>His companion was unmoved.</p>

  <p>"I plagiarise, I know," he admitted. "Why not? Who can repeat the words of
  a greater man?"</p>

  <p>The restaurant was crowded; noisy with a babel of talk, blue-hung with
  cigarette smoke. In the distance a small orchestra was drowned by the volume
  of conversation. Most of the people were Russian; here and there some
  Germans, an occasional Englishman, a few Americans. Newcomers were still
  arriving. Pride was immensely interested in the passing of a very
  distinguished-looking couple&mdash; a short, dark young man and a young
  woman, a little taller, dressed in black, with a black picture hat and ermine
  wrap, a very graceful carriage, blue eyes with a roving tendency, and
  beautifully marked eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Amazing!" the journalist murmured. "I knew that young man in New
  York&mdash; he was trying to sell Ford motor cars. And the girl&mdash;why,
  she was in a Fifth Avenue milliner's! What on earth has brought them to
  Moscow?"</p>

  <p>Andrew smiled.</p>

  <p>"They are part of the great comedy," he declared. "They own names as long
  as this menu. They are aristocrats of the Russia which has passed away. Yet
  you are quite right. The young man learnt the automobile trade in New York
  and the girl, as you say, was a milliner's assistant. One must
  live!&mdash;even the children of those who escaped from Russia with nothing
  but their lives."</p>

  <p>"What I can't catch on to," Pride confessed, "is what has brought them
  back to Russia? How do they live?"</p>

  <p>"They are back here at Samara's express invitation," Andrew explained. "A
  whole nest of Monarchists! The President has revoked all edicts of banishment
  except against anarchists. He maintains that every Russian is entitled to
  live in his own country and air his own opinions."</p>

  <p>"I guess he's right," the other acknowledged. "They'll do no harm and
  there are not madmen enough left in the world to preach Tzardom here."</p>

  <p>Andrew Kroupki shrugged his shoulders. He drained half the contents of his
  glass before he answered.</p>

  <p>"How can one reckon on anything?" he demanded. "Two generations of
  education have scarcely altered the Russian peasant. He is still the same
  simple, faithful human being; seeking for something in the world or heaven to
  lean against&mdash;a Tzar or a God or anything he can believe in. He isn't
  dangerous like the German mob because you can't appeal to his intellect. You
  can appeal only to his instinct, and I am not so sure as I should like to be
  that his instinct for Tzardom is dead. There are many people, even members of
  the Cabinet, who think that Samara is doing a rash thing in interfering with
  the armies."</p>

  <p>"Precisely why?" Pride asked.</p>

  <p>"For fear he should disturb some smouldering bonfires of royalist
  sentiment," Andrew answered.</p>

  <p>Pride was inclined to be disputatious.</p>

  <p>"A cause," he declared, "needs sinews; money, brains, enthusiasm. Who is
  there in the world who possesses these things likely to devote them to the
  overthrow of such a man as Samara or to placing the country once more under
  its old yoke? There's no real danger."</p>

  <p>Andrew threw some money on the table and rose abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Let us go to the Club, or a music-hall, or somewhere," he proposed. "The
  atmosphere of this place is stifling."</p>

  <p>They left the restaurant and passed along the broad thoroughfare thronged
  with human beings, hung with sky-signs, a marvel of pulsating life. It was a
  warm evening and the open-air caf&eacute;s were crowded. From the wide-flung
  doors, as the two men sauntered along, they heard the sound of music,
  occasionally the sharp, pattering feet of the professional dancers.
  Music-halls and cinemas invited their patronage. In the more dignified
  streets through which they presently made their way, most of the larger
  theatres were situated, every one of which seemed able to display the warning
  notice: "House Full." Pride paused at the corner and looked back. A new
  sky-sign, which was one of the wonders of the world, was flashing
  hieroglyphics upon the clouds.</p>

  <p>"I have just finished reading a book on Moscow during the third year of
  the Communist rule," he confided. "What a transformation! Your Samara is a
  great man, Andrew Kroupki!"</p>

  <p>"He is one of the world's greatest rulers," was the reverent reply. "No
  one else could have drained the poison out of the country as he has done and
  then filled her with new and vigorous life."</p>

  <p>They stopped in front of the fa&ccedil;ade of a theatre. Automobiles wore
  still setting down late arrivals. Pride glanced at the playbill.</p>

  <p>"A French Comedy," he remarked, "of the type of Edmond About. They sent me
  a box this morning. Shall we see it?"</p>

  <p>Andrew Kroupki had been seeking for an excuse to break away from his
  companion, but before he could find one, Pride had led the way in. A young
  man, dressed with such precision as to amount almost to foppishness, was
  finishing a cigarette in the vestibule. He touched Andrew on the arm as he
  passed.</p>

  <p>"I am forgotten, then?" he asked. "We were at college together, Andrew
  Kroupki. We attended the same lectures afterwards."</p>

  <p>"Ivor Molsky!" the latter exclaimed. "I remember you quite well. But I
  heard&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped short. The young man smiled. He was rather a saturnine-looking
  person with an uncertain gleam in his eyes, and a restlessness of manner at
  variance with his immaculate appearance.</p>

  <p>"Well, well," he interrupted, "never mind what you heard. I am not so bad,
  Andrew. I have often thought about you and our talks. You serve a great
  master."</p>

  <p>"None greater on earth," was the fervent response.</p>

  <p>His friend smiled with an air of tolerance.</p>

  <p>"Gabriel Samara is a genius," he acknowledged, "but he is like the others.
  He is bound hand and foot, and the handkerchief is across his eyes. He has
  the will to go forward, but the way into the light has not been shown
  him."</p>

  <p>An attendant broke in upon their conversation and ushered Andrew and his
  companion to a small box in the second tier, next to the one presently
  occupied by Molsky. The theatre was unusually full and the performance was
  just beginning. Andrew drew his chair behind the curtains and sat a little
  gloomily in the background. Pride, on the other hand, leaned over the ledge
  and surveyed the house with interest. Nearly every one was in evening dress.
  It was an audience distinguished not only for its apparent opulence, but for
  other and more pleasing qualities. Men and women were the study of Pride's
  life. He realised without effort to what class of the community these people
  belonged.</p>

  <p>"My God!" he exclaimed, in an undertone, to Andrew. "Your Russia is
  incredible! Marvellous! All over the world, even in Spain, to-day, the money
  seems to have got into the wrong hands. You find the wrong people spending
  it. This is the only country which seems to be holding the balance and to be
  holding it without a court or aristocracy. These women with their pearls, and
  these men in their very correct evening clothes, they are not of the
  <i>bourgeoisie</i> as we used to understand the word. They are
  intellectuals."</p>

  <p>Andrew showed a momentary flicker of interest.</p>

  <p>"It is the Chief," he said. "Our tabulated taxes are a model for the
  world. Inherited wealth is taxed first, commercial next, brains last of all.
  That accounts for what you see. Even in England forty years ago they made
  ghastly blunders&mdash;taxed the brain-worker and the artist equally with the
  war profiteer. Nothing of that here. Hence this audience of which you
  approve."</p>

  <p>The play proceeded; clever and well received. During the interval Andrew
  touched his companion on the arm.</p>

  <p>"My prince of journalists," he murmured, a little satirically, "you have
  studied this audience so carefully and yet you have failed to notice the most
  interesting people here&mdash;the most interesting to you at any rate with
  your journalistic instinct."</p>

  <p>"I confess it," Pride acknowledged. "I don't recognise a soul."</p>

  <p>"In the box exactly opposite," his companion pointed out&mdash;"the man
  with the grey moustache and the clean-shaven man. It is&mdash;don't you
  recognise them? You must&mdash;one is Lord Edward Fields and the other is
  Edgar Hammond, the man who they say will be the next British Chancellor of
  the Exchequer. They are members of the English Commission over to settle
  finally the terms of this second British loan&mdash;if it comes off."</p>

  <p>Pride scrutinised the two men closely through the opera-glasses, which he
  procured from an attendant. He sighed as he laid them down.</p>

  <p>"If they had belonged to any other nationality in the world," he said,
  "I'd have gone across and trusted to my luck to got a word with them. A
  Britisher on official business I simply daren't face. Have they seen Samara
  yet?"</p>

  <p>"Only unofficially," Andrew replied. "They meet the Cabinet to-morrow, and
  the Council in the afternoon."</p>

  <p>"The Council is 'Samara,'" Pride remarked drily.</p>

  <p>"And why not?" was the prompt retort. "There is no brain in the world like
  Samara's; no ruler like him. What does he want with a dozen inferiors,
  putting in their spoke? The best thing you can say of the Russian Cabinet is
  that it recognises a pedagogue."</p>

  <p>The curtain went up once more and the play was resumed to the interest and
  amusement of its audience, all unconscious of the drama to come. It was
  towards the end of the second act, in the middle of a tense scene between the
  principal actor and actress, that the amazing thing happened. From the very
  next box to that occupied by Pride and his companion, a man suddenly leaned
  out. His knee seemed to be upon the ledge of the box, his arm thrown back
  almost, as Pride said afterwards, with the action of an American baseball
  pitcher. His shrill cry rang through the house.</p>

  <p>"To hell with the foreign capitalists!"</p>

  <p>Something black, about the size of an orange, travelled in an arc across
  the auditorium. The two men watched it with fascinated eyes. It seemed to
  them that the Englishmen had plenty of time to spring from their places. They
  remained seated, however, utterly unconscious of their peril. A shout rang
  through the building.</p>

  <p>"A bomb! Beware!"</p>

  <p>The missile appeared to pass a little above the box at which it was aimed.
  As it struck the wainscoting there was a flash which seemed to shoot from the
  floor to the ceiling of the theatre, a roar and trembling of the earth, the
  hiss of splintering wood, the dull crash of chairs and woodwork scattered in
  every direction. Pride sprang to his feet. Both men realised at the same
  moment that the bomb had been thrown from the next box. They dashed out. The
  box itself was empty, but, coming towards them, evidently headed in his
  flight, was Molsky, the man who had been its occupant and their
  neighbour.</p>

  <p>The change in his appearance was astonishing. The sallowness of his face
  had turned to a distinct shade of yellow, his abundant black hair was no
  longer smooth, but seemed to have been caught by a tornado, his cynical lips
  had parted; nothing remained of the almost meticulous precision of his
  toilet. As he came towards them, running with long, uneven footsteps, they
  could catch the glint of his yellow teeth, almost like fangs, the wild,
  destroying lust of his expression, filled, too, with a certain joy of the
  turmoil and roar of his work of destruction. On their right was an open
  window from which there was only a short drop on to the leads. It was obvious
  that he was making for it. Pride stood directly in his way. The man screamed
  something, lowered his head a little, but too late. The American in his
  younger days had played half-back at Harvard. He was not a man to be passed.
  The fugitive seemed to realise the fact. He steadied himself.</p>

  <p>"Let me go!" he shrieked. "This is not for you." Then he met the impact of
  Pride's fist and went down like a log. In a moment they were all upon
  him&mdash; attendants, police, and even members of the audience. It was
  simply a heap of passionate, furious humanity, with little to be seen of the
  man underneath but a thin stream of blood across the corridor. In the box
  opposite one Englishman lay dead and another apparently dying.</p>

  <p>"It is a pity," Andrew Kroupki confessed, as the two men left the theatre
  half an hour later. "An event like this is nothing more or less than a
  hideous anachronism. It will put us back amongst the nations a score of
  years."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't say that," Pride remonstrated. "The man was a fanatic. They
  exist in every community."</p>

  <p>The younger man shook his head faintly.</p>

  <p>"We were students together," he declared, "and afterwards Molsky became a
  professor at our premier university. No one could ever fathom what his
  political principles were. He hated all forms of what he called 'unauthorised
  rule' and he wrote some very clever criticisms of Samara and his attitude
  towards Communism. Yet the Chief would never have him touched. He called him
  his most intelligent critic&mdash;read everything he wrote, would have argued
  with him if he could."</p>

  <p>"A man of education," Pride murmured. "It seems incredible!"</p>

  <p>"There is no man in the world," Andrew Kroupki pronounced deliberately,
  "so brilliant in his way, so well-read and so amazingly subtle as the modern
  anarchist. He derived his first nourishment from the brutalism of Lenin and
  Trotsky, was suckled on Marx, and completed his education&mdash;God knows
  where!"</p>

  <p>"What will be his end?"</p>

  <p>"Simple enough," was the somewhat terrible reply. "The Chief has an
  enactment that any man found even handling a bomb is hung after a drum-head
  trial. If there is anything left of Molsky, he will be hung before eight
  o'clock to-morrow morning."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch26"
     id="ch26">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Andrew Kroupki's words were in a sense prophetic. Molsky was
  hung at dawn on the following morning, and a few days later a hundred
  thousand Russians watched with bared heads the passing of the English
  statesman's funeral. Edgar Hammond was in hospital and some hopes of his
  recovery had been held out. The echoes of Samara's passionate denunciation,
  both of the crime and of the hideous code of thought from which it sprang,
  had reverberated not only through the country, but through Europe. The simple
  end of his peroration was always remembered:</p>

  <p>"If you wish to kill senselessly," he cried, "kill me. I walk the streets
  of Moscow day by day unprotected and unarmed. I stand for the things of which
  the man you have slain was only one link in the chain&mdash;I stand for the
  things themselves. Kill me and do not shame the oldest of the Russian
  virtues&mdash; hospitality!"</p>

  <p>That night Samara walked unattended, save by Ivan, from the Duma to
  Government Buildings, and from Government Buildings to the Presidential abode
  at the corner of the Square. If any would-be avenger of Molsky's shameful
  death had sought for his opportunity it was certainly offered to him. Samara,
  however, was unmolested. Nevertheless, Ivan groaned as the postern gate
  leading into the courtyard of his master's home swung to after them. They had
  walked in leisurely fashion, but the sweat stood out in dark beads upon his
  forehead.</p>

  <p>"It was folly, that, Master!" he exclaimed. "On an ordinary day, yes, but
  to-day, with Molsky's body still dangling from the gibbet, there might be
  madmen abroad."</p>

  <p>Samara paused to light one of his cigarettes.</p>

  <p>"I expected it, Ivan," he acknowledged simply. "Yet what can one do? When
  strangers are slain by our people one must face what may come. Bring me a
  brandy and mineral water into the library. I am beginning to be a
  coward."</p>

  <p>His old housekeeper, imported from the south of Russia, a quaint survival
  of medi&aelig;valism, with her black woollen gown, strange head-dress and
  dialectic speech, met him in the hall.</p>

  <p>"There is a woman, Master, who waits for you."</p>

  <p>Samara's language, for a moment, though incomprehensible, was violent. The
  woman listened without change of countenance.</p>

  <p>"This woman would not be denied," she continued. "The Master will
  understand when he sees her. I tried to send her away, but it was not
  possible."</p>

  <p>Samara handed his coat and hat to Ivan and walked with slow footsteps
  across the marble hallway into the great library which was his official
  audience-chamber. As he recognised the woman who rose to meet him he gave a
  little exclamation of surprise. There were others who might have been there;
  he had never dreamed of this visit from Catherine.</p>

  <p>"I was at the Duma," she announced brusquely. "I heard your speech. There
  was something which I felt I must say to you."</p>

  <p>"Pray be seated," he begged. "This is the first time you have honoured my
  humble abode. You must drink from my samovar and smoke one of my
  cigarettes."</p>

  <p>She was still in her working clothes; a little tired, apparently a little
  dispirited. She accepted the easy-chair he wheeled up for her, drank her tea
  and lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"I should not be here without orders, of course," she admitted, a little
  abruptly. "It's a terrible breach of etiquette, I know, but sometimes I have
  no chance of speaking to you for days together, and they tell me that you are
  going to London."</p>

  <p>"London!" he repeated bitterly. "London will probably have nothing to do
  with me after last night. They will say what is the good of trying to help a
  country who cannot deal with her own madmen?"</p>

  <p>"England is not like that," she answered gently. "She certainly is not to
  be intimidated. They will grant the loan."</p>

  <p>"What brought you here?" he demanded. "You must have had a reason for
  coming. You must have something definite to say."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," she assented. "I had a definite object in coming to you. I
  wish to give up my work."</p>

  <p>"To leave me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>There was a brief silence&mdash;a silence not of indifference, but tense
  in its way, and pregnant with much hidden emotion. These two might almost
  have been duellists pausing to measure each other's strength&mdash;Samara,
  grim, almost forbidding-looking, with the drawing together of his heavy
  eyebrows, an effective figure in his great oak chair, with a background of
  dimly-seen tapestried walls; Catherine, more beautiful than ever in her
  absolute listlessness. Her skin was clear, bordering upon fragility. Her eyes
  were large and soft, even if a little weary. The simplicity of her gown
  detracted nothing from the charm of her lithe figure. There was a certain
  abandon in her attitude of fatigue, full of attraction from its almost
  animal-like naturalness. She sat in a gentle pool of shaded light, a subdued
  glimmer which brought out the flecks of gold in her hair, slightly
  disarranged after her long day's work. Into her expression, as she met his
  steadfast gaze, there crept something of the light of battle.</p>

  <p>"It was to be expected," he admitted slowly. "Your interests lie
  elsewhere. You wish to leave at once?"</p>

  <p>"I draw my pay weekly," she said. "You are entitled to a week's notice.
  Accept it, if you please."</p>

  <p>"That is done," he assented.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you," she went on, "why I choose to go. You have apparently
  lost your faith in me. You have conceived suspicions of my friends. It is
  possible that these are justified. I am only partially in their
  confidence."</p>

  <p>She paused. He watched her steadily.</p>

  <p>"Finish," he insisted. "There is more, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"To-morrow," she continued, "you have ordered Andrew to come here for the
  day and send his machine. He is a bad typist, a worse stenographer, and he
  hates all form of dictation. His work has lain along different lines."</p>

  <p>"Proceed, please," Samara invited.</p>

  <p>"Andrew's duties," she pointed out, "have always been to act as your
  representative at committee meetings of the Duma. He is a sort of go-between
  with you and your ministers. He is the one person who enjoys your complete
  confidence. I do not complain, but when I came with you from New York it was
  as your confidential secretary. I have become your typist. Now that there is
  important work to be done even that is taken from me. I resign."</p>

  <p>"You will throw in your lot with your family?" he asked with a sneer. "You
  will exist on the bounty of Mrs. Saxon J. Bossington?"</p>

  <p>Her eyes flashed angrily.</p>

  <p>"That is ungenerous," she exclaimed. "I consider the position of my aunt
  and some of her entourage as undignified in the extreme. It is ungenerous of
  you, however, to remind me of it."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps so," he admitted. "As a matter of fact, I am angry. I do not wish
  to lose you."</p>

  <p>"You are very gracious," she murmured.</p>

  <p>Ivan entered, after ponderous knocking, and asked his master a question.
  Samara nodded.</p>

  <p>"I dine here," he declared. "Have dinner served for two, in an hour's
  time."</p>

  <p>"For two?" she repeated questioningly.</p>

  <p>"You will dine with me," he said curtly. "It shall be either our farewell
  or&mdash;a celebration."</p>

  <p>"A celebration of what?"</p>

  <p>"Of a better understanding," he answered, with a faint softening of those
  lines at the corners of his mouth.</p>

  <p>She lazily removed her hat and smoothed out her hair.</p>

  <p>"I shall dine with you as I am," she announced. "I am untidy and my head
  aches. This mechanical work depresses and fatigues me. I should like to go
  home and put on a pretty frock, but I have not the energy."</p>

  <p>He seemed suddenly changed; infinitely more human, responsive to her
  altered attitude.</p>

  <p>"As you sit there&mdash;or should I say, recline?&mdash;it seems to me
  that no change in your appearance could be for the better," he assured
  her.</p>

  <p>She glanced at him in half-pleased surprise.</p>

  <p>"A compliment!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"A compliment implies a certain deviation from the truth," he observed. "I
  meant what I said. Now I will deal with your complaint and offer you an
  explanation. I have an important document to draw up to-morrow. I was
  proposing to take only Andrew into my confidence for one reason, and one
  reason only. Trotsk and some others suspect you of imperialistic sympathies.
  I, alone, know the truth about you. You are day by day subject to the
  influence and persuasions of your family. I do not consider it fair upon you
  yourself that you should be in possession of information which they would
  give their souls to acquire, especially&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She took advantage of his pause.</p>

  <p>"It is for what comes after that 'especially' that I wait," she told
  him.</p>

  <p>"Especially," he concluded, "as you have not yet declared yourself as
  between me and Nicholas Imanoff."</p>

  <p>"I realise your problem," she admitted. "I am glad that you have been
  frank about it."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you have a pronouncement to make," he suggested.</p>

  <p>"I wish I had," she replied. "I can at least be truthful. All my life I
  have prayed for the return of Tzardom to this country. That I suppose is in
  my blood. I have looked upon you with respect because you delivered Russia
  from the yoke of the Bolshevists, because you have evolved at least a sane
  form of republicanism, but I have looked upon you at the same time as a
  stumbling-block in our way."</p>

  <p>"Your candour," he declared, "is most attractive. Pray continue."</p>

  <p>"I am trying to let you into the back of my mind," she went on
  thoughtfully. "I am a daughter of Tzardom and a belief in monarchical
  government is in my blood, but I am also a daughter of Russia. Every spare
  minute since I returned here, I have devoted to studying your system of
  government, seeking justification for it. I am not clever; I often wish I
  were. I have not even a knowledge of history to guide me. Of one thing,
  however, I am still convinced&mdash;that there is exceedingly little
  difference between a beneficent Tzardom and the Government of to-day."</p>

  <p>"Absurd!" he scoffed. "The present Government of Russia is the most
  democratic in the world."</p>

  <p>"And the most autocratic," she retorted coolly. "It is you who rule
  Russia."</p>

  <p>"By the mandate of the people," he reminded her.</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the sort," she objected. "The people elected a republican
  government. You travelled the country for a year. You hypnotised them. They
  voted according to your decree. What has your Cabinet or even your Inner
  Council to do with the Government of Russia? Nothing! You are an autocrat
  more supreme than any Tzar who ever lived."</p>

  <p>"I make no comment on what you say. Whither does it lead?"</p>

  <p>"To this," she replied. "If Russia is to be ruled by one man why not a
  Tzar? The Royalists have learnt their lesson. An Imanoff has more right upon
  the throne than you."</p>

  <p>"Nicholas Imanoff," he jeered. "You would put him in my place!"</p>

  <p>She was a little disconcerted, but she did her best to conceal the
  fact.</p>

  <p>"Nicholas would never assume such powers as you have done," she replied.
  "He would govern through his ministers. If you remained a patriotic Russian,
  you would probably be one of them."</p>

  <p>"I am cheaper than a Tzar," he pointed out. "I do not cost the State even
  a modest million a year, nor do I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He broke off in his speech. His housekeeper was standing upon the
  threshold, gazing expectantly towards Catherine.</p>

  <p>"My housekeeper will show you where to rearrange your hair, if you really
  think that it needs it," he said courteously. "With your permission, I will
  not change my clothes. Shall we meet here in twenty minutes? You shall tell
  me then whether I can qualify as a bartender when the Royalists have driven
  me out of Russia!"</p>

  <p>She made a little grimace over her shoulder as she left the room; a
  quaintly human touch which seemed to lessen at once the strain of their
  relations. He stood with his fingers upon the bell, listening to her
  departing footsteps.</p>

  <p>The simplicity of Samara's life was typified in the dinner which was
  presently served. The house itself was an old palace of the Grand Duke
  Nicholas, sacked by the Bolshevists in nineteen-seventeen, occupied by Lenin
  for some time during his stay in Moscow, and finally transformed into the
  official dwelling-house of the Chairman of the Council, sometimes called
  President of the Russian Republic. Little remained of its former splendour,
  except its architectural proportions and the tapestry-covered walls of the
  room in which they sat. Dinner was served at one end of a long mahogany
  table, the greater part of which remained uncovered. The only illumination in
  the room was that afforded by wax candles. Ivan waited behind his master's
  chair, and a single manservant was the other attendant. The dinner itself was
  plain, but excellent, the champagne exceptional in quality.</p>

  <p>"I am free to confess that I am no longer tired," Catherine observed, as
  she sipped her wine. "It is wonderful that you should have been alone. One
  fancies you always doing something official at night."</p>

  <p>"There was a banquet to the Englishmen," he told her. "That had to be
  cancelled, of course."</p>

  <p>He turned and gave Ivan a few rapid orders. The cloth disappeared as
  though by magic. Coffee, fruit and liqueurs alone were left upon the table.
  Even Ivan presently withdrew. Catherine was conscious of a little
  thrill&mdash;she scarcely knew whether of excitement or
  apprehension&mdash;when she realised, not only that they were alone, but that
  they were alone with certain things yet to be said.</p>

  <p>"So you want to leave me, Catherine Borans," he remarked.</p>

  <p>He had pushed his chair around and crossed his legs, so that they were
  almost side by side. The chairs themselves were relics of ancient
  magnificence, with huge black oak backs and upholstered in worn rose-coloured
  damask. Looking at him as he bent forward to light his cigarette, Catherine
  felt herself compelled to half-reluctant admiration. The wine which he had
  drunk freely had brought little more than a faint flush of colour to his
  cheeks; his eyes were bright and full of clean fire; his mouth, as usual,
  incomprehensible. She found herself wondering what it would look like if ever
  he should by chance speak tenderly.</p>

  <p>"It is better that I leave you," she said, "since I no longer possess your
  full confidence."</p>

  <p>"Are you worthy of my full confidence?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"So far I have never abused it," she answered.</p>

  <p>"For that very reason," he admitted, "I owe you frankness. You shall
  continue to have it. If you had studied history and philosophy of government,
  you would understand the truth of what I am going to tell you. All the
  beneficent legislation of the world is effected by moderate government, but a
  government, even though it brings a country from the slough of despond to the
  fields of paradise, cannot exist for ever. The desire for change in an
  electorate is an inevitable and ineradicable instinct. Before many years are
  gone by, I and my Government will disappear. To which extreme will Russia
  swing? Back to communism-cum-anarchy, or in the other direction towards a
  monarchy? There is a fear of both. That is why I, who theoretically hate all
  such things, keep up a wonderful secret service. I watch the anarchists and I
  watch your friends. Your friends, here at my invitation, are already
  conspiring. Both of the men to whom I gave posts in the army are already at
  work with royalist propaganda. Both of these are your relatives. For whom are
  you, Catherine Borans&mdash;for them or for me?"</p>

  <p>"I am a Monarchist," she said proudly, "but it does not follow that I
  should betray your trust."</p>

  <p>"The work which I have summoned Andrew Kroupki to do with me to-morrow,"
  he went on, "concerns the future of Russia's two remaining armies, deals with
  the matter of the new conscriptions, and would be full of the most amazing
  interest to your relatives. They would read my proclamations before they were
  issued and be prepared with contra-propaganda. They would also learn the
  means I am taking to prevent serious trouble. You still wish to do the
  work?"</p>

  <p>"If I am to remain your secretary," she answered with a certain
  unaccustomed doggedness.</p>

  <p>"You will be here at nine o'clock to-morrow morning, then," he directed.
  "You will take a taxicab first to Government Buildings and collect your
  machine, both code books, and instruct Peter Tranchard, the head of the
  private printing department, to be prepared for important work during the
  afternoon. You will be engaged here for the whole of the day. May I take it
  now that your notice is withdrawn?"</p>

  <p>"If you wish," she answered a little wistfully. "But are you sure you
  still desire to keep me? Other people, if they know who I was, would feel the
  same as General Trotsk. You would be considered very indiscreet to have a
  secretary with such connections."</p>

  <p>He poured himself out some liqueur brandy and held the glass between his
  hands for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Indiscreet," he repeated. "Yes, there is indiscretion in keeping you near
  me, Catherine Borans, but indiscretion of another sort."</p>

  <p>She gave a little sigh of content. Her eyes challenged him.</p>

  <p>"This sounds more interesting," she murmured. "Please go on."</p>

  <p>"There is nothing further to tell you except this," he replied coldly.
  "The indiscretion consists in the fact that you are the only woman whom I
  have ever met in my life who could keep my thoughts turned away for a moment
  from the things that count. A coward would send you away. You see I have
  faith in myself."</p>

  <p>"More interesting than I had even dared to hope," she exclaimed. "Have you
  never really cared seriously for any woman, then?"</p>

  <p>"Never," he assured her fervently. "You are the only one against whom I
  have ever had to steel myself, the only one who has ever made me feel that
  there are lonely hours in a man's life."</p>

  <p>"You were feeling like that, I suppose," she observed quite calmly, but
  with the ghost of a tremulous little smile at the corners of her lips, "the
  night you kissed me on the steamer."</p>

  <p>For a moment she was afraid. She called back the challenge from her eyes,
  but it was too late. His arm was around her neck, his lips pressed to hers.
  She almost lost her senses in a wave of turmoil, of impotent resistance to
  the torrent of passion which surged about her. The perfume of the roses which
  decorated the table remained in her thoughts for years afterwards. Just as
  she had found his arm around her absolutely without warning, so, in the same
  fashion, she saw him a moment or two later, leaning back in his high-backed
  chair, gazing at her with steady but burning eyes.</p>

  <p>"As your host, I have transgressed," he admitted, "but I have the great
  excuse. If you had been any other woman and I had been any other man, I
  should have been your lover."</p>

  <p>He lit a cigarette and smoked furiously. Twice she opened her lips and
  said nothing. The third time she spoke.</p>

  <p>"But you are Samara," she murmured, her eyes swimming in the softness of
  incredible things, "and I am Princess Catherine of Imanoff. Well?"</p>

  <p>He rose to his feet, almost with a bound, passed behind her chair, and
  before she could imagine what he meant to do was standing on the hearthrug,
  his finger pressed to the bell. It was answered almost immediately by
  Ivan.</p>

  <p>"An automobile for Miss Borans," Samara ordered.</p>

  <p>The man bowed low and departed, closing the door behind him. Catherine
  looked across at her host, still standing upon the hearthrug, and laughed
  softly.</p>

  <p>"Dismissed," she sighed.</p>

  <p>"Would you be willing to pay the price of staying!" he asked bluntly.</p>

  <p>The laughter passed from her face. Some part of the wave of emotion which
  had driven him from her side, suddenly surged up in her. Whether it was love
  or hate she scarcely knew, but for the first time in her life she felt
  herself dominated.</p>

  <p>"The President of the Russian Republic," he began hoarsely, "even though
  it were his desire, could never&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Is it his desire?" she interrupted, with a sudden wild hatred of those
  heavy footsteps in the hall.</p>

  <p>The door was thrown open. Ivan, tall and massive, stood to attention.</p>

  <p>"The automobile awaits," he announced.</p>

  <p>"Not later than nine o'clock in the morning, if you please, Miss Borans,"
  Samara said, bowing his farewell.</p>

  <p>She left the room slowly&mdash;the room which seemed strewn with fragments
  of a dream. She followed Ivan down the hall and nodded good-night to him
  carelessly as she stepped into the automobile. As she drove across the Square
  and came within hearing of the night-hum of Moscow&mdash;a medley, it sounded
  to her, of strange music and hurrying footsteps&mdash;she found herself
  suddenly thinking of Sadie Loyes and the Hotel Weltmore Typewriting Bureau.
  It was like an ante-climax to her emotions. She began to laugh softly.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch27"
     id="ch27">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Alexandrina breathed a sigh of relief. She was entertaining
  an unexpected visitor whom she had found a little difficult.</p>

  <p>"At last!" she exclaimed, as Catherine entered. "My dear child, what
  extraordinary accident has detained you? We have telephoned to Government
  Buildings and every place we could think of. You have met General von
  Hartsen, I believe."</p>

  <p>The General bowed low and raised Catherine's fingers to his lips.</p>

  <p>"In Monte Carlo," he murmured. "It gives me the greatest pleasure,
  Princess, to renew our acquaintance."</p>

  <p>Catherine glanced around the room, conscious of an acute sense of mental
  fatigue, a desire for an impossible seclusion. Kirdorff was there and Cyril
  Sabaroff, the former in uniform, but if there had been other guests, they had
  all departed. She sank a little wearily into an easy-chair. She was the only
  one in morning dress and she was sensible somehow of a complete lack of
  sympathy with the little coterie gathered around her aunt's chair.</p>

  <p>"I was working late," she explained with perverse candour, "and I stayed
  to dine at Government House."</p>

  <p>General von Hartsen was interested.</p>

  <p>"Does your work, Princess," he inquired, "still lead you into direct
  association with Gabriel Samara?"</p>

  <p>"At times," Catherine admitted. "I dined with him to-night. I am working
  with him at Government House to-morrow."</p>

  <p>There was a moment's silence.</p>

  <p>"At Government House," Kirdorff repeated thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>Catherine nodded. Her questioner moved a little nearer towards her.</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea as to the nature of the work?" he ventured. "I ask,
  because we have information&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Alexandrina intervened with a wave of the hand.</p>

  <p>"My dear Kirdorff," she complained, "you think of one thing, and one thing
  only. We admit your zeal, and we quite understand that Catherine's intimate
  association with Government work just now may prove of great benefit to our
  cause. At the same time, we would ask you to remember that General von
  Hartsen's mission is of the first importance with us at the present
  moment."</p>

  <p>"Has General von Hartsen a mission?" Catherine inquired, a little
  flippantly. "Tell me, General," she went on, "how is that very hot-headed
  young charge of yours who followed me to London? You will have trouble with
  that young man when he grows up."</p>

  <p>The General stiffened.</p>

  <p>"Princess," he begged, "may I ask for your very serious attention to what
  I have to say?"</p>

  <p>"Frankly I could not promise it," was the somewhat unexpected reply. "I am
  very sleepy and my nerves are all tangled. What about to-morrow, General? I
  feel, somehow or other, that to-morrow I shall be a different person. You are
  not hurrying away from Moscow, I hope."</p>

  <p>"That depends upon you, Princess," he answered gravely. "My mission is to
  lay a certain proposal before you."</p>

  <p>"Not the same proposal as before, I trust!" Catherine exclaimed.</p>

  <p>The General frowned.</p>

  <p>"Princess," he said, "the circumstances and conditions under which I now
  approach you are entirely different. I asked you then to accept in marriage
  the suit of a German nobleman of royal descent, whose future was of no great
  account in the world. To-day I am here to beg for your hand in marriage to
  Prince Frederick of Wehrenzollern who, I pledge you my word, before twelve
  months have passed will be crowned Emperor of Germany."</p>

  <p>"Matrimonially," Catherine murmured, "my destiny seems to lead me to high
  places. Have you not been informed, General, that I am already as good as
  betrothed to Prince Nicholas of Imanoff, the future Tzar of Russia?"</p>

  <p>"It is upon that point that I desire to speak with you, Princess," was the
  earnest reply. "We Germans, if I may say so, are in the last lap of our
  struggle towards monarchy. The people are only waiting for a word and they
  will lift the roof off the Reichstag with their cheering. The present
  parliament is due to be dissolved in two months' time. The Government will
  then resign and not a single other statesman will attempt to form a fresh
  one. The President, who is also resigning, will send for Prince Frederick. He
  will make an announcement. You may hear the roar of German voices even to
  your frontier."</p>

  <p>"Very interesting," Catherine admitted, "but do I understand that the
  object of your mission here is seriously to revert to the subject of a
  marriage between myself and Prince Frederick?"</p>

  <p>"Dear and gracious young lady," Von Hartsen continued, "the matter now
  rests upon an entirely different basis. The road to monarchy in Russia will
  be a long and arduous one in any case. The aid of Germany is the only thing
  which may shorten it by a span of years. As Kaiserin of Germany you will be
  able to do more for the cause of monarchy in this country than if you remain
  the betrothed of Prince Nicholas of Imanoff."</p>

  <p>"Plausible," Catherine agreed, "but scarcely convincing. What has Nicholas
  to say to this?"</p>

  <p>"Prince Nicholas," Kirdorff intervened, stepping forward, "was consulted
  before General von Hartsen left Berlin. He is deeply sensible of the potency
  of the General's arguments. The Royalist cause will gain nothing outside
  Russia by the intermarriage of yourself and Prince Nicholas. You will indeed
  be looked upon doubtfully. Marriage between first cousins here is not too
  popular&mdash; especially after a decade of Soviet rule. Your marriage with
  Prince Frederick, on the other hand, would enable you to ensure the return of
  the monarchy to this country. Prince Frederick has pledged his word to make
  this a charge upon his conscience, if you should accept his offer."</p>

  <p>Alexandrina, who had been watching her niece a little anxiously, motioned
  her to her side.</p>

  <p>"My dear," she said, "I am aware that this suggestion must have taken you
  completely by surprise. I quite appreciate the fact that you have not had
  time to think seriously about Frederick as a possible husband. You would
  furthermore consider yourself bound in honour to conclude your alliance with
  Nicholas. Nicholas, however, has had a very plain hint dropped to him. He has
  signified his intention to listen to reason."</p>

  <p>"In other words, Nicholas is quite agreeable to the transfer," Catherine
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"It is for the good of his country," Kirdorff reminded her. "Nicholas is
  above all things a patriot."</p>

  <p>"At the same time," Catherine pointed out, "this trafficking in my
  affections seems a little sordid. Nicholas, it appears, is content to do
  without me. I have, in other words, regained my liberty. I insist upon
  spending the night in that state. To-morrow I will interview General von
  Hartsen at the earliest possible moment."</p>

  <p>Alexandrina turned towards the frowning ambassador with an ingratiating
  smile.</p>

  <p>"My niece's attitude appears to me to be correct, General," she said. "You
  must not be over-zealous on account of your young master. Lunch with us here
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Dine," Catherine put in softly. "I shall be away all day."</p>

  <p>"Dine with us here to-morrow night, then," the Grand Duchess invited, "and
  my niece shall be prepared."</p>

  <p>Von Hartsen rose a little unwillingly to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I should have preferred to have telephoned favourable news at once to my
  august young friend," he confessed. "You will forgive my pointing out once
  more that the position he is able to offer his wife is absolutely and
  entirely unique. However, I am at Her Highness's disposition."</p>

  <p>"I shall have made up my mind by dinner-time," Catherine promised him. "It
  really is quite an important matter to me, you know."</p>

  <p>"It is of vast importance to all Europe," the General agreed. "On the
  other hand, I cannot imagine where hesitation could arise."</p>

  <p>Catherine smiled cryptically.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not," she admitted, "but then you see you have to do with a
  woman. I am not sure that I should not find the Court life at Berlin a little
  irksome."</p>

  <p>"You, Princess," the General declared, "would be the Court. It would be
  for you to set its tone. It is not for me to remind you that the lives of
  people even in the highest places have their relaxations at which even the
  historian can only guess."</p>

  <p>He made his ceremonious farewells. They all waited until the door had
  closed behind him. Then a buzz of conversation started.</p>

  <p>"My dear," her aunt told Catherine confidentially, "Nicholas has gone
  further in self-denial than we permitted General von Hartsen to know. He
  abnegates his personal wishes with joy. A friendly monarchy established at
  Berlin would assure our own triumph."</p>

  <p>"There is not the slightest doubt that the German people are aching for
  their Kaiser," Cyril Sabaroff observed. "Frederick can scarcely walk the
  streets in comfort nowadays."</p>

  <p>"Every illustrated paper has his picture," the Grand Duchess added. "You
  can read of his doings every day."</p>

  <p>"And every newspaper has anecdotes about him," Kirdorff concluded. "He is
  easily the most popular young man in Europe."</p>

  <p>"I am very much flattered," Catherine pronounced, "and very sleepy. To-
  morrow I will make up my mind whether I shall be Kaiserin of Germany or
  Tzarina of Russia, or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There was a long pause. Rosa Sabaroff at last interposed.</p>

  <p>"Or what, Catherine?"</p>

  <p>Catherine looked back from the door towards which she had made her
  way.</p>

  <p>"Or return to the Weltmore Typewriting Agency and my American
  independence!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch28"
     id="ch28">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Catherine came face to face with Andrew Kroupki as she was
  leaving her office in Government Buildings at an early hour on the following
  morning. He stood in the doorway, blocking her exit, and his expression was
  menacing. She realised at once that there was to be trouble.</p>

  <p>"One word with you, if you please, Miss Borans," he insisted.</p>

  <p>She gave way and he closed the door behind him, confronting her with a
  spot of angry colour burning in his cheeks, wild-eyed and almost
  inarticulate.</p>

  <p>"It is unbelievable!" he exclaimed. "You must not go to the Chief to-day!
  Stay here and I will make your excuses."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean, Andrew?" she asked coldly. "I am directed to report
  myself at Government House before nine o'clock. Of course I must go."</p>

  <p>"You must have begged for the work," he continued, his tone trembling with
  agitation. "It is not right that you should have it. It is not safe. It is a
  wicked thing!"</p>

  <p>"Andrew, you are not yourself," she said gently, almost kindly. "Surely
  you know that I must obey orders."</p>

  <p>"Orders! The Chief must be mad," he cried. "A moment's indiscretion with
  regard to to-day's work and a terrible situation might arise. You are not of
  us. You are not for the people of Russia. You are for those who are already
  beginning to plot against us."</p>

  <p>"That is absurd," she told him. "You must not talk to me so, Andrew. I
  have never yet failed in my trust wherever my sympathies may have lain.
  Besides, it is not for you to interfere. It is your master who speaks the
  word."</p>

  <p>He shook for a moment, as though seized with an ague.</p>

  <p>"You dined with him alone last night," he cried hysterically. "What was
  the argument you used to bring him to folly?"</p>

  <p>"I have been very patient with you, Andrew," she said, with a warning
  flash in her eyes, "but I am reaching my limits. Perhaps, if you desire to
  preserve my esteem, you had better stand on one side."</p>

  <p>"I think," he sobbed, "that I would rather dig my fingers into your white
  throat and wring the life out of you than let you go to Samara to-day."</p>

  <p>Sympathy once more chased the anger from her mind. It was obvious that he
  was unstrung, on the verge of a nervous breakdown.</p>

  <p>"You are very foolish, Andrew," she declared. "The work of to-day is
  better done by me. You are a very bad typist and you are very slow with the
  new code. It is natural that the Chief should send for me. There are many
  matters of graver importance, I am sure, that he would leave in your
  hands."</p>

  <p>Her kindness seemed only to throw fresh fuel on the fire of his anger. She
  suddenly realised that she was in actual physical danger. They were alone on
  the floor of the great building. No one arrived at the offices until nine
  o'clock, and the cleaners had departed. She moved a little towards the
  telephone, but he seemed to apprehend her purpose and blocked her
  passage.</p>

  <p>"It is false," he almost shouted. "He has lost his head. There is nothing
  more vital to the State than the scheme which he is to confide to you to-day.
  He has lost his head! You have bewitched him as you have done
  me&mdash;Samara, to whom women have been but playthings!&mdash;the idlest of
  all his diversions!"</p>

  <p>"You are becoming absurd," she said quietly. "Be so kind as to let me
  pass."</p>

  <p>He shook his clenched fists in the air. His appearance was veritably
  tragic. Every moment he was more completely losing control of himself.</p>

  <p>"You must answer my question or I think that I shall kill you," he gasped.
  "You know very well what it is. You could have saved me this torture. Is
  Samara your lover?"</p>

  <p>Catherine looked at him steadfastly for a moment&mdash;looked at his long,
  narrow face with its high cheekbones, his lips trembling like a woman's, at
  his eyes from which all the kindly dreaminess had gone. It seemed to take her
  a few seconds to realise the actual meaning of his words, but when she did,
  the strain of inherited savagery, which had made for purity amongst the women
  of her race and bravery amongst the men, leaped into fire in her veins. Her
  physical strength itself seemed to swell. With her outstretched hand, she
  struck Andrew Kroupki a blow on the side of the face with such unexpected
  force that he staggered back half-dazed, blood already commencing to trickle
  from the place where her ring had bitten into his flesh. Before he could
  recover himself she had gone. To his reeling senses the slam of the door, the
  click of her heels upon the polished floor, were full of evil portent.</p>

  <p>She made no excuses when she arrived at her destination, though Samara was
  manifestly impatient. Their meeting of the night before seemed to belong to
  another world. Never for a single moment, did he depart from the role of
  exacting and conscientious employer. He did not even trouble to present to
  her Adolph Weirtz, the Semitic, brilliant Minister of Finance, who was
  present, but plunged at once into their work. At eleven o'clock Weirtz left.
  At one o'clock her fingers began to stumble. He looked at her sharply.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter?" he asked curtly. "Do you need luncheon?"</p>

  <p>"I do not think that I need it any more than any one else would," she
  replied. "Something of the sort is usual. Probably you would have noticed
  yourself that it is past one o'clock if you had breakfasted at seven and if
  you had not had the resources of your sideboard."</p>

  <p>He suddenly and unexpectedly smiled.</p>

  <p>"<i>Touch&eacute;,"</i> he confessed. "I am a selfish brute."</p>

  <p>He rang the bell and gave Ivan a brief order. Then he crossed to the
  sideboard, concocted a strange amber-coloured drink which he forced upon her,
  and pushed cigarettes to her side. He himself had been smoking a huge pipe
  most of the morning.</p>

  <p>"At four o'clock," he confided, "the other two members of the Council will
  be here to approve. So much for my autocracy which you were talking
  about."</p>

  <p>"And if they disapprove?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"The proclamation will be issued just the same," he declared, with a
  sudden note of belligerency in his tone.</p>

  <p>She laughed quietly; a relaxation which a moment or two later he found
  himself sharing. Afterwards he became almost apologetic.</p>

  <p>"The principle is already decided upon by the Cabinet," he explained.
  "There can be no objection to anything except detail, and, so far as that is
  concerned, I am more likely to be right than any of them. You gathered that
  Weirtz was against the whole thing?"</p>

  <p>"I tried not to listen," she replied. "I gathered that he was
  disapproving."</p>

  <p>"He looks upon the army as our sole refuge against two smouldering
  factions of the community&mdash;the Royalists and the anarchists," Samara
  expounded. "He agrees that the anarchist influence to-day is negligible, but
  he has an absurdly exaggerated idea of the significance of the royalist
  movement."</p>

  <p>"So you admit that there is a royalist movement?" she asked him
  curiously.</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I suppose so," he assented. "They're making noise enough, at any
  rate. To return to Weirtz. He thinks that the period of interregnum between
  the disbanding of the armies and the establishing of a citizen force will be
  a period of danger. I disagree with him. The idleness of a standing army
  makes it a constant menace; usually a hotbed of intrigue and conspiracy.
  They're hard at it now down there. They think I don't know, but I do. Your
  friend Kirdorff, a cold-blooded, brainy schemer; Orenburg&mdash;less brains
  but more courage. They took their commands willingly enough and drew their
  pay, and began to plot the next day. I've no great fancy for your friends,
  Catherine Borans."</p>

  <p>She sighed.</p>

  <p>"Why should you have? They look at life differently. They follow other
  gods."</p>

  <p>"Eat your luncheon," he invited, as soon as Ivan had finished setting the
  table. "We ought to start work again directly. You must have some of this
  goulash. I never imagined I was hungry. Ivan, some Rhine wine and tumblers.
  Have you seen Andrew to-day?"</p>

  <p>"I saw him at Government Buildings," she replied. "He was very angry and
  very rude."</p>

  <p>"He doubts my wisdom in giving you this work," Samara confided. "He is
  quite right from his point of view. No one would do it unless it were some
  one like myself, whose life is governed by instinct and not reason."</p>

  <p>She smiled. "Andrew would never understand that."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry for him," Samara declared abruptly. "He is jealous of you and
  at the same time he is in love with you&mdash;a painful condition of mind for
  a highly-strung and extraordinarily susceptible young man.</p>

  <p>"Were you insensible to all human weaknesses when you were young?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I? Mother of God, no!" he answered carelessly. "I had my fits of weakness
  and I yielded to them, when I chose, but they never formed part of my life.
  They were the rest houses in the night. They helped one to draw breath for
  the morrow. It is these romantic youngsters who seek to weave their follies
  into the web of durable things who are to be pitied. Ivan, some coffee," he
  ordered. "A cigarette, Catherine Borans. Now let us start. I have a new
  vision!"</p>

  <p>At four o'clock Samara read the result of his day's work to Weirtz, his
  Minister of Finance, to Argoff, the Minister for Home Affairs, and to General
  Trotsk, the Chief of the Police. In an inner room Catherine sipped tea and
  listened. From the beginning she was conscious of the attitude of deferential
  opposition existing amongst Samara's colleagues. Argoff was the first
  spokesman.</p>

  <p>"Sir," he said to Samara, "you have faithfully embodied in these
  proclamations and directions the decision of the Cabinet as arrived at last
  Thursday. We three were in a hopeless minority then; we are in a hopeless
  minority now. I personally look upon the action you propose to take as
  fraught with the greatest danger to the future of the Republic."</p>

  <p>"And you, Weirtz?" Samara asked.</p>

  <p>"I agree with Argoff," was the unhesitating reply. "The disbanding of the
  Third Army was sound and brilliant legislation. To go further in the same
  direction would, I think, expose the country to unnecessary dangers."</p>

  <p>"What have you to say, General?" Samara concluded.</p>

  <p>General Trotsk&mdash;a thin, grey man, with the face of a sphinx&mdash;was
  in reality the most discomposed of the three, although he did not betray
  it.</p>

  <p>"Gabriel Samara," he said, "before you came into power there were those
  who called you a visionary. You have silenced your critics in the
  establishment of what might well become the greatest republic in the world's
  history. I beg you to beware lest one single mistake should bring to naught
  all that you have done."</p>

  <p>"Aye, and more than that," Weirtz put in, "plunge this country once more
  into the throes of rebellion and disorder. To all appearance," he went on,
  "Russia is to-day a contented and happy nation, yet under the surface, as I
  very well know, there is discontent and grumbling, because it is human nature
  that this should be so amongst the worthless, the quixotes, the criminals.
  There is always fuel for a burning brand. Frankly, my agent's report from
  Odenak is that the great mass of the Second Army do not desire
  demobilisation. A civilian life does not appeal to them. They like their
  uniform, the routine of their daily life, the freedom from all personal
  anxieties and responsibilities. They do not doubt your beneficent schemes for
  their welfare, but they prefer to remain soldiers. It is this feeling which
  is making them ready listeners to the propaganda which is going on amongst
  them."</p>

  <p>"The love of military life," Samara pronounced, "is an unnatural
  affection. The sooner it is stamped out the better."</p>

  <p>"Theoretically very right," Weirtz agreed, "but practically there are
  difficulties. Can even you, Gabriel Samara, force a million men out of a life
  which is dear to them, into a new and untried career?<i>"</i></p>

  <p>"Nonsense," was the impatient reply. "Half of them were peasant
  agriculturists in their youth, with land to till and a homestead to look
  after. They will soon find themselves. Besides, you and I, General, should
  know that the Russian soldier is never insubordinate. He will obey orders.
  There will be nothing else left for him to do. On the day these proclamations
  are posted, every ammunition dump in the camp will be blown up, and their
  bayonets withdrawn. It will be simply a million unarmed men, pouring through
  the great clearing-house which will be ready for them next month at the rate
  of thirty thousand a day."</p>

  <p>"It is to my mind," General Trotsk declared, "a most rash and hazardous
  experiment."</p>

  <p>"Where is the hazard?" Samara demanded. "The First Army is within a day's
  march of the city, fully equipped and fully armed. But far be it from me to
  suggest such a thing as a conflict. Their mere existence would prevent
  it."</p>

  <p>"There is yet another danger," General Trotsk pointed out. "Supposing word
  of this projected destruction of their ammunition were to reach the army; it
  would be easy enough for them to guard against it."</p>

  <p>"Such a supposition infers the presence of a traitor amongst us," Samara
  argued. "Not another breathing soul knows my plans. Peter Transhard, who
  controls the private printing-press of the Home Office, you yourself would
  vouch for, Argoff. Not one of his compositors can read, but, as in the case
  of the proclamation addressed to the Poles two years ago, these men are
  locked up in quarters for a week after their work is done."</p>

  <p>"There is your secretary," Weirtz suggested bluntly.</p>

  <p>"I will answer for her," Samara promised, with a flash in his eyes. "I
  admit the need for secrecy. It is because of it that I dealt with this
  measure before the Cabinet instead of the General Assembly. You have no
  reason to doubt the loyalty of the First Army, General?"</p>

  <p>"There is some disquiet," Trotsk admitted. "I have only this morning
  caused seventy of my men to be enrolled in the ranks."</p>

  <p>"The plot to re-establish Soviet conditions," Weirtz remarked, "was never,
  I think, a serious one. I suspect that the plotting, such as it is to- day,
  emanates from a different source."</p>

  <p>"Royalist?" Samara inquired.</p>

  <p>"Royalist, beyond a doubt," Trotsk affirmed. "The Russian of to-day hates
  the very sound of the word 'Bolshevist' or 'Anarchist.' It is the reactionary
  swing of the pendulum which is to be feared. It is my firm belief that there
  are a million more Royalists in the country to-day than anyone imagines."</p>

  <p>Samara laughed confidently.</p>

  <p>"There may be amazing surprises in store for us in this world," he said,
  "but I do not think that Nicholas Imanoff, bond seller of New York, will ever
  be crowned Tzar of Russia. You have read the proclamations, my friends. Apart
  from the fact that you are not in entire sympathy with me and with the
  majority of the Cabinet as to the policy of which they are the outcome, you
  have no criticism to make?"</p>

  <p>"I have none except those I made before the Cabinet," Adolph Weirtz
  declared. "I maintain that as it seems to be the wish of the Cabinet that the
  Second Army should be disbanded, it should be done gradually&mdash;a hundred
  thousand a year, the men to be selected by lot."</p>

  <p>"Too slow," Samara observed brusquely. "Anything else?"</p>

  <p>"I propose," Trotsk said, "that you, sir, visit the district personally,
  address the soldiers, and study their disposition. I have reports from my
  subordinates every day which I find disquieting."</p>

  <p>"That I have decided to do," Samara assented. "And you, Argoff?"</p>

  <p>"I have but one suggestion to make," was the prompt reply. "Burn your
  morning's work, Mr. President, and expunge the decree from the archives of
  the Cabinet. You are trifling with destiny."</p>

  <p>"Every reformer the world has ever known," Samara answered deliberately,
  "has sat at the table of chance.". . . .</p>

  <p>Samara drew back the curtains of the inner room as soon as he was alone.
  Catherine came quietly forward to meet him.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he asked. "You heard everything?"</p>

  <p>"Everything!"</p>

  <p>"What is your opinion?"</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I am twenty-five years old," she said. "Twenty-three years of my life
  have been spent in New York. I am a Russian only by instinct. I have yet to
  learn the temper of my people."</p>

  <p>"Never mind your lack of experience. Answer me from that instinct."</p>

  <p>She acquiesced unwillingly.</p>

  <p>"You have made Russia a great and prosperous country," she said. "You have
  succeeded in reducing her army by a million men. I do not see why you take
  this further risk."</p>

  <p>"Sophist," he growled. "Instinct only. I insist."</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Yesterday," she confided, "I looked upon the Royalist cause in Russia as
  a forlorn thing. Tomorrow, if you persist, I shall begin to wonder what it
  would feel like to marry Nicholas and be Tzarina of all the Russians."</p>

  <p>Samara seemed afflicted by a curious fit of lethargy after Catherine's
  departure. He sat in his great, bare room till the twilight filled it with
  shadows; until, in fact, he was disturbed by stealthy footsteps behind his
  chair. He turned abruptly round. A tall, gaunt figure was standing before the
  safe. Samara, after a second's scrutiny, withdrew his hand from the butt of
  the pistol towards which it had sprung.</p>

  <p>"Andrew!" he exclaimed. "What the devil are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>The young man faced him. Even in the gloom of the apartment the wound on
  his cheek was clearly visible.</p>

  <p>"I was restless, Master," he said. "I entered by the side gate. I have
  come to ask a favour."</p>

  <p>"What is it, and what has happened to you?" Samara demanded.</p>

  <p>"I have met with an accident," was the dreary confession. "Something very
  terrible has happened. I cannot breathe here in Moscow. I must get away."</p>

  <p>"Go on."</p>

  <p>"We were to start for London on Monday. Let me go by the early morning
  boat and wait for you there. There are things to be done before you arrive. I
  can see to them."</p>

  <p>"What have you been doing to yourself?" Samara asked, looking at the scar
  upon his face.</p>

  <p>"An accident has happened," Andrew replied. "A very terrible accident! I
  must get away at once. Give me permission to go to England, please."</p>

  <p>"Is this because Catherine Borans has been working for me to-day?" Samara
  inquired bluntly.</p>

  <p>Andrew shivered. He had winced at the sound of her name as though some one
  had struck him with a whip.</p>

  <p>"I have no more feeling of that sort," he groaned. "It is finished. I
  simply want to get away."</p>

  <p>Samara wrote a few lines upon a sheet of foolscap and passed them
  over.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he assented. "There is your order, and the name of the hotel
  where you will stay when you reach London. If all goes well I shall follow
  you on Thursday."</p>

  <p>"Aye, on Thursday," Andrew muttered.</p>

  <p>Samara glanced at him curiously.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen your doctor lately, Andrew?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>The young man laughed bitterly.</p>

  <p>"I am ill," he acknowledged, "but no doctor can cure me."</p>

  <p>Samara indulged in a moment's deliberation. Distinctly something had
  happened.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure that you are fit to travel?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"If I stay here for another day, I shall shoot myself or some one else.
  Better let me go. I am of no use to anyone just now. I could not work. I
  could not be trusted. Let me go, please."</p>

  <p>"You are talking foolishly, Andrew," his master declared. "I have trusted
  you with the secrets of my life. You could not betray me if you would. There
  is something beneath all this. Why not give me your confidence?"</p>

  <p>"It is too late," Andrew groaned, shuffling towards the door.</p>

  <p>Samara stopped him with an imperative monosyllable.</p>

  <p>"Andrew," he asked, "is it a woman who has done this? Well, I see it is. I
  am going to use the surgeon's knife. Never in this world could Catherine
  Borans be anything to you."</p>

  <p>The young man's face for a moment was like the face of a devil.</p>

  <p>"Blast you, don't I know it?" he cried. "Don't I know whose woman she is?
  That's why I'm getting away&mdash;why I choose hell rather than stay
  here!"</p>

  <p>For once his master's call was disobeyed. The slam of the door echoed
  through the huge, half-empty house. Samara's few seconds of spellbound
  agitation were all the start Andrew needed. He was gone!</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch29"
     id="ch29">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Catherine, standing that evening in a corner of her aunt's
  little <i>salon,</i> with Nicholas in close attendance, watched, with a
  disquietude which she found it hard to conceal, the continual stream of
  visitors pouring all the time through the open doors. Alexandria's first "At
  Home" six months ago had resulted in the visit of less than a dozen rather
  shabby, melancholy men and women, who seemed like the ghosts of their own
  unhappy pasts. Conversation had been almost pathetic and had consisted
  principally of reminiscences. They spoke of the great families which formed
  the connecting links between them, of the branches which had died out, of
  others whose members were scattered all over the world. To-day the memory of
  that first gathering seemed like a dream. There were at least a hundred and
  fifty visitors in the small suite of rooms, and more arriving all the time.
  The people, themselves, were different. There was an air of subdued interest,
  almost excitement, in their demeanour, a new spring in their walk, and a note
  of suppressed jubilance in many fragments of smothered conversation. Kirdorff
  was there in brilliant regimentals, surrounded by a little group of eager but
  cautious questioners. The names of the men and women who came and went so
  freely recalled all the splendours of a St. Petersburg Court of fifty years
  ago. Nicholas played with the hilt of his sword and stroked his incipient
  moustache with an almost fatuous air of self-satisfaction. Nearly every
  newcomer, after paying his or her respects to their hostess, came to address
  a few words to him. The presence of Mrs. Saxon J. Bossington, in a dress of
  magenta velvet with a hat to match, her neck and arms ablaze with jewels, and
  a priceless ermine stole about her shoulders, seemed the only discordant
  feature, and even she, through sheer magnificence, presented a striking
  appearance.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if all this is wise," Catherine murmured to her cousin.</p>

  <p>He smiled condescendingly.</p>

  <p>"You are afraid that it might offend your friend, Samara?" he observed
  with a superior smile.</p>

  <p>"Thanks to whom you are no longer selling bonds in New York," she retorted
  sharply. "As it happens, I was not thinking of Mr. Samara. Is not full- dress
  uniform now against the laws of the country?"</p>

  <p>"It may be," he admitted. "We shall soon make our own laws. Since that
  man's name has been mentioned, Catherine," he went on, "I have a word to say
  to you. The time has arrived when you should cease to be his secretary."</p>

  <p>"Why?" she inquired.</p>

  <p>He stared at her, as though astonished at her lack of comprehension.</p>

  <p>"In the beginning," he explained, "your position was naturally of great
  benefit to us. Those times are passing. When one thinks of the future, it
  will not do for people to be able to look back and remember the time when you
  were his paid assistant."</p>

  <p>"You seem quite sure that I am going to marry you," she remarked. "Is this
  because I have sent General von Hartsen back to Berlin?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all," he answered confidently. "It is your destiny to be Tzarina
  of all the Russias. The other scheme was absurd."</p>

  <p>"It seems almost a pity," she sighed, "that I was brought up in New
  York."</p>

  <p>"Why?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"One gets so foolishly democratic," she replied. "As a royal wooer I think
  I rather preferred Frederick. He quite lost his head about me."</p>

  <p>Nicholas laughed scornfully.</p>

  <p>"Frederick was a little premature," he observed. "Things may not move so
  quickly in Germany as he imagines. Tell me about General von Hartsen and his
  ridiculous mission. How did he take your refusal of his proposal?"</p>

  <p>"Badly," she answered. "He left before dinner was half over to catch the
  night boat to Berlin."</p>

  <p>"The worst of these Germans," he sneered, in a self-satisfied manner. "As
  soon as they are thwarted they lose their tempers."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Bossington sailed up to them and Nicholas promptly made his
  escape.</p>

  <p>"My dear," she exclaimed, "it's good to see some one who knew me in New
  York, where we were somebody! I am getting quite confused with all these
  Princesses and Duchesses and Grand Duchesses, and they tell me that, after
  all, even if Saxon does buy the whole of the Ardenburg estate&mdash;dozens
  and dozens of square miles, my dear&mdash;he will only be a Count!"</p>

  <p>"Well, that should do for a start," Catherine declared, smiling. "As a
  matter of fact," she went on, "if I were you, I wouldn't talk about it too
  much. I think my aunt and Nicholas and all of them here have rather lost
  their heads. To discuss such things openly, to speak of the future as we
  continually do, is treason to-day."</p>

  <p>"You don't think there's any doubt about this thing coming off?" Mrs.
  Bossington asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>"I prefer not to discuss it," Catherine replied. "I even go further. I
  think that it is in bad taste to speak of it as blatantly as my people are
  doing. After all, we are here on sufferance."</p>

  <p>"You came on sufferance, perhaps," Mrs. Bossington amended, "but you
  should hear what Colonel Kirdorff has to say about the army. Your friend Mr.
  Samara has been making himself pretty unpopular."</p>

  <p>"The army is still not Russia," Catherine reminded her.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Bossington smiled cryptically.</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether you are aware," she remarked, dropping her voice a
  little, "that I was admitted to the last meeting of Colonel Kirdorff's secret
  council. There were delegates from the southern provinces, from Petrograd,
  and I don't know how many places. They all seemed to agree that the peasants,
  at any rate, and the lower <i>bourgeoisie</i> all want their Tzar back again.
  As for the army, there is scarcely an officer who isn't a Royalist, since the
  Germans got the sack, and the soldiers themselves are all furious against
  Samara because of this talk of disbandment. Saxon's no slouch, my dear, as
  you know, and he declares the whole thing's a cinch, as long as it's managed
  on a business footing. I want him to take an interest in politics. A man with
  a business head like his would be worth having anywhere. If he were Finance
  Minister, for instance, he might easily be made a Prince."</p>

  <p>"I must go and talk to my aunt," Catherine said abruptly. "I quite realise
  all that you have done for my family and my friends, Mrs. Bossington, and I
  hope that some day you may be rewarded for it, but I earnestly advise you not
  to talk so openly of your hopes."</p>

  <p>She crossed the room towards where her aunt was seated, the centre of an
  animated little group. She was on the point of being surrounded herself when
  two new guests were announced. As though of a purpose, the major-domo who
  stood at the doors raised his voice as he spoke the names:</p>

  <p>"General Trotsk&mdash;Captain Irdron."</p>

  <p>The babel of conversation ceased as though by magic. It was amidst almost
  a complete silence that the two men, both clad in the plain dark uniform of
  the State Police, approached Alexandrina. The General saluted, as he came to
  a standstill before the hostess of the little assembly. Everybody seemed to
  recognise the sombre, almost menacing note which their arrival had
  introduced.</p>

  <p>"Madame," he said, "I have taken the liberty of paying you a visit. I beg
  leave to present my aide-de-camp, Captain Irdron."</p>

  <p>Alexandrina acknowledged the salute of her two visitors a little
  stiffly.</p>

  <p>"You are very welcome, General," she replied. "I do not remember, however,
  that your name is upon my visiting-list."</p>

  <p>"Madame," was the somewhat curt retort, "by virtue of my office under the
  Republic, my name is upon any visiting-list where I choose to place it. We
  will, since you prefer it, consider my visit official."</p>

  <p>He saluted again and, turning deliberately away, murmured a word or two to
  his companion, who appeared to be taking notes of the names of some of those
  present. He exchanged a few cold words with Catherine.</p>

  <p>"You find time occasionally, then, mademoiselle, to attend social
  functions," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"One has one's family duties," Catherine rejoined with faint irony.</p>

  <p>The General turned on his heel. The silence in the room remained unbroken.
  Every one was curious, a little agitated. The Minister of Police approached
  Kirdorff, who was talking to Nicholas. His expression was grim and official.
  The atmosphere of the <i>salon</i> became tense.</p>

  <p>"Sir," he said, addressing Kirdorff, "I have to inform you that you are
  wearing a uniform which is contrary to the regulations of the Republican
  Government of Russia."</p>

  <p>"In what respects is it at fault?" Kirdorff inquired.</p>

  <p>"In every respect, sir," Trotsk answered harshly. "The uniforms worn by
  the officers in the Republican Army are supplied by Commissariat Department
  C. You are wearing a full-dress uniform of the monarchical army, abolished by
  law in nineteen-nineteen. Your name, sir!" he asked, turning to Nicholas.</p>

  <p>"Nicholas Imanoff," was the contemptuous reply. "I was not aware that a
  policeman had anything to do with the uniform of the army."</p>

  <p>The smile of the Minister of Police was gentle, almost urbane.</p>

  <p>"Naturally you are ignorant of Russia and its military regulations," he
  murmured. "You have, I think, lived all your life in New York and been
  engaged in other pursuits. You will report at the War Office, to the Chief of
  the Staff, within a quarter of an hour. He will give you further
  instructions."</p>

  <p>Kirdorff laid his hand on Nicholas' shoulder in time to check an angry
  retort.</p>

  <p>"By what authority, sir, do you of the police," he demanded, "issue orders
  to officers in the Russian Army?"</p>

  <p>The Minister smiled.</p>

  <p>"Your long absence from the country, sir, is your only excuse for such a
  question," he declared. "I represent the supreme power in the
  country&mdash;the Armies of the Service of the State. You can obey my orders
  voluntarily or, in five minutes, under escort."</p>

  <p>There was a brief pause. Kirdorff turned away, bowed low and raised his
  hostess's fingers to his lips.</p>

  <p>"Madame," he whispered, "we do well to bend. Nothing must prevent my being
  able to rejoin the army."</p>

  <p>"I have confidence in you, Colonel," she assured him. The two men left the
  room. As soon as he was sure of their absence, the Chief of the Police
  himself saluted Alexandrina.</p>

  <p>"Madame," he said, "I regret to have interrupted your social gathering and
  to have deprived you of doubtless honoured guests. I shall now take my
  departure. For the present," he added, "it is sufficient for me to remind you
  that in this city you are the guests of the Russian Republic."</p>

  <p>"I am a Russian citizeness," Alexandrina answered, with a touch of hauteur
  in her tone; "my opinions and my actions are a matter for my own
  conscience."</p>

  <p>The Grand Duchess had at least the triumph of the last word, for her
  visitor made no reply. He left the room followed by his attendant. There was
  a little gasp as the door was closed behind them, a silence broken by old
  Prince Dromidor, eighty-seven years of age, back from his little villa at
  Kensington, after thirty years' absence from his country, to pay his respects
  to the returned refugees.</p>

  <p>"It is the beginning," he cried. "They have shown their fear."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Saxon J. Bossington laid her hand upon Catherine's arm.</p>

  <p>"My dear," she said impressively, "let me put you wise to one thing. I've
  lived in New York and I know. Don't let your aunt get in wrong with the
  police. What was he, an inspector or an assistant commissioner?"</p>

  <p>Catherine smiled.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact," she confided, "he is a Cabinet Minister. He is one
  of the three who, with Mr. Samara, rule Russia."</p>

  <p>"Really!" Mrs. Bossington murmured, with some chagrin. "And I never met
  him!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch30"
     id="ch30">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Samara greeted Catherine with a grin of delight when, in
  response to his telephone summons, she appeared at Government House on the
  following morning. General Trotsk's report had appealed immensely to his
  sense of humour.</p>

  <p>"So your aunt is giving Royalist tea-parties," he remarked, "and your
  relatives are sporting the uniforms of the Imperial Guard. Were you there
  when the fun began?"</p>

  <p>"I was there," she admitted. "I didn't think it very funny."</p>

  <p>"You are quite right," he confessed. "It is not funny. It is pathetic.
  These people have lived in the past so long that they have taught themselves
  to believe in its reincarnation. All the same, your aunt seems to have been
  behaving very badly."</p>

  <p>Catherine shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Is there any reason why she should not entertain her old friends?" she
  inquired.</p>

  <p>"Not the slightest," Samara agreed. "I should not have interfered in a
  thousand years. Trotsk takes himself too seriously. He speaks already of the
  Royalist movement&mdash;as though there could be such a thing."</p>

  <p>"General Trotsk may err too much in one direction," Catherine observed.
  "As an impartial looker-on, I should say that you erred too much in
  another."</p>

  <p>"Are you an impartial looker-on?" he asked quickly. "Trotsk will have it
  that you are one of the gang."</p>

  <p>"I am a Royalist at heart, of course," she acknowledged, "but I am not a
  conspirator."</p>

  <p>"What have you been doing to Andrew Kroupki?" he asked abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Quarrelled with him, more or less," she replied. "As a matter of fact,
  the quarrel was not of my seeking. He insulted me the other morning."</p>

  <p>"Is it true that you knocked him down?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," Catherine admitted. "I was delighted to find how strong I
  was."</p>

  <p>Samara looked at her gravely.</p>

  <p>"It is a terrible thing," he declared, "for a man to strike a woman,
  although she often deserves it. For a woman to strike a man is a tragedy.
  What was his offence?"</p>

  <p>Catherine had seated herself at her table a few yards away. She swung
  round and faced her questioner.</p>

  <p>"He asked me if you were my lover," she said coolly.</p>

  <p>"A very natural question," he remarked, taking up a pile of letters and
  beginning to look them through. "Was that your only provocation?"</p>

  <p>She turned away, opened her desk, and drew out her work.</p>

  <p>"I have always understood," she reflected, "that the standard of morals
  amongst the educated portion of the Russian <i>bourgeoisie</i> was
  exceedingly low."</p>

  <p>"Meaning me?" he asked cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"The cap, alas, does not fit," he assured her. "I have no pretensions to
  rank amongst the <i>bourgeoisie.</i> I am of peasant stock."</p>

  <p>"You do not surprise me," she replied.</p>

  <p>He rose to his feet and set into operation the machinery which unlocked
  the great private safe. In a minute or two he appeared with a roll of
  manuscript.</p>

  <p>"Please get on with this manifesto," he begged. "You are at your best this
  morning. It would be a pity to waste such intelligence."</p>

  <p>She took the papers.</p>

  <p>"I should like to know what has become of Andrew," she said.</p>

  <p>"He has gone to London as my advance-agent. I do not think that he will
  ever come back&mdash;unless you leave me. Of course," he went on, "if this
  little tea-party scheme of your aunt's comes off, you are booked for the part
  of Tzarina, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"There is always that hope," she admitted.</p>

  <p>"Heaven preserve me from another woman secretary!" he exclaimed. "One
  never gets the last word."</p>

  <p>Catherine was studiously silent. Samara waited for a moment or two. Then
  he left the room, slamming the door violently. It was an hour before he
  returned, and when he did he closed the door behind him and locked it.
  Catherine looked up questioningly.</p>

  <p>"What is that for?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"So that you don't leave me before I am ready for you to go," he answered.
  "Also to make sure that we are not interrupted."</p>

  <p>"It seems a little absurd," she complained. "I have no idea of going until
  I have finished my work."</p>

  <p>"How long will that take you?"</p>

  <p>"Another half an hour."</p>

  <p>"Finish it, then," he directed. "Afterwards I have something to say to
  you."</p>

  <p>She continued her task. Samara studied a handful of the documents which he
  had brought back with him, signing some and throwing others on one side. Once
  or twice he spoke on the telephone. Finally Catherine turned towards him.</p>

  <p>"I have finished," she announced. "Will you check my transcription?"</p>

  <p>"Presently," he acquiesced.</p>

  <p>"You had something to say to me," she reminded him.</p>

  <p>"I had. I find that, after all, old Trotsk wasn't such an idiot. There is
  a genuine monarchist plot afoot."</p>

  <p>She sat watching him, without faltering, with no sign of self-
  consciousness.</p>

  <p>"Started in your aunt's drawing-room, without a doubt," he went on,
  "subscribed to and joined in by all that shabby down-at-heel crew I brought
  home from a second-rate American boarding-house, making its way in the army,
  they tell me&mdash;especially the Second Army. Do you know that I have to
  postpone my journey to England and go down to Odensk to harangue these
  recalcitrant subjects. That's the result of trying to make good Russians of
  men like Kirdorff and Orenburg. What do they care about Russia? It's their
  blasted selves they think of."</p>

  <p>"They have a right to their convictions," she rejoined.</p>

  <p>"And I have a right to have them shot," he answered. "They've been guilty
  of treason against the State. Trotsk has just given me a copy of Kirdorff's
  speeches to the Fourth Army Corps. He should have been tried by court-martial
  and shot a few months ago. I hate to kill fools, but something must be done.
  Trotsk would have the whole lot out of the country or facing the firing line
  in ten minutes, and I am not sure that he isn't right. Advise me, Miss
  Secretary. What am I to do with this nest of vipers? Not much poison about
  them, but enough to hurt, Trotsk says. Tell me how to deal with them."</p>

  <p>"Too great a responsibility for me," she replied.</p>

  <p>"What if I were to shoot Nicholas Imanoff, or banish him?" he suggested.
  "There isn't another Imanoff amongst them. They can't make a Tzar out of an
  ordinary person, can they&mdash;even an aristocrat?"</p>

  <p>"There is me," she remarked meditatively. "I am an Imanoff. They might
  make me Tzarina and permit me to choose my consort."</p>

  <p>"You had a predecessor," he reminded her scornfully. "A pretty mess you'd
  make of things!"</p>

  <p>"That would depend upon my consort," she replied. "I might choose you. How
  would you like that?"</p>

  <p>He stood like a statue, looking at her across the bare, lofty room. She
  was not near enough to see the knuckles whiten about his clenched fists, or
  to catch the fugitive gleam of something unusual in his hard, brilliant eyes.
  She noticed with surprise, however, the slight break in his voice.</p>

  <p>"Curse you, can't you ever be serious?" he exclaimed. "I've a good mind to
  throw the lot of them into prison."</p>

  <p>"I should only intercede on behalf of my aunt," Catherine assured him.
  "She is really quite a dear old thing, but Tzardom to her is very much like
  his Bible to an English Methodist."</p>

  <p>The private telephone on Samara's table rang. He picked up the receiver
  and listened for a moment or two, frowning. Then he nodded and laid it
  down.</p>

  <p>"Your friends," he said, turning to Catherine, "are beginning to annoy me.
  Trotsk is outside with an amazing story. You had better stop and listen to
  what he has to say."</p>

  <p>General Trotsk was ushered in shortly afterwards. He entered the room and
  saluted, looking grimmer than ever.</p>

  <p>"Sir," he announced, "I have a report to make."</p>

  <p>The visitor indicated Catherine with a little wave of the hand. Samara
  only smiled.</p>

  <p>"I should prefer you to speak before Miss Borans," he said. "I have a
  certain amount of confidence in her, but apart from that, she is in a way
  responsible for my ever having invited this nest of conspirators over
  here."</p>

  <p>"Miss Borans may yet find, then, that her responsibility is a heavy one,"
  General Trotsk declared, with portentous coldness. "I have already reported,
  sir," he continued, "that I found Colonel Kirdorff and Lieutenant Nicholas
  Imanoff attending a private function yesterday, wearing the uniform of the
  late Imperial Army. I ordered them to report at once at the War Office. It
  has come to my knowledge that they failed to do so. They left the city
  instead, travelling by motor-car in the direction of Odensk."</p>

  <p>Samara nodded.</p>

  <p>"Well," he remarked, "I suppose you did not allow them to get very
  far?"</p>

  <p>"They were arrested by my orders at Miltou," the General went on, "and
  were brought back to the city under escort. I am here to ask your
  instructions, sir. The Minister of War is at Odensk, as is also General
  Denkers, commanding the Second Army."</p>

  <p>Samara glanced at his watch.</p>

  <p>"Bring them here at three o'clock," he directed. "I will deal with this
  matter summarily."</p>

  <p>The Minister of Police saluted.</p>

  <p>"I have your permission, sir, to speak frankly?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"By all means," Samara replied. "You can discard officialdom altogether if
  you will. Light a cigarette and speak to me as my trusted Minister."</p>

  <p>The Minister of Police made no movement toward the box of cigarettes which
  Samara proffered. Catherine was watching him from across the room with
  fascinated eyes. There was something inhuman about this man's slow,
  deliberate speech, his waxen complexion, his lack of all earnestness;
  something sinister about the cold detachment of his voice.</p>

  <p>"My reports as to the condition of the <i>morale</i> of the Second Army
  are unsatisfactory," he declared. "These two men in their persons and by
  their precepts have broken the laws of Russia and are largely responsible for
  the disaffection. I recommend that under Section Seven of the Military
  Discipline Act they be shot this afternoon. It is possible that such action
  will avert grave results."</p>

  <p>"I shall bear what you say seriously in mind, General," Samara
  promised.</p>

  <p>The Minister of Police saluted stiffly and withdrew. Samara waited until
  the door was closed behind him.</p>

  <p>"You heard Trotsk's suggestions," he observed, turning to Catherine. "It
  seems to me that your chances of wearing that crown are slipping away."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch31"
     id="ch31">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Samara broke through precedent that afternoon. He consented
  to receive a visitor who came without an appointment. Alexandrina, her
  good-humoured face wrinkled with anxiety, her clothes badly arranged, and out
  of breath already with the exertion of climbing the long flight of steps and
  crossing the great stone hall of Government House, was ushered into his
  presence. Nothing of the <i>grande dame</i> remained but her manner.</p>

  <p>"I owe you my thanks for receiving me, Mr. Samara," she said, as he rose
  to greet her. "Will you allow me to sit down? I am out of breath. I remember
  your house and that flight of steps when it was the palace of my cousin, the
  Grand Duke Cyril. In those days, however, steps meant nothing to me."</p>

  <p>Samara placed a chair for her with grave courtesy and returned to his own
  seat. He preserved his somewhat ominous demeanour.</p>

  <p>"I have been trying to find my niece," Alexandrina continued. "At
  Government Buildings they would not admit me. I thought, perhaps, that she
  might be here."</p>

  <p>"She will arrive in half an hour," Samara confided. "She is now at
  Government Buildings, finishing some work for me. If you would care to wait
  for her here, my housekeeper shall show you a <i>salon</i> where you may be
  comfortable."</p>

  <p>"Thank you very much," was the grateful reply, "but since I am fortunate
  enough to have your ear for a moment, I will tell you my mission. I came to
  ask Catherine to intercede with you on behalf of my hot-headed nephew and
  Colonel Kirdorff."</p>

  <p>"On what grounds, madame?" Samara asked.</p>

  <p>"Nicholas is young and he is an Imanoff," she said. "This is his Russia by
  the grace of God. How can he be expected to yield to the discipline of an
  artificial constitution?"</p>

  <p>A slight smile played about Samara's lips. This was greater candour than
  he had expected.</p>

  <p>"Madame," he reminded her, "I did myself the honour of paying you a visit
  a few weeks ago. Rumours of the activities of your friends had reached me. I
  offered you then a warning. You had accepted the hospitality of the
  Republican Government of Russia. In plotting against it, you or any other
  were guilty of a dishonourable action."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Samara," Alexandrina said simply, "I cannot argue with you. I live by
  my convictions. You are without doubt a great statesman and you have been a
  great benefactor to this country. I appeal to you only as a man. I beg that
  you will not treat Nicholas' misdemeanour too seriously."</p>

  <p>"I have heard you, madame," Samara replied. "I can make you no promise. I
  am the servant of the State."</p>

  <p>The Grand Duchess rose to her feet. Samara's face was like stone. She knew
  very well that further speech was useless.</p>

  <p>"At least," she concluded, "I thank you for receiving me. I read in New
  York, and I have been told here, that your r&eacute;gime in this country is
  one of mercy. I shall pray for your forbearance, sir, and for you, if you
  extend it to my nephew."</p>

  <p>She left the room, escorted by Ivan, and without further word from Samara.
  He sat in his chair for a time, thoughtfully studying the mass of papers by
  which he was surrounded. Presently Catherine entered, carrying her
  despatch-box. She came straight over to his desk.</p>

  <p>"The work is finished," she announced. "You will remember that Andrew is
  not here. Do you wish me to communicate with the Chief of the Ministerial
  Printing-Press?"</p>

  <p>"Presently," he answered. "Lock the despatch-box in the safe."</p>

  <p>"I do not understand the mechanism," she reminded him.</p>

  <p>He rose to his feet and began to demonstrate it. She suddenly seized his
  arm.</p>

  <p>"Why do you trust me like this?" she expostulated. "You seem surer of me
  than I am of myself."</p>

  <p>"I must trust some one," he observed. "Andrew was the only other person
  who knew the secret, and he is not available."</p>

  <p>"But why me?" she protested. "You know that there are reasons why you
  should not."</p>

  <p>"I trust or distrust by instinct only," he replied. "I govern in the same
  way."</p>

  <p>"Then you make a gamble of life and government," she declared. "Sooner or
  later the crash will come."</p>

  <p>"Meanwhile, watch me," he directed. "The combinations you will have to
  learn . . . ."</p>

  <p>Presently the telephone-bell rang. He took down the receiver and his face
  hardened as he listened.</p>

  <p>"In ten minutes," he decided.</p>

  <p>Catherine turned towards the door. He called her back.</p>

  <p>"Have you nothing further to say to me?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," she answered.</p>

  <p>"You know that your aunt has been here?"</p>

  <p>"I have been told so," she admitted. "I can add nothing to what she has
  probably already said."</p>

  <p>"Your personality might have more weight," he suggested.</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Put it in the scale, then, by all means," she enjoined.</p>

  <p>"In plain words," he persisted, "you are too proud to ask a favour of
  me."</p>

  <p>"I know you too well," she assured him. "You will do what you choose, what
  you think fit and right. Nothing that I or anybody else in the world could
  say would make any difference."</p>

  <p>Her hand was upon the door. Again he called her back.</p>

  <p>"I desire you to remain during my interview with your friends," he said.
  "They will be here almost immediately."</p>

  <p>"Why should I be present?" she asked coldly.</p>

  <p>"So that you may know the truth without perversion. Go to your desk in the
  alcove. You can hear there but you will be invisible."</p>

  <p>She still hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I have every instinct towards insubordination," she told him.</p>

  <p>"Conquer them," he insisted. "I may need you to bear witness for me in the
  future."</p>

  <p>She had scarcely reached her alcove before General Trotsk was ushered in.
  Kirdorff and Nicholas Imanoff followed, wearing military greatcoats buttoned
  to their throats. Behind came a guard of two soldiers with fixed bayonets.
  The Minister of Police saluted.</p>

  <p>"According to your instructions, sir," he announced.</p>

  <p>Samara seated himself at his desk. Kirdorff and Imanoff stood opposite to
  him; on either side of them a soldier, the Minister of Police, immovable and
  grave, a few feet away.</p>

  <p>"Boris Kirdorff and Nicholas Imanoff," Samara began, "less than twelve
  months ago you accepted my offer to return to this country and become Russian
  citizens. I gave you both posts in the Republican Army. I told you that I was
  prepared to view your monarchical principles with toleration. Every one in
  this country has a right to his own opinions and has a right also to
  ventilate them. So far as you could influence people openly and honourably,
  by lectures and literature, you were at liberty to do so. You have ignored
  the honourable means of propaganda. You have stooped not only to underground
  conspiracy, but to conspiracy with a foreign power. You have made use of your
  position in the army to initiate a seditious plot amongst the soldiers of the
  State, directed against this Republic. Do you require evidence? I can give it
  to you."</p>

  <p>"I desire no evidence," Kirdoff replied. "It is quite true that I have
  endeavoured to awaken the people of Russia to a sense of what is due to
  themselves and their natural ruler."</p>

  <p>"And I," Nicholas added, "being by descent and the Grace of God, Tzar of
  all the Russias, can be guilty of treason to no one."</p>

  <p>"A very comfortable self-assurance," Samara remarked with a faint sneer.
  "To proceed to a minor point. You were discovered yesterday wearing a uniform
  which is contrary to the regulations of the army in which you serve."</p>

  <p>"So long as there is a Russian army," Nicholas argued, "so long must there
  be a regiment of Imperial Guards."</p>

  <p>"An entire fallacy," Samara assured him. "To continue. You were directed
  by the Chief of Police to report at the War Office. You failed to do so."</p>

  <p>"We are only subject to military discipline," Kirdorff observed.</p>

  <p>"You display a shameless ignorance of existing conditions," Samara said
  sternly. "The Chief of Police ranks as a Major-General in the army. To
  disobey his orders amounts to gross insubordination, the penalty for which
  you know."</p>

  <p>"On a technical point," Kirdorff admitted, "we appear to be guilty. I have
  never in my experience connected any part of the civil administration with
  the army."</p>

  <p>"It should be your duty to learn the regulations of the army whose uniform
  you wear and whose pay you draw," Samara reminded them coldly. "You are both,
  on your own showing, guilty of military insubordination and treason against
  the Army of the Republic. The penalty for both offences is death."</p>

  <p>"I demand to be tried by court-martial," Kirdorff exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"And I," Nicholas echoed.</p>

  <p>"Again your ignorance of the regulations amazes me," Samara declared. "I
  am the Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Republican Army. I and General
  Trotsk form an ever-existing court-martial, empowered to deal summarily with
  any cases which we direct to be brought before us."</p>

  <p>For the first time both men lost confidence. Nicholas' air of somewhat
  fatuous bravado had disappeared and he was tugging nervously at his
  moustache. Kirdorff was obviously taken aback.</p>

  <p>"Your republic, then," he ventured, "is a more autocratic institution than
  any monarchy which I remember."</p>

  <p>"Your criticism may be just, but it is irrelevant," Samara observed. "We
  are a competent tribunal; your offences are acknowledged. The penalty is
  beyond dispute. Have you anything further to say as to why this sentence
  should not be carried out upon you?"</p>

  <p>"The army will rise to a man," Nicholas threatened, shaking with
  emotion.</p>

  <p>"Young sir," Samara enjoined, "you would be wiser to omit all mention of
  an army in which you have served merely to gain your own purposes.
  Furthermore, half-past five is the time at which our firing-parties generally
  parade. Odensk is some distance away."</p>

  <p>Nicholas was almost beside himself with mingled fear and passion.</p>

  <p>"It is unheard of, this," he cried. "I have still my American citizenship.
  I appeal!"</p>

  <p>"Spare me a few illusions," Samara begged. "For a Russian seeking to
  obtain a lofty position in his own country by virtue of his birth, to attempt
  to shelter himself in a moment of danger under a foreign flag is scarcely in
  accord with the traditions of your race. Now, listen to me, both of you. I
  have addressed you as a judge to the offenders brought before him. Your crime
  is admitted. The penalty is acknowledged. Now, I am going to speak to you as
  one human being to another."</p>

  <p>A sudden gleam of hope flashed in Kirdorff's eyes. Samara paused for a few
  minutes as though to collect his thoughts.</p>

  <p>"From the point of view of an ordinary human being," he continued, "you
  two cannot be judged as normal malefactors. Behind everything that you have
  done there stands, if not an excuse, a reason. How you can justify yourselves
  as men of honour, I do not know. You have accepted my invitation to come
  here. You accepted the positions I offered you in the army, and you started
  at once to plot against the Government of a country which has never been so
  stable and prosperous as she is to-day. I will still bear with you. I will
  look upon you as men afflicted with a Jesuitical turn of mind. You believe
  that the code of honour may be abnegated if the cause itself is a great
  cause. You believe that Russia would be better governed by a monarchy than it
  is as a Republic. I believe the contrary. Very well. Go and preach your
  doctrines, and I will preach mine. If you can convert this country to Tzardom
  do so. Only, do it, in future, openly, not by conspiracies and sedition.
  Don't pretend to be faithful soldiers of the Republic, when you only wear
  their uniform to preach treason against it."</p>

  <p>The two men stood with their eyes fastened upon Samara. Nicholas was
  moistening his lips nervously. Kirdorff had already realised that respite was
  at hand. The most gloomy figure was that of the Minister of Police.</p>

  <p>"My decision is this," Samara concluded, turning to the latter. "You will
  escort these two ex-soldiers of the Republic to your headquarters, where you
  will strip them of their uniforms and provide them with civilian clothes. You
  will expunge their names from the Army List, but you will give them passes to
  cross the lines at Odensk and to travel wherever they will in the country.
  That is all. Remove your prisoners, General."</p>

  <p>"We are to be set free?" Nicholas gasped.</p>

  <p>"I hoped that I had made myself clear," Samara observed drily.</p>

  <p>"You will permit me to say, sir," Kirdorff ventured, "that you are
  treating us in an extremely chivalrous fashion."</p>

  <p>Samara rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I do not desire your thanks," he said. "As criminals, I have absolved
  you. As men of honour, I shall be glad to be relieved of your presence."</p>

  <p>The Minister of Police knew better than to argue. He made his protest,
  however.</p>

  <p>"You have allowed yourself the luxury of quixotic altruism, sir," he said,
  "at the expense of your duty to the Republic."</p>

  <p>"That may be the verdict of posterity, General," Samara replied. "If so, I
  must accept it."</p>

  <p>The little procession filed out, Kirdorff and Nicholas alike momentarily
  drained of dignity, men to whom unexpected generosity had brought a sense of
  shame. Samara sat still at his desk and waited. There came no sign from
  Catherine. He rose to his feet and crossed the room at last to her alcove. On
  the threshold he stood still amazed. She was leaning forward, her head buried
  in her hands, her shoulders convulsed. He came a little nearer.</p>

  <p>"Catherine," he said quietly.</p>

  <p>She held out her hand towards him without looking up. He gripped it
  tightly. Then he leaned over her. He asked no questions&mdash;there was that
  much of understanding between them. He kissed her fingers tenderly and turned
  away. Ivan's stentorian voice was announcing the arrival of his Cabinet in
  the outer room.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch32"
     id="ch32">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Catherine, a little tired, a little anxious, more than a
  little unhappy, lay stretched upon the sofa in her aunt's drawing-room,
  smoking an after luncheon cigarette. Opposite her, Alexandrina, with
  half-a-dozen newspapers by her side, her spectacles slipped on to the edge of
  her nose, her voice unsteady with excitement, was reading aloud occasional
  paragraphs.</p>

  <p>"Listen to this, Catherine!" she exclaimed. "This is from the leading
  socialist paper in Berlin:</p>

  <p align="center"><i><b>"THE POLITICAL CRISES STILL CONTINUES."</b></i></p>

  <blockquote>
    "<i>Herr Brandt has confessed himself wholly unable to form a ministry and
    Dr. Beither has also refused responsibility. Meanwhile the Imperialist
    Party have openly avowed that they are in a position at any time to form a
    government which will command the entire support of the whole country.
    Prince Frederick is unable to leave his house in the Whilhelmstrasse owing
    to the crowds which surround it night and day. The announcement of a change
    of constitution is expected hourly."</i>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Catherine listened unmoved.</p>

  <p>"I seem to have missed a great chance," she murmured. "The young man was
  very much in love with me."</p>

  <p>Alexandrina smiled.</p>

  <p>"You are of the fortunate ones of the earth, Catherine," she said. "No
  other woman in history has quite occupied your position. You could have been
  Kaiserin of Germany, and instead you will become Tzarina of Russia."</p>

  <p>Catherine poured herself out some coffee from the copper-pot which stood
  by her side. She clapped her hands, and a somewhat uncouth-looking Russian
  servant entered.</p>

  <p>"Sugar, Paul," she ordered, "and the samovar for Her Highness. See if that
  is a later edition of the paper they are calling in the street, too."</p>

  <p>The man withdrew stolidly.</p>

  <p>"Even if the Royalists succeed in Germany," Catherine continued, "I cannot
  see that our chances are much improved. They have no Samara to deal with
  there."</p>

  <p>"Gabriel Samara is a great man," her aunt admitted, "but his dominion is
  on the wane. His ministers have allowed all the power to drift into his hands
  simply because they have had no will to resist. Many have resented it,
  however. His final proposals with regard to the completion of this
  demobilisation scheme are unpopular throughout the whole country. They only
  passed the Duma by less than a dozen votes."</p>

  <p>Catherine leaned back thoughtfully, with her hands clasped around her
  knees.</p>

  <p>"He is rash, like all great men," she said. "He should have gone more
  quietly with these altruistic ventures of his. The people do not understand,
  and he is always a little impatient of opposition. But he has genius, and a
  man with genius is not easily crushed."</p>

  <p>The servant returned with the sugar and the evening paper. Alexandrina
  glanced the latter through.</p>

  <p>"Nothing fresh," she declared. "Samara is to address the last of his
  series of meetings at Odensk to-night."</p>

  <p>The door was thrown open. General Orenburg was announced. They both turned
  towards him eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Any news?" Catherine asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing within the last few hours," the General answered, seating himself
  by his hostess' side on the divan. "I came, wondering whether you had heard
  anything from Kirdorff."</p>

  <p>"Nothing," Alexandrina replied. "The news from Berlin is amazing."</p>

  <p>"Amazing indeed," Orenburg assented. "Six months ago the German Liberal
  Party appeared to have an ample majority and to be thoroughly established.
  The Imperialists scarcely dared to let their voices be heard. They were the
  weakest party in the State. Now a cataclysm seems to have taken place, a
  fever seems to have spread throughout the country. Every moment one expects
  to hear that Frederick has been proclaimed Kaiser."</p>

  <p>"What do you think about the position here?" Catherine inquired
  curiously.</p>

  <p>"In the light of what has happened in Germany, it is hard to say," the
  General admitted. "Six months ago, Samara was his country's god, and the Duma
  were prepared to follow him blindly. If there had been another election he
  could have nominated every candidate. To-day there seems to be a strange
  undercurrent of political reaction. The people do not understand this
  demobilisation. The peasants and work-people are afraid of undue competition,
  the soldiers of privations, the <i>bourgeoisie</i> of invasion. They have
  suddenly begun to wonder whether their idol is only a great theorist. How far
  the pendulum will swing back, I cannot tell. We know that Russian people are
  faithful and dogged. It seems hard to believe that in a few months' time they
  could forget and discard the man who slew their dragon."</p>

  <p>"Samara has ruled Russia for fifteen years," Alexandrina said
  solemnly&mdash; "ruled her for her own good, we must admit, but ruled her
  like an autocrat. All the same, just as I believe in God as our spiritual
  Master, so I believe that every human being is born with the reverent
  instinct and desire for temporal government by an anointed head. Germany's
  period of madness lasted for a short time only. When France, too, comes to
  her senses and an Emperor reigns once more at Versailles, then the wounds of
  the world will be healed, and not before. So far as we are concerned, there
  has never been a time like the present. If we can secure the army, our moment
  may have arrived."</p>

  <p>Once more the door was hurriedly opened, this time to admit a more
  unexpected arrival. Nicholas Imanoff entered, wearing a long, brown leather
  coat and carrying dark spectacles in his hand. He was still a little
  breathless and had the air of one who has just concluded a rapid journey.</p>

  <p>"Have you heard the news from Berlin?" he cried.</p>

  <p>"Nothing for some hours," Orenburg replied.</p>

  <p>"Frederick was proclaimed Kaiser early this afternoon!" he announced. "The
  whole city is <i>en</i> <i>f&ecirc;te,</i> and to-morrow has been declared a
  national holiday!"</p>

  <p>"Wonderful!" Alexandrina murmured, the tears standing in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"What news of Odensk?" the General asked.</p>

  <p>"Samara is like King Canute," Nicholas pronounced. "He has a great
  following there. He is enthusiastically received, but the men are on our
  side, and he cannot keep back the tide."</p>

  <p>"You have a mission here?" Orenburg inquired.</p>

  <p>The young man nodded, threw his coat over the back of a chair, and called
  to the domestic for brandy.</p>

  <p>"I have flown from Odensk," he explained. "All goes well, but one of our
  recruits insists that there are now in print secret orders to every army
  corps commander, to be issued some time within the next week, which might
  affect our plans. It is absolutely necessary that we get hold of those
  orders."</p>

  <p>He looked across at Catherine. She tossed her cigarette into the fire and
  smiled at him pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"You seem to have established a secret service already, Nicholas," she
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"Kirdorff is organiser," he acknowledged. "I speak in his name. It is he
  who found out about these proclamations and secret orders. They are in code
  at present, but I think we could find some one who could deal with them. Do
  you know anything about them, Catherine?"</p>

  <p>"Very likely," she replied.</p>

  <p>"Splendid!" he exclaimed enthusiastically. "Kirdorff hates mystery. He had
  always felt that Samara had something up his sleeve, or he would never have
  dared to make this an open struggle."</p>

  <p>"'Dare' is scarcely the word to use in connection with Samara," Catherine
  observed. "He may have made glorious mistakes, but he has the courage of a
  lion."</p>

  <p>"No one wishes to deny that Samara is a great man," Nicholas declared a
  little impatiently. "His time is over, though. If he behaves sensibly and
  leaves the country without provoking a conflict, no harm will happen to him.
  Catherine, I want a copy of that secret order. I shall fly back with it to
  Odensk to-night."</p>

  <p>"How do you know that I can give it to you?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"That is of no consequence," he answered. "The knowledge has come to us.
  It was you alone who worked for Samara on the day when he thought out his
  scheme. Why do you hesitate? What other reason had you for working for this
  man than to aid the cause?"</p>

  <p>Catherine rose from the sofa, shook out her skirt and stood by her aunt's
  side.</p>

  <p>"Aunt," she said, "what is your opinion? I became Mr. Samara's secretary,
  intending to betray him at the first possible opportunity. I am still a
  Royalist, I am still as anxious as any of you to see Nicholas Tzar of Russia.
  On the other hand, Samara is a great and honourable man. Shall I do
  well&mdash;I, a Princess Royal of Russia&mdash;to betray his confidence?"</p>

  <p>Alexandrina looked a little disturbed. She was almost brutally frank.</p>

  <p>"My dear," she confided, "I never dreamed that you would hesitate for a
  single moment."</p>

  <p>Catherine turned to Orenburg.</p>

  <p>"What is your opinion, General?" she asked him.</p>

  <p>"I sympathise with your position, Princess," he said, "but the Cause must
  come before everything."</p>

  <p>Catherine was standing in the glow of a tall rose-shaded electric
  standard. Her expression was unusually serious. Nicholas, fresh from the drab
  barbarities of a huge garrison cantonment, thought that she had never
  appeared so desirable.</p>

  <p>"The best friends in the world," she said, "must sometimes agree to
  differ. I am a Royalist, and by any honourable means I would try to help
  Nicholas. The thing you ask of me I will not do."</p>

  <p>"You desert us?" Nicholas exclaimed passionately.</p>

  <p>"I do nothing of the sort," she replied. "I am against Samara; I am for
  you, but let us fight fairly. Samara himself has set you a great
  example."</p>

  <p>Nicholas poured himself out some more brandy. His fingers were shaking. He
  dared not trust himself to speech. Alexandrina stretched out her hand and
  took up her knitting.</p>

  <p>"If Catherine has made up her mind," she remarked, "it is of no use trying
  to change her."</p>

  <p>"The young are like that," General Orenburg agreed with quiet resignation.
  "As they grow older the light they carry burns less brightly, and the journey
  becomes easier. The Princess must have her way."</p>

  <p>Nicholas indulged in one final outburst. He set down his tumbler empty and
  caught up his coat.</p>

  <p>"I am to go back, then, and report failure," he protested. "I am to report
  that whilst we may sell our souls and bodies for the Cause, my affianced wife
  has scruples about betraying the confidences of a usurper. We shall find
  another way into the secret, though. Be sure of that."</p>

  <p>"I doubt it," Catherine rejoined coldly.</p>

  <p>Nicholas forgot for a moment to be cautious.</p>

  <p>"You think that it is your secret and his alone," he sneered. "You are
  mistaken. There is another."</p>

  <p>"There is only Andrew Kroupki," she declared, "and he is in London."</p>

  <p>Nicholas buttoned up his coat without a word.</p>

  <p>"I had hoped to stay a little longer," he said, kissing his aunt's
  fingers. "Catherine's decision drives me back to the camp at once, however. I
  must let them know of my failure."</p>

  <p>He hurried off. Between Catherine and him there passed only the slightest
  of farewells. They heard the front door slam and the sound of his automobile
  driving away. Alexandrina rose with a little sigh, fetched the cribbage board
  and sat down opposite to the General. Catherine moved to the window and stood
  listening to the cry of the newspaper boys in the street.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch33"
     id="ch33">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The mind of Europe was suddenly swayed and distorted by an
  avalanche of strange happenings. Once more the Imperial flag flew from the
  Royal residence in Berlin and Potsdam. A proclamation, studiously moderate in
  tone, almost democratic in its general outline, and without a single
  bombastic reference to the military powers by whose machinations his success
  had been achieved, had marvellously consolidated the young Emperor's
  position. Austria was reported to be on the point of begging for inclusion in
  the German Empire. Italy, with the grasp of the Socialists upon her throat,
  could only look on and wonder. France, with a deep groan, went at once into
  military conclave, counted her armies and found them insufficient, inspected
  her forts and found them vulnerable, but with the amazing and patient heroism
  of her race, set herself to face the inevitable. England, the most faithful
  subscriber to the Limitation of Armaments which Germany had so flagrantly
  disregarded, postponed the Peace Conference and sent out half a dozen
  commissions of ingenuous and credulous men to study conditions in the various
  countries which had subscribed to the League. America looked on from afar and
  tried not to feel the thrill of gratitude and superiority with which her
  great ocean barrier usually inspired the less far-seeing of her citizens.
  Russia itself, after twenty years of peace and content, felt the throb of
  political emotion&mdash;a new sensation of her giant body. She was bewildered
  at the strength of her own feelings. The more intelligent portion of the
  community looked with something like reverence upon that amazing rekindling
  of monarchical, almost religious sentiment on the part of the peasant class.
  Only a minority of them could remember rule under Tzardom; could remember the
  whispers of "a little father," a being nearer than God in their thoughts, as
  making a more tangible and real appeal to their imaginations. Samara's
  action, regarded with wondering admiration in other countries, almost stunned
  his own supporters. He dissolved the Duma as soon as he recognised the
  strength of the monarchist movement, and issued a proclamation in every
  electoral district requiring the people to nominate their representative on
  the question of the constitution of the country. He himself, immersed in the
  one scheme so near his heart, yet the scheme which had temporarily shaken his
  power, remained at Odensk and in the neighbourhood, patiently addressing
  audience after audience of his dissatisfied soldiery, trying to convince the
  most difficult race upon the earth, realising his slow progress, yet
  fascinated with his task and deaf to the pleadings of his advisers to seek a
  wider field. The acme of his quixotism, however, was yet to come.</p>

  <p>Catherine found herself living in an atmosphere of excitement from which
  she was to some extent excluded. Alexandrina, after Nicholas' visit, had
  never once alluded to its purpose. Nevertheless, Catherine felt the veil
  fall. She discussed the situation with no one, but she pondered over it. She
  compared the Russia of her dreams with the Russia which Samara had created;
  compared the man in his daily life and ideals as she now knew them with the
  narrow monarchical judgment which branded him simply as a usurper and a
  demagogue. Tzardom she had accepted very much as she had accepted the Bible.
  Both, it seemed to her, were fundamentals. The atheist was by the very fact
  of his existence a debased creature; the anarchist, vermin of a different
  race to human beings; the republican or anti-monarchist of any type, a person
  outside argument or consideration. Monarchy was God's system of government.
  Any other form was a species of blasphemy. It was really, after all, a
  somewhat clarified vision of the point of view once held by fifty million
  peasants. Samara, in the days of her earlier acquaintance with him, she had
  looked upon with a certain toleration, simply from the fact that she regarded
  him as one of the milestones on the way from the ruin of her country to its
  regeneration, to be passed ruthlessly enough when the whole light of sanity
  once more returned to the people. The ethics of his system of government she
  had never even considered. She had marvelled at its results, but all the time
  with the feeling that the same and better results would have been attained
  under monarchical rule. She had never even doubted that if the longed for day
  of re-establishment should come, she would marry Nicholas and reign over
  Russia. She scarcely doubted that even now, although for once their wills had
  crossed.</p>

  <p>Yet, in these days, she found herself comparing the two men. She found
  herself asking, in the spirit of a new-born heresy, whether Nicholas indeed
  possessed a single one of Samara's gifts, whether indeed it were possible for
  him, ruling by divine grace, to attain similar results to those which
  Samara's genius had achieved. In those days of disquiet after her few hours
  of daily work at Government Buildings, necessarily restricted, owing to
  Samara's absence, she took to walking the streets in the late afternoon, when
  twilight offered a sort of shelter&mdash;streets now as safe as the
  thoroughfares of any European capital of the world, thanks to the wonderful
  system of police. Nearly always her way led her past Government House. One
  evening, to her surprise, she found a crowd collected in the street&mdash;a
  patient crowd, watching the thin thread of light through the curtained
  windows of a room on the lower floor. She paused for a moment and listened,
  gathering from the whispers that Samara had returned. In front of the door
  stood a high-powered motor-car. She retreated a little from the throng and
  passed into a side street, unlocked a postern door in the wall with a key
  which she carried always with her, and made her way up the narrow strip of
  artificial garden to the back of the house. A manservant admitted her without
  question, and she hastened towards Samara's room on the ground-floor. Ivan
  stood on duty outside the door.</p>

  <p>"One may enter?" she inquired.</p>

  <p>Ivan shook his head.</p>

  <p>"General Trotsk is within," he replied, "and Minister Argoff. There is to
  be no interruption."</p>

  <p>Catherine fetched herself a chair and sat down. The conference was
  obviously of a disturbed nature. Often she heard Argoff's voice raised almost
  to passion, and more than once the cold anger which burned at the back of
  Trotsk's measured words filled them with unusual and ominous volume. Samara's
  voice, alone, seemed unchanged, but sometimes in his intonation she detected
  a sign of the strain from which he must be suffering. At last came
  silence&mdash;then the throwing open of the door. The Minister of Police and
  Argoff came out together. The former glanced steadily at Catherine, saluted,
  hesitated, and passed on. Ivan stood on one side and she crossed the
  threshold. As the door was closed behind her, she stopped short. Samara's
  head was buried in his hands. Instinctively she felt like an intruder, and
  hesitated, wondering whether she could withdraw unheard. Samara, however,
  with his amazing sensibility, seemed to be suddenly conscious of her
  presence. The flutter of her skirt, a waft of perfume from the bunch of dying
  violets she wore, or perhaps the sound of her quick indrawn breath, warned
  him of her coming. He looked up, rose an inch or two from his chair and
  nodded in friendly fashion.</p>

  <p>"The light tires my eyes," he said, as though in explanation of his
  posture. "How did you know that I was here?"</p>

  <p>"By the people outside, not from you," she replied a little
  reproachfully.</p>

  <p>"I nearly sent for you," he admitted, "just to indulge in the very
  weakness of sharing my woes."</p>

  <p>"The Peace Conference, I am told, is postponed," she said. "Why is Andrew
  not back from London?"</p>

  <p>The question seemed to perplex him.</p>

  <p>"I wish I knew," he admitted. "I cabled him to return. For ten days I have
  had no word from him. He is perhaps ill."</p>

  <p>"It is I who have robbed you of the one person who should have been by
  your side," she exclaimed remorsefully.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I am not sure whether Andrew would be any comfort to me if he were here,"
  he confided. "He behaved most strangely before he left, and he never
  sympathised with my demobilisation schemes. I rather fancy that he would go
  over to the great majority and side against me."</p>

  <p>He sat quite still for a moment, as though deliberating. Catherine,
  venturing to watch him more closely, was shocked at the change in his
  appearance. There were hollows underneath those always somewhat high cheek-
  bones. His mouth, in its straight, firm lines, seemed to have lost the
  possibility of any tenderness or humour. His eyes had surely receded a little
  and hardened. The wistful gleam of the visionary was still lurking in their
  depths, but the light of hope seemed to have grown weak.</p>

  <p>"This room is insufferable," he declared wearily. "I dare not open the
  windows because of the people. Come up to the top. I have a fancy to talk
  with you there."</p>

  <p>She followed him from the room by a door opening out of the alcove, along
  a narrow passage and into the self-adjusting lift, then up the final flights
  of stairs, on to the leaded parapets. From the recess to which he presently
  led her, the whole of the city westwards was visible, enclosed in an arc of
  lights, with a glimpse beyond of the great plain rolling and falling to an
  indefinable horizon. The new city was tangled with the old, high buildings
  and straight- hewn streets cleaving their way through the jumble of ancient
  tenements, decayed mansions, half palaces, half hovels, the churches with
  their strangely shaped roofs and towers, the gimcrack lodging-houses of
  Soviet erection. In the half-light one seemed to be able to visualise the
  eternal struggle between modernity and antiquity; the utilitarian triumphing,
  magnificent in victory, here and there an old street or square left only
  partially destroyed, lending a touch of beauty to the stern and intruding
  materialism of brick and iron. Samara laid his hand upon Catherine's sleeve,
  his other arm outflung to where the canopy of lights ended.</p>

  <p>"This has been my hardest task," he said, "and this has become the city I
  love. When they asked me to do what I could for Russia, there was scarcely a
  light to be seen from here, scarcely a sound building. The streets were full
  of holes and ruts, the sewers were open, no man or woman could walk safely
  for a hundred yards in any direction. There was scarcely a shop doing
  business, prices were ridiculous, people died of starvation in the street.
  And to-day, see! Even this below is only the birth of a great city, but it
  grows hour by hour. The stores are full, prices are normal. Look at that
  blaze of light westward. Those are factories working overtime on American
  contracts."</p>

  <p>"Russia will never forget what you have done for her," she assured him
  softly.</p>

  <p>"History may remind her in the future," he answered. "Your passer-by in
  the streets below to-night has forgotten. Strange things are happening hour
  by hour. Marshall Phildivia, Commander-in-Chief of the Russian armies,
  received instructions to report here to-day. He failed to do so. They tell me
  that after receiving the mandate he flew instead to Odensk. Trotsk, my one
  really strong man, has asked to-night for permission to resign his
  position."</p>

  <p>"I do not understand," she confessed. "Are you preparing to abdicate
  without even a fight."</p>

  <p>"A fight!" he repeated. "I have been fighting every minute of every day
  for the last three weeks. I shall fight to the end, but concerning one thing
  I have sworn an oath in heaven, and no one shall make me perjure myself.
  Enough blood has been shed in Russia. What there is left is best preserved. I
  shall resist monarchy with the last breath in my body, but not a single
  Russian soldier shall lose his life for or against me."</p>

  <p>"It is a wonderful decision," she murmured. "What about the First Army,
  then?"</p>

  <p>"It is because of the First Army that Trotsk deserts me," he replied. "I
  will not have them mobilised. I will not have them fight against their
  fellows. While I live, Russia shall not fight Russia."</p>

  <p>"But surely you need a certain measure of defence," she protested. "May I
  be quite frank?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally," he answered.</p>

  <p>"From what I can learn," she went on, "I think that your mission to Odensk
  has been more or less a failure. What you can demonstrate to a logician you
  cannot hammer into the head of a Russian peasant. I have read some of your
  speeches. They are wonderful. They have almost convinced me&mdash;a Royalist
  from the cradle. They are utterly wasted upon the men of the Second Army to
  whom you have addressed them."</p>

  <p>"I believe you are right," he admitted gloomily. "Yet, what does it
  matter? It is not the Second Army which will decide this problem. It is the
  whole electorate. Trotsk wants to mobilise the First Army and bring them
  across the river to the city. Why should I? The danger from Odensk is less
  than they have any idea of. Only you and I know that secret. But if it were
  greater, I would never see army against army. The people of Russia shall
  judge between what I have done and what Nicholas Imanoff may promise
  them."</p>

  <p>"You are a Quixote amongst rulers," she exclaimed. "The First Army is
  still yours, uncorrupted and patriotic. With their help you could hold your
  own against anything the others could do. Why do you hesitate? It is without
  doubt your best chance."</p>

  <p>"If it were my only one," he answered, "I should not change. The people
  shall decide."</p>

  <p>"There is something tragical about it all," she sighed. "You do not mind
  if I continue to speak frankly?"</p>

  <p>"Mind? Go on, please."</p>

  <p>"If it were left to the class you despise most&mdash;the
  <i>bourgeoisie</i>&mdash; there would be no doubt of the result. These are
  the people who read a little and think a little, who study foreign politics
  and realise the amazing change in their own country. You are sure of them.
  Their vote is yours to a man. It is the peasants whom you love&mdash;the
  peasants to whom you have spoken as a father to his children&mdash;who are
  the doubtful quantity. They are superstitious, at heart deeply religious, but
  very, very narrow; very prone to rely upon a passing feeling."</p>

  <p>"I know them," he admitted. "I must confess that they are the doubtful
  quantity. I am still content to leave the issue to their judgment."</p>

  <p>"So you have announced," Catherine said. "But has it ever struck you that
  it may not suit the other side to wait? The electorate is, after all,
  unreliable. If they believed it was in their power to seize Moscow without
  the possibility of any resistance, don't you think that they would do
  so?"</p>

  <p>"There is no chance of that," he answered. "You and I best know why."</p>

  <p>"Supposing the corps commanders should refuse to destroy the ammunition
  dumps?" she persisted.</p>

  <p>"They will not refuse," he assured her. "They are all my men. You must not
  imagine either that it will be a matter of hours. It will be a matter of
  seconds&mdash;the turning of a single prepared switch."</p>

  <p>"Supposing the Royalists should get to know of your plans and save the
  ammunition?"</p>

  <p>"It would have to be a very wonderful betrayal," he observed. "The secret
  is known to exactly three people in the world&mdash;yourself, myself, and
  Andrew. Problem&mdash;find the traitor!"</p>

  <p>"I am on the side of the Royalists," she reminded him. "It is absurdly
  rash of you to trust me with such a secret!"</p>

  <p>"You might fight," he answered, "if you were a man. You would never
  betray."</p>

  <p>For some reason unintelligible to either of them, they both relapsed into
  a curiously prolonged silence. Samara, a few feet back from the edge of the
  parapet, was leaning against a great block of masonry, his arms folded, his
  eyes fixed first upon the dark pall of clouds which had suddenly risen up on
  the horizon, but later on Catherine, whose face was a little turned from him.
  She stood on the extreme edge of the parapet, the upper part of her figure
  outlined against the black chasm of sky and space; a curiously effective
  background. She was like a pastel in real life, something fine in line and
  exquisite in conception, but amazingly human. She looked into the empty
  places, but without the air of a visionary. There were human thoughts which
  throbbed in her brain; human passions which stirred in her veins. Life, which
  since her departure from New York had moved so swiftly for her, seemed all
  the time to be piling up problems which even at that moment filled her
  mind&mdash;problems which she faced without a touch of neurotic disability,
  but with a simplicity and breadth of vision essentially racial. Even her
  smooth and beautiful forehead was unruffled as she studied the issues which
  had risen up before her. Samara, watching more and more intently, was
  puzzled. He remembered ever afterwards that in these, his hours of fate, the
  most strenuous effort of his mind was directed towards a wistful, intense
  desire to read the thoughts of one who certainly might have been counted
  outside the cycle of his fate.</p>

  <p>The breaking of the storm disturbed them. The whole of the black curtain
  of clouds seemed suddenly to open and disclose a background of fire. For a
  moment the light on her face appeared to him almost unearthly. Then she
  turned towards him with a very human little exclamation.</p>

  <p>"Come along down," she cried. "The rain will be here in a moment."</p>

  <p>The end of her words was lost in the crash of thunder which seemed to
  shake the building around them. She grasped his arm. He held her tightly and
  for a moment he did not move.</p>

  <p>"An allegory," he whispered. "I came to look out upon this city because
  its splendour is mine. I made it, brought it into being. All this is nothing
  to the meeting of the clouds. To-morrow the sun will shine down again on my
  work."</p>

  <p>Suddenly he felt the cling of her arms, the touch of her body against his.
  A spell of forgetfulness swept him off his feet as his lips were pressed to
  hers. There was a moment of deep, intense silence, then the blaze of light
  again all around them. She broke away, with a perfectly human, unembarrassed
  laugh, though underneath was a curious new undertone.</p>

  <p>"Another second," she warned him, "and all Moscow would have seen us.
  Perhaps they did, as it is. Come!"</p>

  <p>She ran with flying footsteps across the leads, down the iron ladder and
  along the passage. He was breathless when he rejoined her in the great
  wainscoted library. The telephone bell on his desk was ringing without
  intermission. She pointed to it silently. He took off the receiver, listened
  for a time, spoke again and hung it up. Then he turned to Catherine.</p>

  <p>"The Cabinet are holding a private session at Government Buildings," he
  explained. "They have heard that I am back from Odensk and they have done me
  the courtesy to desire my presence. I must go there at once. Except for
  Trotsk, Argoff assures me that they are perfectly sound."</p>

  <p>"Have they to seek election?" she inquired.</p>

  <p>"Only by the Duma," he answered. "They are in office until Parliament
  reassembles."</p>

  <p>"Are you coming back here afterwards?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"This must be good night," he told her. "I am addressing the officers at
  Odensk to-morrow morning, and I shall fly back as soon as the storm is over.
  Before I go, I want to ask you one question."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"What were you thinking of to-night when the thunder crashed down upon
  us?"</p>

  <p>She smiled reminiscently.</p>

  <p>"Of you," she admitted. "I will tell you what I was thinking. I was
  remembering first of all a saying of Voltaire's that 'Every great man in the
  world at some time or another makes one huge mistake.' Do you know what yours
  is?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"You have despised women. You have been too proud to share yourself, to
  live anywhere else except in the unalterable ego. You have classed women with
  flowers and wine and sunshine&mdash;a great mistake, Gabriel Samara!"</p>

  <p>"There are not many women like you," he said, after a moment's pause.</p>

  <p>"That is part of your folly," she insisted. "A woman is what her own love
  makes her, or the love of the man she loves. You know what yours would have
  made of any woman whom you had taken into your life? It would have made her
  practical, far-seeing. She would have supplied just that leaven of common-
  sense, of human outlook, which would have kept your feet on the ground. You
  have kept your head turned to the skies just one hour too long. The woman
  would have pointed across the plain. You could have had this, Gabriel Samara,
  and the wine, and the sunshine, and the flowers."</p>

  <p>He shook his head a little sadly.</p>

  <p>"You may be right," he confessed, "but if you are, salvation would still
  have been impossible for me."</p>

  <p>She smiled across at him delightfully.</p>

  <p>"I am too much of a woman to refuse the compliment," she murmured.</p>

  <p>At the door, he turned back. He pointed to the safe with its marvellous
  array of bars and cross-bars.</p>

  <p>"I have never asked you for an assurance before," he said, "but I ask you
  now&mdash;will you hold that secret for me for forty-eight hours?"</p>

  <p>"I promise," she answered readily.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch34"
     id="ch34">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Catherine, on her homeward way that night, paused at the
  corner of the Square, astounded. Streets and pavement alike were closely
  packed with a surging crowd, many of them, as she saw at once, students from
  the universities, but the great majority of the working class. They waited
  very patiently, almost in silence, always gazing at the upper windows of her
  aunt's house. Even whilst she lingered there for a moment the windows leading
  out on to the balcony were opened and Nicholas, not for the first time, she
  gathered, made his appearance. With a little catch of the breath, she noticed
  that he was wearing the old uniform of the Imperial Army. The people realised
  it, too, and there was a low, hoarse murmur of restrained applause. Nicholas
  stood at the salute. The applause swelled and grew, but only one or two
  amongst the crowd were venturesome enough to dare the spoken word.</p>

  <p>"Long live Nicholas Imanoff, Tzar of Russia!" some one cried shrilly from
  the centre of the throng.</p>

  <p>The applause increased still further to a roar. Catherine turned to one of
  the great policemen who was standing, placid, by her side.</p>

  <p>"Is this allowed?" she inquired.</p>

  <p>"All this is allowed, lady," was the respectful reply. "Save the
  anarchists, every one in the city has the right of free speech. An edict
  confirming this has just been issued from the Home Office, signed by Samara
  himself."</p>

  <p>"Do you think I could get to my home?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Where is it that you wish to go?"</p>

  <p>"To the house where Nicholas Imanoff is standing upon the balcony."</p>

  <p>"You are a member of the household?"</p>

  <p>"I am his cousin, Catherine Zygoff of Urulsk."</p>

  <p>"In that case, gracious lady," the policeman assured her, "a way shall be
  made."</p>

  <p>He held his baton above his head and shouted in strident Russian at the
  top of his voice:</p>

  <p>"Way for the Princess Catherine Zygoff of Urulsk, who seeks to return to
  the house of the Grand Duchess. Give way for the gracious Princess! Give way,
  you loiterers!"</p>

  <p>The spirit of orderliness was in the crowd, perhaps because it was so
  seldom questioned. A lane was made for Catherine at once. People in the
  background stood on tiptoe to see her. From the heart of the assembly came
  the same shrill voice:</p>

  <p>"Way for the Princess Catherine Zygoff of Urulsk, cousin of Nicholas
  Imanoff, future Tzarina of Russia."</p>

  <p>There was a moment's breathless pause. Liberty of speech was a new gift to
  Russia, and something of the old dread lingered. In a few seconds, however,
  hesitation vanished. Catherine regained her roof through an avenue of wildly
  applauding, hat-waving youths. She passed into the house without a sign. At
  the top of the stairs Nicholas met her, his face flushed.</p>

  <p>"Come and stand by my side, Catherine," he invited. "The people demand it.
  It is our betrothal."</p>

  <p>"Do not be absurd," she answered scornfully. "What are these but a few
  handfuls of sightseers, out for any sensation they can get hold of. There are
  just as many yelling themselves hoarse at Samara's gates. One loses dignity
  in accepting such tribute."</p>

  <p>The young man's eyes flashed anger.</p>

  <p>"It is from the small beginnings that the great things come," he cried.
  "These people have sought me out of their own will. You have not heard. We
  bring news from Odensk. There have been demonstrations at Petrograd. The
  country is with us!"</p>

  <p>"It will be quite time enough for us to accept the homage of the people,"
  Catherine insisted, "when the elections have convinced us that it is the
  people's will that we should be restored to our proper places."</p>

  <p>"You talk like Samara himself," he sneered. "Have you no Russian blood in
  your veins?"</p>

  <p>"Catherine!"</p>

  <p>The suddenness of the interruption startled her into momentary silence.
  Alexandrina had pushed her way past Nicholas and stood below him upon the
  stairs. She was like a woman transformed. The disabilities of her figure
  seemed to have vanished. It was the voice of a great lady who spoke.</p>

  <p>"You have forgotten what is due to your cousin and to your destiny,
  Catherine," she said. "These are the first of the millions who will claim
  you. Do not hesitate for another moment. Let these people see you standing by
  Nicholas' side. All Russia will hear of it and know."</p>

  <p>Catherine was torn with a terrible indetermination. Nicholas made room for
  her to pass and followed her as she slowly ascended the stairs. She was in a
  state of furious revolt, but she had somehow the feeling that she was obeying
  an immutable law. They entered the <i>salon</i> and moved towards the wide-
  flung window.</p>

  <p>"This is no small matter, Catherine," Nicholas exclaimed eagerly. "We
  bring wonderful news. People are flocking here from all parts of the city.
  There are students there, too&mdash;the class we want. Smile at them and at
  me, Catherine. This is the beginning of the greater days."</p>

  <p>She took her place beside him on the balcony and looked downwards into the
  upturned faces. Once more hats were waved; a roar of voices seemed to come to
  her from an indefinite space. She felt her hand grasped by Nicholas, and the
  volume of applause increased. Her fingers were limp and passive and cold. She
  seemed to remember that earlier in the evening she had stood in a windier
  paradise and on a greater height.</p>

  <p>Dinner that night at Alexandria's flat was a disturbed and tumultuous
  meal. Nicholas was full of his personal triumphs at Odensk. Even though he
  had been compelled to appear there as a civilian, the common soldiers had
  broken all rules of discipline and saluted him. The meetings which Kirdorff
  had arranged had been packed, the enthusiasm enormous. The excitement seemed
  somehow to have benefited Nicholas, to have raised for a few moments his feet
  from the ground. He was vainglorious, but confident.</p>

  <p>"I have promised the people," he announced, "a government which shall give
  them as much liberty as the present one&mdash;liberty of speech and liberty
  of religion. I have promised them to alter nothing which is for their good.
  In return, they will know that they are being governed, not by a usurper, but
  by divine and moral right."</p>

  <p>"You are becoming amazingly eloquent, dear cousin," Catherine murmured.
  "To tell you the truth," she went on, "your eagerness for my presence
  to-night astonished me. I had fancied, from our last parting, that I was
  written out of your scheme of things."</p>

  <p>"That could not be," Nicholas replied solemnly. "It could not be in the
  first place because our alliance is the one thing necessary to make our
  position sure in the face of the Russian people. You and I represent all that
  is left of our great House."</p>

  <p>"The union," Alexandrina declared, "has been blessed in heaven and
  sanctioned by the Head of our Church. It is one of the great and happy
  features of the new day."</p>

  <p>"As for our last parting," Nicholas concluded, "I remember very well my
  anger. That, however, is finished. We ask no further service of you,
  Catherine. To-night we start afresh."</p>

  <p>Catherine looked at him reflectively. A vague sense of trouble was
  gathering in her mind. To cross-question him further at present, however, was
  impossible. They had finished dinner now and moved into the small
  <i>salon,</i> where all the time a little stream of callers presented
  themselves and, having paid their respects, passed on to make room for
  others. Nicholas accepted the homage paid him readily and with dignity.
  Catherine was gracious but noncommittal.</p>

  <p>"We move too fast," she insisted more than once. "Later, perhaps."</p>

  <p>She sought her opportunity for speech with her cousin. Towards the end of
  the evening it came.</p>

  <p>"Nicholas," she said, "I must ask you what you meant when you assured me
  that you would cease your attempts to persuade me to betray Samara's
  confidence? You know that I have in my keeping a secret. When you left the
  house that evening you were very angry because I refused to divulge it."</p>

  <p>He smiled at her in condescending fashion.</p>

  <p>"Put the matter behind you, my dear Catherine," he begged. "It is
  finished. The world itself is opening before us. All that we seek to learn we
  shall learn and that without delay."</p>

  <p>He moved away to greet some fresh arrivals. The cloud of uneasiness in
  Catherine's mind increased. She was seized with a very definite and
  persistent apprehension. As soon as it was possible she slipped unnoticed
  from the room and made her way to her own apartment.</p>

  <p>There were still people in the Square when, at a few minutes after
  midnight, Catherine left the house by the back entrance and turned towards
  Government House. She had changed her gown for a plain walking costume of
  dark material, and she wore a small hat with a thick veil. There was
  something hard and comforting in her pocket and the thrill of adventure in
  her pulses. The back streets through which she passed were almost deserted,
  but in the broader thoroughfares the lights were still flaming and people
  were promenading in such numbers that the tread of their feet sounded like
  the march of a distant army. Samara's boast, however, that the streets of
  Moscow were now as safe as the streets of New York and London, was justified
  in her person that night. Except for a few good-humoured greetings she passed
  on her way unnoticed until she reached the side entrance to Government House.
  She entered by the postern door, closed it behind her noiselessly, and stood
  for a moment peering into the shadows of the courtyard. There was no one
  stirring, no sound of following footsteps from the street outside. Yet, for
  the first time, Catherine was unaccountably nervous. She moved forward
  reluctantly. She paused at every other step to listen. There were two tall
  elm trees on her left through which the wind seemed to rush with a sort of
  shuddering sigh, sending pattering down upon her drops of rain from the
  recent storm. The house itself presented a great white blank, the blinds
  drawn and the shutters tightly fastened. She approached nearer and nearer to
  it, climbed the steps and stopped once more to listen. The silence was still
  unbroken, save for the dull reverberation of those ceaseless footsteps in the
  distance, the sharp honk of a motor-horn on the boulevard, an occasional
  murmur of voices. She entered the house, shut the door behind her, groped her
  way for a few steps into the gulf of darkness, and found the switch. The
  great hall was flooded at once with light&mdash;an instantaneous though
  unaccountable relief to her. She passed on and opened the door of the
  anteroom, itself furnished as a library, at the further end of which lay the
  entrance to the room she sought. One light only was burning here from the
  ceiling; so inadequate an illumination of the lofty chamber that she could
  scarcely see across it. By degrees, as her eyes became accustomed to the
  gloom, she could dimly discern the great table round which the counsellors
  had been used to sit, the plain wood panels reaching to the ceiling, with
  here and there fragments of the ancient tapestry, and, most reassuring sight
  of all, at the end of the room, seated on guard before the closed door of his
  master's private apartment, Ivan. She recognised him with a throb of relief
  and moved at once towards him.</p>

  <p>"Ivan!" she cried.</p>

  <p>He took no notice. He was bending a little forward, motionless and
  apparently asleep.</p>

  <p>"Ivan!" she called again.</p>

  <p>Still he did not reply. She stretched out her hand and gripped him by the
  shoulder. Her fingers fell upon something hard, and as she leaned over him
  she saw the horror in his distorted face. Her lips parted. It was the effort
  of her life to keep back the shriek which rose to her lips. In Ivan's back
  was a dagger. There were some faint drops of blood upon his coat. His face
  was the face of a dead man, and from underneath the chink of the door in
  front of her she could distinguish a pale shaft of light.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch35"
     id="ch35">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The first shivering moments of panic were past and Catherine
  was comparatively calm, almost collected. In her right hand she held the
  small revolver which Samara had given her on the steamer; with her left she
  turned the handle of the door and entered the room. She entered so softly
  that the man busied with the safe, his back turned towards her, proceeded
  with his task undisturbed. She drew a little nearer. Then surprise forced
  from her the exclamation which terror had failed to wring from her lips.</p>

  <p>"Andrew!" she cried. "Andrew Kroupki!"</p>

  <p>He turned round quite slowly; stiffly, as though it were against his will.
  The change in him was so startling that she almost wondered that she had
  recognised him. His face had grown lanker and thinner than ever, his mouth
  seemed to have taken to itself the character of a wolf's, his sunken eyes
  seemed at once to have lost expression and yet gained in brilliancy. With a
  little thrill of horror she saw the scar upon his cheek. He drew himself
  gradually upright.</p>

  <p>"Catherine Borans!" he muttered. "What do you want?"</p>

  <p>"When did you come back from England?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I did not go to England," he answered. "Samara thought that I was there.
  He was wrong. I went to Odensk."</p>

  <p>"Odensk!" she repeated incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Yes. You haven't heard, then? But how would you? I swore them to secrecy.
  I have betrayed Samara. I am selling his secrets to your friends, the
  Royalists&mdash;selling them day by day. They tell me you have some foolish
  scruples. So they sent me here for the great one. Scruples! I have none, but
  I thank the Father of Russia that you came to-night."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>He struck himself on the side of the head. He had the appearance of a
  madman.</p>

  <p>"Because my mind is going," he groaned. "My memory is failing. I
  remembered the hiding-place of the key. I remembered the adjustment of the
  bars- -four panels to the left, three to the right, two back&mdash;I
  remembered it all as well as ever&mdash;the combinations for Monday, Tuesday,
  Wednesday and Thursday&mdash;I know them by heart. To-day is Friday, and I
  have forgotten. Here I stand, with those proclamations only a few inches off,
  the secret orders I have promised there within my grasp&mdash;and I have
  forgotten. It is well you came. Tell it me quickly. The password for Friday?
  My head is hot with the emptiness of it. Quick!"</p>

  <p>"To whom are those secret orders going when you have them?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"To your friends, the enemies of Samara. Quick!"</p>

  <p>She made no movement.</p>

  <p>"What has Gabriel Samara done to you," she demanded, "that you should
  betray him like this?"</p>

  <p>"Robbed me," he shouted fiercely. "Robbed me of you!"</p>

  <p>"You poor fool!" she scoffed. "Do you know who I am?"</p>

  <p>"Catherine Borans," he answered. "The Chief brought you from New York. But
  they tell me that you are a Russian&mdash;a Monarchist. Well, I am a
  Monarchist, too. Damn Samara!"</p>

  <p>"They might have told you the truth," she said. "It really doesn't matter.
  I am the Princess Catherine Zygoff of Urulsk, betrothed&mdash;if I carry out
  my contract&mdash;to Nicholas of Russia, whom you say you serve."</p>

  <p>He glared at her, speechless, for several moments.</p>

  <p>"Now I know that I am mad," he muttered at last. "A Princess of the Royal
  House! You were in the Weltmore Typewriting Agency!"</p>

  <p>"Quite true," she admitted. "So was Nicholas, selling bonds on commission.
  Kirdorff was secretary to a foreigners' club. My aunt, the Grand Duchess,
  designed artificial flowers. It is none the less true that we are what we
  are."</p>

  <p>He sank into Samara's chair. For a few moments he seemed to have forgotten
  his mission.</p>

  <p>"Did Samara know?" he gasped.</p>

  <p>"He knew at Monte Carlo," she answered. "General von Hartsen told
  him."</p>

  <p>He sat at the table perfectly limp. Something in his attitude reminded her
  with a little thrill of renewed horror of the man outside.</p>

  <p>"Now that you know who I am," she continued quietly, "you know that I have
  a right to speak on the matter of those papers. You and I are the only two
  whom Samara has trusted. Royalist though I am, I have no mind to betray him.
  Neither shall you. Close up the safe, Andrew Kroupki. Go home and ask your
  God to pardon you for the terrible thing you have done to-night, and the
  terrible purpose that was in your mind."</p>

  <p>He stiffened slightly in his place. Something from which she shrank came
  into his expression.</p>

  <p>"I have finished with Samara," he announced. "He is only a woman. He has
  not the courage to fight for the people. He is a coward."</p>

  <p>"Samara is a great man and you are a liar," she answered.</p>

  <p>The fury was back in his face.</p>

  <p>"It was always true what I feared," he went on. "You love him. You cannot
  deny it. In your heart&mdash;even though Nicholas takes you to his
  throne&mdash;you are Samara's woman."</p>

  <p>"You are becoming a little absurd," she said quietly, struggling against
  what seemed to be a shortness of breath. "Do as I directed. Leave this room
  and go home."</p>

  <p>He rose from his chair and began moving slowly round the table which
  separated them.</p>

  <p>"No," he decided. "I shall not do that. I shall fulfil the purpose for
  which I came. Tell me the password, Catherine Borans."</p>

  <p>"I shall never tell it to you," she retorted.</p>

  <p>He was clear of the table now, within a dozen yards of her.</p>

  <p>"You shall tell me the password," he insisted, his voice rising, "and you
  shall do other things that I bid you. I have lost my soul since I bore the
  shame of a woman's blow. There is a little left in life and I will take it.
  First tell me the password."</p>

  <p>Her hand came from the folds of her dress. The feeble light shone on the
  bright metal of the revolver she held out.</p>

  <p>"I shall tell you nothing," she warned him, "and I will not have you a
  step nearer."</p>

  <p>He laughed.</p>

  <p>"Those who are sold to the devil," he cried, "have no fear of hell!"</p>

  <p>She would have aimed at his mouth, but a chance word of advice of
  Samara's, never to aim too high, came into her mind. She dropped her arm a
  few inches and fired. Within the four walls of the room the report seemed to
  her tremendous&mdash;almost deafening. He came on another couple of inches,
  undeterred. Her finger was upon the trigger again, when he suddenly faltered
  and spun round. He clutched at the air, grasping as though for something to
  seize hold of, and fell a crumpled heap upon the floor. Catherine stood for a
  moment looking at him. She watched the slight colour drain from his cheeks,
  saw the little hole just underneath his shoulder from which a dark spot of
  blood was oozing. She felt no pity for him; only a great and wonderful
  relief. If by chance she had missed! The thought was paralysing in its
  horror! She retraced her steps for a minute to the door and stood listening.
  The domestic part of the establishment was some distance away and no one
  apparently had been disturbed by the report of her revolver. Ivan was still
  there, terrible in his limp inertness. Again she retraced her steps, laid her
  revolver down upon the table and began the task of securing the intricate
  fastenings. Once she paused and listened. She fancied that there had been
  some movement in the room. There was nothing to be heard, however, except the
  muffled and distant sounds from the street. The safe itself was a miracle of
  ingenuity, the work of one of Russia's foremost engineers, and familiar
  though she was with its mechanism, it still absorbed her whole attention. Her
  task was approaching completion. There was only one more bar to coax into its
  place. Then the horror came again. She felt her heart almost cease to beat.
  There was a hot breath upon her cheek. She turned around fearfully, and this
  time she shrieked as one who looks into hell. It was Andrew's face, white and
  drawn with pain and passion&mdash;Andrew, who had dragged himself to his feet
  and found strength in his madness.</p>

  <p>"Nothing but a flesh wound," he muttered. "I'll have the password from
  you, and then&mdash;the password first. Tell it to me!"</p>

  <p>She struck at him with all her force, and for a moment it seemed as though
  her blow had gone home, for he reeled upon his feet and his new-found
  strength appeared to have left him. With a fierce effort, however, he
  recovered himself. His fingers were upon her throat. His knee pinned her to
  the safe door.</p>

  <p>"The password! The password first!"</p>

  <p>She put forth all the strength of her youth and supple limbs, and suddenly
  realised that it was hopeless. His fingers were like burning pincers; his arm
  like a band of iron. Already the room seemed to be going round, the light
  must have been extinguished. Then there was another sound&mdash;a roar at
  first, a whisper, a roar again. Where had she heard it before, she wondered
  with the last efforts of her ebbing consciousness? The steamer! Samara with
  the would-be assassin in his grasp! The body hurtling through the air! Then
  she opened her eyes and tried to smile. She was filled with an ineffable
  sense of relief. The arms which were holding her so firmly and yet so
  tenderly were Samara's.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch36"
     id="ch36">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There followed days during which Moscow scarcely knew
  itself; days of excitement and processions, rumours and counter-rumours,
  meetings in every public hall, at every street corner; telegrams and wireless
  messages in the plate-glass windows and in nearly every one of the great
  shops. Curiously enough, all the time business went on almost as usual. The
  restaurants and caf&eacute;s were packed with surging crowds, who thronged
  the boulevards at night singing patriotic songs. Sometimes the crowds were
  thickest outside Government House, sometimes outside Alexandrina's modest
  abode. Everywhere people were asking themselves what it all meant. Was it a
  military rising of the Royalists? If so, why was Nicholas Imanoff, in
  civilian clothes, to be seen day by day on the balcony of his aunt's house,
  alighting at the aerodrome on hurried visits from Odensk, driving in an
  automobile through the streets?</p>

  <p>Then Samara addressed two great meetings, one at the Skating Rink, and
  another at the Opera House, and on the following morning the city awoke to
  find a proclamation signed by him on every wall. At last they began to
  understand. It was theirs to make the choice; the restoration of the monarchy
  under Nicholas Imanoff, or the continuation of the republic under Samara and
  his council. The people should decide, Samara promised with persistent
  passion. No portion of the army should be used even to defend the city
  against any possible military coup. No blow should be struck, no blood be
  shed. Samara's invocation to the Russian people was:</p>

  <p align="center"><b>CHOOSE WHO SHALL GOVERN YOU.</b></p>

  <p>As the days passed on, Catherine became conscious of a sense of growing
  excitement in her aunt's disturbed household. Kirdorff, Orenburg and most of
  the younger men of the party were now absent. Finally Nicholas himself
  departed. The air was filled with rumours. It was the quiet before the storm.
  In two days the initial electioneering results would be proclaimed.
  Catherine, who for the first time in anybody's recollection had been confined
  to her room with a bad throat, came down late one afternoon, with a red rose
  in her waistband, and a great bundle of papers under her arm. She passed
  smiling amongst the little groups of her aunt's visitors. She wore an unusual
  band of velvet around her neck, but seemed otherwise very much as usual. Only
  the immediate members of the household who had not retired on the night when
  she had been brought home by Samara's physician in his own car had any idea
  that she had been suffering from anything but an ordinary indisposition.</p>

  <p>"So, after all," she remarked, "this great Samara will keep his word. It
  seems too amazing to think of a change like this without a gun being fired or
  a blow struck."</p>

  <p>An octogenarian baron, once the owner of vast estates in Southern Russia,
  and now a pensioner at Monaco, took snuff and grunted.</p>

  <p>"You forget, Princess," he reminded her, "there may be no change at all.
  Samara may prove to have been too clever for us. If I had been Kirdorff and
  the others, I would have let Samara talk of peace and then asked him to look
  down the barrels of a hundred thousand rifles from Odensk."</p>

  <p>"The Baron is right," a woman from the other end of the room declared
  eagerly. "The whole of the army at Odensk is almost in a state of mutiny at
  the idea of demobilisation. Nicholas has made no compact with Samara. He
  could march into Moscow at the head of a quarter of a million of soldiers in
  two days, and the victory would be won."</p>

  <p>The Grand Duchess smiled. She looked across at Catherine and smiled
  again.</p>

  <p>"One never knows," she murmured.</p>

  <p>But Nicholas had not the chance of marching into Moscow at the head of
  even a hundred thousand soldiers. He arrived, instead, very sulky and wet,
  about half-past eleven that night, soon after the last of the guests had
  departed. His anger blazed up at the sight of Catherine.</p>

  <p>"It is you whom we have to thank for this failure," he exclaimed
  furiously. "You and that lunatic, Andrew Kroupki, who seems to have tumbled
  off the edge of the earth."</p>

  <p>"What has happened?" his aunt cried. "All day long we have been listening
  for the rumbling of the trains and the sound of your guns."</p>

  <p>"Guns!" he scoffed. "Samara's secret was simple enough. It has paralysed
  the entire army. Yesterday the whole of the ammunition within five hundred
  miles of us was destroyed, and the men's bayonets seized. There is an army
  still, it is true&mdash;armed with walking-sticks!"</p>

  <p>"Samara has at least been consistent," Catherine pointed out. "He fights
  harder to avoid bloodshed than for his own cause. Do you realise that, if he
  chose to, he could bring the First Army into the city, fully armed and
  equipped?"</p>

  <p>Nicholas sprawled in an easy-chair and drank brandy.</p>

  <p>"How could he?" he asked cynically. "After his declaration of pacifism? We
  could show fight&mdash;not he."</p>

  <p>"My opinion of you and your counsellors is that you are a brainless lot,"
  she retorted. "You have lost a magnificent opportunity of impressing Moscow
  and the whole world."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Simply this. You say that practically the whole of the Second Army are on
  your side."</p>

  <p>"Except for a percentage of the officers, they are."</p>

  <p>"You have your hundred trains waiting and your commissariat," she
  continued. "Why don't you bring your soldiers up unarmed? You can issue a
  proclamation and say that, agreeing with Samara in his great desire that not
  a single life should be lost, you are content to show by peaceful
  illustration the will of the army."</p>

  <p>Nicholas looked across at her for a moment blankly and afterwards in
  almost fervent admiration. Then he rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to the telephone," he declared. "You are a genius,
  Catherine!"</p>

  <p>Catherine herself waited until the small hours of the morning. Then she
  stole downstairs to the room on the ground floor where the telephone was, and
  asked for that secret number which only she and a few others knew. Almost
  immediately Samara answered her.</p>

  <p>"You should be in bed," she told him severely.</p>

  <p>"One does not sleep these days," he answered. "You are better?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," she assured him. "What about Andrew?" she added after a
  moment's hesitation.</p>

  <p>"He died in hospital this morning," was the cool reply. "I only wish that
  he had died in New York twelve months ago."</p>

  <p>"I have news for you," Catherine confided.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"The Second Army are going to march on Moscow just the same, but as
  pacifists. They are coming to protest against being demobilised and to shout
  themselves hoarse for Nicholas. My idea entirely."</p>

  <p>"A very excellent one," Samara admitted after a moment's pause, "but I'll
  counteract it. Some busybody has mobilised the First Army against my orders.
  I'll disarm them and bring them also."</p>

  <p>"I gather that Moscow will be becoming lively during the next few days,"
  she remarked. "How do you think things are going?"</p>

  <p>"In the direction of change," he answered a little sadly. "It is always
  like that. The pendulum of political impulses will never cease to swing. Are
  you to be crowned in Moscow?"</p>

  <p>"It has been suggested," she assented. "Shall I send you a card?"</p>

  <p>"I shall escape from your magnificence," he declared. "There is that
  little villa down in the South of France which I showed you on our way back
  from America. I fixed upon it then as my ultimate retreat. I scarcely
  thought, though, that it would be so soon."</p>

  <p>"Nothing is settled yet," she reminded him. "You may win at the polls. If
  you do, there is only one way to avoid trouble in the future. Send Nicholas
  back to New York to sell bonds and my aunt with him to make her artificial
  roses."</p>

  <p>"And you?"</p>

  <p>"Back to the Weltmore Typewriting Agency. I am sure they'd take me. It was
  such a good advertisement for them when I left New York with you."</p>

  <p>"Are you by any chance being flippant?" he asked drily.</p>

  <p>"No, I'm just sleepy," she confided. "Good night!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch37"
     id="ch37">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Two days later a new sensation presented itself to the
  already distracted inhabitants of Moscow. Soon after dawn, from every railway
  terminus and even along some of the main thoroughfares outside, columns of
  soldiers in the blue- grey uniform came creeping into the city. By noon it
  was estimated that there were nearly a hundred thousand from the Second Army
  alone encamped in the streets and squares. To add to the bewilderment of the
  people, from northwards came a steady stream of soldiers from the First Army,
  also unarmed. The streets were hung with a proclamation:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>A portion of the Second Army will arrive in Moscow to-day to protest
    against demobilisation. Anxious in every way to show my accord with the
    desire of your President to avoid bloodshed, the troops, at my advice, will
    come unarmed.</i><br>
    <br>
    (Signed) NICHOLAS.
  </blockquote>

  <p>Samara showed his first signs of anger when a copy of this proclamation
  was brought to him. He tore it promptly in two and flung the pieces across
  the table.</p>

  <p>"It is untrue," he told the little conclave of ministers who were with him
  in almost hourly consultation. "If a woman had not been faithful, Nicholas
  would have made a shambles of the city. As it is, under whose orders do these
  troops march? Where is General Denkers?"</p>

  <p>It was a Cabinet Meeting but there were many vacancies down the long
  table. Argoff leaned forward in his place.</p>

  <p>"The General telephoned half an hour ago to say that he would call at
  Government House on his way into the city," he announced.</p>

  <p>"If he is here, admit him," Samara directed shortly.</p>

  <p>Argoff left the Council Chamber and returned a few moments later ushering
  in the Commander-in-Chief of the Second Army&mdash;General Denkers. The
  latter saluted gravely and stood with his hands resting lightly on the back
  of the chair to which Samara pointed.</p>

  <p>"By whose orders, General, have you brought these troops to Moscow?"
  Samara demanded.</p>

  <p>"I have to report, sir," was the momentous reply, "that, in common with a
  large majority of the officers under my command, I, two nights ago, took the
  oath of allegiance to Nicholas Imanoff, future Tzar of Russia."</p>

  <p>"Are you not anticipating a little, General?" Samara inquired
  imperturbably. "It is true that I have issued a proclamation that the
  constitution of this country shall be according to the desire of the people.
  The people as yet have not spoken."</p>

  <p>"Sir," the General answered, "the army has spoken."</p>

  <p>Samara smiled with faint sarcasm.</p>

  <p>"And, but for an unexpected shortage of ammunition," he remarked, "I
  imagine that the army would have spoken in a different tongue. It is perhaps
  fortunate that my agents advised me of your probable attitude."</p>

  <p>The General remained silent. He had been a soldier of Samara's own
  choosing, a fine disciplinarian, a strong, conscientious man. It was very
  certain that if he had declared for the Tzar, it was because he had believed
  in Tzardom.</p>

  <p>"Supposing I order the First Army to march upon the city?" Samara
  suggested. "They are perfectly armed, accoutred, and loyal to the
  Republic."</p>

  <p>"Such a step would be contrary to your own proclamation, sir," General
  Denkers rejoined quickly. "You have announced your earnest desire to have the
  future of this country decided upon without the shedding of blood."</p>

  <p>"I wonder," Samara asked, looking at him steadily, "whether you would have
  respected my appeal if the bombs had been there for your aeroplanes, the
  cartridges for your rifles and machine-guns, and the ammunition for your
  heavy artillery?"</p>

  <p>The General made no reply. His silence was in itself a confession.</p>

  <p>"You are dismissed, General," Samara concluded. "In the name of the State,
  I charge you to issue orders to your officers that all property be respected
  and that any acts of insubordination are immediately punished."</p>

  <p>"We shall use our most strenuous efforts in that direction, sir," were the
  General's final words.</p>

  <p>Samara looked down the table. There were eight ministers present; five
  others, including Trotsk, already deserters.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," he announced, "the Government of this country is in suspense.
  Until the new Duma is elected and meets, constitutionally we are impotent.
  Such measures as must be taken for the good of the country can be left to my
  associates, Weirtz and Argoff, together with myself. You are dismissed."</p>

  <p>The Minister of Finance rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Sir," he said, "we are passing through one of the strangest upheavals of
  history. It may be that we shall none of us meet again in this chamber as
  officials of the Russian Government. Before we part, let me say on my own
  account, at least, that if we and the rest of the country should yield to the
  popular desire for a change of constitution, there will still be not one of
  us who will not think of you, Mr. President, with the deepest gratitude and
  respect. You have been a great ruler of this country in troublous times and a
  patriot in this hour of adversity, as these days of bloodlessness prove. I
  claim the privilege of shaking hands with you, sir, even though I venture to
  tell you that if the people's call for a monarchy is, as seems at present,
  unanimous, I shall tender my services to Nicholas Imanoff."</p>

  <p>There was a chorus of assent. Samara shook hands with every one. They
  filed out a little reluctantly. At the very last moment one of the official
  secretaries rushed in with a telephonic despatch.</p>

  <p>Samara read it through.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," he announced, raising his voice a little so that every one
  might hear, "the result of the elections in twenty-three districts is
  herewith proclaimed. Twenty-one have voted for the representative pledged to
  the restoration of the monarchy."</p>

  <p>A murmur of amazement, almost of consternation, was clearly audible.
  Nothing so sweeping as this had been expected. Argoff and Weirtz would have
  lingered with their Chief, but Samara waved them away.</p>

  <p>"It is useless," he said, "to discuss affairs of State. You will find me
  here if I am wanted."</p>

  <p>He retired into his inner chamber&mdash;the faithful Ivan no longer there
  to guard the door&mdash;telephoned to the servants outside, denying himself
  to all callers, and spent several hours looking through his private papers.
  Once a privileged servant came silently in with the samovar upon a silver
  tray. He waved him away.</p>

  <p>"A bottle of brandy," he ordered.</p>

  <p>He helped himself liberally, refilled his glass and sent over to
  Government Buildings for one or two minor officials with whom he completed
  some unfinished business. Later on, a messenger from the Home Office
  presented himself with another list of election results. The young man handed
  him the sheet almost apologetically, and Samara read it with genuine
  astonishment. The returns were now in for over half the seats in the Duma,
  and out of a hundred and thirty districts, a hundred and seven had voted for
  the monarchist representative.</p>

  <p>"What does it mean, Paul Metzger?" Samara asked curiously. "Where did it
  all come from, all this fever for a monarch? Why was there no evidence of it
  before?"</p>

  <p>"There isn't a man in Russia who isn't asking himself the same question,
  sir," the young official declared.</p>

  <p>"In the caf&eacute;s, on the streets, and in the clubs, there is nothing
  but sheer amazement. All that the most clear-sighted can say is that it is
  the swing of the pendulum. The army started it, of course, but why the
  country districts should all be on fire to see the monarchy back again is
  inexplicable."</p>

  <p>"I wonder whether Bromley Pride is still in Moscow?" Samara ruminated.</p>

  <p>"He is one of about a hundred waiting in the anteroom, sir," Metzger
  replied.</p>

  <p>"I will see him," Samara announced. "Send the others away."</p>

  <p>Pride came lumbering in, as breezy and cheerful as ever. He was too much a
  man of the world to pull a long face and offer sympathy.</p>

  <p>"You've earned immortality, Mr. President," he said, as he shook hands.
  "I'm just from Berlin. I was at the start of things there. I've seen half-a-
  dozen South American republics come and go, although perhaps they don't count
  any. I'm supposed to be an authority upon revolutions and changes of
  constitution in a country, but I want to tell you this is the most astounding
  business I ever knew. No one could conceive of such a thing. There are a
  hundred thousand unarmed soldiers in the city, hobnobbing with a hundred
  thousand civilians; there are gala dinners at all the swagger restaurants,
  you can't get within a dozen yards of a table at any of the ordinary
  caf&eacute;s, and I haven't heard an angry word or seen a blow struck. I was
  out early this morning. There the crowds were, as patient as you please,
  waiting for the election returns. I met dozens of people I knew slightly and
  I asked them all the same question. 'Which is it going to be?' I got the same
  answer right away from every one of them. 'The elections are to decide,' they
  said. And I tell you this, Samara," the journalist concluded impressively,
  "if the country had voted the other way, they'd have taken it all right. Talk
  about a bloodless revolution! I never believed in such a thing before. I
  didn't think human nature could stand the strain."</p>

  <p>Samara pushed over the bottle of brandy and lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Pride," he said, "you are one of the few men in the world whose judgment
  I would believe in as soon as my own. You are there amongst the people, and
  you see the truth. What does it all mean? I have governed these people for
  fifteen years. No country in the history of the world has prospered as Russia
  has under my rule. Yet along comes this young scion of the Imanoffs, whom I
  found selling bonds in New York, shows himself to the people, makes use of a
  little propaganda in the army, and behold he seems suddenly to have become a
  god. You have seen the voting?"</p>

  <p>Pride nodded.</p>

  <p>"When you've learned not to care, Samara," he said, "you'll understand it
  better. This is at the root of the whole thing. The commonest evil quality in
  all human nature is ingratitude. It isn't a conscious evil quality. It's the
  philosophical evolution of the profound egotism of human nature. The whole
  country's prosperous and happy and cheerful. The people don't stop to realise
  that it's your administration which has brought that about. They honestly
  believe that they have done it all themselves. You've had the privilege of
  being at the head of the government. They don't grudge it to you. They have
  no ill-will towards you. They're simply dazzled by the prospect of a more
  picturesque form of government. It never enters into their heads for a moment
  that the present prosperity might not continue. They have accepted it as a
  matter of course. They think it will continue as a matter of course. That's
  as near as I or any one else can get at an explanation of what is going on
  to-day. It has nothing to do with you. You made just one mistake, and only
  one."</p>

  <p>"Demobilisation," Samara murmured.</p>

  <p>Pride signified his assent.</p>

  <p>"You will remember I warned you in New York," he continued. "A soldier
  doesn't look far enough ahead. Your men were well fed, well looked after,
  well pensioned. They weren't philosophers. They didn't appreciate the fact
  that theirs, from your point of view, was an unnatural existence. You tried
  to pitchfork them out into civil life without preparing them sufficiently for
  the change. Then arrived that little nest of conspirators you brought back
  from New York, and the whole thing was easy. You went too fast, Samara. You
  brought it off with the first million, but you ought to have waited for a
  year or so afterwards."</p>

  <p>Samara nodded and changed the subject almost abruptly.</p>

  <p>"What's the last move in the city?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Pride shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"This is such a kid glove sort of affair," he observed, "that I should
  have thought Nicholas Imanoff would have been round here to consult you.
  There's some talk about a ceremony to-morrow of some description. I heard
  there were a hundred men working upon the cathedral bells."</p>

  <p>Metzger re-entered with the air of one who brings tidings.</p>

  <p>"Sir," he announced, "the Archbishop is here and begs to be received."</p>

  <p>"You can show his lordship in at once," Samara directed. "Don't go away,
  Pride. It's as well there should be some historian of the period present. Sit
  at the other end there and listen if you wish to."</p>

  <p>The Archbishop, followed by a chaplain, was shown in with some formality.
  He was a large, bulky man, with a black beard, commanding physique, a
  splendid forehead, and piercing eyes. Even in his strangely fashioned
  vestments he was a person of dignity.</p>

  <p>"Mr. President," he said, as Samara rose to receive him, "you will permit
  me to explain the reason of my visit."</p>

  <p>"If your lordship will be seated," Samara begged.</p>

  <p>The Bishop leaned his elbow upon the table and played for a moment with
  one of his rings.</p>

  <p>"You are doubtless in touch, sir," he proceeded, "with the trend of
  events. I have been asked tomorrow morning to open the cathedral and to
  administer the sacrament to Nicholas Imanoff and the Princess Catherine of
  Urulsk, his intended bride."</p>

  <p>Samara made no movement. He sat quite still, looking beyond the walls of
  his room.</p>

  <p>"You and I, sir," the Archbishop went on, after a moment's pause, "have
  had little to do with one another during the years of your office&mdash;much
  sometimes to my regret. From the material point of view, Russia will never be
  able to forget what it owes you. You have brought the country out of a state
  of pitiful misery and filled her veins with new and vigorous health. If it
  has not seemed good to you, or according to your convictions, to think also
  of her spiritual welfare, that, alas! in these days, is no uncommon thing.
  You cannot blame me, however, if, as the head of the Church, I welcome
  frankly a new r&eacute;gime which incorporates at least the outward
  observances of the Christian faith with its ceremonies of state."</p>

  <p>"I do not blame you, indeed, Archbishop," Samara acknowledged. "From your
  point of view, this must be a wonderful change. The pageantry of monarchy
  needs the background of ecclesiastical ceremony."</p>

  <p>"Not only the outward form, I trust," the Archbishop ventured earnestly.
  "The ceremonies of our Church, even that one which will take place to-morrow,
  are as nothing if they are not symbolic of spiritual things."</p>

  <p>Samara bowed.</p>

  <p>"Your lordship has done kindly in coming to visit me," he said. "My work
  for Russia is over. The new government will bring you a larger sphere of
  action and greater responsibility. You have my best wishes."</p>

  <p>The Archbishop rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"You, sir," he pronounced, "stood shoulder to shoulder with the Church
  when you struck at the great dragon of atheism, and for that reason I beg you
  to accept my blessing."</p>

  <p>Samara bent his head. For a moment the sonorous voice of the priest seemed
  to be attuned to some deep note of music. Then his hand flashed back, and,
  followed by his chaplain, he was gone. Samara looked after him like a man in
  a dream.</p>

  <p>Presently Pride came up to offer his adieux.</p>

  <p>"What are your plans?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I am going abroad at once," Samara confided. "I am going to live in the
  most beautiful country I know; grow olives and grapes, farm a little, read a
  little, write a little. After all, I have earned a rest."</p>

  <p>"What part of the world do you choose?" Pride enquired.</p>

  <p>Samara shook his head.</p>

  <p>"When my wine-press makes its first revolution," he replied, "and I gather
  my first crop of olives, you shall know."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch38"
     id="ch38">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">No person had a finer view than Samara himself of the great
  pageant which transformed Moscow on the following day into a city of amazing
  beauty and splendour. He stood upon the roof of Government House, leaning
  against the solid parapet, looking down upon the great thoroughfare below, at
  the streets beyond, at the great dome of the cathedral above which the bells,
  silent for many years, were making clamorous music. Every house was decked
  with flags, every person in the crowded streets seemed to be carrying flowers
  or waving banners. With a grim smile he watched Trotsk, with an escort of
  mounted police, pass up towards the cathedral, pushing the people back on
  either side. They stood eight or nine deep upon the pavement&mdash;a solid
  phalanx, soldiers and civilians mixed together, good-humoured, cheering at
  everything, festive with the joy of a great holiday. Samara gazed down at
  them a little wistfully. After all it was his city; it was his brain which
  had made her what she was. Those two universities, the finest in the world,
  had been his conception. The hospitals, white-fronted, flower-begarlanded and
  hung with hundreds of flags, were of his building. It was he who had cleared
  out the dreaded foreign quarter, which the Soviet Government had allowed to
  become a very sewer of humanity, and erected the great warehouses there,
  every one of which was filled now to the topmost storey. It was he who, with
  a mayor of his own choosing, had studied deeply the question of civic
  administration, who was responsible for the wonderful transport, the perfect
  sanitary system, the broadening of the streets, the wonderful schools. All
  these things had come under his rule, almost at his instigation. Pride was
  right. It was unconscious ingratitude. The people had these things&mdash;they
  belonged to them&mdash;all thought as to their source had passed. Not once
  for him had those cathedral bells rung out their almost barbaric note of
  welcome. Not once had any crowd, such as he saw now, filled the streets and
  waited for his coming. Blazoned upon a hundred huge banners reared in
  prominent places he could read from where he stood the amazing electoral
  results. Nobody wanted anything more to do with the government which had
  brought prosperity to their doors, which had re-established them in twelve
  short years amongst the nations of the world. Nobody even thought of these
  things. There must lie somewhere engrained in the minds of men, he reflected,
  a sort of craving for the pageantry of life; to see life itself decked out
  with the trappings of ceremonial usage, an unconscious survival of the
  delight of savage ancestors in processions and drum-beatings. When the time
  came for the natural revulsion of sentiment, people would think of him
  without a doubt, historians would praise him, they might even raise a statue
  to his memory. And in the meantime those hideous figures telling their
  humiliating story of his defeat, and a crowd beside itself with delight!</p>

  <p>Trotsk and his men, who had ridden back, reappeared. In the distance,
  coming nearer, was a slowly-breaking wave of sound, of rapturous welcome.
  Samara felt a sudden quietness steal over him. He had come to this place that
  he might fully realise and ever afterwards forget this great blow of fate,
  that he might never look upon it as in any way accidental or dubious of its
  import. He was discarded by the will of the people. The hurt and grievousness
  of his humiliation seemed to him just then as nothing compared to the sharp
  pain at his heart when, from the sudden baring of heads, he knew that the
  moment had arrived. He gazed down, tense and motionless. The open automobile
  came into sight. Inside was a solitary figure&mdash;Nicholas Imanoff, in his
  prohibited uniform of white and silver, his hand to the salute, looking to
  the right and to the left&mdash;Nicholas, alone!</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," a familiar voice said behind him, "that I have rather
  spoilt the procession."</p>

  <p>Samara turned slowly round. He gripped the iron bar above his head until
  he almost fancied that it bent in his grasp. He stared incredulously at this
  impossible vision.</p>

  <p>"Such a beautiful gown it was they had for me to wear!" Catherine went on.
  "White, all covered with pearls, and a real Russian head-dress. It would have
  suited me wonderfully!"</p>

  <p>"What are you doing here, like this?" he asked, and for once in his life
  his voice was broken and choked.</p>

  <p>She laughed up at him. She was wearing the plain dark clothes and small
  hat with the rather faded flower, in which he had first seen her. On the
  ground by her feet was a square black box she had just set down.</p>

  <p>"I am Miss Catherine Borans, from the Weltmore Typewriting Agency," she
  announced. "You observe that I have not forgotten even the typewriter. Like a
  perfect secretary," she went on, "I have made all the arrangements. I have an
  automobile waiting at the side entrance. The streets at the back are
  absolutely empty. Your bag is packed and in the car with mine. We have just
  twenty minutes to catch the train."</p>

  <p>"Where to?" he asked, a little dazed.</p>

  <p>"The perfect secretary," she whispered, with a wonderful smile, "knows
  exactly where to go. A little way beyond Monaco, a little way into the hills,
  a few yards down a rose-entwined avenue of olives! We have plenty of time,
  but I think we ought to go!"</p>

  <p>Nicholas Imanoff was mounting the steps of the cathedral. The bells, which
  had ceased for a moment or two, suddenly pealed out in their wildest
  clamour.</p>

  <p>"For us," she murmured, her arms stealing out towards him. "Wasn't it
  wonderful for that to happen just as you are going to kiss me!"</p>
