    <p>
      Mrs. St. George looked out into Cardigan Square. The high,
      Georgian window framed a picture that was seen in winter
      and in spring, in autumn and in summer, and so familiar had
      it become to her that it seemed to possess no more than a
      casual significance. But on this April day, in the year
      nineteen hundred and eighteen, Mrs. St. George saw the
      square like a face strange with sudden emotion, or a
      landscape sad with the young greenness of a wintry spring.
      Standing in the middle of the room she saw this strip
      framed by the window, the familiar details, the gradations
      of the vista, the wood-paved roadway touching the kerb of
      the flagged path, the black railings of the garden, the
      young green of sprouting lilacs and privets, the kind of
      blue-grey gloom hanging in the sooty shrubberies, the thin
      green of the London grass, the maculated trunks of the old
      plane-trees, the spread of their tops, the vague redness of
      the houses beyond, and above it all a square panel of sky.
      On this April day a south-west wind moved the branches of
      the plane-trees; sudden sunshine was followed by sudden
      shadow; the wet trees would glisten or grow black.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Abominable!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She uttered the word aloud, and it was a strange word for
      so cold and so self-contained a woman to utter. She had
      been standing there for quite five minutes, holding a
      letter that had changed the familiar sameness of her
      outlook upon this London square. She was a tall woman,
      handsome, fiftyish or more, with one of those firm white
      faces, and lips that close decisively over very regular
      teeth. Someone had once called her an Arctic Juno. Her
      wavy, fair hair had a fallacious softness. Her eyes were
      very blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a corner, on the right of one of the windows, stood a
      big bureau, mahogany, capacious and solid. Clara St. George
      was a woman of affairs, and all her multifarious letters
      and papers were kept under perfect control. With a
      deliberate and yet sudden movement she approached her desk,
      placed her son's letter on the writing-pad, and glanced at
      a card upon which various telephone numbers were neatly
      recorded. The telephone was attached to the wall beside her
      desk. She rang up the exchange. There was something
      characteristic of her in the way in which she put out a
      hand and took down the receiver. The gesture was
      possessive. Always and firmly she had grasped the desired
      object and uttered decisively the word "mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exchange--are you there? Give me 10097."
    </p>
    <p>
      She waited. Her blue eyes looked out at the sudden sunlight
      in the tops of the plane-trees. She stood very still. Never
      yet had she allowed her body or her emotions to be hurried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes grew more hard and attentive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo--! Is that Sir Murray Hurder's? Yes. O, it is you,
      Sir Murray. Mrs. St. George speaking. I have just heard
      that they are sending my son out to the front. What? Yes,
      to France. It's disgraceful. They have passed him as fit.
      You have known him since he was ten--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused and stood listening, lips pressed to a pale
      hardness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shocked--? Naturally. It's abominable. What, nothing can
      be done? Yes, of course, I understand--This brutal
      business--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She hung up the receiver. She glanced at her son's letter
      which she had placed on the blotting-pad. Her face
      expressed resentment. For twenty years or so she had
      possessed her son, and possessed him as she had never
      possessed his father. He had never escaped from her firm,
      white hands--and now--! This abominable war had seized him,
      and after three years of confident security! He had been a
      delicate child; he was supposed to have a "heart"; he had
      been given a home-service job with one of the home-service
      battalions in East Anglia. She had come to regard him as so
      blessedly unfit and safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those wretched Germans and their March offensive! This
      exasperating war, with its brutal interferences, its sudden
      snatching at that which was hers!
    </p>
    <p>
      She crossed the room and rang the bell, and stood looking
      out into the familiar square. She was afraid, but she would
      not let herself acknowledge it. She had been a Smythe, and
      the Smythes had always stood erect and met life's
      impertinences with fine composure. And England of 1918 was
      so full of impertinences, in its shops and its taxis, in
      its railway-trains, even in the departments of the Inland
      Revenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cummins--I expect Mr. Alex to-morrow. He is coming home on
      leave before going to the front."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cummins' benign spectacles glimmered. She had known Mr.
      Alex at an age when he could fall up or down steps and
      blood his knees. She had called him her "Lamb." She looked
      both frightened and shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Alex going out--madam!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George answered her with a slight and dignified
      movement of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      II
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      The young green of the year shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alex St. George had been walking hard for half an hour as
      though trying to overtake a sense of warmth, but the spring
      day had no heart in it. The thorn hedges were powdered with
      young leaves, but, overhead, elms groped blackly at a grey
      sky. It was a land of elms, towering and melancholy, with
      the grass looking like a shabby coat, and the young wheat
      tinged yellow. Young St. George walked as though he had an
      east wind blowing in his face, but no east wind blew. It
      was one of those raw, dead days.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he was afraid. He carried with him a horrible sense of
      emptiness, in spite of a good lunch at the battalion "mess"
      at the "King's Head" in Letchford, and a tot of rum in his
      coffee. He had come out to get warm, and because he felt
      too restless and miserable to do anything but walk. It
      seemed to him that he could go on walking interminably
      along any muddy road in this raw, grey England; for it was
      England, though the young green of it had for him a kind of
      anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the top of a hill where a flint cottage stood between
      two converging lanes, he turned aside to lean upon a field
      gate, and to stare at a brown and cloddy piece of
      plough-land. In the garden of the cottage a very old
      pear-tree had smothered itself in blossom, and its
      whiteness was like the glare of snow against the blue-grey
      gloom of the landscape. Young St. George could see
      Letchford town streaking the valley with a thin redness,
      and over it hung a mist of smoke. It looked very still and
      silent. A robin sang plaintively in the cottage garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      O, this England, this sodden, grey, beautiful, secure,
      mist-smudged England! And the spring was coming!
    </p>
    <p>
      Young St. George's chin came to rest upon his crossed arms.
      His eyes stared. He had very expressive eyes set rather
      wide in a broadish, sensitive face. He was a boy who
      flushed easily. At school they had called him "Alice."
    </p>
    <p>
      But on this April day his face had a greyness. His eyes
      stared; his nostrils looked pinched.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the crisis had been so sudden. It had found him so
      unprepared, so flabbily and comfortably secure, so sure
      that he would not have to face the bloody business out
      yonder. It had shocked him. He had felt as though someone
      had pulled him out of a warm bed at three o'clock on an icy
      morning. He was a little, whimpering boy. He wanted to cry
      out--"Mother--I'm afraid."
    </p>
    <p>
      For--somehow--he felt that they had not treated him fairly,
      these doctor men who had allowed him to play in khaki for
      three years, and then had started to hustle him out into
      all that horror. Had he but known--! He would have felt
      more resigned to it, more ready. He had been very ready to
      go in the beginning, but for three years or more they had
      allowed him to assume the conviction of a comfortable
      unfitness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up at the white pear-tree. It seemed to mock him
      like a girl wearing a white garland.
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      III
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George sat waiting at her drawing-room window. Her
      limitations were so well concealed from the eyes of the
      average man and woman that almost it might be said that she
      was without limitations. She cherished a sense of personal
      dignity, being a woman who looked into no other mirror but
      her own, and seeing herself in it as Mrs. St. George of No.
      77 Cardigan Square, and Melfont St. Georges in the county
      of Dorset. Her dignity had known no falterings, possibly
      because no impediments had placed themselves successfully
      in the path of it. She drove her emotions--such as they
      were--like a team of horses under perfect control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even when her husband had been carried in from the
      hunting-field with a broken back, she had sat with a kind
      of rigid and consenting calmness beside his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's rather rough on me, Clara--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She could remember his wide eyes looking up at her, and
      suddenly he had turned his face away, and had died
      strangely and silently without giving her another look or
      word. That she had failed him in that hour of his
      bewildering and dreadful darkness seemed to have been
      beyond her understanding. She did not understand men, the
      eternal boy in man; she had not understood her husband.
      Poor, easy, impulsive Charlie St. George! Even at the last
      she had not understood his look of appeal, or heard the
      muttered cry of "Mother." It had not been a happy marriage.
      She had been so cold and so dominant.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat and waited for her son. She watched a
      sandy-coloured cat stalking sparrows in the sooty
      shrubberies of the square's garden. She had possessed her
      son, or thought that she had possessed him, as she had
      never possessed her husband, and so confident had her cry
      of "Mine" become, that in this crisis, when tumultuous
      circumstances were sweeping her son away from her control,
      she sat as she had sat beside her dying husband's bed. She
      disliked emotion; she was afraid of it; she suppressed it.
      Anger she would allow herself upon occasions, the anger of
      a cold and self-cherishing egoist. She realized her crisis,
      and yet did not realize it in its completeness. Neither did
      she realize that if one particular emotion is allowed
      righteous expression, while other emotions are suppressed,
      that one emotion may become infinitely dangerous. Always,
      she felt so right when she was angry. Her anger could be a
      cold blast from which more warmly blooded people shrank and
      retreated. It had been a very successful emotion, and
      perhaps that is why it had always seemed so right.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was angry now. She was angry with the war, and with the
      Germans, and with the doctors, and also most strangely
      angry with her son. She had a feeling that somehow he
      should have contrived to continue physically unfit. She
      detested interference--interference of any kind. She
      resented any affair being taken out of her very capable
      hands. When she sat on a committee--and she sat on
      many--she sat on them in other respects. She was both a St.
      George and a Smythe.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was angry with poor Cummins, for Cummins had come into
      the room with a suggestion of undisciplined emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Alex's room, madam; shall I light a fire?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course--light a fire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But cook says, madam--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The cook--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is less than a hundredweight of coal--"

    <p>
      "Very well, it is April, and Mr. Alex is a soldier."
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat and watched that sandy-coloured cat intent upon its
      feline adventures. It suggested a sequence of thoughts,
      compensating reflections. Yes, Alex was still very much
      hers. He had not been stalked and captured by some young
      feline creature. He had not lapsed into one of those
      disastrous war marriages. If he was going out to France he
      was going out wholly hers. She did not want Alex to marry.
      She could presume that without her consent he would not be
      able to marry. He had no profession. The property was hers
      for life. She allowed her son five hundred a year and, of
      course--some day--But all that was a very long way off, and
      she need not consider it. She did not consider it.

    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. St. George's taxi turned into Cardigan Square. A brown
      kit-bag and a green canvas valise were piled beside the
      driver, and Mr. St. George sat with his little white cane
      between his knees, and his eyes looking out at the trees
      and the houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could see No. 77, its green area railings, white steps,
      mahogany door, brass knocker, white window-sashes, old gold
      curtains. It looked just as it had looked when as a
      youngster of seven he had played in the square garden, and
      trundled a hoop across a roadway innocent of taxis, and had
      fallen up the white steps and blooded one of his knees. And
      old Cummins--dear old Cummins--had picked up her "Lamb,"
      and carried him up to the bathroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes--the house was just the same, and yet how different,
      because the world was different, and he was going out to
      France, and he was afraid. He could not get warm. And it
      seemed to him that No. 77 had a new, flat, chilly surface,
      an air of austerity. It looked all buttoned up to the chin
      in its smoky brickwork.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got out of the taxi. Someone had been waiting, for the
      door opened immediately and he saw the glimmer of Cummins's
      round spectacles, and the two patches of bright colour over
      her high cheek-bones. The taxi-man was handling the kit-bag
      and valise, and doing it cheerfully, a thing that he would
      not have done for a civilian.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo--Cummins--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Cummins's face had a tremulous look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--Mr. Alex--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was still her "Lamb." She wanted to put her arms round
      him and call him "my dear." He had been such a lovable
      child. And he was going out to the front, and she felt
      quite sure that he was not fit to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mater in--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upstairs, sir--"
    </p>
    <p>
      The passage-hall gave him an impression of darkness. He
      laid his cap and stick on the oak table, and heard the tall
      clock with the brass face ticking as it had always ticked.
      He saw the stairs, and the red pile carpet and the brass
      rods, and the faded "prints" hanging on the cream walls.
      The taxi-man was breathing hard over the luggage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Carry it up, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you--? I'd be obliged to you--"
    </p>
    <p>
      The man shouldered the valise, and Cummins came to take Mr.
      Alex's British warm. She felt towards him just as she had
      felt when she had helped him off with his little overcoat
      when he had come back from school. She wanted to burst into
      tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better show the chap up, Cummins."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Mr. Alex--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And pay him, will you? Here's some money. Give him a
      two-bob tip. I'll go on up."
    </p>
    <p>
      He ascended the stairs, and they felt soft under his feet,
      and yet everything about the house had a strangeness. It
      was so quiet, so muffled--and somehow it felt so cold. On
      the landing the same oak chest with its heraldic panels
      stood under the landing window, with the same
      blue-and-white faience bowl upon it. The old gold curtains
      framed a view of the square.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened the drawing-room door. His mother was seated at
      her desk, with letters and papers spread under her hands.
      She rose. She stood beside her chair, a restrained and
      dignified figure, acknowledging no impulse, and no hurried
      breathing, her white face apparently serene. There was no
      lighting up of her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said:
    </p>
    <p>
      . . . "Well--you are a little late--"
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment they stood looking at each other, and in that
      moment something seemed to die away out of the son's eyes.
      It was as though a shadow had passed over his face. He gave
      a faint smile. He seemed to move forward with a slightly
      self-conscious awkwardness. He went and kissed his mother
      on the cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes--just a bit. Trains--not what they were."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got six days--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes--so you said. I've waited for tea. Will you ring--my
      dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to give her a momentary, flinching glance, and
      then went and rang the bell. His eyes had a sudden, inward
      look. It was as though he had been running towards some
      expected pleasure and had been flung back by a closing
      door. He had a feeling of bafflement, emptiness. That
      miserable and dolorous chilliness that he carried about
      inside him seemed to spread till he felt it in his spine
      and in his feet. He glanced at the brass tea-tray, sat
      down, and picked up the poker, and prodded the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not quite so cold as it has been--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George had resumed her seat at her desk, and was
      addressing an envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No--distinctly warmer. But cool--I'm afraid, my dear, we
      can't manage a fire in your room--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--that's all right, mater."
    </p>
    <p>
      "These restrictions are rather boring--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stole a look at her. He saw her pen give that final,
      decisive streak below the address upon the envelope. He
      wondered. He had a kind of frozen feeling. Why didn't--?
      But then he remembered that his mother had never stooped to
      impulse, that he had never run and clung about her knees,
      that always her pale head had been carried high in the air,
      unbendingly. But--did she not know--or understand--? How a
      chap felt--? How--he--felt? But--then--of
      course--gentlemen--English public-school boys--
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at the fire. He stretched out his hands to it,
      while Mrs. St. George blotted the envelope and affixed a
      stamp with perfect precision in the right upper corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      No--she would not allow emotion to intrude upon such an
      occasion. It was un-English, or un-English according to her
      code. Emotion was a nuisance, unseemly, like a kettle
      boiling over or a common child screaming. It did not help
      things. It upset your dignity. And after all, dignity was
      essential, calmness in the face of undisciplined
      circumstance. Dignity was of use. It carried you through
      awkward moments. She was not going to harrow her son or
      herself, make things worse by sentimentalizing over them.
      It made things seem worse than they were. She would send
      her son to France just as she had sent him off to school.
      For somehow it seemed to her that she would feel more sure
      of getting him back if she let him go as though the war was
      a gentlemanly and sedate business, not to be taken with
      tears and a gulp.

    <p>
      Mrs. St. George dined at eight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything was the same as it had always been. Cummins,
      when she was not handling dishes or clearing away plates,
      stood by the Hepplewhite sideboard. The same portraits of
      the same St. Georges looked down from the walls upon mother
      and son. "Waterloo St. George," in his guardsman's coat,
      smiled that half-ironical smile. There was the same silver
      on the table, the forks with the St. George monogram, the
      Regency salt-cellars, mustard-pots and pepperets, the same
      white service with the blue border. Red and white tulips
      filled the wedgwood vase in the centre of the table. The
      old gold curtains, drawn over the closed shutters, seemed
      to emit a soft glow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Embarrassment made a third at the table. To Cummins, Mr.
      Alex looked all eyes; he seemed to have no appetite; she
      noticed that he glanced often at his mother as though
      interrogating that coldly handsome and impassive face.
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      VI
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      About a quarter past nine Cummins heard the front door
      slam. She paused in the act of drying a glass tumbler, and
      supposed that Mr. Alex had gone out, and she allowed
      herself to wonder where he had gone and why. She was
      worried about her "Lamb." She could not forget that face of
      his at the dinner-table, with its wide and restless eyes,
      and its air of flinching from something.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Cummins her mistress was just Mrs. St. George, Mr.
      Alex's mother, a figure that had grown so familiar that
      Cummins had ceased to wonder at it, but on this April night
      Cummins did wonder. It seemed to her that her mistress was
      a very unusual woman, so astoundingly cold and
      self-possessed, so unlike the kind of mother you expected
      to see upon the films or the stage. At dinner she behaved
      as though there was no war, and Mr. Alex had just come down
      from Oxford--
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's a queer one," was Cummins' comment. "You'd think she
      was made of marble."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cummins finished her washing up and her putting away, and
      left her pantry to sit by the fire and talk to the cook.
      There were no other servants in the house in the April of
      1918, for the under-maid was on munitions, and the
      man-servant had joined up in 1915. Cummins and the cook
      exchanged confidences, while upstairs Mrs. St. George sat
      at her desk, and glanced through the notes she had made at
      certain of her committee meetings. She believed in being
      occupied, even when her son had left her with unaccountable
      suddenness, and had gone out mumbling that he was going to
      try and buy some cigarettes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May find a shop open."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most unlikely. Air-raids, remember--"
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had gone out, and she had heard the slamming of that
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten o'clock struck, and Mr. Alex had not returned, and the
      cook, yawning behind a fat red hand, declared that she was
      going to bed, but Cummins did not feel like bed. She was
      going to wait up for Mr. Alex; she knew that he had no
      latchkey; she ascended to the hall, and after turning off
      the lights, sat down on the oak chair by the window. She
      pulled aside a fold of the heavy curtains, and raising the
      blind for a couple of inches, peered out into the square.
      It looked black as a piece of sable velvet, but above the
      tops of the houses opposite, the sky was pricked thick with
      stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No moon--thank the Lord," said Cummins, feelingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But where was Mr. Alex? The tall clock went on ticking, and
      the square was as silent as a graveyard, its windows
      curtained up, its pavements deserted, and Cummins began to
      have an unpleasant, creepy feeling. She dropped the blind,
      and rearranged the curtains, and rose and turned on one of
      the lights. The hands of the clock stood at half past ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cummins sat there and heard eleven strike. Mrs. St.
      George's hour for retiring was eleven, but the drawing-room
      door above remained shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, just when the large hand of the clock was on the
      quarter Cummins heard footsteps. They came along the side
      walk; they were rather hurried and irregular footsteps.
      There was a pause; someone stumbled against one of the
      steps; she could hear a hand groping and feeling at the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went and opened it. She had to catch him by the arm. He
      swayed; he leaned against her; his cap was awry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Legs--l'legs--all--funny--somehow. C-ummins.
      I--so--sorry--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She closed the doorway gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--Mr. Alex--my dear--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "M-mater--gone to bed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      Drunk though he was, he looked scared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shouldn't have let go--like this--She--she wouldn't--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ssh--my dear; you ought to be in bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      She got him across the hall and up the first flight of
      stairs. "Ssh--my dear--!" But there was no need for her to
      suggest silence, for Alex St. George, drunk though he was,
      had no desire to meet his mother. His getting drunk had
      been a sort of human protest. It had made him feel warm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Softly--old Cummins--"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Cummins's surreptitious shepherding of her "Lamb" to
      his bedroom where a key could be turned in a lock, and
      excuses offered from behind a closed door, was not to be
      permitted. The drawing-room door opened when Cummins and
      Mr. Alex were preparing to ascend the second flight of
      stairs, and Mrs. St. George came out upon the landing.

    <p>
      At No. 7 Vernor Street, somewhere between Piccadilly and
      Pall Mall, Mrs. Sarah Greenwood kept a tobacco shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      No. 7 was a flat-faced London house, stuccoed and painted
      cream, its window-sashes and sills a dull chocolate, and
      its private door to the right of the shop of the same
      colour as the window-frames. The shop was small but
      double-fronted, with a glass door in the middle. Upon a
      black fascia board was painted in letters of gold, "S.
      Greenwood, Cigar Merchant."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Greenwood and her two daughters, Corah and Kitty,
      lived above the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vernor Street had a faded and mellow distinction of its
      own, a lingering flavour as of Parma violets and pomaded
      heads. It suggested the hansom-cab and the silk hat, and
      had a sedan chair appeared in it on some dim evening the
      windows of Vernor Street might have expressed no surprise.
      Mayfair, or the male part of Mayfair, still shopped here at
      old establishments that had known the "Georges" and in the
      planting of herself in Vernor Street Mrs. Sarah Greenwood
      had accepted risks and shown great good sense. She was a
      doctor's widow. Her husband, who had practised within
      shouting distance of the Whitechapel Road, and who had been
      what has been called a "Sixpenny Healer," had died suddenly
      of pneumonia some seven years before the war, leaving his
      widow with some <i>£</i>800 in Colonial stock, and two
      young daughters. Hence, the adventure of No. 7 Vernor
      Street, and the insinuating of a little, solid, courageous
      body between a military bootmaker's and a military
      tailor's. Mrs. Sarah, shrewdly daring, had come and seen
      and conquered. She had realized the power of a personality.
      She had fitted herself into Vernor Street as nicely as a
      nut into its shell.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Vernor Street still eschewed cheapness. It had a
      certain distinguished, shabby rightness; it was in the
      midst of "club-land"; it gave scope for the persuasions of
      a personality. It did not glitter; it did not co-operate;
      it did not pile itself to the skies and fly the flags of
      half the nations, and advertise itself as a sort of
      cosmopolitan truck-shop. It was English and individual, and
      in Vernor Street there was no more individual person than
      Mrs. Sarah. She had a reputation, and two pretty daughters.
    </p>
    <p>
      For, in coming to Vernor Street Mrs. Sarah Greenwood had
      realized that the mere selling of cigars and pipes and
      cigarettes was but a part of the business; what mattered
      was how and to whom you sold them. She knew how to strike
      the right note, or what was still better--to strike no note
      at all. Hence, the shop window of No. 7 Vernor Street had
      neither too much in it nor too little--and what was there
      was of the best. It could be called a gentleman's window,
      containing a selection of cigar boxes, cedar-wood cabinets,
      a dozen or so briar pipes of the highest quality, a few
      boxes of cigarettes. For Mrs. Sarah had arrived at that
      position when she did not need to rely upon her shop
      window. She was a person. It would be no exaggeration to
      say that quite thirty per cent. of the officers who had
      gone out with the Expeditionary Force in 1914 had known
      Mrs. Sarah Greenwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      And with the coming of the Great War Mrs. Sarah had become
      a still more notable and successful woman. She had sold
      cigars and given of her wisdom and her humour to the old
      army, and in the nature of things her name had become known
      to the new. She was a great little woman, a piece of old
      England. Officers home on leave came to meet and to sit in
      the red divan behind the shop, brass hats, red hats, blue
      hats, plain second lieutenants, guardsmen, riflemen,
      gunners, cavalry-men. She was a cheerful person to visit.
      She understood men. She had such vitality. You had only to
      look at those roguish dark eyes in the round face with its
      broad blunt nose that had a way of wrinkling itself up, to
      feel--somehow--that life was a great business.
    </p>
    <p>
      As some old warrior put it: "She fills you up."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had such a heart in her. She stood about five feet
      high, and her hair was as black as a crow's back. Her mouth
      was big and red and expressive. She had the kindest and the
      shrewdest of tongues, and a fine sense of humour. She could
      flatter and she could scold, but there was not a shred of
      the shrew in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Business is business--"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was. She was doing big business. How often were the
      words spoken in overseas messes: "O--you can get them at
      Sarah's--Vernor Street--you know." The army mail-bags
      carried her packets into all sorts of odd places, French
      and Flemish farmhouses, dug-outs, headquarter messes. Women
      came to No. 7 Vernor Street, wives, sisters, and others. "I
      want to send some cigars out--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes--through all those years Mrs. Sarah and her daughters
      had been kept very busy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a solid woman, and nowhere else had her solidity
      expressed itself more fundamentally than in the bringing up
      of her daughters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her text had been "No Nonsense." She had sent them both to
      goodish schools, and had yet contrived to keep them soundly
      hers. They had a share in the business, and though comely
      young women, they shared their mother's sense and solidity.
      Adoration was not a word much used in the Greenwood
      vocabulary, but Mrs. Sarah had deserved and been given
      something that was better than adoration.

    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty Greenwood was opening the shop. She had unlocked the
      iron grill that was drawn at night across the glass-fronted
      door, and having pushed it to one side, she stood in the
      doorway, and looked up and down Vernor Street as though she
      found Vernor Street as good to look at as an English
      garden. There had been rain in the night, and the air was
      fresh. The sun, climbing beyond the spire of St. James's
      church, drew a band of yellow light along one half the
      street. Across the way Fream's Hotel was pulling up its
      blinds. A hotel porter in black trousers and a dark blue
      waistcoat was watering the two clipped standard bay-trees
      that grew in green tubs on either side of the hotel
      entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      An officer, brushing his hair at one of the windows of
      "Fream's," bent forward to look at Kitty Greenwood. She
      stood about as high as her mother, five feet or so; she had
      a bobbed head of honey-coloured hair with some darker
      shadowings intermixed with it; at a little distance her
      eyes looked black in the glowing roundness of her face. She
      was a solid little person, with a beautiful throat, and a
      chin that had a white firmness. She stood confidently upon
      her small feet. If she guessed that she was being looked at
      from the windows of Fream's Hotel, she was not disconcerted
      or intrigued by the scrutiny. She had grown accustomed to
      being looked at by all sorts of men, oldish men, young men,
      bold men, hungry men. And it is possible that she had come
      to understand that to many of these poor lads she was
      golden fruit, the more desirable because death might pluck
      life from their lips any moment. She had been kind to men,
      but without desiring to give herself to any one of them.
      She had a exceptional sturdiness. And in the shop she could
      be something of a little autocrat. There was no nonsense
      about Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice came to her from within--the voice of the charwoman
      busy in the divan. It said something about cigarette-ends
      and matches and the carpet. It was full of cheerful Cockney
      complaints.
    </p>
    <p>
      "These young gents--! You'd think--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty replied to the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They--don't--think, Mrs. Higgins. They don't want to
      think--"
    </p>
    <p>
      There were sounds of brushings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All over the cushions, too. You'd think as how--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, six of them, Mrs. Higgins--they went back to the
      front this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--lord--Wictoria!--Pore lads--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, six young scallywags, hard-bitten youngsters, with
      strained blue eyes! Her mother had a soft place in her
      heart for such scallywags; she was kinder to them than
      Kitty was, for Kitty had a sense of order, and like many
      little women she stood upon her young dignity. Mrs. Sarah
      had collected a whole battalion of scallywags, and mothered
      them, and somehow kept them from going where they might
      have gone. Yes, her mother was a dear. She seemed to
      understand--
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Kitty did not know that a very stately old fellow,
      with one of those fine, simple English faces had spoken of
      Mrs. Sarah as "A moral force." Not that he used those very
      words. What he did say was that Mrs. Sarah was worth a
      whole trainful of padres.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's--so--human, my dear fellow. She knows--"
    </p>
    <p>
      So Kitty re-entered the shop, and taking a little feather
      dusting-brush from a shelf under the counter, began to set
      it whisking about among the cigar boxes and over the glass
      cases full of pipes and cigarette-holders. She loved the
      shop. She liked its order, its neatness, its polished cases
      and cabinets, its mahogany and its glass, the shelves full
      of boxes and drums of cigars, the cigarettes--gold-tipped
      and cork-tipped, lying in their little boxes, the sleek
      unsoiled pipes. She was a very clean young creature,
      supremely healthy within and without. The war had not
      blurred her outlines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she went to examine the till. She was less
      decorative and more practical than her sister Corah, and
      the till and its contents were Kitty's particular concern.
      She checked its contents twice a day, withdrew and locked
      away the superfluous cash, and saw to it each morning that
      there was a proper supply of change available. She liked
      her paper money clean and uncrumpled, and kept the pounds
      and ten-shilling notes neatly clipped in separate packets.
      Half-crowns, florins, shillings, sixpences had each a
      compartment, and her copper money lived in a flat brown
      cigar box. The charwoman had finished tidying the divan,
      and had closed the door that separated the divan from the
      shop. The door had a long mirror attached to it, and Kitty,
      after sliding a pile of florins back into the till,
      happened to glance in the direction of this mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw a figure reflected in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was but one of the thousands of figures that had
      impressed their images upon that mirror, the reflection of
      a young officer in khaki, slim in the leg, and rather
      slightly built about the shoulders. He stood in the
      doorway, but there was a hesitancy in his attitude. There
      was something about his eyes--
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty closed the till. She had a feeling that she had only
      to say "Shoo--!" and that figure in the doorway would
      disappear like a vagrant shadow, and for a moment she
      continued to look into the mirror. She had seen thousands
      of faces, stolid faces, raw faces, shrinking faces, faces
      that were wilfully gay or helplessly overcast. Sometimes
      she had met eyes that had given her little qualms.
    </p>
    <p>
      But--this face--somehow--was different from all the others,
      though why it was different she could not say. She realized
      that the eyes were looking at her. They had a kind of wide,
      appealing dumbness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to flinch slightly. His right hand jerked itself
      upwards in a salute.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want some cigarettes--straight-cuts--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He took three steps into the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Virginian?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What--kind?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--anything--I--Gold Flake will do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How many?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--fifty."
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      III
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked out several boxes for him to choose from, and
      his eyes remained fixed upon her with a peculiar and
      questioning intentness. They followed all her movements,
      and watched both her face and her hands. She had been
      stared at before with the same kind of hungriness; she was
      conscious of it, and yet this young man's hungriness had a
      quality of its own. He looked pinched and cold. It was as
      though he had been shivering in a raw wind, and had seen
      the glow of a fire and had come in to it. His eyes seemed
      to discover in her a beautiful, human warmness, a glow, a
      something that was disastrously sweet and poignant and
      beyond him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about these? Taylor's Navy Cut?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded, his glance falling suddenly to her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you. Yes--they'll do."
    </p>
    <p>
      And she thought: "Yes, most of them drink too much, poor
      lads." But her impression of him as a feverish celebrant
      almost instantly corrected itself. He looked very new and
      clean, and rather fragile; he was wearing no flashes; and
      she missed in him that slightly coarsened air, a heaviness
      that characterized the men who had seen active service.
      Their faces appeared smudged as though a heavy hand had
      pressed upon their youthfulness, and rubbed out or blurred
      the more delicate lines. She had a feeling that this boy
      with the wide and startled eyes was very new to it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      He brought out a ten-shilling note, and as he handed it to
      her she noticed that his fingers communicated a fine tremor
      to the crisp piece of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very cold--still."
    </p>
    <p>
      She handed him the change. She said that she thought it was
      a beautiful day, and he looked at her as though she were
      mocking him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--yes--I suppose so."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was April, and to him she seemed a part of April, with
      her skin like apple-blossom, and her eyes like sloes, and
      as beautifully tantalizing as the young green of the year.
      He stood silently staring at a round rubber mat on the
      counter, as though not knowing how to go or to stay. His
      face had what she might have described as a naked look. He
      seemed to loiter as though warming himself at a fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Home on leave?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Those startled eyes of his met hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Going out next week."
    </p>
    <p>
      "First time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes fell again. He unbuttoned the flap of a pocket and
      slipped the cigarette box into it, and fumbled at the
      button. She glanced at his badges. Infantry, yes. She must
      have known the badges of every regiment in the army. And
      suddenly she found herself on the edge of a most poignant
      pity for him, nor had any other man moved her to such
      compassion. She felt that he was quite unfit for the brutal
      business out yonder. In that little red and white room
      behind the shop Kitty had heard men blurt things out. You
      might be able to talk to a shopgirl as you could not talk
      to your mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things were apt to happen either very slowly or very
      suddenly during the war, nor was Kitty Greenwood
      thistledown. That a strange lad should walk into her
      mother's shop at half past eight on an April morning and
      rouse such an impulse of pity in her was both extraordinary
      and natural. Air-raids had brought the incredible to your
      very doorstep. She did not question the impulse. There was
      nothing and everything to keep him standing there, and it
      was obvious to her that he was loth to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      She picked up a little glass tray full of cigarettes, and
      held it out to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had breakfast?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at her face before taking a cigarette, nor did
      the glance question her modesty; it seemed to search below
      the surface for some deeper solace, a gentle warmth that
      would breathe near him in the night of his dread.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you. I have got six days."
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to fumble in a pocket, but she was ready with a
      match before his ineffectual fingers could produce a box.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had very pretty white hands, plump but not too plump,
      with soft, blunt finger-tips. Men should be wary of pointed
      fingers. Her head came no higher than his shoulder but her
      sturdiness made him appear the fragile figure. She offered
      him the match flame, and as he bent to light the cigarette,
      she studied his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes met hers. Not often had she been looked at in that
      way, with a sensitive, dumb, startled shyness. It changed
      an impulse into what--was--perhaps--the most deliberate act
      of her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "London's a lonely place. Hundreds of boys come in
      here--just to talk. Talking seems to help--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was aware of the surprise in his eyes, and something
      more than surprise. It was as though she had opened a door
      to a shivering dog. And she went and opened the door of the
      divan. She said: "You can smoke that cigarette in there--if
      you like. My mother will be down in a minute." He walked
      into the divan, and she followed from behind the counter,
      leaving the door open. He stood. He took off his cap. She
      noticed that he remained standing until she sat down on the
      red-cushioned sofa. He took one of the chairs, and bending
      forward, rested his elbows on his knees, but his attitude
      did not suggest repose. He was very nervous, and his
      nervousness infected her in a most strange way for she
      became conscious of this little red and white room as a
      place full of ghosts, the ghosts of men who had sat on
      those cushions, and whose red blood had been spilt over
      yonder. Dead lads, dust, a few tarnished buttons and
      rotting khaki! Something cried out in her. She glanced
      sideways and almost fearfully at the boy beside her.
      He--too--perhaps?
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's very peaceful in here--somehow."
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      She understood. His startled eyes, and his air of dumb and
      inarticulate appeal revealed him to her. He wanted to talk
      to someone, to talk as he had never talked before, to empty
      himself and his fear. She had a feeling that he had no one
      to whom he could talk, or who would understand the things
      he had to say. He was afraid, and dared not say so. He had
      to pretend, and he was not doing it very well. He was both
      afraid and ashamed of his fear, but not so ashamed of it as
      to wish to hide it completely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Staying at an hotel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He started; he had gone off into a sort of overcast
      reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No--at my mater's. Cardigan Square."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are out early."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I woke up early. Felt I wanted to walk. My name is St.
      George."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mine's Greenwood--Kitty. My mother owns this business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O," he said, and brooded.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wondered how long he had been in the army, and how it
      was that he had not been out before. She thought that he
      did not look very strong; he had one of those delicate,
      clear skins that freckle easily; the texture of him had too
      sensitive a fineness. It seemed to show in his hair and his
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he surprised her. She had grown accustomed to the
      many franknesses of the war, an honesty that could be
      almost brutal. Either you had no skin at all, or a skin
      that was thickened and less sensitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was holding his cigarette between the first and second
      finger, and watching the smoke rising from it in a thin
      thread.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Funny, isn't it, that our class holds a cigarette like
      this, and the common chaps hold it with a thumb and finger?
      I sometimes wish--But that's neither here nor there. May I
      tell you something?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. She seemed to be growing more and more serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anything--you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I went home drunk last night. First time in my life. A
      rotten thing to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she was aware of that deep stirring of her
      compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--that might depend--" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On why--or how?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It shocked my mater. She's always so--perfectly right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was she shocked?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Awfully. But--I say--I ought not to be talking like
      this--I don't know what you must think--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him for a moment, knitting up her straight,
      broad forehead, and then she rose and closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I understand--That makes it all right, doesn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared up at her with those wide eyes of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean--you understand--why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not? The war's a beastly business. I know. And if you
      like--you can tell me--"
    </p>
    <p>
      His head went down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I simply can't tell you. I can't tell anyone. It's
      too--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down nearer to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you can. You can tell me. In fact--I think I know."
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to flinch as though she had touched some acutely
      sensitive and hidden wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are feeling rather bad--about going out there."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Lord, do I look as bad as that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--no."
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was horrified. He sat with his head between his
      hands, staring at the carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I must do. You must have seen. Everybody must see.
      When I'm out in the street I see people looking at me and
      thinking--'That fellow's afraid.' And--my God--it's true. I
      never knew that I--And it's horrible, so horribly
      humiliating--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat very still.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's natural. I've seen scores of men--who dreaded going
      out--And they were afraid of their own fear. You won't feel
      so bad about it--perhaps--now that someone knows."
    </p>
    <p>
      His head remained down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you must--despise me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No--not for a moment. Isn't every man afraid? Of course. I
      have heard a V.C. boy say--here in this very room--that any
      man who said that he didn't know what fear was, was either
      a liar or a fool."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," he said. "But--I wish--" and lapsed into
      silence, for having come out of his dark cupboard, the
      black hole of his unconfessed terror, he seemed to become
      acutely conscious of her as a woman, a sturdy little person
      with very dark and fearless eyes, and a glowing head, and a
      warm white skin. She had spoken of the day as a day of
      beauty, and suddenly he seemed to have his head in the
      sunlight. She had become to him a thing of beauty, a live,
      warm, human creature who somehow understood how a man felt.
      A girl in a shop! But then--! And he was sitting there
      within a yard of her, alive to the glow and the mystery of
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been awfully good to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, not a bit."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her shyly, but with slightly more confidence,
      and with a very definite homage in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Queer that I should have wandered in here? Almost as
      though it was meant--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps it was meant. I think there is somebody in the
      shop."
    </p>
    <p>
      When she opened the door Alex saw a tall officer with a
      very red face and a white moustache, and three rows of
      ribbons on his tunic, and crossed swords and two stars on
      his shoulder-straps. He stood in the middle of the shop; he
      gave the little figure in the green knitted coat a slight
      bow! he both smiled and looked at her like the very great
      gentleman that he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--Miss Kitty--I want a box of my usuals--if you
      please."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George's son sat and listened to those two
      pleasant voices. He threw quick and sensitive glances round
      the little room. It was strange how some rooms affected
      you, and this back room, with its red walls and white paint
      and red cushions, made you feel snug and warm and safe.
      Extraordinary chance--his drifting in here! He supposed
      that he ought to be going, but he did not want to go. No,
      not at all. In fact, his overcast mood threatened to return
      when he imagined himself out in the street and alone. Yet,
      he ought to go back to his mother, his much-shocked mother
      who was always so right.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw the general raise his hand to his cap, and disappear
      through the shop doorway. So a general could salute Miss
      Kitty Greenwood. Quite right. And Kitty was looking in at
      him with very intent dark eyes. He had become more than a
      chance and casual man sitting on her mother's sofa.
      Something had happened, and it had happened to them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      "General Gratton. He knew me when I had my hair down."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fine old boy. One of the sahibs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most of them are like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      She came into the room, and he looked up at her like a shy
      supplicant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose I ought to be going. I suppose you'll be busy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are always busy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you mind--if I stayed a little longer? It's so--so
      restful in here."
    </p>
    <p>
      She appeared to be considering something. She turned and
      looked through the doorway into Vernor Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The sun's shining. We generally have quite a crowd here."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood up. He thought that she was gently hinting. He was
      just as ready to efface himself. But she remained standing
      in the doorway. She put up her hand and touched her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One gets a little tired of crowds. Sometimes--I take a day
      off. You see--my mother and my sister--"
    </p>
    <p>
      His wide eyes gave a kind of eager flicker.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You couldn't--could you?--I mean--I have had no one to
      talk to. And you've been so awfully--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't go out--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; of course not. I really didn't mean. Not for a moment.
      Please believe--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down," she said, "I'll tell the others. I'll go and
      put on a hat."

      When Kitty opened the door of the upstairs sitting-room she
      saw her mother sitting, as Mrs Sarah always sat after
      breakfast, settled well back in an arm-chair between the
      fireplace and the near window. Her mother had worked hard,
      and loved her comfort, and being a comfortable woman no one
      ever grudged it to her. Her daughters would tuck a tuffet
      under her feet. The Greenwoods' was not a sentimental
      household, but when a woman understood her daughters as
      Mrs. Sarah understood them she had a claim to
      consideration. Youth loves where it likes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you, poppet? Poor young Ryder's dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      Always before reading the news Mrs. Sarah would glance
      through the casualty lists, not from morbidity of mind, but
      because she had a motherly eye upon so many of the men out
      there, and had had them sitting and laughing upon her red
      cushions. Poor lads! And hardly a day would pass without
      her having to utter that refrain--"Poor So-and-so's been
      killed." She would give her head a kind of defiant shake,
      and look just what she was--a bit of old London and old
      England, a sturdy fighter, no slobbering pacifist. "Damn
      the Germans! Carry on."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a strong and a solid little woman, with a massive
      head well set on a fine throat. She had a bosom. Her glossy
      black hair, without a grey streak in its coiled profusion
      showed the sheen of a great vitality. Her jocund eyes, and
      her broad and humorous nose expressed courage. She enjoyed
      life, and perhaps that was why she understood other lives,
      and the souls of men who were losing their lives out
      yonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother, I'm going out to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah laid the paper on her knees. She knew that when
      Kitty made such an announcement there was a very good
      reason for it. There was nothing flighty or inconsequential
      about Kitty. Her younger daughter was a determined little
      person, very much her mother's daughter, less decorative
      than Corah with her large, dark and slightly languid
      comeliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite so, poppet. Anyone downstairs?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, a boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Officer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Going out for the first time, and feeling rather bad about
      it. And--in a way--so am I."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah said nothing for a moment. Her solid stillness
      was a counterpoise to the sturdy frankness of her daughter.
      They understood each other. But this was unexpectedly
      sudden, especially in Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--you know, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you manage?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Corah will be down in ten minutes. I'll go downstairs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll find him in the divan. His name is St. George. He
      lives in Cardigan Square. I'll go and put on my hat."
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p align="center">

    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah, knowing men as she did, could sum a man up by
      the way he rose from the sofa, and when Alex St. George got
      up rather hurriedly, and stood with a slight stoop of shy
      courtesy, Mrs. Sarah had him catalogued. Having a dignity
      of her own she liked a lad who had breed and good manners,
      and if he were shy so much the better. Bull-headed youth is
      both dull and tiresome. She smiled at Kitty's protégé, and
      held out a hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm Mrs. Greenwood. Kitty has gone to put on a hat."
    </p>
    <p>
      Astonishing situation! But was any situation astonishing
      during the war? Alex met Mrs. Sarah's hand to find its
      grasp firm and reassuring. He was aware of her as a solid
      person in black who smiled, and who appeared to accept his
      presence in the red and white room as the most natural of
      happenings. He had a moment of self-questioning panic. Was
      he making a fool of himself, going out with a girl who was
      a complete stranger, a girl whose mother kept a shop? Would
      not his own mother regard the incident as an alternative to
      too much whisky?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Smoke--if you like--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He too sat down, but on the very edge of the sofa. He
      looked at Mrs. Sarah with his wide, dark eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's awfully good of--Miss--Greenwood--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kitty--is--good," said her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope I'm not--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He found his words arrested by Mrs. Sarah's inevitable
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, you are what we call a gentleman, Mr. St. George. And
      although we keep a shop--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, of course; I--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everything is a little unusual--these days, my dear. The
      thing is not to worry too much."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her. He had a sudden feeling that his panic
      mood of the moment ago had been both caddish and a little
      ridiculous. He liked Mrs. Sarah, and liked her at once, and
      immensely, without being able to say why. Was it her
      solidity? She looked so alive and real and compact. She
      gave you a sense of cohesion and continuity; she made you
      feel that--after all, life was a solid business, full of
      heart and courage; she looked as indestructable as London;
      when she smiled you knew that there must be things worth
      smiling at. Alex was not old enough to explain his
      impression by saying that both Mrs. Sarah and her daughter
      were strong animals, little women of superb vitality who
      could emit from their vigorous entities wholesome and
      potent suggestions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deprecatingly he said: "I think I worry too much."
    </p>
    <p>
      She accepted the statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The way one's made, Mr. St. George. Plum pudding or jelly.
      Don't quarrel with yourself--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jelly! That's good. But so long as the jelly keeps its
      shape--even if it quakes--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly. Here's Kitty. Well, you two young things know how
      to spend the day--I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty looked up at the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dare say we shall find out."
    </p>
    <p>

      As Kitty had said, it was a beautiful day, and they sat on
      a seat in Queen's Walk, and saw the white clouds going over
      the high houses. The lilac buds were turning from gold to
      green, and on the grass the sunlight came and went. The
      windows of the houses would glimmer and grow dark, like
      eyes, smiling or serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it seemed to Alex St. George that the anguish of the
      young year was less greenly poignant, and that the air was
      warmer, and that under this open, April sky the girl beside
      him was even more pleasant to behold. Her very littleness
      appealed to him, her glow, her perfect skin. Yet, though
      physically she was like a ripe and wholesome fruit she was
      more to him than a mere sensuous image.
    </p>
    <p>
      For he was out of love with himself, and when a man is out
      of love with himself his desire to be loved becomes urgent
      and childlike. He wanted to give and to receive devotion.
      He knew now that he had been out of love with himself for
      the last two years, ever since the Somme had begun to
      swallow men, and he had seen other fellows go out, while he
      had accepted safety. He had accepted it too easily, just as
      he had accepted the domination of his mother. Yet, deep
      down in him, there had been inward conflict, repressed, but
      simmering below the surface, awaiting its chance to emerge,
      and when the chance had come he had found himself a
      potential coward. It had shocked him. He had allowed
      himself to be wrapped up in a sense of security. The
      doctors had found him fit, or fit enough to bear a share in
      the last ruthless winnowing. And then fear had come, and
      self-questionings and a dread of his own fear, and a sense
      of shame. What if he failed out there, and found himself a
      martial misfit, a shirker, a rotter?
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wouldn't sit on this seat with me if you knew."
    </p>
    <p>
      But she was sitting there as though it had become the one
      place in the world for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I--must--tell you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt that he had to tell her, to put himself right with
      her, to strip off those years of shame, and now begin anew.
      For he was ashamed of them, though he had been officially
      secure. He had not been able to tell his mother. He had
      begun to be aware of harbouring a vague feeling of
      resentment against his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you listen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm here to listen."
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at her serious and attentive face. She was
      looking up at the houses. He saw the white line of her
      throat, and her firm little chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll despise me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not if you tell me."
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyelids flickered. Why--if he told her--would she think
      differently? Would it make things different--between them?
      And she already had for him a strange nearness--a
      something--
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been serving for more than three years. I wasn't
      supposed to be fit. They didn't send me out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, wasn't that their business?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes--but I ought not to have let myself get stuck at home.
      Coddled and protected. And then when they did push me
      out--I seemed to get panic. And I couldn't tell
      anybody--not even my mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched her face. What a glowing face she had! It was so
      firm and yet so soft. And that honey-coloured hair of hers
      seemed to emit a kind of light from under the brim of her
      little black hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning her head, and looking him straight in the eyes, she
      asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why couldn't you tell your mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why--? O--well, there are some people you don't tell
      things to. But I oughtn't to discuss my mater--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite right. But now that you are going out--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused on the last word, as though prompting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't it--final? When one realizes that a thing has got to
      be--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I want someone to believe in me."
    </p>
    <p>
      She made a little movement as of drawing near to him. She
      understood that he wanted to feel someone near him, or she
      guessed it. They had known each other less than three
      hours, and yet the surprising knowledge had come to her
      that she could care as Kitty--Mrs. Sarah's daughter--might
      be expected to care. It would be a very determined caring.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Supposing someone did believe--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If someone could--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or if you could believe that someone could."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You couldn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You haven't asked me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Impulsively he touched her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you could--I wouldn't mind. You must think me a such
      weak beast--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't. You've had the pluck to tell me this. I suppose
      it cost you something."
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly she stood up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's walk. Walking's good."
    </p>
    <p>
      They wandered across the Green Park. Ten inches shorter
      than young St. George she walked along the middle of the
      path, looking straight before her as though some objective
      had come into view and she meant to reach it. The sunlight
      played upon the fronts of the Piccadilly houses. She knew
      her Green Park and her St. James's, and her Hyde Park as a
      London child knows them, but to-day they seemed both
      smaller and more spacious. The noise of the traffic was
      confusedly impersonal. As for Mr. Alex St. George she was
      aware of him as a shy, freckled, rather loose-limbed boy
      loping along beside her like a dog that had suddenly
      attached itself. She was not at all conscious of him as a
      young man whose mother had a house in Cardigan Square, or
      any difference there might be in their social positions or
      their worldly wealth. He was the eternal boy in trouble,
      her counterpart, her contrast, wilting where she was
      sturdy, yet not without a sensitive courage of his own. She
      was thinking of his mother, and his refusal to discuss his
      mother, his mother who was always so right. So Mrs. St.
      George was that sort of woman! Already Kitty's square
      little chin was setting itself towards an inward
      confronting of Mrs. St. George.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arriving at Hyde Park Corner, they stood by the railings
      while a line of traffic passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's go and look at the Serpentine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes--let's. I used to sail boats there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you wore a sailor suit?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did. Now we can get across."
    </p>
    <p>
      He put out a shepherding arm that curved close to her but
      did not touch her, and on the other side she gave him a
      serious and upward smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are more all right than you think you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No--I'm not. Unless--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unless what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He prevaricated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's get across to the other side of the Row."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unless what?" she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked beyond the trees into the hazy London distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Supposing I can't believe in myself--unless--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Someone else believes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's it. A pretty shameful confession."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But aren't we all more or less like that? Some more, some
      less. How do you like the hat I'm wearing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at her hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems just--the--hat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--that makes me feel good friends with my hat. You
      see?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled down at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say--you are rather extraordinary. You seem to get right
      at things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm older than you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Twenty-four."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So am I."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we'll leave it at that. I have been working for six
      years."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Must you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Must I! I like it. Up at half past six and cooking the
      breakfast. Ours is a cheerful place. How did you like my
      mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Immensely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everybody does. She's a dear. Had a pretty tough fight for
      it--you know, keeping and educating two girls after my
      father died."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was your father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A doctor in the East End. He didn't leave much money. But
      we do pretty well these days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm glad."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was looking at her more and more attentively, and with a
      growing and inward delight that grew out of the misery of
      the last few days like a young plant out of the soil.
      Wasn't she unique; wasn't the whole adventure unique? But
      he did not think of it as an adventure. He had a natural
      seriousness. He was one of those young souls who must look
      up to something or to somebody, a lovable lad, quite
      without side, and still very young. In civil life he would
      be full of enthusiasms for a book, or a play, or a
      landscape, and at this moment in his life his enthusiasm
      had discovered Kitty. She was worth it, but how much worth
      it she was he did not yet know. Nor was he merely a nice
      lad who fell into love and out of it with dreadful
      facility. Chance had brought her to him at a moment when he
      had felt so out of love with himself that his own service
      revolver had suggested a weak way out. In a way she drew
      him as a capable and warm-hearted young nursemaid draws a
      troubled and too-sensitive child.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were standing by the Serpentine, watching the wind and
      the sunlight upon the water, when he asked her a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say--may I call you Kitty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks awfully. And would you let me take you out to
      lunch?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But doesn't your mother expect you back to lunch?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly a clouded look came into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to go back there yet. I want to feel alive."

    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George had neither the magnanimity nor the wisdom
      of a certain good friend of hers who--when an only son got
      himself engaged to a hospital nurse--rang up the girl, "my
      deared" her, and asked her to lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had viewed the war from a distance, and yet she had
      done her duty by the war, short of encouraging her son to
      rush over yonder into the bloody reality of it. In a sense
      she had made the war her own, and allowed it to give
      expression to a number of her prejudices. She had a
      capable, cold head, a passion for putting people and things
      in order, and for keeping them in order; she looked well on
      a platform and could speak with chilly reasonableness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the spirit of her activities was repressive, the
      prevention of this, and the prevention of that. There were
      all sorts of things that she would have liked to repress,
      anything that had the smell of sex, of impulse, of animal
      naturalness. Had she had her way she would have prohibited
      everything that tended to raise life's temperature, the
      whisky distilleries and the breweries, the nightclubs, the
      music-halls, the picture-theatres. She would have made
      Piccadilly Circus as chaste and chilly as the North Pole.
    </p>
    <p>
      On that day in April she returned to No. 77 Cardigan Square
      about half-past twelve. She walked, very properly having
      laid up her car and sent her chauffeur to join the
      Mechanical Transport section of the A.S.C. She had been
      presiding on some committee or other that dealt efficiently
      with the herd's inefficiencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was Mrs. St. George's misfortune. It was not what she
      did, but the way she did it, and why she did it, that put
      her social pies and puddings into cold storage. No doubt
      this fool world would be the better for being ruled by a
      dictatorship of the biological mind, by a wisdom that is
      both kind and ruthless and impartial. Mrs. St. George was
      not impartial. She objected to certain other women giving
      birth to babies--but also she had tried to keep her son at
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      She trod slowly up the three very white steps, and slipped
      her latchkey into the big room door. Cummins met her in the
      hall, a mutely hostile Cummins.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Mr Alex in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George had not seen her son that morning. He had
      breakfasted early and had disappeared. No doubt he had felt
      thoroughly ashamed of himself after the lapse of yesterday,
      and to Mrs. St. George it seemed quite proper that Alex
      should be feeling a little shy of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lunch at one, Cummins."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I expect Mr. Alex back to lunch. The Canteen Committee
      meets here at three."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall use the dining-room. Have the chairs arranged
      round the table."
    </p>
    <p>
      She went upstairs and sat down at her desk. This desk was a
      war product. She was a woman of affairs, and she kept this
      desk and her affairs in perfect order. One recess was full
      of neat little notebooks nicely labelled
      "Canteen"--"Prisoners of War"--"Care of Men on
      Leave"--"Married Women"--"Allowances"--"Vigilance." She had
      some notes to make, and withdrawing one of the little
      books, she opened it and made her entries, and returning it
      to its place in the recess, she sat and looked out of the
      window. Yes, no doubt Alex was feeling seriously ashamed.
      No doubt he would come back and apologize, sit up like a
      good dog, and wave his paws in the air. It was abominable
      that he should have to go out there to France. He really
      was not fit for it. If his own mother did not know that,
      who could know it? But, then, after all, she could
      congratulate herself on the fact that Alex had not got
      mixed up with women or made one of those disastrous war
      marriages. Marriage? O, yes, some day, but she hoped to be
      able to select the girl for him. But--why marriage? Why
      should Alex marry? He was dependent on her. He had left
      Oxford to join the army. He had no profession; he was not
      trained to earn an income. She allowed him five hundred a
      year. She could allow him a thousand. But if he married--?
      Or wanted to marry? And suddenly she drifted off into what
      was for her strange and dubious speculation. She wanted to
      keep Alex under her hand, much as she kept this desk of
      hers. She could not see anything in marriage that could
      make him half so comfortable as he could be in No. 77
      Cardigan Square. She knew quite well that she would try to
      keep him from getting married, just as she had tried to
      keep him in England. He had always been a tractable and
      obedient child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cummins broke her reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is one o'clock, madam. Will you wait for Mr. Alex?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will wait a quarter of an hour, Cummins."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. St. George lunched alone. Obviously, Alex's
      contrition was serious and proper. She did not visualize
      him sitting at a little table in a Soho restaurant,
      opposite a compact little person with a glowing face and
      hair, and serious wise eyes. How could she? How could so
      much happen in one morning? Kitty, the daughter of Mrs.
      Sarah who sold tobacco, cigarettes and cigars, was below
      Mrs. St. George's horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alex's mother presided at her committee meeting, dismissed
      it, and sat down alone to a rationed tea. She was becoming
      slightly annoyed with the persistence of her son's
      penitence, and when, about half past five, she heard the
      front door close, she was in something of the mood of the
      woman who smacks her safely restored lost child just to
      give relief to her feelings. Alex should have returned to
      lunch. She had nicely timed the period that should be
      allowed him for contrition.
    </p>
    <p>
      She listened. She expected him to come up at once to the
      drawing-room, but he did not come. She got up and rang the
      bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that Mr Alex, Cummins?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the dining-room, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not tell Cummins to inform Mr. Alex that his mother
      was upstairs and expecting him. She sat down by the window
      and waited, and Cummins went below. She peeped into the
      dining-room and saw her "Lamb" standing at one of the
      windows overlooking the square. He did not hear her, and
      Cummins softly withdrew. It was possible that Mr. Alex did
      not wish to hear anybody. When she had opened the door to
      him he had walked in with a "Hallo, Cummins," and an air of
      supreme detachment. The pupils of his eyes had shown two
      little blurs of light. And Cummins had seen and wondered.
      She had said nothing, nor flicked the queer exultation from
      that dreaming face with a "Your mother is upstairs, sir.
      She expected you to lunch." No, Cummins had withdrawn
      herself into further wonderings. Mr Alex had come back with
      a strange, new face. Another sort of intoxication but not
      the intoxication of yesterday!
    </p>
    <p>
      Some twenty minutes passed before young St. George went
      upstairs. He hesitated outside the drawing-room door, and
      then suddenly turned the handle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, mater."
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked at each other. His mother received the
      impression that there was something different about him. He
      did not appear contrite; far from it; he looked rather
      happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I expected you to lunch, Alex."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry, mater. I met a friend, and we had lunch out."
    </p>
    <p>
      She waited. She expected him to say something apologetic
      about yesterday, but he did not look apologetic. He stood
      there staring out of the window; his eyes were very bright;
      a smile seemed to flicker about his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was annoyed. One of her favourite ways of opening a
      discussion was by saying--"I'm not an exacting woman." She
      said--"I don't think it was considerate of you--to leave me
      alone like this--especially after what happened yesterday."
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave her a queer, quick look. He had been about to tell
      her something, but now she would not be told. He went
      nearer to the window. His face had grown suddenly and
      strangely stubborn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry, mater, but you didn't understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he walked out of the room, and left her feeling
      icily offended. Not understand? She!

      Kitty returned to No. 7 Vernor Street about half past five.
      She found Corah in charge of the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes--upstairs."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah was having tea. She had waited half an hour for
      Kitty, but when no Kitty had appeared she had sat down to
      read a novel, and eat nut-cake or some abomination that the
      food-shortage had imposed upon the people at home. She was
      not worrying about Kitty. Her daughters were two
      responsible and level-headed young women, each of whom
      owned a latchkey, for Mrs. Sarah contended that if a girl
      was not to be trusted with a latchkey--well--as a mother
      you had somehow failed. Mrs. Sarah did not dwell with the
      suppressionists. She had smacked her daughters well and
      wisely in their early days, and that had sufficed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty came into the room as though nothing had happened,
      and took off her hat, and saw her mother still crumbling
      cake of a dismal and branny dryness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, you poor dear!"
    </p>
    <p>
      For Mrs. Sarah did enjoy sweet things, cream buns, and
      chocolate cakes, and macaroons.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had a good time, poppet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty sat down, and Mrs. Sarah went on crumbling cake. The
      old adage held. Ask no leading questions and you will be
      told no lies, but Mrs. Sarah had improved upon that
      somewhat cynical saying. Smile and don't fuss and the truth
      will come and sit in your lap. Kitty looked just a little
      flushed, and her eyes had a peculiar, bright seriousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had tea, poppet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, we had tea at Rumpelmayer's."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother noticed the "we." Kitty had not been addicted to
      plurals. Always she had shown a preference for the
      independent and satisfying "I."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A nice boy--that. Nice manners."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty got up and stood by the window. She could see Fream's
      Hotel, and the stone spire and the old blackened red walls
      and grey ashlar quoins of St. James's church. The sun was
      striking the gold vane and the stone ball at the top of the
      spire. Half a dozen plane-trees showed a powdering of
      green. How things seemed to change! Or--rather--it was you
      or your mood that changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Mrs. Sarah had finished her dry cake, and had
      laid aside her book. She knew that some things happen very
      suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother," said Kitty, "I don't know yet--but I think--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Serious, poppet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just as serious as it could be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You sudden thing--come and kiss me."

      No war marriage was more singular than Kitty Greenwood's,
      for no marriage was ever more sudden and yet more
      deliberate. She went to it with widely open eyes, and
      consent in each beat of her vigorous little heart. Alex St.
      George needed her. And in loving him she knew that there
      was a need to be assuaged, a fear to be fought, a courage
      to be made whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were married before a Registrar early on the morning
      of Alex St. George's last day in England, and it was wholly
      their own affair, without applause or interference. Mrs.
      St. George knew and suspected nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was life's reply to the suppressionist. Her son came
      and went during those days of his leave; they sat down
      together in the presence of the portraits of the dead St.
      Georges; they appeared the conventional mother and son. For
      two days Mrs. St. George had stood upon her dignity, and
      yet when her son came home to her one night, and with a
      mute gentleness kissed her, she misunderstood his
      gentleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry, mater, about the other night."
    </p>
    <p>
      She mistook gentleness for docility. Alex was out and about
      a good deal, meeting hypothetical friends, but in spite of
      his absences she conceived him to be very much hers, the
      beloved son possessed and dominated. To her he was what she
      wished him to be, and not what he was. She had no knowledge
      of what was passing in his mind, no glimmerings of insight,
      nor did she guess that he had grown older, and could look
      at her almost dispassionately, yet with a young kindness.
      Poor old mater! He had no wish to tell her about Kitty, at
      least not yet, for life was his for the moment, to be
      shared with no one but Kitty, and instinctively he knew
      that his mother would misunderstand it all, and that were
      he to tell her, the romance of those few days would be torn
      to tatters. Nor was it fear that kept him from telling her.
      His insight had been quickened; he was exercising a
      sensitive young restraint; he looked at both these women,
      his mother and his wife, and seemed to realize that during
      those last few days they had to be kept apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the night before the day of their marriage these two
      young people did debate the problem of Mrs. St. George.
      Kitty walked backed with him to Cardigan Square, and they
      wandered round it in darkness. No. 77 was as dark as the
      square, a house muffled up against all mischances, and in
      passing it Kitty had qualms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it quite fair to her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But almost with passion he pleaded for silence. "It's our
      show. You don't know my mother--Kitty. She'd spoil it. And
      to me--it's rather sacred.--I know it sounds ungenerous. In
      a way it's not fair to either of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a way it isn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you'll trust me. I shall write and tell her directly I
      get across. It's not because I'm afraid to tell her now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite sure. I'm so proud of you--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She held his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--I feel that the last hours are mine. I'm not going
      to give them up. I'm not marrying your mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not dwell upon the obvious assumption that she
      would be left behind to face the resentment of a woman who
      was always so right. For there would be resentment. "My son
      has been entangled." Undoubtedly that might be the cry, but
      Kitty did not wish that cry to resound on her marriage
      morning. She shut her lips and squared her chin. She was a
      rather fearless little person.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The moment's mine--ours."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was so sure that he could make it right, but that was
      for the future to decide, and Kitty grasped the present and
      left to-morrow to look to itself. She was both practical
      and very warm hearted. She was both mother and mistress;
      she had come to him as an immense inspiration, and she knew
      it; she suggested, she strengthened, she consoled. She
      would be life and love at his elbow out there in France.
      And he mattered to her very dearly; she made him realize
      it, and in making him realize it she helped him to be a
      man.

    <p>
      It was Mrs. Sarah who--in the face of these sudden
      happenings--displayed the most unexpected of attitudes. One
      mother did not know, and the other refused to know more
      than the essentials, and she had her reasons. As a
      responsible woman Mrs. Sarah might have mounted her
      responsibility, and demanded a proper publicity, but she
      did nothing of the kind. Having formed her own opinion of
      young St. George, and knowing her daughter as she did, she
      refused either to meddle or to advise. There are occasions
      when youth is best left without interference.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning of the particular day Mrs. Sarah kissed her
      daughter, and pushed four five-pound notes into Kitty's
      vanity-bag. Lads are apt to be short of funds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may find that useful. Mind you--my dear--I don't know
      anything about the other side of the picture."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty was trying on a hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean--his mother and No. 77?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly. I have as much right to assume that I'm almost as
      ignorant as she is. It's your affair, and his, poppet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty turned and looked at her mother. Mrs. Sarah was
      smiling, but how much there was behind that smile Kitty
      could guess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a dear. You have loved me all these years, and
      then when I go off like this--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I go on loving you, poppet. I did what you are doing.
      Besides, I'm not losing you all at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll never lose me. You couldn't. You've never tried to
      clutch at us."
    </p>
    <p>
      They held each other close for half a minute. Mrs. Sarah's
      face was all creases, and Kitty's eyes were wet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There--there," said her mother. "You'll know how to spend
      the day. It's his last day, poor lad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are going out into the country."
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Kitty did not fully appreciate the scope of her
      mother's shrewdness, for Mrs. Sarah had looked into
      Debrett, and cast a considering glance at Cardigan Square.
      O, yes, there would be storms. The mildest of women might
      be expected to resent an alliance between Vernor Street and
      Cardigan Square, and young St. George's mother--judging by
      his reservations--was not a mild woman. O, very well! If
      one mother flew to arms, the other mother could be ready
      for her, and able to assert that she--Mrs. Greenwood--had
      had no more to do with the romance than had Mrs. St.
      George. Even less so. Moreover, Mrs. Sarah was not going to
      apologize for Kitty. By no means. The man who was marrying
      Kitty was a damned lucky fellow. Other mothers could sit up
      and take notice. If any favours were being conferred, that
      wholesome and sturdy and lovable young person--her
      daughter--was conferring them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which--as a matter of fact--was true, though none of the
      potential disputants were likely to realize how true it
      was, until other things had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was kind, one of those illusive and sunny days
      inserted into the wet, raw greyness of an English April.
      Married just an hour, they took a train to Dorking, and
      walked out to Wootton Hatch. They lunched there, Kitty in a
      jade-green jumper and a black skirt, her head the colour of
      an autumn lime leaf. Their feet touched under the table,
      and their eyes touched glances above it. Her solid little
      face glowing devoutly contrasted with his freckled and more
      mobile lightness; he smiled much more than she did; her
      very dark eyes, glimmering now and again, were--in the
      main--immensely serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. St. George!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at her ring. Very solemnly in the train and in
      an empty first-class carriage she had kissed that ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what it means to me--you. I have had dozens of men
      silly about me. That's why this is so serious."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dozens!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, don't be afraid. I am as new as this ring. I have never
      cared for anybody before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a soul?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not like this."
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards they wandered up to Leith Hill where the gorse
      was aflame among the pines, and sat on a grass slope below
      the brick tower, and looked out over all that peaceful
      country. Its soft greens melted into a still softer blue;
      the downs were very dim in the distance; the Sussex woods
      black and brown in the pale sunlight. Birds sang.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wouldn't think," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat close to him. There were a few other people there,
      but who cared? Why should one care? His left arm encircled
      her, her hand grasping the strap of his Sam Browne belt.
      His right arm lay across her shoulders, and his fingers
      touched her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been good to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I wanted to, dear lad. When you come back--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was aware of a sudden stillness, a tenseness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When you come back--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She repeated the words with deliberation and conviction,
      gazing steady-eyed at England spread below her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It can't last for ever. Suppose you will go on working?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The mater allows me five hundred a year. Then--there is my
      pay. There's no need, you know--unless--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I like it. Besides--I'm going to help mother--till you
      come back. Besides, haven't you thought--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I've thought. You have made me think. You're so
      splendidly independent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have taught me--tons--in a week. If I come back--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When--you come back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall have to get a job of some kind. A man ought to
      have a job."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He must."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We couldn't live on--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her strong little arm contracted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not for a moment. I wouldn't. I don't mind having to put
      up with things, our own things. We have got to run our own
      show, Alex."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You dear," he said, and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nature of his job, his ability to fill a niche in the
      social scheme of things--lay with the future. It would have
      to be faced, and so would the woman who had a passion for
      bossing people. Kitty had not married Alex St. George for
      his mother's money, and she had no intention of being
      bossed by his mother. No, not for a moment. But Kitty had a
      happy and determined way of putting any future problem away
      in a cupboard and turning the key on it until that
      particular problem had to be taken out and put in the oven.
      She could concentrate on the present. She did not go round
      to-morrow's corner to look for trouble. When she met it she
      would square her chin at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can send you home ten pounds a week--you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You need not send me a farthing unless you want to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I shall want to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then--I'll bank it. It may come in useful later on. I have
      a banking account of my own."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Corah and I have a share in the business. I bank with the
      Midland in Haymarket."
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to think it wonderful that she should have a
      banking account of her own. In fact, everything about his
      young wife was wonderful to Alex St. George. She had such
      sense, such a head on her shoulders, and such a comely head
      and such plump and pretty shoulders. And she understood
      him. By God--how she understood him! How was it?
    </p>
    <p>
      He asked her, and she twisted her fingers into his belt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--I don't know! Directly I saw you--It's caring, I
      suppose. And I'm not exactly a fool."
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way back to Dorking it was agreed between them that
      Alex owed part of his last evening to his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She will be wondering--Kitty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you tell her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing. I just said that I should be out most of the
      day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-way down the steep hill from Wootton Hatch, and under
      the bare boughs of the beeches, he caught his wife suddenly
      and held her close.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kitty--I wish--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She showed more gentleness than passion. Passion exhausts.
      The finer tenderness burns with a steady flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This wax can't last much longer. I'll write to you every
      day."
    </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her, and stood at gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm thinking of to-morrow. You will be at Victoria?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if my mother comes--? Shall I tell her? You two left
      alone on the platform. What do you think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If she comes--tell her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for him the unshadowed delight of the day had passed.
      The dusk seemed to rise about him. She felt his increasing
      silence, a tenderness that was poignant and inarticulate,
      and in an empty carriage of the homeward train they sat
      very close, holding hands. His eyes had that troubled and
      widely open look as he stared out of the window at the
      moving landscape, while she--more and more conscious of his
      young sadness--became more and more maternal and
      protective. She sat with one little fist clenched. That
      creamy face of hers with its glow of colour seemed to
      express an indomitable obstinacy. It was Kitty against the
      world-war, against death, against fear, against everything.
      Her sturdy vitality seemed to sit up and confront fate and
      all fate's possible mischances. She had the look of a very
      determined child, clutching a beloved toy and refusing to
      relinquish it. She squared her chin at the unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      She became wilfully cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have three hundred pounds saved. I don't see why I
      shouldn't be thinking about furniture."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pathetic reality! They clung to it, both of them. They
      began to plan, as though the constructing of that plan gave
      them a little sense of security. It was a sand-castle
      raised by two children on the edge of the thundering deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll get a little flat. I could go on working, Alex,
      while you are making your job."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I couldn't let you do that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not? It will be our show. One thing this war has done,
      it has blown away a lot of humbug."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are perfectly wonderful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But--about our flat?"
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked of it as they walked across St. James's Park
      with the sunset glowing behind them. They might have been
      picking flowers on the edge of a battle-field. Then, the
      houses overshadowed them in the darkening streets, a little
      moan of anguish sounded in the heart of each.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If only it could be now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      No. 7 Vernor Street surprised them. The shutters were up;
      Mrs. Sarah had understanding; she had shut up her house for
      the evening against the khaki crowd. Upstairs supper was
      laid. Alex St. George found himself kissing Mrs. Sarah, and
      feeling a little hot about the eyes. Dark Corah gave him a
      languid, kind hand, and had nothing to say. Kitty had gone
      to take off her hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper and its wilful animation, he found himself
      taking a cheerful leave. Again he kissed Mrs. Sarah--there
      was something comforting in kissing that solid woman--and
      shaking hands with the languid, kind Corah. He and Kitty
      were outside on the landing, and the door was closed. He
      was aware of Mrs. Sarah talking behind that door like a
      sympathetic and smothering orchestra.
    </p>
    <p>
      Husband and wife clung together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want something before I go--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, dear," and her voice was full of soothing consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to see your room. May I? Just for a minute. Where
      you sleep, you know. I'd like to be able to think--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She took him up to her room. It was like herself, small and
      compact and wholesome, with no frills, but smelling of some
      perfume. An oak-framed bed stood behind the door, with a
      blue nightdress-case on the pillow. There were no dresses
      or hats to be seen, nothing but two pairs of little shoes
      placed neatly side by side under the dressing-table. Kitty
      was a tidy person. The blind was down; and she had drawn
      the heavy blue curtains across the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--my darling--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She closed the door, and turned off the light. They lay on
      the bed together, his head against her throat, her arms
      round him. She could feel him trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kitty--I can't--somehow--not now. I feel it wouldn't
      be--Oh, my dear, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      She stroked his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are not selfish, laddie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--yes I am. But I don't want anything
      now--but--just--you--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sometimes it makes one happier to hold back. You have put
      some grit into me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're fine, my dear," she said, "you're fine."
    </p>
    <p>
      So there was no consummation of their marriage in the
      ultimate sense. He gave her something greater by not taking
      when she was ready to give. They just lay close in each
      other's arms, and kissed, and made a passionate, dear
      murmuring, and then suddenly he drew apart and stood up
      and, holding her hand, kissed the ring on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kitty--I'm strong now. I shall--think--of all you have
      done to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      She caught his head in her warm arms and held him so for a
      moment, as though protecting him and praying over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Things will be all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      She went down the stairs with him and out into the street.
      They held hands. She walked as far as the hat shop at the
      corner of Vernor Street, and they stood for a moment under
      an unlighted lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-morrow, Kitty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-morrow."
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      On that last day there was a break in the ice of Mrs. St.
      George's stoicism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alex had gone off soon after breakfast. He had kissed her,
      and there had been something in that kiss of his that had
      troubled her coldness, a secret warmth, a silent--and
      young--compassion. It was as though the youth in him had
      left her with the thought--"Poor mater, she's so frozen up.
      She misses things." For that is one of the puzzles of life,
      how much other people feel, and what they feel, and between
      Mrs. St. George and her son a barrier had always existed.
      Sometimes as a child Alex had wondered about his mother.
      She had been so unplayful. Always he had been more ready to
      run to Cummins--but not in his mother's presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not told her where he was going, and he had not
      turned up at lunch, and his mother had noticed that a cover
      had not been laid for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did Mr. Alex tell you he would be out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      So, he had told Cummins! Was it that he had forgotten to
      tell his mother, or had he not troubled to tell her? It was
      very discourteous of him. And to leave her alone like this
      on his last day. She was coldly offended, wounded,
      perplexed. This secretiveness, this air of independent
      casualness was new in him, or she thought it new, and she
      was angered by it. That was her great misfortune. She was
      one of those congealed women who seem to mistrust all
      emotion, and to slam a door in the face of emotional
      expression, but emotion of some sort is inevitable.
      Suppressed in one direction, it will break out in another,
      and in Clara St. George's case it took the form of anger.
      That was the one flame that seemed to colour her ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      She allowed herself to be angry; anger was the one wine
      that she would drink, and this particular emotion had
      developed a devilish facility. She did not know the
      strength and the fierceness of the creature. For years she
      had had no cause for a live and primitive anger, and like a
      woman who has kept a tame leopard in her house, she played
      with the cat-like, couchant thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her son's last day! And what was he doing with it?
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt that she had every right to be angry, and that
      anger was her misfortune, for anger was her wine, filling
      her with a feeling of flushed rightness. She kept tea
      waiting for half an hour, but no Alex appeared, and she sat
      down at her desk and attempted to write letters. She had a
      moment of suspicion. Could it be possible that there was a
      girl? But--then--what girl? On his previous leaves she had
      not known him particularly interested in any woman, and so
      sure was she of her controlling hands that even at the last
      hour she did not seriously suspect the existence of a
      woman. It was just thoughtlessness, or restlessness, or
      excitement. The war had made people so excitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she waited. And her anger grew chilled. She waited for
      him as she sometimes had waited for his father--frigid,
      accusing, confident. It would never have entered her head
      that it was possible for a mother to be pitied by her son,
      or that Alex would ever come to pity her. Pity and pride
      may be incompatible. She associated pity with
      condescension, and that anyone might stoop to her was
      unthinkable.

    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      About half past six Mrs. St. George heard the ringing of
      the front-door bell. She was sitting in front of the fire
      reading the <i>English Review,</i> she rose, made a
      movement towards the door, turned and resumed her seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cummins let Mr. Alex in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, Cummins."
    </p>
    <p>
      His face had what Cummins described as "A funny hazy look."
      He smiled both at her and beyond her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upstairs, sir. You'll be in to dinner, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      He left his cap and cane and gloves on the hall table, and
      went very slowly up the stairs. It had been a day of
      emotion, and he was in an emotional mood, and very ready to
      be touched by things, and moved by a sudden impulse. He
      loitered on the stairs. It became more obvious to him that
      he had left his mother alone all day, and on his last day.
      Poor old mater!
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly he decided to tell her. It would be ungenerous
      not to tell her, and perhaps she would take it better on
      this last evening. He would blurt it out and get it over.
      He wanted her to share his emotion. For his impulse was
      largely unselfish, a sudden turning to his mother, a
      feeling for her and with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened the drawing-room door, and saw her sitting in
      front of the fire with that blue-covered magazine in her
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry, mater; I'm afraid I'm rather late."
    </p>
    <p>
      She appeared to finish the paragraph that she was reading,
      before she turned her head. She had meant to reproach him.
      She had reproached and chided the unseen son, but when he
      appeared before her in the flesh she suffered from one of
      those sudden and wilful congealings. She froze. She did not
      say any of the things she had intended to say. She became a
      woman of cold and perverse constraints and inept yet
      withering silences.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes--you are a little late."
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved to the hearthrug, and stood there with the
      confession faltering self-consciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Been seeing friends. They kept me."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was coldly furious with him and his friends, but all
      that she said was--"The fire's rather low. Will you put
      some more coal on? Not too much. We have to be careful."
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not see his face go blank--and then become
      stubborn, for she was not looking at him, and he turned and
      bent down, and with a pair of small tongs transferred half
      a dozen lumps of coal from the copper coal-pot to the fire.
      His back expressed a negative blankness. His eyes had a
      closed-up look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The week has gone very quickly. I've ordered a taxi from
      Prout's place."
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother's nostrils quivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, very quickly. Cummins knows about breakfast."
    </p>
    <p>
      He replaced the tongs and stood up, but kept his back
      towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No need for you to bother, mater, unless--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She said very decisively--"I shall be down to breakfast."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I meant--the station."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall not come to the station."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes--much better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think one can leave that."
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not say to whom Victoria Station should be left,
      but her tone implied it, and her son caught the
      implication. One left Victoria Station to the crowd, to
      common women, to the crudely emotional, to people who were
      not ashamed of kissing and hugging, to poor little
      snivelling girls. And he felt both hot and cold, for to him
      that place full of the wide-eyed woe of women and the
      cheerfulness of stiff-faced men meant Kitty, Kitty who
      could clasp your head in her arms, and make you feel prayed
      over and protected.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--damn," he thought, "I wish--"
    </p>
    <p>
      But what did he wish? That his mother was the kind of woman
      who could be left on that station platform holding Kitty's
      hand? How simple and human and right that would seem. But
      Kitty, Mrs. Sarah's daughter, Mrs. Sarah who kept a tobacco
      shop in Vernor Street, though she was a doctor's widow! How
      right that shop might appear to him, and how wrong it might
      appear to his mother!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I would rather you saw me off here, mater."
    </p>
    <p>
      She answered with a slight and consenting movement of the
      head. She had gone back to consider that other possibility.
      Could there be a girl?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Men prefer it--our men."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, quite so," he said; "makes one feel rather a fool. I
      asked Cummins to pack for me. There is only my valise. I
      expect she has done it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ring and see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No--I'll go and look."
    </p>
    <p>
      Left alone for five minutes she sat and stared at the fire.
      Should she go to the station? Did he wish to keep her from
      going to the station? For if he did she would go. Yet she
      could not believe in the existence of a love affair, for
      she was sure that he would have told her about it. She
      believed that he had always told her everything. It was a
      mother's right to know everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came back more at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite all right. I shall only have to put my slacks in and
      roll it up last thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood looking down at the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll write directly I get across, mater."
    </p>

      At six o'clock next morning it was raining. Mrs. St. George
      was down before her son, and Cummins unexpectedly wept over
      the bacon and eggs as she was placing the silver
      chafing-dish on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George looked at her sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cummins, don't be hysterical."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an inarticulate and unhappy meal, and to Alex the
      taxi appeared as a vehicle of escape. Standing at the
      window he saw the rain glistening on the black roof of the
      Cab, and the plane-trees and the lilacs all wet, and he
      thought of yesterday, and the sunlight on that English
      landscape. How far away yesterday seemed, and Leith Hill,
      and the pearl-grey downs.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother did not go with him to the front door. He had a
      last glimpse of her standing between the breakfast-table
      and the fireplace, watching him with those very blue eyes
      of hers that seemed to him to be for some unknown reason
      strangely stern. Her heart-burn was a resentful emotion,
      penetrated by an inarticulate anger against happenings over
      which she had no control.
    </p>
    <p>
      She remained there motionless, until the taxi had driven
      away. She did not go to the window. She heard Cummins close
      the front door. She realized that Cummins was making moist
      sounds in the hall. "O, my lamb, we'll never see you
      again--perhaps." And Mrs. St. George went out to her with a
      face of sudden fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be an hysterical fool, woman."
    </p>

    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the April rain Alex St. George was carried towards
      Kitty. She was waiting for him there outside the
      booking-office, wearing the jade-green jumper and the
      little black hat of yesterday. Her right hand grasped the
      handle of a wet umbrella.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no holding back about Kitty. When he got out of
      the taxi she put her arms up round his neck and took and
      gave kisses. Who cared? This English railway station was a
      human place.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kitty," he said, and that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt desolate and he felt happy. When he had reserved a
      seat in the Pullman-car, they stood together on the crowded
      platform, contemplating each other, all eyes, but blind to
      all else. Scores of other men and women were equally blind.
      They saw nothing--perhaps--but one face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll write every day," said she. "I--know--you will be all
      right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall. Have you got that photo?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She had it in her little bag, and she gave it to him, and
      he tucked it away in a breast-pocket of his tunic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're there, Kitty. It makes me feel good."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes had a burning solemnity, but they were tearless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take your seats," came the cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      They clung together for a moment. He scrambled in, and
      hurried to his window. He managed to smile. She stood there
      with a white, grave face, sturdy and small, looking at him
      intently. The train moved off, and her white face seemed to
      glide away, those solemn and intent eyes smiling slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      St. George sat back in his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, damn," he thought, "I wish--"
    </p>
    <p>
      The train was full of such inarticulate wishes.

      When Mrs. Sarah was not busy in the shop, her favourite
      place was a chair by one of the sitting-room windows, and
      from this window she could see the blackened redness of St.
      James's church, and the grey spire rising above the
      plane-trees. Across the way the windows of Fream's Hotel
      confronted her, lavish with white paint and old-rose
      curtains, and shadowy comings and goings. The window-sill
      being a low one Mrs. Sarah had a good view of Vernor
      Street, and the passing of the khaki caps, bowlers,
      "Trilbys" and cloth caps. Vernor Street was a male
      thoroughfare, and Mrs. Sarah had discovered the essential
      sameness of the male. They were calculable creatures. To a
      gossip who had exclaimed--"Oh, all men are awful!" she had
      replied--"All men are--just--men, only some of them are
      more so."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a comfortable woman. She did not expect a man to be
      a hero, or a little St. Paul, or a devoted husband and
      father, or an infallible fool. She knew man to be a
      creature of patches, and she preferred him not to be a
      humbug. She liked a good dinner, and did not deny it, and a
      well-grilled chop, and asparagus, and chocolates, and a
      good-looking boy or girl, and fine manners that are fine
      because they are gracious and kind, and a well-brushed
      top-hat, and clothes that come out of Savile Row. If the
      Prince of Wales was to be seen anywhere, she made a point
      of seeing him. "The dear!" She had liked young Alex St.
      George. He, too, was a boy who could blush.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Alex was in France--Kitty had had two letters from him,
      and Mrs. Sarah was waiting for Cardigan Square to send up
      some signal, though it might be a storm-cone that would be
      hoisted. Yes, that was quite probable. But if Mrs. St.
      George was a woman of good temper as well as of good
      family, Vernor Street and Cardigan Square might avoid
      vulgarity, though warmth was hardly to be expected. So Mrs.
      Sarah sat and waited. Mrs. St. George should be allowed the
      first move; it was her privilege; it might be a gracious
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my dear, I think it will be up to her. And she's a
      gentlewoman."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty, being younger and more concerned than her mother,
      was a little less patient. It was given her to wonder about
      Alex's mother, and her attitude towards the shadowy Mrs.
      St. George was human and practical. She was quite ready to
      be friends with Alex's mother; in fact--she was ready to
      respond to a more formal gesture, for Alex's sake, for her
      own sake, for everybody's sake. Rows are destructive and
      unbusinesslike, and Kitty was a businesslike little person.
      But condescension would not be welcomed. She would allow
      Mrs. St. George a mother's reluctance, but if there was any
      magnanimity in Alex's mother, Kitty would make the most of
      that magnanimity. She had seen a photo of Mrs. St.
      George--Alex had shown it to her--and the portrait had left
      Kitty with the impression of compact, firm-lipped
      strong-mindedness. Still--strong-mindedness had its
      virtues; you should know where you stood with a woman who
      knew her own mind. But would any woman know her own
      mind--or know it impartially--on such an occasion?
    </p>
    <p>
      It so happened that Kitty did get a glimpse of Mrs. St.
      George in the flesh before there had been any parley
      between Vernor Street and Cardigan Square. Kitty, the young
      wife, going to look at the house where her young husband
      had lived, saw Mrs. St. George come out and descend the
      steps of No. 77. And Kitty stood and watched her walk away,
      and found in Mrs. St. George's method of progression no
      promise of Mrs. St. George's being a "Stooping Lady." Not
      at all. Kitty described it to herself as the progress of a
      very dignified woman walking in a procession. Yes, and at
      the head of it. The upper part of the figure moved with a
      kind of rigid gliding motion, as though carried along on
      invisible wheels. She held herself stiff as a post.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty mentioned the coincidence to Mrs. Sarah.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There doesn't look much bend about her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure it--was--the lady, poppet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--yes--I saw her face. Just like her photo. She makes a
      good picture."
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mrs. Sarah loved that room above the shop, Kitty loved
      it also. It might contain a lot of shabby furniture, but
      its associations were by no means shabby. It associated
      itself with comings back from school, and buttered toast
      and muffins, and a tuffet on the hearthrug in front of a
      blazing fire, and Mrs. Sarah's happy way with people. There
      was not a piece of furniture in the room that was not an
      old friend, from the mahogany sideboard, with its two
      cupboards, to the immense old sofa covered in green
      cretonne. The room had a white and woolly hearthrug that
      was shaken out of the window at an hour when Vernor Street
      was empty of headgear. The carpet was a rose-coloured
      Axminster, somewhat worn, in the doorway. The sofa held a
      number of cushions, red, blue, and black. There were two
      upholstered basket chairs that creaked when Mrs. Sarah sat
      down in them. The girls preferred the sofa or the
      hearthrug, and Kitty's favourite perch in winter was the
      plum-coloured tuffet in front of the fire. Her sturdy
      little back did not appear to need adventitious proppings.
      Corah, taller by seven inches, and dark and willowy, liked
      to curl up in a corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      This room was home, detached from the shop and the divan,
      and very rarely did a man ascend to it. The Greenwoods were
      clannish, and this sitting-room was their castle in the
      highlands. The three women of the sitting-room were not the
      women of the divan and the shop; there was the downstairs
      face and the upstairs face. Men have to be both humoured
      and kept in order.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a black and gold cash-box kept in the top right-hand
      drawer of her chest of drawers, and concealed under a green
      scarf and a handkerchief sachet, Kitty had locked away five
      letters from her husband. Five letters in six days,
      addressed to Mrs. Alex St. George, c/o Mrs. Greenwood, 7
      Vernor Street, S.W. And such letters! She was not a
      sentimental young woman; she asked for more than sentiment,
      and Alex's letters gave her the realities. He wrote to her
      as he had talked, as though they were sitting on a seat in
      Queen's Walk or lying on the turf of Leith Hill. He was in
      love with her as she wanted to be loved. He depended on
      her. Standing no higher than his shoulder, she was yet a
      compact, human buttress.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wrote fairly cheerfully, and the first two letters came
      from a base camp. Later he wrote that he had been posted to
      a battalion of the--Division. He was going up to join his
      unit; they were in the line somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told her that she had given him back his self-respect
      and his courage. He called her his "Beloved," and she bent
      a grave little head over his letters, reading them over
      again before she switched off the light at night. They
      reposed under her pillow, to be locked away in the morning.
      She took her gold ring very seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the crowd of officer boys she was Kitty no longer, but
      Mrs. Alex St. George. She had no snobbery. She was mated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third letter had contained a significant piece of news.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wrote to my mother yesterday. I told her everything, how
      fine you have been to me. I asked her to go and see you at
      once, or to ask you to see her--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He sounded so confident. He was realizing the nearness of
      death, and seemed to think that the people at home would
      realize as he did, and be uplifted. But did he realize how
      shocked Cardigan Square might be? Kitty realized it; she
      was neither anxious nor eager; she remained upon the alert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George might find herself in a difficult
      situation, but Kitty was ready to give her a fair field.
      Mrs. St. George had only to behave like a gentlewoman. And
      she should have no cause to regret it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty felt that she owed something to Alex's mother. She
      did owe something. She was the young and the unexpected
      wife in possession.

      Sons who tell their mothers everything a week too late can
      count on provoking maternal exasperation. Granted that
      youth can be very exasperating, and that Mrs. St. George
      was not an average mother, and that Alex told his tale with
      sentimental and frank ruthlessness. For nothing can be more
      ruthless than the young male, especially when it writes
      letters under the stress of strong emotion, and writes them
      to a woman who has no facility for experiencing any sort of
      emotion save that of anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George was more than angry; she was shocked; she
      was furious. And her anger was her misfortune. At this
      moment in her life when so much depended upon a magnanimous
      self-restraint, she allowed herself to become a kind of
      Brünhilde of a woman. This one strong vital emotion, kept
      like an animal in a cage, and allowed out upon proper
      occasions to administer a pat of the paw to a servant or a
      shopman, broke out beyond control. She made no attempt to
      control it. She let her one wild beast of an emotion go. It
      ceased to be a dignified emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deceit of the thing!
    </p>
    <p>
      Never having been a woman who could regard life as a
      romantic affair, and having no warmth of compassion in her
      that could help to temper her condemnation of romance as
      mere sex foolishness, she felt immediately right with her
      anger. She allowed it to distort and colour the whole
      affair. She got it at once into her obstinate, cold head
      that Alex had been ambuscaded. He had been ashamed to tell
      her. Of course he had been ashamed to tell her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a shopgirl! O, this abominable war! It uncovered all
      the rawness of life, and reduced gentlemen to the level of
      shopgirls. And she had been congratulating herself on the
      fact that Alex had been spared one of these war
      entanglements. A shopgirl! Had Mrs. St. George been able to
      use the word "woman" she would have been so much nearer to
      understanding the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      She raged. She assumed at once that her son had been
      trapped by cheap people, these Greenwoods, tobacconists.
      Anger itself is apt to be a cheap and sordid emotion, and
      in Mrs. St. George there should have been a heritage of
      self-restraint, and of cold, wise graciousness. She should
      have behaved like a gentlewoman, and she didn't. She
      behaved like a common woman, but without any of the common
      woman's redeemings and excuses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole thing was vulgar and abominable. It was the old
      tragi-comedy. Her son had been made to compromise himself,
      and then had been hustled into marriage. Not so mad--of
      course;--from the Greenwood point of view. A nice piece of
      speculation, or rather--the acquiring of gilt-edged
      securities. What a sordid business! And her son! And he
      could sit down and write to her a fool's letter full of
      crude sentiment. "I want you to be kind to Kitty."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George rang up Prout's garage, and ordered a taxi.
      Yes, she would go and see these people.

    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George discharged her taxi at the upper end of
      Vernor Street. She had not walked down Vernor Street for
      some twenty years, and the last time had been when she and
      Alex's father--up from the country--had stayed for a week
      at Fream's Hotel. Some of the male St. Georges still put up
      at "Fream's," which had a reputation of its own, and was
      both new and old fashioned. Mrs. St. George walked down
      Vernor Street on the same side as "Fream's," and when she
      came level with the two bay-trees in their green tubs, she
      saw her "shop" over the way. S. Greenwood, Cigar Merchant.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tobacconist's! The very place in which you would expect
      an entanglement to be staged. And as Mrs. St. George paused
      outside Fream's Hotel, a couple of laughing officer boys
      came out of Mrs. Sarah's shop. One of them waved a hand. So
      that was the sort of place it was, promising something
      fluffy and interesting behind the counter, a fly-paper of a
      shop. Mrs. St. George--in her anger--allowed her prejudices
      to jump at every conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      She crossed the road. Being a gentlewoman she was able to
      carry her anger as a gentleman should carry his liquor. She
      entered the shop, and both shop and divan happened to be
      empty. Corah was behind the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Greenwood--I think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Corah observed her with shrewdness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Greenwood lives here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm Miss Greenwood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Kitty Greenwood?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No--that's my sister. But her name is St. George.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I have heard. I am Mrs. St. George."

      Corah might be dusky and languid, but she was no fool. It
      was impossible for a daughter of Mrs. Sarah's to be a fool.
      She had discussed possible happenings with her mother, and
      she smiled, and came round from behind the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alex's mother. I'm so glad."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George stared. This elder Greenwood girl had what
      Mrs. St. George called "a good appearance"; and she was
      neither embarrassed nor too polite.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's your sister whom I wish to see."
    </p>
    <p>
      Corah's smile died away, but her placidity remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid that Kitty is out for the moment, but she will
      be back any minute. My mother is upstairs. I know that she
      will be glad to see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes--I think that I had better see your mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      She pivoted slowly, surveying the shop. Her blue glance
      penetrated to the divan. Red cushions? Ah, of course! Red
      cushions! Exactly! And then, a Major-General in a hurry,
      entering with elderly cheer, fractured that icy silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--Corah--my dear--a box of 'Green Howards'."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at the lady, and he looked at Miss Greenwood,
      catching the frost from them, he stood very stiffly waiting
      for his cigarettes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Put them down to me--please."
    </p>
    <p>
      He departed, and Corah spoke to Mrs. St. George, but
      without looking at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "General Charteris is an old friend of ours. Now, will you
      come upstairs, please?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George was silent, but her silence
      answered--"I--quite--understand."
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Contrasts both attack and repel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah, standing there with her face all pleasant
      crinkles as she smiled, and her black eyes very bright, met
      the crisis and Mrs. St. George with impartial solidity. It
      is probable that she was instantly aware of a clashing of
      contrasts. She knew at once that she was not going to like
      Mrs. St. George any more than Mrs. St. George was going to
      like Mrs. Sarah. It was ice and fire, air and water, cold
      blood and warm blood, white meat and red. No two women
      could have been more different, and more antipathetic, and
      Mrs. Sarah, realizing an intuitive dislike, suppressed that
      most dangerous feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please sit down."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George moved to the sofa. She was very deliberate.
      She had taken stock of Mrs. Sarah, as a stoutish, short,
      broad-faced woman with a sleek black head, a bosom, and a
      humorous and rather spreading nose. Yes, rather a
      coarse-fibred person, but, like the daughter
      downstairs--betraying no embarrassment. Mrs. St. George had
      expected it to be otherwise, and to find these people
      saucily on the defensive, or eager to please. She was in a
      hurry with her prejudices, but behind these prejudices--and
      whipping them forward--was her anger wielding a scourge.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause, a significant pause, like a deep drawing
      of the breath after a plunge into cold water. Mrs. Sarah,
      taking one of the arm-chairs, was very conscious of the
      chilliness of the atmosphere, and of the peculiar bright
      blueness of Mrs. St. George's eyes. And that mouth, and
      those regular and cold features, and the polished tip of
      that narrow nose! Mrs. Sarah knew the type. It had hands
      that clutched. It was morality personified.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Sarah continued to smile, and that was to her
      advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said--"Are we to congratulate each other?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her way of beginning was unexpected. She began with humour,
      and a touch of roguishness, as a woman of the world might
      be expected to open such a discussion. She saw a momentary
      stare of surprise in the blue eyes. Obviously, Mrs. St.
      George had not expected such a question. And what did it
      suggest--familiarity, an impertinent and challenging
      friendliness, irony, stupidity?
    </p>
    <p>
      She replied with another question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you mind telling me how long my son and your
      daughter had known each other--? You see--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah sat with folded hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--about a week--I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George appeared to respond with a slight movement
      of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I expected. Do you mind--if I am perfectly frank with
      you--Mrs. Greenwood?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As mother to mother!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you care to put it that way. Obviously--my son--who is
      very young--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The same age as my daughter--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But--then--I may observe--that a girl of twenty-four--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I agree. My daughter manages her own affairs--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And this affair--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah made a little grimace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are we--going to say--such things to each other? Wouldn't
      it be better--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw Mrs. St. George's lips retract slightly in a smile
      that was not a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had no desire to stress the obvious. My son--was not
      frank with me. The first time--Naturally, one was moved to
      infer--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes--one is. I quite understand. But--as a matter of fact,
      Mrs. St. George--I might have interfered, and I did not.
      Please wait a moment. I happen to be rather fond of my
      daughter. She's got a lot of character. No--she's not--what
      you might infer. Appearances--I keep a shop. I do pretty
      well. My girls have been well educated. We respect
      ourselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked straight at Mrs. St. George with a kind of
      imperturbable good humour, and Mrs. St. George looked out
      of the window. She had met the unexpected. She was up
      against a solidity, a common sense, a humorous wisdom that
      met and restricted her prejudices. She was more angry than
      ever, and her anger was being baulked. She was having to
      repress it in the presence of this stout and smirking
      person who seemed to assume an attitude of rightness. And
      Mrs. St. George had lived with the impression that her own
      rightness was the only rightness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said--"But isn't a mother bound to consider--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah took her up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. It's my daughter and your son. My daughter
      works for her living. I should like to know--whether your
      son--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      They crossed glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My son hasn't a penny."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You misunderstand me. The question is--can he earn a
      living? If you are looking at it as a business
      proposition--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George thought she saw an unguarded flank.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's inconceivable. I am a woman of property. Let us be
      perfectly frank. The property is mine for life. If I choose
      to allow my son--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't we ignore the property? You see, Mrs. St. George,
      you don't know my daughter. She's rather an independent
      little person. She didn't marry your son--for an allowance.
      Believe me--that's true. She married him because she wanted
      to, and because he wanted her to. That's the human bedrock.
      I don't know that I am so pleased about it as I might be.
      But--we mothers--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused. She had put the hot metal of the supreme test
      into Mrs. St. George's hand. Were they going to be mothers
      in the gracious, human sense, or were they going to spit at
      each other like a couple of cats on a wall? The decision
      was with Mrs. St. George. She had but to make a magnanimous
      gesture, and Mrs. Sarah would reply to that gesture. She
      was not expecting Mrs. St. George to be pleased about the
      marriage, or to pretend that she was pleased, but only to
      make the best of it, and behave like a woman of sense. She
      was ready to allow Cardigan Square its prejudices; she had
      a respect for all that Cardigan Square was supposed to
      stand for, but Vernor Street was not without its
      traditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      She waited. While sitting on the sofa Mrs. St. George had
      pulled off her gloves, and Mrs. Sarah saw that she was
      proposing to put them on again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you would like to see Kitty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Mrs. St. George, still looking out of the window,
      let her anger get the better of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it--necessary?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She had done the unpardonable thing. She had sneered. She
      had let her venom escape, and Mrs. Sarah, with all the
      douceness and patience and good humour gone from her face,
      got up from her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes--it is necessary. I insist on your seeing my
      daughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      She went to the door, opened it, and closed it with a kind
      of restrained emphasis. Mrs. St. George heard her
      calling--"Kitty--I want you."
    </p>

    <p>
      Insistence! A closed door!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George put on one glove, and rising from Mrs.
      Sarah's sofa, went and stood at one of the windows. Yes,
      she supposed that she had better see the girl, and get it
      over. For a thoroughly intolerant woman the situation was
      sufficiently exasperating. Nor had Vernor Street behaved as
      she had expected it to behave, or allowed itself to be
      overrun by the wheels of her chariot. Mrs. St. George might
      be a very angry woman, but she was somewhat a woman of the
      world, and a part of her had to admit that this stout and
      coarse-fibred person had behaved
      better--than--O--well--better than she had wished her to
      behave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, dignity--dignity! Though she did allow herself
      some curiosity as to the face and the figure and the manner
      of her daughter-in-law. She did not think of Alex's wife as
      a daughter-in-law, but as an interloper, an adventuress, a
      little mess of sexual interference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, she had sneered. But was she not justified in feeling
      bitter? She stood at the window looking towards the
      plane-trees and the church, but all that she saw was a plan
      in ruins, the carefully cherished authority of the mother
      challenged by a young woman who served in a shop. She
      looked out past Vernor Street--and beyond Cardigan Square.
      She was thinking of Melfont St. George's let to an American
      for fourteen years, of her ruthless economics, of her
      wiping out of the debts of her son's father. The lease of
      Melfont had another two years to run, and she had seen
      herself returning there with Alex. Her anger felt a sob in
      its throat. She saw the green valley, the fish-ponds, the
      park full of old trees, the house with its white portico,
      the high woods behind it and sheltering it from the north.
      She saw it as a stately place with shining water. Its
      dignity was dear to her, the dignity of its old walled
      gardens and yew hedges, its peacocks, its lawns, its
      ancient trees. She seemed to hear the cupola clock striking
      the hour, the wings of the white pigeons beating the air,
      and the discordant cries of the peacocks. And she realized
      that she was standing above a tobacco shop, and that her
      son had married a girl who belonged to the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      How impossible!
    </p>
    <p>
      But what was she going to do about it? Shrug her shoulders
      and accept the situation? Allow the nice schemings of
      twenty years to be reduced to ridicule? Could she see
      herself living at Melfont with a little common creature as
      her son's wife? Surrender? Compromise? But why should she?
      These people had captured her son, but Alex was still her
      son. Had she not to think of his future? If--he survived--?
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood twisting her glove. In her cold, fierce way she
      suffered, but not with resignation. No, she would fight.
      She had every right to fight, ruthlessly, and with every
      weapon, for her son's sake, for the sake of his future--his
      future as she had planned it. This abominable war, with its
      shocks and interferences!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, she would see the girl. That woman had been right in
      insisting upon it. No doubt the girl was impossible, and
      there was a part of Mrs. St. George that was eager to
      magnify the impossible. She was shaping her attitude. She
      would refuse to compromise, and the more impossible her
      son's wife should be, the more right would her attitude of
      no compromise appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Money! She controlled the purse. These people were
      commercialists, though Mrs. Sarah might protest that they
      were not. They had thought her son was good value, but if
      one altered the ticket from fifty guineas to twopence
      half-penny would not that broad-nosed woman with the bosom
      and the smile appreciate the difference? Also--her
      daughter? Value indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Alex, he was only a boy. He had fallen to a moment's
      infatuation, a war excitement, a sex spasm that would be
      bitterly regretted. A year hence--if he lived--he would be
      seeing his shopgirl as a shopgirl, a cheap thing, and
      boring because of its essential cheapness. He would be
      saying to her--"Mother, I was mad."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, she would not assist his madness. She would make a
      stand for his sanity, for the inevitable reaction. Had not
      the war taught one the virtues of ruthlessness?
    </p>
    <p>
      But what a long time that girl was in appearing! Mrs. St.
      George glanced at the black marble clock on the mantelpiece
      and realized that she had been left alone in the room for
      more than a quarter of an hour. Well, the debt was
      accumulating. She felt that she had herself under control.
      She sat down on the sofa, feeling more and more determined
      to leave these Greenwood people no illusions.
    </p>
    <p>
      She supposed that her son's wife was dressing herself up
      for the interview, inside and out. As if it mattered!
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      II
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour before Mrs. Sarah's closing of that door Kitty
      had been sitting on a seat in Queen's Walk where she and
      Alex had sat on the morning of their entering into each
      other's lives. She had had a letter from him, and she had
      taken it out with her into the open air, away from all
      stuffiness, for it was a letter through which reality blew.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kitty--I'm afraid--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her heart answered that cry. He had poured out the truth to
      her in that letter, and yet it was by no means a
      contemptible letter, but in its way very touching and
      rather fine. He was afraid--most damnably afraid, and yet
      he was able to love and to laugh. She fastened upon that
      note of humour, and pondered it. "If you had seen me do a
      dive into a shell-hole right on top of a few poor beggars
      who had managed to get hold of a 'dixie' of tea. I upset
      the dixie and the precious tea. They were awfully decent
      about it. I had a packet of cigarettes, and I passed them
      out." He said that the men were awfully decent. There was
      fear--of course--underneath, but not the sort of fear he
      had expected. Faces were stiff. "And the chaps--my
      fellow-officers--do their jobs. That is what gets me,
      Kitty. It's humiliating and it's splendid. I may be in a
      devil of a funk, but I am managing to carry on. I think my
      chief terror is--the fear of letting myself and other
      people down." She nodded her head over this. If he were
      feeling like that he would go on feeling in the right way.
      She did not want him to write like a humbug. Wives should
      know, and be able to help. And she was helping--"You are
      here--always, most vividly so. Do you remember your putting
      your arms round my head? Well--when the shelling is rather
      bad I have a feeling that your arms are over my head." That
      made her eyes deepen, and her fists clench themselves
      firmly. She was protecting him, yes, the sensitive,
      lovable, frightened, striving boy in him. Nor was he wholly
      and selfishly introspective. "I suppose one ought not to
      tell you a lot of this. I ought to pretend--But it does
      help me so, Kitty. Don't think me a craven little beast.
      You have been so good to me. It helps. I can shove my head
      against a sandbag, and feel--It helps to be believed in. I
      suppose it's because I believe in you--so utterly. One
      must--you know. It's splendid when you can--"
    </p>
    <p>
      No, she had no fault to find with that letter. It went
      right to her heart and to her head. It made her feel deep
      and good and sad and yet strangely happy. It made her feel
      that she wanted to fling herself to him out yonder in brave
      and burning words. Upsetting that tea, and handing out his
      cigarettes, and seeing the pathos and the humour of it! O,
      he was all right; he was made of human stuff, and she loved
      him. Heavens, how she loved him! with her square head and
      her stout heart.

    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty stood in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry I have kept you waiting."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George remained on the sofa, for with Kitty had
      entered another unexpectedness, a voice and a face and a
      figure other than Mrs. St. George had foreseen. She had
      been waiting for a second Corah, a tall young person,
      smart, good looking, and self-assured, and she found
      herself regarding this little bunch of a girl. For that was
      the descriptive phrase that came into Mrs. St. George's
      mind, a bunch of a girl, a little, square, dumpty thing
      with amber-coloured head, and two very dark eyes staring at
      you out of a round, fruit like face. Mrs. St. George was
      surprised, puzzled and antagonized. What--in the name of
      Eros--had Alex seen in this little, undistinguished
      creature?
    </p>
    <p>
      She said--"You did not expect me. I thought it best to see
      you. I do not wish there to be any misunderstanding."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure there need not be."
    </p>
    <p>
      She came forward into the room, reminding Alex's mother of
      a stubborn, bright-eyed child who was not in awe of
      anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you mean what I mean, Mrs. St. George."
    </p>
    <p>
      She took off her hat and placed it on the table. She had
      Alex's last letter screwed up in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O! That's a pity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That may be a question of one's point of view."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. One sees what one wants to see. And I
      know--that it must seem--rather sudden."
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down in one of the arm-chairs. She appeared quite
      frank and unembarrassed, and only concerned with the
      marriage as her marriage. She reminded Mrs. St. George of
      the mother, but Kitty did not smile. She had an air of
      immense seriousness. Was this another form of adroitness?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly--most sudden. But it was not so much the
      haste--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She would have said "unseemly haste." And how immovably the
      girl sat and stared!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--we hadn't much time--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the deceit--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was quite ready for you to be told."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed! Do you suggest--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not suggesting anything. Alex didn't want you to be
      told--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't that rather suggestive? He was ashamed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty's dark eyes seemed to flicker momentarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shouldn't have said that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I do say it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I'll tell you--why Alex did not want you to be told.
      He did not want our last days spoiled. I should not have
      said that--if you had not used that word--"
    </p>
    <p>
      They exchanged stares. And Mrs. St. George was unpleasantly
      aware of the fact that the daughter was being no more
      apologetic than the mother had been. And Kitty had dealt
      her a blow, and she would carry the bruise for many days.
      But it was this little sturdy creature's air of rightness--
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid that explanation--does not convince me. Isn't
      it obvious--that you were in such a hurry--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty got up and went and sat on the window-sill. The one
      obvious thing to her was that Mrs. St. George was a very
      unpleasant woman in a very unpleasant temper. Prejudiced!
      Yes, stiff with prejudice and resentment. Kitty had been
      ready to allow her some resentment, but not the production
      of insults.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you say these things--it is not going to make it
      easier."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George found a smile, and such a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did I lead you to infer--? Surely not. I came here to make
      it plain--that--on no conditions--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--I see," said Kitty, grave as fate. "Well, it's a pity.
      I'm your son's wife. I married him because I was in love
      with him. That's the long and short of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was her philosophy, and Mrs. St. George began to
      insinuate a hand into a very crumpled glove. The solemnity
      of the child! A little, persistent, and plausible creature,
      speaking of Alex with a possessive familiarity; and every
      time that Kitty had spoken of Alex Mrs. St. George had felt
      an inward and cold shudder as though Kitty had
      mispronounced her son's name.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid it is--as you say--the long and short of it. I
      thought it right to see you--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you tell me--? Did you make up your mind--before you
      came here--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George tried irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can imagine a mother--who has been lied to--as quite
      unprejudiced."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are not being fair to me, Mrs. St. George. I am trying
      to be fair to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Fair--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an ironical upward glance of the blue eyes, but
      Kitty was busy with Alex's letter, smoothing it out on her
      knee. She said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait--please. I do mean something to your son. You don't
      believe it. I'll show you something I wouldn't show to
      anybody else, his last letter. Please read it."
    </p>
    <p>
      She crossed the room, but since Mrs. St. George did not put
      out a hand, she slid the letter into her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps it will help you to understand. I'll leave you
      alone to read it."
    </p>
    <p>
      So, Kitty went upstairs and sat on her bed. She wondered
      what Mrs. St. George would make of that letter. Certainly,
      it might hurt her a little, but surely if she had any heart
      in her at all, if she cared as she ought to care, she would
      try and be fair. But did Alex's mother want to be fair? And
      Kitty's fists were clenched under her chin. She felt that
      she would know Mrs. St. George by the way she reacted to
      that letter. It was Kitty's judgment of Solomon.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of ten minutes she returned to the sitting-room.
      The letter was lying on the table. Mrs. St. George stood by
      the window with her back to the door, and it seemed to
      Kitty that her long back had an uncompromising
      straightness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned, and her face was quite expressionless. It
      suggested nothing but a dead, white glare.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry. Please understand--that for my son's sake I
      can't recognize this marriage."
    </p>
    <p>
      She passed Kitty and went towards the door, and Kitty let
      her go. She was saying to herself that Mrs. St. George was
      a bad woman, as bad as she could be.

    <p>
      It was the letter of her son's to his young wife that had
      made Clara St. George ruthlessly conscious of herself as a
      very much wronged woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her ruthlessness was the trouble. Kitty, in giving her that
      letter to read, had given her her woman's opportunity, a
      humiliating and difficult opportunity no doubt, but to
      humble herself and ask herself questions was not Clara St.
      George's way. She accepted the insult. That little, dumpty,
      honey-headed thing had not only stolen her son, but she had
      gone out of her way to prove how thoroughly she had stolen
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      That letter! All--"Kitty--Kitty," and protecting arms and
      sentimental rhetoric--and not a word about his mother in
      it. The ingratitude of men, their crass sex blindness!
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked. She walked at a great pace, gliding along like
      the bust of a pale and outraged Juno carried in a State
      festival. She found herself in Hyde Park. It was a
      beautiful spring day, but she felt like winter, ruthless,
      hurrying to shrivel all succulent green growth. She sat
      down for a while by the Serpentine, and hated every live
      thing that moved in the sunshine, the ducks, the children,
      the impudent and assertive sparrows. Those Greenwood people
      were like London sparrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      For undoubtedly she had lost her son, and she raged over
      it. She did not ask herself why she had lost him, and had
      she asked herself that question her answer would have been
      prejudiced and wilful. Alex was like his father. All these
      years she had laboured to efface the father in the son, to
      impose the mother on him, and in one short week he had
      recapitulated all those irresponsible characteristics. He
      had come home drunk, he had got himself into a legalized
      mess with a girl, and he was writing her cowardly,
      emotional letters. Fear! A St. George afraid, and saying
      so--to the daughter of a woman who kept a shop!
      Crying--"Kitty--Kitty"--when he should have been
      crying--"Mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah--there was the wound, but she would not let it bleed.
      Not she! She covered it with clean linen and ice. She set
      her teeth. She would fight for her son and get him back;
      and how she did it she did not care. To have to humiliate
      herself by competing with a girl like that, a little common
      thing, a little bit of buttered egg on toast! Abominable!
      But was not this consciousness of outrage in her favour? It
      absolved her from all compunction. She could treat these
      Greenwoods as they deserved to be treated, meet adroitness
      with subtlety, use the knife on the knots they had tied.
      She had every right to be ruthless, maternally ruthless.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked home. She let herself into No. 77. Cummins met
      her with a confiding face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a letter, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was lying on the hall table. She picked it up, and
      passing by Cummins like a north wind, she went upstairs to
      the drawing-room and read that letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It made her feel worse. He wrote about Kitty. "For my sake,
      mater dear, I know you will like her. She's so
      understanding and plucky--"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as though he had dashed icy water over her bosom.
      She caught her breath. She reached for the telephone on her
      desk, and rang up the exchange.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Put me on to No. 1999--Central."
    </p>
    <p>
      She waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo. Is that Mr. Furnival's? This is Mrs. St. George
      speaking, Cardigan Square. Is Mr. Furnival in? What? Gone
      out to lunch. I want to see him very particularly this
      afternoon. Busy? But he must see me. He can expect me at
      half-past two. Write it down. Mrs. St. George will call at
      half-past two. Very well."
    </p>
    <p>
      She hung up the receiver.
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p align="center">

    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Furnival smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, very well, Carter; I'll see her at two-thirty."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a man who had spent a great part of his life trying to
      save people from making fools of themselves, or in
      preventing them from quarrelling, he had retained a
      surprisingly sanguine outlook upon men and things. He knew
      that it was not the law that many of his clients needed,
      but logic with a flavour of human kindness. People were so
      quick at getting up on their hind-legs, and a great part of
      Mr. Furnival's time had gone in getting them down
      again--with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down at his untidy desk. He filled a pipe; he dared
      to and did smoke in his office. He had to smoke, otherwise
      the business of life would overwhelm him; he made himself
      smoke and go slow. He was one of those city fathers of
      1918, with two junior partners and three clerks away at the
      war, and his rooms full of eager but haphazard women, and
      his wife still weeping her eyes out for a boy who had been
      killed three months ago. Like Mr. Britling--John Furnival
      was seeing it through. His hair was a little greyer, his
      pink face a shade more blue, his finger-nails not quite so
      meticulously cared for. There were times when he had
      tobacco ash on his waistcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, damn the woman--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Why did she want to bother him when he was up to the eyes
      in worries, his own and other people's? He was very
      familiar with Mrs. St. George and her affairs. A woman who
      was always in trouble about nothing, she came and demanded
      advice and then went home and did the very thing you had
      advised her not to do, generally because it was the thing
      that she wanted to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another squabble with that fellow down at Melfont."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he supposed it was that, and he left it at that. He
      grabbed some papers, and rang a bell, and began dictating
      letters to a girl clerk, puffing at his pipe and
      thinking--behind it all--that he did wish poor Mary could
      get to sleep without tears. Yet there were occasions when
      his own blue eyes would look a little blurred and heavy.
      Poor lad! Blown to bits at nineteen! Well, anyway, the boy
      could not have known much about it. And yet the fact that
      Dick had not suffered seemed to be no consolation to his
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      But--how--could it be? What a lot of kind and
      self-humbugging rot one talked!
    </p>
    <p>
      At twenty minutes past two he put out his pipe, and asked
      the girl clerk to open the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For my sins--I must smoke, Miss Jones."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why shouldn't you, sir?" said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew that Clara St. George would be punctual. She was.
      Personally he preferred the sort of woman who was not so
      heartlessly true to time. She came into his private room
      like a still, white squall that would not allow itself to
      break. As usual, she glanced a little despairingly at his
      untidy desk. Could a man with so poor a love of order be
      considered wholly efficient? He guessed that she could
      smell stale tobacco smoke. She was not a woman to be
      propitiated by an open window.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had risen from his chair. His freshness had a slightly
      shrunken look, like that of a ruddy apple that has been
      stored in a dry place, but Mrs. St. George did not observe
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall keep you an hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear lady--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "An hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced half-whimsically towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No disturbance until I ring, Carter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sank slowly into his chair, turning up his coat-tails.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--nothing very serious--I hope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She flung the news--so to speak--on his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alex has married a shopgirl."
    </p>
    <p>
      By Jove, so it was as serious as that! Knowing Clara St.
      George as he did he realized how mercilessly serious it
      must be to her. He could find her both freezing and raging
      on the other side of his desk. She was dignity--the supreme
      maternal ego--outraged.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said--"My dear lady, these things will happen. Tell me
      about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      She told him. She was both cynical and ruthless.
    </p>
    <p>
      She painted it all in black and white, with a touch of red
      splashed in when she spoke of Mrs. Sarah. Impossible
      people, adventuresses--and worse. A tobacco shop that was
      probably a war-brothel. Full of red cushions and young
      animals in khaki. And two flashy girls, and an old fat,
      smirking procuress of a mother. Alex had been trapped.
      There had been concealment, collusion. He had not told her,
      no--not till he had reached France. He had been ashamed to
      tell her. Obviously. And now he was trying to pretend--
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Furnival listened, and watched her, and jotted down a
      few notes, and examined his finger-nails.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trying to make the best of it--is he."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had to break in somewhere, make head against the
      north-east wind of her declaiming.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The best of it--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew herself up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--one has to sometimes."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was finding her a little more exasperating than usual,
      and life was not quite so mellow as it had been before the
      war. He was overworked and inclined to be irritable. He
      found himself thinking of her as a woman who had a live
      son, while poor Mary--his wife--But this would not do. He
      had a duty even to the most exacting of clients.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something must be done--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if the marriage is legal--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't question its legality. Those women are
      sufficiently clever."
    </p>
    <p>
      Not for a moment did Mr. Furnival believe that these
      Greenwood people were all that she declared them to be, for
      when a woman is in a rage--especially a woman like Mrs. St.
      George, you halve her statements and still discover
      exaggeration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want this marriage annulled."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, my dear lady, it can't be done. Besides, there are
      other points of view--Alex's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "His present point of view. O, no doubt. But, you see, one
      can alter that."
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled like a frosty morning, and Mr. Furnival felt
      that he ought to turn up his collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me exactly what you mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can cut off his allowance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, I shouldn't do that," and there was feeling in his
      voice. "Besides--would it be fair--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can alter his point of view--with regard to this girl.
      At present--he thinks her--Isn't it obvious--that when he
      realizes that she is shop--soiled--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Furnival sat up in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are going to suggest that to him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But--my dear lady--consider--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall do what is right. I have seen these people. I
      shall have the house watched."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had drawn off her gloves and laid them neatly folded in
      her lap, and at this point it occurred to Mr. Fnrnival to
      ask her why--exactly--she had come to him, and what she
      expected him to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      She replied at once: "I want it arranged."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't lawyers do such things--or arrange for them to be
      done?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered her with some sharpness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt. But I won't. I will go and see these people if
      you like--with a perfectly open mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him a glare of scorn. Of what use was a lawyer
      with an open mind? He did not seem to appreciate her point
      of view, the mother's point of view. She laid great
      emphasis upon the mother's point of view.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As a man of the world--do you realize--how impossible this
      marriage is--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may seem impossible, but it appears to be a fact."
    </p>
    <p>
      She talked on and over him. She drew a picture of Alex two
      years hence, a disillusioned Alex, bored with this little
      dumpty creature, an Alex who would, in fact, be Alexander
      St. George, Esq., of Melfont St. George in the county of
      Dorset. The St. Georges were "county." How could you expect
      a tobacconist's daughter to share such a position, and to
      rise to it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Patiently, he put before her a view of the situation as it
      was or appeared to be, and not as she wished it to be. Why
      not try and make the best of it?--for by making the best of
      it you might avoid the worst. Though he was shrewd enough
      to realize--before the hour had passed--that Clara St.
      George did not want to make the best of it. She wanted her
      son.
    </p>
    <p>
      He descended to platitudes, conscious of all the business
      that he had to get through before dinner-time. "Think it
      over. Don't be in a hurry. One regrets haste. If you
      like--I will go and see these people." No, she did not
      think that was necessary. She had not much use for a man
      with an open mind. Moreover, he had become aware of a
      gradual silence, and a reflecting look upon her face, as
      though she had emptied herself of words. He knew quite well
      that he had not convinced her, and that she would go away
      and do the thing she intended to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pushed back his chair, and she rose.

    <p>
      "This has been a very great shock to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the lift she repeated to herself those last words of
      his. "Of course!" She stepped out of the lift and walked
      quickly away, down the steps, and out into a crowded
      street. Her face and eyes had an icy sheen. "Of course."
      Why had she not seen it before in that way? She had been
      too-much upset. It was not the marriage that she must
      attack, but her son's faith in the girl he had married. The
      marriage could remain provided that Alex was brought to
      feel that he could not and would not live with his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He would be both married and not married. He would be hers.
      No other woman could interfere. All that she had to do was
      to destroy his affection for and his faith in Kitty.

      She sat down and wrote to her son.
    </p> 
    <blockquote>
      "MY DEAR BOY--<br>
      <br>
      "I don't think you can have realized what a shock this news
      would be to me.<br>
      <br>
      "Why did you not tell me before it happened? Was it quite
      fair of you not to tell me? I think I have felt the
      concealment, the lack of confidence, more than anything
      else.<br>
      <br>
      "Let us be quite honest with one another. Just at present I
      am so perplexed--so troubled--that I cannot bring myself to
      any decision--I mean--whether to be glad or sorry--<i>for
      your sake.</i> I am thinking of you all the time, Alex, of
      your future, and all that is best--for your future.<br>
      <br>
      "I called on the Greenwoods--with a perfectly open mind. I
      must say that I was a little astonished by the attitude
      they have adopted. They met me with hostility. The girl
      seems very young. The mother, well--I'm afraid Mrs.
      Greenwood annoyed me by the way she spoke of you. I admit
      that I came away saying that I could not recognize the
      marriage.<br>
      <br>
      "I think--under the circumstances--that this was the only
      dignified attitude that I could adopt. I adopted it for
      your sake as well as for my own. I think Mrs. Greenwood and
      her daughter ought to realize how finely and honourably you
      have behaved. At present I don't think they quite realize
      it as they should. I suppose a girl who lives so much in
      the atmosphere--of young men home on leave--may have a
      rather flattering idea--of herself--<br>
      <br>
      "No--I am not bitter. But I must ask you--Alex--to give me
      time. I am your mother. I feel most terribly responsible; I
      have a conscience. I am not a woman who is easily
      convinced, but I must be convinced--one way or the
      other--before I can make up my mind.<br>
      <br>
      "Remember, my dear boy, that you are the only son I have.
      God guard you and keep you--"
    </blockquote> 
    <p>
      It was a good letter, adroitly sincere, and yet containing
      its little drop of poison. "The atmosphere of young men
      home on leave." She posted it, and sat down to wait, and
      Alex, reading two letters in a little red-tiled Flanders'
      bedroom, was at pains to reconcile them. On the whole he
      had to confess that the mater had taken the news rather
      well.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Kitty's letter--it puzzled him a little. She said so
      much less about his mother than she might have said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid she is dreadfully upset about it, dear. And
      yet I can understand. It is so difficult for a mother to
      realize that a girl can care--as I care. Let us leave it
      there--at present. I care--and you care, and that is all
      that should matter. If you hadn't a penny I should care
      just the same."
    </p>
    <p>
      He could look out of the window at a Flemish orchard in
      bloom. The grass was green. Somewhere, in the far
      distance--there was a rumbling.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt troubled, a little depressed. Surely two women who
      could write two such letters were not going to quarrel
      about him when he was in the thick of the most devastating
      quarrel the world had known? No doubt it was hard for his
      mother to realize--Moreover, a fellow had to confess that
      the mater had an autocratic way with her. She may have made
      Vernor Street feel a little on its dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Kitty having a swollen head--that was nonsense.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would write a perfectly frank letter to his mother, and
      try to make her understand what Kitty was to him. Surely,
      it would only be a question of time, and of two people
      knowing each other a little better? You might expect a
      little ice to begin with, and his mother could not be
      described as an impulsive woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he did feel a little chilled. That grass looked so
      coldly green. And the apple blossom was beautiful,
      poignantly beautiful. And those damned guns kept hammering
      away over yonder!
    </p>
    <p>

      IV
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Furnival belonged to a club in St. James's Street, and
      he confessed that as the war dragged on his affection for
      that corner of the City of Westminster grew more deep and
      old-mannish. So many things had been lost to him in the
      war: friends, his son, that sense of security that is so
      precious to a man who has passed his fiftieth year, and
      faith in the essential betterment of progress. Mr. Furnival
      had kept his pink cheeks, but his beliefs and opinions were
      paler than they were. He was conscious of flux, change, a
      surge of newness that was very raw and strange.
      Therefore--perhaps--he loved clubland the better. What
      consoling names! Whites, Almacks, the Bath, the Carlton,
      the solid old Reform. You walked along Pall Mall, and
      entered into some place of pleasant and spacious security.
      You felt England round you, your own particular England.
      You sat intimately in some familiar chair, and saw the
      sunlight on London plane-trees. Cool, calm solidity, like
      that of Cornish caves on a still day, admitting the blue
      sea, but changelessly. The fruit was very raw on the trees
      these days, and Mr. Furnival hated raw fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young St. George's marriage--for instance! But ought one to
      let one's teeth be set on edge by such rawness? Ought not
      one to remain mellow, yes, in spite of the sugar shortage?
      Vernor Street was not very far away, and Mr. Furnival,
      smoking a cigar, and watching the white head of one of the
      old club-servants, felt moved towards Vernor Street. Why
      not call there, not as Mrs. St. George's lawyer, but as her
      son's friend? Hang it all, he had known the boy in an Eton
      suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      For life was still coloured for him by the spilt blood of
      his son, and though the decade's mood might be a very raw
      one, Mr. Furnival cherished his compassion. He felt more
      kindly towards Clara St. George's son, and towards all the
      lads out yonder, and towards all young things. He was not
      suffering, like many men on the wrong side of fifty, from
      an attack of renewed youth which could make him jealous of
      these young men. He was profoundly touched and troubled by
      his wife's tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, he put on an irreproachable top-hat, and a pair of
      wash-leather gloves, and left his club for Vernor Street.
      It may be that Mrs. Sarah was not wholly unknown to him--at
      least by reputation. He found her in her shop; it was the
      slack time of the day; the war was still at its lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised his hat to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Greenwood, I believe?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah smiled at him. She liked an English face such as
      Mr. Furnival's, and especially so under that glossy hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I'm Mrs. Greenwood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My name's Furnival. I'm an old friend of Alex St.
      George's."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah continued to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And of Mrs. St. George's?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. I don't think I can call myself a friend of Mrs. St.
      George's. I have not attained--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must be rather like climbing Mont Blanc, Mr. Furnival."
    </p>
    <p>
      They understood each other from the first. They were two
      Londoners, two very English souls, and for ten minutes Mr.
      Furnival sat on one of the red cushions, and was
      conscious--while sitting on it--of Mrs. St. George's utter
      lack of the sense of humour. Mrs. Sarah sat on another red
      cushion, effacing it completely under the solidity of her
      skirts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are going to have trouble," said Mr. Furnival. "As a
      friend of Alex's--and as one who happens to know--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah thanked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This may be Canaan to you, Mr. Furnival."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all. I may be inquisitive, but I am not a spy.
      Quarrelling is such a waste of time and energy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's more than that. It's a pity. If Mrs. St. George could
      see it like that--without seeing red! As it happens, I am
      rather proud of my girls. If a young fellow like Alex gets
      a girl who is good and wholesome and healthy, with a head
      on her shoulders and a pretty one at that--what--in the
      name of the Prophet--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Furnival said: "Exactly. My boy was killed three months
      ago. That rather cramps the fussiness of one's social
      style. I would very much like to meet Alex's wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I--Mr. Furnival--would like you to meet her."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was taken upstairs. He was introduced to Kitty. He sat
      on a chair, holding his hat and gloves, while Mrs. Sarah
      returned to the shop, but presently he had put his hat and
      gloves on the table, and was lighting a cigarette. And
      Kitty sat there rather like a solemn child, talking to him
      very seriously about Alex. She understood Alex from
      cap-badge to field-boots, and Mr. Furnival began to realize
      why it was that she understood him as she did.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had come with an open mind; he went away with a
      prejudiced one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After all," he thought, "it ought to be humanly possible
      to make the best--of that."
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty sometimes wondered whether any woman had put on
      record how women felt during the war, not as men expected
      them to feel, but as they did feel. So much of it--of
      course--was just playing up to your particular man, as she
      was playing up to Alex, because he needed it, and needed it
      more than most men did. Moreover, there were men, hordes of
      them, whom no woman was required to pity, men who had got
      back into fine, elemental happenings, and who never before
      had felt so male, however much they might grouse or play
      for pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the whole she was moved to pity the women more than the
      men, that is to say the women to whom the war mattered.
      There were many to whom it did not matter a damn.
      They--too--had their excitements. Nor did Kitty pity
      herself, though she lived--so to speak--at the end of a
      telephone wire, one ear turned Francewards while the other
      ear was carrying on.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were times when you could hardly believe that the war
      was happening, yes--even after nearly four years of it. You
      got out of bed with the sun shining, and dressed yourself,
      and came down to the orderly details of an orderly day. You
      dusted things, and sat down to breakfast, and saw the sun
      shining, and heard the coming and going in the street. The
      day seemed so normal. And suddenly the war would get you.
      Perhaps you would hear the morning paper thrown down with a
      flop on the shop floor by some casual and indispensable
      urchin. Or the thought would rush into your mind--"Will
      there be a letter to-day?" And if there was no letter? You
      felt a little more restless and strung up; you seemed to be
      listening for something. You found yourself a little
      sharper in the tongue, and were suddenly sorry for it. If
      there had been an air raid in the night you made a point of
      shrugging your shoulders. Perhaps you remarked that it was
      worse for the fellows over there. But was it? Kitty had her
      doubts. Her feeling of suspense was not an uncomplicated
      emotion. It was like a three-headed beast crouching in a
      dark corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was afraid of Alex's death, afraid of his fear, and
      afraid--in a way--of his mother, though she would not have
      described her waiting upon Mrs. St. George's silence as
      fear. It worried her. What was the woman going to do? They
      had not seen her again, or heard from her, and the only
      hintings she received came to Kitty in one or two of Alex's
      letters. Mrs. St. George was very much upset; his mother
      was a woman who took things very seriously; it was a
      question of time. Would Kitty be patient? He knew that it
      was asking a great deal of her--but for his sake--Mothers
      were mothers. He said--and she believed him--that he felt a
      little ashamed of having to write as he did. It was
      humiliating; but she was not to feel about it in that way.
      She was the finest little woman on God's earth, and when he
      came home on leave everything would be put right. He needed
      her more than ever, her, and her only.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, that was what mattered. But she took herself and life
      much more seriously than she, had done as Kitty Greenwood.
      She was Mrs. Alexander St. George, with a young husband at
      the front, and a non-conforming mother-in-law somewhere in
      the background, but it was the vagueness of this background
      that troubled Kitty very considerably. Being a sturdy and
      somewhat practical person she liked to know where she was.
      Dramatic and bothering situations were very well on the
      stage, but in real life--no. None the less, she refused to
      be rattled. She remembered the essentials. She kept her
      eyes on the one human figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      He needed her; he needed her letters, and
      never--perhaps--did any man at the front receive more
      humanly comforting and wise little letters. If she let
      herself go there was her sturdy, common-sense self at the
      back of it. At home she escaped into practical interests,
      wholesome daily activities. She wore her heart much deeper.
      She talked less to the young men, and more to the older
      ones. She was kinder to them all, but with the kindness of
      a little matron. Sometimes she would catch some elderly and
      responsible warrior looking at her with a whimsical but
      wise twinkle. She took herself as a married woman very
      seriously, and to a certain type of old boy--the best type
      of old boy--her seriousness was very charming.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a lucky young beggar--your son-in-law," said one of
      them, who had become a man after ceasing to be a snob.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah agreed with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a pity his mother doesn't think so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doesn't she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. But she'll regret it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope so. After all--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You need not apologize for her," said Mrs. Sarah. "I often
      wonder if Balaam apologized to his ass. Did he? I forget.
      Kitty's worth a whole cartload of anything that Mrs. St.
      George could produce. She's my daughter, and I ought to
      know. Besides, I'm no pauper."
    </p>
    <p>
      She wasn't. Some people happened to know what her turnover
      was in the Vernor Street shop, also that she had invested
      some three thousand pounds in War Loan. Her girls had their
      own banking accounts. She had brought them up on figures,
      figures with a personal rotundity and significance. She
      could remember Kitty at the age of seventeen, lying flat on
      the hearthrug, with her little cash-box, and an account
      book, and a stumpy pencil.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose some people would call us profiteers. Let 'em.
      We give value."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear," said one of her gossips, "Vernor Street will
      have helped us to win the war. Encouraged our moral, you
      know. Lots of poor devils have felt better for sitting on
      your cushions and being smiled at."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have tried to smile."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's it. A flip of cheerfulness. Any woman can go and
      look solemn in a committee-room. And you don't advertise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--that's my theory. Some one has to carry on. I could
      have put my girls into munition works or the V.A.D. They
      have had their choice. They preferred to stay with me and
      carry on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good business," said her gossip. "I'm not worried about
      the war. I'm worried about what's going to happen after the
      war."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said Mrs. Sarah, "that's it. I suppose half the world
      will be a little bit drunk for the next ten years.
      Swollen-headed. It will be the plain people who carried on
      who will do the carrying on. Apply the ice--you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat solidly on her chair. She invested in War Loan, but
      she invested in other things as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When the hero-stunt is finished--we shall all have to get
      back to our figures. Profit and loss, my dear. Half the
      world will be wanting something for nothing or I'm no
      prophet. But you can't run a business on those lines, nor
      marriage, nor an Empire, nor a cat's home. We shall see."
    </p>
    <p>
      She kept her eyes and her ears open, and so did Kitty. The
      way to make money is to be in the know; also, to be able to
      see round the corner. Men who were supposed to know were
      found to be chatting in Mrs. Sarah's divan, and it was from
      overhearing two such authorities gossiping about money
      matters that Kitty took to speculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Buy 'Cobbolds'; buy every shred of 'Cobbolds' you can lay
      your hands on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something in it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's bound to boom when the war's over. I happen to
      know--You see--I'm--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty pondered those words. She know the prophet to be a
      man of some substance, but she discussed both the prophet
      and the prophecy with her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's your opinion of Major Drysdale?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what way, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As a business man--a man who might be expected to know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pretty sound man--I should say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I heard him advising Colonel Howard to buy 'Cobbolds'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Cobbolds?' 'Cobbolds.' Let's see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Silk aren't they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah patted her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait a bit--wait a bit. Skirts going up. Every little
      flapper--Stockings. Something in it. Of course--"
    </p>
    <p>
      That is how Kitty came to buy "Cobbolds." She bought £300
      worth of Ordinary Shares, at a market price of 16<i>s</i>.
      <i>6d.</i> a share. Mrs. Sarah put in five hundred, Corah
      an odd hundred or so. If Major Drysdale was in the know,
      well--why not make use of his knowingness? He was not the
      sort of man to advise a brother officer to buy a pup. Kitty
      deposited the stock certificate with her bankers. She did
      not foresee the fact that those shares were going to be
      somebody's salvation a year or more hence.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if she could be adventurously practical, she could be
      just as active in the matter of sentiment, though she did
      not think of it as sentiment when she trained down to
      Dorking nearly every Saturday and trudged out to Leith
      Hill. Sitting on a turf slope and looking southwards over
      all that rolling country with its marching woods and
      stippling of trees she felt herself as physically near to
      Alex as she could be. He was over yonder, beyond those dim
      downs and the sea, a little live figure somewhere in that
      brown multitude of men. Her man. She would sit and stare,
      and feel and think. Sometimes the sky was clear, or white
      winged, or overcast, but it was full of the great question,
      the question that so many women were asking the unknown:
      Will he come back? Kitty wanted her man to come back; the
      whole of her wanted him. There were other women who
      secretly hoped that some man might not come back. The war
      might be a liberator as well as a tyrant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile it was June, and she hung suspended between two
      points of the unknown. Her two wires stretched from
      somewhere in France and from No. 77 Cardigan Square.
      Cardigan Square had remained unpleasantly silent,
      unpleasantly so because of Kitty's summing up of Mrs. St.
      George as a bad woman, in that she was hard and suspicious
      and unmovable. A woman with a frozen backbone. Kitty had
      been prepared for a certain amount of rigidity; she had
      been ready to allow Mrs. St. George the stiffness, her
      prejudices; Cardigan Square could not help itself any more
      than Vernor Street could help itself, and Kitty had been
      ready to help Alex's mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      And since Mrs. St. George's silence had continued, Kitty
      had begun to stiffen herself in response to Clara St.
      George's rigidity. Her sturdiness was prepared to
      resist--though what exactly she might have to resist she
      did not know. Actually she appeared to be the young woman
      in possession, therefore--if Mrs. St. George contemplated
      aggression, it would develop into an attempt to evict the
      young woman in possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how?
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Mrs. St. George was rationalizing her motives
      and the actions that were to spring from them. Badness, as
      Kitty understood it, may be nothing more than a person's
      power of self-persuasion, her knack of dressing up her
      particular devil in a white surplice, and sending it out
      upon a sacred quest. The end justified the means. That
      Clara St. George was able to become a fanatic in her
      attempt to reconvert and recover her son was no more
      unnatural than the eating of a breakfast. Good women can be
      ruthless. Prejudices become principles. We all try to do
      what we want to do, and some try more successfully and more
      remorselessly than others. Religion may assist the egoist,
      that fine, cold sense of rightness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George had made up her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wanted her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty was a bad woman, an ingenious little honey-pot, the
      daughter of that fleshly person Mrs. Sarah. Therefore Kitty
      could be treated as a bad woman, without compunction, and
      without consideration. The greedy little shopgirl must be
      made to disgorge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alex had to be liberated. That was obvious. But how
      complete the liberation was to be might depend upon how
      much liberation would assist the mother in recovering
      control of her son. She used the moralities with an a-moral
      mind. The moralities and her prejudices seemed to coincide,
      which was useful. She was going to try and destroy her
      son's faith in his wife because she--Mrs. St. George--had
      convinced herself that Kitty must be a wanton. Having made
      that assumption and translated it into fact, she realized
      that she had to impose that assumption upon Alex. She had
      to prove to her son that his wife was no better than she
      ought to be, and had been in that state when he had married
      her. Having pulled his marriage down about his ears and
      extracted him from the ruins, she would then be able to
      consider the possible reconstruction--as she wanted things
      reconstructed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not seen again by Mr. Furnival. The obstacle of the
      open mind was circumvented. She visited instead a certain
      firm of solicitors who were experts in the handling of such
      delicate and indelicate matters. She interviewed the senior
      partner, a florid, bald-headed, genial person who had an
      excellent digestion, a nice taste in wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My son has contracted a mésalliance."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Test, of Test &amp; Crabtree, preferred simpler
      language.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Got himself into a mess. Exactly. And you want him out of
      it. What's the woman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A shopgirl in a tobacco shop frequented by officers. A
      place with a lounge and red cushions. You can infer--most
      probably--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Red cushions!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His geniality increased.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dubious, eh? Flashy. And you have good reason to
      believe--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have every reason to believe that my son was imposed
      upon and trapped. But I want evidence, convincing
      evidence--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Evidence that is convincing to you, Mrs. St. George?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Evidence that will be convincing to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      He understood her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I to understand that action will be taken?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course--my son--when he realizes--what the girl is--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Blandly, he pointed out that the investigation was being
      inspired by a third party, which might be a little unusual
      and dangerous. Vernor Street might react. The responsible
      and interested person was Mrs. St. George's son. Even sons
      did not always approve of interference.
    </p>
    <p>
      She replied with one of her blue glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I consider myself responsible for my son. I have a right
      to be interested. Surely it is possible to have discreet
      investigations instituted, to collect evidence--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He waggled his eyeglass at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Possible--yes. With discretion. Without alarming anybody.
      Is that the idea?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So--that you might have--a nice little dossier ready--in
      case--But by the way--what is--if I may ask--your present
      attitude towards your son?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have told him my mind is open, but that at present he
      must allow me time to reflect--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have not recognized the marriage?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your son believes--that you are thinking it over."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And these Greenwood people?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The women are not fools."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean--they expect hostility?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I imagine so. But I am giving them no provocation, no
      hint."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see. You remain in the background, ostensibly to decide
      whether--for your son's sake--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly. One should be deliberate--I think. One does not
      want to give the impression of haste, or of anger, or of
      prejudice. I want my son to understand that I have taken my
      time, that I have been thorough and deliberate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So much more convincing--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly. I shall be able to say--'I wanted to be sure,
      before I opened your eyes.' That is why--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I quite understand," said Mr. Test.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      So, in her letters to her son, she behaved herself with
      careful self-restraint and discretion. Almost, she made it
      appear that the marriage had not happened, or if it had
      happened she was still keeping it judicially poised between
      heaven and hell. She dropped no poison. She wanted to
      possess his confidence before she began to administer her
      poison in carefully measured doses that could be adroitly
      increased. She had to remember that if Vernor Street were
      forewarned it might prepare an antidote.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wrote to Alex every day. She sent him parcels, books,
      magazines. She was the devoted and unchanging mother. That
      he was in danger, that he was no more hers than the
      mischances of the war might allow, seemed to have the
      effect of stiffening her secret ruthlessness. The less she
      had, the more firmly did her grip tighten upon what she
      had. She looked at life as a woman might look out of her
      window on a frosty day, to see everything covered with
      rime, and the brown leaves glued to the grass, and the soil
      caked in the beds about drooping wallflowers. She was the
      sort of woman who would have thrown out crumbs to the
      birds, not because she loved birds, but just for the sense
      of power that it gave her. Never once did she attempt or
      contrive to put herself into her son's place or to see life
      with his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shrank from contact with raw emotion, drew in her
      skirts. She had never known fear, and could not understand
      it in her son. In fact--she was sceptical about fear. It
      was an emotional state, a part of that emotionalism that
      had hurried him into this marriage, and no doubt the girl
      had used all the emotions and played upon them. Protecting
      arms--indeed! Her nostrils would grow a little pinched. She
      preferred the use of the word "neurotic." She shut up Eros
      in a cupboard. She was the firm, cold, capable nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wrote other letters to all the various St. Georges and
      Smythes. She gave them the news with dignity and
      discrimination. "Poor dear Alex had committed a deplorable
      blunder. But of course--this war--! No one is normal." She
      hinted--that if her son was spared to her--she hoped to see
      him recover his normality when the war was over. The
      further implications she did not discuss, but they could be
      inferred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jermyn St. George, who hated her, chortled considerably
      over the news. He had loved his brother and had resented
      his sister-in-law's attitude of rightness. Poor old Charlie
      had never had a chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great. Young Alex seems to be getting some back for his
      father. I hope that girl has the right stuff in her."
    </p>
    <p>
      He replied with ironical robustness to Clara's letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no quarrel with new blood, if it is warm and
      wholesome. Let me know if anything babyish is expected.
      I'll offer myself as god-father."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jermyn had always been a person with the mentality of a
      Georgian squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he wrote to Alex and congratulated him, and was given
      an address in Vernor Street. He visited Vernor Street when
      he happened to be in town. He kissed Kitty. He would have
      kissed Mrs. Sarah. He was delighted with Mrs. Sarah. "By
      Jove, that's a woman!"

    </p>
    <p>
      When Alex came home on sudden leave early in August, Mrs.
      St. George was caught at a disadvantage. He had not warned
      her of his coming, for he had been pulled out of a trench
      somewhere in front of Arras, and had been bundled off to
      Boulogne, wearing his best tunic, a bulging haversack, and
      an excited face. He had managed to send off a wire to
      Kitty, but he had not wired to his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty met him at Victoria, and from the moment that he saw
      her he thought of nothing else for the next twelve hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've reserved a room at the 'Astor.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, great! Kitty, I'm so frightfully happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked browner, fitter and stronger, though there was a
      something in his eyes that called up her compassion. He
      appeared both more resolute and more frightened, and though
      the fear in him had been kept chained up and chattering in
      a dark corner, at times it managed to look out of his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the taxi they sat very close. She could feel him
      trembling to the spell in her. He put his face close to her
      hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do smell sweet."
    </p>
    <p>
      A little laugh and a little clinging.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We won't bother about anybody else to-night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No--O, no. I haven't told the mater. It's you, Kitty."
    </p>
    <p>
      So, Mrs. St. George had no knowledge of her son being in
      London, and lying in the arms of his young wife. It was a
      night of little passionate struggles and tender
      consummations, and of murmurings and intimate chatter,
      until sleep covered them both with a tired silence. Their
      plans revived with the morning. Alex sat up, and, bending
      over her, stroked her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kitty, I'd like to spend four or five days somewhere down
      the river, would you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Love it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a little shy in the morning, and she liked this
      shyness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know just the place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seem to know everything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a jolly old inn about a mile from Maleham, we'll
      wire them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather. After breakfast. I say, the sun is shining."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then his face fell a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's the mater. Must go this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her appealingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's been--rather--O, you know what I mean. Will you
      come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty sat up and kissed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, if you wish it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You great little woman. I've been thinking--that if we
      went together--"
    </p>
    <p>
      They went, and Cummins opened the door of No. 77 to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--I never--Mr. Alex!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cummins, this is my--Mrs. Alex St. George. Leave, yes;
      rather sudden. Cummins and I are very old friends, Kitty.
      Aren't we, Cummins?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should say so, sir. Glad to see you, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was both nervous and excited, and the women, after
      glancing in a friendly but questioning way at each other,
      looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is my mother in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upstairs, sir, writing letters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll go into the dining-room, and give her a surprise.
      Will you tell her, Cummins? Mr. and Mrs. Alex St. George."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cummins went upstairs, but she did not hurry. Mr. Alex's
      marriage was news to her, an astounding piece of news, but
      she had to suppose that it would not be so astounding to
      her mistress. Because Mrs. St. George must have known, and
      remained silent about it. No, Cummins did not suppose that
      Mrs. St. George had liked it; she was not the sort of woman
      to like it. And how long had Mr. Alex been married? Pretty
      little thing, too, with nice eyes. Yes, and with a will of
      her own, by the look of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cummins did not know what a bombshell she was casting when
      she opened the drawing-room door and made her announcement.
      Mrs. St. George was writing a letter, and it happened to be
      a letter to Messrs. Test &amp; Crabtree on certain
      information she had received from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Alex is downstairs, madam, with Mrs. Alex."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cummins never forgot the look on Mrs. St. George's face as
      she turned in her chair. Her mistress's face seemed to grow
      all pinched and old; the eyes flared for a moment, and then
      became ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Alex, madam, home on leave; rather sudden, it seems,
      and Mrs. Alex with him. Mr. Alex wished me to say--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George rose from her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It--is--very sudden. Will you ask Mr. Alex to come up
      here? Mr. Alex--not--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only--Mr. Alex, madam?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cummins closed the door, and looking frightened, went
      downstairs. She was no fool. She knew that the message she
      had been given to deliver partook of the nature of an
      ultimatum to Mr. Alex and of an affront to his wife.
      Cummins was too much of a partisan and too soft-hearted for
      the proper delivering of ultimata and affronts. What was
      she going to do about it? The dining-room door was half
      open, and she had made a noiseless approach over the thick
      hall carpet. She put her head round the edge of the door,
      and saw those two young things standing side by side at the
      farther end of the room. They had their backs turned; they
      were looking up at the portrait of the Waterloo St. George.
      The St. George of the Great War had his arm round his
      wife's waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Over here is my father."
    </p>
    <p>
      They moved together, and Cummins drew back her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are like him, Alex."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty was looking very solemn in the presence of the St.
      George portraits. To her they appeared as the hostile faces
      of dead grandees, scrutinizing the little modern creature,
      this tobacconist's daughter. She was daring them and her
      husband's mother. She was trying not to feel self-conscious
      in the presence of a possible attack. She had glanced at
      herself in a mirror, and had found little to quarrel with
      in her hat and dress. The daughter of Mrs. Sarah knew how
      to dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the big, cold room, with its portraits and its
      atmosphere of aloofness! She realized Mrs. St. George in
      it, and the Alex whom she did not know, the Alex of Melfont
      St. George's and Cardigan Square. The war Alex was hers.
      She felt his arm round her. And what a long time his mother
      was taking to come downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You all look such tall people."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cummins, peeping through the hinge-crack of the door, saw
      the sudden downward glance young St. George gave at the
      serious and glowing face, as though his wife was the most
      wonderful thing in the world to him just then; which she
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No--I'm blessed if I'll take in that message," said
      Cummins to herself, and tiptoed to the top of the kitchen
      stairs. "Let her take it herself--if she can't feel better
      than that. She can sack me if she likes."
    </p>
    <p>
      She went below and poured her rebelliousness and its
      inspiration into the ears of the cook and the between-maid.
      She was in the midst of it when the drawing-room bell rang.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cummins sat down in a chair and took off her spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She can ring. I'm not going up. I don't care. She wants to
      ask me. Why can't she come downstairs like a mother and a
      lady?"
    </p>

    <p>
      Mrs. St. George was asking herself much the same question,
      but as a mother, and an angry woman, and not as Cummins's
      "lady." She stood by the Adam fireplace, very tall and
      straight, still waiting for Cummins to answer the bell, and
      wondering why she did not answer it. She rang the bell a
      second time, keeping her finger on it for fully fifteen
      seconds, but the lack of response from below left her to
      tackle her own problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked to one of the windows, and looked down into the
      square, but with eyes that saw nothing of any happenings
      there. What was she going to do? Descend or let Alex come
      up to her? And supposing he brought the girl up with him?
      She did not wish to see Kitty; she imagined that this
      sudden intrusion had been conceived and planned by Kitty;
      it was a piece of bluff, an attempt to make Mrs. St. George
      put her cards on the table. Emotional bluff, perhaps! And
      Alex had gone to his wife before coming to his mother! No,
      she would not go downstairs to them; she would wait; Alex
      should come up to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She resumed her seat at her desk and with every appearance
      of impartial calmness went on with the writing of her
      letter. Yes, an attitude of calmness, a severe and judicial
      dignity. She could say to him--"My dear boy, I am not
      acting from spite or pique or prejudice. I have
      considered--this marriage--deliberately. For the sake of
      your future happiness I refuse to recognize it. Some day I
      think you will agree with me." She would let herself go as
      far as that, but no further, and she was wise. She would
      exercise restraint. Silence, a dignified and kind silence,
      can be very suggestive. It might make him wonder, ask
      himself questions, look at his tobacconist's daughter with
      enlightened attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dining-room below Alex was growing restless. It was
      like waiting for zero hour, and wishing it would arrive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder what's happened to the mater."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at Kitty, and Kitty gave him a serious and faint
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go up and see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I'll wait here."
    </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated; he betrayed a sudden impatience, but it was
      not inspired by his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say--it makes me feel mean. Cummins must have told her.
      I'll go and see."
    </p>
    <p>
      He hurried up the stairs, while Kitty stood in the midst of
      the family portraits, knowing that the battle was to be
      joined, and that it was to be fought by two women who would
      not see each other, but who would remain in different
      rooms. Alex was the field of battle, Alex and his emotions,
      his impulses, his sense of rightness, his weakness and his
      generosity. Two women drew him different ways. She pressed
      her teeth against her under lip, listened and waited. She
      was glad that he had had that night with her. What could
      the other woman do and offer?
    </p>
    <p>
      Alex was in the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother! Didn't Cummins tell you--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There seemed to be a pause. Mrs. St. George was laying down
      her pen, and turning to look at her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Cummins told me--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But--mother--! You might--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She met him with a sort of cold yet affectionate serenity.
      She was admirable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alex--I can't admit--I'm sorry, my dear boy, but I have my
      reason. You are my reason--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, mater, you must see my wife--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, I cannot see her. Please realize--that I feel
      responsible. I know what I am doing. I have had time to
      consider--I have considered--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, mater, I ask you--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, you can ask me anything but that. I--and this
      house are the same; everything is the same--but that."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then she saw her son as the son of his father. He
      behaved just as Charlie St. George had behaved on certain
      rare occasions. He went very white; his face looked
      twisted; his eyes lit up and out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother, it is not fair. You shouldn't put me in a corner
      like this. I'm in earnest. It's not fair to either of us.
      Kitty is my wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother remained perfectly still.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not thinking of your wife, Alex; I am thinking of
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      His whiteness changed to red.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But--I--have to think of her. It's not fair. It's an
      insult."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear," she said, "I'm sorry--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know that I--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alex, a man has to choose. I think I know quite well how
      you will choose. We disagree. But I am your mother, and
      shall always be your mother. Nothing will change me.
      But--some day--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her, and then turned sharply to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shan't regret it--never. You won't understand. You won't
      give her a chance. It's just snobbery."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my dear, not snobbery--but loyalty--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Loyalty!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To a tradition. The tradition--that a girl should be--what
      a man--"
    </p>
    <p>
      But he made a sort of inarticulate sound, and went out and
      closed the door. Kitty heard him descending the stairs; he
      came slowly. She went out into the hall and met him. Her
      face had a grave, white shine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know, dear; I don't mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught her and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You dear; you great little woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      They went out of the house together holding hands.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      At the "Astor" a telegram was waiting for them from the
      "Bear" at Malcham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Room reserved for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty said: "Shall we go--this afternoon? I'd love to go."
    </p>
    <p>
      He folded up the telegram, and on his face was a little
      inward smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's green and quiet down there. I want to forget. I
      shall--with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards there was lunch with Mrs. Sarah at Vernor
      Street, a Mrs. Sarah who asked no questions and raised no
      problems, but who gave a man his leave as he wanted to have
      it--poor lad. After that they did an hour's hurried
      shopping; Alex needed some pyjamas, a few collars, and a
      new tie; also, he bought Kitty chocolates and would have
      bought her anything on earth that she might have asked for,
      had he been able to afford it. But she would not let him
      buy her many things. "After the war, my dear, we may need
      all our money." He accepted this as wisdom; he felt her to
      be as wise as she felt him to be carelessly generous.
      Always, probably, he had had plenty of money. She noticed
      that he was nice to the people behind the counter, and
      considerate, much more considerate than a girl would have
      been.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing beside him as his mate, the young wife who had
      known his embraces, she was yet more aware of him as a
      stranger. During the war the mere physical relationship
      became so easy, a rather primitive act, begun and
      consummated in haste, when all physical states could be so
      transient. You took what the day gave, and more than it
      could give--if you were greedy, and Kitty was not greedy.
      But this man of hers, what was he? How would they stand to
      each other when the spoilt children and the young heroes
      had become very ordinary young civilians? Though Alex was
      not ordinary, because he was hers, and because she had felt
      responsible for him almost from the moment when she had
      seen his reflection in the mirror of the Vernor Street
      shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had to realize her Alex, and that was what Maleham was
      to be to Kitty; conscious, deliberate realization. They
      drove from Maleham station in an ancient waggonette, down a
      lane that ended at the river. Here stood the Bear Inn,
      black and white under elms and chestnuts, with an orchard
      going down to the water, all green and still and empty, a
      place to make you yawn, or dream, or weep. But once upon a
      time--men--men in grey frocks had accomplished things at
      Maleham; they had built the stone tithe-barn in the meadow
      across the lane where ash-trees threw a flickering shade; a
      gable-end of their refectory still pricked an ancient ear;
      but the grey monks were dead and forgotten, and since their
      day Maleham had accomplished little that had endured.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the moderns, Maleham was the "Bear," green willows, the
      river, empty meadows, overshadowing beechwoods on the
      hills, beer, boats, a restful greenness to the few, secret
      week-ends to others. To Kitty, Maleham was Alex's desire,
      and her need to know her Alex, a secret corner where she
      would have him all to herself, to be loved and realized and
      studied. Kitty was a Londoner; she had no particular
      passion for green grass as such, or for dewy meadows, or
      moonlight among the willows. The grey monks had
      accomplished sanctity, a scheme of living that was theirs,
      and Kitty--the modern--was all for accomplishment. She was
      not a dreamer, and if she had day-dreams, they were
      practical and human and wholesome; she had no cobwebs in
      her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Alex was a dreamer, and her virtue lay in her being
      able to realize him as a dreamer. He could lie on his back
      under a tree, and look at the sky and see something where
      there seemed to be nothing. She wanted Alex, though why she
      wanted him she did not quite know. The need was not merely
      physical. It had begun with compassion. But she would go on
      wanting him; she was quite as possessive as Mrs. Clara,
      only more humanly so. Then for the moment he was wholly
      hers in this green and secret corner, yet, to Kitty,
      Maleham was no more than a half-way house. She had to keep
      her Alex and to know him, to make him hers in a way other
      than that of sleeping together. She understood that
      marriage had to be a communion of heads, as well as of
      hearts and hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deliberately, she set out to make him hers. She had begun
      to realize how little mercy she might expect from Alex's
      mother, and so it was necessary for her to mean more to
      Alex than his mother did. That was obvious. She had not had
      Mrs. Sarah for her mother without being made wise as to men
      and their ficklenesses. She herself was not fickle, or she
      did not feel that she would be fickle because she was built
      on sturdy and enduring lines. She was not easily bored. So
      much of the fickleness--the desire for change--is the
      result of boredom, of an uncertain and a flickering
      vitality.
    </p>
    <p>
      This husband of hers, this man-boy, what was he? What did
      he believe in, what did he desire, what were his objects
      and his ambitions, if he had any? What were his habits and
      appetites, and his prejudices and his tricks? For everybody
      had their tricks. There was the Alex that she knew, the
      wide-eyed, freckled and rather sensitive creature, with a
      mouth that was not too firm, and a skin that was girlish.
      He was a clean lad, what people of his own class would call
      a nice lad. He might be something of a child, lovable, but
      a little indefinite.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was the real Alex like? What would the grown, post-war
      Alex be, if there was to be a post-war Alex? She clenched
      her fists and swore that there should be a post-war Alex.
      And then she felt that she had to find out. She had to go
      behind his mother and his father, behind those St. George
      portraits, behind Cardigan Square, and Melfont St. George's
      back to the essential man in him.

      IV
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      In confronting the future--that very hypothetical future in
      which the sex experience and the war and their honeymoon
      would be no more than incidents--Kitty showed the courage
      and the broad sagacity that she had inherited from Mrs.
      Sarah.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did penetrate Alex. In those few days at Maleham she
      found out as much about him as it was possible for her to
      discover. He was a dreamer, and he was a little indolent.
      He liked to lie under a tree or at the bottom of a punt, or
      to idle along the towing-path under the willows. He would
      stare at the water or the sky; he liked to talk, to get
      into some secret green corner and sprawl with his head on
      her lap and talk with his eyes looking up at her while she
      stroked his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did a great deal of talking. He had a natural
      frankness that was very appealing, and an extraordinarily
      sweet temper. They discussed his mother, and the problem of
      her hostility, for obviously it had to be discussed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course--it will come all right; it must do. She will
      have to realize. I've been glad, and I've been sorry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mothers can be jealous creatures. Even--if I had been
      someone else. But then--our shop! I trapped you--my dear--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You saved my self-respect."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked over him towards the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She will never believe that. But why are you glad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It has brought us together, hasn't it, Kitty? as nothing
      else could have done, made us know each other. You have
      been so very fine about it. I'll make it up to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew that he was utterly sincere; his devotion was
      vivid and impulsive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So long as you want me, and go on wanting me," she said,
      "there will be nothing for us to fear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind all this greenness, beyond the gently gliding water
      and those summer fields, she felt his dread of the war, his
      dread of going back. She held his fear in her arms, and
      that was her justification and her joy. She knew that he
      wanted to forget, as much as it was possible to forget, and
      with all her strength and her tenderness she set herself to
      help him to forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a boy he was! A dear boy. She felt herself to be as
      much his mother as his wife. She would let her
      consciousness dwell upon him as he lay with his head in her
      lap. She began to know every bit of the external part of
      him, the way his hair grew, that one big freckle over the
      right eyebrow, how his glances seemed to lose themselves in
      space, his warm, eager and rather uncertain mouth, the
      delicate texture of his skin. He appealed to her as a very
      transparent thing, a creature of swift responses,
      sensitive, not too clever, but lovable--O, very lovable.
      His very flexibility appealed to her sturdiness. In a way
      he was weak, in that he was easily and generously
      influenced, but if he was moved in the right way he had a
      certain sensitive strength. He would be big with big
      people, and rather inarticulate and helpless with the
      forcefully mean and the greedy. He had his principles, but
      he would be inclined to let the unprincipled rush him off
      his feet and submerge him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one place on the river that he particularly
      loved. They would punt up-stream, tie up under some
      willows, and climb out to a grass bank that lay screened by
      old thorn-trees. Across the still water lay other meadows,
      secret and empty, stretching to the immense and silent
      greenness of towering beechwoods. There was the blue sky,
      and the passing clouds, and a few cattle, and an old
      farmhouse away on the left, red and white among some trees.
      Swallows skimmed. Sometimes they saw the blue flight of a
      kingfisher.
    </p>
    <p>
      There seemed to be comfort for him in those fields; they
      were as pleasant and as reassuring as Kitty's lap. So
      peaceful and unstressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would be rather jolly to farm after the war. How would
      you like it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew her hands down under his chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sounds so peaceful, doesn't it? Growing things, instead of
      destroying them."
    </p>
    <p>
      She understood him, and how those green fields appealed to
      him. Like thousands of older men, soldiers by force of
      circumstance, he loved to call up into his mind a vision of
      peaceful living. It gave him, somehow, a sense of security;
      it made him feel that the vision of the afterwards was the
      permanent thing, the war a ghastly interlude. Also it
      helped him to believe that he would survive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty could not imagine herself on a farm, but she let him
      have his vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm a London sparrow, my dear. Should I have to learn to
      milk?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought not. His notion of farming was a very
      gentlemanly one. You walked about with a gun; or rode, and
      consulted with your bailiff.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That wouldn't be necessary. We'd keep a car, and a horse
      or two."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would it pay?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The farm? Of course, we should have to go into all that.
      If the mater--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked down into his rather too trustful eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Boy, we must remember that we may have to stand on our own
      feet. If your mother--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw his eyelashes flicker.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, she'll come round; she must. You see, all the money is
      hers as long as she lives. My father left it that way. I
      often wonder--He died rather suddenly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How, dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hunting."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her intimate mind-picture of Alex grew. She had begun to
      realize him as one of those men who like to be gently
      coerced. His very good nature, indolent and happy, waited
      upon life as upon a trusted nurse. Mrs. Sarah had told her
      that many men were like that, and good men, too. "Ride a
      beast of a horse, my dear, and yet come home and leave a
      woman to handle the reins." Well, it might be so with Alex.
      He seemed to trust her better than he trusted himself.
      There was nothing bustling about him; he had no swagger; he
      was no cave-man. Kitty would have fought a cave-man tooth
      and nail.
    </p>
    <p>
      She loved him as he was. At night his head came so easily
      on to her plump shoulder, or into her bosom. She was more
      strongly sexed than he was. Her arms gripped tighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in those most intimate moments he was a little shy and
      sensitive. Always things would be sensitive between them.
      He had asked: "May I--? You are so wonderful, somehow."
      Yes, she loved him as he was. She had her own poise, her
      compact dignity, her love of accomplishment. A boisterous
      male thing, taking her and life for granted, would have
      clashed with her sense of personal efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      At all events, she had taken some of her philosophy on
      credit from Mrs. Sarah. She had not had the complete
      experience that would prove to her what children some men
      are, and that your successful woman and wife thinks of them
      as beloved children. Kitty would reach the other side of a
      problem before Alex had been conscious of it as a problem,
      and would be ready waiting for him, to applaud his solution
      of the problem if he solved it in the right way. A man's
      footsteps may be planted in the footmarks that the woman
      has trodden. She may remain quite still during his male
      outbursts, his moments of accomplishment, even though they
      be the mere smashing of toys.

    <p>
      Thus, under the beams of the Bear Inn and the willows and
      orchard trees, Kitty learnt to know her Alex. Though her
      problem was not only to know him, but to keep him, in spite
      of the war, in spite of his mother, in spite of Melfont St.
      George's.
    </p>
    <p>
      What were the possibilities? Alex might be killed. But her
      strong little arms thrust this possibility away. It seemed
      to her that his mother, and all those St. George and Smythe
      people, were more menacing than the war, and especially his
      mother. Such women can command powers of coercion: they can
      distort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had not old Jermyn St. George said to Mrs. Sarah--"She'll
      never forgive you. She's a sort of glass woman with an
      electric bulb for a heart. I know her. She'll try to get
      her boy back."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, and all those other and various St. Georges, would
      they not rally round Alex's mother? In refusing to
      recognize this marriage they would exert pressure, a slow
      and sinister pressure, upon an impressionable nature.
      Pressure can distort an object and a situation. It might
      distort Alex's ultimate impression of what his marriage was
      and might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, Mrs. St. George and Alex's people must recognize her.
      She must compel recognition, make so sure of herself as his
      wife that she would leave them no alternative.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I have a baby," she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      A child was a solid human fact. You could not poison it, or
      distort its rightness, or argue its existence away. A child
      would be so final.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled in the darkness over Alex's sleeping head.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what a silly business! And a baby might be a bit of a
      complication. It would mean two children, Alex and it. Yet
      five years hence, perhaps, the St. Georges would have
      accepted her, and made it their affair to forget that they
      had quarrelled with Vernor Street. They would refer to her
      as a doctor's daughter. They might even approve of her as a
      wife and mother at Melfont St. George's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Melfont St. George's! She felt herself quite capable
      of rising or descending to Melfont St. George's, of
      managing Melfont St. George's, of realizing herself as Mrs.
      Alexander St. George. Of course! She was a daughter of Mrs.
      Sarah.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she loved Alex, and she would go on loving him,
    </p>
    <p>
      She touched his sleeping head gently with her lips.

    </p>
    <p>
      Three days before the end of young St. George's leave they
      left Arcady for London, returning to an anonymous niche in
      the Astor Hotel, a kind of hole in a cliff, and here the
      wind of the world's happenings seemed to blow so keenly
      that Kitty could feel her man's soul shivering. He had
      hated leaving Maleham. In the train his eyes had had that
      old frightened look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Happiest week of my life, Kitty."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had sat very close to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, there will be other weeks like that--weeks when there
      will be no going back."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was plain to her that the hotel troubled him, for it was
      full of the brown flux of the war, a great cage in which
      the human senses were both scourged and imprisoned. At
      dinner he looked at the men and women as though he saw them
      raw, naked emotions sitting at tables, and eating, and
      drinking, and lusting, and laughing. He had imagination,
      and that was part of his trouble, and why he was what the
      doctors called a "martial misfit." He had seen dead men,
      mangled men. The war gave you horrible moments when you saw
      things as they might be, a bloody head instead of a
      champagne bottle on a table, or a woman--a woman like that
      dark little thing over there--being embraced by a brown
      corpse.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said to Kitty: "Beastly place, this. Makes you feel you
      are at a station--saying good-bye."
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw his eyes strangely big and vague across the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We can leave to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd rather. Funny, you look all dim, and your voice seems
      a long way off."
    </p>
    <p>
      That night he had one of those monstrous dreams that
      tortured some men during the war. She woke to find him
      struggling and uttering wild words; for some moments he
      struggled even with her; one of his elbows struck her mouth
      and bruised her lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear, it's all right, I'm here."
    </p>
    <p>
      She held him fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kit--O--my God--I--thought--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, my darling, put your head here."
    </p>
    <p>
      He lay in her arms, trembling and panting, while she
      comforted him with the warm strength of her little body. He
      was hers. Never before had she felt him so much hers. But
      next morning he saw blood on the pillow, and her wounded
      mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kitty--how--? Did I--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was standing barefooted by the bed. She seemed to glow
      in her white gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went down suddenly on his knees and embraced her,
      pressing his head against her warm body.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a rotter I am! Getting scared--even in a dream--and
      hurting you--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It hasn't hurt me," she said, "my dearest."
    </p>
    <p>
      But she loved the hotel no more than he did. It was she who
      packed, while she sent him to pay the bill; she ordered a
      taxi; she took him to Vernor Street, and that night he
      slept with her in her own little room. And he slept well,
      though she lay awake for a long while in the intimate
      narrowness of that little bed, feeling him as her human
      purpose in life. Also, she was thinking of something that
      she would have to say to him on the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said it while they lay awake together with the light
      diffusing itself dimly through the blind and the curtains.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must go and see your mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I know. It's beastly of me--but I don't want to see
      her. It might have been so different."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may be different--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course--It must be--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But not quite as you think, dear. You see, if I have a
      baby--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was aware of his face turning quickly and coming close
      to hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kitty! Good Lord, I hadn't thought of it, somehow. Of
      course. I'll tell her--that. Shall I? It ought to make her
      realize--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you might tell her. Perhaps--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Alex kissed his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not till the afternoon did Alex set out for Cardigan
      Square. A newspaper boy was running along Vemor Street,
      shouting the news of Haig's great drive on the Somme, and
      Alex bought a paper. He turned to glance up at Mrs. Sarah's
      window, and saw his wife's honey-coloured head there. He
      fluttered the paper at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great news! More prisoners--thousands of prisoners. They
      seem to have got them on the run."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's coming at last--Victory."
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the paper with him to Cardigan Square, with Kitty's
      "Victory" running in his head. There was a little murmur of
      victory in the air, and it gave him confidence, and a new
      hope, and he needed confidence for that meeting with his
      mother. Surely she would relax a little when he told her--?
      Even the plane-trees in the square seemed green and big
      with the news, and the sparrows more cocky. He stood on the
      familiar steps and rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      An under-maid opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My mother in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir. She has a lot of ladies with her, though."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A committee-meeting. I'll wait in the dining-room. Where's
      Cummins?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cummins has gone, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gone!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nearly a week ago, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      His face clouded over. He went into the dining-room, and
      sitting down by one of the windows, began to read the
      paper, but from the welter of news emerged the fact that
      Cummins, dear old Cummins, had left them after all these
      years. Cummins, with her plain and pleasant face, and the
      kindly glimmer of her spectacles. Had she gone of her own
      free will, or had his mother sacked her? If so--it was
      rather abominable.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited. Three-quarters of an hour passed before the
      committee came down the stairs and dispersed itself with a
      busy and cheerful chatter. Alex stood at the window. When
      the hall was empty, he went out and up the stairs, taking
      his paper with him as though the good news in it continued
      to give him confidence. The drawing-room door was shut. He
      opened it and saw his mother sitting at her desk, just as
      she had been sitting there on that day when she had refused
      to see Kitty. How changeless she was! Nothing seemed to
      have changed. Only old Cummins had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not disturbing you, mater?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw her chin, and the straight line of her forehead
      under her neat fair hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--it is you, Alex. Come in. I have a few notes to make."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice was level and austerely kind. She spoke and
      behaved as though nothing had happened, as though she had
      seen him less than an hour ago. She went on with her
      writing. He sat down in an arm-chair behind her, and
      re-opened his paper, and felt chilled and weary. Five
      minutes passed. She began to sort out her papers and to put
      them away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The news is very gratifying to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have heard," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She continued to talk over her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Grey brought in a paper. Have you seen one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I bought one on the way here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Splendid news--Those wretches have had a terrible beating.
      Most encouraging--too--after what happened in the spring.
      And with the Americans, too, arriving by the hundred
      thousand."
    </p>
    <p>
      She talked on, easily, coldly, with admirable composure.
      She asked no questions. She did not ask him where he had
      been, or what he had been doing, or what he was going to
      do. It was as though a certain person and a certain
      situation did not exist, and she was ready and able to
      ignore everything outside No. 77 Cardigan Square. She might
      be giving him to understand that he was her son, and that
      when he entered her house he was nothing but a son.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the man in her son protested. Always she had treated
      him like this. He could remember boyish protests, moments
      of young passion congealed by her saying quite calmly,
      "Your hair is very untidy; go and brush it." But this was
      no childish protest to be crushed, and he began to be full
      of an eager resentment against her studied concealment of
      all curiosity. Why didn't she ask him--? Why didn't she
      give him the inevitable opening?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've been down in the country, mater."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Down at Maleham."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the river--I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice was bright and busy, like notes neatly and
      clearly struck on a piano. He wished she would stop
      fiddling with the papers on her desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, we stayed at the 'Bear.' The weather was perfect.
      Kitty and I--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke over her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not wish to hear anything--about your marriage--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But--mater--I have got to talk to you about it. Why can't
      you take it seriously?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I take it so seriously, Alex, that for me it does not
      exist."
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt himself flushing, growing angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it will have to exist. It's possible--that Kitty and I
      may have a child."
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her chair at that, and looked at him with a
      blank, blue stare. She had actually forgotten that there
      might be a child! It was monstrous and absurd, but she had
      forgotten it, and after that one steady stare at her son,
      she turned again to her desk, and extricating some papers
      from a pigeon-hole, began to handle them. Her voice, when
      she used it again, was not unlike the crackling of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry--but I should be inclined to regard that as a
      disaster--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was on his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it is your child, Alex."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But--why? Don't you realize, mater, that it would
      prove--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to be considering the paper in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It might prove nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother--that's nonsense--I don't understand what you
      mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are very blind, my dear. But just at present I do not
      wish to discuss the matter--more intimately.
      Later--perhaps--when you are a little less blind."
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked up and down the room once or twice, and then came
      back to his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Supposing I'm killed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to consider some point before returning the
      papers to their pigeonholes. She felt the need for pausing,
      for reviewing the problem. Had his blurting out of the fact
      that his wife might have a child altered the position?
      Could it not be used--?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have a feeling, my dear boy, that you will not be
      killed. Please don't harrow me. Isn't that rather unfair?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry, mater."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have feelings. I am trying to control them--for your
      sake--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you said--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I was blind. What d'you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose; she moved to the window and stood looking down
      into the square.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't wish to enlarge--at present. You have given me
      very little time--my dear. You go back--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The day after to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly. Sometimes--even a mother--may wish--to be
      remembered--and to forget--You'll stay to dinner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, my dear. Won't you let me forget--just for a
      few hours--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will, mater--but I don't understand--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps--some day--you will, my dear boy."

      II

    <p>

    <p>
      At tea he asked his mother what had become of Cummins, and
      she told him that Cummins had been dismissed for
      impertinence and neglect of her duties, but she did not
      tell him the true reason. She sat there in black and white,
      with the August sunlight touching her soft fair hair, a
      very comely woman admirably gowned within and without. She
      talked about the war, and the changes that the war was
      producing in the manners and the mentality of the populace,
      but even her conversation suggested concealment. She kept
      life and the realities veiled like some French madame in a
      <i>pâtisserie</i> shop who keeps her cakes covered with
      muslin. Or perhaps she suggested secrets preserved in ice.
      But the impression that she gave to her son was one of
      concealment, of something smothered away, of a figure
      behind a curtain, of a little dagger hidden in a muff.
    </p>
    <p>
      After tea she said that she had more letters to write, and
      he went out and walked. He walked round and round the
      square, remembering that night when he had circled it like
      a humiliated human beast in a cage. Old Cummins had let him
      in--kind old Cummins. He was sorry that she had gone. Why
      had she gone? Why was his mother making all this mystery
      about her refusal to recognize or even to consider his
      marriage? She seemed to be concealing something. She was so
      superior and serene about it, so confident in a way that
      made him uneasy. No doubt she objected to Kitty and to
      Kitty's mother, and to the tobacco shop, and to the whole
      atmosphere of Vernor Street; and his blindness--as she
      described it--his blindness to the social complications.
      But he was not blind to them. He loved Kitty; he was happy
      with Kitty; he liked Mrs. Sarah; he felt at home in Vernor
      Street, much more so than in Cardigan Square. Was it due to
      the war? Would he not feel just as much at home with Kitty
      after the war, if there was to be an after the war? He and
      Kitty would have a home of their own somewhere. And would
      he care very much if all his relatives and his mother's
      friends left him alone with Kitty? He did not think so.
      Besides, things were going to be different after the war;
      the change was in the air. Why did not his mother recognize
      it? It was she who was blind, wilfully blind.
    </p>
    <p>
      But argue as he would, he could not dispel this impression
      of his mother as of a woman hiding behind a curtain, nor
      would she withdraw that curtain or suffer him to put it
      aside. What was it that she was concealing behind it?
      Nothing but her prejudices, her understandable hostility?
      He could not escape from the feeling that there was
      something more.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was it?
    </p>
    <p>
      He was conscious of a desire to discover the whole of it
      before he went back to France.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he found himself at his mother's table, and it
      seemed so familiar and yet so strange. He saw the same
      silver, the same glass, the Worcester dinner-service, the
      Sheffield plate dishes, his own silver table napkin ring
      with his initials on it. And flowers, mauve and white
      asters, looking as though they were made of wax and had
      bloomed lifelessly in the vases for the last ten years. His
      mother's face and figure, too, had the quality of wax. She
      wore her black silk dress, and a rope of pearls; her skin
      had a waxiness, though the tip of her nose showed that
      slightly reddened and polished sheen that associated itself
      with the arctic blue of her eyes. Yes, just as though she
      had come in on a frosty morning. Always he had been a
      little afraid of his mother, afraid of those blue eyes and
      the high light on the tip of her nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a rather dreadful meal. Everything was so changeless
      and correct; everything matched and balanced. He was made
      to think of Vernor Street, and of the unconventional but
      efficient ease of Mrs. Sarah's table, where one vegetable
      dish had a green border and the other a blue one, and the
      salt-cellars were odd, and you helped yourself and got up
      to cut bread if you wanted it. And Mrs. Sarah eating as
      though she enjoyed her food, which she did. He had never
      heard his mother say that she liked a particular sweet or
      savoury. She ate rather as a wax figure might be expected
      to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a contrast, too, to that noisy cheeriness in France,
      where you drank whisky out of cheap tumblers or tin mugs,
      and the tablecloth might be an army blanket.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you have some Sauterne, Alex? I am afraid there is no
      whisky."
    </p>
    <p>
      He drank Sauterne. He was feeling abominably restless and
      on edge. He was conscious of his chair and of his knife and
      fork. He talked in snatches. And all the while he was
      telling himself that he must have it out with his mother
      before he went back to Kitty. He owed it to Kitty. This
      atmosphere of a concealed crisis was intolerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards he followed her upstairs to the drawing-room and
      drank his coffee there, standing by the open window and
      making a tinkling sound with his coffee-spoon. The evening
      was superb. The tops of the plane-trees were a deep green
      under a sky that seemed stretched like a blue-black
      velarium above the tops of the houses. Even the privets and
      hollies and shabby lilacs in the gardens took to themselves
      a mystery and a softness. He stood at gaze. A big star
      pierced the sky high up in the deepening blue. Something in
      him seemed to attach itself to that point of silver.
      Suddenly he was moved to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was at her desk, still busy with some of those eternal
      papers of hers, though he doubted whether she could see to
      read them in the dusk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have never said I was sorry."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her figure gave him a sense of stillness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In your letter, Alex."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, in that letter. But I have never said it. Perhaps you
      were waiting--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what way are you sorry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For not telling you before I went to France. Perhaps you
      will forgive me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have forgiven you--that," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited. He had stood before her in the dusk like a
      warm-hearted child that had said, "Mother, I'm sorry." He
      had offered her a sudden impulsive sonship, the chance of a
      new relationship, a more significant intimacy. Would she
      accept it? Would she put aside that curtain? She was his
      mother. This going back to France would be different from
      the other going; he had experienced deeper emotions; he was
      more of a man. He did not want to leave wounds behind him,
      a misunderstanding that could not be healed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the silence continued, though he heard the rustling of
      her papers. What was she going to say? Surely she would say
      something? He heard her push back her chair. She rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is getting too dark to see. Please ring the bell,
      Alex."
    </p>
    <p>
      He rang it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jeffreys had better close the shutters and draw the
      curtains, so that we can have the lights."
    </p>
    <p>
      The maid appeared, and shut out the green-grey trees, the
      blue-black sky, and the star.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Smoke--if you like, Alex."
    </p>
    <p>
      He brought out his cigarette-case, and with his face
      averted, lit a cigarette.

    <p>
      Kitty noticed the change in him. He came back to her that
      night with a troubled and silent look. She asked no
      questions. She gathered that his mother had given him no
      comfort, but she did not think that it was Mrs. St.
      George's merciless rigidity that had brought that look to
      his eyes. "Only two more nights"; his eyes said just that
      to her, and her heart understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the last day he showed a silent gentleness, as though
      all that was happening in him was too complex and too
      poignant to be put into words. He was too deeply conscious
      of his feelings to be articulate; a sorrowful sadness
      possessed him. But he showed himself to her in flashes,
      little human tendernesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where do you sit, Kitty, when you write to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, just here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Show me."
    </p>
    <p>
      She got out the writing-pad and sat down at the end of the
      table with her back to the fireplace, and posed herself as
      though she were writing one of her letters to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just like this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to be able to see you. Write."
    </p>
    <p>
      She went through the dumb-show of writing, and he stood and
      looked at her as though he were printing a memory, stamping
      it in vivid detail upon his consciousness. Her head of wavy
      and honey-coloured bobbed hair bent itself over the table.
      A left fist rested with its knuckles on the edge of the
      page. She held the pen between a plump forefinger and
      thumb. She gave the impression of great intentness, of
      serious concentration; he could imagine her frowning or
      smiling gently as she raised her head and stared steadily
      at a Landseer engraving on the opposite wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now--I shall always see you like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's generally--at night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the light shines over your hair. I sit anywhere I can,
      on a box, on the edge of my bunk, or at a civilized table,
      if we are in billets. Sometimes there is a little bit of
      garden left--and you can lie on a patch of grass. It's good
      to be able to feel you can see people."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was the more passive of the two. He had returned to the
      shadow of the world's fear; she could feel the shadow of it
      upon him, chill and speechless, and being active, even in
      her emotions, she went into the shadow with him as though
      her glowing head and the warmth of her steadfast little
      body could disperse some of the darkness. Or--at least--she
      would be with him in the darkness. She understood it all,
      those swiftly passing hours, his gentle and melancholy
      restlessness, the way he would keep glancing at his
      wrist-watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made him take her out into the park, and they sat on
      the same seat in Queen's Walk. They had it to themselves.
      She sat beside him with an air of solemn wakefulness, as
      though she were keeping a vigil with him. He rested his
      elbow on his knees, and, bending, stared at the gravel, and
      prodded it aimlessly with his stick. He talked in snatches.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hope old Grimshaw will still be there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not, laddie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, things happen so quickly, you know. Grimmy's such a
      good chap."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gathered that Grimshaw or "Grimmy" was a comfort to
      him, and she made him talk about Grimshaw, and was able to
      piece together a picture of her husband's particular
      friend. "One of those stout, cheery chaps, you know, always
      pink in the face--even when things are pretty bloody. He
      has helped me no end. It wouldn't be the same, somehow, in
      B Company if Grimmy weren't there. Such a heart in him."
      Her gratitude went out to Lieutenant Grimshaw, that stocky,
      fatherly youngster, with his square red face and his dark
      eyes. So stout in the leg was he that the set of his
      puttees was a bit of a problem. He had a very red mouth and
      very black hair, and a voice that was like his face, full
      of deep colour. Strong, too! Alex had seen him pick up a
      six-foot sergeant wounded in a narrow trench, and carry him
      to where the stretcher-bearers could deal with him. And the
      buttons were always coming off Grimmy's tunic. Alex had
      seen him tied up with a boot-lace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's good to be with. He's such a sport. Helps you to be a
      sport. It isn't easy--sometimes."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him a deep, maternal look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you are a sport."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I try to be," he said, prodding hard at the gravel.

      He could not sleep that night. He neither wished to nor
      could, with that watch ticking away the heart-beats, and
      something unexpressed in him struggling for expression.
      They sat side by side in the narrow bed, leaning against
      each other, his right arm about her body, her left arm over
      his shoulder. The room was completely dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      He talked. His voice had a hushed and intimate seriousness.
      It was as though he were seeing himself and describing
      himself to her, his temperamental unfitness, the horror of
      his fear, its humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said: "It's horrible to talk like this, but yet telling
      you seems to help me. One has to try and do the pretending
      out there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never pretend with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      She put her mouth to his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it helps, tell me anything. All men are afraid, aren't
      they? Only the fools--and you are not a fool. It's only
      human to be afraid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the--meanness--of it--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt him grow rigid as though resisting the ghastly
      temptation to be mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Horrible! That unaccountable fear. Makes you sly--almost.
      All the decent, honourable feelings you've grown up with
      seem to drop like water out of a burst paper bag. You're
      just a cunning, shivery creature ready to bolt into a
      hole--and leave someone else to do the dirty job. And I'm
      not mean, naturally; that's what shocked me so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course you're not mean, laddie. You feel things more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I didn't. I have done things--once or twice--that
      made me feel sick and cold afterwards--and then hot with
      shame. I have been ready to snarl at Grimmy because I
      thought he had picked the safest corner in a dugout. As if
      he would! And once--when a strafe was on--I sent my
      servant--I have sat like a paralyzed rat in a corner and
      left my sergeant to carry on--when I ought to have been--O,
      you can't think how I hated myself, loathed myself--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She held him fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you have stuck it, laddie. You have not gone sick.
      You--are--doing your job."
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt him relax a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. And I'm doing it better. Though I don't like it any
      better. It's the meanness of fear that gets me, that makes
      me set my teeth, though my heart's pumping. I feel cold all
      over. I say to myself--'Damn you--don't be mean.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was her turn to pour out whispered words. She told him
      that he had two enemies to face instead of one, and that
      she was proud of him for making such a fight of it. Yes,
      and for feeling as he did, and telling her about it. She
      said that he was showing more courage than the men who had
      no imagination and were less sensitive, and less generous,
      too, perhaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear mouth--for saying such things. But you do help me out
      there. Most fellows are supposed to be more windy when they
      get married, but I am different. I'm always thinking of
      you. You seem to be there sometimes. It's my faith in you,
      Kitty. I can think of you with such confidence. You're such
      a dear, plucky, wholesome little woman. I feel that you
      couldn't do a mean, cheap thing, and it helps me to
      overcome that horrible meanness. It's good to be able to
      think like that. It's like one's belief in a God--or
      something that's finer and bigger than we are."
    </p>
    <p>
      She answered with awed earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll try never to fail you, laddie. I'm loving you all the
      time."

      She saw him off from Victoria. The sun was shining, and he
      managed to smile at her, but it was a smile that made her
      want to catch his head in her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew how he was feeling, but she kept her courage in
      her eyes. "It can't be long now. The tide has turned,
      laddie."
    </p>
    <p>
      He both looked at her, and yet could not bear to look.

      "I shall see you when you are writing your letters."

      Fream's Hotel in Vernor Street had lost some of its
      distinguished shabbiness during the war. It had been an
      hotel with traditions, and it had held to those traditions
      and to its old-fashioned Regency furniture, until the death
      of Queen Victoria had symbolized the spreading of a gradual
      newness. "Fream's" had offered brass candlesticks and
      slippers to its county people from Sussex and Hampshire and
      Dorset twenty years after most hotels had forgotten that
      such a practice had existed. With the passing of "Vicky"
      all kinds of solemn fustiness, the lumber of two
      generations, had been bundled out into the Street, though
      "Fream's" had retained its comfortable, solid, and county
      tradition. Long, lean men of the county breed and dowdy
      women who were somebodies, and had not to put on clothes or
      to take them off in order to assure the world that they
      were somebodies, still went in and out of its unpretentious
      doorway. But with the war a change had come. "Fream's" was
      painted and redecorated. Like some middle-aged woman
      suddenly infected with the war excitement, it had taken to
      lipstick and powder-puff, shortened its skirts, and become
      a little demode. The same sort of people stayed there, but
      they were different, and they stayed there with a
      difference. The hotel register had learnt to shut an eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fream's" was full of khaki. It associated itself with the
      war's red-faced, hard-eyed hurry to get its adventures, and
      to get them somehow or somewhere, but it still retained its
      tradition of wholesome discretion. It was not blatant in
      its second youth; it might be accommodating, but it
      prescribed limits. Nice people still went there.
    </p>
    <p>
      So that when Mrs. Clara St. George drove to "Fream's" one
      day in a taxi, and intimated to the manager that she had to
      be provided with a room for a week, as she was giving all
      her servants a holiday, she ostensibly was not departing
      from what might have been a Melfont St. George tradition.
      The manager, of course, knew nothing of her motives.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are rather full, madam. There is a room on the second
      floor that will be vacant on Tuesday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me see it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The manager took her up in person. It was a room
      overlooking Vernor Street, not actually opposite Mrs.
      Sarah's, but about twenty yards lower down. The occupant of
      the room was out, an officer on leave, an untidy, flashy
      sort of person, judging by the rare clutter, and a pair of
      purple and orange striped pyjamas flung anyhow upon the
      unmade bed. The manager apologized for the state of the
      room. Officers on leave were late risers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George was standing at the window, and looking
      diagonally across the street at the cream strip of painted
      brickwork that was Mrs. Sarah's. She was not paying much
      attention to the manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The room is rather small."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On Thursday, madam, I might be able to manage--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, this will do--perhaps. Is the street very noisy at
      night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very little traffic after eight o'clock, madam. We are off
      the main routes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can reserve me this room from the Tuesday."
    </p>
    <p>
      She arrived on the Tuesday, between tea and dinner, with
      one trunk, a suitcase and a hat-box, and she came down to
      dinner in a hat. She gave the head-waiter a one-pound note.
      "I should like that little table in the corner. I want to
      be quiet." Beacham had been head-waiter at "Fream's" for
      fifteen years, and he knew his English gentlewoman, and
      especially the aristocratic and sometimes eccentric
      gentlewoman up from her place in the country. "I think I
      can arrange it, madam." She appropriated the table, and sat
      down with her back to the room. She had a large mirror on
      her left, and in it she could see the whole dining-room
      reflected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chambermaid on the second floor noticed that Mrs. St.
      George spent a great deal of her time in her bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rarely went out. She kept her door locked. She sat in
      an arm-chair by the window, with the muslin curtains drawn,
      her gaze directed diagonally downwards at the doorway of
      Mrs. Sarah's shop. She kept a notebook and a pencil in her
      lap. She sat there for hours, deliberately vigilant, and
      learning to recognize many of the men in khaki who entered
      that shop more than once. When she had classed a man as a
      habitué, she would time the length of his stay, and make a
      note of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally she saw one of the girls, and on the first
      occasion that she saw Kitty, her face sharpened to a vivid
      alertness. Her eyes resembled two points of blue light.
      Kitty was dressed in black, and wore a black hat with a
      sapphire-coloured wing in it. She came out of the shop with
      the air of a young woman who had some definite purpose in
      view, and without pausing, walked down the opposite
      pavement. Mrs. St. George stood up, and leaning forward,
      looked down at her, seeing the little sturdy figure
      foreshortened. She looked at Kitty, and the contours of
      Kitty, with the eyes of a <i>sage-femme.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      No, the little figure below looked virginal. She carried
      her shortish skirt as a young girl carries it. Mrs. St.
      George had a glimpse of her glowing, vivid face. No baby
      there, no morning squeamishness, no significant something.
      And four months or so had elapsed since their marriage, and
      Alex had hinted--rather definitely--
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George sat down. Yes, that baby business was a
      painting of the lily, middle-class sentimentality used as
      that class might be expected to use cheap scent. Or was it
      possible that the girl had taken care to be on the safe
      side? Or, had she felt a little uncertain four months ago,
      and had found Alex and an abrupt marriage doubly
      reassuring? Mrs. St. George saw what she wanted to see, and
      her answer to any questions that she asked was like the
      answer in a French conversation book, waiting there to be
      read.
    </p>
    <p>
      For, certainly, she had her justifications. Had she put on
      the spectacles of an impartial observer, she would still
      have felt compelled to ask herself why dozens of officers
      entered Mrs. Sarah's shop during the day, and why a
      proportion of them stayed there long enough to sample half
      of the brands of cigarette that the shop supplied. And Mrs.
      St. George was not impartial. The back of her mind was
      occupied by red cushions, and two pretty girls, and a fat
      and sniggering old woman, and a collection of loafing men
      who were--well--just men. It all seemed so obvious.
      Moreover, she had received confidential reports from
      Messrs. Test &amp; Crabtree, and they had reinforced her
      determination to believe the very worst of No. 7 Vernor
      Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      As old Test had put it, puffing out his lips and then
      sucking them in--"Dubious sort of establishment--very. We
      have had it under observation for a month or more--now.
      Nothing definite, sufficiently definite yet. And one has to
      be aware of assuming the obvious."
    </p>
    <p>
      To Clara St. George the atmosphere of Mrs. Sarah's
      establishment was as obviously definite as the yellow
      rawness of a London fog. She could assume all that went on
      there behind those painted walls. High jinks! Abominable
      rowdiness. She was quite sure that men sneaked out of the
      house after dark. She had heard voices--rowdy
      voices--coming from an upper window; she felt convinced
      that they had come from Kitty's particular window.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Mrs. St. George's third evening at "Fream's" Corah came
      to dine with an officer, a captain wearing the ribbon of
      the Military Cross, and black and white chessboard flashes.
      Mrs. St. George recognized the girl's reflection in the
      mirror, but Corah did not recognize Mrs. St. George. She
      was not expecting to see Alex's mother in the "Fream"
      dining-room, tucked away in a rather badly lit corner, and
      with her back turned to the room. Corah was in evening
      dress, a cerise-coloured frock; she was going to a dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George enjoyed her dinner. She remained at her
      table until Corah Greenwood and her soldier had left.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she had a piece of good fortune towards the end of her
      stay at "Fream's," if the distorting of an infantile
      coincidence can be called fortunate. She saw Kitty leave
      No. 7 Vernor Street with an officer, a stout, thick-set,
      red-faced young man with very black hair. They were out
      together fully two hours, and when they returned--the
      officer followed her in! He stayed an hour. The same thing
      happened next day, only he called for Kitty after the shop
      was shut. They came back as dusk was falling. Mrs. St.
      George did not dine that night. She saw that thick-set,
      husky young man follow Kitty in through Mrs. Sarah's
      private doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George put her hat on, and going down, walked up
      and down Vernor Street. It was half-past ten before the man
      emerged from No. 7. A girl let him out. Mrs. St. George
      happened to be within a few yards of the door. The street
      was very dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So-long, Kitty--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good night, Grimmy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Could anything be more obvious! The girl had lovers. Mrs.
      St. George returned to her hotel.

    </p>
    <p>
      Lieutenant Grimshaw was unfortunately home on leave, with
      instructions from Alex to see Kitty and Mrs. Sarah, and to
      take Kitty out to a show if he cared to. Mr. Grimshaw
      turned up at No. 7 Vernor Street with his black hair very
      smooth, and wearing a new tunic, and introduced himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm Grimmy--you know. Lots of love from Alex."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was welcomed, especially by Kitty, who regarded this
      ruddy, cheerful young man as the nearest thing to Alex, a
      walking mirror in which she could catch a glimpse of Alex
      reflected. He was part of the life over there, part of
      Alex's life. She felt grateful to Grimshaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good of you to come, very. Mother's upstairs. You are one
      of the family, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked down at Kitty with his mischievous black eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--I have heard a lot about you, got quite used to your
      photo. Feels good to see you, though."
    </p>
    <p>
      She took him upstairs to Mrs. Sarah, who placed him in her
      catalogue, but on a page that was starred. He sat on the
      sofa beside her, and had her laughing before he had uttered
      ten words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we're mopping up old Fritz. You'll have Alex back
      again in no time."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was like a winter sun, round and red and glowing. His
      cheerfulness was not a pose; he could not help it. He was
      the most direct and trenchant thing in khaki that Kitty had
      met. He enjoyed the war, and said so.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great business. Better than sitting in my old pater's
      office down in Exeter, and trying to look solemn over a lot
      of dirty documents. That's what I've got to go back to."
    </p>
    <p>
      The thing that astonished Kitty was that the round,
      muscular, ruddy creature understood Alex, for understand
      him he did. There was a sort of affectionate twinkle in his
      eyes when he spoke of St. George, and Kitty made him talk
      about her husband. They went for a ride on the top of a
      bus, and had tea somewhere in Hammersmith, and walked all
      the way back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alex takes things so damned seriously."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know he does. Some men are made that way. He told me you
      helped him a lot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, stuff! Alex is one of those chaps who does things on
      his nerves. Did he tell you about that raid--just before I
      came across?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something about carrying a man in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, jolly plucky. It's the fellow who has to make himself
      do things--Finest sort of pluck--I mean. I'm just a bit of
      beef."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a dear," she said, and looked proud and a little
      fierce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--I don't know about that. Glad you think so. Alex is all
      right, you know. I father him a bit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on fathering him, Grimmy. It makes me feel better. I
      want him to come back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alex wants to come back. Don't blame him."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the second day Lieutenant Grimshaw had supper with them,
      and kept them all laughing till half past ten, when he
      departed to his hotel. Exeter and a devoted family expected
      him on the morrow. He promised to come and see them again
      at No. 7 on his way back from leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a good lad," said Mrs. Sarah.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was. But someone else was colouring Grimmy Grimshaw and
      others to look like raw flesh, and was putting them all in
      a letter--a most murderous letter.
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      III
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      It was like steel, that letter, deliberately and ruthlessly
      tempered. As a proof of her deliberation, it may be said
      that Mrs. St. George took a week to compose it, building it
      up sentence by sentence, polishing and improving.
      Dispassionately and lucidly written, and tinted with a kind
      of elevated affection, like the glow of sunlight upon icy
      peaks, it was devilishly clever. It assumed a duty, the
      carrying out of a devoted responsibility. It spoke as from
      a marble and maternal throne. "My dear boy--I am writing
      this for your sake." She did not accuse--she judged and
      condemned. She gave her son facts, or what she had every
      right to assume to be facts. She said: "I was determined to
      be sure. I set out to convince myself of the truth before I
      took this most serious step. I realized that I had no right
      to open your eyes unless I knew that I was showing you the
      truth. I have had the evidence of my own senses. I have not
      left the collecting of evidence wholly to others."
    </p>
    <p>
      Translated from the Smythian tongue, it set out starkly
      just what Mrs. Sarah was, and her house, and her daughters.
      She did not call No. 7 Vernor Street a brothel but the word
      was there none the less, trailing between every sentence.
      Mrs. Greenwood's daughters received men; you could call
      them lovers, if that sort of thing was love. The girl Kitty
      had exploited her son's sense of chivalry. But behind his
      back--! Rowdiness, men coming and going, sneaking out after
      dark, that old mother smirking over the business. A truly
      horrible establishment, tainted, sly, treacherous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clara St. George said nothing of the letter to her lawyers.
      She kept it by her for some days after she had completed
      it. She knew the risk she was taking, that she might be
      provoking a violent and unsavoury row that could be
      translated to the law courts. These women of Vernor Street
      might fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would let them. She thought she could produce enough
      evidence to tar and feather Mrs. Sarah's establishment. Her
      purpose was to destroy Alex's faith in his wife. A case in
      the courts would not tend to perpetuate a beautiful and
      foolish illusion, an act of war-madness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, she had convinced herself that she was in the
      right, and any impartial observer looking at the affair
      through Clara St. George's eyes would have agreed that she
      was right. Life is a question of points of view. Mrs. St.
      George had her own belvedere--or malvedere, if you care for
      a play upon words.
    </p>
    <p>
      She posted that letter on a serene September afternoon,
      walking to the nearest post office with the fatal thing in
      her hand. She slipped it into the box with deliberate, cool
      fingers. She had a faint smile on her face as she walked
      away.

      Alex's man, one Private Dipper--a Cockney with a queer long
      crinkled nose and a receding chin, had improvised a shelter
      for his officer under the branches of an apple-tree that
      grew on a grass bank beside the road. Dipper excelled in
      improvisations of all sorts; he was an ingenious and busy
      creature, moving about on long flat feet attached to legs
      that were calfless. He talked with a cheerful snuffle, and
      kept the stump of a cigarette tucked between his left ear
      and his crinkly black hair that refused to be disciplined.
      In cold weather he was apt to develop a dewdrop at the end
      of his nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      A ground sheet and some odd lengths of German telephone
      wire had gone to the making of the shelter, a spidery
      contrivance erected against possible rain. That the
      September sky was clear and innocent was no concern of
      Dipper's. He was interested in his eternal improvisations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lieutenant St. George sat under the apple-tree, and looked
      under the level sunlight at a piece of recovered France. B
      Company mess--a triangle of three officers--had taken its
      tea in the corner of a little wood of young oaks and
      birches a hundred yards down the road. The battalion was
      lying out for the night. At dawn they were to attack the
      village of Surenne, passing through the battalion that held
      the ground in front of them. Tanks were to share in the
      attack. It was to be a silent, stealthy, sudden affair,
      unpreceded by gunfire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dipper was showing great cheerfulness, perhaps because his
      officer was looking less cheerful. These stealthy affairs
      appealed to the Cockney's ingenious temperament. It made
      him think of sneaking out in plimsolls and kidding some
      "cop."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jerry don't like these catch-me-round-the-corner shows,
      sir. Not 'alf, 'e'll do a bunk. Windy. A few bloody
      machine-guns spittin' for two minutes. The rattle of our
      bloomin' ol' sardine-tins puts 'im rite orf it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably it would be so. The war had changed. Jerry had
      become a somewhat slinking and surreptitious person,
      swearing and scratching on occasions like a mad cat, but
      apt to vanish over the wall. He was leaving things behind
      him: guns, dead, wounded, prisoners, yellow-faced French
      civilians, girls with no heels to their boots, white sheets
      floating over houses and out of the windows, mute,
      bewildered, shabby villages. Dipper and his like had their
      tails very much up, scrawling chalked notices on captured
      guns.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the temper and compass of a man's courage should vary
      from day to day was one of those intimate and surprising
      discoveries that many a man made for himself during the
      war. The "I" in him blew hot and cold; it shivered one day
      and laughed the next; nor did it take its mood from the
      environment of the moment. Fear might come to you at night
      in some French village far behind the lines, and moving
      with cold and pattering feet upon the tiled floor, stand
      motionless beside your bed. It was as though courage, and
      the animal heat of it waxed and waned under the stress of
      the war, glowing and growing dim, as though some inward
      hand were turning the wick of a lamp. Those periods of
      dimness and of cold gloom were to many men hours of horror
      and torment. They saw themselves lying dead and stiff and
      sharp-faced in some trench, or perhaps they saw themselves
      worse than dead, disembowelled, ripped open, faceless
      horrible and mutilated monstrosities. And Alex St. George
      knew these fluctuations. He had one of these moods of
      indescribable and chilly gloom upon him now as he sat in
      the evening's light of that late September day, and looked
      across those empty and derelict fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      And why?
    </p>
    <p>
      He could say that he had missed Grimshaw, and the vivid and
      vital suggestiveness of the man. Grimshaw always seemed to
      give him something that he lacked. He had hoped to have
      Grimmy by him in to-morrow's show, Grimmy should have been
      back from leave yesterday; he had got held up somewhere on
      his way up, perhaps in that awful Somme country that lay
      behind them over yonder where the sun was setting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alex's glances had a flickering restlessness. He saw things
      very vividly, with a sharpness that seemed to suggest a
      curious finality--just as you saw a landscape before rain.
      The captured German howitzer in the field over there, like
      some huge and stumpy black beast with its snout poking at
      the sky; a broken tree splintered in the middle with its
      leafy top trailing on the ground; the roofs and gables of
      some village rising above hedges and fruit trees, with a
      great white sheet still floating from the church tower, a
      couple of tanks covered with brushwood on the edge of a
      wood; two of his men sitting on a bank with their shirts
      off, hunting for lice. The landscape seemed to end in the
      sunset and a blue-grey desolation. Full of men it might be,
      of lorries, mules, and transport horses all toiling
      eastwards, and yet it seemed empty. As empty as he was
      feeling, for his eyes saw himself in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Post ought to be up with the rations, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dipper's husky voice sounded very far away. Letters? Yes,
      letters. St. George had his wife's last three letters
      buttoned up in one of the breast-pockets of his tunic.
      Kitty's letters, dear, warm, human documents. As he sat
      there he tried to fix his consciousness on Kitty, to absorb
      the thought of her into himself, to be and to feel like
      Kitty. Almost he could pray to Kitty; he could kneel and
      feel those solid and protecting little arms of hers about
      his head. The thought of her steadied and warmed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For, to have great faith in someone is to have faith in
      one's self, and Alex had faith in Kitty. He believed in her
      reality. She seemed to be with him as a real presence under
      the most impossible and incongruous conditions, in some
      crowded hut in the thick of the war's most silly and
      exasperating and terrifying noises, under the stars in a
      black sky when a bombing plane boomed overhead. He hated
      those German bombing planes, because they reminded him that
      she might be in danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would try to warm his soul and his courage before the
      glow of her reality. He would think of her fine warm body
      and how he had lain with her in bed, and had listened to
      her breathing and felt the soft movements of her bosom. He
      thought of her hair and her dimpled shoulders, and the way
      she would put her two hands over his head. He thought of
      her writing those letters, sitting squarely at the table
      with its red cloth, the soft solidity of her, her round
      face giving him the impression of a glowing seriousness. He
      had always been in love with her seriousness, and those two
      very dark eyes under the straight, low forehead, and the
      mop of gold-brown hair. Honest eyes, steady eyes, eyes that
      did not lie to you. And her air of deliberation, her
      fearlessness! The war had made men cry out for the human
      shape in woman, but St. George's cry had been for more than
      a physical outline. He had the temperament that is called
      sensitive, and credulous. He wanted to idealize things. And
      he had idealized Kitty, the daughter of Mrs. Sarah who kept
      a tobacco shop in Vernor Street. And sometimes a sensitive
      intuition clings rightly to a belief in spite of the
      world's tarnished wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      He clung to the consciousness of Kitty. It would help him
      through that detestable dawn when he would get up and go
      forward into the chilly greyness. Mist over the
      fields--perhaps, and the misty figures of your men plodding
      behind over sodden grass. And the sudden "clack-clack" of
      German machine-guns, or the infernal rending thunder of a
      barrage.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pressed his clasped hands between his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I promised her and myself that I would not be mean," he
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he would get up and go forward into the greyness
      wherein would lie the village of Surenne, a little village
      full of fruit trees and dim white houses. He would be alone
      in front of his platoon, but he would not feel alone, in
      front of his platoon, but he would not feel alone. Even at
      such a moment he could be conscious of Kitty, the little
      woman whose arms--
    </p>
    <p>
      Private Dipper's husky voice broke his reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Letters, sir. Two for you."
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      Private Dipper knew as much about Mr. St. George as one man
      can know about another when he has brought in his
      shaving-water and made his bed, and cleaned his boots and
      watched his face, day in and day out, for the best part of
      four months. Dipper was a kind soul. He had his sentimental
      moments; he could make music on a mouth-organ and not being
      married and having no mother living, he would get up at
      "company" sing-songs and give way to husky emotion over the
      singing of wives and mothers. He felt protective towards
      his officer, and he behaved towards him as though he had
      lived three London lives before Mr. St. George had begun to
      live his one.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew that Mr. St. George liked to be left alone when he
      was reading those particular letters that came to him
      addressed in a round and very legible hand. His officer
      would have a certain look on his face "all shining-like."
      Private Dipper had seen Mrs. St. George's photo. He had let
      it be known in B Company that Mr. St. George's missis
      looked a "bit of all rite."
    </p>
    <p>
      The war was simple so far as the emotions were concerned,
      and yet so subtle in suggesting the complex
      inter-association of these very emotions. Man might marvel
      at himself, but the very intricacies of his deeper make-up
      were beyond him. Private Dipper went off to try and
      scrounge some cigarettes, leaving his officer under the
      apple-tree reading his letters. When he returned some
      twenty minutes later, in possession of three gaspers, the
      figure under the apple-tree had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bank bounding the road was some six feet high, too high
      for Private Dipper to see over it. Its top cut the trunks
      of a dozen or so old fruit trees--pears and apples--that
      made up a small orchard belonging to a cottage of timber
      and white plaster that had been wrecked by a shell. Dipper
      had explored the cottage in search of a possible billet,
      but the shell, having exploded inside it and made it a vast
      disorder of torn laths and furniture and timber and
      plaster, Private Dipper had found the place too complicated
      a ruin and beyond his improvisations. He stood there,
      vaguely alert, lighting a cigarette. Mr. St. George might
      have gone for a walk, for officers did go for walks during
      the war, and Mr. St. George had a fondness for prowling
      about by himself. He was what Dipper described as "a dreamy
      kid."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cockney had taken six pulls at his cigarette when he
      heard a peculiar sound coming from the other side of the
      high grass bank. The sound was peculiar by reason of its
      unexpectedness, and not because of its original quality.
      Private Dipper's spiky face sharpened attentively. He gave
      a sidelong upward glance at the grass bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later he was on the top of it, and looking down
      into the orchard. His little dark eyes seemed to grow
      narrow under the brim of his steel hat. Blimy! He did not
      utter that most eloquent word, but his face expressed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw the coarse grass, the old trees with their twisted
      and thickened trunks and the long shadows they threw, and
      the brown crater of a shell-hole with clods of earth
      scattered about it. Mr. St. George was lying on his right
      side under one of the trees. He lay in the shadow, with a
      bar of sunlight across his legs. He looked all twisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Private Dipper slithered down into the orchard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gawd, sir, you ain't been 'it? I 'eard no shell."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. St. George raised himself on a stiff arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Dipper; it's all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dipper was staring at that patch of something on the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was it your tea, sir? Something's disagreed with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. I've been sick."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can see you 'ave, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, he could see Mr. St. George's face, and it carried
      Dipper's thoughts back to bank holidays at Southend-on-Sea,
      and people going gaily for a sail, and coming back yellow
      and shrunken.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Adn't you better see the M.O., sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I'm all right, Dipper, now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You look pretty cheap, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, I'm all right--I'll lie here for awhile. You might get
      me my trench-coat."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dipper went for the coat, and returning with it and
      spreading it on the grass, suggested that Mr. St. George
      should lie on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just slip your arms into the sleeves, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      In helping him, he touched one of Alex St. George's hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord love a duck, but you're cold, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just a bit, Dipper. Being sick makes you like that. I
      shall be all right in five minutes. Thanks--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Couldn't you take a little drop of whisky? I'll run along
      to the mess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I'll just lie here, Dipper. Don't worry, that's a good
      chap."
    </p>
    <p>
      But there are occasions when a man feels that he has a
      right to worry and to disobey orders, and having tucked Mr.
      St. George up in his trench-coat and put his haversack
      under his head, Dipper went down the road to where B
      Company mess sat upon empty ammunition boxes under a young
      oak tree. Captain Horner of B Company was squatting on a
      box, writing a letter. A little, stout man, going
      prematurely bald, with very round blue eyes, he stared at
      St. George's servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beg pardon, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you want?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Horner had a natural abruptness, and the war had emphasized
      it. A bustling manner, a curt, snappy voice, and two
      staring blue eyes were part of the war reaction, natural
      qualities that had become over-emphasized by
      self-suggestion, and the habit of giving orders, and the
      suppression of certain indescribable physical qualms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. St. George's been took queer, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Queer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Queer was a vague and unsatisfying word, and Captain Horner
      disliked vagueness. It wasted your time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What d'you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. St. George 'as been sick, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sick!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'E's as cold as a bit of boiled fish. Says 'e don't want
      to see the M.O. Says 'e'll be all rite, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what about it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thought you ought t'know, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll come and have a look at him--in ten minutes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. St. George didn't want no fuss made."
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Horner snapped his blue eyes at Private Dipper. He
      wished to finish his letters, to keep his multifarious
      worries and responsibilities at arm's-length for five
      minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll come along."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Private Dipper saluted and departed on his flat feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Horner continued to scribble for two minutes, but
      becoming more and more conscious of Second-Lieutenant
      Sandys, who was sitting on another ammunition box with his
      back against the trunk of a birch-tree. Mr. Sandys' feet
      were pushed out; he had very big feet. He sucked at his
      pipe, and watched Captain Horner's pencil. He was waiting
      for something to be said, and Captain Horner became more
      and more oppressed by his consciousness of Sandys' ironical
      attention. He looked across at his junior; his blue eyes
      had a sulky glare; he did not like Sandys; in the war it
      was not comforting to have near you a man who possessed one
      of those narrow, superior faces, a man who sneered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" said Captain Horner's stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sandys drew in his long legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pity Grimshaw hasn't turned up. To-morrow's show."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite."
    </p>
    <p>
      Horner snapped both eyes and lips. Deliberately he folded
      up his letter, slipped it into an envelope, fastened the
      flap, wrote the address and signed the envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell Morgan to take the mail down to H.Q.--will you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sandys nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And don't be so bloody superior. See."
    </p>
    <p>
      And rising on his stout legs, and giving his round body a
      sort of heave, he walked out of the wood and down the road
      towards the orchard and the shell-smitten cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dipper, standing in the roadway, pointed the Captain over
      the bank. The glance that passed between the two men
      contained the beginnings of a smile, a smile in which mere
      mirth was merged into the largeness of a tacit human
      understanding. "'E's only a kid," said the private's eyes,
      and Captain Horner went over the bank and down into the
      orchard where the son of Clara St. George was sitting
      propped against a tree. A strange vacant face raised itself
      and was touched by the evening sunlight. It had a
      flaccidity, a whiteness, and wide and gentle eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo--George."
    </p>
    <p>
      St. George made a movement as though to get up. He might
      have been a man who had been knocked out by a heavy body
      blow, and was still feeling an emptiness and a
      bewilderment. Captain Horner stood over him, with his feet
      wide apart, staring kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't get up, old chap. You look rather cheap. What's the
      matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was aware of those wide, wavering eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing, sir. I have been--a bit--sick. I'm all right
      now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't look it, George."
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent down, and with a big red hand gripped St. George's
      wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're cold, man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I? It's nothing. Something must have upset me. I was
      quite all right. Shall be all right again soon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had better let the M.O. have a look at you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, really,--there is nothing the matter. I shall be
      perfectly fit--for the show."
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Horner straightened his round body, and looked
      bothered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about some dinner--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think I'll touch any food."
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly his flaccid, empty face seemed to grow tense
      and frozen. Pressing an arm against the trunk of the fruit
      tree he raised himself up, and stood on his feet. His eyes
      had a fixed and anxious look, as though he was not sure of
      his balance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite all right, Skipper, thanks. Think I might stroll
      back with you and have a whisky. Might do me good."
    </p>
    <p>
      Horner eyed him kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right you are. Nothing like a little drink--sometimes."
    </p>
    <p>
      St. George staggered, and then stood still for a moment at
      the bottom of the grass bank, and Horner was ready with an
      expectant hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Feel a bit squeamish--still?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, quite all right now."
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked down the road to the wood, moving with a
      suggestion of conscious effort, a man not quite sure of his
      legs--or of anything.

      III
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      Some twenty-four years ago, in the "blue room" at Melfont
      St. George's, a woman had given birth to a son. She had
      suffered perhaps more than most women suffer, but her pain
      had been physical, pangs of creation and of birth, while a
      September sun had risen steadily over the Melfont
      beechwoods, and played with fingers of light upon the great
      fish-pond in the green hollow below the house. It is said
      that women are more tolerant of pain than men, but the
      pangs of Clara St. George's labour were to be passed with a
      far more bitter anguish to her son. She had made alive, and
      in seeking to keep, she had stooped to kill. For what was
      it that she had wounded? What was it that bled? She had no
      knowledge of how he spent that night, lying stiff and
      still, staring straight up at the sky, while his men slept
      where they lay. He could not sleep. He had no wish for
      sleep. He lay and waited, trying to draw about his love the
      shades of a rent illusion. How much did he believe, and how
      little?
    </p>
    <p>
      If only he could speak to her, touch, see! But this
      horrible helplessness! To know that you might never know
      the truth! To be there waiting--like a beast for the
      slaughter-house, an intelligent quivering creature! To have
      to get up and go forward in the grey of the dawn, without
      hope, without the warmth of an illusion, with dull dread in
      your feet, and eyes that were empty! O, what a hell, a
      woman-made hell! How much did he believe, and how little?
    </p>
    <p>
      He kept looking at his watch, with its hour-points and
      hands dimly glowing. That watch had ticked away the hours
      beside their bed. He felt so empty. He was not conscious of
      fear; he felt too cold and too empty and too little alive
      to suffer fear. He lay like a man waiting for the end of
      something, the striking of a particular hour, some final
      and fatal act. He might never see his wife again; he might
      never be able--O, this damnable and filthy doubt!
      Helpless--? He was as helpless as a wretch tied to a stake
      on the seashore, and waiting for the grey sea to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would the night never pass! He felt so cold, so cold in his
      stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twice he got up, and walked up and down on the grass beside
      the road. He heard men snoring, blissful animals, stolid
      souls. The night was very still and grey, full of the new
      strange secrecy of the war's explicit. Not a Véry light,
      not the sound of a gun anywhere. He almost wished that he
      could hear that familiar clack-clack of a German
      machine-gun. It would mean that some live man was awake. He
      felt so dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      He climbed the bank to the orchard, and wandered aimlessly
      about among the fruit trees. What a place, what a night,
      what an emptiness!
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at his wrist-watch. Three o'clock. He supposed
      that over there in London Kitty was asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      His heart cried out: "Kitty, O--Kitty!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It could not be true. He leaned against the trunk of a
      tree, and gripped it with his arms, tried--as it were--to
      clasp to him the conviction that it could not be true. If
      only he had had Grimmy with him, someone to whom he could
      talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, a kind of flaccid calmness came to him. He felt very
      cold and strangely inert. He was conscious of nothing but
      that cold ache under his ribs; he was not conscious of his
      limbs. Almost, it was as though he did not care, had not
      the heart to care.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went and lay down again under the tree. He lay there for
      an hour. Presently there came a sense of stealthy movement,
      of dim shapes going to and fro. He heard a voice, subdued
      but authoritative; men stirred, coughed, muttered. The time
      had come; he rose with a sense of vague relief, as though
      something had been strangling him, a clutching hand. He had
      to act and to think. He heard his name called--"Mr. St.
      George."
    </p>
    <p>
      Quietly he answered: "All right--I'm ready."
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p align="center">

    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      They went forward towards the village of Surenne. He saw it
      against the horizontal greyness of the sky, lying at the
      top of a gradual and grassy slope, a few little white
      houses, some poplars, a queer slate-blue church spire. It
      had the softness of a pastel, and so had the sky, and the
      grass, and the trees. The landscape looked empty and
      peaceful and still, and he wondered at its stillness, and
      at himself, and at the war, and at the day that was being
      born. Over there on his right four tanks were roaring, and
      pushing their formidable and eager snouts up the hill. He
      did not seem to hear the noise the creatures made, nor the
      dull, quick plodding of the men behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a bullet, not a shell!
    </p>
    <p>
      He realized with a kind of strange anger that the Germans
      must have decamped from Surenne. The attack was a punch
      delivered at the empty air. Was it that he asked for
      tumult, opposition, noise, the stress of violent
      happenings, physical anguish? But this stillness!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was aware of voices, fragments of words and
      sentences--"He's done a bunk"--"Poor old Jerry"--"I could
      do with a hot breakfast." He swung on over the dew and
      grass. They came to little gardens, trees, the backs of the
      cottages; he went on like a sleep-walker up a narrow
      passage between two white plaster walls; he found himself
      in the village street. Emptiness, save for a tank cruising
      up it, its snout in the air like an alert nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was standing under a house when he heard that German
      shell in the air. It came as certain shells came, with a
      personal and paralysing directness. It was his shell. He
      did not throw himself down as the bunch of men behind him
      did. One of them had a glimpse of Mr. St. George going down
      on his knees and covering his head with his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shell struck the roof of the house, just above him, A
      piece of wall, pushed out by the explosion, slanted over
      and fell upon the kneeling figure.

      Kitty St. George crossed Cardigan Square. She paused for a
      moment on the paved path that skirted the garden railings,
      and let a taxi pass, and in pausing, her eyes raised
      themselves to the windows of No. 77. She was going to No.
      77. She had a letter to show to the other woman who was
      waiting for news from France. She stood in the shadow of a
      plane-tree, a little figure in black, staring steadily at
      those windows. Her round white chin seemed to jut out as
      she stood considering the case of this other woman whom the
      war had touched.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, that was the problem. Had it touched her? Had it
      touched her in the way that it would have touched nine
      women out of ten? Had she, too, sat and stared at that
      black curtain of uncertainty which was twitched aside
      momentarily and from time to time by an unknown and
      official hand? Had she sat and waited and wondered, like a
      child shut up in the dark?
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty stood back against the railings. She was thinking too
      of the pitiful and helpless thing that was her husband, a
      mere bundle of live tissues, an unconscious body passed
      from place to place, like a drop of dew running along the
      complex threads of the war's web. It was coming nearer and
      nearer. She had heard of that inert, stunned thing from St.
      Omer, Le Touquet, Boulogne. It would be carried back across
      the sea to her, a mere body that could not move or speak,
      more helpless than a baby, without memory, a vacant soul.
      How much had the other woman been touched by the thought of
      it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Her two hands grasped firmly a black and gold bag. She had
      two letters in that bag, one of them written to her by
      Grimshaw, the good Grimmy who had arrived in the village of
      Surenne less than an hour after Alex's wounding. "Grimmy"
      had gone through his friend's pockets before Alex had been
      carried to the dressing-station; he had walked beside the
      stretcher to the dressing-station; he had talked to the
      M.O. in charge of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I grabbed these letters out of poor old Alex's pockets.
      Rather a hateful idea--other people reading one's letters.
      I thought you ought to have them. Don't worry too much. The
      doctor man sounded quite hopeful. I still feel very sorry
      that I wasn't there when the thing happened."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear good "Grimmy." Of course he had not read the letters,
      and he did not know what he had sent to her. Three of them
      were letters of hers written to her husband; the fourth was
      the other fatal letter from the mother to her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty grasped her bag and crossed the road towards the door
      of No. 77. She rang the bell, and when the door was opened
      by a maid, she walked in past the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. St. George is in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Mrs. St. George was in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She expects me. Shall I go straight up? The drawing-room,
      I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl had a vacant face; she asked a perfunctory
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What name, please?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, you need not bother. I'll go straight up."
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not think of her act as a piercing of the other
      woman's defences, of a chance seized for close combat, for
      her mood was one of pity rather than anger. She had that
      abominable letter in her bag. She had been shocked by it,
      and by the righteous meanness of it, she had shown it to
      nobody. She had felt a little bigger than her normal self
      after the heat of her anger had passed. She was so full of
      the thing that had happened to Alex that somehow she found
      that she had no room in her for the lesser sorts of anger.
      Just as Alex had striven against meanness, so would she.
      Nor had she thought the matter out. She had obeyed a sudden
      courageous impulse that had urged her to go and face this
      woman and spread this letter before her, and to say: "I
      know. You have wounded me--almost beyond forgiveness. But
      what are you and I now? Isn't there something bigger for us
      to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an act of courage. She opened the door, and saw the
      other woman seated at her desk in the right-hand window.
      The sunlight touched her soft hair, and made a halo of it,
      and beyond her the autumn trees of the square floated gold,
      green and still. Kitty saw a pointed chin turned. A voice
      said sharply: "What is it, Parker?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have come to show you a letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked forward and sat down in a little, low armchair,
      with her handbag in her lap, and as she sat down Mrs. St.
      George stood up. She showed no astonishment. She remained
      looking down at Kitty as she might have looked at a
      governess who had come to be interviewed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Greenwood's daughter--? Of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty pulled off her gloves. She was deliberate. She opened
      her black and gold bag, drew out a letter, and held it out
      to Alex's mother. And she watched Mrs. St George's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George did not move.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it necessary? I mean--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were on the letter. She drew back a little, and
      very slowly--with almost conscious slowness--sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you would like to read it. It was written by a
      fellow-officer of Alex's--to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat regarding each other for a moment, but they seemed
      to look at each other through a sheet of glass. Something
      that was transparent but impenetrable separated them.
      Almost it might be said that they watched each other like a
      couple of women with a window between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "From a brother officer of my son's?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Grimshaw. Will you read it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She watched Mrs. St. George's eyes, and seeing them
      brightly blue yet veiled with many suspicions, she withdrew
      the letter, and returned it to her bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you might like to read it. Mr. Grimshaw took all
      Alex's letters and posted them to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew another letter from her bag, and let it lie on her
      lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There was this one."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George sat very still. The sunlight struck beams
      of light from an antique rose diamond ring that she was
      wearing. There were little glints of the same light in her
      eyes. She remained poised like a figure in a t<i>ableau
      vivant.</i> Kitty saw her through glass, a woman shut up in
      a cabinet, cold and watchful and still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty unfolded the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see? It came back to me. He must have read it just
      before he went into action. He had it in his pocket--when
      that shell--It must have been very horrible for
      him--because--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused. She was at white heat now, and her eyes never
      left the mother's face. What would this woman say, this
      woman sealed up in glass?
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw Mrs. St. George's lips move.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I ask why you have come here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not look at Kitty, but straight over Kitty's head.
      She did not see the quality of that firm, round face or
      gauge its glowing solidity, or how the dark eyes grew more
      round and deep and inexorable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because--I--mattered to your son. Because this letter is
      not true. Because--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Still looking over Kitty's head Mrs. St. George rose and
      went towards the window. She made no sound as she moved
      with that gliding walk of hers. She stood looking down into
      the square where yellow leaves were beginning to colour the
      grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you will excuse me--but I think we shall never
      agree--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She pushed back her hair from forehead with a gesture as of
      smoothing something out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can we agree? If you wish me to be frank.
      Perhaps--too--it would be better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As in this letter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly. I was well advised. I cannot withdraw anything,
      for I believe that there is nothing to withdraw."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean--that you believe--all that you wrote about me?"
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      II
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty sat squarely in her chair, clutching her black and
      gold bag, and looking like a little firm-faced and
      determined Madonna. She had become conscious of the room's
      oppressiveness, of its large and luxurious and stuffy
      hostility, as of the heavy hand being placed upon her
      mouth. There were a hundred things she wanted to say,
      indignant and generous and passionate things, but they
      struggled together within her in inarticulate confusion.
      She felt sealed up in this airless room, with a woman who
      stood at a closed window and with an air of detached
      attention watched the autumn leaves falling.
    </p>
    <p>
      What manner of woman was this, so smooth, so cold, so
      invulnerable? Had you screamed at her, she would have
      turned to look at you with impassive intelligence and an
      air of making allowances for a little common creature who
      did not know how to behave. And there was a part of Kitty
      that wanted to scream, to make a human and understandable
      noise. She wanted to break the glass case of this woman's
      stiffling composure, to push her fists through the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she held herself in; it would not do to let go, and she
      knew it. She clutched her bag. She said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry, but what you wrote is not true. I did not come
      here to make a scene. I have been trying to believe that
      you did not want to think that what you wrote was true.
      That would make things so hopeless for both of us, wouldn't
      it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George did not move.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You asked me why I came here. I came because I'm not the
      sort of woman you think I am, because I am thinking all the
      time of Alex, and of what I am to him, and what he is to
      me. Because--I am something to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused, her eyes looking very black in the firm pallor
      of her face. It was as though she had thrown a stone at a
      window, and was waiting to see whether the the glass would
      crack, or the window be thrown open by some hand of live
      indignation. Mrs. St. George made no sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought that after what had happened you might meet me.
      It did not seem possible that you could repeat these lies,
      the abominable things that you said about my mother. I'm
      thinking of Alex; I'm thinking of him as he is now. You
      must be thinking, too--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her ungloved hand twisted the velvet bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must be thinking. You know--how--he is coming back to
      us. Does it make no difference?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George turned sharply and looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely it does--But not--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How then--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To his mother--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty's eyes widened. She had the look of a live creature
      smothering beneath words, inarticulate, voiceless
      utterances.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was ready to tear up that letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood up suddenly. She crossed to Mrs. St. George's
      desk and laid her bag and gloves on it. She stood a moment
      staring at the papers on the desk. Then her fingers felt
      for the letter that she had put back into the bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said: "You have written those vile things to him about
      me. You say you still believe them. You do not love Alex as
      I love him. If you did, you would know how impossible it
      would have been for me to be what you think."
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to gaze and stood waiting, but Alex's mother,
      with a long pale hand laid along one cheek, seemed lost in
      a veiled and considering silence. She was still the woman
      in her case of glass, flawless and untouchable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that--really--why you came here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke softly--as to the glass of the window--or to the
      space of the sky beyond it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot believe that. I agree that the situation has
      changed. To be frank--my son is not--what--he was."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty faced her; her little body seemed to enlarge itself,
      and to grow more square and solid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can say that to me? Well, will you look, please?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She tore the folded letter across, placed the halves
      together and tore them across, deliberately and with a kind
      of leisurely but firm gentleness. She threw the pieces into
      the waste-paper basket beside the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You won't believe me even now--I suppose--when I have torn
      up what you wrote to him and given you back the pieces. I
      was ready--But that's all. I shall not ask you again."
    </p>
    <p>
      She picked up her bag and gloves, and went out of the room
      and down the stairs, and let herself out into the square.
      She closed the door gently. Mrs. St. George, still standing
      at the window, saw the little figure cross the square and
      disappear behind the iron railings and the smutty lilacs
      and privet hedges.
    </p>
    <p>
      She remained there for awhile with her hand to her cheek.
      Her eyes seemed absorbed in contemplating some, inward
      scheme, a picture of herself and her son, a picture from
      which the face of her son's wife was blotted out.

      III
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah had been to Highbury, and Highbury was to Mrs.
      Sarah what the trees and the green spaces of the Villa
      Borghese are to Rome. Yes, in spite of motor-buses, and the
      fading glories of Upper Street, and the increasing noise
      and a spreading mouldy shabbiness. Mrs. Sarah had been born
      in Highbury; she had been married from Highbury, and when
      Mrs. Sarah went to Highbury, it was to see Jenny, and to
      leave some question to be answered by Jenny's husband, who
      was managing clerk to a firm of solicitors in Austin
      Friars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jenny Parsons was a stout body, like her sister, but brown
      where Mrs Sarah was black, and less active on her legs. She
      had the same rather flattened and humorous nose, but she
      had not been able to live up to her nose, or down to it, as
      Mrs. Sarah had. She had a few airs and graces and a good
      many Victorian reticences. She liked lace curtains at her
      windows, and would have preferred to wear a veil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jenny could not refer to herself or to her nose as
      Mrs. Sarah referred to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I got it in Upper Street, my dear, poking my face against
      the shop windows. They were shops in those days. Do you
      remember that little toy shop near the station? Gone
      now--of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah loved Highbury and the Fields, and Upper Street,
      and the respectable dinginess of the Grove, and the Old
      Dickens's houses, and Canonbury Tower. Her love could
      include even the Holloway Road. She went to Highbury and to
      Jenny when she wanted a gossip, or was feeling bothered, or
      had some speculative inspiration to be passed on to Bob
      Parsons for his consideration. Bob Parsons was also her
      tipster. He was one of those dry, long men with acute noses
      who seem capable of detecting the smell of the sea before
      the Yarmouth train has reached Suffolk. Mrs. Sarah liked to
      spread herself on Jenny's sofa, and to loosen herself
      generally, and to air her varied British views, to be a
      Londoner of the Londoners, a woman whose secret inclination
      would have led her to shop in St. Paul's Churchyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get money. Go on getting money. It's like putting on
      weight, my dear, at a certain time of life, pleasant and
      comfortable. When people say some things about money, don't
      you believe them. Blessed are the poor. But are they? Let's
      be honest."
    </p>
    <p>
      On this October day, Mrs. Sarah had been to Highbury to
      talk of Kitty and Kitty's affairs, and the problem of a
      woman who had a steel rod in her back instead of a spine,
      and of a poor lad smashed up in France. She poured out
      herself to Jenny, and the pourings were ample and rich, a
      Roman fountain splashing wine instead of water. She had a
      good many things to say about Kitty. There was that in Mrs.
      Sarah that recognized the makings of a great woman in
      Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One blessed thing, my dear, no baby's expected."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jenny agreed that this was a blessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For as far as I can see, Kitty will have a grown-up baby
      to nurse. Poor lad. But she'll do it. She hasn't said so,
      but she'll do it. We Greenwood women--Jenny--don't let our
      men down. But how long is it going to last?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Parsons breathed heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a tax--and a young girl. I have always
      said--Sarah--and I always do say--that good health is half
      marriage--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it is. But if Kitty has to shoulder the other half--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's a determined little thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Determined! You should have seen her--at the age of
      six--when Corah tried to play with her doll."
    </p>
    <p>
      So, Mrs. Sarah kissed her sister, and trudged off down
      Highbury Grove in an atmosphere of autumnal wetness and
      dead leaves, and caught a bus by Highbury station. She was
      not worrying; she was not of the worrying sort; she got
      into the bus of life and sat down and felt solid and sure
      of herself. Hence her plumpness, and that merry eye that
      found time to look at the world and twinkle. She believed
      in all the things that Mr. Bernard Shaw loves to scoff at,
      but had he blown ever so hard he would not have shifted
      Mrs. Sarah. She was a solid woman and no feather.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vernor Street was full of the dusk when Mrs. Sarah reached
      it, that vapourish London dusk, hazing the lights and
      hiding the tops of the high houses. Also, it seemed full of
      whisperings and rumours, of a people's elation, of a sky
      that was clearing. Wonderful things were happening out
      yonder, but Mrs. Sarah was not thinking of the end of the
      war; she was thinking of her daughter married to a
      paralysed boy of five-and-twenty, and of what there would
      be for supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corah was in the shop, and Mrs. Sarah went upstairs and
      into the room where Kitty was sitting at the table where
      she was accustomed to sit when she wrote her letters. Her
      elbows were on the table, her two fists under chin. She sat
      in the gathering dusk, facing it and the future, and all
      the sudden problems that the future had erected in front of
      her stubborn little chin. A helpless husband, how helpless
      she did not know. But more than that, for when a woman like
      Mrs. St. George could persuade herself to write such a
      letter, a letter so abominable, and so responsibly clever--
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty looked at her mother. Each face was dim to the other,
      but between these two women there was an extraordinary
      sympathy. To Kitty her mother was real; she brought reality
      and liveness into that unlit room. Mrs. Sarah made no
      obvious remarks upon the absence of light. If Kitty chose
      to sit like that in the darkness she must have a very good
      reason for it. Mrs. Sarah just sat down in her favourite
      chair, took off her hat, and leaning forward, laid it on
      the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty's fists remained under her chin; she sat and stared.
      She said: "I've been to Cardigan Square."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah's silence was like a bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll tell you why I went. I had not told you. I thought
      there might be no need. It's like this."
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would never have believed that there could be such a
      woman. You see--she wrote a letter about me--about us--to
      Alex. It must have reached him just before he was wounded.
      Grimmy found it in Alex's pocket, and sent it back to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah was sitting very still, but her stillness was a
      very live stillness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A letter, poppet--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I took it back to her and tore it up. I
      thought--O--well--she's a bad one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me--just what was in that letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Kitty told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then that Mrs. Sarah let out a wholesome and
      human--"Damn." Her stillness vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! She wrote that of you--! Give me my hat, my dear,
      I'm going out."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a heavy woman and slow in rising, and before she
      could gain her feet, Kitty was upon her with arms and head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--mumsie, no--it's no good. I know. I--I want to say my
      prayers."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was on her knees, her bosom on Mrs. Sarah's knees, her
      face looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold my head, mumsie. I want to think. I have been
      thinking so hard, and things won't come right--somehow. O,
      that's good."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah was trembling just a little. She was a woman
      with large passions, not like that other woman. She pressed
      the girl's head between her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let it out, poppet. I'm here. I'm a solid person."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty grasped her mother's wrists.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mumsie, I've wanted to scream."
    </p>
    <p>
      How long they remained like that neither of them knew, but
      no one disturbed them, and the room grew darker, and the
      life of Vernor Street made a murmuring outside the window.
      And presently they were speaking to each other not as
      mother and daughter, but as two women who whisper together
      of intimate dear things. Kitty's elbows were on her
      mother's knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have got to get him back, mumsie. He belongs to me. He
      can't have believed--And I don't care what he is, he's
      mine; he counted on me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah kissed Kitty's hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We Greenwood women don't let our men down. As for that--"
    </p>
    <p>
      But she did not say what she thought of Mrs. St. George.
      She said things that were more helpful--practical human,
      sensible things.
    </p>

      "We'll have him here--of course. That's obvious. When the
      doctors will let him come. Poor lad. I don't suppose it is
      as bad as we think. Take life as it comes, my dear, day
      in--day out. Things have a way of getting themselves
      sorted."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty's strong little arms went suddenly round Mrs. Sarah's
      neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother--you're the dearest--that ever was. You're so
      live--You--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah's solidity seemed faintly to quiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not a tin goddess, my dear; I'm human. And that's
      that."

      Meanwhile, at Cardigan Square, Mrs. St. George, all in
      black and wearing her pearls, was waiting at her desk,
      holding a telephone receiver. She sat very still, but her
      stillness was that of a coiled spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was trying to place herself in touch with a certain
      important person, just before his dinner-hour. Doctors and
      persons of importance can be trapped at such an hour,
      though there are people who delay the capture until the
      animal in man is fed. Mrs. St. George did not do that. Food
      made no difference to her beyond adding slightly to the
      high light upon the tip of her nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      She caught her fish, deflecting him towards her voice, and
      she could make it a persuasive voice when she chose, the
      voice of a sweet woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, is that Sir Malcolm--? Yes, yes, this is Mrs. St.
      George. It seems such a shame to trouble you. But I'm so
      worried. You will let me know, won't you?--directly my boy
      reaches England--and where he is."
    </p>
    <p>
      A clear kind voice was heard to say that he--Sir Malcolm
      Strode--had given special instructions in the matter, and
      something sinuous and eager showed itself in Mrs. St.
      George's attitude as she listened. She unbent to that kind
      and important voice; her rigid spine became flexible.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you so much. How kind you are! It means so much. I
      want to see my boy--at once--You are trying to have him
      sent to Poynter's Hill? O, how considerate. O--Sir Malcolm,
      just one moment--I suppose in a week or two I can have him
      here? What? Supposed to be in hospital? Yes--I know. Red
      tape. But the war is going to be over, and he can have
      every attention here. You think it could be arranged? Yes.
      If he is quite unfit and likely to be so--for some
      time--Resign his commission--after he has been wounded? You
      think it might be arranged? Yes, yes. I'm so grateful.
      Forgive me for bothering you. Yes--good-bye."

      Mrs. St. George had influence. She knew people who knew
      other people who had only to say a few words or write a
      chit, and doors were conveniently opened. For regulations
      are fences erected to control the mass of unimportant
      citizens, who are passed in and out like cattle, good,
      orderly cattle. Mrs. St. George had the right to the
      private door; she had inherited that right, though
      somewhere back in the past her men had earned it for her.
      Hence she had news of Alex's a full two days before Kitty
      heard of her husband's arrival in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George borrowed a friend's car and drove to
      Poynter's Hill. She sat very erect, with a calmness of
      confident haste. She saw the red building, hideous and
      hard, detach itself from a group of autumnal trees, though
      other eyes might have fancied that the trees apologized and
      stood aside. "We hid it as long as possible from you.
      Here--it is." But a mother hurrying to see her stricken
      son, and to prepare the way for the possessing of him,
      needs no apologies for the landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her way was made easy. She was led along corridors, great
      white tubes of hygiene and cleanliness. In a ward that
      contained four beds, and four red screens neatly balancing
      each other, she found her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not prepared herself for what she might see, for
      she had no imagination. That she was shocked, as deeply
      shocked as it was possible for her to be, goes without
      saying, but her emotions were like the clashing of ice in a
      floe. That was her misfortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down beside the iron bedstead, and reached for one
      of the hands that lay on the red coverlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear boy--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her, and the quality of his stare caused her
      to experience a slight and icy shudder. His wide eyes were
      absolutely empty. They did not recognize her, but what was
      more terrible than the lack of recognition was their utter
      emptiness. There was not even a glimmer of curiosity in
      them. They saw and did not seem to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alex, my dear, don't you know me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She bent over him, and all that happened was that her head
      seemed to throw a slight shadow across his face. She drew
      back. She was supremely shocked. She did not know what to
      do, or say, or think. She was conscious of a cold
      indignation, but indignation against what! Her
      emotion--such as it was--could help neither her nor him,
      though had she sat and wept and patted that inanimate hand,
      she might have helped herself. And suddenly she grew rigid.
      She sat and stared at her son's eyes and was aware of them
      staring back at her unblinkingly. She struggled with the
      sheer clumsiness, the almost absurd incongruity of the
      situation. She felt baffled.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was this sense of bafflement that caused her to react as
      she did. Suddenly she knew herself to be in a white rage,
      seething with a passion to possess, to seize and carry off
      this inanimate thing. He belonged to her; he had belonged
      toher for twenty-four years. She was not a woman who had
      ever clutched her baby, but in some strange way she was
      urged to clutch her son. She thought but vaguely of Kitty
      for the moment. She was just a cold woman, an egoist, a
      flame with the glow of the Northern Lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      She became aware of people standing behind her, a doctor
      and a nurse. They had stood waiting with a sort of kind
      detachment. She turned in her chair and looked at the
      doctor's face. It was round and pink, a downy face,
      carrying a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew somehow and at once that this man was afflicted
      with a florid desire to please. He looked solemn and
      responsible and kind, and was facile. She said in a dry and
      self-controlled voice--
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is very terrible."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor blinked sympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does he understand--? Nothing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid--nothing, at present."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But will he--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw the round face grow vaguely pink under her gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, I think so. I have seen quite a number of cases,
      complete apathy, loss of memory, some paralysis."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But not permanent?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, or not wholly so. One has to be--a little--guarded."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly."
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned again and looked at her son. The rage to possess
      was becoming formative and articulate. She looked at him
      consciously and purposefully as hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You cannot say how long--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sometimes--the change is quite sudden. Just like switching
      on a light."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see," she said, and mused a moment, aware of the fact
      that those two eyes had closed, and that the face of her
      son had an extraordinary passivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nurse went round to the other side of the bed and
      smoothed a sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would not hurt him to be moved--I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The round, bland forehead wrinkled itself slightly,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Moved? But you see--this is a special hospital, and
      officers--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know. I am not asking about your regulations."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, quite possible--I think. If expert nursing--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you. I wondered. Of course--I do not intend--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He would be much better here--naturally, until--I quite
      understand. I am sure you are all very kind."
    </p>
    <p>
      She kissed her son on the forehead, and he did not open his
      eyes. She re-entered her car and was driven away from the
      red hideousness of Poynter's Hill, her thoughts full of an
      orderly haste, blown steadily across her consciousness like
      clouds moved by a north wind. She knew now exactly what she
      had to do; she had her pots and pans ready to her hand; she
      was a good organizer. And she wasted no time. She set about
      putting her plan into action with the bleak white haste of
      a blizzard. She did not drive direct to Cardigan Square.
      She stopped the car at the end of Westminster Bridge and
      directed the chauffeur to drive her to the particular hotel
      where Sir Malcolm Strode served his country. She clove her
      way to the holy of holies. She was urgent and coldly
      passionate. She talked Sir Malcolm over. He reacted to her
      maternal suggestion that he should persuade other people to
      arrange things for her. He was tired and busy, and she was
      asking him to do for her what was human and reasonable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drinking her tea before the drawing-room fire, she
      considered the multifarious details of her plan, and jotted
      them down in a notebook. She paraded before her mind the
      person and temperament of the family physician, one--Dr.
      Dazely--who lived in Wigmore Street, a bland man with a
      round head, who was very particular about his clothes, and
      whose wife had social ambitions. Mrs. St. George needed a
      bland man, a man who could be persuaded to accept her
      rulings, and who had soft and well-soaped hands. She
      thought that Dr. Dazely was just the man for her. She rang
      him up after tea and asked him to dine with her. She told
      him that she wanted all his advice and support and
      co-operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came. He was a large man with two rather ambiguous brown
      eyes tucked deeply into a plump and pallid face. He was a
      little over-tailored, and his manners were like his
      clothes. He was too impressively polite. He gave the
      impression that he always wore patent-leather boots and
      wash-leather gloves, because the feet and the hands of his
      immediate ancestors had been of common clay. His speech was
      flowing, a bouquet, for he could not forget that his
      grandfather had kept a fish shop somewhere in the Midlands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George gave him half a bottle of the best
      Burgundy, and two glasses of old port. She knew her man.
      She apologized for not asking Mrs. Dazely, but hoped that
      both the doctor and his wife would dine with her next week.
      She told Dr. Dazely just as much as she thought it was good
      for him to know. She painted a picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wanted him to take charge of her son's case. She wanted
      his advice as to the conversion of her drawing-room into a
      nursing-room, or rather a nursery, for her paralyzed son.
      She wanted the best and most reliable male nurse in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Dazely looked politely blank over the procuring of a
      male nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear lady--but they are not to be had. Almost
      impossible--just at present."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It cannot be impossible. You can get me one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll ring up the agencies and the institutes I go to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want a particular kind of man, patient but
      strong-minded. I do not mind what I pay."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her energy blew like a north wind, and for the next two or
      three days it continued in that quarter. She had her
      drawing-room pulled to pieces and transformed into a
      bedroom, transferring herself and her desk and her papers
      to a room that overlooked the garden. She had new patent
      locks fitted to the street and area doors, and one to the
      room that was to be a grown man's nursery. Once a day she
      rang up Sir Malcolm Strode. She made inquiries about motor
      ambulances. She sent Dr. Dazely down to Poynter's Hill to
      see her son and the medical officer in charge of the case,
      cautioning him to say nothing about Alex's probable
      removal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Energized by her, Dr. Dazely produced from somewhere one
      Leaper--a male nurse. He came to be interviewed by Mrs. St.
      George at ten o'clock on a November morning. He had a
      square, pale face above a square body, a baldish head, two
      accommodating pale blue eyes, and a lower jaw that--opening
      and closing as on a hinge--worked like a trap. His voice
      was husky. He had much assurance, but could temper it, and
      control a rather impertinent loquacity. He called Mrs. St.
      George "Madam" on every possible occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George observed his boots, his collar and his tie.
      He wore that knobby sort of boot that associates itself
      with tender feet, but his boots were well polished. In
      spite of his dubious, pale eyes, his references were
      excellent.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told Mrs. St. George that he had specialized in the
      nursing of mental cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reading both the references and the man, she said that this
      would be a case of unusual responsibility. It might include
      more than nursing. It might demand the keeping at arm's
      length of undesirable persons and influences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Leaper understood her at once. His pale blue eyes were
      full of intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have had experience, madam. I have had to protect some
      of my gentlemen. You can rely on my discretion." She did
      not push the matter any further, but she did state that
      efficient service would receive substantial recognition.
      She called it a gratuity; she named a figure. And she saw
      something more in the pale blue eyes like a snaky thing
      uncoiling itself behind glass. She struck at the thing at
      once, not to kill, but to contain it in a proper service.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall expect you to show every kindness to my son. It
      will be a very sad and difficult life--for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Leaper made a little bowing movement in his chair. He
      had a smile that came and went as though pulled with a
      string, and when he smiled his square fat face seemed to
      perspire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm naturally kind, madam. One is of no use--in my
      profession--without it."
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      When Kitty came to Poynter's Hill and was shown that figure
      screened off in the corner of the brown and white ward, she
      stood for a moment with her eyes looking down at her
      husband, seeing all that Mrs. St. George had seen, and
      more, and seeing it differently. She had a moment of caring
      as she had never cared before. There was that in her which
      went out to him, and hovered, wondering at itself, and
      losing itself in poignant wonder. She was conscious of the
      two persons in herself. The nurse had warned her, but how
      can emotion be warned off, or the shock of seeing things as
      they are?
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down. She spoke to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alex dear, it's Kitty."
    </p>
    <p>
      His ears were as fast closed to her voice as his eyes were
      to her face. Even while uttering those words she had been
      somehow aware of their pathetic futility. He did not
      understand, could not understand. There was an immense
      silence, uncrossable space between them. His eyes just
      stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt appalled. She was aware of a sense of horror, not
      of him, but of his helplessness and of all that it might
      mean. She saw to-day, to-morrow and the next day, and that
      vacant face and those flaccid motionless hands. She was
      afraid, but with such a passion of warm fear that she was
      able to rise above it. Her heart rushed to the rescue. All
      her sturdiness seemed to stiffen with a new obstinacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew her chair close to the bed and sat holding one of
      his hands. She observed him with a kind of tender and
      intimate calmness, a sacred compassion. She felt herself
      being wedded a second time to something that was helpless
      and pitiful. She saw him somehow as her business in life,
      her job, her justification. If she thought of all the
      sacrifices, the difficulties, the baulkings, the
      wearinesses, that might lie before her in the future, she
      thought of them with that strange consecrated courage of
      which some women--and especially little women--are capable.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not speak another word. She sat holding his inert
      hand and holding it hard. She was no more than a gentle and
      determined presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she talked to herself. She said things to herself that
      would be repeated to no living creature. She was alone with
      a helpless child. And before she left, she did get
      something from that vacant face, a little flickering smile,
      not of recognition, but of vague pleasure, the kind of
      smile an infant gives when its new senses are pleased by a
      bright object or a soft sound. It went to her heart. It
      made her conception real. It made her feel as a young
      mother feels.
    </p>
    <p>
      She bent down and kissed him.

    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards she talked to the man with the gold spectacles.
      He was guarded and worded. He tried to be as comforting as
      professional caution would allow him to be. He was very
      cautious. "It is what we call a stupor. Last? Well, I hope
      not; often there is a sudden clearing of the mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      She asked him what the afterwards might be, and he looked a
      little bothered, like a wise owl in broad daylight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, he may be quite normal. Mentally. Yes. But we cannot be
      sure. One does not like to make promises. At present--I
      suspect--a possible paraplegia."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had to explain the word to her. It meant paralysis of
      the legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will not be able to walk?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, we don't know yet. It depends on organic changes, how
      much injury there has been to the spinal cord. We shall be
      more sure of that later."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not say anything to Kitty of Mrs. St. George's
      visit, or of his interview with Dr. Dazely, and she went
      back to Vernor Street steady-eyed, and clasping the
      helpless body of her love. She was full of courage.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah often asked herself in after-years what might
      have happened if Kitty had not gone down with influenza on
      the day after her visit to Poynter's Hill. It was the
      influenza of 1918, sudden, prostrating, venomous, and for
      two days at least Kitty was almost beyond worrying about
      anything. She lay in confusion and the dullness of high
      fever, and Mrs. Sarah nursed her, for no other nurse was to
      be had.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Kitty could blurt out--"Have you been?" And Mrs. Sarah
      had to go to Poynter's Hill and look at Alex, and be looked
      at vacantly by him, and feel more bothered than she had
      ever felt in her life before. Heavens! but what was Kitty
      going to make of that poor, brainless, paralyzed thing?
      What a marriage! What a problem!
    </p>
    <p>
      On the fourth day Kitty threw off the fever. She seemed to
      fling it out of the bed with a pair of wilful hands. She
      insisted on sitting up, with two round black eyes in a face
      of chalk. She was indignant. It was no time to be ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah was packed off again to Poynter's Hill, and
      discovered blankness. Mr. St. George had been moved. Yes,
      yesterday, by ambulance to his mother's house. But, surely,
      his wife had been notified?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah said things to herself, and also to the matron.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a plot. What right had she to have him moved?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was a very disturbed and angry Mrs. Sarah who
      returned to Vernor Street, and to Kitty. She found herself
      repeating the same refrain. "She's got him. Damn her, she's
      got him!" And what was she going to say to Kitty?
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt very hot and tired. She sat down on the red settee
      in the divan and told Corah to shut up the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And get me a glass of port, my dear, and a biscuit."
    </p>
    <p>
      Corah looked a little anxiously at her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have caught Kitty's 'flu."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit of it, my dear. I'm tired, and in a hell of a
      temper. That woman has walked off with Alex, carried him
      off like a mouse. Damn her! She's used some back-door key."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Taken him away from the hospital?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just that. She's in possession. She's got the goods, and
      is sitting on them. Damned clever of her. But what the hell
      am I to say to Kitty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She took off her hat and fanned herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come. I mustn't use this language. At my age--! Get me
      that glass of port, poppet, there's a dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had attained to a sufficient state of coolness,
      mental and physical, Mrs. Sarah talked it over with Corah,
      who had a more impartial head than either her mother or her
      sister. It seemed to Corah that it was a question for the
      lawyers to deal with. Mrs. St. George had succeeded in
      impounding a son; you could not very well enter a house by
      force and carry off a helpless and paralyzed man, and if
      you did--what were you to do with him? Obviously, Mrs. St.
      George was no fool. The woman who happened to be in
      possession of Alex was the woman in power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah, still looking very angry, had to agree.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall go up and see Bob Parsons. Kitty has her rights as
      a wife. But I shan't tell her just yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      So, for two days, Mrs. Sarah and Corah dissembled, and Mrs.
      Sarah went to Highbury, and staying to dinner, laid the
      case before Mr. Robert Parsons, who considered it over the
      bowl of his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said it was an awkward business. He would like to take
      an opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take the best opinion in London, Bob. I'll pay."
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she told Kitty, a Kitty who was sitting up in bed
      in a jade-green jacket, looking thin and white, "Just like
      a determined little saint in a glass window"--as Mrs. Sarah
      put it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alex has been moved, poppet."
    </p>
    <p>
      And to Kitty came one of those instant revelations. She
      seemed to know what was in her mother's mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's got him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my dear. I'm afraid she has."

    <p>
      Of many things--sentimental and otherwise--that happened
      after Clara St. George's recovery of her son, Vernor Street
      had not and could not have complete knowledge. Kitty's head
      went back to her pillow for seven more days, and during her
      relapse, Mrs. Sarah--who pitied both the victims of this
      marriage--opposed herself to Mrs. St. George, who pitied
      neither. But she was met by a woman as determined as
      herself, and one who had organized all the advantages of
      position and prestige, and who stood on the battlements of
      her strong tower and challenged interference. Mrs. Sarah
      might ring the bell of No. 77 Cardigan Square. A little
      brass grill had been let into the front door through which
      visitors could be inspected, and Mr. David Leaper--having
      assumed the duties of confidential man-servant as well as
      those of male nurse, and having been sent to inspect and
      familiarize himself with the persons of Kitty and her
      mother--had repulsed Mrs. Sarah from behind a locked door
      with those apocryphal words--"Not at home."
    </p>
    <p>
      That little brass grill sobered Mrs. Sarah. It symbolized
      the other woman's seriousness. It made Mrs. Sarah feel that
      somehow she was back in the Middle Ages when young girls
      were shut away behind high walls. It was ridiculous and it
      was appalling. She let herself go to sister Jenny.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think of it, my dear! A woman fitting a thing like that to
      her front door! In these days, too, when you can get into a
      taxi and go and get married all in ten minutes. But it
      shows how little we have changed. There are plenty of women
      who would be Bloody Marys if there were no Bow Street."
    </p>
    <p>
      Baffled and barred out, and unable to come to personal
      grips with the woman in possession, Mrs. Sarah had to fall
      back upon Mr. Robert Parsons and the Law. She too had a
      dignity of her own, and a proper sense of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm blessed if I am going to stand on her doorstep."
    </p>
    <p>
      She wrote a letter to Mrs. St. George and sent it by
      registered post. It was a letter of common sense and of
      some dignity. She received no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down and wrote a second letter. She said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are we going to settle this matter like reasonable women,
      or is it to be a question for the lawyers? I have as much
      right to think of my daughter as you have to think of your
      son. Heaven knows this marriage looks like being a rather
      tragic business without our making a Montague and Capulet
      affair of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      This time she received a reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. St. George begs to inform Mrs. Greenwood that her
      lawyers are Messrs. Test &amp; Crabtree of Lincoln's Inn."
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had received this letter and looked at Kitty who
      was sitting up in bed with an air of white determination,
      Mrs. Sarah went to Highbury. She sat in a tapestry chair,
      with her feet on a white hearthrug, in front of a
      comfortable fire, and talked to her sister. Later she was
      to talk to brother Bob.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of all the preposterous situations! And yet--it is pretty
      pitiful, my dear--for both these young things. If I didn't
      feel the pity of it I should feel inclined to say to
      Kitty--'Cut your losses and clear out. This marriage is bad
      business.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jenny was conventional, but gently so.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marriage is marriage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is, and it isn't, my dear. But in Kitty's case--it's
      the one big business. We Greenwoods don't like to be
      beaten. I have a feeling that she will go right through
      with it, to the end--bitter or not bitter. Though what is
      she going to get out of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jenny supposed that Kitty might yet get everything out
      of it. Women did--somehow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah looked grim.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what the men like to say. Sweet, devoted womanhood!
      But, confound it!--we are such mixtures. You wouldn't
      say--would you?--that there was a little of the man in
      Kitty, and yet there is. She is one of those who wants her
      job, and will have it--before God and the devil. Well, what
      time do you expect Bob back?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll hear his key in the lock at six. There never was a
      man of more regular habits."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In spite of the war--and Armistice night!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We sat in front of the fire on Armistice night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you, now. Well, I don't know that you weren't wiser
      than the people who went to Piccadilly Circus."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Robert Parsons returned at six. He was a dry,
      dusty-coloured man with a stoop; his eyes seemed lost under
      languid eyelids. Strangers frequently made the mistake of
      thinking that they had a slow and easy man to deal with in
      Mr. Parsons; in the face of aggression he would appear to
      droop, but at the proper moment his eyes would open; he
      would uncurl himself; his long blunt nose would appear to
      enlarge. In the early stages he would allow the other
      people to do the talking. No, Mr. Parsons was a very sound
      man. He knew how to make the most of his cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper, sitting deep in a comfortable chair, dryly
      self-confident, he gave Mrs. Sarah a considered opinion
      upon Kitty's case. He advised an action in the Probate and
      Divorce division for the restitution of conjugal rights,
      while endeavouring to bring out in the course of the
      proceedings the facts, and to get such relief as to access
      and maintenance as the law might be disposed to give. Also,
      the parties interested in the husband might under pressure
      deem it advisable to compromise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty was entitled to maintenance, but she could not compel
      her husband to live with her, or force her presence upon
      him against his will. And at present he seemed to have no
      assets and no will. Just so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty had no claim upon Mrs. St. George. The son appeared
      to be entirely dependent on the mother, but Alex St. George
      would presumably be entitled to some compensation or
      disability allowance as an officer, and this should extend
      to his wife. Nor was Kitty the legal guardian of her
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah listened with an air of solidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it comes to this. She's got him--and she can keep him,
      unless we bring an action. And she would do her best to
      dirty our linen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt she would."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And as to conjugal rights, the poor lad's not capable--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That seems to be the position. It is a rather unusual
      position. We might get the marriage annulled."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah squared her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's for Kitty to decide. I don't think the law gets us
      very much further, Robert, thanks all the same. We'll wait
      to see what Kitty's got to say."
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Alex St. George lay and stared at life like a
      very young child, as though trying to understand it. He
      stared at his mother; he stared at Leaper; he stared at Dr.
      Dazely, and appeared particularly interested in the
      doctor's monocle. He could move his arms, but not his legs,
      but seeing that his mentality was still that of an infant
      the paralysis of his legs did not concern him. He had no
      speech, and was mostly mute, but would make occasional and
      friendly noises. He showed a desire to finger things, and
      even to put them into his mouth. He had to be washed and
      dressed and fed. He had forgotten completely how to do
      things for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaper had an oily and cheerful kindness. He was the
      sinuous and persuasive autocrat. He called Mr. St. George
      "sir," though he might just as well have addressed him as
      "it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, sir, chin up a little--if you please."
    </p>
    <p>
      He shaved his patient each morning with a safety-razor, for
      Dr. Dazely had been very particular in his warnings that
      Mr. St. George must not be allowed to be in the possession
      of any cutting implement. The lathering of his face seemed
      to puzzle and interest Mr. St. George. He would dabble his
      fingers in it, and examine the white froth that adhered to
      his finger-tips, and sometimes he would taste it. He made
      attempts at conversation, exclamatory noises that sounded
      like "Goo," and "Da."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaper encouraged these noises. He was facetious, and his
      facetiousness contained a bland contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite so, sir. Goo, goo. I agree with you ab-so-lutely.
      Now--for a little towel."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George would come and sit in the transformed
      drawing-room that had become an elaborate and costly
      nursery. Her favourite place was by one of the windows and
      she sat there rather like a woman on guard. Her whole
      attitude expressed a cold and possessive tranquillity; she
      would sit there for an hour on end, watching Cardigan
      Square, and her son, like a white cat with round blue eyes,
      strangely and possessively satisfied. It was a silent room.
      Even as a young mother she had had no baby-talk, and to her
      man-baby's pathetic gooings and daaings, she would extend a
      calm and consenting tolerance. Whether she wanted him other
      than he was it would be difficult to say. Sometimes she sat
      by the fire and purred with the consciousness of complete
      possession. She had purchased the most expensive gramophone
      that could be bought, and a set of popular records. She
      would rise and place a record on the disc, adjust the
      needle with deliberate and precise fingers, and let the
      room fill with sound. Tunes familiar to thousands of
      homesick men were repeated in that special room, "Roses in
      Picardy," "I'm in Love," "Fancy your fancying me." Alex
      would listen wide-eyed; he liked these melodious noises;
      sometimes he would smile, and glance about the room as
      though wondering how and whence the sounds originated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes she showed him pictures, the kind of pictures
      that are shown to a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Dr. Dazely had said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "If the mentality remains as it is--he will have to be
      re-educated. Yes, everything. He will have to begin over
      again like an infant. Learn to talk and to read and to
      dress himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. St. George was in no hurry. She seemed to revel in
      the cold glow of complete possession. Never was a child or
      a grown man more wholly his mother's. He was her prisoner;
      he had no will of his own, no purpose that could clash with
      hers. Never had she been so complete an autocrat.
    </p>
    <p>
      For she was the woman in possession. She felt that she had
      those other women beaten and baffled; they could not storm
      her house and carry off this poor paralyzed thing; she
      doubted whether--after a little grim dissuasion--they would
      want to do so. Mr. Test had thrust out his lower lip and
      looked at her archly. There was no doubt that she had done
      a very clever thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Discourage 'em, Mrs. St. George, and go on discouraging
      'em. Leave the legal part of it to me. If they try to work
      up a case, we can obstruct 'em at every turn. We can go on
      obstructing until they are tired and their purses are
      empty. Worry them; make 'em realize that it's a bad
      business, a poor speculation. When they realize that there
      is nothing to be got out of it--You take me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She did.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want them--eliminated."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her slyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much so? You still wish--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A divorce would be final."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nursing a stout knee, he ruminated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes--I think the wife would have a case, if she chose to
      plead that her husband was incapable of fulfilling the
      contract. Beat 'em first, and then dangle a bone. They may
      be precious glad to get the bone and go off with it.
      Meanwhile--if they try to make trouble--I'll give them
      obstruction--and more obstruction."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, she thought that she had Vernor Street shut up. She
      could sit and contemplate the gradual closing of an
      unpleasant episode that had ended with the war. If
      necessary she could re-express herself in the re-education
      of her son. What an opportunity for a woman of
      five-and-fifty! To have her son given back to her as a
      grown man to be moulded, recast, treated as flexible metal!
      A son who might never be complete, and so all the more
      hers. She compounded with her pride; her pride should be in
      possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      He should have every opportunity, of course. She would give
      him every advantage that did not clash with her prejudices.
      She could make life easy for him, fatally easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke very seriously to Dr. Dazely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you--perfectly--satisfied?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Dazely was not. The case was an extremely responsible
      one; that is to say he had accepted his responsibility with
      well-tailored seriousness. He said that he would like Sir
      Isidore Browne to see Mr. St. George. Sir Isidore's opinion
      was the very last thing in opinions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George agreed. Sir Isidore Browne was called
      in--an abrupt little man with a huge nose separating two
      sharp and irritable little eyes. He passed an hour with Dr.
      Dazeley beside Alex St. George's bed. They sang a duet over
      him, Dr. Dazely booming and fluting, Sir Isidore snapping
      like a mandolin. They disentangled the complexities of the
      case, its possible neuropathic aspects, its electrical
      reactions, its mental phenomena. They spoke of stupor and
      amnesia. Mr. St. George had an undoubted paraplegia. There
      was definite spasticity of the lower limbs. The knee jerks
      were exaggerated, especially the left one. Babinski's sign
      was present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Isidore probed the case like a bird tapping with a hard
      but sensitive beak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must have the spine X-rayed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Dazely fluted consentingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, we must have him X-rayed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The point is--how much of all this is organic and how much
      of it is functional. There--is--an organic lesion. The war
      has given us some extraordinary examples of hysteria. As
      for the mental condition--it may change quite suddenly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have warned his mother. It may be a case for
      re-education."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Possibly. But I have seen the normal personality restored
      by some shock, emotional or otherwise. If there is no
      change we ought to try hypnosis."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you suggest it to Mrs. St. George?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Isidore made the suggestion, but Mrs. St. George
      received it with dislike and suspicion. Hypnosis implied
      surrender--and interference. She had thought it tarnished
      with charlatanry. But if modern hypnosis was scientific and
      professional, was it not also dangerous and too personal?
      She mistrusted the reaction of another personality upon the
      personality of her son. Deep down in her was the
      consciousness that if there was any hypnotizing to be
      done--it was she herself who wished to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would prefer to wait. Let us see whether a change for
      the better does not come naturally."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Isidore was a busy man and apt to be impatient.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, very well, the case is in Dr. Dazely's hands.
      He understands it perfectly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Which was true, but Dr. Dazely did not quite understand the
      inwardness of Mrs. St. George.

      The solving of problems is supposed to be the prerogative
      of the very clever, but in the solving of the problems of
      our human relationships, love, compassion and understanding
      are still supreme. Yes, and in spite of the highbrows, and

      ceased to care seriously about anything, and because their
      organs have lost the warmth and the flush of the adventure
      of digestion. Hence, when Kitty rose from her bed, and
      began to feel hungry, she tore down the logic of the law as
      though she had put her hands to a pair of curtains that
      kept out the light and the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      She refused to be legal. Having listened to all that Uncle
      Robert had to say, and heard his arguments, she swept the
      whole clutter aside. If she was going to fight for the
      possession of her husband she would fight in her own way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Robert Parsons, dryly kind and requiring everything to
      be in order, asked her what she could do; and she sat and
      stared at the table-cloth with obstinate solemnity. She
      stared at a particular ink-stain that she had made one day
      when writing to Alex.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's for me to find out."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was more open with her mother. She said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not going to fight her in that way. It seems to me to
      be the wrong way to go about it. I don't know, but I feel
      that there are some things about which one can't quarrel in
      public. I'm not going to scuffle with her, as though we
      were two women squabbling over a bargain at a draper's
      sale. I care too much. That's reality."
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not say more; she had no more to say for the
      moment, but Mrs. Sarah understood. Kitty was not going to
      soil her linen; she had no intention of recovering it
      draggled from under Mrs. St. George's feet. She was full of
      a conscious reverence for her marriage as it had happened
      to her. She was thinking of Alex as she had seen him at
      Poynter's Hill. Her love was silent, and reflective and
      determined; it did not rush out to scream and scold and
      argue. Her argument was locked up inside her, but it was
      very much alive, a gradual growth. She was one of those
      little women who can watch and wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calmly she went back for the time being to the shop and her
      work. She seemed to carry a hidden lamp, and the flame that
      she tended burned within. She kept her dignity. She was
      very conscious of the fact that the life of Vernor Street
      had changed, and was still changing. The war was over, with
      its tenseness and its terror and its physical excitements,
      though a desire for these excitements remained. Men in
      khaki and out of it came into the shop--but they came
      differently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of them were in quest of adventure. They suggested
      dances and little suppers; they bored her; man had lost the
      supreme significance of the soldier; nor could she pity
      these lads as of old. Her pity was turned like a beam of
      light upon that other figure. It bothered her to have idle
      young men lolling about in the divan, or trying to be
      seductive across the counter. All this smelt of the war,
      and the war was over. Also, it was possible that Mrs. St.
      George had spies in Vernor Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty suggested to her mother that the divan should be
      closed, and it was closed. A card bearing the word
      "Private" in big black letters was tacked to the door, and
      when one or two Breezy Berties tried to walk through that
      notice, Mrs. Sarah dealt with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The closing of the divan marked the end of an epoch. The
      room of the red cushions had had its justification during
      the war, but when Mrs. Sarah closed it, she could do so
      with confidence. She had made money. She could talk of
      selling the business, but when she did talk of it, and of
      the social advantages of being a lady at large, Kitty's
      little fist came down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not on any account. Besides--you would be miserable. I can
      see you in a villa at Surbiton."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah wrinkled up her broad and human nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm a Londoner, my dear. No getting away from it. But when
      you and Corah have homes of your own I may go to Highbury.
      Highbury isn't what it was--but it pulls me. Besides--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will always be wanted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Somehow, my dear, I think I shall. And that reminds me.
      I'm not going to die with all my rings on my fingers. No
      sense in that. When you and Corah want it, there will be a
      nice little sum for both of you. Every girl ought to have
      some money of her own. So you see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see all sorts of things," said the daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      And once a week either she or Corah were seeing the face of
      Alex's jailor, Mr. David Leaper, who came to buy cigarettes
      and to take a look round. He was a confidential person. It
      was he who reported to Mrs. St. George that the divan had
      been closed, and that her son's wife was still serving in
      the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, Mr. Leaper got to know Kitty very well by sight,
      though she knew him only as a rather soapy person with a
      sudden smile, who came to buy a certain brand of cigarette.
      She saw so many unlikeable men that Mr. Leaper was without
      distinction. But one December day, standing at a window in
      the midst of a yawn, Leaper caught sight of that little
      figure with its back to the railings of Cardigan Square.
      His mouth seemed to shut with a snap. He drew back a step
      and stood watching. He expected to see "That yellow-headed
      young woman," as he called her, advance to ring the bell of
      No. 77.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Kitty did nothing of the sort. She stared at the house
      for half a minute, as though she was looking right through
      the walls into the heart of it, and then she moved away.
      She had been conscious of a moment of inspiration.
      Something in her had cried out "Of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Leaper reported the incident to Mrs. St. George.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That young woman, madam, has been hanging about."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George did not appear to be troubled by the
      incident. She knew that Kitty might stand there all day,
      but that her son could not get to the window, and that had
      he been able to reach the window and see his wife he would
      not have recognized her. His memory had not returned. It is
      possible that his mother hoped that it would never return.
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p align="center">

    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      That was Kitty's point, the live core of her problem. She
      had realized it gradually, and then with a final and
      complete suddenness, and on that December afternoon when
      Leaper saw her standing by the railings of Cardigan Square,
      she took the problem away with her to Queen's Walk, and sat
      with it on the same old seat. A huge red sun was descending
      into a bank of grey vapour; the fronts of the houses were
      flushed with the sunset; the grass had a bluish tinge. And
      the vividness of the London sunset matched the vividness of
      her inward realization of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Alex remained the Alex of Poynter's Hill--then he was
      lost to her. He would remain in the house of his mother,
      remembering nothing of his marriage, and of its intimate
      moments. The Alex who was her husband would be dead. Mrs.
      St. George would have regained her child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes--if--?
    </p>
    <p>
      But if his memory returned, if the old Alex came back to
      that paralyzed body--what then? He would remember her, and
      that letter. And still he would be like a helpless child in
      that other woman's lap, to be coerced and persuaded and fed
      as his mother would wish him to be fed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must get him away from her," she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how? And to what purpose? And supposing she were to
      succeed in recovering her husband, was she to take him to
      Vernor Street, to a back room overlooking brick walls and
      chimney-pots, to a home that was not hers in the sense that
      a woman desires a house to be hers? It would be like
      shutting up a poor, brown-eyed rabbit in a hutch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her inspiration grew. It even seized something from the
      possessive cleverness of Mrs. St. George.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must do something, make something. I must have a place
      to take him to."
    </p>
    <p>
      From that moment her increasing purpose began to shape
      itself.

    <p>
      Hanging in what had been the drawing-room of No. 77
      Cardigan Square, in a recess between the fireplace and one
      of the windows, was a painting in oils framed in a
      ponderous frame of gold. Mrs. St. George had won this
      picture in a raffle at a bazaar. It had been painted by an
      artist of some note, one Waterfield, who would spend his
      springs daubing among the Italian lakes, and who liked his
      colour plastered on like whipped cream. This particular
      picture showed you a crimson rhododendron flowering in a
      huge stone jar against a dark sheaf of cypresses. The
      artist had been intoxicated by the gorgeousness of the
      massed blossoms, and had let the colour erupt upon his
      canvas. And yet in spite of its floweriness it had a
      massive quality that was increased by the heaviness of the
      frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      About twelve o'clock on a December night this picture
      snapped its wire, and came down with a crash upon a little
      table loaded with bric-à-brac. Leaper, sleeping in a little
      odd room across the landing, heard the noise, but not being
      a very bold person, in spite of his prominent jaw, he sat
      circumspectly on the edge of his bed. If burglars were in
      the house--!
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the bedroom on the floor above Mrs. St. George had
      been roused by the crash. She was a woman of courage.
      Moreover, the silence that had followed the fall of the
      picture was broken by a sudden outcry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one was shouting wildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George hurried into a dressing-gown, and descended
      the stairs. She had a vision of Leaper switching on the
      light on the landing below, and wearing a grey flannel
      sleeping-suit. The outcry continued. Almost it suggested
      the screaming of a terrified child waking suddenly from a
      nightmare. But the voice produced sounds that were
      intelligible.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where am I--Kitty--Kitty--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaper got first to the door, but he was not allowed to
      enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, stay outside. I will see."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had opened the door. He gave a push to it, and stood
      aside, and she went in as though he had ceased to exist for
      her. She closed the door. The cries from the bed continued.
      He heard her switch on the lights. There was a moment of
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alex--my dear boy--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother!"
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      II
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden reopening of the door caught Leaper in the act of
      withdrawing from a position of too intimate a curiosity. He
      drew himself up like a soldier coming to attention. He was
      aware of the fixity of Mrs. St. George's gaze. Blue-eyed,
      she was confronting the storm that had burst suddenly in
      the house, a woman blown about by the wind, yet unconfused
      by it. She had an air of gripping something, of holding
      herself rigid, while she steered her purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can go back to bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      That was all she said to him, and he went. But even when
      the clothes were pulled up under his chin, he continued to
      listen like a man overawed and dominated by the skirling of
      the wind. He had heard things, words, fragments of anguish
      blown about like sea-scud. Behind that smile and that
      snapping jaw, he was a rather soft and succulent creature,
      greedy and obsequious, a little emotional. There are
      certain sensitive and organic spasms that are beyond a
      man's control, and Leaper had shivered. He had felt a
      coldness down his spine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those outcries, those gropings of a man suddenly dragged up
      into the light! He had heard Mr. St. George panting.
      "What's happened? I--I can't move my legs. How--how--!" And
      then--suddenly--Mr. St. George had been sick with all the
      sounds of an immense nausea. And between the retchings and
      groanings there had been words. "O!--Lord--O, my God!--I
      remember. It wasn't true--what you wrote in that
      letter--mother? You know what I mean. Say it wasn't true. I
      got it--just before--But where was it? I was being
      sick--just like this--under a tree--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaper shivered slightly in his bed. He could picture Mrs.
      St. George grabbing a basin, and holding Mr. Alex's head.
      And that voice of hers, like a steady and controlling hand
      exerting pressure. O, yes, she was in control of the
      situation, a most efficient woman, a formidable woman--
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      III
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George sat holding her son's head against her
      shoulder. It was a most conventional attitude, but, to her,
      feeling elemental was to be outside the conventions. She
      spoke soothingly. She had turned off the ceiling lights,
      and left the shaded globe burning on the table beside the
      bed. Like most women of her type--and they are legion--she
      was the incarnation of a purpose. She urged and she guided.
      She was not so much conscious of her son as a separate,
      quivering, human entity, as of something that was attached
      to her, something that had come out of her body. She wanted
      to possess him, to contain him--mentally if not physically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be afraid. Let things come easily. Of course--the
      shock of it--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Both her voice and her arm exerted pressure. He had become
      quiet. His recovered consciousness, thrown suddenly to the
      surface, had ceased to cry out and to struggle. It floated,
      relaxed and bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But--mother, I want to know about--things."
    </p>
    <p>
      She said: "My dear, of course you do. But there is no
      hurry. Just try and lie still."
    </p>
    <p>
      And all the while she was striving towards the creating of
      her woman's impression, to stamp it indelibly upon the wax
      of his recovered consciousness. She was doing what all of
      us do, and if challenged--fiercely deny the doing of it.
      She understood that the first impression might be of
      supreme significance. The thing had to be done delicately;
      she was no charwoman with a brush.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to hear about--things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What things--dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "About--how I came here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I brought you here from the hospital."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the war?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The war is over."
    </p>
    <p>
      The news seemed to astound him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We won--? They gave in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long have I been--like I was?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For weeks. Ever since--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt a trembling of his body, and she took one of his
      hands. She was moved; her inward qualms were fierce and
      combative.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear," she said; "don't worry. Let things come easily.
      I'm here; I shall always be here."
    </p>
    <p>
      His hand lay limply in hers. She was aware of a new
      silence. It made her think of a little dark hollow like an
      empty sack into which you could drop what you pleased.
      There were questions which he dared not ask, but he was
      breathless to ask them. His reawakened consciousness was
      all interrogation. It was a raw surface that asked to be
      covered. And this raw surface was her opportunity. She was
      aware of all this--as women can be--and feeling the urge of
      her own awareness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said: "Don't you think you could go to sleep?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His answer was immediate and poignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've been asleep all these weeks. Has--she--been here to
      see me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      The word slipped out. She was committed to it, and to feel
      committed is to feel the more convinced. She was right, she
      insisted on being right; she clutched her rightness and her
      son.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not once?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once--at the hospital."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave the impression that these facts were being dragged
      from her. She felt out of breath with her effort, for an
      effort it was. She showed emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alex--dear, don't ask these questions to-night. Try and go
      to sleep. Leave things over--I'll sit here."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent for some moments. He seemed to be slipping
      down into a stupor of realization.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only once. But--mater, hasn't she tried?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George grew rigid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, I won't talk of this to-night. I refuse to talk
      about it. I have got you back--from the war. I won't
      have--these--these--sordid facts--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a kind of quiet little moan, and turned his head so
      that his face lay against her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      At eight o'clock next morning Leaper came softly into the
      room to pull up the blinds and let in the greyness of a
      December morning. He too looked grey, though he wore a suit
      of blue serge. He moved softly, with an ingratiating
      discretion, and even his handling of the blinds was
      tactful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning, he found the eyes of the man in the bed fixed on
      him, and Leaper unhinged his smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, sir. I'm Leaper, sir. I look after you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. St. George did not reply. He lay very flat in the bed,
      and his eyes went to the familiar windows, and the outline
      of the naked trees in the square. Leaper's smile
      disappeared and came again. He was sorry for the man in the
      bed, as sorry as his profession would allow him to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you like a cup of tea, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. St. George's glance wandered about the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long have I been here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some weeks, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were you in the war?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I was just too old, sir. And I was wanted badly--at
      home. Yes, I'll clear up all that mess, sir, presently."
    </p>
    <p>
      For the man in the bed was looking at the picture where it
      still lay face downwards on the floor, together with the
      various objects it had knocked off the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what brought me back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir. Strange coincidence. If I may offer my
      congratulations--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. St. George's eyes seemed to open very wide; the lids
      made a flickering movement. And suddenly those eyes grew
      moist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks. But--not much--to be congratulated--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaper, looking shocked, went swiftly out of the room,
      mumbling something about a cup of tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had gone, Mr. St. George lay still for a while,
      staring at the ceiling. He was aware of his fears and
      strangely unashamed of them. They blurred the white surface
      of the ceiling; but what did it matter, for was not
      everything blurred, confused, horrible? He was conscious of
      a weight inside his head. His whole head felt heavy, too
      heavy to be raised from the pillow. But could he raise it?
      He made the attempt, and found that he could, and going yet
      further, dug his elbows into the bed, and managed to raise
      himself a little. But his legs? They lay there stretched
      out like a couple of sandbags, and suddenly he fell back,
      letting his head sink deep into the pillow. He turned his
      head so that his face was half-hidden in the pillow. He
      caught a fold of the case between his teeth, and lay rigid,
      trying to stifle a part of him that wanted to shout for
      help. And the cry that rose on him was for "Kitty--Kitty."
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained like that for a minute. The lower jaw relaxed;
      he turned his head slowly, and lay again looking up at the
      ceiling, at that blank white surface. His face had an
      extraordinary tremulous wistfulness. He seemed to be
      whispering, but without making a sound. A man's phrase--a
      war phrase--seemed to trickle into his head. Everything was
      na poo, a wash-out. His marriage--He felt empty, like a
      body without a stomach. His head began to ache.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaper came in with the tea. It was an obsequious and
      persuasive Leaper who encouraged him to drink it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's it, sir. You'll feel better, sir. Do you think you
      could bear to be shaved, sir, presently?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave me alone for a bit, will you, there's a good chap."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to think--try to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, sir. I've brought up a little handbell, sir.
      I'll put it here. If you want me--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right. Is--my--Mrs. St. George up yet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir; I think not, sir. Here's the bell, quite handy.
      And what time would you like your breakfast, Sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, any time, Leaper."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaper had left Mr. St. George less than five minutes when
      the handbell was rung and the male nurse hurried in to see
      what Mr. St. George's need was.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to write a letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A letter, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get me some note-paper. Do you happen to have a
      fountain-pen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaper bustled about. He had to raise Mr. St. George in
      bed, and prop him up with an additional cushion or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How's that, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Splendid. I'll ring again when I want you, Leaper."
    </p>
    <p>
      He wrote his letter to Kitty. It was very simple and
      straight, the kind of letter that he might have written to
      her had nothing of this happened to him. Its message
      was--"Kitty, I want you. I'm in the dark; I'm lost. Where
      are you?" When he had fastened up the envelope, he
      remembered that he had neither stamps nor money. But what
      did that matter? He rang the bell for Leaper, and lay
      looking at the address on the envelope, "Mrs. Alex St.
      George, No. 7 Vernor Street."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaper stood in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Put a stamp on this for me, Leaper, will you, and post it
      at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At once, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alex St. George let himself sink down in the bed, much as
      though he had accomplished some notable thing, and could do
      no more for the moment. His head ached and he felt full of
      a dull confusion. The effort of writing that letter, those
      three minutes of mental and emotional concentration, had
      exhausted him. He heard the shutting of the door, and he
      closed his eyes. He thought--"She must come to me now. If
      she cares--she will come. But why didn't she come before?
      That letter--? O--impossible! And yet! And yet?" He felt
      more and more confused and weary--Meanwhile, Leaper was
      standing on the landing with the letter in his hand, and
      Mrs. St. George was descending the stairs. Leaper did not
      offer to show her the letter, but he stood and held it so
      that she could not fail to see it. The responsibility would
      not be his.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw it instantly, but she did not at once betray her
      seeing of it. She spoke in a controlled, maternal voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Mr. St. George awake?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madame. He has had a cup of tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I meant to have been down sooner. I was very tired. I was
      with him till four o'clock. He fell asleep. What is that,
      Leaper?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He handed her the letter, and his voice was subdued.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. St. George has just written it, madam. He asked me to
      post it."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at the address on the envelope. Her face had an
      attentive calmness. She moved on to the next flight of
      stairs, making a sign to Leaper. He followed her down to
      the dining-room, where the table was laid for breakfast.
      She told him to shut the door. She stood in front of the
      fire, looking down at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leaper, your other responsibility begins to-day. Do you
      remember what I said to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to fascinate him with her complete calmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam. Undesirable people--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite so. My son must be protected--from these people. Any
      letters--such as this one--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Deliberately she bent down and put the letter on the fire,
      watching it blacken and curl and burn. No words were
      needed. Leaper understood; he backed softly to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me, madam--but what am I to tell Mr. St. George if
      he asks me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke as though giving him an order.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If Mr. St. George asks you--you will of course tell him
      that you posted that letter."

    <p>
      For two days Alex St. George lay and watched the rain come
      down. The grey of the December sky did not cease to empty
      itself upon the tops of the plane-trees, and the man in the
      bed felt the drip of it inside his head. He was suffering
      from a mental confusion. His thoughts seemed to drift about
      in a fog with a sense of difficulty and distress. The
      realization of what he was and what he might be lay heavy
      upon him, pressing him down into a pulp of lethargy and
      depression.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one glowing point in this confusion was his thought of
      that letter to Kitty. If she was lost at sea, this was the
      one light that remained. And so he lay and waited, unable
      to do anything, with a head that ached, and thoughts that
      drifted vaguely. He could make no effort of any kind; he
      felt even more helpless in the presence of his mother; her
      blue eyes looking down at his seemed to congeal and to
      render him mute. There were moments when he wanted to tell
      her--"I have written to Kitty. I want to see Kitty;" but he
      had not the will-force inside him. His lips could not even
      begin to shape the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Dazely came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alex liked Dr. Dazely. He was soft and sententious and
      kind, dangerously kind. He demanded no effort. His large
      white face and fluty voice were soporific.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't worry, my dear sir. Perfect rest--perfect rest.
      Leave everything to us."
    </p>
    <p>
      To Mrs. St. George Dr. Dazely said that it was imperative
      that her son should be sheltered from all excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In these cases--you know--the mentality cannot be
      considered normal. Months, perhaps, a question of months.
      They are apt to be irritable, moody, emotional. I want him
      to be wrapped up in cotton wool."
    </p>
    <p>
      She asked for nothing better than counsel such as this. She
      would apply the cotton wool; she would shut out the world,
      and all jarring emotions; she felt that she had been
      justified in burning that letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      She asked Dr. Dazely to give very definite instructions to
      Leaper. Such orders--professionally given--would reinforce
      her own, and Dr. Dazely did so. Mr. St. George was to be
      humoured in every way, as a sick child is humoured, but
      behind this humouring was to be careful and kind restraint.
      No letters, no visitors, no excitements.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cotton wool, Leaper, cotton wool."
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Mr. St. George lay and waited. That speck of
      light in his confused world still glimmered. On the third
      day he asked Leaper questions, but he asked them like a
      sick man, with a kind of deprecating gentleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No letter for me, Leaper?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one has called?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one. Only Dr. Dazely, and one or two ladies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What kind of ladies?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Elderly ladies, sir, friends of Mrs. St. George."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause, and Alex's fingers picked nervously at
      the bedclothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You posted that letter, Leaper?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which letter, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The one I wrote--that morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of that third day, while his mother was
      below--dining--Mr. St. George called Leaper to him. He was
      very restless; his eyelids flickered; his hands could not
      keep still.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to write another letter, Leaper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You oughtn't to tire yourself, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must write it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaper shrugged the shoulders of his soul, and humoured
      him. It was a scrawl of a letter, excited, pathetic, hardly
      legible, and when it was finished and fastened up, it was
      placed in Leaper's large damp hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At once--Leaper. Don't tell anybody."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaper went out of the room, and Alex St. George lay and
      listened. He heard the opening and closing of the front
      door, but he could not know that Leaper had indulged in a
      piece of make-believe, and was tiptoeing into the
      dining-room. Mrs. St. George was alone. Without a word, and
      as though the thing was burning his fingers, Leaper placed
      the letter on the table beside her plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at it, and said nothing, but later that evening
      she rang for the male nurse. She was seated at her desk;
      she held something crisp and white in her right hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said: "Loyal service is appreciated."
    </p>
    <p>
      She passed him four five-pound notes.

    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      And Alex St. George lay and waited, with toys and luxuries
      beginning to accumulate about him. Two ingenious tables had
      arrived, that could be swung across the bed and tilted at
      any angle, and with one of these tables on either side he
      had only to stretch out a hand to turn on a gramophone or
      pick up a book or a magazine. There were no less than a
      dozen magazines on a table. He was allowed to smoke, but
      the silver cigarette-box that contained the different
      brands of cigarettes made him think too much of Vernor
      Street. He had fruit and flowers within reach, jig-saw
      puzzles, writing-materials, papers, tobacco, matches,
      chocolates, a morning and evening paper. Twice a day Leaper
      massaged his paralyzed legs. He had his nails manicured. He
      could watch the flames of a cheerful fire leaping in the
      grate.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother's kindness smothered him. It smelt of flowers
      and fruit, and of the finest of soaps. It showed him all
      the world in pictures; it gave him music to which he could
      not dance. He could draw the softest of crimson-covered
      down quilts up under his chin, and yet he lay inert and was
      dully conscious of a helpless crave in him, of an
      increasing sadness. He was like a man slipping slowly down
      a well, while the little circle of light up above grew less
      and less, and as it diminished he began to realize the
      nature of the surrounding darkness. Kitty had not come to
      him; she had not replied to either of those two letters;
      therefore--all that his mother had charged her with--He
      tried to struggle against an increasing loss of faith in
      her, but his struggles were not those of a normal man; he
      was weak, far weaker than his normal self; he was
      irritable; he had moments of anger when he told himself
      that he did not care.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one afternoon, when the windows were darkening, and the
      plane-trees in the square were growing dim, his mother
      found him in tears. She pushed a table aside, and drawing
      up a chair, sat down, bending over him. He jerked his face
      away, but he began to blurt out scalding words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's true what you wrote. She hasn't been; she hasn't
      written. I couldn't have believed it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George laid a hand on his head
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She shivered inwardly, for her purpose was ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why--why--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the little wailing boy who cried to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alex--I had better speak. Isn't it obvious? She saw you
      once, the difference in you. And then--I suppose--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to cower down in the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mater--how horrible!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear--I'm sorry--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was sorry; she was being wounded, shocked, but she set
      her teeth. She was in the right a thousand times in the
      right; she was being cruel to be kind; she would hold him
      from these women, from that deplorable war madness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alex, my dear, do you remember--I used to tell you that
      you were blind? It hurts you now--to see. But it would hurt
      you more--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned suddenly to her in the dusk that wavered with the
      flicker of the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have they done nothing--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The girl came to see me--once--but before she had seen you
      at Poynter's Hill. The mother tried to see me--afterwards.
      I'm a rich woman, Alex--and you--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She made herself meet his dim, wide eyes. They were
      frightened eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it--that she didn't want me any more--when I was like
      that--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George was silent, and her silence was the most
      eloquent and the most comprehensive of answers.

      Meanwhile, Kitty clasped her problem much as she had held
      her husband's head in her arms. She took it to bed with
      her, and it kept her awake, and she woke with it in the
      morning, and it sat squarely at the breakfast-table staring
      at the bacon dish or the pot of marmalade. Certainly it was
      a devil of a problem. She was alone with it; she had
      brushed the lawyers aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the chief difficulty remained in that she had no
      knowledge of her husband's condition, and whether she was
      to plan for an infant or for a man. Alex was shut up in his
      mother's house, and she was shut out of it. She could
      presume from the fitting of that grille to the front door,
      and from Mrs. Sarah's experience, that it would not be
      possible for her to surprise the defences of No. 77. It was
      a ridiculous situation, an exasperating situation. She
      could watch the house and see who went in and out.
      Assuredly a doctor would be one of the visitors to No. 77,
      and she would have every right to accost the doctor who was
      in charge of her husband's case, and to question him.
      Letters--of course--would be useless. If Mrs. St. George
      was as determined as she--Kitty--knew herself to be, then
      all letters to Alex would be censored, and the forbidden
      ones stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had decided to waylay Alex's medical man when an
      unexpected ally appeared at No. 7 Vernor Street, even Mr.
      Jimmy Grimshaw, demobilized, but still in khaki for a
      month, and spending a week in town before solemnly
      incarcerating his cheerful and warlike soul in the city of
      Exeter. He came in, red and smiling, more polished than
      usual, to grip her hand across the cigars and cigarettes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jimmy--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She glowed. She looked into his droll, ironical, honest
      eyes, and held his hand firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The very man I want."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good business. How's old Alex? I suppose--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to tell you about Alex. They have taken him away
      from me, Jimmy."
    </p>
    <p>
      She took Mr. Grimshaw upstairs, and Corah went down to take
      charge of the shop. Mrs. Sarah was out shopping. Kitty made
      Grimmy sit down in the best chair, the chair that had been
      re-sprung and re-upholstered since Armistice Day; she
      pushed a box of cigarettes at him, and taking one herself,
      rolled a tuffet into the middle of the hearthrug, and sat
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want you to go and see Alex for me, Grimmy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right-o. Some hospital?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, at his mother's. I had better tell you all about it,
      Grimmy. I know you will believe that I am telling you the
      truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy Grimshaw did know something about women; or
      rather--he had that peculiar male flair for divining the
      real inwardness of a woman. He was not concerned with woman
      as a creature of emotional subtleties or aesthetic or
      intellectual tendencies; he was concerned with the good
      'uns and the wrong 'uns, the givers and the takers. He was
      a young man of a good deal of self-assurance. He sat back
      and smiled, and kept quiet, and watched Kitty. She told him
      the amazing story, and he believed it, just as stoutly as
      he believed in the reality of that solid little figure on
      the tuffet, with the glow of the firelight on its
      determined face. Kitty was no wrong'un, and she was very
      much up against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said: "What a damned shame! Do you mean to tell me that
      she has got poor old Alex shut up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has shut him in--and she has shut me out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, my dear Kitty, such things aren't done in a civilized
      country."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But they are done. You remember those letters you sent
      back to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had the most difficult part of the confession before
      her, but she went through it with deliberate courage, while
      Mr. Grimshaw sat tapping a khaki leg with a cane. He looked
      just a little more red in the face. His fighting
      temperament kept step with Kitty's. Under his breath he was
      referring to Mrs. St. George in the language of the
      fighting male, as a red she-dog--language that would grow
      less colourful and more chaste in that Exeter office.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So--you see--Grimmy," she was saying, "I don't know
      whether he is as I saw him at Poynter's Hill, or whether
      his memory has come back. I want to find out."
    </p>
    <p>
      His dark eyes lit up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But aren't you going to fight?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I'm going to fight, but in my own way; I have
      had my legal opinion, and I've turned it down, Grimmy--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat and stared at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what am I to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want you to go and see Alex. Most probably they will let
      you see him. And you can come back and tell me."
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a last smack to his leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right-o. I'll go--at once. I'll raid their defences. By
      Jove, what a woman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's right--in her way," said Kitty; "just as right as I
      am in mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      He must have hurried, for he was back with her in a little
      over the hour, sitting in front of the fire, and looking
      sobered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told Kitty that he had taken a taxi both ways. Yes, he
      had not found it easy to enter the house; they had kept him
      waiting on the steps--a fellow with a bad breath had spoken
      to him through a confounded little squint-hole in the door.
      Almost incredible, what? Mrs. St. George had come in person
      and had parleyed with him. "Oh, Mr. Grimshaw? Yes, Alex has
      often spoken of you." She had allowed him to be admitted
      like a visitor into a prison, you know, or into a private
      lunatic asylum.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point he filled and lit a pipe, for a cigarette was
      too flimsy to satisfy his feelings. He did not look at
      Kitty; he stared at the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fine house--you know. Carpets like grass, and lots of old
      pictures. She took me upstairs. O, yes, but before she did
      that I was scrutinized and given my orders. It was most
      important that poor old Alex should not be excited.
      Doctor's orders. She said I might stay five minutes."
    </p>
    <p>
      He blew smoke, and watched a waft of it go up the chimney.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She went up the stairs in front of me, and somehow I felt
      like part of a procession--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Grimmy," said Kitty suddenly, with her fists in her lap,
      "tell me what I want to know."
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry. Alex is <i>compos mentis</i>--as sane as you or I.
      But--my lord--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He nearly fell out of bed at me. His room is like a sort
      of toy shop, or a stall at a bazaar--every sort of gadget.
      I seemed to be wading through books and magazines and
      gramophone records, and bowls of flowers. It smelt like a
      greenhouse, full of soft fug. But--she--was there--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All the time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You bet. She sort of smothered him down on the pillows. I
      was made to sit about two yards off while she commanded the
      bed. Very formal--I can assure you. She had a hand on his
      pulse--so to speak--all the time. And that fellow with the
      flat teeth and the breath was just outside the door. I felt
      muzzled--as though I had a gas-mask on."
    </p>
    <p>
      He puffed smoke in silence for some seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We chatted like a couple of polite old ladies at a
      tea-party. I couldn't say--If I had blurted
      out--anything--And old Alex lay and looked at me. The thing
      that got me--was his eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty's fists were under her chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just how?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Frightened eyes--my dear--seemed to stand out of his head,
      with the whites showing all round them. As if he were
      wanting to shout for help--and couldn't. They made me feel
      funny."
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at Grimshaw's square profile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear old Grimmy! So--it was just like that. And you came
      away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did. I had one handshake. His hand was like a soft and
      bulgy kid-glove. No heart in it. He wanted to say things
      and couldn't, and I had half a mind to blow up. But--after
      all--I might have been like a bull in a china shop. She
      marched me out of the room and down the stairs. She was as
      polite as hell. How long was I staying in London? A few
      days--only. And going back to civilization and work? It was
      kind of me to come and see Alex. He was not allowed to see
      visitors. Whether she suspected me, I don't know, but I am
      pretty sure that that fellow with the breath would be told
      not to let me inside the house again. And that's--that.
      You've got a problem, Kit."
    </p>
    <p>
      She stared at the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught her smiling the strangest of smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But now, I do know--where I am, Grimmy. It's not all fog.
      You've helped me--no end."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wish I could see it like that," said he.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      But in dispelling her uncertainty as to her husband's
      mental state, Jimmy Grimshaw had drawn aside a curtain.
      Kitty could look through the windows of that first-floor
      room and see Alex lying in bed, helplessly the son of his
      mother, and surrounded by her multifarious persuasions.
      Most vividly was she conscious of his frightened eyes, and
      just as Grimshaw had described them, the eyes of a dumb man
      unable to call for help.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it was very obvious that Mrs. St. George had been
      exercising powers of mental suggestion as well as her
      opportunities for physical control, but Kitty decided to
      test her enemy's defences, and the alertness and spirit of
      the defenders. She began by posting a letter to her
      husband, and when it remained unacknowledged, she sent him
      a registered letter, which was no more successful. Her next
      move was to dispatch a reply-paid telegram. The reply
      consisted of three words--"Sender not known." After these
      repulses she walked to Cardigan Square, dropped a letter
      into the letter-box of No. 77, rang the bell, and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      The panel of the grill was slipped to one side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes--what do you want--please?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Leaper's voice. She said: "I have put a letter in
      the box for Mr. St. George. Will you please see that he
      gets it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The grill was closed, but she remained on the doorstep,
      listening to the sounds of retreating footsteps. Presently
      she heard someone else come to the door and unlock the
      letter-box, and she felt sure that the person who extracted
      that letter was Mrs. St. George. All her messages to Alex
      were anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned to Vernor Street. She went up to her room,
      took off her hat and sat down on the bed. She faced the
      situation as she would have faced a mirror, determined to
      see everything in it, even to the very spot she might find
      on her chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      She realized Alex's helplessness. Either everything was
      being kept from him, or it was served up to him specially
      cooked and flavoured. She had to assume complete
      concealment or studied distortion. He knew nothing, or knew
      too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      No longer was he the Alex of Maleham, or the Alex who had
      sat beside her in this little bed, but a paralyzed,
      bedridden child, exposed to any sort of suggestion,
      coerced, drugged, fooled, whispered to. He was like a plant
      in a greenhouse, neatly tied to a stick, and made to grow
      in the direction of the light--the light that his mother
      chose to admit. His helplessness was complete. It looked
      out at her from his dumb and frightened eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was helpless--too--in every other way. He had not a
      penny of his own. She supposed that he was entitled to some
      pension or allowance if he claimed it, but would he be
      allowed to claim it? Mrs. St. George would not see the
      necessity. Obviously, his mother would prefer to hold him
      as her pensioner. He was paralysed in the legs; he had no
      profession, no weapon, no power to make money.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, poor lad!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She could look at the problem through his eyes. She could
      see its pitiful and humiliating features. It made her hot
      and angry and fiercely compassionate. Already she was
      beginning to suspect that the other woman might not want
      him to be other than he was, that she might be planning to
      keep him as he was. A paralyzed child! A man--shorn of his
      manhood, pulped, emasculated, enervated, confined in a
      hot-house! He might grow soft and flabby and fat, a
      decadent thing, a consenting creature, sucking at the sweet
      things this woman gave him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty rose from the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is up to me. It is my job."
    </p>
    <p>

      III
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      A Londoner does not go to Leith Hill in January, and sit
      upon the wet turf and look out over far horizons, but Kitty
      began to visit places almost as unexpected as Leith Hill.
      She had talked the matter over with her mother, and they
      had sat down together before the Vernor Street fire, and
      gone into ways and means. That Mrs. Sarah approved of the
      adventure and was ready to help in financing it, proved how
      much she loved a large and human gesture, and how solid her
      faith was in her daughter. And--after all--that other woman
      was reading them a lesson in thoroughness. It was not a
      mere question of window-dressing, or of amateur gardening
      in a backyard, with a packet of this and a packet of that,
      and a few nasturtiums to cover the lapses. There were to be
      no lapses in Kitty's progress, though she was putting the
      cart before the horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could sell out my 'Cobbolds.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      The ordinary shares of Messrs. Cobbold &amp; Co., were
      showing some vitality, and Mrs. Sarah would not hear of
      Kitty selling out. Mrs. Sarah brought out a little black
      ledger, the Book of the Dooms, and with a page of a
      financial journal spread upon the table, she and Kitty went
      into ways and means. Mrs. Sarah enjoyed figures. When she
      scribbled down an 8, it was as rotund and as solid as
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can back my fancy," she observed, "just as well as the
      woman of Cardigan Square can back hers. Supposing I put
      down a thousand, poppet, to begin with."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll pay you five per cent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it likely!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--yes--I will. If I am to go into business--let it be
      business."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah closed the little black ledger, and wrinkled up
      her nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can put five per cent. back into the show, my dear.
      Besides, you won't be able to live on air for the first six
      months. Here am I--a fat old woman--with seven thousand or
      so--without counting the business--I have been saving money
      hard. I have had one or two lucky speculations. Don't be in
      a hurry. But you won't be."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty scribbled figures on a blotting-pad.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm in a hurry--but I shan't lose my head."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can allow you two hundred and fifty a year while you are
      working yourself in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll pay it back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you are made that way. But what do you think I saved
      money for? Just to sit on it like an old hen on a china
      egg? Hardly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother," said Kitty, with a sudden stare, "you are about
      the dearest thing that ever was. If life is giving instead
      of grabbing--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One has to grab to give, my dear, sometimes. I did not
      learn my economics at a university. I learnt them in
      Bethnal Green and Westminster. You go ahead."
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty went ahead, but her progress was deliberate if
      adventurous. She--too--took a motor-bus to Highbury, and on
      two evenings talked solid, material business with Uncle
      Robert, who found it quite unnecessary to discourage Kitty
      as he had to discourage so many enthusiasts, young and old.
      She had ideas beyond hat shops and chicken farms. In fact,
      he was a little astonished at the scope and the
      thoroughness of her preparations. She had ideas, quite a
      number of ideas, but they were ordered and logical. She had
      no intention of sowing all her seeds with a sweep of the
      hand, and expecting them all to germinate and produce
      impossible results.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said: "I know one has got to take risks, but it seems
      to me that you have got to know just when to take them.
      When you think you see a certainty, and the other fellow
      hasn't begun to think about it at all--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Parsons nodded over his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I am not going to risk my bed and my roof. The first
      little place I get into must be solid, a safe
      thing--however small. I shall look down at the thing inside
      and out before I put my money down. One ought to be able to
      look ahead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just what your mother did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite so. But if you hear--of any little business--being
      up for sale. Lawyers do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We do. Any particular district?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the river--if possible. I want to get in before the
      rush comes. I am doing some investigating--myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't mind--what sort of business?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something that I can run myself--keep in my own hands--"
    </p>
    <p>
      For Kitty was remembering Maleham, the Maleham of those
      seven green and quiet days when she had learnt to know her
      Alex, the cloud watcher, the idler under trees, the
      sensitive boy-man of a husband. He was her contrast. She
      was touched by the very things in him which she had
      not--his dreaminess, his little irresponsibilities, his too
      easy generosities. She might have a Frenchwoman's capacity
      for business, but she had what the majority of Frenchwomen
      do not appear to possess--romantic affection as well as
      animal affection. The shadows in her shop would have that
      indefinable quality of mystery; her fields would be more
      than orderly and productive chessboards under an illogical
      sky. She had Maleham in her mind, not Maleham itself, but
      something a little like it, and with more life to it, the
      life of the river, of that inimitable old Thames that is
      English of the English from Oxford to The Nore. Almost like
      a mother she remembered her man's love of trees and green
      places, and waving grass and sun-dappled backwaters, and
      the sweeping silver of broad reaches, and the poplars and
      the sound of the wind in them. He had loved to watch beasts
      browsing knee-deep in meadows, and the sickled wings of
      swallows cutting the air, and the sunlight of the shadow
      upon the beechwoods. He had talked of farming.
    </p>
    <p>
      What did he or she know of farming? Nothing. But she had in
      her mind a picture of some little place where she could be
      busy while he would have his river, his green spaces and
      his trees. Yes, if she should win him back, rescue him from
      that luxurious misery, she would wish him to lie where he
      could look at the sky and the river. There is laughter in
      life, laughter that wells up from nowhere. Such laughter
      would not come to him in Cardigan Square.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, like a little sturdy person, clasping her basket of
      love and of shrewd practical endeavour, she went in search
      of her new Maleham, her Isle of Apples that was to be more
      than an island of dreams. She had one supreme advantage,
      she knew what she wanted, and she was the daughter of Mrs.
      Sarah.

    <p>
      On a grey and muggy day, with the river a foot above its
      summer level, and flowing like oil, Kitty discovered
      Shelford. She had received a hint from Uncle Robert, who
      had picked up some gossip while lunching in the city with
      the managing clerk of a firm of solicitors who dealt
      largely in real estate. Mr. Parsons had communicated with
      Vernor Street. "An odd bit of property at Shelford--on the
      market. Place called Vine Cottage. What one would describe
      as a job lot, I imagine. I thought you might like to look
      at it." Kitty took the train to Staines. At half-past ten
      in the morning she was in conversation with a depressed and
      leaden-eyed purveyor of punts and boats who, wearing a
      dirty old white sweater, grey trousers, and gum-boots, was
      moving about with a paint-pot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you a motor-boat for hire?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A motor-boat for hire in January, with the river as dead as
      a stuck eel, and the Armistice less than three months old!
      The boat-owner looked at her sourly. Even pessimism seemed
      mute in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you think!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She said: "I want to go down to Shelford and look at it
      from the river. I want to be left at Shelford. Have you got
      a boat?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The man glanced at his boat-house as though he had a grudge
      against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Boats! O, yes, we've been very busy with boats! They don't
      eat their heads off like 'orses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I want one. How far is it to Shelford?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three mile or less. But I ain't got a man; not even a
      damned boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      She said: "Well, aren't you a man? How much do you want?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He got out a boat and sculled her down to Shelford, and the
      exercise seemed to loosen his congealed figure so that he
      grew more conversational in a jerky and discursive fashion.
      He had a grievance. The war had changed everything; nothing
      would ever be the same again, not even the river. As for
      the boys, of all the arrogant, impertinent, spoilt young
      brutes! Yes, even the boys were profiteering! He would
      pause now and again and let the boat glide, and fix his
      depressed and aggravated eyes on Kitty. "You may believe
      or--or not, but you'll never see Boulter's Lock like it
      used to be." She let him talk, and won her first glimpse of
      Shelford over a swinging shoulder and the bulge of a dirty
      white sweater. She saw Shelford as a redness beside the
      brimming river, a clustering of old leafless trees, a green
      ascent rising to black beechwoods. She saw the square
      stunted tower of the church, a little lighter in its
      greyness than the sky, the red Georgian houses, the black
      and white of the Ship Inn, the queer old cottages and bits
      of garden. It lay all on the south bank; the northern bank
      showed her nothing but meadows and trees, and the Ferry Inn
      where Ferry Lane came down to the river. It seemed to float
      to her over the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man lay on his sculls, and looked morosely over his
      left shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's dead," he said, "dead as a damned rat."
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled faintly. She was looking at something that
      pleased her, but she wanted him to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After the war--you mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do. Why--on a Sunday--you'd see boats putting in
      there--by the dozen. And the Abbot's Close full of cars.
      And Bunt's boat-house there quite lively. Shut up now. He
      used to do quite a nice lot of boat-building. Broke--broke
      to the world. And all because of those silly pigs of
      Germans--"
    </p>
    <p>
      His lugubriousness had a meaning for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know a place called Vine Cottage?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's Vine Cottage. Next to Bunt's boat-house. Used to do
      quite well with teas--in a small way. I've seen half a
      dozen tables there on a Sunday afternoon."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty saw the place as a low, rambling, reddish cottage,
      shaped like a letter L, and dipping its garden into the
      river. There were fruit trees, and two or three old yews, a
      stretch of grass, and a derelict-looking summer-house. Two
      chimney-stacks stood up red and square. The roof tiles were
      the colour of old rusty iron. The small windows blinked
      from white frames. A vine, roses and wistaria struggled up
      the walls, and in autumn a Virginia creeper splashed one
      gabled end a vivid crimson. Between the garden and the
      boat-house a magnificent plane-tree rose, piping from its
      trunk a great spray of greyish branches.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Floods ever reach there?" asked Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never knew them to reach the house. I've known them reach
      Bunt's boat-house, because he cut into the bank for his
      level. Looks a bit homesick--this time of year. Want me to
      land you at the ferry steps?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please."
    </p>
    <p>
      He landed her at the steps, and she found herself in Lime
      Walk between rows of pollarded lime-trees. Her impulse was
      to wander and to explore before viewing Vine Cottage, and
      she walked on into the open space that was known as Abbot's
      Close, where three old Georgian houses with white doors and
      architraves and window-sashes faced the Ship Inn. Abbot's
      Hostel, a Charles II foundation, embracing a little cobbled
      courtyard, lay on the west of the Close. Here were more
      lime-trees, and Kitty stood under one of them and looked at
      the Ship Inn. It appeared whiter than it was, and being a
      woman she had an eye for blinds and curtains and the
      significance of such details. She decided to have lunch at
      the Ship Inn, and test its imagination; she believed in
      imagination as a business asset; imagination created
      opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wandered on. She explored what appeared to be the main
      street of Shelford, until it languished into two rows of
      workmen's cottages; she examined the shops. They were so
      obvious, as obvious as the brussels sprouts in the
      greengrocer's baskets, or the peaches and tinned fruit in
      the grocers' window. There was no gleam of a "Come hither"
      in the eyes of these shops; they offered you no sense of
      adventure; they aroused no curiosity; and Kitty, pausing
      outside the window of the local draper's, and scrutinizing
      the hats, knew at once what was wrong with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You old maid of a shop!"
    </p>
    <p>
      For, after all, if you did not succeed in interesting
      people, and in picquing their curiosity, they would come
      dully into your shop and ask without imagination for the
      dull stuff you offered them. "Three penn'orth of vinegar,
      please." You and they remained dull, trading the obvious,
      and your turnover became as slothful as a change of posture
      in bed. The thing was to have a different kind of carrot to
      dangle in front of the nose of the ass of habit, and to
      dangle it differently.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked on to look at the sturdy old church, with its
      yews and its great cedar, and at the rectory, planted among
      trees behind a high red-brick wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's old England," she reflected. "And there's a new
      England coming. Bound to be. That fellow in the boat could
      not see three miles down the river. If people wanted to
      play--before the war, surely they'll be wanting to play
      twice as hard after four years of war. We are starving for
      play. And my play is going to be--? O, well!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled at the church tower and turned to walk down
      River Lane. It ran parallel to the Thames, and fifty yards
      of it and of little old houses and odd shops brought her to
      some gardens and an orchard, and opposite the orchard stood
      Vine Cottage. It had a board up "For Sale. Apply Within."
      It had a queer little white porch perched on two slim white
      legs. It was both cottage and shop, showing to the passers
      in the lane a long, low, old-fashioned shop window full of
      tired articles--cigarettes, tins of tobacco, cheap pipes,
      boxes of chocolates with the ribbon faded, jars of sweets,
      picture postcards. "Everything and nothing," as Kitty
      described it. She stood back in the lane, and examined the
      red walls, the windows and the roof. The place looked
      solid. It had that English cosiness, a ripe lightness. It
      gave you the feeling that it had grown there.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was offered two doors of entry, the green one with the
      brass knocker under the porch, and the white shop door with
      its two glass panels. She chose the shop door. A bell
      tinkled. She stepped down six inches to worn, brown
      linoleum. She saw untidy shelves, and a counter covered
      with white American cloth, on it a pair of scales and a
      bottle of bull's-eyes. A woman came through a door from the
      back, and looked at Kitty as though she had come to collect
      a subscription.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a very tired woman, completely colourless, with one
      of those dusty skins, and pale lips crimped over prominent
      teeth. Her fair hair was dragged back as though some hand
      seized it each morning with relentless and worrying haste.
      She stooped. She had one of those faces that never smile.
      Her pale eyes suggested that life was tiresome, and so
      properly dull that to indulge in a smile was an
      impropriety.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stared at Kitty. She did not speak, but her eyes asked
      the question: "Well, what d'you want? I'm in a hurry."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was one of those unfortunate creatures who are always
      full of haste, chasing their own little bobs of hair. Kitty
      said: "Good morning! Are you Miss Ives? I have an order to
      view."
    </p>
    <p>
      She produced the order, and Miss Ives looked at it as
      though she had in her red and skinny finger a doubtful
      cheque.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's very early. The beds--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, never mind. I shan't mind. If you are busy--perhaps I
      can look round?"
    </p>
    <p>
      As if a woman of Miss Ives's propriety would let you poke
      about her house--alone!
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you will sit down for five minutes--please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Supposing I look at the garden--till you are ready?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, the garden! If you wish to."
    </p>
    <p>
      With agitation and fluster and worried ill-humour, she
      almost pushed Kitty down a tile-paved passage into the
      garden. She slammed the garden door, though time is not
      economized by the slamming of doors. She had said something
      about having lodgers to cook for. And Kitty walked down to
      the river, and turned to stand and stare. Enlightened
      staring is a necessity, and to do it you must stand very
      still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, she liked the little funny old place; she had liked it
      from the first glance; she continued to like it in spite of
      that feather broom of a woman. But mere liking was not
      sufficient; she had to examine it with one eye on its
      business possibilities, and the other eye on Alex. The
      garden was an untidy stretch of grass, with here and there
      an old fruit tree, or a weed patch that had been a
      flowerbed. On pacing it out she found it to possess a river
      frontage of some hundred and twenty feet. Her measurements
      stopped at a laurel hedge, until she realized that the
      ground beyond the hedge also belonged to Vine Cottage. She
      traversed a gap in the hedge and made a discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was looking up towards the other limb of the L-shaped
      cottage, and towards a ground-floor window, a wonderful
      window, spacious and strangely peaceful. It seemed to
      stretch from wall to wall. It gazed with steadfast
      tranquillity at the river, and the trees and fields across
      the river; it looked along this little secret strip of
      garden between the laurel hedge and a high old red-brick
      wall. She walked up to the window and looked at it. The
      present furnishings of the room or its purpose did not
      matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew her breath and held it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just the room for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was. She could see him lying in that nappy window, or in
      the piece of garden, sheltered, but not too much so. He
      would have his trees and his river. And if this room had a
      garden door of its own?
    </p>
    <p>
      It had one. She found a green door opening upon a narrow
      brick path. She smiled and returned to the river; she
      looked up and down the river with eyes of imagination; she
      saw boats coming and going. She saw also a rotting
      landing-stage with two broken boards on it. She strolled
      along and looked over the fence dividing the garden from
      Bunt's boat-house and yard. It looked derelict. She had
      both her eyes and her imagination on the big white
      boat-house with its tarred roof. Already she was wanting
      that boat-house, and wondering if Bunt was a person, a live
      entity to be bargained with.
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned to the cottage, and walked round it, looking
      at the gutters and pipes and the putty in the windows. She
      was staring hard at a cracked pane of glass when a pair of
      red knuckles rapped on the window. She saw Miss Ives's
      hurried face, with its hair slipping back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm ready for you now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interior of the cottage was full of Miss Ives, and Miss
      Ives's sister, and Miss Ives's two lodgers and their
      various hastes and untidinesses, for Miss Ives appeared to
      have infected the whole place with the muddled disorder of
      a hurried soul. There were fussinesses, an impression of
      dishevelled things bundled hastily into drawers and
      cupboards. The prevailing tints of the paint and papers
      were heavy green and brown, gloomy colours, toning with the
      faint smell of cabbage boiling in the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Ives stood in the centre of what was called the
      drawing-room, and with clasped yet fidgety hands snapped
      out the necessary details.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three sitting-rooms, four bedrooms, kitchen, scullery and
      offices. Company's water, gas, electric light. Shop,--and
      stock. We want £1,150 for the cottage, and £150 for the
      stock--and goodwill."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty was looking at the green wallpaper, a sort of
      tapestry affair with brown and purple splodges upon it. She
      herself--from a cursory glance, would have valued Miss
      Ives's stock at twopence-halfpenny, and Miss Ives's
      goodwill at nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said: "Is there a bathroom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      No, there was no bathroom, and Miss Ives fidgeted, and held
      the door open.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would like to see--everything, I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, everything. But--first--that room with the big
      window."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Ives led her to that room, informing Kitty as she
      went--and jerking her words out between prominent
      teeth--that her lodgers used that room, that they were
      untidy young men, that they would push the chairs about and
      wear holes in the carpet. Kitty, forgetting Miss Ives for
      the moment stood by the broad window, and let herself feel
      what she wanted to feel. The little house was unhappy and
      it could be so happy. It seemed to cry out to her--"O, take
      her away, do take her away. She's always pinching me, and
      pulling my hair, and slamming doors, and giving me boiled
      cabbage. I'm a happy little house, really." And Kitty
      mused. She saw the walls stripped, and the painted gloom
      burnt away, and creams and buffs and roses lighting and
      warming the interior. She liked the long room with the
      window. She could see other things in it, and Alex.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now the bedrooms--please, and the kitchen."
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw them, though Miss Ives behaved as though she was
      exposing some part of her own nakedness to a very young
      doctor; but Kitty did not pity Miss Ives.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course--it's absurdly cheap--at the price we are
      asking."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty maintained her solid reserve. Silence bears heavily
      upon a chatterer. And business is business. She saw the
      bedrooms, and the kitchen, and another Miss Ives who looked
      even larger and more faded than her sister. Even in the
      pulling on of a glove pressure can be exerted. Kitty showed
      no eagerness; she was impartial and calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think I need see the stock in the shop. I have
      several places to choose from. It's a nice little place--in
      its way--but then--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She began her departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you any local agents here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Ives snapped at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tutt &amp; Crewdson, in the High Street."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you. I'm afraid I've taken up a lot of your time.
      Good morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      She left Miss Ives under the impression that she had no
      intention of buying.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Kitty went to Messrs. Tutt &amp; Crewdson. She saw Mr.
      Crewdson, a busy well-oiled little man with a bald head and
      a shoehorn nose. She was admitted to an inner office. She
      was deliberate and at her ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been looking at Vine Cottage. I had the address
      from your London representatives. The price is too high."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Crewdson soaped his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--of course--madam--if that is your view--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is. And the stock--is shop-soiled and stale. The whole
      place would need doing up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Little properties like Vine Cottage," said Mr.
      Crewdson--and was interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a derelict business. I want a live one. But--I might
      consider--yes, in spite of the disadvantages. I want
      someone else to see it. We are looking at a number of
      places. Supposing you give me the first refusal--for three
      days."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Crewdson hemmed and ha'ed a little, and tried a few
      exaggerations and inexactitudes, and then decided that it
      might be done. Kitty gave her name and address, and a
      reference to her solicitors and her bankers--who--of
      course--were also Mrs. Sarah's bankers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can wire me--if any other offer arrives. Meanwhile--I
      shall be looking round--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Crewdson conducted her to the door. He had
      susceptibilities, and they had fallen to Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope we shall do business, madam. Good morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following day Mrs. Sarah came down to Shelford with
      her daughter, a Mrs. Sarah who was finding a renewed youth
      in combat. For if the other woman had erected a fortress,
      she--Mrs. Sarah--was now ready to offer a broad back to her
      daughter for the scaling and spoiling of that fortress. For
      as she said to Kitty in the train--"Fighting's always been
      my line, poppet. If it is to be a question of money--well,
      well, I talked about a thousand. I'll go to three, and
      further--if needs be. I shall keep on the shop. No Highbury
      for me--yet. Besides, now that Corah is going to marry a
      fellow who can make fifteen hundred a year or more--I can
      put on airs. I've more margin. I shall have to get hold of
      two good girls for the shop--"
    </p>
    <p>
      They came to Shelford by train, Shelford being on a branch
      line from Weybridge. They did not propose to interview Miss
      Ives; not a bit of it; that would not do.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Softly--walkee, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      They managed to hire a boat at the ferry steps, and were
      rowed up and down the Shelford river-front like a couple of
      Amazons reconnoitring before a landing. They observed
      things, but did not discuss their observations before the
      boatman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Said Mrs. Sarah, when they were again on shore, and walking
      up the lane:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite right, Kittums, there's not another possible site on
      the Shelford front--but that boat-house. You ought to have
      that boat-house. We must find out about this man Bunt."
    </p>
    <p>
      They discovered a carpenter repairing a gate, who was able
      to tell them about Bunt. Bunt was dead, and his business
      had died before him. Mrs. Bunt lived in Cherry Lane at a
      place called Prospect Cottage--second on the left--after
      you had passed the church. It was Mrs. Sarah who sought out
      and interviewed the widow, and finding her an approachable
      person, opened overtures. Mrs. Bunt confessed that she had
      thought of selling the land and the boat-house; one or two
      people had been nibbling. She said that she had been
      advised to ask £300 for it. Yes, freehold--of course. And
      what did Mrs. Sarah want it for?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah had her answer ready. She said that she was
      looking for a nice site where she might be able to build a
      bungalow for a married daughter whose husband had been
      badly wounded in the war. Mrs. Bunt was sympathetic, but
      she stuck to her £300. Moreover, she would like to be
      advised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Frampton--a solicitor--in the Abbot's Close--looked
      after her affairs for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah attacked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--come and see your lawyer."
    </p>
    <p>
      She believed in snatching her chestnut while it was hot,
      and she was so successful with her fingers that before the
      day was out she had agreed to buy and Mrs. Bunt to sell
      that piece of freehold land with all buildings erected upon
      it, for the sum of £300.
    </p>
    <p>
      She and Kitty had tea at the Ship Inn. These two strong
      little women had walked all over Shelford, and exhausted
      Shelford, but not themselves. Mrs. Sarah ordered buttered
      toast, and looking greatly cheerful, reviewed the
      situation. They had the room to themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have got a cinch on them, my dear, as the Yanks say.
      We'll offer a thousand for Vine Cottage and £50 for the
      stock! They are asking £1,300. It's not worth that. If they
      kick we can say 'Right, we have bought the ground next
      door. We can build--if we want to. Meanwhile--there is our
      offer of £1,050.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to be hard on the woman," said Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't pity your neighbour, my dear, so long as he has a
      fence to stand behind. Meanwhile--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She ate buttered toast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yon have a head and an eye, poppet. That's the only
      possible place on the Shelford river-front. And nearly two
      hundred yards of frontage. Why, even if the adventure
      weren't to come off, we have got our value. And more than
      that. In two years--I'll swear--we could sell at a good
      profit. You'll have a monopoly. The thing is to be ahead of
      the others."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty stirred her tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about this place? Possible rivals."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think so," said Mrs. Sarah. "Did you see the man
      who runs it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The man with the red face?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so," said her mother. "A boozer. That takes fifty per
      cent. off him. Besides--look at the crockery--and those
      curtains."
    </p>
    <p>
      It turned out as Mrs. Sarah had expected. Miss Ives was
      offered £1,050, though Messrs. Tutt &amp; Crewdson received
      the offer with hauteur, but after three days of
      negotiation, Mrs. Sarah's figures were accepted, for she
      had been able to say: "Well, there you are. That's our
      offer. We have the land, and personally I'm in favour of
      building, so it is not particularly important to us.
      There's our offer. We will let it stand for three days."
      Miss Ives, too flurried a person to deal with Mrs. Sarah's
      phlegm, and quite sure that if a house was built next door
      the value of Vine Cottage would be depreciated, and afraid
      of losing what appeared to be a certainty, and not being
      very stoutly encouraged by Messrs. Tutt &amp; Crewdson, who
      were thinking of their commission and standing in with the
      people who appeared to have money to spend,--Miss Ives gave
      in, on the understanding that she was to be allowed to
      occupy Vine Cottage for a month--rent free. So it was all
      written down--"Occupation on Februrary 14th."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty was just a little sorry for Miss Ives, Mrs. Sarah not
      at all so. She described Miss Ives as a woman who had never
      been able to make herself or any man comfortable, a chair
      with the springs sticking through the cushions. "Not enough
      padding, my dear. If I were a man I'd have nothing to do
      with a bony woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Kitty sat down at the Vernor Street table, and
      did much scribbling of figures. She had her cottage and her
      land, but that was only the beginning of things. She had to
      think of painting and decorating, and furnishing, and the
      restocking of the shop, and what she was going to do with
      Bunt's boat-house, and how she was going to do it. She
      would need chairs and tables and crockery, a new
      landing-stage, a super-gramophone, floor-boarding, bunting,
      Chinese lanterns, treillage. The garden would have to be
      made gay and sleek and attractive. Also, she would have to
      live, and perhaps to help a paralyzed husband. She would
      need a strong girl in the house. It was probable--too--that
      she might have to hire a handy man to look after the garden
      and the fittings, to handle boats, and make himself
      generally useful.
    </p>
    <p>
      She prepared a number of estimates and budgets. She
      travelled down to Shelford and interviewed local decorators
      and a local builder. She found the local builder a
      difficult person. He wanted to ask her £95 for adapting
      Bunt's boat-house for the purpose that she required.
    </p>
    <p>
      She and Mrs. Sarah sat down to the figures.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't niggle, my dear," said the mother. "It is better to
      be a little broad in the beam."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Mrs. Sarah who suggested a £500 mortgage on Vine
      Cottage. The property had cost them £1,350. There would be
      the lawyer's fees, etc. £300 could be set aside for
      decoration, constructional alterations, and new fitments.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Call it £1,700--all told. A £500 mortgage will reduce it
      to £1,200. I'll stock the shop for you from here. Supposing
      I lay out £1,500, that will leave you with £300 to live on
      and work with for the first year, not counting the interest
      on your Cobbold shares. They may turn up trumps. Now what
      can you live on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fifteen shillings a week," said Kitty promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There may be three of you. Call it £3 a week. Say £150 a
      year. You will want a man for the summer months, say £2 a
      week for twenty weeks. He'll get tips. Six per cent. on a
      £500 mortgage--£30. That makes £220 in all. Then there will
      be coal and gas and electric light, and rates--about £15 a
      year, I think they said; and clothes and sundries, and
      insurance. And one has to remember the doctor. It will be a
      bit of a squeeze."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--I can stand it," said Kitty, "I'm going to work like a
      little horse. I can make a lot of things myself. Most of
      the cakes. This is my--job."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heavens!" said Mrs. Sarah suddenly, "we have forgotten the
      furniture. Well, you can have your bedroom furniture. I
      must put my £1,500 up to £1,600. Seems to me we had better
      be going to sales. I have a nose for a bargain."

      Always there were flowers in Alex St. George's room,
      violets, narcissi, pots of red and white hyacinths, and the
      perfume of them pervaded his mother's purpose. These
      innocent things brought into that sealed room a gentle
      sense of languor. They smelt of the hot-house and the
      florist's shop, and never having known the sharp blue naked
      sky and the winds, they seemed to the man in the bed
      artificial and sapless, waxen things, like himself, shut up
      behind glass. Their language was not of the woods and the
      fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow they made him sad, sadder than he need have been,
      sadder than he was. They, too, were paralyzed things,
      planted in pots or thrust into vases. His room was heavy
      with the scent of them, but he grew used to that, and did
      not notice it, but Leaper, stealing in first thing in the
      morning, would twitch his nostrils.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Smells like a funeral."
    </p>
    <p>
      For to Mrs. St. George's son those January days were full
      of a tired melancholy, and the new-born year was like a
      grey sea sleeping. He saw the rain come down; he knew the
      outline of every plane-tree that was visible, the shape and
      the number of the chimney-pots that could be seen and
      counted from where he lay. There were red chimney-pots and
      clay-coloured chimney-pots, and galvanized tubes and
      funnels, and chimney-pots with cowls that swung to and fro
      when the wind blew, looking like the helmets of faceless
      ghost-soldiers. He knew everything in the room--the cracks
      in the plaster of the ceiling, the way the shadows crept
      across the wall when the winter sun was shining. There
      seemed to be nothing else for him to know, nothing more
      than he could know.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a grey and quiet month, and he lay in the grey
      trough of a depression, sunk so deep in it that it seemed
      to be all his world. Certainly, things happened, but they
      always happened in the same way and at the same time. There
      were the comings and goings of his mother, Leaper, and Dr.
      Dazely. He liked Leaper and he hated him; he was so
      dependent on Leaper, but sometimes when Leaper was
      massaging his legs he would feel a sudden uncontrollable
      desire to pick up something and dash it against that flat
      and baldish head. He knew the very smell of Leaper, a moist
      odour, and associated other smells with him, the scent of
      shaving soap and bay-rum, the smell of his sponge. There
      were times when the very nearness of Leaper made him
      conscious of a sense of nausea. He wanted to open the
      windows wide, but he could not get near a window.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were nights, too, when he had dreams, horrible and
      repulsive dreams, and he would wake sweating and shivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for his mother, she came in and out, and brought him
      things, and arranged flowers, and sat and gazed with those
      blue eyes of hers until he could have cried out to
      her--"Don't--don't," or have hidden his face in his pillow.
      He was most strangely afraid of his mother. She made him
      think of a priestess gliding noiselessly into some holy of
      holies, and arranging flowers round an altar. She made him
      think of a white and windless flame burning, a flame that
      would never go out. When he talked to her it was with a
      sense of effort, as though the silence of the room was
      glass, and he was picking up a hammer and cracking it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes he would ask for the windows to be opened more
      widely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd like to hear the noise of the traffic."
    </p>
    <p>
      But she had such a watchful look. It was as though she was
      watching for something in him to bleed to death. He was
      conscious of the heavy and perfumed presence of her
      kindness. She was overlaying her child, stifling a part of
      its life, smothering a whispering desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, she smothered him with kindness. She gave him
      everything that it was possible for her to give him,
      everything save life, and movement and joy. He could not
      complain; he could not show ingratitude; he was becoming
      wax in her hands, or a piece of soft pulp. He knew it, and
      yet could not struggle. He lay and consented.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would turn on the gramophone, and when he wept over one
      of the tunes, she--with a sudden look of stark
      severity--stopped the machine, and came and stood beside
      his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, you must not give way--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Did she know that he was bored, so bored that he wished
      himself dead?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, certainly things happened. Though her son could not
      walk, he could be provided with new clothes, and Tylor's of
      Savile Row sent their representative with a selection of
      patterns and a tape-measure and a sympathetic manner. Alex
      lay and fingered the patterns, thinking--"What is the use?"
      The pomp of youth had passed from his life--that--and
      Kitty. He had become a wilful pessimist with regard to his
      wife, repressing the instinctive surge of faith in her that
      rose in him from time to time, for like some experience
      thrust down into his subconsciousness an elemental faith in
      her survived. When the boxes of shirts and ties and pyjamas
      and collars and a selection of silk dressing-gowns were
      sent from Maybury's in New Bond Street, he made a languid
      examination of the merchandise, and remembered with a pang
      how he had bought pyjamas before going down to Maleham.
      Green, wistful Maleham, would he see it again? Did he wish
      to see it again?
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had begun to loathe his bed. He appealed to Dr.
      Dazely, that bland and kind collusionist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't I get out of this--and have a chair by the window?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Dazely polished his monocle with a cream silk
      handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you like to sit by the window?"
    </p>
    <p>
      What a fool question!
    </p>
    <p>
      But Dr. Dazely was no fool, nor was he a complete Agag. You
      could not come daily to sit by Alex St. George's bed
      without developing a liking for the lad, a feeling for that
      something in his wide eyes, and Dr. Dazely was not
      satisfied. He spoke of Alex with sententious solicitude to
      Mrs. St. George.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He ought to be interested as much as possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      She asked him, with convincing frankness, to tell her what
      she could do that she had not already done. And he bowed to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been a wonderful mother, quite wonderful. My
      advice has been--'Perfect rest, physical and mental.' But
      the time will come when he will need stimulus. He must be
      roused--little by little. He will have to be helped to
      adapt--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She listened like the perfect mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. What do you advise?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think we might begin by letting him have a long chair by
      the window."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Later, we can promote him to an invalid's chair so that he
      can move himself about the room. When the spring comes I
      suggest that you take him down to some quiet place by the
      sea, or into the country, where he can be wheeled out--or
      trundle himself about."
    </p>
    <p>
      She agreed. She was beginning to think that she had shaken
      off those Vernor Street women, and that Alex at Cromer or
      Torquay would be as securely hers as Alex shut up in
      Cardigan Square.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anything else that you can suggest?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Interests--you know--hobbies--compatible with his
      condition. He must be persuaded to develop interests. Just
      at present--of course--I do not advise too much mental
      strain. But so perfect a mother--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled upon her bland adviser.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Music--for instance. He has the hands of a pianist--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Splendid. The very thing. Even a banjo. And he might
      interest himself in languages--though just at present I
      should advise banjo lessons, or the collecting of foreign
      stamps. If my language is somewhat figurative--dear lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Admirably put," said she. "I realize the necessity for
      gradualness. He has to collect a new body of interests."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you will help him. Who could do it better?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He departed, feeling warm within, pulling on his yellow
      gloves, the discreet and fashionable physician. But he
      would have done better if he had thought more of giving
      "the poor lad" a new pair of legs instead of a re-educated
      and bottle-fed soul.

    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      There were people who spoke of Mrs. St. George's "beautiful
      devotion." They agreed to discover in her new sympathies,
      delicacies, softnesses. They admired her courage and her
      pride, and especially the complete silence that she had
      cast over her son's domestic tragedy. For she had let it be
      understood that there had been a tragedy, one of those
      unfortunate war-entanglements, but that she had no
      intention of discussing it with anybody. She was loyal to
      her son. In the opinion of her relatives she had behaved as
      a Smythe and a gentlewoman, for all the Smythes were to be
      found in the same family pew.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very unsubtle rendering of this particular study! Old
      Jermyn St. George, trumpeting in his coarse way through the
      brass of the conventions, was like an elephant squirting
      water over irreproachable linen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Call it devotion! Bosh! She's just a white cat with her
      mouse."
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps she was, and a cat complacently sure of her own
      rightness. We are adepts at self-persuasion, some of us
      more so than others, and Mrs. St. George had ceased to need
      self-persuasion. She was not a woman who lit candles and
      then blew them out again. With success well alight, shadows
      flee, and the path becomes clearer. She was confident with
      a gliding, beneficent, inexorable confidence. She had
      snatched her son from the jaws of a mésalliance, and if she
      had to carry him in her own jaws in the doing of it was
      that cruelty?
    </p>
    <p>
      To do her justice she had never thought of it as cruelty.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was fulfilling a function, enthroning a responsibility.
      Any qualms that she may have suffered in the beginning
      disappeared, and lingered as vague and unpleasant memories
      that were attached to those Vernor Street women. The
      taint--if there was a taint--was theirs. She had been able
      to rid herself of any self-accusation by dumping it upon
      Mrs. Sarah's doorstep. She had done it very thoroughly. By
      the end of January she was qualmless.
    </p>
    <p>
      In possessing her son, in subjecting him to a complete and
      enervating luxury, in treating him like a pet dog, she did
      not seem to realize that she was making him something less
      than a man. She was giving him both Sybaris and Croton.
      Even when providing him with artificial interests she was
      suggesting that he should learn a few tricks and grin and
      gibber over them. And all the while she was committing
      murder. She ignored the very essence of his manhood, the
      urge of nature, the truth that a man must get things for
      himself or sicken and die, and that if things are got for
      him vicariously he will cease to desire them. The spirit of
      northern manhood is the spirit of striving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even when his long chair was placed on wooden blocks in the
      window, and Leaper lifted him from the bed to the chair,
      his mother would sit for hours at the window, sharing the
      life of the square with him. He was not to see it alone and
      by himself; he was to see nothing of his own. She seemed to
      distrust the things he might see unless she saw them also,
      even the yellow crocuses in the grass of the gardens, the
      swelling of the leaf-buds, the lilacs glimmering in the
      sunlight, the taxis, the people, the very sparrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      She noticed that he was growing very silent. He would lie
      for an hour without speaking, staring with vague eyes at
      everything and nothing. Books had ceased to interest him.
      And sometimes she would talk in order to make him talk,
      though they said nothing to each other that mattered. She
      considered that it was good for him to talk, as it was good
      for him to have banjo lessons and twang strings. Mrs. St.
      George twanged strings.
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      III
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      One Mr. Sidney Mocato, a gentleman with a tinge of yellow
      in his skin, and large and staring eyes, came daily to give
      Mr. St. George banjo lessons. They made so cheerful a noise
      together that Leaper felt moved to walk upon his toes and
      snap his fingers, though his business was to wait outside
      the door and listen to any conversation that might pass
      between Mr. Mocato and his pupil, for Leaper had had it
      impressed upon him that the women at Vernor Street were not
      to be forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      But these banjo lessons were a mere crackling of thorns
      under a pot. They relieved the tedium and gave some sense
      of stir to the stagnant hours. Yet they had an unexpected
      and unexplained effect upon Alex St. George, for after them
      he would show a peculiar irritability, as though Mr.
      Mocato's fingers had been picking at his nerves. His
      irritability would spend itself on Leaper; more and more he
      was beginning to dislike the male nurse, and to feel a
      prickling of the skin when the man touched him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it happened Leaper had a pair of new boots that
      squeaked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For God's sake--take those boots off, man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, sir? What's wrong, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They squeak."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do they, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! Haven't you noticed it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      No, Leaper had not noticed it. He had developed a
      professional insensibility, and having done the same things
      for years, he had been dulled to the reactions his
      activities might produce in the persons upon whom he
      exercised them. A case was a case; moods were moods. It
      might have astonished him to know that there were parts of
      him, tricks of his, that roused in Alex St. George a
      sensitive disgust. Leaper had hair growing in his ears and
      nostrils; his skin had a greasiness; also, he had a habit
      of sniffing--But chiefly Alex St. George loathed Leaper's
      hands; he was so dependent on those hands, and he hated
      being touched by them. They had a clamminess--
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, though Leaper did not understand the inwardness of Mr.
      St. George's moods, he was aware of them as moods, and had
      the sense to warn his mother. When steam begins to escape
      from the safety-valve--
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think he is a little tired of sticking in stamps, madam.
      If I may say so, madam, it would do him good to have a
      little company."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had had this measure in her mind. That Leaper should
      have suggested it was an impertinence, but an impertinence
      that had to be borne, for Leaper had his uses, nor could he
      be discarded prematurely. Yes, no doubt it would do Alex
      good to see people, people who would amuse him, the right
      sort of people. She chose them with discretion. They were
      to brighten and emphasize the "atmosphere" she was
      collecting about her paralyzed son; they were to be of the
      right class and temper, such untarnished sunlight that the
      yellow fog of Vernor Street should be convinced of cheap
      gloom. For a woman of her position some of her thinking was
      very crude--"If I show him a pretty girl or two--" That is
      to say, she thought of her son's mind as a sort of
      stereoscopic cabinet into which you pushed pretty pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a series of little tea-parties, and having
      selected her pretty pictures, took them upstairs to show to
      Alex, whom Leaper had dressed in one of his Savile Row
      suits. She also introduced a selection of mothers, and one
      or two tame young men who had not taken part in the war.
      Yet these little causeries were not a success. The young
      things might sit about on the "club fender" and on odd
      chairs and tuffets, and smoke cigarettes, and turn on the
      gramophone, but Alex's wide eyes--with the sensitive swim
      of the dark pupils--saw something that his mother did not
      see.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd rather they did not come, mater."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear boy--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see--when they turn on the gramophone they want to
      dance. How can they--in my room!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are too sensitive," she said. "You must make an
      effort--I'm sure the little Hartley girl--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--Maisie--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked profoundly bored--and more than bored.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She sits and stares at me. I'm a hero. That's her pose.
      And I don't like the colour of her hair. I know she's a
      nice flapper--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear boy--I thought--Is there anything that you
      want--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He flared--just as his father would have flared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damn it--I want a new pair of legs--Sorry, mater, but I
      get--so--so touchy lying here."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was offended, but she had the sense not to tantalize
      him with further displays of youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They tire me," he said; "I feel so infernally old."
    </p>
    <p>
      So, still thinking of him as a stereoscopic cabinet into
      which you introduced pictorial matter, she set about
      choosing older and more faded pictures. She brought in one
      or two relatives when they happened to be in town, Uncle
      Sam, otherwise the Very Rev. Samuel Smythe, Archdeacon of
      Blandchurch, who was staying at the Langham, and old
      Havelock St. George, a major-general.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Archdeacon was sandy, like his name, though why the
      name Samuel should be associated with sandiness requires
      some ethnological explanation. He came and sat beside his
      nephew's chair, and looked at him as he might have looked
      at a baby. "Now what am I to say to this--?" But he was a
      kind soul, if too thin-lipped, and having spent many years
      exercising archidiaconal functions, he was as careful as a
      cat. He walked round things softly, never brushing against
      a reality; realities are delicate china, and so
      disconcerting when smashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      His philosophy was one of compensations. He loved that
      particular word. He soaped life with it, till it was all
      smooth and sudded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It might have been your eyesight, my dear boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      And when the young man replied: "I rather wish it had been
      my head--" his uncle looked shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come--come--we must not talk like that. Try and think of
      the compensations--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stated them full and at length, and with much kindness,
      till his sandy face seemed to swim before Alex's eyes like
      that of the cat in "Alice in Wonderland." But what
      dreams--what a cobweb of words! Young St. George lay and
      gripped the arms of his invalid's chair, till even the
      grips seemed to slide away under his uncle's spume of
      words. But this sort of thing was not fair. When you had
      lost the use of your legs and could not get up and run
      away, people came and stared and talked and preached until
      you were moved to use the old virile words of the war. "O,
      go to hell!" But how could you tell an archdeacon to go to
      hell? And if you sent him to heaven? Well, he might
      continue to talk of compensations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old General Sir George was more stimulating. He was
      somewhat deaf, and full of abrupt "What-whats." His very
      bright eyes looked out of his face that was red and
      contradictory. He had been an inspector or something during
      the war, one of those explosive men who when they saw that
      a certain structure had been made round, asked you why you
      had not made it square. He questioned Alex about his legs,
      and pinched them even. He seemed to disbelieve in their
      paralyzed state. "Suppose you try to use 'em?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you can't begin to try, uncle--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Lord--man--why not? They feel solid enough--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have massage and electricity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do. Who's your doctor? I'll have a talk to your
      mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is possible that this explosive person might have been
      of some use to Alex had Havelock not gone downstairs and
      quarrelled with Alex's mother. They disagreed, and the
      General could never digest any sort of disagreement.
      Moreover, he had spent a great part of his life interfering
      with other people's postures and plans and positions, and
      interference can be very distasteful to a woman who knows
      her own mind. Mrs. St. George was not going to have her son
      made square when she wanted him round, and Uncle Havelock
      was told that without sympathy and understanding a man is
      as nothing. But he gave her a flying shot--both barrels--as
      he went out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you keep him tucked up like that--he'll get into bad
      habits and take to nipping--When a man's bored--Besides,
      you have cut him off from his woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      Very coarse creatures--men, so obsessed by their appetites,
      and always imagining that the man across the table has just
      the same thirsts and passions. She shut out old
      Havelock--also the vulgar suggestion that her son might
      develop into something sottish and decadent. He would have
      neither the money nor the opportunity; she had him in a
      glass case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the one member of the family--old Jermyn St.
      George--who might have been of human use to Alex, was laid
      up at Torquay for the winter with what he called a "wet
      chest."

    <p>
      Those who remember the spring of 1919 will recall the slush
      and the bitterness of its beginning, and its sudden and
      perfect flowering, but for young St. George the spring was
      not yet, thought he lay and thought of it with a little
      whisper of yearning. For how many men yearned for the
      coming of that first spring after the war, for a greenness
      that was unplastered with blood, and a singing of birds
      that did not tear at the heart-strings. So, Alex St. George
      lay and yearned for it, but with a languor of melancholy,
      and a desire that seemed to lie in a deep trench and wait
      for some flower to bend down and nod its head at him. For
      May would be the May of a year ago, and yet so different,
      with a pang in the heart of it. If he thought of fruit
      blossom and the yellow broom, and wild hyacinths blue
      sheeted in the beechwoods, he thought too of a woman. The
      spring was Kitty, and he could not bear to think of Kitty,
      for the thought of Kitty was most strangely disturbing.
      Strange--because he had a primeval faith in her instinct in
      the soil of him, and ready to burst through into the
      sunlight with the inevitableness of the spring. It lay
      there beneath his languor, beneath the dead leaves of a
      young pessimism. There were times when he would feel it
      stirring as the winds blew warmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It made him cry out; it turned him into a scribbler of
      verses, a young Solomon, a cryer up of vanities--vanities.
      He wrote from his bed and from his chair, looking out at
      the warm crocuses in the grass of the square. He thought of
      himself as a little Heine, a man for whom the roses of
      Shiraz would bloom no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaper took note of it. Mr. St. George was writing poetry,
      something that went
      "Dumpty-dumpty--dumpty--dum--Dumpty--dum--dum dumpty." Now,
      what did this mean? In the spring, a young man's fancy?--
      Well, it seemed harmless enough, and it was poor--grizzling
      stuff, for Leaper continued to get a glimpse of some of it.
      It talked of grass and leaves that were dead even while
      they were green, and a cloud of gold that grew grey in the
      passing of five minutes. It asked if the roses were as red
      as the roses of yesterday. There was a something about a
      place called Maleham, a something with a tear in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaper stroked his chin--as he stroked it after shaving. He
      stroked Mr. St. George's chin in just the same way, and Mr.
      St. George could have bitten his clammy fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Treacly stuff."
    </p>
    <p>
      But when a young man wrote of himself lying in a living
      grave, and of a dying soul in a dead body, ought not other
      people to be informed? The doctor--for instance? You had a
      right to observe things and to reflect upon how they might
      affect your own particular position. And Leaper, having
      extracted two or three sheets of very melancholy rhyming,
      showed them to Dr. Dazely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may believe me or not, sir, but it's my opinion that
      it's time he went out of doors."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Dazely was so much of the same opinion that he
      consulted with Mrs. St. George, and Mrs. St. George's car
      was taken out of dock and a chauffeur engaged. The car was
      a limousine, and there was the problem of getting Alex into
      it. Something would have to be done, though it was not easy
      to get things done in the early months of 1919, but by
      means of bribery and persuasion Mrs. St. George did
      contrive to persuade a firm of coach-builders to prepare a
      plan and to undertake the necessary adaptations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, it would appear that the Greenwood girl--Mrs. St.
      George always thought of Kitty as the Greenwood girl--had
      vanished from Vernor Street. Leaper still bought cigarettes
      there. He made guarded inquiries about the other little
      lady. He was told that she had gone to take up a situation
      in the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George felt coldly triumphant.

      Kitty--of course--was at Shelford, and very busy effacing
      the memory of Miss Ives from the heart of Vine Cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      She began by lowering the blind of the shop and pinning a
      notice upon it--"This shop will be reopened later," but she
      did not say that it might differ from the shop of Miss
      Ives's days. Kitty was not attaching very great
      significance to the shop; it might be of use to her, and it
      might not; it might prove an infernal nuisance. Meanwhile,
      she set to work. It did not matter to her whether February
      blew and hailed or snowed. The river might look like
      ruffled lead, and Shelford as dead as a drowned water-vole.
      She gazed beyond the vicissitudes of the winter. She had
      her eyes on the days when the poplars would make a grey and
      pleasant shivering, and the grass would be green, and boats
      would come and go, and swans would float gracefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The furniture from her Vernor Street bedroom came down in a
      van, and she set up the bed in one of the bedrooms
      overlooking the river. She turned up her sleeves and got to
      work, but her labours were full of nicely calculated
      schemings. She had decided that the upper rooms could be
      left untouched for the time being, so far as paper and
      paint were concerned, but she attacked them with
      scrubbing-brush and bucket. But downstairs matters were
      very different. The long room with the big window, the
      passages and the parlour behind the shop were to be rose
      and cream. The rather greasy and dark little kitchen needed
      a new whiteness. She called in a local decorator, a little
      bun-faced man with bright eyes; a laconic fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want this work doing at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      He blinked and looked at her with a kind of depressing
      kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Easier said than done, miss. I've got three old men and
      two boys."
    </p>
    <p>
      She told him just why she wanted the work done as speedily
      as possible, and the direct simplicity of her purpose was
      more potent than a week's wheedling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have to make a home for my husband. He has come back
      from the war--paralyzed."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a good human argument, and Kitty's decorator
      rubbed his trousers, glanced at walls and doors with his
      bright eyes, and made calculations.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There will have to be a lot of stripping. You see all this
      old stuff--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She said: "Supposing I did the stripping? Not to shorten
      your job, but to save your old men's time."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was looking at a cracked ceiling, but when she made this
      offer, he looked directly at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've got to get right down to the plaster. You'd want
      steps and a plank. It's a dirty job."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No job's dirty when you are in earnest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's so."
    </p>
    <p>
      He meditated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could lend you a plank and a couple of step-ladders, and
      a stripping-knife."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's very good of you," said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      The step-ladders and a plank arrived next day in a
      hand-cart, and Kitty got to work. For three days she lived
      on tea and boiled eggs and sardines, and bread and jam.
      Each night she worked well into the small hours; she used
      up a number of candles, but she stripped the old papers
      from the two rooms, the passage and the kitchen. She made a
      bonfire of the debris in the garden. And when the lender of
      the step-ladders saw the result of her labours he nodded a
      hard round head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hope the chaps back from the war will do as well. I've got
      the wall paper and the paint. I'll put my men in
      to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      They were quiet, decent old fellows, and steady workers,
      and while they used paste and paint-brushes and
      stopping-knives, Kitty cut out and hemmed curtains. Mrs.
      Sarah had sent down a roll of green casement cloth that she
      had picked up as a bargain, and if ever a woman loved a
      bargain, it was Mrs. Sarah. She had much joy these days.
      Having engaged a girl to help Corah with the shop, she felt
      herself free to hunt bargains at all times and everywhere,
      and she hunted them from Hampstead to Croydon. Mr. Robert
      Parsons notified her of any sale that came within his ken,
      and so did various auctioneers and estate agents. There
      were parts of No. 7 Vernor Street that began to look all
      cluttered up like a dealer's shop, and Kitty's empty
      bedroom resembled a warehouse. And when she was not bargain
      hunting, Mrs. Sarah would go down to Shelford and trudge
      from the station with some monstrous parcel under her arm.
      Arriving hot and smiling and crinkling up her expressive
      nose, she would unpack all sorts of plunder, a bundle of
      table-knives, or electro-plated forks, towels,
      pillow-cases, a bedspread, a dozen tumblers, fire-irons,
      tablecloths, a set of enamelled saucepans, a cushion or
      two, and what not. Life still had an immense zest for her,
      life and all its accessories. She was as busy as a child
      helping to build a sand-castle, or a colonist erecting a
      blockhouse. Vine Cottage was both a nest and a
      fortress--Kitty's fortress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty, in a blue print frock, with her mop of
      honey-coloured hair like a halo of health and vigour,
      scrubbed paint and the interiors of cupboards, and stood on
      boxes to fasten up clips for the curtain rods, or ran
      downstairs periodically to see how her old men were getting
      on, or to make tea for them. She would come back to Mrs.
      Sarah with some of the flush of the rose-coloured wallpaper
      in her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's beginning to look lovely. They have finished the long
      room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's going to be a duck of a place, poppet. You will want
      a lot of tea-tables in the garden."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ought to be able to get a carpenter to make them. White
      tops and green legs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, plenty of colour," said her mother, "plenty of
      colour. People will want it after four years of khaki.
      Wouldn't be a bad idea to get some of those big
      umbrellas--red and blue. And deck chairs. I must keep my
      eyes open for deck chairs."
    </p>
    <p>
      So, Vine Cottage was full of pleasant noises, and human
      stirrings, and the old men working below heard the voices
      of the women who were busy above. "Makes you think of a
      couple of cats purring," said one whose white beard stuck
      out like the horn of a new moon. The little house took on a
      feeling of happiness, and Kitty grew happy in it with a
      sturdy and sanguine hopefulness. It did not make her feel
      strange to sleep there all alone. You heard the river
      running, and perhaps the wind in the trees, and all those
      queer little sounds that a house collects about itself. She
      had her particular happy moments in the day, and one of
      them was when she sat on a box in her bedroom and drank her
      tea, and watched a February sun trailing a net of gold
      across the river. She was beginning to know the river and
      to love it, in its grey moods, and its frosty moods, and
      its mornings of mist when the trees seemed hung with
      vapour. She would look across at the level meadows and the
      willows and the poplars, and especially at a row of
      Lombardy poplars glistening like spires when the sunlight
      fell on them in a certain way. She was full of the sweet
      and secret joy of possession, the joy of a woman, of a bird
      in the building of a nest. It was not for nothing that she
      had the breast and shoulders and hips of a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another happy moment came when her old men had gone, and
      she could wander about downstairs quite alone with herself
      and her cottage. The flush of the new papers and the
      creaminess of the fresh paint spread from room to room,
      and, ignoring step-ladders and planks and trestle-tables
      and paint-pots, she would stand and visualize her rooms as
      they were to be. Particularly the long room, the room of
      her great expectations. She would sit on the window-sill
      with the river and the sunset behind her, looking--with her
      perfect skin--as fresh as the new paint, her eyes like two
      sloes, her chin thrust out. Yes, she wanted a
      camel-coloured carpet for this room. The bed should be over
      there. And in the daytime Alex should have a long chair by
      the window, and lie and look at the river and across it to
      those quiet meadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes--with a hand laid along one cheek, she would sit
      and wonder whether he would be happy here? Were men ever
      satisfied unless they were doing things, playing games, or
      setting out to capture or kill something? Was there no
      adventure in the capturing to one's self? But to lie still
      and do nothing but read of what other people had done or
      were doing! Would he or any man be content with that? Would
      she want him to be content with it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face would take on a white and brooding seriousness.
      She was an active little person; she was the daughter of
      Mrs. Sarah. She had experienced Alex's indolence; she knew
      that he could sit and stare. But was she going to let him
      sit and stare in the hypothetical and near future for which
      she was preparing? Men and children have to be kept amused.
      Yes, she might have to exercise patience, a dear and
      solicitous cunning. It is possible that she realized even
      in those days that Alex might have to be re-made--that he
      might be difficult. But then--the making of Alex and the
      making of a living man were the two halves of her apple.
      She was like a wise child with a doll from whose body the
      sawdust has been leaking, and a bleeding doll does not
      inspire a feeling of self-righteousness in your potential
      mother. Never would she be a prig in her attitude towards
      her husband.

    </p>
    <p>
      Two days before her old men were due to leave her Kitty had
      to consider further matters, the near arrival of her
      furniture, and the state of the Vine Cottage garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the garden was to be the shop window, her
      picture-poster, and Kitty knew something of shop windows.
      With your shop window you had to catch and hold the eyes
      and the curiosity behind the eyes of the people who passed
      up and down your street. The river was to be Kitty's
      street. As she said to her mother--"I can't compete with
      Fred Karno, at least not yet--but I can get people looking.
      And after getting them to look I have got to get them to
      land." In brief, she wanted that garden to be gay and
      cheerful and alluring. She wanted it to be a live
      picture-poster, vivid and compelling. She was ready to let
      herself go considerably over that garden, and even the big
      white boat-house next door. A garden implied a gardener.
      She spoke to her old men on the subject during their
      dinner-hour, when they sat on a plank in the shop and drank
      the tea she had warmed up for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They discussed it as matters of simple importance are
      discussed by men of their class, not for the doing of a
      favour but for the supplying of a need. The young men were
      beginning to come back to Shelford, but Kitty did not want
      a young man about the place, nor did her chorus of old men
      acclaim youth. And for once in a way they were right, for
      already the ex-soldier was showing himself to be in many
      cases a man who had lost the habit of work. Her chorus
      discussed possible individuals. There was Tom this and Fred
      that. It was he of the sickle beard who remembered Old
      George.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Old George."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He might be the man for you, miss. But he was always such
      a chap for chopping and changing."
    </p>
    <p>
      They called him Old George Venables, though he was ten
      years younger than the youngest of them. He lived in Mill
      Lane. He had served for a year in a Labour Battalion in
      France. He was married, but had no children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty wanted to know more of George Venables. Why this
      fickleness, this "chopping and changing?" She was in search
      of a reliable man, not a leaf blowing about on a puddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--it's not in 'is 'abits, miss. He likes variety, does
      Old George, a bit o' this and a bit o' that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean--in his work?"
    </p>
    <p>
      That was so. Old George was a quick-change artiste in the
      world of labour. As he of the sickle beard put it: "He'll
      do a bit of gardening one month, and then a job of rough
      painting. Next week you'll see him mending a fence.
      Summer-times he used to take on with Mr. Bunt next door as
      boatman. He could do a bit of boat-building, too. Variety.
      George is all for variety."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he a steady man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, yes, steady enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      The three old men exchanged glances. It appeared that Old
      George had a wife who was crippled with rheumatism. It had
      been a childless marriage, and as in many such marriages
      all the devotion had gone to one person. Old George was
      devoted to his wife; she had been a fine strong woman, and
      now that she was crippled her man could not do enough for
      her. Yes, Old George was steadfast. It appeared to Kitty
      that the man with a passion for variety was held in
      peculiar affection by these other men.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not drink? Bless you--no! You never saw Old George
      inside a pub. All his spare money went to his wife; it had
      been spent upon doctors and quack medicines and magical
      gold rings warranted to cure rheumatism in a month. It
      appeared that at home he did a great deal of the house
      work, and most of the week's washing. "Won't let her put
      her hands in water, miss, or stand about hanging up the
      washin'." Also, he kept a piece of garden, and half a dozen
      hens, and a hutch of rabbits. Yes, Old George was a bit of
      a character.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sent a message to Mr. Venables by the mouth of one of
      her old men, and at nine o'clock next morning Old George
      turned up at Vine Cottage. He stood about five feet seven;
      he had a straw-coloured and drooping moustache, downy hair
      on his cheeks, and a pair of clear blue eyes. They were
      extraordinarily honest eyes, and full of that rare English
      kindness. His face suggested to Kitty a blend of the walrus
      and the brown spaniel. The sleeves of his coat were patched
      at the elbows; he wore khaki trousers; he was meticulously
      clean.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said to him: "I am wanting a man who can turn his hand
      to anything. I hear you can do most things. I can't afford
      to pay very high wages, but I'll pay you as much as I can,
      and more perhaps when I can afford it. I am making a home
      and trying to make a living--to keep my husband, who was
      badly hurt in the war."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her fixedly with his blue eyes. He was an
      inarticulate creature, as such men often are. His hands
      were more capable than his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What sort of work, miss?"--for he, like her three old
      men--could not remember somehow to call her "ma'am."
    </p>
    <p>
      She took him out into the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want this little garden to be the brightest thing on the
      river anywhere between Staines and Shepperton. I'll tell
      you why. I am going to give teas and dances. I want to make
      people in boats stop here. So you see--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was very deliberate. His blue eyes seemed to take in
      this and that, and her and the river, and the hypothetical
      boating-parties. Various he might be, but he had an eye for
      the practical; he could develop an enthusiasm for what was
      practical.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said that there might be something in it, but where were
      her people going to dance?
    </p>
    <p>
      She pointed to the big white boathouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But there's no floor to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly. That is where the practical man comes in. We have
      to put in a floor, and cut away some of the walls and put
      in trellis and bright curtains, and make it pretty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would cost money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. I'm not spoiling the job for the price of a pot
      of paint."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Going to keep any boats?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I might keep two or three, and a punt or two."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's that other shed," said he; "I know Bunt's old
      place--inside out; let's go and have a look."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had him interested. She had touched that which lay
      behind his dog-like eyes--an inherent hankering after
      variety, adventure, a certain boyishness that had never
      been satisfied. She had made a way for herself through the
      fence separating the two pieces of ground, and she had the
      key of the boat-house with her. She gave him the key.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want it talked about--yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll hear enough gossip without startin' it. Lucky for
      you, miss, the house is on a brick standing, and good
      brickwork, too. I helped to mix the mortar--so I ought to
      know."
    </p>
    <p>
      He unlocked one of the pair of double doors, and stood
      measuring the interior with his eyes. She left him alone
      for the moment. He rubbed his nose, and pushed his cap
      back, took out a knife and jabbed here and there at the
      timber framing. She saw the back of his neck wrinkle as he
      looked up at the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cost a bit of money to floor this in, miss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Straightforward job--though. Could do it--myself. You'd
      need a few brick pillars down the middle to carry the
      joists. You wanted the walls open in places, did you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, for light. They could be filled in with trellis or
      curtains, couldn't they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Easy."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stroked his nose with finger and thumb, as though
      stroking it assisted the flow of ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you'd have to shut 'em up in bad weather. Rain would
      drive in. Besides--if you let a gale of wind into a place
      like this--the roof might lift. Simple as pie--though. Use
      the wood you cut out for shutters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much would the floor cost, Mr. Venables?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Timber's up. Have to get prices. You'd want good boards,
      too--tongued and grooved stuff--I reckon."
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached the door and stood looking at a black shed that
      stood under the summer shade of three big chestnut-trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You could keep a couple of boats and a punt in there.
      Needs a little pitching and tarring. And the river staging
      ain't exactly reassuring. But then--a bit at a time."
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood looking at each other. He waited. She named the
      sum she was able to pay him, and then he made a suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suppose I were to put in full time, miss, till the place
      is shipshape. Afterwards you wouldn't be wanting me the
      whole week, perhaps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Week-ends--chiefly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's so. I could do a bit here, and a bit somewhere
      else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As long as I'm sure of you, Mr. Venables, when I want
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You could be sure of that, miss."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him her confidence from that moment, and she was
      wise in the giving of it, for in the days that followed Old
      George never let her down.

    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of a March day that had seen the furniture
      carried into Vine Cottage by two vanmen assisted by Old
      George, Kitty was drawn to stand by the big window and
      watch the windy sunset blown about beyond the branches of
      the poplars. She looked down across that strip of grass
      between the laurel hedges and the high red-brick wall, and
      its greenness--dipping into the ruffled silver of the
      river--seemed a pathway for her thoughts. The men had gone.
      They had been very patient men, careful of the new paint
      and paper, and obedient to the autocratic enthusiasms of
      the little thing in the blue linen dress. "No--farther this
      way, please. No--I think we will try it over there."
      Probably they had understood that there was something
      sacramental in the placing of individual pieces of
      furniture, and Mrs. Sarah, who was very much present, had
      given them beer money.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, Vine Cottage was dressed and garnished, a nest lined
      and ready, and Kitty stood at the window and looked at the
      sunset over the river. Her little world was ready, but at
      the end of a happy day she had felt her little world's
      sudden emptiness. She had done so much and got so little.
      You might caress things with hands and glances, and yet
      they might remain an empty bed and an untrodden carpet,
      unalive, lacking their full significance. She was tired.
      From somewhere came the tapping of a hammer, the
      indefatigable mother tacking up a curtain valance in one of
      the bedrooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty put her arms up over her head. She knelt down and
      pressed her firm little bosom against the low window-shelf.
      The red of the sky was changing to slate and purple; a
      blackness seemed to unfurl itself across the river. She
      heard a blackbird calling. And suddenly her mother came
      into the room and stood between the door and the bed, and
      for a moment neither woman moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Kitty said: "I'm--I'm glad I did not have a baby."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her arms slipped down; her head seemed to droop a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't even begun--yet, mother. I haven't even--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah's face became strangely distorted. She was still
      a very strong woman--in spite of her age--and she went and
      picked up her daughter. She carried her to the bed, and
      sitting down on it and making a lap, she nursed her child,
      and she nursed her with a kind of fierceness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold on tight, poppet, hold tight. Things come--when we
      want them--Sure. Didn't I get what I wanted?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty clung to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--I'm tired--somehow. I seem to have been walking all
      day--and I haven't got any farther. How do I know--? It may
      be just a doll's house I'm playing with."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It might be--my dear," said her mother, "if you were a
      doll. Which you're not."

      On that same March day there were other storms. A
      north-east wind blowing a sky to tatters above the stately
      sequestrations of Cardigan Square made the plane-trees rock
      and the windows rattle. People lost their hats and chased
      them. Feminine figures seemed troubled concerning their
      shortening petticoats while young St. George lay at a
      window and watched them. He, too, was troubled. It was as
      though the north-east wind had blown a weight of rotting
      leaves away, and uncovered a corpse, but yet a thing that
      was not quite a corpse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though, in the sense that ennui is death, Clara St.
      George's son had come very near to death. The sweet, soft
      pulp of him had ceased to tremble even in verse. He had had
      a week of lethargy, of extreme stagnation. He had lain and
      stared, or fingered things as though he neither knew the
      use of them nor cared to use them. He had given Leaper no
      trouble. Almost it had begun to appear that Mrs. St. George
      had done her work so thoroughly and reduced the man in her
      son to such pulp that he was both cured and killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Leaper carried up Mr. St. George's lunch, a nicely
      browned sole, a ham omelet, and a sponge custard, Mr. St.
      George looked consideringly at the soft stuff and refused
      it. Leaper had lifted the lids of the hot dishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want it. Take it away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just try a little of this, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled, wheedling the child like a superior nurse, and
      next moment Mr. St. George had sworn at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damn you, take it away."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaper's jaw fell on its hinge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why--the hell--don't you bring me up something to bite at,
      a good red steak? This pap--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll tell the cook, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaper was thinking of his own dinner. If his patient chose
      to be peevish, well--Leaper had known patients far more
      peevish than Mr. St. George, patients who had had the dirty
      habits and the mischievous trickiness of monkeys. He was
      ordered to take away that toothless lunch, and to bring up
      a good crusty piece of bread and some Cheshire cheese. He
      was told to push both the bed-tables close to the chair,
      and to hand Mr. St. George his pair of field-glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, sir," said Leaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gentlemen had to be humoured, and if it amused Mr. St.
      George to use a pair of field-glasses to watch the sparrows
      in the square, and a cat out hunting, and the faces and the
      ankles of the girls and women who happened to pass across
      it, well and good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George was lunching with a friend at Claridge's.
      Her son ate his bread and cheese with the look of a man
      munching in prison. Leaper had noticed a wideness of Mr.
      St. George's eyes, a dark and dilated shadowiness of the
      pupils, as though the March wind had blown apart a pair of
      wavering curtains. And in very truth--it had.
    </p>
    <p>
      For consciousness is a variable state, and especially so in
      sensitive people. It may narrow its field, or suddenly
      expand, reaching out beyond and above its utilitarian
      limits, and Alex St. George's consciousness had contracted
      under the pressure of monotony. A man may be so fatally
      bored that his attention to life may degenerate into mere
      vacant gazing. So, Alex would spend his hours watching
      sparrows busy over a gift of God, the droppings of a horse;
      or some prowling cat, or the smoke slanting from the
      chimneys. He had lain sunk in a little pit of apathy.
      Nothing happened, nothing that mattered. And then had come
      this March wind, blustering, shouting, bursting doors open
      with the swing of its barbarian shoulders. It carried a
      whip--this wind--and it had whipped him, made the
      crouching, staring man in him start up with a cry of anger
      and of pain. The world was alive. The spring was coming,
      coming with a March madness--

    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaper had finished his dinner, and was giving his blue
      serge suit a brush and a flick before going out for his
      daily walk, with a mongrel dog that he kept in a
      neighbouring mews, when he heard a crash in Mr. St.
      George's room. He stood listening, clothes-brush poised
      over his left shoulder. There was another crash, an echoing
      bump on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaper rushed up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The electric table-lamp beside the bed toppled over--and
      smashed its globe upon the floor as Leaper threw the door
      open. He stood and stared, his lower jaw fallen like the
      hinged jaw of a ventriloquist's dummy. Mr. St. George was
      still throwing things, anything that he could lay his hands
      upon. His mouth was open as though to shout, but no sound
      came from it. His furious activity had a kind of dreadful
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaper found his own voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. St. George--sir--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He believed for the moment that his patient had gone mad.
      The cheese-plate, whirled like a discus, struck the mirror
      above the mantelpiece, starred and cracked it, and fell to
      smash upon the fire-irons. A book hit a picture fair and
      square and brought the glass splintering down. The
      gramophone lay overturned on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. St. George, sir--Mr. St. George--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He edged round the end of the bed, dodging a book that went
      by.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. St. George, sir, not that, sir, that's ink, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the ink-bottle, flying like Luther's shot at the devil,
      spent itself in a blue splodge upon the wall, and Leaper,
      dodging in, grabbed the cheese knife that was lying upon
      one of the tables. He had had his eye on that knife from
      the moment that he had entered the room. Meanwhile, there
      was nothing more to throw, and Mr. St. George sat and
      panted, with a redness at the back of his widely dilated
      pupils. He began to shout; he was amazingly excited,
      voluble, almost incoherent. His hands gripped the arms of
      his chair; his hair looked all blown about as by a wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Smashing things--what! Bloody fine show. By God--how I
      have wanted to smash things. I'd smash every damned thing
      in the house. You too--you--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He went off into sudden laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Put the wind up you--grabbing that knife! You've got a
      front-line face. It's the March wind. Why, man--I
      believe--What do I believe? You can't guess, can you? O, go
      to hell."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaper, having slipped the knife into his pocket, made
      soothing noises, and moved deprecating hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all right, sir. You have had a real fine beano,
      sir. Smashed things. Splendid, sir!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He found Mr. St. George's eyes fixed on him with a strange,
      flaring look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't know--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir--"
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice became a harsh cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By God, man! get me out of this. I can't stand it--I can't
      stand any more of it--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, sir--Now just you lie down. The car will be
      ready to-morrow, sir. We'll get you out--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Mr. St. George collapsed, and lay back with closed
      eyes and hands that opened and closed with little jerks.
      His face went white. And Leaper, considerably scared,
      hurried out to the telephone on the landing, and rang up
      Dr. Dazely and Mrs. St. George.

    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George was the first to arrive. She came in with
      her dish of ice, and very erect, to meet the emergency, her
      colour heightened by the wind. Her blue eyes stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear boy--what is this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaper had touched nothing. My lady should see the wreckage
      and be properly impressed by it, for even Leaper had a
      dog's sympathy with another dog who was kept chained to his
      kennel; and she saw it all--the broken glass, the starred
      mirror, that explosive patch of ink upon the wall. But
      chiefly she was conscious of her son as an inert figure
      lying back in the cushioned chair by the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Alex--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice protested. "Why? Why this absurd violence?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was fed up with things."
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down. She said--"You must learn to control
      yourself," and became aware of his eyes looking at her
      momentarily with a veiled quietude which she took to be
      sulkiness. She sat there, and with an austere and correct
      kindness scolded him, and gave him a number of admirable
      reasons to prove that such behaviour was unjustified. He
      said never a word. He lay and looked out into the square.
      His silence appeared to accept her scoldings, and she saw
      in him no more than a sullen child, mute and unconfessedly
      ashamed of a rage-storm. She did not detect resistance in
      him, or appreciate the quality of his silence, or suspect
      that the soul of him was looking out at her from under
      drooping and sly eyelids. He was controlling himself. A new
      self-restraint had come to him after that outburst, and
      with it a new vision. Inwardly he had broken his chain. He
      had had a sudden startling glimpse of life out there. With
      eyes closed he had set his teeth and made a new profession
      of faith. His--"I believe" had come like the March wind.
      Yet--even without this belief, he could have said fiercely
      to his mother--"I don't care. I want life and I want her. I
      don't care what she has been. If she were a harlot--I
      should want her. She's alive. And I'm alive."
    </p>
    <p>
      But he said nothing. He lay and clasped a new and secret
      exultation, a subtle sense of adventure. His attitude was
      that of a person who had realized that escape was both
      desirable and possible, and every fibre of his new
      aliveness tingled with opposition. But he opposed her with
      silence. It may be that he had begun to suspect and that
      his sudden and violent physical confession of faith had
      torn his docility to tatters. He both believed and
      disbelieved. He was in silent and deep revolt. He was ready
      to conspire, but in secret. He did not say that he was
      sorry. "A man must smash things--sometimes." His mother
      made it plain to him that she considered such barbarisms to
      be childish.

      Dr. Dazely put in an appearance an hour later. He saw, he
      heard, he questioned. He polished the situation as he would
      have polished his monocle with a silk handkerchief, and
      then looked through it like a polite and sympathetic family
      adviser. Obviously Mr. St. George had had an attack of
      hysteria--O, yes, hysteria was not a feminine monopoly.
      Also, it was a war product, a very real problem. The whole
      of Europe was just a little hysterical at the moment.
      Reaction, you know, after four years of tension and terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said: "We must get him out. He wants movement, the wind
      on his face."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George knew that the coach-builders had promised
      the car for to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--send him out--with Leaper. Not too far at first. And
      if you will excuse me--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He aimed at diplomacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let him go--quite alone. People--yes--even the best of
      friends--yes, even you, dear lady, devoted as you are. Let
      him feel the wind--and movement. And then--perhaps--in a
      month's time--St. Leonards--or Bournemouth--or one of those
      little places on the Dorset coast."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George accepted his suggestions.

      The car was ready next day, and the first time for some
      four months Alex St. George emerged from No. 77 Cardigan
      Square, being carried downstairs in a carrying-chair by
      Leaper and the chauffeur. The coach-builders had so adapted
      the bodywork that a long door would allow an invalid to be
      lifted into the car, and laid on the seat with his legs
      supported upon cushions. Mrs. St. George attended. She
      carried a rug. It was she who tucked her son in. A
      speaking-tube had been fitted, and the flexible end of it
      with its mouthpiece hung clipped within reach of Alex's
      hand. She pointed it out to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you should feel tired--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks mater--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled and bent to kiss him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is--quite--an adventure for you--I have told them not
      to go too far, nor too fast."
    </p>
    <p>
      They set out, with Leaper beside the driver. They drove to
      Putney Bridge, and across it, and climbed the hill to
      Wimbledon Common. The March sky was all movement of masses
      of white cloud hurrying, of sudden sunlight and of sudden
      shadow. A wind was blowing; Alex could see the leafless
      branches swaying, and gorse bushes quaking, but he was shut
      away from the wind. He felt that he had but exchanged one
      glass case for another, and that this car was nothing more
      than a cabinet on wheels. The slim birch-trees were
      agitated as the trees and bushes are blown and shaken in a
      film. He was seeing life on the screen; he was not part of
      it. But--wait--! Somehow--he would manage to get the wind
      and the rain in his face. There had been no more storms. He
      had shown them all a deep docility. He looked at the back
      of Leaper's head with its colourless hair tending to curl
      over his coat collar. Damn the fellow! His hair needed
      cutting.
    </p>
    <p>
      They pulled up on the Common. It was splashed with sunlight
      and shadow. Leaper came and opened a door and putting on
      his smile, was unctuously attentive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not feeling tired, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Warm enough, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We thought we would be turning back, sir, now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. St. George nodded, and Leaper closed the door. The
      simile of the glass case on wheels was re-emphasized.
      Obviously, he was shut up in a cabinet, and Leaper was the
      curator. As they returned down Putney Hill it occurred to
      him to wonder what would happen were he to shout an order
      through the speaking-tube--"Drive me to Vernor Street."
      Almost, his right hand trembled towards the mouthpiece, but
      the impulse was restrained by a wisdom that was learning to
      wait. No, he had a better idea than that; he was not going
      to betray to them his March aliveness; he had been thinking
      things out; he had a letter in his mind, and he would keep
      it secreted in his mind until he could snatch his
      opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother met him as he was being carried into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enjoyed it, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled upwards, and yet not directly at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather."

    <p>
      Mr. St. George's electric reading-lamp was out of order. It
      had suffered during the March storm, and though Leaper--who
      rather fancied himself as an electrician--had tinkered with
      it, the lamp refused to glow. There were reasons why it did
      not glow, but Leaper was left in the darkness. The light
      plug was close to the bed, and within reach of Mr. St.
      George's hands, and with a rubber tobacco pouch covering a
      hand that held a pair of nail scissors Mr. St. George had
      tampered with the plug.
    </p>
    <p>
      An electrician was sent for. In 1919 no one hastened to
      work. The expected electrician did not arrive for three
      days. He appeared on the afternoon of the fourth day, a
      sulky young man, sharp nosed, with a face scarred with
      acne. Mrs. St. George was attending a committee-meeting;
      Leaper had gone for his afternoon walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      A maid knocked at Mr. St. George's door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes--what is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man to see to the electric light, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. St. George's eyes grew very alive in an interested
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--send him in."
    </p>
    <p>
      The electrician was admitted, wearing a hat. He had the
      1919 mood upon him when a certain type of man set out to
      make himself vehemently awkward and uncomforting everywhere
      and on all possible occasions, a sulkily aggressive young
      man nursing a world's grievance. Alex gave him a "Good
      afternoon," and the electrician replied with a stare. He
      was all bristles. Here was a rich young rotter slacking in
      a long chair, one of the world's parasites, a creature
      nicely washed and tailored.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his black handbag on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think--it's the plug that's wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man opened his bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's my job. You can leave it to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      He extracted tools and laid them on the bed. He felt rude
      and he was rude. His very movements conveyed a jerky scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alex said: "I'm sorry to trouble you, but I'm paralyzed; I
      can't use my legs. I wonder if you would pass me that
      writing-pad."
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man darted a sharp glance over his shoulder. He
      seemed to hesitate for a moment. The tip of his tongue came
      out and moistened his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Got servants--haven't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes--but I don't want to trouble them."
    </p>
    <p>
      The electrician was looking for a bell. He moved across the
      room towards the fireplace. He slouched; he reached out a
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait a moment," said the voice from the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alex saw the sharp, supercilious smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you can ring the bell for me you can chuck over that
      writing-pad. It's on that table. As one ex-soldier--to
      another--"
    </p>
    <p>
      The man crossed to the table, and did as Alex had
      suggested. He chucked the writing-pad; it alighted with a
      smack on the bedtable beside the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wasn't in the army. No such fool."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," said Alex.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence between them. Alex wrote a letter, while
      the electrician began to test the lamp, and then to fiddle
      with the wall plug. He made occasional and scornful noises,
      but mostly he was silent, vehemently silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he said: "What dashed sort of fool has been
      messin' about with this thing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The other's voice was cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You!"--and in the inflection added--"you would."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I messed it up on purpose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, did you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're my lucky number--you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      The electrician was on his knees. Curiosity gave to his
      face a sort of sharp and sinister smirk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't--think! What's on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want you to put a stamp on a letter and post it for me
      when you go out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you own a stamp in a place like this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't a stamp, and I haven't any money--I'm not
      supposed to want any. I'm not supposed to do any work. Damn
      it, man, I'd give ten years of my life to be down on my
      knees like you are, fiddling with that thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never did a day's work--I suppose--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here," said Alex, leaning over the arm of the chair;
      "if you saw a man lying smashed up at the bottom of a hole,
      you'd help him. O--yes--you would. It wouldn't
      matter--You'd just jump down without thinking. And you
      would be doing me a favour. I haven't the price of a stamp
      on me. I'm not going to offer you my fountain-pen or a
      packet of cigarettes. I dare say you might want to spit in
      my face. But--damn you--post this letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be damned to you--too," said the man, "but I will."

      Never was a letter more strangely stamped and posted. It
      was delivered at No.7 Vernor Street next morning, and since
      Mrs. Sarah was breakfasting in bed, the letter was placed
      on her tray and carried up by the woman who came in to
      light fires, cook the breakfast and make the beds. The
      letter was addressed to Mrs. Alex St. George, and when Mrs.
      Sarah recognized the handwriting she seemed to break out
      into a sudden heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When did this come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "First post."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah pushed the tray at the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here, take this; put it on the chest of drawers. I must
      get up at once. I'll manage some breakfast while I'm
      dressing. And find me a taxi, will you, Florrie--there's a
      good woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This hinstant?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, he can wait."
    </p>
    <p>
      In her comings and goings between the combining of a toilet
      and a breakfast, Mrs. Sarah found time to hurry out on to
      the landing and to call her elder daughter. She told a
      sleepy Corah the news, a Corah who came out of her room
      looking prettily dishevelled and excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not really?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going straight down to Shelford. Not trusting it to
      the post. Besides"--and she gave one of her human
      smirks--"I want to know what's inside it. Simply
      bursting--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was at Shelford at half-past ten. She found a taxi
      outside the station, and climbing in with an air of solid
      haste, she gave the man the address. "Vine Cottage. Know
      it? I'm in a hurry." In fact, she sat erect on the seat,
      refusing to lean back against the cushions, a stout woman
      who had the appearance of being out of breath. On pulling
      up at Vine Cottage she told the man to wait. "May want you
      again. Anyway--I pay." She found the green front door
      unlocked and went in, calling to her daughter. They met in
      the passage. She seemed to push the letter at Kitty with
      both hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Came this morning. Read it. I've got a taxi waiting if we
      should want it--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty looked at the letter. The flash of a sudden emotion
      seemed to withdraw itself into her eyes. She turned and
      walked back into the kitchen, and Mrs. Sarah did not follow
      her. In the kitchen Kitty had been busy lining the cupboard
      shelves with clean white paper, and the scissors lay on the
      table. She sat down at the table, with her elbows resting
      upon it; she held the envelope between her two hands and
      looked at it; she seemed to look at it a long while.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a quick thrust of the right hand she reached for the
      scissors, slit the envelope, drew out the letter, read it,
      and when she had read it she sat for a time, staring. Her
      face, very white over the opening of the letter, regained
      its colour, and with it its warm creaminess and its bloom.
      The lips, pale from being pressed firmly together, ripened
      suddenly like red fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah had betaken herself to the long room with the
      big window. With her philosophy of "Don't fuss" she
      understood the virtues of occasional solitude. She sat down
      on the bed and reproved it for its creakings.
      "What's--your--trouble? No need for--you--to feel
      flustered." There was no doubt as to her own agitation; it
      was absurd and it was splendid. She felt like a Dutch ketch
      full of cargo rolling in a heavy sea. She found a very
      clean handkerchief and wiped her face, and got up with an
      air of solid serenity and straightened a picture, though
      she could not decide after making the adjustment whether
      the thing really did hang straight. Her emotions were
      clamorous and crowded, emotions that had to be smacked and
      told to sit still. What a long time the girl was--
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she heard Kitty's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah sailed down the passage to find Kitty closing
      the kitchen window and fastening the catch. The letter had
      disappeared, and the papers had been cleared away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He wants me. I'm just locking up."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was solemn as fate, full of sudden practical
      preoccupations, and Mrs. Sarah had to button up all that
      emotion, and did it, and was proud of it, and proud of
      Kitty, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A good thing I kept the taxi."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty was locking the garden door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's as I thought. He had none of my letters. They stopped
      his. He smuggled this one out by a man who came to see to
      the electric light."
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood a moment, rapt, a woman with the words of a
      love-letter in her heart, and anger in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll never forgive her. I know what to do now. I'll go and
      pack my bag. Venables can keep an eye on the place. He's at
      work on the boat-house."
    </p>
    <p>
      She went upstairs, leaving her mother sitting on a kitchen
      chair with the air of a solid rock emerging from the swell
      of a passing wave. Kitty meant business, and she was Mrs.
      Sarah's daughter. Mrs. St. George had better look to her
      defences.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now--I just wonder how she will do it?" thought Mrs.
      Sarah, immensely intrigued--"I just wonder! But she will do
      it. I'm glad I'm alive."

    </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon it rained, but gently so, for the day had a
      moist tranquillity, dispersing moisture out of a dove-grey
      sky. The pavements and the roadway were darkened by the
      wetness, and the branches of the plane-trees glistened. The
      grass in the gardens looked more green and though the
      crocuses lay prone in their paling shrouds, daffodils were
      spearing upwards. Sparrows chirped and fussed. Spring had
      put out a hand and drawn a curtain and let a breath of
      balminess into this London square where a man lay at a
      window and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George had remained at home. She had come to join
      her son and was sitting in an arm-chair before the fire,
      reading some pamphlet or other that was anti-this or
      anti-that. Her back was towards Alex. He could see the
      crown of her fair head rising like a pale sun above the
      blue horizon of the chair's back; he listened to her
      regular turning of the pages; he was so nervous and so
      tensely strung that he was afraid of infecting her with his
      nervousness. He wanted her there in that chair, anywhere
      but at a window. He felt that he would rage at her were she
      to get up and impose her interference upon the anguish of a
      secret suspense. He was terribly excited and keeping still.
      Almost he had been counting the minutes of daylight that
      were left to him. Would anything happen? He pretended to
      read and to watch the comings and goings in the square. His
      mother was a stranger interposing the menace of her
      presence between him and a possible freedom, a frost ready
      to fall, a female Pluto capable of dragging him back into
      the underworld. He knew now what an escape into the air and
      the sunlight would mean to him--joy, the joy of a wholesome
      living, of touching the live flesh. It would mean an escape
      from the house of a slow decadence, of desires slowly
      soiled by an insidious perversion, of habits twisted into
      deformity. Yes, escape from a scented, warmed, slimed
      existence when you lay abed with your own hot youth and
      felt the helplessness of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And out there--somewhere--was Kitty, a little live thing
      with arms and breasts and lips and a soul. He saw his
      salvation in her. She would protect him from a dreaded
      uncleanness even as she had covered his head and his fear
      with her arms. He was a man to be rescued, and he knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But would she come? Had that sulky devil posted that
      letter? Did she care now? Could she forgive?
    </p>
    <p>
      He had no god to whom he could pray, nothing to which he
      could hold save to the feet of that great grey figure of
      compassion, human and yet dim, shaping itself from the
      world's doubts and disillusionments and the dead bones of
      dead beliefs. For--if we cannot pity each other, then
      indeed is consciousness but a dung-heap in which maggots
      swarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Kitty came. She appeared in Cardigan Square at about
      half-past three on that wet afternoon, a little figure in a
      dark blue rain coat, skirting the high iron railings of the
      garden. She carried an open umbrella. Immediately opposite
      the house she paused, and dipping her open umbrella, stood
      at gaze, her eyes searching the windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alex gave one glance at the top of his mother's head. He
      leaned towards the window, and waved a hand. He was sure
      that the eyes in that distant face were fixed upon his
      window. He waved again, and she made a dipping movement
      with her umbrella. She nodded. To Alex her face was like a
      little glowing disc of very bright light.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt faint. The whole of him seemed to have passed
      suddenly out through his eyes. With his face close to the
      glass of the window he saw her raise her umbrella and move
      slowly away. Was she going and so soon? Or was there a
      method in her movement? He watched her disappear round the
      railings; he reached for his field-glasses. Mrs. St. George
      rustled the paper of her pamphlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt a sudden anger against his mother. Surely she was
      not going to get up and come to the window? He saw her head
      move; she bent and poked the fire, and sat poised for a
      moment, holding the poker. Then she put it down, and lay
      back in her chair. Alex breathed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was able to turn again to the window. His throat felt
      tight and dry, and he knew that he was trembling. He saw
      Kitty reappearing. She had circled the gardens. Her
      umbrella was up, and this time he noticed that she was
      carrying what appeared to be a large flat cardboard box
      done up in whitish-brown paper. He raised the field-glasses
      to discover that there were words hand-printed on the flat
      face of the parcel; he focussed the glasses; he found that
      he could distinguish the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was conscious of a burst of inward applause. The
      cleverness of it--the simplicity! This--was--Kitty. She
      paused over there, her umbrella screening her face. He
      read.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No letters reached me till the last. Door shut--always. I
      wrote often. Same as ever. Just waited. Make sign if you
      can read. Here--below--to-night--about 6.30."
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached for the tassel of the spring blind and managed
      to grasp it. He saw her umbrella lowered. He drew the blind
      sharply down, and let it slide up again. He did this twice.
      Her umbrella dipped twice in response.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George made a sudden movement. She turned her
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What--are--you doing, Alex?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered her with a note of gaiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seeing if the blind sticks, mater. It stuck yesterday.
      Wish the rain would stop. You can't see anything but
      umbrellas."
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      III
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      There came into Alex St. George's mind a memory that
      recalled another instance of his mother's interference--a
      memory of a pretty housemaid named Rose and of himself--a
      boy of ten--romping together, and of his mother coming upon
      them suddenly like a cat surprising two young birds. He had
      never forgotten the look on his mother's face. He had been
      taken into her bedroom to be told that "Gentlemen did not
      romp with servants." He had had a feeling that his mother
      had been shocked, that something in her had been outraged;
      she had made him feel ashamed without his being able to
      understand his shame. And Rose had been snipped off with a
      pair of scissors and tossed out of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lay and looked at the top of his mother's head. He
      discovered to his great surprise that he was less angered
      by his mother's lies than by his own acceptance of her
      lies. He had been nothing of a man. He had allowed her to
      treat his faith in Kitty as she had treated the girl
      Rose--to hustle it out of the house into the street. Yes,
      he thought that he understood it all now. She had felt
      outraged by his passion for Kitty. She had feared the sex
      in her son, and her natural impulse had been to take a whip
      to any woman who was dangerous. Her glances had whipped
      that rosy-faced housemaid. And had she had her way she
      would have whipped Kitty, and with contumely and clamour
      have driven her naked down Regent Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      But--good God--!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was immensely shocked. He found himself looking with
      curiosity and some fear at the top of his mother's head.
      What an outrage she had conceived, and how ruthlessly she
      had carried it out! She had treated him as something less
      than a child. She had hired people to lie to him. She had
      insulted him with Leaper. She had purloined his letters. It
      seemed incredible, but he knew it to be true.
    </p>
    <p>
      His anger against Leaper was bitter, being reinforced by
      the smell of the man, and by the thought of his smiling,
      superior slyness. Faugh! To have been touched and handled
      by Leaper, fooled by Leaper, lied to by Leaper!
    </p>
    <p>
      He lay very still.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard a movement on the landing. The clock had struck
      four. The door opened, and he heard Leaper's voice, and
      caught a glimpse of that hinged smile and of those pale and
      suborned blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I bring up tea for two, madam?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George sat forward in her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, for two, Leaper."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave the order with casual calmness; she rose; she
      walked to the other window. She seemed unaware of her son's
      silence, and of the vehemence of it, or of the deep
      humiliation he had discovered in her treachery. He lay with
      every sensitive outlet closed against her. He felt that he
      hated her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tea was brought in and the tray placed on the occasional
      table by the fire. Mrs. St. George returned to the fire and
      sat down. She poured out her son's tea, and Leaper stood to
      carry it to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Toast, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      If ever the outraged child in a man conceived an impulse
      Alex St. George's impulse was to dash the cup of tea in
      Leaper's face. But he did nothing of the kind. He asked for
      a clean handkerchief; he wiped the rim of the cup and the
      spoon. He ate his buttered toast with an air of controlled
      disgust.
    </p>

    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      Between tea and dinner they left him alone. He noticed that
      the rain had ceased, and that a soft, blurred light seemed
      to be spreading over the square. The upper sash of the
      window was open for an inch or two, and he made an attempt
      to raise the lower sash, and found that he could do it. He
      closed it again. He had some paper and a pencil on his
      table, and using a book as a pad he sat and wrote a letter,
      and when he had finished it he folded up the sheet and
      slipped it into the breast-pocket of his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaper, coming in to turn on the lights, was told rather
      sharply to leave the room in darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just as you please, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      He closed the door with a suave carefulness, and Mr. St.
      George lay back on his cushions, and watched the square
      hang out its network of lights. If life had a new mystery
      this London night might have as many meanings for him as
      there were lighted windows in Cardigan Square. Taxis came
      round-eyed out of the darkness to disappear into the
      darkness. He realized that he was afraid of his mother,
      more afraid of her than he had been as a child. He was so
      very conscious of his helpless legs. He was a prisoner, but
      a prisoner trembling at the thought of a possible escape,
      and his manhood clamoured for freedom. He had let himself
      become something less than a man, and the coming of Kitty
      had made him both glad and ashamed. He had been deeply
      moved. His excitement--holding itself rigid and silent--was
      asking for action. He even thought of trying to drag
      himself out of the room and down the stairs, and out into
      the square. And how damnably absurd it all seemed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was waiting for a clock to strike the half-hour. He
      leaned over and placed his face close to the window, and
      though the square was none too well lit he felt sure that
      he could distinguish a figure waiting over there by the
      railings. A dish of fruit stood on the table, for he was
      fond of fruit, and liked to have it by him. He chose an
      orange. He took the letter from his pocket, wrapped it
      round the orange and tied up the whole in his handkerchief.
      Then he raised the lower sash of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The figure over there detached itself from the railings. A
      taxi passed, and when it had disappeared round the square
      Alex jerked the orange out into the night. He heard it fall
      with a soft thud. Holding to the window-ledge he drew
      himself as close as possible to the window and was able to
      see a woman's figure dart across the road and stoop to pick
      up something. He heard a soft whistle.

      Kitty carried her treasure round the square to a street
      lamp on the farther side of it. She unfastened the
      handkerchief, and unwrapping the sheet of paper, pushed
      orange and handkerchief into the pocket of her raincoat.
      The orange had been split by the fall, and had exuded some
      juice on to the sheet of paper. Taking out her husband's
      handkerchief, she dabbed it carefully. She smoothed out the
      creases. She found that she was able to read his letter.
    </p> 
    <blockquote>
      "Kitty--dearest--I must speak to you. I can't write all
      that I have to say. I think I know everything now. Bless
      you for coming. I've felt horrible and glorious. I must
      speak to you, get to you--somehow. I'm no better than a
      prisoner here. But they take me out in the car now. The day
      after to-morrow I'll ask them to drive me down to Ockham on
      the Guildford road. Do you happen to know the 'Swan' at
      Ockham? It stands all alone by a big pool. I'll get them to
      stop there. I'll send the men in for their tea, and have
      mine brought out to me. If you could manage to be there--O,
      my dear, do try. I've been a weak, sick beast all these
      months--"
    </blockquote> 
    <p>
      She looked up at the lamp, and then she pressed her cheek
      against the cold iron of the pillar. She felt just a little
      faint. Her chance had come.

      During the thirty-six hours that followed, Alex built and
      filled for himself a little Chamber of Horrors in which
      each figure was a fear. He had chosen a particular day,
      because he happened to know that Aunt Ermentrude was in
      town and that his mother was lunching with her; but at the
      last moment his mother might decide to drive with him. He
      was afraid of the car breaking down, of Kitty being unable
      to come, or of her missing the rendezvous. He spent his
      time and his temperament in chasing straws. At Ockham,
      Leaper and the chauffeur might fail to give him his
      opportunity. He might consider the bribing of Leaper--but
      what had he to bribe him with? Moreover, he so loathed the
      man that he detested the idea of compounding with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day of the drive his blind rose on a sunny morning.
      He was both glad and afraid. His mother might be tempted by
      the fine weather. She might give orders for the car to pick
      her up after lunch at Aunt Ermentrude's hotel, and assume
      her place beside him as though she was taking part in a
      procession. Her glances treated the features of a landscape
      as though its face was the face of a vast and anonymous
      proletarian crowd. She might remain beside him at Ockham
      while tea was carried out to the car. The anti-climax would
      be too maddening.
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed a morning of abominable restlessness, and in
      assuming a casual apathy. Had he dared to, he would have
      fussed about his clothes, and his hair, and the particular
      tie that Leaper was to select for him. His appetite for
      life had become suddenly fierce and voracious.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been starved. At a quarter to one Mrs. St. George
      was driven off in the car. Supposing she kept it? His
      luncheon-tray arrived and he made one or two casual remarks
      to Leaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll leave about two."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather early, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes--but I want to go through Richmond Park. We'll have
      tea at Ockham."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had no appetite for lunch. He finicked with it, being
      worried to death by his mother's taking of the car. He felt
      cut off, marooned. He watched the square, and when at last
      he saw the big blue car gliding round the curve of the
      gardens, and the chauffeur putting out a hand to indicate
      to other traffic that he was about to pull over to the off
      kerb, Alex felt hot and weak. His heart was thumping. The
      car was there. But had his mother given Sandys any orders?
      He dared not ask. He was still in doubt about it when the
      two men carried him downstairs, and lifted him into the
      car. He asked Sandys a jocular question, a perfectly
      foolish question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't mind stretcher-cases, Sandys?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hope you won't be that always, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suppose I ought to have a nurse in the empty seat?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Might do better, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was closed, and as it closed Alex felt a little
      jar of relief and exultation. His mother was not coming,
      and he sang out to Sandys:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take me through Richmond Park."
    </p>
    <p>
      The chauffeur raised an acknowledging hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Oxford Street it seemed to Alex that the noise of the
      traffic sounded a triumphant note. The engine drummed. No
      doubt he would have found the pandemonium of Paris, and the
      devastating discords of Rome, splendidly stimulating after
      the muffled monotony of that overheated room, for his
      mother was a chilly mortal, and even when coal was rationed
      she liked her fire half up the chimney. He asked for noise,
      movement, the clash of cymbals, youth and its jazz band.
      They went down Park Lane. At Buckingham Gate the
      interweavings of the traffic, the red buses, the dark
      taxis, the coloured cars, filled him with wide-eyed
      delight. He glanced sideways at a policeman on point duty
      and loved him. Knightsbridge was a flowing river. He looked
      at the shops and was thrilled, especially by those windows
      that were full of feminine provocations.
    </p>
    <p>
      For he was going to see Kitty, to speak with Kitty, to
      touch Kitty. He was absorbed in the contemplation of Kitty
      as a woman, as a creature live and warm with lips and
      hands. He was approaching her as a lover, and in the
      sensuous mood of a man home on leave. He did not think of
      Kitty as a contriving, planning, purposeful intelligence,
      as a personality separate and individual, as a little Joan
      of France solidly upon the earth. To him she was just
      Kitty, woman to his man, soft flesh to be touched and
      worshipped. She was a bright object, fruit, flowers. Kitty,
      the wife, and her preoccupations and proposings were
      unforeseen. It was an April day, and he thought of her
      mouth and its kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, they drove him through Richmond Park, a fragment of old
      England where trees still gather green spaces about them,
      and man and deer may drink of other things, even of
      solitude. He made them pull up for five minutes, and Leaper
      got out and lit a cigarette, and looked about him with the
      disapproving air of the man who sleeps with his window
      shut, for to the Leapers solitude is a kind of sin. He came
      and stood beside Mr. St. George.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Feeling comfortable, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite."
    </p>
    <p>
      The perfunctory question having been asked and answered,
      Leaper stood regarding the green spaces, and made a
      pointing movement with the stump of a cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There ought to be 'ouses here. Waste of a good building
      site. Nice place for a garden city."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. St. George seemed lost in a long stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think we'll be getting on."
    </p>
    <p>
      With Kingston and Surbiton behind them they ran along the
      black stretch of the Portsmouth road, through Esher to
      Cobham, with the April sunlight hanging in the darkness of
      the pine-trees. They came to Wisley with its rusty heather
      and dead bracken and its Scotch firs. The sky was full of
      freedom and the drifting of clouds, but Alex was looking at
      neither the clouds nor the trees. He watched the road. It
      rose, descended again very gradually, swept past the
      opening of a by-road, and curving, showed water glimmering
      beyond the dark trunks of the trees. The opening curve
      uncovered the redness of the Swan Hotel, with an open space
      between it and the pool, and half a dozen cars standing
      there. They pulled up outside the "Swan," Sandys backing
      the car off the road till the tail lamp was within a yard
      of a hedge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alex, all eyes, was looking for Kitty, a little figure half
      hidden somewhere on the edge of the water or among the
      trees. He scrutinized the cars. They were empty. Two or
      three chauffeurs were gossiping by the hotel doorway. A
      dusty-looking Ford van stood a little apart, its
      driver--wearing an old army greatcoat--leaning vacantly
      over the wheel. There was no sign of Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaper came to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tea, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, bring me some out on a tray."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You and Sandys can go in and get tea in the hotel. Here's
      a ten-shilling note. There's no hurry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, sir. I'll have tea brought out first."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. St. George was wondering whether Leaper had detected in
      him any signs of excitement. He was trembling on his
      cushions. He was afraid, afraid that his wife had failed
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      II
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaper carried out Mr. St. George's tea, brown teapot,
      white cup and saucer, milk-jug and sugar-basin, three
      pieces of white bread and butter, and two slabs of cherry
      cake. He arranged the tray on Mr. St. George's knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Comfortable, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite. Go in and get your tea, Leaper. I shall be all
      right here for half an hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      His excitement was intense. He watched Leaper disappear
      into the hotel before he attempted to pour out his tea, and
      when he did attempt it a tremulous hand slopped the tea
      into the white saucer. The moment had arrived; he was out
      of doors, alone, and unwatched. But where was Kitty? Would
      she appear suddenly, walking calmly towards him, pretending
      to be casual and surprised? Had this April day lips and a
      heart?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet nothing happened. He began to drink his tea and to eat
      his bread and butter, feeling himself on the edge of a
      childish desolation, of a horrible anti-climax. He had not
      noticed the Ford van drawn up close under some young Scotch
      firs about twenty yards away on his left. The driver in the
      khaki overcoat was getting down into the road. He went to
      the back of the van and opened the doors. A man emerged
      like a terrier backing out of a rabbit hole, straightened
      himself, and smiled with blue eyes above a flaxen brush of
      a moustache. A girl in a black hat and a dark blue raincoat
      followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went straight to the St. George car, the two men
      remaining where they were, watching her. She opened the
      door. She took the tray from Alex's knees, and placed it on
      the running-board close to the near front wing. She looked
      at her husband; she had a face of immense seriousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've come for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was all eyes. He looked rather like a child to whom
      something surprising and wonderful was happening. He smiled
      and nodded. He said, "Kitty, we've got twenty minutes."
    </p>
    <p>
      She possessed one of his hands and held it, while she waved
      to Old George and the driver of the van.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm kidnapping you. I shan't need twenty minutes."
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes ceased to be the eyes of a child. He caught the
      spirit of adventure; he understood it, but in his own way
      and not as the woman in her understood it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, great--! What--what a jest!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him one quick stare of the eyes, a look in which
      an unasked question was unveiled, and then covered. His
      face was bright with excitement, hers white with the glow
      of her most serious endeavour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll lift you out," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men came up, and between them they lifted Mr. St.
      George out of the car. A rug, caught in the transit,
      trailed on the road, and Kitty, pulling it free, tossed it
      back into the car. She had rugs of her own. Running to the
      van she looked back to make sure that no interference was
      developing; she climbed into the van and turned to help the
      two men with her husband. There were two cushions, a rug,
      and some sacking on the floor of the van. They lifted Alex
      in heels first, and laid him on the cushions. Kitty half
      knelt and half sat beside him. The driver closed the van
      doors, started the engine, ascended to his seat, and Old
      George climbed up beside him. The van swung out from under
      the trees, swerved to the left, and disappeared with its
      characteristic Ford song in the direction of Cobham.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some fifteen minutes later Leaper strolled out, lighting a
      cigarette. He was close to the car before he noticed the
      absence of Mr. St. George, and the abandoned tea-tray
      balanced on the running-board. His lower jaw fell open with
      the cigarette adhering to the lower lip. He stared at the
      tray; he noticed that the cup was half full of tea, and
      that a slice of unfinished bread and butter remained on the
      plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good God--he's got up and walked!"
    </p>
    <p>
      An equally astonished Sandys joined him in the
      contemplation of an apparent miracle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if he has walked--where is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Two chauffeurs were craning their heads under the bonnet of
      a car, and Leaper hailed them. "Seen my young gentleman
      anywhere?"
    </p>
    <p>
      No, they had not, and that was the most astonishing part of
      the affair. No one appeared to have observed Kitty in the
      act of kidnapping her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      III
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      Crouching beside him in that narrow space she felt the van
      gathering speed, but nothing but its utmost speed would
      satisfy her. She bent across and touched Old George.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell him to drive--to drive like hell."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alex was smiling up at her. The adventure and the humour of
      it remained with him, but to Kitty it was no study in
      humour; she could not and would not see it as such. In the
      half darkness of the closed van, with a canvas screen
      dropped between her and the two men in front, she saw her
      husband as a helpless thing, how helpless she did not know.
      Moreover, though her whole consciousness enveloped him, he
      was not the Alex of Maleham. There was a strangeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      His head seemed very low on the floor, and she doubled the
      cushion under it. His face was vaguely whimsical.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You haven't kissed me, Kitty."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor had she. The recovery of him had been an affair of
      quivering nostrils and clenched hands, but now she bent
      over him and pressed her lips to his. She was serious
      enough in her kissing when she stooped to it. She gave more
      than he gave. It left them both a little breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got you," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held one of her hands. His face made her think of a
      light shining uncertainly in a wind. The gust of her had
      troubled him, ruffled his self-consciousness, for if he had
      thought of her sensuously, she had thought of him and for
      him. That was the difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are we going?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, Vernor Street?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, our home. I've made it."
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes widened, and at that moment the van swung sharply
      into a by-road where an old white lodge and an oak gate
      stood in a smother of trees. The suddenness of the turn
      overbalanced her and flung her away from him against the
      side of the van. He laughed; he drew her back, but she did
      not laugh. He seemed to question her solemnity. His eyes
      warmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nearly over then--Kitty. But what a jest! What's it, a
      cottage?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, a cottage, on the river."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And we're going there? I say, isn't this--priceless! How
      did you get it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I found it. It's just a little place. I hope--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was bending over him, and suddenly he realized that she
      was weeping. His laughing, April mood lay and stared. He
      was shocked and he was astonished. He did not understand
      her tears and their suddenness; perhaps no man would have
      understood them. But he was deeply moved. He had a feeling
      of having failed her somehow. He put up a hand and touched
      her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kitty."
    </p>
    <p>
      She seized his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--I--I hope--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear--I know I must have hurt you horribly. I haven't
      been myself. Things--But I'll try to tell you--all about
      it. A weak rotter--whimpering in a bed. I've been so--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She crouched, staring at the canvas side of the van, and he
      looked up at her like a sensitive child dismayed and
      astonished by its mother's tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't believe it, not really, not when I came to
      myself. But I was so damned helpless and miserable. I--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to catch her breath. Her face quivered like
      light lying upon leaves that are disturbed by a passing
      shadow and a little breeze. She bent over him till her
      mouth was close to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you hadn't believed, it would have been just the same.
      I want things real--I want to feel--"
    </p>
    <p>
      His arms went round her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Real--! That's a wonderful word--like you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Things can be too real."
    </p>
    <p>
      She puzzled him. Real and too real!
    </p>
    <p>
      "We've got each other. Tell me about--the little place
      you've made."
    </p>
    <p>
      But she could not speak for a moment. He had said "place"
      not "home." He did not realize her yet. She pressed her
      forehead against his cheek; she seemed in the midst of some
      strong and silent spasm. She said--"It's on the river. It
      has a garden. It's not a bad little place--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll love it. Sure to."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her spasm seemed to harden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have got to try--make a living--you know. I've worked
      it all out. I don't mind what I do. You'll try to help
      me--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He lay still. His intuitions reached out vaguely. He
      divined in her something that doubted, and a devotion that
      thrust with two passionate hands to push the doubt away.
      But what did she doubt?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kitty--I'll try to back you up. I'll--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she sat up and looked at him. It was as though she
      saw him very clearly, and all that he was and might be and
      could not be. And she was filled with a great compassion,
      and a fear.
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>

      IV
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      With the help of George Venables she put her husband to bed
      in the long room with the big window. She had prepared
      everything with such care. She had placed the bed so that
      he could see the river and the strip of garden between the
      laurel hedge and the high red-brick wall, and the trees and
      meadows beyond the river. There was a hot bottle in the
      bed. She remembered, too, his shyness and her own, and that
      he had nothing with him but the clothes he lay in, and at
      the last moment she laid a flannel night-shirt on the bed.
      She had bought the material and made two of these shirts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "George will help you to change."
    </p>
    <p>
      She left them to it, and went out into the garden where the
      setting sun was stroking the grass and the river with
      fingers of gold. It was a gentle evening, soft and warm and
      still, and the river swelled by like quicksilver, save
      where the sunlight lay yellow upon it. A thrush was singing
      on the top of the big plane-tree, and from across the river
      where the meadows were covering themselves with a pearly
      grey mist a second thrush made an echo. And Kitty stood and
      gazed, with the sunlight on her face. The buds of the fruit
      trees were swelling. Old George had been very busy in the
      garden, and tufts of polyanthus were lacing the beds with
      velvet. Daffodils were out. Soon there would be
      wallflowers, myosotis, arabis, and pansies. The grass,
      rolled, battered, and cut with a mower acquired at a sale,
      had begun to look sleek. Even the big boat-house had an
      April air, with its panels of treillage painted green, and
      its weather-boarding white.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had done so much, and yet she felt that she had done so
      little. Would he be happy here? What would he ask of life
      and of her? He was both a man and a child. Almost, she
      would have to carry him in her arms while bearing the
      burden for both of them. But if he was happy she could do
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a last look at the garden she went in. She lit the gas
      stove in the kitchen and put on the kettle. She heard Old
      George in the passage, and she called to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "George--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ma'am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you managed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was aware of his dog-like face with its kind trustful
      eyes, and she was glad of him. He had shown a gentleness
      and a delicacy that had touched her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want things. I can't leave him--just now."
    </p>
    <p>
      He understood her at once, and the things that were needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He'll be wanting a shave in the morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could you go out and buy a razor. You'll know. The shops
      won't be shut yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled and nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm used to lifting, ma'am. He's too heavy for you. I can
      come in and do it. I've done a bit of nursing."
    </p>
    <p>
      She blessed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a good man, George. I've got so much--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can always spare a minute," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sent him off with a ten-shilling note, and loitered for
      a moment in the kitchen before going down the passage to
      her husband's room. Her own hesitation surprised her. She
      had more courage than most women, but she discovered a
      sudden fear of that room now that it was empty no longer,
      but held the very heart of her enterprise. She stood in the
      passage, conscious of herself and of her undreamed-of
      vacillations. Why was she afraid? Why did she hesitate? Was
      it that she had a vague dread of being hurt in there?
    </p>
    <p>
      She made a sudden movement. She went and opened the door.
      She had a smile on her face, and she looked quickly towards
      the bed, and saw the light of the setting sun playing upon
      it. He turned himself on his side as she entered, and his
      eyes had a kind of warm eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kitty--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She closed the door. She paused there for a moment. Her
      eyes waited. She knew that she was wondering what he would
      say to her, and that the woman in her craved for certain
      words, a particular response. She had worked so hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held out a hand and repeated that cry--"Kitty."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face seemed to grow grave. She moved across the room,
      but avoiding the bed, placed herself by the window. She
      looked through it and saw all that she had planned for him
      to see, the grass, the flowers, the river, the trees. It
      was just a little dim to her. She was yearning for him to
      say a certain thing, and since he did not say it she felt
      strangely mute.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have sent George out to buy a few things. How's the
      bed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, jolly comfortable. But, Kitty, come here--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned and saw his face. It had a shine on it, a kind
      of hunger in the eyes, and for a moment she hesitated, and
      then went to him as though some clenched purpose held her
      back. She sat down on the edge of the bed. She felt his
      arms round her, drawing her down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kit--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He pulled her close and began to kiss her as he had never
      kissed her before, and to make intimate, tender murmurings.
      She felt his warm breath and the quick beating of his
      heart. She knew what his kisses and his claspings meant.
      They made her hot and they left her cold. She was aware of
      a dolorous and poignant struggle going on within her, of
      the two women in her wanting and refusing to want. She was
      both mother and wife, and more mother than wife on that
      fateful evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kit--I've got you. You darling--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him passionate kisses for a moment, realizing the
      maleness of his cry, and the male blindness of him. Yet
      ought not she to be satisfied? The struggle in her was a
      pain, a mother-pang. He seemed to be pulling her over the
      edge of her devoted self-restraint, and slowly she set out
      to free herself with a gradual and wise gentleness. She
      played with him, while asking herself if she could always
      play with him like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear. But there's such a lot to do. Kitty's got to be a
      busy young woman--"
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes had a hurt look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Must you? Just now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She made herself laugh. She patted his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--I'm all alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But haven't you got a servant?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not yet. We're two church mice at present. And,
      heavens!--I left the kettle on my gas stove! If it boils
      over--"

      She escaped, and a part of her felt in tatters. But why
      couldn't he realize--? Did not men realize--?

      She was very busy all that evening, and she made herself
      feel and seem even busier than she was, but all the things
      that she had seen herself doing so easily and with such
      sweet complacency cost her an inward effort. She was
      realizing her problem. It had uncovered itself to her in
      one flash when Alex had pulled at her like a spoilt and
      eager child clamouring for physical satisfactions. Yes--and
      yes--She might want them just as much as he did, but she
      wanted something more from him than that. She had done so
      much, and she had so much more to do; her head and her
      heart were full of contrivings, and he had not said a word
      about the home she had got together. He appeared to have
      accepted it as a child accepts a tiny house built out of a
      box of bricks. And when old George Venables returned with a
      cheap safety-razor and a shaving brush and a rubber sponge,
      she realized how utterly her husband was on her hands. He
      had no clothes save the clothes that he had come in.
      Everything would have to be provided.
    </p>
    <p>
      She squared herself to it. She was full of a deep
      compassion; even his childish maleness touched her while it
      hurt. She prepared his supper, and carried it in prettily
      on a tray with a little jug full of purple and gold
      polyanthus. She showed him gaiety, smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may be a bit of a picnic, Alex."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a little silent, vaguely uneasy, like a child who
      has been baffled. She made allowances within herself. How
      could she expect him to be the same man after all that had
      happened to him? Possibly she divined in him a pathetic
      greediness, a desire to snatch at satisfactions that had
      been out of his reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, she had to do other things for him, very intimate
      things, and she did them with a chaste and deliberate
      dignity. She had divined their necessity. It was like doing
      things for a child, but for a child who was both awkward
      and self-conscious and full of uneasy preoccupations. She
      tried to make her ministrations seem as natural as the
      bringing of his food. She made herself talk. But she was
      aware of him as another personality, of a beloved but
      short-sighted creature watching her and thinking its own
      thoughts, uneasily sensitive, sensuously alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was both shy and bold. She brought him some books, and
      placed a lighted candle on a table beside the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have to wash up."
    </p>
    <p>
      He picked up one of the books and opened it perfunctorily,
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll come back soon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll put you to bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      While washing up she felt suddenly very tired, not
      physically so, but with an overpowering, inward tiredness.
      She finished her work. She went back to her husband's room.
      He appeared to be reading. She carried a chair to the
      bedside; she was yearning for companionship, and
      understanding; she wanted him to talk, and to be able to
      talk to him as a sympathetic, intelligent mate. She did not
      want him to bear things, but she did want to feel that he
      understood them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put the book away. He caught her wrist; he pulled her
      towards him. His eyes had a tense, strained look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kitty, aren't you going to sleep with me? I
      think--I--can--manage--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt strangely shocked, overwhelmed, but she rose above
      it. She bent over him suddenly; she took his head in her
      arms. She poured herself out; she said to him things of
      intimate and sacred meaning. She tried to soothe and to
      caress, while she denied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear--not now--not yet. It isn't because--I'm cold. But
      think--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She became aware of a sensitive sullenness in him,
      something that both consented and would not consent. His
      arms grew slack. And in trying to feel what ailed him, his
      baulkings, his disappointments, and perhaps his shame, she
      held him closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--my little boy--my man--"
    </p>
    <p>
      His responses were as slack as his arms. He seemed
      immensely grieved with himself and with her. He became
      deplorably mute.
    </p>
    <p>
      She kissed him and drew away. Her lips were quivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll put this bell here. If you ring--I shall hear, I'll
      come at once--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He lay and stared at the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--I shall be all right. I shan't bother you--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She went to her bed feeling torn and weary.

      Alex St. George lay and gazed at the river slipping past
      the strip of grass between the laurel hedge and the
      red-brick wall. In the centre of this sloping lawn a round
      flower-bed wore a coronet of red and white daisies, and
      claret-coloured and yellow polyanthus. Sometimes--but not
      often--a boat passed across the strip of water that was
      visible to the man in the chair. Beyond it the vista
      broadened into the grey-green meadows and the still,
      leafless trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      At six o'clock he had heard Kitty moving overhead. His
      waking mood had not been a happy one, and his wife's
      movements had seemed to emphasize his own complete
      helplessness. Insensibly he had become accustomed to
      thinking of himself as helpless. At half-past six Kitty had
      come down the stairs and gone into the kitchen. Fifteen
      minutes later she had appeared with an early cup of tea and
      two pieces of thin bread and butter. She had bent down and
      kissed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Slept well, boy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so very well. You should not have bothered about
      this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it a bother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Something in her eyes had disconcerted him. She had
      appeared to stand aside looking at him with a gentle and
      considering aloofness, and then she had slipped away, and
      he had fallen into a strange, sulky stare. He had pitied
      himself. His April mood had passed in the night. He had
      felt himself something less than a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eight o'clock George Venables had come in to help him
      dress before lifting him from the bed to the long cane
      chair in the window. There had been very little
      conversation between them; Old George was shy and critical,
      and Alex discomfited.
    </p>
    <p>
      At half-past eight Kitty had brought him his
      breakfast--tea, toast, two rashers of bacon, a poached egg,
      butter and marmalade. She had placed the tray on his lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you manage, dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--perfectly."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had felt himself weighed down by a voiceless and
      overwhelming self-depreciation. His self-humiliation had
      become wilful. It had made him look sulky. It had desolated
      him and her. He seemed to be saying to himself--"I'm a
      useless wretch. She has to fetch and carry for me, to treat
      me like a child. I'm nothing but a nuisance. Why did I let
      her bring me here--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She had come to take his tray away. He had shown her a
      drooping lassitude; he had not said that he had enjoyed his
      breakfast. He had not enjoyed it; he had been ready to
      choke over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall have to leave you, boy, for awhile."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. That's all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      He lay and looked at the river. It moved, and he could not.
      He became conscious of the chair, that he needed another
      cushion, that he was uncomfortable within and without. It
      was not so good a chair as the one at Cardigan Square.
      Miserable beast that he was to feel it to be less
      comfortable! He grovelled in self-humiliation, and threw
      away the last shreds of his self-respect, and felt his
      stomach like a twisted knot in a bag of emptiness. He said:
      "I know what I am. That shell ought to have finished it.
      I'm not fit even to be a husband. I haven't the right to be
      a husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard Kitty coming. She had a bright, grave face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anything I can get you, Alex?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could I have another cushion?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She found another cushion, and with great gentleness placed
      it where it was needed, and her gentleness made him acutely
      and uncouthly miserable. Why should she have to do all
      this? Why should he have to ask--?
    </p>
    <p>
      And he had nothing to say to her. She went out from him
      with a bright, firm face, telling herself that this mood of
      his was a natural reaction. He had flopped, and it was part
      of her problem to rescue him from such flounderings, and to
      fill him with new interests, and a recreated self-respect.
      She realized that somehow she would have to find things for
      him to do. But how unexpected life was! She had imagined
      things happening so differently.
    </p>
    <p>
      So--she endured during that first day. She went about her
      work with a patient and determined face. She made beds,
      cleaned, cooked, consulted with Old George and a jobbing
      carpenter who were laying down the new floor in the
      boat-house. Old George's eyes seemed to watch her like the
      eyes of a dog. He knew what sickness was. That young chap
      in there wanted the corners of his mouth pulling up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty's mouth was a straight line. When her work was done
      she went in to sit with her husband. She felt all his
      soreness, the wilful accentuations of his depression, his
      poor moody self-humiliation. She tried to make him talk.
      She was saying to him in her heart--"O, my dear, don't let
      yourself go down like this. Talk to me. Let things out. You
      can say everything to me. I want you to be happy. I don't
      mind so long as you are happy--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her patience held. At five o'clock Old George came in with
      brushed coat and washed hands to lift Alex back to his bed,
      and remembering that Old George had an invalid of his own
      Kitty sent him home when he had done the lifting for her.
      But she went to the front door with Old George; he did some
      of her shopping for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you buy me two pairs of socks and a shirt?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, ma'am; I'll get 'em at Draper's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are very kind, George. It's good of you to do that
      lifting. He's so very helpless."
    </p>
    <p>
      Old George had a quaint way of looking wisely and sadly
      down his broad nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When you've got to lift things with your heart, miss, as
      well as with your hands, it comes a bit heavy."
    </p>
    <p>
      She went back to her husband and undressed him; she slipped
      the flannel nightshirt over his head and smoothed it under
      him; she did for him those various intimate things. And
      under her careful hands his lassitude seemed to increase;
      he appeared to grow more helpless and more voiceless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's going to be an awful bore for you--doing all this."
    </p>
    <p>
      That was as far as he would go.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think so?" she asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made a little laugh of it, yet--almost she could have
      smacked him for making a moan over so obvious a necessity.
      Why did he not accept the obvious, and having made the best
      of it, prepare to rise above it with a smile? Why did he
      not blurt out his soul to her, and so make the immediate
      problem easier for them both? She was very tired. To be
      cheerful for two is peculiarly exhausting, even more
      exhausting than bearing the noise of chattering fools. She
      felt the need of being alone for awhile, quite alone with
      her own human problem. She went out into the garden and
      walked up and down on the grass beside the river, with the
      same thrush singing on the same tree while a gentle dusk
      descended. She felt rather miserable. For what an
      anticlimax was this after all her sturdy waitings and
      contrivings! And yet--surely--it was only a phase? He was
      too sensitive. He gave way to things; he wilted. But she
      must refuse to let him wilt or to give way to peevish
      self-pity. She would have to make him interested, insist on
      his being interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      O, poor lad!
    </p>
    <p>
      She went in again full of pity, the pity that one feels for
      some one particular person. It filled her, and sustained
      her. She busied herself with his little dinner, for he had
      had his dinner at Cardigan Square, and he should have it
      now. She let her curiosity travel to Cardigan Square. Mrs.
      St. George! What rages, what puzzlements, what a wigging of
      servants! Telephonings here and there! Yes, she--the
      wife--had got him; she held his body, but what of the real
      him, the man, the sick and peevish child? Yes, she would
      still have to go on fighting and smiling and enduring. Such
      a battle was not won in three days.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening she went in and sat beside his bed. She had
      determined to talk to him about the cottage and their
      future, her plans, money and how they were to get it. She
      wondered if he realized that money had to be made. He had
      never lacked money, comforts, toys. He had never had to
      work, or to strike his fist against life's fundamentals.
      Work or starve! Get money, or be an underling, to be pushed
      into crowded corners.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had nothing of the socialist in her composition; she
      despised the socialist idea as her mother despised it; she
      was ready to strive for what was hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said to him: "How do you like my carpet, boy? It took
      me a month to find it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked rather vaguely at the carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jolly nice. Where did you get it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At a sale. I can tell you it was a great game, my dear,
      getting this little place furnished."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Must have been."
    </p>
    <p>
      His vagueness continued. It was the vagueness of the sick,
      and sensitive introvert with the skin of his consciousness
      turned inwards. He was full of his self-depreciations,
      wilful abasements. He persisted in feeling a worm, a dull
      and unimpressive worm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you want to hear all about it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "About--what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we have to make a living. It ought to be great fun
      making a living. Are you any good at arithmetic?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised his hands and let them fall, and the gesture
      expressed his mood. "I'm no good at anything. I shall never
      be good at anything." She looked hard at him, and smothered
      something, and, pressing her lower lip against her teeth,
      went on with her talking. She caught herself feeling like a
      schoolmistress, and talking like one, and he lay and
      listened like a listless child. Never had life seemed so
      pitiful and so provoking. Her pity had an edge of
      exasperation. He was making no effort to understand her or
      even to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said--with vehement self-restraint: "You are tired, my
      dear." And he nodded. His eyes had a wide and vacant
      expression. He seemed to be incapable of fixing his
      attention upon any subject, or of rising above the dead
      level of the day's despondency.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor old lad."
    </p>
    <p>
      She bent down and kissed him, and tears came into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll not worry you any more to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the day's mothering had left her discouraged and very
      weary, and she went to her bed very much in need of her own
      mother. She wanted to let herself go to somebody, to press
      her head against Mrs. Sarah's splendid and warm solidity.
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      II
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      And next day Mrs. Sarah came. Kitty had sent her mother a
      telegram on the morning of the second day, and Mrs. Sarah
      having looked good over it, had remained with infinite
      discretion at No. 7 Vernor Street. Vine Cottage and Alex
      were Kitty's affair, and a wise woman should be in no hurry
      to dip a spoon in her daughter's broth. Let these two young
      things possess the two first days together, and find each
      other, and sort out the recovered threads of their
      interwoven future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alex heard Mrs. Sarah enter the cottage. He heard her voice
      and Kitty's voice, and the sounds seemed to embrace and
      mingle and to flow away into the kitchen and to become
      muffled there. He lay and listened. He discovered in
      himself a little and unexplained fear of Mrs. Sarah; the
      cottage was made different by her coming into it. She had a
      boisterousness, a brevity, a hearty vigour that disturbed
      even at a distance the stagnation of his self-pity. He had
      been letting himself float in a despondency that was like
      the green slime. It is even possible that he had become to
      like it a little. It was so effortless. It responded to his
      emotions, and damped them down, and suffered the vibrations
      to die away into succulent gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah's voice stirred other vibrations. She seemed to
      be talking very hard and fast, and with a <i>gaillard,</i>
      and buoyant vehemence. She was enjoying herself; she had
      every right to enjoy herself and Kitty. Yes, she, Mrs.
      Sarah, had had a visit from Mrs. St. George.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless you--I know I may be a vulgar old woman--my dear,
      but I do enjoy life. Yes--she arrived yesterday like a
      white squall. She accused me of having Alex in the house.
      Did I know anything of Alex and his whereabouts? Of course
      not! Really, I think I treated her rather well, poppet. I
      took her all over the house. I felt like old Foch with the
      Germans at his knees. She was furious, but she kept it in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So she does not know yet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has been to the police. But what can she do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She may try to remove him by force when she finds out that
      I have Alex here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think not, my dear. That would mean housebreaking.
      Rather too large an order even for Mrs. St. George.
      Besides--the lad has a voice of his own--now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty sat down on a kitchen chair, with her elbows on the
      kitchen table. She looked out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish he had," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alex could still hear the two voices, but their notes had
      dropped to an intimate and subdued murmuring. No doubt they
      were discussing him, and what was to be done with him, and
      the burden of him. And so they were. His sensitiveness had
      too thin a skin, or rather--it picked up too many
      sensations of the same order.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he heard the opening of a door, and a sudden
      enlarging of the two voices. They sounded very cheerful.
      Obviously Mrs. Sarah was coming to see him, and he flinched
      from the imminence of her vigorous solidity. He was like an
      absurd and peevish child; he would like to have hidden
      himself under the bedclothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah came in. She was alone. She closed the door, and
      crossing to the bed, sat down sideways on the foot of it
      with an air of friendly and triumphant good humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--here we are."
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not mince matters. She assumed that her son-in-law
      found himself in the best of all possible worlds. The
      romance was still a romance. And wasn't Kitty wonderful!
    </p>
    <p>
      He had to agree, though his self-depreciation resented the
      glare of his wife's goodness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did it all herself, my dear. Even stripped the old paper
      off the walls. And here you are--launched on the adventure.
      A nice little home, and a nice little game to play at
      making a living. O, you'll do it between you! You'll back
      up your little wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt like a flat cold fish ready to scuffle away down
      into the mud away from the glow of Mrs. Sarah's enthusiasm.
      What an abominably cheerful woman it was! And he was
      realizing himself to be a mere parasite, a sucking thing,
      dependent upon his wife for every sort of humiliating
      little ministration. Where was the triumph?
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt himself sinking through the bed when Mrs. Sarah got
      up from it, and returned to her daughter and her daughter's
      affairs. He heard the women's voices mingle again. They
      appeared to drift out into the garden and into the illusion
      of light that an April day provided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah was speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have taken the measurement of the passage and
      doorways? I'll get it--straight away--and order it to be
      sent down. Yes, have a doctor in, a young one, one who's
      not too soft. What, my dear? A good smacking. Take it
      early. It's kinder in the end. It might do him all the good
      in the world, poor lad."

    </p>
    <p>
      There were three doctors practising in and about Shelford,
      and Dr. Drake was George Venables' recommendation. Old
      George had no very great faith in the medical profession,
      but Dr. Drake had been to the war and was home again, and
      was supposed to be clever with his hands. So Kitty sent for
      Dr. Drake, and he came in a small grey car, a short,
      thick-set, bright-eyed man with a face that was both droll
      and imperturbable. He had a smile; he was laconic; and he
      could keep still. He sat in Kitty's parlour, and listened
      to all that she had to say, and asked her a few pointed
      questions. He inspired her with her confidence from the
      very first, and she showed him a good sense by giving him
      her confidence in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, let's have a look at him. Do you mind if I see him
      alone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I leave it to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at Alex very thoroughly. He sat on the edge of
      the bed and talked and observed his patient. He had
      retained the abrupt and realistic outlook of the war, and
      he was one of those men who might retain it to the end of
      his days, and remain on the crest of youth's wave. Nothing
      but the real would satisfy him, that and the search for it.
      He looked straight ahead. He belonged to a generation that
      refused to be impressed by long words, or by parental
      shibboleths or the wisdom of the ancients. He had a sort of
      whimsical, kind ruthlessness. To him life was like a
      relay-race: you snatched the baton from the failing hand of
      the past, and sped ahead without looking back till some
      other racer took the baton front you. What did that matter!
      Speed, the getting there, were the things that mattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was instantly interested in Alex. Here was a case, a
      young machine out of gear, a double disharmony, physical
      and mental. So, when his examination was over, he sat on
      Alex's bed and talked to him with a whimsical cheeriness
      that was as subtle as the trained hand of the surgeon. He
      watched Alex's eyes and his mouth, and his movements, or
      his lack of movement. He refrained from being too
      aggressively inquisitive--at least--to begin with. He had
      learnt to know his types, and to generalize about them, and
      at the same time he was alive to the falseness of easy
      generalizations. Man and his consciousness appear so
      incoherent now that the doubting Edwardians have followed
      the comfortably earnest Victorians into their coffins.
      We--of the new age sometimes wish to be in earnest, but
      about what? Drake had found nothing to be in earnest about
      save his job. You left the New Paganism and the New
      Psychism to the talkers. Even with a new eruption of the
      barbarians--of the mechanical mob--you would still hope for
      your super-scientist, a new Messiah with a light-ray or a
      death-ray, who, by pressing a button in his laboratory,
      could efface all mobs and mobbishness. Drake talked to Alex
      as he had talked to young officers during the war. It was
      the voice of the M.O.--man addressing man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my lad, what are you going to do to amuse yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a question that Alex found difficult to answer. Here
      was another visitor who was as cheerful as Mrs. Sarah, but
      cheerful with a difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know, doc. I'm so jolly helpless."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you will be, my lad, if you let yourself feel like
      that. You'll get a fatty head and a fatty heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alex's eyelids flickered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm nothing but a sort of parasite."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rot, my lad. We shall have to find you something to do,
      even if it is nothing but peeling potatoes."
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave Alex's shoulder a grip, looking down at him with
      kind ruthlessness, and went out to speak with Kitty. He
      found her in the kitchen making cakes, and he sat down on a
      kitchen chair, and told her to go on with her cake-making.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have had a thorough look at your husband, Mrs. St.
      George. I should like to watch him for a time. These cases
      can be rather complicated. He's apt to get depressed about
      himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at the solid and imperturbable face across the
      table. Dr. Drake's skin had a dustiness. He had very little
      facial expression, but when you met his wary, grey-black
      eyes you felt the man's vitality coiled like a spring
      behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very depressed. I'm worried about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite right. He must not be allowed to feel like that.
      It's insidious; it's like a drug habit. We must get him out
      of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He observed her, and she observed him in return. A little
      smile seemed to pass between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mustn't be--too--easy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly. Rouse him. Get his self-respect kicking. Try and
      find him something to do, something that will make him feel
      that he is being of use."
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll try. We are not very well off, doctor. I shall have
      to make a living here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't worry about my fees. You'll manage. What are you
      going to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give teas and dances. My idea is to get hold of the river
      people. I've worked it all out."
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled with his eyes, and getting up, looked at her with
      shrewd kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excellent idea. Fine exercise--dancing. I'll prescribe it
      for some of my patients and send them on to you.--By the
      way--rub his legs well twice a day, and be careful about
      his skin. But don't dwell too much on those legs of his;
      you understand? I'll drop in again in two or three days'
      time."

    <p>
      Kitty heard the wind in the trees, and the uneasy lapping
      of the river. She had come out by the passage door into the
      garden, locking the door after her and taking the key, and
      as though moved by the wind and an impulse of her own she
      went round to the window of her husband's room. April,
      turned tempestuous, buffeted the laurel hedge behind her.
      In the greyness of the dusk the river had a look of haste,
      and the western sky was pale primrose, and against this
      paleness blue-black clouds smudged themselves. The big
      plane-tree sang a song of its own. In the flower-beds the
      wallflowers bent to the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked in at the window. She had lit a candle for him,
      and left him cigarettes and a book on the table beside the
      bed. She had said--"I must rush down the village. That
      idiot Fuller forgot to send the tea." She had seen a
      whimpering resignation in his eyes. What need was there for
      her to tell him where she was going and why?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, the candle was burning and he was reading the book she
      had left him. She saw eight white fingers outlined against
      the dark cover. The colours of the room were dim but
      recognizable, the red walls, the white paint, the
      biscuit-coloured carpet, the apple-green bedspread, and yet
      the room impressed her as a fabric that had faded. It had
      been so vivid to her on the day of his coming, and now it
      seemed blurred, covered with a dusty sadness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She slipped away. She was conscious of a sudden passionate
      rage against life, a clenching of her fists, a setting of
      her chin. Something would have to be done. She could not
      allow him to go on behaving like a moody and hysterical
      child; he would have to be shaken out of his humours. Her
      fingers touched the latch of the door that opened from the
      garden into the lane. She opened the door, closed it with
      vehement self-restraint and stood for the moment holding
      the iron handle. She was aware of the fresh green surface
      of the door dimmed to blackness by the dusk. The wind
      rushed over the river and made a roaring in the elms and
      the chestnuts, a potent and a vigorous wind, and it stirred
      a response in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hurried up Shelford Lane, keeping to the middle of the
      road. Windows were being lit up. She saw a big coarse, red
      hand drawing down a blind. A few children came scuffling
      and screaming under the pollarded limes, and one of them--a
      little oafish boy--blundered against her. She thrust him
      off--and with such impatience that he lurched against a
      tree and remained there for a moment mute and astonished.
      Yes, life was boiling up in her, a rage against
      childishness. By the church a man was turning the handle of
      a car that refused to start, and she observed the resentful
      jerks of his hunched shoulders. A thing that refused to
      start! The windows of the Ship Inn were like yellow eyes
      blinking in the wind. It looked a frowsy place, like a
      slovenly woman in a hurry. Sounds came from it, voices, a
      silly laugh given with a mouth wide open and a head lolling
      back. She went on to the grocer's. She found the window
      blinds being lowered. Her words were as curt as her entry.
      The man who served her with a take it or leave it face,
      that had not yet recovered from the war, was made to feel
      the gustiness of her impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hurried back. The lane was both darker and more patched
      with light. The wind made a roaring in the trees; a star
      shone here and there between the racing clouds. She had
      reached the door in the wall when she noticed a figure
      leaning against the white shutters of the Vine Cottage
      shop. She was suspicious. She walked on. The figure that
      had propped itself against her shutters remained attached
      to them with a loutish casualness. She looked at it
      carefully and with a deliberation that should have made it
      uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The figure spat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got a girl, miss, thanks."
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw her eyes in the dusk, very round and gleaming. Yes,
      men were abnormally precious in these days, and even a
      Surrey lout had a rude quip ready, and a sense of his
      sexual importance. He had nothing to do but to lean against
      a wall and wait for the female to come to him. She turned
      and walked back to the garden door. Yes, life was boiling
      up in her. She had wondered whether that loafing figure had
      had any significant connection with Cardigan Square, for
      she knew that her days of concealment must come to an end.
      And she was conscious of a feeling of exasperation. Some
      day--no doubt--his mother would arrive, and
      she--Kitty--would have nothing to show her but a figure of
      a failure, a whimpering child who refused to be happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened the door, and in closing it the latch pinched
      one of her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damn!" she said; "yes--damn!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was the daughter of Mrs. Sarah, and her reactions had a
      like vitality and vigour. She locked the door, and passed
      round the cottage to realize that the long window was in
      darkness. What did it mean? He had blown out the candle. He
      was lying there in the darkness, adding it to his self-made
      gloom, wrapping himself in it. Her anger was at her lips.
      She felt that she must rouse him out of this lassitude
      before the intervention of his mother. She must be able to
      show the other woman--
    </p>
    <p>
      She passed on. She let herself in and relocked the door;
      she turned on the kitchen lights; she tossed her packet of
      tea on to the table. She took off her hat and her raincoat.
      Now for it! She was quivering. She went down the passage to
      his room and opened the door, and saw the window dimly
      grey. In the bed there was a movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, all in the dark?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice came dully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't turn on the light, Kitty. I have something to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't stay here, Kitty."
    </p>
    <p>
      She moved a little way into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's too--too shameful. I can't let you scrub and scrape
      for me, wear yourself out. It's nothing but drudgery--I'd
      rather--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She went quietly to the window and stood looking out at the
      dim garden and the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would rather go back to Cardigan Square?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would make it easier for you, Kitty."

    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      Her silence was like a bubble blown from a pipe. It
      swelled, it floated into the air, and then it burst.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned on him. She went quickly to the foot of the bed,
      and putting her two hands to the iron bar of the frame, she
      let the muscles of her arms and chest strain against it.
      She said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, go back. I've done everything that could be
      done. I have worked for weeks getting this little home
      ready. I have tried to think of everything. But you have no
      pluck--"
    </p>
    <p>
      The tension of her arms made the bed quiver, conveying to
      it the vibrations of her little body's anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You just lie there and grouse. You haven't made an effort
      to help me or to help yourself. I shouldn't mind the work
      and the worry. After all--one's got to work, and worries
      are like the poor--I waited for you. I waited for you when
      you didn't believe in me. I went on believing. I thought
      you would have the courage to make the best of the best I
      could give you. For--I have given you my best--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was voiceless. She could see his dim face looking up at
      her with its wide and sensitive eyes. She felt them to be
      frightened eyes, but she went on striking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had better go back. I can't help you if you won't try
      to help yourself. What's the use? I brought you here
      because I wanted you to be happy--and I wanted to be happy,
      too. We might have been. I'll write to your mother
      to-morrow. She can send her car--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave the bed a shake, though she was not conscious of
      doing it, and going quickly to the door, she got herself
      out of the room, and closed the door after her. She leant
      against it. Her anger had passed like the wind, leaving her
      strangely exhausted. She felt that she could sink to the
      floor, but she would not let herself sink; she stiffened
      her knees; she listened. In the room there was absolute
      silence, a shocked, bewildered silence. It made her yearn
      and it made her despair, but she smothered her yearnings,
      gave her head a shake, and walked down the passage into the
      kitchen. She found herself staring at the packet of tea.
      She seized it, ripped it open, clutched the red canister
      from the shelf and emptied the tea into it. She lit the gas
      stove. She filled the kettle at the sink, turning the tap
      full on, and letting the water splash over. What did it
      matter? She could have taken all the crockery from the
      shelves and smashed it with a wild and delicious violence.
      But suddenly she held herself in. She wiped the kettle with
      an old dishcloth, and placed it on the stove, and saw that
      the gas was burning neither too high nor too low. She was
      saying things to herself--"Hold tight. Don't be hysterical.
      It all depends on you." And with a deliberate calmness she
      set about preparing her husband's dinner, collecting her
      plates and dishes, a tin of sardines, bread, butter, a
      bottle of preserved fruit; custard powder, the little
      saucepan containing his coffee. She grew calm, inexorable--
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly she heard the tinkling of his handbell. The
      sound came out of the dark silence appealingly. She stood
      still. She compelled herself to ignore it; she went on with
      her work.

    <p>
      Twenty minutes passed, and Kitty was whipping up some
      custard in a little white basin when she heard him calling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kitty--Kitty--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused. She remained very still for some moments in
      that brightly lit little kitchen; she looked at the clock
      on the mantelpiece; she drew a deep breath and went on with
      the whipping of the custard. But she was all ears, quick
      with suspense and with her wonderings as to the virtue of
      her castigations. How much of a man was he? Would he accept
      her silence, or had she roused in him a spirit that could
      be remorseful and urgent and proud?
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she heard him calling--"Kitty--Kitty," and the appeal
      in his voice could not be questioned. She went and washed
      her hands at the sink and dried them on the roller towel
      behind the door, and a sudden exultation tingled in her,
      even to her finger-tips. She remembered to turn off the tap
      of the gas stove. She walked slowly down the passage and
      opened his door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you call?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was in darkness, and out of the darkness his voice
      seemed to grope towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kitty--what a beast I've been--"
    </p>
    <p>
      That cry of his seemed to be in her own body. She was with
      him instantly, bending over him in the darkness,
      passionate, triumphant, yet celebrating no selfish victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--my dear--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He had found one of her hands and was kissing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to go back--Don't send me away. I know now.
      I've been such an utter rotter. I want to talk. Hold my
      head, hold my head like you used to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      She lay beside him on the bed, and held his head in her
      arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say everything--I shall understand--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt his face against her bosom, and his voice came
      muffled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was so ashamed--but--I suppose--it was weak of me. I
      know now--if you will let me stay--I'll never be like that
      again. I promise. I've been through hell, and come through
      on the right side. I want to help. Can't I help--somehow--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She put her lips to his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course--lots of things. But smiling and being happy
      helps most. Don't you see--A woman doesn't mind work--when
      she's happy and someone else is happy. Why, just think.
      This is our own little show, out very own little show, boy.
      It's like playing a great game. It's going to be so
      exciting--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He held her close.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kitty, you're a great little woman. I won't let you down
      again. I promise--O--I'm happy--happy. Something has
      happened inside me. I was so shocked, so scared--I'll begin
      now--and to-morrow--I'll--There must be lots of things--If
      I could get about a bit--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She said: "You shall. There is one of those wheeled chairs
      coming. You will be able to trundle yourself about."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--great! But I want to hear about things. Tell me about
      things, everything--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She pressed his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's your dinner--I must get it ready. But after
      dinner--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt him make a happy stirring in her arms. Then he lay
      still; he was looking at the dim window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kitty, some things one can't help, but there are things
      one can. Grousing's cowardly. I'll keep smiling--"

    </p>
    <p>
      After a dinner which she shared with him, bringing up a
      little table and sitting beside his bed, they passed what
      was perhaps the happiest evening of their lives. She had
      drawn the curtains across the window and turned on a shaded
      light above the bed. The melancholy candle was discarded.
      She sat beside him, leaning against the pillows, with a
      writing pad on her knees. She was going to draw plans and
      pictures for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to look at the room, our room."
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised himself in bed; he looked about him with a
      sensitive, smiling eagerness, and with a new life in his
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't it--pretty. It's the prettiest room--I like the
      shape. And then--that window--and the river."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's why I took the cottage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you? By God--dear--I'll try and deserve it."
    </p>
    <p>
      With his head against her shoulder she made play with a
      stumpy pencil, drawing plans on the writing pad. They
      chattered like two children, and with tongue and pencil she
      described the cottage and the garden. "Here's the lawn
      where we can serve teas. And here's the boat-house. We have
      let in more light by cutting out panels in the walls, and
      fixing trellis or curtains. The floor is half finished; it
      measures forty feet by twenty. I thought of having a big
      gramophone with a large trumpet."
    </p>
    <p>
      He exclaimed with sudden excitement--"I say, I've had banjo
      lessons. I can vamp quite well, and I've a sense of time. I
      can be the band, a drum and a pair of cymbals, and a bit of
      banjo thrown in to help the gramophone."
    </p>
    <p>
      She hugged him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Splendid! Of course you can. Old George is going to look
      after the boats, and I shall have a girl in to help with
      the teas. Now--I wonder what we shall make--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She began to scribble figures, and he watched the jottings
      of her pencil.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought of charging 1s. for tea alone, 2s. 6d. for tea
      and dancing. A good tea will cost me somewhere about 8d.
      That would leave a profit of 1s. 10d. on each dance tea. We
      shall have to get a licence, and there will be the tax. Of
      course--if the thing goes well--we might put up the price."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he too desired a pencil and a piece of paper, and
      they scribbled in chorus, and chattered, and conceived
      sudden inspirations.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say twenty couples every Saturday and Sunday, Kit. Twenty
      couples at 3s. 6d. profit per couple, a hundred and forty
      shillings, seven pounds each week-end. But how many
      week-ends?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Allow twenty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's £40 a year."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared gravely at the sum figured on paper. It was not
      very impressive. She took up the chant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but there will be the odd teas on ordinary days. And
      we may get parties. Call it £200. And if I open the shop--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much can we live on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must try and do it on £300 including wages. I have a
      little money of my own; my 'Cobbold' shares have doubled. I
      had £300 in them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Jove," said he, "what an ass I am! Of course I've some
      money lying at Cox's. And then there will be my gratuity. I
      wonder if it is too late to do anything about a disability
      pension? But I must have two or three hundred lying at
      Cox's, not counting my gratuity--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear boy--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll write to them to-morrow. I can bring the money into
      our show. We must pay your mother--she's been a brick."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, mother's not worrying."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had another inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say, I could keep the accounts, couldn't I? I'll be
      bandmaster and book-keeper, and all sorts of things. Great!
      If only I can be of some use--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was happy. And when she went to her little room and
      drew back the curtains and opened the window, she saw that
      the sky had cleared, and that the stars were showing. She
      leaned out into the night. She heard the wind in the trees,
      and saw the ruffled river dimly swelling by. The night
      smelt sweet. O, happy moments, and quiet breathing! She
      knew that she need not fear his mother, nor perhaps--any
      woman.

      To Alex St. George the window of his room suddenly enlarged
      itself. There seemed more of the sky to be seen, more of
      the river and of the meadows and trees beyond it, more of
      the life of the birds busy with the year's increase. The
      old red wall sunned itself. The wallflowers in the round
      bed in the centre of the strip of grass were unfolding from
      the swelling green of their buds petals of maroon and of
      yellow. For we carry our own world about with us, and as
      Alex's consciousness enlarged itself and caught the
      sensitive urge of the spring, so did the window grow more
      wonderful. He felt that he had a heart, muscles, hands. He
      was a young bird on a bough.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Old George, coming in to lift him from bed to chair, he
      showed a face of acceptance and of freshness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say, when I get my wheeled chair, George, do you think
      that there is anything I could find to do down at the
      boat-house?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A smile slipped from Old George's blue eyes and seemed to
      trickle down his broad nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure of finding something, sir, if you look for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wholesome fellow--George, and happy with his hands. He went
      out caressing his big blond moustache, considering the
      things that might be accomplished by a man who had lost the
      use of his legs. Yes, there were things that Mr. Alex could
      do, but would it not be more exciting for Mr. Alex to
      discover them for himself? Surely! A child should be
      encouraged to make or find its own toys. The little
      plutocrats of the nursery--sallow stuff! The tappings of
      Mr. Venables' hammer resounded under the hollow roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      By some happy coincidence the wheeled chair arrived in a
      crate that very morning. Kitty had it carried to the grass
      under her husband's window, and she unpacked it there after
      Old George had knocked out the side of the crate. There was
      a mass of paper and string and straw bands, and as she
      worked, with Alex watching her, she thought of this chair
      as a chariot of victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going to try it."
    </p>
    <p>
      She pushed her honey-coloured bobbed head through the open
      window, and her eyes were mischievous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right. And--afterwards--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She got into the chair and trundled herself along the path,
      and then took a turn over the grass, encircling the flower
      bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's quite easy."
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes were bright and eager.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me try. Put me into it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The side door opening out upon the bricked path was wide
      enough to admit the chair, and Kitty, having wiped the
      wheels with a duster, pushed the chair in. Old George was
      stuffing straw and paper back into the crate. He went in to
      help. They inserted Alex into his overcoat, placed him in
      the wheeled chair, and stood regarding him like a couple of
      pleased parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about a cushion?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He had an intent, purposeful look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, it's jolly comfortable. But won't the wheels be rather
      hard on the carpet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, never mind the carpet."
    </p>
    <p>
      She went out, giving Old George a beckoning look with her
      eyes, and he, following her, rubbed a thoughtful nose.
      Outside she whispered, and received a smiling, sidelong
      stare, for Old George understood. He returned to his
      boat-house, and she to her kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Alex's face had taken on the intent expression
      of a child interested in some new problem. Very carefully
      he moved himself about the long room, avoiding the
      furniture, and trying such simple experiments as bringing
      himself alongside the table or bed. He tried going forwards
      and backwards, turning, stopping at a particular spot. He
      was a little flushed. And presently the open door giving on
      to the brick path inevitably offered itself and the
      adventure of the wider world beyond. He eyed it, measured
      it. He trundled himself towards it. There would not be much
      space to spare between the wheels and the doorposts.
      Moreover the doorway had a raised ledge or sill, and at the
      first attempt--not hitting the sill squarely with both
      wheels--the chair swerved and jammed itself between the
      posts. He backed out and tried again, and again got himself
      pinched in the doorway. But at the third attempt, with his
      hands working hard at the wheels, he propelled the chair
      over the sill, and found himself on the brick path.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was breathing hard; his face had a flush of triumph. He
      had accomplished something.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good business! I'm outside."
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt that he had a sky over his head that he could
      regard as his own, and an earth that was new and yet his.
      And the sun was shining, and he let himself rest there for
      a minute in the sunlight, before going on his voyage of
      exploration. He trundled himself down beside the laurel
      hedge, found the opening in it, and appeared in the garden,
      seeing it for the first time with an intimate realization
      of its personal meaning, a green and flowery way between
      the faded redness of the old cottage and the stately glide
      of the river. He looked up at the great plane tree; he bent
      down and touched the grass with his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife was on the watch. She saw him coming along the
      lower path, his figure darkened by having the sunlit
      surface of the river for a background. He was leaning
      forward in the chair, moving himself rather slowly, but
      with a suggestion of purposeful haste. He seemed to be
      pressing forward into new country, youth chained but eager.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned the chair abruptly and faced the cottage. He
      called out to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kitty, where are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She showed herself at the window, and he waved.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm out."
    </p>
    <p>
      His pride was as obvious as a child's, and his showing off
      before her had pathos and naïveté. Here was the old,
      lovable Alex.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come out, Kitty. Let's go round."
    </p>
    <p>
      She came out to him, and her movements seemed to have a
      happy gliding smoothness. She did not touch the chair, but
      left him to his own devices and the zest of his own
      endeavour. But she praised him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can manage it--already."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--I'll manage all sorts of things--I want to see the
      boat-house; I want to see everything. Come along. But don't
      help me; I want to feel responsible."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had no intention of helping him unless he could not
      help himself, but she walked beside the chair between it
      and the river, like a young mother accompanying a child
      that is learning to toddle. Her impulse was to say--"Be
      careful of the river," but she did not say it; she was
      careful not to fuss his striving and renascent manhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This way."
    </p>
    <p>
      Between the Vine Cottage garden and the boat-house, where
      an opening had been cut in the fence, Old George had made a
      temporary path of half-bricks and cinders. There were two
      yards or so of soft and boggy bumpiness, and Alex's chair
      showed a disinclination to advance. Kitty watched him fight
      his way through, straining like a determined child to
      attain its object. He got through that soft patch, and she
      wanted to bend down and kiss him.

    </p>
    <p>
      Having cast his eyes over their Canaan, and pushed his
      chair as far as the great chestnut trees beyond the black
      shed, he turned back and came to rest outside the
      boat-house where Old George and the jobbing carpenter were
      at work. Kitty left him there, for she had cooking to do,
      and he sat and watched the jobbing man clamping floor
      boards together before nailing them to the joists. Old
      George had half a dozen boards laid across three short
      pieces of timber and was smearing some brown stuff on them
      with a long-handled brush.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alex watched him with the air of a child in a perambulator
      watching some other child actively and satisfyingly busy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say--George--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that stuff?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Creosote, sir. Giving the under sides of the boards a
      dressing before we nail 'em down."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Couldn't I do that? If the boards were laid out here--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't see why you shouldn't, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact there was no reason why Mr. St. George should not
      swab creosote over the timber provided that the ground was
      prepared for him, and somebody exercised a little
      ingenuity. Old George, choosing a spot where the ground was
      fairly flat, arranged four twelve foot boards side by side,
      and poured out a supply of creosote into a tin with a wire
      handle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I put the tin on the boards, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can lift it with the brush--and move it along as I
      work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can."
    </p>
    <p>
      Old George returned to the particular job upon which he had
      been engaged before he had taken up the tar brush--the
      manufacture of a number of solid, garden tables, but he
      kept an interested watch upon Alex. Mr. St. George had the
      tar brush across his knees, the wet end of it projecting
      well away and clear of the chair. He manoeuvred himself
      into position at the end where Old George had placed the
      tin of creosote, and having got himself just where he
      wanted tobe, he began methodically to brush on the brown
      stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Work it well in, sir," said Mr. Venables.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had covered as much of the timber as he could
      reach, he slipped the end of the brush under the wire
      handle and moved the tin, laid the brush handle across his
      knees, and transferred himself and the chair to a new
      position. His new move took him too far, and he could not
      reach the tin with the brush, and had to reverse and
      readjust matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better have an old sack over your knees, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right-o--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Old George noticed that Alex made no more mistakes in
      altering the position of his chair. Now and again he would
      pause and look at the boat-house or dancing pavilion with
      an air of wonder and satisfaction. "Just"--as Old George
      put it to himself--"as though he were a kid and wanted to
      lick the new paint off it." For, certainly, Kitty's
      dance-house had begun to possess a bright green and white
      glamour, with the black roof over-hanging it sufficiently
      at the eaves to give a shadow-band, and the new white floor
      showing through the squares of the panels of green
      treillage. And Alex was thinking--"If I were Kitty--I'd
      have purple curtains. That would make a good colour scheme,
      white, green and purple. And the garden umbrellas ought to
      be yellow." Meanwhile he had finished creosoting the first
      lot of floor-boards, and like a hungry bird was calling for
      more. Old George supplied him. But the child was full of
      questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say, when it rains and blows--won't the dancing floor
      get wet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, we've got shutters to bolt over the panels."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see. What's that you're making, George?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A garden table. She wants a dozen to dot about the place.
      I've made three. The next job will be to paint 'em."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Couldn't I do that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't see why you shouldn't, sir. Two good coats over an
      undercoat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What colour?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "White tops and green legs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is painting difficult, George?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not when you've got the hang of it, sir, and have learnt
      to be a bit bold with your brush. Most amateurs start as
      though the brush were going to bite 'em. They finnick about
      with it, and try to smear the paint on like gum."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A bold and dashing style is better, George, what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When you've earned the right to be bold, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vine Cottage dined at half-past twelve, and Kitty was
      frying half a dozen sausages when she heard the scullery
      door thrown open. There were sounds of someone and
      something coming in, bumpings, manoeuvrings, a creaking of
      springs. She left the gas-stove for a moment, taking her
      frying pan with her, and saw through the doorway Alex
      adjusting his chair so that he could reach the brass taps
      over the sink.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's me--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Which was obvious, as obvious as his bad grammar and the
      enterprise of the moment, and his inability to reach the
      soap dish which was attached by a nail to the tiled wall.
      She went in and placed a cake of yellow soap within his
      reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you manage, boy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather. This chair's lovely. Right--I can get at the
      towel. I say--that smells good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sausages, real vulgar sausages and mashed potatoes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Splendid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And a suet pudding and treacle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've a hunger. I say--I can wheel myself up to the kitchen
      table. Save a lot of trouble. You won't have to carry
      things about."
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned with her frying-pan to the gas-stove, and they
      talked to each other through the open doorway to the
      accompaniment of splashing water and sizzling sausages.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have you been doing, boy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Creosoting floorboards."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I'm going to paint the garden tables. I say--the
      dancing pavilion looks lovely. Black and white and green.
      I've been thinking about the colour of the curtains."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O! What's your taste?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Purple. A good rich purple."
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood with her head slightly tilted, turning sausages
      with an attentive fork.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Purple? That's it--absolutely it. Clever boy! Believe
      you've more idea of colour than I have. I'm too fond of
      pinking things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say--that's sporting of you, Kit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Taking suggestions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't it a partnership? We are doing it together."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a dear. And about the garden umbrellas."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seems to me they ought to be yellow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then we'll have them yellow."

      The April sunlight pouring in, lit up all that end of the
      kitchen table where these two sat opposite each other,
      enjoying those nicely browned sausages. Alex was hungry,
      and in appreciating his hunger and the way in which he was
      disposing of the food she had cooked Kitty felt possessed
      by a sense of security. Life was a solid business, as solid
      as suet pudding, but it had to be nicely cooked. Her ideals
      rested upon a foundation of sound, material facts, but
      given her foundations she could spread a surprising pair of
      gossamer wings. For, to a woman matter is both matter and
      symbolism, and Kitty, feeling the sun on her tawny head and
      being aware of the disappearance of those sausages, became
      conscious of her throne. Here and now was her opportunity,
      the moment of the making of a notable gesture. Five minutes
      ago her head had been empty of any such thought, but here
      were the facts, the points of attachment for the main
      threads of her web.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said: "Alex, we ought to let your mother know."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had surprised him. He put down his knife and fork and
      looked at her across the table. A moment ago he had been a
      simple creature placidly eating.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let her know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. She had a smooth, sleek air. One side of her
      round face flowed in the sunlight like the sunward half of
      an apple.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His face had lost its look of physical contentment. He had
      become self-conscious. His next glance at her was upward,
      tentative, slightly anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But need we?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She placed another sausage on his plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't it--inevitable? Besides--we have nothing to fear.
      She must be trying to find out. Much more dignified for
      us--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to crouch slightly in his chair. His silence had
      a kind of breathlessness. His eyes had grown very dark, as
      though they were absorbing some new impression of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll let her come here--and see me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "After the way--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--I owe it to myself--and to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on with his dinner, but it was obvious to her that
      he was consuming other food. And he was silent. He allowed
      her to change the plates, and to place a wedge of pudding
      before him. She pushed a glass dish filled with golden
      syrup within his reach, and he stared at it for a moment
      before dipping a spoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd much rather she didn't come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So would I. But then--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He held the spoon over his plate and let the syrup loop
      itself in patterns over the pudding.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't forgiven her yet. She--she was ready to make a
      rotter of me. I've been seeing things--rather clearly, Kit.
      It's pretty awful to have to think such things about one's
      mater--I'd like to forget--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was watching him with an inward, consoling smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So we can. What does it matter--now? One burns or buries
      one's rubbish, boy. Let's get it over."
    </p>
    <p>
      His face expressed sudden relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, let's get it over. But I must say--it's jolly fine of
      you, Kitty. Shall I write, or will you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll write. I'll ask her to come and see us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By George," said he suddenly, jabbing at his pudding; "if
      you had wanted to give her one back."
    </p>
    <p>
      She reached for the golden syrup.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sometimes--one does--without wanting to--How's the
      pudding? I'm a little out of practice with my puddings."

    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George brooded for two days over Kitty's letter.
      It said so little, and it said so much, but had Alex's
      mother been a woman with any sense of humour, or one
      capable of giving way to a generous impulse--she would have
      felt less inwardly ravaged. She had been made to appear
      ridiculous. She could neither laugh, nor weep, nor swear.
      Though inwardly and violently raging she had to button
      herself up against ridicule, against the inquisitive
      glances of her servants, and the complacent curiosity of
      her friends. Only to herself could she let herself go, and
      she did let herself go. In the privacy of her own mind she
      behaved like a dishevelled fury. She saw in that letter of
      Kitty's nothing but the gesture of a gloating little
      housemaid stretching out a hand to the vanquished. A
      little, butter-headed thing being melodramatically
      magnanimous! And that sly and succulent old mother
      sniggering down her broad nose! Vulgar people, impossible
      people, triumphant people!
    </p>
    <p>
      Refusing ridicule, she had to consume her own anger. She
      could sack Leaper and Sandys, and she did sack them; she
      hastened to inform the police that she had troubled them
      unnecessarily. She could produce dew upon the polite
      forehead of Dr. Dazely. He offered her bromide both in a
      bottle and in his sympathy, and she would accept neither.
      She said: "I shall keep my boy's room just as it is. He may
      need it when that girl has reduced him to--a state--of
      degradation."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Dazely made suave noises.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suggest that he still needs treatment. I should be quite
      willing--"
    </p>
    <p>
      But his blandness had ceased to be of use. She gave him one
      of her effacing stares.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no interference, please. I have tried. Let him explore
      the alternative."
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly she was a woman of remarkable consistency, though
      to any other woman a man less bland than Dr. Dazely might
      have exclaimed: "Drink your medicine, dear lady, drink it
      down and have done with it. The bitterer the pill--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not reply to Kitty's letter. She was in no fit
      temper to reply to it. She felt dishevelled after the icy
      blowing of her rage, and she knew the need of tidying her
      hair and composing her blue glances. As to going to see
      these two at their cottage at Shelford--well--such a visit
      would have to be reconnoitred. She found herself in an
      absurd and a monstrous dilemma. She had assured her son
      that he had married a harlot, and her son had gone back to
      his harlot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, dignity and yet more dignity. It would not do for her
      to allow that her glass case had been broken. She must look
      in her mirror and consider the distinctions of the woman of
      the world. She would assume the dignity of a too-devoted
      mother, and having dressed herself in this pose she went
      out to meet the world. She processed with the same rigid
      back, and the same blue glare in her eyes. She appeared at
      committee meetings; she was seen at the theatre, and
      driving in her car with a newly-engaged chauffeur at the
      wheel. She made a point of visiting people whom she knew
      were eager to snigger, and she effaced the veriest
      incipience of a snigger. She wrote to the various Smythes
      and St. Georges, giving them the impression that she was
      letting youth have its way, but that she remained the
      mother in the background.
    </p>
    <p>
      She left Alex's room untouched. She made a point of using
      it herself, and receiving people in it. She sat in her
      chair like a woman of glass. To the people who wished to
      see her wounded--and they were not a few--she displayed a
      cool, calm candour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My son is living with his wife. They have a little place
      on the river. But I like to keep this room--just as it
      is--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She implied that some day he would need it and her, though
      had she been a woman with any emotional facility she would
      have packed half the contents of the room into a van and
      sent them down to Vine Cottage. He needed them now. But she
      did not send him so much as a pair of trousers. With one
      movement of the hand she could have responded with human
      gesture to that letter of Kitty's. She had her chance and
      missed it, because she was determined to remain dangerous
      to Kitty. She would accept no judgment of Solomon.
    </p>
    <p>
      She persisted in believing all that she wished to believe,
      and her opinion of Kitty and of No. 7 Vernor Street had not
      changed one iota. She had suffered a defeat, but she still
      had resources. And at the end of a week of public parades,
      and a calculated flouting of her own world's inclination to
      think of her as "Poor Clare St. George," she went to see
      her lawyer.

      Every case should have its nice point, but the point of
      Mrs. St. George's argument shaped itself rather like a
      cypher, and old Test, pushing out his lips and sucking them
      in again, admitted that there was nothing to be done.
      "You've no case, no case at all. Obviously."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George was quite aware of the fact that she had no
      case. It was superfluous of Mr. Test to point out to her
      that if there had been irregularities in the young person's
      past--he emphasized the "if"--Alex had condoned them. He
      was living with his wife. He had every right to live with
      his wife. It was a proof of social virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then that long sly mouth of Mr. Test's curled itself
      expressively, and his eyes glimmered at Mrs. St. George.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the way--what are they living on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not on me. Alex may have a little money at his bank. It
      won't last long."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Test seemed to snap his eyelids under his arched grey
      eyebrows. The facial movement said "Exactly." He smiled at
      Mrs. St. George; she amused him; her ruthlessness had a
      fascination. He picked up the trend of her schemings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The wife wrote to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George produced Kitty's letter, and after reading
      it, he sucked in his long lips. He considered it to be a
      very proper letter. But--then--of course no statement could
      be accepted on its face value. You searched for the
      ulterior motive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She holds out a hand. A conciliatory letter. Which
      means--or should mean--that her position is not quite so
      strong as it appears to be."
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave Mrs. St. George one of his rogue's glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Funds--eh--funds! That's it--probably."

      Each generation may throw down some of the fences erected
      by its fathers. "O, humbug," and there is a push of the
      foot, and youth takes a shortcut, while elderly people talk
      of Bolshevism and the decay of manners. Not that the short
      cut may get youth there, but it is youth's way, and Dr.
      Gordon Drake's short cuts were sometimes embarrassing. They
      cut across the formalities and social delays. He had no use
      for door-bells, or knockers and sulky servants. He walked
      in.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would pull up that little grey car of his, slam the
      door, walk rapidly on his short, busy legs across a
      pavement or up a garden path, and push in. He appeared
      suddenly in bedrooms with a kind of cheery ruthlessness
      that ignored the set of a lace cap or the disorder of a
      dressing-table. He appeared there in the Vine Cottage
      kitchen when Kitty was rolling out pastry and dusting it
      from a flour dredger. He gave her a nod and a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo--I see you've got him going."
    </p>
    <p>
      No doubt she had. For Alex could be seen through the
      kitchen window, seated in his chair on the grass, with a
      paint pot ingeniously slung over a forked stick, a sack
      over his knees, and one of old George's garden tables
      nicely placed. Brush in hand he was painting the top of the
      table, bending forward, and completely absorbed in the
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, yes, he's splendid. I knew he would be."
    </p>
    <p>
      She and Dr. Drake might belong to the same generation, but
      the fences that a woman penetrates may not be those that
      are chosen by a man. It is possible that a woman is more
      cautious and more subtle in her penetrations. And Kitty
      gave Dr. Drake a glance that had a gleam of sacred fire in
      it. It was both defensive and aggressive; it warned the
      world that though she had had cause to pity her husband no
      one else had or should have the right to do so. A man's
      pride and hers were realities.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do hate ringing bells," said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Drake observed her with his air of whimsical and
      ruthless good humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wastes time. People want to be so confoundedly private.
      But you have been doing some suggesting."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him a veiled look. "What's that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stimulation--unadvertised, a tot of rum in the tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't believe in spirits."
    </p>
    <p>
      He replied with a faint smile. He might be as sharp as a
      scalpel, but his very sharpness cut so quickly through some
      of the fine tissues of life that he sometimes failed to
      observe them. But he could admire this sturdy little woman
      with her warm throat and her fearless dark eyes. It is
      possible that he thought her much too good for her mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everything all right?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite," said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll go out and have a word with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went out into the garden, and she heard the two voices,
      Alex's boyish and a little excited, Drake's deliberate and
      faintly superior. She turned to look. Drake was bending
      forward to examine the top of Alex's table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite professional, my lad, quite professional."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Kitty gave a little scowl at his flat and
      self-confident back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damn you, don't treat him like a child."
    </p>
    <p>
      No one heard her, and as she watched the two men she
      realized that Alex was not conscious of being treated like
      a child, and something that she had always known about him
      seemed to become more vividly known. It evoked a spasm of
      tenderness. The real Alex, the Alex of Maleham, and of that
      paint pot was a very lovable creature. Dr. Gordon Drake
      might be as efficient as hell, but it was a cold hell. And
      she smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Alex had put his brush into the paint pot, had backed
      his chair away from the table, and was trundling himself in
      the direction of the dancing pavilion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come on, doc. I'll show you."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Dr. Gordon Drake was following him rather with the air
      of one humouring a child. Kitty, stroking her cheek, left a
      dusting of flour upon it. The ruthless realist was not
      laughter proof, nor was his hair so sleekly groomed that it
      could not be tweaked. For somehow--to the young wife at the
      window the child in Alex laughed at the topical droll
      hardness of the other man. Youth can be alive and
      impudently alive. There is a difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which carried the day on to Mrs. Sarah, and an afternoon
      train from Waterloo, a Mrs. Sarah who joined Alex in the
      garden and joined in this game, not trespassing upon his
      sand-castle, but spading away at one of her own. She put on
      a pair of spectacles, and with a rug over her knees, hemmed
      tablecloths. They got on capitally together, while Kitty
      went out and did some shopping, for Mrs. Sarah had
      discovered the secret of eternal youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though, had she applied herself to putting her wisdom into
      writing, her aphorisms might have lost some of their
      expressiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perfume, appetite, taste, desire. Yes, that elusive yet
      essential perfume that is dissipated so easily, especially
      in cities. The impulse to bury your nose in any bunch of
      flowers. But--always--a tantalizing incompleteness, a few
      grapes bobbing out of reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The shop window, my dear, and a fur coat at fifty guineas,
      and three and sevenpence in your purse! Only don't get
      nasty about it. Get going." Or "Salmon at so much a pound,
      and you--going home with a couple of kippers. But
      meaning--some day--to get the salmon."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, that was what Mrs. Sarah symbolized, a healthy body
      from the country, an eternal desire for something or other,
      a wholesome hunger that is never surfeited. And when you
      grew a little stout and short of breath, happiness could be
      found in desiring other things, different things, perhaps
      things for your children or your friends, and in making a
      back for the youngsters to climb on. Though not too much of
      a back. Youngsters should get scratched in gathering their
      own blackberries.
    </p>

      And here was English Kitty getting things, and luring her
      lad after her to play the great game of getting and living!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah, squinting down her broad nose, threaded a
      needle, and then glanced at Alex's table, and praised its
      new glossiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I always did like the smell of paint."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you?"--and he dipped a brush.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Makes me feel young. Paint pots come out with the spring,
      and so do wallflowers. That's a nice green."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, isn't it. The legs are a bit of a business. What I do
      is--paint the top first, and let it dry, and then I turn
      the thing upside down on a box."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing like using your wits, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      For Alex was using his wits, and if more of the postwar
      neurasthenics had had Kitties to stimulate them, the
      failures would have been less dismal and less obvious. He
      was discovering a multitude of jobs. He cleaned knives,
      boots, silver, saucepans; he washed up dishes, peeled
      potatoes, and split firewood. Kitty had discovered him
      trundling about with a carpet-sweeper, and he most
      ingeniously contrived to make his own bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say--Mrs. Sarah--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I find I've got over three hundred pounds at Cox's. That's
      going to be a help, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to back Kitty up--for all I'm worth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you're doing it. Keep smiling my dear. People don't
      smile half enough, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat back to observe his table, and found it good.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say--it seems we are going to have trouble about getting
      those garden umbrellas."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think so--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kitty says--she's going to one of the stores next week.
      They ought to be yellow--a nice bright yellow. Show up well
      from the river, and make a nice colour scheme. I'm rather a
      knut on colour, Mrs. Sarah."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've got ideas."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, only bits of ideas. Kitty's got the brain--I mean--for
      managing and looking ahead. Isn't she a wonder?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's happy," said Mrs. Sarah.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alex, lifting the paint pot to him, and stirring the paint
      with a stick, looked very gravely at its greenness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You really think she is--? I'm such a
      responsibility--But--I'm most awfully happy--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on like that, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a flushed, shy, kindling glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've been awfully good to us--I can say things to
      you--somehow. O, and has Kitty told you about the
      china--the plates and cups--I mean--for the show?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We thought of having what they call cottage ware, cream
      coloured stuff with red cherries on it. Nice, and
      simple--but chic. Just a little original. The thing is to
      be rather original--isn't it? Makes people feel they are
      getting something a little unusual."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah crinkled up her nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's--it. You go on getting original ideas, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      He blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really? And--O--I say--I've got another idea. We are going
      to call our show 'Kitty's.' And I've thought of having a
      big notice-board put up somewhere down the river. Believe I
      could paint it myself--something like this--'Come and Dance
      at Kitty's at Shelford. Watch for the Yellow Umbrellas.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a very good idea," said Mrs. Sarah. "Watch for the
      yellow umbrellas. That's the touch! Bless you; isn't life a
      game!"
    </p>

      II
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      The vicissitudes of that first post-war spring were not
      unlike the moods of the men who returned to a land that was
      not full of heroes. If the voice of the yellow dog was
      heard in it, and the snarl of the ex-munitioneer, the
      weather, too, had its wild moments. Snow on the chestnut
      blossom and on the young green of the year. A howling
      blizzard in May.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Alex went on with his painting, just as Kitty went on
      with her cooking and her cleaning and her planning. If it
      rained, Alex trundled himself into the completed
      dance-house, and with papers spread on the new floor,
      continued to paint a whole family of garden tables, chairs
      and benches. He had developed a passion for painting
      everything and anything. Mrs. Sarah declared that he was
      longing to repaint Old George.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never you mind, my dear. It's going to be a great time for
      talkers. You get on with the job."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had a curious and human understanding of the world
      situation, and not as it was staged at Versailles. She
      assured her intimates who came to gossip with her at No. 7
      that the world was like a mob of boys let out of school.
      They wanted to play, while somebody else did the paying.
      Quite natural of course--but not business. Yes, and the
      loutish minded might want to play rather roughly, with no
      rules to the game, and be ready to foul kick the other
      fellow if the other fellow appeared to be the possessor of
      a better pair of boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, let 'em play. If there had to be a post-war madness,
      the madder it was--the sooner it would be done with. Men
      might be fools, but on the whole they were rather decent
      fools, especially in England. If you could manage to
      suppress the foul kickers on both sides--Meanwhile, the
      world would want to rush to the river and the roads and the
      sports grounds and the dancing-floors, and Kitty--with some
      prescience--had erected her booth beside one of the paths
      that might be chosen by the rushing herd.
    </p>
    <p>
      But April had washed her face early and assumed a smile on
      the day when Mrs. St. George ordered out her car and drove
      down to Shelford to spy out the land. She might visit Vine
      Cottage, and she might not. She came to gather impressions.
      Her man, judging himself to be in the centre of Shelford
      when he saw the Ship Inn and the church, turned his car
      into Abbot's Close and pulled up beside the pollarded
      lime-trees. He left his seat and opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shelford, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George descended. She was in black. A sentimental
      person might have seen in her a woman about to visit a
      grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can wait here, Barter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      A man in a white apron was painting the rectory gate. Mrs.
      St. George crossed the road and asked to be directed to
      Vine Cottage, and was told to take the first turning on the
      left, but before taking it she strolled down Limes Walk to
      the river. She stood and looked at the river. It was
      crimped with sunlight and wind dappled, and it made a
      prattling against the black side of the ferry-boat that lay
      at the ferry steps. The trees were filling with young
      green. An idle fellow was throwing a stick for an eager,
      yelping retriever who disturbed Mrs. St. George's dignity
      by coming and shaking himself within a yard of her person.
      Even the post-war dogs had neither manners nor
      consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned and walked slowly down the lane. She looked at
      the little old red houses, cottages and shops, so
      individual and so English, and at the trees and the
      flowering shrubs sunning themselves above the red brick
      walls of the three Georgian houses whose gardens came down
      to the Lane. She had occasional glimpses of the river. The
      fruit trees in the orchard opposite Vine Cottage were
      breaking into blossom. A weeping willow in the garden next
      to Kitty's home spread like a fountain of pale gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George had come to Vine Cottage. She read the name
      painted in white letters on the green door in the garden
      wall. She walked deliberately as far as the shop window.
      The white blind was down, and two or three decrepit
      flies--survivors of the winter--were crawling on the white
      surface. She looked at the fascia board above the shop
      window and in fresh white lettering she read the
      inscription "Kitty."
    </p>
    <p>
      She stared very hard at it for some seconds. Her blue eyes
      had a deliberate, cold brightness. So this was the place!
      It included a shop, an unopened shop, Kitty's shop. Another
      argument--perhaps? A hint--a suggestion? But why not "Kitty
      St. George?" Was the St. George held nicely in reserve?
      There were the two doors offering to compromise with the
      visitor the glass-fronted shop-door screened by a white
      curtain, and the green door under the white hood of the
      porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George thought it a poor, poky, little place
      tucked away in a lane! Yes, its pokiness was obvious,
      impudent yet apologetic. To Mrs. St. George, Vine Cottage
      seemed to stand like the conventional housemaid, making the
      most of a clean apron and a pert assertion of
      respectability. A flimsy place, a poor, thin little piece
      of bluff. And there was something in Clara St. George that
      exulted. If she had hoped--well--here was her hope, a thing
      of pasteboard that might be crumpled and pushed over. The
      other woman's defences? How flimsy! You maintained a
      chilly, staring silence until such a moment as the apron
      should go up over the housemaid's head. You spoke calmly of
      a month's wages.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glittered. She walked to the porch, and put a gloved
      finger on the black bell-push. She heard the burr of the
      bell somewhere in the interior of that impertinent little
      house. She smiled. She was conscious of a feeling of cold
      and delicate curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      III
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened to be on Monday morning, and Kitty had been at
      her wash-tub, and was putting the linen through the wringer
      when the bell rang. She said--"Damn." Monday morning is
      always Monday morning, and washing is washing, but she
      dried her hands on the roller towel, and went to the front
      door just as she was, in blue print frock and white apron.
      Her sleeves were rolled up, and her hands and forearms
      retained the pinkness of the hot suds and water.
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened the door and discovered Mrs. St. George.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, of the two faces, Kitty's was the one to change its
      expression. She had opened the door rather with the air of
      a busy young woman resenting interruption when the clothes
      line was waiting for her linen, but the substitution of one
      expression for another was so swift and so natural that
      Mrs. St. George was still registering conflicting
      impressions when Kitty spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please come in. It's washing day, but I'm sure you won't
      mind. Alex is in the garden."
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood to one side, smiling and holding the door open.
      Her eyes looked straight up and out at Mrs. St. George. She
      had the glow of the wash-tub upon her, and within
      her--under that perfect skin--other glowings. She showed to
      Mrs. St. George a compact and deliberate dignity, a surface
      that Alex's mother would prefer to have stigmatized as base
      metal--mere brass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wondered when we should see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      She shone, and the rays of her played upon Mrs. St.
      George's casket of glass. It was a peculiar moment for them
      both, charged with sudden self-realizations, a vivid
      piecing together of emotional fragments, a balancing of
      strains and stresses. Mrs. St. George glided into the
      passage, and as she did so she thought--"I'm welcome
      here--for a reason! Now--shall we keep our masks on?" She
      looked along the length of cheap brown linoleum covering
      the passage floor. Kitty was closing the door. It seemed to
      her that she and Mrs. St. George were meeting on the beach
      of a desert island after a night of shipwreck had
      interrupted them in the thick of a fine and strenuous
      quarrel. "Mrs. St. George--I believe--?"--"Ah, how do you
      do. My daughter-in-law--I presume." They were both figures
      of glass suspended in mid air, and cushioned against
      clashings by a consciousness of previous impacts. Yes,
      there had been that interruption. Was it to be mutually and
      tacitly recognized?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please--excuse me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Without any appearance of haste Kitty slipped past Alex's
      mother, and threw open the door of the sitting-room. It was
      the plainest and the least successful of her rooms, for she
      had economized in the furnishing of it in order that Alex's
      room might have the best that she could give. It was very
      much a second-hand room, full of bargains, though the
      curtains were bright and new.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please come in here."
    </p>
    <p>
      She watched Mrs. St. George move down the passage. She was
      reminded of a woman of height and of social altitude
      walking down and out of a shop to a waiting car. She was
      made to feel that here were no commitments. The formalities
      were to be cherished. And so she let Mrs. St. George pass
      in, and closed the door, and turned an armchair--that was
      one of Mrs. Sarah's bargains--towards the light. Very
      deliberately Mrs. St George sat down in it--as though
      giving the chair time to hold its breath and bear the
      honour, while Kitty stood for a moment, aware of Alex's
      mother observing things as a certain type of woman observes
      them, without any appearance of troubling to observe. The
      very carpet, Axminster and second-hand, showed unashamedly
      a bold bare spot close to Mrs. St. George's toes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are just straight. It was so difficult getting
      furniture. But we've managed."
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down on the loose-covered sofa, in the very middle
      of it and between two large pink roses, as though occupying
      the centre of her stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite a nice bright view. And quite a good piece of
      garden."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George's eyes looked through and beyond her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I observe--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And above flood level. It really was rather a bargain.
      Shall I call Alex--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Presently. So--you purchased--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. My mother advanced the money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see, she has some property."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause, and a pause that was deliberate on the
      part of Alex's mother. She sat very straight in her chair.
      She asked no questions, but she sat there like an
      interrogation framed in the flesh, judicial, an examiner,
      waiting for her son's wife to produce answers. She had
      known how to make many people feel self-conscious and
      uncomfortable. She could exert a silent pressure that
      squeezed from the more sensitive and less restrained
      nervous chatterings and explainings and excuses. Kitty
      should burst like a squeezed orange and extrude the pips
      and the juice. But Kitty continued to sit there in the
      middle of the sofa without any sign of responding to
      pressure or of being inconvenienced by it, her eyes fixed
      steadily upon Mrs. St. George's.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said: "Yes, we are managing. I have a little money of
      my own, and Alex has a little. We are going to give teas
      and dances to river parties. And possibly I shall re-open
      the shop. Alex is getting on splendidly. His doctor is very
      pleased with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George replied with a slight inclination of the
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alex is there in the garden. He has a wheel chair now. If
      you stand up you will be able to see him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again there was a short pause, but Mrs. St. George did not
      move a muscle. It was Kitty who stood up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure you would like to speak with Alex alone. I have
      left my washing. It has to go through the wringer. Perhaps,
      while I'm finishing it you would like to go out into the
      garden."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave Mrs. St. George a confident smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't mind, do you? I shan't be very long, but at
      present I haven't a girl to help me. The door at the end of
      the passage leads into the garden. These old places are
      full of doors."
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George was left seated and alone. A woman of many
      isolations, loving her own cold self, she had never felt
      the need of people, nor wished to have them too intimately
      near her. She had resembled a white cat on a fur rug in
      front of her own fire. Or, life had been an ivory keyboard
      to be played upon with cold calm fingers, and always she
      had preferred to play music of her own composing. A most
      solitary woman, she had never known the snugness of true
      solitude, that aloneness with one's warm and purring self,
      but in that room of Kitty's she did experience what was for
      her a sense of isolation and of loneliness. She still wore
      her mask but beneath it there were quiverings, a shiver of
      chilly self-questioning. She had been bereft of something.
      This little, butter-headed thing had appeared so solid and
      confident, though this air of confidence might be bluff,
      the ostentatious opening of a door, a studied frankness.
      Kitty had appeared less flimsy than her house, a little
      stubborn creature warm with the warmness of her youth and
      its labours.
    </p>
    <p>
      But teas provided for river parties! A shop! And her son?
    </p>
    <p>
      And, suddenly, Mrs. St. George stood up; she walked to the
      window; her alert, hard eyes appeared to surround
      themselves with a number of fine lines. She saw her son. He
      was seated in his chair on the grass above the river,
      painting away at one of the many garden tables. He wore no
      hat. His back was turned towards the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something stirred in his mother, a sudden cold passion to
      repossess, the same passion that had quickened in her when
      she had seen him lying like an idiot child in his bed at
      Poynter's Hill. She turned and going out into the passage,
      opened the garden door. She opened it very gently, and left
      it open behind her. She stepped on to the grass and went
      slowly down the gradual slope, noiselessly gliding.
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      V
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      Even a Mrs. St. George stores memories, and Alex's mother
      had one memory of her son's childhood that had never failed
      to rouse in her a vague and resentful consciousness of life
      as a thing apart, a fluid substance that had slipped
      through her fingers. And now on this April day, her son
      behaved as he had behaved as a child, a child happily
      absorbed in some fascinating game of its own and resenting
      interruption. His mother's interruptions had signalled
      interference. She surprised the grown child. She saw him
      glance round and up at her with a quick frown of eagerness
      and fear, his eyes open very wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mater--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And then his face changed almost as quickly as Kitty's face
      had changed in the Vine Cottage doorway. It clouded over
      with a kind of brittle sullenness. He sat very still for a
      moment. Then he placed his brush carefully in the paint
      pot, raised himself up in his chair, and looked sideways at
      his mother's knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doing a bit of painting. Does Kitty know you're here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George stood like Lot's wife. Once again she was
      being given her chance to liquefy herself, but there was
      that in her which was its own congealer. She looked down at
      her son's table as she had looked upon some of his toys.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have seen your wife. She asked me to come out. I am here
      to see--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her son looked up at her with a sudden blankness. It was as
      though many emotions moved in him, but not one of them
      could reach the surface and find expression. Or perhaps
      these many emotions neutralized each other. His face had a
      helplessly frozen look, and when he spoke it had the effect
      of stammering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry--there isn't a chair. Won't you--call Kitty."
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother's arms were rigid at her sides. Something was
      happening in her. One hand--the right--opened and closed
      its fingers with a slow, spasmodic jerkiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there any need? I have come to see--"
    </p>
    <p>
      His head jerked upwards. She saw his eyes alive with a
      sudden, vivid brightness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mater, I'm awfully happy here--I've never been so happy
      before--If you're worrying--"
    </p>
    <p>
      The glass shell of her was starred and cracked.

      Mr. Jermyn St. George was back in town with a chest as dry
      as his humour. When he walked into the smoking-room of
      "Hacketts," and found Thompson, the senior club-servant,
      tidying up the journals and magazines on one of the tables,
      Mr. Jermyn St. George experienced a very distinct thrill.
      Never had a man enjoyed life more astutely than he had. May
      was in Pall Mall, and Thompson, straightening up with a
      flash of brass buttons, smiled all over his wise round face
      at Mr. Jermyn St. George.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very glad to see you, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was glad, and so was Mr. Jermyn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very glad to be back, Thompson. Any news?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing of importance, sir. Sir Jonathan Crust's dead,
      sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha--is he! Then--I shan't play musical chairs with him any
      more for that place by the window. And how are you,
      Thompson?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am very well, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You always are--and you always look it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jermyn sat down in his favourite chair by one of the
      windows overlooking Pall Mall. It was earlyish, and the big
      room--empty and noiseless--and lined with books between its
      high windows, seemed to envelop old Jermyn with velvet
      arms. He stretched himself. His brick-red face, with its
      very white hair above its dark and mischievous eyes,
      expressed ironical contentment. He looked at the people
      passing on the opposite pavement. Somewhere a quill pen
      scratched soberly, a sound full of so many mellow
      associations that it fretted no old English nerves. He
      looked at the books, at the solid chairs and sofas tinted
      like old rust on a door hinge, at the central writing-table
      with its neat cases of club stationery, at the huge turkey
      carpet dimly glowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damn it," he thought, "with care--I ought to have another
      ten years. Life's good."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had the appearance of one of those man fated to live for
      ever. His red face, with its dark, jocund eyes, looked
      imperishable. He was still so full of amiable devilry. He
      could not resist the pulling of a leg, or even legs that
      were made to be looked at rather than to be pulled, and
      postwar England was developing the apotheosis of the leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glad I've lived long enough to see it. Youth's going to
      show us a few things."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was full of chuckles, beneficent chuckles. Life had
      treated him well; it would have treated him kindly had he
      been a tramp. And he sat there and basked in the winter of
      his wellness, and saw the sunlight on the faces of the tall
      houses, and thought of the cigar he would smoke presently,
      and the people whom he would see. Yes, he was going to
      enjoy himself. Life still pulled.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was young Alex--! And his mother! His mouth twisted
      itself humorously. He was the one St. George to whom Mrs.
      Clara had not communicated the news of her son's defection,
      but old Jermyn knew about it. He had a way of getting to
      know about everything. Certainly the details were not
      complete, but the filling in of the details would provide
      him with some nice amusement. He would go and hear for
      himself and see. Not that Clara would be pleased to see
      him. O, not at all! He had never treated her with what she
      had considered to be a proper respect. He had once told her
      that she had no sense of humour. Unforgivable frankness!
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mrs. Sarah--and the young people? His jocund eyes
      twinkled at the thought of Mrs. Sarah! Assuredly he would
      stroll round after lunch when he had finished his cigar,
      and enjoy a gossip with that inimitable woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      No. 7 Vernor Street was but a comfortable toddle,
      especially for an old buck who wore check trousers and a
      grey felt hat, and kept to the sunny side of the pavement.
      Old Jermyn had lunched well. His cigar had been a good one,
      and when he came to No. 7 and found Corah still serving
      behind the counter he felt that he had many years to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my dear, how's everybody?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody appeared to be in the best of health and in the
      best of tempers, and old Jermyn asked himself upstairs
      where Mrs. Sarah was reading a novel and eating chocolates
      out of a box. She put aside the novel, but not the
      chocolates. She was in high humour; she was welcoming the
      one St. George who could enjoy a jest, and who had remained
      a bachelor. Mr. Jermyn understood the why and the wherefore
      of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down as though sitting down in her presence was a
      sacred yet humorous act.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--well--how's our little swashbuckler? I hear she has
      torn our little Alex out of the arms of 'Cardigan Square'."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah passed him the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dare I? But tell me all about it. I have been scenting
      something epic."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah could tell a tale, and to tell a tale to Mr.
      Jermyn St. George was an inspiration in itself. Beside,
      what a tale it was! He enjoyed the hearing of it almost as
      much as she enjoyed the telling of it; he sat there smiling
      like a gentlemanly old faun, his jocund eyes full of
      mischief; while his lean face seemed to grow more red under
      his very white hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kidnapped him--did she! Fancy kidnapping your own husband.
      Splendiferous! And what has happened since, alarums and
      excursions?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He had to hear all about Vine Cottage, and Kitty's
      dance-house and Alex's jazz-band, and the yellow umbrellas,
      and all the adventurousness of a young wife with a husband
      tied to a wheeled chair. Old Jermyn enjoyed every bit of
      it. It was a great business. He seemed to hear the clash of
      cymbals and the rub-a-dub of a drum. He pulled droll and
      whimsical grimaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Splendiferous! And how has the good lady taken it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah believed that Mrs. St. George had taken it very
      badly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see, Mr. Jermyn, she went down there thinking she
      might find Alex in the mopes, and sighing for the
      flesh-pots. She found him as happy as a sandboy. By the
      way--what is a sandboy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haven't the faintest idea," said old Jermyn. "But I do
      know that I shall go down to Shelford to-morrow. When does
      Kitty's show start?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are thinking of opening on the last Saturday in May."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what are you doing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah looked sly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Preparing a party. O--I can pull a few strings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I bet you can. Same here. The last Saturday in May. My
      dear lady, we must squeeze the grape. And I must charter a
      steamboat, or something. We must give them a send off. Why,
      it's a public duty, a salute to youth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it is," said Mrs. Sarah. "It's nothing short of a
      revolution. A real, live St. George beating a drum!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The heart of Old Mischief--as someone had christened
      him--was as sound as Alex's drum. On leaving No. 7 Vernor
      Street he had proposed returning to his club, but his
      puckishness intervening, he hailed a taxi and told the man
      to drive him to No. 77 Cardigan Square. He would call upon
      Clara St. George; she would give him tea, and indications.
      His eyelids narrowed over twinkling eyes. He felt moved to
      observe Clara, to peer at her from amid the leaves of his
      puckishness. Poor Clara, a woman who could with such cold
      consistency lie herself into so ironical a dilemma! But old
      Jermyn's dealings in mischief were not malevolent. He sat
      in the taxi, swaying slightly, his gloved hands resting on
      the silver top of his cane, his grey hat set at an angle.
      He had always said that good women were the very devil.
      They would try and lie you out of your own particular hell
      into their own particular heaven. But what a holy mess many
      of them made of their heaven! Poor Clara! Always she had
      appeared to be incapable of laughter, a woman who could not
      loosen her stays--
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been times when Mr. Jermyn had felt actively
      venomous towards Clara. She had mishandled men and things
      so cruelly. Never had she allowed her men to play. And now
      she was sitting alone at the foot of her North Pole in a
      little world of repressions, while the young life she had
      helped to create flowed apart through other and adventurous
      seas. The woman who had wanted everything for herself and
      who had got it--to a point, now was not wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Platitudes! Were parents always to be big fools like their
      children? Pompous fools? Old Jermyn's eyes were not unkind,
      but he was full of curiosity, a humorous and prying Pan,
      piping his way through the woods, and throwing swift, pagan
      glances at all creatures that went naked, and loved to
      dance. What foolishness was cradled when life refused to
      dance! Those rigid people, those correct and wickedly
      self-conscious people who would not or could not loosen
      their girdles! People whose mothers had worn bustles, and
      leg of mutton sleeves, and whose seemly skirts had brushed
      the pavements! Buttoned up people, obsessed by the eternal,
      uncompromising and egregious "I."
    </p>
    <p>
      The taxi swerved towards the pavement below the solemn
      front of No. 77, and as Mr. Jermyn reached out a hand
      towards the window strap, a young thing went by with short
      skirts trembling above a pair of silk stockinged legs. And
      such legs!
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jermyn raised his hat to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Salve--juventus--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely the Bishop's Apron was a flag that had been hauled
      down, and in its place the world would fly an audacious,
      scampering petticoat?
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p align="center">

    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St George was at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not pretend to pleasure at seeing Jermyn, but she
      gave him a cold hand. She received him in Alex's room,
      where the bed still stood covered by a black and gold silk
      quilt, and the long chair by the window and the gramophone
      and the banjo remained like the toys of a dead child. The
      room and its contents provoked comment, but Mr. Jermyn made
      no comments, and asked no questions. He used his eyes. He
      observed the fire burning in the grate and his
      sister-in-law's chair drawn close to it, though the May sun
      was shining.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, 'Dora' is not dead yet. How have you managed for
      coal?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She made some very perfunctory reply to this very
      platitudinous question. She had never been able to
      understand Jermyn's reputation for wit; she had failed to
      discover it; always he had talked to her as though he was
      cracking nuts and throwing the shells into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Torquay appears to have suited you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jermyn had many things to say concerning the climate of
      Torquay. He could be as prolix as any club bore when he
      pleased. Meanwhile, he was observing his sister-in-law. She
      was different; she was as rigid as ever, but with the
      rigidity of a woman who had been ill. She gave him the
      impression of a woman who had had something broken inside
      her, and who was afraid to move lest the cracked pieces
      should fall apart. And she looked cold, physically cold;
      she sat close up to the fire, and unconsciously she would
      stretch out her hands to it. Old Jermyn was reminded of his
      own description of her as a woman with an electric bulb
      installed inside her in lieu of a heart. And the glass bulb
      had been cracked!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was conscious of a feeling of pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      For, damn it, the woman was lonely, with a horrible,
      inhuman loneliness. There was no doubt about it. The very
      room shivered, and that empty bed and the forsaken toys
      were full of frozen pathos. What a mess she had made of
      things! She had concocted her freezing mixture, and here
      she was dabbling her own cold feet in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not help glancing at that bed and that chair, and
      she was very well aware of his glances. She said--"I prefer
      to keep the room as it was."
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jermyn felt his heart give a kind of jerk, but before
      he could make any answer a maid appeared with the tea-tray.
      It was arranged before the fire between them, and Mrs. St.
      George's precise hands became occupied with its contents.
      Her eyes looked less blue; almost they were the eyes of an
      old woman, dulled and dimmed. She seemed to have lost some
      of her cold, staring self-confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--these servants!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl had forgotten the sugar, and the voice of Clara
      St. George betrayed an unexpected querulousness. Old Jermyn
      was startled. Never before had he discovered querulousness
      in her. Always she had been so decisive and so sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up and rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now that the war is over--we forget things. There will be
      a regular stampede to forget certain things. But not
      sugar--as a rule."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face remained chilled and peevish.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's no gratitude," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is gratitude?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His jocund eyes challenged her with whimsical kindness, but
      she was away wandering in her own sleety world, and when
      the maid came in she spoke to her with a kind of absent
      curtness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sugar--Thomas."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl's face was sullen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Holy Christopher!" thought old Jermyn, "will this woman
      never learn how to ask for sugar, or how to get it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He sipped his tea, and thought of Alex, and wondered
      whether his sister-in-law would speak of her son and of
      that little ménage down at Shelford. Why couldn't she let
      things out, loosen the girdle? These matriarchal women! And
      to his surprise she did let things out, but only certain
      things, and she let them out in her own way. She was
      falsely frank. She still persisted in twisting the
      realities. She made a display of being impersonal, and
      behind it her personal persistence loomed like a stark
      white cliff.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said: "I realize that Alex must explore the
      alternatives. I'm allowing him that. I dare say you have
      heard a good deal. I would rather not discuss the
      possibilities. Men are such creatures of impulse. Sex--you
      know. It has always seemed to me so--so very unpleasant.
      One would have preferred to have saved him the experiment."
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jermyn stirred his tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My God, woman," he thought; "what is life but an
      experiment?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he left her he went back to his club and sat in a
      chair in the silent, sombre library and looked out at the
      green lilacs and the budding plane-trees in the Carlton
      gardens. He had brought away with him an impression of
      Clara St. George that was like a thin perfume clinging to
      his consciousness, an unpleasant perfume. He sniffed it
      reflectively. Like many other scents, it evoked memories,
      suggestions, associations of ideas in time and place. It
      led him towards the inwardness of that lonely woman, and in
      the dimness he thought that he could distinguish her
      fundamental outlines. Yes, she was like a fundamentalist
      driven to the last ditch, incapable of surrender or of
      compromise, still furiously determined to dominate and to
      possess. She would hurl all the old and the new
      invectives--"Heretic"--"Blasphemer"--"Atheist"--"Corrupter
      of Youth"--"Materialist"--"Free
      Lover"--"Anarchist"--"Bolshevist." She wanted to see all
      newness fail, to censor it off the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Jove! that's it," he thought; "she's waiting to see
      these young things fail. She's praying for them to fail.
      She's watching for their little ship to split upon the
      rocks."
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jermyn was sure of it. It was to be her show or
      nobody's. Her hands were ready to clutch and to hold. The
      little ship of youth might founder. Perhaps there would be
      a cry for help, perhaps not. But she would be there, ready
      to pounce upon her opportunity. It might be that she would
      regain control, or a kind of control that would satisfy her
      egotism. She might be able to humiliate those other women.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, she was like the rest of them, the popes, the priests,
      the academic people, the little prigs of schoolmasters. She
      wanted to cry--"My show, hands off it," and to make of her
      "show" a little state religion or a professional monopoly.
      She wanted to play Joshua. She wanted to take life and
      youth and to suppress in them all those vital and insurgent
      forces that boil upwards, and while doing it to assume that
      the right and the duty were wholly hers. All other people
      were poisonous charlatans, outsiders, frequenters of
      swill-tubs. She had the eyes of the wilfully blind. She
      refused to look into the streets or the dormitories or the
      kitchen or the workshop. She was like your supersurgeon who
      has no use for anything but to cut it out. She would have
      removed sex as she would have removed the vermiform
      appendix.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jermyn stretched out his legs, and tweaked the knees of
      his trousers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it was essential that Kitty's little enterprise should
      not fail. It must not fail. For youth goes over the top and
      carries the lines of the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dash it," he said to himself; "didn't Clara give him a
      body when she bore him? And aren't our bodies
      as--inevitable--as our souls? Man might be as essentially
      clean as the animals--but for the repressionists. Paul, and
      all the pedagogues, and the academic prigs! For ever
      messing about with gloved fingers, and holding their noses,
      and sprinkling things with disinfectants. Makes me think of
      those stuffy old sick-rooms when they used to shut all the
      windows and splash carbolic about. We may not have the
      Victorian's moral drive--whatever that was--but hang it--I
      do think we're more honest."
    </p>

    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      But in his study of the fundamentalist in Mrs. St. George
      old Jermyn had not exhausted her possibilities, or got
      quite to the root of things. His reading of her was
      incomplete, which was not surprising, for Clara St. George
      was realizing tendencies--cravings in herself that were
      unexpected.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was rather like a woman in her nightdress walking about
      a cold and empty house at three o'clock in the morning. She
      was realizing the house's emptiness, the thinness of the
      garment that she wore, and the impersonal deadness of the
      furniture. Possibly she had knocked her shins against sharp
      edges. But the chill was upon her, a human shiver, a
      gradual appreciation of the fact that she was alone,
      utterly alone, and that no one would come to her. She might
      cry out and ring bells, but the house would remain empty
      and silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had insisted on living in this house in her own way,
      like a schoolmistress, and youth had fled from it. She was
      not wanted. She was not necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, she was waiting for Kitty to fail; she prayed--if
      prayer is selfish desire--for those two young things to
      fail. She was ready to do anything that might force them
      upon the rocks. She wanted to see youth helpless and at her
      mercy, because--in her cold and chilly craving--she wanted
      youth back in her house. She was face to face with that
      most ghastly of ghosts, that is also the most terrifying of
      realities--the knowledge that she was necessary to no one.
    </p>
    <p>
      For then--a woman suddenly feels old, and hears in her
      empty house footsteps--other footsteps. Death is on the
      stairs.

    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, old Jermyn went down to Shelford and saw his
      young things at work. Shelford had grown green. Trees threw
      flickering green reflections upon the river; the horizon,
      deep with the year's mystery, seemed to gather about youth
      and its doings like the trees of a wood. Fruit blossom
      dropped on the grass. Red tulips stood jaunty and straight,
      and wallflowers let their perfume drift over the blue of
      the myosotis. The buds were big on the vine, Old Jermyn
      felt warmed by the sun. Always--at this season of the year
      when the cuckoo began to call he would think of old Chaucer
      and the Pilgrims--"When April with his showres soote."
      Silly old cuckoo, beloved cuckoo! Why quarrel with the
      ingenious and questionable proclivities of the bird? Things
      happen because they happen. Why go about like a little
      fussy old maid of a schoolmaster trying to rap life over
      the knuckles with a ruler? "The cuckoo is a reprehensible
      and unsocial bird, my boys. Don't ask about the egg. Eggs
      are products that should interest us only at the
      breakfast-table. All other eggs are addled. They
      are--because I say so."
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jermyn chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found young Alex blowing toots on a clarinet. He had
      bought a clarinet. He was practising on it, preparing for
      ragtime. Also, he had a drum and a pair of cymbals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty was unpacking crockery, those cream-coloured cups and
      saucers and plates with red cherries on them, fit for any
      blackbird to peck at.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jermyn became absorbed into the adventurousness of Vine
      Cottage. Stay to lunch? Of course he would. He was going to
      stay all day. He sat and tapped Alex's drum, while Alex
      attempted a fox-trot on the clarinet, and did not attempt
      it so badly. But the dance-pavilion was the Hall of the
      gods, with its white walls and green treillage and purple
      curtains, and its brown border to its polished floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's one of my jobs--polishing," said Alex; "I trundle
      up and down in my chair with a polishing mop."
    </p>
    <p>
      Old George was sent to fetch the gramophone with its big
      green trumpet. The music was turned on. Old Jermyn
      slithered a few steps, and then caught hold of Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Uncle hasn't danced for years."
    </p>
    <p>
      He bobbed up and down with Kitty, bending his knees in the
      old style, his jocund eyes dancing also in his very red
      face. He got out of breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Jove!" he said--"By Jove! Silly old cuckoo!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything was shown to him, and everything explained. Old
      Jermyn had an eye for colour and for atmosphere; at one
      period of his life he had collected pictures--English
      water-colours--and he suggested that he should like to get
      a glimpse of Shelford and of Vine Cottage from the river.
      Kitty's punt and a skiff were lying at the new
      landing-stage that Old George and his jobbing friend had
      erected, and Kitty took Mr. Jermyn out in the skiff, for
      she still felt amateurish when handling a punt-pole. She
      sculled well into mid-stream, and kept the skiff in
      position with an occasional movement of the sculls. Mr.
      Jermyn, with the rudder-lines under his arms, surveyed Vine
      Cottage and its garden. The yellow umbrellas had been
      erected and the green and white tables arranged as for a
      dress rehearsal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We like our colour instant and vivid, my dear, these days.
      You've got it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's Alex," she said; "I should have gone wrong with the
      umbrellas and the curtains. He and Old George--our
      man--have been working out colour schemes for the garden.
      That's our shop window--you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," and old Jermyn twirled one of the rudder-lines
      like a boy swinging a chestnut on a string; "you have to
      catch the eye, and you do. The red brickwork of the
      cottage, and the green sweep of the grass. The yellow dots
      of the umbrellas. And then--your dance-room, black and
      white with its touches of purple and green, under the
      massive green of these old chestnuts. You catch the eye at
      once--and please it. What about the garden?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Red geraniums and lobelia in great splashes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My word! That's--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So Alex says--Victorian. But there are reasons. You want
      something vivid, he says, and as Old George says--something
      that goes on blooming. It is going to cost us rather a lot,
      but Old George is raising the lobelia in a little house he
      has--George is a treasure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you going to have a board up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, by the chestnuts. And two other boards, one above and
      one below the village. I've arranged that. Alex's idea.
      'Come and dance at Kitty's.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jermyn nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Row me down-stream--a little way, will you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She sculled him as far as Shelford Park, where the
      beech-trees were coming into leaf, and Mr. Jermyn's dark
      eyes glanced hither and thither, but he remembered to
      steer. The river seemed to swell like soft and liquid
      glass, and he felt the sun warm on his knees, and heard a
      cuckoo calling in the green valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "England," he thought, "and these young English, the new
      English--God bless them!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he asked Kitty a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about the band?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She sculled gently, her eyes on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are doing the best--we can. Alex is so keen--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The band's important--very. You know how picksome people
      are. And your show--must be--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes seemed to darken a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We've talked it over. We could hire a piano. Alex would
      have liked a piano and violin, and he could vamp in with
      the drum and cymbals, and a banjo or clarinet.
      But--then--you see--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here," said old Jermyn, twiddling a rudder-line; "you
      ought to have a real good little band for week-ends. The
      gramophone might do for casual people on other days.
      Suppose I supply a piano fellow and a violinist for the
      season. I dare say I could get hold of them in town, and
      they would have to come down and practise with Alex--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled at her shrewdly under his white eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean it--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      She let her right scull float, and held out a hand to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are the only one of the family--who seems to
      understand--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear--I'm not to be thanked. This show of yours isn't
      an ordinary show. It's--"
    </p>
    <p>
      His thin old hand grasped her young one,
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's--a bit of heroism."

      There were moments when Alex sat in his chair in the
      garden, and forgot his paint-brush or his ragtime, and
      allowed his thoughts and glances to wander where they
      pleased. The world had changed for him, not only because
      the sun shone strenuously during those May days, but
      because he was different and saw things differently. For
      fear had gone out of him, the fear that makes a man
      restless and furtive, and too talkative or too silent. His
      eyes seemed to have sunk back into his head. Kitty had
      noticed what she would have described as the deepening of
      his eyes. He looked at the world about him as though he
      could look at it calmly and without hurry, and like a child
      whose confidence has been restored, and who has learnt to
      know that the voices of the interferers and the
      repressionists will not be raised to spoil his game. There
      was no schoolmaster to cry, "St. George, what are you
      doing? Wasting your time! Stand up and construe this
      passage." He had a curious feeling of having found himself,
      the intimate, real self that had been hiding in shrubberies
      and dark corners. Or, he had been playing a game of
      hide-and-seek with the world, and Kitty had run out from
      somewhere and caught him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a new sense of security. This little world was so
      real--real grass, real water, real trees and flowers. He
      had begun to love it, both as a child and as a man. All the
      details of life had become so full of absorbing interest,
      of adventures, ingenuities, triumphs, little excitements.
      It was an adventure to discover some way of doing a thing
      that had appeared impossible, especially with such a
      fellow-enthusiast as Kitty, who made him feel that she was
      saying--"Boy, that's splendid." Even his love had changed.
      It seemed to grow more deep and wide-eyed during that month
      of May; it was unashamed devotion, a turning of the face to
      the beloved, to a little woman who seemed so warm and wise
      and steadfast that he was full of a devout wonder. He did
      not ask himself how or why it was possible; he lived with
      the consciousness that it was possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, she was such a little bit of mischief. She didn't
      bore a fellow, or make him feel foolish. She liked doing
      things, and getting them done. Her eyes might look love,
      but, by George!--that bobbed head of hair of hers was crisp
      with common sense. She was a young woman who would not be
      afraid to smack her baby. She had no cant.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there--was the river. In other days Alex had thought of
      the river--well--as the river, a generalized stretch of
      water, something that flowed, or upon which you floated.
      His acceptance of life had been as casual and as
      superficial as his acceptance of the river, but now he was
      sitting beside the river day by day, and discovering in it
      all manner of moods and variations, its changing sheens and
      flecks of colour and rufflings and responses. Its mood
      seemed infinite. Its life had a mysterious subtle texture,
      and yet always it was the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      It taught him to observe, to infer, to question, and to
      think. It persuaded him to float, not upon a flux of
      daydreams, but upon a river of reality. He felt that he was
      beginning to know a little, and to know himself in knowing
      it. It suggested life, the flow of experiences, reactions,
      impressions which make up consciousness. In looking at the
      river he began to look into the mirror of his own
      consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He discovered strange reflections, or reflections that
      seemed strange because of their freshness. He saw Kitty.
      She was like a big burr of yellow light, a kind of central
      radiance. He saw his mother--a thin and broken and wavering
      image, disturbed and disturbing. And in a vague way he
      began to see himself as he had been and as he was, and also
      his relation to other things. That is to say he was
      discovering "values," a word that he had picked up from an
      article in a magazine and which he had adopted. It sufficed
      him for the moment. Also--the "real," though when he tried
      to define the "real" he found himself in difficulties. All
      that he could say was that some conditions, feelings,
      impressions were more vivid and satisfying than others. The
      present seemed to him so much more real than the past.
      There seemed to him to be a film of unreality overlying his
      schooldays, and his Oxford days. What was it? A film of
      convention? The unreflecting acceptance of a scheme, an
      order, a class mood? He had been a shadow at school, or
      perhaps--an automaton. There had been the proper thing to
      do and to say, the correct clothes to wear. Always there
      had been repression. If you were sensitive and queer, and
      you wanted to play a game of your own, then you were an
      outsider, contending against some social cult. And the
      upholders of the cult crushed you.
    </p>
    <p>
      But here--at Shelford--playing this new game of life, he
      felt exquisitely free. Yes, in spite of his useless legs.
      Even a minus quantity appeared to have its value! Or was it
      that the something that you hadn't, inspired you to make
      more use and to obtain more delight from the something that
      you had? Your mind was free. Yes, he felt the intimate "I"
      of himself to be far freer. It had not been free at school,
      or at Oxford, or during the war. Always there had been--the
      repressionists. The world called it discipline. But was not
      the only discipline worth having that which you learnt to
      impose upon yourself, not the cult of a caste, but a way of
      life that was good for you, because it was good for you and
      for the people who mattered? He knew that if he hurt Kitty
      he would hurt himself. That was the beginning of his
      morality, or his religion. Not to refrain from doing a
      certain thing because the eternal schoolmaster orders you
      not to do it, but to find out for yourself why it should
      not be done. To forget the schoolmaster and to become
      yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes he talked of these matters to Kitty, but Kitty
      was more interested in the concrete than in the abstract.
      She not only wanted to hit her ball, but to hit it in the
      right way, and Mrs. Sarah had been an admirable
      instructress. Theories of life did not appeal to her as did
      the practice of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've got to run your own show."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was so full of frank--"I don't know"--or "Does it
      matter?" that Alex was forced to meet her on practical
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how did you learn things? You seem to have such a
      sense of value."
    </p>
    <p>
      She would look at him with her steady, fearless eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Learn things--? Well, from mother mostly. Or worried them
      out myself. Doesn't one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But--at school--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--at school--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She appeared to retain a sturdy contempt for the school
      that had educated her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When you see the necessity--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Necessity--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A piece of plate glass between you and something in the
      shop window you want. Nothing like that for setting your
      wits working. Was there anything at school you wanted--so
      badly--that you--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only--to get out of the class-room--mostly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Same here. Holidays were the times when I learnt
      things--the things that are of use. Mother would let me
      help in the shop. And I used to puddle about in the
      kitchen. And when you make a horrid sticky mess of your
      first cake--and try to eat it! Mother ate a slice of
      mine--Jolly sporting of her. And after that--I had to
      conquer cake-making--or--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Die--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not quite die--my dear; have indigestion."
    </p>
    <p>
      Always--they returned to the practical, though to a woman
      the doing of things may be symbolical, and Kitty--the
      utilitarian--might also be Kitty a pragmatical mystic. She,
      too, could stand and look down into the still water and see
      herself and Alex in it, but for the moment the thing that
      mattered was their show. You could not build nests in the
      air. Foundations. And after the foundations--elaborations.
      But she could understand the pathos of Alex's paralyzed
      legs, and applaud with tenderness his creating of a new
      mobility both of mind and of body. But would he always be
      paralyzed like this? Was it final? She had tackled Dr.
      Drake on the subject, and Dr. Drake's replies were guarded.
      "I'm watching him--I'm not quite sure--yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Vine Cottage showed great activity. Mr. Jermyn
      had found his musicians, ex-soldiers both of them, the
      pianist a little monkey of a fellow with an artificial leg,
      the violinist a tall fair boy who smiled whenever the
      violin was tucked under his chin. They came down to
      Shelford to practise together. A hired piano had been
      installed in the dance-pavilion, and here Alex and his two
      assistants made music. They combined well. At the end of
      the week they were playing with dash and devilry, the
      ruffle-headed pianist bumping up and down in his chair, the
      violinist giving little jerks and swayings, Alex beating
      syncopations on his drum and breaking in with cymbals or
      banjo or clarinet. He had a very nice sense of time.
      Also--he had a voice--and would indulge in bursts of song.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Plenty of devil--you chaps."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes Kitty would come in and try steps and judge the
      speed of their playing, and whenever she appeared Alex's
      band seemed to whip itself up for a spurt. Ragtime drifted
      alluringly over the river. Old George bedding out geraniums
      now that all danger of frost had passed, found himself
      showing a tendency to prod the earth with his trowel in
      time to the music. It was a merry noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Kitty had found her strong girl--strong, but deft and
      comely--to help with the teas. They were to wear black,
      with jade-green aprons, black stockings and green shoes.
      Details mattered. And in a meadow above and in a meadow
      below Shelford men were erecting two big white boards
      facing the river--"Come and dance at Kitty's. Look for the
      Yellow Umbrellas."
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelford gossiped not a little. It was critical and it
      shook a head. "That young woman at Vine Cottage--Dances?
      Where are the people to come from? She ought to have tried
      this trick up at Maidenhead." Most of them were more or
      less sure that the young woman would fail, though she had a
      paralyzed husband to keep. Plucky of her--no doubt. But
      Shelford proposed to grant her one season, and at the end
      of it there would be yellow umbrellas for sale.

      Meanwhile, in Mayfair Mrs. Sarah and old Jermyn were
      conspiring together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah had put up a notice in her shop, and above it a
      coloured poster that she had found someone to paint for

      other people having tea under a yellow umbrella.

      But Mrs. Sarah was more potent and persuasive than her
      poster. She entangled quite a number of her old patrons and
      talked them into sympathetic attention. Kitty was a plucky
      little beggar--by Jove! A paralyzed husband, an ex-officer!
      Yes, certainly--these two young things deserved
      encouragement. "Well, be a dear, and do it," was Mrs.
      Sarah's refrain. Also, accepting a hint, she made Alex draw
      a large-sized map of Shelford, showing the exact position
      of "Kitty's," and how to get there. It gave you the route
      by train, by river, and by road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jermyn--too--had his circle. Had he been a bore his
      circle might have resented his activities, but when old
      Jermyn said that a thing was good you had a feeling that it
      was good. He had a reputation. He was a complete worldling.
      He got hold of young this and young that, and he did not
      neglect the female element. "You make young Tom Somebody
      drive you down to Shelford. Good floor, good band. Quite an
      original sort of show. An ex-officer--with no legs--playing
      the drum."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Sarah and old Jermyn went beyond instigation. That
      first Saturday was to be the dramatic day. Not only must
      your shop have its window dressed, but it must be full of
      people. Start a crowd to attract a crowd. Play upon the
      imitativeness of the human animal. Persuade people to
      exclaim--"I say--that's a posh show. Look how it's going!
      Come along, let's cut in."
    </p>
    <p>
      So, they conspired together. Mr. Jermyn chartered a
      motor-launch, and invited a dozen people to fill it. There
      was to be champagne on the launch. Mrs. Sarah booked three
      large cars, and made up a party, and it was no
      undistinguished party either: it included a baronet and a
      young old major-general. Another score or so of
      sympathizers had promised to go by road or river. But Mrs.
      Sarah did not lay too pronounced an emphasis upon sympathy.
      She hinted very broadly that there was value at Shelford,
      and good value.

    <p>
      Old Jermyn was writing a letter. He sat at the large,
      square writing-table in the centre of the smoking-room at
      "Hackett's," and scratched away with a quill pen between
      pauses that suggested that the letter upon which he was
      engaged was something of a poser. He had made three
      attempts and each time a sheet had been crumpled up by a
      lean hand and dropped in the wastepaper basket beside him.
      He made nervous, fidgety movements, much to the annoyance
      of another member who was at work on the other side of the
      table. What was the matter with J. G.? Why couldn't he get
      that letter finished, and stop his scratchings and his
      fidgetings?
    </p>
    <p>
      After dropping the third crumpled paper ball into the
      wastepaper basket Jermyn got up, crossed the room, and rang
      the bell. He stood thinking, and softly tweaking his long
      nose. Should he write that letter or should he not? What
      were his motives in writing it? O--confound his motives--he
      would write it! After all--it was giving the woman a human
      opening, and if she chose to take it--well and good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thompson's brass buttons glittered in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bring me a glass of sherry, Thompson."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      With the glass of sherry beside him on the table old Jermyn
      attacked for the fourth time. He blew his nose vigorously
      into a silk handkerchief, a trumpet sound that compelled
      his vis-à-vis to stare at him truculently. The scratchings
      recommenced.
    </p> 
    <blockquote>
      "DEAR CLARA--<br>
      <br>
      "Alex and his wife are giving their first show on Saturday
      week. I have chartered a launch to take a party down to add
      to the gaiety of the send-off. I shall be delighted if you
      will join my party. May I say that our appearance will be
      of the nature of a surprise.<br>
      <br>
      "If you should decide to join us I will let you know the
      final arrangements later. We shall probably train or drive
      to Hampton, and pick up the launch there.<br>
      <br>
      "Sincerely yours.<br>
      <br>
      "JERMYN."
    </blockquote> 
    <p>
      He closed the envelope, purchased a stamp from Thompson,
      and dropped the letter in the club letter-box. His attitude
      towards it was from that moment one of "I wonder?" He was
      giving Clara St. George her chance gracefully to hold out a
      human hand. But would she do it? Did she wish to do it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Her reply came to him at the club next day. He read it,
      standing by one of the windows overlooking Pall Mall. She
      refused. She gave no reasons for her refusal, and she did
      not thank him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jermyn tore up the letter, and crossing the room,
      deposited the pieces in a wastepaper basket. He walked back
      to the window, and rattling the keys in his pocket, looked
      down at the traffic in Pall Mall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a pity," he thought, "that some backs won't bend."
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Monday of that particular week Alex suddenly became
      interested in weather reports, though the glass stood at
      fair and the sun climbed daily out of the east into a
      cloudless sky. Very early there would be a white mist
      covering the river and the meadows, and from his bed Alex
      could watch the gold-green tops of the poplars on the
      farther bank catching the sun's rays while the river and
      the meadows remained dew-drenched and grey. He woke very
      early, and lay on his back--thinking, and waiting for Old
      George to come and help him dress, and get him into his
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first question would be--"What do you think of the
      weather, George? Going to last?"
    </p>
    <p>
      George was a cautious prophet. Did not Henley Regatta
      always produce rain? Also--when the local committee had
      fixed the date of the Shelford Flower Show you could
      prepare to get out your umbrella.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Looks all right, sir, at present."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must be fine on Saturday, George."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope it will be, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on the Tuesday morning that Old George asked that
      most innocent of questions. He was helping Mr. Alex on with
      his trousers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How many people do you expect on Saturday, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O!" said Alex, "it will only be the first day, you know.
      One can't expect--"
    </p>
    <p>
      But that question of Old George's, and his own vaguely
      apologetic reply to it, seemed to open before Alex a vista
      of the absurd and the impossible. It was the beginning of a
      panic mood, a mood that he tried to conceal most carefully
      from Kitty. How many people--indeed! Would there be any
      people? And as his panic mood enlarged itself he began to
      think of Shelford as an obscure and potty little place
      miles from anywhere, a place to which no one would come. He
      shivered at the thought of Shelford's obscurity and its
      isolation. Vine Cottage and its dance-pavilion and its
      garden full of tables and its yellow umbrellas seemed to
      diminish and grow dim, until it was no larger and more
      convincing than a little reflection seen in the polished
      bowl of a spoon. The great adventure shrivelled to an
      absurdity. He and his band! He could hear himself tooting
      away on his clarinet, like some sedulous fool piping in the
      middle of a ploughed field. Preposterous optimists--! With
      all their little capital buried in a garden on the banks of
      the Thames, while a voice cried in the wilderness--"O, come
      and dance, do--come and dance."
    </p>
    <p>
      That was Alex's cry. He would trundle out in his chair, and
      make a tour of the whole property, and scrutinize all their
      little stock-in-trade, with an eagerness that tried to
      convince itself that the adventure was not impertinent and
      absurd. He became exquisitely worried over seeming
      omissions and deficiencies. What a pity the wallflowers
      were over! And those confounded geraniums would not be in
      bloom. And he couldn't hurry them up. Couldn't Old George
      put out something or other--pansies--? He grew fussy about
      the dancing-floor; he spent hours in the place, polishing
      with his mop. He worried about the band. Supposing either
      Banks or Summervell fell sick at the last moment, or missed
      a train, or left the violin in the luggage-rack?
    </p>
    <p>
      He made sudden panicky discoveries.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say, we've forgotten that people might come in cars."
    </p>
    <p>
      They had, for their eyes had been fixed on the river, so
      pasteboard was obtained, and Alex printed
      notices--"Entrance"--"This way to Kitty's"--"Dance Teas,"
      and Old George was instructed to post up these notices on a
      bracket and on the outer face of the garden door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as to provisions? How many loaves of bread, and how
      many cakes?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going to prepare for two dozen people, boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty-four people! It seemed a vast number. Were there
      twenty-four people in all England who would take it into
      their heads to drop out of the sky upon the green grass of
      Vine Cottage? It was unbelievable, and yet Kitty had a
      calm, go-ahead face. He marvelled at her phlegm, or at what
      he took to be her phlegm, for he had not divined the fact
      that Kitty was as worried as he was. She, too, had her own
      particular secret panic. Yet her little round face seemed
      to lose none of its glowing solidity. At meals they talked
      with every appearance of cheerfulness. They played up to
      each other and to the spirit of the adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course--one can't expect--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not the first day--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We've got to wave a flag and make a cheerful noise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's it. We'll keep playing all the afternoon. I'll
      thump that drum, Kit. But Mrs. Sarah and Corah--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There'll be Uncle Jermyn--too--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He forced a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They'll have to go on eating teas all the afternoon if no
      one else comes. But--of course--"
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Thursday evening, after supper, she missed him. She
      had washed up and put the cups and plates away, but instead
      of helping her as he usually did, he had wheeled his chair
      out into the garden. She looked out of the window, and saw
      the afterglow dying along the river and the trees growing
      black, and the green of the grass changing to grey. The
      stillness of the sky seemed reflected in the stillness of
      the river, and as she looked through the glass of the
      window at the glassy water she felt suddenly and poignantly
      alone. She was alone. But at the age of five-and-twenty
      youth will not allow or does not realize that there is a
      loneliness that is complete and individual. She wanted to
      snuggle up to some warm human thing, her mate. She felt
      tired, chilled, a little afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went out into the garden, calling "Alex." He did not
      answer her, and in the silence and the stealth of the dusk
      she too grew silent. She went softly like a sturdy little
      disembodied spirit--if one can conceive of a disembodied
      spirit being sturdy. She looked behind the laurel hedge,
      and along the grassy slope, but it was close under the
      overhanging blackness of the big chestnut trees that she
      found him. He was sitting in his chair within a yard of the
      river, staring at it. Even in the dusk his glance had a
      strange fixity.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not utter a word. She went and knelt down beside
      the chair, and put her arm round him. She wanted his arm
      round her. She wanted to feel--
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned and looked down at her. Their faces were very
      close in the dusk, and for the first time in his life he
      divined something of Kitty, of the woman, of that warm
      courage that burns bravely and then suddenly grows dim. Her
      eyes were downcast, hidden. And it seemed to him that she
      was bending under some burden of loneliness, or of some
      unexpressed and inexpressible distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kit--I've been thinking--"
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly he put both arms round her head and held it
      close.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've been thinking. It's going to be all right. I don't
      know why, but it is--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She pressed her face against his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, Alex, O--my dear! We've got each other, haven't we?"
    </p>
    <p>

      On the morning of the great day Alex woke at five. He had
      asked to have the blind left up and the curtains undrawn,
      and sitting up in bed he saw the river shimmering and the
      poplars painted with sunlight as though some one had
      streaked them with a mighty brush. The day was fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Confound those legs of his! He wanted to be up and about;
      he would have liked a plunge and a swim; but since such
      activities were impossible he lay on his back and listened
      for the first sound of Kitty's movements in the room above.
      She too, would be early, and Old George was coming at seven
      instead of at eight to cut the grass and give the garden a
      final polish. Friday had been a day of excitements, for by
      the first post a letter had arrived from Mrs. Sarah in
      which she had advised Kitty to prepare teas for three dozen
      people. "Better be on the safe side. I'm bringing one or
      two friends myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      But busy as that Saturday morning proved it gathered an
      atmosphere of naive solemnity, as though someone were going
      to be married or buried early in the afternoon. Kitty and
      her girl were busy in the kitchen cutting bread and butter,
      and arranging plates of cakes, and polishing crockery, and
      assembling a small regiment of teapots--each pot prepared
      with a charge of tea. Milk-jugs stood in a row on the
      kitchen dresser. There were thirty-six plates of cakes,
      fancy cakes and good plum cake; the whole place seemed to
      overflow with cake, and the shop counter was pressed into
      service. You could not arrange dishes on the floor. Old
      George was mowing and sweeping and trimming verges, and
      bending down to pull up odd weeds. Alex spent an hour
      polishing the dance-floor, and at the end of that
      operation, finding nothing else to do, he trundled all over
      the place in his chair looking for stray untidinesses, odd
      shavings or scraps of paper, or the cigarette-ends
      distributed at large by the jobbing carpenter.
    </p>
    <p>
      By twelve o'clock everything was shipshape. The yellow
      umbrellas were up; a dozen or more tables with white cloths
      were decorated with cherry-splashed plates and cups and
      saucers. Kitty had inspected each teaspoon. Old George had
      gone home to put on his Sunday clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tension relaxed. The excitement--denied further outward
      activity--was driven inwards--and looked restlessly out of
      two pairs of eyes--and disorganized completely two young
      people's appetite for lunch. Every table and shelf and
      chair in the cottage appeared to be occupied by dishes of
      cakes and of bread and butter. Teapots possessed the
      scullery table, and Kitty was frowning inwardly over the
      capacity of her kettles to supply sufficient hot water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The midday meal was perfunctory and disjointed, a
      fragmentary affair. They ate it in the shop off the top of
      a packing-case; the meal consisted of sardines, and bread
      and cheese and tea. Neither Alex nor his wife had any
      appetite.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kept glancing at his wrist-watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Those chaps ought to be here."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was thinking of the musicians, while Kitty was concerned
      about her kettles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope there won't be a rush. If Annie gets flustered."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet neither of them could believe in the chances of a rush.
      That sense of haste and of suspense crowded itself into the
      feeling of emptiness that possessed their two interiors.
    </p>
    <p>
      At half-past one Kitty rushed up to dress, to change her
      blue linen for black crêpe and a jade-green apron, black
      silk stockings, and green shoes. Alex was dressed. He took
      himself and his chair out into the garden, steering his way
      past dishes of cake. He arrived in the shade of one of the
      yellow umbrellas. It felt very hot--somehow, and he kept
      wiping his hands in a very clean handkerchief. The river
      was as empty as a road in the suburbs at eight o'clock on a
      Sunday morning. Not a boat! But where were Banks and
      Summervell? Surely the fellows had not missed their train?
      And Old George ought to be back from his dinner. Confound
      it--how hot it was!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Kitty appeared, looking cool and pink and most
      astonishingly pretty. She had a vividness--a something, and
      Alex gave his chair a turn, and looked up at her out of
      very wide eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say--you look--ripping--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him a queer little drifting smile, and touched his
      cheek with the fingers of her left hand. "No boats--yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not one--damn them!"
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      Whole hours seemed to pass before anything in the shape of
      a boat appeared upon the river. Had the whole of London and
      Suburbia gone dry?
    </p>
    <p>
      The first boat that came into view roused them to a
      tremulous yet restrained excitement. The orchestra had
      arrived, and was making desultory and musical noises in the
      pavilion. Kitty stood by Alex's chair. They watched that
      boat. It was a double sculler, with two female figures in
      the stern; it came slothfully up past the ferry; the
      sculling was not very good; two stoutish backs clad in
      Oxford shirts swung sedulously. One of the scullers wore a
      floppy white canvas hat; the other was bald.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--my God!" said Alex.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat had drawn level with Vine Cottage, and two elderly
      men resting on their sculls stared across the water at
      "Kitty's." Their faces seemed to express nothing but hot
      vacancy. The two women--
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, my God," said Alex again, very softly, "uncles and
      aunts!"
    </p>
    <p>
      That boat was a shock to them. It picked up its sculls and
      went plodding seriously on. It seemed to leave ripples of
      incipient discouragement behind it, a Noah's ark of a boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty rearranged the cups on one of the tables.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They can't--all--be like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Like water-beetles oaring themselves upon the stippled
      silver of the river came other boats, boats in which prewar
      blazers and gay jumpers and light blouses reintroduced the
      world to colour. Punts--too--full of red and white and blue
      cushions, and casual and reclining youth poled lazily
      along. They came and gazed and passed, though now and again
      a boat or a punt would seem to pause and falter, and a man
      and a girl would exchange a word or two. "Hallo--dancing!"
      But though the lure was dangled, it was neither compelling
      nor complete. And Kitty stood beside one of her tables
      under the great plane-tree, and heard Alex's band strike
      up. Clash--bang! A merry noise. But she looked at those
      occasional people paddling or poling by, and wished herself
      a tyrant, a little empress, or a giantess who could reach
      out a hand and pluck those humans out of their boats and
      thrust them into the dance-house like chickens into a coop.
      "Dance, damn you! Dance in my house." Her little firm chin
      jutted out, and in her eyes was a kind of anger--
    </p>
    <p>
      She went to the pavilion and stood in the doorway. The
      orchestra played ragtime furiously, with drummings and
      clashings. Where was Mrs. Sarah? Where was everybody? And
      suddenly the music ceased, though she did not realize that
      it had ceased until she found Alex in his chair beside her.
      He was pointing; his face was flushed and excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look, it's coming here--That launch."
    </p>
    <p>
      How absurd of her not to have noticed it! But there it was,
      a very white launch with a gilded prow and a Union Jack
      floating from the staff at the stern, leaving diverging
      lines of swell behind it as it made its gradual glide
      towards Kitty's landing-stage. Someone was standing up in
      the launch, a man in a dove-grey coat and white flannel
      trousers, his hat raised above a head of superlative
      whiteness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Uncle Jermyn--! And people--quite a crowd--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The dear!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes ceased to look resentfully at the river. She
      waved.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll go and meet him. Better start up--boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right-o--rather--I should think so. Dear old Jermyn--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty had "Dear old Jermyn" in her eyes as she went down to
      the landing-stage where Old George was ready with a
      boat-hook. The launch was full of faces, smiling faces. Mr.
      Jermyn, still standing, and as much master of the situation
      as though he were a ship's captain and the launch his
      barge, made a circular movement with his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My party--Mrs. Alex St. George. Mrs. Alex St. George--my
      party."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave the whole launch a dispersed smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm Kitty--I'm very glad to see you all. The band's
      playing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had she seen them landed and in progress towards the
      pavilion, and squeezed old Jermyn's fingers, than Mrs.
      Sarah appeared from somewhere with a little crowd of
      followers. Mrs. Sarah was in great spirits. She kissed
      Kitty, and appeared ready to kiss Mr. Jermyn. "O my dear--a
      car had a puncture. But here we are. Not all
      strangers--either. You know Sir Maurice--and General
      Rideout--I--am--enjoying myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a little bewildering, but it was splendid, and
      Kitty--having smiled at everybody, clutched a round
      tea-tray and a consciousness of her duties, and extricating
      herself, rushed in to her kettles. It was essential that
      she should not lose her head or allow the girl Annie to
      lose hers. Dignity, precision, no rushing about as though
      the situation had surprised you. She hoped that Annie was
      not a heavy breather.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All the kettles--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Annie had a placid surface. She had assisted at functions,
      quite creditable functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two are boiling, miss; the other's on the sing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, splendid!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I fill up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait. When they begin to sit down at the tables. Get the
      cakes and the milk and sugar, and the bread and butter out
      first. O--here's mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah had removed her hat, and was unfurling a white
      lace apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm on this job, too, poppet. They're dancing--they're
      dancing already. The band's A1. I pay for all my crowd, you
      know."
    </p>
    <p>
      But before she became absorbed in the serving of teas Kitty
      went down to the dance-house and looked through one of the
      panels of treillage. The orchestra was in full cry; about a
      dozen couples were dancing, and for a moment Kitty had a
      glimpse of her husband sitting in his chair beside the
      piano. He was laughing, head thrown back as he played and
      watched the dancers. The pianist jigged on his stool; the
      tall fair boy with the violin gave little flicks of the
      head, and swaggered with his shoulders. Alex, a drumstick
      in either hand, would lean over and strike a clashing blow
      upon the cymbals, and laugh, and catch the laughing eyes of
      the dancers.
    </p>
    <p>
      She loved him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had such an air of triumph. He was so enjoying the show,
      and his drum and his cymbals. It seemed to delight him to
      see these people dancing, and dancing as though they
      enjoyed it, though he himself would never be able to dance.
      But his youth danced with them, and wished them well. Those
      flickering drumsticks danced on the ass skin. The clash of
      the cymbals urged and challenged and applauded. "Go it--you
      people. Splendid! Life's worth living."
    </p>
    <p>
      She threw a little unseen kiss to him and hurried back to
      her tea-tables. She was happy; yet she was two women in one
      body, and while one of them dealt with teapots and
      hot-water jugs and plates of bread and butter and gave and
      accepted gay patter, the other moved with a kind of inward
      sacramental solemnity. She was the little priestess of the
      show. The yellow umbrellas glowed. The river seemed to
      swell proudly past. Under the great plane-tree the shadows
      lay in a chequer of gold. She saw all her bright tables,
      and the well-dressed people, and heard the music and the
      voices. She saw Mrs. Sarah everywhere, and herself as a
      figure of inward dreaminess, and felt a kind of smooth and
      drowsy rustling of the leaves of her secret soul. Even when
      Old George came to her and, impressively whispering,
      informed her that three other boats had pulled in and that
      he had sold ten more tickets, the words did not seem real.

    </p>
    <p>
      As old Jermyn wrote in his diary--for he was a Pepysian
      soul and kept a diary--"Studying life is like trying to
      study the interior of a room by looking through the
      keyhole. We all squint through keyholes," and when he wrote
      these words he was thinking of Clara St. George, But he did
      not know that on that particular day Mrs. Clara had stooped
      to her keyhole. That it showed her other things than she
      wished to see was neither here nor there. It was a
      surreptitious keyhole, and she might have been discovered
      peering through it had not the people on the other side of
      the door been full of their own affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George ordered out her car on that Saturday
      afternoon, and was driven down to Shelford. Her man had
      orders to park the car under the lime-trees opposite the
      Ship Inn. Mrs. St. George left her car under the young
      green foliage and went upon her way, her way being Shelford
      Lane. She walked as far as Vine Cottage, and saw three
      empty cars drawn up close to the orchard fence, and three
      chauffeurs leaning against the fence, and smoking
      cigarettes. She read the notices posted upon the cottage;
      she heard sounds of music.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Shelford Lane offered her no peephole. Vine Cottage and
      its garden defended itself with a brick wall, and a thick
      thorn hedge, and the old entrance to Bunt's boat-house had
      been boarded up. So Mrs. St. George retraced her steps. She
      did not see herself as Death at the feast--if there was a
      feast. Her surreptitiousness sought to discover the
      fullness or emptiness of the tables. She had come down in
      search of a fiasco. But there was the river; she had
      remembered the river, and on the river her keyhole would be
      a large one. She turned to the left under the lime-trees
      and past red may-trees and golden laburnum pendant over old
      red walls, and found herself at the ferry. A boat to be
      hired? Assuredly. A man in a dirty sweater had three boats
      and a punt idly nosing at the landing-stage. The lady would
      need a boatman? He shouted to a youth who was baling water
      out of a shabby old black punt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Arry, you're wanted."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George took to the river. To the youth's
      question--"Want to go up or down, m'um?" she gave an answer
      that made it appear that she had no particular prejudices.
      "O--up--I think." But she did tell the youth not to hurry
      and to keep well out in the middle of the river, and
      he--having no interest in anything beyond the receipt of a
      possible tip at the end of the excursion, responded to her
      wishes. He looked either at her knees or over one of his
      own shoulders. He may have thought her an unusual person in
      a boat. She did not look like the Thames on a Saturday
      afternoon. She sat there like a gentlewoman driving down
      Piccadilly in the days when gentlewomen sat erect, their
      stays well boned, and with bonnets upon their heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lad did notice that the lady looked somewhat fixedly at
      Vine Cottage and its garden and its dance-house. Here was a
      diversion, something to stare at, and he lay slouching for
      some seconds on his sculls, listening to the music of
      Kitty's orchestra. He made a remark to the lady, referring
      to Kitty as "The young woman whose husband was on officer
      chap who couldn't walk." He added that things seemed a bit
      gay over there, gayer than Shelford had expected them to
      be, but the lady made no reply. She sat there as though he
      had produced no sort of noise that had any meaning for her,
      and he resumed his sculling. It was very hot on the river,
      with a silvery glare stretched like a sheet of silk between
      the green of the trees and fields, and the lady put up a
      dark blue sunshade and held it so that the lad saw nothing
      but the curve of her chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she had seen all that Mr. Jermyn St. George would have
      wished her to see, that gay little garden crowded with
      bright figures, the white launch and the boats lying by the
      bank, the yellow umbrellas, the crowded tables, the vivid
      little dance-house with its movement and its music. Not
      only was Kitty's window dressed, but her shop was full. And
      Mrs. St. George's peephole had showed her a miniature
      brilliant with colour, a green ground stippled with
      success, a little modern <i>fête gallante.</i> Youth
      triumphant or if not quite triumphant, making a brave show.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was sculled on through the glare past the towering
      chestnuts and the meadows beyond where pollarded willows
      shimmered in the heat, and under her blue sunshade her face
      had a staring pallor. Her rigidity was complete. She
      suffered the lad to scull her a quarter of a mile up-stream
      before telling him to turn. She seemed to sit in the midst
      of a stiff and stricken silence, and when again she broke
      that silence the lad had no knowledge of the tremendous
      effort that it cost her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Row close in. I want to see--that dancing."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had to rend those words out of herself. She sat erect,
      holding her sunshade so that her face was hidden, but when
      the boat glided over the green reflection of the
      chestnut-trees, she raised her sunshade very slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop a moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice had a dry breathlessness. She was looking under
      the blue edge of her sunshade into the interior of Kitty's
      dance-house. There was no music for the moment. She saw a
      few girls and men sitting or standing. She saw the piano,
      the violinist raising his bow, Alex in his wheeled chair,
      the drum, the yellow halo of the cymbals. And suddenly her
      son's arms were raised. She saw his upturned laughing face.
      The sticks fell. Clash--bang! Men and girls glided out--
    </p>
    <p>
      She kept her sunshade lowered after that. She told the lad
      to row her back to the ferry. She saw neither Kitty in her
      green apron busy among the tables, nor the stout figure of
      Mrs. Sarah--that impossible woman--She disembarked and paid
      for her boat, and gave the lad a shilling. She went
      straight to her car.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Home."
    </p>
    <p>
      Over Cardigan Square lay the sloth of a Saturday afternoon
      when the plane-trees assume a green silence that is almost
      solid. Houses threw sharp shadows, and overhead a blue sky
      pearled itself with heat. Mrs. St. George's car came to
      rest in the midst of this silence. The chauffeur got down
      and opened the door. She looked at nothing; her blue eyes
      had a peculiar fixed stare. She crossed the pavement like a
      stiff figure propelled on invisible wheels. She ascended
      the steps, and with a rigid deliberation opened her bag and
      took out her latchkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened the door and closed it. She stood in the hall.
      It seemed to her very dark.

      It was nine o'clock when the yellow umbrellas were taken
      in, and the dance-house closed by Mr. Venables, and all the
      tables cleared. The white launch and the cars had departed
      Londonwards two hours ago, and the sun had set, and the
      river was black and still, but gone was its sense of
      emptiness. The scullery table was piled high with crockery
      waiting to be washed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll leave it to-night," said Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sent Annie home. She wanted to be alone with the result
      of the days endeavours, to clasp her bouquet, to bury her
      nose in it. And Alex was still out there in his chair,
      circulating among the tables, and removing tablecloths and
      carefully folding them. She put her hands to her forehead.
      She was both tired and beyond being tired; the secret
      climax of the day throbbed in her; the laughing, kindly
      crowd had gone and left her the day's consummation.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went to the door and felt the cool of the dusk, and a
      freshness as of falling dew.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Boy--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Time for supper. We've earned it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He came trundling towards her over the grass, his lap full
      of folded cloths.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Supper--? O, we'll picnic--I say--Kit, what a day!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran forward and, meeting his chair, stopped it with her
      hands on the wheels, and leaning forward, kissed him. There
      was surprise in her kisses, fragrance, a quality of warmth
      and of abandonment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a day! And no picnic supper--either."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her a little breathlessly, divining in her a
      sudden attack that was more than tenderness. She seemed to
      emit a glow, to exhale a perfume of sweet surrender. Her
      glances were both shy and intimate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How's that?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Uncle Jermyn left a hamper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Champagne and iced salmon--The dear--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a sportsman! Kit--I'm hungry--I'm--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm hungry and I'm thirsty. Boy, let's celebrate. They've
      gone. It's just you and I--"

      At eleven o'clock that night Vine Cottage showed two
      lighted windows towards the river, an upper and a lower
      light, and over the carpet of the upper floor bare feet
      pattered softly. Kitty was in her nightdress, a white and
      filmy thing laced at the elbows and the throat. Two candles
      were burning on the dressing-table, and a little pile of
      clothes lay on a chair. She stood for a minute or two at
      her dressing-table, using a powder puff, but more for the
      perfume of the powder than for the pearling of her skin.
      She powdered her arms, slipping back the laced sleeves. She
      took the stopper from a small cut-glass scent bottle
      containing Parma Violets, and pouring a drop or two into a
      hollowed hand, rubbed the scent into her hair. A little
      lace cap hung on one of the wooden pillars supporting the
      mirror, and she adjusted the cap upon her honey-coloured
      head, patting and pulling it with intimate fingers. She
      slipped her arms into a green chiffon dressing-jacket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deliberately she blew out one of the candles and pulled up
      the blind. The window was open wide. She leaned out with
      her elbows on the sill like a shy, feline thing rubbing
      itself softly against the velvet of the night. The night
      was very dark, but not so dark that she was unable to
      distinguish the details of her property, the dim river
      bounding it, the great plane-tree--a towering and restful
      presence, the white tables, two old fruit trees, a path
      winding between the lawns, three round flower beds, the
      compact blackness of the laurel hedge. A creeper, the
      cottage vine, had pushed young shoots into the opening of
      the window, picking up the light upon the leaves of a lucid
      and transparent greenness. Kitty plucked two of the leaves
      and tucked the stalks under the lace border of her cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      A gesture, imaginative, prettily pagan! Her taking of the
      lighted candle was both more symbolical and more
      purposeful. The upper window grew dark towards the river,
      but as the little white figure descended the stairs,
      lighting itself to that other room, its limbs and body
      might have been seen dimly glowing beneath the texture of
      the crêpe de Chine.

      Nothing stands still, and though Kitty was neither a
      physicist nor a psychologist, she had a feeling that life
      had to go backwards or forwards, up or down. She had a
      sense of dimensions, a native appreciation of all that is
      relative. Your business waxed or waned; your bank balance
      ebbed and flowed; also, she knew, that important as a bank
      balance is, there are considerations that transcend it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manhood, for instance, and childhood, and the sum of the
      reactions that make for the state we call happiness. And
      always you must be chasing or wishing to chase the
      butterfly on the other side of the hedge, or to possess
      yourself of apples that are not yours, but might be. There
      is no standing still. You may pause to get your breath, or
      to realize your inspiration. You may clasp your love, but
      the clasping of it may not make it more yours unless you
      realize that a bosom should give milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the surprising success of their venture became apparent,
      comparative though it might be, and she counted the
      shillings and pence, her attention seemed to shift to
      another problem and to ponder it. She had a pause for quiet
      breathing. She was able to estimate her husband's
      incompleteness, his almost dear incompleteness, full of
      touching and naive expedients though it was. She had to ask
      herself the obvious question. Was she to be content with
      that incompleteness, or to suffer him to be content with
      it?
    </p>
    <p>
      But to begin with--regarding the success of "Kitty's." It
      had its ups and downs during the first few weeks, but like
      the chart of a rising temperature as the peaks grew less
      pronounced, the curve joining troughs and peaks ran at a
      higher level. No doubt the Sabbatarians would have been
      shocked, but on each Sabbath evening Kitty and Alex felt
      moved to gasp and exult and to hug each other. The show was
      succeeding. Touch wood, but it was! And why? But who could
      say? No doubt some half a dozen streams of influence had
      converged to produce the flow. For on four consecutive
      Saturdays Mr. Jermyn St. George and his party had turned up
      in a launch. Mrs. Sarah--too--in a car--with Mr. This or
      Sir Somebody That. The pressure that Mrs. Sarah had been
      able to exert was surprising. When she took a leap her
      ripple marks spread far and wide. Corah too and her
      prospective husband--a brisk fellow earning his fifteen
      hundred a year--touched other circles. But all these
      partial impulses would have been of no lasting account had
      not Kitty's show persuaded the Thames that her show was
      "it."
    </p>
    <p>
      For, in certain cliques it became an accepted opinion that
      "Kitty's" was chic, and therefore the chic thing to do was
      to take a boat or a car and dance there. The show was a
      "posh" one, or whatever topical term you chose to apply to
      it. No doubt there were happy coincidences, a fortunate
      concatenation of circumstances, but had the fruit lacked
      bloom and colour no bird would have come to peck at it. Had
      there been no yellow umbrellas, and indifferent music and a
      bad floor, Alex might have possessed six paralyzed legs,
      and youth would have lingered for an afternoon and
      ruthlessly disposed of him and his bad music. "Poor old
      chap, but an absolute dud with the drum. No earthly--you
      know." Youth would have left it at that, and if Alex did
      not know it, Kitty did. She too was young and she could be
      ruthless, and she used youth and its selfishness and its
      little superficial clevernesses to help her show. She knew
      that certain of the casual young men who came to Shelford
      were Fortunate Youths, young Solesby for instance who had
      the sleekest head and the most unruffled self-assurance of
      any young man about town, and who would let you know what
      was posh and chic and mignon and what wasn't. He happened
      to feel interested for a couple of months in a little woman
      with dark eyes and a devilishly taking head of tawny hair.
      Kitty was smooth to young Solesby and his clique. She knew
      the commercial value of the sort of man who collects women
      or is collected by them. They asked for something unusual,
      a dinner served in a cellar with the waiters dressed as
      sweeps, or a species of Daphne and Chloe show in the
      country where lambs bleated. They served a purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      But chiefly did Kitty rely upon the average man and girl,
      the suburban people who came and saw and danced, and went
      home and told their friends: "There's a jolly little place
      at Shelford." She was wise in the creating of an immediate
      and happy impression. She would find time to go down to the
      landing-stage when a boat pulled in, and meet people with a
      smile and a "Glad to see you." She contrived to create an
      atmosphere of casual and happy friendliness. Her smile
      carried. And behind his drum and cymbals, or while twanging
      his banjo, Alex was no less happy in suggesting
      irresponsible light laughter. He nodded at people, had a
      smile for the new-comers. "That's it, enjoy yourselves."
      Clash, bang! Youth's jazz band would step off with a
      gaillard and joyous swagger. In those days the melancholy
      and mooing saxophone had not produced a universal
      cacophony. And Alex loved his show, and laughed, and people
      laughed with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came a day in July when the lawns and dance-house
      were so crowded that Kitty began to wonder how to control
      her success. There were a dozen cars parked in the lane,
      and boats lay along the bank like horses packed in a
      stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah was down from town. She knew success when she
      saw it, and how to seize the proper moment for a nice
      reaction to circumstance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Raise your price, poppet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But--supposing--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know the tale of a man who bought a warehouse full
      of shirts, and opened a shop, and offered them for sale at
      five and sixpence a shirt?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haven't heard it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He sold some three shirts in a week. Something was wrong,
      obviously. So he reversed the tickets and marked them at
      half a guinea. And trade boomed."
    </p>
    <p>
      So Kitty put up a notice which stated that owing to the
      crowded success of the show the management felt itself
      compelled to raise its prices. In the future the Thé
      Dansant would cost four shillings.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a week she was just a little anxious, but Mrs. Sarah's
      moral of the shirts appeared to apply also to the running
      of a dance-house on the river. The popularity of "Kitty's"
      seemed to increase. It became more "posh" than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, and Alex laughed, and Old George's tips
      increased. He was making very good money, and had invested
      thirty shillings in some new and miraculous cure for his
      wife's chronic rheumatism.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Monday mornings the management of "Kitty's" would sit
      down in the kitchen and check its receipts. At the new rate
      of four shillings the week-end takings were showing an
      average profit of twelve pounds. During the week they were
      netting three or four pounds from casual people who danced
      to the strains of the big. gramophone reinforced by a
      gentler tapping of the drum and cymbals. Three hundred
      pounds or so for the season. But then Mr. Jermyn was
      financing the band!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so bad."
    </p>
    <p>
      They were agreed that it was not so bad, and that the
      re-opening of the shop would be a superfluous impertinence.
      Alex was prejudiced against the shop, for Kitty had enough
      to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there were times when he would wriggle a little in his
      chair, and though he made no moan about it, Kitty was wise
      as to those wrigglings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You always have to sit, boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do wish sometimes I had a spare seat."
    </p>
    <p>
      She commissioned Mrs. Sarah to buy for him the best air
      cushion that could be bought in London.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      But in other respects Kitty's husband was less in need of
      an air cushion. No doubt the conducting of a dance
      orchestra is not a very distinguished occupation for an
      ex-public school boy and an Oxford man, and there were
      plenty of people who agreed with his mother and the
      suppressionists that Alex had lost caste.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Archdeacon of Blandchester was one of the deplorers.
      Man of compromises though he was, he was a great writer of
      letters, and in the columns of <i>The Times</i> or the
      <i>Morning Post</i> he would appeal to the Smythian world
      to deal with the New Paganism or the New Something or Other
      by sitting down heavily upon it. He was not unlike that
      other and more distinguished "Soapy Sam" whom Huxley rent
      so ruthlessly. He wrote sympathetically to Clara St.
      George, appealingly to Alex, reprovingly to old Jermyn, for
      the lights of the dance-house upon the Thames were not to
      be concealed, and Jermyn had helped to light them. Alex
      flushed up hotly over the avuncular letter, and uttered
      youth's cry in the face of the eternal suppressionist--"The
      old hum-bug!" Mr. Jermyn, jocund of eye, took it upon
      himself to reply for both of them, and in his most puckish
      strain.
    </p> 
    <blockquote>
      "MY DEAR SAM,--<br>
      <br>
      "I know that you and your world hold that nothing is sinful
      provided it is not seen. O, yes--you do--my dear fellow,
      though you don't allow it, and though the unseen may be
      concealed under a Bishop's apron. Is it that you object to
      a young man trying to earn his living by beating a drum on
      a Sunday, or is it that you object to all drums other than
      your own particular and private drum--? Etc.--"
    </blockquote> 
    <p>
      But polemics apart, when a man makes a success of some
      human endeavour, even though it be the teaching of a dog to
      waltz, or the persuading of a suppressionist to look at
      life honestly with both eyes, he is better for it, and Alex
      was the better for the successful beating of his drum. He
      had his part in the show, un-Smythian though it might be.
      He sat for hours in a chair and helped to give the world
      something that it asked for, and his self-respect was most
      visibly increased. Kitty was aware of his new texture; it
      showed in his eyes, in the firmer lines of his face. His
      voice--even--had a happier and a stronger resonance. He was
      helping to earn money; he had ceased to suggest to himself
      that he was a poor, parasitical creature with two useless
      legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, such an amelioration was relative. It did not satisfy
      the soul of this practical and sturdy little person who had
      a way of looking ahead and of asking questions. And she was
      asking Dr. Drake the most searching of questions. Why
      this--why that? Was it not possible--?
    </p>
    <p>
      For there were moments when she would look at Alex as a
      mother looks at a crippled child, and furiously refuse to
      believe that his paralysis was final. He was so alive. It
      appeared to her that he had developed amazingly during the
      last three months. He was more of a man than she had ever
      known him to be, and, to her, the word man implied a
      courage that was quiet and inward, patience, good temper, a
      philosophy that had a quick and whimsical smile. He was
      facing realities, the realities of their new young world.
      He was symbolical of youth wounded in the war, raising a
      stricken but laughing head, and uttering the old cry
      "Cheerio. Things might be much worse."
    </p>
    <p>
      But might they not be better?
    </p>
    <p>
      She watched him trundling about in his chair. He had become
      an expert in the handling of that chair, and his various
      ingenuities never failed to rouse in her a feeling of quick
      tenderness. Seeing him there in the garden she would
      sometimes feel moved to cry--"Boy--get up and walk.
      You--can--walk." It was as though her own sturdy vitality
      yearned to leap into his body and to quicken it and to make
      it whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pressed Dr. Drake hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely--there must be something--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Drake had been making inquiries as to pensions. It appeared
      that the authorities might insist upon Alex entering a
      recognized military hospital, and upon his remaining there
      for observation and treatment. It might be a question of
      months--many months. But when the proposal was put to Alex
      his face crinkled up like a child's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to go, Kit. I'd be miserable. It wouldn't do
      me any good."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was very grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps I ought to let you go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll go--if you think I ought to."
    </p>
    <p>
      But she did not want him to go. She had a wisdom of her
      own, and she pressed Dr. Drake with still more persistence.
      He--too--was afraid of realities. He had taken the trouble
      to motor over to a certain hospital where he had a friend
      upon the staff. He asked questions. The particular friend
      was just a little unorthodox. He had realized that the mind
      of man was--"Like a Chinese puzzle, my dear chap. One of
      those things one twiddles at or gives a shake to, and
      something happens. I have had one or two extraordinary
      results." Dr. Drake wanted to be told. "Well, I've shocked
      them, staged a mental concussion. And things happened."
    </p>
    <p>
      So, Dr. Drake stood at the window of Kitty's sitting-room
      and watched Alex weeding a flower bed with an ingenious
      contrivance of his own, an old dinner fork lashed to the
      end of a bamboo cane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The question is--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty watched Dr. Drake's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The question is--just how much is he paralyzed? If it's a
      mixture of the functional and the organic--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Put it into plain English."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The paralysis may be only partial. There is paralysis, and
      the paralysis that exists may be
      dominating--suppressing--the part of him that might--walk.
      Do you take me--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean he can't walk, because he thinks he can't walk?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Half and half. He thinks the whole of him can't
      walk--because part of him can't. It's a possibility."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to test it," said she. "And how?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Drake fingered his collar and tie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some kind of shock, perhaps. Supplying him with so sudden
      and urgent a need for walking--that he might--An emotional
      shock. Something of that kind."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was silent.

    <p>
      Meanwhile, the "Woman of Cardigan Square" as he called her,
      had become to Jermyn St. George almost a figure of pathos.
      He knew that she knew of the success of "Kitty's,"
      comparative and impermanent as that success might be, for
      he had made it his affair to keep her acquainted with these
      happenings. Regularly once a week he would emerge from a
      taxi, and stand waiting with his back to the big mahogany
      door, surveying the square which was but one cube in the
      mosaic of his beloved London. The quality of his welcome
      never ceased to intrigue him. "We meet like cat and dog,"
      he wrote in his diary, "but like cat and dog who have
      agreed to respect claws and teeth." Mrs. St. George never
      made it appear that she was glad to see him. She was, and
      she wasn't. He came from the enemy's camp, and yet there
      was for her a curious and contradictory challenge in these
      meetings. She rather resembled a woman of severe niceness
      compelling herself to read a novel that was supposed to be
      unpleasant. Not that old Jermyn was unpleasant to her. They
      fenced with each other, but with perfect good manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet she would not unbend.
    </p>
    <p>
      And old Jermyn would sit there in that room that had been
      Alex's, and stir his tea, and think--
    </p>
    <p>
      "Woman--it would be so easy! You have only to utter half a
      dozen words, and everything would be different, you, your
      son, your son's wife. As it is--you have lost him. Never
      will you recover anything but a little part of him--and
      yet--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was sorry for her, quite profoundly sorry, and surprised
      to find himself so sorry. She did not deserve sympathy; she
      had behaved like the very worst sort of religious fanatic;
      she had displayed the qualities of a "Bloody Mary." Yet, in
      a way, she was as pathetic as that most hateful of Queens,
      that sour-souled suppressionist, deserted by her husband,
      surrounded by an odour of burnt flesh. Clara St. George
      would have been capable of burning and of torturing; she
      had burnt and tortured; she had been ready to shut up her
      son in the Iron Virgin of her own egoism. Such women
      persist, and also--such men. There are priests who would
      still fire the faggots--if they dared.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she gave Jermyn the impression of a woman who had
      suddenly grown old: her eyes had a dry hardness, and her
      pale skin looked as though it would crack over her nose and
      cheekbones. Her rigidity remained, but it hung a little
      wrinkled over a shrunken self-confidence. That she was a
      very miserable woman sitting erect before a dying fire was
      as plain to him as the futility of her attitude of
      no-surrender. Also, she did not or would not allow herself
      to realize how crushingly life had defeated her. She might
      have been one of the bitter Puritan women watching the
      London crowd howling mad over the return of Charles II;
      amazed, shocked, scandalized, quite unable to understand
      that though the suppressionist has his uses, his bones will
      be thrown out into the charnel house when they have clogged
      life sufficiently to provoke the eternal and positive
      reaction. She sat there frozen with obstinacy. She remained
      wilfully apart while live and wonderful things were
      happening to her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There shall be no spring but my spring."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence she was making for herself a perpetual winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once--only--was he able to provoke her into discussing her
      attitude to her son's present and his future. It appeared
      that Alex had sinned against her sacrosanct conventions; he
      had mixed his classes; he had allowed himself to become
      involved with the cheap and the vulgar. And such a ménage
      promised to produce the inevitable shabby ending. What else
      could you expect? When a man became <i>déclassé</i> the fly
      in the web of a little shrewd adventuress? Besides--there
      was the mother--
    </p>
    <p>
      Jermyn had to disagree.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A doctor's widow--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "From Whitechapel--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still--he was a doctor. And the woman was left high and
      dry with two daughters, and she had to do something--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--yes--something--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She tightened up her lips. She would not discuss Mrs.
      Sarah. The very thought of the woman disturbed her like a
      bad odour, or some piece of hireling insolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then--the girl. The whole atmosphere. So hopelessly
      cheap. I have a right to my prejudices. Prejudices are in
      the blood. You don't seem to be one of us, Jermyn. You seem
      to have--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Back-slided. I won't force the retort."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a slight twitch of the shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So--impossible--the whole business. Besides--there is
      Melfont. I was taking up Melfont again next year. I can
      afford it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her with a queer, glittering irony.
      So--Melfont was to have been the ultimate stage, with Alex
      as the correct son and the country gentleman. He had no
      quarrel with Melfont as Melfont, or with the ideal of the
      English country gentleman. Life had painted a very pleasant
      and admirable picture in this green England, but it was a
      fading picture, like some old, sad, dim, loyal portrait of
      a Cavalier. Moreover, the brisk hot blood and the spleen of
      the Georgian days had cooled to a negative correctness. If
      the future was to have its aristocracies, why not from the
      loins of such little women as Kitty? Melfont was a
      tradition, and traditions were grassing over.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--why not afford it--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened her eyes very wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For myself--? O--possibly--But there could be no--no
      continuity. I had intended--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He wanted to say to her--"Why not make the best of it? The
      best is a great deal better than you will allow. Alex's
      wife is a plucky and capable little woman. She seems to be
      just the woman for him." But he did not say these things.
      If Clara St. George was not capable of saying them to
      herself--well--they were better left unsaid. Moreover, the
      war seemed to have opened a chasm, and Melfont St. George's
      was on the other side of the chasm. It would belong to
      Clara St. George so long as she lived, and youth asks for
      something of its own. It demands its own show.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that he could say to her was--"Well, take up Melfont
      again. It will give you an interest," but he realized even
      while he was making the suggestion that Clara St. George
      could not dissociate Melfont from Alex. She wanted her
      country house and her country gentleman. She wanted to
      order both her property and her son just as in the old days
      she had ordered Melfont and her husband. The situation was
      impossible. Kitty had made it impossible. And it was Kitty
      who mattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile he had remained in correspondence with Mr. Samuel
      who was still full of deplorings, and urgently declaring
      that life is a serious business, and that Jermyn appeared
      to be incapable to taking it seriously. The Archdeacon was
      willing to recognize the marriage, but he was unwilling to
      recognize the Sabbath drum, and this product of the New
      Paganism. These two young people should be removed from
      Shelford. It was impossible that providence and
      circumstances would succeed in removing them. Samuel was
      convinced that Clara would be willing to provide her son
      with an allowance upon which Alex and his wife would be
      able to recover a certain social rightness in some quiet
      country place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jermyn chuckled. Sam was not an out-and-out
      suppressionist. He must have his cake iced with compromise.
      But Jermyn, having exercised his puckishness, wrote a last
      letter, a letter that met with no reply.
    </p> 
    <blockquote>
      "DEAR SAM--<br>
      <br>
      "I believe you are something of an ornithologist. I have
      just been reading Hudson's 'Birds and Man.' In it he states
      that the jackdaws at Wells are divided into two clans, the
      daws who dwell about the cathedral and the daws who dwell
      in the Ebor Rocks. He quotes the local opinion that a young
      daw taken as a pet from the Ebor Rocks is a more lively and
      more intelligent and more amusing bird than a cathedral
      daw. Can you explain this phenomenon? Surely it is not
      possible that the odour of sanctity--and the serene
      atmosphere of a cathedral close can be held responsible for
      producing a bird of less intelligence--?"

      For some days Kitty carried Dr. Drake's words in her head.
      "An emotional shock." Or, she saw those words painted upon
      her consciousness like large black letters upon the white
      surface of a cinematograph screen, preparing the "house"
      for dramatic happenings. An emotional shock? But if she was
      prepared to try so drastic an experiment how and where was
      it to be staged? On the river, or in her garden? And where
      upon this most placid summer Thames between the red walls
      of Hampton and the green spaces of Runneymede was an
      emotional shock to be sought for?
    </p>
    <p>
      Her imagination explored all manner of expedients. Should
      she pretend to be ill, suddenly and acutely ill? And she
      laughed.

    <p>
      "I--do--set a value on myself!"
    </p>

      But over the making of cakes for her dance teas, or while
      shaking and cuffing pillows she searched continually for
      possibilities, some dramatic situation. How and where?
      Should she tell him--? But no--That would not be quite
      fair, nor might it prove--
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly her inspiration came to her. The Vine Cottage
      punt had been leaking and Mr. Venables had been busy with
      red lead and a putty knife, and she went down to the river
      about sunset on a hot August day to assure herself that the
      punt had ceased to take in water. To her came the shouts of
      children playing some game in the lane. An intense and
      horizontal glow lay for a space upon the river and the
      fields, and upon Shelford's chimney-stacks and roofs and
      trees. The lawns had a tinge of gold in their greenness.
      The beds of geranium and lobelia blazed red and blue as
      though lit by lamps hidden beneath the flowers. In the
      massive foliage of the chestnut-trees the light splintered
      itself into diffused glimmerings. The patterning on the
      bank of the great plane was mapped out with extraordinary
      distinctness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was staring at the punt. She saw that the floorboards
      were dry. As though satisfied her glance lifted and dwelt
      upon the river, and the river had such a stillness and a
      brilliancy that it made her think of liquid light. She
      looked towards the sun, or the half of it--a great, glowing
      dome rising above the level of the meadows. She was
      watching the diminishing of this great half circle when the
      idea came to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave her head a toss and a shake. Of course! How
      obvious! She smiled as Mrs Sarah might have smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose it's cheek--but would anything else--?"
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      She made her plans with characteristic thoroughness. She
      chose her day--a Tuesday. She told the girl Annie that she
      could take the day off. On the evening of the Monday she
      went to see Dr. Drake.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to feel sure--that it would not do him any harm."
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time since she had known him she saw Dr.
      Drake's face lose its expression of imperturbable
      dustiness. He stared very hard at her. He pressed his lips
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think so--it's a brain wave. But you can--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--yes--I can--And I shan't have much on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I'd like to be--about."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I shouldn't want you--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I realize that. Supposing--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say ten o'clock on Tuesday--to-morrow. The front door will
      be open, and no one about. You can slip in--and watch. But
      I don't want you to interfere--unless--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--it's your show, Mrs. St. George. I'll be there--to take
      off my hat to you in private."
    </p>
    <p>
      Early on the morning of the Tuesday, before Alex had been
      lifted from the bed to his chair, she took Old George
      aside; in fact she took him to look at the punt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want you to be out of the way, George, this
      morning--about ten o'clock."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mystified but sympathetic, for he would have attempted to
      bury himself in one of the geranium beds had she asked him
      to do so, he expressed a desire to have this state of "out
      of the wayness" more clearly defined.
    </p>
    <p>
      "D'you mean you want me to go home, or just to be messing
      about out o' sight?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Out of sight, George. And if you should hear Mr. Alex
      shouting--don't come rushing out--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No--miss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At least--not at once. But I'd like you to keep an eye on
      Mr. Alex--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "An eye--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In case--he tries to do anything dangerous. You'll
      understand--when you see--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "About ten o'clock, miss?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a board in the dance-house floor that wants a
      touch with the plane. I shall be in there, looking through
      one of the bits of trellis."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty and her husband breakfasted in the kitchen. She gave
      him bacon and eggs, and she could have sung a poem over her
      frying-pan; and saluted that English dish with the humorous
      fervour of <i>Punch's</i> poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bacon and eggs, masculine eggs!" And eggs rhymed with
      legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was excited, and determined to appear as calm as the
      loaf of bread upon the table, but she broke one egg in
      transferring it from the frying pan to the dish.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bother--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Alex was reaching for the mustard pot, and his face
      expressed nothing but the healthy satisfaction of a man
      proposing to enjoy a masculine breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right--I'll take the broken one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, you won't; I did it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Toss you for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be silly."
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down and began to pour out his tea. She had assumed
      an air of casual, workaday brightness. She gave her bobbed
      head a shake.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--I say--boy, I'm going to have a shot at poling the punt
      this morning. It's absurd--living on the river--and not
      being able--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I thought you could."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm a duffer--still. I have had one or two tries--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I wasn't looking!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you can look this morning. Expect I'll go round and
      round."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't lose the pole."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll take a paddle with me in case I do. If one can't
      manage one's own punt--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards he helped her to wash up the breakfast things,
      and then wheeled himself out into the garden with the
      morning paper tucked in beside him. Kitty had other
      preparations to make. With sudden matronly foresight she
      put on her oldest woollen jumper, and a pair of cotton
      stockings, and shabby white canvas shoes. She laid out a
      complete change of clothes. She made up the beds. She
      looked out of her window and saw Alex on one of the lawns,
      and about four yards from the river's edge, smoking a pipe
      and reading the paper. Not a boat was to be seen upon the
      river. The poplars fringing the farther meadows shimmered
      in the sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked down at her husband with a considering and
      critical curiosity that was suffused with tenderness. What
      would be the ultimate significance of this experimental
      splash? What did she mean to him? Was she of sufficient
      importance? Would the shock be so instant, so convincing,
      and so powerful that it would prove--?
    </p>
    <p>
      And supposing it proved that he could not move those
      helpless legs of his, or was not instinctive man enough to
      move them? O, but if he could he would. Surely?
    </p>
    <p>
      She appeared in the garden. She called to him casually.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any news?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going off now. I want to see if I can pole across to
      the other side."
    </p>
    <p>
      She went along to where the punt was moored, glancing into
      the dance-house on her way, and meeting Old George's intent
      blue eyes. She unfastened the punt, stepped into it, and
      unshipped the pole. Alex's newspaper lay across his knees;
      he was watching her, and with a toss of the head she pushed
      the punt out from the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was very little stream running, and she poled out
      into deep water.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," she thought--"now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She could see his eyes. They watched her attentively, but
      with no anxious flicker, for no doubt the day's prospect
      had a placid smoothness, flowing seawards like the river on
      a sunny August morning. In one hand he held the bowl of his
      pipe. She fancied that he was rather amused by her
      amateurish thrustings, and by the devious progress of the
      punt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Purposely missing the river bottom with the pole she went
      over and under with a very creditable splash. Yet even
      while the sound of her own splash was in her ears she heard
      a cry. She came up with a shake of the head, and over the
      crumpled water saw her husband's chair empty, and the white
      newspaper lying beside it on the grass. He was on his feet
      within a yard of the river. He seemed to sway. He was
      shouting and flapping his arms. "George--George, help!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her instant exultation was shot through with fear. He might
      leap in or fall in. She struck out shorewards while the
      punt went drifting; she called to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Boy--I'm all right--I'm all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      She swam with all her soul and body towards the green
      slope, and as his face grew more and more distinct it
      seemed to assume an expression of staring bewilderment, of
      gradual surprise. It was as though he was only just
      realizing that he had walked, that he was on his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Boy--I'm all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly she saw him sit down abruptly on the grass
      like a very young child collapsing in the middle of one of
      its first attempts to toddle. He looked most absurdly
      astonished. He felt the grass with his hands, and then put
      them to his head. His eyes stared at her tawny, swimming
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      She reached the shallow water and climbed out dripping, her
      eyes ashine under her mop of wet hair. She felt like warm
      air, buoyed up by an immeasurable exultation, even while he
      was looking at her with a sort of infinite and breathless
      solemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kitty--I've walked--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--my God--but did I do it? I--was--scared--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She knelt down beside him and drew his head against her wet
      warm body.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--my dear--! You did. You must have done."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was trembling. Both of them were trembling. They did not
      see Old George putting off in a boat to recover the punt
      and the pole, and carefully looking in any direction but
      theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kitty--my darling--you're all wet--Go and change."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll catch cold. I--I want to think. I'll just sit here
      till you come back. Be quick--I did walk. I must have
      walked."
    </p>
    <p>
      She kissed his head, and quickly rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll get up and walk, boy, when I come back.
      O--how--wonderful!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran in. There was sudden moisture in her eyes other
      than that which came from the wetness of her hair. And as
      she rushed into the cottage she saw Drake standing in the
      kitchen doorway; he drew back into the passage but pushed
      out an abrupt hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great! You've done it. I saw."
    </p>
    <p>
      She held his hand for a second, and then fled up the stairs
      to drag off her wet clothes and slip into dry ones. She was
      breathlessly hurrying to return to the garden, and to the
      consummation of an emotional shock, and to convince herself
      and him that the thing had happened.
    </p>

    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      Glancing from her bedroom window Kitty saw that Alex had
      not moved. He had remained sitting there on the grass
      within a yard of the river, and his stillness seemed to
      suggest fear, a dread lest he should find that the almost
      miraculous thing could happen but once, and would not
      happen a second time. Or was he waiting for her?
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran down the stairs. She had a glimpse of Dr. Drake
      standing by the window of the sitting-room, and she paused
      in the doorway and spoke in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will leave him to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      His smile was whimsical.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course--Your show. But I want to see. Get him up on his
      feet again at once. It's absolutely--necessary."
    </p>
    <p>
      As if she did not know!
    </p>
    <p>
      But had life ever been so thrilling or so full of wise
      happenings? He heard her coming over the grass, and turning
      a quick head looked up at her over his shoulder. His
      forehead showed a pucker of conscious effort, and his eyes
      had that anxious and wide prominence that had so appealed
      to her during the war.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going to try now."
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood looking down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I help?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No--please. I want to try and move."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course you can. I'm sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      Supporting himself with his hands resting on the grass he
      made his first effort. Almost she could feel him making
      that effort. The right leg gave a twitch; the foot slid
      over the grass as the limb bent at the knee. She saw his
      face flush up, and a look of infinite relief rush into his
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Splendid! Now--the--other."
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was less successful with the left leg; it stuck out
      stiffly, and though he was able to flex the foot on the
      leg, the limb would not come up. "Seems stiff--somehow."
    </p>
    <p>
      He could roll the foot to and fro, and move the toes, and
      she knelt down, and grasping the leg, flexed the leg
      slightly, encountering a rigidity, a sense of resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you can move it. Not quite so well as the
      other--perhaps. But you can."
    </p>
    <p>
      He said suddenly: "I'm going to get up."
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not offer to help him. She knelt and watched, aware
      of his intent and purposeful face, understanding that he
      did not ask for interference even from her. He turned
      slowly until he was half prone and supporting himself on
      his arms. He got on one knee--the right knee. His eyes had
      a stare of preoccupation; they did not see her praying,
      devoted, maternal little face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had difficulty with that stiff leg, but slowly, using
      his arms, he raised himself till he was crouching, balanced
      on one foot, and Kitty's hands gripped her skirt, for their
      impulse was to fly out and help him. She held her breath.
      And with a sudden effort he straightened himself, his hands
      coming to rest upon the right knee so that the arms
      assisted in the upthrust of his body. He was standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've done it."
    </p>
    <p>
      She too rose, but slowly, with the air of a woman rising
      from prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have done it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He appeared just a little unsteady, but never had she seen
      his face so determined. It had a set pallor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going to walk."
    </p>
    <p>
      He put out his right foot, and she saw that when he tried
      to move the left leg he found movement difficult. He had
      both to swing and to drag it forward with a kind of jerky,
      circular motion, but he managed to get it forward. His
      hands were clenched, and she could hear him breathing. She
      went with him step to step as he walked very slowly and
      tentatively over the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kit--I can."
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly he seemed to falter, and she caught him, but
      the faltering did not come from a failing of his
      confidence. It was emotional, the trembling of an
      overcharged joy, an exultation that felt choked and
      stifled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--Kit--I can. I'm--not--not--I shan't be such a beastly
      drag--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Old George, who had been looking through one of the
      dance-house windows, got suddenly down upon his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      Ever afterwards they called that day the "Day of Walking."
      For Alex would do nothing but walk, going up and down the
      grass, and dragging that stiff leg with a swinging
      movement, and a slight roll of the body. Hardly could he be
      persuaded to rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mustn't do too much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not tired, Kit. Come along, I must show Old George."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had to humour his great happiness and his passion to
      express it in movement. No longer was he a legless
      creature, but a man-child setting out to possess a new
      world, and exulting in it. "O, Kit, I can hardly believe
      it." She made him lean upon the back of his wheeled chair
      and push it before him. "You can rest on it." In turn he
      humoured her. He pushed the chair before him, leaning some
      of his weight on it, and talking to her in short and eager
      sentences. He said that it was difficult for him to
      realize--Nor could he understand how it was that he had
      allowed his legs to assume themselves to be paralyzed. And
      now--after all these months! He supposed that there was
      some explanation, and that Dr. Drake could explain it. "By
      Jove, won't he be astonished." He propelled the wheeled
      chair along the broad grass path to the dance-house, his
      head very much in the sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never thought I should walk along here, Kit."
    </p>
    <p>
      He called to Old George who had remained busy in the
      dance-house, or pretending to be busy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "George, come and see something, man."
    </p>
    <p>
      George came and saw. He had an air of sheepish, staring
      benignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well I never, sir--! It's a good business--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He could say no more. The simpler, warmer-hearted sort of
      Saxon is an inarticulate creature who is eloquent only with
      his eyes, or with a few words strung between blunt
      silences, or with a grab of the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You won't be needing that chair much more, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Kitty was even more silent than the men, for her child
      had walked, and the physical act had for her many
      implications. She watched him with a kind of devoted, grave
      intentness. She had a feeling that she was both less hers
      and more hers, for it was she who had done this thing,
      though she would never let him know that it had been done
      with a purpose. She was able to divine the future as a
      period of new possibilities and readjustments. He would
      be--in some ways--less intimately and dearly dependent upon
      her. He would be, able to go his own way, or what might
      appear to be his own way. And yet--
    </p>
    <p>
      At least she made him come and sit under the shade of the
      plane-tree, but he asked not to sit in the wheel chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to feel that I have done with it--Kitty."
    </p>
    <p>
      So she carried out a Windsor chair from the kitchen, and
      planted it firmly, and stood behind to steady it while he
      made his first attempt at sitting down. The left leg was
      still the difficulty, sticking out stiffly like a wooden
      limb, and compelling him in sitting down to adopt a
      sideways movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This bally old leg--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She touched his cheek lingeringly with her fingers. Never
      would her grown child be so helpless and the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's bound to get much better. Boy, I'm going to send off
      two telegrams."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Telegrams! Who to?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother and Mr. Jermyn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kit," said he, "do you know--I feel--that I want to show
      off!"

      Mr. Jermyn St. George was in Scotland, growing yet more red
      and lean upon somebody's grouse moor, but Mrs. Sarah
      arrived at Shelford by the 3.40 train. Her solidity cast an
      emphatic shadow on the paved path outside the red brick
      booking-office. No taxi was to be had. Taxis, like the
      manners of the multitude, were apt to be lacking during the
      post-war period, so Mrs. Sarah proceeded to walk. The
      afternoon was extremely hot. The blue of the sky burned
      above a dusty and a rather shabby Shelford, a Shelford that
      needed new paint, and many new window blinds, and new
      awnings over its shops. The heat hung in a haze over the
      beeches of Shelford Park. The river shimmered; even the
      poplars were breathless and still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah, being of a comfortable amplitude--felt the
      heat, but of what use was the Ship Inn in these days of the
      bureaucrat and of diluted beer. She persevered. Where there
      was shade, either of house or tree, she availed herself of
      it. She perspired. She arrived at Vine Cottage with a
      flushed face and a moist forehead, but with an air of
      incorruptible, physical optimism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty was putting the kettle on the gas stove when she
      heard Mrs. Sarah's ring. She had had premonitions. She
      hurried down the passage to open the door, and seeing the
      round, red, cheerful face under the black hat, felt that
      life was good business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind the closed door she fell upon her mother. They
      embraced,
    </p>
    <p>
      "You dear, you do look hot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I--am--hot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You walked--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems to be a walking day, poppet. When your wire
      came--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty pressed her chin against her mother's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's been a great day. I fell out of the punt--on
      purpose--but he's not to know that--and when he saw me in
      the water--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He found his legs. Good lad! My dear, it's almost like
      Armistice Day all over again. I knew--somehow--"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Kitty had one of her pregnant silences. She held her
      mother with both hands, and let her head slip a little
      lower. Had there ever been so solid and satisfying a body
      as Mrs. Sarah's?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know. I've wanted this, and now it's happened--I feel
      that I've lost something. He's in the garden
      now--practising walking. One leg is not much good. But
      he'll be different. It's almost as though I'd seen a child
      grow up all in a day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah exerted pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why--of course--poppet. But when a woman makes a baby or a
      man--well--it's just as much her business. It's as much
      your job now as ever--or should be. Have you told his
      mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would tell her at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you. Write a letter. I'll post it in town tonight."
    </p>

      Clara St. George was a woman who took more pleasure in the
      receiving of letters than in the reading of them, and who
      exercised discrimination in the handling of her
      correspondence. She understood that letters arrived and
      saluted you as a person of some distinction, as a
      gentlewoman whose patronage was worthy of record in the
      world's ledgers. She liked large envelopes, and paper of
      rich texture, either glossed like ivory or of a fine matted
      dullness, but tinted note-paper she would not tolerate. A
      crest on the flap of an envelope gave her the same sense of
      inward satisfaction as did one of the rings on her fingers.
      Circulars she regarded as polite attentions from an
      anonymous commercial world. Appeals from charitable
      societies made her remember that there were people who
      could stand hat in hand at the bottom of her steps and wait
      upon her bounty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her morning's mail was never inconsiderable. It would be
      placed upon her breakfast-table, some two inches to the
      left of a white plate with a blue border, and before
      commencing her meal she would take up the pile of letters,
      circulars, and bills and sort them, arranging them in
      little groups or hierarchies. She was influenced by the
      texture of the envelopes. A letter with a crest was given a
      place apart. The middle-class fry were paraded just beyond
      the silver toast-rack. Circulars and bills were made to
      withdraw beyond the Regency salt-cellar and mustard-pot.
      She opened the more debonair letters first. Circular and
      bills might be glanced at towards the end of the meal, and
      relegated at her leisure to her desk or the wastepaper
      basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on this August morning her normal procedure was altered
      by a particular envelope of a greyish-blue colour that lay
      on the top of the pile, an envelope obviously without
      breeding or traditions, and originating from some cheap
      letter-book. The colour damned it. Also, Mrs. St. George
      happened to recognize her daughter-in-law's handwriting,
      and her eyes seemed to reflect the chill of that grey-blue
      paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      She held the letter poised for a moment. A fried sole was
      waiting on the silver entrée dish. And the morning sunlight
      striking aslant across the long and spacious room with all
      its faded and mellow richness, lit up the portrait of the
      Waterloo St. George. His red coat blazed, and above it an
      amused and sardonic face looked down. Woman, woman, yes,
      but not that sort of woman! Milord would not materialize
      himself and descend from his picture-frame for the sake of
      a neo-Georgian gentlewoman.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a quick thrust of a small table-knife Alex's mother
      opened the grey-blue envelope. Her hands expressed a
      superfine fastidiousness as she extracted the sheet,
      unfolded it, and read.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a very short letter.
    </p> 
    <blockquote>
      "DEAR MRS. ST. GEORGE,<br>
      <br>
      "I think you ought to see Alex.<br>
      <br>
      "Yours faithfully,<br>
      <br>
      "KITTY ST. GEORGE."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p align="center">

    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      If it is true that we believe that which we wish to
      believe, then Alex's mother rushed too rapidly to her
      conclusions, though as a woman of the world she did explore
      the various possibilities. She ate her breakfast a little
      more hurriedly than usual, with that letter of Kitty's
      propped against the milk-jug. She continued to glance at it
      as though trying to penetrate its inwardness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obviously, all was not well with her son, and she was
      conscious of a little chilly stirring of exultation, but
      mingled with it were inclinations that were more elemental.
      Her blue eyes stared. It could not be that the couple were
      in need of funds, for Kitty's venture had proved
      provokingly successful, nor did it seem likely that her
      daughter-in-law was touting for future favours. "I think
      you ought to see Alex." Ought! An impertinent word. And yet
      might it not be a momentous word? Did it not mean that all
      was not well with Alex, or that Alex's wife had discovered
      the disadvantages of supporting a helpless husband? The
      young women of the day were quickly bored. And if Alex was
      ill--?
    </p>
    <p>
      That--too--was understandable. Had not Mrs. St. George
      foreseen the possible denouement? To take a delicate and
      paralyzed man from his sheltered corner, to plunge him into
      the thick of cheap excitements, to persuade him to try and
      do too much? And the shock of sex? Yes, these coarse-fibred
      women might have been too heavy-handed, too vulgarly
      clever. Something had happened. Was it not probable that
      there had been a sudden flaming up of the old trouble, an
      extension of the paralysis? That war wound, quiescent but
      unhealed, had flared up afresh, and this piece of grey-blue
      paper was a fluttering signal of distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had she not foreseen it, and waited for it? A degradation
      physical and mental. And she sat very still for some
      minutes, a woman whose possessive passion exulted, while
      from this very exultation exuded a cold and viscous
      emotion. Her fingers curved themselves to clutch and to
      hold. Was it not possible that she might yet recover the
      helpless body of her son, or at least recover the
      realization of him, as a victim sacrificed upon the wrack
      of a coarse young woman's appetite? She could think of it
      as a tragedy. Yes, and as a tragedy that would leave her
      standing severely and supremely right, and able to look
      down like accusing and intervening fate upon these
      interlopers. She could say--"I knew. See what you have
      done. Had you but left him with me--"
    </p>
    <p>
      The cold sparkle of her revived. She was the Clara St.
      George of a year ago when she rose from her chair to ring
      the bell. When the maid appeared she found her mistress
      standing at one of the windows with the sunlight shining
      upon her hair, a woman who looked taller than her normal
      self.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Bates downstairs?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell him to have the car at the door in half an hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      So sure was she, and so worldly wise in her sureness, that
      during the drive to Shelford she began to consider the
      possible urgencies of her son's relapse. She might find him
      in bed, with a worried and impatient young wife standing
      aggressively upon the defensive, trying to convince herself
      and the world that she had done everything for the best.
      Young women are human, and especially those young women
      bred in the various Vernor Streets, rapid wenches who ask
      for quick and material results. Mrs. St. George's cynicism
      was catholic. She understood that a helpless husband may
      inspire ennui--and what was marriage but a compromise? She
      sat and looked at the passing landscape, but without paying
      any attention to it, and had the trees plucked up their
      roots and walked she might have remained in self-absorbed
      unawareness. She was intently gazing upon a picture of her
      own painting in which a young man lay helplessly upon his
      back while a resentful and emotional young woman was on the
      brink of betraying the fact that she had made a very
      indifferent bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bates, pulling up the car by Shelford church, was ordered
      through the speaking-tube to drive down Shelford Lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vine Cottage. On the right."
    </p>
    <p>
      She rapped on the glass when the car came level with the
      garden wall, but she sat and waited for Bates to get down
      and open the door. She descended. She rang Kitty's bell. If
      she felt any emotion or curiosity she did not show it. She
      waited with her back to the door, her eyes very still in an
      inexorable and fateful face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened. Mrs. St. George turned very slowly. She
      saw her son's wife wearing that inevitable blue linen
      dress, but somehow looking very dewy and glowing. What a
      complexion the girl had!
    </p>
    <p>
      She said: "I had your letter this morning. I came at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty's eyes seemed to quiver with some inward light. She
      stood back, and Mrs. St. George passed in as though Kitty
      and the door were surfaces to be flattened against the
      wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What--has happened?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty had closed the door. She had picked up the vibrations
      of this other woman's voice as she would have gathered the
      significance of a stare or a smile. And Mrs. St. George had
      never looked less smileless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you will come into the sitting-room--"
    </p>
    <p>
      In the narrow passage with its brown linoleum Kitty held
      her words. She went first into the shabby but pleasant
      little room. She pulled back one of the green curtains and
      stood looking out. A voice behind her said--"My son is
      ill?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty turned quickly. Her face seemed to express sudden
      laughing surprise; her very hair seemed tremulous with a
      laughter that rose like luminous bubbles from other deeps.
      But in her eyes there was a solemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ill? O--no. If you will look--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood aside from the window rather like an artist who
      uncovers a picture, or some little priestess withdrawing a
      curtain. She, too, looked out of the window at her husband
      who was standing by one of the flower beds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alex can walk."
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George stood and gazed. Her face and figure had an
      extraordinary immobility as her eyes watched her son walk
      from one flower-bed to another, helping himself with a
      stick which he held in his left hand. She saw him bend down
      and pick off a faded bloom, and his unexpected liveness
      seemed to paralyze her. Almost she appeared incapable of
      speech or of movement. Her eyes followed the figure of her
      son, but her head remained quite still between her
      shoulders. Her son was walking, and his gait had something
      of pathos and drollness, suggesting the stiff-legged limp
      of an injured bird. He moved his arms a good deal as though
      helping himself with a flutter of wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty said: "It happened yesterday morning. I always felt
      that it would happen. But it's very wonderful."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. George's head moved. It gave a sudden and jerky
      twist to the right. Her eyes glanced at her
      daughter-in-law's face, and there was hatred in her eyes.
      Never had Alex's mother hated her son's wife as she hated
      her at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet--!
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked again through the window. Alex had turned to the
      river. Some very young and playful impulse stirred in him;
      he was beating the air with his stick; he made an absurd
      and irresponsible attempt at a dance-step, and the toe of
      that dragging left foot caught in the grass. For a moment
      he looked like toppling over.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--my dear!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty's hands went out. She had an air of momentary
      breathlessness. Then she stood still. She said--
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought he was going to fall. Isn't he splendid! I can't
      keep him still. He's always trying--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at Mrs. St. George's face and saw something
      that astonished her, a sudden blurring of the blue eyes, a
      wincing of the precise mouth. Kitty had the impression that
      she was watching a face falling into ruins, a rigid white
      edifice crumbling, the face of a woman grown suddenly old
      and almost feeble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something caught in Kitty's throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Won't you go out to him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood and watched Mrs. St. George walk out of the room
      like a woman who could not distinguish objects very
      clearly. She brushed against the door. She got out into the
      passage, and Kitty heard her fumbling at the catch of the
      garden door. She waited. She saw Alex's mother appear upon
      the lawn, and then Kitty turned away, but she could not
      help hearing what those two said to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--my dear boy--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mater--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Silence held for a moment, and then Alex's voice was heard
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mater--Kitty did it. She fell out of the punt, and I just
      found myself on my legs. That's how it happened. Just like
      that."
